1
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,788
Here. You
starting all over again?

2
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,790
What about it if I am?

3
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,226
Supposing the police come along?

4
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,727
Let 'em come.

5
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,730
The windows are steamed up.
The doors are locked.

6
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,767
It's like a Turkish bath
in here.

7
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,670
Don't it make you thirsty?

8
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,839
Here.
Watch my stockings.

9
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,142
Move over a bit, then.

10
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,681
Get your knee off
the steering wheel!

11
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,283
I can't. I'm stuck.

12
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,684
Here. I'll do it.

13
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,653
Oh, that hurt!

14
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,856
I've told you before

15
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,393
to be careful where
you put your legs.

16
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,395
I was only trying to be helpful.

17
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,762
I can help meself.

18
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,533
Hello.

19
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:16,136
They never make these cars
big enough, do they?

20
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:18,506
Well, are you all settled in?

21
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,375
Right. We can begin.
My name is...

22
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,610
Alfie.

23
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,513
Alfie.

24
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,848
I suppose you think
you're going to see

25
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,450
the bleedin' titles now.

26
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,252
Well, you're not, so relax.

27
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:32,453
Alfie.

28
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:33,854
What time did your old man say

29
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,456
he'd be waiting at the station?

30
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:36,857
Never mind about him.

31
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,459
That's just who I am gonna mind.

32
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,860
Never spoil a good thing.

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,462
That's a thing

34
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,939
you women can't get
into your heads.

35
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,465
Enough's as good as a feast.

36
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:45,765
Ohh, you've changed your tune.

37
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,468
That horn put me off.

38
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,637
I hate noise
at a time like that.

39
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,206
Eh, mate?

40
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,607
Don't forget your napkin.

41
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,876
When I first saw you
put your handkerchief

42
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,611
over your shoulder,

43
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,214
I thought you were
going to play fiddle.

44
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,250
I'm from a musical family.

45
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,384
Here.
What?

46
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,419
Mind you don't catch cold.

47
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,759
I've had a lovely time, Alfie.

48
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,296
A married woman, see?

49
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,731
They're all in need
of a good laugh.

50
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,733
It don't never strike
their husbands.

51
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,735
Make a married woman laugh,

52
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,338
and you're halfway
there with her.

53
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,740
Course it don't work
with a single bird.

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,742
Starts you off
on the wrong foot.

55
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,711
Get one of them laughing,

56
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,313
you won't get nothing else.

57
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,315
♪ Ia-Di,
la-dum... ♪♪

58
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,583
Just listen.

59
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:38,352
It was dead glum
when I met it tonight.

60
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,489
I listened to its problems,
then I got it laughing.

61
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,291
It'll go home happy.

62
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,708
Where did you tell your husband

63
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:01,875
you were going?

64
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,210
Pictures with olive.

65
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,312
What pictures?

66
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,746
Just the pictures.

67
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,315
Never be vague like that.

68
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:08,415
It plants suspicion.

69
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,883
No wonder there's

70
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,295
all this broken marriage
and divorce about.

71
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,887
It would never occur to him

72
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,357
another man would
want to take me out.

73
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,525
I see.

74
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,926
Suck these sweets, siddie,

75
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,928
so he don't smell the gin.

76
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,763
I don't care if he does.

77
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,231
Now be human.

78
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,534
We're having fun.
Why hurt him?

79
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,402
You like to see everybody happy.

80
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,372
I don't believe in
making anybody unhappy

81
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,374
or in making an enemy.

82
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,676
You could be crossing
the Sahara desert,

83
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,278
and he'd be just
the bloke you'd meet.

84
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,814
What about next week?
Same time, same place?

85
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,282
Maybe.

86
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,652
I'll go and get me ticket.

87
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,689
What she don't know is,

88
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,725
we won't be seeing
much more of her.

89
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,727
She's on her way out.

90
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,330
When a married woman
gets too hot,

91
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,332
it's time to cool off.

92
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,867
Next she'll want to introduce me

93
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,335
to the husband.

94
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,338
I can see it coming.

95
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,340
Well, good night, dear girl.

96
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,275
This is a ticket
for the firm's dance

97
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,277
on Saturday.

98
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,279
Won't your old man be there?

99
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,383
Yeah, I'd like you
to meet. Good night.

100
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,285
Don't forget your napkin.

101
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,688
Yeah. Well, I'm like
the boy scouts--

102
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,290
always prepared.

103
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:26,293
Once I met the husband,
it puts me off the wife.

104
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,295
He could be dying on his bed,

105
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,297
but if I ain't met him,

106
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:32,299
I won't think about him.

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,701
It's once you meet.

108
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,704
Likely as not, he'll be
a real good sport.

109
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,038
His sort usually are.

110
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,641
As I'm having it off with her,

111
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,644
I'll think about him
hanging his drip-dry shirts

112
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:47,047
or arguing in the pub
about football or cricket.

113
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,850
A lot of his sort are
Chelsea supporters.

114
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,051
Hello.

115
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,722
Had a nice time, dear?

116
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,323
Not bad at all.

117
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,324
Good film?

118
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,326
Well, there was a queue,

119
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:02,329
so we went to
a restaurant instead.

120
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,732
Did you enjoy yourself?
That's the main thing.

121
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,334
I did me best.
What about you?

122
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,737
I've been going through
that garden catalog.

123
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,038
It's very interesting.

124
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,108
You should go out more often.

125
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,110
You come back ever so cheerful.

126
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,613
Made over again, you might say.

127
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,016
Now I'm off to visit
a little bird called Gilda.

128
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,018
While she ain't exactly stupid,

129
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,621
she is a bit on the simple side.

130
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,923
She'd never make a number one.

131
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,925
You couldn't show her off.

132
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,927
She ain't an exciting dresser,

133
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,363
but she's a cracking
little stand-by,

134
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:37,624
and she ain't
a Liberty-taker.

135
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,535
Most birds go mad
to get a bloke,

136
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,905
and the first thing they do
is go about changing him.

137
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,941
Now, I told Gilda
I ain't the marrying sort,

138
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,543
and she don't mind.

139
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,446
She's a stand-by,
and she knows it.

140
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,449
Any bird that knows
its place in this world

141
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,684
can be quite content.

142
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,655
Alfie? Did you
forget your key?

143
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,925
Oh.

144
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,060
Humphrey, it's you.

145
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,030
Yeah, I'm sorry for
coming round so late,

146
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,634
but, well, you know,
I was just passing by.

147
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,035
Yes, I see.

148
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,037
Only I just finished work

149
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,639
and was feeling a bit lonely

150
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,074
so thought I'd, like,
you know, pop in.

151
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,610
Yes, I see.

152
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,118
Uh, have I come
at an awkward time?

153
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,621
I am expecting Alfie any minute.

154
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:08,656
Cor, there ain't half
a pong in here.

155
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,591
It's phul Nana, scent of Araby.

156
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,992
Don't you like it?

157
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,595
No. I like everything
to smell natural.

158
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,996
I got your meal ready.

159
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,599
Never push things
at me right away.

160
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,601
I like to get me bearings.

161
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,002
Just as you like it.

162
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,638
That's enough of that.

163
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:30,611
I saw that geezer
Humphrey going off.

164
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,079
Here, here.

165
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,014
You're not having it
off with him, are you?

166
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,483
Alfie, I can't bear another man

167
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,885
to come near me

168
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,486
since I met you.

169
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:40,888
Well, I just wondered.

170
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,891
Did he just call to give
you these chocolates?

171
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,626
No. He called to
tell me he loved me.

172
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,895
Love ya? Blimey,
some men are funny.

173
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,897
Alfie, do you love me?

174
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:53,233
Well, shall we say,
I like you a lot.

175
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,973
Now, well, I will have
that grub after all.

176
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,121
Hot water bottle?

177
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,624
She's getting a bit previous.

178
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,096
Hello.

179
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:26,899
Uh...

180
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,069
Is today the 22nd?

181
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,138
Yeah, I think so.

182
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,041
Shouldn't our little friend
have arrived on the 19th?

183
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,275
Don't worry.

184
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,277
He'll turn up.
He always has.

185
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,912
He's usually so punctual.

186
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,914
I had a good day.

187
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,316
Took over £50 on the till.

188
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,918
Isn't that wonderful?

189
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,921
It's not as if
it was your money.

190
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,958
Well, I like to think
of them doing well.

191
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,960
Besides, it keeps me busy.

192
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,963
Ain't it time you started
that fiddle on the till?

193
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,097
I couldn't.

194
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,999
Must be the only till in London

195
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,934
that ain't bent.

196
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,570
Luigi and his wife,
they treat me like family.

197
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,573
There's all the more
reason to do 'em.

198
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,976
Alfie, I'm happy as I am.

199
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,577
You could still be happy

200
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:13,013
with a few hundred quid
in the bank

201
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,381
instead of tuppence halfpenny.

202
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,719
Now, look...

203
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,690
The one thing you got
to get into your head is

204
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,025
that nobody don't
help you in this life.

205
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,359
You got to help yourself.

206
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,596
If you'd only fiddled
5 Bob a day,

207
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:32,132
you'd have 200 nicker by now.

208
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,734
Money isn't everything, Alfie.

209
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,736
Only people ain't
got none talk like that.

210
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,138
I've had a fiddle
on every job I've done.

211
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,341
A fiddle gives you an
interest in your work.

212
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,144
And everybody should
take an interest

213
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,312
in their work.

214
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,286
There's another little job done.

215
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,688
Yeah.

216
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,764
You sound cheerful, elkins.

217
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,199
Yes, some mornings
I feel quite chirpy.

218
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,270
Not all that chirpy
on what I'm paying you.

219
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,272
You must have a fiddle.

220
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,274
That's defamation of character.

221
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,877
I'll report you to the union.

222
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:20,280
How do you think
I got where I am?

223
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,884
I'm satisfied as long
as you do the job well,

224
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,285
but don't get greedy.

225
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,287
Otherwise you'll kill the goose.

226
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,794
I tumbled at once.

227
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,195
I shouldn't have whistled.

228
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,363
Never be cheerful on a job

229
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,365
if you're doing a fiddle.

230
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,967
You're getting careless, alf.

231
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,935
You can say that again.

232
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,195
Little Gilda, she's pregnant.

233
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:44,805
How long?

234
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,206
A couple of months.

235
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,842
You ain't getting
married to her, are you?

236
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,845
What, me in my state of health?

237
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,053
Sorry. Full up.

238
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,357
Room for just one more inside.

239
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,830
Humphrey, I'm glad
it's your bus.

240
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,964
Are you?

241
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,366
I haven't seen you for so long.

242
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,202
You don't need
flinging downstairs

243
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,970
to know you're not welcome.

244
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,971
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,372
That's all right.

246
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,374
I've missed our little chats.

247
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,410
Have you? Oh.

248
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,379
2 sixpennies, when
you've got the time.

249
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,916
Ta.

250
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,987
I've never seen you
looking lovelier.

251
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,390
I still can't get
you out of my mind.

252
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,994
How's, um, how's
Alfie these days?

253
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,996
He's fine. Fine.

254
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,999
Mind you, it doesn't
hurt like it used to.

255
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,135
What doesn't?

256
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,478
Well, you know,
the old heartache.

257
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,005
Still, I wouldn't be without it.

258
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,408
You haven't got engaged

259
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,412
or anything like that, have you?

260
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,781
No, nothing like that.

261
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,184
He doesn't rush
into things, Alfie.

262
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,029
I don't expect you'll
ever be needing me,

263
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,366
but if you do, I'll--
I'll always be there.

264
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,972
Bye, Gilda.

265
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,206
God bless.

266
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,345
Hello, Alfie.

267
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,347
You're late, girl.

268
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,950
I ran all the way.

269
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,852
Any news? Any reports
from the front?

270
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,956
No.

271
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,324
It doesn't look like it.

272
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,927
We've definitely
got to do something

273
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,328
about this little lot.

274
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:24,064
I-I've tried
everything, Alfie.

275
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,466
You've been taking
stuff on the quiet?

276
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,366
You don't want to make
yourself ill, you know.

277
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,537
Alfie...

278
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,845
You're not getting cooey lately.

279
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,313
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,058
You're not only cooey,
you're more bossified.

281
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,984
It's as though I've got
to take notice of you,

282
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,986
instead of you of me.

283
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,056
I can't describe it,
but I can feel it.

284
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,490
Do you love me?

285
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,493
And what can I say when you ask?

286
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,028
You shouldn't ask.

287
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,568
I'll tell you...
When I feel like it.

288
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,432
I'll make the coffee.

289
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,435
Yeah. Make it strong.

290
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,972
Alfie, I was thinking...

291
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,373
Why can't we...

292
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,008
Go through with it?

293
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,978
Blimey, I've never been
through with anything.

294
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,380
If I was to marry you,

295
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,183
you'd gain a husband,
but you'd lose a friend.

296
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,385
You don't have to marry me.

297
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,387
I've got it worked out.

298
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,989
You've got to think twice

299
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,449
before turning
an innocent creature

300
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,158
out into this world.

301
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,428
I wouldn't turn him out.
I'll have him adopted.

302
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,363
Adopted? What are
you talking about?

303
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,565
By a rich woman, see?

304
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,167
A rich woman?

305
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,170
I'd like to do
that much for him.

306
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,506
He'd have a good life then.

307
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,242
Steady on, girl.

308
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,245
I mean, you can't be sure
there's something there yet.

309
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,248
This morning, I thought
I felt him kick.

310
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,649
How can he kick?

311
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,252
It's not the size
of my thumbnail.

312
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,187
I'll tell you next time.

313
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,056
You'll do nothing of the sort.

314
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,058
Don't give way to your
impulses like that.

315
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,060
Something a woman
might think natural,

316
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,062
like as not, a bloke
would find sickening.

317
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,197
Mrs. Artoni at the cafe
used to call her husband

318
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,565
every time their baby moved.

319
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,167
What you don't realize

320
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,469
is that men are more
sensitive than women.

321
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,039
Remember that big bird
I used to dance with?

322
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,440
One Sunday night,

323
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,442
she showed me her operation scar

324
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,045
what she had made
when she was a kid--

325
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,047
a long scar with
white skin around it.

326
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,049
I got straight out of bed
and put me clobber on.

327
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,051
"What's up with you?"
She says.

328
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,453
"I'd sooner go see
a bleeding horror film"

329
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,522
I said, "than
a thing like that."

330
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,426
Alfie, please.

331
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,994
Please...

332
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,396
Can I... You know,

333
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,399
go through with it
and have the baby?

334
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,035
What are you asking me for?

335
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,037
It's yours, isn't it?

336
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,438
Nobody in this world

337
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,441
has any right to stop you doing

338
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,044
what you want to do.

339
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,579
Oh, steady on, girl.

340
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,181
Now then, now then...

341
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,516
Don't break your bleeding heart.

342
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,451
If you want to do something,

343
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,453
and you think it's right,

344
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,056
you do it.
To hell with them.

345
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,457
Mind me shirt.

346
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,159
Now...

347
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,534
You know what?

348
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,669
She was quite happy
them months she was carrying,

349
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,706
which to my mind
was a bit out of place,

350
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,075
her not being married, see?

351
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,711
Mind you, she came over
quite beautified for a time,

352
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,646
especially in the early months.

353
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,315
And I told her,

354
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:32,652
"blimey, girl, you ain't
as ugly as I thought."

355
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,254
Anyway, her time comes,

356
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,657
and into the hospital
she goes to have it.

357
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:41,261
I wasn't there. I didn't
know till they told me.

358
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:45,298
Then, from all accounts,
the kid comes out at 3:00.

359
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,235
Right bang on the minute,
you might say.

360
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,576
Alfie?

361
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,379
I didn't see you there.
You look all different.

362
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,780
What do you mean?

363
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,682
Oh, sort of mumsie.

364
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:08,455
Um, I--I put my name
down as Mrs. elkins.

365
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,056
Was that all right?

366
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,424
Of course.

367
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,560
Put your name down
as who you like.

368
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,163
It's a free country, isn't it?

369
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,165
I brought you some flowers.

370
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,168
Well, I didn't want to
be seen carrying them.

371
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,569
Oh, that's nice.

372
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,171
Oh, freesias.
How delightful.

373
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,174
I'll put them into
a vase, Mrs. elkins.

374
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,143
What do you think of your
little son, Mr. elkins?

375
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,811
My what?

376
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,146
He hasn't seen him yet.

377
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,548
Here he is.

378
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,787
He's the image of his father.

379
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,597
Yes...

380
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:53,566
I can see more of me
in him than you.

381
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,670
What are you going to call him?

382
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,772
I thought Malcolm Alfred.

383
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,308
Malcolm bleedin' Alfred?

384
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,775
He'll never forgive you,

385
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,745
you give him a name like that.

386
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,347
Here. He's moving.

387
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,382
Quick, you better take him.

388
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,423
Nah, the mistake
I made with Gilda

389
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,824
was getting involved.

390
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,427
I was having
a beautiful little life,

391
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,429
and I couldn't see it.

392
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,398
There was this manageress
of a dry cleaners.

393
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:49,589
And I was getting a suit
cleaned in the bargain.

394
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:54,327
Well, you can't turn
something like that down.

395
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,429
Then there was
this chiropodist woman

396
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,331
from a foot-comfort
service

397
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,733
I was having it off with.

398
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,337
I never had me feet
in such lovely condition.

399
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,274
I was hopping about
like a little fairy.

400
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,277
She's got a little
ginger mustache.

401
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,280
But I find I'm quite
willing to overlook

402
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,682
the odd blemish in a woman,

403
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,684
provided she's
got something else

404
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,453
to make up for it.

405
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,856
Well, that's what we're
all here for, isn't it?

406
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:27,927
To help one another out
in this life.

407
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,529
Then there was Dora,

408
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,299
this little bird
I was having it off with

409
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,933
every Monday and Wednesday

410
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:37,537
when her young man was at
his body-building classes.

411
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,311
And there was always
the odd bird

412
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,646
that came my way by chance.

413
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,485
Oh, what a lovely baby.

414
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,486
Yeah.

415
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,887
Is it yours?

416
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:58,491
No, no.
It's my sister's.

417
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,994
So why I had to be involved
with Gilda, I do not know.

418
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,397
What's that brown
round his mouth?

419
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,499
That chocolate bar I gave him.

420
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,535
Oh, Alfie.
You shouldn't.

421
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,505
You smell a bit milkified.

422
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,508
Oh, I'm sorry, Alfie.
I'll have a wash.

423
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,511
No, I don't mind.
It smells mumsie.

424
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,480
How long are you going

425
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,848
to keep him
breast-feeding?

426
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,284
As long as I can.
It's best for him.

427
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,287
Don't let yourself
get too attached to him.

428
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:29,622
But I'm his mother.

429
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,023
And I'm his father,

430
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,625
but you've got to be fair.

431
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,627
You've got to think of him.

432
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,896
What about this rich woman?

433
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,498
What rich woman?

434
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,933
The one you was
getting him adopted to.

435
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,935
I got to think about it.

436
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,937
I can't rush into it.

437
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,540
You better make up
your mind quick.

438
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,041
Why?

439
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,943
Because he might
get so drawn to you,

440
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,547
he'll fret his heart out
when they take him away.

441
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,949
Who says they're going
to take him away?

442
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,551
That's what you said,

443
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,953
that a rich woman
was going to adopt him

444
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,955
so he wouldn't want for nothing.

445
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,557
That was a long time ago.

446
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,426
You know what you've had?

447
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:08,695
You've had a change of heart.

448
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:11,431
I can see it in your face.

449
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,833
Well, haven't you ever had one?

450
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,802
Yes, but I've
always resisted it.

451
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,438
Lying there in the hospital
feeding him

452
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:19,806
must have brought it on.

453
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:22,942
I saw your face changing
every time I went in.

454
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,477
I'm not ashamed of it.

455
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,546
But think of him.

456
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,681
You couldn't raise him
like this rich woman could,

457
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:31,050
give him the things she could.

458
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,619
We'll see.

459
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,654
I'm going back
to work next week.

460
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,889
She could really
take care of him--

461
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,058
dress him handsome,
feed him beautiful.

462
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,761
Who says I can't
dress him proper?

463
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,329
Look.

464
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,950
Look at that lovely
shawl and cot cover

465
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,933
and all the things
in that drawer.

466
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,502
You can't learn him
to talk nice,

467
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,904
not like this rich woman could.

468
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,906
I can if I try hard.

469
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,942
Before he can talk proper,

470
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,545
he'll be "bleedin' this"
and "bleedin' that."

471
00:22:58,645 --> 00:22:59,846
I won't let him.

472
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,914
These are dry.

473
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:05,718
Who'll look after him when
you go back to the cafe?

474
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:06,953
I'm going to the brewery.

475
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,588
It's better paid.

476
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,590
Lugging bleedin'
beer crates about?

477
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,892
When will you learn some sense?

478
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,495
Who'll watch him while
you're at the brewery?

479
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,497
A woman called
Mrs. tippet.

480
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:20,500
She's got four children
of her own, Alfie.

481
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,902
She'll watch him
from Monday morning

482
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,070
till Friday teatime.

483
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,072
I'll have him all weekend.

484
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,575
I think that's best for him.

485
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,843
And what about--
and what about me?

486
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,879
Do you think I'm going
to spend my weekends

487
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,881
dodging about under wet nappies?

488
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,884
You won't leave us,
Alfie, not now?

489
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,486
I'll have to think about it.

490
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,488
I won't ever ask you
for anything,

491
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,889
not a farthing.

492
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,891
But don't leave us now.

493
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:46,893
If you do,
I'll--I--

494
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,895
now, don't talk like that.

495
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,498
I haven't said I'll leave you.

496
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,934
I just don't think
you'll do right by him.

497
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,536
But I will.

498
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:57,916
I'll look after him,
straight up.

499
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,506
I'll never neglect him.

500
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,909
I'm only telling you
the truth, as I see it.

501
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:05,512
You won't leave us, will you?

502
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:06,913
Oh, promise me, Alfie.

503
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:07,914
Let go.

504
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,482
Don't ruckle me sleeve.

505
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,150
I ain't a savage, you know.

506
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,752
I ain't going to scarper.

507
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,687
But don't you start off crying.

508
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,623
Otherwise I'll belt you one.

509
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,858
I don't feel up to it.

510
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:23,496
Don't. Don't jump up
to him at once.

511
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:25,898
You'll grow so attached
to one another

512
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,568
he won't even go
to this Mrs. tippet.

513
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,571
Here, mate. That's
enough of that now.

514
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:34,507
I'll give you
something to cry for.

515
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:35,742
Come on now.

516
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,085
There, you see?

517
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,121
All you need
is a father's voice.

518
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,957
He's got a hard life
in front of him,

519
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,893
so don't give him
any wrong impression

520
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,127
from the start.

521
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,891
Now, about this
little kid of mine,

522
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,694
he turns out to be
a real quick 'un.

523
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:31,530
He don't half love it
when I play games with him.

524
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:32,932
Never wants his mother,

525
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,634
always asking for his father.

526
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,068
Very soon,

527
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,537
I find I'm getting
quite attached to him.

528
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,106
Know what I mean?

529
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,109
Now, that's something
I always guard against

530
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,711
because sooner or later,

531
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:47,113
that's going to
bring you some pain.

532
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,116
So if a bird
ain't got you one way,

533
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,784
she's got you another.

534
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,958
That's the trouble, isn't it?

535
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,527
Once you get a kid in your life,

536
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:02,995
it ain't your bleedin' own.

537
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,598
Look at the things
you have to do.

538
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,566
Next, please.

539
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,237
Well, you can't be too careful,

540
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,840
not with hereditary.

541
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,574
No smoking, please.

542
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,213
Queer job
for a bird, isn't it--

543
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,949
photographing people's insides.

544
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,918
Chin on the top, please.

545
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,758
Hands on hips.

546
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,893
Shoulders forward.

547
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,294
What does she think I am,

548
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,896
a bleedin' contortionist?

549
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,297
Nice hands, though.

550
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,932
Firm but gentle.

551
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,333
Know what I mean?

552
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,935
I wouldn't mind her
giving me a--

553
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,036
hold it.

554
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,238
Next thing,

555
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,283
they'll be taking pictures
of what you're thinking.

556
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,209
There'll be some
"x" certificates

557
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,311
knocking around then, eh?

558
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,125
Sorry I'm late.

559
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,727
There was a traffic jam
at Piccadilly.

560
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,129
It's all right.
You're here now.

561
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,098
I brought you some cherries.

562
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:14,266
Oh, you shouldn't have done.

563
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,939
Well, we never got that rain
they promised us.

564
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,141
It doesn't look like it.

565
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:26,345
You had a hard morning?

566
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,215
The usual.

567
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,925
I don't like you working
on that brewery bay.

568
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,927
That's no job for a woman.

569
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,929
You get used to it.

570
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,936
What's that?

571
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,670
That's that ring
I was talking about.

572
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,974
Oh, it's heavy.

573
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,909
22-karat.
Solid gold.

574
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,378
Same as I say,
that was my mother's.

575
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,080
They don't make rings
like that today.

576
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,917
They made them to last
in the old days.

577
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,919
Can I try it on?

578
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,354
Yeah, go on.

579
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,324
Eh, no. No, sorry,
but it's--it's bad luck.

580
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,327
They say that once you
put a wedding ring on,

581
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,930
you should never
take it off again.

582
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,166
I don't know if there's
anything in it.

583
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:23,970
Humphrey...

584
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:28,875
How would you feel...

585
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,045
Bringing up another man's child?

586
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,351
Um...

587
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,887
Have a cherry?

588
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,956
You mean little Malcolm.

589
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,358
I mean, once we were married,

590
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,962
I could only look on him
as my own child.

591
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,965
I'd try to be
a good father to him,

592
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,901
if he'd have me.

593
00:28:59,071 --> 00:28:59,972
Here.

594
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,808
Can I have this?

595
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,411
Here. Come on, darling.

596
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:08,314
Have a bit of
the lady's sandwich.

597
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,116
Just a little bit
of the lady's sandwich.

598
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,885
Come on, darling.

599
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,353
Won't hurt you.

600
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:15,955
Just a little bit.

601
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,356
Come on. Good boy.

602
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:18,958
I--I must go.

603
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,393
I shall be late for work.

604
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,895
Will you think over

605
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,497
what I said to you
last Wednesday?

606
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,169
I've been thinking it over.

607
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:35,274
Now I'll tell it to you

608
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,877
for the very last time, Malcolm.

609
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:40,880
Then you got
to go to bye-byes.

610
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,281
Abou Ben adhem,

611
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,883
may his tribe increase,

612
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,886
awoke one night
from a dream of peace

613
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:50,222
and saw within the
moonlight in his room,

614
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,824
makin' it rich,

615
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,160
and like a Lily in bloom,

616
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,496
an angel writin'
in a book of gold.

617
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,298
What's an angel?

618
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,301
You know what
an angel is. I told you.

619
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,904
They're up in heaven,
all around god.

620
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:09,175
Exceeding peace had
made Ben adhem bold.

621
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,843
Who's Ben adhem, eh?

622
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:14,313
He's the man that
it's all happening to.

623
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:17,316
Now shut your eyes
and listen, Malcolm.

624
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,351
Lie down...

625
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:22,121
And don't ask questions.

626
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:25,524
And to the presence
in the room he said,

627
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:28,928
"what writest thou?"

628
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,964
The vision raised its head,

629
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:36,068
and with a look made
of all sweet accord,

630
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,403
answered,

631
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:42,574
"the names of those
who love the lord."

632
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,162
What a lad he is--

633
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,464
could hardly keep his eyes open,

634
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,466
but he wouldn't give in.

635
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,068
You know what?

636
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,569
He went off just like that.

637
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,406
He'll be a real handful
in a few months' time.

638
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,408
We'll have to be careful

639
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,010
what we say in front of him.

640
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,012
He's as sharp as a needle.

641
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,414
Wait till he sees
that great Teddy bear

642
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,416
I bought for his birthday.

643
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,019
It's about that size,
ever so soft.

644
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,988
The bloke who sold it

645
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:32,058
said it was
a real rich kid's Teddy.

646
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:37,063
Here, do you fancy
an hour's kip, girl,

647
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:38,364
while he's asleep?

648
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,168
Cloth ears, I'm talking to you.

649
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,170
Humphrey's been to see me

650
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,305
twice this week at lunchtime.

651
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,474
What's he after--
a bit on the side?

652
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,076
No. Nothing like that.

653
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,044
We just talked a bit.

654
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,050
Then don't tell me
what you talk about

655
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,452
because I don't want to know.

656
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:04,290
I can't bear to hear
about a bird and a bloke

657
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,292
having their innocent
talks together.

658
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:09,461
I think it's more
intimate than the other.

659
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,163
What is he after?

660
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,565
He wants to marry me.

661
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,602
What did you tell him?

662
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,605
That I'd talk it over
with you first.

663
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:22,208
Why talk it over with me?

664
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:23,609
You're a free agent.

665
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,044
Malcolm needs a father.

666
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,445
What do you think I am?

667
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,981
I don't mean a weekend father.

668
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,983
I mean a proper father.

669
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,363
Well, we all need
proper fathers.

670
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,386
And proper mothers, too.

671
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,366
There's just not enough
to go around these days.

672
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,391
I don't love him.

673
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,994
I don't know what love is,

674
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,997
the way you birds talk about it.

675
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,533
But I--I respect him.

676
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,338
Well...

677
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:55,341
You'd better marry him
then, hadn't you?

678
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:59,711
You got young buster
in there to think about.

679
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,480
I'll be seeing you.

680
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,583
Maybe.

681
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,259
Daddy.

682
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,666
Daddy!

683
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,127
Nice, isn't it?

684
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,129
Goes like a bomb, too.

685
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,531
This car-hire firm
I'm working for,

686
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,134
they have all the best stuff.

687
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,436
Know where I'm off to now?

688
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:00,139
Pick up a party of publicans,

689
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,474
take them to Brighton
for the races.

690
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,543
Well, you've got
to enjoy yourself.

691
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:08,547
Once a bloke thinks about
a bird he's finished with--

692
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,582
there's a waste of time.

693
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,421
I'm not picking them up
till half past 11:00,

694
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,423
so I'm just popping in here.

695
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,024
It's about that x ray.

696
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,160
Didn't come out right
or something.

697
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,561
Load of red tape.

698
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,090
Tilt forward, please.

699
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,392
Thank you.

700
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,331
You've done this
before, haven't ya?

701
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,066
Thank you.

702
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,335
Have you been worrying
about anything lately?

703
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,536
Who, me?

704
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,705
No. I'm not
the worrying sort.

705
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,609
Here. You know what?

706
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,545
Gilda's only decided to marry
this Humphrey geezer--

707
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,347
do you get tired easily?

708
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,350
No. I'm full of energy.
Always have been.

709
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,818
I got a letter from her, see?

710
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,820
"I don't love him," she says,

711
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,455
"but I do respect him."

712
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,457
I don't want no bird's respect.

713
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,593
I wouldn't know
what to do with it.

714
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,495
Step on the scales, please.

715
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,498
I haven't got
much time, you know.

716
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:34,099
She's told me time and again

717
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,267
she loves me.

718
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,635
Loves me for meself,

719
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,237
whatever that may mean.

720
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:39,638
Have you lost any weight lately?

721
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,374
No. I always
weigh 12 stone 6.

722
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,642
Have done for years.

723
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:46,378
I've never told her I love her,

724
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,381
except when you
got to say something

725
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,782
for appearances' sake.

726
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,384
11 stone 9 pounds.

727
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,785
Get out of it.

728
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,787
You sure these scales are right?

729
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,789
This suit don't weigh nothing.

730
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,391
9 ounces. Lightweight.

731
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,393
It's a new terylene and mohair.

732
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,728
You don't feel

733
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,697
as though you
got nothing on at all.

734
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,400
The one thing I never
do with a woman,

735
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,568
I never--

736
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,437
take your shirt off, please.

737
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:13,605
Eh?

738
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,241
Would you take
your shirt off, please?

739
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,410
I never crawled to one.

740
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,814
They either take me
as I am or not at all.

741
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,416
Do you perspire?

742
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,352
I mean, do you sweat much?

743
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:27,553
Sweat? No.

744
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:28,920
Tell a lie.

745
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,923
I did sweat last Sunday
at the locarno.

746
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,926
I was dancing then, see,
and I'd had a few beers.

747
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,763
Of course, I use a deodorant
under me armpits.

748
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,832
Just rub it on.
Quite good, they are.

749
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,401
I see.

750
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,370
Do you ever sweat at night?

751
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:47,806
At nights?

752
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,310
You mean in bed?

753
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,612
Yes. In bed.

754
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,614
Come to think of it,

755
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,617
I did sweat a lot last night,

756
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,686
and I couldn't understand why.

757
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:03,655
Sit there with your
back to me, please.

758
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,628
Now take a deep breath.

759
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,398
Now breathe out slowly.

760
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:14,232
She said in her letter,

761
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,834
"Malcolm and me
will be all right

762
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,437
'cause I'll be home
to look after him."

763
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,772
Again. A good deep one.
Hold it.

764
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:33,752
Oh. Let it out.

765
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,754
"What about you,
Alfie?" She says.

766
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,356
"What will you do?"

767
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,357
Say 99.

768
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,225
99.

769
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:41,960
I came over quite choked
at that bit.

770
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,495
Again. Whisper it
this time.

771
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,496
99.

772
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,597
Whisper it again.

773
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,232
99.

774
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,843
Of course,
I managed before--

775
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,336
I managed before I met her,

776
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,237
and I'll manage now she's gone.

777
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:53,618
Do you have a pain in your back?

778
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:54,940
Pain? No.

779
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,942
Last week, I'm missing her,

780
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,944
so I calls her up.

781
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,947
Funny, I do feel
some pain there now.

782
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,949
A bit to the left.

783
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:04,950
There?

784
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,951
Higher up.

785
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:06,952
There?

786
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:07,953
Yeah. There.

787
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,555
Is it tender?

788
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,423
It is when you prod it.

789
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:12,523
Turn around, please.

790
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,893
Yeah, so I calls round, see?

791
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,495
And you know what?

792
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:18,897
She kept me at the door.

793
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,499
Take a deep breath.

794
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,901
But Malcolm must have heard me

795
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,903
'cause he kept
yelling "daddy."

796
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,372
Breathe out.

797
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,474
She wouldn't let me touch her.

798
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:30,676
She drew back, first time ever.

799
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:31,677
99.

800
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:32,678
100.

801
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:34,380
Oh. 99.

802
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,681
"I'm sorry, Alfie," she says,

803
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,283
"but I'm playing fair
by Humphrey,

804
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:39,284
as I did by you."

805
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:40,386
Do you cough much?

806
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,953
Cough? Nah.

807
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,389
Well, only in the mornings,

808
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,790
but so does everyone.

809
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,393
You know, after the first smoke.

810
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:48,827
She never wanted no other geezer

811
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,429
when she was with me.

812
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,431
What playing fair
was there in that?

813
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,299
Do you bring anything up
when you cough?

814
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,702
Nah. I just
clear me chest.

815
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:59,438
That's the point
of coughing, isn't it?

816
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:01,440
Bring something up,
clear the tubes.

817
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,311
The pair of them are taking
my little son from me.

818
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,980
Sometimes, I can hear him
calling "daddy" after me.

819
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,582
Do you find

820
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,993
you get quickly
irritable of late?

821
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,919
Funny you should ask that,

822
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,922
because I find I do me nut
very easily these days.

823
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,490
Do you sleep well?

824
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,925
Like a top.

825
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:23,529
The moment my head touches
the pillow, I'm off.

826
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:24,930
I never wake up till...

827
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,832
I never used to wake up

828
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:29,367
till it was time to get up.

829
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:30,769
That's elkins
with an "s."

830
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,370
Know what I mean?

831
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,772
I think so.
And now?

832
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,375
I always wake up dead on
the same time--4 A.M.

833
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:40,779
No matter how much
I've had to drink or...

834
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,381
Can I be perfectly
frank with you?

835
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:45,083
Certainly.

836
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,760
No matter who's beside me.

837
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,762
You know what I mean?

838
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:59,431
Yes. I understand.

839
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,767
I never have been partial
to these all-night sessions

840
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,368
because, for one thing,

841
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:05,370
I've rarely
found a woman--

842
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:08,774
you don't mind if I
come out with it straight?

843
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,642
You can tell me everything.

844
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,813
Very few birds can get
into my rhythm of sleeping.

845
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:17,916
I see.

846
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,051
I find myself
lying there in the dark,

847
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,653
staring at the ceiling.

848
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,022
I keep thinking about this kid.

849
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,891
I was very friendly
with his mother.

850
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:26,892
Nothing special.

851
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,494
Just an ordinary girl,

852
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:30,796
but I knew him well, the child.

853
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,964
There's something
I must tell you--

854
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:37,569
all I wanted was for her
to come back with Malcolm

855
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:40,572
so we could spend
our Sundays together.

856
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,808
But she never come.
Understand me?

857
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,409
Oh, yes. Perfectly.

858
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,545
Now, if you lose a bird,

859
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:48,547
you can always replace her.

860
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,549
But with a child,
it's different.

861
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:51,950
They're each one themselves.

862
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,553
Each one's got
his different nature.

863
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,555
Now, I may not be

864
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,557
the best daddy in the world,

865
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:00,892
but I'm his real dad.

866
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,428
There's something
I simply must tell you.

867
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:05,564
He's come out of these loins.

868
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,833
What do you want to tell me?

869
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:09,434
Look at this.

870
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:11,603
They can't get away from it.

871
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:12,971
He's my son.

872
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:15,574
This is your x ray,
Mr. elkins.

873
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:16,975
Blimey! Is that me?

874
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,577
Yes, it is.

875
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,646
I'm just a load of ribs.

876
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,581
There are two shadows
on your lungs.

877
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:23,982
Shadows on me lungs?

878
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:25,984
What are you talking about?

879
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,586
Look at this patch.

880
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:29,521
You've got an infection here,

881
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:30,621
and one here.

882
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:31,923
Infection?
I can't have.

883
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,925
I ain't been with nobody.

884
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,527
It's not a question--

885
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,563
you got to do
something about this.

886
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,565
We can deal with it.

887
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:41,567
I want the best
attention there is.

888
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:42,968
I'll even pay for it.

889
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,970
It's just a question of rest.

890
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,572
I can't rest.

891
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:47,973
I'm off to Brighton

892
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,575
with a party of
licentious victualers

893
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,577
for a real good blowout.

894
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:52,978
It's all been booked.

895
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,580
You need rest

896
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,581
in the quiet of the country.

897
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:56,882
I hate the country.

898
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,149
How can you rest

899
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,718
with all that bleedin'
dawn chorus?

900
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:07,626
Oh.

901
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:09,094
What's the matter?

902
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,699
My--my feet
feel like lead.

903
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,836
The sweat is pouring off me.

904
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:20,238
Now, Mr. elkins,
do keep calm.

905
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,740
These are only shadows.

906
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,074
Shadows?

907
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:25,977
On me lungs?

908
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,180
I'm bein' eaten away.

909
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,783
This is the end of me.

910
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,085
Oh, god in heaven, help me.

911
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,198
Good afternoon,
Mr. elkins.

912
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,700
Good afternoon.

913
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,804
Here. Once you know
you ain't going to die,

914
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,141
funny how soon
you pull back to normal.

915
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,551
Know what? I used to think
money was everything.

916
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:08,954
If you've got money,
I used to say,

917
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:10,856
you can have beautiful birds,

918
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,223
handsome suits, a car.

919
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,325
But those things
ain't a bit of use

920
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,961
without your good health.

921
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:17,996
Hello, Harry.

922
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,597
Not come yet?

923
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:22,033
She's run off with the milkman.

924
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:24,936
Here...

925
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,305
See this chap here?

926
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,641
His name's Harry clamacraft.

927
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,342
He's 35 years old,

928
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,944
married, with three kids.

929
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:34,345
He's sitting in bed

930
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,348
waiting for his wife
Lily to visit him.

931
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,950
He's had nothing
else on his mind

932
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,351
since last Sunday.

933
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,253
I know for sure she'll be late.

934
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:43,955
Watch it.

935
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:46,357
In a minute, he'll
pick up that book

936
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,359
and pretend he's not worried

937
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,961
and he's reading.

938
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,130
There.
What did I tell ya?

939
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,133
He's no more reading than I am.

940
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,268
He's listening
for her footsteps.

941
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,871
I ain't had a single visitor

942
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,873
since I been in here.

943
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,876
I told them all
I'm on silence--

944
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,311
not allowed to talk.

945
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:15,320
Oy, Harry,
your old woman's here.

946
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,322
Mrs. clamacraft,
come through here.

947
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,324
Do you think I should?

948
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:21,626
I'm not supposed to.

949
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:23,228
Course you can.
Come on.

950
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:26,397
There she is, Harry.

951
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,066
Hello, love.

952
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,901
Oh, Harry, I'm ever
so sorry I'm late.

953
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,837
That's all right.
Now you've come.

954
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:33,371
She's 20 minutes late.

955
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:36,674
Now she wastes another
20 telling him why.

956
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:39,845
I left home in time,

957
00:44:39,945 --> 00:44:42,848
but everything went wrong
at the station.

958
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:44,282
You look worried.

959
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:45,884
I was only worried

960
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,953
in case something might
have happened to you.

961
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:51,923
Here's your
new-laid eggs.

962
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,925
And here's your marmalade.

963
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,927
Bleedin' great chunks
of peel in it.

964
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,929
No wonder he don't get well.

965
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,199
Did that chap come about
the smell in the garden?

966
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:03,668
He thinks it might be trouble
with the main drain.

967
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:05,203
Look at him.

968
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:07,005
Now he's worried about
the bleedin' drains.

969
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,341
How were your last x rays?

970
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,943
I think they're improving.

971
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,803
Next time have him look
at that loose gutter.

972
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:15,781
It might fall
on you and the kids.

973
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,015
Yeah. Kill
the bleedin' lot.

974
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:18,216
I will.

975
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:20,852
How was your sputum test?

976
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,888
Now there's a morale raiser.

977
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:24,355
They're waiting for the results.

978
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,357
Are you managing all right?

979
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,959
I mean, about money.

980
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,796
Yes. Everything's
going fine.

981
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:31,797
You sure?

982
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:33,731
Yes, certain.

983
00:45:33,832 --> 00:45:35,333
They're trying to get through

984
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,734
to one another.

985
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:38,136
It ain't easy

986
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,737
with their sort of mentality.

987
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,974
Here. See this?

988
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,976
Carla her name is.

989
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,212
Hear how her skirt rustles?

990
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,214
There's something
about that rustling.

991
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:52,217
I think I'll get on me bed,

992
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:53,852
just in case.

993
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:59,490
Don't let me disturb you.

994
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,492
You can take that later.

995
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,995
I know what it must be like

996
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,331
seeing each other
only once a week.

997
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,401
She seems quite nice.

998
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,270
Yes. She's very nice.

999
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,272
I'll just get you ready

1000
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,274
for your injection,
Mr. elkins.

1001
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:17,775
Oh, thank you, nurse.

1002
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:25,283
Hmm...

1003
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:26,551
Hmm...

1004
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,958
Would you like a banana?

1005
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:33,959
Oh...

1006
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,326
Thanks.

1007
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:38,930
Ta.

1008
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,375
Did--did
my mother come round?

1009
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,143
What?

1010
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:53,811
Oh! Yes.

1011
00:46:53,912 --> 00:46:55,213
Was everything all right?

1012
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,814
She seemed put out

1013
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:57,992
because I hadn't made the kids

1014
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,218
a cooked dinner.

1015
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,487
Ah, she's mad
about Sunday dinners.

1016
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:15,333
Young Phil's
missing you ever so.

1017
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:17,402
Is he?

1018
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,337
He must have woken up
early this morning.

1019
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:22,340
I could hear him
talking away to himself.

1020
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,343
He kept scolding you
for not coming home.

1021
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:26,945
Ah, bless him.

1022
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,315
Oh, I seem to have
only just got here.

1023
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:31,582
Don't hurry.

1024
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,187
Dirty beast.

1025
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:37,588
I'll get the sister

1026
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,058
to give you your
injection after tea.

1027
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,193
Tell her to send the blonde.

1028
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:43,594
Don't forget to write.

1029
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,230
First thing,

1030
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:46,650
as soon as they've
gone to school.

1031
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,934
Give my love
to Phil and Shirley.

1032
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:49,935
I will.

1033
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:51,236
Bye-bye, love.

1034
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:52,837
Eat your eggs.

1035
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:53,838
I will.

1036
00:47:53,939 --> 00:47:55,240
Don't worry, love.

1037
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,842
I'll be all right in a minute.

1038
00:47:57,943 --> 00:47:59,244
I'll look after him.

1039
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:00,845
He hates me going.

1040
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:02,847
I'll soon cheer him up.

1041
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:04,182
Oh, thank you.

1042
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:16,561
You get dependent
on them coming, see?

1043
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:19,564
And it don't do to get
dependent on nobody.

1044
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:22,167
They bring
their fruit and flowers

1045
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,402
and tell you
how well you're looking.

1046
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:26,337
After about five minutes,

1047
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:30,041
they're dying for the bell
to go so they can leave.

1048
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:31,542
I know.
I've watched them.

1049
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,145
They're no sooner out the door

1050
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,148
than they say,
"did you see old Ned?

1051
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,549
"Didn't he look rough?

1052
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,551
"Keep them insurance
policies dusted.

1053
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,154
Don't throw
that black hat away."

1054
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,290
I've heard 'em.

1055
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,069
Mr. elkins?

1056
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:59,470
Oh, hello, nurse.

1057
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,472
You should be in bed.

1058
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,008
I couldn't sleep.

1059
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:04,342
I come down

1060
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,977
and made meself a cup of tea.

1061
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,378
You're not supposed to.

1062
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:09,380
I've been doing
things all my life

1063
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,982
I'm not supposed to.

1064
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:12,317
You know what?

1065
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:14,119
I had a horrible nightmare.

1066
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:16,521
You must have had
too much supper.

1067
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:17,989
No, serious.

1068
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:20,525
I dreamt the hydrogen
bomb had fallen

1069
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,527
and I didn't get killed.

1070
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:26,531
But I got some of that dust
on me shoulder, see?

1071
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:28,966
So I rushes in this house,

1072
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:30,335
shuts the door,

1073
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,403
and who should be there
but little Malcolm.

1074
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:33,404
Who?

1075
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,106
Hey? Oh, yeah.

1076
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:38,109
It's this kid I used to know.

1077
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,510
And then I realized

1078
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,680
that this--
this dust on me,

1079
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,715
this poison I picked up,

1080
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,119
will kill him.

1081
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:49,320
And I was taking it to him.

1082
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,722
I was taking death to him.

1083
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,325
But what could I do?

1084
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:55,436
I had to save me bleeding self,

1085
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,961
didn't I?

1086
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:59,530
Didn't half make me
feel rough, though.

1087
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,732
I suppose it would make sense

1088
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,268
to a psychiatrist.

1089
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:05,270
I wish just for once

1090
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,273
I could do something
good in me dreams.

1091
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:10,275
It wouldn't cost me anything,

1092
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,278
and I'd get a great deal
of satisfaction out of it.

1093
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:15,280
Just goes to show you,

1094
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,249
they got you when you're
awake and asleep.

1095
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,318
You'll be leaving
here next month.

1096
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,354
Yeah. I'll be glad
to get back to London.

1097
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:25,690
It won't be the same
without you around here.

1098
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:29,060
I ain't gone yet, girl.

1099
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:32,997
Would you like me

1100
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:35,400
to give you something
to make you sleep?

1101
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,001
There's a good idea.

1102
00:50:37,102 --> 00:50:38,002
All right.

1103
00:50:38,103 --> 00:50:40,538
Come with me.

1104
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,674
Marvelous what you can get
on the national health,

1105
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,143
isn't it?

1106
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,413
Goodbye, Mr. elkins.

1107
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:50,014
Goodbye,
Mrs. clamacraft.

1108
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:51,416
Bye-bye, love.

1109
00:50:58,589 --> 00:50:59,629
You know something, Harry?

1110
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,292
What?

1111
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,361
These visiting days
ain't doing you any good.

1112
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,029
How do you mean?

1113
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,530
It takes you a week
to get over one.

1114
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:09,033
If you're not careful,

1115
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:11,436
you'll leave here
in your wooden suit.

1116
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,804
That's all I live for,
to see her.

1117
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,807
You got to live for
yourself, not for others.

1118
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,810
You'd have to do without her
if she got killed.

1119
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,412
Don't talk like that.

1120
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:22,813
All I'm saying is,

1121
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,716
it don't do

1122
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,494
to get attached to nobody
like that in this life.

1123
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,387
What you don't
understand--

1124
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:30,821
yeah?

1125
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:31,789
What you
don't understand--

1126
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:32,790
what?

1127
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,625
What?

1128
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:36,827
Is the bond between
husband and wife.

1129
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,830
What I do understand
is human bleedin' nature.

1130
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,832
Here. How do you know

1131
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,569
your missus ain't
got a geezer outside?

1132
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:47,172
Say another word
about my wife--

1133
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:48,573
Harry! Harry! Harry!

1134
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:50,575
Harry, don't get aeriated.

1135
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:53,511
Harry. Here, sit quiet.

1136
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,416
Here, have a fag.

1137
00:51:58,516 --> 00:51:59,817
The doc says

1138
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:02,453
I'm not to smoke
more than five a day.

1139
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:03,854
Take no notice of him.

1140
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,456
No, all I meant was,

1141
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:06,857
with a bird,

1142
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,859
you can never tell
where it's been

1143
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,461
or what it's done.

1144
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,862
Would you mind saying "she"?

1145
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,831
You're talking about my wife.

1146
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:16,434
She or it, they're all birds.

1147
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:18,836
What you got to do, Harry,

1148
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:20,838
is start living for yourself,

1149
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,440
like I do.

1150
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,842
They won't keep me here long.

1151
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,445
But, Alfie, I miss the kids,

1152
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:28,779
especially the youngest.

1153
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,382
Now, just listen to me, Harry.

1154
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,783
Listen to me for a minute.

1155
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,419
Supposing tonight
you was to snuff it,

1156
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,256
know what I mean?

1157
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:39,257
You're rotten--

1158
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:40,658
no, just supposing.

1159
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,660
That's it, have a giggle.

1160
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,529
That's all life is, a giggle.

1161
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:47,532
Say your old woman
picks up with a bloke

1162
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,133
and brings him home.

1163
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:50,568
Not Lily. She wouldn't.

1164
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,569
Why not?

1165
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,170
She ain't bad.

1166
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,573
She got
a fair little figure--

1167
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,841
not my type, but still...

1168
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:57,842
Anyway, she introduces
this bloke

1169
00:52:57,942 --> 00:52:59,444
as uncle bill.

1170
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:01,446
Your kids would get
a big kick out of it.

1171
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,248
Not young Phil.
He wouldn't.

1172
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:04,582
He'd be the first,

1173
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,451
specially if
uncle bill brought toys.

1174
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:08,453
He wouldn't buy Phil with toys.

1175
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:10,455
Next thing, your missus
tells the neighbors

1176
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:11,856
the kids need a dad.

1177
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:13,624
She'll blame it on the kids.

1178
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:15,626
What are you getting at?

1179
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:17,295
I only want you to see the truth

1180
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:20,231
and start getting better.

1181
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:23,234
For the first month
after you're gone,

1182
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:24,635
your wife and kids

1183
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:27,238
might take flowers
to the cemetery.

1184
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:28,639
But once she's married

1185
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:31,409
and the kids
call uncle bill "dad,"

1186
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,811
your grave will become
a mass of weeds.

1187
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,813
If you came home
six months later,

1188
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:37,282
your kids would ask uncle bill,

1189
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:38,483
"dad, who is it?"

1190
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:39,884
If you don't stop,

1191
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:41,886
I'll knock your bloody head in!

1192
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:44,822
Harry, all I want is
for you to see life,

1193
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:46,424
see what it is

1194
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:48,759
and what it does to you.

1195
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:55,566
I--I never wanted
to hurt you, Harry.

1196
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:58,235
I never want to hurt anybody.

1197
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,240
No. I suppose not.

1198
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:05,743
But you do, Alfie.

1199
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:07,378
But you do.

1200
00:54:13,518 --> 00:54:15,586
Want a game of draughts?

1201
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:19,357
Yeah, all right.

1202
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:20,958
Come on.

1203
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:31,369
Alfie!

1204
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,770
Great.

1205
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,372
Alfie, just like old times.

1206
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:35,773
How are you doing?

1207
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:37,375
I'm all right, all right.

1208
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:38,776
I feel all right.

1209
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:41,379
I've got a gaff
lined up for you.

1210
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:42,689
I'm not used to all this noise.

1211
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:45,015
Come on.

1212
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,420
I've had six months
of peace and quiet.

1213
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,821
I'd be dead scared

1214
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:53,424
to take a car
through the streets.

1215
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:55,426
I got just the job
for you, then--

1216
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:57,428
all the fresh air you want.

1217
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:59,296
Street photography.
Doing it meself now.

1218
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:00,631
Where?

1219
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:02,032
Up at tower hill.

1220
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,610
Tons of tourists.
Chat the birds up easy.

1221
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,436
They're asking for it
half the time.

1222
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:06,837
Nothing to it--

1223
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:08,081
"hold it, lady.
More to the left."

1224
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:09,707
Three for 12 and a Tanner.

1225
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:15,813
He's a nice gentleman.

1226
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:19,417
You can have it on your own
if you don't like him, love.

1227
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,752
You got film in that camera?

1228
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:23,421
Are you loaded?

1229
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:24,422
Yeah.

1230
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:25,756
Oh, good morning.

1231
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,367
Come on, lady.

1232
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:38,736
Give us a great big smile.

1233
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:40,905
Here you are, sir.

1234
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,640
Not today.

1235
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,509
I don't want
my photograph taken.

1236
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:45,643
I can't blame you.

1237
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,645
What about the young lady?

1238
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:49,046
Nor does she.

1239
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:52,049
What about it?
One on your own?

1240
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:53,350
All right.
I think I will.

1241
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:54,351
Vacationing?

1242
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:55,352
No.

1243
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:56,353
Immigrant?

1244
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:57,788
In a way.

1245
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:58,789
Married?

1246
00:55:58,889 --> 00:55:59,790
Sometimes.

1247
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,791
Now?

1248
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:02,092
No. Not now.

1249
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,561
How do you want me?

1250
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,830
I got two positions--

1251
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,899
straight up or sideways,
depending on your nationality.

1252
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:11,035
I'll have you against the ships.

1253
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:12,503
All right.

1254
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:15,740
I've always been partial
to the Navy.

1255
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,342
Now, you look
a real treat there.

1256
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:20,745
We've no time to waste here.

1257
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:23,481
We got a fast film in today.

1258
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:24,882
Allow me, madam.

1259
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:27,785
He's getting a bit
choked up, isn't he?

1260
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,487
Don't let it worry you.

1261
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:30,921
It doesn't.

1262
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,758
It doesn't seem
to worry you either.

1263
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:36,561
I never let any man worry me.

1264
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:38,563
I see what you mean.

1265
00:56:38,663 --> 00:56:39,964
Now, that's lovely.

1266
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,566
Can you hold it?

1267
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,033
I'll do my best, young man.

1268
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,535
Put a jerk in it.

1269
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:46,671
I'll put a jerk in you.
Hold it.

1270
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:49,125
Lovely. That's
a real beauty.

1271
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:51,476
Now the close-up.
Lick your lips.

1272
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,779
Strewth.

1273
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:56,747
Now watch the Dickie bird.

1274
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:02,987
Now what's your address?

1275
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,890
And your telephone number?

1276
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:11,796
That's three of each.

1277
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:14,532
Be 15 shillings, sir.

1278
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,534
Haven't you got any change?

1279
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:17,935
No, I haven't.

1280
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:20,538
I'll have to go look for some.

1281
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:21,906
Keep the bloody change.

1282
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:27,545
'Ello! How about
a little souvenir?

1283
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,547
You can have an enlargement
for 4 and 6, sir.

1284
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:35,653
I got just the job
for you, Nat says.

1285
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:36,787
Plenty of fresh air.

1286
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:38,055
Know what?

1287
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:41,058
I got the flu twice
in six weeks.

1288
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,661
I went back to
the hire-car lark...

1289
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:45,162
With the, uh, rolls here.

1290
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,902
It's very nice
of you to come, Alfie.

1291
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,504
Wasn't it, lil?

1292
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:55,005
Yes, it was.

1293
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:56,974
If I'd known you'd be here,

1294
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:57,975
I wouldn't have come.

1295
00:57:58,075 --> 00:57:59,977
I didn't mean that.

1296
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:02,246
Of course not.

1297
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:04,982
She looks real tired,

1298
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:07,051
don't you think so, Alfie?

1299
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,452
I'm all right.

1300
00:58:08,553 --> 00:58:10,855
You got to think about yourself.

1301
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:12,857
Otherwise, you'll never
get out of here.

1302
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:14,792
Yeah, but...

1303
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:17,862
Can you give her
a lift in your car?

1304
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:19,997
Oh, Harry, please, no.

1305
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:23,000
It's a long way
for her by train.

1306
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,002
Yeah. I'll
take her back.

1307
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:26,604
It's a pleasure.

1308
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:29,006
He'll take you back.

1309
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,841
She didn't want to come,

1310
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:32,476
and I didn't want to take her.

1311
00:58:32,577 --> 00:58:35,145
We both agreed,
to please Harry, see?

1312
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,815
Looks real ribby though,
don't she?

1313
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,151
To brighten her up,

1314
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,487
I'm taking her a roundabout way,

1315
00:58:43,588 --> 00:58:44,868
to show her
a bit of the scenery.

1316
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:48,893
Well, you can only try,
can't you?

1317
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:54,164
How would you like
a nice cup of tea?

1318
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,000
I don't want to be any trouble.

1319
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,768
That's all right.

1320
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,606
One thing about driving a rolls,

1321
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:03,974
they're pleased
to see you anywhere.

1322
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:17,588
Know what?

1323
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:20,591
When she smiles
that little smile of hers,

1324
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:22,259
I'm quite touched by it.

1325
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:25,663
Yeah, now I look at her,

1326
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:28,599
she ain't so ugly after all.

1327
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,582
It must be hard
on you, girl--

1328
01:00:18,683 --> 01:00:20,584
old Harry being away so long.

1329
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:22,987
Still, I'll say this for him,

1330
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:24,588
he could hardly wait

1331
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:29,259
for those visiting
days to come round.

1332
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,129
Don't worry about him, Lily.

1333
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:34,164
He'll be home soon.

1334
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,869
Of course he will.

1335
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,971
Cheer up.

1336
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:08,766
Well, what I'm going to do,
old Harry will never know.

1337
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:10,768
And even if he did,

1338
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:14,004
he shouldn't begrudge me--
nor her, come to that.

1339
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:17,207
And it will round off
the tea nicely.

1340
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:54,678
I don't know what
you must think of me.

1341
01:01:54,779 --> 01:01:57,347
I bet you ain't been
with many blokes

1342
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:58,783
besides Harry.

1343
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,755
I haven't been with anyone.

1344
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:44,094
Where you going, love?

1345
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:45,362
London.

1346
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:46,822
It's a big place
for a little girl.

1347
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:49,033
Hop in.

1348
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,916
Hello, frank.

1349
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:07,918
What do you want to eat?

1350
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:09,319
I'm not hungry.

1351
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:10,921
Just a cup of tea, please.

1352
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,322
You must eat something.

1353
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:15,192
No, thank you.
Just tea with sugar.

1354
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:28,305
Hello!
Hey!

1355
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,174
How you doing?

1356
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,176
Watch your loading ropes, frank.

1357
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:33,177
They look a bit dodgey.

1358
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:35,312
Ta.

1359
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,914
What's the fancy dress for?

1360
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:38,916
Got a rolls outside, don't I?

1361
01:03:39,016 --> 01:03:40,317
You're almost a stranger, Alfie.

1362
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,919
Why didn't you turn up?

1363
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:43,921
Sorry, darlin'.
I couldn't make it.

1364
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:45,322
Uh, a small tea

1365
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:48,192
and a slice of
buttered toast, please.

1366
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:51,929
You won't get far
on cups of tea.

1367
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:53,830
I'll be all right.

1368
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:55,232
Who's the mystery?

1369
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,234
That one, frank brought in.

1370
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,836
You want to watch it, Alfie.

1371
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:00,971
That's frank's bird.

1372
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:02,506
It's not my type, anyway.

1373
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:04,541
I'll just go check those ropes,

1374
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,143
see they're all right.

1375
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:07,611
You O.K.?

1376
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:13,350
A bit dead in here
though, isn't it?

1377
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,120
I think I'll have a tune.

1378
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,937
They ain't half
got some old ones,

1379
01:04:33,037 --> 01:04:34,371
ain't they?

1380
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:35,505
Yes.

1381
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,174
Did you come in with frank?

1382
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:39,109
Yes. Why?

1383
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,079
He's a good bloke,
frank. Good mate.

1384
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,547
Yes, he seems nice.

1385
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:47,417
Yeah. He'd share his
last cigarette with ya.

1386
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:49,019
Very good-hearted
is frank.

1387
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,420
You know what?

1388
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,122
He'll even share his birds

1389
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,457
with his mates.

1390
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:55,859
One bloke told me

1391
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,327
he'll even lend you his wife...

1392
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:02,166
Like the Eskimos do.

1393
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:04,201
I wouldn't fancy that.

1394
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:07,137
Well, I mean, she's
so bad-tempered.

1395
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,539
I didn't think he was married.

1396
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,541
He's got at least one wife.

1397
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,510
Being a long-distance
lorry driver,

1398
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:16,113
he's away from home
every other night.

1399
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:17,514
Funny, some blokes, aren't they?

1400
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:19,349
I wouldn't like
anything like that--

1401
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:20,550
sharing a girl--

1402
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:21,551
would you?

1403
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:23,087
No.

1404
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:25,489
Where are you making for?

1405
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,224
Well, London.

1406
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:28,892
Any particular place?

1407
01:05:28,993 --> 01:05:30,394
Not really.

1408
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:32,997
I'd like to get a room
and a job, if I could.

1409
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:34,417
Here. I might be
able to help you.

1410
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:37,367
I know the personnel officer

1411
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,436
of a big toffee factory.

1412
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:42,039
Could I see you in London, then?

1413
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,174
See me in London?
I could take you there.

1414
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,442
But I'm--

1415
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:46,977
I've got a rolls
Royce out there,

1416
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,445
radio, heater--
the lot.

1417
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:52,049
But I shall have to tell
that man frank first.

1418
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:53,450
Can't risk that.

1419
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,451
He'll knock your block off.

1420
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:55,452
Mine, too.

1421
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,621
See that door there?

1422
01:05:57,721 --> 01:06:00,190
Well, 50 yards down the road

1423
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,092
is a telephone kiosk.

1424
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:03,927
You wait for me there.

1425
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:05,329
I don't like doing that.

1426
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:07,931
You don't want to be
frightened of me.

1427
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:09,933
I ain't a wolf, you know.

1428
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:11,935
Go on, before he comes back.

1429
01:06:12,036 --> 01:06:13,179
You don't want sharing, do ya?

1430
01:06:13,203 --> 01:06:15,072
No.

1431
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:16,473
No, course you don't.

1432
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,242
Go on, there you go.

1433
01:06:21,045 --> 01:06:23,347
Would you please tell
that driver I came in with

1434
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:25,949
that I'm sorry,
but I've had to go.

1435
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,351
I'll tell him.

1436
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:29,953
How much do I owe you, Flo?

1437
01:06:30,054 --> 01:06:31,355
1 and a penny.

1438
01:06:31,455 --> 01:06:32,956
You ain't going yet, Alfie?

1439
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:35,359
I'm in a hurry all of a sudden.

1440
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:36,960
What about your toast, then?

1441
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:38,362
Give it to frank.

1442
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:39,963
He could do with a slice.

1443
01:06:40,064 --> 01:06:40,964
See ya.

1444
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:42,332
See ya, Alfie.

1445
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:46,970
Did you see the way
he lapped it up?

1446
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:49,373
Can't see what they all
see in him.

1447
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:51,075
Frank will go raving mad

1448
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:52,176
when he comes back.

1449
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:53,443
Good.

1450
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:02,119
Sit back and enjoy
yourself, girl.

1451
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:05,389
Do your folks at home
know where you're going?

1452
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:07,391
I haven't got any.

1453
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:09,693
Oh, there must be somebody.

1454
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:14,098
I want to make a new
start in London.

1455
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:16,333
Well, I reckon you've
landed on your feet.

1456
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:18,034
You'll have a great
little life with me.

1457
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:22,172
♪ baby, I'm sorry...

1458
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:25,175
It ain't come up too bad,
has it?

1459
01:07:25,275 --> 01:07:28,178
All it needed was a good wash

1460
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:30,580
and a bit of care and attention.

1461
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,183
It's quite dainty.
You know what I mean?

1462
01:07:33,283 --> 01:07:36,586
Here. I no sooner
take a pair of socks off

1463
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,355
than it washes them.

1464
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:39,623
And it can cook, too.

1465
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,358
A bit limited on the menu.

1466
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:44,494
Mostly Lancashire hot-pot
and steak-and-kidney pie.

1467
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,363
They blow you out a bit.

1468
01:07:46,463 --> 01:07:49,032
But it does do
a marvelous egg custard.

1469
01:07:49,133 --> 01:07:50,573
I ain't never tasted
nothing like it.

1470
01:07:52,136 --> 01:07:53,803
And it's pretty fair
on the other and all.

1471
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,805
A bit on the shy side,

1472
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,575
but I find it makes
quite a change these days.

1473
01:07:58,675 --> 01:08:01,411
Oy, turn it down a bit, Annie.

1474
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:06,716
♪ Baby, I'm sorry

1475
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:09,719
♪ oh, baby,
I'm sorry... ♪

1476
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,655
It's in love, see?

1477
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:14,191
Now, when it listens
to that stuff,

1478
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,593
it daydreams that the bloke
who threw it over

1479
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:18,562
will one day want it back.

1480
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:20,164
What a bleedin' hope.

1481
01:08:20,264 --> 01:08:22,166
Just watch how it works.

1482
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:24,168
Scrub, scrub, scrub.

1483
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:26,470
It takes some birds like that.

1484
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,071
Not all of them.

1485
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:31,741
Can I get you
a cup of tea, Alfie?

1486
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,343
Take it easy.

1487
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,345
You always want to
be doing something.

1488
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:37,347
Here, I had
a bird once--

1489
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,349
a big, fat thing
it was--

1490
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,351
got crossed in love
or something.

1491
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,753
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

1492
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:47,391
She used to sit in front
of the fire all day long,

1493
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:49,393
smoking cigarettes
and drinking tea,

1494
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:51,795
till her shins
were burned red raw.

1495
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:53,463
"Get us a cup of tea,
bracken-shins,"

1496
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:55,799
I said to it one time.

1497
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:57,234
"What?" It said.
"You paralyzed?"

1498
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:58,335
I soon got rid of it.

1499
01:08:58,435 --> 01:08:59,569
Are you visiting your friend

1500
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:01,405
at the sanatorium?

1501
01:09:01,505 --> 01:09:02,839
Old Harry? Yeah.

1502
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:05,442
You fancy a ride
in the car, girl?

1503
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:07,444
I've some washing to do.

1504
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:08,845
You're always bleedin' washing.

1505
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:10,847
Why don't you take a rest?

1506
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:12,516
I feel better if
I'm doing something.

1507
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:14,751
If it makes ya feel better,

1508
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:16,386
I won't stop ya.

1509
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:17,787
Punishes itself, you see.

1510
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:21,225
That way, life can't
get at it the same.

1511
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:23,527
What time will you
be back, Alfie?

1512
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:25,529
When I go out that door,

1513
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:29,132
I don't know what day
I'll be back,

1514
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:30,534
let alone what time.

1515
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:33,136
I'm what is called a free agent.

1516
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:34,304
Sorry.
I just thought

1517
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:35,539
I'd have your meal ready.

1518
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:37,140
Make a meal
that's always ready--

1519
01:09:37,241 --> 01:09:38,708
hash or stew or something.

1520
01:09:38,808 --> 01:09:40,744
I thought I'd do
something special.

1521
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,480
Get those boots for
me, will you, girl?

1522
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:48,785
See? Even she's
started asking me

1523
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,220
when I'll be back.

1524
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,788
Know what?
That little remark

1525
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:54,324
could be the writing
on the wall.

1526
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:58,262
Annie, when are you
going to start using

1527
01:09:58,362 --> 01:10:00,196
those gloves I bought you?

1528
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:01,598
You'll ruin your hands,

1529
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,600
what with all that
scrubbing and whatnot.

1530
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,235
They don't matter.

1531
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:07,504
They may not matter to you,

1532
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:08,638
but they matter to me.

1533
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,240
Nothing puts me off more

1534
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,409
than a woman getting hold of me

1535
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:13,910
with hard, horny mitts.

1536
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,912
You got pretty little fingers.

1537
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,382
They're like a child's.

1538
01:10:18,482 --> 01:10:20,917
Look after them for me.

1539
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,862
Sometimes, it gets
a dead, ghostified look

1540
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:35,265
come over its little face,

1541
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:37,200
as though it were
all sick inside

1542
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:38,668
with love or something

1543
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:41,204
and its poor bleedin' mind
was stumbling about,

1544
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:43,473
looking for a corner to rest in.

1545
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,509
Take the other night,
for instance.

1546
01:11:04,328 --> 01:11:06,663
After what we'd just
been through together,

1547
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,665
it made me really mad.

1548
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,668
After all, there's a time
and a place for everything.

1549
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,804
Even your thoughts
have a proper place.

1550
01:11:26,383 --> 01:11:28,785
Sorry, Alfie.

1551
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:32,456
Forget him, girl.

1552
01:11:32,556 --> 01:11:34,758
I'm here and in the flesh.

1553
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:42,532
Blimey, she looked dead guilty.

1554
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,669
Know what?
I was sorry I spoke.

1555
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:47,671
"Alfie," I says to meself,

1556
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:51,040
"she's as human
as you are."

1557
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:55,879
Well, I'll be off now, girl.

1558
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,482
Like to give me
a brush-down?

1559
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:02,677
Shall I say you'll be
back about 7:00, Alfie?

1560
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,422
Say what you like.

1561
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:07,557
Whether I'll be or not
is another matter.

1562
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,459
You have something ready.

1563
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:12,596
If I'm here, I'll eat it.
If I'm not, I won't.

1564
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,766
You know what, Annie?
You're a nice-looking girl,

1565
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:19,369
only you want to
brighten yourself up.

1566
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:20,770
Don't mope about depressed.

1567
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,772
You got to think of others.

1568
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:23,973
So long.

1569
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,743
Take care of yourself, Alfie.

1570
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:38,455
I didn't like leaving it
there on a Sunday,

1571
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:39,856
scrubbing away.

1572
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:42,792
But what could I do?
You know what I mean?

1573
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,761
I couldn't take it with me.

1574
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:02,712
Going up in the world, ain't I?

1575
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:05,081
Do you know
what the rents are here?

1576
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:06,716
15 quid a week.

1577
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:09,986
That's including
central heating, of course.

1578
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:21,064
You'll never guess
who I'm calling on.

1579
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:24,100
Well, I wouldn't have
believed it meself

1580
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,635
three months ago.

1581
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:30,574
I'm here, girl.

1582
01:13:30,674 --> 01:13:31,975
That's life, ain't it?

1583
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:34,578
You can never tell
what's round the corner.

1584
01:13:34,678 --> 01:13:35,979
Know what I mean?

1585
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:37,981
Down one minute, up the next.

1586
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:41,585
You drop a Tanner, look
around, what do you find?

1587
01:13:41,685 --> 01:13:43,119
Ruby!

1588
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:44,488
Hello, baby.

1589
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:47,657
Hold it! Gotcha.

1590
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:57,601
She's in lovely condition.

1591
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:00,804
Ooh...

1592
01:14:00,904 --> 01:14:03,406
Ooh! What are you
so impatient about?

1593
01:14:03,507 --> 01:14:04,741
What do you think?

1594
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:06,409
Don't kiss my ear.

1595
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:07,811
You know what it does to me.

1596
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:09,412
Come on, what about it?

1597
01:14:09,513 --> 01:14:11,781
Let's at least
have a drink first.

1598
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:13,182
Whiskey?

1599
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,719
You haven't got a beer,
light ale, or something?

1600
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:18,688
Yes, I've probably got
a beer on the ice.

1601
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:24,460
She gets all this lot
off income tax.

1602
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:25,862
Business expenses, see?

1603
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,463
She owns three hairdressers.

1604
01:14:27,564 --> 01:14:29,866
The thing I like about Ruby,

1605
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,467
she's a mature woman.

1606
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:33,469
When she gets hold of you,

1607
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:34,880
you can feel a lifetime
of experience

1608
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:35,939
in her fingers.

1609
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:38,508
I find I'm going in more

1610
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:39,943
for that sort of woman
these days.

1611
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:42,546
Here! Don't you dig
your nails in again,

1612
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:44,548
like you did
last Thursday night.

1613
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:46,950
I got scratches
all down me back.

1614
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,553
I may do more than
that to you today.

1615
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:50,954
Great long wheals they are.

1616
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:52,956
She dug her nails right in.

1617
01:14:53,056 --> 01:14:54,758
She's had two husbands.

1618
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:56,993
Both dead.

1619
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:02,031
And I've a good idea
what they died of.

1620
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:07,837
She don't keep asking
do you love her,

1621
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:09,238
like young birds do.

1622
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,840
She don't never mention love.

1623
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,241
She knows what she wants,

1624
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,177
and she's going to get it...

1625
01:15:14,277 --> 01:15:16,179
If there's any going.

1626
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:17,513
Cheers.

1627
01:15:17,614 --> 01:15:20,483
Cheers.

1628
01:15:20,584 --> 01:15:22,085
Alfie...

1629
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,687
Don't you ever think about

1630
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:25,889
bringing your girlfriends
flowers or candy?

1631
01:15:25,989 --> 01:15:27,891
Yeah, I often think about it,

1632
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:29,492
but I never do it,

1633
01:15:29,593 --> 01:15:31,494
not unless they're in hospital.

1634
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:34,898
Don't put your wet glass
on my polished table.

1635
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:37,701
You know, you're
getting bleedin' fussy.

1636
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:39,703
I'm not getting bleeding fussy.

1637
01:15:39,803 --> 01:15:41,204
Yes, you are.

1638
01:15:41,304 --> 01:15:43,539
I am not fussy!

1639
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:45,742
Hello.

1640
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:47,276
Ah!

1641
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,545
She's in beautiful condition.

1642
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,850
You're a little sexpot,
ain't ya?

1643
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,184
Am I?

1644
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,754
You're a little
lust-box, ain't ya?

1645
01:15:57,854 --> 01:15:59,155
My little lust-box.

1646
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:01,691
I might settle down with her.

1647
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,693
With a wife like Ruby,

1648
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:05,829
you wouldn't want
nothing on the side.

1649
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:07,063
You know what I mean?

1650
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:09,633
Ha ha ha!

1651
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:10,967
Bedroom.

1652
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:19,643
Here. Come and have
a look at this a minute.

1653
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:23,079
Great, ain't it?

1654
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:25,081
Have you caught the ceilings?

1655
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:28,818
Look at the size of that bath.

1656
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,219
King-size.

1657
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,021
It's a bit of a tight squeeze

1658
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:34,223
with the two of us in it,

1659
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,604
but you can have a lot of fun
splashing about and whatnot.

1660
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:42,031
Do you know
there have been times

1661
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:45,568
I felt lucky to get
out of that bath alive?

1682
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:01,811
Know what? I got this bird
Annie from up north

1683
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:03,913
staying at my pad.

1684
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,314
She can't half cook.

1685
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:06,916
What's bleedin' cooking

1686
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,885
got to do with it?

1687
01:18:08,985 --> 01:18:10,253

if he don't come
home for meals, eh?

1689
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:14,791
No. She does some
handsome nosh-ups--

1690
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:17,193
steak-and-kidney pie,
Lancashire hot-pot.

1691
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,928
I love her cooking, I do.

1692
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,668
I thought you was
looking a bit blown out.

1693
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,967
What do you mean, blown out?

1694
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:25,368
It's just the appearance,

1695
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:27,236
you see, Alfie.

1696
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:28,704
What appearance?

1697
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:30,706
Well, you look all puffed up,

1698
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:31,707
blown out,

1699
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:34,677
sort of ponsified.

1700
01:18:34,778 --> 01:18:36,079
Ponsified?

1701
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:38,681
I've never felt fitter
in all my life.

1702
01:18:38,782 --> 01:18:40,149

1704
01:18:41,785 --> 01:18:43,686
No, you just look
different, that's all,

1705
01:18:43,787 --> 01:18:45,354
don't he?

1706
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,723
What's bleedin'
different about me?

1707
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:49,125
That bird Annie of yours,

1708
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,127
she's putting a block on you,

1709

and you can't see it.

1710
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:54,730
Looks that way to me, mate.

1711
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,132
She's only looking after me.

1712
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,733
Looking after you?

1713
01:18:57,834 --> 01:18:59,769
In 12 months, you won't
recognize yourself.

1714
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:02,205

Oh, yeah.
What about it?

1726

You've got an awful black eye.

1758
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,723
Blimey! He's injured
me for life!

1759
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:31,447
Where's that steak you bought?

1760
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:34,950
I've made you steak-
and-kidney pie with it.

1761
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:36,252
I'm fed up
with hot-pots

1762
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:37,953
and steak-and-kidney
pies.

1763
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:40,356
Can't we have something
out of a can for a change?

1764
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:41,957
Corned beef or spam?

1765
01:22:42,058 --> 01:22:45,128
Handsome grub, that was.

1766
01:22:45,228 --> 01:22:48,131
You said you liked my
steak-and-kidney pies.

1767
01:22:48,231 --> 01:22:51,400
If I get that lot on top
of a skinful of beer,

1768
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,003
I'll hardly be able to
draw me bleedin' breath.

1769
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:56,005
I'll feel full up,
blown out, ponsified.

1770
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:57,482
You always said you
loved that feeling

1771
01:22:57,506 --> 01:22:58,974
of being really full.

1772
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:01,377
What I loved once
and what I love now

1773
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:02,978
are two different things.

1774
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:04,380
And where's
my button-down shirt?

1775
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,449
Your blue one?
In the drawer.

1776
01:23:06,549 --> 01:23:08,551
No, the pink one.

1777
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:11,154
I washed it.
It'll soon be dry.

1778
01:23:11,254 --> 01:23:13,556
I only wore it a couple hours.

1779
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:15,491
I thought it would feel fresher.

1780
01:23:15,591 --> 01:23:18,494
You only wash to fill in
your bleedin' time.

1781
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:20,096
Why should I?

1782
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:22,531
To get him out of your mind.

1783
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:25,134
To get who out of me mind?

1784
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:27,536
That bleedin' Tony you
write about in your diary.

1785
01:23:27,636 --> 01:23:30,539
Alfie, have you been in my bag

1786
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,541
and read my diary?

1787
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:33,976
Why shouldn't I?

1788
01:23:34,077 --> 01:23:35,378
You shouldn't

1789
01:23:35,478 --> 01:23:37,380
because them's
me secret thoughts.

1790
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,982
You ain't entitled
to secret thoughts,

1791
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:41,384
not living with me.

1792
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:43,004
Everyone's entitled
to secret thoughts.

1793
01:23:43,086 --> 01:23:44,329
Then you shouldn't
write them down

1794
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:45,988
and let me see them.

1795
01:23:46,089 --> 01:23:48,291
I only wrote them
to get them out of me.

1796
01:23:48,391 --> 01:23:51,660
Here's what I think of you,
your secret thoughts,

1797
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,230
and your bleedin'
steak-and-kidney pie!

1798
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,051
And don't take nothing

1799
01:24:16,152 --> 01:24:18,053
that don't belong to you either.

1800
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:38,307
Don't let your custard spoil.

1801
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,176
It's in the oven.

1802
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,197
Annie?

1803
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:04,233
Annie!

1804
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,602
Come back!
I didn't mean it!

1805
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,205
Annie!

1806
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:22,485
Annie!

1807
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:07,663
Come in.

1808
01:26:13,269 --> 01:26:15,137
You're a bit early, girl.

1809
01:26:15,238 --> 01:26:17,273
I didn't want to be late.

1810
01:26:17,373 --> 01:26:18,674
Is he coming?

1811
01:26:18,774 --> 01:26:20,343
Yeah, about 2:00 he
said he'd be here.

1812
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:24,280
Here, give us your bag.

1813
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:29,718
Blimey, your hands
ain't half cold.

1814
01:26:29,818 --> 01:26:32,321
You ain't worrying, are you?

1815
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:34,657
A bit.

1816
01:26:34,757 --> 01:26:37,693
Yeah. You're all
dark under the eyes.

1817
01:26:37,793 --> 01:26:39,695
I couldn't sleep last night.

1818
01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:40,696
Ah...

1819
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,865
Well...

1820
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:45,868
And, uh, you can
get ready for him

1821
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:49,171
when you want to.

1822
01:26:49,272 --> 01:26:51,340
Thanks.

1823
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,356
I've let meself in for
something this time,

1824
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:08,924
all right.

1825
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:12,528
It was that day I took her
out to the river, see?

1826
01:27:12,628 --> 01:27:14,863
Right about three months
ago, it was.

1827
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:17,199
That was something I thought
I got for nothing.

1828
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,202
It don't never work out
that way, does it?

1829
01:27:20,303 --> 01:27:23,806
So I agrees to help her
and lay it all on.

1830
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:26,275
It was the least
I could do--

1831
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:29,678
Knowing old Harry and all.

1832
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:31,480
See what I mean?

1833
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,981
Come in, mate.

1834
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,888
Well, here we are.

1835
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:42,891
What do you mean, here we are?

1836
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:45,894
I mean you've come
to the right place.

1837
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:47,896
This is the young lady

1838
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:50,333
I talked to you about
on the phone.

1839
01:27:50,433 --> 01:27:51,734
Pleased to meet you.

1840
01:27:51,834 --> 01:27:54,337
Ain't you got
your gear with you?

1841
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:55,738
Don't ask questions.

1842
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:58,341
Oh, sorry. Right,
well, this is the room

1843
01:27:58,441 --> 01:28:00,743
where you can examine
this young lady.

1844
01:28:00,843 --> 01:28:02,478
And why should I examine
this young lady?

1845
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:05,748
Well, you've got to, ain't you,

1846
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:06,749
before you do it?

1847
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:08,283
Before I do what?

1848
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:10,686
Do what you come to do.

1849
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,287
Be quiet, Alfie.

1850
01:28:12,388 --> 01:28:13,288
There must be some mistake.

1851
01:28:13,389 --> 01:28:14,723
You are the bloke--

1852
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:17,259
the gentleman I talked to
last Thursday, ain't you?

1853
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,661
Alfie, please be quiet.

1854
01:28:18,761 --> 01:28:19,995
Don't worry, my dear.

1855
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,538
Now I must have a serious talk

1856
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:30,539
with you both.

1857
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:31,907
Are you two married?

1858
01:28:32,007 --> 01:28:33,509
Us two married?

1859
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:35,511
Blimey!
Do we look it?

1860
01:28:35,611 --> 01:28:38,514
No. I mean,
she's a married woman,

1861
01:28:38,614 --> 01:28:40,683
but I'm a single man.

1862
01:28:40,783 --> 01:28:42,361
Is there any chance
of you getting married

1863
01:28:42,385 --> 01:28:43,752
in the near future?

1864
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:46,755
I doubt that.
What do you say, Lily?

1865
01:28:46,855 --> 01:28:48,824
But you are the putative father.

1866
01:28:48,924 --> 01:28:50,058
The what?

1867
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,561
Me?

1868
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:54,296
I'm nothing. I'm just obliging
a friend.

1869
01:28:54,397 --> 01:28:55,698
Well, that's unusual.

1870
01:28:55,798 --> 01:28:57,299
It's very unusual.

1871
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:01,336
You are the man who...
Is going to help me?

1872
01:29:01,437 --> 01:29:03,739
Her old man's
in a sanatorium, see?

1873
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:06,341
She's had a moral lapse.
See what I mean?

1874
01:29:06,442 --> 01:29:08,744
I'm not quite sure that I do.

1875
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,746
It will never happen again.

1876
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,748
The only reason
she needs helping

1877
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:15,317
is that her marriage
would look very dodgey

1878
01:29:15,418 --> 01:29:17,095
if her husband come out
at this stage of the game.

1879
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:19,622
She got three other
kids as well.

1880
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:21,624
Where do you fit in?

1881
01:29:21,724 --> 01:29:23,626
She had no place to go.

1882
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:25,027
That's most altruistic.

1883
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:27,029
I, uh, hope you both...

1884
01:29:27,129 --> 01:29:32,501
Appreciate the seriousness
of this case.

1885
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:35,571
To terminate a pregnancy
after more than 28 days

1886
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:37,540
is a criminal offense

1887
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:41,544
punishable in a court of law
with seven years' jail.

1888
01:29:41,644 --> 01:29:43,045
Do you understand this?

1889
01:29:46,582 --> 01:29:48,016
Yeah.

1890
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:49,685
Not only that,

1891
01:29:49,785 --> 01:29:52,688
but it's a crime
against the unborn child.

1892
01:29:52,788 --> 01:29:57,826
It's a course never to be
embarked upon... Lightly.

1893
01:29:57,926 --> 01:29:59,428
Therefore I must ask you

1894
01:29:59,528 --> 01:30:01,430
to consider all
the circumstances thoroughly

1895
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,832
before you go through
with your decision,

1896
01:30:03,932 --> 01:30:08,637
since afterwards it will be too
late to change your mind.

1897
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:12,508
Have you given the matter
your fullest consideration?

1898
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,510
What do you say, Lily?

1899
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:15,911
I've no way out.

1900
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:18,914
And you've decided
to go through with it?

1901
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:20,516
Yes, I must.

1902
01:30:20,616 --> 01:30:23,519
Then I might be able
to help you.

1903
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:24,620
Thank you.

1904
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,922
Um... Yes. Oh, yes--

1905
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:28,924
have you got the money?

1906
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,926
Eh? Oh, yeah,
the money.

1907
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:32,928
The young lady got it.

1908
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:34,930
It will be 30 pounds.

1909
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:37,533
25. That was the
figure we discussed.

1910
01:30:37,633 --> 01:30:38,934
Very well then, 25.

1911
01:30:46,509 --> 01:30:48,577
Right. Very well.

1912
01:30:48,677 --> 01:30:50,646
Um, right, young lady.
If you'd care to follow me.

1913
01:30:50,746 --> 01:30:52,080
I'll need some boiling water.

1914
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:54,950
Oh, yeah, the kettle's
on the stove in there.

1915
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,619
Good.

1916
01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:20,543
I hate anything like this.

1917
01:31:21,677 --> 01:31:22,978
My understanding of women

1918
01:31:23,078 --> 01:31:25,981
only goes as far
as the pleasure.

1919
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:28,584
When it comes to the pain,

1920
01:31:28,684 --> 01:31:32,588
I'm like every other bloke.
I don't want to know.

1921
01:31:35,591 --> 01:31:36,759
Have you done?

1922
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:38,761
Almost everything I can do.

1923
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:41,163
Can she go home now, then?

1924
01:31:41,263 --> 01:31:43,165
Good lord, no.
Don't you understand?

1925
01:31:43,265 --> 01:31:45,901
It's only been induced.
It hasn't happened yet.

1926
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,502
That comes later.

1927
01:31:47,603 --> 01:31:49,504
If her temperature
rises rapidly,

1928
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:52,507
give her two of these.
I'll leave you six.

1929
01:31:52,608 --> 01:31:53,909
How will I know?

1930
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:56,912
Well, uh, if she
starts to sweat,

1931
01:31:57,012 --> 01:32:00,182
give her two.

1932
01:32:00,282 --> 01:32:02,184
Here, mate, don't you think

1933
01:32:02,284 --> 01:32:03,828
you ought to stay
and see the job through,

1934
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,188
considering how much
you've been paid?

1935
01:32:06,288 --> 01:32:08,657
Two if she sweats.

1936
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:31,580
How you feeling, girl?

1937
01:32:35,117 --> 01:32:39,021
He gave me these tablets
to give to you.

1938
01:32:42,124 --> 01:32:44,960
Take two if your
temperature goes up.

1939
01:32:50,633 --> 01:32:52,601
You do look old, girl.

1940
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:59,274
He got his money
easy... Eh?

1941
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,183
Ohh!

1942
01:33:08,283 --> 01:33:09,685
Not too loud.

1943
01:33:09,785 --> 01:33:11,086
My landlady will hear.

1944
01:33:11,186 --> 01:33:12,688
I can't help it!

1945
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:15,157
The pain!

1946
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:16,158
Lily.

1947
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:17,760
God, this pain!

1948
01:33:19,695 --> 01:33:21,563
I'm sorry, Lily.
I'm--I'm sorry.

1949
01:33:21,664 --> 01:33:23,231
I had to do it.

1950
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:24,700
If my landlady heard,

1951
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,101
she'd have the ambulance here,

1952
01:33:26,201 --> 01:33:27,569
doctors, police, the lot.

1953
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:28,704
Then all this

1954
01:33:28,804 --> 01:33:29,972
would have been for nothing.

1955
01:33:30,072 --> 01:33:31,573
You see what I mean?

1956
01:33:31,674 --> 01:33:34,576
That's why I had to do it.

1957
01:33:34,677 --> 01:33:36,779
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1958
01:33:36,879 --> 01:33:37,980
Lily, Lily.

1959
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,950
Shh, shh, Lily, Lily, Lily.

1960
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:46,855
Lily, Lily, Lily,
shh... Shh.

1961
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:52,695
Shh... Shh... Shh.

1962
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:56,131
Shh... Shh, shh.

1963
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:58,100
Lily, Lily.

1964
01:34:06,074 --> 01:34:09,011
Is there something
I can get you, Lily?

1965
01:34:09,111 --> 01:34:10,278
Eh?

1966
01:34:11,714 --> 01:34:14,149
Would you like a cup of tea?

1967
01:34:18,854 --> 01:34:20,322
No. You go.

1968
01:34:21,824 --> 01:34:23,692
I'm better on my own.

1969
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:27,329
There's nothing you can do.

1970
01:34:28,797 --> 01:34:30,966
You'll be all right, will you?

1971
01:34:31,066 --> 01:34:32,768
Eh?

1972
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:39,374
Sure you'll be all right?

1973
01:34:49,752 --> 01:34:52,054
I know it don't look nice,

1974
01:34:52,154 --> 01:34:54,289
going off and leaving her.

1975
01:34:54,389 --> 01:34:56,291
But what do look nice

1976
01:34:56,391 --> 01:34:59,427
when you get close up to it, eh?

1977
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,085
Here, come on.

1978
01:35:57,185 --> 01:35:58,486
Oh, you naughty boy.

1979
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:01,223
You're keeping everyone waiting.

1980
01:36:15,237 --> 01:36:17,139
Suzanne Elizabeth,
I baptize thee

1981
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:19,741
in the name of the father

1982
01:36:19,842 --> 01:36:21,143
and of the son

1983
01:36:21,243 --> 01:36:23,178
and of the holy ghost.
Amen.

1984
01:36:29,918 --> 01:36:31,820
And now we join together

1985
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,156
in the family prayer
of Christians.

1986
01:36:34,256 --> 01:36:36,959
Our father, which art in heaven,

1987
01:36:37,059 --> 01:36:38,827
hallowed be thy name,

1988
01:36:38,927 --> 01:36:40,228
thy kingdom come,

1989
01:36:40,328 --> 01:36:41,864
thy will be done

1990
01:36:41,964 --> 01:36:43,798
on earth as it is in heaven.

1991
01:37:12,427 --> 01:37:14,897
Who's daddy's best boy, eh?

1992
01:37:14,997 --> 01:37:17,099
Who's daddy's best boy?

1993
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,902
Who's the best boy in the world?

1994
01:37:48,931 --> 01:37:50,032
Lily...

1995
01:37:55,337 --> 01:37:56,972
Is it all over?

1996
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:00,442
Yes.

1997
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:06,381
I'll be ready to go in a minute.

1998
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:09,384
There's no hurry,
girl. No hurry.

1999
01:38:15,557 --> 01:38:16,992
Don't.

2000
01:38:19,661 --> 01:38:20,661
Eh?

2001
01:38:20,695 --> 01:38:22,297
Don't go in there.

2002
01:39:56,291 --> 01:40:00,195
I could have dropped
on the spot with the shock.

2003
01:40:00,295 --> 01:40:03,198
All I was expecting
to see was...

2004
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:07,235
Well, come to think of it,

2005
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:10,772
I don't rightly know what
I was expecting to see.

2006
01:40:13,508 --> 01:40:18,012
Certainly not this
perfectly formed... Being.

2007
01:40:20,315 --> 01:40:22,617
I half expected it to cry out.

2008
01:40:22,717 --> 01:40:25,220
It didn't, of course.
It couldn't have done.

2009
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:28,223
It could never have had
any life in it.

2010
01:40:28,323 --> 01:40:31,226
I mean, not a proper
life of its own.

2011
01:40:31,326 --> 01:40:33,295
No, I suppose not.

2012
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:37,732
Still...

2013
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:43,438
It must have had
some life, of course.

2014
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:48,042
And as it lay there
so quiet, so still...

2015
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:51,446
It quite touched me.

2016
01:40:53,115 --> 01:40:55,617
And I started praying
or something,

2017
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:57,219
saying things like, uh,

2018
01:40:57,319 --> 01:40:58,679
"god help me"
and things like that,

2019
01:41:01,323 --> 01:41:03,525
and then I starts to cry.

2020
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:05,160
Straight out.

2021
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:09,431
The tears were running down
me face, all salty,

2022
01:41:09,531 --> 01:41:12,033
like I was a kid meself.

2023
01:41:12,134 --> 01:41:15,203
Crying for him, you mean, alf?

2024
01:41:15,303 --> 01:41:17,205
No, no, not for him.

2025
01:41:17,305 --> 01:41:19,674
He was past it.

2026
01:41:19,774 --> 01:41:22,477
For me bleedin' self.

2027
01:41:22,577 --> 01:41:26,481
It don't bring it home
to you what you are

2028
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:30,118
when you see a helpless
little thing like that

2029
01:41:30,218 --> 01:41:32,120
lying in your own hands.

2030
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:34,122
He'd have been quite perfect.

2031
01:41:34,222 --> 01:41:36,524
And I--I thought
to meself...

2032
01:41:38,226 --> 01:41:39,527
"You know what, Alfie?

2033
01:41:39,627 --> 01:41:41,529
"You know what you done?

2034
01:41:41,629 --> 01:41:43,798
You murdered him."

2035
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:48,270
Well, there's nothing

2036
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:51,673
you can do about it now, alf.

2037
01:41:51,773 --> 01:41:54,276
Will you lend me 25 quid, Nat?

2038
01:41:54,376 --> 01:41:55,677
Don't be bloody funny.

2039
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:58,280
That's all I've got
in the world.

2040
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,682
I'll give you this watch
as security.

2041
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:02,850
If I haven't paid you
back in two weeks,

2042
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:04,486
you can sell it.

2043
01:42:04,586 --> 01:42:06,421
I don't want no security.

2044
01:42:06,521 --> 01:42:07,689
Thanks very much, Nat.

2045
01:42:27,709 --> 01:42:29,911
Well... That's that.

2046
01:42:35,583 --> 01:42:37,219
You all ready?

2047
01:42:37,319 --> 01:42:39,554
Come on.
I'll run you home.

2048
01:42:41,689 --> 01:42:44,192
I'd sooner go on me own.

2049
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:45,593
You say that again,

2050
01:42:45,693 --> 01:42:47,662
you will go home on your own.

2051
01:42:47,762 --> 01:42:49,264
I want to.

2052
01:42:49,364 --> 01:42:50,665
O.K. By me.

2053
01:42:50,765 --> 01:42:52,267
There's a bus to Waterloo

2054
01:42:52,367 --> 01:42:54,669
or a green line all the way.

2055
01:42:54,769 --> 01:42:56,671
This is for little Phil.

2056
01:42:56,771 --> 01:42:57,672
Who?

2057
01:42:57,772 --> 01:42:59,274
Phil, your youngest,

2058
01:42:59,374 --> 01:43:00,675
the one that writes

2059
01:43:00,775 --> 01:43:01,676
all them squiggly letters.

2060
01:43:01,776 --> 01:43:03,278
What is it?

2061
01:43:03,378 --> 01:43:05,213
You want to see it?

2062
01:43:06,714 --> 01:43:09,617
I bought it a long,
long time ago...

2063
01:43:09,717 --> 01:43:12,620
For a little kid I used to know.

2064
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,188
Catch.

2065
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:26,601
Tell him it's from
his uncle Alfie.

2066
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:37,211
Come with me.

2067
01:43:37,312 --> 01:43:38,980
I'll take you home.

2068
01:44:19,321 --> 01:44:20,681
I'm definitely going
to settle down

2069
01:44:21,723 --> 01:44:23,224
with this Ruby.

2070
01:44:23,325 --> 01:44:25,560
I'm fed up
with being on the move.

2071
01:44:32,934 --> 01:44:34,469
You know, I find

2072
01:44:34,569 --> 01:44:37,405
I'm not stalking
these young birds anymore.

2073
01:44:43,878 --> 01:44:45,246
Hey, Ruby!

2074
01:44:45,347 --> 01:44:46,681
Where are you, girl?

2075
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:48,950
Alfie?

2076
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:51,719
Yeah, I thought
I'd give you a surprise.

2077
01:44:51,819 --> 01:44:53,321
I'll be right out.

2078
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:55,022
Uh, make yourself a drink.

2079
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:56,424
All right.

2080
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:05,467
Uh, I was sleeping.

2081
01:45:05,567 --> 01:45:07,669
I've got a headache.
I took a pill.

2082
01:45:07,769 --> 01:45:09,437
Oh, sorry.

2083
01:45:09,537 --> 01:45:11,873
You said you were
on a job today.

2084
01:45:11,973 --> 01:45:13,533
Yeah, but it fell through.
Want a drink?

2085
01:45:13,575 --> 01:45:15,410
No, thanks.

2086
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:16,811
Maybe you better go, darling.

2087
01:45:16,911 --> 01:45:18,813
I've got a splitting headache.

2088
01:45:18,913 --> 01:45:20,415
All right, then.

2089
01:45:20,515 --> 01:45:22,784
Better have these
now I've brought them.

2090
01:45:25,687 --> 01:45:27,989
Alfie, what a thing
for you to do.

2091
01:45:28,089 --> 01:45:29,591
I--I never thought

2092
01:45:29,691 --> 01:45:30,992
I'd live to see the day.

2093
01:45:31,092 --> 01:45:32,594
I like surprising a woman.

2094
01:45:32,694 --> 01:45:33,995
You certainly did that.

2095
01:45:34,095 --> 01:45:35,597
Look at the wrapper.

2096
01:45:35,697 --> 01:45:36,998
They're not off a barrow.

2097
01:45:37,098 --> 01:45:38,600
I can see that.

2098
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,001
Well, they're lovely.

2099
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:42,003
Really lovely.
Thank you.

2100
01:45:42,103 --> 01:45:43,414
I'll go. You take
an aspirin, girl.

2101
01:45:43,438 --> 01:45:44,439
I will.

2102
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:45,440
That's new.

2103
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:47,609
New, what?

2104
01:45:47,709 --> 01:45:50,044
That radio.
Where'd you get that?

2105
01:45:50,144 --> 01:45:52,046
I picked it up cheap.

2106
01:45:52,146 --> 01:45:53,648
You'll ring me tomorrow?

2107
01:45:53,748 --> 01:45:55,650
I'll--I'll be
all right then.

2108
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:57,051
I'll come around lunchtime.

2109
01:45:57,151 --> 01:45:58,653
We might have a session.

2110
01:45:58,753 --> 01:45:59,654
Why not?

2111
01:45:59,754 --> 01:46:00,655
Right.

2112
01:46:00,755 --> 01:46:02,023
See you.

2113
01:46:06,528 --> 01:46:07,662
Alfie.

2114
01:46:07,762 --> 01:46:09,631
Yeah?

2115
01:46:09,731 --> 01:46:11,633
I'm sorry about the headache.

2116
01:46:11,733 --> 01:46:14,035
I'll make it up to you.

2117
01:46:14,135 --> 01:46:15,970
Sure.

2118
01:46:18,706 --> 01:46:19,607
What's that?

2119
01:46:19,707 --> 01:46:20,608
What?

2120
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:21,609
That.

2121
01:46:21,709 --> 01:46:23,010
It's a guitar.

2122
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:26,881
What, you doing it
with groups now?

2123
01:46:26,981 --> 01:46:28,483
Don't be so disgusting.

2124
01:46:28,583 --> 01:46:29,884
And the radio.

2125
01:46:29,984 --> 01:46:32,487
You got a bloke
in there, haven't you?

2126
01:46:32,587 --> 01:46:34,489
It's none of your damn business.

2127
01:46:34,589 --> 01:46:36,491
Pick him up cheap, too?

2128
01:46:36,591 --> 01:46:37,892
There's no one in there.

2129
01:46:37,992 --> 01:46:40,495
I honestly thought
you had a headache.

2130
01:46:40,595 --> 01:46:42,497
What a mug I've grown into.

2131
01:46:42,597 --> 01:46:44,832
Get out. I have
a splitting headache.

2132
01:47:12,727 --> 01:47:15,029
Why him?
Better than me?

2133
01:47:15,129 --> 01:47:17,565
What's he got that I haven't,

2134
01:47:17,665 --> 01:47:19,200
apart from long hair?

2135
01:47:21,168 --> 01:47:23,671
Well?

2136
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:26,508
Come on, let's have it.
What's he bleedin' got?

2137
01:47:27,875 --> 01:47:29,677
He's younger than you are.

2138
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:33,515
You got it?

2139
01:48:13,588 --> 01:48:15,489
"He's younger than you are,"

2140
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:16,858
that's what she said.

2141
01:48:16,958 --> 01:48:18,593
Anybody would think
I was doddering about

2142
01:48:18,693 --> 01:48:20,161
on bleeding crutches.

2143
01:48:20,261 --> 01:48:22,463
Trouble is I still keep
thinking about her.

2144
01:48:22,564 --> 01:48:24,866
I can't get her out of me mind.

2145
01:48:24,966 --> 01:48:27,869
Who'd have thought a ruddy
great lust-box like her

2146
01:48:27,969 --> 01:48:30,872
would have found her way
into anybody's feelings?

2147
01:48:30,972 --> 01:48:33,474
She might have looked
a hard case,

2148
01:48:33,575 --> 01:48:35,877
but underneath
she was quite mumsie,

2149
01:48:35,977 --> 01:48:38,713
and she was
in beautiful condition.

2150
01:48:38,813 --> 01:48:42,750
Do you know, I'm beginning
to think she was beautiful.

2151
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:45,753
After all,
it ain't through the eyes

2152
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:47,154
that you feel beauty.

2153
01:48:47,254 --> 01:48:50,157
It's how the heart
hungers for something

2154
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:51,693
that makes it beautiful.

2155
01:48:54,295 --> 01:48:55,630
Coo-ee.

2156
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:01,769
Siddie.

2157
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:04,672
Alfie, hello.

2158
01:49:04,772 --> 01:49:07,074
I ain't seen you in ages.

2159
01:49:07,174 --> 01:49:08,676
You didn't turn up.

2160
01:49:08,776 --> 01:49:11,078
Oh, look, I can explain that.

2161
01:49:11,178 --> 01:49:12,680
Ain't half missed you.

2162
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,548
I like that gear.

2163
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:17,885
Where you going?

2164
01:49:17,985 --> 01:49:20,755
I got the car around the corner.

2165
01:49:20,855 --> 01:49:22,289
What about it?

2166
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:25,627
No, I can't. I'm going
to meet me husband.

2167
01:49:25,727 --> 01:49:27,028
It's nice material.

2168
01:49:27,128 --> 01:49:31,032
Still, you always was
a snappy dresser.

2169
01:49:31,132 --> 01:49:32,600
What about Sunday then?

2170
01:49:33,768 --> 01:49:35,069
I'm not sure.

2171
01:49:35,169 --> 01:49:36,671
Come on.

2172
01:49:36,771 --> 01:49:38,239
Same time?
Same place?

2173
01:49:39,641 --> 01:49:40,942
We'll see.

2174
01:49:41,042 --> 01:49:43,678
I'll wait for you
for about five minutes.

2175
01:49:43,778 --> 01:49:45,079
Don't forget your napkin.

2176
01:49:45,179 --> 01:49:48,082
I'm like the boy scouts,
I am--

2177
01:49:48,182 --> 01:49:49,083
always prepared.

2178
01:49:49,183 --> 01:49:50,785
See you then, eh?

2179
01:49:51,686 --> 01:49:53,054
Maybe.

2180
01:50:03,197 --> 01:50:04,699
You know what?

2181
01:50:04,799 --> 01:50:07,101
When I look back
on my little life

2182
01:50:07,201 --> 01:50:09,070
and the birds I've known,

2183
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:12,106
I think of all the things
they've done for me

2184
01:50:12,206 --> 01:50:14,709
and the little
I've done for them.

2185
01:50:14,809 --> 01:50:17,111
You'd think
I've had the best of it

2186
01:50:17,211 --> 01:50:18,713
all along the line.

2187
01:50:18,813 --> 01:50:21,115
But what have I got out of it?

2188
01:50:21,215 --> 01:50:23,718
I got a Bob or two,

2189
01:50:23,818 --> 01:50:25,119
some decent clothes,

2190
01:50:25,219 --> 01:50:26,120
a car.

2191
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:28,122
I got me health back,

2192
01:50:28,222 --> 01:50:30,157
and I ain't attached.

2193
01:50:40,702 --> 01:50:43,604
But I ain't got
me peace of mind,

2194
01:50:43,705 --> 01:50:45,940
and if you ain't got that,

2195
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:47,641
you ain't got nothing.

2196
01:50:47,742 --> 01:50:51,145
It seems to me if they
ain't got you one way,

2197
01:50:51,245 --> 01:50:52,747
they got you another.

2198
01:50:52,847 --> 01:50:54,148
So what's the answer?

2199
01:50:54,248 --> 01:50:56,150
That's what
I keep asking meself.

2200
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:57,752
What's it all about?

2201
01:50:57,852 --> 01:50:59,120
Know what I mean?

2202
01:51:15,803 --> 01:51:17,404
