1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,367


2
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:52,338
<i> When I was lying there in the VA hospital ...</i>

3
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:55,158
<i> ... with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life, ...</i>

4
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:58,584
<i> ... I started having these dreams of flying.</i>

5
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,979
<i> I was free.</i>

6
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:06,299
<i>Sooner or later though, ...</i>

7
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:08,391
<i> ... you always have to wake up.</i>

8
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:27,386
<i>In Cryo you don't dream at all.</i>

9
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:29,164
<i>It doesn't feel like 6 years.</i>

10
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:32,604
<i>More like a fifth of
tequila and ass-kicking.</i>

11
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:41,392
<i>Tommy was the scientist, not me.</i>

12
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:45,907
<i>He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space to find the answers.</i>

13
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:47,676
Are we there yet?

14
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:48,910
Yeah, we're there sunshine.

15
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:51,012
We're there.

16
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:54,233
<i>It's about your brother.</i>

17
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:59,675
<i>So, a week before Tommy
was gonna ship out...</i>

18
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:02,236
<i>A guy with a gun ends his journey ...</i>

19
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,683
<i>... for the paper in his wallet.</i>

20
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,799
Being in Cryo for 5 years,
9 months and 22 days.

21
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:11,839
You will be hungry,
you will be weak.

22
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:14,486
If you feel nauseous please use the ...

23
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,686
<i>Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.</i>

24
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:21,402
<i>Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going some place he's gonna regret.</i>

25
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,531
<i>Up ahead was Pandora.</i>

26
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,932
<i>You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.</i>

27
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:54,700
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

28
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:57,738
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

29
00:02:57,772 --> 00:03:00,338
And since your genome is identical to his,

30
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:02,939
you could step into his shoes.

31
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:05,743
So to speak.

32
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:15,466
<i>It'd be a fresh start,
on a new world.</i>

33
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:24,429
And the pay is good.

34
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:27,150
Very good.

35
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,725
Exo-Packs on!
Let's go, Exo-Packs on!

36
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,762
Remember people, you lose that mask
you're unconscious in 20 seconds.

37
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:57,964
You're dead in 4 minutes.
Let nobody be dead today.

38
00:03:57,998 --> 00:04:01,365
It looks very bad on my report.

39
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:04,175
This is TAD-1-6 on approach.

40
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,384
Crossing outer marker.
Monument in sight

41
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:46,464
<i>One life ends...</i>

42
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,783
<i>Another begins.</i>

43
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:59,286
Harnesses off. Get your packs ...
-- Put it together. Let's go.

44
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:01,142
One minute, let's go.

45
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:05,511
When the ramp comes down, go
directly into the base. Do not stop.

46
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:08,790
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

47
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,714
Go! Go! Go! Go! ..

48
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:17,515
Get out of there!

49
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,001
Keep moving. Let's go!

50
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,164
<i>There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine.</i>

51
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,360
<i>You may be out...</i>

52
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:29,398
<i> ... but you never lose the attitude.</i>

53
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,880
<i>I told myself I could pass
any test a man can pass.</i>

54
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:41,371
<i>They can fix the spine,
if you got the money.</i>

55
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:45,207
<i>But not on Vet benefits,
not in this economy.</i>

56
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:49,289
Let's go Special K.
Do not make me wait for you!

57
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:51,809
Well, well, ladies.

58
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:55,211
Look at all this fresh meat!

59
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:04,108
<i> Back on Earth, these guys
were Army dogs. Marines.</i>

60
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:07,038
<i>Fighting for freedom.</i>

61
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:15,152
<i>Look out hot rod.</i>

62
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:19,769
<i>But out here they're just hired guns,
taking the money, working for the company.</i>

63
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,425
Check this out man.
Meals on wheels.

64
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:28,924
Aww, man , that is just wrong.

65
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,977
You are not in Kansas any more.

66
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:48,962
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

67
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:53,497
Respect that fact,
every second of every day.

68
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:57,598
If there is a hell,

69
00:06:57,632 --> 00:07:02,972
you might wanna go there for some
R and R after a tour on Pandora.

70
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:08,353
Out there beyond that fence,
every living thing that

71
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:13,813
crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to
kill you and eat your eyes for Ju-Ju Beads

72
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:19,595
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

73
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:22,224
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

74
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,814
that will stop your heart in one minute.

75
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:29,149
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occuring carbon fiber.

76
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:33,333
They are very hard to kill.

77
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,664
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

78
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,482
I will not succeed.

79
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,579
Not with all of you.

80
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:51,235
If you wish to survive you need to
cultivate a strong mental attitude.

81
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:54,447
You've got to obey the rules.

82
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:57,339
Pandora rules.

83
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,630
Rule number one...

84
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:04,003
It's nothing like an old school safety
brief to put your mind at ease.

85
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:09,708
Jake, you're Jake right?

86
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:12,133
Tom's brother.

87
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,490
You look just like him.

88
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:18,860
Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman.
I went through Avatar training with him.

89
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:22,354
The Bio-Lab. We're gonna
spend a lot of time here.

90
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:26,334
How you doing,
Norm, Avatar driver.

91
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,613
Here's the link room right here.

92
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:32,390
This is where we're
connecting to the Avatar.

93
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:37,731
Me and Norm are here to drive these
remotely controlled bodies called Avatars.

94
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:42,829
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

95
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:44,802
Hey, welcome.

96
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:47,771
Welcome to Pandora,
good to have you.

97
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:53,272
Damn, they got big. - They fully
mature on the flight out.

98
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:56,482
So the progress up the stim
seem to work really well.

99
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:58,455
Yeah, they got great muscle tone.

100
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,498
It'll take us a few hours
to get them prepared,

101
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,505
but you can take them out tomorrow.

102
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,316
There's yours.

103
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,247
Doctor, Norm Spellman.
- Pleasure to meet you.

104
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:36,916
Looks like him.

105
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:39,933
Looks like you.

106
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:43,340
This is your Avatar now, Jake.

107
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:49,606
The concept is that every driver
is matched to his own Avatar.

108
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:53,498
So that their nervous system are in tune.

109
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,189
Or something...

110
00:09:56,228 --> 00:10:02,053
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's Avatar.

111
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:04,213
Which is insanely expensive.

112
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:06,180
Is this right?

113
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:08,382
I just say whatever
to the video log?

114
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,878
Yeah, we gotta get the habit
of documenting everything.

115
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:13,302
What we see, what we feel,
it's all part of the science.

116
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:16,420
And good science is good observation.
- Plus it'll help keep you sane

117
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:19,422
for the next 6 years.

118
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:21,623
Whatever.

119
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:23,437
So uh, ...

120
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:27,027
Here I am.

121
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:30,508
Doing science.

122
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,392
They're coming out.

123
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:35,750
<i>Attention, drivers coming out of the lane.</i>

124
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:43,628
Oh God ...

125
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:47,117
<i>- Where's the lab coat?
- Where's her lab coat?</i>

126
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:50,739
Who's got my goddamn cigarette!?

127
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:54,363
Guys, what's wrong with this picture?

128
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:56,209
Thank you!

129
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:58,007
Grace Augustine is a legend.

130
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:00,810
She's the head of the Avatar
program. She wrote the book.

131
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:03,767
I mean literally wrote the
book on Pandoran botany.

132
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:06,530
That's because she likes
plants better than people.

133
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,416
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

134
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:12,853
Grace I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

135
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:17,653
Norm, I hear good things about
you. How's your Na'vi?

136
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:35,750
Grace, this is Jake Sully.

137
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:38,634
Yeah yeah, I know who you are
and I don't need you.

138
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,275
I need your brother.
You know, the PHD

139
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:43,953
who trained for three
years for this mission...

140
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:46,158
He's dead.

141
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:48,553
I know it's a big
inconvenience for everyone.

142
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,475
How much lab training have you had?

143
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,676
I dissected a frog once.

144
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:56,041
You see?

145
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:59,882
They're just pissing on us with out
even a courtesy of calling it rain.

146
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,401
I'm going to Selfridge.
- No Grace!

147
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,964
No man, this is such bullshit!

148
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,566
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

149
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:09,006
He has no business sticking
his nose in my department.

150
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:11,614
Here tomorrow, 08:00.

151
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,810
Try and use big words.

152
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:25,950
<i>Scorpion 2 Hotel, Hell's Gate Tower.
You are cleared for South departure. ...</i>

153
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:35,467
Did you see that?
- Yes sir.

154
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:40,504
No you didn't, you were looking at
the monitor. I love this putter Ronnie.

155
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:45,072
Parker...

156
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:47,908
I used to think it
was benign neglect,

157
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:50,709
but now I see that you're
intentionally screwing me.

158
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:54,712
Grace, I enjoy our little talks...

159
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:01,996
I need a researcher,
not some jar-head drop out.

160
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,916
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

161
00:13:03,952 --> 00:13:05,482
Lucky?
- Yeah.

162
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,683
How is this in any way 'lucky'?

163
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,592
Lucky your guy had a twin brother.

164
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,593
And lucky that brother
wasn't some oral hygenist or something.

165
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,405
A Marine we could use. I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

166
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:20,492
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there.

167
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:22,588
Look, you're supposed to be
winning the hearts and the

168
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,649
minds of the natives, isn't that the
whole point of your little puppet show?

169
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:28,132
You look like them, you talk like
them and they'll start trusting us.

170
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,300
We build them a school,
we teach them English...

171
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:34,135
But after how many years relations with
the indigenous are only getting worse.

172
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:37,337
That tends to happen when you
use machine guns on them.

173
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:39,619
Right, come here.

174
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,507
This is why we're here, Unobtanium.

175
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:51,627
Because this little gray
rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

176
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:54,948
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

177
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:58,228
It's what pays for
your science. żComprendo?

178
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:01,436
Now, those savages are
threatening our whole operation.

179
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,872
We're on the brink of war and you're

180
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:06,274
supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

181
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,037
So use what you've got
and get me some results.

182
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:23,642
How much link-time have you logged?

183
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:26,844
About 520 hours.
- That's good.

184
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:29,734
You're in there.
You're here.

185
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,370
How much have you logged?
- Zip.

186
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,131
But I read a manual.

187
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,492
Tell me you're joking.

188
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,173
This is cool.

189
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,175
Let's go.

190
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:48,179
Don't. I got this.

191
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,281
So you just figured you'd come out here

192
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:56,984
to the most hostile environment
known to man...

193
00:14:57,018 --> 00:15:00,703
with no training of any kind
and see how it went?

194
00:15:00,737 --> 00:15:03,070
What was going through your head?

195
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:06,591
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

196
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:09,792
Biometrics are good.
- 1-3 is ready.

197
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,074
Keep your arms in,
hands in.

198
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:14,795
Head down.

199
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:16,207
Down.

200
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:19,115
Just relax and let your mind go blank.

201
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,676
That shouldn't be hard for you.

202
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:25,680
Kiss the darkest part of my...
- Initiate link.

203
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:29,602
Run sequence, Unit 3.
- Launching.

204
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:37,606
I have the first congruency.

205
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:48,094
That's a gorgeous brain.
Nice activity.

206
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:53,138
Go figure.
- Phase lock 40%.

207
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:58,737
I'm going in.

208
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:00,351
I'm going in in 4.

209
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:05,702
Phase lock 99%.
Link is stable.

210
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:24,533
Jake, can you hear me?

211
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:26,336
Can you hear me, Jake?

212
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:29,158
Pupillary reflex is good.

213
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,920
Hearing response normal.
How are you feeling Jake?

214
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,321
Hey guys.

215
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:38,839
Welcome to your
new body Jake.

216
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,301
<i> Good.</i>

217
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,411
We're gonna take this
nice and easy Jake.

218
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:43,878
And touch your thumb to your fingers.

219
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,274
Thumb to your fingers.

220
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,885
No problem.
- Good. I can see you remember that one.

221
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:48,889
Got it.

222
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:50,977
Well, if you want to
sit up, that's fine.

223
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:54,700
Let's take it nice and slow Jake.
No tranquil attacks here, that's good.

224
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,789
Do you feel lightheaded or dizzy?

225
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:58,709
Wiggling your toes.
- Good Jake.

226
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,923
System motor control is good.

227
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:06,569
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

228
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,425
Take it easy, don't get
ahead of yourself, okay?

229
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:15,950
There are few more sensory and motor
reflex tests we need to run, so take it easy.

230
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,958
Sit down.
- Jake listen to me.

231
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:25,169
Jake I need you to sit down.
- It's OK, I got this.

232
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,797
Jake you need to sit down.
- Guys get him back on the gurney now.

233
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,385
You need to sit down.
you need time to adjust to atm..

234
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:35,893
Yeah!

235
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:38,399
Sedate him!

236
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,846
1,000 mg of Seconal.

237
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:41,058
Stop! ...
-- Stop!

238
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,025
Woah ... Woah.

239
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,506
- Jake!
- Jake, listen to me.

240
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,021
You're not used to your
Avatar body, this is dangerous.

241
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:51,229
This is great.
- Come on, they're gonna put you out.

242
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:56,127
Sit down!

243
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:57,562
No no, ...
I got to get out of these leads.

244
00:17:58,012 --> 00:17:59,099
Goddammit!
Bring them!

245
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:06,384
Come on, you ain't got no skills.

246
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,393
I don't even have to
play defense. - Hey guys.

247
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:13,800
It's OK, I'll get him.
- Jake you have to come inside.

248
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,215
Sorry.

249
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:25,429
You're not supposed to be running!

250
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,053
Sorry.
- Watch it.

251
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:01,271
Hey Marine!

252
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,635
Damn...

253
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:05,684
Grace?

254
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:08,604
Who did you expect numb nuts?

255
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:11,297
Think fast!

256
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:14,218
Motor control is looking good.

257
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:26,024
C'mon everybody quiet down.

258
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,334
Lights out.

259
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,493
C'mon Louise, chop chop.

260
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,785
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

261
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,592
That's kinda freaky.
- C'mon.

262
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:38,595
Scat.

263
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:46,411
Lights out, see you at dinner kitties.

264
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,670
Welcome back.

265
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,611
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

266
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:25,981
I'm Trudy, I fly all the Scientzoids.

267
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:28,627
And this here is my baby.

268
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,792
Hold on a second.

269
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:34,205
Hey Wainfleet, get it done.

270
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,928
We bounce at 09:00.
- I'm on it captain.

271
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,019
Mine-Strike's still loose.
- You guys are packing some heavy gear.

272
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,223
Watch it!

273
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:47,869
That's cause we're not the only
thing flying around out there.

274
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:49,642
Or the biggest.

275
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:52,763
But I need you on a Door-Gun.
I'm a man short.

276
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,968
Thought you'd never ask.

277
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,497
There's your man.
See you on the flight lane.

278
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:12,170
You wanted to see me Colonel?

279
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:15,294
This low gravity
will make you soft.

280
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:18,621
You get soft...

281
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:24,913
Pandora will shit you out
dead with zero warning.

282
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:28,104
I pulled your record Corporal.

283
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:31,252
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

284
00:21:32,372 --> 00:21:35,139
Nothing like this here though.

285
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:40,034
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

286
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,801
Figured it's just another hell hole.
- I was the first Recon myself.

287
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:48,888
Few years ahead of you,
well maybe more than a few.

288
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:52,096
Three tours in Nigeria,
not a scratch.

289
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,182
I come out here...

290
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:58,027
Day one. Think I felt
like a shavetail Louie?

291
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:02,598
They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

292
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,204
Make me pretty again.

293
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:08,214
But you know what,
I kinda like it.

294
00:22:08,254 --> 00:22:11,222
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

295
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:15,429
The Avatar program is a bad joke.

296
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:19,218
Bunch a limp dick
science majors.

297
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:23,576
However, it does present
an opportunity

298
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:27,898
most timely and unique.
Clear!

299
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,161
A Recon GI-re in an Avatar body.

300
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:39,768
That's a potent mix,
Gives me the goosebumps.

301
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:45,219
Such a Marine could provide the
intel I need, right on the ground.

302
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,911
Right in the hostile's camp.

303
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:54,238
Look Sully, I want you to learn
these savages from the inside.

304
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,207
I want you to gain their trust.

305
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,967
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

306
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,644
or hammer them hard if they won't.

307
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:04,462
Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

308
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:06,985
You walk like on of her science pukes. ...

309
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,152
You quack like one...

310
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:12,719
But you report to me.

311
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:15,563
Can you do that for me son?

312
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:18,371
Hell yeah sir.

313
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:21,177
Well all right then.

314
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:34,214
Son, I take care of my own.

315
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,735
You get me what I need,
I'll see to it you get

316
00:23:36,736 --> 00:23:39,219
your legs back when you rotate home.

317
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,346
Your real legs.

318
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,436
That sounds real good sir.

319
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,855
Link's ready.

320
00:23:55,978 --> 00:24:00,068
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

321
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:03,826
<i> Link 3 ready.</i>

322
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:07,807
All right, I'm going in.

323
00:25:16,563 --> 00:25:19,850
Shut it down, we're gonna stay a while.

324
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:25,180
Norm, your pack.

325
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,673
Stay with the ship.

326
00:25:30,712 --> 00:25:33,600
One idiot with a gun is enough.

327
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,609
You the man, Doc.

328
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:17,580
Prolemurs, they're not aggressive.

329
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:23,715
Relax Marine, you're making me nervous.

330
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:33,446
So, how will they know we're here?
- I'm sure they're watching us right now.

331
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:39,211
Keep moving Norm.
- Keep up guys.

332
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:43,216
And here I go.
- Scanning.

333
00:26:48,423 --> 00:26:50,662
It's that fast?

334
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,831
Amazing isn't it?
- Yeah

335
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:56,588
That is signal transduction

336
00:26:56,622 --> 00:26:59,355
from this root to the root
of the tree next to it.

337
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:01,796
So, we should take a sample.

338
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:03,437
Okay, ... Sample.

339
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,643
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

340
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:14,168
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

341
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,371
Oh, right.

342
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:12,633
Don't shoot.

343
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,455
Don't shoot. You'll piss him off.

344
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:21,204
It's already pissed off.

345
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:24,642
Jake, that armor is
too thick, trust me.

346
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:34,655
It's a territorial threat display,
do not run or he'll charge.

347
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,776
So what do I do?
Dance with it?

348
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:40,659
Just, hold your ground.

349
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:57,736
C'mon, what you got?!

350
00:28:57,773 --> 00:29:00,401
Oh yeah. Who's bad?
That's right.

351
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,408
That's what I'm talking about bitch.

352
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,777
That's right, get your
punk ass back to mommy.

353
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:12,975
You got nothing, keep running.
Why don't you bring back some friends.

354
00:29:30,194 --> 00:29:32,834
What about this one?
Run, don't run, what?!

355
00:29:33,914 --> 00:29:36,918
Run, definitely run!

356
00:33:22,562 --> 00:33:27,087
We're gonna have to call it guys,
we're not allowed to run Night Ops. Col's orders.

357
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:31,650
Sorry doc, he's just gonna
have to hang on till morning.

358
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,695
He won't make it till morning.

359
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:28,977
I don't have all goddamn night.

360
00:35:29,018 --> 00:35:31,821
Come on!

361
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,781
Wait, don't!

362
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:52,185
Great.

363
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:52,568
I know you probably
don't understand this.

364
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:55,251
But...

365
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,141
Thank you.

366
00:38:04,863 --> 00:38:07,144
Thank you.

367
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:13,151
That was pretty impressive.

368
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:17,997
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along.

369
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:24,083
Wait a second,
where are you going?

370
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:27,186
Wait up.

371
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,049
Slow down.

372
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:32,369
I just wanted to say thanks
for killing those things...

373
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,178
Don't thank.

374
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:40,379
You don't thank for this.

375
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,324
This is sad.

376
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,931
Very sad, only.

377
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:48,509
OK, I'm sorry.

378
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:51,912
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

379
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:58,204
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

380
00:38:58,238 --> 00:39:00,401
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

381
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:02,229
Your fault!
- Aye, wooo.

382
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:03,835
Your fault.
-- Easy.

383
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:09,730
You're like a baby, making noise,
don't know what to do.

384
00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:13,579
Fine

385
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:19,223
If you love your
little forest friends...

386
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:23,066
Why not let them just kill my ass?

387
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:25,512
What's the thinking?

388
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:28,833
Why save you?
- Why save me?

389
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:35,477
You have a strong heart.

390
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,082
No fear.

391
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:46,449
But stupid, ignorant like a child.

392
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:54,861
Well if I'm like a child, then ..

393
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,349
... maybe you should teach me.

394
00:39:57,383 --> 00:40:01,506
Sky people can not learn. You do not see.
- Teach me how to see.

395
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:04,471
No one can teach you to see.

396
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,475
Come on, can't we talk?

397
00:40:08,515 --> 00:40:11,017
Where did you learn to speak english?

398
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,518
Dr. Augustine's school?

399
00:40:17,405 --> 00:40:20,486
You're like a baby.

400
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,094
I need your help.

401
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:30,899
You should not be here.

402
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:34,502
OK, take me with you.
- No, go back.

403
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:38,147
No.

404
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,906
Go back.

405
00:41:29,598 --> 00:41:31,681
What are they?

406
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:35,204
Seeds of the sacred tree.

407
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,808
Very pure spirits.

408
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,516
What was that all about?

409
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,119
Come.

410
00:42:11,246 --> 00:42:13,408
Where are we going?

411
00:42:22,936 --> 00:42:24,461
Come.

412
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:30,626
What's your name?

413
00:43:30,688 --> 00:43:32,691
What's going on?

414
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,021
What's happening?

415
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:23,816
What's he saying?

416
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:27,697
What's he saying?

417
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:30,818
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

418
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:33,503
Your father?

419
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:36,945
It's nice to meet you sir.

420
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:48,821
That is mother, she is Tsahik,

421
00:45:48,856 --> 00:45:51,618
the one who interprets the will of Eywa.

422
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,704
Who's Eywa?

423
00:46:00,313 --> 00:46:02,516
What are you called?

424
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,718
Jake Sully.

425
00:46:13,934 --> 00:46:16,098
Why did you come to us?

426
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:18,225
I came to learn.

427
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,864
We have tried to teach
other sky people.

428
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,471
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

429
00:46:26,192 --> 00:46:29,642
My cup is empty,
trust me.

430
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:32,681
Ask Dr. Augustine,
I'm no scientist.

431
00:46:32,716 --> 00:46:34,883
What are you?

432
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:38,693
I was a Marine.

433
00:46:40,294 --> 00:46:43,461
A warrior, of the jarhead clan.

434
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,627
It is decided.

435
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,952
My daughter will teach you our ways,

436
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:22,242
Learn well Jake Sully.

437
00:47:22,278 --> 00:47:27,484
And we will see if your
insanity can be cured.

438
00:47:44,874 --> 00:47:46,875
Good evening.

439
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,523
Please don't get up.

440
00:47:56,612 --> 00:47:58,813
Sorry.

441
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:03,299
Hey, how you doing?

442
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:50,134
Jake. ... Jake.
- He's coming out.

443
00:48:50,952 --> 00:48:51,696
Jake!

444
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,105
Come on back kid.
Come on. That's it.

445
00:48:58,427 --> 00:49:00,712
There you go.

446
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:06,598
You were talking like a tick.

447
00:49:09,522 --> 00:49:12,329
Is the Avatar safe?
- Yeah Doc.

448
00:49:13,248 --> 00:49:16,534
You are not gonna
believe where I am.

449
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:20,599
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

450
00:49:20,633 --> 00:49:24,067
disappearing in the bush with this
angry Thanator coming after him.

451
00:49:24,102 --> 00:49:26,551
It's not something you can teach.

452
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:31,759
For reasons I cannot fathom
the Omaticaya have chosen you.

453
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:33,960
God help us all.

454
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:36,485
Jarhead clan?

455
00:49:37,446 --> 00:49:39,135
And it worked?

456
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,453
I'm practically family.

457
00:49:41,493 --> 00:49:44,942
They're gonna study me,
I have to learn to be one of them.

458
00:49:44,977 --> 00:49:48,184
That's called taking initiative son.
I wish I had ten more like you,

459
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:52,507
Sully, just find out what
the blue monkeys want.

460
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:57,996
You know, we tried to give them
medicine, education...

461
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:00,803
... roads, but no, they like mud.

462
00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:05,010
And that wouldn't bother
me, it's just that their uh ...

463
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:09,415
Can somebody just...
Sector 12.

464
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:13,144
Stop.

465
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:14,917
Where .. Stop. Jesus.

466
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:18,983
Their damn village
happens to be resting on

467
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:25,238
the richest Unobtanium deposit
within 200 clicks in any direction.

468
00:50:25,274 --> 00:50:28,044
I mean, look at all that cheddar.

469
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:34,333
Who gets them to move?
- Guess?

470
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:37,939
What if they won't go?

471
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:40,344
I'm betting that they will.

472
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:46,274
Killing the indigenous looks bad.

473
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:50,076
But there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press.

474
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:53,562
And that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

475
00:50:53,603 --> 00:50:57,169
So just find me a carrot
that will get them to move,

476
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:58,936
otherwise it's going to
have to be all stick.

477
00:50:59,446 --> 00:51:00,168
Okay?

478
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:04,622
You got three months.
That's when the dozers get there.

479
00:51:04,657 --> 00:51:07,304
Well we're wasting time.

480
00:51:07,704 --> 00:51:10,107
I like this guy.

481
00:51:10,143 --> 00:51:12,312
OK, let's run through them again.

482
00:51:12,393 --> 00:51:15,515
Moat: Dragon lady.

483
00:51:16,397 --> 00:51:18,609
Eytuken.
- Eytukan

484
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:21,608
He's the clan leader.
She's their spiritual leader.

485
00:51:21,648 --> 00:51:24,132
Like a Shaman.
- Got it.

486
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:28,222
Tsutey.
- Tsu'tey

487
00:51:28,258 --> 00:51:31,142
He'll be the next clan leader.

488
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:34,427
Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik.

489
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,750
They become a mated pair.

490
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:40,155
So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?!

491
00:51:40,757 --> 00:51:44,462
Only their Deity. Their Goddess
made up of all living things.

492
00:51:44,497 --> 00:51:47,994
Everything they know. You'd know this if
you had any training whatsoever.

493
00:51:48,028 --> 00:51:51,491
Who's got a date with
the chief's daughter?

494
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:54,376
Let's go. Village life starts early.

495
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:59,106
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

496
00:52:17,413 --> 00:52:19,816
Easy boy.

497
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:22,220
It's a female.

498
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:28,350
Easy girl

499
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:59,358
That is Sa'helu, the bond.

500
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:03,363
Feel her.

501
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:08,690
Feel her heart beat.

502
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:11,618
Her breath.

503
00:53:13,301 --> 00:53:15,503
Feel her strong legs.

504
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:21,392
You may tell her what to do, inside.

505
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,919
For now, say where to go.

506
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:29,804
Forward.

507
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:49,015
You should go away.

508
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:51,306
Nah, you'd miss me.

509
00:53:51,342 --> 00:53:53,562
I knew you could speak english.

510
00:54:11,388 --> 00:54:13,357
Again.

511
00:54:13,391 --> 00:54:16,297
If you want to hit this thing,
it's going to be complicated.

512
00:54:16,331 --> 00:54:19,507
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

513
00:54:19,024 --> 00:54:22,172
There's an outer row of columns,
real heavy duty.

514
00:54:22,211 --> 00:54:24,899
There's a secondary ring here,
and an inner ring.

515
00:54:24,934 --> 00:54:28,112
There's a core structure like a spiral.

516
00:54:28,146 --> 00:54:29,881
That's how they move up and down.

517
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:32,725
We're gonna need accurate
scans of every column.

518
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:34,416
Roger that.

519
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:37,102
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

520
00:54:37,137 --> 00:54:40,467
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load bearing.

521
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,646
Where are we going?

522
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:49,138
Gettin out of Dodge.

523
00:54:49,174 --> 00:54:53,351
I'm not about to let Selfridge and
Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

524
00:54:53,387 --> 00:54:58,801
There's a mobile link up as site 26, we can
work out of, way up in the mountains.

525
00:54:59,483 --> 00:55:01,849
The Hallelujah mountains?

526
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:04,217
That's right.
- Are you serious?

527
00:55:04,252 --> 00:55:05,261
Yeah.

528
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:06,434
Yes!

529
00:55:09,755 --> 00:55:13,527
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora, heard of them?

530
00:55:27,087 --> 00:55:29,057
We're getting close.

531
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,502
Yeah, look at my instruments.

532
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:35,190
We're in the flux vortex.

533
00:55:35,229 --> 00:55:38,399
VFR from here on.
- What's VFR?

534
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:41,729
Means you got to see
where you're going.

535
00:55:41,763 --> 00:55:44,340
You can't see anything.
- Exactly.

536
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:46,827
Ain't that a bitch.

537
00:56:04,197 --> 00:56:07,688
Oh my God...

538
00:56:17,555 --> 00:56:20,043
You should see your faces.

539
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:48,851
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

540
00:57:07,386 --> 00:57:09,391
Welcome to Camp.

541
00:57:12,403 --> 00:57:17,216
So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

542
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:20,706
Norm, go under.

543
00:57:20,748 --> 00:57:22,953
<i>Grace didn't miss a thing.</i>

544
00:57:24,237 --> 00:57:26,529
<i>She knew I was
talking to the Colonel.</i>

545
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:30,174
<i>But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan.</i>

546
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:32,460
<i>So she's playing nice.</i>

547
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:35,835
Jake, hang a left.

548
00:57:35,871 --> 00:57:38,201
You'll be in the link at the end.

549
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,774
Unit 1, Beulah.

550
00:57:42,814 --> 00:57:45,422
She's the least glitchy.

551
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:35,535
Holy shit.

552
00:58:35,568 --> 00:58:38,258
Do not look in her eye.

553
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,968
Ikran is not horse.

554
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:52,017
When Sa'helu is made...

555
00:58:54,908 --> 00:58:56,995
Ikran will fly well.

556
00:58:57,035 --> 00:59:00,526
Only one hunter
in the whole life.

557
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,837
To become Aron'yu, hunter...

558
00:59:11,878 --> 00:59:16,372
You must choose your own
Ikran and he must choose you.

559
00:59:17,856 --> 00:59:20,785
When?
- When you are ready.

560
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:11,706
Okay, ...

561
01:00:12,341 --> 01:00:14,908
This is video log 12.

562
01:00:14,942 --> 01:00:17,440
Time is 21:32.

563
01:00:17,475 --> 01:00:21,646
Do I have to do this now?
Like, I really need to get some rack.

564
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:25,258
No, now, when it's fresh.

565
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:29,671
Location, shack.

566
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:32,800
The days are starting to blur together.

567
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:36,977
<i>The language is a pain, but...</i>

568
01:00:37,014 --> 01:00:41,143
<i>I figure it's like field stripping a
weapon, repetition, repetition...</i>

569
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:50,535
If only you were stronger.

570
01:00:54,144 --> 01:00:56,152
<i>Neytiri calls me Scoun.</i>

571
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:59,079
<i>It means moron.</i>

572
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:03,694
<i>Norm's attitude is
improved lately.</i>

573
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:06,100
But it's not just I'm
seeing you in front of me

574
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:07,784
I see into you...

575
01:01:07,823 --> 01:01:10,834
<i>It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a Scoun too.</i>

576
01:01:13,121 --> 01:01:15,409
You've got to run, OK?

577
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:16,153
Let's go.

578
01:01:16,578 --> 01:01:19,223
<i>I feel me getting tougher.</i>

579
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:22,111
<i>I can run farther every day.</i>

580
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:25,436
<i>I have to trust my body
to know what to do.</i>

581
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,654
Yeah, check it out!

582
01:01:33,003 --> 01:01:33,881
Crap.

583
01:01:38,468 --> 01:01:40,589
<i>Every day it's reading the trail,</i>

584
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,841
<i>track's of the wora'hon,
tiniest scents and sounds.</i>

585
01:01:51,115 --> 01:01:53,290
<i>She's always going on
about the flow of energy</i>

586
01:01:54,342 --> 01:01:56,033
<i>the spirits of animals.</i>

587
01:01:56,503 --> 01:01:59,007
<i>I really hope this tree hugging
crap isn't on the final.</i>

588
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,579
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there you know.

589
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:05,354
You need to listen to what she says.

590
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:09,300
Try to see the forest
through her eyes.

591
01:02:09,366 --> 01:02:12,299
Excuse me, this is my video log here.

592
01:02:27,264 --> 01:02:29,413
<i>With Neytiri it's
learn fast or die.</i>

593
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:33,047
You got to be kidding me.

594
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:04,773
<i>I talked Moat into letting Grace into the village.</i>

595
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,716
<i>1st time since her school was closed down.</i>

596
01:03:11,228 --> 01:03:14,282
No you don't, come back here.

597
01:03:16,289 --> 01:03:18,494
Bon apetit.

598
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:45,822
Come on, Marine.

599
01:04:11,657 --> 01:04:14,030
<i>I'm trying to understand
this deep connection</i>

600
01:04:14,363 --> 01:04:16,870
<i>the people have to the forest.</i>

601
01:04:16,905 --> 01:04:20,200
<i>She talks about a network of energy.</i>

602
01:04:20,248 --> 01:04:24,238
<i>That flows through all living things.</i>

603
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:28,429
<i>She says, all energy is only borrowed.</i>

604
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:32,580
<i>And one day you
have to give it back.</i>

605
01:05:14,197 --> 01:05:16,149
A clean kill.

606
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,534
You are ready.

607
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:49,573
Learning to ride an Ikran,
we call them Banshees,

608
01:05:49,609 --> 01:05:52,603
is the test every young
hunter has to pass.

609
01:05:54,387 --> 01:05:58,539
But to do that, you got to go
where the banshees are.

610
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,541
Ooh-rah

611
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:04,540
Jake Sully will go first.

612
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:39,630
Now you choose your Ikran.

613
01:08:39,668 --> 01:08:42,034
This you must feel inside.

614
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,513
If he also chooses you
move quick like I showed.

615
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:47,748
You will have one chance Jake.

616
01:08:48,145 --> 01:08:50,546
How will I know if he chooses me?

617
01:08:50,581 --> 01:08:53,143
He will try to kill you.

618
01:08:53,179 --> 01:08:56,062
Outstanding.

619
01:09:55,113 --> 01:09:57,633
Let's dance.

620
01:10:31,179 --> 01:10:33,477
Make the bond!

621
01:10:40,014 --> 01:10:42,009
Jake!

622
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,984
Sa'Helu Jake!

623
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:01,481
Sa'Helu!

624
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:13,277
Stop!

625
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:25,149
That's right, you're mine.

626
01:11:39,064 --> 01:11:42,381
First flight seals the bond,
you can not wait.

627
01:11:43,344 --> 01:11:45,980
Think fly.
- Fly?

628
01:11:54,138 --> 01:11:56,377
God damn...

629
01:11:59,855 --> 01:12:02,132
Oh shit!

630
01:12:10,928 --> 01:12:14,366
Shut up and fly straight!

631
01:12:22,843 --> 01:12:24,326
That's it.

632
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:26,563
Bank left.

633
01:12:34,757 --> 01:12:37,635
Level out!
That's it.

634
01:12:41,836 --> 01:12:43,583
Go Jake Sully!

635
01:13:28,732 --> 01:13:31,608
Yeah baby I got this!

636
01:13:31,645 --> 01:13:33,529
Oh shit!

637
01:13:38,207 --> 01:13:41,807
<i>I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this.</i>

638
01:13:44,804 --> 01:13:47,168
I came like this,
this you,

639
01:13:48,266 --> 01:13:51,779
I turn, I feel the wind,
I turn very strong.

640
01:13:51,813 --> 01:13:53,852
I see, I bank so hard.

641
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,424
The Tree of Souls.

642
01:14:58,235 --> 01:15:03,970
Aybetraya Ramunam
It's their most sacred place.

643
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:06,486
See the flux vortex and
these full color images?

644
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:09,165
That's what messes up my instruments.

645
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:14,667
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

646
01:15:14,702 --> 01:15:16,247
I would die to get samples.

647
01:15:16,857 --> 01:15:19,012
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

648
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:21,075
You lucky swine.

649
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:30,794
<i>I was a stone cold
aerial hunter.</i>

650
01:15:31,337 --> 01:15:32,611
<i>Death from above.</i>

651
01:15:33,532 --> 01:15:36,693
<i>Only problem is,
you're not the only one.</i>

652
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:42,319
Dive!

653
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,852
Follow me!

654
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:04,029
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

655
01:17:04,981 --> 01:17:09,120
It is Toruk, Last Shadow.

656
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,111
Right, it's the last one
you ever see.

657
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,852
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Makto.

658
01:17:21,891 --> 01:17:24,764
Rider of last shadow.

659
01:17:25,262 --> 01:17:27,758
He rode this?

660
01:17:28,474 --> 01:17:30,437
Toruk chose him.

661
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:34,542
It has only happen five times since
the time from the first songs.

662
01:17:34,577 --> 01:17:37,020
That's a long time.
- Yes.

663
01:17:37,055 --> 01:17:39,611
Toruk Makto was mighty.

664
01:17:40,527 --> 01:17:44,518
He brought the clans together
in a time of Great Sorrow.

665
01:17:44,553 --> 01:17:48,429
All Na'vi people know the story.

666
01:17:53,578 --> 01:17:56,256
<i>Everything is backwards now.</i>

667
01:17:56,291 --> 01:18:00,162
<i>Like out there is the true world,
and in here is the dream.</i>

668
01:18:21,432 --> 01:18:24,823
It's hard to believe it's
only been three months.

669
01:18:27,174 --> 01:18:29,811
I barely remember my own life.

670
01:18:33,106 --> 01:18:35,048
I don't know who I am anymore.

671
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:56,385
Haven't got lost in
the woods, have you?

672
01:18:59,593 --> 01:19:02,921
Your last report was more
than two weeks ago.

673
01:19:04,846 --> 01:19:07,935
I'm starting to doubt your resolve.

674
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:13,350
Way I see it, it's time to terminate
the mission. - I can do this.

675
01:19:14,152 --> 01:19:16,923
You already have.

676
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,085
You've given me good usable intel.

677
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:21,938
This Tree of Souls place...

678
01:19:21,974 --> 01:19:25,383
Yeah, I got them by the balls with
that when this turns into a shit fight

679
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:27,754
which it will.

680
01:19:27,789 --> 01:19:31,119
Now is time to come in.

681
01:19:31,398 --> 01:19:36,093
By the way, you're gonna
get your legs back.

682
01:19:37,293 --> 01:19:40,020
Yeah, I got you Corporate approval.

683
01:19:40,056 --> 01:19:42,748
It's a done deal,
gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

684
01:19:42,783 --> 01:19:45,837
I'm a man of my word.

685
01:19:47,642 --> 01:19:50,051
I got to finish this.

686
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:54,059
It's one more thing.

687
01:19:54,093 --> 01:19:55,985
Ceremony...

688
01:19:56,786 --> 01:20:00,275
It's the final stage of becoming a man.

689
01:20:01,358 --> 01:20:04,165
If I do it, I'm one of them.

690
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:07,575
They'll trust me.

691
01:20:10,503 --> 01:20:14,031
And I can negotiate the
terms of their relocation.

692
01:20:27,267 --> 01:20:31,077
Than you better get
it done Corporal.

693
01:20:47,482 --> 01:20:51,334
<i>The Na'vi say, every person is born twice.</i>

694
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,932
<i>The second time is
when you earn</i>

695
01:20:55,932 --> 01:21:00,036
<i>your place among
the people, forever.</i>

696
01:21:59,676 --> 01:22:01,683
Come.

697
01:22:19,248 --> 01:22:22,860
This is a place for
prayers to be heard.

698
01:22:23,459 --> 01:22:26,670
And sometimes answered.

699
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:36,497
We call this tree Utral Aymokriyä

700
01:22:36,531 --> 01:22:39,705
The Tree of Voices.

701
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:44,118
The voices of our ancestors.

702
01:22:57,753 --> 01:23:00,159
I can hear them

703
01:23:04,251 --> 01:23:07,779
They live Jake.

704
01:23:07,812 --> 01:23:10,785
Within Eywa.

705
01:23:13,796 --> 01:23:16,283
You are Omaticaya now.

706
01:23:16,322 --> 01:23:20,092
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

707
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:27,849
And you may choose a woman.

708
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:32,333
We have many fine women.

709
01:23:32,371 --> 01:23:35,654
Nenat is the best singer.

710
01:23:37,575 --> 01:23:40,536
I don't want Nenat.

711
01:23:43,578 --> 01:23:46,660
Paral is good hunter.

712
01:23:47,342 --> 01:23:50,063
Yes, she is a good hunter.

713
01:23:51,463 --> 01:23:54,344
I've already chosen.

714
01:23:56,866 --> 01:24:00,468
But this woman must also choose me.

715
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:06,472
She already has.

716
01:24:35,609 --> 01:24:39,050
I'm with you now Jake.

717
01:24:39,085 --> 01:24:42,493
We are mated for life.

718
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:50,096
<i>What the hell are you doing Jake?</i>

719
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,716
Don't forget the phase
integration, middle button.

720
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,837
You got to eat something.

721
01:25:33,604 --> 01:25:34,473
Jake!

722
01:25:36,123 --> 01:25:39,125
Wake up. Jake please!

723
01:25:39,545 --> 01:25:42,848
Don't make me force feed a cripple.

724
01:26:10,564 --> 01:26:12,212
There, I'm done, let's go.

725
01:26:12,806 --> 01:26:14,446
And when was the last
time you took a shower?

726
01:26:14,984 --> 01:26:17,948
I don't need a shower.
- Jesus Marine.

727
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,549
Jake!

728
01:26:29,501 --> 01:26:30,501
Jake!

729
01:26:30,502 --> 01:26:31,323
Wake up!

730
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,324
Jake!

731
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:33,425
Wake up!

732
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:38,519
Hey!

733
01:26:39,902 --> 01:26:42,361
Stop!

734
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:50,872
Hey boss...

735
01:26:54,786 --> 01:26:56,908
What? - I got a native
doing a funky chicken here.

736
01:26:57,218 --> 01:26:58,576
He's blocking my blade.

737
01:27:00,075 --> 01:27:01,454
Keep going, he'll move.

738
01:27:02,339 --> 01:27:04,017
These people have to
learn that we don't stop.

739
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:05,389
Come on, go, go go ..

740
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,825
Stop!

741
01:27:10,188 --> 01:27:12,122
Go! Go!

742
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,241
There, see, he moved.

743
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:29,062
Woah, woah, ...
Dude, woah, dude, no!

744
01:27:29,323 --> 01:27:32,002
Oh! I'm blind!

745
01:27:43,396 --> 01:27:45,919
Jake!
- Neytiri!

746
01:27:47,319 --> 01:27:49,721
Come on!

747
01:28:13,735 --> 01:28:16,416
Freeze it, right there!

748
01:28:17,818 --> 01:28:20,699
Scale up, enhance.

749
01:28:22,019 --> 01:28:24,221
Son of a bitch.

750
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,023
Unbelievable.

751
01:28:27,503 --> 01:28:30,145
Get me a pilot.
- Yes sir.

752
01:28:50,471 --> 01:28:52,719
You do not speak here!

753
01:29:04,043 --> 01:29:06,244
Don't do this!

754
01:29:07,845 --> 01:29:09,847
You!
- Listen, brother...

755
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:18,734
You mated with the human!
- Oh shit...

756
01:29:19,533 --> 01:29:21,775
Is this true?

757
01:29:22,975 --> 01:29:27,221
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.

758
01:29:27,258 --> 01:29:30,944
Brother please, do not
attack the sky people.

759
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:35,262
Many Omatacaya will die if you do.
- You are not my brother!

760
01:29:38,343 --> 01:29:41,146
And I am not your enemy!

761
01:29:41,187 --> 01:29:44,588
The enemy is out there!
And they are very powerful!

762
01:29:51,471 --> 01:29:53,672
I can talk to them!
- No more talk!

763
01:30:01,797 --> 01:30:05,279
I am Omaticaya,
I am one of you.

764
01:30:05,314 --> 01:30:08,602
And I have the right to speak.

765
01:30:21,889 --> 01:30:25,092
These words are like
stones in my heart.

766
01:30:28,613 --> 01:30:30,179
Sir, I'm sorry.

767
01:30:30,213 --> 01:30:32,895
You can't interrupt
a link in progress.

768
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:35,977
It's very dangerous!

769
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:38,786
Grace!

770
01:30:41,678 --> 01:30:43,154
Wait!
- Stay down sir!

771
01:30:46,794 --> 01:30:47,553
Look, ...

772
01:30:48,303 --> 01:30:50,786
I was sent here to ...

773
01:31:17,441 --> 01:31:21,042
Are you out of your Goddamned mind?!
- You crossed the line.

774
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:27,048
Wheel this meat out of here.

775
01:31:28,006 --> 01:31:30,929
Jake! What the hell
is going on here?

776
01:31:33,849 --> 01:31:36,332
You let me down son.

777
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:39,534
So what, you...

778
01:31:40,415 --> 01:31:42,977
You found yourself some local tail

779
01:31:42,978 --> 01:31:45,539
and you completely forget
what team you're playing for?

780
01:31:45,573 --> 01:31:48,259
Parker, there is time to
salvage this situation...

781
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:50,819
Shut your pie hole!

782
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:53,307
Or what, Ranger Rick?

783
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:56,005
You gonna shoot me?
- I could do that.

784
01:31:56,039 --> 01:31:58,434
You need to muzzle your dog.

785
01:31:58,468 --> 01:32:00,826
Can we take this down a
couple of notches please?

786
01:32:00,868 --> 01:32:03,348
You say you want to keep
your people alive?

787
01:32:03,383 --> 01:32:05,434
Start by listening to her.

788
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:08,951
Those trees were sacred to
Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine.

789
01:32:08,952 --> 01:32:09,955
You know what?

790
01:32:09,967 --> 01:32:12,237
You throw a stick
in the air around here

791
01:32:12,273 --> 01:32:15,915
it's gonna land on some
sacred fern for Christ's sake.

792
01:32:15,951 --> 01:32:19,522
I'm not talking about
some kind of pagan voodoo

793
01:32:19,557 --> 01:32:21,718
I'm talking about something real,

794
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:23,880
something measurable in
a biology of the forest.

795
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:26,245
Which is what exactly?

796
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,728
What we think we know,
is that there's some kind of

797
01:32:29,763 --> 01:32:33,244
electro chemical communication
between the roots of the trees.

798
01:32:33,286 --> 01:32:35,451
Like synapses between neurons.

799
01:32:35,487 --> 01:32:40,290
And each tree has 10 to the fourth
connections to the trees around it.

800
01:32:40,325 --> 01:32:43,572
And there are 10 to the
tvelfth trees on Pandora.

801
01:32:44,371 --> 01:32:46,372
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

802
01:32:46,775 --> 01:32:49,895
It's more connections
than the human brain.

803
01:32:50,175 --> 01:32:52,856
Get it?
It's a network.

804
01:32:52,896 --> 01:32:56,180
It's a global network, and
the Na'vi can access it.

805
01:32:56,214 --> 01:32:58,345
They can upload and download data.

806
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:02,864
Memories, at sites like the
one you just destroyed.

807
01:33:02,865 --> 01:33:03,866
Yes!

808
01:33:05,103 --> 01:33:09,387
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

809
01:33:10,066 --> 01:33:13,389
They're just Goddamn trees.

810
01:33:14,069 --> 01:33:17,391
You need to wake up Parker.
- No, you need to wake up.

811
01:33:16,785 --> 01:33:20,124
The wealth of this world isn't in
the ground, it's all around us.

812
01:33:20,693 --> 01:33:24,351
The Na'vi know that, and
they're fighting to defend it

813
01:33:24,593 --> 01:33:27,181
If you want to share
this world with them,

814
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:29,164
you need to understand them.

815
01:33:29,244 --> 01:33:34,027
I'd say we understand them just
fine, thanks to Jake here.

816
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:37,568
Hey Doc, come take a look.

817
01:33:37,605 --> 01:33:40,450
<i>They're not gonna
give up their home.</i>

818
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:44,392
<i>They're not gonna make a deal.</i>

819
01:33:44,921 --> 01:33:47,442
<i>For light beer?</i>

820
01:33:48,174 --> 01:33:49,962
<i>And blue jeans?</i>

821
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,898
<i>There's nothing that
we have that they want.</i>

822
01:33:57,525 --> 01:34:01,061
<i>Everything they sent me out
here to do is a waste of time.</i>

823
01:34:05,655 --> 01:34:08,580
<i>They're never gonna
leave Hometree.</i>

824
01:34:11,915 --> 01:34:16,914
Since a deal can't be made I guess
things get real simple, Jake.

825
01:34:17,605 --> 01:34:19,116
Thanks.

826
01:34:19,152 --> 01:34:23,541
I'm getting all emotional.
I might just give you big wet kiss.

827
01:34:29,791 --> 01:34:33,126
I'll do with minimal
casualties to indigenous.

828
01:34:33,766 --> 01:34:36,731
I'll drive them out with gas first.

829
01:34:37,654 --> 01:34:40,059
It'll be humane.

830
01:34:40,862 --> 01:34:43,468
More or less.

831
01:34:43,549 --> 01:34:46,594
Alright, let's pull the trigger.

832
01:34:53,812 --> 01:34:55,975
This is how it's done.

833
01:34:57,981 --> 01:35:01,675
When people are sitting on shit you want,

834
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:05,039
you make them your enemy,
then you justify taking it.

835
01:35:05,837 --> 01:35:07,923
Quatrich just rolled in the gunships.

836
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:10,809
He's gonna hit Hometree.
- My God.

837
01:35:16,742 --> 01:35:19,870
Dr. Augustine, you cannot be up here!

838
01:35:19,904 --> 01:35:20,838
Back off!

839
01:35:20,874 --> 01:35:23,322
Parker, wait, stop,

840
01:35:23,358 --> 01:35:25,729
These are people
you're about to...

841
01:35:25,763 --> 01:35:29,491
They're fly bitten savages
that live in a tree.

842
01:35:29,526 --> 01:35:31,140
Alright, look around.

843
01:35:31,175 --> 01:35:33,381
I don't know about you
but I see a lot of trees.

844
01:35:33,414 --> 01:35:35,264
They can move.

845
01:35:35,304 --> 01:35:37,509
Can you guys just please...
- There are families in there.

846
01:35:37,989 --> 01:35:40,755
There are children, babies...
Are you gonna kill children?

847
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:43,523
You don't want that kind
of blood on your hands, believe me.

848
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:47,692
Let me try to talk them out.

849
01:35:47,732 --> 01:35:50,097
They trust me.

850
01:35:52,623 --> 01:35:54,627
Calibrate the path.
We're going in right now.

851
01:35:54,829 --> 01:35:56,714
<i> Calibrating 3 and 4</i>

852
01:35:57,351 --> 01:36:00,253
<i>Run sequence
-Initiating 30 seconds</i>

853
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:06,220
Listen to me,
you've got one hour.

854
01:36:06,254 --> 01:36:08,660
Unless you want your girlfriend in
there when the axe comes down

855
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:12,470
you get them to evacuate.
One hour.

856
01:36:39,328 --> 01:36:41,333
Tell them they're gonna
be here soon.

857
01:36:43,338 --> 01:36:45,663
You have to leave,
or you're gonna die.

858
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:48,630
Are you certain of this?

859
01:36:51,435 --> 01:36:53,842
They sent me here...

860
01:36:53,882 --> 01:36:56,131
to learn your ways.

861
01:36:56,167 --> 01:37:00,496
So one day I could bring this message,
and that you would believe it.

862
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:04,349
What are you saying Jake?

863
01:37:04,384 --> 01:37:07,071
You knew this would happen?

864
01:37:08,914 --> 01:37:10,762
Yes.

865
01:37:10,799 --> 01:37:13,728
At first, it was just orders.

866
01:37:14,607 --> 01:37:16,933
And then, everything changed.

867
01:37:16,969 --> 01:37:19,383
I fell in love.

868
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:22,186
I fell in love with the forest.

869
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:24,952
With the Omaticaya people.

870
01:37:25,752 --> 01:37:27,756
With you.

871
01:37:30,323 --> 01:37:33,449
I trusted you.
- Trust me now, please.

872
01:37:40,466 --> 01:37:42,931
You will never be
one of the people!

873
01:37:42,967 --> 01:37:45,398
He tried to stop them!

874
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:59,187
You have to go,
they are coming!

875
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:37,915
Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

876
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,408
They want to destroy this place.

877
01:38:41,442 --> 01:38:43,529
Neytiri, you must go now.

878
01:38:47,135 --> 01:38:49,621
Get to the forest!
Run!

879
01:38:51,545 --> 01:38:53,196
Run!

880
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,569
Goddamn it, run!

881
01:39:24,982 --> 01:39:27,788
That is one big damn tree.

882
01:39:34,843 --> 01:39:36,693
Well, well, well ...

883
01:39:36,728 --> 01:39:39,815
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

884
01:39:40,937 --> 01:39:43,226
Alright people, let's get this done.

885
01:39:43,261 --> 01:39:45,829
I want every gas round you
got right in the front door.

886
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:48,472
Roger, CS-40's going hot.

887
01:39:48,509 --> 01:39:50,559
Fire.
- Firing.

888
01:40:01,303 --> 01:40:03,308
Bingo, good shooting ace.

889
01:40:10,924 --> 01:40:12,927
Sir, they've opened fire.

890
01:40:14,531 --> 01:40:17,097
You got to be kidding me.

891
01:40:28,846 --> 01:40:31,416
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

892
01:40:31,451 --> 01:40:34,457
Let's turn up the heat.
Switch incendiaries.

893
01:40:35,942 --> 01:40:37,946
Fire.

894
01:40:59,915 --> 01:41:02,641
And that's how you
scatter the roaches.

895
01:41:05,929 --> 01:41:07,933
Neytiri...

896
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:18,677
We gotta move, he's gonna
blow the columns!

897
01:41:38,481 --> 01:41:40,486
Moat, no!

898
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:43,010
If you are one of us...

899
01:41:43,534 --> 01:41:45,697
Help us.

900
01:41:52,753 --> 01:41:54,919
All call signs switch missiles.

901
01:41:54,723 --> 01:41:57,488
<i>Give me HE to the
base of the West columns.</i>

902
01:41:58,931 --> 01:42:00,814
This way!

903
01:42:06,025 --> 01:42:09,031
Yeah baby, get some!

904
01:42:10,954 --> 01:42:13,439
Bring it down.

905
01:42:19,531 --> 01:42:21,535
Come on Grace, move!

906
01:42:23,779 --> 01:42:25,783
Get down!

907
01:42:37,004 --> 01:42:39,374
Screw this.

908
01:42:39,409 --> 01:42:41,057
What the hell are you doing?

909
01:42:41,092 --> 01:42:44,499
I didn't sign up for this shit!

910
01:43:38,485 --> 01:43:40,408
Go! Go! Go!

911
01:45:22,206 --> 01:45:24,290
Good work people.

912
01:45:24,329 --> 01:45:26,414
First round's on me tonight.

913
01:45:26,449 --> 01:45:28,217
Let's boogie.

914
01:46:22,803 --> 01:46:24,808
Neytiri!

915
01:46:34,145 --> 01:46:36,891
I'm sorry.

916
01:46:36,926 --> 01:46:39,637
Get away!

917
01:46:40,678 --> 01:46:43,082
Get away from here!

918
01:46:44,164 --> 01:46:47,091
Never come back!

919
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:05,244
Pull the plug.

920
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,210
You can't do that!

921
01:47:26,366 --> 01:47:29,332
<i>I was a warrior who
dreamed he could bring peace.</i>

922
01:47:30,656 --> 01:47:33,119
<i>Sooner or lather though...</i>

923
01:47:33,154 --> 01:47:35,585
<i>You always have to wake up.</i>

924
01:47:51,296 --> 01:47:54,021
You murderers!

925
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:43,077
What's going on brother?
Long time no see.

926
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:48,286
Personally I don't feel these
tree hugging traitors deserve steak.

927
01:48:48,325 --> 01:48:51,212
They got steak?
That's bullshit. Let me see that.

928
01:48:52,614 --> 01:48:55,098
Yeah, you know what that is.
Down.

929
01:48:55,138 --> 01:48:57,825
Trudy
- All the way down.

930
01:49:01,029 --> 01:49:03,836
Max!

931
01:49:12,252 --> 01:49:14,336
Trudy, fire up the ship.

932
01:49:15,378 --> 01:49:16,861
Here.

933
01:49:28,483 --> 01:49:30,608
Clear, come on.

934
01:49:30,643 --> 01:49:31,609
Here you go.

935
01:49:46,799 --> 01:49:48,403
Max, stay here.

936
01:49:48,442 --> 01:49:50,601
I need someone on
the inside I can trust.

937
01:49:50,631 --> 01:49:52,651
Okay, go.

938
01:50:05,556 --> 01:50:07,479
Clear.

939
01:50:08,761 --> 01:50:10,248
Come on baby.

940
01:50:10,285 --> 01:50:13,372
Colonel, sir.
I got a situation here.

941
01:50:16,696 --> 01:50:20,383
It's sector 1-6
Unauthorized engine start.

942
01:50:26,876 --> 01:50:29,282
Come on!

943
01:50:30,003 --> 01:50:32,488
Mask on!

944
01:50:37,136 --> 01:50:39,140
I'm taking fire, let's go!

945
01:51:00,662 --> 01:51:02,787
Colonel!

946
01:51:14,689 --> 01:51:16,659
Crap.

947
01:51:16,694 --> 01:51:19,379
Everybody all right back there?
- Yeah baby.

948
01:51:19,419 --> 01:51:21,382
Norm, you good?
- Yeah.

949
01:51:22,424 --> 01:51:25,230
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

950
01:51:25,265 --> 01:51:27,879
Grace is hit.
- What?

951
01:51:27,916 --> 01:51:30,519
Get the trauma kit.
Keep the pressure on Grace.

952
01:51:30,554 --> 01:51:33,127
Trauma kit's forward,
on the bulk head.

953
01:51:33,162 --> 01:51:35,931
Hang on Grace.
- Doesn't matter.

954
01:51:36,534 --> 01:51:39,338
It's fine.

955
01:51:41,019 --> 01:51:44,227
Good to go?
- Take it up.

956
01:51:44,267 --> 01:51:46,271
Hold on.

957
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,883
You're clear!

958
01:52:00,258 --> 01:52:03,304
Keep going north,
get us deep into the mountains.

959
01:52:03,339 --> 01:52:05,590
Copy that.

960
01:52:11,481 --> 01:52:13,203
Norm, you all good up there?

961
01:52:13,239 --> 01:52:15,729
<i>Yup, still here.</i>

962
01:52:16,811 --> 01:52:19,114
At least they can't
track us up here.

963
01:52:19,149 --> 01:52:21,385
Not this far into the vortex.

964
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:23,503
It's strongest at the
Tree of Souls, right?

965
01:52:23,545 --> 01:52:25,887
Yeah.
- Good.

966
01:52:25,925 --> 01:52:28,232
Cause that's where we're going.

967
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:36,819
Ouch!

968
01:52:40,856 --> 01:52:43,142
You big baby.

969
01:52:43,181 --> 01:52:45,351
Are we moving?

970
01:52:45,385 --> 01:52:47,791
I'm gonna get you
some help Grace.

971
01:52:48,192 --> 01:52:51,397
I'm a scientist, remember?

972
01:52:51,432 --> 01:52:54,448
I don't believe in fairy tales.

973
01:52:54,482 --> 01:52:58,692
The people can help you,
I know it.

974
01:53:00,294 --> 01:53:03,301
Why would they help us?

975
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:21,936
<i>The people say,
Eywa will provide.</i>

976
01:53:23,219 --> 01:53:26,826
<i>But no home,
no hope...</i>

977
01:53:26,866 --> 01:53:29,632
<i>There was only one
place they could go.</i>

978
01:53:43,178 --> 01:53:47,185
Link's running.
What's the plan here Jake?

979
01:53:47,221 --> 01:53:49,670
There's no plan.

980
01:53:49,712 --> 01:53:52,075
Tsu'Tey is the chief now.

981
01:53:52,115 --> 01:53:54,880
He's not gonna let
you near that place.

982
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:57,406
I've got to try.

983
01:53:59,409 --> 01:54:01,412
Launching.

984
01:54:22,134 --> 01:54:24,137
<i>Outcast...</i>

985
01:54:24,178 --> 01:54:26,542
<i>Betrayer...</i>

986
01:54:26,584 --> 01:54:28,546
<i>Alien...</i>

987
01:54:29,067 --> 01:54:32,273
<i>I was in the place,
the eye does not see.</i>

988
01:54:43,375 --> 01:54:45,639
<i>I needed their help.</i>

989
01:54:45,675 --> 01:54:47,868
<i>and they needed mine.</i>

990
01:54:47,903 --> 01:54:50,189
<i>But to ever face them again...</i>

991
01:54:50,228 --> 01:54:52,993
<i>I was gonna have to take
it to a whole new level.</i>

992
01:55:01,009 --> 01:55:04,457
<i>Sometimes your whole life
boils down to one insane move.</i>

993
01:55:07,141 --> 01:55:09,426
There's something we gotta do.

994
01:55:09,465 --> 01:55:12,150
You're not going to like it.

995
01:55:21,370 --> 01:55:25,175
<i>The way I had it figured,
Turok is the baddest cat in the sky.</i>

996
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:27,462
<i>Nothing attacks him.</i>

997
01:55:27,501 --> 01:55:29,149
Easy boy.

998
01:55:29,103 --> 01:55:31,705
<i>So why would he ever look up?</i>

999
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:34,307
<i>That was just a theory.</i>

1000
01:57:25,777 --> 01:57:27,861
I see you.

1001
01:57:29,944 --> 01:57:32,867
I see you.

1002
01:57:40,077 --> 01:57:42,879
I was afraid Jake.

1003
01:57:42,916 --> 01:57:45,485
For my people.

1004
01:57:47,488 --> 01:57:50,371
I'm not any more.

1005
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:13,088
You are the leader.

1006
01:58:13,122 --> 01:58:15,526
And a great warrior.

1007
01:58:16,005 --> 01:58:18,329
I can't do this without you.

1008
01:58:24,816 --> 01:58:27,221
Toruk Makto.

1009
01:58:34,430 --> 01:58:37,354
I will fly with you.

1010
01:58:39,478 --> 01:58:42,281
My friend is dying.

1011
01:58:43,562 --> 01:58:45,766
Grace is dying.

1012
01:58:47,087 --> 01:58:49,771
I beg the help of Eywa.

1013
01:59:00,786 --> 01:59:02,989
Look where we are Grace.

1014
01:59:09,997 --> 01:59:13,002
I need to take some samples.

1015
01:59:35,631 --> 01:59:39,637
Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is...

1016
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:43,243
In this body.

1017
01:59:44,845 --> 01:59:46,528
Is that possible.

1018
01:59:46,567 --> 01:59:51,654
She must pass through the
eye of Eywa, and return.

1019
01:59:52,375 --> 01:59:54,536
But Jake Sully...

1020
01:59:54,578 --> 01:59:57,341
She is very weak.

1021
01:59:57,983 --> 02:00:01,347
Hold on Grace.
They're gonna fix you up.

1022
02:00:57,744 --> 02:00:59,746
Jake...

1023
02:01:00,467 --> 02:01:02,550
Grace...

1024
02:01:03,551 --> 02:01:05,833
I'm with her Jake.

1025
02:01:07,436 --> 02:01:10,481
She's real.

1026
02:01:11,552 --> 02:01:13,407
Grace.

1027
02:01:13,713 --> 02:01:14,354
Grace.

1028
02:01:15,902 --> 02:01:17,137
What's happening?

1029
02:01:24,881 --> 02:01:25,423
Grace.

1030
02:01:26,582 --> 02:01:28,585
Grace...

1031
02:01:29,987 --> 02:01:31,989
What's happening?

1032
02:01:37,876 --> 02:01:40,000
Did it work?

1033
02:01:44,686 --> 02:01:46,929
Her wounds were too great.

1034
02:01:47,489 --> 02:01:49,213
It was not enough time.

1035
02:01:50,413 --> 02:01:52,537
She is with Eywa now.

1036
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:29,065
With your permission,
I will speak now.

1037
02:02:31,068 --> 02:02:33,391
You would honor me
by translating.

1038
02:02:40,601 --> 02:02:42,883
The sky people have
sent us a message...

1039
02:02:46,288 --> 02:02:48,771
That they can take
whatever they want.

1040
02:02:50,493 --> 02:02:52,778
And no one can stop them.

1041
02:02:55,902 --> 02:02:58,385
But we will send them a message.

1042
02:03:00,228 --> 02:03:02,630
You ride out as fast as
the wind can carry you.

1043
02:03:05,314 --> 02:03:07,837
We tell the other clans to come.

1044
02:03:11,523 --> 02:03:14,005
You tell that Turok Makto
calls to them.

1045
02:03:16,007 --> 02:03:17,930
You fly now!

1046
02:03:17,971 --> 02:03:19,893
With me!

1047
02:03:19,932 --> 02:03:22,937
My brothers, sisters...

1048
02:03:23,538 --> 02:03:26,020
And we will show the sky people.

1049
02:03:26,541 --> 02:03:29,067
That they can not take
whatever they want!

1050
02:03:29,946 --> 02:03:34,832
And that this,
this is our land!

1051
02:04:46,450 --> 02:04:48,934
<i>We rode out to the four winds...</i>

1052
02:04:50,776 --> 02:04:53,259
<i>To the horse clans of the plain...</i>

1053
02:04:57,466 --> 02:04:59,988
<i>To the Ikran people of
the eastern sea.</i>

1054
02:05:00,869 --> 02:05:03,873
<i>When Turok Makto
called them, they came.</i>

1055
02:05:44,847 --> 02:05:50,454
Everyone on this base, everyone of you is
fighting for survival, and that's a fact.

1056
02:05:51,817 --> 02:05:54,941
There's aboriginal horde out there,
massing for an attack.

1057
02:05:58,225 --> 02:06:00,629
These orbital images tell me,

1058
02:06:00,868 --> 02:06:04,073
that the hostiles numbers have
gone from few hundred

1059
02:06:04,153 --> 02:06:06,958
to well over two
thousand in one day.

1060
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:09,761
And more are pouring in.

1061
02:06:11,684 --> 02:06:14,247
In a weeks time, there
could be 20.000 of them.

1062
02:06:15,168 --> 02:06:18,254
At that point they will
overrun our perimeter.

1063
02:06:18,373 --> 02:06:20,896
That's not gonna happen.

1064
02:06:21,377 --> 02:06:24,662
Our only security lies in
preemptive attack.

1065
02:06:25,062 --> 02:06:27,586
We will fight terror
with terror.

1066
02:06:31,791 --> 02:06:36,746
Now the hostiles believe that this
mountain stronghold of theirs is protected

1067
02:06:36,975 --> 02:06:40,804
by their Deity.

1068
02:06:41,204 --> 02:06:43,005
And when we destroy it...

1069
02:06:43,326 --> 02:06:46,130
We will blast a crater in their
racial memory so deep

1070
02:06:46,212 --> 02:06:49,094
that hey won't come within a 1000
clicks of this place ever again.

1071
02:06:49,334 --> 02:06:52,820
And that too, is a fact.

1072
02:07:05,036 --> 02:07:08,480
<i>Jake it's crazy here, full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.</i>

1073
02:07:08,521 --> 02:07:11,926
<i>They got these huge
palettes of mine explosives</i>

1074
02:07:12,045 --> 02:07:14,168
<i>for some shock
and awe campaign.</i>

1075
02:07:14,248 --> 02:07:16,332
Freakin daisy cutters.

1076
02:07:17,771 --> 02:07:20,335
<i>Quaritch has taken over, he's
rolling them and there's no stopping him.</i>

1077
02:07:20,376 --> 02:07:22,460
When?
- 06:00 tomorrow.

1078
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:24,662
<i>I got to go.</i>

1079
02:07:26,664 --> 02:07:28,989
We're screwed.

1080
02:07:29,548 --> 02:07:33,273
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical
plan that didn't envolve martyrdom.

1081
02:07:35,558 --> 02:07:38,361
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1082
02:07:41,885 --> 02:07:43,807
I have 15 clans out there.

1083
02:07:44,769 --> 02:07:46,691
That's over 2000 warriors.

1084
02:07:48,294 --> 02:07:49,313
We know these mountains.

1085
02:07:49,694 --> 02:07:51,160
We fly them,
You fly them.

1086
02:07:52,219 --> 02:07:53,581
They don't.

1087
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:57,588
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking, won't work.

1088
02:07:58,387 --> 02:08:01,511
They'll have to fire a line of sight.
If they bring the fight to us...

1089
02:08:02,312 --> 02:08:04,634
then we have the
home field advantage.

1090
02:08:06,116 --> 02:08:09,201
You know he's gonna commit
that bomber staight to the Tree of Souls.

1091
02:08:09,721 --> 02:08:10,803
I know.

1092
02:08:10,925 --> 02:08:13,208
If they get to it, it's over.

1093
02:08:13,528 --> 02:08:17,333
That's their direct line to
Eywa, their ancestors.

1094
02:08:17,369 --> 02:08:19,500
It'll destroy them.

1095
02:08:19,535 --> 02:08:22,019
Then I guess we better stop them.

1096
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:39,961
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1097
02:08:42,367 --> 02:08:44,689
But if you're there...

1098
02:08:45,653 --> 02:08:47,974
I need to give you a heads up.

1099
02:08:49,656 --> 02:08:51,578
If Grace is with you...

1100
02:08:52,580 --> 02:08:55,104
Look into her memories.

1101
02:08:55,383 --> 02:08:57,908
See the world we come from.

1102
02:08:58,587 --> 02:09:00,789
There's no green there.

1103
02:09:01,913 --> 02:09:04,195
They killed their mother.

1104
02:09:04,717 --> 02:09:06,999
And they're gonna
do the same here.

1105
02:09:08,799 --> 02:09:11,286
More sky people are gonna come.

1106
02:09:11,525 --> 02:09:14,009
They're gonna come like
rain that never ends.

1107
02:09:15,690 --> 02:09:18,014
Unless we stop them.

1108
02:09:21,699 --> 02:09:24,023
You chose me for something.

1109
02:09:24,743 --> 02:09:26,906
I will stand and fight.

1110
02:09:27,627 --> 02:09:29,710
You know I will.

1111
02:09:31,711 --> 02:09:34,036
But I need a little help here.

1112
02:09:40,124 --> 02:09:43,247
Our Great Mother does
not take sides Jake.

1113
02:09:45,050 --> 02:09:48,134
She protects only the
balance of life.

1114
02:10:00,150 --> 02:10:02,474
It was worth a try.

1115
02:10:50,137 --> 02:10:52,622
<i>This is group leader,
we're entering the flux vortex.</i>

1116
02:10:53,942 --> 02:10:55,946
<i>Switch to manual flight mode.</i>

1117
02:11:32,396 --> 02:11:34,476
This is papa dragon.

1118
02:11:34,518 --> 02:11:37,602
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1119
02:11:44,929 --> 02:11:46,292
Suit team, go.

1120
02:11:46,532 --> 02:11:48,817
<i>Alright ladies, let's bring the pain.</i>

1121
02:12:22,180 --> 02:12:24,185
Eyes up, check that overhead.

1122
02:12:25,265 --> 02:12:27,389
Watch those thermal scans.

1123
02:12:27,668 --> 02:12:29,791
<i>All call signs,
papa has lead.</i>

1124
02:12:29,827 --> 02:12:31,874
<i>Pushing the target.</i>

1125
02:12:31,955 --> 02:12:34,076
<i>Escorts, be close on my shuttle.</i>

1126
02:12:38,482 --> 02:12:40,485
We are gonna lose
some paint in here.

1127
02:12:41,887 --> 02:12:43,889
<i>Gun crews keep
your head on a swivel.</i>

1128
02:12:44,691 --> 02:12:48,216
<i>Make no mistake people,
they're out there.</i>

1129
02:12:49,178 --> 02:12:52,502
Alright people, target in sight.
Range four clicks.

1130
02:12:53,183 --> 02:12:55,706
Valkirye 1-6, get your payload ready.

1131
02:12:58,110 --> 02:13:00,112
Push to the ramp!

1132
02:13:13,850 --> 02:13:16,935
Hold position, we got
movement out there.

1133
02:13:16,974 --> 02:13:18,736
<i>Hold position.</i>

1134
02:13:25,746 --> 02:13:28,351
Sir, ground has movement.

1135
02:13:30,272 --> 02:13:32,836
Fire in line!
- Targets closing.

1136
02:13:32,876 --> 02:13:34,758
Range 400 meters.

1137
02:13:35,158 --> 02:13:37,763
Can't you clean it up?
- No sir, it's the flux.

1138
02:14:06,201 --> 02:14:08,403
Brother, I'm gonna punch
a hole, you follow me through.

1139
02:14:50,661 --> 02:14:53,344
All aircrafts, weapons free.

1140
02:14:54,547 --> 02:14:56,469
Brake right, come around.

1141
02:15:08,403 --> 02:15:10,687
Break formation.
Engage all hostiles.

1142
02:15:58,751 --> 02:16:01,034
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1143
02:16:11,449 --> 02:16:13,451
Jake, Jake you copy?

1144
02:16:13,772 --> 02:16:15,974
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1145
02:16:16,575 --> 02:16:18,178
Copy, get out of there.

1146
02:16:22,482 --> 02:16:24,507
That's him, get after him!

1147
02:16:40,806 --> 02:16:42,230
Take him out!

1148
02:16:46,378 --> 02:16:47,431
Oops.

1149
02:16:50,941 --> 02:16:52,945
Light her up!

1150
02:17:02,837 --> 02:17:05,041
You're not the only
one with a gun bitch.

1151
02:17:05,361 --> 02:17:07,042
Keep her in your sights!

1152
02:17:13,771 --> 02:17:15,055
That's it!

1153
02:18:50,462 --> 02:18:52,984
Rogue 1 is hit!
I'm going in!

1154
02:18:53,665 --> 02:18:55,908
Sorry Jake.

1155
02:19:03,799 --> 02:19:05,802
Fire.

1156
02:19:23,026 --> 02:19:25,629
Tsu'Tey, brother do you read?

1157
02:19:28,313 --> 02:19:30,316
Rogue 1, you copy?

1158
02:19:31,958 --> 02:19:33,438
Trudy?

1159
02:19:44,173 --> 02:19:48,060
Time to target, 2 minutes.
- Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear in hot.

1160
02:19:48,179 --> 02:19:50,662
Copy dragon, we are
starting our bomb run.

1161
02:19:56,190 --> 02:19:58,793
Fire number one!

1162
02:19:58,874 --> 02:20:00,676
Number one armed!

1163
02:20:01,597 --> 02:20:02,800
Jake!

1164
02:20:04,561 --> 02:20:06,565
I read you!

1165
02:20:14,896 --> 02:20:16,978
<i>Neytiri.</i>

1166
02:20:17,498 --> 02:20:19,702
They are very close,
there are many.

1167
02:20:21,384 --> 02:20:23,471
Do not attack.

1168
02:20:23,507 --> 02:20:24,989
<i>Do you read me Neytiri?</i>

1169
02:20:27,912 --> 02:20:29,395
Do not attack!

1170
02:20:29,634 --> 02:20:32,919
<i>Fall back now, get out of there.
That's an order!</i>

1171
02:20:40,930 --> 02:20:42,733
Neytiri!

1172
02:20:44,334 --> 02:20:45,816
<i>I've got movement.</i>

1173
02:20:46,137 --> 02:20:47,539
Hold position.

1174
02:20:47,939 --> 02:20:50,508
Something's coming.

1175
02:20:50,544 --> 02:20:52,544
We've got movement,
200 meters.

1176
02:20:52,580 --> 02:20:54,428
Get ready.

1177
02:21:17,859 --> 02:21:19,862
Get out of here!

1178
02:21:21,064 --> 02:21:23,069
Fall back!

1179
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:33,400
Jake!

1180
02:21:34,001 --> 02:21:36,205
Eywa has heard you.

1181
02:21:42,011 --> 02:21:44,215
Eywa has heard you!

1182
02:22:34,401 --> 02:22:37,084
Sir, all escorts are
down or falling back.

1183
02:22:37,126 --> 02:22:39,289
Let's get this done.

1184
02:22:39,490 --> 02:22:42,573
<i>Valkirye 1-6, this is dragon,
press the target.</i>

1185
02:22:43,095 --> 02:22:46,099
Copy, pressing the target.
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1186
02:23:06,245 --> 02:23:08,728
On my mark,
2, 1, mark.

1187
02:23:08,769 --> 02:23:11,733
Drop!

1188
02:24:03,201 --> 02:24:05,205
It's Sully!

1189
02:24:18,222 --> 02:24:20,625
Masks on!
- Breach alarm!

1190
02:26:57,355 --> 02:26:59,918
Come on, come to papa.

1191
02:27:27,155 --> 02:27:29,478
Give it up Quaritch.

1192
02:27:31,882 --> 02:27:33,804
It's all over.

1193
02:27:34,685 --> 02:27:36,887
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1194
02:27:37,169 --> 02:27:39,411
I kinda hoped you'd say that.

1195
02:28:35,647 --> 02:28:37,650
Come on!

1196
02:28:53,069 --> 02:28:57,076
Sully, how does it feel to
betray your own race?

1197
02:29:01,322 --> 02:29:03,804
You think you're
one of them?

1198
02:29:04,725 --> 02:29:07,410
Time to wake up.

1199
02:30:50,949 --> 02:30:52,951
Jake!

1200
02:31:05,448 --> 02:31:07,450
Jake...

1201
02:31:24,594 --> 02:31:26,596
Jake...

1202
02:31:42,019 --> 02:31:44,140
Jake! My Jake!

1203
02:32:25,676 --> 02:32:28,199
I see you.

1204
02:32:32,686 --> 02:32:35,369
I see you.

1205
02:32:45,502 --> 02:32:48,627
<i>The aliens went back
to their dying world.</i>

1206
02:32:50,630 --> 02:32:54,113
<i>Only a few were chosen to stay.</i>

1207
02:33:05,730 --> 02:33:09,255
<i>The time of Great Sorrow was ending.</i>

1208
02:33:10,336 --> 02:33:13,420
<i>Toruk Makto was no longer needed.</i>

1209
02:33:25,276 --> 02:33:30,163
<i>Well, I guess this is
my last video log.</i>

1210
02:33:31,083 --> 02:33:33,888
<i>Whatever happens tonight...</i>

1211
02:33:33,923 --> 02:33:36,179
<i>Either way, I'm not gonna</i>

1212
02:33:36,179 --> 02:33:40,296
<i>be coming back to this place.</i>

1213
02:33:42,298 --> 02:33:44,381
<i>Well I guess I better go.</i>

1214
02:33:47,106 --> 02:33:50,069
<i>I don't want to be late
for my own party.</i>

1215
02:33:53,474 --> 02:33:56,317
<i>It's my birthday after all.</i>

1216
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:00,802
<i>This is Jake Sully signing off.</i>
