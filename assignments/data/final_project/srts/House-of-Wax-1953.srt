1
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:55,861
You are being such a good boy.

2
00:01:56,036 --> 00:02:00,080
Would you like some more cereal,
sweetheart? Here you go.

3
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,913
He's really being a monster
again today.

4
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:07,003
Trudy, goddamn it, help me.

5
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:09,756
Can't you be more careful?

6
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:13,459
I'm doing the best I can.
He's out of control.

7
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:17,302
Sit still. Stop it!

8
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:19,015
Please hold him.

9
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:22,018
Don't do that. Stop kicking!

10
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:24,558
Why can't you be
more like your brother?

11
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:29,982
Be quiet!

12
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:32,650
Shut up!

13
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,869
There's a place in Tribeca for 3000.

14
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,581
That's too expensive. The money I
saved up won't cover two months' rent.

15
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,174
I'm gonna have to work every second
I'm not in class until graduation.

16
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:44,549
- Carly, don't even think about not going.
- I'm not.

17
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,882
Good. Because you know
how proud I am of you.

18
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,597
<i>- It's just an internship.
- At InStyle magazine.</i>

19
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,221
Or would you rather stay at
the Waffle House as a waitress forever?

20
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,724
- No, thanks.
- Yeah.

21
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,808
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

22
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:02,321
Sorry, there were these two drunk
rednecks wrestling in the bathroom.

23
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:05,408
- Really?
- There's no rednecks in New York.

24
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:08,071
No. There's not.

25
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:12,285
I'm gonna see what Blake's doing.

26
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,246
He seems to like that car
more than me nowadays.

27
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:23,794
Now that we have a second... And
I'm not trying to make this a big deal.

28
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,173
You know I want to have a good time
on our road trip this weekend.

29
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:29,839
But why did your brother
have to come with us?

30
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:32,769
You said your parents weren't
gonna post his bail anymore.

31
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:35,938
They didn't. Blake did. He invited him.

32
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:39,143
I guess Nick makes him
feel more badass, I don't know.

33
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:48,407
- Blake.
- What up, Paige?

34
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:49,952
Blake.

35
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,075
Fine.

36
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:02,922
Baby, come back here.

37
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:04,549
You know it ain't like that.

38
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:07,291
I was messing with the GPS,
and I saw a shortcut.

39
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,297
I think it'll save us an hour.

40
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:11,879
So we can spend more time...

41
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,220
Okay?

42
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:22,766
How you doing? Hello.

43
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:25,820
- What's up, crow man?
- Get a job.

44
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:27,861
That's nice. Yeah.

45
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:29,823
Here you go.

46
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:37,997
What do you think, guys?
Gonna be a sweet game tomorrow, huh?

47
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:40,793
Yeah.

48
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,371
- Dalton, please don't film me.
- What?

49
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:47,541
- I'm not filming now.
- The red light's on.

50
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:50,967
Put the camera down. She doesn't like
having people up in her face.

51
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:53,972
- She folds under pressure.
- You got something to say to me?

52
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,674
No, I think you've already spoken enough
for the both of us, don't you?

53
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:04,059
You guys are lame. I'm out of here.
See you.

54
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:22,201
Dalton, put down that damn camera.

55
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,953
God.

56
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:42,056
<i>Record crowds are expected for college
football's biggest game of the year...</i>

57
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:45,347
<i>- As Louisiana and Florida...
- It's gonna be packed tomorrow.</i>

58
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:48,274
Speaking of packed,
my legs are killing me back here, man.

59
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:52,653
Don't worry, man, it's not Wade's fault
his little Hot Wheels car only fits two.

60
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,569
It's more like a "shot wheels" car,
isn't it?

61
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:59,192
What did you do, go to the barber shop
and ask for a He-Man haircut?

62
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:03,202
Shut up, Dalton.

63
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,953
Dude.

64
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,584
You hurt me.

65
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,173
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, man.

66
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:18,376
- This sucks.
- So much for his nice little shortcut.

67
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,391
I hope he's not gonna get us lost.

68
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,891
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

69
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,688
Damn! Yo, yo, wake up. Wake up.

70
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:41,819
Oh, my God.

71
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,071
Look at her. Look at her!

72
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:45,704
- You're caught on tape.
- Hello!

73
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:48,541
Oh, my God!
What are they doing?

74
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:52,291
- Is she flossing herself with that thing?
- What are you doing?

75
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:54,289
- Look at his face.
- She's calling me.

76
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:56,540
- He's blushing.
- You are so busted.

77
00:07:56,716 --> 00:08:00,085
- Lip balm. I dropped my stupid lip balm.
- She dropped her lip balm.

78
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,636
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

79
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:04,010
You dropped your lip balm.

80
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:06,891
- What's up?
- It's getting late.

81
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:10,060
- What do you wanna do?
- Keep going, we don't even have tickets.

82
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,221
There's gonna be
a million scalpers there.

83
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:15,102
If we keep driving, there's no way
I'll stay up for the game.

84
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,564
Why don't we just camp out?
We're close enough.

85
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:20,772
Yeah, let's just pull over here. Come on.
We'll wake up early.

86
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,154
<i>- All right.
- All right, we're pulling over.</i>

87
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:24,819
All right.

88
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:32,034
Hey, wax museum.

89
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:40,707
- You like that kind of stuff, Wade?
- Yeah, I don't know. Sometimes.

90
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:44,418
I guess if you like things
pretending to be other things.

91
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:46,884
Which you obviously do. Right, sis?

92
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:01,725
- Where are we going, Blake?
- I'm just looking for some privacy.

93
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:13,663
We made it.

94
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,577
Nice.

95
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:19,159
- You like it, right?
- This is great.

96
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:22,162
Your car sucks, dude.

97
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,127
- Paige, come with me.
- Wade, you gotta get a bigger car.

98
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:26,499
- Well?
- I couldn't.

99
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:28,753
There's no point
in freaking him out now.

100
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,255
As opposed to when you find out
you are pregnant?

101
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,092
Carly, I'm not sure, okay?

102
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:35,556
I think you should
have a conversation with him.

103
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:38,183
He's been looking forward
to this game for months.

104
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:40,348
I don't wanna ruin it
by starting a fight.

105
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:43,359
Paige, he's not gonna marry you.
His parents won't let him.

106
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:46,730
Who says I want to get married?
Besides, I've been late before.

107
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:49,740
When I know for sure,
I promise to talk to him, okay?

108
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:52,236
Let's go.

109
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:59,207
There are ticks out here.

110
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:05,586
Yeah, don't help us or nothing.

111
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:09,334
- Let's set up.
- Oh, yeah.

112
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:14,924
Pass it! Pass it!

113
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:19,218
You don't wanna...
Too slow, too slow!

114
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:21,636
- Blake.
- Come on.

115
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,308
Touchdown!

116
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:46,621
Nice arm.

117
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:49,580
I see why they gave you a scholarship.

118
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:51,915
Yeah, it's a real tragedy, ain't it?

119
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:54,252
Yeah, it is.

120
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,303
Wade. Help Dalton, okay?

121
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,005
Please?

122
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:02,556
- Bye, Wade.
- Asshole.

123
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,847
You can be a prick to me, that's fine.
But he didn't do anything to you.

124
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:09,182
So you admit that you did something.

125
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:12,230
I admit, according to you,
I did something, sure.

126
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:14,983
- You dimed me out.
- I did not dime you out.

127
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:17,992
The sheriffs asked where you
got the car, I said I didn't know.

128
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,994
I didn't even know it was stolen.
You're blaming that on me?

129
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:23,653
You could have covered for me, huh?

130
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,658
You get caught stealing,
it's my fault.

131
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,324
You're resisting arrest,
and it's the cop's fault.

132
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:29,783
He took a swing at me.

133
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:32,751
Get kicked off the football team,
it's the coach's fault.

134
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:35,593
Mom and Dad kick you out of the house,
it's their fault.

135
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,879
You can't keep a job for two weeks,
it's every manager's fault.

136
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:41,296
I'm surrounded by idiots.

137
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:43,758
So why did you come?
To piss me off?

138
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:47,436
Don't you get it?

139
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:51,187
You're the good twin.

140
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:54,981
I'm the evil one.

141
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:59,281
Grow up. You are so afraid
to take things seriously.

142
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:04,526
Yeah. As afraid as Wade is of leaving
good old Gainesville?

143
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:10,208
New York City. Well, I hear
they got buildings as tall as the sky.

144
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:13,877
Okay.

145
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:25,805
Blue 42! Hut! Go, go!

146
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,683
- What's that smell?
- That's bad.

147
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:34,057
- Oh, my God.
- Dalton, did you crap your pants again?

148
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:37,355
No. I don't know. Maybe.

149
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:39,769
I mean, I'm wearing
my work clothes, so...

150
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:46,524
It's horrible.

151
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,658
- Something's dead out there.
- No, something's dead right here.

152
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,370
We need to drink it back to life.
Bless me, dog.

153
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:03,212
Come on, man.

154
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:05,093
Hi, pretty Carly.

155
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:08,297
Hey, what's Wade short for, dude?

156
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:10,713
Who?

157
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:14,262
- What up, Nick?
- Stop.

158
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:16,146
- You gonna do it tonight?
- Screw off.

159
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:19,315
- Stop.
- What? Come on, you know you want it.

160
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,434
Come on, man.
You don't gotta spray it at me, dude.

161
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,148
- Look at that.
- Keeps messing around.

162
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:27,197
God, dude.

163
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,250
- Dalton, what did I say?
- All right, my bad, my bad. Sorry.

164
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:42,333
- What? No, it's off...
- You're killing me with this thing.

165
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:45,757
- Give me that... Oh, and the tables turn.
- No, no. Come on. Don't...

166
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,548
Look how cute you are on camera,
though. You look good.

167
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:51,093
I think we might have to do
a little makeover.

168
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,591
- What do you think?
- He looks like a Smurf.

169
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:58,137
So why'd you steal that car anyway?
I mean, you didn't need to do that.

170
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:00,353
Get that rush, huh?

171
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,187
Something like that.

172
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,937
- You're coming out.
- I don't know.

173
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,781
If you don't, I will be so mad.

174
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,817
Damn, Paige.

175
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:12,447
- Look how good you look.
- Hey.

176
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:15,241
He looks like Elton John, but more gay.

177
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:18,367
- Elton John is gay?
- You look hot.

178
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,249
- Yellow is his color.
- It's in style.

179
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:23,335
Why don't you ever make me
that pretty, Carly?

180
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:29,630
- Hi.
- Hi.

181
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:33,630
Give me my camera. Come on, now.

182
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:38,884
Oh, yeah, that's good. Let me get
some of that action.

183
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,561
That's hot.

184
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:48,064
Don't even think about it.
I ain't kissing you.

185
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:51,023
Come on,
you know you want to, dude.

186
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,863
Just kidding. Psyche.
I wouldn't kiss your ass for shit.

187
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:08,879
Yeah?

188
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:13,129
- Hey, yo, man, you need something?
- What does he want?

189
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:16,132
Hey, can you turn off
your lights, please?

190
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,640
Okay, this is getting kind of creepy.

191
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:29,731
Hey, come on, man, get out of here.
Nothing to see here. Let's go.

192
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:32,691
- Can we help you?
- Maybe we're on his property.

193
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,148
- No, we didn't pass a gate.
- Hey, man, turn your lights off.

194
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:39,740
- Hello!
- Turn your lights off.

195
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:42,659
Turn them off,
or I'm whupping someone's ass.

196
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,325
It's cool, man.

197
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:50,706
Nick!

198
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,249
Oh, my...

199
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:05,804
What?

200
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:16,813
Yeah!

201
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,161
That was great. That was great, dude.

202
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:26,286
My man Nick here's hardcore.

203
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:28,614
What the hell was that about, huh?

204
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,291
- You the man, dude. That was awesome.
- Don't encourage him.

205
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:37,208
Come on, he's gone.

206
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,488
Wade. Wade.

207
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,198
Wade.

208
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,909
I heard something.

209
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,912
It's probably a serial killer
or something.

210
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,820
What are you doing?

211
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,732
You scared me.

212
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:14,611
What are you doing?

213
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:19,033
Getting you back to bed.
Come on. Let's go to sleep.

214
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:22,122
- I heard something.
- Get in that tent.

215
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:32,213
Damn it. Hey, it's 2:30! Get up!

216
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,386
Let's go, guys. Get up. Get up!

217
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:43,059
Wade, Dalton, let's go.
We're gonna miss the damn game.

218
00:19:43,228 --> 00:19:45,766
Nick. Get up!

219
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,811
Damn.

220
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:55,102
- Dude, you see my camera anywhere?
- No, man.

221
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:59,196
- You guys seen my camera?
- Like I give a shit about it.

222
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:04,247
- So you and Wade talk some more?
- We're just in different places right now.

223
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:08,282
He hasn't given me a guilt trip for going,
so I can't give him one for staying.

224
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,207
Oh, my God, there's that smell again.

225
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:18,592
- I think it's coming from over there.
- Yeah, let's go follow the smell.

226
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:20,304
What? I wanna see what it is.

227
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:22,797
- Why?
- Come on.

228
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,144
What the hell was that?

229
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:34,564
No way.

230
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:39,737
Are you serious? It was brand-new.

231
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:43,111
Someone's fucking with me.

232
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:46,074
I cannot believe
you're making me do this.

233
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,658
Only you.

234
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:50,655
- Come on, it'll be fine.
- I'm gonna throw up.

235
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:53,830
Oh, my God. I hate you.

236
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:58,466
Carly!

237
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,681
- Carly!
- Paige!

238
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,892
- Are you okay?
- I'm stuck!

239
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,597
Wade! Please help me
get out of here!

240
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,352
We're down here!

241
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,651
Guys, help us!

242
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,113
- Guys! Get down here!
- Carly! Carly!

243
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,078
- Hey! Hey!
- I can't get out.

244
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,413
- I'm here, hold on! Hold on, baby.
- Wade, where are you?

245
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,991
- Carly. I'm right here.
- Carly!

246
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,131
Here. Grab me, baby. Come on.
Come on. I got you. Get up here.

247
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,297
You all right? Oh, man.

248
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,799
There's a roadkill pit down here.

249
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,844
- Yeah, that smells about right.
- Baby, you okay?

250
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,261
I got you.

251
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,599
It's okay.

252
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,933
Hey, is that the truck from last night?

253
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,229
Not unless he fixed his headlight.

254
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:33,932
Hey!

255
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:35,720
Don't you see that?

256
00:22:37,062 --> 00:22:38,390
What is that?

257
00:22:57,915 --> 00:22:59,409
No way.

258
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,576
What are you doing, man?

259
00:23:05,965 --> 00:23:08,290
Anyone need a hand?

260
00:23:10,678 --> 00:23:11,958
I'm just fooling.

261
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:14,175
It's not real, see?

262
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:17,423
God.

263
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:20,685
I found it on the side of the road
a few weeks ago.

264
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,226
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Sorry we took so long.

265
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:25,604
- It's all right.
- What are you guys doing here?

266
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:28,812
We were all camping up
through those trees.

267
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:31,946
- I have water in here somewhere. God.
- Oh, good.

268
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:33,739
You guys seen my camera?

269
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:35,777
- Are you kidding?
- No.

270
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:39,364
- Damn.
- Hey, is there a gas station around here?

271
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,374
- Well, I got some gas in the truck if...
- I need a fan belt.

272
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,167
What?

273
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:47,538
- Just busted.
- Of course. Perfect.

274
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,331
Bo might have one.
Runs a station in Ambrose.

275
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,337
- Where's that?
- Fifteen miles up the road.

276
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,049
- Let's just get one in Baton Rouge.
- Man, there's no way I'm leaving my car.

277
00:23:59,224 --> 00:24:03,091
- What if the guy from last night strips it?
- You're gonna miss the game, then.

278
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:06,433
Yeah, well, that's not why I came.

279
00:24:07,774 --> 00:24:11,225
All right. I'll run you up to the
station. Kickoff's in a couple hours.

280
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:14,487
You're already late.
You still gotta snag tickets.

281
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,944
Y'all should just go now.
I'll stay with my car.

282
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:20,616
It's fine. Get me a fan belt on the
way back. Make sure it's a 15-inch.

283
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:22,411
- Gotcha.
- I'll give you a ride.

284
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,198
- You serious?
- If you like.

285
00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:31,829
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- That's cool?

286
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,915
Yeah, if it's cool.

287
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,458
- I'm going with you.
- Carly, no.

288
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:39,340
- Yes. It'll be fine.
- All right, let's go.

289
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:41,007
Come on, Paige.

290
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,008
- Carly.
- What?

291
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,388
I'll leave tickets at will call.

292
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,521
- Thank you.
- All right. All good, man.

293
00:24:50,815 --> 00:24:52,475
Come on, babe.

294
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:07,329
Oh, it's okay.

295
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,950
Come on, baby.
So let's get out of here.

296
00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:19,462
Man, you're just gonna let them
leave like that?

297
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:22,126
With a guy who throws roadkill
in a pit for a living?

298
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,507
You clean shit for a living,
Mr. Septic-Tank-Man.

299
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:27,141
What's the difference?

300
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:29,301
Well, I don't walk through it,
that's one.

301
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:32,308
That's a difference, right?

302
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:19,351
- Can you roll the window down, please?
- Yeah.

303
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:25,315
Sorry about that.
Truck's seen better days.

304
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:30,240
Do you mind rolling down
your window, then?

305
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:33,116
Not at all.

306
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,959
Sorry. I kind of get used to the smell.

307
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:45,247
Really? I don't think
I could ever get used to it.

308
00:26:45,426 --> 00:26:49,126
Well, you can get used to anything
if you're around it long enough.

309
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:53,597
If you get them in the early morning
before the sun bakes them up...

310
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:54,965
they're not so bad.

311
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:57,930
If they're fresh, though,
I just take them home.

312
00:26:58,104 --> 00:26:59,931
Why waste the meat?

313
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:06,393
- Are we almost there yet?
- It's just up the road.

314
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:09,941
Yep, Ambrose used to be
a pretty nice town...

315
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:13,030
before the interstate came in.

316
00:27:15,997 --> 00:27:17,407
You like knives.

317
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:20,072
- Not really.
- Tools of the trade. You wanna see it?

318
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:22,621
That's okay.

319
00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:26,211
It's a bowie. It's a good knife.

320
00:27:26,382 --> 00:27:28,089
That'll cut through anything.

321
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:37,673
What's going on?
You said there was a town up here.

322
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:41,594
Well, yeah, there is.
It's just around that bend.

323
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:45,436
I gotta flip my hubs into four-wheel.
You mind giving me a hand?

324
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:48,099
When's the last time
that you were here?

325
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:51,944
What, you don't believe me?

326
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,443
I forgot this way in's washed out,
that's all.

327
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:59,110
We'll walk the rest of the way.
You've done enough.

328
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:01,032
Now, why would you want to do that?

329
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:04,030
Look, we wanna walk, okay?
Just let us out now.

330
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,124
Sure.

331
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,769
Well, get out, then.

332
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,817
Try and do something nice
for someone...

333
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:36,819
- It's not like that. We appreciate it.
- Yeah, I can tell.

334
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:56,381
Is he still staring?

335
00:28:57,553 --> 00:29:00,589
- Yeah. Just keep walking.
- Oh, like I'm gonna stop.

336
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:05,677
Damn.

337
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:09,553
- Now I feel like a real asshole.
- I don't care. That guy was a freak.

338
00:29:23,703 --> 00:29:25,779
Dude, it's over.

339
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:27,698
It'll move.

340
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:33,202
It's not moving.

341
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:35,916
- We'll make the second half.
- I'm not sitting in this.

342
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,497
- What do you want me to do?
- We have to go back.

343
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:40,585
- Turn around.
- I'm not missing this game.

344
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:43,548
- Turn the car around, okay?
- They're waiting for us already.

345
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,725
Slow down, speedy. God.

346
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:52,604
Miss Ambrose.

347
00:29:52,897 --> 00:29:56,064
Wonder how many teeth
you have to have to win that one.

348
00:29:58,987 --> 00:30:00,730
- This is kind of nice.
- Yeah.

349
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:03,733
Oh, wait. Babe, there's a pet store.

350
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:05,782
- Oh, great.
- Come on.

351
00:30:06,494 --> 00:30:09,910
Are those puppies? Oh, my God.
Look at them.

352
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:12,654
They're cute. Adorable.
Maybe next time. Come on.

353
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,661
Come on.

354
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:27,512
Hello?

355
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:33,811
Hello?

356
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:39,608
- You see anybody?
- No, nobody.

357
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,151
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. We're heading back.</i>

358
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:46,651
Really? Why? What happened?

359
00:30:46,824 --> 00:30:49,944
<i>Traffic. Did you get that fan belt
thing or whatever?</i>

360
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,986
No. There's no one at the gas station.
I don't know where we're going now.

361
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:56,038
<i>So where do you want us
to pick you up?</i>

362
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:59,079
Just head up the road that we got off at
for the campsite.

363
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,922
It's washed out at the end.
Call us when you get there.

364
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:03,287
<i>Continuing coverage...</i>

365
00:31:03,465 --> 00:31:08,257
<i>We'll camp where we did yesterday,
but away from that pet cemetery.</i>

366
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:09,970
Cool. See you then.

367
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:15,390
- There's that house of wax.
- Wade, what about the fan belt?

368
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,474
- Well, there's no one at the station.
- Let's ask someone in the church.

369
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:21,973
All right. All right.

370
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:34,076
Let us all bow our heads and say
a prayer for our beloved deceased friend.

371
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,210
- We should go.
- Yeah.

372
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:43,706
<i>Sorry.</i>

373
00:31:48,884 --> 00:31:51,920
- What do we do, just wait out here?
- I don't know.

374
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:56,342
I feel kind of messed up waiting outside
a church for a funeral to end.

375
00:31:57,893 --> 00:32:00,181
Hey, sorry about walking in.
We didn't know...

376
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:02,097
You shouldn't have walked in.

377
00:32:02,272 --> 00:32:05,972
Yeah, I know. It's just that we have
car trouble. We're not from this town.

378
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,724
We were looking for Bo.
He works at the gas station.

379
00:32:08,903 --> 00:32:10,231
You found him.

380
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,942
Really? Well, we need a fan belt.

381
00:32:15,117 --> 00:32:17,193
- We were camping up the road...
- A fan belt?

382
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,401
Yeah.

383
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:22,030
You walk in on a funeral
for a fucking fan belt?

384
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:27,250
Well, let me just go dump the casket
in the ground. I'll be right there.

385
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:30,338
- Look, we're sorry.
- Yeah.

386
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,679
That's twice today. I'm an asshole.

387
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,015
- Let's just go back to the road.
- Hey.

388
00:32:48,691 --> 00:32:52,226
Hey, I'm sorry. You know,
someone very special to me passed.

389
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:56,567
- And I didn't mean to take it out on you.
- No, no, no. It's totally understandable.

390
00:32:58,284 --> 00:32:59,992
I reckon things will wrap up soon.

391
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:03,280
Why don't I meet you guys back
at the station in about a half?

392
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:06,409
- That'd be great, if that's okay.
- Yeah.

393
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,584
Great.

394
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:18,422
What?

395
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:24,098
Nothing. Looks like your fan club's
gotten a little bigger.

396
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:27,514
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I am serious.

397
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:29,810
It's obvious Dalton
still has a crush on you.

398
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:31,772
Oh, my God.

399
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:35,773
Okay, that's three times today.
You're an asshole.

400
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:38,436
Let's go see
your famous house of wax.

401
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:42,776
But I'm still your favorite asshole,
right?

402
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:44,779
Always.

403
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:37,163
I don't know what you expect
to see in here.

404
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:51,594
It is wax. Like, literally.

405
00:34:56,606 --> 00:35:00,189
- You're not gonna go in there, are you?
- Yeah.

406
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,901
Doesn't "closed" mean
"I don't want you in here"?

407
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:13,118
Relax. I just wanna take a quick look.

408
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:16,826
- What if someone's here?
- Hello?

409
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:19,289
Anyone in here?

410
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,370
See? We're fine.

411
00:35:22,631 --> 00:35:27,044
How cool is this? Everything in here
is wax. The floor, the walls.

412
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:30,089
- Look at this. This is wax.
- Yeah. Cool. Awesome.

413
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,894
- Who are these people supposed to be?
- I don't know.

414
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:42,064
Aren't there supposed to be
famous people in a wax museum?

415
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:45,607
I don't recognize this guy.

416
00:35:47,363 --> 00:35:50,399
"Trudy opens House of Wax."

417
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:54,525
"Trudy's wax carvings are a hit
at the state fair."

418
00:35:54,995 --> 00:35:58,578
"Trudy and husband
are expecting first child."

419
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:01,454
Since when is a wax sculptor
a celebrity?

420
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:05,078
- I don't know. Small town, I guess.
- That's right. You like small towns.

421
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:07,414
I didn't say I wasn't gonna
like New York...

422
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:09,833
I just said I haven't
made a decision yet.

423
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,883
I still have time, all right?

424
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,628
Well, I'd really like you
to be there with me.

425
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:16,971
"Oh, no. There's a fire.
Help me, Carly."

426
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,059
I'm melting. My skirt's gonna catch fire.
My legs are burned.

427
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:22,386
- Cut it out, please.
- "You're my hero."

428
00:36:22,564 --> 00:36:24,022
That's not cool.

429
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:28,234
Hey, Car. There's a dog for you.

430
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:31,736
Hey, puppy. You a little wax dog too?
What up, dog?

431
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,319
Jesus!

432
00:36:38,787 --> 00:36:40,661
That is cool.

433
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,705
Yeah, laugh it up.

434
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:45,747
What's a dog doing in here anyway?

435
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:03,894
"Vincent"?

436
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:10,642
Another Vincent.

437
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:17,611
This Vincent guy's quite the artist.

438
00:37:17,783 --> 00:37:20,903
Yeah, I think this Vincent guy
needs therapy.

439
00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:28,824
I mean, look how detailed this is.
Tell me this doesn't look real.

440
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:30,623
I don't really care.

441
00:37:30,837 --> 00:37:33,589
I mean, not that it's bad,
but everything made out of wax?

442
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:35,963
Don't you think that's a little weird?

443
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:41,214
Those aren't wax.

444
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:44,175
Oh, whatever.

445
00:37:44,434 --> 00:37:46,473
When do you think
the last person was here?

446
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:48,186
A while, probably.

447
00:37:52,066 --> 00:37:54,391
- What? What is it?
- I just saw someone.

448
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:59,022
- It was probably just a wax thing.
- No, no.

449
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:02,199
It wasn't a wax thing. It was moving
and it was freaky-looking.

450
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:04,111
I'll go check it out.

451
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:07,081
Wade, where are you going?
Don't leave me.

452
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,370
- Wade, come on.
- Hang here a second.

453
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:11,700
No. Wait.

454
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,892
- What's wrong?
- This place is freaking me out.

455
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,821
- Calm down. There's no one here.
- Please, I just wanna go.

456
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,693
Okay. Okay. We'll go
to the station, then.

457
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,326
Oh, dude, I had to pee so bad, man.

458
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,124
Come on, dude.

459
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,001
Hey, you guys gonna have sex?

460
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,411
- What?
- Because me and Paige are.

461
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,498
- So you two go pick them up.
- All right.

462
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,502
- Hey, Paige.
- Yeah?

463
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:32,345
- Nick and Dalton are gonna go get them.
- Why? We can go.

464
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:36,462
- Oh, baby. Come on, I'm tired of driving.
- Okay.

465
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:39,597
Why don't you let my man drive.

466
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:41,180
Really?

467
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:44,394
- You heard him. Move.
- Give me the damn keys.

468
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:47,235
Okay. Very slow. Thank you.

469
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:50,815
I don't think this is cool,
just coming in like this.

470
00:40:50,988 --> 00:40:53,111
What? Look, the door was unlocked.

471
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:55,738
He said he'd be half an hour,
he's been 45 minutes.

472
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,238
I'm sure he won't mind.

473
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,365
You know, if your brother and
his yes man hadn't come along...

474
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:03,493
we would've fit with Blake.
None of this would've happened.

475
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,660
Once again, that's not my fault.

476
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:08,955
I don't understand his beef with me.
I've tried to be cool with him.

477
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:12,084
Nick's got beef with everybody.
You can't take it personally.

478
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:13,290
Yeah, I guess.

479
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:17,335
Nick and I always used to stick together,
and then when we were in junior high...

480
00:41:17,514 --> 00:41:21,594
Nick would get into trouble here and
there and our parents would always...

481
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:23,926
compare us. I was the good twin...

482
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:26,890
and Nick was the evil twin,
as he likes to say.

483
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:28,981
He kind of got this image.

484
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,230
He totally played it up as if
that's what he had to be or something.

485
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:38,693
It's already getting dark.
I hate the winter.

486
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:42,319
He's got everything but a 15-inch.

487
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:45,285
I'll just have to use a 16-inch.

488
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:48,702
- Make it work somehow.
- You plan on stealing that?

489
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:52,624
No. We didn't know how much longer
you were gonna be...

490
00:41:52,798 --> 00:41:55,205
and, you know, we didn't
wanna interrupt again.

491
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:58,586
I left you money on the counter,
but you don't have the right size.

492
00:41:58,762 --> 00:42:01,335
- You don't have any 15-inches.
- I do at the house.

493
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:04,349
I hope you're not getting
the wrong idea that we're in here.

494
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:06,059
No, it's okay.

495
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:10,185
- Does that cover it?
- It's close enough.

496
00:42:10,356 --> 00:42:13,392
Why don't we get the one you need?
It's only a couple of blocks.

497
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:16,058
- Yeah, all right.
- You keep fan belts at your house?

498
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:18,443
I get things delivered there
when I'm not here.

499
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:21,070
If you wanna hold on to the 16,
that's fine by me.

500
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:23,281
No, no, no. It's okay.

501
00:42:25,704 --> 00:42:27,910
Hey, you mind if I use
your restroom real fast?

502
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:30,204
Oh, up at the house.
That one's out of order.

503
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,786
All right.

504
00:42:35,505 --> 00:42:39,170
So is it too late to sign Carly up
for that beauty pageant?

505
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:43,542
Now, unfortunately it is, because
you would've won hands down.

506
00:42:43,805 --> 00:42:45,963
- Thank you.
- That house of wax is pretty cool.

507
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,683
- You went inside?
- Yeah.

508
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,926
Yeah, it was unlocked,
so, you know...

509
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:53,556
Everything seems to be unlocked
around you, now don't it?

510
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:58,228
Yeah, people used to come to see it
from miles away.

511
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:02,316
And Trudy was the main...
I guess "artist" is the appropriate word.

512
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,316
What about Vincent?

513
00:43:05,034 --> 00:43:08,865
- I saw his name on a lot of the work.
- He was one of Trudy's boys.

514
00:43:09,037 --> 00:43:11,611
- They still around?
- No, no. It's a horrible story.

515
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,910
Trudy's husband, Doc Sinclair,
he was a doctor in the big city...

516
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:18,335
until he got his license revoked
for doing surgeries on the side.

517
00:43:18,505 --> 00:43:21,126
Stuff that, you know,
most doctors wouldn't dare do.

518
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,170
So he moved him and Trudy
out here to Ambrose...

519
00:43:24,511 --> 00:43:26,966
made a fresh start
with his medical practice...

520
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:31,266
and Trudy really found her calling
with that whole wax-sculpture thing.

521
00:43:31,517 --> 00:43:34,637
It was her dream to do something
really incredible here.

522
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,852
Then she had a couple kids,
picket fence.

523
00:43:37,023 --> 00:43:38,683
- What's horrible about that?
- Yeah.

524
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:42,108
Trudy got a cyst in her brain.
She just started rotting away.

525
00:43:42,278 --> 00:43:44,519
Couldn't work no more,
and she went crazy.

526
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:48,148
Things got so bad that Doc Sinclair
finally had to strap her to the bed.

527
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,650
The whole town
could hear her screaming.

528
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:54,328
Dr. Sinclair was so depressed
that he couldn't save her...

529
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:57,071
- He blew his head right off.
- That's terrible.

530
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,539
It was worse for the boys,
left alone like that.

531
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:02,416
They both ended up in foster homes.

532
00:44:03,882 --> 00:44:05,341
Hey, why don't you two hop in.

533
00:44:05,508 --> 00:44:08,509
I'll go get the fan belt,
and I'll give you a ride to your car.

534
00:44:08,678 --> 00:44:12,094
Actually, we've got friends picking
us up where the road's washed out.

535
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:15,266
I'll give you a lift. Least I could do
for making y'all wait.

536
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:16,763
- Cool.
- All right.

537
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,387
- You need to use the facilities, right?
- Yeah. Thanks.

538
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,272
- Need to use the can?
- No, it's okay. I'm fine.

539
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:27,236
All right.

540
00:44:37,122 --> 00:44:40,573
- So where you heading to anyway?
- We're just going to a football game.

541
00:44:41,668 --> 00:44:43,708
The bathroom is right down the hall.

542
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:47,082
Let me get out of this jacket and tie,
and I'll grab your fan belt.

543
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:48,881
Okay. Thanks.

544
00:45:21,957 --> 00:45:24,495
Just let me drive, bitch.
He gave me the keys, man.

545
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:28,001
Yeah, because he thinks I'm the one
who stole the car and crashed it.

546
00:45:28,588 --> 00:45:30,877
Whatever. You didn't
have to cover for me, dude.

547
00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:34,418
Your jacket's clean, all right?
Mine's already got plenty of stains.

548
00:45:34,594 --> 00:45:36,919
One more's not gonna
make a difference.

549
00:45:40,892 --> 00:45:44,011
Where the hell is this place?
Town's not even on the GPS.

550
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:45,764
That's weird.

551
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,628
Hello?

552
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:30,302
Hello?

553
00:48:33,307 --> 00:48:35,181
Hello?

554
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,102
I'm in here!

555
00:48:38,854 --> 00:48:40,894
Hello? I'm in here.

556
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:46,433
Hey.

557
00:48:48,656 --> 00:48:50,315
Hello?

558
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:52,484
Hello.

559
00:49:52,717 --> 00:49:54,092
Come on.

560
00:50:07,398 --> 00:50:09,556
<i>Hey, it's Blake.
You know what to do.</i>

561
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:11,726
Guys, where the hell are you?

562
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:14,571
Remember the truck that came
to the campsite last night?

563
00:50:14,738 --> 00:50:16,398
I think we just ran into him.

564
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:23,993
- Where's Wade?
- Oh, he's not out here?

565
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:29,199
Guess he's still in the bathroom, then.
I got the fan belt.

566
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,080
You're not in a hurry, are you?

567
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:34,837
Because I wanted to load
the truck up with some stuff first.

568
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:38,258
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for Wade.

569
00:50:42,557 --> 00:50:43,802
Open the damn door.

570
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:46,760
This is my truck.

571
00:50:47,103 --> 00:50:48,680
Hey, what is the matter with you?

572
00:50:48,854 --> 00:50:51,345
If you don't open this door,
I'm gonna call the cops.

573
00:50:51,524 --> 00:50:53,730
You're the guy from the campsite.

574
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:00,353
Wade!

575
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:02,522
- What are you doing?
- Wade!

576
00:51:02,701 --> 00:51:04,859
Get out of the truck. Stop it.

577
00:51:05,537 --> 00:51:08,704
I'm just trying to help you.
Give me the keys. Hey. Hey.

578
00:51:08,874 --> 00:51:11,199
Stop it, or I'm calling the cops.

579
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:23,151
So...

580
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,858
you think Carly and Wade
are gonna stay together...

581
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:27,573
when she moves to New York?

582
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:30,066
Because she be looking
at me sometimes like...

583
00:52:30,243 --> 00:52:32,734
- Dalton, it ain't happening.
- What? What do you mean?

584
00:52:32,913 --> 00:52:35,071
And even if it was happening...

585
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:37,620
it ain't happening. Nothing personal.

586
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:40,462
Why? You like me better
than Wade, right?

587
00:52:40,628 --> 00:52:42,538
Wade's not so bad.

588
00:52:45,216 --> 00:52:47,209
Yeah, I like Wade too.

589
00:56:01,572 --> 00:56:04,407
Help. Please, somebody.

590
00:56:04,574 --> 00:56:05,855
Please.

591
00:56:06,535 --> 00:56:07,993
Please help me.

592
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,948
No.

593
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,682
What? What?

594
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:47,963
I'm sorry, Mama.
These people just have no respect.

595
00:59:03,371 --> 00:59:05,779
Help! Help, please!

596
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:07,914
Will you help, please?! Over here!

597
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:11,369
Help me!

598
00:59:12,046 --> 00:59:14,371
What are you gonna do to me?

599
00:59:25,976 --> 00:59:28,847
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

600
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,805
Well, should we drive through it,
you think?

601
00:59:32,149 --> 00:59:35,150
- Through all that?
- I don't know. I could do it.

602
00:59:41,616 --> 00:59:43,276
That's what I thought.

603
00:59:46,788 --> 00:59:50,157
Put me down! No.

604
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:52,828
No.

605
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:15,641
Let me go!

606
01:00:27,452 --> 01:00:28,827
Please.

607
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:42,084
Hello?

608
01:00:45,177 --> 01:00:47,217
Carly? Wade? Hello?

609
01:00:47,555 --> 01:00:49,132
Dalton!

610
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,893
All right. Listen.

611
01:00:54,061 --> 01:00:58,011
One word, and this is going
through your throat. Yeah?

612
01:01:00,984 --> 01:01:03,938
Man, there's music playing,
but I don't think anyone's here.

613
01:01:04,446 --> 01:01:06,355
No one's here.

614
01:01:07,824 --> 01:01:09,449
Where you going?

615
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,911
To that grocery store we passed.
I'm thirsty.

616
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:15,487
Well, what about your sister
and Wade, man?

617
01:01:15,832 --> 01:01:18,038
Maybe they're at the store.

618
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:21,336
What?

619
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,587
I don't know.
We came all this way.

620
01:01:23,756 --> 01:01:27,207
- Shouldn't we just look for them?
- Check it. I'm gonna go this way.

621
01:01:27,385 --> 01:01:30,469
Go that way. We don't find them,
meet here, go back to the road.

622
01:01:30,638 --> 01:01:33,045
- Cool?
- Okay.

623
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:48,440
Yo, paying customer.

624
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:51,532
Hello?

625
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:13,920
- Don't move.
- Now what are you do...?

626
01:02:14,305 --> 01:02:15,929
It's okay.

627
01:02:19,184 --> 01:02:20,928
Just stay still.

628
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:26,274
It's a shame we have to close
that pretty mouth of yours.

629
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:31,445
Especially with the way
those lips curve.

630
01:03:22,912 --> 01:03:24,620
Hey.

631
01:03:24,998 --> 01:03:27,121
I'm looking for my sister
and her boyfriend.

632
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:29,990
They were looking for a fan belt
or something.

633
01:03:31,963 --> 01:03:33,836
I don't think I've seen them.

634
01:03:34,006 --> 01:03:36,248
This is the only gas station
in town, right?

635
01:03:36,425 --> 01:03:38,003
That's right.

636
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:43,881
Yeah, then they were definitely here.

637
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:46,805
I just told you, I didn't see them.

638
01:03:47,686 --> 01:03:49,513
Does somebody else work here?

639
01:03:49,688 --> 01:03:52,605
No, I own the station.
And I would've seen them.

640
01:03:52,774 --> 01:03:57,104
Well, I was just here a few minutes ago,
and you didn't see me.

641
01:03:57,446 --> 01:04:01,490
- You weren't even here.
- Sorry. Can't help you.

642
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,660
- What was that?
- Nothing. That was just my dog.

643
01:04:15,254 --> 01:04:16,713
Actually, you know what?

644
01:04:17,048 --> 01:04:20,997
My brother Vincent was down here for
a while. He could've helped your sister.

645
01:04:21,385 --> 01:04:23,212
They could be up at the house.

646
01:04:28,726 --> 01:04:32,059
- No, my friend went that way earlier.
- Really?

647
01:04:32,396 --> 01:04:35,100
Well, maybe he ran into my brother
up there, then.

648
01:04:51,998 --> 01:04:54,952
- Wanna head up to the house?
- Yeah, whatever.

649
01:05:11,266 --> 01:05:14,801
So, what's your sister
look like anyway?

650
01:05:18,106 --> 01:05:20,313
Nick! Nick, help me!

651
01:05:26,114 --> 01:05:28,901
Please help me! I'm down here!

652
01:05:56,727 --> 01:05:58,636
- Nick!
- Carly!

653
01:05:58,812 --> 01:06:00,093
I'm downstairs!

654
01:06:03,066 --> 01:06:05,640
- Thank God.
- Jesus.

655
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,278
Okay. I'm here. I got you.

656
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,157
- Okay.
- Here.

657
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:16,154
Watch my finger. Watch my finger.

658
01:06:16,371 --> 01:06:18,162
Oh, my God.

659
01:06:18,581 --> 01:06:20,159
He did this to you?

660
01:06:28,174 --> 01:06:29,834
Where is he?

661
01:06:32,511 --> 01:06:35,547
- Where is he?
- I locked him out.

662
01:06:36,098 --> 01:06:39,301
- Where the hell's Wade?
- I don't know. He went into the house.

663
01:06:39,476 --> 01:06:41,101
This place is a freak show.

664
01:06:54,491 --> 01:06:55,901
Hello?

665
01:06:58,244 --> 01:06:59,988
Hello? Anyone here?

666
01:07:02,165 --> 01:07:03,991
Carly, Wade.

667
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:06,161
Hello?

668
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:12,208
Anyone here?

669
01:07:15,845 --> 01:07:17,967
This is a weird place.

670
01:07:20,474 --> 01:07:22,134
Hello?

671
01:07:23,602 --> 01:07:25,144
Anyone home?

672
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:29,935
Carly? Carly?

673
01:07:30,108 --> 01:07:32,315
Wade, what the hell
are you doing, bro?

674
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:34,644
Everyone's waiting for you
at the campsite.

675
01:07:38,742 --> 01:07:40,152
Wade?

676
01:07:45,832 --> 01:07:47,623
Holy shit, man.

677
01:07:48,459 --> 01:07:51,662
Hold tight, man. Hold tight.
I'm gonna get you out of this.

678
01:07:55,466 --> 01:07:57,542
All right, I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

679
01:07:59,845 --> 01:08:01,423
Oh, my God.

680
01:08:03,182 --> 01:08:06,266
All right, all right.
What happened to you, man?

681
01:08:07,477 --> 01:08:08,972
Holy...

682
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:28,614
Hold on. Just hold on.

683
01:08:43,512 --> 01:08:45,339
No, no, don't...

684
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:09,024
He's leaving.

685
01:09:17,378 --> 01:09:19,121
All right, stay here.

686
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,591
Yeah.

687
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:34,510
All right. Car's by the road.
Damn it, Dalton's got the keys.

688
01:09:35,729 --> 01:09:37,271
Dalton.

689
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,646
We gotta call the cops.

690
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:46,697
Shit.

691
01:09:47,532 --> 01:09:49,690
Hey, where's your cell phone?

692
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:53,984
It might be in the truck
up near the house.

693
01:09:54,163 --> 01:09:56,072
What about Wade?
I think he has him too.

694
01:09:56,249 --> 01:09:58,740
- What if he turns him to wax?
- What do you mean, wax?

695
01:09:58,918 --> 01:10:02,583
You don't get it.
They're all wax, everyone.

696
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,299
No, wait.

697
01:10:08,552 --> 01:10:10,545
There was a woman in here.

698
01:10:10,929 --> 01:10:13,420
She was alive.
She pulled the curtain back.

699
01:10:38,915 --> 01:10:40,991
The whole town is rigged.

700
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:42,709
That's impossible.

701
01:10:49,091 --> 01:10:51,878
You're saying that
that's a real person...

702
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:54,595
- Underneath?
- Yes.

703
01:10:54,763 --> 01:10:56,637
At the church, they were all like that.

704
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,972
At least 20 more.

705
01:11:14,115 --> 01:11:15,859
Come here, baby.

706
01:11:43,143 --> 01:11:44,970
Shit.

707
01:12:07,124 --> 01:12:08,535
Come here, sexy.

708
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:18,882
Baby, we need to talk.

709
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:23,213
- I really need to talk to you.
- What's up with the music?

710
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,136
What?

711
01:12:27,019 --> 01:12:29,260
I'm not sure, and I don't wanna
freak you out...

712
01:12:29,438 --> 01:12:31,347
- Wait, hold on.
- I need to tell you this.

713
01:12:31,523 --> 01:12:34,559
- I'm just gonna go handle the music.
- No, let me just tell you...

714
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:35,979
Blake.

715
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:38,904
Goddamn it. I need to talk to you
for a minute.

716
01:12:39,072 --> 01:12:40,863
Blake!

717
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,248
<i>Guys, where the hell are you?</i>

718
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:54,086
<i>Remember the truck that came
to the campsite last night?</i>

719
01:12:54,253 --> 01:12:56,127
<i>I think we just ran into him.</i>

720
01:12:56,797 --> 01:12:59,917
<i>- Where's Wade?
- He's still in the bathroom, then.</i>

721
01:13:00,092 --> 01:13:02,500
<i>- What are you doing?
- Waiting for Wade.</i>

722
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,717
<i>This is my truck.</i>

723
01:13:04,888 --> 01:13:07,047
<i>You're the guy from the campsite.</i>

724
01:13:28,161 --> 01:13:29,703
Blake?

725
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:35,994
Blake?

726
01:13:46,595 --> 01:13:48,054
No!

727
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:57,078
- He said he had a brother, right?
- Yeah.

728
01:17:57,253 --> 01:17:58,711
Vincent.

729
01:17:59,171 --> 01:18:01,579
At the house of wax,
he did all the sculptures.

730
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:04,509
He's gotta be the one
that does the wax.

731
01:18:04,676 --> 01:18:06,752
- What if he's around here somewhere?
- Yeah.

732
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,008
Wait.

733
01:18:10,307 --> 01:18:13,592
Nick, what are you doing?
You gotta be careful.

734
01:18:13,768 --> 01:18:15,975
I am being careful.

735
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:26,191
No, no, no. It'll make too much noise.

736
01:18:26,364 --> 01:18:29,115
Why do you have to be
so damn stubborn? He will find us.

737
01:18:29,283 --> 01:18:31,027
Yeah, chances are he will anyway.

738
01:18:31,202 --> 01:18:33,408
At least with this,
he might not wanna find us.

739
01:18:39,335 --> 01:18:40,877
That's about right.

740
01:18:51,471 --> 01:18:53,096
Go, Carly. Run!

741
01:19:44,314 --> 01:19:46,353
I know you're in here.

742
01:21:02,264 --> 01:21:03,378
Nick!

743
01:21:19,489 --> 01:21:21,446
<i>Edwin, you certainly can play,
can't you?</i>

744
01:21:21,616 --> 01:21:24,533
<i>And you certainly can sing.</i>

745
01:21:56,941 --> 01:21:59,148
Empty shells.

746
01:22:01,946 --> 01:22:03,689
Check him for ammo.

747
01:22:23,467 --> 01:22:25,376
There's nothing in his pockets.

748
01:22:28,096 --> 01:22:29,970
Give me this.

749
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:36,223
Nick, let's get out of here.

750
01:22:36,396 --> 01:22:38,187
Let's go.

751
01:22:45,488 --> 01:22:49,817
- Is there anybody left alive in this town?
- What about this Vincent guy?

752
01:22:49,992 --> 01:22:53,408
Who knows if there even is a Vincent.
We gotta get out of this place.

753
01:22:53,579 --> 01:22:57,114
Look, what about Wade and Dalton?
We can't just leave them behind.

754
01:22:58,834 --> 01:23:02,369
- You said your cell phones in the truck?
- Yeah.

755
01:23:02,755 --> 01:23:04,628
All right, this is what we're gonna do.

756
01:23:04,798 --> 01:23:08,249
I'm gonna go to the truck and get
your phone, and see if I can get help.

757
01:23:08,969 --> 01:23:11,804
- Go back to the road. Paige and Blake...
- No way. No.

758
01:23:11,972 --> 01:23:14,545
- I'm not leaving you.
- Why do you have to be so...

759
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:17,179
damn stubborn?

760
01:23:21,689 --> 01:23:25,936
Okay. We stick together,
nothing's gonna happen to us.

761
01:23:26,694 --> 01:23:28,069
Yeah.

762
01:23:28,488 --> 01:23:29,816
Come on.

763
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:36,285
That way.

764
01:23:38,831 --> 01:23:42,911
- It's under the front seat.
- Nice parking job.

765
01:23:55,347 --> 01:23:57,055
It's not in there.

766
01:24:01,478 --> 01:24:02,936
Wade and Dalton.

767
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,306
Wade went in there
and never came out.

768
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:08,936
All right.

769
01:24:09,861 --> 01:24:11,438
We'll go in quick, one pass.

770
01:24:12,029 --> 01:24:15,363
If we can't find them,
we have to get the hell out of here.

771
01:24:15,533 --> 01:24:16,861
Yeah.

772
01:24:19,995 --> 01:24:21,324
Let's try the back.

773
01:24:38,054 --> 01:24:39,714
Stay close.

774
01:25:46,162 --> 01:25:47,656
Dalton?

775
01:25:49,581 --> 01:25:51,124
Wade?

776
01:25:55,003 --> 01:25:58,123
Nick. Nick, there's guns.

777
01:26:20,069 --> 01:26:22,109
It's bolted to the wall.

778
01:26:23,489 --> 01:26:26,158
There's gotta be a key
around here somewhere.

779
01:28:11,593 --> 01:28:13,217
Fuck!

780
01:29:12,401 --> 01:29:13,682
No.

781
01:29:51,272 --> 01:29:53,099
Goddamn it.

782
01:29:56,235 --> 01:29:59,438
I told him not to do that.

783
01:30:01,532 --> 01:30:04,201
Hey, you don't ever leave here
without me.

784
01:30:04,368 --> 01:30:07,488
You know better than that.
Don't be so stupid.

785
01:30:07,663 --> 01:30:09,406
What's the matter with you?

786
01:30:15,754 --> 01:30:17,213
Don't.

787
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:20,206
I said, don't. Get.

788
01:30:20,383 --> 01:30:21,842
Get.

789
01:30:22,093 --> 01:30:23,374
Fucking freak.

790
01:30:50,621 --> 01:30:54,488
Hey, the town's looking real good.

791
01:30:54,666 --> 01:30:58,284
We almost finished what
Mama started. Those two are good.

792
01:30:58,462 --> 01:30:59,742
They'll fit perfect.

793
01:31:01,465 --> 01:31:03,089
What'd I tell you, huh?

794
01:31:03,508 --> 01:31:05,999
Isn't your work more real now?

795
01:31:06,636 --> 01:31:08,011
Ma would be proud.

796
01:31:08,972 --> 01:31:11,095
Yeah, she'd be real proud.

797
01:31:11,683 --> 01:31:15,301
She always said your talent would make
up for what God took away from you.

798
01:31:18,356 --> 01:31:20,395
Now, there's two more.

799
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:23,434
We still got a lot of work to do.

800
01:32:05,818 --> 01:32:08,274
It's okay, it's okay. All right.

801
01:32:16,245 --> 01:32:19,246
I saw Paige and Blake's bodies.
They're dead.

802
01:32:20,499 --> 01:32:22,657
We gotta go. Now.

803
01:32:36,764 --> 01:32:38,259
Damn.

804
01:32:44,272 --> 01:32:46,395
I can't see anything.

805
01:32:47,567 --> 01:32:49,773
There's gotta be a light
here somewhere.

806
01:33:30,942 --> 01:33:32,601
Come on.

807
01:33:49,793 --> 01:33:51,252
Dalton.

808
01:33:57,258 --> 01:33:58,753
Nick.

809
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:27,155
I'll get you out of there.

810
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:32,333
No.

811
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:35,915
No. Nick.

812
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:38,295
Nick, please.

813
01:34:42,469 --> 01:34:44,924
No.

814
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:56,064
That's Vincent.

815
01:35:23,299 --> 01:35:26,217
Come on, Carly. Move it. Move it!

816
01:35:39,732 --> 01:35:42,139
Nick, let's get out of here. Hurry!

817
01:35:50,284 --> 01:35:52,157
Come on. Come this way.

818
01:36:04,756 --> 01:36:07,164
No. Oh, my God. Wade.

819
01:36:07,342 --> 01:36:09,085
- Come on.
- No.

820
01:36:11,971 --> 01:36:13,631
You sick fuck!

821
01:37:13,489 --> 01:37:15,980
- You're finished.
- No.

822
01:38:13,672 --> 01:38:15,130
Carly, behind you!

823
01:38:25,808 --> 01:38:27,516
Come on.

824
01:38:27,685 --> 01:38:29,476
Get up. Please.

825
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:41,192
Run! Go, Carly! Run!

826
01:38:44,034 --> 01:38:45,445
Hey, Vincent.

827
01:38:47,621 --> 01:38:48,819
Hey.

828
01:38:49,873 --> 01:38:51,332
Vincent.

829
01:38:52,584 --> 01:38:55,253
I swear to God, if you hurt her...

830
01:38:58,214 --> 01:39:01,049
Vincent!

831
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:15,743
No. Listen to me. Listen to me.

832
01:40:15,914 --> 01:40:18,239
I heard you talking.
You don't need to do this.

833
01:40:18,416 --> 01:40:23,125
You didn't have to listen to your brother.
I saw Bo's scars. And the highchairs.

834
01:40:23,296 --> 01:40:24,577
No!

835
01:40:26,132 --> 01:40:28,089
You're not a freak!

836
01:40:28,259 --> 01:40:30,133
He was!

837
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:56,533
You don't need to do this. Please.

838
01:40:56,703 --> 01:41:00,321
You're an artist. Bo was lying to you.
He used you.

839
01:41:00,499 --> 01:41:04,247
Do you really think that your mother
would have wanted you to do this?

840
01:41:04,669 --> 01:41:06,080
Please don't kill me!

841
01:41:09,007 --> 01:41:11,130
Motherfucker!

842
01:41:28,108 --> 01:41:29,816
Oh, shit.

843
01:41:32,988 --> 01:41:34,897
Carly!

844
01:41:38,744 --> 01:41:40,404
I'm here.

845
01:41:53,633 --> 01:41:55,590
Carly, do it! Do it now!

846
01:42:14,278 --> 01:42:15,558
Come on.

847
01:42:15,904 --> 01:42:18,574
- Nick, get up!
- Yeah.

848
01:42:30,126 --> 01:42:32,368
- We're almost there!
- Oh, God!

849
01:42:32,837 --> 01:42:34,213
How do we get out?

850
01:42:46,601 --> 01:42:49,056
- Watch out!
- Get back.

851
01:42:53,315 --> 01:42:55,224
Nick. The wall.

852
01:42:56,944 --> 01:42:58,687
Dig!

853
01:43:04,284 --> 01:43:05,659
Faster! Faster!

854
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,082
Dig!

855
01:43:12,792 --> 01:43:15,579
Come on, Carly. Faster!

856
01:43:18,214 --> 01:43:21,381
Go, go! Come on. Come on.

857
01:43:33,395 --> 01:43:34,806
Oh, God!

858
01:44:35,247 --> 01:44:37,120
Watch yourself.

859
01:44:38,166 --> 01:44:40,574
It's over 70 and counting right now.

860
01:44:50,386 --> 01:44:52,509
Hey, that's my friend's camera.

861
01:44:52,889 --> 01:44:55,047
Hey, that's my friend's camera.

862
01:44:55,224 --> 01:44:57,596
Sorry, son. That's evidence.

863
01:44:58,561 --> 01:45:00,518
You guys okay?

864
01:45:01,855 --> 01:45:04,181
Well, don't worry.
We'll get you to the hospital.

865
01:45:04,483 --> 01:45:06,641
How could no one have known
about all of this?

866
01:45:07,236 --> 01:45:10,106
Truth is, this town's hard as hell
to get to.

867
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:13,696
It's been abandoned 10 years,
ever since that sugar mill shut down.

868
01:45:13,867 --> 01:45:15,860
Hell, it ain't even
on the map anymore.

869
01:45:16,077 --> 01:45:18,153
We found all those cars
in that old factory.

870
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:21,330
Those Sinclair boys pulled people
off the interstate for years.

871
01:45:21,499 --> 01:45:26,576
If it wasn't for all the smoke from
the fire, we wouldn't have even known.

872
01:45:27,422 --> 01:45:29,580
Excuse me, sir.
Louis wants to talk to you.

873
01:45:29,757 --> 01:45:31,750
Yeah. Excuse me.

874
01:45:59,494 --> 01:46:01,985
Maybe there's some good memories
on this.

875
01:46:02,789 --> 01:46:04,117
You took it?

876
01:46:04,499 --> 01:46:07,251
It just felt wrong leaving it behind.

877
01:46:07,418 --> 01:46:08,877
You know?

878
01:46:09,462 --> 01:46:11,205
You okay?

879
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:14,632
We're okay.

880
01:46:16,594 --> 01:46:18,421
<i>Sheriff?</i>

881
01:46:18,930 --> 01:46:23,010
<i>- Yeah, Dave?
- Ran the Sinclair family through CDIC.</i>

882
01:46:23,184 --> 01:46:25,390
<i>Trudy and the doctor didn't
have two sons.</i>

883
01:46:25,978 --> 01:46:27,602
<i>They had three.</i>
