1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,822
There you are. One dollar.

3
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,958
Big oil strike in California. Read all about it.
Read all about it for 2 bits.

4
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:26,035
Big oil strike in California.

5
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:27,762
There's a plenty big one here, bub.

6
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,736
Yeah, if I could only get me a string...

7
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:32,501
...of equipment, I got a piece
of ground that's a honey.

8
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:34,440
You got ground? You got ground.

9
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,876
Here, take a look at the core
from my lease.

10
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:39,482
Smell it. Down 800 feet
and run out of pipe.

11
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,710
Well, if it's pipe and tools you need,
there's Luther Aldrich now.

12
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:44,013
That tightwad.

13
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:46,383
Luther Aldrich? Where?
Where is he? Wh...?

14
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:52,358
Hey, 6 bits, please. Thanks.

15
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:56,523
Get around the side of me, fella, will you?

16
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:59,897
- Come on, I'm getting out here.
- Come on, mule.

17
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:14,107
Hello, Luther, old boy. Well, I haven't
seen you since the Kansas boom.

18
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:17,277
- I don't think I quite...
- We made a lot of money there, didn't we?

19
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:21,824
- Sand. John Sand? You remember me.
- Sand? I don't think I...

20
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,588
I'm spudding in my first well down here.
I'm going down about 1700 feet...

21
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:28,857
...so I'll need quite a lot of equipment.
- Oh, equipment?

22
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:33,367
Yes. Mr. Sand, of course.
Well, come right over here.

23
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:35,403
What section are you thinking of drilling?

24
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:38,667
Well, my lease is in a new section
about 30 miles south of here.

25
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:43,246
- Thirty miles. A wildcat, huh?
- Some fellas might call it that.

26
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:45,041
Casing tools and lumber...

27
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:48,379
...will cost you about $ 7000 in cash.
- That's fine.

28
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:52,319
That's fine, fine. We'll just carry that
in an open account against my name...

29
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,584
...and then when the well comes in...
- I thought so, another deadbeat.

30
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,287
- These boomtowns reek with larceny.
- I may be down to my last couple bucks...

31
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:02,558
...but do you think I'd do it
if I didn't think there was oil?

32
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,065
You're an oil man, aren't you?
All oil men are crazy.

33
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:08,034
I've been swindled and hijacked
and I'm practically naked.

34
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,369
Mr. Aldrich, there's a million dollars in this.
Now, you know me.

35
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:14,067
I don't know you.
I don't know why I said I did.

36
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:17,408
What do people think I am, a good fairy?

37
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:33,294
Hey, brother. Four bits if you want to cross.
Or take it the hard way.

38
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:35,694
That's the way I take everything else.

39
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:40,964
Shorty, do you mind backing up
and letting me by?

40
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,575
Yeah, I do mind. Suppose you back up.
And don't call me Shorty.

41
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,074
Shorty or sonny,
what difference does it make?

42
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,908
You know, you're liable to get all muddy
if you don't put it in reverse.

43
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,347
- Move over, bud.
- I'm wearing Justin Boots with 4-inch heels.

44
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,852
They'll sure make big dents
in that little frame of yours.

45
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:02,853
Stop, or I'll shoot.

46
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:07,623
Put that six-shooter down.

47
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:18,603
I'm John McMasters.

48
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,970
I never heard of you.
And I got no time to start now.

49
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:27,916
Nice shooting, Harmony.
Right above the nose.

50
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,212
Sorry his nose was so close to you,
big feller.

51
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:32,083
What did he do to you? Talk back?

52
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:35,783
No, nothing personal. Just, he's been
around hijacking tools and equipment.

53
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,655
Hijacking? Yeah, that's bad business.

54
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:39,955
Ain't it awful?
I was just trying to arrest him.

55
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,122
Why can't folks be more law-abiding?

56
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,098
I'll go home and won't sleep good
again tonight.

57
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:47,066
I guess he will.

58
00:05:57,348 --> 00:05:59,908
Hey, what do you...? John.

59
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:02,882
Hi, Evie. How's my
barrel of sweet Spanish crude?

60
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:04,487
Where you been hiding, honey?

61
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,520
Hey, what happened?
You jump out a window?

62
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:08,556
You know I wouldn't
turn my back on a lady.

63
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:10,159
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, John.

64
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,099
- You been holding out on me.
- You ain't been around.

65
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:19,031
She just come over from New Orleans.

66
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:21,831
Lots of laughs.
Never been away from home.

67
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,812
Hey, 50 bucks. You'll spoil the kid.

68
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:35,578
You can't spoil baby lamb.
Besides, I got 800 in my poke.

69
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:37,687
Just brought in a gusher
for old man Wilson.

70
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,153
I'm here for laughs
and checking out in the morning.

71
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:42,918
You darn prairie jack.
Where you hopping to now?

72
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:45,528
I hear they brought in a big wildcat
out in California.

73
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,792
Wildcats. Always looking for wildcats.
When you gonna settle down, darling?

74
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:52,458
What the heck, Evie?
Travel and brag, brag and travel.

75
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,832
Maybe I'll hit oil where there ain't.

76
00:06:56,307 --> 00:07:00,300
Throw a steak on the fire for me, will you,
with all the fixings. I'm gonna wash up.

77
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,960
Hey, Whitey.
I'll be back down like a spring breeze.

78
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,900
Don't let those apes
steal your peanuts.

79
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,267
They say that with diamonds
where I come from.

80
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:31,998
Yes, sir, Whitey.

81
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:34,934
A brass band in a bathtub.

82
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:40,646
Oh, excuse me.

83
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,556
Whip those mules, brother,
there's a run on the bank.

84
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,250
Say, listen, fella...

85
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,760
Well, well, it's Shorty again.

86
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,726
A man can get pretty sick
of running into a guy like you.

87
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,461
Yeah, you don't wanna get sick, though.
I might have to hold your head, Shorty.

88
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:02,572
I guess you didn't hear me the first time.
Don't call me Shorty.

89
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,173
Why not, Shorty?

90
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,876
Okay. Why should you and me
have an argument?

91
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:13,813
- One of us might get hurt.
- Yeah, that's right. One of us might.

92
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:17,317
You wanna use the bowl? I'm through.
Wait a minute, I'll fix it up for you.

93
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:21,083
- Well, thanks, Shorty.
- There you are. Put a little of that gin in it.

94
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:22,486
Cut right through that oil.

95
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,060
- Cheaper than water, anyway.
- Yeah.

96
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:29,092
- Yeah. Not bad.
- Quite a roll of scratch you got there.

97
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,461
Wouldn't be as much as 6 or 7 grand,
would there?

98
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:34,798
Supposing it is. You think you're gonna
pull a gun out of your rudder?

99
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:39,935
No, no, no. I just thought you
might be interested in spudding in a well...

100
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:43,342
...run it up to a million.
- Oh, no. Nothing doing, Shorty.

101
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:46,506
I'm heading west. California.
I like them wild.

102
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:48,709
I hear a guy might do all right out there.

103
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,786
You don't want them
any wilder than this.

104
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:54,391
Look at this. All unproven, virgin lease.
Thirty miles south of here.

105
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:58,426
- So you think there's oil there, huh?
- You put up for the rig and the tools...

106
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:02,327
...and you're in for half. There's oil there.
- How do you know, Shorty?

107
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,560
- You don't get them dealing cards.
- The old bunion, huh?

108
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:07,431
- You're a driller too, huh?
- That's it.

109
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,596
- Come on, what do you say, fifty-fifty?
- Nope.

110
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:12,902
I've been planted here too long anyway.
Me for over the Rockies.

111
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:15,875
Stick around, though,
and I'll buy you a drink, just for luck.

112
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:20,282
Okay, Whitey. Diamonds or doughnuts?

113
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:25,446
- Hey, wait a minute. Where you going?
- Let go. I pick my own posies, jughead.

114
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:28,522
- Sit down and eat your steak, John.
- Come on, Whitey, honey...

115
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,354
...throw your little derrick up right here.
And happy days.

116
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,327
- Who's your cheerful friend, John?
- Him? That's Shorty.

117
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:38,366
- Name is Sand. John Sand.
- Well, John. Two Johns.

118
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,936
We gotta do something about that.
Get all mixed up.

119
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:45,405
- First I'll find a nice girl for you to talk to.
- If you don't mind, I'll just stick to whiskey.

120
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:47,771
- I'll bet he's got a girl.
- Maybe he's married.

121
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:50,243
- Got an Oregon Boot back home, Shorty?
- Who, me? No.

122
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:53,042
- No, not exactly.
- You mean you got a girl, eh, Shorty?

123
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:57,244
Sure. And he's on the square and I like him.
That's your name. Square John.

124
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,685
Square John, Big John.
That fixes everything.

125
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:02,223
Well, blood on the moon.

126
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:07,395
Whitey, if I was to tell you
that I was the Mississippi River...

127
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,499
...at high tide,
what would you think, huh?

128
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:13,961
Hey. We thought this over.
You was with us first.

129
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:17,172
- She was?
- Yeah.

130
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,309
Well, I didn't...

131
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,648
- Looks like we got company, Shorty.
- You got company.

132
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,877
That's what I thought.

133
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:47,129
I beat you by four feet, Shorty.

134
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:50,634
Wait a minute. I got another chance.

135
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:58,108
- I give you a tie.
- Hey, lke. Ed. Break it up. Break it up.

136
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,807
Say, John, stop it. You're giving
the place a bad name.

137
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:05,581
Shorty, you sure can go.
Here I am thinking you're all gab.

138
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:07,451
Yeah, he pulled a cutting knife on me.

139
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,649
- Makes you mad.
- Yeah.

140
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:11,624
Hey, where'd you say
that lease of yours was?

141
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:14,286
- Thirty miles south of here.
- Well, okay, okay.

142
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,629
We'll drive out and take a look at her.
In the morning.

143
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:32,247
- So you think you got a field here, huh?
- I know it. Take a look.

144
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:55,466
The bigheaded geologists in town
say it's only surface gas, but I say it's oil.

145
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,506
- Shorty, I think we got something here.
- I know we have.

146
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,337
And we're plumb center, right here.

147
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,138
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

148
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,285
I think more over by that old skull
will hit the peak of the dome.

149
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:13,617
No, no. Don't be fooled by false jogs.
This pay structure, it's right under here.

150
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,259
You're gonna fool yourself
down to salt water if you...

151
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:20,158
I'm an oil man too, you know. I haven't
been drilling all my life for gophers.

152
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:23,892
Wait, I was pulling oil out of the ground
when your ma was giving it to you...

153
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,092
...for your health.

154
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,567
- If you think...
- All right, all right, take it easy.

155
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:31,606
Somebody's gotta be the boss.
You got a hard dollar on you?

156
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:37,240
- Kind of light, ain't it?
- Yeah, it's counterfeit.

157
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:41,145
- It's the only kind I can hold on to. Call it.
- Heads.

158
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:47,321
Okay, you're the boss.
We'll spud in by the skull.

159
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,049
Now, listen, Shorty.

160
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,423
My betting on you is just as good
as betting on that skull.

161
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,621
- We'll spud in here.
- Okay, boss.

162
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:58,757
Hey, now, how about that dough?
How much is in that bankroll of yours?

163
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:01,962
Well, let's see. I had 800
when I went in the joint last night...

164
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:05,802
- That Whitey, she's all right, isn't she?
- You told me you had 7 grand.

165
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,305
No. You told me, Shorty.

166
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,538
That'll only put up the derrick.

167
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:12,944
I'm the boss.
Getting the equipment is up to me.

168
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:15,415
Just put yourself in my hands.

169
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,155
Hey. Wait a minute, John.

170
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:23,816
You better keep them eyes peeled
for hijackers.

171
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:25,791
I lost two loads last week.

172
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:29,057
You hired me when I was broke,
Mr. Aldrich. I won't let you down.

173
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:32,134
I'll look after your merchandise
like it was my very own.

174
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:35,100
Yeah, well, I think we'd better not
take any chances. Come on.

175
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,264
Get down off there, Eddie.
Hey, Harmony.

176
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,637
Come away from that cookbook.
Come on.

177
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:43,939
- Coming a-running.
- Now, look, Mr. Aldrich, I don't need any...

178
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,982
No, no. If any hijackers start anything,
Harmony will take care of them.

179
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,582
Go ahead.

180
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:57,588
Well, it's the big feller.
I didn't recognize you at first.

181
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,956
Nice day for the race, ain't it?

182
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,325
- What race?
- The human race.

183
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,811
"You add a pinch of salt to taste
and serve piping hot...

184
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,971
...to the delight
of your family and friends."

185
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,209
- Don't that sound pretty?
- If you're so interested in cooking...

186
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:24,115
...why do you go around killing people?

187
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:28,224
I hate shooting folks. I had a fine job
cooking over at the Parsons' ranch.

188
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:31,293
A bunch of horse rustlers popped in,
and when the sheriff come...

189
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:36,263
...he kind of liked the way they was laid out
and he deputized me for this here business.

190
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:41,097
Say, here's a "reskipe"
for lemon "meringoo" pie.

191
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:45,071
I expect that's just plain old lemon pie
for foreigners, don't you...?

192
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:53,178
Danged if I like them big hawks.
All the time killing little turtledoves.

193
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,250
Put them up.
Come on, pull up there.

194
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:59,318
- No monkey business, now. Climb down.
- Climb down in front of me, son.

195
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,890
But don't worry,
I'll plug him right between the eyes.

196
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,425
No, no, I can't. I'm shaking all over.

197
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:07,357
- Come on, you guys. Quit stalling.
- Turn the gun loose.

198
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,830
No, don't shoot.
Maybe he'll shoot back.

199
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:16,800
All right, keep walking now
and keep reaching.

200
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:18,202
Yes, sir.

201
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,098
Get up there.

202
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:23,176
Please don't say anything
to anybody, will you?

203
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:26,839
I'm not used to guns.
My knees just turn to water.

204
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,416
I nearly passed out, I guess.

205
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:31,645
Now, just simmer down, big feller.
Think of something else.

206
00:15:57,281 --> 00:16:00,148
Hey. We're getting close.
Try that last stuff.

207
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:02,411
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

208
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,611
Now who wanted to spud in
by that steer skull?

209
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:06,915
We'll be reaching for her tail
in a few feet.

210
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,321
We sure had a break with Aldrich.
I thought he'd have spotted us by now.

211
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:14,555
We'll pay Luther back double.
Come on, you wild kitty. Spit.

212
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:18,565
- Begins to get you about now, don't it?
- Yeah, like sparking around some dame.

213
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:23,536
I forgot about that gal of yours, Shorty.
Don't worry, she'll be in platinum garters...

214
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:26,540
Hey. Listen.
Get back. She's coming in now.

215
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,144
- Come on, honey. Come to us, baby.
- Let's cap her in.

216
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:31,747
No, let her flow.
Let her open up her mouth and holler.

217
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:33,348
Look out!

218
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:54,231
Salt water.

219
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,395
The Gulf of Mexico.

220
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:11,981
Well, at least we can smoke now.

221
00:17:16,793 --> 00:17:18,988
Take it easy, Shorty.

222
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:22,225
They say you'll get rich
if you drill enough holes.

223
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:25,300
We'd have been all right
if we'd spudded in by that skull.

224
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:30,668
Must be the water from the side structure.
Well, I guess that's that.

225
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,901
You're thinking about that dame, huh?

226
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:38,647
Hey, what's her name? What's she like?
She's nuts about you, huh?

227
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,578
I wish I could be sure.
She likes me, I guess.

228
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:45,745
We've known each other quite a piece.
You know, it ain't exactly set yet...

229
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:49,757
...but I figured if this well came in,
why, she'd come out here and we could...

230
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:51,326
Forget it.

231
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:56,990
Pick up your chin. We'll spud in
over there someday. Somehow.

232
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,335
Who's that coming?

233
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:04,666
- That's Luther's car. We'd better travel.
- Travel or jail.

234
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:09,607
They're getting away.
They're getting away.

235
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:13,275
Hey, hold it.

236
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:16,444
Okay.

237
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:20,489
Take it easy,
I'm gonna get me a pigeon.

238
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:31,090
For heaven's sake, they're escaping.
Come on, you're the sheriff. Do something.

239
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:33,828
I wonder what they done
with my Barbara Fritchie cookbook.

240
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:36,063
Shut up, you blithering seagull.

241
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:40,642
Thousands of dollars' worth
of equipment lost, and in a dry hole.

242
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:44,474
If they ever come back here, I'll have
them boiled in oil. In their own oil.

243
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,740
They didn't strike any.

244
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:39,424
Once more won't hurt them. Seven, dice.
There she is.

245
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:41,332
Seven out of the field
and pay the line.

246
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:45,236
Six-one, babies. Right back at them.
That's it, babies.

247
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:47,536
- Eleven. Pay the line.
- Ten passes.

248
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:50,942
I can't lose. I'm knee-deep in clover.
Just for luck, Shorty.

249
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:54,049
Come on, babies, once more. Oh, yeah.

250
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:56,947
- Pay the line.
- There you are, sir.

251
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,781
Two thousand.
Watch me double it.

252
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:01,150
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
That's enough.

253
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:04,158
Those dice got snake eyes, you know.

254
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:06,795
Okay, Shorty.
Shorty here, he's the warden.

255
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:10,057
That's right, you tell him, Shorty.
Make him take...

256
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:13,566
- Don't call me Shorty.
- But, Holy Moses, he called you Shorty.

257
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:15,705
That's all right. That's him, not you.

258
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:18,898
Here, buy him seven or eight drinks.
Come on, Shorty, let's go.

259
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:22,534
Hey, where are we going with all
this fancy scratch, little man?

260
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:24,111
Right back to Burkburnett.

261
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:27,215
And we're gonna spud in that well
right by the old steer skull...

262
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:30,285
...where a fella tried to get me
to do it once before. Remember?

263
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,289
Hey, wait a minute, chump.

264
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:37,949
Do you think Luther is foolish enough
to take $2000 for all we owe him?

265
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:40,790
You just act like I said.
Do as the boss tells you.

266
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:43,861
Just check over that balance.
It was wrong again yesterday.

267
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,027
- Hi, Luther. Long time no see.
- Well, gentlemen, what can I...?

268
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:52,938
It's them. It's them.
Do something, quick. Get Harmony.

269
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,806
Wait a minute. Easy.
We're just here on a little business.

270
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:59,380
Don't stand there trembling
like a pen-wiper. What business?

271
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,382
We wanna pay our bill.
Course, if you don't want the money...

272
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,955
You wanna pay me? Well, why didn't
you say...? Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.

273
00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:10,787
I was only saying yesterday, I wonder
what happened to Mr. Sand and...

274
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,724
Let go of Mr. McMasters, you idiot.

275
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,887
- Well, it's the big feller.
- Hi, Harmony.

276
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,795
- It's all right, Harmony, there's no...
- Here you are, Luther.

277
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:19,595
- Well.
- Two thousand on account.

278
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:22,636
Two thousand?
But you owe me $ 7000.

279
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,830
That's for good faith.
We still got our lease.

280
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:26,999
We'll pay the rest
when our new well comes in.

281
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:28,303
- New well?
- Sure.

282
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:30,309
You're gonna give us
tools and equipment.

283
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,246
I give you what? Harmony, get the sheriff.
I'll give you jail sentences...

284
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:38,148
Wait a minute, now, take it easy.
All right, he's got us where it hurts.

285
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:42,189
- We gotta give him a sixteenth of the well.
- What? We'll do no such thing.

286
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,487
Certainly not. I... I... What's that?
A sixteenth?

287
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:49,154
Well, I... I... No, I run
a strictly cash business here.

288
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:51,732
All right, all right.
Then we'll give you an eighth.

289
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:55,303
- Give an eighth of a million dollars away?
- A million dollars? Are you...?

290
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:58,873
You mean 10 million dollars.
We can afford a measly eighth.

291
00:21:59,342 --> 00:22:02,106
- Come on, Luther...
- No, no, no. Over my dead body.

292
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,737
Where do you get off mooching your way
in for an eighth, you old cow thief?

293
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:09,147
- I'm going over to the bank on my own.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

294
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,581
I don't know what to say.

295
00:22:10,754 --> 00:22:13,780
You said enough, trying to let
this crook in on a sure thing.

296
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,822
I worked my hands raw
to earn that money.

297
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:19,519
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I might consider an eighth.

298
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:20,720
But an eighth of what?

299
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:23,798
What makes you two maniacs
think you're gonna find oil this time?

300
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,527
Say, do you think we'd be
sticking our necks in a noose...

301
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:28,671
...if we didn't know there was oil?
Come on.

302
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:33,434
- No, no, I still think an eighth is...
- Well, all right. All right. I'll do it.

303
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,876
But it's got to be an eighth.
And we'll sign the papers right now.

304
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:40,710
Harmony goes out with you
to see there's no monkey business.

305
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:43,352
And if you two fellas
don't bring in a well this time...

306
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,920
...you go to jail. Both of you.
I'm not gonna... I'm...

307
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:50,590
For heaven...
I'm stuck again.

308
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:04,468
Hot groceries.

309
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:09,237
- Hey, Big John, come and get it.
- Okay. I'm ready for it.

310
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:12,140
Here she is, boys.
Another Barbara Fritchie special.

311
00:23:12,315 --> 00:23:13,873
Hey, what's that for?

312
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,019
We gotta have a name for the well.
You mind if we call it that?

313
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,918
"Beautiful darling Betsy."
Well, I'll be doggoned.

314
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:24,185
Okay, Shorty. Say, when are we
gonna get a load of this gal?

315
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,727
Maybe you'll see her one day,
if the well comes in.

316
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:30,297
We're due, all right. Take a look
at the sand from that last bailing.

317
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,394
What's that? Rabbit again?

318
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:35,970
Rabbit stew ŕ la "modee."
Shot two nice fat ones this morning.

319
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:39,074
Couldn't go out and shoot a can of beans
for a change, could you?

320
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:40,732
Let's drive to Eva's for a steak.

321
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,970
- We got 13 or a dozen bucks left.
- No. Rabbit's okay by me.

322
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:48,015
We're due for a bust. Five weeks of this
ain't natural, fella. I got the jumps.

323
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:51,449
You and Harmony go in. I can make
a few more feet of hole before dark.

324
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:55,921
- Besides, I got some letters to write.
- Oh, okay, okay. Me for town.

325
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:58,686
You work out your nightlife
with water on the side.

326
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:03,526
But that gal may stand you up, so just
don't turn out to be Henry the Hermit.

327
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:08,903
I'll pick up the groceries
and meet you over at Eva's.

328
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,632
- Hey.
- Careful, my dear.

329
00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:13,969
- Let the deacon help you.
- Thank you.

330
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,542
Looks like Aunt Molly's got
a new visitor.

331
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:21,412
Yeah. Kind of looks that way.
But I'm not sure.

332
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:25,314
You'll like the other place better, dear.
Not a hotel, more like a boarding house.

333
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:27,388
More homelike for a girl like you, dearie.

334
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,525
We have evening get-togethers,
and the nicest Southern cooking.

335
00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:34,357
- You're very kind, but I...
- Ma'am, I'm about to speak a piece.

336
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:38,126
You're new here, so you don't know
Aunt Molly and the deacon.

337
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:40,792
Molly's done a little time.
And the deacon...

338
00:24:41,004 --> 00:24:44,235
...well, he can squirm under a
water moccasin with a high hat on.

339
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,705
And you, Auntie,
keep that knife in your corset.

340
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:51,370
It might not look nice if I'd have to
kick you in the stomach. Now, get.

341
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,974
Well, thank you very much.

342
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:57,847
You see, where they wanted
to take you...

343
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:00,147
Well, a girl like you
might not have liked it.

344
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:04,183
You mean I'd wake up in a gilded palace
and be afraid to go home?

345
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:06,155
Oh, you were wise, huh?

346
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:09,332
Well, they were pretty obvious.
You know, the first time I voted...

347
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:12,559
...my mother broke down and told me
all about the big, bad world.

348
00:25:12,736 --> 00:25:14,636
- Thanks anyway.
- You know...

349
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:17,431
...I still think you need
somebody to keep an eye on you.

350
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:20,508
- This is a pretty rough town.
- Oh, dear.

351
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:23,835
- What?
- I thought it was Galahad.

352
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:28,541
Galahad in boots and a Stetson, come to
rescue the fair Elaine from the dragons.

353
00:25:28,718 --> 00:25:31,915
- But underneath you're just Modred.
- What do you mean, Modred?

354
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,613
Sir Modred. Of all the knights,
he was the wicked one.

355
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,487
I'm very sorry.

356
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:40,895
She kind of rustled her bustle at you,
didn't she?

357
00:25:41,064 --> 00:25:45,501
Modred. Say, what do you know
about those guys Modred and Galahad?

358
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:49,432
Let me see. I know Pete Galahad.
Sheriff over in Whizbang.

359
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:52,268
No, no. Two different guys.

360
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:55,577
Could you tell me where I might find
Mr. Jonathan Sand?

361
00:25:55,745 --> 00:25:57,713
He's drilling out in the south section.

362
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:00,008
About a 30-mile ride.
I could get you a jitney.

363
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:03,982
Oh, no, not tonight. Thank you.
I'll have supper and go in the morning.

364
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:05,143
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:09,520
- Well, I take your order now.
- Let's see. How's the chicken?

366
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:12,752
Don't order fried chicken,
it's three-year-old jackrabbit.

367
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:15,955
- Saved again from a fate worse than death.
- Come on, Lena...

368
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:18,566
...tell her John McMasters
is just a babe in the woods.

369
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:22,068
I bring your soup,
but don't go in no woods.

370
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:23,865
Lena's dizzy from dollar tips.

371
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,770
- Are you Big John McMasters?
- Yeah.

372
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:28,240
You've heard about me, huh?

373
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:30,743
Well, I certainly have.

374
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,076
Doesn't that surprise you?

375
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:34,841
I'm pretty well-known in these parts.

376
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:37,248
I heard about you
long before I arrived here.

377
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:39,149
On the bus, huh?

378
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:43,416
Yes. That's right. They were saying,
"Big John McMasters...

379
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:46,494
...there's a fellow to be heard from."
- Really?

380
00:26:46,663 --> 00:26:50,121
Come on, now, stop kidding me
into a bear trap.

381
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,961
A lot's going on tonight.

382
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:55,832
What am I going to call you
for the rest of the evening?

383
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,836
The rest of the evening?

384
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:00,271
Yeah. All I know now is Elaine.

385
00:27:00,443 --> 00:27:03,503
What am I gonna call you when I
take you to that rodeo, for instance?

386
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:06,341
Well, maybe I just better be
the Lady Elaine for a while.

387
00:27:06,516 --> 00:27:09,041
I don't wanna give you any surprises.
You look delicate.

388
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,016
Lady Elaine, nothing you could tell me
would surprise me.

389
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,745
Wait and see, Sir Modred.

390
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:17,154
- You want to order?
- Sure. What are you doing here, at that?

391
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:19,256
Are you one of those lady drummers?

392
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:23,454
No, I'm much more important than that.

393
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:26,602
If I like it here, I might open a shop.

394
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:28,963
- What kind of a shop?
- Lingerie.

395
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:32,369
- Come again?
- Underwear. Ladies' underwear.

396
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,170
Ladies' underwear?
Well, I don't know. Now, you see...

397
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:40,544
...the girls in this town... Well,
what I mean is there's not much call for...

398
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:42,810
- You'd better order.
- Yeah.

399
00:27:44,988 --> 00:27:48,253
Now, Lena, my love,
I want a steak, 32 ounce, rare.

400
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:50,892
Same racket.
Hasn't changed since I was a kid.

401
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,654
Knock down the milk bottles
and they give you St. Vitus.

402
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,798
Stop it, you'll wear him out.

403
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:59,396
Mr. Summers, just a minute.
I want you to meet Lady Elaine.

404
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:01,434
- And Mrs. Summers.
- How do you do?

405
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:04,129
Mr. Summers runs the Emporium,
the biggest store in town.

406
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:08,038
Lady Elaine is selling women's underwear.
I want you to buy till it hurts.

407
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:11,236
Don't pay any attention to him,
Mr. Summers. He's crazy.

408
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:13,405
Yes, I'm Sir Modred, the wicked knight.

409
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,813
Wicked knight? You're drunk.

410
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,783
Oh, look, it's started.

411
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,155
Ride him, Henry.

412
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:30,027
Sit still and sing to him.

413
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,368
I guess Henry can't sing.

414
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:37,699
Why, that's just like sitting
in a rocking chair.

415
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:40,875
All right, folks. Who else will ride
the Missouri Angel?

416
00:28:41,044 --> 00:28:44,343
That's a cinch. All you have to do
is wrap your legs around him.

417
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,243
All right, go ahead.

418
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:47,849
Who, me?

419
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,645
Here's your next rider,
Big John McMasters.

420
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,253
Wait a minute. I was just...

421
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:55,456
Big John McMasters is our next rider.

422
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:58,123
You see how happy you've made them?

423
00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:00,660
Yes, yes. Sir Modred is stuck.

424
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,096
Here, take the colors of the fair Elaine and
wear them bravely in the joust, Sir Modred.

425
00:29:05,268 --> 00:29:07,862
I don't know what she's talking about,
but look after her.

426
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,005
She's something pretty special.

427
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:14,174
- Whoa, mule.
- He's just looking you over.

428
00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:15,743
Yeah.

429
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,704
Sir Modred is up.

430
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,883
Hey, what do you got the balloon for,
Big John? Going up in the air?

431
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:27,682
- Everybody likes Big John, don't they?
- Yeah. He's high-test, ma'am.

432
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:32,250
Hey, Big John!

433
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:34,954
Sir Modred is still up.

434
00:29:51,614 --> 00:29:53,104
Modred is down.

435
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:57,243
You know, I've never had so much fun
in all my life.

436
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,409
What do we do now?

437
00:29:58,621 --> 00:30:01,021
I guess there's not much more
you can do in this town.

438
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,590
- Hiya, Big John.
- Oh, hi, Tom. Hi, Ed.

439
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:07,923
- Well, we'll be seeing you next summer.
- Yeah? Hey, where are you headed?

440
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,565
- Off to Arizona for a little wildcatting.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:13,224
And when we come back,
we'll be driving a Rolls-Royce.

442
00:30:13,469 --> 00:30:16,029
Attaboy. I hope you bring in a cat
that'll really howl.

443
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,500
Happy days.

444
00:30:21,411 --> 00:30:24,039
Tom and Ed Murphy.
I hope they get lucky and strike it.

445
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,443
They've been knocking at the gate
a long time.

446
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,584
Say, this sounds very gay.
What's in here?

447
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:31,311
No, you don't wanna go in there.
That's just a dance hall.

448
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:32,476
A bad dance hall?

449
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:35,123
Well, no, but it's a place
where fellas go on payday...

450
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,122
- Have you been in there?
- Sure, but...

451
00:30:37,326 --> 00:30:40,921
- Well, then, you can take me.
- No, no, it's liable to be kind of rough.

452
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:43,361
Now, look,
I'm not really Little Red Riding Hood.

453
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:48,630
I came down here because I wanted
to see if... Well, I want to see all the sights.

454
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,432
Now, please.

455
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:53,439
Well, I'm agin it.
So holler when you've had enough.

456
00:30:57,547 --> 00:31:01,916
Hello, Big John. Whitey was just asking
me where... I beg your pardon.

457
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:04,178
Hi, Hank. Good old Hank.

458
00:31:04,353 --> 00:31:08,221
Well, look at all the pretty girls.
Do you know them?

459
00:31:08,391 --> 00:31:10,825
Yes... That is, I mean,
not all of them, but...

460
00:31:10,993 --> 00:31:14,690
- There's the dance floor. Do you dance?
- Look, here's roulette over here.

461
00:31:14,864 --> 00:31:17,264
- Well, I'd rather...
- Did you ever play roulette?

462
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:19,492
Say, which one is Spanish Eva?

463
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,967
She's home, taking care of the kids.

464
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,071
Hi, lke. Five bucks on 17.

465
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,073
Me too. A quarter. Two bits on 17.

466
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:29,768
- Sorry, ma'am, but the limit is...
- Just this once, lke.

467
00:31:29,946 --> 00:31:32,210
Hey, where you been,
you big bag of sugar?

468
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:35,646
I've been cooling my lily-white heels
for three hours waiting for you.

469
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:38,651
- Seventeen odd.
- That means we won, doesn't it?

470
00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:40,755
- Yeah.
- Who's that?

471
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,481
- Why...
- You new here?

472
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:44,285
Yes, I arrived this evening.

473
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,155
She with you?

474
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:49,594
- Whitey, this is the fair Elaine, Lady Elaine.
- How are you?

475
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:52,326
Oh, yeah? And I'm Lady Astorbilt.

476
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:54,527
She's just his sister, kid.

477
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,101
- Give it to her, blondie.
- Come on.

478
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:00,605
Holler when you've had enough.

479
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:02,142
Come on.

480
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:06,810
After that it was just bumming around...

481
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:09,451
...logging a bit up in Alberta...

482
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:12,679
...a few years mining here and there,
then France.

483
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:15,688
Now I'm in the oil game
for good, I guess.

484
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:19,021
A woman always gets a chump
to blow his own horn, doesn't she?

485
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:20,822
Not unless she wants to hear it.

486
00:32:20,997 --> 00:32:22,988
I've never been very close-hitched
to people.

487
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:26,100
That is, until I met my partner.
Right down the street there...

488
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:28,760
Say, isn't that a wonderful moon?

489
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:33,234
Yeah. That's moon enough for everybody.

490
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:37,775
- Say, what's this?
- That?

491
00:32:37,947 --> 00:32:40,313
That's just oil
being pulled up out of the ground.

492
00:32:40,483 --> 00:32:42,747
Here? But it looks like a church.

493
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,285
Sure, used to be. Look.

494
00:32:45,454 --> 00:32:47,718
When the boom came,
the congregation got excited...

495
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,552
...and spudded in a wildcat
right under the pulpit.

496
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:54,287
Now there are churches all over the state
spreading happy days and hallelujah...

497
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:56,431
...right out of these holes.

498
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,899
- And ye shall rise out of the earth.
- Well, why, who's there?

499
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,437
- Why, glory be, it's Big John.
- Hello, Springtime.

500
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,132
You're out late.
I was just finishing my supper.

501
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,279
- How are they pumping?
- Deep and sure, John. Deep and sure.

502
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:14,542
They'll be pumping long after
I'm spudded in and part of the flow.

503
00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:17,777
- Well, good night to you.
- Good night.

504
00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:21,279
You know, funny guy, Springtime.

505
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,890
Two times a millionaire...

506
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:25,619
...once in the Pennsylvania field
and once in Louisiana.

507
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:28,553
Hired the top deck of an ocean liner
just to go to Paris.

508
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:32,167
Now he's here in Texas, broke.
But he might hit it again tomorrow.

509
00:33:32,335 --> 00:33:35,270
- He seems happy, though.
- Yeah. It's a funny business.

510
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:37,804
You get away from it for a while,
go on a bust.

511
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,771
Then one night, you try to sleep...

512
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:42,843
...those darn pumps
start pounding in your ears.

513
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:44,809
I don't know.

514
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:47,109
Like a heartbeat.

515
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,981
Yeah. Sounds kind of silly, doesn't it?

516
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:52,882
Nothing is silly in church.

517
00:33:56,959 --> 00:34:00,952
You sure can talk straight to a fella
and ball him up at the same time.

518
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,564
I'll have to sic you on my partner.
You'll like Shorty.

519
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:06,998
Everybody calls him Square John,
and he's as square as the Constitution.

520
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:10,002
But, you know, Elaine, he's been
mooning around about some dame.

521
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:13,539
Keeps writing her letters, won't talk
about her, like it was a 20-1 shot.

522
00:34:14,977 --> 00:34:17,639
If I thought that much about a girl, I'd...

523
00:34:18,581 --> 00:34:20,981
But it'd have to be a girl like you.

524
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,347
I'd want her right where
I could take ahold of her and tell her.

525
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,852
Right here, for instance.

526
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,584
I'd like to go back to the hotel.

527
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,094
What's the matter? What's wrong?

528
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,025
If you don't mind, please,
it's getting a little chilly.

529
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:42,194
Yes, it is a little, at that, I guess.

530
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:45,970
All right, come on.

531
00:34:56,118 --> 00:34:58,552
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.

532
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:06,422
Well, thank you. It's been awfully nice.

533
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:11,199
- I'll see you some more, won't I?
- No, I'm afraid not.

534
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,927
I just realized I have to
take the bus in the morning.

535
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:15,900
Hey, wait a minute.

536
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,872
- Is there another guy?
- Yes.

537
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,943
- You love him, huh?
- No, not this...

538
00:35:24,113 --> 00:35:27,742
- Not that way, but...
- Then what are you leaving for?

539
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:32,082
Because... Goodbye.

540
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,423
Hey.

541
00:35:42,198 --> 00:35:43,665
Come down here.

542
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:00,909
I make up my mind quick.

543
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:03,916
I made it up
when I first saw you, I guess.

544
00:36:04,086 --> 00:36:06,486
You aren't ever gonna leave.

545
00:36:25,074 --> 00:36:26,507
She drilled herself in.

546
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,704
You're rich, mister.
There's yeast in the buckwheat.

547
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:37,176
Boy, ain't that a beautiful black cloud?

548
00:36:41,357 --> 00:36:44,087
Let's cap her.
She'll run all over the state.

549
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:48,059
Boy, listen to her.
She's just a-puffing and a-blowing.

550
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:54,494
Hey, wait.

551
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:22,420
Go and dig up Big John
and then find Luther.

552
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:26,295
- Hey, Shorty. What's up? Did she...?
- She blew herself in.

553
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:28,334
Five thousand barrels is a cinch.

554
00:37:30,005 --> 00:37:31,063
Come on up here.

555
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,708
I'll be right back.
I gotta go down and send a telegram.

556
00:37:34,443 --> 00:37:36,468
Honey, did you hear that?
That was Shorty.

557
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:39,239
- You married a millionaire.
- John...

558
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:40,814
...please sit down.

559
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:42,575
What? What is it? What's the matter?

560
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,412
Please.

561
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:47,820
I was gonna tell you later,
before we went out to the well...

562
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,924
...but I can't put it off any longer.

563
00:37:50,092 --> 00:37:51,525
What is it?

564
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,389
I'm the girl he's been writing to, John.

565
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:55,925
What?

566
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,758
Betsy.

567
00:37:59,935 --> 00:38:04,668
The beautiful Betsy.
Elizabeth Bartlett, sure.

568
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,303
This is no good.

569
00:38:12,515 --> 00:38:14,415
Why didn't you tell me?

570
00:38:16,152 --> 00:38:17,449
Oh, darling...

571
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,852
...when you came to that table last night,
you were so fresh and sure of yourself...

572
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:26,427
...I thought it would be a surprise
and a big joke when you found out.

573
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,426
You see, later, it wasn't a joke anymore.

574
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,191
I tried to leave, knowing what you two
meant to each other.

575
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:35,326
- I would have gone to him, explained.
- No, you wouldn't have, John.

576
00:38:35,504 --> 00:38:37,529
Darling, I was so afraid.

577
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,173
I was afraid I'd lose you.

578
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:42,105
- But you told him you would marry him.
- No, I didn't.

579
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,746
Oh, no, I haven't been that unfair.

580
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:47,542
Listen, I've known Jonathan a long time.

581
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:52,676
I knew that he wanted to marry me but that
he felt that he should have more to offer.

582
00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:54,117
Oh, John...

583
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,487
...you see, back home,
life was piling up on me.

584
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,629
Teaching poetry to a lot of
high school kids that didn't like it...

585
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,264
...and didn't like me
because I made them learn it.

586
00:39:03,432 --> 00:39:08,426
Furnished rooms, cafeterias
and men you wouldn't shake a stick at.

587
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:10,595
Don't you see? Like any other girl...

588
00:39:10,773 --> 00:39:13,469
...I wanted a new life
and a home of my own too...

589
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:17,510
...so when Jonathan wrote me about
the life out here and the excitement...

590
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,649
...I just packed up
and took the first train.

591
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,580
I like Jonathan. I admire him...

592
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:28,086
...and I came out to see if perhaps
we could find a life together.

593
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:31,159
It's still no good.

594
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:35,354
- Well, I've knifed him in the back.
- Oh, no, John. Please believe me.

595
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:38,659
If I had left you last night,
I never would have married Jonathan.

596
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,268
I'd have gone away
without seeing him...

597
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:44,235
...because I knew I'd love only one man
the rest of my life.

598
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:46,237
Hey, open up and buy me a drink.

599
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:49,309
It's Cornelius Vanderfeller.
Come on, open up.

600
00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:51,446
I love you, John.

601
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,914
And I love you.

602
00:39:58,487 --> 00:40:01,217
Come on, hurry up. Open up. Open up.

603
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,154
Boy, did you miss it.
We were pounding the old...

604
00:40:04,994 --> 00:40:08,395
- Bet...?
- Jonathan.

605
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:11,731
We were married last night, Shorty.

606
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:14,766
Wait a minute. I don't get this.

607
00:40:14,937 --> 00:40:17,098
He never knew about us. I just told him.

608
00:40:17,273 --> 00:40:19,070
She wanted to go,
but I couldn't let her.

609
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:20,833
I couldn't let her go, see, Shorty?

610
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,343
It happened just that way,
so I dug up Judge Martin.

611
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,547
Well, say something, Shorty.
Take a sock at me or something.

612
00:40:30,286 --> 00:40:33,551
- You sure this is the way you want it?
- Yes, Jonathan.

613
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,782
You see,
when I came out here last night...

614
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,984
Okay, Betsy.

615
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:41,989
Thank you, Jonathan.

616
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:45,699
Well, I guess that's the way it is.

617
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:49,001
I gotta get to the well.
I got a lot of things to do.

618
00:40:49,171 --> 00:40:52,868
No need in you coming out right away.
I'll see you both out there later.

619
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,303
Honey, that's a guy.

620
00:41:30,346 --> 00:41:31,438
Ed.

621
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:32,739
Okay, everybody.

622
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:36,112
Come on and have a drink
with the Murphy boys from Arizona.

623
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,276
Ed, a Rolls-Royce.
You must be in the money.

624
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,921
- We are.
- Welcome home.

625
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:41,818
- Lucky Ed.
- Hey, Big John.

626
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,754
Big John! Pull over with that horse.

627
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:46,952
Come on over, we're setting them up.

628
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:50,292
Tom, Ed, you long-lost Comanches.
I heard you hit it.

629
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,435
- Yeah, we hit it, and we're spending it.
- Tom, Ed.

630
00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:56,127
Oh, am I glad to see you.

631
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,240
- Well, I see you brought a stranger.
- Hi, honey.

632
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:02,775
Stay away from him, baby.
He's an old married man now.

633
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:05,641
I never hurt you, did I?
How's the fireplace and slippers?

634
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,805
- Everything's fine. How you been?
- Just dandy.

635
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,747
Swell. Hey, two wildcats,
they tell me. Give me an earful.

636
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,147
How deep did you have to go?

637
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,448
Wouldn't mean nothing
to a big producer like you.

638
00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:17,592
- Is there any more good-looking...?
- A million acres of it.

639
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,160
- Let's all have a drink. Come on, baby.
- Say, I can't.

640
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,264
- My wife called and wants me home...
- We heard you got lassoed.

641
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:25,992
For life. And it's okay, pal.
But she wants me home early.

642
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,762
Something about the new house.
Don't go away, I'll be back.

643
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:31,269
- We'll be waiting for you.
- Not for long, brother.

644
00:42:36,545 --> 00:42:37,876
Hey, honey.

645
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:42,981
Behold the bridegroom.

646
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:45,677
Here, congratulations, my boy.
Have a drink.

647
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,755
- One year married and he can't believe it.
- Used 14 eggs.

648
00:42:48,924 --> 00:42:51,893
- Angel grub, they call it.
- Honey, I forgot.

649
00:42:52,661 --> 00:42:54,595
Well, that proves
I've really got a husband.

650
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:56,697
But I ought
to have a present or something.

651
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,958
I've got my present right here,
all around me.

652
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:01,693
Darn it, we ain't got much time
for that sparking.

653
00:43:02,104 --> 00:43:04,732
- We'll be ready, Harmony.
- Come on, everybody.

654
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:06,135
- To Betsy.
- Yes.

655
00:43:06,308 --> 00:43:08,970
To beautiful darling Betsy number one.

656
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:12,045
Hey, who do you think's in town?
Tom and Ed Murphy.

657
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,273
Just brought in
two wildcats up in Arizona.

658
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,715
What do you say we all go down
and meet them after dinner at the hotel?

659
00:43:18,153 --> 00:43:19,745
Sure, we can go...

660
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:24,181
...if you think they'll be interested
in a couple of old married people.

661
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:26,585
Honey, I'm sorry.

662
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:28,696
To heck with them.
Say, I gotta wash up.

663
00:43:29,364 --> 00:43:32,390
That must've been something, though,
right out of nothing.

664
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,968
A new wildcat and the moose
goes right into high gear.

665
00:43:35,137 --> 00:43:36,365
Doesn't he?

666
00:43:36,538 --> 00:43:39,336
I'm all set to carry on
our cutthroat heart game after dinner.

667
00:43:39,508 --> 00:43:42,443
- And, boy, will I give you the black queen.
- Oh, no, you won't.

668
00:43:42,611 --> 00:43:44,374
There's gonna be no heart game tonight.

669
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:47,208
You two boys are eating
and then running, if you don't mind.

670
00:43:47,382 --> 00:43:50,078
- But I haven't got anything to do...
- Well, Luther, you see...

671
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,447
...it's this way...

672
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:56,057
Why don't you just stop thinking
and go and pour me a drink.

673
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:58,420
I'm always mixing drinks or something.

674
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,427
Oh, they're such lovely flowers, Jonathan.
Thank you.

675
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,189
Place sure looks high-toned.

676
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:05,629
I guess that's the woman's hand
does that.

677
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:10,363
Well, it's not exactly the way I planned it,
but he took such an interest in it.

678
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:13,508
The horns from your well
over the mantel, and the guns.

679
00:44:13,675 --> 00:44:17,111
Oh, and that armor over there,
he calls it his Sir Modred suit.

680
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:22,540
Well, that's the way it is,
and that's the way I want it to be.

681
00:44:22,718 --> 00:44:26,586
It's where I want to live forever and ever
and never move away.

682
00:44:26,755 --> 00:44:28,655
- That was a great dinner, Betsy.
- Thanks.

683
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:30,348
- See you in the morning.
- Shorty...

684
00:44:30,526 --> 00:44:33,586
...why don't you see Tom and Ed
and get a line on that Arizona setup.

685
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:37,459
No, I better run out to the field. I wanna
take a look at number five. She's close.

686
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,691
- Good night.
- Good night.

687
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:41,461
- It's an invitation every year for you two.
- Thank you.

688
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,695
- Good night.
- Good night.

689
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:45,931
I still don't see why we couldn't
have had one hour's heart game.

690
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:48,440
Now I know you're over 60.

691
00:44:50,712 --> 00:44:53,180
You do want to hear all about it,
don't you?

692
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:55,908
- What?
- Those Arizona wildcats.

693
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:57,779
- No, honey, really.
- "No."

694
00:44:57,953 --> 00:45:01,514
You're about as convincing
as a little boy refusing a chocolate soda.

695
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,750
All right, come on. I've got some things
to do around here anyway.

696
00:45:04,927 --> 00:45:07,452
Only, it'll take about an hour,
for your information.

697
00:45:07,629 --> 00:45:09,358
- Sure you don't mind?
- No.

698
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:13,058
You go see the Murphy boys and sit around
and lie a little bit to each other...

699
00:45:13,235 --> 00:45:15,032
...and have a good time, see?

700
00:45:15,203 --> 00:45:18,434
Only, just remember, you've got
another wildcat waiting for you at home.

701
00:45:18,607 --> 00:45:20,575
Oh, will I.

702
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:23,600
- I won't be more than a hour, darling.
- Right.

703
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,246
- John. John. Betsy.
- What's happened?

704
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,981
- Number five caught fire. Where's John?
- Well, he went into town.

705
00:45:35,157 --> 00:45:37,182
You wake Harmony, I'll get a coat.

706
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,086
Harmony, go over to the firehouse.

707
00:45:41,263 --> 00:45:44,027
Get Wilson and his nitro truck.
Tell him to bring 100 quarts.

708
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,895
Swing that wildcat.

709
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:52,004
Everybody's a wildcat in Arizona,
huh, Ed?

710
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,940
Betsy, honey.

711
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:04,779
- Get out, Betsy. You don't belong in here.
- The Murphy boys.

712
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:07,148
- Do you hear me? You don't belong.
- Wait a minute.

713
00:46:07,322 --> 00:46:10,485
- Why did you bring her here?
- I'm not spying on you to spoil your fun.

714
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:12,126
You're free to go on with it.

715
00:46:12,294 --> 00:46:15,263
We just came to tell you
that number five is on fire.

716
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,557
- Number five on fire?
- Yeah, you coming?

717
00:46:21,603 --> 00:46:24,504
Harmony, take the missus home,
then come right out.

718
00:46:26,608 --> 00:46:29,975
- How did it start?
- Who cares? It started.

719
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:51,263
You get a hose on that tank.
If it goes, the whole field will go.

720
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:55,300
Everybody get back.

721
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,807
Hurry up with that shield.

722
00:47:05,981 --> 00:47:07,778
- Where's that nitro truck?
- Listen, boss.

723
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:09,610
This is too dangerous for you fellas.

724
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,379
Three cans of nitro will
blow her out like a birthday cake.

725
00:47:12,587 --> 00:47:16,182
But that's wild oil and gas.
Let's wait for them fire dogs from Ranger.

726
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:19,452
We haven't got time to wait for them.
This baby's way ahead of us.

727
00:47:24,766 --> 00:47:28,463
She's too hot. You can't get
the nitro in close enough to blow her out.

728
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,899
You just unload it.

729
00:47:30,072 --> 00:47:33,007
We'll get her close enough.
We're taking a shield in first.

730
00:47:33,175 --> 00:47:35,973
We'll take in the nitro on the next trip.

731
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:42,280
All right, hit the water.

732
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,862
The top casing's split.
You can't tell where she'll shoot now.

733
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:14,415
Put more pressure on those lines.

734
00:48:27,429 --> 00:48:29,863
If it was my durned well,
I'd let her burn herself out.

735
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:32,727
Quit yapping. Tell Jim
to put another hose on that tank.

736
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:34,528
All right.

737
00:48:34,803 --> 00:48:37,670
- Hot work, huh, Shorty?
- Lay off the Shorty.

738
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,307
Oh, behave. What did I do?

739
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:42,841
I just met Tom and Ed,
got a little high, that's all.

740
00:48:43,011 --> 00:48:45,343
I saw enough and heard enough
I didn't like.

741
00:48:46,248 --> 00:48:49,877
Okay. If you see anything or hear
anything you don't like from now on...

742
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:52,679
...don't go running to Betsy with it.
Just keep your nose...

743
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,819
What the dickens is the matter
with you two fellas?

744
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:59,256
Never mind about this.
Get that battery ready.

745
00:49:00,996 --> 00:49:04,022
Boys. Who's responsible
for this catastrophe?

746
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:05,632
Watch where you're going, buddy.

747
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:08,463
You kick that can of nitro
and you'll blow us to Alaska.

748
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:11,366
We'll touch it off after this trip,
so get the truck away.

749
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,666
Hang that wire on me.

750
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:15,036
Somebody must have
fallen asleep on the job.

751
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,871
Get the water.

752
00:49:19,314 --> 00:49:22,750
They're using too much nitro.
They'll blow up the whole field.

753
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,044
I'll lose a fortune.

754
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:49,434
Give me the wire!

755
00:49:55,517 --> 00:49:59,578
If that oil gets there first, the two Johns
will blow back on us like fried hamburger.

756
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:17,801
- Hug the ground back there.
- Get back.

757
00:50:25,347 --> 00:50:27,110
She's out.

758
00:50:29,217 --> 00:50:31,879
Wonderful, boys. Marvelous.

759
00:50:32,053 --> 00:50:35,250
I knew we'd do it. Look at her.

760
00:50:35,423 --> 00:50:37,618
Here, come on, fellas.
Do something, will you?

761
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:42,195
- We're wasting a lot of oil.
- It's the biggest gusher yet.

762
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,433
Isn't big enough.

763
00:50:48,136 --> 00:50:50,730
Call it. For the works.

764
00:50:50,906 --> 00:50:53,466
- Okay, the whole outfit.
- Call it.

765
00:50:53,642 --> 00:50:55,303
Tails.

766
00:51:00,315 --> 00:51:02,476
You're on my land.

767
00:51:04,786 --> 00:51:06,981
- Now, listen, Big John...
- Come on, everyone.

768
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:20,997
Look, big feller.
I'll fix you some nice, fresh coffee.

769
00:51:21,169 --> 00:51:23,262
Forget it. All I need is some sleep.

770
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,041
Did you put out the fire?

771
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:39,175
- So you're calling it quits, huh?
- No, I'm afraid you did that.

772
00:51:39,354 --> 00:51:42,118
You've always been straightforward
and direct about things...

773
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,019
...and this like everything else.

774
00:51:44,192 --> 00:51:46,683
Oh, don't worry.
There isn't going to be a scene.

775
00:51:47,095 --> 00:51:49,893
I'm just no good at picking wildcats,
I guess.

776
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:54,126
As you'd say, the land was pretty
attractive, but the structure fooled me.

777
00:51:54,302 --> 00:51:56,133
And now I'm down
to clay and salt water.

778
00:51:56,304 --> 00:52:00,468
Not that I blame the clay and salt water.
Some people might like it, but I don't.

779
00:52:00,642 --> 00:52:02,701
You sure got in way over your head,
didn't you?

780
00:52:02,877 --> 00:52:04,310
I'll be out of here in a minute.

781
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,175
Harmony can take me to the early train,
if you don't mind.

782
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:10,147
- Unless, of course, there's an explanation.
- No.

783
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,345
You got it all figured out.
You do it the way you want to.

784
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:35,607
Harmony, will you come
and get my bags, please?

785
00:52:38,046 --> 00:52:42,483
My God. God, did old Square John
sure give him what he deserved.

786
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,847
He broke him flatter
than a can on a railroad track.

787
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:47,386
You mean they had a fight?

788
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:50,251
Fight? They flipped for the whole field,
Miss Betsy...

789
00:52:50,425 --> 00:52:52,689
...and now that big, dumb
pit dog you're leaving...

790
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:56,729
...ain't worth much more than
that lead dollar that they tossed with.

791
00:52:57,365 --> 00:52:58,889
Yes, sir.

792
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:01,262
Long as you're gonna go, why...

793
00:53:01,436 --> 00:53:04,234
...you sure picked a nice morning for it.

794
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,768
Oh, my darling. You and Jonathan
mustn't fight about this.

795
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,773
- You've been such good friends.
- He and I have our own fight.

796
00:53:41,943 --> 00:53:43,604
That's my business.

797
00:53:43,778 --> 00:53:48,272
You and me, well,
that's your business, and mine.

798
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:50,247
So, what about it?

799
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:52,377
I don't want to leave you.

800
00:53:52,554 --> 00:53:55,489
All the time I was in here
packing like an idiot...

801
00:53:55,657 --> 00:53:58,490
...I was just wanting you
to come and put your arms around me...

802
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,628
...and tell me nothing happened.

803
00:54:00,795 --> 00:54:02,626
Nothing did.

804
00:54:02,997 --> 00:54:05,522
I'm such a fool.

805
00:54:07,068 --> 00:54:09,730
Oh, you're my gal.

806
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:17,904
But we're broke.
Gotta start in all over again.

807
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,912
- We'll go wildcatting, huh?
- It means selling this house.

808
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:22,481
Oh, who cares about this house?

809
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:25,915
I was just thinking this afternoon,
well, here we are, tied down to it.

810
00:54:26,087 --> 00:54:27,315
It's a millstone.

811
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:30,253
We're just buried under
a lot of plaster and 2-by-4s.

812
00:54:30,425 --> 00:54:34,122
- Honest? Do you feel that way?
- Sure I do.

813
00:54:34,295 --> 00:54:37,560
Oh, you are my gal.

814
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,461
Well, wildcatting it is.

815
00:54:40,635 --> 00:54:42,159
Our house will be wherever we are.

816
00:54:42,337 --> 00:54:44,862
If there's oil at the North Pole,
we'll live in an igloo.

817
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:47,371
And you won't freeze to death either.

818
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:55,314
Harmony, Harmony. Come on.
There's a big ruckus over at Eva's.

819
00:54:59,053 --> 00:55:01,283
All right. Come on, come on, come on.

820
00:55:01,456 --> 00:55:04,448
Does anybody else wanna say anything
about McMasters?

821
00:55:08,129 --> 00:55:09,562
Disturbing the peace, huh?

822
00:55:09,731 --> 00:55:12,256
Let's go to the calaboose.

823
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:15,965
Two agin one, it ain't manly.

824
00:55:16,137 --> 00:55:19,265
Look, sonny boy. Two weeks of this bust
is about enough.

825
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,500
- You're getting to be Huckleberry Finn.
- You don't understand.

826
00:55:22,677 --> 00:55:25,908
Big Moose is no good,
but I'm the only one's got a right to say so.

827
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,514
Well, why don't you start traveling
and hunt him up.

828
00:55:28,683 --> 00:55:31,151
- He's no good.
- Oh, I thought so.

829
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:33,014
Here again. Now, look here, my boy.

830
00:55:33,188 --> 00:55:35,315
You've got to sober up
and get back to the field.

831
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,391
I've got my business.
I can't handle your work and mine too.

832
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,255
- I've got a...
- Do you wanna buy me out?

833
00:55:40,428 --> 00:55:42,089
I couldn't. I'd...

834
00:55:42,263 --> 00:55:44,356
- For what price?
- Wait a minute, honey.

835
00:55:44,532 --> 00:55:45,726
Any price you say.

836
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,767
Well, now, that might be arranged, John.

837
00:55:48,937 --> 00:55:52,429
That's a good idea. I'll have
the papers in my office in half an hour.

838
00:55:52,607 --> 00:55:53,869
All right. I'll be there.

839
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:56,408
You can't go into a deal
with this vulture when...

840
00:55:56,578 --> 00:55:58,068
I'm through. I'm gonna go away.

841
00:55:58,246 --> 00:56:01,443
I never wanna see another oil derrick
as long as I live.

842
00:56:01,616 --> 00:56:04,176
Evie, you're a good kid,
but keep all your teeth.

843
00:56:04,352 --> 00:56:06,343
Oh, Square John.

844
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:09,285
I'll see you on the slab, Evie.

845
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:13,653
Listen, Square John,
I've been trying to tell you all the...

846
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,489
Why, I...

847
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:22,663
It wasn't your fault, was it?
You were just doing your job.

848
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,397
You're probably stuck on him too.

849
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,508
All right, here's your percentage
for this month.

850
00:57:39,681 --> 00:57:42,548
Good American dollars.
Business is getting a little better, see?

851
00:57:42,717 --> 00:57:43,979
But look... What is it?

852
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,719
That new batch of men off the boat
are signing up now.

853
00:57:46,888 --> 00:57:48,719
All right, I'll be right out.

854
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:51,654
General, you tell your boss
I gotta have a little cooperation.

855
00:57:51,826 --> 00:57:54,260
These lollipop guards of yours
are drunk half the time.

856
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,592
What happens to my layout if that crowd
throws you boys out of office?

857
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,993
Cockroaches.

858
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:01,795
Mr. Sand, everything is in the bag.

859
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:05,427
- Good day, my friend.
- What's good about it?

860
00:58:14,015 --> 00:58:15,243
Sign there, Fadden.

861
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:26,323
Sign there, McMasters.
That's at 50 bucks a day.

862
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:31,253
Hello, big man. Long time no see.

863
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:38,798
- He run this outfit?
- He's the owner, pal.

864
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,736
Mr. Sand.

865
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:45,040
Well, tell Mr. Sand
he can ram his 50 bucks a day up his nose.

866
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:47,340
I don't need the work.

867
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:49,849
Hey, you...

868
00:58:50,017 --> 00:58:53,544
- Why don't you let me bust him, boss.
- I'd rather have you keep your health.

869
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,249
Come here. Hello. Hello.

870
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,461
- Why, Jonathan.
- Hello, Betsy.

871
00:59:04,632 --> 00:59:08,966
- I kind of thought you'd be here.
- Come on in, Jonathan.

872
00:59:09,137 --> 00:59:11,298
I guess you heard about
me being here too, huh?

873
00:59:11,472 --> 00:59:15,135
Yes. John's down at the wharf
seeing about...

874
00:59:15,309 --> 00:59:19,302
He's getting the tickets,
you know, we're going on south.

875
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,141
- How's everything, Betsy?
- Oh, fine.

876
00:59:22,316 --> 00:59:24,443
You'll have to excuse
the way we look, you know.

877
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:27,019
What with repacking and everything.

878
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,883
Oh, you look well, Jonathan.

879
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:32,548
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll last till the rains come, I guess.

880
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,228
- No.
- What?

881
00:59:37,398 --> 00:59:39,195
You mean you didn't know?

882
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:42,097
Well, of course you didn't.
Come and look.

883
00:59:44,472 --> 00:59:46,337
- Look.
- Holy suffering water lilies.

884
00:59:46,507 --> 00:59:48,998
- When did this happen?
- Ten months ago in Oklahoma.

885
00:59:49,177 --> 00:59:52,271
We just made it to the hospital.
Little Jack.

886
00:59:55,574 --> 00:59:58,008
Don't you think he looks like his pop?

887
00:59:59,745 --> 01:00:02,043
He does around here.

888
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:04,339
I don't know.

889
01:00:06,251 --> 01:00:08,378
We'd better leave him.
He wants to be picked up.

890
01:00:08,554 --> 01:00:11,079
You know, he has to be asleep
when we start for the boat.

891
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:12,883
So long, partner.

892
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:18,126
Well, I've got to get on
with my packing, Jonathan. Sit down.

893
01:00:18,297 --> 01:00:21,664
- You must be doing big things down here.
- Oh, okay, I guess.

894
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:24,667
I could use somebody
to smoosh these candy politicians, though.

895
01:00:24,837 --> 01:00:28,136
- You couldn't get that ornery, no-good...?
- I'd give anything if I could...

896
01:00:28,307 --> 01:00:30,036
...but he won't even talk about it.

897
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,734
You know, you're still up, and he's...

898
01:00:32,911 --> 01:00:34,640
Well, it's pride, I guess.

899
01:00:34,813 --> 01:00:37,145
This place you're going to
is worse than this layout.

900
01:00:37,316 --> 01:00:38,647
It's double wages, though.

901
01:00:38,817 --> 01:00:42,275
He's got his eye on a wildcat back
in Oklahoma, and we're saving every nickel.

902
01:00:42,454 --> 01:00:45,321
It's no good, dragging you around like this.
You having to...

903
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:48,688
But, Jonathan,
I'm the happiest woman there is.

904
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:50,726
Don't you see? He needs me.

905
01:00:50,896 --> 01:00:53,091
But now, with Little Jackie and all...

906
01:00:53,265 --> 01:00:56,462
...we really need each other
for the first time because it's a struggle.

907
01:00:56,635 --> 01:00:59,798
Happiness comes out of a struggle,
Jonathan. I found that out.

908
01:00:59,972 --> 01:01:01,906
Still no reason
why you and the kid should...

909
01:01:02,074 --> 01:01:04,235
I never would've taken you
around like that...

910
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,275
You aren't taking her anywhere.

911
01:01:06,845 --> 01:01:08,369
John.

912
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:11,045
John, we've got to stop this.
We aren't children.

913
01:01:11,216 --> 01:01:12,740
Get out.

914
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:17,113
- Good luck, Betsy.
- Goodbye, Jonathan.

915
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,887
You haven't finished
your packing yet, have you?

916
01:01:24,063 --> 01:01:26,623
I'll see what
the guy in the back room will have.

917
01:01:29,735 --> 01:01:32,499
Here, here, here.

918
01:01:32,905 --> 01:01:34,770
Hold it, pal, hold it.

919
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,965
Here, here, here. Take it easy.

920
01:01:37,142 --> 01:01:40,737
Yes, yeah. There.

921
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,205
Everything's gonna be all right.

922
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,179
The Indian I leased the land from
gave a dance last night...

923
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,911
...and they all took a bath in it.

924
01:02:56,088 --> 01:02:59,615
You know, McMasters, we've been talking
about you quite a lot in New York.

925
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:04,922
With the other fields falling off fast, we can
give you quite a nice deal for next year.

926
01:03:05,164 --> 01:03:07,792
Mr. Compton, I'm not ready
to sign for next year just yet.

927
01:03:07,966 --> 01:03:09,194
- No?
- No.

928
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:12,929
The refining and distributing end
sounds like quite a game.

929
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:17,439
I was thinking maybe
that I might move into New York myself.

930
01:03:17,609 --> 01:03:19,634
- What?
- Sure, why not?

931
01:03:19,811 --> 01:03:22,473
But... But you have a perfect setup here.

932
01:03:22,648 --> 01:03:24,479
What do you want to
step into our end for?

933
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,117
Oh, I don't know.

934
01:03:26,285 --> 01:03:30,221
From where I'm standing,
your end looks like the big leagues to me.

935
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,118
- Daddy.
- Hi.

936
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:35,454
- Daddy, I steered it all the way.
- You did, huh?

937
01:03:35,627 --> 01:03:36,855
- Hi, honey.
- Hello.

938
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:39,224
- I want you to meet the president.
- How do you do?

939
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,662
How do you do, Mr. Compton.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

940
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:44,324
Mr. Smith and I want you
to look over the plans.

941
01:03:44,503 --> 01:03:47,028
Our new house.
You know those last minute mix-ups.

942
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:49,538
When you've planned for so long,
you want to be sure.

943
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,141
A new house, Mrs. McMasters?

944
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:54,211
But your husband was just telling me
you were moving to New York.

945
01:03:54,379 --> 01:03:56,347
New York? What?

946
01:03:56,515 --> 01:03:58,779
Oh, pipe dreams, honey.
Pay no attention.

947
01:03:59,051 --> 01:04:01,417
- Now, let's see.
- It's this end of the living room.

948
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:04,920
Look, I want to stop off at the car first.
Expecting a long-distance call.

949
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,251
- See you at the convention. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

950
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,519
Wait a minute. I'll be right with you.

951
01:04:09,728 --> 01:04:13,824
All you've got to do is to bring the study
wall right out to here and you've got it.

952
01:04:13,999 --> 01:04:15,557
Honey, I gotta beat it.

953
01:04:15,734 --> 01:04:17,167
- See you tonight.
- Yes.

954
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:19,167
So long. So long, speedy.

955
01:04:19,738 --> 01:04:22,366
- No, no. No hurry.
- Well, here we are.

956
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:24,839
Look. Your name
plastered over every other tank.

957
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,774
- What more do you want?
- It'd look just as good on a pipeline.

958
01:04:27,946 --> 01:04:30,608
Well, well, well. So you'd build
your own pipeline. Come in.

959
01:04:36,788 --> 01:04:40,280
Well, where would your pipelines go?
To whose refineries?

960
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:42,450
I guess I'll have to
put up my own refineries.

961
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:46,064
Your own refineries? Sit down.

962
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:48,131
But then how would you
sell your gasoline?

963
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,631
Where's your distribution?

964
01:04:49,801 --> 01:04:52,235
Looks like I'll have to put up
my own filling stations.

965
01:04:52,404 --> 01:04:55,862
All over the East, eh?
Right kitty-corner from mine, maybe?

966
01:04:56,441 --> 01:05:00,172
- Maybe.
- Why, that almost sounds like competition.

967
01:05:00,345 --> 01:05:03,576
- Yeah, it does, if I did it.
- New York office calling, Mr. Compton.

968
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:05,444
I'll take it in there. Oh, Karen.

969
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:06,914
Come here, old man.

970
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:08,950
I want you to meet McMasters.
Miss Vanmeer.

971
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:10,679
- How do you do.
- Big John McMasters.

972
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:13,916
You may have heard me speak of him.
Thinking of moving into New York.

973
01:05:14,192 --> 01:05:16,752
Get him a drink or something.
He's a big oil man out here.

974
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:20,155
Don't mind Harry.
He likes to insult people he respects.

975
01:05:20,332 --> 01:05:22,732
- What kind of a drink will it be?
- Nothing, thanks.

976
01:05:22,901 --> 01:05:25,165
Little too early in the day for me.

977
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:28,466
You know, you're much younger
than I thought you'd be.

978
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,404
What'd you expect, stranger?
A bald head and a breadbasket?

979
01:05:31,576 --> 01:05:34,340
Well, stranger, they told me
you were an oil baron.

980
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,310
Is that the way they grow them
back East?

981
01:05:36,481 --> 01:05:39,177
In spite of all their steam baths.

982
01:05:40,018 --> 01:05:42,919
Say, this is quite a caboose
he's got here.

983
01:05:43,088 --> 01:05:44,919
- This one of his nags?
- Yes.

984
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:48,958
- Interested in horses?
- Sure, everybody goes for a good horse.

985
01:05:49,127 --> 01:05:51,254
Harry's just bringing back a string
from Tijuana.

986
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,728
They're in the next car.
Would you like to see them?

987
01:05:53,899 --> 01:05:56,197
- Sure, fine.
- All right.

988
01:05:57,636 --> 01:05:59,831
And this is Green Devil by Blue Star.

989
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:02,200
You've heard of him, haven't you?

990
01:06:03,141 --> 01:06:04,369
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

991
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,670
"Yeah, yeah." Where did you go
all of a sudden?

992
01:06:06,845 --> 01:06:08,574
- Sorry.
- It wasn't New York, was it?

993
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:10,305
Yeah, I'm afraid you got me.

994
01:06:10,482 --> 01:06:14,714
You look very happy right here. Why do
you really want to go to New York?

995
01:06:14,886 --> 01:06:16,376
Oh, I don't know.

996
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,922
I remember when I was in short pants,
a big redheaded kid had two apples...

997
01:06:20,092 --> 01:06:21,957
...and dared me to take one
away from him.

998
01:06:22,127 --> 01:06:24,925
- Did you do it?
- Yeah. It was fun.

999
01:06:25,697 --> 01:06:27,631
Harry's not a redheaded kid.

1000
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:31,496
He is grown up, and in New York,
you'd be running right into his backyard.

1001
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,035
Sounds good.

1002
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:36,265
I don't like to stay in one place
too long anyhow.

1003
01:06:36,441 --> 01:06:38,102
Well, partner?

1004
01:06:38,276 --> 01:06:40,676
New York's a rough town, partner.

1005
01:06:40,846 --> 01:06:44,282
I guess you've never been in
Burkburnett or Whizbang or Ranger.

1006
01:06:44,449 --> 01:06:46,974
Oh, no, I mean quietly rough.
No shooting from the hip.

1007
01:06:47,152 --> 01:06:49,916
Just stab in the back
with white kid gloves.

1008
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:53,255
Take it from one who knows oil,
Big John.

1009
01:06:53,425 --> 01:06:55,359
What does a girl like you
know about oil?

1010
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:57,461
I know the men that control it.

1011
01:06:57,629 --> 01:07:00,257
I hear things at dinner parties,
nightclubs...

1012
01:07:00,432 --> 01:07:03,868
...anywhere where men are off guard
and wives talk.

1013
01:07:04,035 --> 01:07:06,629
You're sort of Harry's
private-detective agency, huh?

1014
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:09,137
- Sort of.
- Well, thanks for the tip.

1015
01:07:09,307 --> 01:07:11,935
But I still think that
Harry's my redheaded boy.

1016
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:15,511
All right, but don't start crying
when they put you against the wall...

1017
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,307
...without even a blindfold.

1018
01:07:17,482 --> 01:07:19,780
Well, at least they'd know
they'd been in a scrap.

1019
01:07:21,386 --> 01:07:23,411
I guess they would, at that.

1020
01:07:27,058 --> 01:07:29,686
- What's the matter?
- You in New York.

1021
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:31,692
Did you buy that yourself?

1022
01:07:31,863 --> 01:07:34,798
Sure, 5000 bucks' worth. Why?

1023
01:07:35,267 --> 01:07:37,827
I thought it might have been
your mother's or something...

1024
01:07:38,003 --> 01:07:40,403
...and you were wearing it
for sentimental reasons.

1025
01:07:40,572 --> 01:07:41,971
I don't get you.

1026
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,664
That's all right.

1027
01:07:44,476 --> 01:07:47,036
Well, Big John,
I may be a little crazy...

1028
01:07:47,212 --> 01:07:50,045
...but if you move to New York,
I'll be cheering for you.

1029
01:07:50,215 --> 01:07:51,807
Will you save me a ringside seat?

1030
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:54,577
Well, come on, old man.
We'd better go up to the meeting.

1031
01:07:54,753 --> 01:07:56,653
How did he like my gee-gees, Karen?

1032
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,346
I hope he thought they were nice.

1033
01:07:58,523 --> 01:08:00,150
- Goodbye.
- So long.

1034
01:08:00,325 --> 01:08:02,350
Be back this afternoon, Karen.

1035
01:08:05,397 --> 01:08:07,456
Clever girl, isn't she?

1036
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:09,327
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

1037
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:11,969
We met in the Dutch West Indies,
at the Maracaibo field.

1038
01:08:12,137 --> 01:08:13,832
She was married to a young geologist.

1039
01:08:14,005 --> 01:08:16,098
She didn't like it down there.

1040
01:08:56,081 --> 01:08:58,311
Hey. Hey.

1041
01:09:00,118 --> 01:09:03,110
- Going to town?
- Sure. Hop on in.

1042
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,016
Nice car you got here.

1043
01:09:08,193 --> 01:09:12,994
You bet. Got three more, same kind,
red, yellow, green.

1044
01:09:13,164 --> 01:09:15,826
Sometime one run out of gas.

1045
01:09:19,538 --> 01:09:21,335
You know this fella John McMasters?

1046
01:09:21,506 --> 01:09:23,872
Yeah. Him fine man.

1047
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:28,604
We shoot crap together.
Him like me very much.

1048
01:09:36,121 --> 01:09:37,383
- Yes, sir?
- Corner room.

1049
01:09:37,556 --> 01:09:39,023
Yes, sir.

1050
01:09:39,457 --> 01:09:41,425
So long, Mr. Compton.
Glad to have had you.

1051
01:09:41,593 --> 01:09:43,857
Fine. A very informative meeting,
gentlemen.

1052
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:46,293
Well, I have to pull out this afternoon.

1053
01:09:46,464 --> 01:09:49,399
If I were you, I'd forget
that New York idea.

1054
01:09:49,568 --> 01:09:51,001
Yeah? Well, who can tell?

1055
01:09:51,169 --> 01:09:53,603
Well, so long, Big John.

1056
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,603
Yeah, so long.

1057
01:09:58,443 --> 01:10:00,308
Your... Your luggage, Mr. Sand?

1058
01:10:00,478 --> 01:10:02,969
Oh, no, no luggage.
I came in my private car.

1059
01:10:03,148 --> 01:10:06,584
I won't go up right now, but have
the chef fix dinner for six tonight.

1060
01:10:06,751 --> 01:10:08,582
- I'll leave everything to him.
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:10:08,753 --> 01:10:11,119
Hey, Shorty,
didn't you forget the wine?

1062
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:14,486
Well, well, well. How are you?

1063
01:10:14,659 --> 01:10:16,058
Fine, fine.

1064
01:10:16,227 --> 01:10:18,661
Sorry to hear they took you
to the cleaners down there.

1065
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:21,196
Well, the other side took over...

1066
01:10:21,366 --> 01:10:23,857
...but you know me.
I came out with twice what I put in.

1067
01:10:24,903 --> 01:10:26,962
Well, that's fine. I might have known it.

1068
01:10:27,138 --> 01:10:29,538
Sure, sure.
I was way ahead of them all the time.

1069
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:31,699
If that's so,
I got a big proposition for you.

1070
01:10:31,876 --> 01:10:33,867
A lot of dough in it for us.
What do you say?

1071
01:10:34,045 --> 01:10:36,980
- Well, now, I don't know.
- You don't have to provide cash now.

1072
01:10:37,148 --> 01:10:39,343
For a long time,
I've been looking for a guy who...

1073
01:10:39,517 --> 01:10:44,181
No, no, I don't think so. I got too
many things in the fire right now.

1074
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:47,291
How are things at the convention?
Anything interesting?

1075
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:51,020
Nothing much. Harry Compton and the
crowd just dropped in from the East.

1076
01:10:51,196 --> 01:10:52,458
- Is Harry in town?
- Yeah.

1077
01:10:52,631 --> 01:10:55,464
Well, like to see the old boy.
Might have a big deal on.

1078
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:58,667
Well, there he is, right over there.

1079
01:11:00,605 --> 01:11:02,129
The guy on the phone.

1080
01:11:02,774 --> 01:11:04,765
Oh, yes, yes, I didn't see him.

1081
01:11:04,943 --> 01:11:07,207
- Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Yeah, so long.

1082
01:11:07,379 --> 01:11:10,246
- Yes, that sounds all right to me.
- Only one Corona Perfecto.

1083
01:11:10,415 --> 01:11:11,643
Darn that doctor.

1084
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:15,119
- There you are. The 4 bits is yours.
- Hi, John Sand.

1085
01:11:15,286 --> 01:11:17,277
Well, if it ain't John Sand.
You old maverick.

1086
01:11:17,455 --> 01:11:19,582
- Well, Tom and Ed.
- How are you, John?

1087
01:11:19,758 --> 01:11:22,226
- Well, how goes it, boys?
- We're lucky we run into you.

1088
01:11:22,394 --> 01:11:25,090
Real oil men in this town
are scarcer than poor Indians.

1089
01:11:25,263 --> 01:11:27,731
Yeah. You and us have gotta
have a deal right off, John.

1090
01:11:27,899 --> 01:11:30,697
Look. We got us a cinch
wildcat lease here.

1091
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:34,066
It ain't near any proven stuff, but...
Sit down here a minute.

1092
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:39,070
The anticline runs right through here.

1093
01:11:39,244 --> 01:11:41,075
We know there's oil five miles over here.

1094
01:11:41,246 --> 01:11:43,373
We know there's oil
five miles in this direction.

1095
01:11:43,548 --> 01:11:45,641
And that's the whole thing.
Now, look, John...

1096
01:11:45,817 --> 01:11:49,844
...if you'll just stake us to the tools
and equipment, you'll be in it for half.

1097
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:52,285
- Now, don't that sound good?
- Sure does. Sure does.

1098
01:11:52,457 --> 01:11:54,584
All you need is some tools
and a string of pipe?

1099
01:11:54,759 --> 01:11:56,454
We've been over to see Luther Aldrich.

1100
01:11:56,628 --> 01:11:58,562
- He sat there...
- Is Luther Aldrich in town?

1101
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,527
Yeah. Moved his main office up here.

1102
01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:04,897
He's got the money, but you couldn't
blast a cent out of him with nitro.

1103
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,470
Well, I don't know.
I got so many things in the fire.

1104
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:10,802
But I'll tell you what I'll do.
Give me 24 hours to think it over.

1105
01:12:10,975 --> 01:12:13,375
- Well, my boy, my boy.
- Luther, old boy...

1106
01:12:13,545 --> 01:12:15,843
...good to see you again.
You haven't changed a bit.

1107
01:12:16,014 --> 01:12:18,039
Thanks. It's like old times.

1108
01:12:18,216 --> 01:12:22,209
You know, I've been following your
sensational career with great interest.

1109
01:12:22,387 --> 01:12:24,184
Luther, I came to get a string of tools.

1110
01:12:24,355 --> 01:12:26,846
Oh, of course. Well, here it is.
Take your pick.

1111
01:12:27,025 --> 01:12:29,619
You see, the trouble is,
it'd be a couple of months be...

1112
01:12:29,794 --> 01:12:32,763
My money's tied up in the foreign
banks. You know, politics and...

1113
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:36,765
Well, don't give it a thought.
All you want, and all the time to pay.

1114
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:39,301
Sky's the limit, up to 50,000,
if you want it.

1115
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:41,701
Here, wait a minute.
I'll get my order blank.

1116
01:12:41,873 --> 01:12:44,501
Well, I take it all back, Luther.
You have changed.

1117
01:12:44,676 --> 01:12:47,543
Well, you know,
a fella mellows with age.

1118
01:12:47,712 --> 01:12:51,273
Why, even back in Burkburnett,
I wasn't really sore, remember...

1119
01:12:51,449 --> 01:12:54,612
...when you two fellas stole that pipe?

1120
01:12:54,786 --> 01:12:58,119
No. You and Harmony and the sheriff
were just out hunting quail that day.

1121
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:00,450
Yeah, quail. Yes.

1122
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:03,093
Well, Big John's doing fine now.

1123
01:13:03,261 --> 01:13:05,525
- Yeah, yeah. I'm glad to hear it.
- Yeah, you are?

1124
01:13:05,697 --> 01:13:07,631
Why don't you two fellas
bury the hatchet.

1125
01:13:07,799 --> 01:13:09,858
We'll bump into one another
one of these days.

1126
01:13:10,034 --> 01:13:13,003
No time like the present.
He's in my office right now.

1127
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:15,662
Why, we were just talking about you.
He isn't sore.

1128
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,273
- He said that he...
- I get it. I...

1129
01:13:17,442 --> 01:13:19,376
- No wonder I thought you'd gone nuts.
- Why?

1130
01:13:19,544 --> 01:13:21,273
How would you like to eat that pipe?

1131
01:13:21,446 --> 01:13:23,778
- You slaphappy windbag.
- What?

1132
01:13:23,948 --> 01:13:26,712
Okay, Shorty,
I was trying to stake you.

1133
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:30,048
But stop being like a mule ready to kick
himself when he's down and...

1134
01:13:30,221 --> 01:13:31,984
I don't need any handouts from you.

1135
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,720
Here, now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, my boy.

1136
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:37,862
To err is human, to forgive divine.

1137
01:13:38,763 --> 01:13:40,731
- That's sharp.
- Now, just a minute, Shorty.

1138
01:13:40,932 --> 01:13:42,263
Simmer down, will you, Shorty.

1139
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:45,231
- You know you always did better with me.
- Oh, so that's it.

1140
01:13:45,403 --> 01:13:47,598
Who was smart enough
to grab off that first lease?

1141
01:13:47,772 --> 01:13:49,831
Yeah, who was smart enough
to get the tools?

1142
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:52,909
What happened when I left?
You turned up your toes and went loco.

1143
01:13:53,077 --> 01:13:56,308
Then you let those tin soldiers take you
for everything but your drawers.

1144
01:13:56,481 --> 01:13:59,507
Oh, come on back in with me, Shorty.
Let's make it happy days again.

1145
01:13:59,684 --> 01:14:02,482
I don't need you, never did.
Don't hold your breath until I do.

1146
01:14:02,654 --> 01:14:04,781
- And don't call me Shorty.
- Okay, little man.

1147
01:14:04,956 --> 01:14:08,016
Play hard to get. Just don't change
your mind, I won't be here.

1148
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:11,094
I'm moving East. I'm walking in on
New York, on the real show.

1149
01:14:11,262 --> 01:14:14,595
So when you whistle for me,
I'll whistle back with a blowpipe.

1150
01:14:36,888 --> 01:14:40,415
Boy, who said the big city
is no place in the spring?

1151
01:14:41,092 --> 01:14:43,060
Isn't it great? Smell that fresh air.

1152
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,820
Carbon monoxide.

1153
01:14:44,996 --> 01:14:46,429
I'd rather smell fresh oil.

1154
01:14:46,598 --> 01:14:49,465
Why? You're in the consumer's end
of the business now.

1155
01:14:49,634 --> 01:14:51,295
Oh, jokes?

1156
01:14:51,469 --> 01:14:54,529
Feeling pretty chipper for a man who
got home at 3:00 in the morning.

1157
01:14:54,706 --> 01:14:57,903
That's the way they do business
in this town, 24 hours a day.

1158
01:14:58,343 --> 01:15:00,311
Looks like you're
taking the town by storm.

1159
01:15:00,478 --> 01:15:02,969
Compton and his gang know I'm here,
I guess.

1160
01:15:03,147 --> 01:15:05,615
Honey. You're happy, aren't you?

1161
01:15:05,783 --> 01:15:07,250
Yes, if you are.

1162
01:15:07,418 --> 01:15:09,045
Hey, of course I am.

1163
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,915
Are you sure?

1164
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:13,281
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

1165
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,016
I'm just kidding.

1166
01:15:15,193 --> 01:15:19,960
Go on up and slave, only let's have
dinner together tonight for a change.

1167
01:15:20,131 --> 01:15:21,621
I'll try, honey.

1168
01:15:23,935 --> 01:15:27,996
Look, I thought I'd have a few people in
Sunday night, and I need an extra girl.

1169
01:15:28,172 --> 01:15:30,231
- Whom do you suggest?
- Search me. I don't know.

1170
01:15:30,408 --> 01:15:33,434
Well, I thought, perhaps,
what about Karen Vanmeer?

1171
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:35,044
We haven't seen her for ages...

1172
01:15:35,213 --> 01:15:37,272
...and she was so nice
when we first came here.

1173
01:15:37,448 --> 01:15:39,541
- She still works for you, doesn't she?
- Sure...

1174
01:15:39,717 --> 01:15:42,049
...but I don't know.
She changes crowds.

1175
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,482
Get somebody else.

1176
01:15:43,655 --> 01:15:45,179
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1177
01:15:49,093 --> 01:15:50,390
- Good morning.
- Mr. McMasters.

1178
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:51,789
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1179
01:15:51,963 --> 01:15:53,191
- Mr. McMasters.
- Morning.

1180
01:15:53,364 --> 01:15:56,162
- Girls, I want you to understand...
- Girls, the boss is here.

1181
01:15:56,334 --> 01:15:58,063
- Good morning, Mr. McMasters.
- Morning.

1182
01:15:58,236 --> 01:16:00,067
That will be all.

1183
01:16:01,906 --> 01:16:03,635
- <i>Yes?</i>
- He's here, Mr. McCreery.

1184
01:16:03,808 --> 01:16:05,469
- You can come in now.
- What's that?

1185
01:16:05,643 --> 01:16:08,806
Mr. Felton with Mr. McCreery and
Mr. Ward about the Lynbrook refinery.

1186
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,572
Great day for the race, Miss Barnes.

1187
01:16:11,082 --> 01:16:13,209
- What race?
- The human race.

1188
01:16:13,384 --> 01:16:14,942
- Yes, of course.
- Good morning, J.M.

1189
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:16,347
- Morning.
- Hi, fellas.

1190
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:19,319
We took the plans and
went through the plant yesterday...

1191
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:21,219
...with Mr. Laughlin and the engineers.

1192
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:23,383
What did you find?
Is it up to specifications?

1193
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:25,825
Yes, we think it's a great buy, J.M.

1194
01:16:26,464 --> 01:16:29,831
- Get me Miss Vanmeer.
- Here are the final purchase contracts.

1195
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:32,799
- What's the whole nut?
- Refinery and cracking plant together...

1196
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:34,461
...about 500,000.

1197
01:16:35,673 --> 01:16:38,233
Hello? Oh, hello, Miss Vanmeer.
How are you?

1198
01:16:38,409 --> 01:16:42,072
I'm fine and half asleep and wonderful.

1199
01:16:42,246 --> 01:16:44,680
Just hoping you'd call.

1200
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,442
So formal.

1201
01:16:47,618 --> 01:16:49,916
Why don't you call
when you're not in a crowd.

1202
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:54,457
I'll bet McCreery's peering at you
over his glasses like an owl.

1203
01:16:56,794 --> 01:16:58,489
Yes, you're very right about that.

1204
01:16:58,663 --> 01:17:01,359
And I can see from here that
you have got your coat off...

1205
01:17:01,532 --> 01:17:03,864
...and your vest unbuttoned.
And shame on you.

1206
01:17:04,035 --> 01:17:05,366
Okay, okay.

1207
01:17:05,536 --> 01:17:08,198
Say, we've got a chance to buy
Henderson's Lynbrook plant...

1208
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,898
...for 500,000. I wanted to know
if you'd heard anything.

1209
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:14,374
Careful, now. I had Willie Henderson
at the Bromleys' the other night...

1210
01:17:14,545 --> 01:17:16,445
...through about two quarts
of champagne.

1211
01:17:16,614 --> 01:17:18,844
Halfway through the second,
he dropped a hint.

1212
01:17:19,017 --> 01:17:22,043
Those Lynbrook gentlemen
are facing bankruptcy.

1213
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,586
Thanks, Miss Vanmeer.
I thought as much.

1214
01:17:24,756 --> 01:17:26,951
Say, on second thought...

1215
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:29,559
...you'd better meet that gentleman
for dinner tonight.

1216
01:17:30,094 --> 01:17:34,463
Is this gentleman tall and dark,
and with a Texas accent?

1217
01:17:35,533 --> 01:17:36,761
He is.

1218
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:40,836
Well, then start all over again
and ask me nicer than that.

1219
01:17:41,005 --> 01:17:42,836
I'm sorry, but that's an order.

1220
01:17:43,007 --> 01:17:45,908
Darling, you give the nicest orders.

1221
01:17:46,077 --> 01:17:47,977
Goodbye, Miss Vanmeer.

1222
01:17:48,146 --> 01:17:49,807
Well, boys, I...

1223
01:17:55,153 --> 01:17:57,314
- Shorty's in town.
- Shorty?

1224
01:17:57,488 --> 01:17:59,149
Yeah, yeah. My old partner,
John Sand.

1225
01:17:59,323 --> 01:18:02,315
Oh, yes? He certainly struck it big
in Oklahoma, didn't he?

1226
01:18:02,493 --> 01:18:04,620
What did Miss Vanmeer say, J. M?

1227
01:18:05,063 --> 01:18:06,360
Oh, yes, yes.

1228
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:09,398
We'll wait. I think we'll be able
to pick it up a lot cheaper.

1229
01:18:09,567 --> 01:18:11,933
Now, wait a minute, J.M.
Miss Vanmeer may be right...

1230
01:18:12,103 --> 01:18:14,503
...but there's a possibility
of losing this. I think...

1231
01:18:14,672 --> 01:18:17,766
Her tips are right from the barn, Mac.
She's never failed yet.

1232
01:18:17,942 --> 01:18:20,536
All right. After all, it's your money.

1233
01:18:28,953 --> 01:18:31,251
You've quite a lot of mail to answer.

1234
01:18:31,422 --> 01:18:33,890
I haven't had a phone call this morning
from a Mr. Sand?

1235
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:35,582
You know, John Sand from Oklahoma?

1236
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,159
No, you haven't.

1237
01:18:37,328 --> 01:18:39,455
Get him for me, will you?
He's at the Waldorf.

1238
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:43,532
Well, Mr. Sand is registered here,
but he won't be back until this evening.

1239
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:45,225
What?

1240
01:18:45,403 --> 01:18:47,394
Why, he said he was going
to the races.

1241
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,047
<i>A huge crowd is out here today...</i>

1242
01:18:57,215 --> 01:19:00,013
<i>... for another running of this</i>
<i>classic under ideal conditions.</i>

1243
01:19:00,184 --> 01:19:03,153
<i>As I look over this line of</i>
<i>the nation's finest thoroughbreds...</i>

1244
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:05,516
- <i>... I can see number five.</i>
- I like number three.

1245
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:07,021
- Three?
- Yes.

1246
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:08,852
He's got a little age on him.

1247
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,885
Nine years...

1248
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:16,923
- Well, well. Hiya.
- Well, how are you?

1249
01:19:17,101 --> 01:19:19,569
- Fine.
- John. What do you know about that.

1250
01:19:19,737 --> 01:19:20,965
Luther, old man.

1251
01:19:21,139 --> 01:19:23,130
We were just saying
on the train yesterday...

1252
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:25,639
...we'd probably run into
the big moose in New York.

1253
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:27,038
- Weren't we?
- Yeah.

1254
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:30,510
Hey, I heard about you stumbling onto
that big field out there.

1255
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:32,444
Yeah, I was pretty lucky, I guess.

1256
01:19:32,617 --> 01:19:34,141
The biggest field in Oklahoma now.

1257
01:19:34,318 --> 01:19:35,751
- I bought out the Murphys.
- Yeah?

1258
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,480
Yeah. I guess I was always
supposed to play the lone wolf.

1259
01:19:38,656 --> 01:19:40,317
One head is better than two, I say.

1260
01:19:40,491 --> 01:19:43,051
Yeah, sure, sure.
You know, I find it that way here.

1261
01:19:43,227 --> 01:19:46,128
<i>Sun Helmet to the front.</i>
<i>Faraday, second. Blue Comet, third.</i>

1262
01:19:46,297 --> 01:19:48,288
I made the bets.
Moonray to win, number nine.

1263
01:19:48,466 --> 01:19:51,060
- Good.
- If it isn't my old friend McMasters.

1264
01:19:51,235 --> 01:19:53,294
- Hi.
- <i>Moonray is moving up fast...</i>

1265
01:19:53,471 --> 01:19:56,235
<i>... between horses. It's Moonray</i>
<i>and Sun Helmet, neck and neck.</i>

1266
01:19:56,407 --> 01:19:58,534
<i>Moonray is going away.</i>
<i>It's gonna be Moonray.</i>

1267
01:20:00,111 --> 01:20:02,909
Well, gentlemen, that's us.
Come on, come on.

1268
01:20:03,781 --> 01:20:05,373
So you're going in with Compton?

1269
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,245
He's liable to make you a big guy.

1270
01:20:07,418 --> 01:20:09,682
I been doing well on my own,
if anybody should ask.

1271
01:20:09,854 --> 01:20:13,017
Jonathan, just because you and I
are going in with Harry against him...

1272
01:20:13,191 --> 01:20:14,419
...is no reason to...
- What?

1273
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,253
Hey. Is he in with you?

1274
01:20:16,427 --> 01:20:18,827
Well, I'm interested in a small way.

1275
01:20:18,996 --> 01:20:21,692
Luther broke down and staked me
to the first string of tools.

1276
01:20:21,866 --> 01:20:23,925
I only had to give him
10 percent of the field.

1277
01:20:24,101 --> 01:20:26,296
What? He staked you?

1278
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:28,404
- You dirty double-crosser.
- Wait a minute.

1279
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:31,599
- Don't fly off half-cocked. I...
- I'll fly a kite down your windpipe.

1280
01:20:31,776 --> 01:20:33,903
- Well...
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1281
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:36,444
Did you guarantee
that equipment for me?

1282
01:20:36,914 --> 01:20:40,077
Well, he didn't have to put up
any money. Our oil well came in.

1283
01:20:40,251 --> 01:20:42,082
- Everything's perfectly...
- lf it hadn't...

1284
01:20:42,253 --> 01:20:44,187
...you'd be in my checkbook
like a pressed pansy.

1285
01:20:44,355 --> 01:20:46,687
Are you insinuating that
I'm an unethical character?

1286
01:20:46,857 --> 01:20:49,121
- No. You're just a crooked old jerk.
- Jerk?

1287
01:20:49,293 --> 01:20:53,753
Why, back in Burkburnett,
you two fellas stole half of my...

1288
01:20:57,068 --> 01:20:59,764
- Scotch.
- Hey, Shorty...

1289
01:20:59,937 --> 01:21:02,405
...back in my office,
I got me two quarts of red liquor.

1290
01:21:02,573 --> 01:21:04,803
Bourbon. What do you say?

1291
01:21:04,976 --> 01:21:06,705
- Let's go.
- Well, that's fine.

1292
01:21:06,877 --> 01:21:08,674
- I'll wait for Harry and he'll...
- No, no.

1293
01:21:08,846 --> 01:21:11,144
What? Why?
Here, now, wait a minute.

1294
01:21:11,315 --> 01:21:14,409
What are you doing? You can't rustle
me around like one of the horses.

1295
01:21:14,585 --> 01:21:17,179
I didn't come here to be insulted.

1296
01:21:17,355 --> 01:21:20,290
Get back, or we'll have the warden
take away your candy allowance.

1297
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:23,552
I'm gonna have this settled,
once and for all. When I first met...

1298
01:21:23,728 --> 01:21:27,220
When I first met you two thugs,
you were over here...

1299
01:21:27,398 --> 01:21:28,729
I'm sorry, Mr. McMasters...

1300
01:21:28,899 --> 01:21:31,993
...but Mr. Compton is on the phone
again for Mr. Sand and Mr. Aldrich.

1301
01:21:32,169 --> 01:21:34,000
- Tell...
- Say Mr. Aldrich is having a baby.

1302
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:36,071
- But this is outrageous.
- Look.

1303
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,403
I've got a big office next door
just waiting for your name on the door.

1304
01:21:39,577 --> 01:21:41,738
I knew that when we left the racetrack.

1305
01:21:41,912 --> 01:21:43,846
But wait a minute.
We told Compton that...

1306
01:21:44,015 --> 01:21:46,506
- Where's my office?
- Right underneath the warden's.

1307
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:49,016
Mr. McMasters, your tailor is here.

1308
01:21:49,186 --> 01:21:52,087
Tell him to go away.
Come back next year when I...

1309
01:21:52,256 --> 01:21:54,781
No, wait a minute. Bring him in.

1310
01:21:54,959 --> 01:21:56,187
We got work to do.

1311
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,793
When you two fellas sober up...

1312
01:21:57,962 --> 01:22:00,988
...you can call me at my hotel.

1313
01:22:01,165 --> 01:22:04,896
- Mr. Luther.
- Better fit them both for straitjackets.

1314
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:08,968
- <i>Bonjour</i>, Monsieur McMasters.
- Hi, Ferdie. Never mind my stuff.

1315
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,698
You got a new customer, Mr. Sand.

1316
01:22:11,609 --> 01:22:12,871
What goes on here?

1317
01:22:13,044 --> 01:22:14,636
You're buying a couple dozen suits.

1318
01:22:14,812 --> 01:22:16,143
- I got two suits.
- Two suits?

1319
01:22:16,314 --> 01:22:18,748
It's New York. You look like
a Houston house detective.

1320
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:21,214
You got anything
that you think Mr. Sand might like?

1321
01:22:22,787 --> 01:22:25,449
That wonderful new, striking
Harris tweed you ordered.

1322
01:22:25,623 --> 01:22:27,022
Oh, yes, yes.

1323
01:22:27,191 --> 01:22:29,318
Say, that ought to look
all right on you, Shorty.

1324
01:22:29,493 --> 01:22:32,462
- Don't you think so, Ferdie?
- Let me see.

1325
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:36,327
Yes. The buff brings out
the ruddiness in his complexion.

1326
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,297
Wait a minute.
Is this guy on the level?

1327
01:22:38,469 --> 01:22:42,337
That's imported stuff. Old women
weave it in cottages over in Scotland.

1328
01:22:42,506 --> 01:22:44,701
Let Mr. Sand smell it, Ferdie.

1329
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:47,605
Get that intriguing aroma
from the peat fires?

1330
01:22:47,778 --> 01:22:50,406
- Smells a little gamy.
- You fellows kill me.

1331
01:22:50,581 --> 01:22:52,378
Get a load of those shoulders,
Ferdie.

1332
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,882
- Could you do something with them?
- Let me see.

1333
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,348
What a nice modeling.
We should get a perfect drape.

1334
01:22:58,522 --> 01:23:01,218
- Would you mind stepping over here?
- I'm gonna let this guy...

1335
01:23:01,759 --> 01:23:02,987
Yes, yes.

1336
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,888
All right, all right.
Just a moment.

1337
01:23:07,131 --> 01:23:08,792
Just a moment, please.

1338
01:23:09,767 --> 01:23:11,564
Tape.

1339
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:12,998
- Forty-four.
- Forty-four.

1340
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:15,400
Am I interrupting?
Or are ladies allowed?

1341
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:18,303
Hello. Hello, Karen.

1342
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:22,673
Come in, come in.
Shorty, this is Karen Vanmeer.

1343
01:23:22,847 --> 01:23:24,280
John Sand, Karen.

1344
01:23:24,448 --> 01:23:27,110
- Pleased to know you, I'm sure.
- So you're Square John.

1345
01:23:27,284 --> 01:23:28,774
I've heard a lot about you.

1346
01:23:28,953 --> 01:23:30,420
Yeah? Running me down again, pal?

1347
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:34,456
I was just passing by and took
a chance my boss might be in.

1348
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:37,116
- Can you talk to me for a moment?
- Sure, sure.

1349
01:23:37,294 --> 01:23:39,854
- Excuse us, will you, Shorty?
- Yeah.

1350
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:42,590
Eighteen. Hold out your arm.
Bend it, please.

1351
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:44,667
- Thirty-one.
- Thirty-one.

1352
01:23:44,835 --> 01:23:46,826
Turn around, please.

1353
01:23:47,338 --> 01:23:49,806
Looks as if I'm going to be
a very lonely girl tonight.

1354
01:23:49,974 --> 01:23:52,966
Sorry. But Shorty and I have got
a lot of old times to talk over.

1355
01:23:53,144 --> 01:23:55,977
But you mustn't forget
there are new times too.

1356
01:23:56,147 --> 01:23:59,776
Look, you've got to learn to take no
for an answer once in a while.

1357
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,646
I wouldn't let you give me that answer.

1358
01:24:03,354 --> 01:24:05,914
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two.

1359
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:10,222
Turn around, please.
Now we take the trouser length.

1360
01:24:10,394 --> 01:24:13,056
I'll be running along.
Nice to have met you, Square John.

1361
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:15,664
I'm happy to hear we're
going to see a lot more of you.

1362
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:17,391
- Sure. Thanks.
- Goodbye.

1363
01:24:17,568 --> 01:24:19,297
- Goodbye.
- You like them snug?

1364
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,768
Yes, come on. Get on with it, buddy.
Get on with it.

1365
01:24:21,972 --> 01:24:23,564
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1366
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:30,713
Get me Mrs. McMasters.

1367
01:24:30,881 --> 01:24:35,181
Hey, who is this Vanmeer dame?
She'd stop a stampede, if you ask me.

1368
01:24:35,352 --> 01:24:36,910
Yeah, smart girl. She works for me.

1369
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:38,645
- Where? Here in the office?
- No, no.

1370
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,415
She knows everybody here
in New York.

1371
01:24:40,591 --> 01:24:42,115
Gets around and hears everything.

1372
01:24:42,293 --> 01:24:44,591
That's the way you work in this town.

1373
01:24:45,896 --> 01:24:47,386
Betsy.

1374
01:24:47,565 --> 01:24:49,863
Hello? Yeah, hello, honey.

1375
01:24:50,034 --> 01:24:51,365
Yeah, I'll be home for dinner.

1376
01:24:51,535 --> 01:24:54,231
Yeah, yeah, and I'm bringing
a guy with me.

1377
01:24:54,405 --> 01:24:56,373
Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, business.

1378
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:58,975
Yes, John. All right.

1379
01:25:00,411 --> 01:25:02,003
Goodbye, dear.

1380
01:25:04,448 --> 01:25:08,817
Now, Jack, play like this is an Apache
Indian and he's sneaking up on you.

1381
01:25:12,156 --> 01:25:14,056
You broke one of your
pappy's thingamabobs.

1382
01:25:14,892 --> 01:25:16,120
Another vase.

1383
01:25:16,293 --> 01:25:17,885
Mr. McMasters will hear about this.

1384
01:25:18,062 --> 01:25:20,496
Mr. McMasters.
Mr. McMasters...

1385
01:25:20,664 --> 01:25:22,598
...this sort of thing goes on
all the time.

1386
01:25:22,766 --> 01:25:24,063
It'll toughen you up, Parker.

1387
01:25:24,235 --> 01:25:26,294
Cans of catfish and dang my tired eyes.

1388
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:28,597
Harmony, Harmony, how are you?
How are?

1389
01:25:28,772 --> 01:25:30,364
Why is your pajama top on?

1390
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:32,099
I don't know. It's his idea.

1391
01:25:32,276 --> 01:25:33,675
- Daddy.
- Jackie.

1392
01:25:33,844 --> 01:25:36,142
- Pal, this is your uncle Square John.
- Hello, sport.

1393
01:25:36,313 --> 01:25:39,771
Hello, Uncle Square John. Do you
wanna play Shooting Indians with me?

1394
01:25:39,984 --> 01:25:42,919
Partner, you and your old uncle
are gonna play plenty from now on.

1395
01:25:43,254 --> 01:25:46,087
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't expect you so...

1396
01:25:47,391 --> 01:25:49,188
Well, well, well. Just as I knew her.

1397
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,294
Still much too pretty to walk and talk.

1398
01:25:52,663 --> 01:25:55,291
- Jonathan.
- Betsy.

1399
01:25:55,466 --> 01:25:57,900
Oh, Jonathan.

1400
01:25:58,502 --> 01:26:01,630
Well, if I cry now, don't blame me.

1401
01:26:01,805 --> 01:26:04,433
You two idiots. All this time.

1402
01:26:04,608 --> 01:26:06,974
Yeah, yeah, we buried it
in a bottle of bourbon.

1403
01:26:07,144 --> 01:26:10,511
Pardon me, Mrs. McMasters.
It's time for Jackie's supper now.

1404
01:26:10,681 --> 01:26:12,342
- Mommy...
- No, no, now, darling.

1405
01:26:12,516 --> 01:26:15,417
- You can come down later.
- Yeah, come on, son.

1406
01:26:15,586 --> 01:26:17,178
You know, he looks exactly like you.

1407
01:26:17,354 --> 01:26:18,719
I'll buy him a football helmet.

1408
01:26:18,889 --> 01:26:20,720
He's much too young
for a football helmet.

1409
01:26:20,891 --> 01:26:23,655
Oh, I don't mean to play in,
I mean to sleep in.

1410
01:26:25,429 --> 01:26:27,897
Okay, okay.

1411
01:26:31,535 --> 01:26:34,333
Jonathan... Come on in.

1412
01:26:34,505 --> 01:26:37,906
Jackie's a great kid.
They're both great kids.

1413
01:26:38,075 --> 01:26:40,839
And this is a swell layout.
It's you all over, Betsy.

1414
01:26:41,011 --> 01:26:42,342
Class.

1415
01:26:42,513 --> 01:26:45,073
You and the big moose
must really be happy here.

1416
01:26:45,249 --> 01:26:48,082
Yes, of course we are, Jonathan.

1417
01:26:54,191 --> 01:26:55,488
Betsy...

1418
01:26:55,659 --> 01:26:58,321
...everything is going great guns,
isn't it?

1419
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:01,798
Oh, Jonathan.

1420
01:27:03,067 --> 01:27:04,830
Betsy...

1421
01:27:05,002 --> 01:27:08,199
...something's the matter. What is it?

1422
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:09,997
Oh, nothing. It's...

1423
01:27:10,174 --> 01:27:13,803
It's just now that I'm so happy
to see you two together again...

1424
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:16,606
I'm so happy that you're here.

1425
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:21,640
Well, I'm sorry,
I warned you I might cry, though.

1426
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:23,844
Please let me a little.

1427
01:27:28,425 --> 01:27:31,792
See, honey, this bank of blowers
first heats the crude oil in those coils...

1428
01:27:31,962 --> 01:27:33,520
...to about 600 degrees Fahrenheit.

1429
01:27:33,697 --> 01:27:35,824
- Dante's <i>Inferno</i> has nothing on this.
- No.

1430
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,959
It's carried up to that fractionating tower,
where it's heated to about 900 degrees.

1431
01:27:40,137 --> 01:27:43,368
That's what we mean by cracking.
That's where the crude is condensed...

1432
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:45,531
...and evaporated into gasoline,
kerosene...

1433
01:27:45,709 --> 01:27:48,337
...naphtha and paving asphalt,
medicinal oils.

1434
01:27:48,512 --> 01:27:51,504
Oh, hundreds of byproducts,
and all points west.

1435
01:27:51,682 --> 01:27:53,445
All that? Hey, Jonathan...

1436
01:27:53,617 --> 01:27:57,109
...l'll bet you're glad that I talked you
out of going with Compton.

1437
01:27:57,287 --> 01:27:59,881
If we buy a couple more of these,
we'll run Compton ragged.

1438
01:28:00,057 --> 01:28:03,390
You haven't signed that contract.
It's been on your desk since yesterday.

1439
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,687
- I'll get around to it.
- Make it snappy.

1440
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:08,627
Over there is our crude-oil
storage-tank farm.

1441
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:14,637
These ball-shaped pressure tanks
are for butane and casing-head gas.

1442
01:28:14,805 --> 01:28:17,774
- Well, if it isn't the man I...
- Hello, Karen.

1443
01:28:19,376 --> 01:28:21,276
Hello there.

1444
01:28:21,445 --> 01:28:22,537
How do you do?

1445
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:26,815
- It's nice to see you again.
- Thanks. Hello, you two.

1446
01:28:26,984 --> 01:28:28,212
- Hi.
- How do you do?

1447
01:28:28,385 --> 01:28:30,182
Where have you been hiding
all this time?

1448
01:28:30,354 --> 01:28:33,255
- Here and there. You're looking well.
- I feel fine, thank you.

1449
01:28:33,424 --> 01:28:35,255
I heard something frightfully important.

1450
01:28:35,426 --> 01:28:37,690
I couldn't get you at the office,
so I dropped by.

1451
01:28:37,861 --> 01:28:39,692
- What's up?
- The independent operators'...

1452
01:28:39,863 --> 01:28:41,797
...convention in Washington
begins tomorrow.

1453
01:28:41,965 --> 01:28:44,934
I just heard there's something
in the air about price-cutting.

1454
01:28:45,102 --> 01:28:47,002
I thought you might want to be there.

1455
01:28:47,171 --> 01:28:49,639
Those independent operators
might come in handy, Shorty.

1456
01:28:49,807 --> 01:28:52,071
Shall we go and see
if we're getting kicked around?

1457
01:28:52,242 --> 01:28:55,075
You better go alone. You know
how to smoosh those get-togethers.

1458
01:28:55,245 --> 01:28:57,713
I'm gonna stay here.
Maybe Luther and I can get Betsy...

1459
01:28:57,881 --> 01:28:59,815
...to show us some of the hot spots.
- Okay.

1460
01:28:59,983 --> 01:29:01,211
- You'd like that?
- You bet.

1461
01:29:01,385 --> 01:29:02,943
- Fine.
- Well, I have to hurry back.

1462
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,020
- So long, everybody.
- Goodbye, Karen.

1463
01:29:05,189 --> 01:29:06,417
Don't be such a stranger.

1464
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:08,387
- Thanks.
- Couple of things to talk about.

1465
01:29:08,559 --> 01:29:10,186
I'll be right back.

1466
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:14,921
You know, it is interesting,
all that superstructure.

1467
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:17,158
Yeah, yeah.
Say, I got an appointment downtown.

1468
01:29:17,334 --> 01:29:19,996
I better grab a cab, I'll see you later.
Tell him, will you?

1469
01:29:20,804 --> 01:29:23,864
Yes. It is, it's interesting.

1470
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:27,135
I know a couple of bootleggers
in Oklahoma who'd like to have this.

1471
01:29:27,311 --> 01:29:29,802
You know, Betsy, bathtub gin?

1472
01:29:30,748 --> 01:29:33,512
Children make a lot of difference,
don't they, Luther?

1473
01:29:34,318 --> 01:29:35,580
Listen, Betsy.

1474
01:29:35,753 --> 01:29:37,084
Don't jump to conclusions.

1475
01:29:37,254 --> 01:29:39,745
I wouldn't have stood for this
back in Burkburnett.

1476
01:29:39,923 --> 01:29:43,689
Darling, I'm a kind of an old fool
now and then...

1477
01:29:43,861 --> 01:29:45,590
...but I love you and John so much...

1478
01:29:45,763 --> 01:29:47,890
...and I've watched fellas like him
in my time.

1479
01:29:48,065 --> 01:29:51,501
- Don't worry. They'll always...
- You're very sweet, Luther.

1480
01:29:51,668 --> 01:29:53,829
Come on, show me around some more.

1481
01:30:00,277 --> 01:30:02,006
- Is your boss in?
- Who will I say is...?

1482
01:30:02,179 --> 01:30:03,976
That's all right. She knows me.

1483
01:30:05,282 --> 01:30:07,750
- Hello, Karen.
- Well, for heaven's sake.

1484
01:30:07,918 --> 01:30:09,283
I just left you on Long Island.

1485
01:30:09,453 --> 01:30:12,513
You know you're the prettiest gal
east of Frisco in that little rig?

1486
01:30:12,689 --> 01:30:14,418
Get me a little drink of whiskey,
honey?

1487
01:30:14,591 --> 01:30:16,388
Why, of course.

1488
01:30:17,361 --> 01:30:20,330
Scram, you. I'll buy you
a diamond day bed for Christmas.

1489
01:30:21,165 --> 01:30:23,190
- Where's John?
- I ducked him.

1490
01:30:23,967 --> 01:30:26,697
Yeah, sure. I didn't want him around
when I talked to you.

1491
01:30:27,204 --> 01:30:29,138
Certainly is a nifty little joint you got.

1492
01:30:29,306 --> 01:30:31,171
Thank you. I'm glad you like it.

1493
01:30:32,276 --> 01:30:34,540
- Bourbon, straight.
- Thank you.

1494
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:38,272
You know, I always wondered why John
never brought you up here before.

1495
01:30:38,448 --> 01:30:40,973
Karen, you're a pretty smart little gal.

1496
01:30:41,718 --> 01:30:44,016
Yes, sir, you're a smart little gal.

1497
01:30:44,721 --> 01:30:47,417
This income-tax thing
is getting to be a heck of a note.

1498
01:30:47,591 --> 01:30:51,027
Would you believe that
I'll pay 220,000 this year?

1499
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:53,527
Well, I'd say you're very lucky.

1500
01:30:54,464 --> 01:30:56,989
You know, Karen, I may not
look much like a lady's man...

1501
01:30:57,167 --> 01:30:59,761
...but many a gal has cried when I left.

1502
01:31:00,137 --> 01:31:02,935
If I were a man, I'd consider that
a great compliment...

1503
01:31:03,106 --> 01:31:05,802
...but why tell me?
- Well, I'll get to the real point.

1504
01:31:05,976 --> 01:31:08,604
I'll skip my better ones,
like my not snoring...

1505
01:31:08,779 --> 01:31:10,838
...and knowing when
a dame needs a walloping...

1506
01:31:11,014 --> 01:31:12,879
...to be sure that I'm in love with her.

1507
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:16,110
And that I've got all the money
in the world, outside of some change.

1508
01:31:16,286 --> 01:31:19,016
I got an idea.
I'm asking you to marry me.

1509
01:31:20,357 --> 01:31:21,881
I don't get it.

1510
01:31:22,059 --> 01:31:23,754
I simply don't get it.

1511
01:31:23,927 --> 01:31:27,226
You don't want to marry me, of course,
but you meant what you said.

1512
01:31:27,397 --> 01:31:28,989
I'll tell you what I'll do with you.

1513
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:31,930
I'll sign a paper stating
I'm in my right mind.

1514
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:35,796
So you're bound to get most of my
dough if the thing don't work out.

1515
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:38,999
I see.

1516
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:43,942
Greater love hath no man
than to lay down his life for his...

1517
01:31:44,615 --> 01:31:46,173
Why, it's even more than that.

1518
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:50,548
It's Betsy. You're in love
with John McMasters' wife.

1519
01:31:50,721 --> 01:31:53,690
What do you say? Let's go to
the Hall of Records and make it legal.

1520
01:31:53,857 --> 01:31:56,553
- You obviously dislike me.
- Ain't it the truth.

1521
01:31:56,727 --> 01:31:59,389
I don't like poachers, male or female.

1522
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:01,525
I rang a buzzer when I came in here...

1523
01:32:01,698 --> 01:32:04,599
...but as far as I'm concerned,
it's an old-fashioned brass bell.

1524
01:32:04,768 --> 01:32:08,568
And all these lovely flowered curtains
around here are red plush, for my money.

1525
01:32:08,739 --> 01:32:10,536
Besides, you can't horn in on a setup...

1526
01:32:10,707 --> 01:32:12,902
...that the world thinks
is pretty good: A family.

1527
01:32:13,076 --> 01:32:15,340
- My, all of that.
- All of that and a little more...

1528
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:17,639
...but I think you get my drift.
What do you say?

1529
01:32:17,814 --> 01:32:20,112
It would be intriguing,
trying to change your mind.

1530
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:21,683
The offer still goes.

1531
01:32:21,852 --> 01:32:24,446
What's she got to deserve two such men?

1532
01:32:24,621 --> 01:32:26,782
What's she got that I...?

1533
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:29,956
Square John, she'll be free
to marry you soon...

1534
01:32:30,127 --> 01:32:32,357
...because I'm going to marry
John McMasters.

1535
01:32:32,529 --> 01:32:34,520
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Has he told you so?

1536
01:32:34,698 --> 01:32:37,531
- Has he said he's in love with you?
- No, not in so many words...

1537
01:32:37,701 --> 01:32:41,398
...but there are certain times, being
a woman, that I might believe he was.

1538
01:32:41,571 --> 01:32:44,096
What's more, I'm going to get him,
because he needs me.

1539
01:32:48,078 --> 01:32:52,105
It must be awfully boring, listening to
a woman who knows what she wants.

1540
01:32:52,282 --> 01:32:54,580
Well, looks like I brought in a duster.

1541
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:56,685
- Thanks for the drink, anyway.
- Not at all.

1542
01:32:56,853 --> 01:32:58,548
I'm going to Washington
this evening...

1543
01:32:58,722 --> 01:33:02,158
...and all this will make a very
amusing topic of conversation...

1544
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:04,760
...in case I meet anybody on the train.

1545
01:33:04,928 --> 01:33:06,327
I wouldn't say anything to him.

1546
01:33:06,496 --> 01:33:10,023
- Well, I certainly...
- I wouldn't do that if I were you, Karen.

1547
01:33:11,101 --> 01:33:13,592
I wouldn't say a word.

1548
01:33:27,718 --> 01:33:31,620
Big John gets back to town
on Tuesday, doesn't he?

1549
01:33:31,788 --> 01:33:35,121
He should have left Washington
before that was taken.

1550
01:33:39,896 --> 01:33:42,831
Hello. It's Harmony, for you.

1551
01:33:45,302 --> 01:33:47,099
Yes, Harmony?

1552
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:48,567
What?

1553
01:33:48,739 --> 01:33:50,536
I'll be right over.

1554
01:33:51,842 --> 01:33:54,242
- She gonna be all right?
- Yes, yes, I arrived in time.

1555
01:33:54,411 --> 01:33:57,471
I can't imagine where she got
the prescription for a sleeping potion.

1556
01:33:57,647 --> 01:33:59,171
- Can I...?
- Certainly, Mr. Sand.

1557
01:33:59,349 --> 01:34:00,873
But not too long, please.

1558
01:34:08,258 --> 01:34:10,249
Trying to get funny, huh?

1559
01:34:11,128 --> 01:34:13,756
I feel just like a Swiss tunnel.

1560
01:34:14,297 --> 01:34:17,425
Did you ever have to swallow
a stomach pump?

1561
01:34:20,103 --> 01:34:21,900
Not like our Betsy.

1562
01:34:22,072 --> 01:34:24,836
You weren't thinking very much
of Little Jack, were you?

1563
01:34:25,008 --> 01:34:26,805
Yes, the minute after I did it.

1564
01:34:26,977 --> 01:34:28,604
That's why I changed my mind.

1565
01:34:28,779 --> 01:34:31,907
It's a heck of a fuss to make
over a Dutch daffodil.

1566
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:35,580
I've lost my pride, I guess.

1567
01:34:35,752 --> 01:34:38,448
Why not? I've lost everything else.

1568
01:34:38,622 --> 01:34:40,852
You don't know how it is
to love someone so much.

1569
01:34:41,892 --> 01:34:44,019
When being in love like that
is stopped...

1570
01:34:44,194 --> 01:34:47,129
...it's worse than your breathing
being stopped.

1571
01:34:47,297 --> 01:34:49,390
- Take it easy, honey.
- But it's true...

1572
01:34:49,566 --> 01:34:51,124
...because if you stop breathing...

1573
01:34:51,301 --> 01:34:54,270
...you're dead and you don't
have to feel anymore...

1574
01:34:54,438 --> 01:34:56,804
...but when they stop your love...

1575
01:34:56,973 --> 01:34:59,806
...you're alive and you keep on feeling.

1576
01:35:00,744 --> 01:35:04,373
Oh, Jonathan, it's horrible
being in love like that.

1577
01:35:05,882 --> 01:35:07,907
Yeah, I guess it is.

1578
01:35:08,585 --> 01:35:10,450
But as you say,
I wouldn't know about that.

1579
01:35:14,558 --> 01:35:16,617
Oh, I'm sorry.

1580
01:35:17,427 --> 01:35:19,292
I've never been so sorry.

1581
01:35:22,132 --> 01:35:24,726
We gotta do something about
you and the moose, huh?

1582
01:35:26,069 --> 01:35:29,004
No, I don't think he needs me
anymore, Jonathan.

1583
01:35:29,172 --> 01:35:31,640
You see, when we left Burkburnett...

1584
01:35:31,808 --> 01:35:35,938
...he needed me then, and all those years
working and planning.

1585
01:35:36,113 --> 01:35:39,082
Here in New York,
he's doing it all by himself.

1586
01:35:39,249 --> 01:35:42,116
It's his world and I'm no part of it.

1587
01:35:43,787 --> 01:35:45,618
But I wanna be.

1588
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:50,587
You and him and Little Jackie,
you're all part of each other.

1589
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,729
I don't care if he owns
all the oil in Hades.

1590
01:35:55,398 --> 01:35:57,127
I got an idea.

1591
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:58,824
May be a little rough...

1592
01:35:59,002 --> 01:36:02,199
...but you just leave everything to me
and things will be all right.

1593
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:04,472
I'll leave everything to you.

1594
01:36:04,641 --> 01:36:06,370
But don't you peep.

1595
01:36:06,543 --> 01:36:09,341
You just go on like
nothing had happened, will you?

1596
01:36:10,914 --> 01:36:12,939
Whatever you say, Jonathan.

1597
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:29,762
- She'll be all right by tomorrow?
- Yes, I think so.

1598
01:36:29,933 --> 01:36:31,662
I don't want anybody
to know about this.

1599
01:36:31,835 --> 01:36:34,099
No, no, Mr. Sand.
Mr. McMasters will pay my bill...

1600
01:36:34,271 --> 01:36:35,761
...and there will be no gossip.

1601
01:36:35,939 --> 01:36:39,397
Mr. McMasters won't pay your bill,
and there won't be no gossip.

1602
01:36:39,576 --> 01:36:42,875
And that 2 grand gives me the right
to break your neck if there is.

1603
01:36:43,046 --> 01:36:45,776
But... I...

1604
01:36:45,949 --> 01:36:48,247
Listen, Square John,
this ain't no good for us here.

1605
01:36:48,418 --> 01:36:50,943
We ought to go back down
to Oklahoma or Texas.

1606
01:36:51,121 --> 01:36:53,885
You're going back.
You and him and her and Little Jackie.

1607
01:36:54,057 --> 01:36:56,651
- How we gonna pry him loose?
- I'll pry him.

1608
01:36:56,826 --> 01:36:59,989
I'll bring him back where she can
love him without any complications.

1609
01:37:00,163 --> 01:37:02,154
He'll suffer like a bull with his legs broke.

1610
01:37:02,332 --> 01:37:05,392
He won't have any dough left,
but he'll be back where he belongs.

1611
01:37:12,075 --> 01:37:14,635
I called the Compton offices.
Mr. Sand's secretary says...

1612
01:37:14,811 --> 01:37:16,335
...he's in conference.
- Try again.

1613
01:37:16,513 --> 01:37:19,346
Have a little pride, friend.
It's obvious you're being snubbed.

1614
01:37:19,516 --> 01:37:22,178
- That double-crossing sump rat.
- I don't quite get it all...

1615
01:37:22,352 --> 01:37:24,946
...but there is one thing certain.
He's out to break you.

1616
01:37:25,121 --> 01:37:28,579
So he and Compton think
they can stretch me over a barrel, huh?

1617
01:37:28,758 --> 01:37:31,283
Get my car hooked onto
the first train leaving for Tulsa.

1618
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:33,258
They're hanging the wrong boy
up to dry.

1619
01:37:33,463 --> 01:37:35,829
You probably know what you're doing,
but be careful.

1620
01:37:35,999 --> 01:37:38,763
- They must have been planning this...
- This is a barroom fight.

1621
01:37:38,935 --> 01:37:41,130
The man that hits first wins,
and that's me.

1622
01:37:41,304 --> 01:37:44,398
I'm gonna beat them to every
independent operator left in the West.

1623
01:37:44,574 --> 01:37:45,973
I got a brand-new idea.

1624
01:37:46,142 --> 01:37:48,201
When I get though
telling it to those babies...

1625
01:37:48,378 --> 01:37:51,506
...they won't be able to buy
enough oil to lubricate a kiddy car.

1626
01:37:51,681 --> 01:37:53,046
Frank, it's the only thing.

1627
01:37:53,216 --> 01:37:56,049
I'll maintain the price, your well
will produce twice as long...

1628
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:58,153
...and in the end,
you'll make more dough.

1629
01:37:58,321 --> 01:38:00,619
- Sounds kind of good, all right.
- It is good.

1630
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:02,018
Here's another reason why.

1631
01:38:02,192 --> 01:38:04,660
The joker in their setup is this:
You sign with them...

1632
01:38:04,828 --> 01:38:07,626
...they'll make you overproduce
and then drop the price on you.

1633
01:38:07,797 --> 01:38:10,960
- Never thought of it that way.
- It's time you got to thinking about it.

1634
01:38:11,134 --> 01:38:13,295
I tell you, if you sell
to Compton and Sand...

1635
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:15,028
...or anyone under the old setup...

1636
01:38:15,205 --> 01:38:17,901
...they'll have you behind the eight ball.
I'll tell you why.

1637
01:38:18,074 --> 01:38:20,599
They'll have you force-pump
your wells for quick money...

1638
01:38:20,777 --> 01:38:23,746
...then you'll lose your gas pressure,
and then suddenly one day...

1639
01:38:23,913 --> 01:38:27,474
...you'll find half your oil still
underground, right down there...

1640
01:38:27,651 --> 01:38:29,949
...and no way on this man's Earth
to get it out.

1641
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,714
Look what happened to Burkburnett.
Whizbang. Desdemona.

1642
01:38:32,889 --> 01:38:34,186
Dead holes before their time.

1643
01:38:34,357 --> 01:38:36,757
Gentlemen, as a geologist,
I agree with Mr. McMasters.

1644
01:38:36,926 --> 01:38:40,020
- The compound ratio of substrat...
- That's high-forehead stuff.

1645
01:38:40,196 --> 01:38:42,323
The main thing is, boys,
if you stick with me...

1646
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:44,933
...l'll contract and guarantee you
the present price...

1647
01:38:45,101 --> 01:38:48,036
...and you'll make more money.
- Boys, Big John is right.

1648
01:38:48,204 --> 01:38:49,694
Oh, you did?

1649
01:38:49,873 --> 01:38:52,068
But I understood you were
all set to sign with us.

1650
01:38:54,911 --> 01:38:57,072
McMasters, huh?

1651
01:39:01,484 --> 01:39:03,281
Evans has signed with him.

1652
01:39:03,453 --> 01:39:06,286
That means the entire
Elk Creek crowd will follow.

1653
01:39:06,456 --> 01:39:08,321
- What's the matter with us?
- Him.

1654
01:39:08,491 --> 01:39:11,289
He's got a great line of smoosh
and he knows the oil business.

1655
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:12,689
I'm heading for a drink.

1656
01:39:12,862 --> 01:39:15,490
I don't know why you got us into this.
I'll be ruined.

1657
01:39:15,665 --> 01:39:17,599
You can always say you were
a big man once.

1658
01:39:17,767 --> 01:39:19,394
Big once? That's a bit...

1659
01:39:19,703 --> 01:39:22,638
McMasters is likely to sink us, at that,
at the rate he's going.

1660
01:39:23,773 --> 01:39:25,900
Say, he doesn't know it...

1661
01:39:26,076 --> 01:39:29,443
...but maybe Uncle Sam will be
interested in what he's doing.

1662
01:39:31,281 --> 01:39:33,215
Get me Senator Grayson in Washington.

1663
01:39:35,318 --> 01:39:38,048
What? That's terrible.

1664
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:42,180
Well, unload all my Compton-United.
I'm closing out.

1665
01:40:02,112 --> 01:40:03,409
- Yes?
- <i>Mr. Aldrich calling.</i>

1666
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:05,343
Tell him I'm out of town.

1667
01:40:05,515 --> 01:40:07,210
Tried to put me against the wall, huh?

1668
01:40:07,384 --> 01:40:09,409
Now who's asking for a blindfold?

1669
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:11,952
It's nice to see you so happy about it.

1670
01:40:12,155 --> 01:40:14,487
Sure I'm happy. On top of the world.

1671
01:40:14,657 --> 01:40:18,354
See what happens when a simple-minded
guy falls in with a man like Compton?

1672
01:40:18,528 --> 01:40:21,793
- Turn him into a crook.
- Everything considered, it's a little odd...

1673
01:40:21,965 --> 01:40:24,934
...making excuses for Mr. Sand.
- What do you mean, excuses?

1674
01:40:25,101 --> 01:40:27,399
He was a burglar,
and I licked him down to his size.

1675
01:40:27,637 --> 01:40:31,129
Pretty expensive victory, J.M.
Selling oil for half what you paid for it.

1676
01:40:31,307 --> 01:40:34,299
- Cost you about $5 million.
- We'll make that in two months.

1677
01:40:34,477 --> 01:40:37,605
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Mr. John Sand to see you.

1678
01:40:37,781 --> 01:40:41,273
Sand, here? You fellas clear out.

1679
01:40:42,018 --> 01:40:45,010
- Send him in.
- Yes, sir.

1680
01:40:45,188 --> 01:40:47,679
You think this is wise?

1681
01:40:47,857 --> 01:40:49,518
I'd like to see him alone, Karen.

1682
01:40:49,692 --> 01:40:51,023
Of course.

1683
01:41:05,575 --> 01:41:07,873
- Hi.
- Hi.

1684
01:41:08,678 --> 01:41:11,806
Well, I see you took a bath.
Anything more I can do for you?

1685
01:41:14,417 --> 01:41:15,714
Yeah.

1686
01:41:15,885 --> 01:41:17,648
You can give your wife a divorce.

1687
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:21,581
- What?
- You can give Betsy a divorce.

1688
01:41:21,758 --> 01:41:25,694
You almost cleaned me out, but I saved
enough so we can start over again.

1689
01:41:26,296 --> 01:41:28,093
Oh, yeah, and she wants the boy too.

1690
01:41:29,566 --> 01:41:30,828
Have you gone daffy?

1691
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,197
That's the best way all around.
That'll leave you free to marry Karen.

1692
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:36,895
Still poking your nose into
other people's business?

1693
01:41:37,073 --> 01:41:40,008
- Why not? She's a smart, good-looking...
- Wait a minute.

1694
01:41:40,176 --> 01:41:42,303
Do you mean to say that...

1695
01:41:42,612 --> 01:41:44,102
That Betsy's in love with you?

1696
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:46,942
Well, what do you think?
What do you think I'm doing here?

1697
01:41:47,116 --> 01:41:49,880
What do you think happens
to a woman, anyway?

1698
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:52,918
She's a little human too, you know.

1699
01:41:59,796 --> 01:42:04,426
And prettier than the day you married her.
I've noticed that even if you haven't.

1700
01:42:07,203 --> 01:42:09,671
And you don't have to worry about
Little Jack, you know.

1701
01:42:09,839 --> 01:42:13,570
You can drop around and see him
once in a while, if you get time.

1702
01:42:17,747 --> 01:42:20,215
- You got it all fixed, haven't you?
- Sure I have.

1703
01:42:20,383 --> 01:42:23,648
Back-dooring me, that's what you're doing.
Sneaking in my back door.

1704
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:27,256
- So what?
- You're not gonna get away with it.

1705
01:42:28,324 --> 01:42:30,519
You and I started a fight once
and never finished.

1706
01:42:30,693 --> 01:42:32,524
Now I'm gonna beat your brains out.

1707
01:42:32,695 --> 01:42:34,595
Boy, am I gonna enjoy this.

1708
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:51,304
What are you backing away for?

1709
01:42:56,786 --> 01:42:59,050
Oh, my goodness.
There must be something we can do.

1710
01:42:59,222 --> 01:43:01,656
- Can't we do anything?
- Call the police.

1711
01:43:01,824 --> 01:43:03,314
Don't do that.
They might get mad.

1712
01:43:11,868 --> 01:43:14,268
Get your hand out of that birdcage.

1713
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:20,342
What is all this? What's going on here?
Are they in conference?

1714
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:22,671
Well, we'd better... They'll...

1715
01:43:29,118 --> 01:43:31,484
Kind of soft, ain't you, big boy?

1716
01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:37,957
I'll talk to them.
I started them in business.

1717
01:43:38,127 --> 01:43:41,324
- I thought you looked like a fight promoter.
- That door's locked too.

1718
01:43:42,098 --> 01:43:44,191
Come on, come on.

1719
01:44:08,491 --> 01:44:10,220
- Take it easy.
- What are you doing?

1720
01:44:11,628 --> 01:44:13,323
Come on, get out.

1721
01:44:15,398 --> 01:44:18,458
Boys, this is disgraceful.

1722
01:44:21,304 --> 01:44:23,602
Come on, get out. The bunch of you.

1723
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:39,652
Honey, buy me a ticket for Europe
on the first boat and keep the change.

1724
01:44:39,822 --> 01:44:41,084
Yes, Mr. Sand.

1725
01:44:41,257 --> 01:44:43,589
What are you laughing at?
We've lost a fortune.

1726
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,524
Luther, I've just done the best
afternoon's work of my life.

1727
01:44:46,696 --> 01:44:49,859
If you hadn't pulled this, we might've
talked ourselves back with him.

1728
01:44:50,033 --> 01:44:53,469
I wouldn't go back with him if he was
the last thing in the world to eat.

1729
01:44:53,636 --> 01:44:55,797
Send the tickets over to the hotel,
will you?

1730
01:44:56,105 --> 01:44:58,665
- I want to see Mr. McMasters.
- He's busy right now.

1731
01:44:58,841 --> 01:45:02,800
So are we. I'm Stebbins, U.S. Marshal,
Federal District Attorney's office.

1732
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:09,551
Feeling clean again?

1733
01:45:10,953 --> 01:45:14,354
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I'll live.

1734
01:45:26,569 --> 01:45:31,438
A man always worries about his tie
when he's in love, doesn't he?

1735
01:45:32,709 --> 01:45:34,734
Karen, there's something
I want to tell you.

1736
01:45:34,911 --> 01:45:38,369
You don't have to. I'm a high-class
eavesdropper, partner.

1737
01:45:38,548 --> 01:45:40,948
Don't you know that's my business?

1738
01:45:42,585 --> 01:45:44,485
You never got much out of this, did you?

1739
01:45:44,654 --> 01:45:47,350
I got plenty. All I asked for...

1740
01:45:47,523 --> 01:45:48,956
...except the frosting.

1741
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:51,423
And I knew in my heart
I'll never get that.

1742
01:45:51,594 --> 01:45:53,926
A man told me so once.

1743
01:45:54,697 --> 01:45:58,565
Yeah, you said it. You're high-class.

1744
01:45:58,968 --> 01:46:03,962
This may not be, but I'm going to do it
because I want to.

1745
01:46:08,878 --> 01:46:12,507
High-class or not,
I'm going out the back way.

1746
01:46:12,682 --> 01:46:15,276
Just to begin to see how it feels.

1747
01:46:22,358 --> 01:46:24,121
Goodbye, stranger.

1748
01:46:24,927 --> 01:46:26,292
Okay, stranger.

1749
01:46:33,002 --> 01:46:34,264
Are you John McMasters?

1750
01:46:34,437 --> 01:46:37,429
- Yes, but I'm sorry, I got...
- I've got a warrant for your arrest.

1751
01:46:37,607 --> 01:46:39,837
- Arrest? I don't get you.
- Federal indictment.

1752
01:46:40,009 --> 01:46:42,705
Heard of the Sherman Antitrust Law,
haven't you?

1753
01:46:45,515 --> 01:46:48,450
I don't know what this is about,
but first I have to see my wife.

1754
01:46:48,618 --> 01:46:51,314
I don't know why not.
A wife's swell when you're in a jam.

1755
01:46:51,487 --> 01:46:53,250
That's not the idea.

1756
01:46:55,558 --> 01:46:57,492
- Daddy.
- Hiya, son.

1757
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,150
How's my boy?

1758
01:46:59,328 --> 01:47:01,319
Hey, you got hurt.

1759
01:47:02,665 --> 01:47:04,633
Hello, dear...

1760
01:47:05,902 --> 01:47:08,700
Look, son, you go upstairs and play,
will you?

1761
01:47:08,871 --> 01:47:11,897
- I want to talk to Mother.
- Okay.

1762
01:47:12,074 --> 01:47:14,542
- He's a great kid.
- Yeah.

1763
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:16,439
Come in here.

1764
01:47:18,147 --> 01:47:20,877
- You're hurt. Who's that man?
- Never mind that.

1765
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:23,109
You're not getting away from me.
You know that?

1766
01:47:23,286 --> 01:47:25,186
- What?
- I'm not blaming you, maybe...

1767
01:47:25,354 --> 01:47:28,187
...but you aren't walking
with him or anybody else. Understand?

1768
01:47:28,357 --> 01:47:30,484
- Him? What do you...?
- Sand.

1769
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:32,252
He told me all about it.

1770
01:47:32,428 --> 01:47:35,261
I had to give him a licking
to show him that's out.

1771
01:47:35,431 --> 01:47:37,490
You're my girl, see?
And you always will be.

1772
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:40,294
Even if I have to lick you to prove it.

1773
01:47:42,338 --> 01:47:44,499
I'm your girl.

1774
01:47:44,674 --> 01:47:47,234
You can lick me if it'll help.

1775
01:47:47,977 --> 01:47:50,468
I'll save it for when you need it.

1776
01:48:08,197 --> 01:48:10,995
You did say that you got the money
to drill your second well...

1777
01:48:11,167 --> 01:48:12,828
...by shooting craps in a honky-tonk.

1778
01:48:13,002 --> 01:48:14,469
- Right?
- I said part of the money.

1779
01:48:14,637 --> 01:48:16,502
- How did you get the rest?
- It was a deal...

1780
01:48:16,672 --> 01:48:19,732
How did you get the money
to drill your first well? Wasn't it by...?

1781
01:48:19,909 --> 01:48:21,376
- I object...
- Naturally he objects.

1782
01:48:21,544 --> 01:48:24,240
What is the government's object
in this questioning?

1783
01:48:24,413 --> 01:48:27,007
Your Honor, we are trying to prove,
and I believe we have...

1784
01:48:27,183 --> 01:48:29,549
...that this man was a lawbreaker
from the start.

1785
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:31,653
That Big John McMasters,
in full knowledge...

1786
01:48:31,821 --> 01:48:34,619
...willfully conspired to break the laws
of the United States.

1787
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:36,849
That he is typical
of the economic royalists...

1788
01:48:37,026 --> 01:48:39,586
...and bourbon industrialists who,
for self-indulgence...

1789
01:48:39,762 --> 01:48:42,663
...seek to ride over the laws
and commonplace securities...

1790
01:48:42,832 --> 01:48:45,096
...of the citizens of this country.
And for that...

1791
01:48:45,268 --> 01:48:47,862
...the people of the U.S.
Will demand for John McMasters...

1792
01:48:48,037 --> 01:48:52,474
...the maximum penalty
of 10 years in a federal penitentiary.

1793
01:48:53,576 --> 01:48:56,807
For the last time,
the spectators will preserve order.

1794
01:48:56,979 --> 01:49:00,142
The statement of the government's attorney
is stricken from the record.

1795
01:49:00,316 --> 01:49:01,578
Now, Mr. McMasters...

1796
01:49:01,751 --> 01:49:06,688
...is it true that for the first well, you stole
$ 7000 of tools from a Mr. Luther Aldrich?

1797
01:49:06,889 --> 01:49:10,518
- I took the tools, but he was paid for them.
- Then you did steal the tools.

1798
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:12,992
You can call it that in your language...

1799
01:49:13,162 --> 01:49:16,393
...but I borrowed them in mine.
Borrowed like people did in those days.

1800
01:49:16,565 --> 01:49:19,159
- We wanted to find oil.
- Now, Mr. McMasters...

1801
01:49:19,335 --> 01:49:23,499
...you have admitted that you deliberately
set out to break Compton and Sand.

1802
01:49:23,673 --> 01:49:24,970
- I did.
- What was your reason?

1803
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:27,302
They were trying to break me.

1804
01:49:27,476 --> 01:49:29,569
I see. Self-protection.

1805
01:49:29,745 --> 01:49:32,475
- But wasn't Mr. Compton a friend of yours?
- Not exactly.

1806
01:49:32,648 --> 01:49:36,448
- But John Sand was your very best friend.
- He was.

1807
01:49:36,652 --> 01:49:39,416
Isn't it true that Mr. Sand
started you in the oil business?

1808
01:49:39,588 --> 01:49:42,523
That it was his lease that started you
on the way to your fortune?

1809
01:49:42,692 --> 01:49:43,954
That's right.

1810
01:49:44,126 --> 01:49:47,823
Yet you expect the jury to believe that
a friend and benefactor tried to break you.

1811
01:49:47,997 --> 01:49:50,397
- He did.
- Why?

1812
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:53,725
Why did he try to break you?

1813
01:49:54,737 --> 01:49:56,967
- I can't answer that.
- You mean can't or won't?

1814
01:49:57,139 --> 01:49:58,401
Take your pick.

1815
01:49:58,574 --> 01:50:00,508
You don't understand my language?

1816
01:50:00,743 --> 01:50:04,235
That's right. Your Honor, I don't
understand this man's language at all.

1817
01:50:04,413 --> 01:50:06,278
He calls me a bourbon. What's that?

1818
01:50:06,449 --> 01:50:08,041
I always thought it was whiskey.

1819
01:50:08,217 --> 01:50:11,243
- Then you refuse to answer?
- That's right.

1820
01:50:11,854 --> 01:50:14,448
- And I'm getting tired of your face, sonny.
- Sit down.

1821
01:50:14,623 --> 01:50:17,615
And if you refuse to answer,
I'll hold you in contempt of court.

1822
01:50:17,793 --> 01:50:20,125
I wouldn't want that to happen,
Your Honor.

1823
01:50:20,296 --> 01:50:23,595
I withdraw my question. That is all.

1824
01:50:24,367 --> 01:50:27,700
- I have witnesses in rebuttal, Your Honor.
- Very well.

1825
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:31,101
- Mrs. McMasters, take the stand, please.
- Any objections?

1826
01:50:31,273 --> 01:50:33,537
We waive any objections, Your Honor.

1827
01:50:33,709 --> 01:50:36,644
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but...

1828
01:50:36,812 --> 01:50:38,143
...so help you God?
- I do.

1829
01:50:38,314 --> 01:50:40,782
Now, Mrs. McMasters,
I won't keep you long.

1830
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:42,679
I only want to ask you a few questions.

1831
01:50:42,852 --> 01:50:44,979
How long have you been married
to Mr. McMasters?

1832
01:50:45,154 --> 01:50:46,280
Seven and a half years.

1833
01:50:46,455 --> 01:50:49,322
Are you acquainted with a woman
named Karen Vanmeer?

1834
01:50:49,492 --> 01:50:51,687
- Yes, I am.
- Does she work for your husband?

1835
01:50:51,861 --> 01:50:53,829
- She did.
- In what capacity?

1836
01:50:53,996 --> 01:50:57,432
- Just a minute. I'm on trial, not her.
- I object to this line of questioning.

1837
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,931
- What connection...?
- I'm only...

1838
01:50:59,101 --> 01:51:00,398
Objection sustained.

1839
01:51:00,569 --> 01:51:04,903
Mr. McMasters and Miss Vanmeer went
to Washington, D.C., on May 14th last.

1840
01:51:05,074 --> 01:51:07,736
Do you know whom they visited,
and what the purpose was?

1841
01:51:07,910 --> 01:51:10,378
Whether I do or I don't,
that doesn't matter.

1842
01:51:10,546 --> 01:51:13,879
I do know that you're trying to blacken
his character by trying to prove...

1843
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,881
...something between
him and Miss Vanmeer.

1844
01:51:16,052 --> 01:51:18,612
What I know about that
doesn't matter either.

1845
01:51:18,788 --> 01:51:22,155
I know I am, and I always will be,
in love with my husband.

1846
01:51:22,358 --> 01:51:24,155
That is all, Mrs. McMasters. Thank you.

1847
01:51:24,326 --> 01:51:27,420
Court will adjourn until 10:00
tomorrow morning.

1848
01:51:29,065 --> 01:51:31,033
- Yeah, Mac?
- Stock's down to seven.

1849
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,896
We don't have to worry about that now.
What about the notes?

1850
01:51:34,070 --> 01:51:36,368
I just left the bank.
The board took the collateral.

1851
01:51:36,539 --> 01:51:38,803
- I'm terribly sorry, J.M.
- That's okay, Mac.

1852
01:51:38,974 --> 01:51:42,068
Put a want ad in the paper.
A guy with your brains will be all right.

1853
01:51:42,244 --> 01:51:44,678
- Thanks for everything.
- Thanks, J.M.

1854
01:51:45,781 --> 01:51:47,840
Well, honey, we're broke again.

1855
01:51:48,017 --> 01:51:51,851
What do we care?
We can always go back to...

1856
01:51:52,588 --> 01:51:55,022
Forget it, honey. We're not down yet.

1857
01:51:55,191 --> 01:51:57,557
- That's a lie.
- Order, order. Proceed.

1858
01:51:57,726 --> 01:51:59,387
No cross-examination, Your Honor.

1859
01:51:59,562 --> 01:52:03,362
- I have one more witness, Your Honor.
- Very well. Call your witness.

1860
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:06,268
John Sand.

1861
01:52:12,675 --> 01:52:14,472
Raise your right hand.

1862
01:52:14,643 --> 01:52:18,306
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but, so help you God?

1863
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:24,786
Mr. Sand, you used to be bosom friends
with Mr. McMasters, didn't you?

1864
01:52:24,954 --> 01:52:28,048
- We were pals, if that's what you mean.
- Are you pals now?

1865
01:52:28,224 --> 01:52:31,091
- No, we don't get on at all.
- Why?

1866
01:52:31,293 --> 01:52:33,318
I don't know.
I just don't like him, I guess.

1867
01:52:33,496 --> 01:52:36,932
Mr. Sand, you and Mr. Compton were
competitors of Mr. McMasters, right?

1868
01:52:37,099 --> 01:52:38,361
Not for very long.

1869
01:52:38,534 --> 01:52:42,937
You were wiped out because this man,
who suddenly turned into an octopus...

1870
01:52:43,105 --> 01:52:44,902
- I object.
- Sustained.

1871
01:52:45,074 --> 01:52:47,304
Prosecution will confine itself
to the issues.

1872
01:52:47,476 --> 01:52:51,105
You failed in your business because
Mr. McMasters formed a monopoly...

1873
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:53,908
...in defiance of the antitrust laws.
- Your Honor, please.

1874
01:52:54,083 --> 01:52:55,948
Now, you haven't got that
straight either...

1875
01:52:56,118 --> 01:52:58,552
- Answer yes or no.
- Wait a minute, buddy. Take it easy.

1876
01:52:58,721 --> 01:53:01,952
You subpoenaed me, but after all,
I'm just here to try to straighten out...

1877
01:53:02,124 --> 01:53:04,092
Mr. Witness, you're here
to answer questions.

1878
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:07,229
Judge, I'm getting as mixed up
as anybody in this hot seat.

1879
01:53:07,396 --> 01:53:09,796
And he's all balled up,
asking a lot of questions.

1880
01:53:09,965 --> 01:53:13,025
Would it be all right if I stood up
and relaxed to spiel my piece?

1881
01:53:13,202 --> 01:53:15,363
Maybe I can straighten things out
around here.

1882
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:19,907
- I object to allowing this witness...
- The court is always interested in truth.

1883
01:53:20,075 --> 01:53:22,236
I'll admit it, subject to a motion to strike.

1884
01:53:22,411 --> 01:53:24,538
Proceed, Mr. Sand.

1885
01:53:25,514 --> 01:53:28,312
Well, as I get it...

1886
01:53:28,484 --> 01:53:32,045
...McMasters is on the hook
because he broke the antitrust laws.

1887
01:53:32,221 --> 01:53:37,454
He signed up a bunch of oil operators and
formed a monopoly in restraint of trade.

1888
01:53:37,626 --> 01:53:39,856
I know that he signed them
to make more money...

1889
01:53:40,029 --> 01:53:43,931
...but he's not exactly original with that.
A lot of us have got those ideas.

1890
01:53:44,099 --> 01:53:48,001
But what he was doing,
although he didn't know it...

1891
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:51,606
...in a way, he was working
for these here United States too.

1892
01:53:51,774 --> 01:53:53,435
Am I out of line yet, judge?

1893
01:53:53,609 --> 01:53:54,906
Proceed, Mr. Sand.

1894
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:57,271
He wanted these guys
to produce less oil...

1895
01:53:57,446 --> 01:54:00,882
...so that their wells would flow
years longer and not ruin the fields.

1896
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:03,348
That way they'd get all the oil
there was to get.

1897
01:54:03,519 --> 01:54:06,750
Don't you get the idea?
He was for conservation.

1898
01:54:06,922 --> 01:54:11,416
How can he be breaking laws when he's
trying to save the resources of the country?

1899
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:14,927
He didn't know that he was doing
anything that you might call noble...

1900
01:54:15,097 --> 01:54:19,124
...but being one of the best oil men there is,
he's got the right hunch about oil.

1901
01:54:19,301 --> 01:54:21,861
He knows that it took billions of years
to put it here...

1902
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:24,005
...and if we keep taking it at this rate...

1903
01:54:24,173 --> 01:54:27,665
...before long, there won't be any oil left
in the good old U.S.A.

1904
01:54:27,843 --> 01:54:29,834
Won't be any left for him
or men like him...

1905
01:54:30,012 --> 01:54:32,572
...to break up into lube
and fuel and gasoline...

1906
01:54:32,748 --> 01:54:35,808
...so that people can get their stuff
moved around in trucks...

1907
01:54:35,985 --> 01:54:39,682
...and so that you can light furnaces
and homes and schoolhouses.

1908
01:54:39,855 --> 01:54:43,188
If that time comes, what'll be the good
of American schoolhouses, anyway?

1909
01:54:43,359 --> 01:54:45,190
What'll be the good
of your two oceans?

1910
01:54:45,361 --> 01:54:48,694
What are you gonna run airplanes
and battleships on? Tomato soup?

1911
01:54:48,864 --> 01:54:51,890
- I only got a couple more words, okay?
- Proceed, Mr. Sand.

1912
01:54:52,067 --> 01:54:54,001
He's got a lot of ham in him,
hasn't he?

1913
01:54:54,169 --> 01:54:55,636
Well, just this:

1914
01:54:55,804 --> 01:54:57,965
McMasters is a wildcatter.

1915
01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:01,541
If it wasn't for automobiles,
he'd be driving a covered wagon.

1916
01:55:01,844 --> 01:55:05,439
It's always been his breed
that has opened up the country...

1917
01:55:05,614 --> 01:55:07,081
...and made it what it is.

1918
01:55:07,249 --> 01:55:09,274
So now I'm wondering...

1919
01:55:09,451 --> 01:55:13,251
...is it out of line, in these United States,
for a man like him to make a million...

1920
01:55:13,422 --> 01:55:14,821
...with his brains and hands?

1921
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:18,153
If that's true, we'd better rewrite this
land-of-opportunity stuff.

1922
01:55:18,327 --> 01:55:20,921
I admit that he's ornery
and he's mean...

1923
01:55:21,096 --> 01:55:24,588
...but he's an oil man with the right idea
of what to do with our oil.

1924
01:55:24,767 --> 01:55:28,464
And he's always met the payroll,
and you can put his word in the bank.

1925
01:55:28,971 --> 01:55:31,565
Now, that's all I got to say.
Now you talk.

1926
01:55:31,774 --> 01:55:34,572
- I move to strike this entire answer.
- Motion denied.

1927
01:55:34,743 --> 01:55:36,870
Court adjourned until tomorrow.

1928
01:55:38,047 --> 01:55:40,015
We may beat this yet.

1929
01:55:43,185 --> 01:55:44,709
Hey.

1930
01:55:45,788 --> 01:55:48,450
- Hi.
- Hi.

1931
01:55:48,957 --> 01:55:50,254
That was quite a speech.

1932
01:55:50,426 --> 01:55:53,395
Well, I got kind of wound up, I guess.

1933
01:55:53,562 --> 01:55:56,156
Say, I was thinking, if I beat this...

1934
01:55:56,332 --> 01:55:58,994
...I got a section of wildcat stuff
left out in California.

1935
01:55:59,168 --> 01:56:00,931
I don't know much about it...

1936
01:56:01,103 --> 01:56:03,571
...but how'd you like
to take a whirl at it with me?

1937
01:56:03,939 --> 01:56:07,238
No, no, I guess not.
I'm through with the oil game for good.

1938
01:56:07,409 --> 01:56:09,502
It's too tough.
Well, I'll be seeing you.

1939
01:56:09,678 --> 01:56:11,168
Yeah.

1940
01:56:29,098 --> 01:56:31,566
Welcome to McMasters' camp.
Come in here.

1941
01:56:31,734 --> 01:56:34,601
I'm sure glad to see you, Miss Betsy.
Yes, sir.

1942
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:37,330
- Hi, old boy.
- Hi, big feller.

1943
01:56:37,506 --> 01:56:40,669
Well, here it is, honey.
This'll be where we're gonna live for...

1944
01:56:40,843 --> 01:56:44,609
- Well, for a while, anyway.
- It's beautiful here, darling. I love it.

1945
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:47,510
Luther, you're crazy to sell this.
This is great stuff.

1946
01:56:47,683 --> 01:56:49,548
There's Jonathan.

1947
01:56:50,452 --> 01:56:52,317
I'm gonna spud in right...

1948
01:56:52,488 --> 01:56:54,080
Jonathan.

1949
01:56:54,256 --> 01:56:56,224
- Well, my goodness.
- Hello.

1950
01:56:56,425 --> 01:56:57,449
Fancy meeting you here.

1951
01:56:57,626 --> 01:57:00,595
- Hello, Uncle Square John.
- Hello, sport. How are you?

1952
01:57:00,763 --> 01:57:02,321
- Shorty.
- What are you doing here?

1953
01:57:02,498 --> 01:57:04,796
This is the half-section
I talked about in New York.

1954
01:57:04,967 --> 01:57:06,594
You told me you had a whole sec...

1955
01:57:08,704 --> 01:57:12,140
Now I see why you sold me
this half for $ 100. It's a handout, huh?

1956
01:57:12,307 --> 01:57:16,641
Listen, Shorty, I though we could put down
one test well and prove both properties.

1957
01:57:16,812 --> 01:57:18,541
What do you say?

1958
01:57:20,282 --> 01:57:22,341
Where do you figure on drilling?

1959
01:57:22,818 --> 01:57:25,378
Well, I figure the main structure
is up here.

1960
01:57:25,554 --> 01:57:27,818
Oh, no, down by the hollow
is the main structure.

1961
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:30,515
- I've been all over this...
- So what? If you don't know...

1962
01:57:30,726 --> 01:57:33,354
Come and get it. Rabbit ŕ la modee.

1963
01:57:33,962 --> 01:57:36,362
Rabbit ŕ la modee, Shorty.

1964
01:57:37,332 --> 01:57:40,631
We might as well get this straight.
I'll give the pipe and equipment...

1965
01:57:40,803 --> 01:57:42,236
...but I want cash in 90 days.

1966
01:57:42,404 --> 01:57:45,237
Shorty, how about giving Luther
an eighth interest instead?

1967
01:57:45,407 --> 01:57:49,070
Oh, no, you fellas go broke
on your own this time.

1968
01:57:49,244 --> 01:57:51,474
There's a dry hole
in every foot of this stuff.

1969
01:57:51,647 --> 01:57:53,615
What's the name
of this sucker's paradise?

1970
01:57:53,782 --> 01:57:56,876
- Came from some guy named Kettleman.
- They call it Kettleman Hills.

1971
01:57:57,052 --> 01:58:00,249
Kettleman Hills?
Doesn't even sound like oil.

1972
01:58:40,028 --> 01:58:42,019
