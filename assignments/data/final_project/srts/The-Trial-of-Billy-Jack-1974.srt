1
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,668
Ms. Roberts,

2
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,342
is it true that while we are
here at this news conference,

3
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,260
the Indians are honoring
the students who were killed,

4
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,226
in a special burial ceremony
out on the reservation?

5
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,435
Ms. Roberts,

6
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,725
has it ever happened before

7
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,939
that so many thousands
of rounds of ammunition

8
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,228
were fired
into the dormitories

9
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,522
in such a short period
of time?

10
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,521
It happened many times
before here.

11
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:04,116
Kent State,
the Orangeburg Massacre--

12
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,453
27 kids were shot
at that one.

13
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,948
Or Jackson State
or Houston,

14
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,167
any one
of a dozen others.

15
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,457
Students are slaughtered
by trigger happy police,

16
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,546
and nothing
is ever done about it.

17
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,587
Besides Billy Jack,
who else was shot?

18
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,301
How many
were actually killed?

19
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,551
There were three deaths,

20
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,928
and two still
on the critical list.

21
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,802
<i>Dr. Bernard Russert,</i>

22
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,011
<i>Dr. Russert.</i>

23
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,470
Has Washington replied

24
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,762
to your request
for an investigation?

25
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,976
Are you kidding?

26
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,937
Remember after Kent State

27
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,806
how Attorney General
John Mitchell said

28
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,481
there was no need to explore
the causes of the killings

29
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,977
because he knew in advance

30
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,400
the causes
couldn't possibly be

31
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,739
the National Guard
or the police.

32
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,074
But didn't an FBI
report subsequently prove

33
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,490
that there were no shots fired
by the students

34
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,035
but there was grave culpability
on the part of the Guard?

35
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,999
They sure did.

36
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,665
But, as usual, Washington
did nothing about it.

37
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,414
Does this mean that it's
the end of the school?

38
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:28,340
Will you have to close
it down now?

39
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,259
Maybe.

40
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,552
Maybe not.

41
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,263
I honestly don't know
at this point.

42
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,681
I'm sorry, folks,
Ms. Roberts is very tired.

43
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,603
You're going to have to leave.

44
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,811
Thank you, Ms. Roberts.

45
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,194
My publisher still
thinks that it's vital

46
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,537
that a book be done
about your school

47
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,373
and how the massacre
happened there.

48
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,494
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

49
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,746
Maybe you could start with
the arrest of Billy Jack.

50
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,467
Wasn't it what happened
at the trial

51
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,008
that made you so determined
to make the school succeed?

52
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,058
Yes.

53
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,726
That was-- what--

54
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,099
four, four and half years ago.

55
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,065
Wasn't Billy Jack's
main belief

56
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,906
that a man who doesn't go
his own way is nothing?

57
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,072
That's right.

58
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,868
That's why they tried Billy.

59
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,956
But we all knew that
what they were really trying

60
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,079
was each man's right
to find his own center,

61
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,579
to follow his own conscience

62
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,048
and to do his own thing

63
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,965
without hurting or interfering
with anybody else's.

64
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,558
<i>That ideal, to all of us,
was Billy Jack.</i>

65
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,268
What your saying, then,

66
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,387
is that it doesn't make
any difference to you

67
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,314
whether this jury finds you
innocent or guilty,

68
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,778
and it doesn't make
any difference to you

69
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,647
whether you live or die.

70
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,321
You expect us to believe

71
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,446
that you have absolutely
no fear of the death penalty?

72
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,459
I have a lot of fear,

73
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,920
but I have a lot more respect.

74
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,632
Long ago I learned that he
is my constant companion.

75
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,501
He eats with me,
he walks with me,

76
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,469
he even sleeps with me.

77
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,511
I'm sorry, I must have
missed something back there.

78
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,135
Who is this faithful
companion of yours?

79
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,436
- Death.
- Oh, I see.

80
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,152
Tell me, is this death
companion business

81
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,238
some special part
of your Indian beliefs?

82
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,652
No.

83
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,742
Every one of us has death
as his constant companion.

84
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,534
He sits with every one of us
every second of our lives,

85
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,498
only we're too terrified
to really think about that,

86
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,162
but once you do,

87
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,832
it will completely change
your entire outlook on life.

88
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,501
How so?

89
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,998
You ask yourself,

90
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,377
even in
the most serious crisis,

91
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,094
how important
would this really be

92
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,337
if I were suddenly told

93
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,010
that I just had
one more week to live?

94
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,101
So, you learn to take
nothing too seriously.

95
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,765
On the other hand,

96
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,184
you ask yourself,

97
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,228
if this were
my last act on earth,

98
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,147
is this what
I really want to do?

99
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,736
So you learn on the one hand

100
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,857
to be detached from the
temporary things of this world,

101
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,154
and on the other hand
you learn to appreciate

102
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,493
every little thing in it
all the more.

103
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,533
<i>During the trial,
Sheriff Cole resigned,</i>

104
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,250
<i>and Posner,</i>

105
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,462
<i>who never really quite recovered
from the death of his son,</i>

106
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,001
<i>sold out all of his companies</i>

107
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,544
<i>to his brother the banker,</i>

108
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,588
<i>and he quietly left town.</i>

109
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,836
<i>And though we were happy
about it then,</i>

110
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,838
<i>it turned out to be
one of the worst things</i>

111
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,840
<i>that ever happened to us.</i>

112
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,842
<i>The prosecution,
for it's part,</i>

113
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,641
<i>savagely attacked
our character</i>

114
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,731
<i>and tried to make it look
like I wasn't even raped.</i>

115
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,601
So Miss Garrison lies,
and you swear to it.

116
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,695
- Objection.
- Sustained.

117
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,234
Now, Ms. Roberts,

118
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,405
isn't it true
that you were never raped?

119
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,572
Isn't it true

120
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,115
that you made up this story

121
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,659
in a desperate attempt

122
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,327
to try and justify

123
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,120
the violent
and insane killing

124
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,414
by the man you love?

125
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,706
Objection.

126
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,080
Order.

127
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,210
I feel terribly sorry for
your children, Mr. Williams.

128
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,554
You feel sorry
for my children?

129
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,298
Yes, and you, too.

130
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,097
You know me,
and you know I don't lie.

131
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,846
It must be terribly
degrading for you to pretend

132
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,689
in front of all
of these people, that I do,

133
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,103
just to earn your money.

134
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,773
Yes, I was proud
to go through West Point.

135
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,696
I was taught there
a code of honor and manliness

136
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,614
that, while it went
overboard at times,

137
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,203
I basically liked.

138
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,789
Yet you brought charges
against your own officers,

139
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,874
including two staff commanders
and a general.

140
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,460
That's right.

141
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,796
I charged them with the
deliberate and senseless

142
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,086
slaughtering of innocent women
and children in the field

143
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,336
either directly
or by men under their command,

144
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,804
and by failing to report
these atrocities

145
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,344
or covering them up
with full knowledge of same.

146
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,342
And after you proffered
these charges,

147
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,311
the Army suddenly made up
charges against you,

148
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,556
of cowardice in the field,

149
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,979
and they offered to drop
these charges against you

150
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,318
if you would drop them
against the officers.

151
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,653
That's correct.

152
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,897
And did you refuse
to drop the charges?

153
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,616
I did refuse

154
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,405
Could you please tell us
in your own words

155
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,245
exactly what led up to your
refusing to obey

156
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,579
this order in the field?

157
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,827
Was it before
or after My Lai?

158
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,046
It was about seven months
before My Lai.

159
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,837
We were out
on a search-and-destroy mission

160
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,552
on a small
South Vietnamese hamlet.

161
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,011
Just like at My Lai,

162
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,722
there had been plenty
of advance warnings,

163
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,183
so when we got there,
there was no resistance,

164
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,223
no military in sight.

165
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,517
Not a shot was fired.

166
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,979
All the village
was filled with

167
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,520
was women, children,
and old men.

168
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,814
They were frightened
and very eager to please,

169
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,314
so we quickly herded them up
into a ditch,

170
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,657
and we sat around waiting
for several hours

171
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,197
for some word
from headquarters

172
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,366
as to what we were to do
with them.

173
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,784
People in the meantime

174
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,829
were kept in the ditch
in the boiling sun,

175
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,576
and were not allowed
to relieve themselves

176
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,578
or go for any water.

177
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,045
Get them in the ditch!

178
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,039
Way down to the end.

179
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,678
There must be some mistake.

180
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,723
There's no mistake, sir.

181
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,561
The order was perfectly clear.

182
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,688
Get me headquarters
on the phone again.

183
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,987
Give me that phone.
I want to hear it myself.

184
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:10,036
If you fellows refuse,
all hell can break loose.

185
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,655
You know that.

186
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,455
Are you absolutely sure, sir?

187
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,463
There can be no mistake
down the line?

188
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,042
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.

189
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,350
Waste them.

190
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,018
You mean the civilians?

191
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,310
That's the order,
clear as hell.

192
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,779
Direct from Saigon.

193
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,237
We're to waste them.

194
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,069
All right,
all you men on your feet.

195
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,211
Think clearly, now.

196
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,958
You disobey this order,
and they can hang you.

197
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,879
Lock and load!

198
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,598
God almighty.

199
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,726
What's happening to us?

200
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,645
Aim!

201
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,275
Fire!

202
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,273
So it was this
senseless slaughter

203
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,111
and sadistic brutality

204
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,026
coming as official orders
from Washington

205
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,274
that turned you
against America.

206
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,117
No, not really.

207
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,203
In war,
when you've brainwashed men

208
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,822
to become
cold-blooded killers,

209
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,120
you expect them to kill.

210
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,869
Then what was it that made
you bitter toward America?

211
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,167
- Lieutenant Calley.
- Lieutenant Calley?

212
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,462
You mean because he was tried
for war crimes at My Lai?

213
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,255
No, he should have been tried.

214
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,846
And so should all those
Colonels and Generals

215
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,260
and White-House Aids

216
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,507
who ordered the whole affair

217
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,431
but were mysteriously let off
soot-free.

218
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,770
Then why Lieutenant Calley?

219
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,606
Because America made him
into such a great hero.

220
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,024
To me they were sick and
diseased men filled with evil,

221
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,646
who cut
innocent women's throats

222
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,523
and blew out the brains
of babies,

223
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,151
and America had raised him up

224
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,402
and made him an national idol.

225
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,450
What was that part

226
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,540
about the President
switching his colors?

227
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,830
On December <i>8</i> 1969,

228
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,874
every newspaper
in this country

229
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,623
carried President Nixon's
sacred promise

230
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,965
that he would personally
investigate My Lai

231
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,551
and he would personally
see to it

232
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,012
that everyone involved,
if they were found guilty,

233
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,052
was punished
to the full limit of the law.

234
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,301
And so you feel that since
every officer involved to date

235
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,723
has gone free,

236
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,222
Nixon failed his pledge.

237
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,645
Like any other mealy-mouth
sell-out politician,

238
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,768
when he found out that he could
get more votes

239
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,488
by supporting Calley,
he did a complete flip flop.

240
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,654
And when I saw
that the American people

241
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,991
supported him in this,

242
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,704
I knew then that the American
conscience was dead

243
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,244
and that the great spirit
of this nation,

244
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,334
which to me began back in
Boston and Virginia

245
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,705
duflng
the American Revolution,

246
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,002
that it could never again
be revived.

247
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,844
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

248
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,758
have you reached a decision?

249
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,677
We have, Your Honor.

250
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,890
We the it"!!!

251
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,430
Unanimously find Billy Jack

252
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,179
guilty of involuntary
manslaughter.

253
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,202
Well, that's that.

254
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,039
I think you'll find
that the end

255
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,459
of your little school
out there, Doc.

256
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,048
Well, it's not my school,

257
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,588
but, I'll take a bet on it.

258
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,805
Billy Jack wasn't the center
of power of that school.

259
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,970
Who, then?
Jean?

260
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:44,140
You know,
to prove something for Billy,

261
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,387
she's going to make
that place grow and grow.

262
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,141
My guess is it's going
to take off like a brush fire.

263
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,892
That quiet little girl?

264
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,066
That quiet little girl, my butt.
That's like saying a

265
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,566
rattle snake's got a
quiet little bite.

266
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,660
For all our sakes,
I hope your wrong.

267
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,325
Respecting
your good intentions, Doc,

268
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,450
when people have such wildly
different attitudes,

269
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,667
there's no way
they are going to live together

270
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,958
without generating violence.

271
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,707
We've all had
too much of that already.

272
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,971
<i>So, Though the trial of
Billy Jack as a person was over</i>

273
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,466
and he was sentenced
from 5-15 years

274
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,012
in the state penitentiary,

275
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,602
the kids decided

276
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,518
that Billy Jack was really
kind of a symbol to live by

277
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,481
and that the Trial
of Billy Jack

278
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,602
as that kind of an ideal,
had just begun.

279
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,354
So they immediately set out

280
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,901
to make the school bigger
and better than ever before.

281
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,120
That first year
that Billy was in prison,

282
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,831
they found an old abandoned
Military Academy,

283
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,292
which they renovated entirely
by themselves,

284
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,879
begging, borrowing and
scrounging everywhere they could

285
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,249
for money or materials
to make it go.

286
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,126
Listen, everybody.

287
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,799
I just had a bakery that donated
100 loaves of bread.

288
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,389
<i>The entire school was built
and owned by the kids,</i>

289
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,137
<i>and they governed themselves
on the simple philosophy</i>

290
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,889
<i>that where there is power,</i>

291
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,311
<i>there can never be love,</i>

292
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,808
<i>and where there is love,</i>

293
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,810
<i>there's no need for power.</i>

294
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,155
<i>Knowing that you can't really
deal and understand other people</i>

295
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,867
<i>until you first understand
yourself, every program was</i>

296
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,032
<i>based on learning how to
cope and understand</i>

297
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,905
<i>your own feelings first</i>

298
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,375
<i>in order to understand
and relate to other people.</i>

299
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,336
<i>This philosophy
they carried into everything,</i>

300
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,502
<i>from meditation
and body awareness exercises,</i>

301
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,671
<i>all kinds of dance,</i>

302
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,544
<i>even belly dancing.</i>

303
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,592
<i>Music, band, drill team,</i>

304
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,840
<i>arts, crafts,
advanced physics,</i>

305
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,343
<i>mathematics, psychology,</i>

306
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,015
the classics,

307
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,262
<i>even into athletics,</i>

308
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,264
<i>which they called
yoga athletics.</i>

309
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,188
<i>From yoga tennis
to yoga football,</i>

310
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,607
<i>and every sport in between.</i>

311
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,196
<i>The idea always being</i>

312
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,689
<i>that the thrill
of participating</i>

313
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,534
<i>and the self discipline one
develops while training,</i>

314
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,369
<i>preparing and learning,</i>

315
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,114
<i>made one a winner
for the rest of his life,</i>

316
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,207
<i>no matter how well he played</i>

317
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,748
<i>or how the temporary
contest came out.</i>

318
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,541
<i>And so winning and losing</i>

319
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,790
<i>or worrying about someone
grading your efforts</i>

320
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:22,294
<i>was just not all
that important anymore.</i>

321
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,467
<i>Growing and having the fun

00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,888

<i>That's right.</i>

<i>With some of the royalties,</i>

342
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,957
<i>they started an institute
for child abuse</i>

343
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,042
<i>and children's rights,</i>

344
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,788
<i>and in working with these abused
and orphaned children,</i>

345
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,166
<i>they were stunned to find out
what was secretly going on</i>

346
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:46,465
<i>in children's orphanages
and juvenile courts,</i>

347
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:50,340
<i>state institutions for
disturbed and retarded children,</i>

348
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,891
<i>children's hospitals,
and education in general.</i>

349
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,183
<i>Was that when they started</i>

350
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,308
<i>their Nader-type newspaper
and magazine</i>

351
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,309
<i>and then began
those scorching exposés</i>

352
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,856
<i>on government corruption
and consumer rip-off.</i>

353
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,353
<i>That's right.</i>

354
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,855
<i>And it was
in doing those exposés</i>

355
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,733
<i>that our troubles
really began.</i>

356
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,030
We've been digging.

357
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,199
Remember back in December
of '73

358
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,493
when the-- the Interior
Department,

359
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,661
called in,

360
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,659
was it 250 oil executives

361
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,911
to work
on the fuel allocation, right?

362
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,663
So we started digging
behind that,

363
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,507
and we found out that the
oil barons and the White House

364
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,672
manipulated
the whole energy crisis,

365
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,420
including the Israeli war,

366
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,762
for just unbelievable profits.

367
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,258
It makes the Alaskan pipeline
look like kids' stuff.

368
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,601
But are you aware
what could happen?

369
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,437
I mean, that could blow
the dome off the capitol.

370
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,774
I mean we'd have the FBI,
the CIA, the plumbers,

371
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,142
the plumbers' plumbers,

372
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,362
the sequel to the plumbers...
it'd be a tremendous blow.

373
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,947
You know what they can do?

374
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,692
If we don't tell our sources
they can arrest us.

375
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,114
Just like that.

376
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,079
She's absolutely right,
I mean, it happened in '72.

377
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:59,792
The <i>LA Times</i> spent $200,000 in
legal fees defending their

378
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,208
reporters who were subpoenaed
to reveal their sources.

379
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,580
I mean that's the LA Times.

380
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,549
We don't stand a chance.

381
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,964
They're either gonna blow us
up altogether, or they're

382
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,713
just gonna close
the school down.

383
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,388
I want to do an expose
on the IBM ribbon conspiracy.

384
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,807
<i>The fantastic reader
response made the kids</i>

385
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,606
<i>determined to bring these
exposes to a wider public</i>

386
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:29,481
<i>so they decided to build
their own TV station.</i>

387
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,279
<i>They put on a Fourth of July-

388
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:37,156
<i>which they called "1984 is
closer than you think.“</i>

389
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,750
<i>And it culminated in the largest

<i>ever held in this country.</i>

<i>No, it was just before.</i>

<i>Oh, I know.</i>

405
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,137
<i>I covered a candidate

<i>That's right. And because
of things like that the</i>

410
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,061
<i>kids decided to fight fire with
fire before it was too late.</i>

411
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,404
<i>I mean, look at how they
packaged Nixon</i>

412
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,319
as <i>the law and order candidate
who would bind the nation's</i>

413
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,159
<i>wounds and bring
us all together.</i>

414
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,948
<i>Well, we all bought it.</i>

415
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:02,199
<i>That's right. So the kids
decided to use television</i>

416
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,746
<i>to fight television
before it was too late.</i>

417
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,165
<i>And they took their
investigations being done in</i>

418
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,086
<i>the magazines right into the
streets where the public could</i>

419
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,175
<i>see for themselves the secret
deals and rip-offs right where</i>

420
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,215
they were happening.

421
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,758
So in other words,
Mrs. Childs,

422
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,676
you missed one payment while
you were in the hospital.

423
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,346
No, I missed three payments.

424
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,095
I was behind before I went
into the hospital.

425
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,767
Okay. So you missed three
payments and then they

426
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,356
repossessed your furniture.

427
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,854
And when you went to
make up the payments,

428
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,899
you had found that
they destroyed your furniture

429
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,691
and repossessed it and now

430
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,033
they refuse to refund the money
to you on which you paid on it

431
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,074
two years before they
repossessed it.

432
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,367
- Now ,is that correct?
- Honey, that's correct.

433
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:46,959
Twenty-three years in this town
doing a helluva job, just

434
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:52,378
following orders, and because
of one crazy nigger, I'm dead.

435
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,874
It's not the woman.

436
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,878
It's that school
and their TV station.

437
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,473
I think the manager's going to
come out. Get on camera two.

438
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,807
Okay. All right.

439
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,269
Excuse me. Um, we think
as assistant manager

440
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,980
that we should have
the store's side of the story

441
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,816
so that we can have all of the
viewpoints presented fairly.

442
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,934
May we have a comment?

443
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,481
No comment.

444
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,821
We were just trying
to be fair, sir.

445
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,065
We tried.

446
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,784
Hello?

447
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:20,822
Yes, sir.

448
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,990
Just a minute, please.

449
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,954
Telephone, Mr. Bromner.

450
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,447

Well, thank you, sir.

453
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,627
It's a tough situation.

454
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,299
Right.

455
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,298
Well, I just went according
to the manual, sir.

456
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,518
Right away.

457
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,512
Replace the old lady's
furniture.

458
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,763
With used furniture?

459
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,356
With brand-new.

460
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,942
It just hit the wire services.

461
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,107
Those crazy, lousy kids.

462
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:55,979
What do they think,

463
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,775
I wanted to take
the old lady's furniture?

464
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,452
<i>It was shortly after that

lie detector that was even more</i>

477
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,780
<i>accurate than the
polygraph machine.</i>

478
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,736
I don't get it,
how does it work?

479
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,157
Well, just by a person's voice
alone, off the telephone or off

480
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,871
or off the television.

481
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,332
It's even more accurate than
a normal lie detector.

482
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,909
I don't believe it.

483
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,126
Well, watch the--

484
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,916
Watch the thing and
watch the needle.

485
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,881
And so it is your contention
then, Governor, that the threat

486
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,843
of exposure by the Freedom
School television station

487
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,009
will in no way find any
wrongdoing or kickback

488
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:08,180
of this federal money ever
touching the state capitol?

489
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,519
As God is my judge, Mr. Mudd,

490
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,765
if there were a stack of Bibles
on this table before me,

491
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,858
I swear to you that I have
absolutely no knowledge

492
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:20,196
of any kind of corruption
by any member of my staff.

493
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,191
- Not one.
- Wow.

494
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,864
Good Lord, that guy's lying
through his teeth.

495
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,612
Grover, think of what
this machine would do

496
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,786
to the advertising industry,
it'd just blow it apart.

497
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,032
Think of what we
could have saved

498
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,000
on the Watergate hearings.

499
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,368
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

500
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,790
I've got an idea.

501
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,708
Why don't we get the tapes
to the Watergate hearings

502
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,083
and run them off on this thing
and finally find out the truth?

503
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,386
Pardon me, Mrs. Merrick,
we're from the FBI

504
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,310
and, uh, we'd just like to ask
you a few routine questions

505
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,307
about your child.

506
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,558
Is something wrong?

507
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,560
No, uh, does she go
to the Freedom School?

508
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,982
Yes, sir.

509
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,071
Do you know about the
TV station that they operate?

510
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,190
Yes, sir.

511
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,691
Does she have anything
to do with that?

512
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,487
No. No, she doesn't.

513
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,486
<i>Now, during all
this time Billy was in prison,</i>

514
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,659
<i>did you visit him regularly?</i>

515
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,532
<i>No. Billy's humiliation
at being caged up</i>

516
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,158
<i>like an animal was so great</i>

517
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,412
<i>that he wouldn't let
any of us visit him. Ever.</i>

518
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,833
<i>For all four years?</i>

519
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,921
<i>Didn't you miss him?</i>

520
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,415
<i>Terribly.</i>

521
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,464
<i>But he wrote to me every day
and that helped keep me going.</i>

522
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,509
<i>Except, every time the mail
came, I held my breath,</i>

523
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,429
<i>hoping he hadn't given them an
excuse to extend his sentence</i>

524
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,018
<i>or even kill him.</i>

525
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,887
Have the doctors told
you if you'll be able to walk

526
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,104
normally again?

527
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,395
Of course she'll be able
to walk normally again.

528
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,109
So you really didn't
think they'd let

529
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,319
Billy out of prison alive?

530
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,858
No, not even if they had to
shoot him

531
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,030
when he was going
through the gates on parole.

532
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,575
Bet you remember that day
when he got out.

533
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,078
I sure do.

534
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,120
It was the day we had

535
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,840
our first international seminar
on child abuse.

536
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,255
Child abuse?

537
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,428
Yeah,

538
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,590
the kids had done
an expose on child abuse,

539
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,059
child battering,

540
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:17,430
and how widespread
it is here in this country.

541
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,648
Pretty soon, we became
recognized

542
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,197
as one of the few places

543
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,286
that could successfully
help parents

544
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,035
who battered their children.

545
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,676
This is our one-to-one
type therapy.

546
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,220
Almost all of it is done
by lay therapists.

547
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,683
Our kids here at the school.

548
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,769
Was the boy born
without his hand?

549
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,515
No, his father cut it off
in a fit of rage.

550
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,857
It's a horrible history
of torture.

551
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,195
All of our professional staff
has pretty much given up on him.

552
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,441
Only Carol refuses to take no
for an answer.

553
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,533
You don't really think
she'll succeed?

554
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,368
You obviously
don't know Carol.

555
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,655
Okay, tough monkey.

556
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,825
Time to shower up
for the press.

557
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,089
Go ahead.

558
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,516
You're just a couple of hours
away from freedom.

559
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,761
Go ahead and give me one
of those fancy kicks.

560
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:43,316
Now, Indian Buck, move out.

561
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,161
So in summary then, you're
saying to love those

562
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,655
that we find really despicable,
that we really can hate,

563
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,499
and I can really hate
these people that cut off

564
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,539
the fingers and beat
their children,

565
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,837
and somehow in the experience
of loving them,

566
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,629
they are going to change
before our eyes

567
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,342
and stop
beating their children.

568
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,256
That's it, exactly.

569
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,222
As you know, in a normal
parent-child relationship,

570
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,637
the parent is there to supply
the child's needs.

571
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,890
But, in the case
of the child abuser,

572
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,225
the parent is so desperate
for love,

573
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,974
he expects the child
to fulfill his needs.

574
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,102
Well, when the child can't do
it, or is incapable

575
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,194
or for whatever reason,

576
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,279
the parent ends up
beating him.

577
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,442
I'm sure some of you have
experienced this, say,

578
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,160
of some parents that have
watched their children

579
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,073
in little league?

580
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,994
We find that one child
usually becomes the scapegoat.

581
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,992
It's usually the child
most resembling the parent

582
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,243
doing the abusing.

583
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,295
You know, when you think
about it,

584
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,381
there are many, many kinds
of child abuse.

585
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,796
But it's only when it breaks
out in physical violence

586
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,215
that we recognize it
as something horrible.

587
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:59,718
Dr. Roberts, your complete
claim then is that by loving

588
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:00,934
these battering parents

589
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,520
instead of punishing
or confining them,

590
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,015
that that actually works
in stopping further beating

591
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,391
of their children.

592
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,063
Absolutely.

593
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,858
You're involved in child abuse,
and I'll bet you're using

594
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,230
some form of punishment,

595
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,778
threat, or maybe even jailing,
I don't know.

596
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,576
Now, you know your cure rate
is less than 25 percent.

597
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,414
Ours, on the other hand,
is over 90.

598
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,329
Dr. Roberts?

599
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,668
- I'm sorry.
- I beg your pardon.

600
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,253
Go ahead.

601
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,999
The whole fate
of the human race depends

602
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,000
upon our ability

603
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,753
to handle and recognize
normal aggression

604
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,256
and the hostility in us.

605
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,008
Now, have you thought
about applying this

606
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,851
to other areas of our society?

607
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,642
Yes, as an example,
this entire school here is

608
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,105
built upon the same principle.

609
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,191
And we would fervently like
to try it in other areas.

610
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,694
What Jean has really
taught us here

611
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,108
and in the child abuse center,

612
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,983
is that everyone has inside
of them a fantastic force,

613
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,070
and it can really change
people once it's unleashed.

614
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,531
So that's where the school
gets its pacifism?

615
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,952
I'm sorry, I just can't
stomach that word pacifism.

616
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,125
Because when people hear that
we're pacifists,

617
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,463
they automatically feel we're
sitting around waiting

618
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,210
and sometimes even retreating
from life, whereas we feel

619
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,134
the thing that we've got here
is a living, dynamic,

620
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,551
positive force

621
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,677
that has the ability to change
the most warped lives,

622
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,471
turn on the most confused
and lost people

623
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,098
and I think we all literally
feel here that it could

624
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,225
possibly rebuild the world.

625
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,774
Is this what you call
nonviolence?

626
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,237
No, I'm sorry.

627
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,983
We call it by something
much cornier than that.

628
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,530
We call it love.

629
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,120
- Can any of us go along?
- No.

630
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,552
Billy, there's a big press
contingent waiting

631
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,765
for you up in my office.

632
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,473
And I think it would be
a good idea for you and me

633
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,139
to get together

634
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,854
and talk about what we're
going to say.

635
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,391
That it?

636
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:18,781
Billy, it would be
to everyone's advantage

637
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,241
if you would cooperate
with Warden Cells.

638
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,287
He's a hard head.
He'll be back.

639
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:38,213
No way. They've already
got him marked.

640
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,631
You mean they'll kill him?

Nope, I missed.

688
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,928
Mike?

689
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,649
Hai.

690
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,029
- Karate?
- Hapkido.

691
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,410
I know that, but what are
you doing in it?

692
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,873
What do you mean by that?

693
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,460
It's just funny, I'm sorry.

694
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,455
You're such a timid,
squeaky clean little mouse.

695
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,433
I thought you were
supposed to be

696
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,144
nonviolent, for God's sakes.

697
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,764
Even the Buddhist monks had
to learn something to keep

698
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,061
from being attacked.

699
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,604
Think about all those men
out there

700
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,898
who'd like to get her hands
on their sexy little body.

701
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,942

Here, let me help you.

704
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,410

is my own body.

705
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,624
My God, you broke my back.

706
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:58,461
Billy, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Han from Korea.

707
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,876
A hapkido master here
in the United States.

708
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,500
How do you do.

709
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,798
I have had the honor
of hearing about your kicks

710
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,216
in Korea.

711
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,554
Thank you.

712
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,094
Is it true, do you really--

713
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,513
Can you jump the spin kick?

714
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,640
After you.

715
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,158
Be my guest.

716
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,765
Just hold it, like that.

717
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,159
I haven't seen one of those
in a long time.

718
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,624
Would you like to try it?

719
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,173
After you.

720
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,976
Be my guest.

721
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,664
You and I and my master are
the only ones I know

722
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,414
who can do that.

723
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,335
Thank you very much.

724
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,882
Running Deer and his two sons

725
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,175
have been lost
for almost a week

726
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,549
in that snow storm
up in the Taos mountains.

727
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,516
Blue Elk wants to know
if any of our skiers

728
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,352
or any of the kids
from the survival program

729
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,470
can go up and search.

730
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,971
How about the rescue patrol,
Blue Elk?

731
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,814
Have they been notified?

732
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,809
The highway patrol
and the ranger stations,

733
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,403
they don't give a damn
when Indians are involved.

734
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,192
At the rangers station all
they could tell us

735
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,735
is that he's probably
out drunk someplace

736
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,653
and they refused to help us.

737
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,243
Okay. I'll get the sheriff.

738
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,736
Carol, you go get
some of the kids

739
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,908
in their winter gear.

740
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,531
And tell them to dress warm
'cause it's a terrible

741
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,998
blizzard up there.

742
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,252
The family has been starving
for weeks.

743
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,247
The father and the two sons
went out after deer,

744
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,965
and they're probably lost
in that storm

745
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,129
up on Independence Ridge.

746
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,011
See if you can get a chopper
into Latigo Canyon.

747
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,339
If not, try to get someone
to ski down the other side

748
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,636
of Independence. Over.

749
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,554
There's no way I can
get it open.

750
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,728
Okay.

751
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,861
<i>Uh, Ground Control,</i>

752
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,408
<i>Ground Control, over.</i>

753
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,076
<i>This is Ground Control. Over.</i>

754
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,541
<i>We're moving
down the south range</i>

755
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,536
<i>and will try to get in with
some ground equipment. Over.</i>

756
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,709
<i>Ground rescue is underway.</i>

757
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:31,378
<i>Team three, is there any way
you can get around the storm?</i>

758
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,626
<i>Try to come in east
of the Taos divide?</i>

759
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,094
<i>This is air rescue four.</i>

760
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,135
<i>We're over the Taos divide
right now.</i>

761
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,758
<i>It's just as socked in
up here.</i>

762
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,352
<i>Looks like it's moving south.
What about ski patrol? Over.</i>

763
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,811
<i>They're all over the place</i>

764
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,897
<i>but the blizzard's so bad on the
ground they can't even see.</i>

765
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,270
<i>Stand by.</i>

766
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,731
<i>Uh, this is chopper
seven, the only way you</i>

767
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,570
<i>would get down there is
to lift them up these ridges</i>

768
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,734
<i>and let them ski in. Over.</i>

769
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,402
<i>They're being
lifted now. Over.</i>

770
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,490
<i>Ground, this is
chopper seven.</i>

771
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,369
<i>We found two of them,
two boys. one's dead.</i>

772
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:11,122
<i>The other one's almost.
Alert central we're on the way.</i>

773
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,767
This is instrument four,
instrument four calling.

774
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,486
Can anybody read me?
Please somebody come over.

775
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,948
Somebody please, damn it,
come on in.

776
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,035
<i>Rescue three, I've been
getting a weak signal</i>

777
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,246
<i>that keeps fading in and cutting
out and it could be coming</i>

778
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,706
<i>from the other side
of these peaks.</i>

779
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,541
<i>Let's go have a look.</i>

780
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,042
Is he alive?

781
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,915
Just barely, and I can't get
anybody on this thing.

782
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,167
No. You never will
with these peaks.

783
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,760
Can you get below this storm
down over on

784
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,878
Independence Ridge?

785
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,550
I can try.

786
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,094
Go.

787
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,596
All right. Let's take this one
down to the Morgue, huh?

788
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,215
Sheriff. I'm really sorry.

789
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,602
Why are you bringing him
in here?

790
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,149
That's what they told me
to do with him.

791
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,863
Well, he goes
down to city hospital.

792
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,573
Bundle him up good and go
with him in the ambulance.

793
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:01,907
Ambulance? Where are you
taking him?

794
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,947
- Down to the Indian Hospital.
- Well, that will waste time.

795
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,194
Why not treat him here?

796
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,116
I wouldn't do it if I thought
it were dangerous.

797
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,582
You mean you can't even keep
an Indian here one or two days

798
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,121
in an emergency?

799
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,960
Look, I'm just an intern.

800
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,167
I don't make the rules.

801
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,627
Well, you're not
gonna move him.

802
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,251
He could lose a hand
or a foot.

803
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,922
- Well--
- Tell me.

804
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,387
What would you do if he were
a white man and you

805
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,255
could treat him?

806
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,216
Well, I'd pack his extremities
and start him on some

807
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,683
vasodilator of IVs.

808
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:31,975
Show me.

809
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,811
You could be arrested
for making me do this.

810
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,684
You know that.

811
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:41,864
Now.

812
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,410
What the hell
is going on here?

813
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,005
Vasodilator IVs for each one.

814
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,624
Come on, Doctor. I'll take
the responsibility.

815
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,626
And bring those packs
over here and start applying

816
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:02,502
them to their lower legs

817
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,969
and I'll take the hands.

818
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,679
And raise them up.

819
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,720
Come on, Doctor, move.

820
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,728
My client Running Deer wishes
to have it entered

821
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,436
into the record

822
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,182
that it is his position
that the Indian is a member

823
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,311
of the Sovereign Nation and is
not subject to the laws

824
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,779
of this land and this state.

825
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:25,491
And that therefore, this court
has no jurisdiction.

826
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:27,280
So entered.

827
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,200
Your Honor, in so far as
the defendant

828
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,868
is still hospitalized,

829
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,492
and in addition has suffered
the severe personal hardship

830
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:38,121
of the loss of his oldest son,
the state petitions the court

831
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,499
for leniency and pleads
for a lesser sentence.

832
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,966
Hey, don't rip
your pants, buster.

833
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,633
In view
of the voluntary pleading

834
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,723
and the personal hardships
encountered,

835
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,640
the court reduces
the mandatory sentence

836
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,513
for trespassing and illegal
hunting of deer

837
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,186
from one year
minus a day in jail

838
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,730
to ten days
in the county jail.

839
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,110
Quiet. Quiet.

840
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,199
And a period of probation
to be not less than one year.

841
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,117
Bailiff. Bailiff.

842
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,749
Oh, Lord.

843
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,967
Now what are they
being hassled for?

844
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,140
All right, Ken. Tell
headquarters that we don't

845
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,182
need any more help.

846
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,430
I demand to know what's
going on here.

847
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,148
Look, lady, mind
your own business.

848
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,391
Get back in your car.

849
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,393
This is my business.
These are my students,

850
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,439
now tell me what's going on.

851
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,313
Lady, they were disturbing
the peace, we got

852
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,234
a report of possession.

853
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,778
We're just checking it out.
Now, I suggest you stand back

854
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,823
or I will arrest you
for interference.

855
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,445
You just try it.

856
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,198
Hey, they can't search you
unless they've got a warrant.

857
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,916
All right, punk.
Move it out.

858
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,456
I've got every right to stand
here, I'm a citizen.

859
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,171
Well, so am I, punk,
now move it out.

860
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,558
They have no right to search
you without a warrant.

861
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,519
Tell them so, out loud, and
they'll be in contempt of court.

862
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:39,333
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

863
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,826
It's your choice, lady.

864
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,954
You can do as you're told
or get your head split open.

865
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,252
Listen, buster, you're not
gonna feel me up.

866
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,591
I'll search you right here,
or in the paddy wagon.

867
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,925
It's your choice.

868
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,261
Jim, you're out of line,
now knock it off.

869
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,723
Well, my dear.

870
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,472
You can feel me up right here,
in the bus or the lawn.

871
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,221
Anywhere you want to do it.

872
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,318
Well, can't win them all.

873
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,923
All right, folks. Move it.

874
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,011
We aren't gonna ask
you again, now move it.

875
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,892
Okay alley lawyer.

876
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,315
You can go now.

877
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,108
Unless you've got
something else to say.

878
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,482
Hey, we've got
a tough monkey here.

879
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,995
Feels he don't have to
move off like the others.

880
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,830
Okay, mister.

881
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,165
You were ordered to disperse.

882
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,035
And that means now.

883
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,382
Somebody else need a lesson?

884
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,677
Yeah, our tough monkey here.

885
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,846
Say, isn't that--

886
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,116
We're gonna have to shoot him.

887
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,917
Too big a mess.

888
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,302
Billy, you heard
what the sheriff said.

889
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,266
You just can't keep
doing this.

890
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,930
Well, what would you rather
I did, then?

891
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,350
Let them club him to death?

892
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:08,440
Under alienation and
guardianship the government

893
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,812
has the right to sell,
trade or give away

894
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,905
all the Indian land
to whomever it pleases.

895
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,490
Yeah.

896
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,655
Which are usually
their friends who put

897
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,652
up campaign funds.

898
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,458
And under guardianship they
control our water,

899
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,374
they control our plumbing,
they control our worship,

900
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,464
they control our land
and they control our money.

901
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,959
They control every damn thing
in our lives.

902
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,258
Mr. Strump.

903
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:42,475
As our agent, we want to know
what you going to do.

904
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,809
What the Congress declared

905
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:49,228
was a bill giving you
self-determination.

906
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,271
Hah! Congress is a bunch

907
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:53,565
of filthy rotten,
lying thieves.

908
00:58:56,074 --> 00:59:00,033
And to get some industry
in here by either leasing

909
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,152
or selling this land

910
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:04,497
which isn't worth a damn
to anybody anyway.

911
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,867
If it isn't worth a damn,
why the hell

912
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,835
are all these oil companies

913
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:15,004
and mining interests so eager
to get their hands on it?

914
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,718
We'd like to know,
Agent Strump. Tell us.

915
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,383
Yellow Hawk, give us those
statistics which show

916
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,097
how many jobs will be
provided for

917
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,341
here on the reservation
by these people.

918
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,344
That's not Yellow Hawk.

919
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,936
That's little uncle
Tommy Hawk.

920
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,647
He's what Crazy Horse called
a loaf around the fort.

921
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,726
He's a bought and paid apple
and you know it.

922
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,478
It happens every time
you radical activists

923
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:36,194
come in here.

924
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:39,532
You tear up everything
and then you skip out.

925
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,946
And it's the children
and those of us that are

926
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,910
left behind that have to stay
and take the beating.

927
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,575
My father was
a tribal chairman.

928
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,873
And my grandfather was a man
of medicine for many years.

929
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,041
And I'm an activist.

930
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,914
He doesn't mean you, Blue Elk.

931
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,541
- He means me.
- And me.

932
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,337
And in a sense he's right.

933
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,712
They do have to put up
with pressure every day.

934
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,429
- They control our--
- How's it going?

935
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,389
Not very good, I'm afraid.

936
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,928
And you know who
the trustee is.

937
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,303
It's Posner's
First National Bank.

938
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,558
In this state.

939
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,899
And he's got $80 million
of Indian money in his trust.

940
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:17,020
I thought we were here
to discuss Running Deer.

941
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:20,068
To get the tribal permission
to use him as a test case

942
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,783
for international law
before the world court.

943
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:26,404
We've got names, we've got
dates and exact amounts,

944
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:30,282
and we're going to bring it
out in international court.

945
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,456
A person could get killed
with foolish talk like that.

946
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,080
Many of us already have been.

947
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,297
Because if they can't
buy us out

948
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,917
with scholarships and grants,
they kill us.

949
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:42,215
Yeah.

950
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,259
Well, what happened?

951
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:51,103
They voted it down.

952
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,972
And that damned Yellow Hawk
will probably get

953
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,099
a personal invitation
to the White House for that.

954
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,817
I don't understand.

955
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,027
How in the world do they keep
him in line so?

956
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,613
They caught him embezzling
funds and the White House

957
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,404
promised to hush it up
if he'd cooperate.

958
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,368
You know, the same old story.

959
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,408
Why don't you guys take
Running Deer's case

960
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,622
to world court
just by yourselves?

961
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,081
I mean, you don't
have to bother

962
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,497
with all these committee
and tribal decision things.

963
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,666
Well, that just divides us
by having Indian

964
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,540
fighting Indian.
You know, divide and conquer.

965
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:21,792
That's the way that they've
always beaten us.

966
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,544
Now, that's your whole problem
right there.

967
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,387
- Hmm?
- What?

968
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,349
You got all chiefs
and no Indians.

969
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,094
That is so bad.

970
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,187
I can't even believe it.

971
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,523
That is really poor.
That is really bad.

972
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,068
If it's illegal for an Indian
to go out and hunt deer,

973
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,532
how come it's all of a sudden
legal for you and your bunch?

974
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,072
Because it's deer hunting
season, and we've all

975
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,070
got our licenses. That's why.

976
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,323
Not on Indian land it isn't.

977
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,369
Not for you anyway.

978
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,662
It's still illegal.

979
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:58,082
Carl, this is no longer
Indian reservation land.

980
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,705
It's all been terminated.

981
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,832
The Indians won't accept that.

982
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,584
Besides, this land's
sacred to them.

983
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,710
There'll be trouble.

984
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,213
We do this every year, Carl.
You know that.

985
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,841
Yeah, but you don't lock up a
starving Indian every year.

986
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,592
Tempers are still pretty hot
over that one.

987
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:15,096
Carl, on this bus we've got
corporation presidents,

988
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:18,519
Pentagon officials,
Washington politicians,

989
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,563
and even
the lieutenant governor.

990
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,857
You big ignorant pig.

991
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,526
- Who you calling a p_ig?
- I'm calling you a plg.

992
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,366
With all of those big wheels
back there, do you expect

993
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,488
me to go say,
"Sorry, we gotta all go home"?

994
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,417
Order.

995
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,089
Order, order! Order!

996
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,757
Crazy drunks.

997
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,550
Shooting at anything
that moves.

998
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,423
Our women and children
are afraid to move

999
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,050
out of their homes for water.

1000
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:55,393
Yeah!

1001
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,559
Who is it they're shooting?
What are you talking about?

1002
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,897
Running Deer couldn't even
kill a deer and feed

1003
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,483
his starving family.

1004
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,272
Right!

1005
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,691
Indians have to go hungry.

1006
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:09,071
But these trophy hunters,
they come in here and they do

1007
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,567
as they damn please.

1008
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,362
And kill all the deer
they want.

1009
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:16,240
Yeah!

1010
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,208
All right.

1011
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,373
The question is, what are we
going to do about it.

1012
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,711
Let's run them out.

1013
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,587
I think we should take
some cameras and go down

1014
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,756
and take some pictures
of them and their call girls

1015
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,004
in the nude and turn them
in to the newspaper.

1016
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:34,509
Hey. Better than that,
better than that.

1017
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,430
Let's send them
to their wives.

1018
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:39,271
--Got a right to hunt
on Indian land.

1019
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,359
That's what the law students
were trying to tell you before.

1020
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,569
That's no longer Indian land.

1021
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,281
That's part of the reservation
that they've been quietly

1022
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:51,571
terminating for our own good.

1023
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:56,037
Not to me it isn't.

1024
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,873
What is that supposed to mean?

1025
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,958
I never voted for termination.

1026
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:03,079
Did anybody in this room
ever vote for termination?

1027
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,710
No!

1028
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,253
Do you know
of any tribal member

1029
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,547
who knowingly voted
for termination?

1030
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,511
No!

1031
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:14,765
Then to me they're still
illegally on Indian land

1032
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,476
and this tribal council has
the authority to arrest them

1033
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:18,765
and drive them out.

1034
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,602
What do you mean, arrest them?

1035
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:23,770
Who's gonna do it?

1036
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,360
I will. The tribal police.

1037
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:30,068
Or anyone in this room who is
man enough to go with me.

1038
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,782
Or tell me something.

1039
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,243
Are you afraid to stand up to
the white man even when he's

1040
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,236
shooting at your wives
and your children?

1041
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,908
No!

1042
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:44,291
Me and my rifle can be
any place you say

1043
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,584
within half an hour.

1044
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,632
Now, they're calling
this the international

1045
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,095
symposium on the law.

1046
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,557
And the American Indian
legal rights--

1047
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,846
And let me tell
you guys something.

1048
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,641
The real purpose of this is to
make it look like everybody's

1049
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,934
stealing from the Indians.

1050
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,431
Oh, come on, Posner.

1051
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,935
I've handled dozens of land
sales of Indians and even I

1052
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:10,608
don't know what
termination is. Do you?

1053
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:14,279
Look, these radical Indians are
taking payoffs on all sides.

1054
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,118
Who cares? As long as they
don't terminate my lease.

1055
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,784
I've only got 92 more years
for it to run.

1056
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,208
Well, you sure as hell better
hope that conference

1057
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,452
never takes place.

1058
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:28,330
Because if it does, we're all
in for a lot of surprises.

1059
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:20,800
I order you to drop your guns.

1060
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,022
You sentence our brother
Running Deer to jail

1061
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:35,022
for killing a deer to feed
his starving children,

1062
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:38,697
and yet you dare to come here
and do this?

1063
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,787
What, do you call this sport?

1064
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,202
I was wrong.

1065
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:47,702
I'll correct that injustice
to the Indian.

1066
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:48,622
Well, tell me.

1067
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,836
Just how are you
going to do that?

1068
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:53,339
He's already spent ten days
rotting in your lousy jail

1069
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,549
like a caged animal.

1070
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,340
I'll give Running Deer a job.
A good job.

1071
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:00,047
More money than he could
possibly earn.

1072
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,469
Because he's an Indian?

1073
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,595
And you've got one pay scale
for your whites and one

1074
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:04,934
for your Indians?

1075
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:08,056
Aw, come on, now.
Don't be childish.

1076
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,556
All of you.

1077
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:13,231
You are all illegally
trespassing on Indian land

1078
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,401
and you are all going to be
tried by us.

1079
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,489
Here and now.

1080
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:21,656
If this is a tribal decision,

1081
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,950
where is Yellow Hawk
and Little Bear?

1082
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,824
Probably back home
sucking up your spit.

1083
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:27,790
Billy.

1084
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,754
I'm Lieutenant Governor Barnes.

1085
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,089
This is George Shipley.

1086
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:38,427
He's the president
of Stonehearst Mining Company.

1087
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,090
This isn't Indian land.

1088
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:43,762
After it was terminated we
purchased a leasehold on it.

1089
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,759
My company holds
the rights to it

1090
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,431
and these men are here
as my guests.

1091
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,062
How many days
after the president

1092
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,811
signed that termination bill

1093
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,400
did your company get
your leasehold?

1094
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,190
Oh, I can't, I can't remember.

1095
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,779
I don't see that has
any bearing.

1096
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,194
How many days?

1097
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,784
The clay after termination
was signed.

1098
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,119
And how much money did you
just happen to contribute

1099
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,830
to the secret campaign fund?

1100
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:12,119
$125,000.

1101
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,048
What did you say
your name was?

1102
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,667
My name is George Shipley.

1103
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:21,010
I'm president of the
Stonehearst Mining Company.

1104
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,054
You know, Shipley, I think
I'll just kill you

1105
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,596
right where you stand.

1106
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,482
We've made a terrible
mistake and you've

1107
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,101
got the upper hand for now.

1108
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:39,529
Take advantage of it and all
you'll do is fan the flames

1109
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,693
of hatred higher.

1110
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:47,621
And then later on, all of us
here, somehow, we'll get even.

1111
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,494
Trying us isn't going
to solve anything.

1112
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:53,038
Blue Elk?
Rolling Thunder?

1113
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,834
I know we don't think much of
each other, but we're realists.

1114
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,253
Now, what the lieutenant
governor has to say is true.

1115
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,469
You may feel good now,
but you're gonna suffer later.

1116
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,678
All right.

1117
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,392
We'll not try you now.

1118
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,854
We'll just take a good clean
picture of each and every one

1119
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,313
of you for future reference.

1120
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,688
Okay. You heard him.

1121
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,730
I want two lines here.

1122
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,025
Women to the front and men
to the rear.

1123
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:24,696
And I want all the men to take
off them hats. Now.

1124
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,444
Oh, you've really gone too far
this time, Billy.

1125
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:30,072
You're making a terrible mistake
photographing those men.

1126
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,541
You know, the last time one of
you Posners uttered

1127
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,705
that lousy cliche,
one of you got killed.

1128
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,248
Now tell me, don't you
ever learn?

1129
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,622
You people back there.
That means you too.

1130
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:39,714
Let's go.

1131
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,958
And I'll swear to God you're
really gonna pay for this one.

1132
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,711
Take that hat off.
I'm talking to you.

1133
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,214
Jean, how much more is gonna
have to happen before you

1134
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:50,343
get those kids to pull back
on those exposes?

1135
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:54,099
Taking pictures of those people
just infuriated them.

1136
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,724
It made matters much worse.

1137
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,395
I know that, Carl.

1138
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,394
But I can't tell the kids on
one hand I have

1139
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:03,443
complete confidence that they
can govern themselves and then

1140
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,565
on the other hand take it away
when there's an important

1141
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,407
decision to be made.

1142
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,448
Either you decide to trust them
on the vital decisions,

1143
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,071
or you don't.
It's as simple as that.

1144
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:13,244
Yes, but you can speak out,
can't you?

1145
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,242
I mean get up and present
your point of view.

1146
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,790
I don't see why you can't
argue against something

1147
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,004
you think is bad
or destructive.

1148
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,964
As long as the kids have
the right to vote it down

1149
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,254
if they don't agree with you.

1150
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,501
Yeah, I know.

1151
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:27,129
But oftentimes kids have
a tendency to hero worship

1152
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,598
and I just think if Billy
or I got up and argued a point

1153
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,591
some of these kids
would just blindly follow

1154
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,593
because they identify
with us so much.

1155
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:36,266
And I'm sorry, I just don't
think that's fair.

1156
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:39,141
What you're saying then is that
when you get right down to it,

1157
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,938
you don't really believe they're
adult enough to make

1158
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,561
their own decisions.

1159
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,362
Grandfather,
I would be honored

1160
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,780
if you would teach me

1161
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,620
how to pierce the veil
and go to that other world

1162
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:55,741
and make my own inward journey
to find my own center.

1163
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:04,170
I would be honored, Grandfather,
if you would teach me the way.

1164
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:09,846
You have many enemies in this
world waiting to destroy you.

1165
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,307
If you are to survive,

1166
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:16,144
you will have to find peace
in yourself first.

1167
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,639
That is why I want to make
the inward journey.

1168
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,230
The inward journey
is dangerous.

1169
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,695
Filled with terrifying evil.

1170
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,486
There are many demons
of great power.

1171
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,281
It takes much wisdom to
learn that they are

1172
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,823
of your own making.

1173
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,164
And first, you must learn
to <i>see</i> your own shadow.

1174
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:39,080
How will I learn to see
my shadow, Grandfather?

1175
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:43,247
Many cannot survive
the dangerous inward journey.

1176
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:47,000
But if you do, in time
you will come face to face

1177
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,002
with your own shadow.

1178
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,801
Then you will know
what I mean.

1179
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,482
I think I see it, Grandfather.

1180
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:10,240
Yes, I see it clearly now.

1181
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,859
What color is it?

1182
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,825
Blue. Bright blue.

1183
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:28,458
That is a spirit looking
to see if you are worthy.

1184
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:31,211
It takes many forms.

1185
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,804
Where did it go?

1186
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:40,391
When you can tell me
where the flame comes from,

1187
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:44,266
I will tell you where it goes
when it goes out.

1188
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:02,576
Grandfather, where will I look
for my shadow demon?

1189
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:05,170
We think the spirits
live out there

1190
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:08,085
but they and the shadow
demon live inside you.

1191
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,630
He is all the evil in you
that others can see in you

1192
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,298
but you cannot.

1193
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,967
Why is that?

1194
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:18,137
We all put forth an image that
we want other people

1195
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,478
to think we are and that we'd
like to think we are,

1196
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,097
but we all have the secret evil
side that is

1197
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,940
painful to discover,

1198
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,685
though others
can see it in us very easily.

1199
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:31,939
How can I come to know
my evil side, Grandfather?

1200
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:35,613
By the things in others
that make you angry.

1201
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:39,113
Whenever you get upset
at someone or something,

1202
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:42,115
it's because that quality that
you're upset about

1203
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,958
really exists in you.

1204
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:48,167
It is always easier to see
the evil in someone else

1205
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:51,007
and by trying to change him,
think you are getting rid

1206
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,219
of your own evil,
your own shadow.

1207
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:58,632
It takes superhuman courage
to see that this fault

1208
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,475
really exists in you.

1209
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:04,142
That what you're really hating
and trying to change

1210
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,856
is a quality of yourself.

1211
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:10,477
Like the rugged man who hates
long-haired youth.

1212
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,981
Underneath, he is secretly
afraid of his own femininity.

1213
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:18,155
Grandfather, may I now descend
to the cave of the dead?

1214
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:21,154
No, you are not yet ready.

1215
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:23,497
First, you must seek
your own vision.

1216
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:26,869
When your heart is open,
your vision will come.

1217
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:30,167
And only after you've received
your vision will you have

1218
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:34,384
some chance to survive
in the cave of the dead.

1219
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,178
Hello, Blue Elk.

1220
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,351
How long has Billy gone
without food and water?

1221
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,019
<i>Seven</i> days now.

1222
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,858
And on the eighth,
if he's worthy of it,

1223
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:51,851
his vision will come.

1224
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,853
But if a woman enters
these sacred grounds

1225
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:55,275
the medicine is lost.

1226
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,364
You'll have to go back,
I'm sorry.

1227
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:58,574
What are you guys gonna do when

1228
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,033
the women's lib
hears about this?

1229
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,074
You'll have to take that
up with the spirits.

1230
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,343
Come, Billy Jack. Come.

1231
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,716
For I am going to show you

1232
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,890
the true nature
of the white man

1233
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,432
through all of history.

1234
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,519
Come and look with me
over this river of time.

1235
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,353
Look out.

1236
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,562
There's St. Augustine,

1237
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:39,737
preaching the Christian creed
of love to the Druid Britons,

1238
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:43,237
with the tips of their lances
dripping with blood.

1239
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:47,787
Oh, and there's King Richard
the Lionhearted,

1240
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,331
slaughtering the heathen until
they convert to Christianity.

1241
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:55,799
Here you see the lie of that
old romanticism you were taught

1242
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,667
about the Crusades as a boy.

1243
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,880
See how they butcher everyone
in this village of Jews

1244
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,966
in the name of God and love?

1245
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:11,390
And remember that great brave
Indian fighter, Kit Carson?

1246
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:18,613
Well, he had rounded up
over 400 Navajo women,

1247
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:22,450
children and babies
into this cave,

1248
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:25,741
and his men bravely
and methodically

1249
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,284
shot them to death.

1250
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:32,247
What the white man calls
the spread of civilization,

1251
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:38,921
his Christianity, and so-called
democracy have a secret shadow.

1252
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,669
Greed and power.

1253
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,216
Look well into your own heart,
my brother.

1254
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:50,975
See how much of your violence
comes from the same lust

1255
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,972
for power over other people.

1256
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,185
<i>We've got names, we've got
dates and exact amounts</i>

1257
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,984
<i>and we're going to bring it
out in international court.</i>

1258
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:03,858
<i>A person could get killed
with foolish talk like that.</i>

1259
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,706
No!

1260
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,848
That worked pretty well.

1261
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,688
Which one do you think
goes next?

1262
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,191
Come on, try it.

1263
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,150
Let's try this one and see
what happens.

1264
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,943
No good sons of bitches.

1265
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,536
Oh my God.

1266
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:51,163
I don't know where she gets
the patience.

1267
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,042
You've gotta remember,
Carol, Danny has been

1268
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:58,458
in over 20 foster homes,
and he was even

1269
01:17:58,465 --> 01:17:59,455
put in solitary confinement

1270
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:02,379
in one of the detention homes
when he was 4 years old.

1271
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:05,970
He's never known anything but
brutality and rejection.

1272
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,759
I understand all that.

1273
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,382
But what can I do about it?

1274
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,885
Every single expert
told me he's hopeless.

1275
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:14,263
Honey, we can keep loving him
and loving him no matter

1276
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,479
what he does.

1277
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:17,598
But you've got to remember
he's going to have a hard time

1278
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:20,102
accepting that love
because he's gonna be afraid

1279
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,945
that it will be torn away like
everything else in his life.

1280
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,064
Because he's convinced
he's so evil.

1281
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:27,612
So we just can never never
get mad at him

1282
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,237
and more important we just
cannot give up loving him.

1283
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,908
Oh, I'm not going to give up.

1284
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,452
But what I want to know is,

1285
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,575
while we're doing
all this loving,

1286
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,247
who's supposed to be
loving us?

1287
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:38,585
I'll love you, honey.

1288
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:44,001
This school has no legal right
to detain the child.

1289
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,423
Now, if we have to find Danny's
parents and get them

1290
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:50,094
to regain custody we will,
and if that doesn't work,

1291
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,137
we'll have him committed
to a mental hospital.

1292
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,101
You'll do what?

1293
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:57,768
Any attempt by your group, or
Posner's group, or any other

1294
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,938
makes to attack this school
through this child will be met

1295
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:02,811
by the finest lawyers
and the most widespread

1296
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,277
publicity that money can buy.

1297
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,488
You're just trying to get
back at us because we've

1298
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,029
exposed the filthy conditions
of your state hospitals.

1299
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:10,743
Why don't you go and clean them
up so they're fit

1300
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:11,781
for human beings?

1301
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,700
- You do that.
- We have evidence the child is

1302
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:17,792
unhappy here, and is constantly
going into fits of rage.

1303
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,127
Mister, you are <i>so</i> stupid
it's unreal.

1304
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,792
Harry. Harry, this
is not constructive.

1305
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,962
Now, it's clear that Jean is not
going to give up the child

1306
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:28,553
without a legal battle, so if
you want to see it through

1307
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,546
you're just going to have
to take her to court.

1308
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,218
Fair enough. It shouldn't be
too difficult to prove

1309
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,432
that this environment

1310
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,678
is too radical an environment
to bring up a young child in.

1311
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:40,307
What you men are really saying
is this constant harassment

1312
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,058
and this bugging
of our telephones,

1313
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,310
it will all magically stop
if we decide to give up

1314
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,356
the Indian rights seminar.

1315
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:47,480
Oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry.

1316
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,153
I haven't any idea
what you're talking about.

1317
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,071
But I'm sure your phones
aren't tapped.

1318
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,322
That's illegal
without a court order.

1319
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,868
Would you go get bugger
and tell him to bring

1320
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,161
the machine in here, please?

1321
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,500
So you can just go back
and tell whoever sent you

1322
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:02,336
that they can just stop
bugging our phones

1323
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,876
because we can knock out
their bug anytime we want to.

1324
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,045
Is this phone
now being tapped?

1325
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,510
Oh, yes. With an infinity type

1326
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:12,175
that is picking up everything
being said in this room

1327
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:16,346
from this phone without you even
lifting up the phone receiver.

1328
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,560
So, whenever we want to talk
without anyone else

1329
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:21,147
listening in, we just
call on Bugger.

1330
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,311
Bugger, hit the switch.

1331
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:27,027
You didn't turn
this thing off, did you?

1332
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,738
- Turn off what?
- I don't know, it's weird.

1333
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:31,608
It's gone blank,
I can't hear anything.

1334
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:35,703
Well, check your relays.

1335
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:38,539
Mr. Posner, allegations have
been made that the

1336
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,785
$80 million trust that was given
to you by the Indian Bureau

1337
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,709
for the land sale was turned
over to you as trustee,

1338
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:47,377
instead of the bank
in Wyoming, and this is

1339
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:50,376
because of your heavy campaign
contributions in Washington.

1340
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,424
Look, that's ridiculous.

1341
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:55,389
I'm not even aware
of what campaign contributions

1342
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,258
my executive committee
decides to make.

1343
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,055
But I do know

1344
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:01,555
that they are made
on a strictly impartial basis.

1345
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:04,057
You mean you have no friends
at all in Washington?

1346
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,479
I mean, there isn't anybody
up there--

1347
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:06,396
Well, certainly I--

1348
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,235
Or any heavy campaign
contributions?

1349
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:11,776
Certainly I have friends
in Washington. Don't you?

1350
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:14,572
Now, what can I do
for you, princess?

1351
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,240
Aren't you responsible
for helping Eisenhower

1352
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,456
back in the '50s

1353
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,248
effect the transfer
of Indian trust money

1354
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,916
to local banks here and
throughout the state

1355
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:30,292
so that you could, uh, invest it
at a great personal profit?

1356
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:34,296
Ah, well, that was quite
a long time ago but no, no,

1357
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,092
that's not true.
Absolutely not.

1358
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,933
What does it say?
What does it say?

1359
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:41,268
Basically, it says the man
is lying through his teeth.

1360
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:48,234
What's that ticking?

1361
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:54,782
I'm picking up a strange ticking
sound from the transmitter.

1362
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:57,493
What's it sound like?

1363
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:23,803
The governor's putting
the town under martial law.

1364
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:27,808
The town? Why the hell isn't he
out here protecting the school?

1365
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:30,810
Something about fearing the kids
coming in and retaliating.

1366
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:34,610
Oh, bull. That jackass would do
anything for publicity.

1367
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:41,572
Well, as long as the laws
work one way for the rich

1368
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:43,323
and one way
for the rest of us,

1369
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,495
looks like there's only one
thing left for us to do.

1370
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,709
Go in at nighttime and bomb
the hell out of them.

1371
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,836
The police won't help us,
we know that.

1372
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:54,675
And we also know that our
nonviolence

1373
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,009
just gets us stomped on.

1374
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:59,176
The only thing those racist pigs
will ever understand is terror.

1375
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,091
Wait a minute, Jocelyn.

1376
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:03,513
Why don't you quit using race
as an excuse

1377
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,181
for your own neurosis.

1378
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:08,022
I don't think
all these marches and protests

1379
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,392
and demonstrations
accomplish anything.

1380
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:13,019
Oh yeah, well, look
at Wounded Knee.

1381
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,021
Well, look at Wounded Knee.
What was accomplished?

1382
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:15,646
Plenty.

1383
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,239
Frightened middle-class
people who see

1384
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,700
things changing so fast
around them, just when they are

1385
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,785
becoming humane and beginning
to see

1386
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:23,370
that there is an injustice,

1387
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:25,910
they see violent demonstrations
and flee like hell right back

1388
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,876
to where the politicians
want them.

1389
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:32,247
She's exactly right.

1390
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:35,545
Why don't we come up with
something different?

1391
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,714
Something that we really want
to show the people in town

1392
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,382
we're not monsters
and we don't go around

1393
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:40,971
clubbing people
and throwing bombs.

1394
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,715
Michelle, come on.

1395
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,558
King tried that approach and
tell me where is he today?

1396
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:47,223
Oh, come on. Come on.

1397
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:48,938
That's beside the point
and you know it.

1398
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,103
The hell it is.
I'm right on the point.

1399
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:53,567
Where's everything he's done,
or anybody else for that matter?

1400
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:57,063
They blew it off like they
blew off his head.

1401
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,156
To go in and bomb now is not
acting,

1402
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,900
it's reacting
to what they've done to us.

1403
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,618
And the guy who's making
you react

1404
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,237
is in fact controlling you.

1405
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:06,740
I agree with Michelle.
Instead of reacting to them,

1406
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:11,085
why don't we just once go in
and do what's good for us?

1407
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:13,420
I'd like to add something
to that if I might.

1408
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:15,585
Would you like to come up here
and speak, Jean?

1409
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:20,177
Come on.

1410
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,969
I thought we were supposed
to make our own decisions.

1411
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,014
Come on. All this ruckus isn't
getting you anywhere.

1412
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,012
But doesn't she have a say so
just like you do

1413
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,434
and she and she and she?

1414
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,524
Yeah, say so, say so, but she
knows she's gonna get up,

1415
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:36,986
and make a speech that
everybody

1416
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,445
in this room is going
to follow blindly.

1417
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:40,940
That's right.

1418
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:52,459
I don't gotta tell you.
Now, look, either we decide

1419
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,624
or Big Mama over there
decides for us.

1420
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,963
Joanne. Joanne.

1421
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:58,833
Big Mama doesn't want
to tell you what to do,

1422
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:01,461
she just has some thoughts
she'd like to give.

1423
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:06,674
It's a crisis right now

1424
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:08,471
and you're trying to tell
us what to do?

1425
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:11,971
That violates everything that
you've taught us to believe.

1426
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:18,144
Here we go again.
Here we go again.

1427
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,323
Well, it's about time.

1428
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:33,542
My God, at least someone's
got common sense.

1429
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,831
What do you mean?

1430
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,421
Stopping these riots
before they start.

1431
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:40,257
Thank God at least we've got
a governor with guts.

1432
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,092
Aw, come on, Blue Elk.

1433
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,006
We came all the way up here
just to see Billy.

1434
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:45,425
Well, I can't help that.

1435
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:46,843
You can't see him now.

1436
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,841
This is a gathering
of medicine men.

1437
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:51,184
Some of them are using
smoke from religious herbs

1438
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:52,804
and others are purifying
themselves

1439
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,350
for Billy's sacred journey.

1440
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,940
This whole mountain is closed.

1441
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,183
You mean they purify
themselves just to take drugs?

1442
01:25:58,195 --> 01:25:59,856
No, no, only some do.

1443
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:01,524
And for them the smoke
of the medicine

1444
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:02,862
is a divine spirit.

1445
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,823
If one is not totally prepared
to meet him,

1446
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,567
if one has not fasted,

1447
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:10,367
or purified oneself thoroughly,
or if outsiders interfere,

1448
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:13,366
the spirit would be angry
and make Billy sick,

1449
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:15,209
or even take him away.

1450
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:16,702
Like when a kid is spaced?

1451
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,875
- Off in stony land?
- No, no.

1452
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,214
You people don't know anything
about the other world

1453
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:24,381
or about the power that can
so easily kill you.

1454
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:25,674
So when like fools
you take drugs

1455
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:29,049
for kicks or to get high,
you run a great danger.

1456
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:31,471
And when something happens,
all you can talk about

1457
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:34,061
is mental illness, or you
describe it as suicide.

1458
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:35,225
Come on, Blue Elk.

1459
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,893
We know all that.
But when can we see him?

1460
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,891
Tomorrow morning. Maybe.

1461
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:41,064
But you're going to have to wait
half way down the mountain.

1462
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:43,028
- Now leave.
- All right, you guys. Come on.

1463
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:12,926
You are going to descend
to the cave of the dead,

1464
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,098
where our people
were massacred.

1465
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:19,019
Be very careful, because there
are many spirits there

1466
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,107
who would like to take
you with them.

1467
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:24,445
And others who do not want
to pass on to the next world,

1468
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:28,112
so they would like to enter
and possess your body.

1469
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:31,486
The souls of these dead wreak
for vengeance

1470
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,988
and they will
know your heart.

1471
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:37,867
If it is that of a white man,
you will not survive.

1472
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:39,619
I am ready, Grandfather.

1473
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,540
There will be demons also.

1474
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:45,792
If you show any fear,
they will tear you to pieces

1475
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:49,170
and the ghosts will possess
your soul.

1476
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:52,640
If you show you are not afraid
no matter what they do,

1477
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:55,225
the demons will stop
terrifying you

1478
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:59,142
and become your friends.
Are you afraid?

1479
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:01,015
You once taught
me that courage

1480
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,142
is not the absence of fear,

1481
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:06,396
Grandfather, but the conquest
of it. I am ready.

1482
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:10,149
Beware most of all
the red-eyed demon.

1483
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,652
By his screams
you will know him.

1484
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:15,324
He is the most powerful
of all the demons

1485
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:19,326
and because you will do
much good if you survive,

1486
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:23,500
he will kill you on the spot
if you show any fear.

1487
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:24,997
Good luck.

1488
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:54,027
No cobras live
in this country, my friend.

1489
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,527
I know who you are
and I'm afraid

1490
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:57,780
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

1491
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,327
I've got to go
down the tunnel.

1492
01:32:57,781 --> 01:32:59,317
You're me.

1493
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:03,318
I am loweklow.
Your inner self.

1494
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:09,998
Someday, when you fully accept
your fate and your death,

1495
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:13,210
then you will have me
as your inner guide,

1496
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:16,456
but for now, you are to go
to the desert

1497
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:18,798
and learn from the maiden.

1498
01:33:18,802 --> 01:33:22,170
I'm sorry,
I just can't understand

1499
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,796
all that's happening here.

1500
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:25,468
But that's your trouble.

1501
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:27,386
You always try to think
and understand

1502
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:28,883
everything with your head

1503
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:31,637
instead of just feeling it
with your heart.

1504
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:36,108
Now go and just experience
what the maiden offers you.

1505
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:45,109
Billy Jack, over here.

1506
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:50,822
Now who are you?

1507
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:53,326
And where are we?

1508
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:57,500
I am here to show you the way
to the house of the great one.

1509
01:33:57,507 --> 01:34:00,340
But first you must prove
yourself generous of heart.

1510
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:03,005
All right. I'm ready.

1511
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:05,845
Go and slap him in the face

1512
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:08,511
and no matter what he does,
do not strike back.

1513
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,723
And no matter what he does,
I'm not to hit him back?

1514
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:16,348
That's right.

1515
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:21,020
Run, get going, run there.

1516
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:25,399
Go, go.

1517
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,027
I've got a little bet.

1518
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:30,028
No way.

1519
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:48,881
I don't think you're going
to particularly like this.

1520
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,847
Why, you stupid son of a--

1521
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:03,938
That man was
on the lowest level

1522
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,565
and reacts only
with animal instinct.

1523
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:07,987
Treated with violence,

1524
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:11,282
he was immediately pulled down
to the violent animal level.

1525
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,451
No better than the man
that hit him.

1526
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:16,291
And so he ends up being
controlled by the animal

1527
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,877
in the man who hit him.

1528
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,790
Hit another.

1529
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:21,379
War of honor is something
that went out

1530
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:22,622
in the Middle Ages.

1531
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:26,093
War today is nothing but
economic gain, economic gain

1532
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:29,133
for a few individuals
in this country who control

1533
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:32,849
the top, top companies
in this country.

1534
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:36,265
These companies go all the way
to soft drink manufacturers,

1535
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,809
all the way
to prepackaged foods.

1536
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:40,773
EXCUSE me a moment.

1537
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:43,018
This is gonna seem as stupid
to you probably

1538
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:44,645
as it does to me, but--

1539
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:07,546
He was on the second level.

1540
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:10,966
He could not be pulled down
to the level of the brute beast

1541
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:13,466
acting on physical violence,

1542
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:16,218
but was easily pulled
away from what he was doing

1543
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:18,061
and lost control
of his own center.

1544
01:36:18,064 --> 01:36:20,396
So he too did not own
his own soul,

1545
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,392
but could quickly be
controlled by another.

1546
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:25,144
Once again.

1547
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:40,458
Forgive me, I have no idea
why I am doing this.

1548
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,333
I feel sorry for you.

1549
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:50,005
Only a child thinks that being
a man

1550
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:52,095
is being tough and violent.

1551
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,260
Someday you may learn
that being a man has to do

1552
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:55,974
with self-discipline over
one's time

1553
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:59,470
and one's emotion with a deep
and...

1554
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,848
compassionate understanding
for other people's feelings.

1555
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,831
This man has reached
the third level

1556
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,871
where he is his own person,

1557
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:23,960
so that no man can
force him to react,

1558
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:27,126
thereby control his actions or
take anything away from him.

1559
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:29,545
But what about
the fourth level?

1560
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:31,759
Who told you
of the fourth level?

1561
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:33,720
I don't know, nobody told me
about the fourth level,

1562
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:36,431
it just kind of popped
into my head, that's all.

1563
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:38,596
Look, can I go
to my spiritual guide now?

1564
01:37:38,603 --> 01:37:40,890
You may never go to him.

1565
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:42,604
He comes when he wills.

1566
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,644
And of yet, you are not ready.

1567
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:45,765
So why not?

1568
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:47,688
I thought I just conquered
my demon.

1569
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,232
You just met him, and learned
that your own

1570
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,729
worst demon is yourself.

1571
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:57,076
Your task now is to come
to thoroughly know

1572
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,912
your shadow and accept it,

1573
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:02,829
and by accepting your weaknesses
and human frailties.

1574
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:05,953
When your shadow
has become your friend,

1575
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,250
then your spiritual guide
will come for you,

1576
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:12,046
and only then
will you be ready.

1577
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:38,402
Grandfather. How is
all of this happening to me?

1578
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:08,481
I tried to get them to go wait
down the mountain, Billy,

1579
01:39:08,484 --> 01:39:10,191
but they insisted
on seeing you.

1580
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:12,151
That's all right.
We can talk on the way down.

1581
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:15,613
Look, we're worried
because the kids at the school

1582
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,027
are just going to forget
the whole thing

1583
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:20,197
and go off on one of their
nonviolent love kicks again.

1584
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:22,662
And all that will happen
is we'll get bombed again

1585
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:24,326
and more of our kids
will get killed.

1586
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,494
Yeah, look, Billy.

1587
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:26,582
There's a whole group of us.

1588
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:27,917
Billy, we'd like you
to lead us in.

1589
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,536
You know, hit them
with a counterattack.

1590
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:33,666
We could go in at night and bomb
their TV station for a change

1591
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,838
or kidnap somebody
from the town.

1592
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:38,007
Fight back.

1593
01:39:38,014 --> 01:39:41,382
Look, being strong is one thing,
but bombing is another.

1594
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:43,178
Why, because it's not open?

1595
01:39:43,186 --> 01:39:45,678
No, because it's the act
of a sick coward.

1596
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:48,225
So what the hell are we
supposed to do?

1597
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:49,893
Just roll over and play dead?

1598
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:51,141
Yeah, Billy, how much
can we take?

1599
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:53,234
Look, if I were a kid
in the barrio

1600
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:54,853
or the ghetto today,

1601
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:56,571
and I had to grow up seeing
my parents

1602
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,064
every clay out of work

1603
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:00,191
or else lucky to get
a two-hour

1604
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:02,911
bus ride into the city
so they can make a few dollars

1605
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:04,905
cleaning up
the white man's filth

1606
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:08,250
and then return only to be
insulted by the landlords,

1607
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,913
the teachers and the police--

1608
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,878
The police?
They're so damn corrupt.

1609
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:14,839
I know they are, and I sure
as hell would be

1610
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:17,254
tempted to go off and do things
that would make

1611
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:20,549
the fanatic radicals
look like kindergarten kids.

1612
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:22,718
Well then, come on,
let's do it.

1613
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:23,886
Nothing else we can do.

1614
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:25,258
Does that mean you're going
to lead us

1615
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:26,430
in to bomb them back?

1616
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,553
- Yeah, come on, Billy.
- No, not in a million years.

1617
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:30,396
Why not, Billy?

1618
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:32,265
Because that kind of violence
never helps anybody

1619
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:33,858
or liberates anybody.

1620
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,522
It just gives some psychotic

1621
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,396
who's filled with a lot
of self-hatred

1622
01:40:37,406 --> 01:40:40,114
an excuse to kill a lot
of innocent bystanders

1623
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:42,108
and maybe grab a lot
of headlines

1624
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:44,201
by spouting
some sophomoric slogans

1625
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:46,116
about class struggle.

1626
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:48,490
And the end result
of the whole thing is it gives

1627
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:50,367
the law and order mentalities
like Posner

1628
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,915
a chance to grab even
more power.

1629
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:55,414
As far as what's going on
back at the school

1630
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,166
I think you kids
are just gonna have to go back

1631
01:40:58,177 --> 01:40:59,793
and decide all that
for yourselves.

1632
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,654
What the hell is that?

1633
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:31,499
I don't know, sir.
Sounds like drums.

1634
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:34,210
Lieutenant, you better put
the men out on alert.

1635
01:41:34,213 --> 01:41:36,625
Sergeant, go out and see
what the noise is.

1636
01:41:45,141 --> 01:41:47,132
Hey, colonel.

1637
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:49,510
Maybe your revolution is gonna
come limping in here

1638
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,932
with a musket, fife and drum.

1639
01:42:14,587 --> 01:42:18,125
Lieutenant, I don't think
you're gonna believe this.

1640
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:24,043
Come one, come all

1641
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:27,889
to the world's first
total man meet in history.

1642
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:31,556
<i>Howard Case“, where are you'?</i>

1643
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,678
Each team has a poetry team,

1644
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:36,681
a belly dance team,
a rock band,

1645
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:40,356
a sprinter, a pole vaulter
and a relay team.

1646
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:44,072
No prizes, no awards,
and no politics.

1647
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:47,067
Just the fun of competing.

1648
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:50,036
Anyone can form a team
and join in.

1649
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:54,249
Man is both body and soul,
and physical and spiritual,

1650
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:58,495
so come to the first
total man meet in history.

1651
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:05,464
Hey, colonel. These radical
demonstrations

1652
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:07,212
can be awfully dangerous.

1653
01:43:07,223 --> 01:43:10,090
Think you and your men
can handle this one?

1654
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:12,593
Lieutenant, escort them.

1655
01:43:15,981 --> 01:43:18,643
Attention all units,
attention all units.

1656
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:20,107
Be on the alert.

1657
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:22,603
This could be a clever
diversionary tactic.

1658
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:25,731
All right, Carl,
knock it off.

1659
01:43:32,415 --> 01:43:35,157
It's no use, the wheel is just
getting deeper and deeper.

1660
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:36,828
Have you got
the tow truck yet?

1661
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:39,123
Hey, Jerry?

1662
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,712
I've already called
the tow truck

1663
01:43:40,715 --> 01:43:43,127
and they can't come out
until morning.

1664
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:44,295
Send another bus.

1665
01:43:45,928 --> 01:43:47,589
Oh, wait a minute.

1666
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:49,758
I think maybe there's
help coming.

1667
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:54,596
Yeah, someone's on their way.

1668
01:43:54,603 --> 01:43:56,765
Russell, that's not help.

1669
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,605
Jerry? Jerry?
Something funny's going on.

1670
01:43:59,608 --> 01:44:00,939
Call the sheriff.

1671
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,198
Well well well.

1672
01:44:12,204 --> 01:44:15,162
If it ain't our candle waving
culture group.

1673
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:18,784
Looks like you've got
a little problem here, huh?

1674
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:22,503
Well, I tell you, while you're
waiting for help, we'll, uh,

1675
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:24,668
we'll provide you
with a little culture, okay?

1676
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:26,632
Give me one of them violins.

1677
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:31,637
That is a guitar, stupid.

1678
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:37,931
They still can't find
the sheriff

1679
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,474
and Billy's on his way.

1680
01:44:39,482 --> 01:44:40,972
Tell him to keep trying.

1681
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:43,020
Try the state police.

1682
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:52,985
Well, lookie here.

1683
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:54,827
Really big man,
Jason, aren't you?

1684
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:03,003
Fellows, we can't fight
and we're not interested in--

1685
01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:05,042
Just tell us what you want.

1686
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:34,942
Look, now, you've had your fun

1687
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,536
and you've really damaged
our bus.

1688
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:39,406
Now, you don't need
to burn it too.

1689
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:41,657
Please, don't burn our bus.

1690
01:46:18,497 --> 01:46:21,831
Oh, my my my, huh?

1691
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:24,952
You boys out for a little fun
and games?

1692
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:27,294
You just decide,
it's Saturday night,

1693
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:29,460
roll a bus over or two, huh?

1694
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:31,582
Well, it's something to do.

1695
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:34,928
Yeah, it beats going
to church, doesn't it?

1696
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,967
Well, yeah. Yeah.

1697
01:46:40,477 --> 01:46:43,469
Oh, man.

1698
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,312
He's a big one, Jas.

1699
01:46:45,316 --> 01:46:47,978
<i>_</i> 6.9“_
<i>_</i> 6.9.-_

1700
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:50,977
Really? How much do you weigh,

1701
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:54,481
about 265 pounds?

1702
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:58,985
- No, 285.
- 285.

1703
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:01,033
Two hundred
and eighty five pounds?

1704
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,077
- Right.
- Jason, I didn't think

1705
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,494
you guys piled it that high

1706
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:06,412
down here in your part
of the county, huh?

1707
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:12,128
Well, you know the funny thing
about being so big though

1708
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:13,750
is that a little girl,
like this

1709
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:16,173
luscious little
belly dancer here,

1710
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:20,299
she could take you right off
at the knees just like that.

1711
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:22,471
What's she going to use,
a buzz saw?

1712
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:25,641
No. She wouldn't use
a buzz saw. Just her knee.

1713
01:47:25,648 --> 01:47:29,107
Her knee? She couldn't even
get her knee up high enough.

1714
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:35,025
She doesn't have to kick you
in the family jewels.

1715
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:38,525
What she would do is...

1716
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:40,651
right down there
inside the thigh.

1717
01:47:40,663 --> 01:47:42,324
Oh, I'm sure.

1718
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:46,871
And you know, not only that,
but if she did it right,

1719
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:49,539
you would not only go
down like a bomb,

1720
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:51,537
but she might even tear
that muscle

1721
01:47:51,548 --> 01:47:53,334
all the way
down under the kneecap.

1722
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:55,754
You might even
have to have surgery.

1723
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:58,219
Indian, you're full
of karate crap, you know that?

1724
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:03,716
Well, I knew he was going
to say that.

1725
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:07,937
I just knew you were
going to say that.

1726
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:13,401
And I suppose that means that
I will have to say to you

1727
01:48:13,404 --> 01:48:15,020
that I will have
to show you, right?

1728
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:18,364
Be my guest.

1729
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:20,278
And I suppose that's all right
with you, isn't it, Jason?

1730
01:48:20,285 --> 01:48:21,696
Good luck.

1731
01:48:21,704 --> 01:48:22,910
That's one thing about you,

1732
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:25,280
you've always had such
a generous heart, Jason.

1733
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:27,281
You don't mind at all that I--

1734
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:28,953
- Go right ahead.
- ...take him on, or--

1735
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:31,794
- Sure.
- Wonderful fellow,

1736
01:48:31,797 --> 01:48:34,004
wonderful fellow.

1737
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,090
Well,

1738
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:39,757
you can't say that I didn't
warn you. Right?

1739
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:41,549
- Right.
- And you can't say

1740
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:42,422
that I didn't warn you?

1741
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:44,470
- No, no.
- Is he a valuable man?

1742
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:47,264
- Ahh.
- So-so. So-so?

1743
01:48:47,271 --> 01:48:48,978
That's all you are?

1744
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:51,222
Well, in any event,
you can't say

1745
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:53,019
that I didn't
warn you, right?

1746
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:57,774
Now I suppose we're down
to that time when there's

1747
01:48:57,781 --> 01:49:01,649
really nothing left to do
but show you, is there?

1748
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:03,367
Be my guest.

1749
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,425
Joanne, what do you think
you're doing?

1750
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:25,173
Getting even.

1751
01:49:25,184 --> 01:49:26,470
What do you mean
getting even?

1752
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,263
This just pulls you
down to their level.

1753
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,602
Well, what the hell do you
call what you just did?

1754
01:49:30,606 --> 01:49:32,438
Come on, Billy.

1755
01:49:32,441 --> 01:49:35,809
Come on, you can debate
your visions later.

1756
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:40,772
Law association wants to know

1757
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:42,444
if you want to open
the legal seminar,

1758
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:43,782
- or speak last.
- Last.

1759
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:45,697
After everyone else
has gone home.

1760
01:49:45,704 --> 01:49:46,944
What's the matter?

1761
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:50,073
Look who they said
would never leave his room.

1762
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:56,078
Danny thinks he might like
to have that thing now,

1763
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:57,125
wouldn't you, Danny?

1764
01:49:57,132 --> 01:49:58,793
What thing?

1765
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:02,294
The thing that will help
his arm grab onto things.

1766
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:04,966
How in the world did you
ever do it?

1767
01:50:04,973 --> 01:50:08,307
Okay, almost. But you've
got to put this here,

1768
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:09,300
right like that.

1769
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:11,177
- I'll never learn.
- Yeah, you will.

1770
01:50:11,188 --> 01:50:12,474
And you'll sing up on
the platform

1771
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,722
- like the rest of the kids.
- I'd be so embarrassed.

1772
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:16,474
Will I really get
to play up there?

1773
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:18,226
Yeah, but you've gotta
work hard, okay? Ready?

1774
01:50:18,237 --> 01:50:19,648
- Really?
- Yeah, okay.

1775
01:50:19,655 --> 01:50:21,362
♪ I saw three ships
come sailing in ♪

1776

Do you mean he's actually
talking now?

1777
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,317
Yeah. With Carol he's become
a regular chatterbox.

1778
01:50:26,328 --> 01:50:28,535
That's beautiful.

1782
01:51:16,962 --> 01:51:18,748
Well, Jean, I hope this is
going to end

1783
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:20,712
your Indian
Legal Rights seminar.

1784
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:23,128
I know, I know.

1785
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:25,467
Not a mark on him and death
by accidental drowning.

1786
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:26,926
Well, what the hell
did you expect?

1787
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:30,889
Yeah, a sign?
Courtesy of W. A. Posner

1788
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:33,726
and his friends from the CIA?

1789
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:38,724
The mass confusion over really
what are the Indian rights

1790
01:51:38,734 --> 01:51:41,817
makes it impossible
for even Indian lawyers

1791
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:46,405
to grasp the laws that are
mostly aimed at depriving him

1792
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,649
of 13 million acres

1793
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:51,652
of prime real estate
in the United States.

1794
01:51:51,663 --> 01:51:55,452
Let us now look closely
at how these committees

1795
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:57,621
control the entire Congress

1796
01:51:57,628 --> 01:52:02,498
and the entire spending,
so that 220 million people

1797
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:05,670
are totally controlled
by the votes of 4 or 5 men.

1798
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,839
The traders are given
a complete monopoly

1799
01:52:07,846 --> 01:52:09,462
on the reservation
by the Bureau.

1800
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:12,966
Prices are inflated, sometimes
as much as a thousand percent.

1801
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:15,843
And when the little money that
these people have is gone,

1802
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:18,141
the traders extend credit
to them at interest rates

1803
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:21,186
usually falling between
48-75 percent annually.

1804
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:25,778
And the BIA parading
their sell-out Indians around

1805
01:52:25,781 --> 01:52:27,522
before the public
as a camouflage,

1806
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:30,820
refuse to throw the traders
off the reservation

1807
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:34,445
or to even regulate
or in any way control them.

1808
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:36,288
Can you tell me why?

1809
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:38,953
The only possible reason
must be kickbacks,

1810
01:52:38,961 --> 01:52:41,123
tied in
with the First National Bank

1811
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:42,619
and Mr. Posner's trust funds.

1812
01:52:42,631 --> 01:52:45,840
These again regulated
by the BIA.

1813
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:47,424
And the people that are going
to be the ones

1814
01:52:47,427 --> 01:52:49,338
that are suffering
are my people.

1815
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:51,553
People that are
on the grass roots level.

1816
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:53,513
Not the tribal councilmen.

1817
01:52:53,517 --> 01:52:55,258
Not the fat tribal councilmen
with their...

1818
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:57,977
government or tribal cars.
Not them.

1819
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:00,142
And for years since I was
a little girl

1820
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:04,142
I've seen this go on
amongst our own people.

1821
01:53:04,152 --> 01:53:06,519
Graft and corruption.

1822
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:11,491
I call you brother, but I have
my hand in your pocket.

1823
01:53:11,493 --> 01:53:13,154
She calls me sister.

1824
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:16,404
She has a knife in my back.

1825
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:18,497
We talk about unity.

1826
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:22,710
Unity in the world,
in the government?

1827
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:25,000
Better start at home.
Charity begins at home.

1828
01:53:26,341 --> 01:53:30,209
And so in closing, please
let us try and remember

1829
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:33,758
the overwhelming despair
gnawing at every Indian

1830
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:37,053
and every other person
in the United States

1831
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,516
knowing that there
is no longer

1832
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:43,060
any way he can directly affect
the destiny of his country,

1833
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:47,105
and therefore, he can no longer
control his own life.

1834
01:53:47,112 --> 01:53:50,070
You know, it's hard to believe
that this country,

1835
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:53,361
which was started
in a small corner of Virginia,

1836
01:53:53,368 --> 01:53:56,736
where even though
the population was very small,

1837
01:53:56,747 --> 01:53:59,785
God created
such incredible people

1838
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:04,957
as James Monroe, James Madison,
George Washington,

1839
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:09,753
Patrick Henry, George Wythe,
Peyton Randolph,

1840
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:14,220
George Mason, the unbelievable
Thomas Jefferson

1841
01:54:14,222 --> 01:54:16,589
and many, many others.

1842
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:17,965
The question now is

1843
01:54:19,144 --> 01:54:21,932
whether that incredible spirit
of those men

1844
01:54:21,938 --> 01:54:26,102
which created this country
is to be completely obliterated

1845
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:28,567
by the greed and corruption
which exists

1846
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:31,312
at every conceivable
political level

1847
01:54:31,323 --> 01:54:34,441
from the White House
to the teeniest trading post

1848
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:36,283
on the Indian reservation.

1849
01:54:36,661 --> 01:54:41,406
Do you know that one word,
just one word could change

1850
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:45,455
the entire course of the
American Indian legal destiny

1851
01:54:45,462 --> 01:54:49,000
and thereby change the destiny
for all of us here?

1852
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:51,419
And that is the word "honest.“

1853
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:54,092
That one word could change
this government

1854
01:54:54,096 --> 01:54:55,257
and special interest groups

1855
01:54:55,263 --> 01:55:00,133
back to the spirit of Thomas
Jefferson and Patrick Henry.

1856
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:03,261
Which is of government
of the people.

1857
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:07,515
Jefferson summed it all up
in one phrase.

1858
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:12,236
"The entire art of government
is being honest.“

1859
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:19,489
To those of you who make
peaceful evolution impossible,

1860
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:21,612
it is you and only you

1861
01:55:21,623 --> 01:55:25,457
that will make
violent revolution inevitable.

1862
01:55:26,628 --> 01:55:28,619
Thank you.

1863
01:55:33,552 --> 01:55:35,543
A conservator is like
a guardian, young lady.

1864
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:38,046
If you hit me, you'll be
in contempt of court.

1865
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:41,174
I'll do it, I swear to you
I'll do it, now get out.

1866
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,800
I'm taking the child.

1867
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:45,098
No, you're not.

1868
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:53,398
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

1869
01:55:53,405 --> 01:55:56,318
I haven't discharged
this patient yet.

1870
01:55:56,324 --> 01:55:58,486
We petitioned the court
to name me as conservator.

1871
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:05,160
Normally, I am a peaceful
man, Carl.

1872
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:08,205
But if he's not out of this room
by the time I turn around

1873
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:11,203
I'm throwing this vile,
decaying dung heap

1874
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:12,579
right through that window.

1875
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:15,174
Now you get him the hell
out of here.

1876
01:56:15,177 --> 01:56:17,544
Until the court does appoint
you conservator,

1877
01:56:17,554 --> 01:56:19,511
this is illegal, Harry,
and you know it.

1878
01:56:19,514 --> 01:56:21,721
Now come on. Let's go down
the hall and talk this over.

1879
01:56:23,351 --> 01:56:25,058
Now, don't you worry, honey.

1880
01:56:25,061 --> 01:56:27,098
We're gonna get him back
to the school. All right?

1881
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:28,391
Phew.

1882
01:56:37,574 --> 01:56:40,862
They're coming
to arrest Grandfather.

1883
01:56:43,622 --> 01:56:48,958
All right, Cole, what's
this warrant for?

1884
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,746
You're not going to take him
in, Cole.

1885
01:56:50,754 --> 01:56:53,587
Cole, I don't believe this.
This is absurd.

1886
01:56:53,590 --> 01:56:55,627
Absolutely absurd.

1887
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:58,547
Grandfather would never
accept lease money.

1888
01:56:58,553 --> 01:57:00,260
Yellow Hawk is behind this.

1889
01:57:00,263 --> 01:57:02,721
Obviously that's a frame up,

1890
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:04,761
but just as obviously
you can beat it.

1891
01:57:04,768 --> 01:57:07,806
Unless someone else does
something stupid.

1892
01:57:07,812 --> 01:57:11,225
He's right.

1893
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:12,598
Come on, Grandfather.

1894
01:57:12,609 --> 01:57:14,020
I'll go in with you.

1895
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:24,485
Hey, Blue Elk.

1896
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:26,112
It's me, Jas.

1897
01:57:26,122 --> 01:57:28,739
Got a minute?

1898
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,332
What's up?

1899
01:57:30,335 --> 01:57:32,622
Well, uh, they asked me
to come out here and see if

1900
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:35,087
maybe you want to come in
for a little private talk.

1901
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:37,127
Maybe we can do something
about the old man.

1902
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:38,248
Who's they?

1903
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:41,173
They just, uh, told us
to come out here

1904
01:57:41,179 --> 01:57:42,795
and see if you would be
interested in a deal.

1905
01:57:42,806 --> 01:57:47,266
That's all. They just want us
to come get you.

1906
01:57:47,269 --> 01:57:49,431
You wouldn't be playing
any games, would you?

1907
01:57:49,437 --> 01:57:51,474
Now look, if they'd
have wanted to hurt you,

1908
01:57:51,481 --> 01:57:53,813
they would have done it
a long time ago.

1909
01:57:53,817 --> 01:57:56,434
Yeah. What do you think?

1910
01:57:56,444 --> 01:57:59,436
Well, if it will help.

1911
01:57:59,447 --> 01:58:01,313
Yeah, why not?

1912
01:58:01,324 --> 01:58:02,780
Columbus took a chance,
didn't he?

1913
01:58:02,784 --> 01:58:05,572
There you go. And look
what happened to the Indians.

1914
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:12,828
Just go around the other side.

1915
01:58:19,676 --> 01:58:21,633
Hey. Hey!

1916
01:58:47,662 --> 01:58:49,198
Well, we worked him over

1917
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:51,742
then we worked him over again
but still no deal.

1918
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:53,661
- Well, where is he?
- He's out back.

1919
01:59:07,515 --> 01:59:10,007
Well now, what in the world
happened to you, Blue Elk?

1920
01:59:10,018 --> 01:59:12,601
What's the matter
with you, Posner?

1921
01:59:12,604 --> 01:59:15,392
I'm not one
of your drunken Indians.

1922
01:59:15,398 --> 01:59:19,187
Doing this to me is going
to create a lot of attention.

1923
01:59:19,194 --> 01:59:21,686
That's the general idea.

1924
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:27,358
In other words, Blue Elk,

1925
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:29,485
we're going to make an
example out of you.

1926
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:38,751
Ladies and gentlemen,

1927
01:59:39,673 --> 01:59:41,960
we got a special attraction
here tonight.

1928
01:59:42,884 --> 01:59:44,591
Our good friend Blue Elk
is going to do

1929
01:59:44,594 --> 01:59:47,757
an authentic Indian war dance
for you. Ain't you, boy?

1930
01:59:47,764 --> 01:59:50,096
A little music there, Maestro.

1931
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:52,558
Let's get out of here.

1932
01:59:56,398 --> 01:59:58,981
Give me that stick,
drummer boy.

1933
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:10,776
That damn Indian ain't gonna
dance, Jaycee.

1934
02:00:10,787 --> 02:00:14,621
Oh, he's gonna dance,
all right. Ain't you, boy?

1935
02:00:16,334 --> 02:00:19,998
You gonna dance,
ain't you, boy?

1936
02:00:20,004 --> 02:00:23,918
'Cause if you don't dance, son,
I'm gonna burn all the skin

1937
02:00:23,925 --> 02:00:26,166
off the bottom of your feet.

1938
02:01:04,174 --> 02:01:05,790
Use your head, Billy.

1939
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:08,132
I thought after the last time
you'd see

1940
02:01:08,136 --> 02:01:10,252
this creates problems,
it doesn't solve them.

1941
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:12,842
What about your vision,
you going to throw

1942
02:01:12,849 --> 02:01:14,339
that away again, too?

1943
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:16,466
Damn it, Billy, does somebody
else have to be killed

1944
02:01:16,478 --> 02:01:18,344
before you'll learn?

1945
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:20,470
Look. There is a human being
lying down there who also

1946
02:01:20,482 --> 02:01:22,348
happens to be my friend.
Now you tell me what do you

1947
02:01:22,358 --> 02:01:24,645
want me to do,
just leave him lie there?

1948
02:01:39,042 --> 02:01:41,704
Oh my God.

1949
02:01:44,339 --> 02:01:46,546
Come on, honey, this is insane.
Let's get out of here.

1950
02:01:46,549 --> 02:01:49,587
Why? It's time
they got theirs.

1951
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:51,881
I said now.

1952
02:01:51,888 --> 02:01:55,222
Mrs. Clure, how could you
do this?

1953
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:02,388
Dr. Alem, you're a dentist.
You took an oath.

1954
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:06,266
Don't you dare turn
away from me. Look at him.

1955
02:02:06,277 --> 02:02:08,985
How could you
possibly enjoy this?

1956
02:02:17,038 --> 02:02:18,995
What are you,
a bunch of animals?

1957
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:51,569
Aw, come on. You guys
aren't going to really use

1958
02:02:51,573 --> 02:02:52,938
all of these things now,
are you?

1959
02:02:52,949 --> 02:02:55,407
Try us.

1960
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:59,119
If you're giving me a choice,
I would just as soon

1961
02:02:59,122 --> 02:03:01,454
quietly walk out of here
and go on home.

1962
02:03:01,457 --> 02:03:03,824
Billy, stop it.

1963
02:03:03,835 --> 02:03:05,325
Somebody stop it.

1964
02:03:05,336 --> 02:03:08,624
What are you, insane?

1965
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:11,373
All we want to do is take
our friend Blue Elk

1966
02:03:11,384 --> 02:03:12,966
and quietly walk out of here.

1967
02:03:12,969 --> 02:03:14,960
Not this time, Billy.

1968
02:03:14,971 --> 02:03:16,757
Oh, Posner.
For God's sakes.

1969
02:03:16,764 --> 02:03:20,132
There are witnesses.
Hundreds of them.

1970
02:03:20,143 --> 02:03:22,760
He's not walking out of here.

1971
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:25,102
Well, if that's the way it's
going to be, buster,

1972
02:03:25,106 --> 02:03:26,972
you're going to have to
club me down first,

1973
02:03:26,983 --> 02:03:28,519
are you ready to do that?

1974
02:03:28,526 --> 02:03:31,018
If I have to.

1975
02:03:31,029 --> 02:03:33,487
Damn you.

1976
02:03:36,618 --> 02:03:39,656
Somebody get the police
and hurry.

1977
02:03:41,164 --> 02:03:43,451
Just your feet
against all of this?

1978
02:03:43,458 --> 02:03:48,294
Well, looks like we're just
going to have to improvise.

1979
02:03:50,214 --> 02:03:53,457
You know, I don't remember who
it was, but somebody one time

1980
02:03:53,468 --> 02:03:57,632
told me that if there's
absolutely no way that you can

1981
02:03:57,639 --> 02:04:00,097
get out of taking a terrible
beating,

1982
02:04:00,099 --> 02:04:01,715
the only intelligent thing
for you to do

1983
02:04:01,726 --> 02:04:04,434
is to try to get in
the first lick.

1984
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:28,371
Get him.

1985
02:06:29,874 --> 02:06:31,785
I dislocated it.

1986
02:06:33,294 --> 02:06:35,956
Oh come on,
it's just separated.

1987
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:39,297
Quit bellowing like such
a baby, I'll set it for you.

1988
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:41,211
Bring it up.

1989
02:06:41,219 --> 02:06:43,085
This part's going to hurt you.

1990
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:52,644
Oh, Posner.

1991
02:06:55,691 --> 02:07:00,185
Look, up until now, it has been
just a couple of broken bones.

1992
02:07:00,196 --> 02:07:03,439
So why don't you put the gun
away, and back off.

1993
02:07:08,871 --> 02:07:11,238
Tell me something.

1994
02:07:11,249 --> 02:07:14,241
Were Posners all born
to be jackasses?

1995
02:07:14,252 --> 02:07:16,584
If you miss me, you're going
to hit one of your own men.

1996
02:07:16,587 --> 02:07:20,000
Please. I'm asking you nice,
if that will help.

1997
02:07:20,007 --> 02:07:24,376
Why don't you just put the gun
away let's quietly go on home.

1998
02:07:24,387 --> 02:07:27,550
I'm arresting you
for assault.

1999
02:07:29,851 --> 02:07:32,058
You have no right
to hold me here.

2000
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:34,268
I'm a free man.

2001
02:07:34,272 --> 02:07:35,683
I'm arresting you too.

2002
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:38,523
One false move
and I'll kill you.

2003
02:07:38,526 --> 02:07:40,233
By God, I'll kill you.

2004
02:07:40,236 --> 02:07:42,694
Han, don't.

2005
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:44,108
Please.

2006
02:07:44,115 --> 02:07:46,026
I'm begging you.

2007
02:07:46,033 --> 02:07:47,523
Don't think I'm kidding.

2008
02:08:38,336 --> 02:08:39,792
You satisfied?

2009
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:53,598
I'm taking you in, Billy.

2010
02:08:53,601 --> 02:08:56,764
No, I can't let you
do that, Cole.

2011
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:59,103
My God, man. When are you
going to stop being a fool?

2012
02:09:01,609 --> 02:09:03,099
If I let you take me in,

2013
02:09:03,110 --> 02:09:04,976
we both know that would be
a bullet in my head.

2014
02:09:04,987 --> 02:09:07,775
Not while I'm around.

2015
02:09:07,782 --> 02:09:10,774
Billy, I have to do this.

2016
02:09:10,785 --> 02:09:12,446
No, Cole. I'm not going to
let you take me.

2017
02:09:50,074 --> 02:09:51,405
It's a full-scale riot.

2018
02:09:51,409 --> 02:09:53,867
They want the Guard and the
standby federal troops.

2019
02:09:53,869 --> 02:09:55,530
Yeah, who's screaming
the loudest?

2020
02:09:55,538 --> 02:09:58,576
You want them
in alphabetical order?

2021
02:09:58,582 --> 02:10:00,164
I heard Posner's been killed.

2022
02:10:00,167 --> 02:10:01,703
Are you sure?

2023
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:02,997
Yes, sir.

2024
02:10:03,004 --> 02:10:04,369
How?

2025
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:07,213
Billy Jack.

2026
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:08,547
Well, get him.

2027
02:10:08,551 --> 02:10:09,882
I'm afraid we can't, sir.

2028
02:10:09,885 --> 02:10:11,876
The whole world saw it, it was
clearly self-defense.

2029
02:10:11,887 --> 02:10:14,003
I said arrest him.

2030
02:10:30,031 --> 02:10:31,237
Glad you got here, Colonel.

2031
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:33,948
You have no legal right
to be here.

2032
02:10:33,951 --> 02:10:36,067
Sorry, ma'am.

2033
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:37,193
We're taking our orders

2034
02:10:37,204 --> 02:10:38,820
directly from the governor's
the governor's office.

2035
02:10:38,831 --> 02:10:41,448
This show of force is just
going to fan reaction.

2036
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:43,041
Is that what you want?

2037
02:10:43,044 --> 02:10:44,580
Just what are your orders?

2038
02:10:45,004 --> 02:10:46,665
To stay in this position

2039
02:10:46,672 --> 02:10:48,629
until Billy Jack is placed
under arrest.

2040
02:10:57,892 --> 02:11:02,227
On top of everything else,
now it starts to rain.

2041
02:11:03,481 --> 02:11:05,222
I don't know, Billy.

2042
02:11:05,232 --> 02:11:07,473
Maybe I should have listened

2043
02:11:07,485 --> 02:11:09,647
and cut back on some
of those exposes.

2044
02:11:10,946 --> 02:11:12,903
You know what I think?

2045
02:11:12,907 --> 02:11:15,069
No, what?

2046
02:11:15,076 --> 02:11:17,738
I think that your refusal
to stop those exposes

2047
02:11:17,745 --> 02:11:21,454
and give advice is kind of
a cop out.

2048
02:11:21,457 --> 02:11:23,243
Just what do you mean by that?

2049
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:26,083
Well, by not ever giving
advice you don't ever have

2050
02:11:26,087 --> 02:11:29,079
the awesome responsibility
of someone following your advise

2051
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:30,797
and making a terrible mistake.

2052
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:33,087
Maybe getting hurt.

2053
02:11:33,094 --> 02:11:35,586
It's kind of a nice, safe way
to do it.

2054
02:11:35,596 --> 02:11:40,136
Are you accusing me of being
afraid of responsibility?

2055
02:11:40,142 --> 02:11:43,009
In some ways, yes.

2056
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:46,103
Why else didn't you speak up
about the exposes?

2057
02:11:46,107 --> 02:11:47,723
I mean, after Nixon resigned,

2058
02:11:47,733 --> 02:11:49,519
why didn't you do something
about it then?

2059
02:11:49,527 --> 02:11:52,815
Because I thought the kids
were doing the right thing.

2060
02:11:52,822 --> 02:11:54,859
Your trouble is that you think

2061
02:11:54,865 --> 02:11:56,981
everybody is pure of heart
and gives a damn.

2062
02:11:56,992 --> 02:11:58,824
What's that supposed to mean?

2063
02:11:58,828 --> 02:12:02,116
Well, you think that all
you have to do is bring

2064
02:12:02,123 --> 02:12:03,784
all these injustices
out in the open

2065
02:12:03,791 --> 02:12:07,329
and everybody's going to rise up
and do something about it.

2066
02:12:07,336 --> 02:12:10,203
Look what happened to Kennedy
after Chappaquiddick.

2067
02:12:10,214 --> 02:12:12,956
Or all the crooks with Nixon
and Watergate.

2068
02:12:12,967 --> 02:12:14,583
Things went right on.
People forget.

2069
02:12:16,846 --> 02:12:21,841
Come on, to hell
with all that.

2070
02:12:21,851 --> 02:12:23,137
The only important thing now

2071
02:12:23,144 --> 02:12:24,805
is how can we get
out of this mess

2072
02:12:24,812 --> 02:12:27,144
without somebody getting hurt.

2073
02:12:27,148 --> 02:12:29,435
I think you've got to try
and slip out of here

2074
02:12:29,442 --> 02:12:30,898
a")! Way you can.

2075
02:12:32,027 --> 02:12:33,267
It's funny. Last time you were
the one

2076
02:12:33,279 --> 02:12:35,361
who couldn't wait
for me to surrender.

2077
02:12:35,364 --> 02:12:38,026
It's not funny.

2078
02:12:38,033 --> 02:12:40,866
It's totally different
this time.

2079
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:43,157
They're going to
kill you, Billy.

2080
02:12:47,084 --> 02:12:48,574
How many kids were shot

2081
02:12:48,586 --> 02:12:49,872
at that Kent State
and all those other--

2082
02:12:49,879 --> 02:12:52,337
What in the hell does that
have to do with anything?

2083
02:12:52,339 --> 02:12:54,376
It has everything
to do with it.

2084
02:12:54,383 --> 02:12:56,590
If they have to force their way
in here looking for me

2085
02:12:56,594 --> 02:12:59,382
a lot of people
are going to get hurt.

2086
02:12:59,388 --> 02:13:01,174
Now look at who's
the nonviolent one.

2087
02:13:01,182 --> 02:13:02,923
No, I'm not being nonviolent.

2088
02:13:02,933 --> 02:13:06,517
I'm just trying to buy
a little bit of time.

2089
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:09,182
Besides, they wouldn't dare
hurt me now.

2090
02:13:15,738 --> 02:13:18,400
Carl.

2091
02:13:18,407 --> 02:13:20,364
Don't anybody move.

2092
02:13:21,452 --> 02:13:23,113
All right, I'll surrender
peaceably

2093
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:24,906
if I have the governor's
personal word

2094
02:13:24,914 --> 02:13:27,576
that you'll take
all these troops,

2095
02:13:27,583 --> 02:13:30,621
move off the campus and clear
out of the reservation.

2096
02:13:30,628 --> 02:13:32,289
Those are
the governor's orders.

2097
02:13:32,296 --> 02:13:35,129
We're to pull out just as soon
as you're in jail.

2098
02:13:35,132 --> 02:13:36,247
That's the deal, Billy.

2099
02:13:36,258 --> 02:13:37,589
You heard it personally?

2100
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:40,210
That's right, Billy.
I was there.

2101
02:13:40,221 --> 02:13:43,088
All right.
I'll be down shortly.

2102
02:13:46,268 --> 02:13:48,760
Look.

2103
02:13:48,771 --> 02:13:51,889
I came up here so fast
I forgot to bring bullets.

2104
02:13:53,984 --> 02:13:56,316
Come on. They wouldn't dare
do something to me now,

2105
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,606
it'd be much too obvious.

2106
02:13:57,613 --> 02:13:59,445
I'm sorry, Carl,
but this warrant

2107
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:00,938
is from the state's
Attorney General.

2108
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:02,486
He's under state custody.

2109
02:14:02,493 --> 02:14:03,983
The hell he is.

2110
02:14:03,994 --> 02:14:06,281
- I'll take him in.
- No, you won't.

2111
02:14:06,288 --> 02:14:08,120
The Attorney General received
orders directly

2112
02:14:08,123 --> 02:14:10,911
from the state supreme court and
gave them personally to me.

2113
02:14:10,918 --> 02:14:13,125
I'm sorry, Carl.

2114
02:14:13,128 --> 02:14:16,621
Then I'll follow along
and make sure nothing happens.

2115
02:14:16,632 --> 02:14:19,465
He's yours, Stanley.

2116
02:14:37,653 --> 02:14:40,486
Move that truck.

2117
02:14:46,161 --> 02:14:48,823
Are you going to move that
truck or am I? Now move it.

2118
02:14:48,831 --> 02:14:50,742
Sergeant, do you think we have
someone

2119
02:14:50,749 --> 02:14:52,080
who can do something
about this?

2120
02:14:58,340 --> 02:14:59,830
What the hell is that?

2121
02:14:59,842 --> 02:15:01,674
Just a precaution, ma'am.

2122
02:15:01,677 --> 02:15:04,044
What do you mean precaution,
I thought the deal was

2123
02:15:04,054 --> 02:15:05,840
when Billy surrendered
the governor would take

2124
02:15:05,848 --> 02:15:07,805
all you Gestapo out of here.

2125
02:15:07,808 --> 02:15:10,345
Don't bite at me, lady.
I'm just an order taker.

2126
02:15:25,784 --> 02:15:27,274
All right. Go ahead
and take your leak.

2127
02:15:28,662 --> 02:15:30,403
I never said I had to
take a leak.

2128
02:15:30,414 --> 02:15:32,621
Regulations.

2129
02:15:52,436 --> 02:15:55,849
Pick it up. It may be dangerous
out there in the dark.

2130
02:16:24,635 --> 02:16:26,376
Now, that's
the funniest thing.

2131
02:16:26,387 --> 02:16:29,095
You know, one time,
I don't remember where,

2132
02:16:29,098 --> 02:16:30,588
somebody told me

2133
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:33,762
that if at any time I was
ever arrested and they gave me

2134
02:16:33,769 --> 02:16:36,887
a handgun and said something
about taking a leak--

2135
02:16:50,285 --> 02:16:51,616
Oh!

2136
02:16:57,459 --> 02:17:00,622
My God, man. Do you realize
what they will do to us?

2137
02:17:00,629 --> 02:17:03,667
Shut up and fan out.

2138
02:17:03,674 --> 02:17:05,961
I'm not going out in the dark
after him.

2139
02:17:05,968 --> 02:17:07,458
Are you nuts?

2140
02:17:07,469 --> 02:17:08,834
To hell with you.

2141
02:17:08,846 --> 02:17:10,336
I know I hit him.

2142
02:17:10,347 --> 02:17:13,556
Fan out. Move it.

2143
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:41,792
One sound and I tear out
the windpipe.

2144
02:17:41,795 --> 02:17:45,333
Now get your handgun out and
bring it up to me very easy.

2145
02:17:50,012 --> 02:17:51,502
All right.

2146
02:17:51,513 --> 02:17:53,550
Now, I want the keys
to these cuffs

2147
02:17:53,557 --> 02:17:57,016
and the coil wire from this car
and the microphone.

2148
02:17:57,019 --> 02:17:59,681
You understand?

2149
02:17:59,688 --> 02:18:01,144
Real slow.

2150
02:18:07,988 --> 02:18:09,319
Well, did you see anything?

2151
02:18:09,323 --> 02:18:10,529
No, sir.

2152
02:18:10,532 --> 02:18:12,148
Not a damn sign of him.

2153
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:14,526
Yes, there is.
This looks like blood.

2154
02:18:14,536 --> 02:18:16,447
Turn on the headlights, Ed.

2155
02:18:17,915 --> 02:18:19,155
Swing it over here.

2156
02:18:37,392 --> 02:18:40,555
I was wrong when I said
to turn the other cheek.

2157
02:18:40,562 --> 02:18:43,224
Brute power can only be met
by brute power.

2158
02:18:43,232 --> 02:18:45,564
We've got to fight back.

2159
02:18:52,950 --> 02:18:54,816
Better than that,
we can bomb the dam.

2160
02:18:58,080 --> 02:19:01,698
Shut up. We'll get
that coverage on CBS.

2161
02:19:16,807 --> 02:19:19,515
We don't want to hear
some speech.

2162
02:19:24,648 --> 02:19:26,764
Shut up! Shut up!

2163
02:19:26,775 --> 02:19:29,233
Listen to me.

2164
02:19:30,779 --> 02:19:32,065
Listen to me.

2165
02:19:35,576 --> 02:19:37,066
Listen to me.

2166
02:19:37,077 --> 02:19:39,785
Now, Jean, built this school
without any help from us

2167
02:19:39,788 --> 02:19:42,746
and she does not need any help
from us to rip it down.

2168
02:19:42,749 --> 02:19:45,411
She can do just fine on her
own if that's what she wants.

2169
02:19:45,419 --> 02:19:47,877
I think she has a right to,
you know,

2170
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:49,416
voice an opinion
on what she wants.

2171
02:19:57,347 --> 02:19:59,429
Stop that.

2172
02:20:02,144 --> 02:20:04,932
As long as this is the end
of our dream,

2173
02:20:04,938 --> 02:20:06,099
and the end
of our school,

2174
02:20:06,106 --> 02:20:07,847
I think we should let
Jean talk.

2175
02:20:13,614 --> 02:20:15,605
Stop. All of you.

2176
02:20:17,117 --> 02:20:18,903
Damn it, I'm mad.

2177
02:20:21,663 --> 02:20:24,325
And you, Jocelyn, I don't care
if you want a speech or not,

2178
02:20:24,333 --> 02:20:27,951
you're going
to hear one, baby.

2179
02:20:27,961 --> 02:20:31,124
I've never asked for one thing
from one of you in this school

2180
02:20:31,131 --> 02:20:34,749
in my life and damn it
I'm going to ask now.

2181
02:20:37,471 --> 02:20:39,337
I've decided this minute
after sitting here

2182
02:20:39,348 --> 02:20:40,509
and watching you guys,

2183
02:20:40,515 --> 02:20:42,347
I'm going to stop giving.

2184
02:20:42,351 --> 02:20:44,638
And I'm going to demand
that you give me five minutes

2185
02:20:44,645 --> 02:20:45,680
of your lousy time,

2186
02:20:45,687 --> 02:20:49,100
and believe me, right now
it's plenty lousy.

2187
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:55,023
I can tell you,
I can promise you,

2188
02:20:55,030 --> 02:20:58,364
if the cop came
into this room

2189
02:20:58,367 --> 02:21:01,200
that shot Billy Jack,
I'd shoot him.

2190
02:21:01,203 --> 02:21:04,912
I'd shoot him.
I know that.

2191
02:21:04,915 --> 02:21:08,374
But God help me he's not here
now so I don't have to

2192
02:21:08,377 --> 02:21:09,867
and I can think a little bit.

2193
02:21:13,173 --> 02:21:15,084
Now, we could go out there.

2194
02:21:15,092 --> 02:21:17,880
Some of us would get shot.

2195
02:21:17,886 --> 02:21:19,342
A few of you would get killed.

2196
02:21:19,346 --> 02:21:20,507
You, maybe, Jocelyn.

2197
02:21:23,183 --> 02:21:25,265
You can die now
if you want to.

2198
02:21:25,268 --> 02:21:26,884
Go ahead.

2199
02:21:26,895 --> 02:21:28,226
What's a life?

2200
02:21:28,230 --> 02:21:32,349
It's easy, you can make them
like that, right?

2201
02:21:32,359 --> 02:21:35,772
Dying is a big step,
and if we wanted to,

2202
02:21:35,779 --> 02:21:38,396
and if we really want to die

2203
02:21:38,407 --> 02:21:40,614
and if we really want
to ruin this school

2204
02:21:40,617 --> 02:21:42,733
and totally destroy it,

2205
02:21:42,744 --> 02:21:46,078
I think we can do it
just as easily tomorrow

2206
02:21:46,081 --> 02:21:48,288
as we can tonight.

2207
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:51,374
And it may give us a chance to
find out why we're doing this.

2208
02:21:51,378 --> 02:21:54,211
Why, what's this
happening for?

2209
02:21:57,634 --> 02:22:00,592
My feeling is, and I know right
now it doesn't mean a damn thing

2210
02:22:00,595 --> 02:22:01,585
to any of you

2211
02:22:01,596 --> 02:22:03,883
but I'm going to say it
anyway,

2212
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:07,224
I feel that right now
this is our crucial test.

2213
02:22:07,227 --> 02:22:09,264
Oh, we're all big mouths.

2214
02:22:09,271 --> 02:22:11,387
We've got great mouths in
telling about this

2215
02:22:11,398 --> 02:22:12,888
great love
we have here.

2216
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:14,230
And what it means.

2217
02:22:14,234 --> 02:22:16,396
And boy this whole school is
really built on it, isn't it?

2218
02:22:16,403 --> 02:22:18,735
I saw it tonight.
It was beautiful.

2219
02:22:18,739 --> 02:22:21,902
Just gorgeous.

2220
02:22:21,908 --> 02:22:24,821
But the question is can
this great love withstand

2221
02:22:24,828 --> 02:22:28,241
what they are doing to us
out there right now?

2222
02:22:28,248 --> 02:22:29,955
Or is that brute violence

2223
02:22:29,958 --> 02:22:32,791
the thing that's going to
overcome the world?

2224
02:22:37,466 --> 02:22:40,049
Now, you all know Danny,

2225
02:22:40,052 --> 02:22:43,545
and you know
the tremendous love

2226
02:22:43,555 --> 02:22:46,718
and time Carol has put in

2227
02:22:46,725 --> 02:22:51,435
to what everyone told us was
an absolutely hopeless case.

2228
02:22:53,565 --> 02:22:57,229
She has been working
for over one month

2229
02:22:57,235 --> 02:22:59,272
to try and teach him a song

2230
02:22:59,279 --> 02:23:02,397
because he's wanted to come up
here on this stage

2231
02:23:02,407 --> 02:23:06,366
like you big guys,
you big shots, and sing.

2232
02:23:09,831 --> 02:23:12,914
Well, there may not be
a platform here tomorrow,

2233
02:23:12,918 --> 02:23:14,750
there may not be
a school here tomorrow.

2234
02:23:14,753 --> 02:23:17,245
You may not be here tomorrow.

2235
02:23:17,255 --> 02:23:21,419
You may not be here tomorrow,

2236
02:23:21,426 --> 02:23:25,135
because you may decide to go
out and get yourselves shot.

2237
02:23:27,557 --> 02:23:30,595
So I'm going to ask you
one small favor.

2238
02:23:32,562 --> 02:23:38,148
Can you give Danny his chance
to be a big guy?

2239
02:23:38,151 --> 02:23:41,644
And I hope to God he doesn't
turn out like some of you.

2240
02:23:43,532 --> 02:23:46,490
So Carol, Danny,

2241
02:23:46,493 --> 02:23:49,326
would you please come up now
and please,

2242
02:23:49,329 --> 02:23:50,319
let him have his chance.

2243
02:24:05,679 --> 02:24:07,386
Ready?

2244
02:24:07,389 --> 02:24:09,505
Want to start us off?

2258
02:24:53,643 --> 02:24:55,259
All the way through it.

2259
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:57,102
Good.

2260
02:25:00,275 --> 02:25:01,891
Thank you.

2261
02:25:06,907 --> 02:25:09,945
I'm well aware of that,
but ask for them anyway.

2262
02:25:09,951 --> 02:25:13,239
I don't give a damn,
we need some help.

2263
02:25:13,246 --> 02:25:15,487
All right.

2264
02:25:15,498 --> 02:25:16,784
Well, they won't pull out.

2265
02:25:16,791 --> 02:25:18,907
We're trying to ask
for federal marshals.

2266
02:25:18,919 --> 02:25:20,956
Has anybody gotten through
to the governor yet?

2267
02:25:20,962 --> 02:25:23,078
Oh, Jean, I've been trying
to get him all afternoon.

2268
02:25:23,089 --> 02:25:25,626
No, he doesn't have time
for a phone call.

2269
02:25:25,634 --> 02:25:28,626
But look at him. He's acting
like the archangel Gabriel.

2270
02:25:28,637 --> 02:25:31,299
So I pledge to you

2271
02:25:31,306 --> 02:25:33,422
that while we will never
provoke any confrontation--

2272
02:25:33,433 --> 02:25:36,141
- Damn you liar.
- ...we will never surrender

2273
02:25:36,144 --> 02:25:40,934
one square foot of this state
to any lawless anarchists.

2274
02:25:40,941 --> 02:25:43,023
Wherever the first firebomb
is thrown,

2275
02:25:43,026 --> 02:25:45,313
wherever the first
brick is thrown,

2276
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:48,108
wherever the first house
is set on fire,

2277
02:25:48,114 --> 02:25:50,606
then we will make our move.

2278
02:25:50,617 --> 02:25:52,824
I have been in contact
with Washington

2279
02:25:52,827 --> 02:25:56,161
and have been promised
full support.

2280
02:25:56,164 --> 02:25:59,452
Well, so much for any hope
of getting the federal marshals.

2281
02:25:59,459 --> 02:26:00,995
And to every citizen
in this state,

2282
02:26:01,002 --> 02:26:04,040
let me be perfectly clear.

2283
02:26:04,047 --> 02:26:06,288
We will move with everything
in our power

2284
02:26:06,299 --> 02:26:08,711
to protect all life--

2285
02:26:08,718 --> 02:26:11,005
Oh, no. Would you believe it?

2286
02:26:11,012 --> 02:26:11,968
Look at that.

2287
02:26:11,972 --> 02:26:13,462
This has been
a remote telecast

2288
02:26:13,473 --> 02:26:15,214
direct from the governor's
office

2289
02:26:15,225 --> 02:26:16,306
at the state capital.

2290
02:26:16,309 --> 02:26:19,222
God above. How can they
be so stupid?

2291
02:26:19,229 --> 02:26:23,314
No, it's not stupid.
It's a well thought-out plan.

2292
02:26:54,222 --> 02:26:55,337
Oh, I almost forgot.

2293
02:26:55,348 --> 02:26:57,259
Call Joe, tell him
I won't be in to work

2294
02:26:57,267 --> 02:26:59,053
k for three or four
more days.

2295
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:01,427
Please, please be careful.

2296
02:27:01,438 --> 02:27:03,224
Don't worry, for God's sakes.

2297
02:27:03,231 --> 02:27:04,721
Why is Mommy so upset?

2298
02:27:04,733 --> 02:27:07,566
Well, she's just
being silly, Danny.

2299
02:27:07,569 --> 02:27:09,401
Now give your old dad a hug.

2300
02:27:09,404 --> 02:27:10,644
It's gotta last me
a couple days.

2301
02:27:13,742 --> 02:27:15,608
The governor's office
wants verification

2302
02:27:15,618 --> 02:27:17,325
that radicals are pouring
into the school

2303
02:27:17,329 --> 02:27:18,535
from all over the state.

2304
02:27:18,538 --> 02:27:20,529
- Verified.
- Verified.

2305
02:27:25,879 --> 02:27:27,085
All right.

2306
02:27:27,088 --> 02:27:28,920
Now, it's your job to cover
the hill.

2307
02:27:28,923 --> 02:27:32,257
Any kid <i>comes</i> up from the school
you warn him once.

2308
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:34,922
You fire a warning shot in the
air and then you shoot to kill.

2309
02:27:34,929 --> 02:27:38,092
Now, they've got snipers
all over the place out there.

2310
02:27:38,099 --> 02:27:40,761
Is that clear?
Do you understand that?

2311
02:27:43,605 --> 02:27:46,393
Does he really expect us
to shoot college kids?

2312
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:48,265
You're damned right.

2313
02:27:48,276 --> 02:27:50,438
Their snipers will hit you
without batting an eye.

2314
02:27:50,445 --> 02:27:53,437
Pardon me for sounding stupid,

2315
02:27:53,448 --> 02:27:55,405
but, uh, what are we
shooting them for?

2316
02:28:20,809 --> 02:28:22,971
The medicine failed.

2317
02:28:22,977 --> 02:28:24,513
Those bullets are killing you.

2318
02:28:36,991 --> 02:28:40,450
Grandfather said it's because
you didn't respect your vision.

2319
02:28:40,453 --> 02:28:44,412
You acted the same way after
as you did before.

2320
02:28:56,261 --> 02:28:59,379
Grandfather is right.

2321
02:28:59,389 --> 02:29:01,505
But we still
have to stop them,

2322
02:29:01,516 --> 02:29:05,350
because they're going
to try to kill Jean.

2323
02:29:11,651 --> 02:29:15,110
Will any of you help me?

2324
02:29:16,239 --> 02:29:19,152
Please. I can't do it alone.

2325
02:29:26,749 --> 02:29:28,285
Ah!

2326
02:29:42,223 --> 02:29:43,463
Let's burn their supply shack.

2327
02:29:51,107 --> 02:29:53,223
Have any of you guys
seen Danny?

2328
02:29:53,234 --> 02:29:55,191
Please, have any
of you seen Danny?

2329
02:29:55,195 --> 02:29:56,902
- No.
- Yeah, I think I saw him

2330
02:29:56,905 --> 02:29:58,691
running back towards
the girls' dorm.

2331
02:29:58,698 --> 02:29:59,529
Thank you

2332
02:30:03,786 --> 02:30:05,368
Has Danny been through here?

2333
02:30:05,371 --> 02:30:06,702
- You mean little Danny?
- Yes.

2334
02:30:06,706 --> 02:30:09,323
Yeah, well, I think I saw him
go down to the bonfire.

2335
02:30:12,587 --> 02:30:13,918
Carol, you can't
go down there.

2336
02:30:13,922 --> 02:30:16,038
I have to.
I have to find Danny.

2337
02:30:16,049 --> 02:30:17,210
Carol, please.

2338
02:30:22,388 --> 02:30:23,970
Now they've set
a shack on fire.

2339
02:30:23,973 --> 02:30:27,386
You better send a fire truck and
more men to push them back.

2340
02:30:27,393 --> 02:30:28,383
Right. Over.

2341
02:30:51,960 --> 02:30:55,123
Form your lines. Form
your lines, gentlemen.

2342
02:30:55,129 --> 02:30:57,291
This is Jean Roberts
at the Freedom School.

2343
02:30:57,298 --> 02:31:00,086
I have urgent information
that can stop all this.

2344
02:31:00,093 --> 02:31:02,255
Tell the governor he's got
to get on the phone now.

2345
02:31:05,932 --> 02:31:07,422
Wasn't that a sniper?

2346
02:31:07,433 --> 02:31:08,844
Sure looks like it.

2347
02:31:08,851 --> 02:31:11,764
Well, why didn't you
fire back?

2348
02:31:11,771 --> 02:31:13,432
I'm not doing anything
until I get my orders.

2349
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:15,100
Why don't you just go call
an ambulance.

2350
02:31:16,484 --> 02:31:18,646
Governor?

2351
02:31:18,653 --> 02:31:20,815
Yes. Any kind of statement
from you

2352
02:31:20,822 --> 02:31:22,358
will calm things
down considerably.

2353
02:31:24,158 --> 02:31:26,195
Would you please let me go out
and tell them anything?

2354
02:31:26,202 --> 02:31:27,863
Anything direct from you?

2355
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:30,658
If the students draw back,

2356
02:31:30,665 --> 02:31:32,997
and seal themselves
in the dormitory,

2357
02:31:33,001 --> 02:31:35,459
then I'll pull back
the militia.

2358
02:31:35,461 --> 02:31:38,670
If not, we'll stop this
at all costs.

2359
02:31:38,673 --> 02:31:40,630
Well, you pull back
your militia

2360
02:31:40,633 --> 02:31:41,839
and I'll get the kids inside.

2361
02:31:41,843 --> 02:31:44,005
God above, at least
give me that chance.

2362
02:31:54,814 --> 02:31:57,021
- Have you seen Danny?
- No, I've been with Joanne.

2363
02:31:57,025 --> 02:31:59,062
Try the playground,
I'll try the barn.

2364
02:31:59,068 --> 02:32:00,979
He's probably
down with his burro.

2365
02:32:02,572 --> 02:32:04,404
General, there is a sniper.

2366
02:32:04,407 --> 02:32:06,489
Lieutenant Stowe, take
your squad around the hill

2367
02:32:06,492 --> 02:32:08,028
to the other side of that wall

2368
02:32:08,036 --> 02:32:09,367
and see if you can find
that sniper.

2369
02:32:09,370 --> 02:32:09,950
Yes, sir.

2370
02:32:09,954 --> 02:32:11,536
What kind of buck shot
are you using?

2371
02:32:11,539 --> 02:32:12,199
Double ought.

2372
02:32:12,206 --> 02:32:14,072
That's equivalent
to a .38 caliber, sir.

2373
02:32:14,083 --> 02:32:16,370
I know what it's equivalent
to but if it will kill a deer,

2374
02:32:16,377 --> 02:32:17,583
it will kill those bastards.

2375
02:32:27,555 --> 02:32:32,220
Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!

2376
02:32:49,702 --> 02:32:51,192
Hendrick, fire a warning shot.

2377
02:32:52,872 --> 02:32:54,829
What the hell was that?

2378
02:32:57,251 --> 02:32:59,993
The sniper, he's firing at us.

2379
02:33:05,843 --> 02:33:07,254
God, they're
really shooting at us.

2380
02:33:07,261 --> 02:33:09,548
This is Sergeant Tibbs
at the north wall.

2381
02:33:09,555 --> 02:33:11,137
<i>Being fired on by a sniper.</i>

2382
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:12,471
<i>One man's been hit. Over.</i>

2383
02:33:12,475 --> 02:33:14,057
They're firing
on all sides, sir.

2384
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:16,392
Damn it to hell, return fire.

2385
02:33:16,396 --> 02:33:18,854
All state troopers.
Fire at will.

2386
02:34:03,985 --> 02:34:07,273
Danny?

2387
02:34:16,456 --> 02:34:21,951
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.

2388
02:34:21,961 --> 02:34:24,419
Stop it!

2389
02:34:31,637 --> 02:34:32,843
Carol.

2390
02:34:32,847 --> 02:34:35,680
What the hell
are you waiting for?

2391
02:34:35,683 --> 02:34:38,345
Come on, move it.

2392
02:34:39,771 --> 02:34:41,353
Not in the damn air, mister.

2393
02:34:41,355 --> 02:34:44,438
Down into the crowd. Now.

2394
02:34:46,569 --> 02:34:47,183
Carol?

2395
02:34:58,998 --> 02:35:03,162
Danny? Danny?

2396
02:35:27,276 --> 02:35:30,519
Please someone help me!

2397
02:35:36,202 --> 02:35:37,818
Please help!

2398
02:35:51,634 --> 02:35:52,874
What the hell?

2399
02:35:59,183 --> 02:36:01,174
Colonel, what's going on
down there?

2400
02:36:03,938 --> 02:36:07,681
Help me!

2401
02:37:04,749 --> 02:37:06,990
Under authority
of the Treaty of 1868,

2402
02:37:07,001 --> 02:37:10,414
I am arresting you for being
illegally on Indian land.

2403
02:37:11,505 --> 02:37:14,293
If you resist, or if you
want to continue

2404
02:37:14,300 --> 02:37:16,962
this senseless slaughter
of these unarmed students

2405
02:37:16,969 --> 02:37:20,132
who are here
under our protection,

2406
02:37:20,139 --> 02:37:22,301
then you'll have to shoot
your way through us.

2407
02:37:22,308 --> 02:37:24,891
This is a monumental step
you're taking.

2408
02:37:24,894 --> 02:37:27,886
You give us no other choice.

2409
02:37:27,897 --> 02:37:31,982
If this country must have
another civil war,

2410
02:37:31,984 --> 02:37:33,816
then let it start here.

2411
02:37:33,819 --> 02:37:36,311
What the hell is he doing?

2412
02:38:27,415 --> 02:38:29,076
All right.

2413
02:38:29,083 --> 02:38:30,869
I'll notify the governor.

2414
02:38:38,884 --> 02:38:41,501
Somebody help us, please.

2415
02:38:50,938 --> 02:38:52,599
No, we're pulling out.

2416
02:38:52,606 --> 02:38:55,394
You should have been here
tonight, old buddy.

2417
02:38:55,401 --> 02:38:56,891
We got a couple of them.

2418
02:39:13,377 --> 02:39:16,119
It's funny.

2419
02:39:16,130 --> 02:39:18,462
I thought the Freedom School

2420
02:39:18,466 --> 02:39:22,300
was a symbol of everything
good and right

2421
02:39:22,303 --> 02:39:24,214
in the American spirit.

2422
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:32,811
We had kids
of different races,

2423
02:39:32,813 --> 02:39:36,306
ideologies, religions,

2424
02:39:36,317 --> 02:39:39,560
all living and working
together in peace and harmony.

2425
02:39:47,578 --> 02:39:49,615
For all the kids
at the school,

2426
02:39:49,622 --> 02:39:51,784
we really want you back.

2427
02:39:54,126 --> 02:39:55,742
Aren't you going to
open it again?

2428
02:39:57,797 --> 02:40:01,540
It's not the kids.

2429
02:40:01,550 --> 02:40:03,837
It's the townspeople.

2430
02:40:03,844 --> 02:40:06,962
They not only supported
the shooting,

2431
02:40:06,972 --> 02:40:09,134
but if you can believe it,

2432
02:40:09,141 --> 02:40:11,633
they were actually happy
about it.

2433
02:40:34,458 --> 02:40:35,823
What do they think?

2434
02:40:35,835 --> 02:40:37,246
Will he come back
or is he dead yet?

2435
02:40:37,253 --> 02:40:40,041
No, not yet.

2436
02:40:40,047 --> 02:40:43,210
Some of the old men say that
he's lost the will to live.

2437
02:40:43,217 --> 02:40:45,128
Go see if you can find Jean
and get her up here.

2438
02:40:58,566 --> 02:40:59,681
You have not learned enough

2439
02:40:59,692 --> 02:41:01,774
to come over
to this side permanently.

2440
02:41:01,986 --> 02:41:05,274
Why? My spirit progresses
so poorly on the other side.

2441
02:41:06,157 --> 02:41:08,364
That's because you don't value
your visions.

2442
02:41:08,367 --> 02:41:11,075
You must carefully listen
to them and change your life

2443
02:41:11,078 --> 02:41:13,365
according to what they say.

2444
02:41:13,372 --> 02:41:15,238
I understand that.

2445
02:41:15,249 --> 02:41:16,990
But why can't I do that here?

2446
02:41:17,168 --> 02:41:20,411
You must go back, for when
people can see how someone

2447
02:41:20,421 --> 02:41:24,255
as violent as you can change
and find inner peace,

2448
02:41:24,258 --> 02:41:26,716
then you will set
a good example.

2449
02:41:26,719 --> 02:41:29,928
After you have gone back
and practiced the fourth way,

2450
02:41:30,139 --> 02:41:32,471
then you will meet
your spiritual guide.

2451
02:41:32,474 --> 02:41:34,385
Well, how am I supposed
to do that?

2452
02:41:34,393 --> 02:41:36,760
I don't even know
what the fourth way is.

2453
02:41:36,770 --> 02:41:38,636
My friend will tell you.

2454
02:41:38,647 --> 02:41:41,435
But you will not be able
to reach the fourth way

2455
02:41:41,442 --> 02:41:43,809
until you stop covering
your weaknesses

2456
02:41:43,819 --> 02:41:45,605
with violent acts.

2457
02:41:45,613 --> 02:41:47,604
The fourth and highest level
is when,

2458
02:41:47,615 --> 02:41:49,322
no matter what
they do to your body

2459
02:41:49,325 --> 02:41:51,692
they cannot touch your soul,

2460
02:41:51,702 --> 02:41:53,989
because you are so deeply
into your own center.

2461
02:41:53,996 --> 02:41:56,033
Then you see violence
and anger

2462
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:57,906
and bullying
not as threats,

2463
02:41:57,917 --> 02:42:00,204
but as cover-ups used
by panicked men

2464
02:42:00,211 --> 02:42:02,122
who are
frightened and in pain.

2465
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:04,996
Instead of hating them

2466
02:42:05,007 --> 02:42:06,918
you truly feel sorry
for their weakness,

2467
02:42:06,926 --> 02:42:09,714
and can easily turn and offer
them your other cheek.

2468
02:42:11,931 --> 02:42:15,140
Now go back and do
what you must do.

2469
02:42:15,142 --> 02:42:16,803
And take Carol,

2470
02:42:16,810 --> 02:42:18,972
for she will help you carry on
the teachings.

2471
02:42:41,168 --> 02:42:43,956
How are all the kids?

2472
02:42:43,963 --> 02:42:46,671
I don't know.

2473
02:42:46,674 --> 02:42:49,336
I haven't been back there yet.

2474
02:42:49,343 --> 02:42:51,004
What do you mean you haven't
been back there?

2475
02:42:51,011 --> 02:42:54,845
You mean you, you haven't been
back to the school?

2476
02:42:54,848 --> 02:42:56,464
Why not?

2477
02:42:57,184 --> 02:42:58,424
Don't they need your help

2478
02:42:58,435 --> 02:43:00,017
getting the whole thing
started again?

2479
02:43:01,021 --> 02:43:03,103
You mean you really want to
go through all that again?

2480
02:43:05,859 --> 02:43:07,270
Are you telling me
you're quitting?

2481
02:43:10,823 --> 02:43:12,154
Look over there.

2482
02:43:28,465 --> 02:43:30,581
Well, that's a strong sign.

2483
02:43:32,052 --> 02:43:33,884
That doesn't change
your mind at all?

2484
02:43:44,815 --> 02:43:46,431
Tomorrow, all over the world

2485
02:43:46,442 --> 02:43:48,183
kids are going to march
to rebuild the school.

2486
02:43:49,528 --> 02:43:52,065
We're going to try to start
other schools, all over,

2487
02:43:52,072 --> 02:43:53,904
just like you've done
for us here.

2488
02:43:54,158 --> 02:43:56,195
Instead of stopping
the exposes,

2489
02:43:56,201 --> 02:43:58,442
we've got to work harder now
than ever.

2490
02:43:58,454 --> 02:44:01,196
With Ford and Rockefeller,
nothing will really change.

2491
02:44:01,206 --> 02:44:03,914
Everyone suddenly forgot
about all the urgent reforms

2492
02:44:03,917 --> 02:44:05,624
so we've got to keep on
fighting

2493
02:44:05,627 --> 02:44:07,334
until those reforms
really happen.

2494
02:44:08,547 --> 02:44:11,005
We've all decided.
Everybody.

2495
02:44:11,592 --> 02:44:13,253
We're going to dedicate
the march to you.

2496
02:44:14,053 --> 02:44:16,169
Please come in.
