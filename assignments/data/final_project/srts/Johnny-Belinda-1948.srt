1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:10,965
The island of Cape Breton,
the northeastern end of Nova Scotia...

3
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:14,250
is just a small chunk of land
sticking out into the Atlantic.

4
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,483
Roads haven't been built through
everywhere yet.

5
00:01:16,573 --> 00:01:18,848
You mostly have to come in from the sea.

6
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:21,925
It needs an old hand to navigate
through the shoals offshore...

7
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:25,562
especially during the storms that come up
suddenly in the summertime...

8
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,372
and the little lighthouse
has saved many a life.

9
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:30,364
The village isn't much to shout about.

10
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:33,763
Just a quiet, peaceful place where
the people are proud of their church...

11
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:37,607
built with their own hands and what
little money they could scrape up.

12
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:39,411
Their farms don't bring in much...

13
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:41,882
but for a few months each year
when the cod are running...

14
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,452
there's a lot of excitement.

15
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,525
You should see the harbor then,
alive with boats.

16
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:49,491
They leave the women to take care
of the potatoes and livestock...

17
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:51,086
and put out to sea.

18
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:53,687
Not many of them are lucky enough
to have their own boat...

19
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:57,049
but they all get a share
when the catch is paid for at the cannery.

20
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:01,046
A fair-sized haul means everything.
It means food for the long winter...

21
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,931
new blades for tools,
grain bought for cattle.

22
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:06,368
That's why we watch each vessel
as she comes in...

23
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:08,284
to see how low she sets in the water.

24
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:12,161
Floyd, come on back here
and give us a hand with these fish.

25
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:15,928
Fergus, tack in on that line.
Help get this catch ashore.

26
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,888
Get that unloading net aboard.

27
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,851
-How many drags did you make?
-Two, three hours.

28
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:30,726
Take it away.

29
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:40,331
Get that boom over.

30
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:46,924
Don't tie it off, get it back onboard.

31
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:49,766
I don't want to hang around all day
on this reeking wharf.

32
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:53,452
-Look out!
-Hook's in his shoulder.

33
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,844
Hey, Dan'I!

34
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,924
-Do you know where the doctor is?
-Sure, he's dead.

35
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:01,892
No, the new doctor. Same place. Get.
Hurry up, bring him back, quick.

36
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,488
Come on, get going before this load
starts stinking the place up.

37
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,128
Yes?

38
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:20,727
I got to get the doctor.
Tim's been hurt down at the boat.

39
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:22,041
What is it, Stella?

40
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:25,603
There's a boy out here says a man's
been hurt down at the wharf.

41
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:26,921
I'll be right there.

42
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:28,526
Will you be giving me
some medicine, doctor?

43
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:30,365
No, Mrs. Poggety, just this diet list.

44
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:32,011
I think you'd better
have your teeth X-rayed.

45
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:34,527
-Oh, but Dr. Peterson always said--
-I'm not Dr. Peterson.

46
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,444
But what do my teeth to do
with my backache?

47
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,570
Well, it's taken medicine a good
many years to define that connection...

48
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,725
and I haven't time, unfortunately,
right now to explain it all to you.

49
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:44,769
Stella will take care of your things.

50
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,321
-Will you be back to supper?
-I don't know.

51
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:59,765
-When can I go back to work?
-No time at all.

52
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,845
The main thing is to see
there's no infection.

53
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,289
Would you like to put his coat on?

54
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,209
I'll take him in the buggy.

55
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,252
Hello, darling.

56
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,528
Hey, Locky. Going to the dance Saturday?

57
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:33,492
-Why? Your Gus going out with the fleet?
-I'll be on the wharf tonight.

58
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,643
Well, don't catch cold.

59
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:38,242
-So long, girls.
-Bye, Locky.

60
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:45,490
I looked for you, McCormick.

61
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:48,690
One half the fish you land yesterday
are undersize like little sardines.

62
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:52,243
Well, at 14 cents a pound I can't be
bothered sorting them. I'd starve to death.

63
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,289
If the buyer see them
he will not take them from me.

64
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:56,568
Well, boost your price
and I'll toss back the little ones.

65
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:57,847
And while we're talking about it...

66
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,764
-you miserable old skinflint....
-What's that?

67
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:01,411
Don't get your hackles up,
you Micmac Indian...

68
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:02,687
not with that tub of guts.

69
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,923
-Micmac?
-Micmac! You'd not last two rounds.

70
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,129
It's about time
somebody took you down a peg.

71
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:08,726
You sell our catch for fancy prices...

72
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:11,281
yet you knock down 12 cents the pound
on us farmers.

73
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:12,726
You do not like that?

74
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,168
Well now, you listen to me,
Mr. Locky McCormick...

75
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:17,892
you owe big bill in my store.
You know that.

76
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:19,804
Well, you pay or I take your stinky boat.

77
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:22,168
Why, you greasy old half-breed.

78
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:25,563
You try and take that boat
and I'll gut you out like a cod.

79
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:51,246
You keep your hands to yourself.

80
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,405
Pretty tony since you're working
for His Lordship, huh?

81
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:56,802
You mind your own business.
I've got to get supper ready.

82
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,043
I don't like to see you
working for this man, Stella.

83
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,567
He's a fine doctor. He's a....

84
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:05,810
Anyway he's something big.
Something even you can't pronounce.

85
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,690
Probably something not fit to mention.

86
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:09,923
What're you working your head off for,
anyhow?

87
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:11,924
What good's a dead uncle
if you don't use his money?

88
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,128
No hurry.

89
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:16,330
Plenty can happen between now
and the time the deeds will be signed.

90
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:20,645
You going to try to run it yourself?
That's a good farm, needs a man.

91
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,889
-We could make a lot out of that place.
-We?

92
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:26,682
Sure, I've been thinking things over.
You and me make a great pair.

93
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,650
We ought to get married,
the sooner, the better.

94
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,531
Well, this is a surprise,
Mr. Locky McCormick.

95
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:34,127
Blow your nose, don't look so silly.

96
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:35,686
Oh, Stella...

97
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:38,532
what dress you wearing
to the dance Saturday? The one I like?

98
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:39,841
Maybe.

99
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:42,243
-You're taking me then?
-Well, of course I am.

100
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,131
Fergus put in for it first.
We practiced a step for the jig contest.

101
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:46,282
I'm taking you.

102
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,490
He and Floyd can toss a coin to see
who dances with you, but I'm taking you.

103
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,484
The doctor's coming.
You'd better get out of here.

104
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:53,131
He's in my way.

105
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,885
-You're coming down to the wharf later?
-Might.

106
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:32,046
Thank you.

107
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:41,564
-Is the doctor in?
-He's eating his supper.

108
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:43,769
I've got to see him. She's awful bad.

109
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:45,684
I'll tell him as soon as he's finished
but I can't--

110
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:47,047
Stella?

111
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,603
-What is it?
-It's only Aggie MacDonald from the mill.

112
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:52,921
Nobody has anything to do with them...

113
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:54,890
and it's never a penny of pay
you'll get from her.

114
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,646
Well, she said someone was sick,
didn't she?

115
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:00,930
I didn't like bothering you,
but she's having so much trouble.

116
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,085
-The pain's that strong.
-I'll get my bag.

117
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:08,530
He didn't come at night last time.
It's 12 miles to the veterinary.

118
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:12,730
It's our cow,
she's the only good one we've got.

119
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:15,691
We'll fix her up.

120
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:48,042
He wouldn't have wanted me
to call you, Black wouldn't.

121
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,691
He'll say it costs money...

122
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:53,163
but if the critter dies,
then it's me who's to blame.

123
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:55,244
I'll do all I can to help.

124
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,567
In there.

125
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:18,561
Would you hold the light
a little higher, please?

126
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,372
She can't hear you. She's deaf, dumb.

127
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:34,086
That's too bad.

128
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,693
What she don't know don't hurt her none.

129
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:06,528
-By the way, it's a girl.
-Aye.

130
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:09,682
-Thanks for coming.
-Glad to help.

131
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:29,805
-Was she born deaf?
-No...

132
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:32,566
she took sick
when she was about a year old.

133
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,723
Come time to talk, no sound come out.

134
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:37,407
She growed up that way, dumb.

135
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,044
Blessing she has
such a fine father and mother.

136
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:41,964
That ain't her mother.

137
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:46,371
It's my sister, Aggie.
Her mother's dead. She killed her.

138
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,410
She died in childbed.

139
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:54,047
I guess sometimes it's meant to be.

140
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,283
Sometimes it's easier
to lose someone that way...

141
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:58,489
than to lose them when they're still alive.

142
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,405
I was in love with a girl.
She married another man.

143
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:05,769
I was wondering. A young chap like you,
burying himself here.

144
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:08,003
The other doctors was always old.

145
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:10,766
That was part of it.
There were lots of other things.

146
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,525
It's a pretty stale story.

147
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,366
Way things were going,
I sort of got fed up.

148
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:20,369
So I decided to look for another way.
Simple life, simple things.

149
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:23,327
If people would only learn
to let each other live...

150
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:26,371
it would be a different world.
What's the fee?

151
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,650
I wouldn't know.
I never delivered a heifer before.

152
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:35,050
I might take it out
in fishing in that pool of yours.

153
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,283
Looks like a wonderful place for trout.

154
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,568
-You're welcome anytime.
-Thanks.

155
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:04,931
Good morning, Stella.

156
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:07,527
I was early so I stopped in to tidy up a bit.
The dishes....

157
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:09,126
Please don't bother.

158
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:11,488
-Are you going out?
-For a little while.

159
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:13,052
That's a nice dress. New, isn't it?

160
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,647
-I made it myself. I make all my own--
-Very pretty.

161
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,610
I'll see you tomorrow.
We may have fish for dinner.

162
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,411
I like fish.
I've got the most wonderful way of--

163
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:20,972
No guarantees.

164
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:48,127
Look, Mrs. Lutz, the new doctor.

165
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:50,602
He hasn't been to church once
in three whole months.

166
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:52,092
Nice example.

167
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:55,131
He's a fine doctor. What he did for my Tim.

168
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,612
She's always talking about,
''He's a fine doctor...''

169
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,253
just because he put a bandage on a cut.

170
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:01,487
Hello?

171
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,846
Here, let me help you. Hello.

172
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:42,731
Now, where do they go?

173
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:45,171
Oh, the chickens.

174
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:08,284
Don't be afraid.

175
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:11,604
You watch me talk.

176
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,205
That is a...

177
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:23,646
rooster.

178
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,643
And these are...

179
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,727
hens.

180
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:46,286
Very good.

181
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,806
That's a tree.

182
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,802
Tree.

183
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:06,882
Yes.

184
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,282
Water.

185
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:26,366
Very good. Now if you give...

186
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:29,726
water to the tree...

187
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:32,851
it will grow.

188
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:41,847
Water to the tree, it will grow.

189
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:51,092
Yes, it will grow. The tree will grow.

190
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:54,728
It has very big roots. The roots go...

191
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:57,565
deep into the earth.

192
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:00,682
Earth.

193
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:11,250
And all of it together...

194
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:16,692
is land.

195
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,242
Land.

196
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:31,925
Good. Earth.

197
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:55,962
Eggs.

198
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,524
Four of them. Four.

199
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,687
No. One, two, three, four.

200
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,282
Four.

201
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:25,683
You're right. You're learning very fast.

202
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:30,164
Pretty soon you and I will be able to talk.

203
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,171
Talk. Right.

204
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:51,205
What're you trying to do, McCormick,
shake the clapper out of the bell?

205
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:53,249
-Where's my flour, Mac?
-Ain't it ready?

206
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,402
I can't see it.

207
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,643
The Dummy should be here to serve you.

208
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,365
She ain't done it.

209
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:12,491
I put it down for her.
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

210
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:15,724
Where can I get a team weekdays?
I'll have to wait till Saturday.

211
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:17,769
But if it ain't done then,
I'm going somewheres else.

212
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:20,447
It'll be ready. I'll make her remember.

213
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,645
How can you expect a dimwit
to use her head?

214
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:34,206
What's all this? What is it?

215
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,243
Water, ocean.

216
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:40,802
Ocean.

217
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:47,765
What's got into you?
I write it all down for you.

218
00:20:47,853 --> 00:20:50,845
Here, it's as plain as the nose on your face.

219
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,528
Oh. Well, I guess I forgot.

220
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:58,887
Look.

221
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:07,764
Well, I was wondering.
She never makes a mistake.

222
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,244
Did you ever think
of sending her to school?

223
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,448
School?

224
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:15,491
She's deaf and dumb, man.
There's no teaching her nothing.

225
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:20,044
Here's the extent of her learning.
I make a sign at the top of each page.

226
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:23,206
A cross for Pacquet,
a circle for McCormick...

227
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:25,648
two lines for the McQuiggens and so on.

228
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:27,485
A mark for each bag.

229
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:31,488
I put them down when they come in,
she strikes them off when they're ready.

230
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:34,491
She's learned to identify every man
by his mark.

231
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,249
Must be over 40 names in this book
and she knows every one of them.

232
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,406
So that shows, Mr. MacDonald,
that your daughter is an intelligent girl.

233
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:44,848
Now, there's a special school
for the deaf at McGill.

234
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,685
Schools cost money...

235
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:49,850
and money don't grow on trees
in this country.

236
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:53,843
We're lucky to keep body
and soul together, we farmers.

237
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:56,728
I couldn't spare her. Thanks.

238
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:59,566
There's work enough around here as it is.

239
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:03,282
But she could be taught, I'm sure of it.
What's her name?

240
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:06,323
Me wife wanted her named after herself...

241
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:09,081
Belinda. Belinda MacDonald.

242
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,682
But they call her the Dummy around here.

243
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:13,847
They shouldn't.

244
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:17,369
Even though she can't hear,
these people have very keen perceptions.

245
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:18,602
-Aye.
-They notice things.

246
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:21,526
Come to think of it, she's fond of colors.

247
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:26,162
I took her to church once years ago.
They played the organ.

248
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:29,562
A look come over her face
as though she heard.

249
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:32,292
I knew all the time
she couldn't hear a thing.

250
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:35,570
Well, I'm losing time.
I must get on with my work.

251
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:37,725
Good day to you.

252
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:39,724
Would you mind if I talked to her
once in a while?

253
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:40,962
Talk?

254
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:45,046
When I was an intern at the hospital
I worked for a while with deaf children.

255
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:48,330
Why, I might even have one of the books
still kicking around somewhere.

256
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:50,369
I'd like to try
to teach her some lip-reading.

257
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,808
You'll be wasting your while, man.

258
00:22:53,093 --> 00:22:55,368
But you're welcome here anytime.

259
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:32,124
-$1.80, Mrs. Lutz.
-Did you get the oilcloth?

260
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:35,091
No, but I will save it for you
when it comes in. Thank you.

261
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:36,401
Bye.

262
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:39,489
There's the doctor again.

263
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,605
Talking to himself.

264
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:47,492
-It's spooky.
-I think he's queer in the head.

265
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:50,963
Pretty smart
when it comes to making out his bills.

266
00:23:58,093 --> 00:24:00,926
Hello. Happen to know what kind
of tobacco Black MacDonald uses?

267
00:24:01,013 --> 00:24:02,890
MacDonald has not bought here in weeks.

268
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:07,569
Dr. Richardson, I receive your bill.
Rather steep for a stomachache, yes?

269
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:11,124
As far as I remember, it was three calls.
Two of them after midnight.

270
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:14,967
Dr. Peterson always took his fees out
in barter, like everyone else.

271
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,964
Mr. Pacquet,
I have to get cash somewhere.

272
00:24:17,053 --> 00:24:19,726
You and a few others
are the only ones who can afford it.

273
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:23,044
You wouldn't have to pay me any bills
if you'd stick to that diet I gave you.

274
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:26,205
The only trouble with you is
you eat too well.

275
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:29,251
Now, I'll have this. See, 15, isn't it?

276
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:33,608
Or would you rather wait
and have me take out a splinter?

277
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:09,124
Get your filthy bug out of my dough.

278
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:12,762
The spuds is covered with them.
I can't pick everyone off single-handed.

279
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:16,766
And milk, and plow,
and blast stones without any help.

280
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:20,209
-Don't blame me.
-I'm not blaming you, I'm only telling you.

281
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:22,329
I suppose you want me to pull the plow.

282
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:26,486
I suppose I'm not doing my share, cooking,
and mending, and baking, and spinning.

283
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:29,007
-Who helps me?
-You got the Dummy.

284
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:31,004
A fine lot of help, that one.

285
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:35,006
All the grand ideas that doctor
has been putting into her head.

286
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:37,482
Filling her up with fancy notions.

287
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:41,725
You know what she was doing
instead of feeding the hogs?

288
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:43,531
Brushing her hair.

289
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:47,322
That's not fair to me.
I'm doing the work of six.

290
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:51,326
What's this I hear about you
loafing all day? There's work to do.

291
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:08,211
Aggie, did you see that?
She knew what I was saying.

292
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:09,442
Oh, tosh.

293
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:12,445
She can hear. Belinda, come here!

294
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:17,649
-I tell you she understands, woman.
-You're wandering in your head.

295
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:21,767
-But she came when I called her.
-She was reading your lips.

296
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:24,248
She's been a very good pupil.

297
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:29,091
Belinda, how do you say hello to a friend?

298
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:32,446
That's right.

299
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:36,289
''I am happy to see you.''

300
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:38,450
And I'm happy to see you.

301
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:41,252
-Telling me she can talk that way?
-Of course.

302
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,131
We've been studying
from a book of signs...

303
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:47,171
which were devised by a Frenchman
a couple of hundred years ago...

304
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:49,528
the Abbe de I'Epee, he was a priest.

305
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:53,526
See, each word has its own sign.
For instance, there's ''man.''

306
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:56,526
The sign is this: touching the hat brim.

307
00:26:56,613 --> 00:27:00,367
-And what would ''woman'' be?
-This. Comes from a bonnet string.

308
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:05,247
And that's ''mother.''
Baby. You see, woman with a child.

309
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,086
It's beyond believing. It's as clear as day.

310
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:10,411
And that is the sign for ''day.''

311
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:14,532
You see, this represents the horizon and
this is the sun coming up over the horizon.

312
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:17,286
This is noon
with the sun directly overhead.

313
00:27:17,373 --> 00:27:21,924
Afternoon, evening, and night
when the sun has disappeared completely.

314
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:23,812
Good morning.

315
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:25,841
Good night.

316
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:30,011
And that's ''bread.''

317
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:38,770
What is it? It's a butterfly. Sure.

318
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,887
It is a butterfly. It flutters.

319
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:45,762
Aggie!

320
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,325
Aggie, come here.

321
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:49,641
-I got something.
-What?

322
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:52,850
Look sharp now. Think fast.
What does this mean?

323
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:56,323
-It means you've gone loony.
-It's a butterfly. Look.

324
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:58,881
Don't go waving your hands at me,
I'm not the Dummy.

325
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:01,806
And if you want to have any bread to eat
while I'm gone, leave me be.

326
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:03,849
It's a good job you're going.

327
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,367
We'll have peace around here
for a couple of days.

328
00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:09,045
It's like a miracle.

329
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:21,291
-Would she be saying ''father''?
-Yes, she did.

330
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:24,203
It's the first time she ever called me that.

331
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:28,531
Daughter, my daughter.

332
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:34,529
What do they want?

333
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:54,364
What's going on here, McCormick?

334
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:56,842
Where's my flour?
McQuiggens want theirs, too.

335
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:57,922
It's all done.

336
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:00,368
We'd better load it
before we get too dizzy from dancing.

337
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:03,251
It's there on the racks. Load it and get out.

338
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,563
Here it is, boys. Get to it!

339
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:10,565
All these are mine.
Put them on the bottom.

340
00:29:10,653 --> 00:29:12,006
Yes, Lock.

341
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:16,407
-Afraid you'll crack a fingernail?
-Flour don't go good on my suit.

342
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:22,161
This floor's slick as a whistle.
Hey, Hector, come on. Give us a tune.

343
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:14,249
Hi, Stella, you're looking very handsome.

344
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,801
You like to dance.
Why don't you come with us?

345
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:19,771
-Yes.
-It'll be fun. Basket supper.

346
00:30:21,893 --> 00:30:25,010
I'd love to. Unfortunately,
I have a previous engagement.

347
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:27,561
Two measles cases five miles apart.

348
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:28,604
Hey, the Dummy's dancing.

349
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:35,883
-Her name's Belinda.
-She looks kind of cute fixed up that way.

350
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:54,285
You keep away from that Dummy.

351
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,568
Keep away.... The Dummy and me?

352
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,006
I saw you taking in her legs.

353
00:31:58,573 --> 00:32:01,326
Jealous of a dimwit.
I'm plum ashamed of you, woman!

354
00:32:07,013 --> 00:32:09,163
One thing, she'd never tell on you.

355
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:13,088
-But keep away from her or I'll be able--
-Well, I guess that's all.

356
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,812
What are we waiting for?

357
00:32:34,013 --> 00:32:36,243
I want some cider. Come on, hurry up.

358
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:37,968
Locky!

359
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:47,487
-What's the damage, Mac?
-You know what it is.

360
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:52,492
Locky, come on.

361
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:58,731
Everybody, sing. Everybody, sing now.

362
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,248
Didn't have time to finish them.
I can't do 10 things at once.

363
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,483
It's not my fault if my sister got sick.

364
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:18,049
Well, I'll only be gone a few days.
You can manage.

365
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:21,733
-Aggie!
-I'm coming.

366
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,531
Well, goodbye, Belinda.

367
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:28,930
Sometimes a body'd almost think
you understood.

368
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:54,565
You'll miss the train.

369
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,288
Besides, I don't want to leave Belinda
alone too long.

370
00:33:58,373 --> 00:34:00,762
Nobody would bother stealing her.

371
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,291
There's Mrs. Johnny John-John
just back from hospital.

372
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:29,763
She looks right spry for a woman
who's just had her arteries cut out.

373
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:32,003
Not her arteries, Mrs. Lutz.

374
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,283
Get off my feet. You're drunk.

375
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:53,204
Mrs. Moore is her own worst enemy.

376
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:55,443
Not while I'm alive, she isn't.

377
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:22,206
Hello, Dummy.

378
00:36:26,693 --> 00:36:28,365
Look what I brought you.

379
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,092
Want to dance?

380
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:59,562
First time a man kissed you, wasn't it?

381
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:09,486
Don't be scared, Dummy.
Your heart's pounding.

382
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:13,770
I caught a sea gull once,
it had the same scared look.

383
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:09,292
Hello, Mac.

384
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:14,641
Glad you're here. You've been missed.

385
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:16,849
Well, I'm sorry. I was busy with my call.

386
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:19,527
I've been worried about the girl.
There's something wrong.

387
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:21,922
-Why?
-You can see for yourself.

388
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:23,527
All right.

389
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:32,330
Hello, Aggie. You get back all right?

390
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:34,324
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't, would I?

391
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:36,529
-Is your sister better?
-Yes.

392
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:40,847
-Did she have a good doctor?
-Didn't have any. Doesn't believe in them.

393
00:38:41,093 --> 00:38:44,130
Well, that's the right attitude
as long as one can afford it.

394
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:45,692
How's Belinda?

395
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:48,009
Getting peevisher by the day.

396
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,812
-Where is she?
-Around here somewhere.

397
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,241
Belinda. How are you?

398
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:30,326
Are you cross with me
for not coming to see you?

399
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:35,046
Well, you see, I couldn't.

400
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:41,850
Many men and women
suddenly decided to be sick...

401
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:43,845
at the same time.

402
00:39:48,213 --> 00:39:51,762
Would you like to study your lesson now?

403
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:56,450
All right, no lesson.

404
00:40:04,173 --> 00:40:06,482
Belinda, if you could only hear me.

405
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:10,050
You think I don't know what it means
being lonely like you are?

406
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:13,011
I've been lonely myself,
even when I was a child.

407
00:40:13,253 --> 00:40:15,562
Already then I wanted to be a doctor.

408
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:19,566
I thought that helping others
might help me. It did somehow.

409
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:25,450
Then all those other things happened.
The war and all that came after.

410
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:28,969
Made me lose faith in everything.

411
00:40:30,173 --> 00:40:31,686
In myself, too.

412
00:40:35,973 --> 00:40:37,122
Belinda.

413
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:41,888
Belinda, you must help me.

414
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:44,050
I need you.

415
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:53,204
Yes. I need you.

416
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:58,042
If you only knew what it meant
seeing you smile for the first time.

417
00:40:58,293 --> 00:41:02,571
Bringing happiness, if it's only
to one single human being, is....

418
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:06,405
Belinda, don't let me think
I've failed again.

419
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,811
You'll help me.

420
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:21,163
Mac. Mac, come here.

421
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:24,529
Mac, Belinda's great trouble
is nothing more than loneliness.

422
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:26,490
And she's got to have a chance.

423
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:28,609
Now, there's a doctor in Stepney,
I met him at McGill.

424
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:29,887
A brilliant diagnostician.

425
00:41:29,973 --> 00:41:31,645
I don't know exactly what good
it would do...

426
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:34,884
but I'd like to take Belinda to him.
Belinda...

427
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:39,487
how would you like to go with me
to see a town?

428
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:42,044
T-O-W-N.

429
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,852
A big town.

430
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:58,362
You've done such wonders
with her yourself.

431
00:41:58,453 --> 00:41:59,932
Why does she have to go see that fellow?

432
00:42:00,013 --> 00:42:03,085
Because, Mac, I don't know enough
and I think he does.

433
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:04,772
Doctor like that costs money.

434
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,811
Don't worry about that. I'm going to write
and ask him for an interview.

435
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:09,485
I'm sure he'll do it.

436
00:42:10,173 --> 00:42:12,129
I'm going to write him tonight.

437
00:42:43,373 --> 00:42:45,603
No, Belinda, not women. Men.

438
00:45:38,853 --> 00:45:40,411
Do you see any hope, Doctor?

439
00:45:40,493 --> 00:45:43,405
Aye, that's why we keep on practicing,
Robert.

440
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,570
I understand your concern,
but she needn't worry.

441
00:45:47,653 --> 00:45:50,247
The one fact I'm sure of
is there's no otosclerosis...

442
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:53,052
so as you know, it can't be hereditary.

443
00:45:53,773 --> 00:45:56,890
There's no possibility the expected child
could inherit it.

444
00:45:56,973 --> 00:46:00,170
Clinically, the birth of the child
could make all the difference...

445
00:46:00,253 --> 00:46:02,050
if my theory is correct.

446
00:46:02,653 --> 00:46:04,848
I cannot say for certain, nobody can.

447
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:08,167
But what you've accomplished
is remarkable.

448
00:46:08,253 --> 00:46:11,370
I'd hardly say that.
I just tried a few things I knew.

449
00:46:11,453 --> 00:46:13,762
You've always been an idealist
from way back.

450
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:16,367
Yeah, that's what makes good doctors,
Robert.

451
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,485
Keep in communication with me.

452
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:20,484
I'll be interested in following
the case with you.

453
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:23,087
-I'd be very grateful.
-Goodbye, lad.

454
00:46:50,413 --> 00:46:53,325
Dr. Gray said it wasn't possible
to determine her condition...

455
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:55,131
after only one examination.

456
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:57,443
He said she was very healthy,
very intelligent.

457
00:46:57,533 --> 00:46:58,852
And that he wanted to see her again.

458
00:46:58,933 --> 00:47:01,288
Fine. Now maybe she'll have a chance.

459
00:47:01,813 --> 00:47:04,691
She's worn out.
She slept nearly the whole way home.

460
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:08,768
Belinda, why don't you go upstairs to bed?

461
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:18,612
Good night, daughter.

462
00:47:35,213 --> 00:47:37,124
She looks so grand in that dress.

463
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:41,647
Beats me why I never noticed it before.

464
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:47,805
Do you think I could take her to church
come Sunday?

465
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:51,572
She's only been there the once,
when she was a child.

466
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:53,166
Of course, why not?

467
00:47:53,293 --> 00:47:56,012
Right now, how about taking the cows
to the barn?

468
00:47:56,093 --> 00:47:57,970
I'm forgetting everything.

469
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,722
You're not very fond of Belinda, are you?

470
00:48:06,813 --> 00:48:09,008
I've always been civil to her.

471
00:48:09,573 --> 00:48:11,211
She's my brother's daughter.

472
00:48:11,293 --> 00:48:14,524
You should see to it that she doesn't
have to carry those heavy sacks.

473
00:48:14,613 --> 00:48:16,126
She's not too strong.

474
00:48:17,213 --> 00:48:19,886
Doctor, you'll be doing
my brother and me a favor...

475
00:48:19,973 --> 00:48:23,443
if you'll stop putting
those grand ideas into her head.

476
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,569
There were no complaints until you came.

477
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,086
She did her work like the rest of us...

478
00:48:27,173 --> 00:48:30,643
like we all have to do if we want
to keep a roof over our heads.

479
00:48:30,933 --> 00:48:34,323
I have to tell you, Aggie,
you're the only woman she knows...

480
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:37,132
and she'll be in need
of your sympathy and help.

481
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:40,325
-My help?
-Belinda's going to have a child.

482
00:48:46,253 --> 00:48:49,131
Oh, no. No, it's not true.

483
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,011
There isn't any doubt.

484
00:48:52,773 --> 00:48:54,843
When her father finds out, he'll kill her.

485
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,764
That's why I told you.

486
00:48:57,053 --> 00:49:00,489
She doesn't know.
Doesn't even realize it herself yet.

487
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:04,208
-But he must find out.
-I'll tell him, at the right moment.

488
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:07,892
Oh, it's....

489
00:49:08,173 --> 00:49:10,767
Do you have any idea who the man was?

490
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:13,642
No.

491
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,242
Don't let anything happen to her.

492
00:49:21,773 --> 00:49:25,368
I've been pretty brusque with her.

493
00:49:26,173 --> 00:49:28,323
You're making up for it now.

494
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:32,287
We MacDonalds, we're high-tempered.

495
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:37,408
We fight amongst ourselves...

496
00:49:38,173 --> 00:49:40,733
but let trouble come from outside...

497
00:49:42,173 --> 00:49:44,164
and we'll stick together.

498
00:51:50,613 --> 00:51:55,004
We will open our services by singing
the first verse of hymn number 73.

499
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:55,129
I'm requested to publish
the banns of marriage...

500
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:57,888
between Laughlin McCormick
of Carcadie...

501
00:52:57,973 --> 00:53:00,885
and Stella Maguire, spinster of this parish.

502
00:53:02,293 --> 00:53:04,329
If any of you know
cause or just impediment...

503
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:07,564
why these two persons should not
be joined together in holy matrimony...

504
00:53:07,653 --> 00:53:09,450
ye are to declare it.

505
00:53:10,373 --> 00:53:12,807
This is the first time of asking.

506
00:53:14,093 --> 00:53:17,529
We will close our services
by singing hymn number 43.

507
00:53:18,093 --> 00:53:20,732
You're the lucky one. Congratulations!

508
00:53:23,773 --> 00:53:27,163
Mr. MacDonald, I'm so happy
to see you at our church again...

509
00:53:27,253 --> 00:53:29,005
and Miss MacDonald.

510
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:34,005
I didn't know I could be so proud
of my own flesh and blood.

511
00:53:34,093 --> 00:53:37,483
Did you see the way
they all turned and looked at her?

512
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:47,772
Well, Stella, this is quite a surprise.

513
00:53:48,013 --> 00:53:49,366
Thank you.

514
00:53:50,573 --> 00:53:52,484
Well, good luck to you.

515
00:53:52,573 --> 00:53:54,291
When's the wedding?

516
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:45,127
You mustn't forget your chores, girl.

517
00:55:01,653 --> 00:55:03,609
Have you lost your mind,
Black MacDonald?

518
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:04,728
What's the matter now?

519
00:55:04,813 --> 00:55:07,202
She's no mule! She can't stand all that.

520
00:55:07,293 --> 00:55:11,172
What's got into you, woman?
I have to have this mash mixed, haven't I?

521
00:55:11,253 --> 00:55:12,686
She's done it ever since we had pigs.

522
00:55:12,773 --> 00:55:15,333
Well, she won't do it anymore.
Now you leave her to me.

523
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:16,687
Sit down.

524
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:20,529
You're as white as a sheet.
I'll get you some water.

525
00:55:25,533 --> 00:55:27,251
-Here.
-What's wrong with her?

526
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:30,052
She's out of sorts.
The doctor told her to take it easy.

527
00:55:30,133 --> 00:55:34,331
Look, I work from 4:00 in the morning
till dark. Year in, year out.

528
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:38,167
What she has to do is no hardship.
Belinda's a healthy girl.

529
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,447
She's not.

530
00:55:40,773 --> 00:55:42,525
Now you leave her to me
and to the doctor.

531
00:55:42,613 --> 00:55:45,286
What do you make a mystery of it for?
She's my daughter.

532
00:55:45,373 --> 00:55:47,170
I've a right to know
if there's anything serious.

533
00:55:47,253 --> 00:55:50,290
Belinda's gonna have a.... A child.

534
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:53,401
Oh, no.

535
00:55:54,053 --> 00:55:56,123
-It couldn't be.
-It's true.

536
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,849
That dirty, filthy doctor!

537
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:01,770
No! No, you're wrong.

538
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:04,171
Who would it be then?

539
00:56:05,453 --> 00:56:06,886
I don't know.

540
00:56:07,093 --> 00:56:08,765
-Tell me his name.
-Hold your temper.

541
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:11,651
Hold my temper?
What kind of a father do you think I am?

542
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:13,246
Listen, child, who was it that hurt you?

543
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,652
How do you expect her to tell you?

544
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:16,212
She doesn't know
what you're talking about.

545
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:17,965
Keep out of this.

546
00:56:21,373 --> 00:56:25,571
Show me. Show me the man's name.
Who was it? Who was it that hurt you?

547
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:27,086
She doesn't know! Leave her be.

548
00:56:27,173 --> 00:56:30,370
Don't be a fool, woman.
She's no babe in arms for all she's deaf.

549
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,809
She's trying to shield the man.
Listen, child, show me.

550
00:56:34,013 --> 00:56:37,164
Show me, I tell you.
Do I have to beat it out of you?

551
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:38,447
Oh, no. No, don't!

552
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:39,966
Stop it!
You don't know what you're doing!

553
00:56:40,053 --> 00:56:42,408
-Let go of me! I got to find the man!
-Come to your senses!

554
00:56:42,493 --> 00:56:44,085
Even if she could talk,
she couldn't tell you.

555
00:56:44,173 --> 00:56:45,208
You've no right to go on this way.

556
00:56:45,293 --> 00:56:47,887
-No right? I'm her father.
-Then act like a father!

557
00:56:47,973 --> 00:56:50,487
Leave her be. I couldn't help it.

558
00:56:50,693 --> 00:56:53,127
You're the one person that can give her
what she needs most:

559
00:56:53,213 --> 00:56:54,805
help, comfort, and understanding.

560
00:56:54,893 --> 00:56:57,771
What are you trying to do,
drive her insane?

561
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:02,205
-I couldn't help it. Hard to go on....
-Aggie, come on. Take her to her room.

562
00:57:05,453 --> 00:57:07,648
-Have her get some rest.
-Yes.

563
00:57:07,973 --> 00:57:10,248
Now, Mac, you've got to listen to me.

564
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:12,289
I understand how you feel
and I don't blame you...

565
00:57:12,373 --> 00:57:14,682
but believe me,
it's blotted out of her mind.

566
00:57:14,773 --> 00:57:15,762
The way you forget a nightmare...

567
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:17,889
because you don't wanna bring back
that terrible fear.

568
00:57:17,973 --> 00:57:19,008
I've seen it in the war.

569
00:57:19,093 --> 00:57:21,482
It's nature throwing up a barrier
to prevent something worse.

570
00:57:21,573 --> 00:57:23,131
I don't know what you're talking about.

571
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:25,329
-I've got to find the man.
-What good will that do her?

572
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:27,688
I'll lay what he done
before the men of the village.

573
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:29,047
We'll show him what justice is.

574
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:31,169
And even if you do,
how will that help the girl?

575
00:57:31,253 --> 00:57:32,891
Dragging her into a mess of scandal...

576
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:34,611
when she doesn't even know
what it's all about.

577
00:57:34,693 --> 00:57:37,651
-It'll crucify her. Is that what you want?
-You know it isn't.

578
00:57:38,453 --> 00:57:41,809
What am I going to do? The shame of it.

579
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:45,647
Mac, you've got to think of her now,
not of yourself and your pride.

580
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:49,089
There's only one shame,
failing a human being who needs you.

581
00:57:53,973 --> 00:57:56,328
I'm going up and talk to her now.

582
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:34,208
He didn't mean to hurt you.

583
00:58:34,693 --> 00:58:37,207
He's just.... Just very worried.

584
00:58:38,453 --> 00:58:42,241
That's what makes him
seem harsh and unjust sometimes.

585
00:58:43,013 --> 00:58:44,685
He works so hard.

586
00:58:45,933 --> 00:58:49,323
That's why he hasn't been able
to give you more time.

587
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,848
You've been alone so much, Belinda...

588
00:58:52,933 --> 00:58:55,811
but you're not going to be alone anymore.

589
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,122
You're going to be a mother.

590
00:59:13,013 --> 00:59:14,492
Yes, Belinda.

591
00:59:38,573 --> 00:59:41,770
You'll call it Johnny? But Belinda, you....

592
00:59:43,133 --> 00:59:44,202
Well...

593
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:47,804
if you want it so much,
I guess you'll have a boy.

594
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:52,211
I'm sorry I couldn't get here any faster.

595
01:00:52,293 --> 01:00:54,090
The horse could hardly break
through the drifts.

596
01:00:54,173 --> 01:00:55,731
I was that worried.

597
01:00:55,813 --> 01:00:58,452
Now, Aggie, I want you to get me
some more hot water, lots of it.

598
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:01,172
And woolen blankets. All you can find.

599
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:32,927
Why does it take so long? It's hours.

600
01:01:33,413 --> 01:01:36,291
It's hard to get born and it's hard to die.

601
01:01:44,453 --> 01:01:46,683
Do you have some brandy around?

602
01:01:46,893 --> 01:01:48,406
I guess there's some.

603
01:02:07,013 --> 01:02:09,243
-Aggie, now hold that just like that.
-Yes.

604
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:12,848
-On the corners.
-Her not making a sound, it's uncanny.

605
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:23,089
Here, try to drink this.

606
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:37,408
Got to keep that heart going.

607
01:03:38,493 --> 01:03:39,972
What are you bawling about?

608
01:03:40,053 --> 01:03:42,283
-How is she?
-She's all right.

609
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,005
The baby's here.

610
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:47,772
It's a boy.

611
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:59,293
Belinda, here's your boy.

612
01:04:13,973 --> 01:04:15,372
Can he talk?

613
01:04:20,053 --> 01:04:21,725
He certainly can.

614
01:05:20,073 --> 01:05:24,385
That ain't dirt, that's good clean earth.
That won't hurt Johnny none.

615
01:05:25,313 --> 01:05:28,862
I was brought up in a hog wallow.
You can't say I'm peaked.

616
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,182
What's eating you now?

617
01:05:51,273 --> 01:05:53,548
You don't get something for nothing
in this world.

618
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:56,591
-What's that mean?
-It means no more credit.

619
01:05:57,313 --> 01:05:59,747
We've had bad years before,
he's never stopped our credit.

620
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,152
Why didn't you try to reason with him?

621
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:03,189
Because nobody would listen to me.

622
01:06:03,273 --> 01:06:05,787
I don't dare show my face in the village.

623
01:06:05,873 --> 01:06:08,341
Everybody treating us like lepers.

624
01:06:08,513 --> 01:06:10,708
Come, Aggie.
It's not like a MacDonald to give up...

625
01:06:10,793 --> 01:06:13,148
because we're having a little hard time.

626
01:06:13,233 --> 01:06:15,463
-We'll manage.
-Manage, is it?

627
01:06:15,713 --> 01:06:18,511
And who's to manage the salt,
and the sugar, and the tea, and the like?

628
01:06:18,593 --> 01:06:19,946
Where are they to come from?

629
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:22,706
We've managed to get deeper in debt
than anyone in Christendom.

630
01:06:22,793 --> 01:06:25,785
We've managed to shut our eyes
to everything that's happening.

631
01:06:25,873 --> 01:06:29,866
I don't even remember what
the grinding wheel sounds like anymore.

632
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,386
Try managing that!

633
01:06:31,473 --> 01:06:35,432
He won't trust us for one more cent,
Pacquet won't, until that bill's paid.

634
01:06:45,713 --> 01:06:48,910
Them sheets are white as snow.
I bleached them extra special.

635
01:06:48,993 --> 01:06:51,746
The prettiest bride this town's ever seen,
that's what you'll be.

636
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,824
-And who told you about it first?
-You did.

637
01:06:53,913 --> 01:06:57,030
The cards never lie. There he is.

638
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:01,943
There'll be many a broken heart
come this Friday night.

639
01:07:07,633 --> 01:07:09,942
Hello, Stella. I can drop you off.

640
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:11,386
No, thanks.

641
01:07:11,553 --> 01:07:13,350
Wait a minute. What's the matter?

642
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:16,743
Did Mrs. Poggety tell you to keep away
from men with blue eyes?

643
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:19,631
A grown-up girl about to be married
swallowing that hocus--

644
01:07:19,713 --> 01:07:21,112
Can't you mind your own affairs?

645
01:07:21,193 --> 01:07:23,753
Always being so superior.
Always finding fault with everybody.

646
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,789
You of all people, after what you've done.

647
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:28,023
-What have I done?
-You know well enough.

648
01:07:28,113 --> 01:07:31,583
A girl who can't defend herself,
who can't even talk. Shaming her.

649
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:33,391
What do you mean?

650
01:07:33,873 --> 01:07:36,023
Who said it? Locky?

651
01:07:36,913 --> 01:07:39,905
Everybody says it.
The whole village is talking about it.

652
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:42,583
That's why nobody calls you.

653
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:44,871
So Locky said it.

654
01:07:45,793 --> 01:07:48,068
I wouldn't have thought
you'd believe that, Stella.

655
01:08:01,793 --> 01:08:03,272
Fog's rolling in.

656
01:08:03,353 --> 01:08:06,231
Can hear the lighthouse
sounding off already.

657
01:08:06,313 --> 01:08:07,871
Won't help the crops any.

658
01:08:07,953 --> 01:08:10,786
The poorer the crops,
the peskier the crows.

659
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:15,348
Mac.

660
01:08:16,713 --> 01:08:20,183
They're saying in the village
that I'm Johnny's father.

661
01:08:21,113 --> 01:08:22,751
It's believable.

662
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,710
When they don't know the answer,
they make up one.

663
01:08:24,793 --> 01:08:27,944
I've been around this place a lot.
At all hours.

664
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:32,346
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

665
01:08:32,433 --> 01:08:35,743
I've even thought of your leaving here,
but that wouldn't prove anything...

666
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,745
giving up something
you've worked for all your life.

667
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:42,303
I know of only one solution.
For me to marry Belinda.

668
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:46,429
That would really give them
something to talk about.

669
01:08:46,513 --> 01:08:49,789
And pretty soon
the gossip would die down for good.

670
01:08:50,553 --> 01:08:53,226
You're being generous, but it won't do.

671
01:08:54,753 --> 01:08:58,223
You see, she kind of feels things,
and people, with her insides.

672
01:08:59,553 --> 01:09:03,102
You don't love her,
you only feel a kind of pity for her.

673
01:09:04,113 --> 01:09:06,673
You'd hurt her worse
than if you hated her.

674
01:09:06,753 --> 01:09:09,028
Make me feel pretty cheap.

675
01:09:09,793 --> 01:09:13,672
For a while there I guess I was thinking
I was quite a guy.

676
01:09:14,713 --> 01:09:17,307
You're one of the best I've run across.

677
01:09:17,393 --> 01:09:21,022
Sometimes you can be too good.
Harm others while doing it.

678
01:09:22,473 --> 01:09:24,304
Well, look who's here.

679
01:09:25,873 --> 01:09:28,023
I have something for Johnny.

680
01:09:31,753 --> 01:09:33,664
You can see him. Watch.

681
01:09:38,353 --> 01:09:40,389
Yes, you can see him hear.

682
01:09:42,993 --> 01:09:44,585
-Coming up a blow.
-A storm?

683
01:09:44,673 --> 01:09:47,745
Coming straight in.
I better get the cattle in.

684
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:52,267
I'll stay here. He has it.

685
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:35,462
Mac?

686
01:10:39,153 --> 01:10:40,268
Mac!

687
01:10:54,153 --> 01:10:55,347
Well.

688
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,624
You don't know me, huh?

689
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:03,784
You ought to, though.

690
01:11:10,113 --> 01:11:12,149
What are you doing in here?

691
01:11:12,913 --> 01:11:15,552
I just come by
to see about some ground barley.

692
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:17,909
That's a cute lad. Never seen him before.

693
01:11:17,993 --> 01:11:19,062
Keep away from him.

694
01:11:19,153 --> 01:11:21,986
What's the matter?
No harm in looking at him, is there?

695
01:11:22,073 --> 01:11:24,507
-Don't be scared. I'm Locky.
-Take your hands off him.

696
01:11:24,593 --> 01:11:27,630
All right, all right. He's a big boy, isn't he?

697
01:11:28,753 --> 01:11:30,948
Spitting image of his father.

698
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:41,106
Well, all right, if you don't want business,
I can go somewheres else.

699
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:25,589
-Where you going?
-With you.

700
01:12:25,673 --> 01:12:27,982
-Well, where to?
-Wherever you're going.

701
01:12:28,073 --> 01:12:29,870
-Why?
-To tell them.

702
01:12:31,073 --> 01:12:33,303
-To tell them what?
-What you done.

703
01:12:33,633 --> 01:12:37,512
-So they'll know how low a man can get.
-You'll tell them nothing.

704
01:12:41,793 --> 01:12:43,465
Go ahead, walk.

705
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:55,951
Something's wrong?

706
01:14:00,473 --> 01:14:01,986
What's happened?

707
01:14:04,393 --> 01:14:05,985
Belinda, what's the matter?

708
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,513
Belinda, what is it? What's bothering you?

709
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,101
Belinda.

710
01:15:04,953 --> 01:15:07,387
''Our Father, which art in heaven...

711
01:15:09,353 --> 01:15:11,264
''hallowed be thy name.

712
01:15:13,673 --> 01:15:15,743
''Thy kingdom come.

713
01:15:18,193 --> 01:15:20,104
''Thy will be done...

714
01:15:22,033 --> 01:15:25,309
''in earth, as it is in heaven.

715
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:38,350
''Give us this day our daily bread.

716
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:42,624
''Forgive us our debts...

717
01:15:44,633 --> 01:15:47,670
''as we forgive our debtors.

718
01:15:48,873 --> 01:15:51,990
''Lead us not into temptation.

719
01:15:54,033 --> 01:15:56,786
''Deliver us from evil.

720
01:15:58,553 --> 01:16:00,783
''For thine is the kingdom...

721
01:16:01,673 --> 01:16:03,186
''and the power...

722
01:16:04,713 --> 01:16:06,271
''and the glory...

723
01:16:07,633 --> 01:16:11,069
''for ever and ever.

724
01:16:15,313 --> 01:16:16,587
''Amen.''

725
01:16:47,233 --> 01:16:49,269
He's trying to sell him
his horse and buggy, he is.

726
01:16:49,353 --> 01:16:51,389
He stopped talking when I came in,
but I heard enough.

727
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:53,350
But what will he do without them?
A doctor.

728
01:16:53,433 --> 01:16:55,105
What practice he has he can cover afoot.

729
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,421
Just to the mill and back.

730
01:16:56,513 --> 01:16:59,869
His luck's run out, that's what.
I saw it in the cards, so help me.

731
01:16:59,953 --> 01:17:03,104
Black. Spades, spades, spades,
no matter where I put them.

732
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:16,150
That rig is worth
two times more than this bill.

733
01:17:17,393 --> 01:17:18,906
I make business and I have the right...

734
01:17:18,993 --> 01:17:21,143
to get back what is owed me
all fair and honorable.

735
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:23,588
But I do not want people saying
that I take advantage.

736
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:25,868
You don't understand.
You'd be doing me a favor.

737
01:17:25,953 --> 01:17:27,147
I have to get rid of them.

738
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:30,589
You mean, something is wrong?
The horse is lame, maybe, yes?

739
01:17:30,673 --> 01:17:33,187
No, he's sturdy as a horse.

740
01:17:33,553 --> 01:17:35,942
But I'm in a hurry,
so I have to take what I can get.

741
01:17:36,033 --> 01:17:38,911
-I'm leaving here for good.
-You are? When?

742
01:17:39,553 --> 01:17:40,986
You seem pleased about it.

743
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,268
-No, I think it's better for you.
-Why?

744
01:17:43,353 --> 01:17:46,311
You see, in this village,
we do not appreciate people coming here.

745
01:17:46,393 --> 01:17:49,112
Strangers who do not follow
our ways of living.

746
01:17:49,193 --> 01:17:52,549
There are men here who can be very angry
and something can happen.

747
01:17:52,633 --> 01:17:54,225
-What?
-Anything.

748
01:17:55,113 --> 01:17:57,024
Look, Pacquet,
put away the tar and feathers.

749
01:17:57,113 --> 01:17:59,343
Do you want the rig or don't you?

750
01:18:14,993 --> 01:18:17,109
She's as pretty as a picture.

751
01:18:27,033 --> 01:18:29,706
Good luck, my boy. Now you can pay me.

752
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:32,023
You know I can. And I want that boat back.

753
01:18:32,113 --> 01:18:33,705
You will have it.

754
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:40,552
-You've a good man, Stella.
-Thank you, Pacquet.

755
01:18:42,753 --> 01:18:44,391
Charlotte, catch!

756
01:18:49,633 --> 01:18:50,748
-Bye!
-Bye!

757
01:18:50,953 --> 01:18:54,070
It's about time Locky settled down.
He's led a stormy youth.

758
01:18:54,153 --> 01:18:55,791
Out on the ocean, you mean, Mrs. McKee.

759
01:18:55,873 --> 01:18:57,101
You know what I mean.

760
01:19:16,673 --> 01:19:20,666
Belinda, I want you
to promise me something.

761
01:19:22,313 --> 01:19:24,588
If anything ever happens to Johnny...

762
01:19:25,313 --> 01:19:27,622
I want you to send for Dr. Gray.

763
01:19:30,553 --> 01:19:33,351
I couldn't come, Belinda. I won't be here.

764
01:19:33,513 --> 01:19:35,265
I have to go away.

765
01:19:36,393 --> 01:19:39,829
After all, I'm a doctor.
I can't help anyone this way.

766
01:19:40,713 --> 01:19:43,147
I can't even make a living for myself.

767
01:19:43,233 --> 01:19:45,701
Anyway, it's the only thing to do.

768
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:48,469
So I made an application.

769
01:19:49,033 --> 01:19:50,830
I made an application.

770
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:57,104
A staff job at the Toronto Hospital,
and they've taken me on.

771
01:19:57,193 --> 01:19:59,070
I got the answer today.

772
01:20:02,153 --> 01:20:05,111
Do you understand?
Do you understand, Belinda?

773
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:08,065
In a month or two...

774
01:20:08,153 --> 01:20:11,190
I'll be able to take care of things,
help you out.

775
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:13,423
I've talked it over with Aggie.

776
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:17,348
You see, the trouble is
I have to leave very soon.

777
01:20:17,793 --> 01:20:19,511
Tomorrow, in fact.

778
01:20:23,433 --> 01:20:26,072
No, Belinda. I won't be able to come.

779
01:20:26,713 --> 01:20:28,749
I'm going across the Gulf.

780
01:20:36,553 --> 01:20:38,305
Yes, very far away.

781
01:20:45,313 --> 01:20:47,110
Yes, I'll be careful.

782
01:20:59,633 --> 01:21:00,952
Belinda....

783
01:21:15,113 --> 01:21:17,149
Forgive me, I didn't know.

784
01:21:27,473 --> 01:21:29,031
Don't be sorry.

785
01:21:30,113 --> 01:21:31,626
I'm very glad.

786
01:22:04,593 --> 01:22:05,867
Come on.

787
01:22:07,033 --> 01:22:08,830
Hurry up, we're late.

788
01:22:08,913 --> 01:22:11,711
It is the honor of the community
we have to think of.

789
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,511
Respectable people do not stand by...

790
01:22:13,593 --> 01:22:16,744
and see shameful things like this happen,
and do nothing.

791
01:22:19,073 --> 01:22:21,667
As a member of the Town Council,
I say it is our duty...

792
01:22:21,753 --> 01:22:24,108
to correct this unfortunate situation.

793
01:22:24,193 --> 01:22:26,627
And we do not want anyone
to come from outside...

794
01:22:26,713 --> 01:22:28,066
and meddle in this.

795
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:31,782
We want to do this quietly.
We can take care of it ourselves.

796
01:22:31,873 --> 01:22:32,942
Yes, Mrs. Moore?

797
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:35,547
Isn't it cruel to take a baby away
from its mother?

798
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:38,147
A creature who's a disgrace
to the whole village?

799
01:22:38,233 --> 01:22:40,827
Who can't even teach a child his prayers?

800
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:43,632
Is it a crime to save a baby
from a life of misery?

801
01:22:43,713 --> 01:22:47,672
These women can't provide for a child.
Already they've sold most of their cattle.

802
01:22:47,753 --> 01:22:50,142
The place is run down.
There's no man to work it.

803
01:22:50,233 --> 01:22:53,350
Why, the baby will be like her,
running loose like an animal.

804
01:22:53,433 --> 01:22:56,391
The doctor. When he finds out,
couldn't he make trouble?

805
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:57,508
After what he did?

806
01:22:57,593 --> 01:22:59,470
Sneaking out of town
in the middle of the night?

807
01:22:59,553 --> 01:23:02,545
He will be too smart
to ever show his face here again.

808
01:23:02,633 --> 01:23:06,512
I could almost feel sorry for her.
It's a good thing she can't think or feel.

809
01:23:06,593 --> 01:23:09,903
Nothing better could happen for the child
than the offer we got.

810
01:23:09,993 --> 01:23:13,349
He will have a name,
a home with respected parents...

811
01:23:13,593 --> 01:23:15,504
Mr. and Mrs. McCormick.

812
01:23:15,953 --> 01:23:18,103
Now, there's no need for a lot of red tape.

813
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,912
All we have to do is
get the release from the girl.

814
01:23:20,993 --> 01:23:23,905
She only has to sign it.
It is an easy thing to make a cross.

815
01:23:23,993 --> 01:23:28,191
With the release we send this petition.
I do not think there will be any trouble.

816
01:23:29,593 --> 01:23:32,665
If the girl had normal intelligence
she would be grateful.

817
01:23:39,913 --> 01:23:41,471
What are you stopping for?

818
01:23:41,553 --> 01:23:44,192
Let's end this bickering.
He has the makings of a fine, sturdy lad.

819
01:23:44,273 --> 01:23:45,945
I'm telling you again,
I'd sooner not take him...

820
01:23:46,033 --> 01:23:47,705
than let you turn him
into a thickheaded farmer.

821
01:23:47,793 --> 01:23:50,102
And I tell you he'll have to earn his keep
when he's growed.

822
01:23:50,193 --> 01:23:51,546
What if he gets sick? It'll cost money.

823
01:23:51,633 --> 01:23:53,988
Whose money?
I don't recall you bringing in any.

824
01:23:54,073 --> 01:23:56,587
Well, it's ours, ain't it? You're my wife.

825
01:23:56,673 --> 01:23:59,107
And you expect me to pay for the honor?

826
01:23:59,193 --> 01:24:00,228
You needn't worry.

827
01:24:00,313 --> 01:24:02,031
I'm not fooling myself
about why you married me.

828
01:24:02,113 --> 01:24:03,671
And I know what started you on the idea.

829
01:24:03,753 --> 01:24:06,426
You want the kid because of that doctor.
'Cause you think it's his.

830
01:24:06,513 --> 01:24:08,504
You're sweet on him
and couldn't hogtie him for yourself.

831
01:24:08,593 --> 01:24:10,026
I loathe him.

832
01:24:10,393 --> 01:24:12,782
A man that would do a thing like that.

833
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:15,351
All right,
then don't think to pamper the boy.

834
01:24:15,433 --> 01:24:16,991
He'll work as soon as he's able.

835
01:24:17,313 --> 01:24:19,224
Giddap there. Giddap.

836
01:24:27,273 --> 01:24:29,548
I'll go by myself. Give me the letter.

837
01:24:29,633 --> 01:24:31,464
What for?
She won't understand it anyhow.

838
01:24:31,553 --> 01:24:33,350
Give me that letter.

839
01:24:37,793 --> 01:24:41,263
Can't hear, can't read.
And don't be all day about it.

840
01:25:14,473 --> 01:25:15,701
My coat?

841
01:25:26,273 --> 01:25:28,229
May I see the baby?

842
01:25:36,233 --> 01:25:37,791
May I hold him?

843
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:40,986
May I hold him?

844
01:26:20,713 --> 01:26:21,941
Belinda.

845
01:26:24,793 --> 01:26:27,261
Would you let me take care of him?

846
01:26:28,513 --> 01:26:31,585
I mean, take him home just for a while.

847
01:26:33,233 --> 01:26:35,144
He'd be very happy,
he'd have everything he wants.

848
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:37,747
You could see him whenever you like.

849
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:39,630
Please let me, just for a little while.

850
01:26:39,713 --> 01:26:41,624
You have all this work.

851
01:26:42,553 --> 01:26:45,909
Why not, Belinda? I only want to help you,
can't you understand?

852
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:01,781
Just sign here. Just make a cross.

853
01:27:22,953 --> 01:27:25,148
If you don't give him to me,
they'll come and take him.

854
01:27:25,233 --> 01:27:28,191
Belinda, listen, please! Let me take him.
I won't....

855
01:27:47,873 --> 01:27:50,103
-What's happened?
-Locky, I can't do it.

856
01:27:50,193 --> 01:27:51,421
What are you talking about?

857
01:27:51,513 --> 01:27:53,629
He's ours, been given to us,
all legal and proper.

858
01:27:53,713 --> 01:27:54,828
We must give him up.

859
01:27:54,913 --> 01:27:56,665
We're being mean, Locky,
mean to the Dummy.

860
01:27:56,753 --> 01:27:59,313
You think she had no feeling,
you should see her with the baby.

861
01:27:59,393 --> 01:28:02,226
We just can't take him, she's his mother.

862
01:28:02,513 --> 01:28:03,912
His mother.

863
01:28:04,593 --> 01:28:07,346
Well, let me tell you something.
I'm his father.

864
01:28:08,473 --> 01:28:09,542
What?

865
01:28:09,633 --> 01:28:12,193
His father, I'm telling you!
He's as much mine as hers.

866
01:28:12,273 --> 01:28:14,628
Locky, I told you to keep away from her.

867
01:28:14,713 --> 01:28:18,103
It's all over and in the past.
Unfortunate it is, it happened.

868
01:28:18,193 --> 01:28:20,912
A man wants children and I want him.

869
01:28:21,993 --> 01:28:25,588
Something in here wants him.
By the Godfrey, I'll have him !

870
01:28:37,633 --> 01:28:39,225
Where's the kid?

871
01:28:41,073 --> 01:28:42,825
Get out of the way.

872
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:13,393
It is the duty of the Crown Prosecutor...

873
01:30:13,473 --> 01:30:15,987
to present the facts
which will prove to you...

874
01:30:16,073 --> 01:30:20,430
that beyond a doubt,
Belinda MacDonald is guilty of murder.

875
01:30:21,313 --> 01:30:23,383
This is a difficult case...

876
01:30:23,553 --> 01:30:26,784
due to the unfortunate circumstances
of the accused.

877
01:30:26,873 --> 01:30:30,912
But you and I, gentlemen,
must not allow these circumstances...

878
01:30:30,993 --> 01:30:34,702
to bring about an undue amount
of sympathy for the accused.

879
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:40,143
A murder has been committed
and the full penalty must be paid.

880
01:30:44,793 --> 01:30:47,626
Is there any reason you know of,
Mrs. McCormick...

881
01:30:47,713 --> 01:30:50,466
why she should have killed your husband?

882
01:30:56,513 --> 01:30:57,582
No.

883
01:30:58,593 --> 01:31:00,743
-Your witness.
-No questions.

884
01:31:01,593 --> 01:31:03,106
Miss MacDonald.

885
01:31:05,153 --> 01:31:06,984
When the McCormicks...

886
01:31:10,033 --> 01:31:12,547
arrived that afternoon...

887
01:31:13,353 --> 01:31:16,982
is it true that you were
in the house alone?

888
01:31:24,433 --> 01:31:26,230
Does she understand?

889
01:31:36,113 --> 01:31:37,228
Well, what did she answer?

890
01:31:37,313 --> 01:31:40,305
She's not answering my question.
She hasn't answered any of my questions.

891
01:31:40,393 --> 01:31:43,146
All she says is,
''I want my baby, I want my baby.''

892
01:31:49,153 --> 01:31:51,826
There, ''Tell them
to give me my baby, please.''

893
01:31:51,913 --> 01:31:54,586
The defendant obviously
doesn't want to answer the question.

894
01:31:54,673 --> 01:31:55,992
My Lord...

895
01:31:56,073 --> 01:31:58,985
under the circumstances,
the defendant is naturally confused.

896
01:31:59,073 --> 01:32:01,792
Apparently she does not understand
the interpreter.

897
01:32:01,873 --> 01:32:04,945
Since she was trained in the sign language
by one of the witnesses...

898
01:32:05,033 --> 01:32:06,671
Dr. Richardson...

899
01:32:06,833 --> 01:32:09,506
would it be permissible
for him to translate for her?

900
01:32:09,593 --> 01:32:12,630
-Permission granted.
-Dr. Robert Richardson.

901
01:32:23,473 --> 01:32:27,307
Would you mind facing her directly
so that she can read your lips?

902
01:32:30,353 --> 01:32:32,628
Were you alone in the house...

903
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:35,393
when the McCormicks came to see you?

904
01:32:36,753 --> 01:32:38,471
Did you understand?

905
01:32:42,553 --> 01:32:43,781
''I was with my baby.''

906
01:32:43,873 --> 01:32:46,467
After you attacked Mrs. McCormick
and she ran out--

907
01:32:46,553 --> 01:32:47,872
I object, My Lord.

908
01:32:47,953 --> 01:32:50,945
The defendant has not admitted
attacking Mrs. McCormick.

909
01:32:51,033 --> 01:32:52,352
Objection sustained.

910
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:54,708
I'll phrase the question differently.

911
01:32:54,793 --> 01:32:57,512
After Mrs. McCormick left,
what did you do?

912
01:32:57,593 --> 01:33:00,585
Isn't it true that as soon as she left
you went to get the gun?

913
01:33:05,033 --> 01:33:06,386
''I was very much afraid.''

914
01:33:06,473 --> 01:33:08,145
So you did take the gun deliberately?

915
01:33:08,233 --> 01:33:09,427
Objection!

916
01:33:09,513 --> 01:33:11,344
The defendant has made
no such admission.

917
01:33:11,433 --> 01:33:12,422
My Lord--

918
01:33:12,513 --> 01:33:14,868
If the Prosecution will be patient,
I might be able to help.

919
01:33:14,953 --> 01:33:17,786
Please try to understand
what it means to be as she is...

920
01:33:17,873 --> 01:33:19,784
living in a world apart,
shut off from everyone...

921
01:33:19,873 --> 01:33:21,704
never hearing the warmth
of a human voice.

922
01:33:21,793 --> 01:33:23,704
Think of the loneliness and the fear.

923
01:33:23,793 --> 01:33:27,502
These people, although tutored,
are governed almost solely by intuition.

924
01:33:27,593 --> 01:33:29,823
Belinda's been instructed
in certain fundamentals.

925
01:33:29,913 --> 01:33:31,266
-She knows right from wrong...
-My Lord--

926
01:33:31,353 --> 01:33:34,663
...but something in her was stronger than
the precept, ''Thou shalt not kill.''

927
01:33:34,753 --> 01:33:35,902
My Lord, I object.

928
01:33:35,993 --> 01:33:40,032
Dr. Richardson is completely out of order.
He's not the counsel for the accused.

929
01:33:40,113 --> 01:33:43,389
Your Lordship, I insist this girl obeyed
an impulse older than the laws of man:

930
01:33:43,473 --> 01:33:46,465
The instinct of a mother
to protect her child.

931
01:33:46,873 --> 01:33:48,864
Any further breach of your capacity
as interpreter...

932
01:33:48,953 --> 01:33:51,786
I shall hold as in contempt of this court.

933
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:54,351
Objection sustained.

934
01:33:54,433 --> 01:33:55,343
Now please proceed.

935
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:00,824
When did you get the gun?

936
01:34:01,073 --> 01:34:03,303
After Locky McCormick came in?

937
01:34:04,073 --> 01:34:05,392
''Yes.'' Why?

938
01:34:10,193 --> 01:34:12,548
''I was afraid he would hurt my baby.''

939
01:34:12,633 --> 01:34:14,669
And that was your only motive?

940
01:34:14,753 --> 01:34:17,187
Was there any other reason
why you were afraid of him?

941
01:34:17,273 --> 01:34:20,106
Your Lordship! The interpreter,
in rephrasing my question...

942
01:34:20,193 --> 01:34:21,785
is trying to coach the defendant.

943
01:34:21,873 --> 01:34:24,103
This man is totally unqualified.

944
01:34:24,193 --> 01:34:26,787
He's deeply involved in the case himself
and I can prove it.

945
01:34:26,873 --> 01:34:28,670
May I present new evidence?

946
01:34:28,753 --> 01:34:31,586
-Has it any bearing on this testimony?
-It has.

947
01:34:31,673 --> 01:34:33,391
Permission granted.

948
01:34:36,513 --> 01:34:39,391
Dr. Richardson, in your earlier testimony...

949
01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:42,988
didn't you deny being the father
of Belinda MacDonald's child?

950
01:34:43,073 --> 01:34:45,143
-I did.
-Did you write this?

951
01:34:45,393 --> 01:34:46,382
I did.

952
01:34:46,473 --> 01:34:48,828
I should like to read a passage
from this letter.

953
01:34:48,913 --> 01:34:51,347
''...physician takes a lot more time....

954
01:34:51,553 --> 01:34:53,544
''Work is hard. Be here soon.

955
01:34:53,633 --> 01:34:55,589
''I have found a house for us.

956
01:34:55,673 --> 01:34:58,506
''It is small but it has
a beautifully sunny room...

957
01:34:58,593 --> 01:35:00,470
''for our little son.''

958
01:35:03,913 --> 01:35:07,508
I challenge this man's integrity
as a witness and as an individual.

959
01:35:07,593 --> 01:35:09,982
His actions speak for themselves.

960
01:35:10,193 --> 01:35:13,185
Betraying this girl, ignobly fleeing scandal.

961
01:35:13,593 --> 01:35:15,584
He's laid himself open
to a charge of perjury.

962
01:35:15,673 --> 01:35:19,029
His very appearance here is an affront
to the dignity of this court.

963
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:21,786
He has violated the ethics
of an honorable profession.

964
01:35:21,873 --> 01:35:24,023
He should be stricken
from the medical register...

965
01:35:24,113 --> 01:35:26,343
expelled from decent society.

966
01:35:26,433 --> 01:35:28,230
No! No!

967
01:35:31,753 --> 01:35:33,550
It was Locky's fault!

968
01:35:33,633 --> 01:35:37,467
It was him, Locky. He's the baby's father.
It was his fault!

969
01:35:38,393 --> 01:35:40,953
He told me
the day we went to get the baby.

970
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:43,024
I wanted the baby but...

971
01:35:43,753 --> 01:35:46,142
somehow when I saw her with him
I couldn't.

972
01:35:46,233 --> 01:35:49,430
I said, ''We shouldn't, it's mean,
she's his mother.''

973
01:35:49,513 --> 01:35:51,902
And he said.... He said:

974
01:35:53,513 --> 01:35:55,151
''I'm his father.''

975
01:36:07,233 --> 01:36:10,225
In this court's opinion,
the evidence is incontrovertible.

976
01:36:10,313 --> 01:36:12,190
That she acted in defense of her home...

977
01:36:12,273 --> 01:36:14,867
against a man
whose guilt has been proven.

978
01:36:14,953 --> 01:36:17,023
The court expresses the hope
that the jury's verdict...

979
01:36:17,113 --> 01:36:19,752
will stand as a reminder
that justice in this Dominion...

980
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:21,903
will always protect the private citizen...

981
01:36:21,993 --> 01:36:24,427
against those who would interfere
with his rights...

982
01:36:24,513 --> 01:36:26,947
and his dignity as a human being.

983
01:36:31,393 --> 01:36:34,032
I'm glad that it turned out the way it did.

984
01:36:49,233 --> 01:36:52,350
I know, Belinda.
You don't have to say anything.

985
01:38:02,593 --> 01:38:03,662
English

986
01:38:04,305 --> 01:39:04,697
