I'm sorry, is this seat taken?

16
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,652
Oh, um,

17
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,567
well, I was saving it for someone,
but he's late, so go ahead.

18
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,657
Thanks, and who's that?

19
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,207
-My husband.
-Aww.

20
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,632
Oh. Oh, well,
he shouldn't keep you waiting.

21
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,878
Yeah, he's a bit of a prick like that.

22
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,461
-Always working.
-Hmm.

23
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,456
[Michael laughs]

24
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,928
Can I, uh...
Can I buy you a drink?

25
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,548
Maybe something a little harder?

26
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,514
Yeah, okay. Um, I'll take a--

27
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,425
Old Fashioned? Something?

28
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,715
Good guess.

29
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,637
Well, I have my moments.

30
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,896
Excuse me, hi.
Can I have an old fashioned with Bulleit?

31
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,109
And a dirty martini with three olives?

32
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,531
[Jean] Thank you.

33
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,073
So, what does he do, this, um...

34
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,821
husband of yours?

35
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,411
-He's a lawyer.
-Ooh, yikes. God, sorry.

36
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,502
No offense, but those guys, man.

37
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,115
-They're the worst.
-I know.

38
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,916
-So by the book.
-Mm-hmm

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,170
You seem way too free-spirited
to be with a lawyer.

40
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,207
-Yeah, maybe I am.
-Yeah.

41
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,295
I think you need more of a visionary.

42
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,934
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

43
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,850
Hmm.

44
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,272
-How do you know?
-Oh, it's just what I do.

45
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,347
Really? And what is it you do?

46
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:05,977
I'm an architect.

47
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,569
-Ah.
-Can you tell by the shirt?

48
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,229
Yeah.

49
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,111
I always wanted to meet an architect.

50
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,855
And now, you have. What does it feel like?

51
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,825
Yeah, it's good.

52
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,793
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

53
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,580
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

54
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,752
-So nice to meet you.
-So nice to meet you, too.

55
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,876
-You're married, huh?
-No, no. I just never...

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,390
you know, found the right...
the right woman.

57
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,095
You believe in that?

58
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,140
I don't know, I mean...

59
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,597
Used to.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,070
Well, I'm sure you have plenty of hot
young women throwing themselves at you.

61
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,494
You're a handsome, powerful architect.

62
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,281
You think I'm handsome?

63
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,199
Maybe.

64
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,661
Well, I do have options.

65
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,959
But it seems that, um...

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,670
that the woman that I want is taken.

67
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:13,843
Well...

68
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,839
that just makes it more fun, doesn't it?

69
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,006
Only if you're willing to break the rules.

70
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,596
I never said I was faithful.

71
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,018
Oh, I see.

72
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,731
And, um...

73
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,941
does your husband know?

74
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,527
He's too busy to notice.

75
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,656
But, you know, trying to control myself.

76
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,746
I think.

77
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,079
So, do you work?

78
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,167
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-You do?

79
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,592
-I mean, sometimes, yeah.
-Really? What do you do?

80
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,423
A musician, actually.

81
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,878
Oh, wow.

82
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,546
-Yeah, not really the pop star type,
-That's cool, okay.

83
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,554
but just more of the-- I write songs.

84
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,524
-Even so, that's, um--
-[laughing]

85
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,482
That's really...

86
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,352
fucking hot.

87
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,396
And unexpected.

88
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,858
Oh, good. Well, I like to surprise you.

89
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,820
You know, every time I come here,
they give me a really great room,

90
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,532
if you wanted to go...

91
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,696
upstairs.

92
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,906
Um, well...

93
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,202
See, we'd have to be quick, 'cause--

94
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,246
Can I get the check, please?
Thank you.

95
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,634
Oh, I never did ask you your name.

96
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,344
Sidney.

97
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,889
[heavy breathing]

98
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,323
[both breathing heavily]

99
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,582
[grunting]

100
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,958
You like that, Sidney?

101
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,063
[electric razor buzzing]

102
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,413
Hey.

103
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,751
Hi, sleepyhead.

104
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,000
Come here. I don't want this to be over.

105
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,295
Aww. Well...

106
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,760
Hey, don't do that! I have to go to work.

107
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,300
[kissing]

108
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,005
I don't have a patient till one, come on.

109
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,018
-Mmm.
-Come on.

110
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,519
Order some breakfast, okay? And relax.

111
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,771
[groans]

112
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,732
I'll miss you.

113
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,185
Last night was amazing.

114
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,612
-It was really amazing.
-I know.

115
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,618
It was very, very amazing, but...

116
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,199
I'm glad that we're not those people.

117
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,378
I really like who we are.

118
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,741
[door opens]

119
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,646
[phone ringing]

120
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,860
[man] Room service.

121
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,164
Hello. Hello?

122
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,547
Hey.

123
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,970
Swanky choice.

124
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,340
-Yeah, I just had a meeting.
-Sure you did.

125
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,063
Oh, here.

126
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,768
You can order whatever you want.

127
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,980
Yeah, it's really not my scene.

128
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,274
[laughing]

129
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,277
But I'm sure these people would come
to Brooklyn and say the same thing.

130
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,581
-Oh, my.
-Mm.

131
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,617
-They look good on you.
-Oh, yeah?

132
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,915
-Good morning.
-Hi, she's gonna have--

133
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,014
Pancakes, please.

134
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,469
And I'll take
an egg white omelet, please.

135
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,234
[Sidney] You know, um...

136
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,226
You didn't even kiss me "hello."

137
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,611
I assumed we're past that stage
after the other night.

138
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,403
That was quite a kiss.

139
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,323
Hmm. Well, uh...

140
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,954
Maybe we should go upstairs?

141
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,746
-What?
-Well, you invited me here,

142
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,288
I assume you have a room.

143
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,634
That was... quite an assumption.

144
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,878
I, uh, told you I had a meeting.

145
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:28,708
With who?

146
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,548
An architect. He's redesigning this place.

147
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,840
I'm writing a piece on him.

148
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,636
What's he like?

149
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,637
Well,

150
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,523
at first glance, you probably wouldn't
find him all that interesting, but...

151
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,268
He's deep.

152
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,481
And thoughtful.

153
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,403
The kind of person you see and think,

154
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,358
"I just wanna be around you."

155
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,701
Maybe I'd like him.

156
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,912
Yeah, maybe you would.

157
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,924
Hey, I'm really sorry,
but I actually have to run.

158
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,133
-What's going on?
-I have to pick something up.

159
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:17,085
Oh, well, I have a little time.
I could come with you.

160
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:20,932
Sure.

161
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,310
If you fancy an adventure.

162
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,635
Miss? Your bag.

163
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,023
Oh, uh, yeah. I'll pick it up later.

164
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,567
[sighs]

165
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,401
-And you say that I lie.
-It's nothing.

166
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,987
-It's just--
-No, no, it's cool.

167
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,783
Just a different kind of meeting.

168
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,879
[exhales]

169
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,335
How was the hotel?

170
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,970
It was great.

171
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,215
Great, thank you. Um...

172
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,143
It was good to get away.

173
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,397
I'm sure.

174
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,727
Hey, Alexis.
Do you think I could pass as an architect?

175
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,765
What?

176
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,068
No, I mean if you met me at a bar
or something like that,

177
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,203
would you believe that?

178
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,373
I mean, I guess.

179
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,834
Are you considering changing careers?

180
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,701
Maybe in another life.

181
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,463
I'm gonna need you
to book flights for Texas.

182
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,382
I explained to them,
it's impossible to do this second-hand.

183
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,882
[Alexis] I'll get on it. Who's going?

184
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,545
It's me, you and Scott. Jeanie won't come.

185
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,675
You'll cover for both of us,
if that's okay.

186
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,258
Totally.

187
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,853
Mr. Architect.

188
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,058
[chuckles]

189
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,103
[quietly] Yeah...

190
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:54,572
I'll just be a few minutes.
You can just hang here if you want.

191
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,158
It's way too hot in here. [exhales]

192
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:09,754
[dog barks]

193
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,549
[dog whimpers]

194
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,397
This isn't your place.

195
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,191
Yeah, it's Sam's.

196
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,200
I hope you're not mad,
but Stevie's my dog, too.

197
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,789
Well, why don't you just talk to him?
I'm sure he'll be reasonable.

198
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,291
I literally asked to take him
for the weekend, that's it.

199
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,670
He was being such a dick
this morning, so fuck it.

200
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,723
[Sidney]
I'm just gonna grab his leash.

201
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,298
Uh...

202
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,731
God, you look so scared.

203
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,389
How do you know he's not coming back?

204
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,556
Sam's had the same routine forever.

205
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,654
We're fine.

206
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:05,411
[stammering]
I, uh... I'm running late, so I gotta run.

207
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,908
Maybe we can go
to your place next time instead?

208
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,373
Maybe.

209
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,919
That is,
if you even have a place of your own.

210
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,297
Shit, I'm so sorry.

211
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:31,926
[sighs] Subway delays. I had to jump off
at 14th and run all the way here.

212
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,517
-Really sorry.
-[Gary] That's okay, Jean.

213
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,482
It's not like you to be late.

214
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,980
I know, I'm...

215
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,483
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

216
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,396
Oh, I uh... I kind of have a...

217
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:47,105
[laughs] Yeah, I can see that.
What happened the other night?

218
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,736
-What?
-I swear I saw you getting into your car

219
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,949
at the rehearsal studio.

220
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,754
Nope, I was home when you texted,
with Dolly and Michael.

221
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,174
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

222
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,999
Must've been my doppelgänger.

223
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:02,594
Ha. Your doppelgänger drives the same car.

224
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,468
-Claire!
-Jean.

225
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,894
Grab your coat.
Actually, we're gonna head outside today.

226
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,719
-We are?
-Mm-hmm.

227
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,845
All right.

228
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,099
[Claire] Thank you.

229
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,816
Oh, I don't have
the right clothes for this.

230
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:29,704
-It doesn't matter, today is just a trial.
-Well, I can't do this.

231
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,241
I mean, I did yoga for a little while,
but my hamstring--

232
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,236
It's okay.

233
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,037
It doesn't require physical strength

234
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,909
as much as it does
the mind's attention and focus.

235
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,207
Are you supposed to be
taking me out of the office?

236
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,040
Well, if I think it'll help,
it's at my discretion.

237
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,548
Oh, my friends are gonna be hysterical

238
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,509
when they hear I'm hanging
with my therapist...

239
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,129
-Claire, we're not hanging.
-doing meditat--

240
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,297
This is all part of your recovery.
Let's sit.

241
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:59,098
I think Rebecca will appreciate
your being open-minded

242
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,806
and trying something new.

243
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,560
Maybe you should tell her.

244
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:09,281
This is a meditation class focused
on letting go of anxiety...

245
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,241
and detaching
from our inner judgmental voice.

246
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,905
Now, please close your eyes.

247
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:22,844
The world will not come to an end
because you are taking time for yourself.

248
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:29,343
Notice how your breath flows in and out.

249
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,216
We all have noise in our head.

250
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:38,484
But today,
I would like you to release yourself...

251
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,100
from the excessive thoughts,

252
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:46,227
your thoughts that build up and up.

253
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:53,742
So the continuous habit of thinking turns
into a worried kind of chatter.

254
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,244
[Gary]
Though, it's not like you to be late.

255
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:02,041
[instructor] There is no need
to control thoughts or thinking.

256
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,254
[Sidney] Maybe we can go
to your place next time instead.

257
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,634
[instructor] There is no need
to change thoughts or thinking.

258
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:09,923
[Sidney] That is, if you even have
a place of your own.

259
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:13,677
[instructor] Simply allow the thoughts
and observe them.

260
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:20,806
By acknowledging these thoughts,
they will dissipate and fall away.

261
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:21,773
Jean?

262
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,191
[instructor]
Do not give them more power.

263
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,152
[echoing] Jean!

264
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:32,242
Where they gain power,
will become important, like a secret.

265
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,358
[child screams]

266
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,117
You can't catch me.

267
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,536
You can't catch me!

268
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,038
Oh, yes, I will catch you!

269
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,996
Hey you! [playful growling]

270
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,463
[Dolly] Let go! People are over.

271
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:53,474
Ah, she's too old
to be wearing a boy's bathing suit.

272
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,759
-She's tough to reason with.
-Trust me, I know.

273
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,304
What's Sadie doing here?
I'm surprised she's allowed over.

274
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,389
Michelle couldn't get her from Holly's,
so I said I'd drop her off.

275
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,016
-Oh, cool.
-[Sadie] ♪ Daddy and Jacqueline ♪

276
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,442
♪ Sitting in a tree ♪

277
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,771
♪ K-i-s-s-i-ng ♪

278
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,856
Hey! Who's Jacqueline?

279
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,860
Daddy's friend. She's a waitress.

280
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,186
Oh.

281
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,867
You know, if Sadie was parading around
in a boy's bathing suit,

282
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,620
Michelle would be freaking out, too.

283
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,905
What is it that you're so afraid of?

284
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,503
I don't know. I just don't want life
to be harder for her.

285
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,922
[Michael] Oh, come on, honey.

286
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Life is hard for everyone.

287
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,085
We have to look at the big picture.

288
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,051
We can't control
who Dolly's gonna grow up to be.

289
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,841
Now you sound like the therapist.

290
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,933
I don't know why I'm having
such a hard time with it.

291
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,305
[sighs]

292
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:50,145
Oh, I forgot. I've gotta go to Texas
on Thursday for two nights.

293
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,949
-For the case?
-Yeah, it's unavoidable.

294
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,872
It's okay. I get it.

295
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,539
Guess you're not gonna miss me too much.

296
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,502
We always miss you.

297
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:29,607
[phone dings]

298
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,271
I'm so fucking mad.
Like I can't control myself.

299
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,482
Why don't you sit?

300
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:15,021
I come home yesterday, and she took him.
She stole my fucking dog.

301
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,445
-Are you sure it was her?
-Uh, yeah!

302
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,819
She was texting me all morning
about how it was unfair.

303
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,816
She didn't even want
the fucking dog in the end.

304
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:25,948
She liked the idea of having one,
but literally never fed him or walked him.

305
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,616
-She's the most irresponsible--
-Sam, just slow down.

306
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,874
I-I don't know what to do!

307
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,165
She used her old key
to break into my place.

308
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,539
I mean, maybe I should call the police.

309
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,915
-Sam, hold on a second--
-Who am I even protecting anymore?

310
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,264
She thinks I'm a worthless pushover,

311
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,220
but that's not who I'm gonna be anymore.

312
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,970
-No one's saying you're a worthless--
-I'm sick of her controlling me,

313
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,933
keeping me in the wings like
I'm some bullshit fan she shits all over.

314
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,144
I'm telling you, I could fucking kill her!

315
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:52,482
Sam.

316
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,606
I have to ask,
it's part of my job to report

317
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,441
if you're a danger to yourself
or to others.

318
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,277
Do you really think I'm capable of that?

319
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,873
I just need you to be honest.

320
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,372
Even if there's an ounce of truth.

321
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,669
I wouldn't even know how to anyway.

322
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,054
I know you're angry,
and you have every right to be.

323
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,313
Is it really worth getting
the police involved, all this drama,

324
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,691
if you can't even really prove it?

325
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:37,151
One of my neighbors saw Sidney
and another woman leaving.

326
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,646
It must've been Diane.

327
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,573
I bet it's a turn-on for her to try
to fuck a woman in her ex's apartment.

328
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,238
And I found these.

329
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,880
And I'm supposed to go on a date
with Emily tomorrow.

330
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,547
To catch up.

331
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,626
I think I'll cancel.
I'm really not in the mood.

332
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,268
I understand you're panicking...

333
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,902
but digging into this matter is
just another form of fixation on Sidney.

334
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,233
Instead of it being how in love you are,

335
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:23,323
you're just getting preoccupied
with the dog.

336
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,069
When, really,
this could be a real positive.

337
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,873
What? How?

338
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,500
This is your chance
to break free from Sidney.

339
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,788
Now, I know how much you love Stevie,

340
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,915
but that dog is just a reminder
of the heartache.

341
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,132
It's impossible for you to move on.

342
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:48,009
Don't cancel your date with Emily.
In fact, this is great timing.

343
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:52,345
Go out. Have fun and see for yourself.

344
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,766
You don't need Sidney to make you happy.

345
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,442
Hey.

346
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,105
Come here.

347
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,473
[phone ringing]

348
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:33,926
Um, Lex?

349
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,601
Alexis?

350
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,783
-I hope you didn't think it was cheesy.
-Not at all.

351
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,032
Is that true about your father?

352
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,736
Unfortunately, yeah.

353
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,411
-Ooh.
-We're all set for Texas, by the way.

354
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,463
They didn't have any high-end hotels,
so I booked the closest thing.

355
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,921
Kinda like a Holiday Inn,
so don't get too excited.

356
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,586
No, that sounds great.

357
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,180
Oh, um, thank you for reading.

358
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:10,931
Means a lot.

359
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:18,310
[woman] Logan's been coming home crying
about how Spencer told him

360
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,353
that he can't be a part
of the Super Boys Club

361
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,317
unless he starts to dress
and act like the other boys.

362
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:27,488
Spencer made him eat sand the other day
to prove that he's worthy.

363
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:32,821
They also compared penis sizes
to determine who could join.

364
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,156
I mean, they're eight.
It sounds like a fraternity!

365
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,833
I'm sorry, but I can't tell Spencer
who to be friends with.

366
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,082
[woman] Well, you have to talk to him
about not forcing other kids

367
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,915
to do things that are dangerous.

368
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,842
Lindsay, have you spoken to Spencer
about disbanding this group?

369
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:49,172
They'll just find another way
to choose their friends.

370
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,553
We all know kids are tough at this age.

371
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:54,135
Sorry, can I interject here?

372
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,891
Modeling's a huge way
that kids learn to be social.

373
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:02,856
I mean, there are clear lines
being drawn, even here.

374
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,596
Jean, could you speak more to that?

375
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,863
Well, the truth is, bully or victim,
the feeling's just the same.

376
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,358
It's insecurity and fear.

377
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,909
And we've all got things
to be vulnerable about.

378
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:16,872
Fears of losing something,

379
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,662
whether it's your best friend
dropping you for the new kid,

380
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:20,996
or your husband...

381
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,370
having an affair with the waitress.

382
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,423
So, why don't we just be
a little bit more compassionate here

383
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,502
and less judgmental?

384
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:33,644
And maybe you should get
Logan and Spencer together for a playdate.

385
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,549
I mean, who knows?

386
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:39,056
That level of animosity might mean
they actually could be great friends.

387
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,692
I think that's pretty sound advice.

388
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:43,936
Lindsay, are you open to that?

389
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:13,051
-Oh, hey, honey.
-Hey there, hey.

390
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:16,137
-How was the PTA meeting?
-I killed it.

391
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,353
Oh, really? Look at you, power mom.

392
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,771
-I know, right?
-My, my, my.

393
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,901
All we have to do
is get Dolly signed up for soccer

394
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,808
and then you'll be a real soccer mom.

395
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,357
[Jean laughs]

396
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,993
-How was your day?
-You know, whatever.

397
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:37,869
Coming up?

398
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:41,584
Yeah.

399
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,666
-Mommy!
-Hey.

400
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:59,052
-I learned how to crow.
-You did? Let me hear it.

401
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,765
[mimics rooster]

402
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,639
[laughing] Oh, my God.

403
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:05,731
That's incredible.

404
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,191
And Sadie's gonna be Tinkerbell.

405
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:14,532
Oh, well, I think you would be
the perfect Peter Pan.

406
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,320
Hey, Sweetie.

407
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,579
Do you wanna be part
of the Super Boys Club?

408
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:26,252
No. I think it's stupid.

409
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,130
You're right.

410
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,959
I think it's pretty stupid, too.
[chuckles]

411
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:43,022
-[Jean] I love you.
-I love you, too.

412
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,164
[Jean] So, I just got done
playing my show at Rockwood,

413
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:10,791
and, uh, someone mentioned that
you were waiting backstage for me.

414
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:31,185
Hi, Paul. It's Jean.

415
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:35,941
Listen. I have to be away
on Thursday and Friday,

416
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:38,776
so, unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to reschedule.

417
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:42,374
So, can you call me back
when you have a chance? Thank you, bye.

418
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:46,329
[Larin] Hey, you.

419
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,671
Oh, hey. Sorry, I was just
rescheduling an appointment.

420
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:50,958
Are you guys going away?

421
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,581
-I'll have some.
-Um, yeah...

422
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:53,918
I--

423
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:57,208
No. Michael has to be in Texas for work,

424
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:01,087
-so I figured I'd just hang with Dolly.
-Oh, thank you.

425
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:06,973
So, apparently,
Darrell has a new girlfriend.

426
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,273
I think she's like 14 or something.

427
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:14,305
-Or like 29, but still, man, it's...
-God.

428
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,775
-Michael mentioned she was younger, but--
-Wait...

429
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,735
You guys knew?

430
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,275
Well, no.

431
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:24,534
He just said that Darrell was texting
with someone and--

432
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,866
Jean, if it was reversed,

433
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:31,002
[stammering] I would've called you.
I would've called you immediately.

434
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,131
You're right. I was preoccupied. I'm--

435
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,826
-It's just a pretty big thing to forget.
-I know, I'm sorry.

436
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,587
Hey, I'd love to get your guys' opinion
on this situation.

437
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,092
-What's up?
-Whose?

438
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,184
My cheater.

439
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,300
Oh, I have your notes on Allison,
by the way.

440
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:45,465
-Oh, great, thanks.
-Thank you.

441
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,931
I now think there's a lot more
to the story.

442
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,679
I think he could be a sociopath.

443
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,687
I hate when people throw that word around.

444
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,347
Yeah, but if the shoe fits...

445
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,815
[Hunter] In his case, it might be true.

446
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,070
He told me
he sees a blind man in the street

447
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:04,164
and enjoys watching him struggle.

448
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,240
Had to teach himself
to pretend to feel things.

449
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:08,739
Those are pretty big signs.

450
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:10,907
I wouldn't be so quick to label.

451
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:16,084
No, because you think all people exist
in a gray area. Don't you?

452
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,625
No, I just think,
given we're professionals,

453
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,423
we should reserve judgment.

454
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:27,218
Well, what's even more intriguing is
he tries to manipulate me.

455
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:28,474
How so?

456
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,845
Well, like when he told me
about cheating on his fiancée.

457
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,310
But I later found out
he's been cheating for years.

458
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,601
Maybe he's just not ready to face it yet.

459
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:39,145
I don't know. I think people need
to own their circumstance,

460
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:42,823
and it's actually our job
to hold them accountable.

461
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:46,617
Right, but you can't force
a patient to be...

462
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,201
truthful with himself.

463
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,751
Or anyone, if they're not ready.

464
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:55,788
I think you're underestimating
the importance of honesty.

465
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,926
[bubbling]

466
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:11,641
Hi.

467
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,098
Happy to see me?

468
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,650
How can I help?

469
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,359
What?

470
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:24,192
What, your colleagues don't know
you make house calls?

471
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:27,068
-That was extenuating circumstances.
-So what's the problem?

472
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:28,664
What do you want?

473
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:30,913
[Allison] Jean.

474
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,044
Sorry, I...

475
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,633
Let's begin.

476
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:55,675
[Allison] It's my fault.

477
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,977
I said I wouldn't talk to him
unless it was in front of you.

478
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,316
[Tom]
I'm confused why you're seeing her at all.

479
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:03,776
You know, my buddy's a shrink.

480
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:08,025
-He sends his addicts to rehab.
-I'm not an addict anymore.

481
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,069
She still uses.

482
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:14,328
I thought you came here to try
and win me back, not be an asshole.

483
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,374
Why are you here, Tom?

484
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,543
She just told you.

485
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:26,758
She won't see me... without you here.

486
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:31,177
I guess she's scared.

487
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:48,195
Not normally big on therapy.

488
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,410
I mean, you're the ones
that are more fucked up than me.

489
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:57,448
If you're gonna be disrespectful,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

490
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:00,958
Tom.

491
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:03,668
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,880
I, uh--

493
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,880
You know, I act out when I'm angry.

494
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:12,638
You should be with me.

495
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,142
I mean, you know that, don't you?

496
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:18,137
Baby...

497
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,016
Hey...

498
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:25,646
I won't get all crazy.

499
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,782
Just come home already.

500
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:32,735
I miss you.

501
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,123
You know how good we can be together.

502
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,449
Allison, where are you living right now?

503
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,538
At a friend's on her couch.

504
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:44,922
Amber's a crackhead.

505
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:46,916
She's not a good influence.

506
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:49,005
And you are?

507
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:57,143
You're an adult, Allison,
and you can make your own decisions.

508
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,323
I don't think you're good for me.

509
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:10,688
[scoffs] Baby--

510
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,357
I don't think you're good for me.

511
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,241
-Hey.
-You heard her.

512
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,656
I think you should leave.

513
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,121
Are you okay with that, Allison?

514
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,394
Fucking joke, the both of you.

515
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,965
You think she cares about you?

516
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,694
I'm the only one who actually
gives a shit about you.

517
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:47,864
-Not your mom, not her!
-Okay, Tom...

518
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:59,197
And you? You're gonna get
what's coming to you, lady.

519
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:01,794
Just hope you enjoy the ride.

520
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,548
[Alexis] Michael Holloway's office.

521
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,554
Hi, Alexis. It's Jean. How are you?

522
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:02,966
I'm good.
He's actually still in with Allen.

523
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,136
Ah, okay, um...

524
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:09,813
Well, if he can't reach me,
tell him I'll be home after dinner.

525
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:13,572
-I'm just going into another session.
-Cool, I will.

526
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,690
Okay, great. Thanks.

527
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:25,365
[Sam]
Is this weird? I hope this isn't weird.

528
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:28,674
Honestly, I was a little surprised
that you wanted to meet up.

529
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,173
Why?

530
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,964
'Cause you and Sid, like,
fell off the face of the Earth

531
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:35,046
when you ran off together.

532
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,170
We didn't--
I mean, we didn't run off together.

533
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,133
Whatever.

534
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,233
I just feel like
I'm finally getting my life in order,

535
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:49,059
and you were really important to me.

536
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:52,648
Yeah, me too.

537
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,740
So, what happened with Sidney?

538
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:01,822
I mean,
you didn't tell me the other night.

539
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,445
Oh, um...

540
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,042
We were ultimately just too different.

541
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:11,325
That's all.

542
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,042
It's hard to understand the full story
from the outside, you know?

543
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:20,429
I mean, if you're gonna be a barista
into your late 20s...

544
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,760
it's just not cool.

545
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,345
I mean, she's still pursuing music.

546
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,599
Oh, come on. She's never gonna be
smart enough for you.

547
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:31,559
I don't mean to be rude, but...

548
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,284
she really fucked me over.

549
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,777
You did, too.

550
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,115
But I have made amends.

551
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,660
I just...

552
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:51,712
I think that...

553
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,669
she just sucked you in.

554
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:59,585
She's bewitching,
but she'll fuck you over...

555
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:02,886
when she's on her next obsession.

556
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:07,562
[elevator bell rings]

557
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:15,017
Can't believe you left work
in the middle of your shift.

558
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:18,895
Oh, whatever. You don't think
it's my dream to be a barista forever.

559
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:19,824
[chuckles]

560
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:21,902
As long as I can make rent, I'm fine.

561
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:27,277
Plus, I have this demo thing which might
actually be the thing that takes off.

562
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:30,664
And what about your future?

563
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,955
-What do you mean?
-Well...

564
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:38,091
If things don't work out with music,
what's your backup plan?

565
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:40,707
Well, you can't plan for the future,

566
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:42,877
'cause you don't know
what the future holds.

567
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:48,088
Unless you have some crystal ball you've
been hiding somewhere I don't know about.

568
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,387
-[Sidney laughs]
-That's not how people live.

569
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:52,765
I mean, sure, plans change,

570
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:55,601
but you have to have
some kind of direction, right?

571
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,567
Planning's a code
for making people feel safe.

572
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:00,688
It's not certain.

573
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:05,275
Nothing's certain, except for
whatever's happening right here.

574
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:07,663
In this moment.

575
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:23,006
That is real.

576
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,586
It's a tempting way to live.

577
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,144
It's the only way to live.

578
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:30,721
[both laugh]

579
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:34,979
Well, you don't have responsibilities.

580
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,480
-Like what?
-I don't know.

581
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:41,022
House, kids, things that make you
settle down, be an adult.

582
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,065
Do you have those things?

583
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,780
I mean, you say all this like
you're living some encumbered life.

584
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:51,367
Your stories don't exactly track, Diane.

585
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:57,456
I mean, you're a single woman
in your 40s, I presume,

586
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,875
who works freelance.

587
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,264
You should feel completely free.

588
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,970
Well, I guess I just live according
to how I think I...

589
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:09,851
should.

590
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,389
Well, stop.

591
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:15,602
Stop thinking about
what everyone else wants for you.

592
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,975
'Cause, eventually, they'll all fuck off.

593
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,940
And all you'll be left with...

594
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:25,824
is whether you were true to yourself.

595
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:39,165
-[chuckles] Don't stop on my account.
-Oh, no. No, it's okay.

596
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:44,254
You on, like, Tinder or Hinge or anything?

597
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,508
No, um...

598
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,510
I'm actually not trying
to jump into anything at the moment.

599
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:50,837
Hmm.

600
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,774
I'm actually texting my therapist,
since you seem so curious.

601
00:41:58,268 --> 00:41:59,518
You see a therapist?

602
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:01,977
That seems so unlike you.

603
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:05,284
[chuckles] Yeah, I know right?
Well, she's actually been...

604
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,490
really helpful through this breakup.

605
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:10,071
Feels like...

606
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:14,408
it would've been
too touchy-feely for you before.

607
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:15,703
Jean's different.

608
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,913
I mean,
she makes it enjoyable. She's, uh...

609
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:21,995
She's normal, like us, you know?

610
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:25,586
Is she cute?

611
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:27,131
Oh, what? You're jealous now?

612
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,634
-Please.
-I'm just curious.

613
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,513
I know you like those authority figures.

614
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:34,263
Actually, she's pretty.

615
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,178
-Really pretty.
-You are totally into her!

616
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:38,096
[Emily scoffs]

617
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:40,939
[sighs]
Jealousy's never been my strong suit.

618
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:41,846
Oh, I remember.

619
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,654
In Costa Rica, you got in a fight
with that random woman who was

620
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,651
-showing us around the coffee plantation.
-You were totally flirting with her!

621
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,864
-I was scared for my life.
-Shut up!

622
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:52,655
Oh, my God. [laughs]

623
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,496
Whoa. Hey, are you okay?

624
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,540
-[labored breathing] Oh, God.
-Okay, whoa. Okay, just stand here a sec.

625
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:03,634
Okay.

626
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,245
-You all right?
-[Jean] I don't know.

627
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:10,972
-I just feel dizzy, sorry.
-Okay, hey, can you walk?

628
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:14,045
Okay, we're just gonna
walk right over here. Yeah?

629
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:17,136
-I don't know what's happening.
-Sit right here. Right here. There we go.

630
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,563
-Okay, okay.
-I'm sorry.

631
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,351
It's okay, okay? Just breathe, it's fine.

632
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,185
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. I got you.

633
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,560
Just breathe, okay?

634
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:30,112
-I don't know what's going on.
-It's okay. Just take a minute, yeah?

635
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:31,744
[deep breaths]

636
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:34,819
Who's that?

637
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,033
[Sidney] Who?

638
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:40,541
-Diane? Look at me.
-Oh, God.

639
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:43,081
Okay, whoa.
Okay, should I take you to a hospital?

640
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:45,205
-No. No, I'm fine.
-Okay.

641
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:49,246
I just... I don't... Just need a second...

642
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:51,668
It's fine. Take all the time, yeah?

643
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,297
Shh...

644
00:43:57,346 --> 00:44:00,136
-It's Tom.
-What?

645
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:03,944
Tom. He must've... I don't know, I just...

646
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:05,849
Okay, just rest a second, okay?

647
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:06,858
[Jean groans]

648
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:09,359
Okay, breathe. It's okay.

649
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,821
-You're fine.
-Oh, God.

650
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,951
-I'm scared.
-Don't be scared. It's fine.

651
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:15,664
It's fine. I'm here.

652
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,950
-It's fine.
-[panting]

653
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,989
Can you-- Could you call--

654
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,339
Call Michael, please...

655
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:30,548
-Who's Michael?
-and tell him I'm gonna be late.

00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,929

what's your passcode, Diane?

00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:37,635

00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:39,175
I forget...

Three, six...

660
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:45,476
Okay, kid.
Just rest and relax a sec, okay?

661
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:47,476
I'll call later, okay?

662
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:50,728
It's fine. It's fine, okay?
