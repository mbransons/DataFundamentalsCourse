1
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,009
There was a time
I knew everything in the sky.

2
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,329
Every satellite...

3
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,688
every constellation...

4
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,690
souvenirs of space walks
and astronauts...

5
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,009
and rockets launched by NASA
in the '60s.

6
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,564
As a kid, I looked up
and felt the future.

7
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,768
It belonged to me.

8
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,529
Hey, hey, man, check this out.

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,000
Then 2008 happened.

10
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,247
Budgets crashed.

11
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,330
NASA was just another business
looking for cash.

12
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,164
The billionaires took over.

13
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,491
Satellite pirates with deep pockets,
drunk with the idea of ruling the world.

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,449
I left the military and took a job
with the biggest billionaire of them all.

15
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,962
Carson Welch. I went to the gray side.

16
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,249
Messed up bad in Kabul, Afghanistan,
broke about 18 bones in two legs.

17
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,522
Lost my gig.

18
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,882
For a year, I waited for scraps...

19
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,130
like a hungry cat
outside a seafood restaurant dumpster.

20
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,722
Finally, I got a crappy second chance.

21
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,810
- At least I was going back to Hawaii.
- Woody.

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,446
Just wanted to say hello
before we landed.

23
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,130
How you doing?

24
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,011
How's the contractor job going?
Miss the uniform?

25
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,725
Sometimes.

26
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,527
Heard you popped your balloons
in Afghanistan. Thought you were dead.

27
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,324
I'm excited about this gig.

28
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,126
I'm delivering a blessing
on a pedestrian gate.

29
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,365
Only in Hawaii, huh?

30
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,131
- Below the aloha exterior.
- Casablanca, baby.

31
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,684
Tracy's gonna flip out
when she sees you.

32
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,728
- Colonel Lacy?
- Yes, sir.

33
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,605
Are you aware
of the so-called Arrival myth?

34
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,089
- What's that?
- The calendars say...

35
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,046
that this week is the return
of the playful Hawaiian god Lono...

36
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,841
and he will wreak havoc in the sky
with the fire goddess Pele.

37
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,405
Mitchell? Hey. Okay.

38
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,080
Sorry. Sorry. He's a Hawaiian-myth buff.

39
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,645
Yeah, of course he is.

40
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,287
All right, Mitchell, be cool.
Relax and enjoy a bitching summer.

41
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,562
Make love not war, huh?

42
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,487
- Morning, captain.
- Morning, airman.

43
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,850
Good to go.

44
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,531
Well, shit. Looks like we're down
to dwindling resources, huh?

45
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,042
Colonel, I'm here to save you,
you great white obsolete whale.

46
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,686
After Kabul,
I'm surprised you can make a joke.

47
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,403
- Can I be honest? You look terrible.
- I've missed your psychotic hands.

48
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,484
Good times. When's the last time
we worked together?

49
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,688
- Silent Reaper?
- Jesus. Silent Reaper?

50
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,484
Yeah. It's been a while.

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,809
- How's your life?
- I got no life. You're my life, Fingers.

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,048
"You're my life, colonel."
Nobody calls me Fingers anymore.

53
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,210
I'm a big old deal around here.
Got my name on the wall.

54
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,966
I'm so powerful,
I'm erect just thinking about it.

55
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,884
Present arms!

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,125
Of course, the old ex-girlfriend.

57
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,002
Pause for the memories.

58
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,283
She handles all these ceremonies
around here now.

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,688
All right, Gilcrest, I want to introduce you
to your Air Force liaison. A fast burner.

60
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,171
F-22 pilot on loan to Space Command
for "career broadening." Yep.

61
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,762
Decorated two years ahead of schedule.
General Dixon's favorite.

62
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,883
Meet your watchdog.

63
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,491
Enjoy.

64
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,365
Captain Allison Ng, sir.
I know you have a meeting.

65
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,642
I'll take us on a flyby of the island.

66
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,326
I'd like to take you
through how this is gonna work.

67
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,922
Hey! I refuse to talk to you.

68
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,851
Well, you just broke that promise.

69
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,606
Are you okay?

70
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,724
So good. Super, super good.

71
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,122
Woody never told me you were coming.

72
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,091
- He never tells me anything.
- Sir, if I may?

73
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,810
- He talked to me.
- Oh, yeah?

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,207
- Yeah.
- Because you're not married to him.

75
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,801
Hey, I called you five times last year.

76
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,731
- I was worried about you.
- You still in Forensics?

77
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,605
I'm head of the department.
I make my own hours.

78
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,087
Will you stop getting more beautiful?

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,526
An awkward silence lasts four seconds.
I'll end this in three.

80
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,449
Sir? If I may?

81
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,291
- You've gotta meet my kids.
- Yeah.

82
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,844
I'll be right back, captain.

83
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,849
Don't get lost now.

84
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,805
Never. Sir.

85
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,691
Tracy. Tracy. Tracy.

86
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,201
- I got my bag.
- Oh, so sorry.

87
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,729
Mitch. Mitch,
come out of the flag, please.

88
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,446
I want to introduce you
to Brian Gilcrest.

89
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,687
- Pleasure. Hey.
- Hey.

90
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,491
- Mitchell is 10 and Gracie's 12.
- Gracie. Brian.

91
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,809
- Brian and I haven't seen each other in...
- About 13 years.

92
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,731
Thirteen years. Right.

93
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,930
- Dad.
- There you are.

94
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,088
- Hey, Dad.
- You're back.

95
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,083
There she is.

96
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,127
- Are you the Arrival?
- No.

97
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,607
But in five days, sadly,
I'm the departure.

98
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,523
There's a blessing we're gonna
take care of on the new gate.

99
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,087
Gilcrest. Carson. Come on.

100
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,526
You know the deal.

101
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,927
Myths and bones and ghosts.

102
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,120
Well, hey,
why don't you come for dinner?

103
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,607
- Say yes.
- This week?

104
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,771
Say yes.

105
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,806
- Come on.
- All right.

106
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,801
- I'd love to.
- Yeah? Great.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,925
The house across the street from
the Officers' Club. It's the corner house.

108
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,249
So good. Super, super good. Okay.

109
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,165
Are you familiar
with the Hawaiian god Lono?

110
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,207
- No.
- In the Arrival myth, he saves Pele...

111
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,329
the Hawaiian goddess...

112
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,002
Look forward to hearing the rest
at dinner. Thanks for the lift.

113
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,525
- For you.
- Yes.

114
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,125
Yes, yes, yes.

115
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,081
This is very important for our book.
I wanna hear about your childhood.

116
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,520
Childhood.

117
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,405
That's nostalgia and a trap.

118
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,524
Carson, the new king
of space exploration.

119
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,802
Aloha, boys.

120
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,890
I saw your TED Talk on the way.

121
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,523
Oh, that.
Yeah, Bono talked me into that.

122
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,767
Oh, how is Bono?

123
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,085
As if I knew him. That's...

124
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,521
Everybody wants to launch a rocket.

125
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,121
Right. Sure.

126
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,887
Good at that.

127
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,246
Smooth.

128
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,563
Smooth.

129
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,201
It's good to be back.

130
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,927
Oh, God.

131
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,761
I didn't abandon you.

132
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,849
I saved you.

133
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,924
Let's do some great stuff here.

134
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,327
All right, start with the blessing,
and we'll move on from there.

135
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,965
Okay.

136
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,527
And welcome back.

137
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,083
Killed it.

138
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,691
Oahu traffic, Seneca 128.

139
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,565
Alpha-Romeo over Rabbit island,
2000 feet.

140
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,922
Our appointment
with the sovereign king...

141
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,205
and the head of the state of Hawaii,
Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, was rejected.

142
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,161
He's a fierce man, sir. He's a descendant
of King Kamehameha the Great.

143
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,528
I know Bumpy. I helped him get elected.

144
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,566
We've all worked together before.
And you don't have to call me "sir."

145
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,287
Sir, I will also be an invaluable addition
to our joint mission.

146
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,482
I am a quarter Hawaiian.

147
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,881
Call me "sir."

148
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,042
The Royal Aloha. Careful on those steps.

149
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,049
- I see them.
- I know about the leg.

150
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,481
Sir, I'd love to get a beverage.

151
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,286
Or a peppermint tea.

152
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,161
And discuss all kinds of stuff.

153
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,887
The sky. The future. Yeah.

154
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,607
Everything.

155
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,010
- I'm a peppermint-tea girl.
- You have a good time.

156
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,242
- I meant with you.
- Captain Ring, I...

157
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,922
it's Ng. It's like "ring,"
but without the R or the I.

158
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,605
It's just Ng. It's short.

159
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,529
Short. Short's good.

160
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,769
Small talk and conversation, Ng.
There's no time for it.

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,606
You are never going to offend me
by being blunt.

162
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,922
Handful of words, boiled down.

163
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,930
No more than five.
One, two, three, four...

164
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,724
- Five. Yeah.
- There you go.

165
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,161
Let this be our longest conversation.

166
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,443
Good evening, captain.

167
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,161
Warmest aloha, sir.

168
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,969
Okay, let's talk about Gilcrest.

169
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,328
So finally we meet, right?

170
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,006
This is a great story.

171
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,289
This is good. Yeah.

172
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,041
So much paperwork on this guy.
A surprising amount of paperwork.

173
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,449
Flirting with Pakistani princesses.
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,769
Something with the daughter
of Princess Hafa El Yassein.

175
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,850
- He got married and divorced...
- I lived a full life.

176
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,883
...from a fake heiress.

177
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,003
Oh, yeah. Homegirl took him down.

178
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,002
But before that all came apart,
there was greatness in this guy.

179
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,043
Oh, now you're gonna compliment me?

180
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,481
He's got kind of...

181
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,849
like a chilly presence.

182
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,526
Like, you look into his eyes
and it's miles of blue.

183
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,291
He's just a brilliant...

184
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,440
compelling, innovative...

185
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,726
commanding...

186
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,121
Stop it.

187
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,166
...fricking wreck of a guy.

188
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,971
He's like a...

189
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,208
A sad city coyote.

190
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,930
You know?

191
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,761
- Okay. I love you too, Mom.
- A great relation with your mother.

192
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,885
Hey, look up at 10:37 tonight because
there is a Jupiter-moon conjunction...

193
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,764
that you will not wanna miss.

194
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,291
Okay, good night.

195
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,961
A double espresso.

196
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,204
Morning, sir. I'm so jacked for today.

197
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,845
Make that a triple.

198
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,651
Thank you for the camaraderie, sir.

199
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,450
- I didn't say anything, captain.
- No, it's your manner.

200
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,282
I find your manner very down-to-earth.

201
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,884
You have links to the National
Reconnaissance Office, don't you?

202
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,243
Even if I was NRO, captain,
I couldn't tell you, but I'm not.

203
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,204
You were trained top to bottom...

204
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,971
on every aspect
of maintaining these birds.

205
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,685
How did you end up supervising
a gate blessing? If I may.

206
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,249
I'm sad.

207
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,849
You were listening?

208
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,965
I mean, honey...
I'm not even a guy who says "honey."

209
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,845
...you got a baritone built for Broadway.
- Shit.

210
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,044
- Oh, shoot. Shoot, shoot, shit.
- Well, which is it?

211
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,562
- Is it "shit" or "shoot"?
- I am deeply offended by myself, sir.

212
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,525
Let me ease you off
the shit-shoot mountain, captain.

213
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,803
I work for Global One.
Carson Welch is a private citizen...

214
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,368
who outfits struggling countries
with communications and freedom.

215
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,369
Private citizen?

216
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,767
Communications and freedom?

217
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,281
- I'll withhold my comment, sir.
- Good.

218
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,362
Don't text your father about the washer,
honey. He's in Kuwait.

219
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,847
Why is he always in the places
where the war is over?

220
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,530
Oh, I don't know, sweetie.

221
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,809
That's why your mom takes long walks.

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,971
Mitchell, time to put the camera down
and join the land of the living here.

223
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,208
What's different about you, Mom?

224
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,641
Your bad mood's not convincing.

225
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,370
Okay, drink water, not soda,
and I don't want you to eat too late.

226
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,770
Gracie, work on your formal dress like
we talked about. Mitchell, camera down.

227
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,327
Next sign of the Arrival:

228
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,161
Ancient Hawaiian spirits
begin to appear.

229
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,445
This place has a lot of mana.
That's Hawaiian for...

230
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,211
I know what it means, captain.
Power and spirit.

231
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,928
- We're stuck.
- No, we're not. I know a shortcut.

232
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,210
- Yeah?
- Right up that hill.

233
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,971
- Can you make that, captain?
- Oh, I can make that.

234
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,570
Do you need help?

235
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,444
Watch your step.

236
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,087
Do I need help?

237
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,408
Super good, captain.

238
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,523
Super, super good.

239
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,769
- Captain.
- Yes?

240
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,170
When we get to the Kingdom, I'm gonna
need Bumpy all to myself, you know that.

241
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,249
It'll be a beautiful dance, sir.

242
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,044
You know, I was once a dancer.

243
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,801
- I broke my tibia. Joined the Air Force.
- Yeah, well, I dance alone.

244
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,725
I'll back you up.
We all work together. It's life.

245
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,362
We got three wars going on right now.
We're not in Coachella...

246
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,007
waiting for the Molly to kick in
so we can writhe in the mud...

247
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,727
and wait for Tupac's hologram
to come on and make us feel things.

248
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,524
- Understood.
- Good.

249
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,451
You're cynical. I get it. I really do.

250
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,771
Call it what you will, captain. I go hard,
I go deep, sometimes, I break things.

251
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,564
Okay?

252
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,285
- Okay.
- There will come a point...

253
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,563
I'm gonna give you a look.
That means it's Brian's time.

254
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,000
Who's Brian?

255
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,288
I'm Brian!

256
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,171
"Miles of blue," remember?

257
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,167
You never had a partner?

258
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,166
I know your ex-wife gave you
the heave a year ago.

259
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,763
Hey. That'd be off-limits repartee for us,
captain. I lone-wolfed it all the way.

260
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,327
- That's who I am. End of speech.
- Understood.

261
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,370
By the way,
my ex-spouse did not give me the heave.

262
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,766
She met some rich guy
who sold comic books...

263
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,440
and in this economy,
that's enough to vaporize a marriage.

264
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,405
You get replaced
by a comic-book version of yourself.

265
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,446
Nobody wants to live where they are.
They wanna be in a fantasy. All right?

266
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,165
She gave me the heave.

267
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,004
Boy, did she blow it.

268
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,371
- If I may. And you have to know that.
- I know what you're doing.

269
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,483
You're not gonna pick my brains.
They're unpickable.

270
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,969
And your attempt to get under my hood
and ask barbed questions is, frankly...

271
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,770
Fantastic.

272
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,084
Thank you.

273
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,324
What is that?

274
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,886
I'm tempted to say menehune.

275
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,361
They're like Hawaiian leprechauns.

276
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,649
Or chipmunks. It's something.

277
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,486
There is a lot of mana up here.

278
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,485
Upside-down flag.

279
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,371
Symbol of a nation in distress.
We're here.

280
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,007
Nice shortcut, by the way.

281
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,050
Who this?

282
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,009
- You lost?
- Afternoon. Here to see the king.

283
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,924
You can stop right there.

284
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,491
We're...

285
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,844
I'm Brian Gilcrest.

286
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,171
That name will carry weight
with the king.

287
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,285
No?

288
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,570
There he is.

289
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,210
Love of country.

290
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,328
So, you're a paycheck warrior now.

291
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,410
Plaything of billionaires,
in bed with the military.

292
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,841
I just need a little help.
This is Captain Ng.

293
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,045
- Aloha, Captain Ng.
- Aloha.

294
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,049
Heard you blew up in Afghanistan.

295
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,288
You looked better when you were younger.

296
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,767
- Oh, thank you.
- So pale now.

297
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,843
Keith Richards looks like a teenager
next to you.

298
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,246
Okay. Okay.

299
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,967
One year, I went out and played poker.
Didn't do anything else.

300
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,607
Like, maybe five, six years ago.

301
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,609
First game was on a military base.

302
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,849
This black guy,
could've been 20-something years old...

303
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,881
and I'm like all anti-military, U.S.,
the whole thing, right?

304
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,004
He comes to me and goes,
"Uncle, you like warm water?"

305
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,410
And I go, "Right on, brother."

306
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,605
And that was it. That changed
my whole turn on military.

307
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,762
So a military? Bigtime respect for them
when they're doing the right things.

308
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,002
It's an honor to be here.

309
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,489
It's just a budget thing, Bumpy.

310
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,524
We're combining two bases
and moving the pedestrian gate...

311
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,810
and you can move the bones wherever,
not one tibia will be out of place.

312
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,162
We just need a 20-minute blessing.

313
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,402
My people respect you, and they want
your approval for the community.

314
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,802
- Carson Welch is...
- Sir...

315
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,843
Your people are crooks.

316
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,806
Children of white missionary
that stole our country in 1893. You get it.

317
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,403
Bumpy, mohe, my old friend,
this is your nation, but we are in America.

318
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,568
Yeah, under military occupation.

319
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,489
You're on the wrong side, brah.

320
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,646
You hungry?

321
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,730
Great to see you. Aloha.

322
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,807
Come on, brah.

323
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,125
The word is,
something big coming through.

324
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,767
Gonna threaten the whole world.
Something in the sky.

325
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,041
Weapons, maybe.

326
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,844
- Don't know anything about that.
- No. No, king.

327
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,281
- Captain.
- That would be a violation...

328
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,966
of the Outer Space Peace Treaty of 1967.

329
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,170
The sky belongs to no one country
and no weapons shall exist in the sky.

330
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,843
The sky is sacred.
The shelter over all of us.

331
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,202
Working for the military here,
I am authorized to offer the Kingdom this.

332
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,200
Fourteen agriculturally-perfect acres
on the other side of this mountain.

333
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,084
Now, Sunday...

334
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,003
Sunday at 10, we swing a ceremony.

335
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,522
Couple of guys in the garb,
little hula-hula, blow the horn.

336
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,569
We all work together.

337
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,207
No, brah. Grab some food,
listen to the music and go home.

338
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,207
How can we make this work, Bumpy?

339
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,244
- He says two mountains.
- What?

340
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,488
- Two mountains.
- Captain, please.

341
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,445
- What?
- My kupuna says the two mountains...

342
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,723
the two at the foot of the valley.
In good faith.

343
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,331
I can't...
I can't give you back Hawaii, Bumpy.

344
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,842
And free cell-phone service.
We don't get but one bar.

345
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,089
- In fact, we hardly get that.
- I can't do that.

346
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,762
- You're making it impossible for me.
- Take it or leave it.

347
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,449
- King.
- Captain.

348
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,761
I believe in our land and our myths
and our traditions...

349
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,008
and more than anything, in the sky.

350
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,329
- What are you doing?
- This is not the military of old, Bumpy.

351
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,726
This is the new.

352
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,720
And you have my word,
as a member of the 15th Airlift...

353
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,491
of the United States
Air Force Space Command...

354
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,366
that we will not put weapons
above these sacred islands.

355
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,005
You can trust me.

356
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,201
Bumpy, I'm sorry.

357
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,209
Will you do one thing for me?

358
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,801
- Of course.
- Can I hear "Waimanalo Blues"...

359
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,650
- ...in the style of Gabby?
- Sure.

360
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,611
I used to have a cassette version
and I lost it...

361
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,366
and I crave it,
and I know they can play it.

362
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,364
I guarantee it. Let's do that.

363
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,005
Okay.

364
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,483
Yeah.

365
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,925
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

366
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,000
- Sorry.
- Okay.

367
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,043
- Free cell service and...
- Half a mountain.

368
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,561
- Two mountains.
- No cell phone, one mountain.

369
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,969
- Three mountains, no cell phone.
- Two mountains, cell phone.

370
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,528
- We're there. You're tough.
- Tough? I gave you everything.

371
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,206
- Hey, I didn't wanna give it.
- Thanks for bringing the car up.

372
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,768
- Yeah, brah, no problem.
- This is our sovereign flag.

373
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,964
My gift to you because we always ohana.

374
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,448
I felt a lot of mana
from the two of you tonight.

375
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,290
Especially you.

376
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,047
Thank you, king. I'm deeply moved.

377
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,764
Warmest aloha, Mr. Kanahele.

378
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,411
Sky has a lot to say tonight.

379
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,890
Stick around.

380
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,805
You're gonna skin your knees
on eternity, brah.

381
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,129
- Love of country.
- Love of country.

382
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,243
- Love of country.
- Love of country.

383
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,049
Never fuck you over, brah.

384
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,600
I think the sky is speaking to us.

385
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,211
Something's coming.

386
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,569
You know this is all metaphorical.
This is how Hawaii works.

387
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,922
We speak money,
they speak myths and sky...

388
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,521
but the sky doesn't actually speak...

389
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,290
and give an opinion.

390
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,282
That was all about land,
cash and cell phones.

391
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,325
Nothing's sacred.

392
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,329
It's all for sale.

393
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,011
Tell me you don't believe in the sky.

394
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,844
You think it's just air up there?

395
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,482
It's the future.

396
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,441
That is the pull of the unknowable.
That's the answer to every question.

397
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,887
Let's just keep it to the gate
and the blessing.

398
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,687
Cell phones, mountain,
blessing on Sunday.

399
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,041
Aloha.

400
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,210
February 11, 1983,
I asked for a telescope.

401
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,491
My dad drove to the Meade
telescope company in Long Beach...

402
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,489
and got me this maroon scope.

403
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,603
That was the summer
of the iridium flares.

404
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,281
The iridium flares?

405
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,840
It's the glint of the first satellites.

406
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,724
A lot of them are dead now...

407
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,845
but still streaking across the sky,
picking up the light of the sun.

408
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,202
Where has that guy been?

409
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,763
Stop the car. Stop. Stop the car.
Stop, stop, stop.

410
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,689
- Look down. Look down.
- You okay?

411
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,241
- What is it? What is it?
- It's the night marchers of Waimanalo.

412
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,126
Ancient tribal warriors that are
paying respect to their ancestors.

413
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,208
They're looking for their burial sites.
Show respect by looking down.

414
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,846
You can't look up or you're cursed
because you're not Hawaiian.

415
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,690
I'm aware of the myth.

416
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,771
It's probably just a reenactment.

417
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,083
Just making sure we're still alive.

418
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,607
Are we?

419
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,961
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

420
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,846
I miss Dad.

421
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,407
I always miss Dad.

422
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,329
But he's gonna be home tomorrow.

423
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,605
And Brian Gilcrest is coming over.

424
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,849
Let's get you something to eat.

425
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,003
Thanks, Hannah. Have a good night.

426
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,685
Thanks, Mom.

427
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,167
My dad was half Chinese, half Hawaiian.
And my mother is Swedish.

428
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,330
She's of Swedish descent,
so I am a quarter Hawaiian.

429
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,251
How great that they met.

430
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,087
They had so much fun together.
They really did. What else can I do?

431
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,688
Put the wings on this platter
and take it out, along with the salt.

432
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,769
- That would be fantastic.
- Perfect.

433
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,689
- That looks good.
- Thank you.

434
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,764
You wore the uniform.

435
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,161
Came from work.

436
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,840
Filling out a report on me?

437
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,601
- We shared an apparition last night.
- Reenactment.

438
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,448
I salute your elaborate system
of denial, sir.

439
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,647
- Hey, Spielberg.
- Don't look into the camera.

440
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,446
- Okay. Is your mother in there?
- Yep.

441
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,291
Yep.

442
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,765
Hi.

443
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,841
Would you like a beer?

444
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,926
- No?
- I'm okay.

445
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,561
- I'll ease into it. Do you have a soda?
- Yeah.

446
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,570
- I'll take that.
- Here you go.

447
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,001
That's lovely.

448
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,282
Thank you. Very thoughtful.

449
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,446
- I apologize in advance for Captain Ng.
- Oh, my God, are you kidding?

450
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,968
She showed up early and helped me
with housework. I wanna keep her.

451
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,322
She tell you
she was one-quarter Hawaiian?

452
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,608
Yeah, like 50 times.

453
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,202
Why don't you just have what you want?

454
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,125
What? Well, do you have what you want?

455
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,405
Your dad is Johnny Woodside.

456
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,607
I'm gonna teach
you Woodside children to salute.

457
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,330
It's something that you know.

458
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,124
Cut at the corner of your eyebrow...

459
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,210
and then drop it back down
the center line.

460
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,167
Straight up. And back down.

461
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,725
Mitchell, put your camera down.
I gotta see your salute.

462
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,600
You've got it now on film forever.
Here we go.

463
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,248
- He's got everything on film.
- Ready?

464
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,451
Just go up the middle line of your body
and drop it back down.

465
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,850
But up strong.

466
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,166
And drop.

467
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,364
You gotta be strong with it.
That was a little bit wobbly.

468
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,842
You're gonna slice the air.

469
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,128
Up to the eyebrow. Good.

470
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,288
And, with some power, drop back down.

471
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,323
I'm getting the hang of this.

472
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,488
And here we go.

473
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,810
Slice up. Straight up.

474
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,002
And drop.

475
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,641
That's good.

476
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,886
- I am gonna have that beer.
- Okay.

477
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,127
In answer to your question,
Woody doesn't speak.

478
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,842
But you know what? He's a great dad.

479
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,882
I don't think I'm ready
to talk to you like a girlfriend...

480
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,169
so just stop me
before I talk to you like a girlfriend.

481
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,489
He is a great dad.
He's a really great dad when he's here.

482
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,162
And he got us this corner house,
and I really don't wanna lose it.

483
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,320
So things are good.

484
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,325
I'm not sure if it's supposed to make it
easier with him, you know, flying...

485
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,048
to all these confidential locations
and not being able to tell me or...

486
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,164
I'm just... I'm stressed. I'm stressed.

487
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,081
I'm stressed all the time.
And if I'm stressed in Hawaii...

488
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,602
I mean, can you imagine
what I would be like somewhere else?

489
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,681
You even recognize the girl who ran
through Sheppard's Field naked...

490
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,884
- ...after a Cure concert?
- Who could forget that girl?

491
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,766
- You know what?
- What?

492
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,401
Don't ever have any regrets.

493
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,683
- I'm totally girlfriend-ing you right now.
- I like it.

494
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,127
I don't even remember why we broke up.

495
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,366
Because you didn't show up
on our vacation.

496
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,528
I didn't mean to actually
talk about that.

497
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,842
I had three days planned
in San Francisco.

498
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,489
I had things for us to do and things
to tell you, and you stayed in Guam.

499
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,806
Guam? Really?

500
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,762
Don't pretend like you don't remember.

501
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,201
I've waited for this.

502
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,081
- If you calm down, I'll try and remember.
- I'm calm. This feels good.

503
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,971
Hey, you know what, I do remember.

504
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,131
You said, "if you don't show up,
then that's it."

505
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,642
Because you're a workaholic
who creates work to avoid real work.

506
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,330
I'm still working on that.

507
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,969
But to me, you see,
a vacation can't be an ultimatum.

508
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,846
How can you relax on an ultimatum?
The whole concept is stressful.

509
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,407
You just had to show up.
I was looking for a gesture.

510
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,086
It didn't have to be bold,
just something.

511
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,441
I just wanted you to show up.

512
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,805
Hey.

513
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,000
I really loved you.

514
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,085
And you wrecked everything.

515
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,848
All our plans.

516
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,201
Loose plans.

517
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,646
And I put it back together by myself.

518
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,801
I found a life in spite of you,
and you need to hear this...

519
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,925
because I've waited a long time
to tell you this. You need to hear this.

520
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,406
Maybe not all of it.

521
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,251
You can't just let people go.

522
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,248
- Okay, do you see what I mean?
- No, he said a lot, actually.

523
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,487
What did he say?

524
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,684
Well, for starters, he said:

525
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,768
"Good evening. Welcome to my home."

526
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,726
Then he walked over to me and put
his hand on my shoulder and he said:

527
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,720
"I know you used to see my wife."
And then somewhere in there he said:

528
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,890
"Check out my manliness.
I've been working out." Right?

529
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,163
- And then... Right?
- I don't know. I don't know what he said.

530
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,089
No, that was the order. Yes.

531
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,363
He closed with, "I moved in
the second she was available...

532
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,404
and I'm too handsome and happy
to ever see you as a threat.

533
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,171
Good evening."
Then he left with his beer.

534
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,170
- He said all that?
- And more. He's very talkative.

535
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,284
- Mom?
- Oh, honey.

536
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,884
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

537
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,690
How's this for winter formal?

538
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,124
I don't want her
to get one minute older.

539
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,810
- I like the sleeves.
- I like the sleeves.

540
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,770
Wow, she looks just like you.

541
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,849
Thank God.

542
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,927
Mr. Gilcrest?

543
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,965
Cool room.

544
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,730
Thanks.

545
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,730
- The Corona Borealis constellation.
- Yeah.

546
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,447
- Nice collection.
- Thanks.

547
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,404
My man.

548
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,368
That's very interesting.

549
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,846
That's a lovely couple.

550
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,929
Did you almost marry my mom?

551
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,647
Many, many times.

552
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,124
Why would anybody break up with my mom?

553
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,891
- What's that?
- That's The Arrival.

554
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,209
The Arrival.

555
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,165
The fourth and fifth signs
are lining up.

556
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,886
Sacrifice and the healing of his wounds.

557
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,441
Are you Lono?

558
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,530
How does the myth end,
so I know how to plan my summer?

559
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,122
The Arrival myth ends
when Pele claims Lono...

560
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,201
and takes him to her volcano
for a thousand years of...

561
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,125
revenge sex.

562
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,288
To be eased only through eruption...

563
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,368
and the creation
of the next Hawaiian island, Loihi.

564
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,606
Then you become raindrops.

565
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,448
That's not a bad deal.

566
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,046
- Mr. Gilcrest?
- Brian.

567
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,010
Brian.

568
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,888
You are Lono.

569
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,809
- Just flip it around.
- You wanna see it? Here.

570
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,650
I'm so touched by the hula.

571
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,644
Aren't you?

572
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,202
It's just such an expressive gift.

573
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,927
My teacher tells me
that my arms are the problem.

574
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,288
No, not a problem.

575
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,365
Don't think about your arms.

576
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,686
Just address the land and the sky...

577
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,649
Woody, you ready?

578
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,245
- Fixed?
- ...and the water.

579
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,851
Fixed.

580
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,364
She's got a wicked hula.

581
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,969
Majorly, captain.

582
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,686
Beautiful.

583
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,360
Okay, everybody, let's do it.

584
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,123
I'm Lono.

585
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,209
I love him.

586
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,283
Dude, I love my lawn.

587
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,450
I know.

588
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,803
Love my lawn.

589
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,004
All right, you two.

590
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,445
- There you go.
- Thank you.

591
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,769
General Dixon. Shit is going on.

592
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,847
- Nice to see you.
- Happy holidays, general.

593
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,166
Good to see you, sir.

594
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,323
- Happy holidays, sir. How are you?
- Hello, general.

595
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,762
Get it, get it, get it. Yeah.

596
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,568
You guys want something to drink?

597
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,968
Yeah. I'll take a Kamehameha lemonade.

598
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,764
Same for you?

599
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,169
- Got it.
- I'll help.

600
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,241
Can I get two Kamehameha lemonades
and a Jack and Coke, please?

601
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,642
Can I have a beer, please?

602
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,605
Careful.

603
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,610
- Did you feel that?
- What's that?

604
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,723
They say the menehune come in
with wind...

605
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,122
and they haunt
the Officers' Club at night.

606
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,607
And they mess with the photos
of the old airmen.

607
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,367
Captain, come on.
Not every noe lani is a puka lani.

608
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,201
- Not every gentle mist is a gate to heaven.
- Nice.

609
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,004
What is the future?

610
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,730
The future isn't just something
that happens.

611
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,122
It's a brutal force
with a great sense of humor...

612
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,091
that'll steamroll you
if you're not watching.

613
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,085
But we're all gonna take a girls' trip
in her minivan.

614
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,810
- Great.
- Love it.

615
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,129
- We're leaving the kids and just going.
- Okay.

616
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,966
How is it that a high-ranking professional
is alone on the holidays?

617
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,246
Well, I don't hook up, I get deployed.

618
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,965
- Tell me about it.
- You know the truth.

619
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,563
I mean, two years is too long to keep
anything going, and I'd rather be alone.

620
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,003
It's been guys who are like me.
I call them "Alone Togethers."

621
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,647
- Maybe you should go civilian next time.
- Are you kidding me?

622
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,571
Can you think of a way
to make "I'm a fighter pilot" sexy?

623
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,366
Well, you just have to work
on your delivery, Ng.

624
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,688
I'm a fighter pilot.

625
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,008
Try going a little lower.

626
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,882
I'm a fighter pilot.

627
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,408
See, that's just strong stuff.
I think that just works.

628
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,125
Kamehameha. All right. I'm gonna...
I'll see you at the table.

629
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,166
- Out here. Out here.
- Thank you for the camaraderie.

630
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,331
- "Everybody Wants to Rule the World."
- Coming right up, sir.

631
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,689
Don't stand up, Gilcrest.

632
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,007
- On second thought, do stand up.
- It's good to see you, general.

633
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,966
Is it true you cut a deal with Bumpy
for the blessing?

634
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,521
Carson Welch is very impressed with you.

635
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,166
He's important to us,
so don't screw this up.

636
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:34,207
- Yes. Two mountains, cell phone service.
- Half a mountain, no cell phone service.

637
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,765
General Dixon, sir.

638
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,130
Gilcrest, don't give me
any more reason to dislike you.

639
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,288
I didn't know you disliked me.

640
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,081
Happy holidays, bottom feeder.

641
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,962
Happy holidays, general.

642
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,285
- What did you say to Dixon?
- I let him insult me.

643
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,883
He loves you. You are bringing
a very studly game to Brave Angel.

644
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,884
I want you to have this.
From Carson Welch's people.

645
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,770
It's a gift to give Brave Angel.

646
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,446
- Oh, what is it?
- New codes. That's all I know.

647
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,007
Welcome to your expanded
job description.

648
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,681
Carson wants to speak to you.
Wait in the hallway.

649
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,410
What, now?

650
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,765
Now.

651
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,244
Nice work, Gilcrest.

652
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,369
You're back in the bird's nest.

653
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,763
- What are we putting up there, Carson?
- We're doing things...

654
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,925
this country was built to do
before 20 layers of government...

655
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,565
- ...slowed us down...
- Okay.

656
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,162
...and let China kick our keisters
all over the Pacific.

657
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,330
We are taking command personally.

658
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,244
Yes, I was angry with you about Kabul.

659
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,011
I knew what was going on,
about the skimming.

660
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,601
I never thought twice about it.

661
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,407
But that money you pocketed
from the Afghanis, that was different.

662
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,491
You destroyed yourself for 100 lousy K.

663
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,168
You thought I never knew. I always knew.

664
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,644
- Carson...
- So, you're back in the game.

665
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,845
Now, if you can stay on track,
you'll find a way to get this done...

666
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,482
down and dirty, smooth like Indian silk.

667
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,282
And this crazy little Mayberry base...

668
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,848
will be the center
of a whole new operation.

669
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,242
TNO, Gilcrest. Tell no one.

670
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,926
You're back.

671
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,122
Captain Ng, this is Carson Welch.

672
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,810
Captain Ng.

673
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,528
Your reputation as a dancer
precedes you.

674
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,005
One, two, three, two.
One, two, three, two.

675
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,282
One, two, three, two.

676
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,482
One, two, three, two.

677
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,809
Happy New Year, Carson. There you go.

678
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,364
Cheers. Cheers.

679
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,164
Excuse me. Excuse me.

680
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,968
God bless America!

681
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,769
Bless you.

682
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,567
Thank you.

683
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,529
What you doing?

684
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:48,082
E-mails, trying to bail
my brother out online, parking tickets.

685
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,767
Are you dressed?

686
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,644
No, I'm not.

687
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,491
Yes, you are.

688
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,325
Hey, about tonight, sir...

689
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,646
Yes, captain?

690
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,325
- ...I had fun.
- Fun is good.

691
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,921
And some shots.

692
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,162
Are you kidding?

693
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,569
I danced with the devil, and I liked it.

694
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,162
Well, captain,
I will tell you this for sure...

695
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,524
in any of its many forms,
I have found that nothing beats fun.

696
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,761
Maybe purpose.

697
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,404
Do you wanna come over?

698
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,449
That's peppermint tea.

699
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,964
Thank you.

700
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,764
Hey. Have you seen the latest spec
of all the birds we have up in the sky?

701
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,807
- No.
- Can you imagine all of this...

702
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,724
with weapons?

703
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,326
What?

704
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,409
Oh, that's my dog. Hold on.

705
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,443
That's my mom and dad.

706
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,244
This, with weapons.

707
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,363
All those dots are satellites.

708
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,722
It's like a celestial traffic jam.

709
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,084
I mean, if we can't look up and see purity
or promise, we are finished.

710
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,328
That's why we have a space treaty.

711
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,687
What are all those stickers
on your unit?

712
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,726
Well, there's one
for each adventure, captain.

713
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,605
Do any of those adventures wear dresses?

714
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,043
Some. Some are for missions
and some are for cities.

715
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,562
What's the yellow one?

716
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,010
That's...

717
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,643
the Helena Project.

718
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,010
I love the Helena Project. I mean,
I knew that you studied black holes...

719
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,524
and Geodymetric physics, but I didn't
know you pioneered sound transducing.

720
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,247
I was sound transducing when
you were still in a ballerina costume.

721
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,930
The use of sound in space.

722
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,804
Why is that so exciting to me?

723
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,729
Yeah, good times.

724
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,771
I've never been shot.

725
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,570
You've never been shot?

726
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,081
- That's a good thing.
- Prepare me.

727
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,850
What's it like?

728
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,204
Well, captain, I feel that question
in about 18 different parts of my body.

729
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,050
Me too.

730
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,922
They say that you can tell
most of the time by the sound.

731
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,727
A well-aimed shot from a weapon
sounds like nothing else. It's like...

732
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,810
Home-run ball coming off the bat.

733
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,127
Boy, did I mess up in Kabul.

734
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,447
I was surrounded
by all this brutal ugliness.

735
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,164
Philanderers.

736
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,649
Nothing black and white.

737
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,406
Soul-crushing mercenaries.

738
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,728
And I was one of them.

739
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,965
I saw that missile coming for me,
and I didn't get out of the way.

740
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,807
I didn't care.

741
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,128
You lost your iridium flares.

742
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,411
Tonight...

743
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,526
it's kind of the first night
I'm truly happy I lived.

744
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,003
Gilcrest.

745
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,284
- Really?
- I'm a major select, sir.

746
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,764
I'm at a crossroads
where I can't mess up.

747
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,490
And I don't wanna wind up
a decal on your laptop.

748
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,442
Because I couldn't breathe.

749
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,611
All flattened out there
with everybody else, so it's...

750
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,082
Wanna see something
you've never seen before?

751
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,408
I think I left my sunglasses
at the Kingdom.

752
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,568
Oh, that's a tough asset to lose.

753
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,087
Can't stop looking at it, can you?

754
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,522
It's mesmerizing.

755
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,007
- Just try and look away.
- I can't.

756
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,929
It's impossible.

757
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,840
It was the Sudan. It was me and two guys.
We stepped on a PBD mine.

758
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,769
There was a horrible doctor...

759
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,850
and he sewed one of the guy's toes
onto my foot.

760
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,650
- What?
- Yes.

761
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,969
That's another guy's toe? Oh, my God.

762
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,810
Yeah, if you look closely...

763
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,611
you'll see the entire
Middle Eastern conflict on my leg.

764
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,081
Feels like we're in the room
with another person.

765
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,850
We are.

766
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,610
I believe everything you say.

767
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,481
Well, you shouldn't.
I'm a contractor, nothing more.

768
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,721
Here I am complaining
about my sunglasses.

769
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,208
And here I am complaining about nothing.

770
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,962
Come on, let's move!

771
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,685
Morning.

772
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,007
Hey, Hula. Happy Saturday.

773
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,010
- Hey.
- Are your parents home?

774
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,089
I just wanted to thank them
for the other night.

775
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,441
They're not home.

776
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,483
I am stuck babysitting the baby.

777
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,323
- Shut up.
- Hey, baby.

778
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,564
I'm kidding. Can I leave a note?

779
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,364
- Of course. Come in.
- Okay.

780
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,691
What are you watching?

781
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,211
Some footage that I shot.

782
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,562
You shot this?

783
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,801
Holy mackerel.

784
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,323
What do you think it is?

785
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,650
Look at the size of that thing.

786
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,968
It seems very sophisticated.

787
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,447
This is a big covert operation.

788
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,768
I bet the whole Pacific is in play.

789
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,291
When did you shoot this?

790
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,851
Middle of the night.

791
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,122
Two nights ago.

792
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,687
Butt-kick, stick it to the back. Nice.

793
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,163
I called you because I think
I have to tender my resignation.

794
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,365
- Is "tender" the right word for that?
- Come on. It's Saturday. Don't do this.

795
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,722
I'm sorry to disturb your Saturday.

796
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,003
I got Troy and Melissa here.
I got a girlfriend's kid, Don.

797
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,850
Have you met a baby named Don?

798
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,122
No, sir. Hi, Don.

799
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,085
Come on. This feels more
like a Monday kind of thing.

800
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,921
- Tell me everything you know.
- I don't know what's going on up there.

801
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:19,011
It's not an Air Force launch. They let me
know what they want me to know.

802
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,164
Private money's running the whole thing.
We work for them.

803
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,442
This is the new military, captain.

804
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,404
Kesha could launch a satellite.

805
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,843
She doesn't have to tell us
what's on it either. No treaty for that.

806
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,721
This one looks like a dual-purpose
launch vehicle that will amp up...

807
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,804
a worldwide rush
to fill the skies with weapons.

808
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,401
I didn't get the memo on that.
We don't know what's on this launch.

809
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,682
If that's true, we're in worse trouble
than I thought.

810
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,487
Don't resign, all right? You'd have
better luck talking to privateers.

811
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,688
Contractors are running everything.

812
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,451
Global One is running the lead
on this operation.

813
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,564
- It's Carson Welch's rocket.
- Gilcrest?

814
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,402
How much does Gilcrest know, sir?

815
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,683
Now that he's back with Welch,
how much does he not know?

816
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,728
You know what? I'll take that hat too.

817
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,566
Oh, boy, am I a goner.

818
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,046
Hello, sir.

819
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,288
Hello, captain.

820
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,970
It is a victory and an honor
to steal you away this afternoon.

821
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,961
Got you a peppermint tea.

822
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,921
Oh, the hat.

823
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,051
You must be wondering about this hat.
This hat serves no purpose.

824
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,403
The entire idea of including sunglasses
in the actual hat...

825
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,807
is ridiculous and unwieldy in execution.

826
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,201
Yet somehow...

827
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,327
you lost your sunglasses
and somebody stole your badass look.

828
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,049
Anyway...

829
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,041
you may now wear the hat.

830
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,604
I understand your reluctance.
I know what it represents.

831
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,882
My first civilian gift to you.

832
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,321
And what do I really have to offer you?

833
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,885
Everybody I've gotten close to, I've
managed to detach myself in some way.

834
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,841
And frankly, just floating
the idea of you and me as a couple...

835
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,607
all I see are problems.
I am talking about world chaos.

836
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,888
I'm talking about panic in the streets.

837
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,641
Demonstrations, riots, problems
with your promotion, strange incidents.

838
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,766
And let's just be honest,
it'll end as it began.

839
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,601
A flicker of an impossible dream
and an avalanche of emotional chaos.

840
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,723
And I'm sorry, but...

841
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,402
I'm in for all of it.

842
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,565
Is that a yes?

843
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,802
- I think I have an allergy.
- It's going around. You loving the hat?

844
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,641
I feel silly.

845
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,570
Well, you wear silly well.

846
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,201
I know what you know.

847
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,725
What?

848
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,809
Stop with the games.

849
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,407
Oh, my God. I got personal with you.

850
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,491
I never get personal.

851
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,887
- I had fun with you.
- Good.

852
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,282
- I believed you.
- Good.

853
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,285
That's...

854
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,922
- You told me not to.
- No, no, no.

855
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,646
That might be the worst part.
I believed you, and you told me not to.

856
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,963
- No. You got this all wrong.
- I didn't come here to argue.

857
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,721
You came to knife me in a gut-and-run.
I know the type. I am the type.

858
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,804
What am I saying?

859
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,524
I need you to believe in me.

860
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,251
I know what you know.

861
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,047
And what do I know?

862
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,601
You lied to everybody.

863
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,404
You knew about the launch.

864
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,001
You knew about that ASAT rocket.

865
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,249
You were distracting those Hawaiians
and giving them what?

866
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,727
Property they already owned
a thousand years ago?

867
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,363
- I don't have mountains to give them.
- You let me lie to the Hawaiians.

868
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,404
I'm Hawaiian. You lost your signal.

869
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,085
You are lost.

870
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,764
Hey!

871
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,529
Hey! Hey, I just wanted to say,
good luck with your career!

872
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,486
I'm sure you're gonna get NRO.
Find somebody else to recommend you.

873
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,330
- You think that's what this is about?
- You tell me.

874
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,921
I'm here
because you needed a babysitter.

875
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,162
I volunteered to be your watchdog.

876
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,081
I defended you when everybody said,
"You better watch out for that guy.

877
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,602
He's morally bankrupt and the guy
you get to do your dirty work."

878
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,167
Who's everybody?
Everybody in the streets?

879
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,251
In the world? Were they all gathered
at a mountaintop and sing to you?

880
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,250
Your cynicism is astounding,
Mr. Gilcrest.

881
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,769
Thank you for the hat, by the way.
It's a nice souvenir.

882
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,201
- Are there weapons in it?
- Just leave it.

883
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,166
- I was your last chance.
- Right, yeah, and you know so much.

884
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,683
And you knew everything.

885
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,288
You sold your soul so many times,
nobody's buying anymore.

886
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,843
Oh, hey, Dad.

887
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,404
Hey, Woody.

888
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,484
Can I get your autograph?

889
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,160
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

890
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,128
- Thank-you notes, huh?
- Yep.

891
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,290
- How was winter prom?
- Nice.

892
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,562
- Yeah?
- It was good. Yeah.

893
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,967
Except it's winter social.

894
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,089
Sorry, bunny.

895
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,930
How was work?

896
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,001
Yeah, good.

897
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,690
Okay.

898
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,810
And that's it?
That's all we have to say about it?

899
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,964
Yeah. Good.

900
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,449
Just gonna...

901
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,364
This is all Gilcrest's fault.

902
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,245
This is not Gilcrest's fault.

903
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,920
We had problems
long before Gilcrest showed up.

904
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,329
- Maybe it's not his fault, but I...
- But what?

905
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,930
What?

906
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,881
Just talk to me.

907
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,686
You don't talk to me.

908
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,322
Say something.

909
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,362
Woody,
I can't take this silence anymore.

910
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,803
You stay.

911
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,726
- I'm leaving.
- No.

912
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,851
No.

913
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,923
I'll go.

914
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,441
I'm always going.

915
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,961
All right, so...

916
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,730
I'll go.

917
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,529
Hello?

918
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,403
Are you leaving?

919
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,321
I got one more appointment with Bumpy,
then the gate blessing.

920
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,689
Grace, could you just go down
and check on your brother?

921
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,405
- Okay.
- Okay.

922
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,445
Okay, not so fast.

923
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:17,965
We have stuff to deal with before
the famous Gilcrest exodus. Look...

924
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,128
She's a great girl.
Woody is a lucky father.

925
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,809
Hey, I think that you came back here
for a reason whether you knew it or not...

926
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,731
- ...and I think you did.
- The Arrival is departing.

927
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,127
Hey, it's time, okay?

928
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,601
- You're going to tell me what I may know.
- What...? What is that?

929
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,805
Say it.

930
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,770
Just say it.

931
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,243
Let's just straight-up talk about it
before I explode.

932
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,125
- Let me ask you like this.
- Okay.

933
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,163
Let's say it's Father's Day.

934
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:56,802
Do I have something to celebrate or not?

935
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,170
You celebrate.

936
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,564
Okay.

937
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,841
Finally.

938
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,169
Come back! Come back! Come back!

939
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,451
Oh, my God.

940
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,961
There's a lot of you there.

941
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,604
Excuse you. Stop it!

942
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,689
Who else knows?

943
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,321
Well, let's see.

944
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,447
It's been me for 13 years.

945
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,721
Woody?

946
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,730
No, we never discussed it.

947
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,522
- But then... Yeah.
- The silent thing.

948
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,484
You could've had the discussion
without knowing.

949
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,489
Exactly.

950
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,128
He left last night.

951
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,243
He left?

952
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,081
- Was he angry?
- He decapitated Santa Claus.

953
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,726
Don't call me "bunny."
I don't like it. Stop.

954
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,250
Stop it.

955
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,284
I should go.

956
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,725
- Grace? Honey?
- Mitchell.

957
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,889
We're gonna go.

958
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,971
Stop teasing your sister.

959
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,810
Yes. Let's go.

960
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,360
I am standing
at the groundbreaking ceremony...

961
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,250
for the Hickam Air Force Base
pedestrian gate...

962
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,001
where ancient Hawaiian bones
will be blessed by local leaders.

963
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,522
Relocating the gate will enable
the Air Force's new partner...

964
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,929
Global One's Carson Welch,
to build new factories...

965
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,044
and fully privatize space exploration
from Hawaii.

966
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,084
And look at the excitement in the air.

967
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,610
- Shenanigans.
- Both of you, come on. Let's go.

968
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,600
Excuse me, lips moving.
Talking to you both.

969
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,081
We've been compromised.
We're moving up the launch.

970
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,886
- They need you. Carson asked for you.
- I'll do it.

971
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,971
Excuse me, is this happening now?
I am not a part of this. I will not be.

972
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,128
We are 20 minutes away from an incident.

973
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,321
I'll do it.

974
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,608
- What does she know?
- Too much.

975
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,644
- Can we drop her off?
- Hey! You guys are stuck together...

976
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,763
until DoD unsticks you.

977
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,645
DoD says the Chinese might have
hacked into the payload.

978
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,367
- They're not gonna cancel the launch?
- Thank you. Finally, a good idea.

979
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,928
It's already in motion. Carson has
the window. Time is a big factor.

980
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,367
- You're the guy to do this.
- He's past his prime.

981
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,722
- You peaked in dancing school.
- Enough!

982
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,410
- I'll do it.
- Good.

983
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,046
There's a black outpost
six minutes away.

984
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,971
Take it easy, brah. Relax.

985
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,801
It's a beautiful day for flight here
at our equatorial launch site...

986
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,483
134 miles south of Hawaii
in international waters.

987
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:59,203
The launch vehicle is ready for its most
direct route to geosynchronous orbit.

988
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,880
All systems are looking good
at this time.

989
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,323
The weather for today's mission is good.

990
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,690
Move quickly.
We have a room in the back.

991
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,326
Fingers.

992
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,921
They just pulled me onto this.
I thought we had till Monday.

993
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,322
You wanted back in the game.
This is the game.

994
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,807
- Who's in charge?
- Parts of all of us. Here.

995
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,283
- You work for Welch, don't you know?
- Everybody thinks I know everything.

996
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,643
- Welcome to my world.
- Everybody, turn off your jingle bells.

997
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,123
Let's bleach this hack. Who we got
at Kaena Point Tracking Station?

998
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,321
- We got Roy up there at HULA?
- Yeah. Hey.

999
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,321
- Roy.
- Hey, Gilcrest.

1000
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,210
Alive again, back from the dead.

1001
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,643
Enough of this make-out session.
Focus on the launch.

1002
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,524
- Carson. Carson for you.
- Yeah.

1003
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,564
- Welcome back to the driver's seat.
- At your service.

1004
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,889
We have a small window to gain control
of our cyber intruder.

1005
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:58,165
Yes, we do. So why don't you just
sit back and watch it happen, sir.

1006
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,845
- Never loved you more than I do now.
- You're gonna love me a lot very soon.

1007
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,208
Go ahead and launch,
and I'll grab the hack.

1008
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,448
Roy, can you get all the codes
on a monitor?

1009
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,722
- Yeah.
- Thank you for saving the world.

1010
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,406
- You're so welcome.
- Prepare for liftoff.

1011
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,809
Five, four...

1012
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,082
three, two...

1013
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,290
one.

1014
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,687
- Brian?
- Liftoff.

1015
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,170
Main engine continues
with nominal thrust.

1016
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,642
Begin control status.

1017
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,403
Final destabilization
established as nominal.

1018
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,210
Go, go, go.

1019
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,563
Propulsion system
performance status, nominal.

1020
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,601
Okay, all systems look good.

1021
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,690
Second stage. Main engine ignition.

1022
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,005
Carson.

1023
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,809
- Gilcrest.
- Have you done the job?

1024
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,004
- Did you bleach the hack? Is it gone?
- Reversing the panic code.

1025
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,971
Pinging it through the first transponder,
then out back through the system.

1026
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,089
Speak to me in subservient English.

1027
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,567
- Quiet.
- The Chinese hack, sir...

1028
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,564
is gone.

1029
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,564
- Outstanding, Gilcrest.
- Good save.

1030
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,091
Flight is now transonic.

1031
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,169
We are in orbit.

1032
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,048
Way to do it.

1033
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,804
- Excellent.
- Yeah!

1034
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,042
Second stage renewed.
Main engine ignition.

1035
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,568
In position and normal.

1036
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,806
- Roy?
- Yeah?

1037
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,850
Bring up the deck
from the Helena Project in '05, okay?

1038
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,687
Do a little old-school
sound transducing.

1039
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,402
- Sound transducing? Why...?
- Ask questions later. Just do it.

1040
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,806
Come on, Roy.

1041
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,889
- You got it?
- Got it.

1042
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,004
Okay, good. Send a message up there
to Brave Angel fast.

1043
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,362
Brave Angel? What are you doing?

1044
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,649
Prepare the deck for upload.
No time for questions. Do it.

1045
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,481
It's dangerous to spoof it with sound.
You could destroy the whole thing.

1046
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,284
- Yeah, exactly.
- We got it.

1047
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,960
Okay, I got it.
Prepare for upload of the asset.

1048
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,890
- What are you pinging it with?
- Every bit of recorded information...

1049
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,924
- ...in the history of sound.
- Jesus. That's a big ping.

1050
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,361
- The biggest.
- I see what you're doing...

1051
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,642
- ...and I'd advise against it.
- Release.

1052
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,888
Oh, God. You absolutely sure about this?

1053
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,367
- Roy, release.
- It is not easy being your friend.

1054
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,284
Release.

1055
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,286
Release.

1056
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,369
Do it.

1057
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,961
Hello?

1058
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:10,803
One of the most unique...

1059
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,367
- Yeah.
- I like that.

1060
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,883
We will see you...

1061
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,607
Yesterday, December 7th, 19...

1062
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,484
Welcome, travelers.

1063
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,966
No, no, no.

1064
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,724
On video with the sounds of man in...

1065
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,049
That's how we do things downtown.

1066
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,167
What is this?

1067
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,001
- Enjoy this speedy, easy way.
- Darn, darn, darn. Now, who...?

1068
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,404
No hot water, no toilets, no lights,
but Whitey's on the moon.

1069
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,204
No. Stop, stop, stop.

1070
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,529
- Let me in there.
- I've got no experience with this.

1071
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,046
This is crazy time.

1072
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,806
He hates these cans!

1073
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,685
Stay away from the cans!

1074
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,487
What's in the box?

1075
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,442
Stella!

1076
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,645
- You can't handle the truth!
- There's no crying in baseball!

1077
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,003
My God.

1078
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,929
Goodbye, Roy.

1079
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,685
You're gonna have to stay away
from me now. I'm radioactive.

1080
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,604
Well, this is gonna be a topic
of conversation.

1081
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,810
I'm gonna get some air.

1082
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,486
Yeah. Don't go too far.

1083
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:03,920
I'm on it, sir. Yes.

1084
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,244
Hey. You did the right thing, Brian.

1085
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,842
Listen to me. From this moment on,
don't get near me.

1086
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,929
- You can't stop me.
- Don't be naive. Save yourself.

1087
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:20,250
In five seconds, someone's coming out
and everything between us is over.

1088
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,448
You are just starting, I am finished.

1089
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,690
It's over.

1090
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,805
- You're late.
- Am I?

1091
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,049
I get it.

1092
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,686
I left you for dead in Kabul...

1093
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:09,011
and this is your pretty cheap revenge.

1094
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,370
Can't buy the sky, Carson.

1095
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,168
Let me get this straight.

1096
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,325
I'm the bad guy to you...

1097
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,445
because I'm trying to protect
our country...

1098
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,483
our American culture.

1099
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:31,651
You can't stop the future
with one silly, desperate act.

1100
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,125
I'll build another rocket.

1101
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,290
There was a second payload,
with weapons...

1102
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,847
and you almost got it by everybody.

1103
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:43,203
You're about to become
the single biggest joke...

1104
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:47,166
- ...in the history of aerodynamic flight.
- Can't hurt me, I've been dead before.

1105
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,488
Not like this, pally.

1106
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,881
Your life is gonna become very...

1107
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,084
very complicated.

1108
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,643
Just remember,
the general always speaks first.

1109
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,129
Don't say a word. You let him say what
he has to say, you sit there, you take it.

1110
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,561
Hopefully, the holiday spirit will
have him in a good mood.

1111
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,609
Happy New Year's, general.

1112
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,287
- Happy New Year.
- And the general is here.

1113
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,209
Gilcrest is here, that's why.

1114
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,367
- Well, I remember the good times.
- There were no good times!

1115
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:56,049
How does it feel to set back our footprint
in the Pacific by a decade?

1116
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,240
You cost us our prime new partner,
future missions...

1117
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,727
a new space-command center, all gone...

1118
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,208
because Carson Welch canceled
his contract with us. And why?

1119
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,200
Why did it all go bad?
Because cool guy here, Mr. Sexy Pants...

1120
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,887
Brian Gilcrest, lost Brave Angel!

1121
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,366
You did that.

1122
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,128
And now you're gonna go to the Hill,
and you are gonna testify.

1123
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,284
And, oh, it will not go well.

1124
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,441
The best you can hope for is some
trailer-park honey falls in love with you...

1125
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,564
on C-SPAN, and you get
a conjugal visit every other month...

1126
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,604
always in the presence
of a chaperone named Tex.

1127
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,245
Good times.

1128
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,204
Just around the bend.

1129
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:41,486
General, there was a weaponized
second payload on Brave Angel.

1130
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:45,611
Weapons? You think you saw weapons?
Let me tell you what you saw.

1131
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,646
You saw a complex, philanthropic
telecommunications satellite...

1132
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,889
co-venture between Global One
and Facebook!

1133
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:57,131
Designed to help six poverty-stricken
countries in the Pacific Rim.

1134
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:03,481
Now teenagers in Equatorial New Guinea
can't meet and date because of you.

1135
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,728
Nobody tells me anything.
I didn't know that.

1136
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,890
Shut up and keep flexing
your crazy fingers!

1137
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,805
- I told you he would be a disaster!
- Yes, sir.

1138
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,964
And one more thing,
Mr. Three-Day Beard Boy.

1139
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,730
Stay away from Allison Ng!

1140
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,840
We've got six and a half years
invested in her.

1141
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,249
She's part of Hillary Clinton's Star Guard.
Know what that is?

1142
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,726
Well, neither do I!

1143
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:28,003
When she gets off the plane in Oahu,
she likes to see Allison there.

1144
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,851
She likes her salute. And so do we.

1145
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,804
Stay away from our girl!

1146
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,484
Current lat and lon is 34, 52...

1147
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:33,765
85 east, 69, 17, 17 north.

1148
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:41,605
Poor Gilcrest.
You took the vanity road, didn't you?

1149
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,810
You ruined yourself to impress a girl.

1150
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,570
And did you get the girl?

1151
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,369
No, I didn't.

1152
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,644
Close, though.

1153
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,850
Well, that's too bad.
She was a good one.

1154
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,806
I got you a new Santa Claus.
Very strong neck.

1155
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,047
They were giving them away.
Christmas is over.

1156
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,760
It's the holiday of chill.

1157
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:13,888
Brian, that is bizarrely sweet of you
and completely unnecessary.

1158
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,166
- Guess what.
- What?

1159
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,489
- Woody wrote me a letter.
- You're kidding.

1160
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,730
Nope. Words and everything.

1161
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,610
Really?

1162
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,883
"Dear Tracy.

1163
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:33,771
You asked me to speak my mind,
so here it is. My mind.

1164
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:37,687
Do not penalize me for not being
one of those flowery people...

1165
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,601
who shoot their feelings in a spray
like a fire hydrant on a summer day."

1166
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,122
No worry about that.

1167
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,567
I've never seen him do that.

1168
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,526
"I just hated the way you changed
when Gilcrest came back to town.

1169
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:55,081
But I don't like to hate.

1170
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,606
It's bad for my brain.

1171
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,164
Every night...

1172
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,282
when I come home, I start fresh.

1173
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,882
I don't bring
what happens up there down here.

1174
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,207
I may not be the original owner
of your heart...

1175
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:24,762
but I am the better owner
and a much healthier option too!"

1176
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,122
Exclamation point there.

1177
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,681
Mom, there's a new Santa outside.

1178
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,611
- Hi.
- Hi.

1179
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,686
I liked him a little better
when he was silent.

1180
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,570
But keep going.

1181
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,163
"You have no...

1182
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,761
You have no idea
the fear you calm in me...

1183
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:57,328
every night I come back home
through that squeaky back door.

1184
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,207
Aloha, Woody."

1185
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:12,321
Well, anywhere you turn,
somebody's heart breaks.

1186
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,285
Well, come on.

1187
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,726
You gotta take a big bite out of your life.
Your husband wrote that.

1188
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,962
Are you trying to play matchmaker now?

1189
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:27,642
I was on the fence till the door part,
but that was the final blow.

1190
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,884
- Oh, really?
- I didn't even hear that squeaky door.

1191
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,650
I think I...

1192
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,247
I just completely lack
that romantic gene.

1193
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,762
Just noise to me.

1194
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,530
He's your guy.

1195
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,366
My opinion?

1196
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,167
Go be with Captain Ng.

1197
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,291
That girl lit up your sky.

1198
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,446
No, I messed that up.

1199
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:08,202
Trust a girl who's been on the other side
of your mega mess-ups in the past.

1200
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:11,769
Take those blue eyes and go to her.

1201
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,846
Yeah, you don't want it to be taut,
all right?

1202
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,804
You want it to billow.

1203
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,289
And that's how you hang a flag.

1204
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,851
I like it.

1205
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,884
Are you okay?

1206
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,730
- Is that Dad?
- Dad's home?

1207
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,809
- Yeah, Dad's home.
- Hey, Dad.

1208
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,209
- Where were you? We missed you.
- Dad.

1209
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,171
- Tell him what it is.
- Well, we decided...

1210
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,322
Well, who wants to help me clean up
the Christmas decorations?

1211
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,806
Not me.

1212
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,643
Welcome to your hearing, Gilcrest.

1213
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,369
Congratulations. You're a hero.

1214
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,167
Your buddy Carson Welch was setting
a nuclear outpost for himself...

1215
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,407
up in the sky.

1216
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,803
- Get the Great One a drink.
- He hid it from everybody.

1217
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,002
He wanted to arm America
with his own nuke.

1218
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,409
He would've owned the sky.
He would've been his own country.

1219
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,049
Everybody knew a little,
but nobody knew everything except...

1220
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:19,611
Welch.

1221
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,043
- It'll all be labeled as a malfunction.
- It was a bit messy.

1222
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,727
But you made us look good.
I'll take all the credit, of course.

1223
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:31,847
Interpol and our guys are taking over.
They're picking Carson up in Japan...

1224
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,767
in just about 30 seconds.

1225
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:16,764
This is what we get for letting civilians
into space. Drop your bat, go out on a hit.

1226
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,082
All the great ones do.

1227
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,847
Captain Ng?

1228
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,490
Let it go.

1229
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,806
She's on her way.

1230
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,487
Get lost, Gilcrest.

1231
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,490
I wanna know
what you were like growing up.

1232
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,331
What was your favorite pair of shoes?

1233
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,649
What was your favorite cereal?
What was the first car you drove?

1234
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:10,171
I mean, I'm just getting started here.
I wanna know everything about you.

1235
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,766
Why are you still here?

1236
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:19,488
Wherever you're flying, come back,
I'll be waiting for you.

1237
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,649
Ten words.

1238
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,567
That's a lot more than five, Gilcrest.

1239
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,883
I love you...

1240
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:37,886
Allison.

1241
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,289
It's four. That's not bad.

1242
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,646
I'm staying.

1243
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,090
Now we're talking.

1244
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,128
Can I give you a lift, captain?

1245
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,251
Oh, yeah.

1246
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,651
Absolutely, Brian.

1247
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,405
There's one more thing I need to do.

1248
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,250
- Yes, you do.
- Yeah.
