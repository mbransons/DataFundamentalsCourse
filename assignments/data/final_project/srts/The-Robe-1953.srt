1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:32,552
<i>Rome, master of the earth,</i>

3
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,511
<i>in the 18th year of the emperor Tiberius.</i>

4
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:39,350
<i>Our legions stand guard
on the boundaries of civilisation</i>

5
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,904
<i>from the foggy coasts of the northern seas
to the ancient rivers of Babylon,</i>

6
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:47,030
<i>the finest fighting machines in history.</i>

7
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:54,062
<i>The people of 30 lands send us tribute:
their gold and silk, ivory and frankincense,</i>

8
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:58,585
<i>and their proudest sons to be our slaves.</i>

9
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:02,825
<i>We have reached the point where there
are more slaves in Rome than citizens.</i>

10
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:06,030
<i>Some say we are only looters
of what others have created,</i>

11
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:08,263
<i>that we create nothing ourselves.</i>

12
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:12,028
<i>But we have made gods,
fine gods and goddesses,</i>

13
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:14,265
<i>who make love</i>

14
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:16,025
<i>and war.</i>

15
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:18,550
<i>Huntresses</i>

16
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,669
<i>and drunkards.</i>

17
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:25,144
<i>But the power lies not in their hands
of marble, but in ours of flesh.</i>

18
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:30,264
<i>We, the nobles of Rome, are free
to live only for our own pleasure.</i>

19
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:33,026
<i>Could any god offer us more?</i>

20
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:35,343
<i>Today we traffic in human souls.</i>

21
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:40,747
<i>The slave market is crowded because the
emperor's heir and regent, young Caligula,</i>

22
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,393
<i>is coming to buy gladiators.</i>

23
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:46,271
<i>He probably will not be pleased to see me.</i>

24
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:10,152
Look here, look here. A singer, a dancer,

25
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:14,067
a companion for a noble lady,
or a noble gentleman.

26
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,782
Stop, gentlemen.
A priceless gem for your household.

27
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:20,626
Look here, look here. A singer, a dancer,

28
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:23,511
a companion for a noble lady
or a noble gentleman.

29
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:26,426
A physician from Egypt.
Question him if you like.

30
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:30,665
Stop and look. Stop and look.
A jewel, a jewel from the East.

31
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:33,711
You've heard of the beauty
of the Circassians. Look.

32
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:36,865
A beauty from Circassia. Stop and look.

33
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:39,103
Buy young and train them yourself.

34
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:42,390
Children grow into men and women.
These Goths grow strong.

35
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:45,670
Buy young. Buy young
and train them yourself.

36
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:50,349
Too old? Why, he's still got
ten or fifteen years left in him.

37
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,901
He costs no more than an ox,
and cheaper to feed.

38
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:57,191
A pair to touch the heart of any buyer.
A mother and child from Syria.

39
00:03:57,273 --> 00:04:01,425
Buy them together. Buy them separately.
Smile. What's the matter with you?

40
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:05,470
Tribune. You came. I have them. Wait.

41
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:07,111
Girls. Girls.

42
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:09,946
Look. Two identical rubies. They're perfect.

43
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:13,708
And this one is a hairdresser.
She's an expert. Look at her hands.

44
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:17,865
- Very nice. Aren't they nice, Livia?
- Let go of me.

45
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:21,070
- I apologise for last night...
- Anything you say will be a lie.

46
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:24,031
Slave loose! Slave loose!

47
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:44,227
Thank you, Tribune.

48
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:48,226
A tribune. So today in Rome a tribune
does the vile work of a slave master.

49
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:52,147
Fool. Will you never learn? This is
Senator Gallio's son you're speaking to.

50
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:55,111
- Down on your...
- What's this? Tried it again?

51
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:59,823
Give me his slate. "Highborn, educated,
qualified for household steward. "

52
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:04,987
Sell him for lion bait. Put him up
as a gladiator. Never mind the price.

53
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:08,031
But, Cleander, Caligula's
buying gladiators today.

54
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:10,986
- What of it?
- He'll get this Greek for nothing.

55
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:14,622
- He's worth 1,000 pieces of gold.
- He's worth his weight in dog's meat.

56
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:17,022
- Please.
- A gladiator. You heard me.

57
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,267
You animal. Animal!

58
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,425
Did you hear what he said? Lion bait.

59
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,110
- I'm sorry. What were you saying?
- There's nothing more to say.

60
00:05:29,193 --> 00:05:32,310
After last night you'll never hear
another word out of me.

61
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:37,342
In front of my friends, too. I know you
were drunk as a pig, but that's no excuse.

62
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:41,312
Do you realise you've made me
the laughing stock of Rome, Marcellus?

63
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:43,588
Marcellus Gallio.

64
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:49,149
Don't think I won't talk about this.

65
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,622
- I intend to.
- Yes.

66
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:06,264
It's good to see you, Marcellus.

67
00:06:06,353 --> 00:06:09,151
It's good to see you again.

68
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:11,823
Then you do remember me.

69
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:17,230
Yes, of course. Let me see now, it was the...

70
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:20,510
And your promise.
Have you forgotten that too?

71
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:23,153
What promise?

72
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,428
To marry me.

73
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,628
Was I drunk?

74
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:32,151
That's not very flattering, Marcellus.

75
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:37,150
If you'd tell me when I was supposed
to have said this - the circumstances.

76
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:42,424
I remember them perfectly.
I'd cut my finger, and I cried.

77
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:47,143
You took a dagger and cut your own finger
to show me that it didn't really hurt.

78
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:50,111
Then you kissed me and I stopped crying,

79
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,708
and then you promised
to marry me when we grew up.

80
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,586
Diana.

81
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:01,791
- Where have your freckles gone?
- I lost them.

82
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:05,183
- I loved every one of them.
- Then I'm sorry I lost them.

83
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:07,662
Let me look at you.

84
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:14,589
12 years... The gods must love Capri
to make you blossom so.

85
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:17,233
- What are you doing in Rome?
- Tiberius sent me.

86
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:20,032
Since my father died
I've been the ward of the emperor.

87
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:24,948
- Yes, this is Caligula's pavilion.
- Empress Julia thinks I'd be good for him.

88
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,069
Caligula? You can't.

89
00:07:27,153 --> 00:07:31,032
He'll be emperor someday, and...
Would that matter, Marcellus, to you?

90
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:33,343
More than my life. After all, I promised you.

91
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,869
And you'll never know
how seriously I took your promise.

92
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:39,706
Do you intend to hold me to it, Diana?

93
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,911
I might. But I've heard
that you've made other promises since.

94
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:45,984
But only one vow to Diana.

95
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:56,028
He's coming, Marcellus. You'd better go.

96
00:07:56,113 --> 00:08:00,743
Caligula and I have been in competition
before, and I've never lost to him.

97
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,712
- At least you're frank, Marcellus.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

98
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:07,227
Then all the tales I've heard of you are true.

99
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:11,704
- Every man makes enemies.
- All your enemies seem to be women.

100
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:14,509
Yes.

101
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,702
Begin the sale.

102
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:49,428
And why is Tribune Gallio in my pavilion?
Does he seek a favour?

103
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:54,143
I invited him, sire. We were friends
many years ago when we were children.

104
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,463
Buying today, or looking for amusement?

105
00:08:56,553 --> 00:08:59,351
Buying, I hope, sire. A pair of twins.

106
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:02,072
- Male or female?
- Female.

107
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:05,782
- Have them put up first.
- Sire.

108
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:11,550
No. Sit down, here with me.

109
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:15,188
You're very kind, sire.

110
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:18,505
The pleasure of our loyal tribune
is important to us.

111
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:22,586
You have such excellent taste.
These twins must be charming.

112
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:29,263
We have here two Macedonian twins,

113
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:33,824
trained as companions, entertainers,
servant for a highborn lady.

114
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:37,667
Only once a year can their like
be found on the auction blocks of Rome.

115
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:40,028
They won't be sold separately.
What am I bid?

116
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,024
500 gold pieces.

117
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,705
1,000.

118
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:45,943
1200.

119
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,864
1300.

120
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:50,503
- Don't lose them, Gallio.
- 1500.

121
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:54,548
1600.

122
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:58,468
- Marcellus, are you my friend or aren't you?
- Not to this extent.

123
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:02,262
- 2,000.
- The bid stands at 2,000 pieces of gold.

124
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:04,784
2500.

125
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,301
- You bid for yourself?
- No.

126
00:10:10,113 --> 00:10:12,581
Sold for 2500.

127
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:17,272
Forgive me, Gallio, but I have
decided to give them to the lady Diana.

128
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:20,151
- But, sire...
- You wouldn't refuse me?

129
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:22,426
No, sire.

130
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:29,427
Offered as a gladiator, a Greek.
I guarantee his strength and fighting spirit.

131
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:32,027
- Buy him.
- 50 gold pieces.

132
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:34,912
- 50.
- Dog's meat!

133
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:38,182
There are no more bids. Get on with the sale.

134
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:40,150
100.

135
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:43,111
- You bid against me?
- Against Tribune Quintus.

136
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:46,549
- Be careful, Tribune.
- The Greek is well-qualified, sire.

137
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:49,466
- He's worth a better price.
- 200 gold pieces.

138
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:52,943
- 300.
- You want to make a gift of him to me?

139
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,103
No, sire. I want him.

140
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:57,502
And I bid against Quintus.

141
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:00,822
- 500.
- 700.

142
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:02,904
- 800.
- 900.

143
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,508
1,000.

144
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,983
3,000.

145
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:13,351
The bid is 3,000 pieces of gold.

146
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:19,624
A little high, but I expected
to spend more on the twins.

147
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,463
You offend me, Tribune.

148
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:26,351
I think it's time you offend me no more.

149
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:29,302
Detail! March!

150
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,431
Sold to Tribune Gallio.

151
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:51,943
A wonderful purchase, sir,
even though you may have to beat him.

152
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:54,467
- Yes. Unchain him.
- Sir?

153
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:57,021
- Unchain him.
- But he's a dangerous man.

154
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:59,502
- Unchain him.
- Yes, sir.

155
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:08,748
What's your name?

156
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,028
Demetrius, from Corinth.

157
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:16,942
At the end of the street you'll find
the house of my father, Senator Gallio.

158
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:20,230
It has a scarlet door.
Report to the steward there.

159
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:42,184
There are times
when I'm away with Senator Gallio.

160
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:47,267
In that case, the slave attending
the front door is required to light the lamps.

161
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:52,711
To be a slave in this household
is an honour.

162
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:55,182
To be a slave anywhere is to be a dog.

163
00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:59,751
The door. Open it. Remember to bow.

164
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,982
The door. Run, you fool.

165
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:07,111
- Good evening, Marcipor.
- Good evening, sir.

166
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,546
It's you.

167
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:12,228
No household duties.
He'll be my personal attendant.

168
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:19,186
You could have run away. Why didn't you?

169
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:22,107
I owe you a debt, sir. I pay my debts.

170
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:25,786
- Not a slave's reason. More like a Roman's.
- A Greek's.

171
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:31,391
Yes, I know. In the great days of Greece,
we Romans were no more than barbarians.

172
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:36,422
Have Marcipor show you where I keep
my clothes. I'll change before dinner.

173
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,991
Good evening, Mother. Lucia.

174
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:43,428
Sorry, Mother, I was outbid for those twins.

175
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:45,822
- We know, Marcellus.
- Diana was here.

176
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:48,746
Diana? You should have
kept her till I got home.

177
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,382
Marcellus. She told us that
you and Caligula had a quarrel...

178
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:56,307
- Don't worry about that.
- Caligula's very angry.

179
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:58,748
- She takes him too seriously.
- She has to.

180
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,393
- She's going to marry him.
- Did she tell you that?

181
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,829
Mother, look. I think
he's in love with her himself.

182
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:10,146
Love's like wine. A sip hurts nobody, but
to empty the bottle is to invite a headache.

183
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:13,589
Well, you won't even get a taste.
She thinks you're very funny.

184
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:16,983
- She does?
- She thought you wanted the twins.

185
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,507
- Lucia.
- That's what she said, Mother.

186
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:26,101
Marcellus. Are you deliberately trying
to cut the ground from under my feet,

187
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:29,105
orjust too much of a fool
to understand what you've done?

188
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:31,661
You mean my difference
of opinion with Caligula?

189
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:35,905
I lead the senators who oppose him, and my
son makes fun of him at private banquets,

190
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:38,302
and now humiliates him in public.

191
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:41,783
I'm fighting for the republic
against the tyranny of the emperors.

192
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,989
- I know that.
- You know nothing.

193
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:46,143
Nothing but dice and women.

194
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:49,589
And now, by your behaviour
to Caligula, by these petty slights,

195
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:53,951
you cripple me, make my fight
look like a personal quarrel.

196
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:57,351
- Yes?
- Sir, Tribune Quintus is at the door.

197
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,912
- For me?
- For your son.

198
00:14:58,993 --> 00:15:01,382
- I'm not at home.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:09,946
Your leave. Give this to Tribune Gallio
when he does come home.

200
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:13,628
Well, aren't you going to read it?

201
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,704
After dinner.

202
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:17,988
Good eating to you.

203
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:21,948
Ladies. Senator Gallio.

204
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,503
Quintus is a very important man.

205
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:31,504
He was already my enemy.

206
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:42,593
- May we know?
- It's from Caligula.

207
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:48,384
"The courage of a military tribune must not
be squandered in baths and banquet halls. "

208
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,862
"You are ordered
to the garrison at Jerusalem. "

209
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:54,946
- Jerusalem.
- "You sail tonight on the Palestine galley. "

210
00:15:56,953 --> 00:16:00,741
That's all. Not even
an expression of his tender regard.

211
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:06,551
Cornelia, he will need his things.

212
00:16:08,913 --> 00:16:11,222
Help your mother, Lucia.

213
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:22,183
Where's Jerusalem?

214
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,468
Palestine.

215
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:27,462
The worst pest-hole in the empire.

216
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:33,471
A stiff-necked, riotous people
always on the verge of rebellion.

217
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:38,024
Our legions there are the scum of the army,
the officers little better than the men.

218
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:40,502
Disease takes them off like flies.

219
00:16:41,513 --> 00:16:44,710
Some have been assassinated,
sometimes by their own men.

220
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:47,785
Others have spared the assassins the trouble.

221
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:52,182
What Caligula hopes he has given you
is your death sentence.

222
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:56,751
- "We who are about to die"?
- Marcellus.

223
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:00,985
Marcellus, you are
the only son I'll ever have.

224
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,906
You know what my ambitions
have been for you.

225
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:07,504
I know how I've disappointed you.

226
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,061
Try to endure it, Marcellus.

227
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:12,223
Grow hard.

228
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:15,305
Watch the hand of the man
who walks behind you.

229
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:19,701
Drink in private and sleep
with your sword at your side.

230
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:22,102
Take nothing on faith.

231
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:24,822
Bind yourself to no man.

232
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:28,387
Above all, be a Roman, my son,

233
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:31,188
and be a man of honour.

234
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:39,141
Perhaps there'll be amusement
in being a man of honour.

235
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,986
- Ready, sir?
- Yes, that's the last of my gear.

236
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,631
Ready at the oars.

237
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:06,622
Man the lines.

238
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:12,902
Careful with that, it's the wine.

239
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:15,503
Yes, sir.

240
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:18,551
There's no need to be so formal, Demetrius.

241
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,067
We'll both need friends where we're going.

242
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:26,146
Friends can't be bought, sir,
even for 3,000 pieces of gold.

243
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,949
Is there anything else you want, sir?

244
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,024
No.

245
00:18:33,873 --> 00:18:37,661
The lady Diana begs a word with you, sir,
before you leave.

246
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,302
We don't want to lose this tide, sir.

247
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:55,304
Diana.

248
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:57,987
I came to tell you that I'm going back to Capri

249
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:00,667
to ask the emperor to intercede for you.

250
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,309
Why?

251
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,022
I think Caligula treated you unjustly.

252
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:08,263
Why, Diana?

253
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:10,787
It was partly my fault what happened.

254
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,068
The real reason.

255
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,708
Because I've found you again,
and I don't want to lose you.

256
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:23,631
Perhaps you don't believe that
a girl of 11 could fall in love

257
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:26,102
and stay in love all these years.

258
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:33,424
Tribune.

259
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:38,348
Don't cry, my love.

260
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:42,062
Lucia thought I was in love.

261
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:45,941
I laughed at her,
but women are wise in these matters.

262
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,222
Tribune. We'll miss the tide.

263
00:19:56,313 --> 00:20:00,101
Make Tiberius promise
not to give you to Caligula

264
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:03,548
until I come back.

265
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,388
Cast off.

266
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:22,505
- Pull up.
- Lines are up.

267
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:25,068
Start the oars.

268
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:42,586
Jerusalem's no pleasure resort at its best.

269
00:21:42,673 --> 00:21:46,143
This is the worst,
the feast they call the Passover.

270
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:49,464
This is when their soothsayers
tell them the Messiah will come.

271
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:53,512
- Messiah? What's that?
- King. Saviour. Redeemer.

272
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,946
Son of their god - and general troublemaker.

273
00:21:57,473 --> 00:21:59,862
- He's coming here?
- No one knows.

274
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:02,069
No one knows if he even exists.

275
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:05,987
He is, but he isn't.
He hasn't come yet, but he's coming.

276
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,984
Every year the same.

277
00:22:09,513 --> 00:22:12,664
You'll find out, Tribune,
if you live long enough.

278
00:22:12,753 --> 00:22:15,187
Thanks for the kind wish, Centurion.

279
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:19,948
The Messiah.

280
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,548
There he is.

281
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,868
What stirred them up?
Perhaps he's coming after all, the Messiah.

282
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:43,228
Something's happening, that's certain.

283
00:22:43,313 --> 00:22:46,703
Look. There. Those people carrying palms.

284
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:49,668
The man riding a white donkey. See him?

285
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:58,310
Flavius, clear us a path through these cattle.

286
00:23:33,993 --> 00:23:37,349
Demetrius, come along.
Your master will have you flogged.

287
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,310
- Did you see him?
- Who?

288
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:42,146
- The man who just rode past.
- I was over there.

289
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:45,111
He stopped here and looked at me.
He looked into my eyes.

290
00:23:45,193 --> 00:23:47,423
- What did he want?
- I don't know.

291
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:51,191
I thought he was going to speak
but he didn't.

292
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:53,868
Only his eyes spoke.

293
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:56,668
Come on, Demetrius.

294
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:58,948
I think he wants me to follow him.

295
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:01,308
- Who is he? A general?
- No.

296
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:05,105
- A king?
- No, he's not a king.

297
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:08,304
He's...

298
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:10,988
I don't know.

299
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:28,466
This is for the tribune. It's very important.

300
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:34,588
Excuse me. Let me pass, please.

301
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:45,182
Here you are, Tribune, just as I promised you.

302
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:48,310
The finest Syrian wine
from the vintage you like the best.

303
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:51,146
And now, Tribune, there's
a little matter of payment.

304
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:54,270
One, two, three, four
skins of wine you owe me for.

305
00:24:54,353 --> 00:24:56,867
Four skins of wine for four days, remember?

306
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,944
Who are you?

307
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:02,070
Who am I?
The tribune has a sense of humour.

308
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:04,621
- He asks me who I am.
- Ever seen this man before?

309
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,066
- No, never.
- Never, sire.

310
00:25:06,153 --> 00:25:10,783
Gentlemen, please. Please. I am Caleb,
Caleb the wine merchant. Remember?

311
00:25:10,873 --> 00:25:14,104
I'm an honest man.
The tribune and I have an agreement.

312
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:16,787
A skin of wine every day.
Don't you remember?

313
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:19,467
Please, gentlemen.
I want my money. I'm a poor man.

314
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,783
You're not poor. You're as rich as Midas.

315
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:24,626
And you're not honest. You're a thief.

316
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:27,830
- Then you do recognise me.
- As for being a wine merchant...

317
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,985
The stuff you sell isn't fit for a jackass.

318
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:32,791
Thank you.

319
00:25:32,873 --> 00:25:34,511
Oh, dear.

320
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:36,788
Tribune, what have you done?

321
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,232
Enjoying yourself?

322
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:53,146
Whoever conquered this land
should have been strung up.

323
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:57,067
- Demetrius, pour us some of this poison.
- The curse of empire.

324
00:25:57,153 --> 00:26:00,702
But think how we make it possible
for those in Rome to enjoy themselves.

325
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,784
I am thinking about it.

326
00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:05,512
Pilate's given orders to arrest that fanatic.

327
00:26:05,593 --> 00:26:07,709
Remember? The day you arrived?

328
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:10,068
Yes, the Messiah. What did he do?

329
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,667
He's been preaching,
stirring up a commotion.

330
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:15,062
- Why don't you arrest him?
- It's not easy.

331
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:18,941
Pilate wants it done quietly.
The man's got half the people on his side.

332
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:21,069
We've got to find out where he is at night.

333
00:26:21,153 --> 00:26:25,146
And that is like finding
one particular ant in an ant hill.

334
00:26:28,193 --> 00:26:31,185
Vinegar, like the rest of it. I hope you drown.

335
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:34,592
I don't care how you handle it, Centurion.

336
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:37,028
Just do your duty.

337
00:26:37,113 --> 00:26:41,265
There's one way that never fails.
But it'll cost you some money.

338
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:44,151
Demetrius, how much is left in the purse?

339
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:49,108
- Eight gold pieces and some silver, sir.
- That should be enough.

340
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:51,582
Give him the purse.

341
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:55,190
Give him the purse.
What's the matter with you?

342
00:27:00,713 --> 00:27:02,943
I'll report later. Tribune.

343
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:06,748
Pour me some of that wine.

344
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:11,384
Demetrius?

345
00:27:13,713 --> 00:27:15,351
Demetrius.

346
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:51,303
Friend. Friend, could you help me?

347
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:54,908
I'm looking for the carpenter
from Galilee, the one called Jesus.

348
00:27:54,993 --> 00:27:58,781
- What do you want with him?
- I must warn him. I'm a slave like you are.

349
00:27:58,873 --> 00:28:01,467
You're not even clever, you Roman spy.

350
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:11,671
Wait.

351
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:13,948
You. Stop.

352
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:52,823
- I'm looking for the man called Jesus.
- Who?

353
00:28:52,913 --> 00:28:56,508
- The one they say is the Messiah.
- I never heard of him.

354
00:29:26,993 --> 00:29:29,143
Can you help me? I'm looking for a man.

355
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:33,346
- A man? What's his name?
- Jesus. I must warn him.

356
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:36,425
You're too late.
Even now he is before Pilate.

357
00:29:37,353 --> 00:29:40,186
- They found him?
- He was betrayed to them,

358
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:42,582
and by one he loved and trusted.

359
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:45,267
By his disciple, who sat at his left hand.

360
00:29:47,313 --> 00:29:49,508
Why?

361
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,267
Because men are weak.

362
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:55,823
Because they are cursed
with envy and cowardice.

363
00:29:55,913 --> 00:30:00,941
Because they can dream of truth,
but cannot live with it, they doubt.

364
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:04,312
They doubt, the fools.

365
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:07,385
Why must men betray
themselves with doubts?

366
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:12,107
Tell them, the others. Find them
and tell them not to doubt.

367
00:30:12,713 --> 00:30:15,102
Even now, not to doubt.

368
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:18,108
Tell them to keep their faith.

369
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:21,548
They must keep faith.

370
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:23,828
Wait. Tell who?

371
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:28,305
- Who are you?
- My name is Judas.

372
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,508
Tribune, wake up.

373
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,629
Come on. Do I have to drag you?

374
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:01,352
Duty calls, if the word
means anything to you.

375
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:03,788
- What is it?
- The governor wants you.

376
00:31:03,873 --> 00:31:07,661
- At this hour?
- Come. Pilate doesn't like to be kept waiting.

377
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,067
Sir, I need your help.

378
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:27,984
Where's my helmet?

379
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:32,826
- I spoke to you of the man Jesus.
- Yes, the fanatic.

380
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:36,667
- He's been arrested, sir.
- What do you expect me to do about it?

381
00:31:36,753 --> 00:31:39,950
Intercede for him.
Make them see that he's innocent.

382
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:43,503
No. When his trial comes up, I'll look into it.

383
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,582
What's he supposed to have done?

384
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:50,862
He's already been tried.
He's been condemned by Pilate himself.

385
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,909
- Pilate?
- You're going there, sir.

386
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:55,951
If he stains his hands with this blood,
he's a murderer.

387
00:31:56,033 --> 00:32:00,185
That's enough. Pilate's the governor,
the Roman governor.

388
00:32:00,273 --> 00:32:02,662
As far as I'm concerned,
that ends the matter.

389
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:05,313
- As far as you're concerned, too.
- Ready?

390
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:07,384
Yes.

391
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:14,306
For your own good,
you'd better forget you ever saw this man.

392
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:40,907
- I don't like to be kept waiting, Tribune.
- I'm sorry, sir. I came as soon as I could.

393
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,188
I have special orders for you.

394
00:32:43,273 --> 00:32:45,787
You're to report to the emperor at Capri.

395
00:32:46,513 --> 00:32:49,107
You must have powerful friends at court.

396
00:32:49,713 --> 00:32:53,831
- I suppose I have, sir.
- There'll be a galley at the end of the week.

397
00:32:53,913 --> 00:32:56,791
I have one task before you leave. It's routine.

398
00:32:56,873 --> 00:32:59,262
An execution. Today.

399
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,344
- Three criminals.
- Yes, sir.

400
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:06,261
One of them's a fanatic. He has a following.
There may be some trouble,

401
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,662
some attempt to interfere.

402
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:12,033
- Take enough men.
- I understand, sir.

403
00:33:12,553 --> 00:33:17,229
I've had a miserable night. Factions,
no one agreeing with anyone else.

404
00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:19,702
Even my wife had an opinion.

405
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,422
Good luck. I'm sorry to lose you.

406
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:29,345
- Thank you, sir.
- Give me water to wash my hands.

407
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,231
- But you just washed them, my lord.
- Did I?

408
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:36,228
So I did.

409
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:42,346
Some wine before you go, gentlemen?

410
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:44,663
- No.
- You'd better.

411
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,071
- Your first crucifixion, isn't it?
- Yes.

412
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,785
What? Never driven nails into a man's flesh?

413
00:34:24,593 --> 00:34:26,982
Hail our king. Our king.

414
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:40,108
Make way.

415
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,224
- Is it night?
- No.

416
00:36:12,313 --> 00:36:14,304
It's the middle of the day.

417
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:16,668
This isn't like other days.

418
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,904
17.

419
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:15,548
Your go, Paulus.

420
00:38:19,873 --> 00:38:21,989
Four.

421
00:38:22,993 --> 00:38:25,791
You're lucky today, Tribune. I'm finished.

422
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:29,468
- I'm always lucky.
- You. Bring me that robe.

423
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:33,666
- I have a proposition for you, Tribune.
- What?

424
00:38:33,753 --> 00:38:35,948
You'll see.

425
00:38:56,153 --> 00:39:00,351
- Hurry up.
- What's the matter with that slave?

426
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:04,631
- Where did you find him, Tribune?
- Throw the dice again, Paulus.

427
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,429
Mine by right of possession.

428
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:12,065
First-class homespun,
previously owned by a carpenter of Galilee.

429
00:39:12,793 --> 00:39:15,182
How much will you risk against it?

430
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:23,348
- 11.
- Tribune?

431
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,984
17.

432
00:39:29,073 --> 00:39:31,064
Lucky again.

433
00:39:33,193 --> 00:39:36,026
Tribune Gallio's first battle trophy,

434
00:39:36,113 --> 00:39:38,627
for victory over the king of the Jews.

435
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:41,671
We've done our duty, Centurion.
No need to joke about it.

436
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:46,065
You can say that. You're going back
to Capri to kiss the emperor's hand.

437
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:49,111
I have to stay here in this sinkhole.

438
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,551
- Get back to your post.
- Let me go.

439
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:33,545
- They say the storm's a judgment.
- Superstitious idiot.

440
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:37,069
- They say he's the Son of God.
- Maybe he is. I don't know.

441
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:05,946
Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

442
00:42:06,913 --> 00:42:08,949
Throw that cloth over me.

443
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:12,025
Didn't you hear me?
Throw that cloth over me.

444
00:42:18,313 --> 00:42:20,269
Take it off.

445
00:42:20,473 --> 00:42:22,429
Take it off.

446
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:24,624
Take it off.

447
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:29,703
You crucified him.

448
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:32,102
You, my master.

449
00:42:32,193 --> 00:42:34,627
But you've freed me.

450
00:42:34,713 --> 00:42:37,944
I'll never serve you again, you Roman pig.

451
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:41,751
Masters of the world, you call yourselves.

452
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:44,748
Thieves. Murderers.

453
00:42:45,553 --> 00:42:47,748
Jungle animals.

454
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:50,108
A curse on you.

455
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,101
A curse on your empire.

456
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:41,148
There it is again, sir.

457
00:44:10,793 --> 00:44:12,784
No.

458
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:26,944
No. No.

459
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:29,422
Stop it. Stop it.

460
00:44:32,633 --> 00:44:34,988
Stop it. Why don't you stop it?

461
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:37,462
- Stop what, sir?
- Were you out there?

462
00:44:38,753 --> 00:44:40,948
Out where, sir?

463
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:46,463
I'm sorry.

464
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:48,908
A nightmare.

465
00:44:48,993 --> 00:44:52,622
It must have been a nightmare.

466
00:44:58,873 --> 00:45:01,512
- We should put him in irons, sir.
- He's a tribune.

467
00:45:01,593 --> 00:45:03,106
I don't care. He's dangerous.

468
00:45:03,193 --> 00:45:07,505
If he asks me once more "Were you
out there?" in that tone of voice...

469
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:11,302
I haven't slept since we left Joppa.

470
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,824
My lady.

471
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:28,108
My lady, he is here.

472
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:52,787
What's wrong, Marcellus? You're ill.

473
00:45:54,873 --> 00:45:58,070
- What is it? Let me help you.
- No one can help me.

474
00:46:00,113 --> 00:46:02,343
It's enough that I'm with you again.

475
00:46:04,393 --> 00:46:06,384
Let's sit here.

476
00:46:13,673 --> 00:46:17,461
You can have no trouble so great
that I'd be afraid to share it.

477
00:46:17,553 --> 00:46:20,386
Ever since I went away
you've been in my heart.

478
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:23,146
Your voice in my ears,
your image in my eyes.

479
00:46:23,713 --> 00:46:26,227
Waking and sleeping, you were with me.

480
00:46:26,313 --> 00:46:29,544
And even more, since it happened.

481
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:33,151
- Since what happened?
- Every evening of the voyage,

482
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:37,146
a star appeared above the bow,
standing bright and steady in the sky,

483
00:46:37,233 --> 00:46:39,747
as if sent to guide the ship home.

484
00:46:40,753 --> 00:46:42,744
In my illness,

485
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,222
I thought you had sent it as a sign.

486
00:46:46,233 --> 00:46:50,351
It became my one link with sanity.

487
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:55,342
Sanity? What do you mean?

488
00:47:08,673 --> 00:47:10,948
What is it, Marcellus? Tell me.

489
00:47:21,513 --> 00:47:23,583
- Marcellus?
- Don't come near me.

490
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:25,868
Keep away.

491
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:28,909
No, Marcellus. Don't.

492
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,063
My love, my poor love.

493
00:47:34,473 --> 00:47:36,464
Tell me.

494
00:47:37,073 --> 00:47:39,462
Soon enough you'll learn the truth.

495
00:47:40,313 --> 00:47:42,543
I am ill, as you guessed.

496
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:46,183
But in my mind.

497
00:47:46,873 --> 00:47:49,341
The truth is, I'm mad.

498
00:47:57,473 --> 00:47:59,623
My lady?

499
00:48:01,193 --> 00:48:03,229
- What is it?
- A message from the emperor.

500
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:05,702
He'll see Tribune Gallio at once.

501
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,744
Yes.

502
00:48:15,473 --> 00:48:20,308
- You can't go now, not till you've rested.
- It's no use. He already knows.

503
00:48:20,393 --> 00:48:24,147
The captain of the galley ran to
report to him as soon as we docked.

504
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,224
I'll go with you.

505
00:48:26,313 --> 00:48:28,508
I can't ask you to.

506
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,268
But I want you to know

507
00:48:31,913 --> 00:48:34,302
you're free from your promise.

508
00:48:57,233 --> 00:49:00,191
Sire, Tribune Gallio is here
as you commanded.

509
00:49:00,273 --> 00:49:02,264
But he was made ill by the voyage.

510
00:49:02,353 --> 00:49:05,504
I beg you to postpone the audience
until he is rested.

511
00:49:06,393 --> 00:49:10,625
- Does he ask for a postponement?
- No, sire, but I do. I implore you.

512
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:13,705
It would serve no purpose.
I will see him now.

513
00:49:14,273 --> 00:49:16,548
Bring him in.

514
00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:19,784
The lovely lady Diana married to an idiot.

515
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:23,305
But she's too good for Caligula, isn't she?

516
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:29,423
After 40 years with Julia,

517
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:32,471
my approaching death
holds few terrors for me.

518
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:36,831
Death, sire? But my last examination
proves you'll live for 20 years at least.

519
00:49:36,913 --> 00:49:40,349
- My physician is very loyal.
- Not 20, sire.

520
00:49:40,433 --> 00:49:43,664
30. I read it only last night
in the entrails of an owl.

521
00:49:43,753 --> 00:49:46,267
And my soothsayer even more loyal.

522
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:48,628
The entrails of an owl.

523
00:49:48,713 --> 00:49:51,705
No, stay. We may have need
of you men of science.

524
00:49:52,313 --> 00:49:54,622
The entrails of an owl.

525
00:50:02,353 --> 00:50:05,425
- You are welcome, Tribune.
- Thank you, sire.

526
00:50:05,913 --> 00:50:08,711
I bring you dispatches from Pontius Pilate.

527
00:50:08,793 --> 00:50:12,706
By your leave, sire, he asked me
to put them into your hands and no others.

528
00:50:12,793 --> 00:50:14,943
Then they must hold bad news.

529
00:50:15,033 --> 00:50:17,627
- Sit down, Tribune.
- Thank you, sire.

530
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:22,025
Tell me, what was your impression of Pilate?

531
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:26,147
- It's not my place to...
- I'm asking you.

532
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:29,103
Did you find him capable?

533
00:50:29,313 --> 00:50:32,703
Yes, sire. He is considered
a good administrator.

534
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:36,502
- Stern, as befits a Roman governor?
- I'm sure of that, sire.

535
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:39,428
Just?

536
00:50:40,273 --> 00:50:42,867
I can't say.

537
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:46,548
Why not? Surely you can give me
some sort of an answer.

538
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:52,149
Tell me, Tribune, what happened out there?

539
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:57,912
- What happened?
- Were you out there?

540
00:50:58,233 --> 00:51:00,428
Marcellus.

541
00:51:01,753 --> 00:51:04,551
I told you, sire, he's ill. Let me take...

542
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:09,982
Leave him alone. Stand back.

543
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:18,270
Tribune Gallio, you are a Roman officer.

544
00:51:18,473 --> 00:51:21,465
I command you to get control over yourself.

545
00:51:29,473 --> 00:51:31,668
Yes, sire.

546
00:51:32,993 --> 00:51:36,065
This report of Pilate's,
and your own condition,

547
00:51:36,153 --> 00:51:38,542
hint alike at a serious situation.

548
00:51:39,073 --> 00:51:42,668
- Now speak.
- Please, Marcellus. He wants to help you.

549
00:51:46,673 --> 00:51:48,664
I'm not your enemy, boy.

550
00:51:48,753 --> 00:51:53,304
I fought in Iberia with your grandfather.
Your father was like a son to me.

551
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:55,908
Now tell me. Everything.

552
00:52:15,993 --> 00:52:18,666
Is Tribune Gallio still there?

553
00:52:18,753 --> 00:52:20,869
He's been talking for two hours, my lady.

554
00:52:20,953 --> 00:52:24,343
- And?
- Hopeless, my lady. Completely hopeless.

555
00:52:31,033 --> 00:52:33,024
The Son of God?

556
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:37,062
What god?

557
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,542
I don't know, sire.

558
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:40,952
I don't know.

559
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:43,263
And you lost your wits
when he looked at you?

560
00:52:43,353 --> 00:52:44,502
No.

561
00:52:44,593 --> 00:52:47,346
It was later, when I put on the robe.

562
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:55,464
Miracles, disciples, slaves running away...

563
00:52:56,313 --> 00:53:00,352
Roman legionaries
fraternising with the natives...

564
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:03,630
Well, none of this
concerns us for the moment.

565
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:07,991
We must make you well.
What have you learned gentlemen to say?

566
00:53:08,073 --> 00:53:10,507
A difficult matter, sire. Under my care...

567
00:53:10,593 --> 00:53:13,426
- He'd never improve.
- Who gave you permission to speak?

568
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:16,550
The clue to this man's sanity
is not in a vial of medicine.

569
00:53:16,633 --> 00:53:20,228
- Well, where then?
- In the robe that bewitched him.

570
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,025
- Go on.
- Plainly, there was a curse on the robe.

571
00:53:26,113 --> 00:53:29,025
His only chance is to find it and destroy it.

572
00:53:30,033 --> 00:53:32,024
An interesting notion.

573
00:53:33,033 --> 00:53:36,582
He's right, sire. He must be right.
The robe was bewitched.

574
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:40,461
- Let me find it, sire, destroy it.
- If you do, your mind will be restored.

575
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:43,670
A lost robe in the hands of a runaway slave?

576
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:46,347
- What chance would you have?
- He couldn't get away.

577
00:53:46,433 --> 00:53:50,870
He must be still in Palestine, with
the other followers of the dead man.

578
00:53:50,953 --> 00:53:53,592
He had disciples.
It's there in Pilate's message.

579
00:53:53,673 --> 00:53:56,506
Who knows what powers
he left to these disciples?

580
00:53:56,593 --> 00:53:58,982
Magic formulas, potions...

581
00:53:59,073 --> 00:54:01,792
- Beware.
- He is dead, Dodinius.

582
00:54:01,873 --> 00:54:06,867
Evil never dies. It lives -
in the air, in the robe, everywhere.

583
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:11,868
Tribune Gallio, I give you
an imperial commission.

584
00:54:12,473 --> 00:54:15,624
For yourself, find this robe and destroy it.

585
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:20,272
For Rome, seek out
the followers of this dead magician.

586
00:54:20,353 --> 00:54:22,150
I want names, Tribune.

587
00:54:22,233 --> 00:54:26,784
Names of all the disciples, of every man
and woman who subscribe to this treason.

588
00:54:26,873 --> 00:54:28,989
Names, Tribune. All of them.

589
00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:32,270
No matter how much it costs
or how long it takes.

590
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,503
You will report directly to me.

591
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:37,629
I understand, sire.

592
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,952
- I am grateful.
- A galley will be put at your disposal.

593
00:54:41,033 --> 00:54:43,547
You will leave at once, on the first tide.

594
00:54:44,153 --> 00:54:46,348
That is all.

595
00:54:47,153 --> 00:54:49,462
Thank you, sire.

596
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:54,624
Wait.

597
00:55:00,713 --> 00:55:05,150
For your sake, I interfered when
my wife wanted to give you to Caligula.

598
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:09,341
For your sake, I brought your tribune
back from Palestine.

599
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:12,592
For your sake, I now free you from him.

600
00:55:14,433 --> 00:55:17,948
But, sire, I have no wish to be free.

601
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:19,944
Have you gone mad too?

602
00:55:21,513 --> 00:55:23,788
He had everything then.

603
00:55:23,873 --> 00:55:26,148
He could have had me too.

604
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:28,952
I wanted him,
but I wasn't sure that I loved him.

605
00:55:29,353 --> 00:55:31,548
Now I am sure.

606
00:55:33,273 --> 00:55:36,265
I think it my duty
to forbid you to see him again.

607
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:38,503
As a child, you were wise.

608
00:55:38,593 --> 00:55:41,266
Now you reason like a woman, foolishly.

609
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:47,951
I can't help being a woman, sire,
but I try to reason as you taught me.

610
00:55:48,353 --> 00:55:50,264
You were a soldier, sire.

611
00:55:50,353 --> 00:55:53,345
When you won, you could expect
your legions to cheer you.

612
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,993
But when you lost,
what would you have given

613
00:55:56,073 --> 00:56:01,227
to see the eagles raised in your honour,
to hear your name on every man's lips?

614
00:56:01,313 --> 00:56:04,271
I like Caligula no better than you do,

615
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:07,504
but what a wife
you would make for an emperor.

616
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:12,501
Very well, my dear.
Your tribune shall have another chance.

617
00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:15,428
Thank you, sire.

618
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:31,349
When it comes,

619
00:56:31,753 --> 00:56:34,028
this is how it will start.

620
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:37,943
Some obscure martyr
in some forgotten province.

621
00:56:38,753 --> 00:56:42,348
Then madness, infecting the legions,

622
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:45,269
rotting the empire,

623
00:56:45,353 --> 00:56:47,548
then the finish of Rome.

624
00:56:47,633 --> 00:56:49,863
But if the tribune breaks the spell...

625
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:52,103
Spell, you fool? What spell?

626
00:56:52,193 --> 00:56:56,709
This is more dangerous than any spell
your superstitious mind could dream of.

627
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:59,182
It is man's desire to be free.

628
00:56:59,993 --> 00:57:02,461
It is the greatest madness of them all.

629
00:57:03,273 --> 00:57:07,744
And I have sent the most effective
physician I could find to cure it.

630
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:10,222
I have sent a madman.

631
00:57:26,636 --> 00:57:28,786
Tribune. Tribune.

632
00:57:29,636 --> 00:57:33,993
- I warned you not to call me Tribune.
- Worthy merchant, then. I have news for you.

633
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:37,068
When Abidor says
he'll find someone, he finds him.

634
00:57:37,156 --> 00:57:39,511
You found the Greek slave. Where is he?

635
00:57:39,596 --> 00:57:43,066
I haven't seen him, not myself.
But he is known, in this village.

636
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:47,547
- Cana, it's called. You'll find him soon.
- "Soon. " With you it's always "soon".

637
00:57:47,636 --> 00:57:50,787
We've been to three provinces and
a hundred villages. Has he been seen?

638
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:52,912
These villagers are suspicious.

639
00:57:52,996 --> 00:57:56,750
In this land of Galilee, the crucified one
has many friends, very many.

640
00:57:56,836 --> 00:57:59,350
Names for your list, Tribune -
merchant, I mean.

641
00:57:59,436 --> 00:58:01,904
And coins for me too, no?
A coin for every name.

642
00:58:01,996 --> 00:58:04,669
- The Greek. What about the Greek?
- He has been here.

643
00:58:04,756 --> 00:58:09,386
He is somewhere in Galilee now,
with one they call the big fisherman.

644
00:58:09,476 --> 00:58:12,354
- Fisherman?
- That's all I know. You'll find out the rest.

645
00:58:12,436 --> 00:58:15,394
The emperor's spy is cleverer
than a poor Syrian guide.

646
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:19,549
I'll prepare the way for you. A Roman
merchant comes to trade for their homespun.

647
00:58:19,636 --> 00:58:21,627
Your gold will buy their answers.

648
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:23,911
And their lives.

649
00:58:35,756 --> 00:58:38,031
Got any woollens? He'll buy them.

650
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:40,710
He wants all the homespun in Galilee.

651
00:58:40,796 --> 00:58:43,469
- Who is he?
- The Roman merchant.

652
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:45,592
He's paying well over market prices.

653
00:58:45,676 --> 00:58:50,830
Says homespun is coming into style in
Rome. The fine ladies dye it fancy colours.

654
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:53,111
Maybe he'll buy this.

655
00:58:55,596 --> 00:58:58,235
Look what he paid me,
and there was a moth hole in it.

656
00:58:58,316 --> 00:59:02,104
I wouldn't have used that rag of mine
for a donkey blanket.

657
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:15,187
Look.

658
00:59:21,156 --> 00:59:23,306
Wait.

659
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:25,956
You've paid more than you should have.

660
00:59:26,556 --> 00:59:28,547
Is this how we were taught?

661
00:59:28,636 --> 00:59:31,469
Do we pray to be washed of the sin of greed

662
00:59:31,956 --> 00:59:36,154
only to close the book,
and cheat the stranger in our midst?

663
00:59:36,236 --> 00:59:40,707
Well, I'm not ashamed, Justus. This money
comes from the taxes that grind us down.

664
00:59:40,796 --> 00:59:43,356
Does one crime erase another?

665
00:59:43,436 --> 00:59:47,270
Friends, shall we turn dishonest
because life is hard?

666
00:59:52,036 --> 00:59:54,152
I think you gave me too much.

667
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,027
Thank you, friend.

668
01:00:25,116 --> 01:00:27,425
I hope you'll forgive my neighbours.

669
01:00:27,516 --> 01:00:31,350
I wasn't angry. A man is not cheated
when he's satisfied with the price.

670
01:00:31,436 --> 01:00:35,349
But you weren't the real loser.
They were only cheating themselves.

671
01:00:35,436 --> 01:00:37,427
Good day.

672
01:00:38,956 --> 01:00:40,947
Wait.

673
01:00:42,956 --> 01:00:46,551
I'd like to camp overnight here.
Can you suggest a place?

674
01:00:46,636 --> 01:00:48,831
I'd be glad to.

675
01:00:50,556 --> 01:00:53,275
You seem to have great influence here.

676
01:00:53,356 --> 01:00:56,632
Well, when age speaks,
youth listens, sometimes.

677
01:00:56,716 --> 01:00:58,707
That's not what I mean.

678
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:01,788
- Are you their leader?
- I'm only a weaver.

679
01:01:03,036 --> 01:01:07,154
Few travellers come to Cana.
What's the news from the great world?

680
01:01:08,796 --> 01:01:13,074
The world's the same. But I've heard
that some new ideas have sprung up.

681
01:01:13,156 --> 01:01:15,147
Ideas are...

682
01:01:15,996 --> 01:01:19,306
Ideas are important. They grow like children.

683
01:01:20,236 --> 01:01:23,626
- Have you any children?
- Several. And a grandchild.

684
01:01:24,276 --> 01:01:28,986
We call him Jonathan, because he was born
with a crooked foot, like Jonathan of old.

685
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:30,555
Jonathan of old?

686
01:01:30,636 --> 01:01:33,594
I don't suppose they teach
our history in Roman schools.

687
01:01:33,676 --> 01:01:35,667
- Jonathan.
- Yes?

688
01:01:36,716 --> 01:01:38,308
Wait for me.

689
01:01:38,396 --> 01:01:41,433
- Didn't you tell me he was crippled?
- He's well now.

690
01:01:41,516 --> 01:01:43,791
Jonathan, this is...

691
01:01:44,716 --> 01:01:47,594
Caius Marcellus. How are you, Jonathan?

692
01:01:47,676 --> 01:01:50,952
- I'm fine, thank you. Are these your donkeys?
- Yes.

693
01:01:51,036 --> 01:01:54,312
Behind this house there's
a good place to camp, and a well.

694
01:01:54,396 --> 01:01:56,910
Jonathan, come along.
It's time for you to eat.

695
01:01:56,996 --> 01:02:00,272
- Already? It's early.
- Perhaps he would like a ride on a donkey.

696
01:02:00,356 --> 01:02:02,665
- May I?
- Of course.

697
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:06,112
What's more, you can keep him.
From now on he's Jonathan's donkey.

698
01:02:06,196 --> 01:02:08,835
- Mine?
- You are very generous, sir.

699
01:02:08,916 --> 01:02:11,225
No. I'm still in your debt.

700
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:14,067
Is he one of us, Grandfather?

701
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:18,747
You are, or you wouldn't be giving things
away. Did Jesus tell you to do that?

702
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:21,714
You must have known him.
He straightened my foot.

703
01:02:21,796 --> 01:02:23,787
- There you are.
- Go. Go.

704
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:26,674
Fast, go. Grandfather, look, I'm riding.

705
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:30,066
I'm riding my own donkey.
Look, everybody. He's mine.

706
01:02:30,156 --> 01:02:32,465
David, look. He's my donkey. Mine.

707
01:02:32,876 --> 01:02:36,186
Look, everybody. The man
down there gave him to me.

708
01:02:43,076 --> 01:02:46,113
Jesus used to live near here,
you know. In Nazareth.

709
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:48,551
Almost everyone in Cana knew him.

710
01:03:43,356 --> 01:03:48,225
Now upon the first day of the week

711
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:53,114
Very early in the morning

712
01:03:53,556 --> 01:03:57,947
We came unto the sepulchre

713
01:03:58,516 --> 01:04:04,113
And found the stone rolled away, rolled away

714
01:04:05,316 --> 01:04:09,355
The great stone

715
01:04:09,756 --> 01:04:13,192
Was rolled away

716
01:04:13,876 --> 01:04:19,030
And we entered into the sepulchre

717
01:04:19,516 --> 01:04:26,866
And found not the body of Jesus

718
01:04:29,316 --> 01:04:36,950
And lo, a voice spake to us, saying:

719
01:04:37,676 --> 01:04:45,264
"Why seek ye the living
among the dead, among the dead?"

720
01:04:45,876 --> 01:04:53,988
"O seek not the living among the dead. "

721
01:04:54,636 --> 01:04:59,630
"For he said unto you in Galilee

722
01:04:59,956 --> 01:05:04,029
The Son of Man must be delivered

723
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:09,986
Into the hands of sinful men

724
01:05:11,516 --> 01:05:20,311
And be crucified and rise again, rise again. "

725
01:05:20,556 --> 01:05:26,950
"The Son of Man must rise again. "

726
01:05:28,036 --> 01:05:33,747
And lo, Jesus appeared to us

727
01:05:34,116 --> 01:05:38,712
And showed us his wounds

728
01:05:39,116 --> 01:05:45,510
And he said unto us there:

729
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:52,515
"Go ye therefore, the blessed

730
01:05:52,756 --> 01:05:58,069
And teach all the nations. "

731
01:05:58,716 --> 01:06:04,188
"And I am with you always. "

732
01:06:04,516 --> 01:06:08,828
"I am with you. "

733
01:06:09,316 --> 01:06:15,232
"I am with you

734
01:06:15,836 --> 01:06:29,352
Even to the end of the world. "

735
01:06:53,436 --> 01:06:56,109
- Who is she?
- Her name is Miriam.

736
01:06:56,716 --> 01:07:00,755
You've seen my grandson.
Miriam is another on whom Jesus looked.

737
01:07:01,436 --> 01:07:03,825
Another miracle?

738
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:06,111
If you want to use the word.

739
01:07:06,196 --> 01:07:09,427
When she was 15,
she was struck down by paralysis.

740
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:13,634
It left her hopelessly crippled,
and hopelessly bitter about life.

741
01:07:13,716 --> 01:07:19,268
She ate herself away with hate and consumed
everyone with her envy and malice.

742
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:30,466
- But she's still a cripple. She can't walk.
- No, she can't.

743
01:07:30,556 --> 01:07:32,990
If he was such a magician,
why didn't he cure her?

744
01:07:33,076 --> 01:07:35,067
He did.

745
01:07:35,156 --> 01:07:37,351
I don't understand.

746
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:40,066
- Have you had supper?
- No.

747
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,750
Perhaps you will honour my poor house.

748
01:07:44,396 --> 01:07:46,387
Thank you.

749
01:07:51,156 --> 01:07:53,989
Then one day there was
a wedding here in Cana.

750
01:07:54,556 --> 01:07:57,673
The whole village took
part in it, all but Miriam.

751
01:07:58,276 --> 01:08:00,471
She stayed home and wept.

752
01:08:00,556 --> 01:08:04,947
A wedding, you see, when no man
would look at her and her twisted body.

753
01:08:05,436 --> 01:08:09,554
But when her parents returned to the house,
they found her, as she is now,

754
01:08:09,636 --> 01:08:12,230
as you saw her, smiling and singing.

755
01:08:13,036 --> 01:08:15,266
Was Jesus at the wedding?

756
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:18,348
Yes. But he came late.

757
01:08:19,756 --> 01:08:22,554
So now she spends her time
singing fables about the man.

758
01:08:22,636 --> 01:08:24,786
But they're not fables.

759
01:08:24,876 --> 01:08:28,186
Surely you don't believe
that he rose from the dead?

760
01:08:28,276 --> 01:08:30,471
He lives more surely than we do.

761
01:08:30,556 --> 01:08:34,947
He's dead. And no moonstruck girl
can sing him back to life again.

762
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:38,312
How do you know that he's dead?

763
01:08:41,436 --> 01:08:43,631
A soldier told me.

764
01:08:43,716 --> 01:08:47,504
A soldier who saw
the lance thrust into his side.

765
01:08:49,476 --> 01:08:51,512
A soldier who was...

766
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,309
who was out there!

767
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,591
What's wrong?

768
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:00,191
Were you out there?

769
01:09:00,596 --> 01:09:03,190
You're ill. Let me help you.

770
01:09:03,276 --> 01:09:05,744
No. Let me alone.

771
01:09:07,516 --> 01:09:10,713
Since the voyage, I've been indisposed.

772
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,711
Forgive me.

773
01:09:34,556 --> 01:09:38,674
My master. These Romans drink
like pigs, but they pay well.

774
01:09:51,956 --> 01:09:54,629
- What do you want?
- I have news.

775
01:09:54,716 --> 01:09:57,276
This pedlar outside is fresh from Jerusalem.

776
01:09:57,356 --> 01:10:02,305
He says the governor has ordered the arrest
of all these fanatics called Christians.

777
01:10:02,396 --> 01:10:05,035
And for the leaders
they pay in gold, generously.

778
01:10:05,116 --> 01:10:07,505
Justus is a leader, no?

779
01:10:07,596 --> 01:10:11,953
I act under an imperial commission,
and I report to Tiberius, not to Pilate.

780
01:10:12,036 --> 01:10:15,153
Fine. You are a rich tribune.

781
01:10:15,236 --> 01:10:18,034
But what harm is it if I get
a few extra coins out of this?

782
01:10:18,116 --> 01:10:21,711
Justus on the cross is worth
a year of good wine to me.

783
01:10:29,196 --> 01:10:31,391
- Get back to Damascus, Abidor.
- But...

784
01:10:31,476 --> 01:10:33,467
Leave now. Tonight.

785
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:39,190
You won't get rid of me
so easily, worthy merchant.

786
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:42,712
These Galileans are poor, but
they might pay well to know who you are.

787
01:10:42,796 --> 01:10:47,631
And you are the man who crucified him.
You are his murderer, they are saying.

788
01:10:47,716 --> 01:10:50,025
Stop! You are hurting me!

789
01:11:03,516 --> 01:11:05,711
Let's go. Come on.

790
01:11:06,196 --> 01:11:08,073
Kick him. Kick him.

791
01:11:08,156 --> 01:11:11,114
- Kick him harder. Let's go.
- I'm kicking.

792
01:11:11,196 --> 01:11:13,391
Go on, kick him. He'll go.

793
01:11:13,476 --> 01:11:16,627
Kick him, that's it. He'll go. Kick him.

794
01:11:16,716 --> 01:11:18,832
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

795
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:20,907
- Kick him.
- Jonathan, isn't it?

796
01:11:20,996 --> 01:11:23,191
- Yes.
- Letting your friend have a ride?

797
01:11:23,276 --> 01:11:26,393
- No, I gave him the donkey.
- You gave him the donkey?

798
01:11:26,476 --> 01:11:31,266
- Did your grandfather tell you to do that?
- No, sir. I did it myself.

799
01:11:34,196 --> 01:11:36,585
Why are you so angry?

800
01:11:37,556 --> 01:11:39,547
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

801
01:11:40,556 --> 01:11:42,945
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

802
01:11:43,036 --> 01:11:45,755
I sit here so that I can watch people pass.

803
01:11:45,836 --> 01:11:49,067
Well, wouldn't you be angry?
I gave him the donkey for himself.

804
01:11:49,156 --> 01:11:51,954
Then it doesn't matter what he does with it.

805
01:11:53,556 --> 01:11:55,069
I suppose not.

806
01:11:55,156 --> 01:11:57,511
Is it that you resent
what our master taught us?

807
01:11:57,596 --> 01:12:00,554
Why should I resent it?
He means nothing to me.

808
01:12:00,836 --> 01:12:03,430
Then why do you consider him your enemy?

809
01:12:05,516 --> 01:12:08,394
You see, we know
why you're here, Marcellus.

810
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:14,354
It's simple, really. No merchant, even
a stupid one, would have paid those prices.

811
01:12:14,756 --> 01:12:17,429
And the look of you, those shoulders.

812
01:12:17,836 --> 01:12:20,225
We guessed at once what you were.

813
01:12:21,956 --> 01:12:25,187
Sit down, please, here in
the shade. The sun's hot.

814
01:12:29,796 --> 01:12:32,708
Why must you do this, Marcellus?
Is it for Rome?

815
01:12:35,796 --> 01:12:37,946
Yes.

816
01:12:38,036 --> 01:12:41,312
And for myself, to save my reason.

817
01:12:43,156 --> 01:12:45,624
Justus said you were ill.

818
01:12:45,716 --> 01:12:47,308
- There's one who can help.
- No.

819
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:51,025
- He was crucified. That was the end of him.
- That was the beginning.

820
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:54,825
He's with his Father, but he left his word
with us and taught us how to use it.

821
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:57,555
Don't confess to sorcery.
You'll make things worse.

822
01:12:57,636 --> 01:13:01,231
He was no sorcerer, Marcellus.
He cast no spells.

823
01:13:01,316 --> 01:13:06,549
He only asked two things of us: "Love God",
he said, "and love ye one another. "

824
01:13:07,356 --> 01:13:12,350
And he meant not only the Jews, but
Romans and Greeks, slaves and soldiers,

825
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:15,270
the strong and the weak, everyone.

826
01:13:15,756 --> 01:13:19,544
He asked us to build our lives
on this love, this charity.

827
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:24,547
- To build a new world.
- Worlds are built on force, not charity.

828
01:13:24,636 --> 01:13:26,627
Power is all that counts.

829
01:13:26,716 --> 01:13:30,595
Perhaps we have something
better than power. We have hope.

830
01:13:32,596 --> 01:13:34,985
That you of all people should say that.

831
01:13:35,596 --> 01:13:37,632
What do you mean, Marcellus?

832
01:13:37,716 --> 01:13:41,550
You say he could work miracles,
but he left you as he found you.

833
01:13:41,636 --> 01:13:44,150
I used to wonder at that myself,

834
01:13:44,236 --> 01:13:46,670
until faith taught me the answer.

835
01:13:47,276 --> 01:13:52,430
He could have healed my body, and it would
have been natural for me to laugh and sing.

836
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:57,226
And then I came to understand that
he had done something even better for me.

837
01:13:57,836 --> 01:14:00,111
He'd chosen me for his work.

838
01:14:00,196 --> 01:14:03,825
He'd left me as I am so that all others like me

839
01:14:04,556 --> 01:14:10,153
might know that misfortune needn't deprive
them of happiness within his kingdom.

840
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:14,354
It's beyond reason that
anybody should think as you do.

841
01:14:14,436 --> 01:14:18,873
If you had only known him,
looked into his eyes, heard him speak...

842
01:14:19,156 --> 01:14:21,431
- I did.
- I don't understand.

843
01:14:21,516 --> 01:14:24,076
Please. It's enough.

844
01:14:26,356 --> 01:14:28,711
You're in no danger from me.

845
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:31,346
I'm leaving. Now.

846
01:14:31,436 --> 01:14:33,631
- We hoped you'd stay.
- Do you want to die?

847
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:35,911
- Of course not.
- Then let me go.

848
01:14:36,756 --> 01:14:39,065
No one's holding you, Marcellus.

849
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:47,186
But a man came here this morning
I wanted you to meet, the big fisherman.

850
01:14:49,236 --> 01:14:51,704
- Fisherman?
- Simon the Galilean.

851
01:14:52,316 --> 01:14:54,671
The one Jesus called Peter.

852
01:14:56,836 --> 01:14:58,747
Did he come alone?

853
01:14:58,836 --> 01:15:02,112
No, he has a companion, a Greek.

854
01:15:02,196 --> 01:15:04,107
Where are they?

855
01:15:04,196 --> 01:15:07,347
At Shalum's inn. It's not far from here.

856
01:15:10,196 --> 01:15:12,391
Marcellus?

857
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:17,428
I don't know what's in your heart.
I've tried to tell you what's in mine.

858
01:15:17,516 --> 01:15:20,906
But it's clear that you're troubled,
and I wish I could help you.

859
01:15:20,996 --> 01:15:24,466
Every man must find his own way,
but sometimes it's a comfort

860
01:15:24,556 --> 01:15:28,265
to know that others, too,
have felt confused and lost.

861
01:15:28,676 --> 01:15:31,065
Don't lose heart, Marcellus.

862
01:15:31,156 --> 01:15:35,035
The way is never easy,
but it's a path good men must take.

863
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:38,425
I hope you'll find yours.

864
01:15:55,716 --> 01:15:58,105
The Greek, Demetrius. Where is he?

865
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:00,985
Up the stairs. The first door you see.

866
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:14,510
Stand up in the presence of your master.

867
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:21,584
That robe. Where is it?

868
01:16:23,676 --> 01:16:25,871
The robe?

869
01:16:30,156 --> 01:16:32,147
- Here.
- Keep away.

870
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,947
Sir, you look ill.

871
01:16:35,036 --> 01:16:37,231
There. Burn it.

872
01:16:37,636 --> 01:16:39,831
- Why?
- It cast a spell on me.

873
01:16:39,916 --> 01:16:42,635
- It couldn't.
- I order you to burn it. Now.

874
01:16:42,716 --> 01:16:46,755
Why are you afraid of it? I'm not.
It brings me close to the one who wore it.

875
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:49,145
I've ordered you to burn it.

876
01:16:49,796 --> 01:16:52,151
That you will have to do yourself.

877
01:16:54,196 --> 01:16:57,552
I'll have you whipped
and sold as a galley slave.

878
01:16:57,636 --> 01:16:59,706
I'll teach you who's master here.

879
01:16:59,796 --> 01:17:01,991
I know who my master is.

880
01:17:04,796 --> 01:17:08,425
You're afraid, but you don't
really know the reason why.

881
01:17:09,436 --> 01:17:12,189
You think it's his robe that made you ill.

882
01:17:12,276 --> 01:17:15,552
But it's your own conscience,
your own decent shame.

883
01:17:15,636 --> 01:17:18,275
Even when you crucified him you felt it.

884
01:17:18,356 --> 01:17:21,189
The spell isn't in here,
it's in your heart and your mind.

885
01:17:21,276 --> 01:17:24,905
Face it, Marcellus. Don't be afraid of him.

886
01:17:24,996 --> 01:17:27,305
He'd understand you.

887
01:17:27,396 --> 01:17:29,785
He had compassion for all men.

888
01:17:30,556 --> 01:17:32,353
Marcellus.

889
01:17:32,436 --> 01:17:34,666
It was for your sake that he died.

890
01:17:34,756 --> 01:17:36,747
For the sake of all of us.

891
01:17:36,836 --> 01:17:39,031
No. No. No.

892
01:18:03,556 --> 01:18:05,865
I am not afraid.

893
01:18:09,316 --> 01:18:11,511
I'm not afraid.

894
01:18:17,956 --> 01:18:21,949
Until now, you only remembered
what you did to a man.

895
01:18:23,716 --> 01:18:26,025
The wrong, and your shame.

896
01:18:26,636 --> 01:18:30,345
But now you remember the man.

897
01:19:08,756 --> 01:19:10,951
Come, let me present you.

898
01:19:13,596 --> 01:19:15,826
Marcellus Gallio, tribune of Rome.

899
01:19:16,436 --> 01:19:18,427
Peter, fisherman of Galilee.

900
01:19:18,516 --> 01:19:21,235
A humble subject of the empire
is honoured, Tribune.

901
01:19:21,316 --> 01:19:23,705
I think the honour is mine, sir.

902
01:19:24,356 --> 01:19:27,075
Everybody, move closer.

903
01:19:28,116 --> 01:19:31,950
Sit down, children. Closer, everybody.

904
01:19:32,676 --> 01:19:35,907
Sit down. I want to talk to you.

905
01:19:37,196 --> 01:19:42,907
Neighbours and friends, many of us
were privileged to know our master.

906
01:19:43,476 --> 01:19:47,867
But none was as close to him
as our friend Simon of Galilee,

907
01:19:48,476 --> 01:19:52,389
whom he loved as his own brother,
and whom he called Peter.

908
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:59,188
On that terrible night when he was betrayed,
when some doubted and all fled his side,

909
01:19:59,276 --> 01:20:03,986
only Peter remained steadfast,
loyal to the end.

910
01:20:04,076 --> 01:20:07,148
You may speak in a moment, Peter.
Now it's my turn.

911
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:11,070
And so, my neighbours, on this happy day,

912
01:20:11,156 --> 01:20:13,954
I welcome you here to honour...

913
01:20:25,956 --> 01:20:28,345
Stop it. Stop it!

914
01:20:32,396 --> 01:20:34,705
Stop it. Stay where you are.

915
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:37,631
Advance. Advance.

916
01:20:38,316 --> 01:20:40,307
Halt.

917
01:20:42,116 --> 01:20:45,153
Well, Tribune. Your new command?

918
01:20:48,236 --> 01:20:51,387
Centurion, by what authority
do you attack these people?

919
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:53,990
I need no authority
to clean out a nest of traitors.

920
01:20:54,076 --> 01:20:57,466
- Withdraw your men.
- And your authority, Tribune?

921
01:20:58,716 --> 01:21:01,389
- An imperial commission.
- I know you have it.

922
01:21:01,476 --> 01:21:04,309
But it's no longer in effect.
Tiberius is dead.

923
01:21:05,196 --> 01:21:08,393
Caligula is emperor.
Hits you hard, doesn't it?

924
01:21:09,236 --> 01:21:11,227
- Men.
- Wait.

925
01:21:12,436 --> 01:21:17,829
An imperial commission is good until it is
revoked by the emperor, whoever he may be.

926
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:20,305
- Have you new orders from Caligula?
- No, but...

927
01:21:20,396 --> 01:21:22,591
Then obey mine.

928
01:21:30,676 --> 01:21:32,871
Make me obey, Tribune.

929
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:37,193
No. You won't try, will you?

930
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:39,916
Brave enough with a dice, or a cup of wine.

931
01:21:39,996 --> 01:21:44,194
A tribune because you bear an important
name, because you have friends at court.

932
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:48,349
Well, you outrank me, but
I earned my rank, every step of it,

933
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:52,634
in Gaul and Iberia and Africa,
against the enemies of Rome.

934
01:21:54,196 --> 01:21:56,391
With this.

935
01:21:58,116 --> 01:22:00,232
Make me obey you, Tribune,

936
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:02,871
if you're fool enough to try.

937
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:09,948
You are a fool.

938
01:22:10,036 --> 01:22:14,154
I've split more men from head to foot
than you see in this square.

939
01:22:14,236 --> 01:22:17,831
If I win, you'll keep your word?
You'll withdraw your men?

940
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:20,635
If you win, they'll be yours to command.

941
01:22:21,196 --> 01:22:23,391
I'll be dead.

942
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:08,708
Well? What are you waiting for?

943
01:24:09,716 --> 01:24:11,911
Finish it.

944
01:24:25,716 --> 01:24:28,549
You may give that order now, Centurion.

945
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:04,356
Column! Form square!

946
01:25:17,516 --> 01:25:19,507
Prepare to march.

947
01:25:19,596 --> 01:25:21,791
Formation, turn.

948
01:25:22,556 --> 01:25:24,706
Column forward.

949
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:30,107
Marcellus?

950
01:26:39,756 --> 01:26:41,986
Demetrius and I will leave in the morning.

951
01:26:42,076 --> 01:26:46,866
We go to Syria, Lebanon, then Greece,
Sicily, and finally Rome itself.

952
01:26:47,756 --> 01:26:49,747
Everywhere we'll find friends.

953
01:26:49,836 --> 01:26:51,827
Everywhere our movement grows.

954
01:26:52,516 --> 01:26:54,666
And you, Marcellus?

955
01:26:54,756 --> 01:26:57,065
I suppose I'll go back to Rome.

956
01:26:57,156 --> 01:27:00,307
Demetrius and I
wondered if you'd come with us.

957
01:27:00,396 --> 01:27:03,991
- You want me?
- We can always use courage and devotion.

958
01:27:05,236 --> 01:27:07,272
No. No.

959
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:11,592
- It's impossible. I can never be one of you.
- Why not?

960
01:27:12,476 --> 01:27:15,786
Marcellus, is there
something you want to tell me?

961
01:27:17,676 --> 01:27:19,667
Yes.

962
01:27:21,116 --> 01:27:23,107
Yes.

963
01:27:26,436 --> 01:27:28,950
- I'll try.
- If it will make it easier,

964
01:27:29,036 --> 01:27:31,755
let me tell you about the burden I carry.

965
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:35,553
You heard Justus say
I was steadfast and loyal.

966
01:27:36,276 --> 01:27:38,471
He didn't know.

967
01:27:38,556 --> 01:27:41,309
The night Jesus needed
me most, I denied him.

968
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:47,592
Not once, but three times.
I swore I never knew him.

969
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:50,466
Now.

970
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:56,105
I crucified him.

971
01:27:57,556 --> 01:28:00,548
I know. Demetrius told me.

972
01:28:04,316 --> 01:28:06,466
And you can forgive me?

973
01:28:07,076 --> 01:28:09,271
He forgave you from the cross.

974
01:28:09,876 --> 01:28:12,026
Can I do less?

975
01:28:14,156 --> 01:28:16,954
Now, does anything stand in your way?

976
01:28:17,836 --> 01:28:20,031
Can you be one of us?

977
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:24,826
From this day on,

978
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:27,305
I'm enlisted in his service.

979
01:28:27,716 --> 01:28:31,231
I offer him my sword, my fortune and my life.

980
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:35,194
And this I pledge you
on my honour as a Roman.

981
01:29:11,956 --> 01:29:14,550
- Will you wait for me here, please?
- Yes, my lady.

982
01:29:24,956 --> 01:29:27,265
The emperor will see you now.

983
01:29:54,436 --> 01:29:57,234
The lady Diana, as beautiful as ever.

984
01:29:58,236 --> 01:30:01,751
- And as cold.
- You commanded my presence here, sire.

985
01:30:01,836 --> 01:30:06,387
- Only because my invitations were ignored.
- I sent word that I was ill.

986
01:30:06,476 --> 01:30:11,755
And you have chosen to be a guest of
Senator Gallio, who bears me no great love.

987
01:30:12,956 --> 01:30:16,266
Shouldn't I consider
such behaviour an affront?

988
01:30:17,356 --> 01:30:19,347
You are the emperor, sire.

989
01:30:19,436 --> 01:30:21,870
It is not in my power to affront you.

990
01:30:21,956 --> 01:30:24,186
Good. Good.

991
01:30:25,596 --> 01:30:30,067
Tell me, what news have the Gallios had
of their precious son Marcellus?

992
01:30:31,596 --> 01:30:33,791
- None, sire.
- And you.

993
01:30:34,636 --> 01:30:36,866
He must have written to you.

994
01:30:38,876 --> 01:30:41,106
Not for almost a year.

995
01:30:41,196 --> 01:30:44,586
His last letter was from
a village in Palestine called Cana.

996
01:30:44,676 --> 01:30:46,507
And nothing since then?

997
01:30:46,596 --> 01:30:51,112
Nothing from Antioch,
or Ephesus, or Corinth?

998
01:30:54,716 --> 01:30:57,184
You are telling the truth, aren't you?

999
01:30:58,196 --> 01:31:02,314
Poor Diana. He's played
you false, like the rest of us.

1000
01:31:02,396 --> 01:31:05,672
- What do you mean?
- I mean he's here in Rome,

1001
01:31:05,756 --> 01:31:07,747
and has been for some time.

1002
01:31:07,836 --> 01:31:10,430
- That's impossible.
- He fooled me, too.

1003
01:31:10,516 --> 01:31:12,905
I thought he was only a wastrel and a clown.

1004
01:31:12,996 --> 01:31:15,954
He's become one of the most
dangerous men in the empire,

1005
01:31:16,036 --> 01:31:18,504
a traitor and a conspirator against the state.

1006
01:31:18,596 --> 01:31:21,474
- No. Not Marcellus.
- That's why he hasn't come to you,

1007
01:31:21,556 --> 01:31:23,911
or his family, or his friends.

1008
01:31:23,996 --> 01:31:28,433
You've heard of this new sect, these fanatics
who call themselves Christians?

1009
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:31,588
- He's one of them, one of the ringleaders.
- It can't be true.

1010
01:31:31,676 --> 01:31:34,668
No? Then come. I'll show you.

1011
01:31:37,236 --> 01:31:42,105
You'll learn for yourself what kind of man
it is you preferred to your emperor.

1012
01:31:44,316 --> 01:31:46,511
Where is he?

1013
01:31:55,596 --> 01:31:58,349
Marcellus's personal slave, remember?

1014
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:01,865
The day he dared to bid against me.

1015
01:32:02,556 --> 01:32:04,547
But now no longer a slave.

1016
01:32:04,636 --> 01:32:06,911
His partner in treason.

1017
01:32:07,676 --> 01:32:09,985
- Has he talked?
- No, sire.

1018
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:13,706
- Ask him again.
- Where is Tribune Gallio?

1019
01:32:15,476 --> 01:32:17,467
Where's he hiding?

1020
01:32:17,556 --> 01:32:19,547
Give him the wheel.

1021
01:32:25,116 --> 01:32:27,266
Three of them came here from Corinth.

1022
01:32:27,356 --> 01:32:31,554
The Greek slave, a Jewish
fisherman, our loyal tribune.

1023
01:32:31,636 --> 01:32:34,469
We've caught one. Soon we'll have the others.

1024
01:32:34,556 --> 01:32:36,433
Where is he?

1025
01:32:36,636 --> 01:32:38,831
Give it to him.

1026
01:32:40,236 --> 01:32:43,114
Enough for now. He's no good to us dead.

1027
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:45,791
Let him think about it for a while.

1028
01:32:58,836 --> 01:33:01,031
My lady. What's wrong?

1029
01:33:02,956 --> 01:33:04,912
It's Marcellus.

1030
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:07,032
They say he's alive.

1031
01:33:07,116 --> 01:33:09,311
He's here in Rome.

1032
01:33:10,196 --> 01:33:12,505
- Who told you that?
- The emperor.

1033
01:33:14,516 --> 01:33:17,314
They have his slave in there.
They're torturing him.

1034
01:33:17,396 --> 01:33:20,308
- Demetrius is here in the palace?
- I saw him.

1035
01:33:21,076 --> 01:33:23,271
You're sure?

1036
01:33:27,036 --> 01:33:29,027
What is it, Marcipor?

1037
01:33:29,116 --> 01:33:31,311
What do you know about it?

1038
01:33:34,596 --> 01:33:36,791
You've seen Marcellus.

1039
01:33:37,716 --> 01:33:40,594
You're one of them. A Christian.

1040
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:43,107
Yes, my lady.

1041
01:33:44,476 --> 01:33:46,467
Take me to him.

1042
01:33:47,676 --> 01:33:50,190
- I can't.
- Do you think I'd betray him?

1043
01:33:50,276 --> 01:33:52,471
Take me to him.

1044
01:33:54,636 --> 01:33:56,433
Come.

1045
01:35:09,556 --> 01:35:11,751
Wait here.

1046
01:35:35,876 --> 01:35:39,755
- Where have they got Demetrius?
- In the armoury, below the guardroom.

1047
01:35:41,476 --> 01:35:43,671
I know the place.

1048
01:35:45,676 --> 01:35:48,190
- Where's Peter?
- At the meeting in Bovillae.

1049
01:35:48,276 --> 01:35:52,349
- He won't be back until midnight.
- Right. We can't wait for him.

1050
01:35:54,076 --> 01:35:57,546
Get me ten volunteers to come
with me as soon as it's dark.

1051
01:35:57,636 --> 01:35:59,308
I'll go, Marcipor.

1052
01:36:09,156 --> 01:36:12,353
Why didn't you come?
Why have you kept away from me?

1053
01:36:13,156 --> 01:36:15,511
I would have come, soon.

1054
01:36:15,596 --> 01:36:17,985
But Caligula's decreed against us.

1055
01:36:18,516 --> 01:36:21,110
- He said...
- I can imagine what he said.

1056
01:36:22,996 --> 01:36:25,556
Whatever you are, you're not a traitor.

1057
01:36:26,556 --> 01:36:28,865
- If you're still ill...
- No.

1058
01:36:28,956 --> 01:36:32,744
I'm well. Really well,
for the first time in my life.

1059
01:36:36,516 --> 01:36:38,586
You found the robe?

1060
01:36:38,676 --> 01:36:40,667
Yes.

1061
01:36:43,636 --> 01:36:45,831
Here it is.

1062
01:36:48,236 --> 01:36:50,227
Here.

1063
01:36:51,236 --> 01:36:53,625
Why, it's just ordinary homespun.

1064
01:36:54,436 --> 01:36:57,155
- Was it really bewitched?
- In a way.

1065
01:36:57,916 --> 01:37:01,352
It changed my life.
In time, it will change the world.

1066
01:37:04,556 --> 01:37:06,751
I don't understand.

1067
01:37:10,036 --> 01:37:12,869
It's a long story. And a strange one.

1068
01:37:13,836 --> 01:37:16,066
- About the robe?
- Yes.

1069
01:37:16,476 --> 01:37:19,354
About the robe, and the one who wore it.

1070
01:37:31,916 --> 01:37:33,907
- It's nearly dark.
- Good.

1071
01:37:33,996 --> 01:37:36,590
Send Marcipor to me when he comes back.

1072
01:37:43,036 --> 01:37:45,072
Why are you dressed like that?

1073
01:37:45,156 --> 01:37:47,351
No, Marcellus. They'll kill you.

1074
01:37:47,756 --> 01:37:51,146
- You must have faith.
- Faith in what? This new god of yours?

1075
01:37:51,236 --> 01:37:55,468
He couldn't save his own Son.
They crucified him and they'll kill you, too.

1076
01:37:55,556 --> 01:37:58,673
- I can't leave Demetrius to be tortured.
- But you'll leave me.

1077
01:37:58,756 --> 01:38:03,147
I love you. Does this dream of yours
mean more to you than our love?

1078
01:38:05,156 --> 01:38:09,752
Marcellus, what you've told me
is a beautiful story, but it isn't true.

1079
01:38:10,356 --> 01:38:14,508
Justice and charity. Men will
never accept such a philosophy.

1080
01:38:14,596 --> 01:38:18,874
The world isn't like that.
It never has been, and it never will be.

1081
01:38:20,476 --> 01:38:23,354
Why must you throw
your life away for a slave?

1082
01:38:24,356 --> 01:38:26,950
I owe him a great deal more than my life.

1083
01:38:33,756 --> 01:38:37,385
If your god means that much to you,
I won't stand in your way.

1084
01:38:39,276 --> 01:38:41,949
I want to be your wife whatever you believe.

1085
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:45,911
I'd marry you if I had to
share you with a thousand gods.

1086
01:38:50,356 --> 01:38:52,347
Ready.

1087
01:38:52,436 --> 01:38:54,631
Oh, my love.

1088
01:39:00,956 --> 01:39:03,151
Take her home.

1089
01:39:04,236 --> 01:39:06,909
Diana, I'll come to you as soon as I can.

1090
01:39:07,916 --> 01:39:10,111
Keep the robe for me.

1091
01:39:36,516 --> 01:39:39,474
- Sentry, come with me.
- What's the watchword, Tribune?

1092
01:39:39,556 --> 01:39:42,753
- Hurry, you fool.
- Guard!

1093
01:39:44,556 --> 01:39:46,751
Who's there?

1094
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,306
Stop. You. Stop.

1095
01:40:19,036 --> 01:40:21,231
Get the boy up.

1096
01:40:48,556 --> 01:40:51,275
On the emperor's business. Open up.

1097
01:40:51,516 --> 01:40:53,313
What business, Tribune?

1098
01:40:53,396 --> 01:40:56,274
If you're in command, my message is for you.

1099
01:40:56,676 --> 01:41:00,191
You're not one of the Praetorian tribunes.
I know them all.

1100
01:41:00,276 --> 01:41:02,471
Now!

1101
01:41:03,676 --> 01:41:05,746
The keys. The keys, quick.

1102
01:41:20,876 --> 01:41:21,991
Quickly now.

1103
01:42:20,756 --> 01:42:25,352
I can't believe you let them take
an imperial prisoner from the palace itself.

1104
01:42:26,116 --> 01:42:29,153
Tribune Quintus, where
were you when this happened?

1105
01:42:29,236 --> 01:42:32,626
- I could send you to the galleys.
- The Greek was nearly dead.

1106
01:42:32,716 --> 01:42:36,425
- By now he's a corpse.
- The Greek? Who cares about the Greek?

1107
01:42:36,516 --> 01:42:39,235
Or the Jew fisherman
or any of the rest of them?

1108
01:42:39,316 --> 01:42:44,674
I want the Roman traitor who's responsible,
who made fools of the Praetorian Guard.

1109
01:42:44,756 --> 01:42:48,635
I want Tribune Gallio. I want him
in my hands before sunrise.

1110
01:42:49,036 --> 01:42:52,585
I want him alive. I want him
to stand before me alive.

1111
01:42:52,676 --> 01:42:55,873
Do you hear me? Find him
or you'll all go to the galleys.

1112
01:42:55,956 --> 01:42:59,187
Tear the city apart if you have to.
But find him!

1113
01:42:59,596 --> 01:43:01,826
Now, get out, all of you.

1114
01:43:01,916 --> 01:43:03,907
Go.

1115
01:43:12,116 --> 01:43:14,107
- Anything?
- No, sir.

1116
01:43:15,756 --> 01:43:17,348
- And you?
- No, sir.

1117
01:43:17,436 --> 01:43:19,427
- Upstairs?
- No, sir.

1118
01:43:20,916 --> 01:43:23,111
Detail, form.

1119
01:43:29,156 --> 01:43:31,226
Senator.

1120
01:43:31,316 --> 01:43:33,511
Detail, march.

1121
01:44:55,316 --> 01:44:58,706
- I can barely feel the heartbeat.
- He can't die.

1122
01:44:59,116 --> 01:45:03,394
- Is he such a valuable slave?
- He's one of the most valuable men alive.

1123
01:45:03,716 --> 01:45:06,947
- Well, he won't be alive for long.
- You're a physician.

1124
01:45:07,036 --> 01:45:09,504
There are limits to what science can achieve.

1125
01:45:09,596 --> 01:45:14,386
I can't put shattered flesh together again,
nor restore the blood he's lost.

1126
01:45:19,716 --> 01:45:23,709
Father in heaven, he was
the bravest and best of thy servants.

1127
01:45:25,316 --> 01:45:27,625
Why hast thou abandoned him?

1128
01:46:00,956 --> 01:46:03,470
Let me be alone with him.

1129
01:46:03,556 --> 01:46:06,070
You stay, Marcellus. And you, Diana.

1130
01:46:06,956 --> 01:46:09,789
Who is this man? Is he a physician?

1131
01:46:09,876 --> 01:46:11,867
No. Please go.

1132
01:46:18,556 --> 01:46:20,945
For my sake, sir. Please.

1133
01:46:34,756 --> 01:46:36,747
Demetrius.

1134
01:46:39,196 --> 01:46:41,187
Demetrius.

1135
01:46:55,396 --> 01:46:59,787
- What's he doing in there? Who is he?
- I've never seen him before.

1136
01:46:59,876 --> 01:47:03,949
Senator Gallio should inform himself
about what goes on in his own household,

1137
01:47:04,036 --> 01:47:06,470
with his own son.

1138
01:47:06,556 --> 01:47:09,946
This is my house, sir.
You were called here as a physician,

1139
01:47:10,036 --> 01:47:14,905
- not to question my family's behaviour.
- I'm a physician, but first of all a Roman.

1140
01:47:14,996 --> 01:47:17,305
And I must tell you bluntly that...

1141
01:48:01,876 --> 01:48:04,948
- He's gone?
- We didn't even thank him.

1142
01:48:06,556 --> 01:48:08,751
What did he do?

1143
01:48:09,916 --> 01:48:12,146
You were here. You saw it.

1144
01:48:13,076 --> 01:48:15,510
- Yes, he...
- Can't you speak?

1145
01:48:15,596 --> 01:48:17,746
Are you bewitched?

1146
01:48:18,556 --> 01:48:20,831
So that's it. Sorcery.

1147
01:48:21,716 --> 01:48:26,506
Doesn't your friend know the penalty
for pretending to heal by such methods?

1148
01:48:27,636 --> 01:48:29,627
Pretending?

1149
01:48:36,196 --> 01:48:40,792
Marius, you did everything
in your power, and we're grateful.

1150
01:48:40,876 --> 01:48:43,436
- Come, stay and eat with us.
- No, thank you.

1151
01:48:43,516 --> 01:48:45,746
There are mysteries to life and death, yes.

1152
01:48:45,836 --> 01:48:48,191
Patients have made astonishing recoveries.

1153
01:48:48,276 --> 01:48:52,508
But I have never ascribed them to the magic
of a sorcerer. Good night to you, Senator.

1154
01:48:52,596 --> 01:48:54,587
Tribune.

1155
01:49:01,596 --> 01:49:03,826
Do you think he'll go to Caligula?

1156
01:49:03,916 --> 01:49:07,306
I think he's a proud man
and his pride's been hurt.

1157
01:49:12,356 --> 01:49:16,554
Well, if your slave's fit to be moved,
you'd better take him back to the catacombs.

1158
01:49:16,636 --> 01:49:21,027
Marcipor? Order a carriage
and two men to help me with Demetrius.

1159
01:49:24,996 --> 01:49:26,634
Sir.

1160
01:49:27,796 --> 01:49:30,833
I'd like to see you again,
to tell you more about our...

1161
01:49:30,916 --> 01:49:33,714
We are seeing each other for the last time.

1162
01:49:34,716 --> 01:49:37,947
You have chosen to make
yourself an enemy of Rome.

1163
01:49:38,356 --> 01:49:40,745
From this night on, I have no son.

1164
01:49:50,956 --> 01:49:53,345
I've brought something for you.

1165
01:50:02,436 --> 01:50:05,155
Tomorrow I'll send for you.

1166
01:50:05,556 --> 01:50:07,547
- All ready, sir.
- Yes.

1167
01:50:11,916 --> 01:50:13,907
Tomorrow.

1168
01:51:02,996 --> 01:51:04,793
We're being followed.

1169
01:51:08,116 --> 01:51:10,311
Faster. Faster.

1170
01:51:58,356 --> 01:52:00,551
- Stop at the bridge.
- Yes, sir.

1171
01:52:12,596 --> 01:52:16,350
- No, don't.
- For all you've been to me, thanks.

1172
01:52:22,076 --> 01:52:24,067
Into the carriage.

1173
01:52:24,156 --> 01:52:26,351
Get him to Peter.

1174
01:52:29,356 --> 01:52:31,950
Goodbye, friend.

1175
01:52:33,596 --> 01:52:35,791
Goodbye, friend.

1176
01:53:05,916 --> 01:53:08,510
I can only give you a few moments.

1177
01:53:09,276 --> 01:53:11,267
Diana.

1178
01:53:18,116 --> 01:53:20,346
I prayed that I'd see you again.

1179
01:53:20,956 --> 01:53:23,629
We haven't much time, Marcellus, so listen.

1180
01:53:23,716 --> 01:53:28,028
Tomorrow you're to be put on trial
before the entire court.

1181
01:53:28,116 --> 01:53:30,789
- I never thought I'd get a trial.
- Your father's powerful.

1182
01:53:30,876 --> 01:53:35,347
Caligula can't just kill you.
He's forced to prove that you're guilty.

1183
01:53:35,436 --> 01:53:37,745
He'll have no trouble proving it.

1184
01:53:40,236 --> 01:53:42,466
It's up to you, Marcellus.

1185
01:53:44,476 --> 01:53:46,706
What do you want me to do?

1186
01:53:47,116 --> 01:53:49,346
Don't defy Caligula.

1187
01:53:50,356 --> 01:53:52,950
Your god doesn't want you to die. He can't.

1188
01:53:53,316 --> 01:53:56,911
Otherwise he wouldn't have
sent Peter to save Demetrius.

1189
01:53:57,676 --> 01:53:59,667
I'm afraid, Diana.

1190
01:54:02,316 --> 01:54:05,228
In Cana I lived with people
who were not afraid.

1191
01:54:05,836 --> 01:54:09,988
People who'd met Jesus face to face,
who'd spoken with him,

1192
01:54:10,996 --> 01:54:13,305
eaten and laughed with him.

1193
01:54:14,316 --> 01:54:18,150
A crippled girl who thought
herself fortunate to be lame.

1194
01:54:18,236 --> 01:54:23,151
A weaver whose words were like his work:
simple, and lasting, and strong.

1195
01:54:24,996 --> 01:54:27,669
A little boy who gave his donkey to a friend.

1196
01:54:28,556 --> 01:54:32,708
Never again in his life would he own
anything as fine as that donkey,

1197
01:54:32,796 --> 01:54:36,869
and yet he gave it happily,
without a second thought.

1198
01:54:38,956 --> 01:54:44,235
If these people had denied him
one after the other, to save their skins,

1199
01:54:46,596 --> 01:54:48,951
would he have any followers left?

1200
01:54:51,796 --> 01:54:54,151
I want to think as you do.

1201
01:54:54,236 --> 01:54:57,706
I want to be like those people,
but I can't do it alone.

1202
01:54:58,516 --> 01:55:00,711
I can't do it without you.

1203
01:55:01,516 --> 01:55:04,952
My faith in what you told me
isn't strong enough.

1204
01:55:05,036 --> 01:55:08,346
If you die, I'll believe
that you died for nothing.

1205
01:55:08,956 --> 01:55:11,550
My lady, you'll have to go now.

1206
01:55:15,316 --> 01:55:17,511
Please, Marcellus.

1207
01:55:17,916 --> 01:55:20,305
I need you.

1208
01:56:36,596 --> 01:56:40,589
Senator, the emperor wishes
to speak to you and the lady Diana.

1209
01:56:54,076 --> 01:56:56,351
Greetings to our loyal senator.

1210
01:56:56,436 --> 01:56:59,109
The proceedings here today will interest you.

1211
01:56:59,196 --> 01:57:02,393
- Sire, I am not in the mood for...
- Patience.

1212
01:57:02,476 --> 01:57:05,673
- If my son is to be put on trial...
- Patience!

1213
01:57:06,596 --> 01:57:08,985
You will sit by me.

1214
01:57:14,476 --> 01:57:17,468
Thank you, sire, but
my place is with the senator.

1215
01:57:17,556 --> 01:57:20,832
Your place is where your emperor decides.

1216
01:57:20,916 --> 01:57:23,225
Isn't that so, Senator?

1217
01:57:38,716 --> 01:57:42,595
- You don't look very happy.
- Have I reason to be?

1218
01:57:42,676 --> 01:57:46,271
There isn't a woman in Rome
who wouldn't pray for this honour.

1219
01:57:46,356 --> 01:57:49,553
There's only one man
at whose side I pray to sit.

1220
01:57:51,116 --> 01:57:55,985
Before this day is out, you will
be praying on your knees to me.

1221
01:57:56,076 --> 01:57:58,271
For his life.

1222
01:58:02,596 --> 01:58:05,190
Senators, Romans...

1223
01:58:05,796 --> 01:58:10,790
As you know, there exists today
in our empire, and even in Rome itself,

1224
01:58:11,196 --> 01:58:17,305
a secret party of seditionists
who call themselves Christians.

1225
01:58:19,076 --> 01:58:25,345
They have enlisted in their ranks the riffraff
of the plebeian class, as well as slaves.

1226
01:58:26,316 --> 01:58:29,786
We have known slave uprisings in the past.

1227
01:58:29,876 --> 01:58:32,185
We remember Spartacus.

1228
01:58:32,596 --> 01:58:36,066
But now it grieves us to inform you

1229
01:58:36,876 --> 01:58:40,391
that one of our own tribunes
has betrayed his trust

1230
01:58:40,476 --> 01:58:44,355
and joined this party of conspirators.

1231
01:58:45,796 --> 01:58:50,153
You, not we, shall be
the judges of his treason.

1232
01:58:50,716 --> 01:58:53,184
Bring in Tribune Marcellus Gallio.

1233
01:59:47,036 --> 01:59:51,234
Tribune Gallio, you have been informed
of the charges against you?

1234
01:59:51,316 --> 01:59:52,305
I have, sire.

1235
01:59:52,396 --> 01:59:55,468
You stand before
the senators and nobles of Rome.

1236
01:59:55,556 --> 01:59:57,945
They wait to hear your defence.

1237
02:00:02,276 --> 02:00:04,471
It is true that I am a Christian.

1238
02:00:07,596 --> 02:00:11,589
It is not true that those of us
who follow the teachings of Jesus

1239
02:00:11,676 --> 02:00:14,349
are engaged in any plot against the state.

1240
02:00:14,436 --> 02:00:20,147
But isn't it a fact that
you call this Jesus a king?

1241
02:00:20,716 --> 02:00:22,707
Yes, sire.

1242
02:00:23,236 --> 02:00:25,750
But his kingdom is not of this world.

1243
02:00:26,956 --> 02:00:28,992
He seeks no earthly throne.

1244
02:00:29,516 --> 02:00:33,748
He reigns over the hearts and minds of men
in the name ofjustice and charity.

1245
02:00:33,836 --> 02:00:36,908
And are these virtues
not to be found in our empire?

1246
02:00:37,356 --> 02:00:40,792
Was it justice, or was it charity
that gave me my orders

1247
02:00:40,876 --> 02:00:43,595
when I put him to death on the cross?

1248
02:00:44,356 --> 02:00:46,824
You put him to death?

1249
02:00:46,916 --> 02:00:49,953
Then why are you risking your life for him?

1250
02:00:50,556 --> 02:00:52,911
I owe him more than my life.

1251
02:00:54,196 --> 02:00:57,506
- He forgave me my crime against him.
- Crime?

1252
02:00:57,916 --> 02:01:02,307
Do you maintain that it's a crime
for a Roman soldier to obey his orders?

1253
02:01:02,396 --> 02:01:04,751
The empire is governed by men.

1254
02:01:05,356 --> 02:01:10,589
Men sometimes make mistakes. And this
was the greatest mistake ever made by Rome.

1255
02:01:10,676 --> 02:01:13,110
So, the empire makes mistakes.

1256
02:01:13,916 --> 02:01:17,272
And perhaps the emperor
himself makes mistakes?

1257
02:01:17,676 --> 02:01:19,667
Sire,

1258
02:01:19,756 --> 02:01:23,669
it is I who am on trial here, not you.

1259
02:01:28,196 --> 02:01:30,551
What's that thing you're holding?

1260
02:01:30,636 --> 02:01:33,434
His robe. He wore it to the cross.

1261
02:01:33,516 --> 02:01:35,711
Let me see it.

1262
02:01:37,596 --> 02:01:40,429
No. I remember. It's bewitched.

1263
02:01:40,516 --> 02:01:43,110
- No, sire.
- You. Take it.

1264
02:01:43,476 --> 02:01:45,865
- Destroy it.
- Sire, may I keep it?

1265
02:01:53,236 --> 02:01:55,431
Sorcery too.

1266
02:01:55,516 --> 02:01:58,110
Did you think it would protect you here?

1267
02:01:58,916 --> 02:02:01,032
- No, sire.
- Tell me, Tribune.

1268
02:02:01,116 --> 02:02:05,667
Do you expect us to believe stories that
Jesus could heal by the touch of his hand,

1269
02:02:05,756 --> 02:02:08,714
make the crippled walk
and the blind see again?

1270
02:02:10,036 --> 02:02:13,665
It makes no difference whether
you believe them or not, sire.

1271
02:02:13,756 --> 02:02:18,466
All that matters is that there's no story
that he ever made anyone blind,

1272
02:02:18,556 --> 02:02:20,990
no story that he made anyone a cripple,

1273
02:02:21,076 --> 02:02:23,715
or ever raised his hand except to heal.

1274
02:02:24,316 --> 02:02:26,784
Sire, if you'd had the chance I had,

1275
02:02:27,396 --> 02:02:30,991
to talk with those who knew him,
to learn what was in his heart...

1276
02:02:31,076 --> 02:02:34,386
Stop. Are you trying
to convert me to your treason?

1277
02:02:34,796 --> 02:02:37,230
I only want to show you
your opportunity, sire.

1278
02:02:37,316 --> 02:02:40,991
If the empire desires peace
and brotherhood among all men,

1279
02:02:41,076 --> 02:02:44,352
then my king will be on the side
of Rome and her emperor.

1280
02:02:45,076 --> 02:02:49,513
But if the empire and the emperor pursue
the course of aggression and slavery

1281
02:02:49,596 --> 02:02:52,429
that have brought agony
and despair to the world,

1282
02:02:52,516 --> 02:02:55,189
if there's nothing left but chains and hunger,

1283
02:02:55,276 --> 02:02:57,790
then my king will march
to right those wrongs.

1284
02:02:57,876 --> 02:03:02,506
Not tomorrow, sire. Your Majesty may not
witness the establishment of his kingdom.

1285
02:03:02,596 --> 02:03:05,190
But it will come.

1286
02:03:08,716 --> 02:03:12,709
You have heard him. He stands
convicted out of his own mouth.

1287
02:03:13,636 --> 02:03:15,866
What is your pleasure?

1288
02:03:20,396 --> 02:03:22,273
Death.

1289
02:03:22,476 --> 02:03:24,034
Death.

1290
02:03:32,116 --> 02:03:34,186
You see? It is the will of the people.

1291
02:03:34,276 --> 02:03:38,110
The will of your slaves and parasites.
How dare you speak ofjustice?

1292
02:03:38,196 --> 02:03:41,586
He's not a traitor. You haven't
proved that and you never will.

1293
02:03:41,676 --> 02:03:44,349
Then listen. You will see that I am just.

1294
02:03:44,756 --> 02:03:48,510
Listen. Tribune Gallio,
you stand condemned to death.

1295
02:03:48,596 --> 02:03:50,666
But it is our desire to be merciful.

1296
02:03:50,756 --> 02:03:53,509
We give you a chance
to recant your treason and go free.

1297
02:03:53,596 --> 02:03:56,872
Kneel to us and renew your oath
of loyalty to your emperor.

1298
02:03:56,956 --> 02:04:01,666
Renounce your allegiance to this dead Jew
who dared to call himself a king.

1299
02:04:23,316 --> 02:04:25,307
Sire...

1300
02:04:26,796 --> 02:04:31,586
With all my heart I renew my pledge
of loyalty to my emperor and to Rome,

1301
02:04:33,036 --> 02:04:35,186
a pledge which I have never broken.

1302
02:04:35,276 --> 02:04:37,631
And the other? Jesus?

1303
02:04:37,716 --> 02:04:40,310
Renounce him, so all can hear.

1304
02:04:47,076 --> 02:04:49,874
I cannot renounce him, sire. Nor can you.

1305
02:04:50,476 --> 02:04:52,671
He is my king and yours as well.

1306
02:04:53,476 --> 02:04:55,671
He is the Son of God.

1307
02:04:56,996 --> 02:04:59,874
- And that is your answer?
- Yes, sire.

1308
02:05:03,236 --> 02:05:07,752
Tribune Gallio, we decree that you be taken
immediately to the palace archery field

1309
02:05:07,836 --> 02:05:10,304
and put to death for high treason.

1310
02:05:15,676 --> 02:05:18,395
No, Diana. There's no reason for it.

1311
02:05:18,476 --> 02:05:20,910
Sire, Marcellus is my chosen husband.

1312
02:05:20,996 --> 02:05:23,351
- I ask to go with him.
- Stand back.

1313
02:05:23,436 --> 02:05:26,314
You're not on trial.
There's no evidence against you.

1314
02:05:26,396 --> 02:05:29,832
Then if it please you, sire,
I'll provide evidence.

1315
02:05:29,916 --> 02:05:33,909
I have no wish to live another hour
in an empire ruled by you.

1316
02:05:35,236 --> 02:05:37,386
You dare to call yourself a Caesar.

1317
02:05:38,036 --> 02:05:43,030
Once the Caesars of Rome were noble, but
in you noble blood has turned to poison.

1318
02:05:43,116 --> 02:05:45,107
You corrupt Rome with spite and malice.

1319
02:05:45,196 --> 02:05:47,426
- Stop. Stop it!
- That you should be Caesar!

1320
02:05:47,796 --> 02:05:50,788
Vicious, treacherous, drunk with power.

1321
02:05:51,196 --> 02:05:54,029
An evil, insane monster posing as emperor.

1322
02:05:54,196 --> 02:05:55,424
Stop it!

1323
02:05:55,516 --> 02:05:58,076
As for me, I have found another king.

1324
02:05:59,276 --> 02:06:02,746
I want to go with my husband
into his kingdom.

1325
02:06:04,076 --> 02:06:06,385
Then by the gods you shall.

1326
02:06:06,796 --> 02:06:10,584
Go. Both of you. Into your kingdom!

1327
02:06:49,076 --> 02:06:51,271
They're going into a better kingdom.

1328
02:06:51,476 --> 02:06:54,115
They're going into a better kingdom.

1329
02:06:54,316 --> 02:06:56,386
They're going to meet their king.

1330
02:06:56,596 --> 02:06:58,666
They're going to meet their king.

1331
02:07:03,156 --> 02:07:05,351
For the big fisherman.

1332
