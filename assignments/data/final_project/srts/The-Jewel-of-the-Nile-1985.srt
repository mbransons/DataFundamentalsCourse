1
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,857
<i>It was a day like no other.</i>

2
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:40,239
<i>It was a day I had always dreamed of.</i>

3
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:43,324
<i>A day I would never forget.</i>

4
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:49,497
Will you marry this woman
and take her to your heart,

5
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:52,417
forever devoted and forever young?

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,168
I will.

7
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:58,840
And will you marry this man
and take him to your heart,

8
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:01,426
forever devoted and forever young?

9
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:03,469
I will.

10
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:06,680
Would you now place the ring on her finger?

11
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:11,560
I now declare...

12
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:17,858
<i>What a shame we had uninvited guests.</i>

13
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:23,822
I'll have what I came for this day!

14
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:28,202
<i>Jack politely asked him to leave.</i>

15
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:30,411
Kiss steel, bastard!

16
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:45,384
Jack!

17
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:04,528
Hold tight! I'm coming!

18
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,535
<i>His temper flared,</i>
<i>but he fought like a gentleman.</i>

19
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,395
<i>My one true love had fought bravely,</i>
<i>but it wasn't enough.</i>

20
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:53,366
<i>There was only room for one more.</i>

21
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:56,035
<i>It was either my love or myself.</i>

22
00:02:56,119 --> 00:03:00,498
- You take it, my love.
- Never! Those maggots will not have you.

23
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:03,293
They will not have me for long.

24
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:06,670
I have consumption
and will be dead before the year is out.

25
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,883
You were gonna marry me
with consumption? Why didn't you tell me?

26
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:13,135
I didn't want to spoil things.

27
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:14,511
- Go.
- No!

28
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,889
Live to fight another day.

29
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,853
Whatever makes you happy.

30
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,861
<i>With Jack, my happiness always came first.</i>

31
00:03:33,654 --> 00:03:35,531
<i>I faced my fate alone.</i>

32
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:38,743
<i>The 10 turned to 20, the 20 to 40.</i>

33
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:42,038
<i>Could this be the end of</i>
<i>my freedom, my salvation, my...</i>

34
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,832
Hey, gorgeous!

35
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,919
Hiya, Joanie!

36
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,725
What happened?

37
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:39,008
"Was this the end of my freedom,
my salvation?"

38
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:43,555
My career?

39
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:58,752
Gorgeous day. Huh, gorgeous?

40
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:01,254
We got blue skies,

41
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:04,674
nice warm water and a cold beer.

42
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,679
Honey, did you get any more Buds?

43
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:14,725
No, I just didn't have time today
to ravage the Riviera for your beer.

44
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:19,021
- Tough day, huh?
- Yeah, you could say it was tough.

45
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:22,733
But then when the going gets tough,
the tough...

46
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:27,154
I don't know what the tough do.

47
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:30,324
I don't know what the pirates do,
or what anybody does.

48
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:33,911
- Jack...
- Oh, honey. I know, baby. I know.

49
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,958
Look out there. What do you see?

50
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,919
- Bloomingdale's?
- No.

51
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,462
Greece.

52
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:48,216
Yeah. Mykonos, Lesbos, ouzo, olive oil.
Honey, we're going.

53
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:52,387
Wait. I thought you said that
we were going back to New York for a while.

54
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,431
Absolutely.
When the summer's over we're going.

55
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:59,810
Oh, Jack, we've been on this boat
half a year now. I need shore leave.

56
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:03,480
I promised Gloria I'd finish that book
three months ago, and I can't.

57
00:07:03,564 --> 00:07:05,649
I don't know what happens next.

58
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:08,527
I thought you wanted
to sail around the world with me.

59
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,822
Well, I do, but not all of it this week.

60
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:15,033
I mean, Jack, this is just becoming a blur.

61
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:19,872
Exotic ports and great parties
and spectacular sunsets...

62
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:21,622
It's not enough.

63
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,958
It's not enough?!

64
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:28,379
You sound like someone who's got what they
wanted and now don't want what they got.

65
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:31,966
- I wanna do something serious.
- Serious? Come on!

66
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:34,468
How much romance can one woman take?

67
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,846
Joan Wilder?

68
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,976
From your most devoted friend.

69
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:44,769
Thank you.

70
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:55,322
"This afternoon we shall meet... awaiting
the moment." What's this afternoon?

71
00:07:55,405 --> 00:08:00,243
- Must be somebody coming to the reception.
- That's not till next Tuesday.

72
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:04,331
This is "next Tuesday", Jack.

73
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:25,601
- Jack, you said you were getting a car.
- If I knew it was Tuesday, I would've. Sorry.

74
00:08:25,684 --> 00:08:27,770
That's all right.

75
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:31,190
Whaddaya say we spin that roulette wheel
while we're there?

76
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:33,358
Sounds great.

77
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:44,369
Jack.

78
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:46,329
- Yeah?
- She can't leave now.

79
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:49,207
- Why not?
- What do you mean, "Why not?"

80
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,794
- Oh, my God.
- I'm your biggest fan!

81
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:55,212
- I read all your books.
- Thank you.

82
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,550
I'm so happy to see you.

83
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:02,886
- This is my publisher. Gloria Horne.
- Oh, your publisher.

84
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,390
- And this is...
- You are Mr Wilder?

85
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:09,810
No, I'm Mr Colton. Jack Colton.

86
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:12,229
What do you do, Mr Colton?

87
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:14,398
Casino work.

88
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:19,068
Yeah. I think I'll go downstairs and punch in.
Excuse me, excuse me.

89
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:21,654
- But...
- I'll be back!

90
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,408
God, I've got to have a drink!

91
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,952
Literary functions are not Jack's speed.

92
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:31,956
I mean, his favourite author
is the man who wrote "Pull Tab to Open".

93
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,960
- I am his favourite author.
- You saying it's none of my business?

94
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:39,088
Let me tell you, Jack is not the marrying kind.

95
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:43,216
I am worried. You're the girl who
never gets a book back late to the library.

96
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,471
You are three months past your deadline.
What gives? <i>Un scotch, double.</i>

97
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:53,476
My heart just isn't in it. Romance
just doesn't seem real to me any more.

98
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,106
Real? You don't write "real". You write
about people that sail off into the sunset.

99
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,903
- And the next day when the sun comes up?
- There is no next day in romance.

100
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:06,322
Stop confusing real life
with a romantic novel.

101
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:10,284
- Joanie, just finish it.
- I can't.

102
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:13,412
After 17 books,
I don't know how it ends any more.

103
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:16,540
Then permit me to tell you.

104
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,921
It doesn't end.

105
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:25,841
It only begins anew
when you journey down the Nile with me.

106
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,053
- Have you got the right woman?
- No.

107
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:36,392
My name is Omar Khalifa and I have travelled
1,000 miles to tell you I need you.

108
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:39,312
- You sent me the flowers.
- They pale by your beauty.

109
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:41,064
Oh, Mary!

110
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:45,360
- I read about you.
- Yes, I know. <i>Time</i> magazine.

111
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:50,031
Well, I'm afraid the Western press
cannot understand the spirit of my vision.

112
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:53,033
You are a writer. You can understand.

113
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:57,538
So, Joan Wilder,
you must come and write my story.

114
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,041
I only write romance novels.

115
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:05,128
Yes. And you haven't finished the one
you're working on right now.

116
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:10,300
You are a gifted storyteller.
You create heroes in a world of cynics.

117
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:14,429
Journey down the Nile with me
and I'll give you a chance to record history.

118
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:17,056
- Come. We must leave today.
- Joanie!

119
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,728
In just four nights I will become Emperor,
and you will have the exclusive story.

120
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:25,648
- They have emperors on the Nile?
- They do now.

121
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:28,609
Oh, shit.

122
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,505
So now what are we celebrating?

123
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:53,091
- The Nile!
- Oh, the Nile.

124
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,177
We've been invited to Africa.

125
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,180
Jack Colton, Omar Khalifa.

126
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,224
How do you do?

127
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:07,479
He's asked me - me - to write his story.
It's just what I've always wanted to do!

128
00:12:07,563 --> 00:12:11,901
And now Joan's work will receive
the serious attention that it deserves.

129
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:15,029
And this will be her biggest accomplishment:

130
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:17,198
My biography.

131
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:21,368
What's so important there
that you have to write the book now?

132
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:23,954
- Mr Khalifa has...
- Omar, please.

133
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:28,791
Omar has been chosen
to unite the tribes of the Nile

134
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:31,961
and end the strife that has bloodied his land.

135
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:35,215
He will carry on the work of
the missing Great Redeemer.

136
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:39,177
- You have listened very well.
- You got all that in 20 minutes?

137
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:45,099
As a friend of Miss Wilder's,
you are welcome to be my guest also.

138
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:47,727
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

139
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,523
Could I talk to you for a minute, please?

140
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,322
I thought you wanted to go to New York.

141
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,699
- That's all changed.
- That fast?

142
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:07,079
But to write a biography -
it's something important, something real.

143
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:11,333
- This is what I've been looking for.
- Isn't it a little bit over your head?

144
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,918
I think it's a great chance.

145
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,087
So you got your heart set on it?

146
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,427
Mine's set on Greece.

147
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,017
So when are you gonna leave?

148
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,938
Tonight. He has a private jet and...

149
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,314
Oh, he's got a private jet.

150
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:41,945
- Oh, what the hell. We had a good run.
- Oh, Jack, come on.

151
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,823
This is just five or four weeks of research.

152
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:47,701
Maybe you're right. Maybe we need a break.

153
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:50,203
It's been kind of tough lately.

154
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,832
Yeah. When the going gets tough,
the tough go to Greece.

155
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,088
- Well, I'll write you.
- Where?

156
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,633
Yeah.

157
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:06,594
Where?

158
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:23,359
I think I'll go down and
give that roulette wheel one more chance.

159
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:35,455
You take care of yourself.

160
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:40,043
And you stay out of trouble.

161
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,679
Look out for her, will ya?

162
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:56,975
I can offer you this comfort:
She leaves you for a higher purpose.

163
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,147
Yeah.

164
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:19,497
Free <i>Al-Jawhara!</i>

165
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,446
Don't be frightened. You know,
a man of vision has many enemies.

166
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,491
And my destiny is to outsmart them.
You see?

167
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,536
Like it?

168
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:03,330
It's OK.

169
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:48,874
Well, sweetheart, I guess it's just you and me.

170
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:51,752
Goddamn it, she was the best time I ever had.

171
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,963
Don't cry, scumbag! I'll keep you company.

172
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:01,845
Cartagena, Colombia!
Long time no... Oh, shit.

173
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:05,933
- Go ahead. Gimme a reason. Make my year!
- Hey, go easy with the gun.

174
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:10,686
Did you miss me? I missed you.
You're all I thought about for six months.

175
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:15,733
They threw me in a jail filled with rejects
from the communicable disease ward.

176
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:20,738
Every wacko, drippy,
open-sored lowlife was in that joint!

177
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:23,282
All wanting to be my proctologist.

178
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,786
And rats! I'm full of rat bites.

179
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:32,958
Ten weeks of rabies shots this long and
all I thought of was you, Colton. Just you!

180
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:37,629
Well, I'm flattered, pal.
And I'm sorry you had such a tough time.

181
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:40,966
How about 100 bucks?

182
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,970
I'll give you a one-way ticket to Harp Land!
What'd you do with it?

183
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:48,348
- What are you talking about?
- The stone, moron! I'm cocked!

184
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:53,227
- Let's talk about this like gentlemen.
- Gentlemen! Did I tell you I got malaria?

185
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,773
Every time I shake, I shake like this. Know
what happens if I shake my trigger finger?

186
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:01,902
And I feel an attack coming on!
Know what happens if that happens?

187
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:04,822
It's the end of Mr Lucky. That's the end of...

188
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:07,658
Holy shit!

189
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:11,996
Quiet! Next time you'll not be so lucky.

190
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,041
- I am Tarak. You must come with me now.
- What the hell are you?

191
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,919
- Omar steal our jewel. <i>Al-Jawhara.</i>
- Jewel?

192
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:24,549
You were invited with the woman. You can
get into Omar's palace. My people cannot.

193
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:29,429
- What people? What are you talking about?
- You must help me find the Jewel.

194
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:31,890
- What jewel?
- The Jewel of the Nile.

195
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,475
- Our most priceless jewel.
- Oh, that jewel.

196
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,313
Omar has stolen my people's jewel.
Omar is a very bad man.

197
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:40,481
Oh, that scum! I spit on him!

198
00:18:40,564 --> 00:18:44,193
Jack, buddy, let's help this nice man
get his jewel back.

199
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:47,863
- Yes.
- Look, I don't know where you're from,

200
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:50,032
but I'm sailing my boat tonight.

201
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:54,578
No, you must come to help find the Jewel
now before Omar kill many people.

202
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,665
As long as Omar have the Jewel,
nothing can stop him.

203
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:02,794
Look, I'm going on the boat.
You guys can do what you want.

204
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,218
The boat blew up!

205
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:14,472
My boat blew up.

206
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:16,599
The boat blew up!

207
00:19:16,682 --> 00:19:18,768
Everything's gone.

208
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:24,482
Who are you? The Prince of Darkness?
Don't you got any friends?

209
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:26,733
This is the work of Omar.

210
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:32,030
- Omar blew up my boat, huh?
- Your woman is in danger, too.

211
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:34,115
I will take you to him.

212
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,701
- I'm coming, too.
- The hell you are!

213
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:40,288
Look, you owe me, Colton.

214
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:43,083
So wherever you're going, I'm going.

215
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,670
Where we going?

216
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,296
Africa.

217
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:22,120
- Do you recognise my home?
- I wrote this!

218
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:27,458
Yes! In <i>The Return of the King.</i>
I had the same uniforms designed.

219
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:42,347
Hello. Hi!

220
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:48,812
- Is all this yours?
- It belongs to the country. To my people.

221
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:50,772
Oh.

222
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,946
Why point out the negative?

223
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,073
In three nights in Kadir
the moon will be full,

224
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:06,662
and all my people will unite behind me
in peace and none of this will be necessary.

225
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:11,209
- Now let me show you my humble house.
- Thank you.

226
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm really blessed. My people love me.

227
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:23,553
Well, yes. They seem very... enthusiastic.

228
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:34,773
Oh, this is a good shot for you -
the little boy holding up my picture.

229
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,942
Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.

230
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:00,714
My humble house.

231
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,425
You must forgive us. We are a poor people.

232
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:15,979
Everything you need, they will bring you.

233
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:17,522
Oh, thank you.

234
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:21,609
Here only strangers say thank you.
Family and friends have no need.

235
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,572
What was that?

236
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:27,740
Cats. Come.

237
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:31,744
I have a cat.

238
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,420
I hope this is satisfactory.

239
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:46,258
Oh, yes, this is OK. Fine.

240
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:48,886
Here you'll write your masterpiece.

241
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:51,180
Ah, I have a few questions...

242
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:54,766
I see the writer is already at work. Good.

243
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:58,269
Explore your new world.

244
00:22:58,352 --> 00:23:01,772
Feel free to go anywhere and see anything.

245
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:04,192
Talk to anyone.

246
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:08,529
I'm glad you're here, Joan.
Together we'll make history.

247
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:08,128
It's like a fishbowl!

248
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:12,799
Why do these Third World cesspools
always gotta be so hot, will you tell me that?

249
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:17,137
Hey, where the hell you going?

250
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,686
Holy shit!

251
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:46,373
Well, Colton, looks like
we've hitched our wagon to a star.

252
00:25:15,318 --> 00:25:17,403
Stop that! Stop it!

253
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:28,163
Excuse me?

254
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:31,708
What does this mean?

255
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:39,049
- Do you speak English?
- "Give back the Jewel."

256
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:43,135
- Give back the jewel?
- Yeah. <i>Eid lana Al-Jawhara.</i>

257
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:50,518
You can't do that! I'm a professional.

258
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,445
We'll see about that.

259
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,741
<i>If you don't tell me</i>
<i>what the hell is going on here,</i>

260
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:11,037
- I'll be on the first plane back to New York.
- It's impossible.

261
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:16,709
Tomorrow we journey to Kadir. You must be
there. It will be your most important chapter.

262
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:20,839
- I can't write if you keep secrets from me.
- What secrets?

263
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:25,760
What is the Jewel?

264
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,389
The Jewel is a legend.

265
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,558
I am real.

266
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:36,562
Do not be distracted
from your mission, Joan Wilder.

267
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:39,356
Make yourself comfortable.

268
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,860
You stay with me until our book is done.

269
00:26:42,943 --> 00:26:45,028
You can't keep me here!

270
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:49,867
Go. You are free to leave.

271
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:57,206
Only the worst kind of fool
would attempt our desert alone.

272
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,804
I gotta get off this camel.
It's breaking my ass! Colton!

273
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:14,473
- You gotta hang on and take it.
- I can't.

274
00:27:14,556 --> 00:27:18,018
- The camp's coming up.
- Shit!

275
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:35,410
You are welcome!

276
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:39,663
We have food! We have drink!

277
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:41,832
You got a toilet?

278
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:49,006
So how big is this jewel?

279
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,807
Very, very big. Very big. Very, very big.

280
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,058
Very big.

281
00:28:00,226 --> 00:28:02,936
It's as big as this orange?

282
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:14,572
- It's as big as an orange.
- The Jewel is the heart of our people.

283
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:17,158
Omar steals the heart of our people.

284
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:19,536
- Omar is thief.
- Omar is very bad man.

285
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:22,872
Before Omar steal Jewel, everything good.

286
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:24,873
Now everything is shit!

287
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:38,262
You help us find the Jewel,
and we give you great reward.

288
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:41,682
But if you lie to us, you die.

289
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:45,394
But now we dance!

290
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,471
Look at these guys, Colton.

291
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,639
No sheep is safe tonight.

292
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,904
We split it right down the middle,
Colton. 50-50.

293
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,072
What are you talking about?

294
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,700
Don't play stupid with me, partner.

295
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,660
The Jewel.

296
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,538
And don't you even think of
messing with me.

297
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:59,130
Oh, what's that I hear?
A heart breaking? You sap!

298
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,090
Keep your mind on business.

299
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:05,762
You'll wind up getting yourself killed
over some broad who dumped you.

300
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,307
Jewels!

301
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,726
Oh, Omar!

302
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,965
I want you lot to be careful!

303
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:48,845
See that word "Fragile" on the side?
It means don't drop... Why don't you listen?

304
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:53,683
I might love your country, your culture,
and even your people! That means I love you!

305
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:57,562
But you drop one more of my boxes,
and I'll smash your bloody face in!

306
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:05,027
You tell Omar, right - Omar -
that his special-effects wizard has arrived!

307
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:07,196
Come on, then.

308
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:36,323
War plans? Oh, my God! What is he up to?

309
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,622
Wait till <i>Time</i> magazine sees this.

310
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:11,606
You bastard! You burnt my hand!

311
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,653
I didn't say it wouldn't burn.
I said it wouldn't hurt! There's no blistering.

312
00:33:16,736 --> 00:33:21,241
- I've done it hundreds of times on stage.
- This is not a cheap theatrical stunt!

313
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:26,621
- It's a miracle! My people have to believe it!
- Omar, trust me. Trust what I've got to say.

314
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:31,667
Look, if I can make gods out of rock'n'roll
stars, imagine what I can do for you.

315
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,713
For your information,
I am not a rock'n'roll star!

316
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:39,091
The people must believe
I have the same powers as the Jewel.

317
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:41,510
Come! I want to see him now.

318
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:45,806
If it weren't for the Jewel,
I'd have led my people to power long ago.

319
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:00,236
Westerners understand nothing. The Jewel
represents the spiritual world of my people.

320
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,908
Unless I convince them I am their spiritual
leader, they will never follow me into battle.

321
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:07,076
That is why you are here.

322
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:36,146
- Tell me how it's done, magician.
- It's not magic trick. It's miracle.

323
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:39,816
I am losing patience with you.

324
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:43,861
But you cannot kill me.
Even you are superstitious.

325
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:46,614
<i>Al-Jawhara</i> lives.

326
00:34:46,697 --> 00:34:49,784
Two nights from now it will not matter.

327
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:07,384
Oh, no.

328
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:13,723
A woman?

329
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:17,018
- Most unexpected.
- I gotta get outta here.

330
00:35:17,102 --> 00:35:19,187
I gotta stop Omar.

331
00:35:19,438 --> 00:35:22,232
Did you bring an army?

332
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:26,527
- No. I'm just Joan Wilder.
- Just-Joan Wilder, I'm <i>Al-Jawhara.</i>

333
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:31,782
The Jewel of the Nile.

334
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:34,452
I don't understand.

335
00:35:34,535 --> 00:35:37,913
- You are the Jewel?!
- Yes. For the moment.

336
00:35:37,997 --> 00:35:42,918
In two nights at the holy city of Kadir
Omar will proclaim himself Emperor.

337
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:47,047
Without me to oppose him, he'll march
across North Africa like a madman.

338
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:51,509
But the world will see me
as the saviour of my people.

339
00:35:51,593 --> 00:35:56,473
No, it won't. The world won't believe you.
I've been in your office and seen your vision.

340
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:58,933
- I'll write the truth about you.
- The truth?

341
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:02,312
If I wanted the truth,
I would have hired <i>60 Minutes.</i>

342
00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:05,440
What do you know about truth?
You fantasise everything.

343
00:36:05,523 --> 00:36:10,945
Why do you think I brought you here? You
stay here and write what <i>I</i> tell you to write!

344
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:16,742
- You think no one knows I'm here?
- Oh, yes, Jack! I forgot to tell you.

345
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:19,536
Jack is dead.

346
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:24,333
Don't be ridiculous.
Jack would never die without telling me.

347
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,752
Nevertheless, he is dead.

348
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:38,346
You look pale, Miss Wilder.
I'll send you my personal physician.

349
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:47,146
It can't be true.

350
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,280
This Jack... He is friend for you?

351
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,533
Yes.

352
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:01,701
He is my best friend.

353
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:17,134
What? I don't see shit!

354
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:20,303
We must stop here.

355
00:37:20,387 --> 00:37:23,431
It is dangerous for Sufis to enter Omar's city.

356
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:26,725
Now, wait. He's already tried to kill me once.

357
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:31,188
You are guest of Omar.

358
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:34,900
Find for us the Jewel. Accept your destiny.

359
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,238
Destiny, my ass! Excuse me.

360
00:37:40,406 --> 00:37:43,159
When you hook up with jujubes,
see what happens.

361
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:46,203
Just take your lead from me, and we'll be fine.

362
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:52,125
- We gonna walk through the centre of town?
- I'm gonna put you up a camel's ass.

363
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:53,877
I might like it.

364
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:02,093
- What are you doing?
- In one of my books,

365
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:04,262
<i>Angelina's Savage Secret,</i>

366
00:38:04,345 --> 00:38:09,017
she used her nailfile to cut
the mortar away from the window box.

367
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,685
How long did this take?

368
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,729
Two pages.

369
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:18,442
But... it's not the bars
that make the prison. It is the desert.

370
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:22,362
So I'll travel at night. I don't care.
I have to stop Omar.

371
00:38:22,446 --> 00:38:25,199
I gotta get out to write the truth about him.

372
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:27,367
I have to get to Kadir.

373
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,371
Wait a minute.
You are the one that has to get to Kadir.

374
00:38:31,455 --> 00:38:34,791
You are the only one that can stop Omar.
You have to go with me!

375
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:39,837
Maybe you are the one.

376
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:43,382
I accept.

377
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:45,843
We are sworn, Just-Joan.

378
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:51,182
- Right. But it's just Joan.
- Right. Just-Joan.

379
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:54,936
- Right. We just have to get out this window.
- Please.

380
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,110
- Magic!
- Dry rot.

381
00:39:05,153 --> 00:39:11,201
I bet you could pick up a swell three-bedroom
town house here for about five or six dollars.

382
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:15,914
Hi. My name is Colton.

383
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:19,709
I've been invited by your Omar.
I'm here to see Joan Wilder.

384
00:39:22,545 --> 00:39:25,047
Hey, Rachid! How are you?
Good to see you again.

385
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:27,341
Joan Wilder does not want to see you.

386
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:34,849
Well, now, Rachid,
I don't think you understand.

387
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:40,938
We're here on official business.
This is Mr... Fatush from the US Embassy.

388
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:45,150
He's got something very important
to talk to all you guys about.

389
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:52,866
Look, we don't want to
create an international incident here.

390
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:56,077
I mean, after all, she is an American citizen.

391
00:39:56,161 --> 00:40:00,331
If you'll just let us see her, no paperwork.
Mum's the word. Everything...

392
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:06,379
Guys, no sweat, OK?
We'll catch you next time we're in town.

393
00:40:06,463 --> 00:40:08,797
- Take it easy.
- Say hello to her for us.

394
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:12,634
You know what they say: Once
they've had a holy man, they never go back.

395
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:17,431
- Quickly, Just-Joan!
- Are you sure you know where you're going?

396
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,731
Those guys can go for hours
without coming up for air.

397
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:29,902
Ease up, will ya?
All right, there's gotta be another way in here.

398
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:35,823
I can't wait for another smooth move. How
about us at the back door in pussycat suits?

399
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:39,786
- When they come with the milk...
- How about you takin' it in the ear!?

400
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:43,081
Look, if it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't be on to this.

401
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:46,209
Subsequently I should shoot you
the first chance I get!

402
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,835
Jack!

403
00:40:48,252 --> 00:40:50,338
You're alive!

404
00:40:50,421 --> 00:40:52,590
Kinda goin' outta your way to duck me!

405
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:55,050
You bastard!

406
00:41:03,642 --> 00:41:06,520
Oh, Jack! I thought I'd never see you again.

407
00:41:06,603 --> 00:41:10,565
They told me you were dead.
I never wanna feel that way again.

408
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:13,819
Does this mean you apologise?

409
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:18,072
I feel like I'm back in eighth grade.
Is this <i>The Young and the Stupid?</i>

410
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:22,535
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Don't get cagey with me. I'm on to it.

411
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:24,703
I know how you two operate.

412
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:30,251
I'll get in there with or without you dinks!

413
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:44,139
Hey, look, guys! Lighten up!
I'm only saying hello to an old girlfriend here!

414
00:41:44,222 --> 00:41:47,976
- Just-Joan, we need to go!
- Wait a minute, who's this guy?

415
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:51,396
- He's a friend.
- You made friends in there?

416
00:42:07,703 --> 00:42:10,664
- OK. Let's go, come on!
- Wait. He's coming with us.

417
00:42:11,832 --> 00:42:15,627
Don't start with me! I've come
halfway across Africa to rescue you.

418
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:18,505
Rescue me? I was doing fine without you.

419
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:23,635
- I am guide. I can help.
- I don't need a guide. I need a miracle!

420
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,804
Jack, he's coming with us.

421
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,895
All right. But if we get out of this alive,
I'm gonna kill you.

422
00:42:33,978 --> 00:42:35,438
Let's go.

423
00:43:10,222 --> 00:43:12,808
- Who are you?
- Is this where Al Jolson's buried?

424
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,643
- Who the hell are you?
- Don't provoke me, pal!

425
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:20,314
I had a tough day. You know
how hot it is here? It's 120<i>ş</i> in the shade.

426
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:25,820
I'm like this with Weinberger.
We'll be all over you!

427
00:43:33,786 --> 00:43:35,663
Let me in!

428
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:39,874
Holy shit and shove me in it.

429
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:14,324
Oh, no. Over the wall!

430
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,567
Excuse me. Excuse me.

431
00:44:54,446 --> 00:44:56,323
Come on!

432
00:44:56,406 --> 00:44:58,075
No! No!

433
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:05,791
OK, flyboy,
your estimated time of departure is now!

434
00:45:24,517 --> 00:45:27,478
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything!

435
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:32,108
- Well, do something!
- All right. I'm trying!

436
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:37,654
I mean, this isn't Space Invaders!

437
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:46,663
- Jack, the wall!
- Oh, no!

438
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:31,247
- It is Space Invaders!
- That'll show 'em!

439
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,925
All right, yeah!

440
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:46,386
Oh, shit!

441
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,640
Let's get outta here!

442
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,407
This is gonna be tight!

443
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:15,581
This is my first time in airplane.

444
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,596
How do you stop this thing?

445
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:38,812
Sorry!

446
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,906
- Do you know where you're going?
- Give me a break!

447
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:37,618
- Your friend steal the Jewel.
- What?

448
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:45,375
- You! You are liar to me!
- No!

449
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:48,128
I come back and you're dead!

450
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:56,303
You thieving bastard!
You ain't stiffin' me again!

451
00:48:56,386 --> 00:48:59,765
I promise ya.
I'll feed ya to the maggots! I'll get...

452
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,240
Great! We're out of quarters.

453
00:50:01,323 --> 00:50:03,450
Well, try that one there.

454
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,125
Now what?

455
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,669
Damn it!

456
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:25,179
Yes!

457
00:50:26,013 --> 00:50:28,683
Hey, that's not bad for your first time.

458
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:05,176
Come on, we'll get him. We'll get him.

459
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:07,803
Colton, you ain't gettin' away.

460
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,825
Where the hell's the horn?

461
00:51:32,077 --> 00:51:34,829
Get outta here! Get out of the way!

462
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:54,473
Sandstorm.

463
00:52:04,441 --> 00:52:07,027
Stop!

464
00:52:07,403 --> 00:52:09,780
What are you gonna do?

465
00:52:11,323 --> 00:52:13,908
Either save us or kill us. Hang on!

466
00:53:15,134 --> 00:53:18,095
- Now you are dead.
- No! Don't cut off my head!

467
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:22,223
- You stole our jewel.
- It was the mook! He's always screwin' me.

468
00:53:22,307 --> 00:53:25,268
I swear to God on my eyes
I never seen that jewel!

469
00:53:26,895 --> 00:53:29,522
No, wait, wait!

470
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:32,150
You need me. I can help you find him.

471
00:53:32,233 --> 00:53:37,155
- You are his friend.
- No! No friend. Stop saying that.

472
00:53:37,238 --> 00:53:39,574
Friends don't stab each other in the back.

473
00:53:39,657 --> 00:53:44,287
Come on. Look, we'll team up.
We'll find him, we'll get him good.

474
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:48,665
He knows that I will not be denied!
Colton's future is bleak!

475
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,418
<i>Very bleak!</i>

476
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,256
Any idea where we are?

477
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,303
The best I can figure out is that we head
due east. We should make it to the border.

478
00:54:01,387 --> 00:54:06,975
- Well... is that the way to Kadir?
- <i>La.</i> Kadir is in the west, over that mountain.

479
00:54:07,101 --> 00:54:10,645
Well, the best of luck to you, pal.
Joan, let's get going.

480
00:54:10,728 --> 00:54:12,897
Jack, we have to take him to Kadir.

481
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,652
What are you talkin' about?
We got him out, like you said. Come on.

482
00:54:17,735 --> 00:54:20,863
We swore an oath, Just-Joan and I.
We go to Kadir.

483
00:54:22,365 --> 00:54:24,867
What is it with you?!

484
00:54:24,951 --> 00:54:29,664
Jesus! Everything's always gotta be
your way? It's just like the goddamn boat!

485
00:54:29,747 --> 00:54:34,167
What do you mean "my way"? It wasn't
my idea to spend six months on your boat!

486
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:38,714
- Oh, debate good. I enjoy.
- OK, let me tell you what I put up with.

487
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:43,343
We're moored off the Canary Islands.
Midnight, sound asleep.

488
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:46,054
Three crazed Joan Wilder fans

489
00:54:46,138 --> 00:54:49,599
decide they want the anchor
of the <i>Angelina</i> for a souvenir!

490
00:54:49,683 --> 00:54:55,105
- We were drifting for days! And the other...
- Stop. I'm sorry. It's time for Just-Joan.

491
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:58,357
- Remember the Costa del Sol, Jack?
- Oh, come on!

492
00:54:58,441 --> 00:55:01,277
He's gotta meet me
at the governor's for dinner.

493
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,323
And you show up with the entire
national basketball team!

494
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:08,284
They were hungry.

495
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:11,996
This is what I'm talking about.
Sometimes you could think about me.

496
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,333
Oh, I suppose you were thinking all about me
when you took off with Omar?

497
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:18,502
- He blew up my boat!
- Our boat?

498
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:22,464
- Oh, now it's our boat?
- Good debate. It's equal, no winners.

499
00:55:22,547 --> 00:55:25,842
- Just-Joan, we must hurry.
- Wait. He blew up our boat?

500
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:29,179
Why are you risking your life for this guy?

501
00:55:30,513 --> 00:55:34,350
I made a commitment. I can't break it.

502
00:55:38,229 --> 00:55:40,899
OK. Fine.

503
00:55:40,982 --> 00:55:44,777
But I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I didn't come here for you anyway. No!

504
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,946
I'm on to something big.

505
00:55:48,572 --> 00:55:53,577
- A jewel. The Jewel of the Nile.
- Come with us. I am <i>Jawhara!</i>

506
00:55:54,578 --> 00:55:57,873
- That means Joe.
- Thanks, Joe, but no thanks.

507
00:55:58,332 --> 00:56:01,335
I wouldn't want her
to break her commitment.

508
00:56:02,044 --> 00:56:04,129
Oh, Jack...

509
00:56:04,546 --> 00:56:06,631
Come on.

510
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:47,003
That's for the <i>Angelina.</i>

511
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,215
I still owe you for Joan.

512
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:58,472
Oh, no. Oh, God.
Please, let me get out of this alive.

513
00:56:58,597 --> 00:57:02,601
I swear to God
I'll be a good boy from tomorrow on.

514
00:57:08,107 --> 00:57:10,192
But tonight I gotta kill Colton.

515
00:57:23,997 --> 00:57:26,416
<i>Heydi Joan Wilder!</i>

516
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:44,266
- Why you didn't tell your friend about me?
- Oh, I know him.

517
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:49,313
He'd go halfway round the world for a party.
He wouldn't cross town for a noble cause.

518
00:57:49,396 --> 00:57:53,358
- People can surprise you.
- No, he's just Jack. He'll never change.

519
00:57:53,442 --> 00:57:55,527
Like a...

520
00:57:56,111 --> 00:57:58,238
Like a stone.

521
00:57:58,322 --> 00:58:02,076
It's always a stone. Open your hand.

522
00:58:03,326 --> 00:58:06,579
Change is not always visible.

523
00:58:06,746 --> 00:58:09,916
- Let's show some hustle!
- What?

524
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:13,961
Your buddy Omar!
What is it? He can't live without you?

525
00:58:17,799 --> 00:58:20,635
- Are we jogging?
- We are jogging.

526
00:58:33,397 --> 00:58:35,899
Greece is looking better and better.

527
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:47,035
Oh, shit!

528
00:58:48,495 --> 00:58:51,414
Just tell me why this guy wants you so bad.

529
00:58:52,331 --> 00:58:54,792
- Hey, Joe, where you going?
- This way.

530
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:58,212
- You gotta be kidding.
- He knows the mountains better than you.

531
00:58:58,295 --> 00:59:00,381
Joan, will you give me a break?

532
00:59:00,464 --> 00:59:02,883
America - democracy. We vote, huh?

533
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:59,480
Stop!

534
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:13,576
Hurry up. Let's go!

535
01:00:14,494 --> 01:00:15,745
Get down!

536
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:22,085
It's a black day for democracy.

537
01:00:23,502 --> 01:00:27,547
- Do not worry. It's not my destiny to die here.
- What about us?

538
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,343
That's another ball game.

539
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,521
Rachid!

540
01:00:46,525 --> 01:00:48,734
Joan Wilder!

541
01:00:48,818 --> 01:00:51,195
I wish no harm to you!

542
01:00:51,612 --> 01:00:54,198
I'm your friend! Your fan!

543
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,951
Please surrender!

544
01:00:57,034 --> 01:01:01,205
What did you do for this guy Omar
you never did for me?

545
01:01:01,288 --> 01:01:03,374
Bloody bitch!

546
01:01:13,091 --> 01:01:15,176
Oh, shit! Look out!

547
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:49,543
Hey, Omar! Eat rocks!

548
01:01:51,462 --> 01:01:52,963
Let's go.

549
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,825
I got something.

550
01:02:27,913 --> 01:02:30,082
Nubians.

551
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:32,501
I was hoping to avoid them.

552
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:41,635
Sell any books here?

553
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,641
- Main man! Hey, my man!
- What are you so happy about?

554
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:52,978
Just keep smiling. Maybe they'll think
we're from <i>National Geographic.</i>

555
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,237
Hey! How ya doin'?

556
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:35,602
He says it's many days'
long trip over high mountains.

557
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,313
And he wishes us a very pleasant journey.

558
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,735
Thank you.

559
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:46,947
All right. Thank you, guys.
Catch you next time. Goodbye.

560
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,116
Come on, Jack.

561
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:58,041
Ah, Mr Jack! Just-Joan! The Chief's son, he
wishes to make a blessing for your marriage.

562
01:04:00,168 --> 01:04:02,628
We're not married.

563
01:04:23,273 --> 01:04:28,570
He says, because you are not married,
that his son wishes to court you.

564
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:31,490
- Oh, I just...
- Oh, no, that's...

565
01:04:32,532 --> 01:04:36,828
That's very nice, but the lady is...
She's with me.

566
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:48,339
He says that because there is more than
one suitor, that you must wrestle his son.

567
01:04:48,673 --> 01:04:50,758
I gotta wrestle his son?

568
01:04:55,846 --> 01:04:57,932
How ya doin'?

569
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,646
OK. This one I think I can handle.

570
01:05:04,312 --> 01:05:06,189
OK!

571
01:05:11,027 --> 01:05:12,278
No?

572
01:05:12,862 --> 01:05:14,948
<i>Hussein!</i>

573
01:05:34,883 --> 01:05:38,637
Wait a minute, guys.
Let's talk this over like gentlemen!

574
01:05:41,223 --> 01:05:43,684
All right. You guys are with me, huh?

575
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:45,728
Yeah, me. All right.

576
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:49,815
Do me a favour. Tell him
we lived together for six months. Shit.

577
01:05:49,898 --> 01:05:52,233
All right, what are the rules?

578
01:06:16,715 --> 01:06:18,884
Right.

579
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:32,481
I'm sorry about that.

580
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:37,486
No, not the left one! No!

581
01:06:41,572 --> 01:06:44,450
No pain, no gain.

582
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,619
Let me go!

583
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:55,252
- No!
- Can we talk about this?

584
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,297
Stop it!

585
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:00,883
We have to do something!

586
01:07:01,591 --> 01:07:03,677
I am doing something.

587
01:07:24,822 --> 01:07:26,907
Joe, he's...

588
01:08:30,552 --> 01:08:34,805
- That was great!
- Great, huh? I could've gotten killed!

589
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,906
This is the marriage dance. In this tribe,
the women, they choose the man.

590
01:09:36,281 --> 01:09:40,703
And then, according to the custom,
they will be together for life.

591
01:09:40,786 --> 01:09:43,163
They get all that from one dance?

592
01:09:43,247 --> 01:09:44,915
It's beautiful!

593
01:09:50,378 --> 01:09:55,174
Ralph, if you want to be one of us,
take off your shoes and socks.

594
01:09:56,009 --> 01:09:59,762
If you want to be one of us,
you must see with the eyes of your heart,

595
01:09:59,846 --> 01:10:02,640
- not with the eyes of your head.
- Gotcha, yeah.

596
01:10:02,724 --> 01:10:05,977
Your heart will never give you fear or pain -

597
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,146
if you know our way.

598
01:10:10,313 --> 01:10:11,982
Ralph.

599
01:10:12,065 --> 01:10:15,402
No, thanks, pal. Keep your friggin' jewel.

600
01:10:15,485 --> 01:10:17,571
- No!
- Are you afraid?

601
01:10:18,488 --> 01:10:20,365
I just had my feet resoled.

602
01:10:20,657 --> 01:10:24,828
- What is the worst that can happen to you?
- I could wind up a Chicken McNugget.

603
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:30,792
- What is the best that could happen to you?
- I could get through this and find the Jewel.

604
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:32,960
It's your choice.

605
01:10:33,044 --> 01:10:35,129
Look down.

606
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:40,718
Hot coals!

607
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:46,557
I did it! I did it! I'm one of us!

608
01:11:14,084 --> 01:11:16,169
All right! Yeah!

609
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:44,320
Your fears - they make you foolish.

610
01:11:51,369 --> 01:11:53,454
Go to her, Jack.

611
01:13:15,616 --> 01:13:19,578
- I'm sorry I got people shooting at you again.
- You kidding?

612
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:22,998
We're the perfect couple
when we got people shooting at us.

613
01:13:23,082 --> 01:13:27,795
- Just the slow times I'm not too good at.
- I guess I just expect too much.

614
01:13:27,878 --> 01:13:29,963
Maybe we both expect too much.

615
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,260
Oh, boy.

616
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:39,389
Thank you for coming to Kadir with me.

617
01:14:07,457 --> 01:14:09,960
This valley is gift of the Nile.

618
01:14:18,593 --> 01:14:20,762
I've been away from here too long.

619
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:28,769
You know, I'm getting to like this guy Joe.
He's growing on me.

620
01:14:28,853 --> 01:14:32,189
What do you say we cut him in
on this jewel, if we ever find it?

621
01:14:32,273 --> 01:14:34,358
Jack...

622
01:14:35,151 --> 01:14:37,236
We have the Jewel.

623
01:14:38,237 --> 01:14:40,406
What are you talking about? Where?

624
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:43,284
Well, there.

625
01:14:46,954 --> 01:14:49,040
- What, Joe's got the Jewel?
- No.

626
01:14:50,498 --> 01:14:52,584
Joe is the Jewel.

627
01:14:56,254 --> 01:14:58,465
Joe is the Jewel of the Nile?

628
01:14:58,548 --> 01:15:02,719
He's a holy man. That's his religious title.

629
01:15:04,846 --> 01:15:07,140
Joe is the Jewel.

630
01:15:15,022 --> 01:15:18,817
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
Why'd you keep it from me?

631
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:22,029
Because I thought if you knew,
you wouldn't come with us.

632
01:15:22,112 --> 01:15:24,198
Maybe I would've surprised you.

633
01:15:25,074 --> 01:15:29,078
I think I've come through once or twice,
if I remember right.

634
01:15:29,161 --> 01:15:31,872
I'm sorry.

635
01:15:31,955 --> 01:15:34,875
You're right. You come through all the time.

636
01:15:42,465 --> 01:15:44,550
It's funny.

637
01:15:45,593 --> 01:15:48,096
I really thought we had a chance.

638
01:16:03,151 --> 01:16:05,153
Look! The train to Kadir!

639
01:16:05,237 --> 01:16:08,448
Come on, Jack.
<i>Inshallah,</i> we'll be there tonight.

640
01:16:08,532 --> 01:16:12,703
- What a lot of people!
- They are going to see the false redeemer.

641
01:16:12,786 --> 01:16:16,123
- Omar again, huh?
- We'll see about that.

642
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:54,159
Shit!

643
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:06,144
What are you doing?

644
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:08,897
Come on!

645
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:10,816
Jump!

646
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:15,904
No!

647
01:18:46,766 --> 01:18:48,852
No! Hang on, Joan!

648
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:09,330
Jack, watch out!

649
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:11,415
It's...

650
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:43,655
Guys, wait up! Come on, Humphrey.
Go, go, go!

651
01:19:53,081 --> 01:19:55,290
Do something!

652
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:57,459
What do you want me to do?

653
01:21:30,214 --> 01:21:31,924
Colton!

654
01:21:33,509 --> 01:21:36,888
Your ass is grass,
and I'm a lawn mower, Colton!

655
01:21:36,971 --> 01:21:39,807
Colton, I'll get you! Colton, I'm on to ya!

656
01:22:13,256 --> 01:22:14,924
Colton.

657
01:23:10,394 --> 01:23:12,479
All right, yeah!

658
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,193
All right! Let's go, come on.
Let's get out of here!

659
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:27,118
Just-Joan, you're gre...

660
01:23:28,953 --> 01:23:30,830
Welcome.

661
01:23:30,913 --> 01:23:36,044
I don't usually travel by train,
but I had a small accident with my helicopter.

662
01:23:49,348 --> 01:23:51,642
May we reach Kadir in time.

663
01:24:14,497 --> 01:24:18,542
Once we get inside,
we must find the entrance to the catacombs.

664
01:24:19,418 --> 01:24:21,504
T-shirts! Buy T-shirts!

665
01:24:21,587 --> 01:24:26,050
Gimme the T-shirt.
I'll buy it, I'll buy it. Get outta here, will ya?

666
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:50,198
You know, I really admire
your loyalty to each other.

667
01:24:50,907 --> 01:24:54,828
And I'm going to give you a chance
to be together to the very end.

668
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:56,788
Well, not exactly.

669
01:24:56,871 --> 01:24:59,999
One will watch the other die.

670
01:25:05,129 --> 01:25:07,214
But which one?

671
01:25:08,882 --> 01:25:10,968
Rachid.

672
01:25:12,678 --> 01:25:15,931
- Is that the goat's blood?
- Yes.

673
01:25:16,015 --> 01:25:20,102
Very popular
with the inhabitants of these catacombs.

674
01:25:20,561 --> 01:25:24,814
- Rats.
- Yes. They eat until they get the last drop.

675
01:25:25,189 --> 01:25:28,234
But don't worry, Mr Colton.
You won't be alone.

676
01:25:29,027 --> 01:25:34,157
Rachid is now placing acid
that will eat through Miss Wilder's rope.

677
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:37,160
What kind of sick pervert
would go to this trouble?

678
01:25:37,619 --> 01:25:39,621
- Why don't you shoot us?!
- Jack!

679
01:25:39,704 --> 01:25:43,625
What kind of demented psychopath
would even think of this?

680
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:46,335
- <i>The Savage Secret.</i>
- What?

681
01:25:47,502 --> 01:25:49,379
Was my biggest seller.

682
01:25:53,634 --> 01:25:58,263
Think about this pit
as your last adventure, Joan Wilder.

683
01:25:59,723 --> 01:26:02,017
My people await me.

684
01:26:22,203 --> 01:26:25,748
What you talkin' about?
I work with professional people.

685
01:26:25,831 --> 01:26:29,835
You tell His Highness
the show starts with him or without him.

686
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:41,721
Goddamn beanie convention.
Wind up goin' home with a rug.

687
01:26:41,805 --> 01:26:43,890
The entrance!

688
01:26:55,025 --> 01:26:57,319
Give me a red to the yellow. And cue!

689
01:26:59,196 --> 01:27:01,740
I said give me a red gel down there!

690
01:27:07,621 --> 01:27:10,666
And cue! For Gawd's sake, cue!

691
01:27:35,273 --> 01:27:38,276
Build it, build it softly.
And give me some smoke.

692
01:28:08,638 --> 01:28:13,059
That's good, that's good, that's very good.
Now, bring it up slowly.

693
01:29:30,258 --> 01:29:32,719
There are many rooms and many ways.

694
01:29:32,802 --> 01:29:35,013
You! You go this way.

695
01:29:35,096 --> 01:29:37,390
And, you! You go this way.

696
01:29:37,473 --> 01:29:39,933
And we: We go this way.

697
01:30:00,996 --> 01:30:03,080
Boy, it stinks in this place.

698
01:30:07,418 --> 01:30:10,046
What looks good, amigo?

699
01:30:10,129 --> 01:30:14,008
You go from this way. And... I go this way.

700
01:30:14,091 --> 01:30:16,177
All right.

701
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:19,055
What a fruit loop.

702
01:30:20,598 --> 01:30:22,683
- How'd they get out?
- What?

703
01:30:22,767 --> 01:30:25,727
In <i>The Savage Secret,</i> how'd they get out?

704
01:30:27,562 --> 01:30:30,440
Jesse had a knife hidden in his boot.

705
01:30:31,733 --> 01:30:34,736
You wouldn't happen to have a knife,
would ya?

706
01:30:34,819 --> 01:30:37,864
- I'm not even wearing underwear.
- Great!

707
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:41,076
No!

708
01:31:00,302 --> 01:31:03,013
We were good together,
weren't we, Joan Wilder?

709
01:31:03,097 --> 01:31:05,266
The best.

710
01:31:05,349 --> 01:31:08,269
- And we're gonna make it.
- Yeah.

711
01:31:11,605 --> 01:31:14,023
Oh, God. I love you, lady.

712
01:31:14,107 --> 01:31:16,025
I love you, Jack.

713
01:31:16,359 --> 01:31:18,444
Will you marry me?

714
01:31:19,737 --> 01:31:23,032
- Yes!
- Because I never want you leaving me again.

715
01:31:23,741 --> 01:31:27,745
You're not just saying that
because this is it, are you?

716
01:31:29,455 --> 01:31:33,501
I'm saying it
because I'm not afraid to say it any more.

717
01:31:47,764 --> 01:31:51,059
So where do you wanna go
on our honeymoon?

718
01:32:12,538 --> 01:32:16,709
Rats! Get out of here, you...
Goddamn rat farm! Go on!

719
01:32:17,084 --> 01:32:22,797
- Ralph! Get us out of here, will ya?
- Ah! And there's the biggest rat of all.

720
01:32:23,715 --> 01:32:25,800
Colton, look at you. You...

721
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:29,387
You don't know how many nights
I dreamed of this.

722
01:32:29,471 --> 01:32:34,893
- Except your flesh was torn off your body.
- Ralph, please, just help us down.

723
01:32:34,976 --> 01:32:37,062
Jack! Hold on!

724
01:32:38,355 --> 01:32:41,107
Well, well, well, Colton.

725
01:32:41,191 --> 01:32:45,653
I think this calls for a renegotiation.
Don't you, Tarzan? Huh?

726
01:32:45,736 --> 01:32:48,989
This looks a little bit more like 70-30.

727
01:32:49,073 --> 01:32:53,577
- Or maybe even 80-20.
- Ralph, will ya get the rats off that rope?!

728
01:32:54,203 --> 01:32:58,499
- I don't go near rats, buddy.
- Ralph, do not be afraid.

729
01:32:59,959 --> 01:33:02,670
Remember the Sufi way: See with your heart.

730
01:33:03,295 --> 01:33:07,091
My heart sees rats, Pop.
Don't let this garb fool you.

731
01:33:07,174 --> 01:33:09,425
Come on, Colton. Where's the Jewel?

732
01:33:09,509 --> 01:33:13,846
Ralph, I am the Jewel. The Jewel of the Nile.

733
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:17,058
And I'm a kumquat from Queens.
Pipe down, towel-head!

734
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:20,311
- Come on, Ralph.
- Take the ladder and put it over the well.

735
01:33:20,395 --> 01:33:24,065
- Please, don't let us die!
- That's a good idea, Legs.

736
01:33:24,148 --> 01:33:29,570
I ain't gonna let you die, but I ain't movin' no
ladder until you come across with the rock!

737
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:45,877
Lookin' more like 90-10! Huh, kumquat?

738
01:33:47,754 --> 01:33:51,592
- Did you get the ladder all right?
- Jack, help me unlock the Jewel.

739
01:33:51,675 --> 01:33:56,387
The Jewel? You mean you weren't
shittin' me? That guy really is the Jewel?

740
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:59,599
Come on.
We still got time to stop Omar. Let's go.

741
01:34:00,725 --> 01:34:03,686
Ralph, that is not the Sufi way.

742
01:34:03,769 --> 01:34:08,983
I don't know what got into me, Jewels. Every
time I'm around this guy he makes me crazy.

743
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:13,279
Come on. Tell him to cut me down, Jewels.
Come on, huh?

744
01:34:58,447 --> 01:35:02,159
Don't fuck around with the equipment!
Bloody woman!

745
01:35:26,266 --> 01:35:28,351
Here they come, Jack.

746
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:55,251
Oh, my God. Look at this. Looks like
Our Lady of Mount Palmer schoolyard.

747
01:35:56,752 --> 01:35:58,671
Hold it!

748
01:36:02,967 --> 01:36:05,678
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

749
01:36:07,305 --> 01:36:08,973
Oh, Rachid.

750
01:36:09,056 --> 01:36:13,102
How ya doin'? Let's talk this over
before you butcher me alive.

751
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:15,688
What are you getting so steamed about?

752
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:21,026
Look at that. It worked!

753
01:38:01,372 --> 01:38:03,541
Get over the wall. Come on!

754
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:06,002
Get goin'.

755
01:38:10,965 --> 01:38:13,050
Keep going.

756
01:38:38,824 --> 01:38:42,286
I knew we'd hook up again, Colton. Get it?

757
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:47,166
I swear to God!

758
01:38:47,249 --> 01:38:49,335
My right hand to God!

759
01:38:49,418 --> 01:38:51,503
Come on!

760
01:39:32,417 --> 01:39:37,631
I am dead, Miss Wilder.
All that will be written for Omar is an epitaph.

761
01:39:38,006 --> 01:39:40,092
But I will not be alone.

762
01:39:49,767 --> 01:39:52,311
Who is going to save you now?

763
01:39:54,981 --> 01:39:56,440
Who?

764
01:40:37,563 --> 01:40:39,648
Well, you got your story.

765
01:40:40,608 --> 01:40:42,693
I got a lot more than that.

766
01:41:06,799 --> 01:41:08,593
