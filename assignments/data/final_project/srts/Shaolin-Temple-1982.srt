1
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:25,013
Shao Lin, Shao Lin.

2
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:30,389
How many heroes adore you.

3
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,327
Shao Lin, Shao Lin.

4
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:39,662
How many wonderful stories
mentioned you.

5
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,505
Your martial art is the only one
in the world.

6
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:47,579
The Shao Lin Temple is famous
everywhere.

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,241
Its history last forever.

8
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,319
The Shao Lin Temple is splendid.

9
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,115
The thousand years' old temple,

10
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,259
the mystic place,

11
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,092
the valley of Song Shan,

12
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,734
every people dreams of,

13
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:15,172
the original place of martial art,

14
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,835
the charming place,

15
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,637
is well-known in everywhere,

16
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,710
and will be praised forever.

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:36,695
Shao Lin, Shao Lin, Shao Lin...

18
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:55,309
You good boys.

19
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:59,575
Ya Chu Lai has suffered for you,

20
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,721
and you have been purified.

21
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:08,351
Now I tell you the facts of ten laws,

22
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:13,362
to advise you respecting yourself,

23
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,400
and others.

24
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,395
Chueh-Yuan.

25
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:26,901
Firstly, thou shall not kill.

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,648
Can't you do that?

27
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,515
Thou shall not kill,
can't you do that?

28
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,219
Thou shall not kill,
can't you do that?

29
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,872
Who is lazy, who shall be killed.

30
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,603
Wars happened during the end
of Sui Dynasty.

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,379
Heroes fought for empire
and divided the land.

32
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,353
The traitor Wang Shi Chuang

33
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,288
settled at Tung Tu.

34
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,985
Named himself King Cheng,
and ruled cruelly.

35
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,330
Li Shi Min and his army

36
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,295
are already near Hwangho.

37
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,663
How can be defend
with these weak men?

38
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,895
General,
we really can't get strong men.

39
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,440
We even have to use
the dying prisoners.

40
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,736
Take all prisoners
and Mighty Leg Chang to me.

41
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,210
Yes.

42
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,815
Hurry! Hurry!

43
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:58,961
Get out.

44
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,571
You are called Mighty Leg Chang.

45
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,434
I'll make your legs broken.

46
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,360
Father.

47
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,068
Father.

48
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,802
Be careful.

49
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:24,609
Hsiao Hu, run away.
Dad...

50
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,032
Ready,

51
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,174
Who is it?

52
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,244
Amida Buddha.

53
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,216
Abbot, more and more people
are starving, soon,

54
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,119
our property,

55
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,531
Can't afford to feed the people.

56
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:27,263
To help them
is our Buddhist's business.

57
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,700
Amida Buddha!

58
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,578
From now on,
tell those people to leave.

59
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,739
No one can stay here.

60
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,607
Abbot. This boy is seriously hurt
and fainted.

61
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,113
Will you keep him stay?

62
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,245
No.

63
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,987
That will bring us great trouble.

64
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,092
Jen Jih,
save one's life is important,

65
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,695
Talk no more.

66
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:56,230
Abbot.
His identity is unknown,

67
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,234
I'm afraid he may bring us trouble...

68
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:04,300
Since Wang Jen-Tse settled,
he killed innocent,

69
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,010
that made people angered.

70
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,844
Abbot, Buddhist should be kind,

71
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,979
you let him stay.
Abbot...

72
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,817
Saved him first.

73
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,356
Buddha bless him.

74
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,766
You are bringing yourself

75
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,932
into trouble.

76
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,331
Master,
we can't put water into him mouth.

77
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,043
He is too weak.

78
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:44,181
We don't have rich food,
may be we can't saved him.

79
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,710
How can we be like this,

80
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,284
what shall we do?

81
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,890
"Go as wind, stand ad pine,
sit as bell, rest as bow"

82
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,662
Then what are you doing?

83
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,066
We... we are practicing Toad Kung-fu.

84
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,867
Right.

85
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:38,961
Don't do that.

86
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,964
You offend the law,

87
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,666
face the wall for three days.

88
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,444
What?

89
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,654
Why do you follow me?

90
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,202
What are you laughing for?
What so funny?

91
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,112
As a monk,
you should neither cheer nor anger.

92
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,755
You beast.

93
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,354
Master, kill it.

94
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:43,928
It's a sin, Set it free.

95
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,762
Yeah.

96
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,701
Amida Buddha.

97
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,403
Amida Buddha.

98
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,143
Master.
Amida Buddha.

99
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,743
Master, I'm guilty.

100
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,974
What is it?

101
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,486
I committed murder.

102
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,955
"Save one's life
and you can go to heaven."

103
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,126
The frog will be grateful
if it knows.

104
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,092
Sure?

105
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,956
Monks won't cheat.

106
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,493
I do understand.

107
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,246
Painful?

108
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,991
No.

109
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,773
Thank you...

110
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,908
Let's talk again
when you have recovered.

111
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,087
Master, congee with frog.

112
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,085
Wu Sha sent him two eggs.

113
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,088
She cares him so much.

114
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,873
Master, how is the taste?

115
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,598
You should know,

116
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,175
He think he is smart.

117
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:20,891
The sun rises from Song Shan.

118
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:27,027
Morning bell wakes the birds.

119
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:34,137
Streams runs along the wood.

120
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:39,039
Grasses are green on the hillside.

121
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:47,346
Fruit smell sweet,
flower look pretty.

122
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,222
The dogs hop, the rams run.

123
00:14:53,425 --> 00:15:01,457
Hold up the whip and flicks softly.

124
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:10,308
Song drifts along the mountain.

125
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,003
Watch out!

126
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,084
Ya Wong, chase him.

127
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,221
Wo, Wo. Come on.

128
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,029
It's really coming.

129
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,301
Ya Wong, chase him.

130
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,189
I go to take again.

131
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,697
Get away.

132
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:50,610
It's useless
if one only knows to eat and sleep.

133
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:12,567
It's useless
if one only knows to eat and sleep.

134
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,499
Hey, wake up.

135
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,670
Oh, it's dead.

136
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,857
Who is it?

137
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,373
It's me...

138
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,068
What are you doing?

139
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,108
I want to take the short cut
to get water.

140
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,383
T'a Lin is the land
for burying monks of Shao Lin.

141
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,453
Nobody is allowed
without the abbot's permission. Get!

142
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,510
Yes!

143
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,563
I didn't mean to kill you.

144
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,906
I think it's good of me, to bury you

145
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,937
in this scenic place.

146
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,457
It's buried, that's pitiful.

147
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,606
Fairy would come
if he smells the taste of dog's meat.

148
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,687
It's a pity that you are monk.

149
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,120
Hsiao Hu.

150
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,762
Big Monk.

151
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:25,164
You are weak,
this food is good to your health.

152
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,667
I...

153
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,405
You are not buddhist,

154
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:33,500
and you are outside the temple.
You need not obey our law,

155
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:34,836
you may eat.

156
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,818
You have eaten before, aren't you?

157
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,451
This is usually cook with ginger,

158
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,055
wolfberry's fruit...

159
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,093
But it is my first time

160
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,862
see this way of cooking.

161
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,831
You are tired enough for caring me,

162
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,731
and you should take some rich food.

163
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,197
Amida Buddha.

164
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,974
As a buddhist,
it's guilty even to think of it.

165
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,536
It's hard to enjoy such good food.

166
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,614
No one will come here, you may eat.

167
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,983
Master...

168
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,755
Master...

169
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,156
Master, during these years
in Shao Lin Temple,

170
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,128
we work more than we eat.

171
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:37,197
It's tired.
It's hard to have this rich food.

172
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,781
You have one.

173
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,082
Master, let's eat together.

174
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:53,980
These buddhists came here
when they were in danger,

175
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,628
in such case,
so they aren't so devoted.

176
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,491
Let's eat, it taste good...

177
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,833
Master, then,
aren't we breaking the law?

178
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,805
"With Buddha in your heart,
wine and meat are nothing."

179
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,734
We must have Buddha in heart,
and help people.

180
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,505
No need to worry about too much.

181
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,239
I understand.

182
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,015
"With Buddha in your heart,
wine and meat are nothing."

183
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,653
Brother Shih K'ung realized this
already.

184
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,861
Big Monk, he?

185
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,693
Love can't be forgotten.

186
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,571
Shih K'ung,

187
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:54,309
wine increase sadness,
don't get drunk.

188
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,981
We've eaten Hsiao Hu's dog.

189
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,023
And we haven't requite.

190
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:05,324
Master, monks have nothing,

191
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,359
nothing to requite.

192
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,774
Shih K'ung, aren't you hurt?

193
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,375
He's drunken.

194
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,273
The fool.

195
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,183
Shih K'ung.

196
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,666
Big Monk, he?

197
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,863
He looks drunk but he isn't drunk.

198
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,365
Looks drunk but not drunk?

199
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,041
Drunken stick?

200
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,270
Yes, years ago,
when his wife was giving birth,

201
00:26:57,415 --> 00:27:02,910
he was so happy
that he bought a large pot of wine.

202
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:08,022
But, his wife had been killed

203
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:13,858
by the robber Wang Jen-Tse.

204
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,962
So he became very fond of wine.

205
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,740
Every day he is sad and drunk.

206
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,675
And that made him
to create the "Drunken Stick".

207
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:31,641
He has such smart kung-fu,
why don't he revenge?

208
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,649
Can't defeat so many enemies alone.
Somebody.

209
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,056
Hide.

210
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,754
Get away.

211
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,844
Amida Buddha. It's a sin.

212
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,480
Ya Wong. Ya Wong.

213
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,126
Madam.

214
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,991
Did you see my dog?

215
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,928
Oh, you killed my dog.

216
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,728
No. Madam, please listen to me...

217
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:29,365
No, give me back my dog,
give me back.

218
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,937
Is that enough? Otherwise,
I'll hurt you.

219
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,456
You dare hit me?

220
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,291
As you are a girl,
I let you hit few times,

221
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,234
If you continue on,
I'll hurt you.

222
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,047
Father.

223
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:12,545
Father?

224
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,985
What's so serious? You are so cruel
to make him hurt like this.

225
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,855
It's him who's so cruel.

226
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,124
Madam, I didn't mean to...

227
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,896
However you explain,

228
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,189
I won't forgive the one ate my dog.

229
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,131
That means,
you won't even forgive me?

230
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,101
You?

231
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,171
I also ate the dog.

232
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,175
Father, why do you shelter him?

233
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,344
So are you. He recovered so fast,

234
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,575
all because of your eggs
and goats' milk.

235
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,010
I...

236
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,180
Thank you.

237
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,993
I hate you, revenge instead of thank.

238
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,056
Look at this girl!

239
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,167
Is she really your daughter?

240
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,431
This girl had no mother
since she was a baby.

241
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,905
At that time,
I was being attacked by Wang Jen-Tse,

242
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,808
and was force to hide myself
in Shao Lin Temple.

243
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,512
So I made her stay at a farmer's home.

244
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:23,815
The old man spoiled her
because he had no kids.

245
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,081
I must kill Wang Jen-Tse for revenge.

246
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,986
Please teach me Shao Lin Kung-fu.

247
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,219
The temple has rule,

248
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,992
kung-fu is use for protection,
it cannot be learnt by other people.

249
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,597
You aren't Shao Lin monks, I...

250
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,903
I'm willing to become a monk.

251
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,541
No killing.

252
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,678
It bite me.

253
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,346
The Temple's door is widely opened,
good man my enter.

254
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,421
He seems enjoying to kill.

255
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,054
The Temple cannot allow him.

256
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,157
Buddhist should be merciful.

257
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:53,002
Chueh Yuan wills to cut his hair,
he has been good.

258
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:02,979
Willing to do evils,
willing to achieve goodness,

259
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,523
must task to save all people.

260
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,551
Chueh Yuan, what's the matter?

261
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,463
Master, I have been a monk
for nearly three months,

262
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:53,626
besides gett water and cut wood
bricks, I stand here all day long,

263
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,365
when will you teach me
Shao Lin Kung-fu?

264
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,138
It's only three months,
look at your senior brothers,

265
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,405
smoke coming out from head,
holes made by foot,

266
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,205
this Vajra breaking power,

267
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,681
needs three to five years
of practicing.

268
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,452
What? Just stand like this
need three to five years.

269
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,585
Remember, practice kung-fu,
don't fear bitterness.

270
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,992
I'll remember.

271
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,135
Chueh Yuan, good!

272
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,150
Stop it!

273
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,854
Shao Lin kung-fu is for defense
and not attack.

274
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,261
You look like enjoying to kill.

275
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,227
You're punished to face the wall
for three days!

276
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,467
Oh brother!
Brother

277
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,138
Aren't you afraid of being punished
again?

278
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,405
I...
Go back to your work!

279
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,645
Should we regard killing mosquito
as a sin?

280
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,478
If that is so,
how can I revenge my father's death?

281
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,188
Why should I be a monk
without learning kung-fu?

282
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,691
It is not that easy to be a monk.

283
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,821
I don't want to be a monk any more.

284
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,894
Master, please forgive me
for leaving you.

285
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,205
Miss Pak, I own you a life.

286
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,808
I'll repay your kindness in future.

287
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,953
She is pretty, let's bring her back.

288
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,193
She's such a wild girl.
Let's kill her!

289
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,396
Stop it!

290
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,519
Thank you.

291
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,597
General, please taste these velvet
and ram's penis.

292
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,670
No.

293
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,605
They are good for nothing
without the girl.

294
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,342
It's a sin.

295
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,907
General,
I have got some gaming food for you.

296
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,314
Gaming food?
Oh, it's good!

297
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,553
Good.

298
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,424
General, watch out for her wildness.

299
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,322
Her wildness? Her wildness?

300
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,726
General!
What?

301
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,862
There's a kid outside the door.
He has wounded several of us.

302
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,941
How come you are not dead yet, kid?

303
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,651
That is tough for her.

304
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:34,365
It won't be funny
without the wildness.

305
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,017
Chueh Yuan!

306
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,423
It's you.

307
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,841
Oh, be careful!

308
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,456
He's drunk.

309
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,685
Drunken sword?

310
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,103
Chueh Yuan!
You better run quickly.

311
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,906
How about you?
I have to take revenge.

312
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:51,825
Aren't you woken yet?

313
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,170
You are looking for death, Kid.

314
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,858
Run quickly!

315
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,244
Li Shih-Min? Let's chase!

316
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,755
Oh! You are bleeding!

317
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,402
Thank you.

318
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,311
I also thank you for saving my life.

319
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,518
Miss Pak, aren't you angry with me?

320
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,720
Angry for what?

321
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,852
I owe you a life.

322
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,152
A dog's life or human life?

323
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,057
I have already got an advantage.

324
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,095
It's a pity I am unable
to kill Wang Jen-Tse.

325
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,962
He's got too many lackeys.

326
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,202
Dad is good at kung-fu,
yet has to hide in Shao Lin.

327
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,368
You better return to Shao Lin.

328
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,772
But I have sneaked our from it!

329
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,086
Oh! You are back!

330
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,899
I know you will come back.

331
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,126
You don't want to leave us,
don't you?

332
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,997
It is better to be a monk, isn't it?

333
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,135
Well, it took us years to achieve it.

334
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,070
You can achieve it
in only one day's time.

335
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,444
Well done, little brother!

336
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,209
Master!

337
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:38,383
Master, please punish me.

338
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,597
You have not grown up yet.

339
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,934
Nothing is that easy.

340
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:51,500
You are lucky to come back alive.

341
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,607
Are you hungry?

342
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:59,813
Drink it!

343
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,319
Thank you, master.

344
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:13,426
Learn it hard
from your senior brother in future.

345
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,738
He's got no way to go. Catch him!

346
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,205
My gracious Saviour!
Is you.

347
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:51,272
They've got too many men.
Don't fight with them.

348
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,114
Here is a cliff. Come with me.

349
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,250
Kill him.

350
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,229
Let's search!

351
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,618
Don't you dare to stop us
from catching the prisoner.

352
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,318
This is T'a Lin holy land.

353
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,754
No admission without permission
from our abbot.

354
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,455
Bald-head,
you are looking for death!

355
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,190
Stop it!

356
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,126
No fighting!

357
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,155
Abbot.

358
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:19,702
Amida Buddha.

359
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:25,431
General. This is a land
for burying Shao Lin monks.

360
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,772
Even King Cheng will respect
this land.

361
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,939
Why do you want to fight,
General?

362
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,614
A prisoner of King Cheng
is hiding here.

363
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,384
I want to have a search.

364
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,284
A little bald-head has helped
the prisoner to escape.

365
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,286
If you don't let me search,
the king will blame us.

366
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,924
Will you dare
to take the responsibility?

367
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,829
T'a Lin is our holy land.

368
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:53,296
Please dismount from horse
and go inside for search.

369
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:55,900
Alright!

370
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,811
Come with me.

371
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,614
Guard the road and go
for the search separately.

372
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,480
Master!

373
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,356
Chase
Yes...

374
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,961
Keep guard here!

375
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,396
That way

376
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:20,520
Run up to the back of the hill
and don't turn back.

377
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,258
Don't stop or I will shoot!
Run for it!

378
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,531
Who told you to come in?

379
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,004
We are helping the General
to catch the prisoner.

380
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,773
Damn it!

381
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,709
The prisoner has run away
to the back of the hill.

382
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,011
Mount the horses and chase!
Yes...

383
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:54,955
Run!

384
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,939
I've heard King Li Shih-Min
went to visit

385
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,837
enemy's place by himself.
Is that you?

386
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,077
Thank you, Madam.

387
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,851
You've not taken food for two days.
Eat the food!

388
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,650
As you are a monk,
can you take meat?

389
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,521
With Buddha in your heart,
wine and meat are nothing.

390
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:45,032
Monks always have Buddha
in their hearts.

391
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:46,559
Take it!

392
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,867
Your life as a monk is too simple
and poor.

393
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:55,568
Right.

394
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,910
Wang Jen-Tse's soldiers
have searched everywhere.

395
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,778
You better stay here for a few
more days.

396
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:04,149
I will send you food.
Okay.

397
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,150
Thank you, Madam. I've a job to do

398
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:11,622
must cross the river at once.
Do you know if there is a shortcut?

399
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,189
Well, we can escort you
to cross the river.

400
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:19,435
There are many check points.
How can you pass them?

401
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,258
Put down your hand at once!

402
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,161
You're born to be a couple.
It's a pity you're monk.

403
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,594
Dont' be shy.

404
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,505
What now?
Let's go!

405
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,306
You've got a lot of romance, Kid!

406
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,646
It's a pity you are a monk.

407
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,520
Sir, it's late now.

408
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,852
The bridegroom and
bride must return to their room.

409
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,153
Will you please let them go.

410
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,290
Damn it! Stop pretending.

411
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,564
How can we fool you?

412
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,703
Don't play that!

413
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,772
I'll buy you a drink.
Will you give me a favor?

414
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,673
Alright, you may go!

415
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,542
Thank you, Sir.

416
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,648
Don't be too cautious, brother!

417
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,827
Let's go and have a drink!

418
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:44,979
Is it hurt?

419
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,579
No.

420
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,288
Tear if off quickly.

421
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:58,792
Oh! It's bleeding!

422
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,030
What are you laughing for?

423
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,172
You really look
like a sweet little wife.

424
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:29,649
Thanks for saving my life.
I'll repay your kindness.

425
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,803
Li Shih-Min, you can't get away.
Shoot.

426
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,974
Stop it! The general wants him alive.

427
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,983
We'll get promotion
and fortune this time.

428
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:56,777
Capture him alive!

429
01:00:58,421 --> 01:00:59,285
Will you take him cross the river?

430
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,720
How about yourself?
Hurry.

431
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:10,733
They are running!

432
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,371
Shoot!

433
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:43,192
Master!

434
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,365
Master!

435
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,938
Bald-heads,
don't you want to betray us?

436
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:55,942
I guess they don't have guts
to do that.

437
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,405
Buddhists do not kill. Let's move!

438
01:01:58,781 --> 01:01:59,941
Master, what shall we do now?

439
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:05,413
We need to defend ourselves.
Buddha will not give mercy to devils.

440
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:06,979
I understand.

441
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:36,944
Chueh Yuan, kill him!

442
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:38,278
Don't you dare to kill?

443
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,483
Buddhist and thief
won't live together. I'll kill you!

444
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,093
Chueh Yuan, kill.

445
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,342
Chueh Yuan, kill him!

446
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:47,373
Amida Buddha! My holy Buddha,
please forgive us.

447
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,406
Chueh Yuan is only taking them

448
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:52,411
to the heaven.

449
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,082
Buddha will forgive us.

450
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,547
Yes!

451
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:59,977
Chueh Yuan is doing it
you goodness sake.

452
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:04,724
Master.
I know I have committed sin again.

453
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:09,221
But, they would have killed me
if I didn't do it.

454
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,558
Yes, he is right.

455
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,732
Your mind can never he purified
and stay with Buddha.

456
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:18,964
You are leaving Buddha from now on.

457
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,301
Master!

458
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,103
Go far away from us!

459
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:31,209
Master! Wang Jen-Tse is still
waiting in Temple for him.

460
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,780
You can't be responsible
for letting him go.

461
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:42,223
Let's go back.

462
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:49,103
Why don't you mount the horses?

463
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:54,706
Master,
the buddhists are always merciful.

464
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:58,136
I know I'm wrong.
Please give me another chance.

465
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,552
Go away!
Don't come back to Shao Lin Temple!

466
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,125
Master!

467
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:28,566
Master...

468
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,739
Master!

469
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,518
Master!

470
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:43,121
Stop him!
Don't let him come into the Temple!

471
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,284
Master!

472
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:53,661
Hurry and go.

473
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,294
Master!

474
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,734
Wang Jen-Tse is waiting to catch you,
run quickly!

475
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,807
I don't want master and brothers
to be blamed.

476
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,272
Please let me in!

477
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,637
Master!

478
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,549
Master!
Tie him up and take him down hill!

479
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,348
Master, you have saved my life.

480
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:47,920
And abbot has helped me
in reincarnation.

481
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,689
I can't cause disaster
to Shao Lin because of me.

482
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:55,594
Let me have the suffering. Master!

483
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,136
Sorry for not seeing you off.

484
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,236
The monk has gone
but the temple still remains.

485
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,932
If you don't hand over the monk
and Li in three days,

486
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:08,834
I'll destroy Shao Lin Temple.

487
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,758
It's really a big trouble.

488
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:29,663
I've said he would get Shao Lin
into trouble.

489
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:32,198
We should have not let him stay.

490
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:34,163
Amida Buddha.

491
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:38,772
Buddhists are all merciful,

492
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:44,369
As Chueh Yuan is my disciple,
we must help him.

493
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:49,741
Being a Buddhist for years,
how can you say this?

494
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:52,513
You are wrong!

495
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:56,185
I'm sorry.

496
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:01,724
General!

497
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,291
General!

498
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,869
Have you found Li Shih-Min
and the monk?

499
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,366
I've found them.

500
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:14,440
Where are they?

501
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,903
The Shao Lin monks have helped Li
to escape.

502
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:22,377
Chueh Yuan has killed
all our soldiers.

503
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:27,248
Traitors!
Let's march into Shao Lin Temple!

504
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,269
There'll be a disaster
in Shao Lin Temple.

505
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:54,473
Master, let's fight with them!
Yeah, fight with them...

506
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:58,915
We are trained in kung-fu.
We must protect Shao Lin.

507
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,554
Master, please let me go out.

508
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,986
I'll be responsible for everything.

509
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:06,925
To take the responsibility alone
be yourself?

510
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:10,022
How can you fight against
Wang's army by yourself?

511
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:11,331
I...

512
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,760
You are too eager to take revenge.

513
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,796
You better unfrock
and join Li Shih-Min.

514
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:21,738
Master,
I have not repaid your kindness.

515
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:27,040
I'm a buddhist monk
and have nothing to worry.

516
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,915
Only my daughter worries me.

517
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:32,579
Fahter!

518
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,820
If you can
take care of her in future.

519
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:41,551
I'll have no more to worry.
Father!

520
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:43,726
Master!

521
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:47,727
You go with him.

522
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,535
No matter what happens to us,
protect him and don't come back.

523
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:53,341
You may go!

524
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,772
Master...
Father!

525
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,120
Abbot! It's no good!

526
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:42,682
Wang Jen-Tse's army has passed
the Shao Shih Shan.

527
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,656
They'll reach our main entrance
very soon.

528
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,764
If we don't worry anything,
nothing will worry us.

529
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:55,566
Then we'll have a sound mind.
Why are you still so afraid?

530
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,039
Buddha bless us!

531
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,668
Tell the monks not to start any move.

532
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:03,705
Yes!

533
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:09,181
Let's lay siege to Shao Lin.
Bowmen to a ambush in hide-out!

534
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,109
Don't let any monk to escape.

535
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:20,158
Kill...

536
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:23,697
Kill...

537
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:31,667
Amida Buddha!

538
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,073
Abbot...

539
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,415
Why do you want to

540
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,850
attack our temple, General?

541
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:50,758
Because Shao Lin monks conspire
with Li Shih-Min.

542
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,860
There is evidence
to prove the treason.

543
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:55,824
I'm ordered to punish the monks

544
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:57,864
and burn the temple.

545
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,125
Burn it down!

546
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:05,971
Hold it, General! I have a request.

547
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,636
Say it!

548
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:11,169
This is a historical land.

549
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:13,704
If there's a crime,
it should not involve the temple.

550
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:17,448
And the punishment shouldn't extend
to the monks.

551
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:22,923
As a temple abbot,
I'll take all responsibilities.

552
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,686
Alright, I'll kill you first.

553
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,123
Light up the fire!

554
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:43,602
Abbot!

555
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:48,106
If anyone tells me the whereabouts
of the traitors,

556
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:52,476
I'll keep your temple in peace
and abbot alive.

557
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,192
Abbot!

558
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:11,733
Abbot! Amida Buddha.

559
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,538
Kill him!

560
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:21,640
Oh, you!

561
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,819
If none of you speaks,
I'll kill you all.

562
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,744
Abbot!

563
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,215
No killing!

564
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:32,856
Abbot,
kindness results nothing to evil.

565
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,256
Kill the devils and enter Buddha.

566
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:40,696
Let's release their souls
and bring them to death.

567
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,868
Abbot!

568
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:14,792
Brother
Pan K'ung!

569
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,671
Master, you start killing now!

570
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,772
Let's kill them. They deserve it.

571
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:46,575
Shoot the arrows!

572
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:13,907
General...
Shoot the arrows!

573
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:16,937
Master!

574
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:26,919
Master!
Father!

575
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:35,194
Shoot the arrows!

576
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:43,229
Let's charge into the temple
and burn it down!

577
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:48,975
Master!
Father!

578
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,375
Li Shih-Min has crossed the river
with his army.

579
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,086
They are heading for Tung Tu.

580
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:07,021
You must defend Shao Lin

581
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:11,258
and uphold the justice.

582
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:19,029
Master!
Father!

583
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:31,616
Let's kill them!

584
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:33,518
General!

585
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:37,424
It's a bad news. Li Shih-Min
and his army have crossed

586
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:39,457
the river heading for Tung Tu.
What?

587
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,130
Kill them!

588
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,405
Kill them!

589
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,154
Kill!

590
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,651
Chueh Yuan, watch out for the sword!

591
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:02,789
Thou shall not kill. Can you do that?

592
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:08,629
I'll stop killing but not stop
to uphold justice.

593
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:23,583
Secondly, thou shall not steal.
Can you do that?

594
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,485
I've determined to enter Buddha,

595
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:34,657
Thirdly, thou shall not covet,
can you do that?

596
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:53,475
I've determined to enter Buddha,

597
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:58,515
to defend Shao Lin
and uphold the justice.

598
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:35,115
Thou shall not covet,
Can you do that?

599
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:38,256
Yes.

600
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:48,698
Fifthly, thou shall not drink.
Can you do that?

601
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:55,975
I suggest this vow should be exempted.

602
01:31:58,279 --> 01:31:59,576
Your majesty!

603
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:05,777
Since your majesty has given an order,

604
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:11,587
this vow of drink
shall be exempted forever.

605
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:11,844
To show appreciation,

606
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,344
King Li of T'ang Dynasty awarded

607
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:18,086
the Shao Lin monks

608
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,151
many fortunes.

609
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,362
The monks only accepted

610
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:25,899
a gown for each,

611
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:29,230
a tea set, and forty acres of land.

612
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:31,668
The King permitted Shao Lin

613
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:35,333
to form a defence force.

614
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,908
Such legend was recorded
on a temple stone

615
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:43,611
with the royal signature
of King Li Shih-Min.

616
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:50,781
The martial art of Shao Lin began
to prevail.

617
01:33:51,225 --> 01:33:56,857
The fame of Shao Lin kung-fu was
everlasting.
