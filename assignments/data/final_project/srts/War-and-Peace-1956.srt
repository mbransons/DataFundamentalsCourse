1
00:00:00,105 --> 00:00:04,672
A peace treaty has been ratified
with the Emperor of France.

2
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:07,299
Who will now be our gallant ally.

3
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:09,320
It'll come to war again.

4
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:12,992
I am in love with Sonya
and I want us to be married.

5
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:14,025
You had better know that

6
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,989
I can never recognise that
intriguer as my daughter!

7
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:18,989
My father made it a
condition of his consent

8
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,928
that the marriage not
take place for a year.

9
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,056
I'll wait.

10
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:24,993
- You're so lovely.
- You mustn't say that!

11
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:26,037
Why ever not?

12
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:30,001
Will you tell Prince
Andrei when he comes

13
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,985
that our engagement is at an end...

14
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:33,061
and I cannot be his wife.

15
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,073
He loves me, Sonya!

16
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:38,029
I'd do anything...
I'd run away with him!

17
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:40,029
You're to come with us, sir.

18
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:42,005
We've been betrayed!

19
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:43,053
No!

20
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:45,057
I will go to him, wherever he is!

21
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:47,997
He's a married man,
he has a wife in Poland!

22

23
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:58,005
Andrei, I'm so sorry about this.

24
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:00,029
Yes, well...

25
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:04,009
Just to confirm, I have received
a refusal from Countess Rostova,

26
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:05,037
and rumours have reached me

27
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:06,349
about an intrigue with your

28
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:08,000
brother-in-law. Is that correct?

29
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,033
Yes, but that's all over.
Anatole has left Moscow.

30
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:12,049
Well, it makes no difference.

31
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,993
When you see Countess Rostova,

32
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:16,013
tell her that she was
and is completely free,

33
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:17,057
and I wish her no ill.

34
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:18,997
Is that all?

35
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,073
Look here, I'm sure it was
a moment of madness,

36
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:25,021
and she regrets it bitterly.

37
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:28,077
She loves you, I'm sure
of it, and you love her.

38
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:30,029
Remember when you came to me

39
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:33,001
and told me how madly
you were in love with her?

40
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:40,013
I know you believe a fallen woman
should be forgiven, Pierre,

41
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:42,029
and I admire you for it.

42
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,077
But I'm a different sort of man.

43
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:47,009
I cannot forgive, and I WILL not.

44
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,981
Here are her letters,
and her portrait.

45
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:54,033
I would be grateful if you
would return them to her.

46
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:56,981
Andrei, think how
she must be suffering.

47
00:02:58,013 --> 00:02:59,993
Will you do as I ask?

48
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:05,045
Yes, of course.

49
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:06,985
Then take them.

50
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,045
And if we are to remain friends,

51
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:12,005
I ask you never to speak
to me about this again.

52
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:14,985
Goodbye.

53
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:54,001
You're not well.

54
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,053
I wish I were dead.

55
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:57,037
No...

56
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,655
No, no, don't say that.

57
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,077
What did he say?

58
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,065
Only that you are free,
have always been free,

59
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:13,613
and he bears you no ill will.

60
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,001
Yes, that's like him.

61
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:20,985
I know it's all over.

62
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:24,464
And I'm tormented by the
wrong I've done him.

63
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:28,013
But will you...?

64
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,648
Will you ask him if he can forgive me?

65
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,033
Of course I will.

66
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,061
But, Natasha...

67
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:44,073
What happened?
How did it come about?

68
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:48,989
Did you...? Did you love that scoundrel?

69
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,013
Don't call him that!

70
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:52,065
I don't know.

71
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:54,985
I don't know anything any more.

72
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:56,025
I'm so unhappy.

73
00:04:57,985 --> 00:05:00,053
I've spoilt everything, haven't I?

74
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:04,997
Don't try to talk about it now.

75
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:08,025
Later, when your soul is clear,

76
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:10,041
remember, I'm always your friend.

77
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:14,981
If you need help, or advice,
or just to pour your soul out,

78
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,033
remember me, dear Natasha.

79
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,033
Don't talk to me like that.

80
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,989
I don't deserve it.

81
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:25,001
I'm ruined, aren't I?

82
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:28,001
No... for God's sake, no. Listen.

83
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,490
If I were not married myself,
and a better man than I am...

84
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:32,985
I mean, worthy of you...

85
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,045
I would go down on
my knees this minute

86
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:37,997
and ask for your hand and your love.

87
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:42,069
Oh...

88
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:45,013
Pierre...

89
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:24,592
Courage, mademoiselle.

90
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:31,009
Oh, Ilya, when shall we
have our Natasha back?

91
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,009
The doctor says she's making
good progress, physically.

92
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,053
It's as if the spirit
were gone from her.

93
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:39,045
She doesn't want to
read, or talk, or sing...

94
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,009
Pierre seems to bring
her a little comfort.

95
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:46,053
We should never have let her engage
herself to that cold-hearted man!

96
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:49,065
To gain her affections and then
leave her alone for a year...

97
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:52,017
almost as if he wanted
her to betray him!

98
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:57,993
Oh, Ilya...

99
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:01,005
... where's our lovely girl gone?

100
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:24,001
Oh, God, in your mercy, forgive me,

101
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,057
and show me the way
to lead a better life.

102
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:35,981
Vive l'Empereur!
Vive l'Empereur!

103
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:43,362
_

104
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:46,989
Across the river, Russia.

105
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:51,009
The time has come, gentlemen.

106
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,057
Sound the advance.

107
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:03,981
This breach of our treaty cannot
and will not be endured.

108
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:05,025
Hear, hear!

109
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,005
I will not make peace with that man

110
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:10,077
unless he withdraws every one of
his soldiers from Russian soil!

111
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,663
Drubetskoy.

112
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:17,077
Come here.

113
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:25,017
I appoint you to take
my message to Napoleon.

114
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:30,001
I thank Your Majesty
for this great honour.

115
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:36,045
Make sure he understands.

116
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:40,013
Not one single French soldier
to remain on Russian soil.

117
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:42,057
Now, go... and may God be with you.

118
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:08,630
Wait here, sir.

119
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,057
Monsieur Drubetskoy.

120
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:26,308
- Sire, the Emperor...
- You are very young.

121
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:31,013
I do not want war

122
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:33,057
and I never wanted it.

123
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:37,021
Your master has brought
it all upon himself.

124
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:40,033
He could have had
Moldavia and Wallachia.

125
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,013
Let him bear the consequences.

126
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,997
Your generals have
no stomach for a fight.

127
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:47,369
On... On the contrary,

128
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:49,044
- Your Majesty...
- Don't argue with me.

129
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,073
I know everything.

130
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:54,989
I know the state of
your miserable army.

131
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:57,069
You have 200,000 men.
I have three times that.

132
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:00,005
Sire, if you are prepared
to withdraw your troops

133
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:03,009
beyond the Neman, then
the Emperor will negotiate.

134
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,989
C'est trop tard, mon petit.

135
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:09,033
It's too late.

136
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,025
I'm going to take your country.

137
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:13,029
But it's all right.

138
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,989
It's not your fault.

139
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:19,025
Tell your master
he'll receive my letter.

140
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:27,025
It's considered a great
honour, monsieur,

141
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,993
to have one's ear pulled
by the Emperor.

142
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,065
Oh, right...

143
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,981
Thank you.

144
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:45,017
Well, we're at war again.

145
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:48,981
Napoleon's crossed the Neman and
he's advancing towards Smolensk.

146
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,029
- Oh, Ilya!
- Don't fret, my dear,

147
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,025
he'll be driven back before
he gets anywhere near Moscow.

148
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,997
But Nikolai...

149
00:10:55,997 --> 00:10:58,009
Nikolai's a seasoned officer now.

150
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,017
He knows how to look after himself.

151
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:02,981
All we can do is hope and pray.

152
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:05,049
- Papa, let me enlist!
- Absolutely not!

153
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:07,069
I won't allow it... a boy of 15!

154
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:10,073
All my friends are volunteering!

155
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:14,057
If you won't find me a commission,
I'll run away and find one myself!

156
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,029
It might be best to let him join up...

157
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,275
- Ilya!
- ... find him a billet

158
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,841
where he can look the part, but...

159
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:28,648
... stay out of danger.

160
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:31,009
Is anywhere safe now?

161
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,057
Ah, Tikhon... it's good to see you.

162
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:46,057
- How are things?
- All well, Your Excellency.

163
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:49,049
Ah, we have been waiting
and waiting for your arrival!

164
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:51,997
Do step in, Prince Andrei!

165
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:53,049
Do I need your invitation?

166
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,981
- No, of course...
- Are you mistress of this house now?

167
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,049
No, not at all...

168
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,021
Where are my father and
Princess Marya? And my son?

169
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:02,025
Inside, waiting for you, Prince.

170
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:06,993
Papa! Papa!

171
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,997
How are you, Masha?

172
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:15,057
So, you're going to war again?

173
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:17,077
Run along.

174
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:20,037
What else is there for me to do?

175
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:22,021
The French grow closer by the day.

176
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:23,985
I wish you could stay with us.

177
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:27,997
Your little boy hardly knows you.

178
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,753
Well, it can't be helped.

179
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:38,033
I hope you're finding my son a
responsive pupil, Monsieur Dessales?

180
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,049
Oh, yes. Of course,
he's still very young,

181
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:43,017
but already I detect a certain
gift for la mathematique.

182
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:46,009
Ah! Unlike his Aunt Marya, here!

183
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,025
The hours I've wasted,

184
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:51,989
trying to instil the principles
of algebra and geometry

185
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:53,746
into that muddled little head!

186
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:58,001
Ah, we ladies, the higher studies
are not for us, I think!

187
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:00,049
We have a different kind
of wisdom, you know?

188
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:03,041
And what might that be?

189
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,049
If you don't know, Prince,
far be it for me to tell you!

190
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:14,057
I see you were entertaining your
idiotic pilgrims again today, Marya.

191
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:16,069
They're good people, Father.

192
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:20,989
They know when they're onto a
good thing, I'll say that for them!

193
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:22,985
How can anyone be so gullible?

194
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:30,048
I know, I know. I see you looking at me.

195
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:32,041
I should treat her more kindly.

196
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:37,017
But she drives me to distraction
with her stupid religiosity...

197
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:41,041
the way she moons about the
house with her eyes full of tears.

198
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,021
What's she got to be mournful about?

199
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:48,009
La Bourienne... now, she
makes the most of herself.

200
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,017
She makes herself agreeable! Eh?

201
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:53,057
If you're asking me...

202
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:55,634
I wouldn't have said it,
but as you ask...

203
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:59,025
I think you treat Marya abominably,

204
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:02,061
when anyone can see how much
she loves you and respects you.

205
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:04,057
And, again, if you ask me,

206
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:07,049
I think that French woman
stirs things up between you.

207
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:09,065
She should never have been
my sister's companion.

208
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,005
She's not worthy.

209
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:15,077
So, that's it! You had
to say it, didn't you?

210
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:18,057
I didn't want to judge, but you did ask.

211
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,077
And, Father, you know that I'm right.

212
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:23,771
How DARE you?

213
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,037
Get out!

214
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:27,993
GET OUT!

215
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,049
I don't want to see
your face any more!

216
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:50,053
Once upon a time, there was
a very great nobleman

217
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,719
and his name was Bluebeard.

218
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:58,045
Now, this nobleman
had a beautiful young wife,

219
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:00,041
but she died,

220
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:04,017
and some people thought
that it was Bluebeard's fault,

221
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:06,005
but didn't dare say so.

222
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:11,065
And then, one day,
Bluebeard thought to himself,

223
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:15,041
"It's about time I got myself
another beautiful, young wife..."

224
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:23,732
Tell the story, Papa, tell it!

225
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,061
Papa!

226
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:29,065
Come here, I'll tell you the story.

227
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:31,053
But I want Papa to tell it!

228
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:35,017
Just come and say goodbye to him.

229
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,989
I will not! Go away!

230
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:40,001
But Andrei's leaving... Think!
You may never see him again!

231
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:42,997
And whose fault is that?
You made me quarrel with him!

232
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:44,053
I blame YOU for this!

233
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:22,065
Andrei, I wish you didn't have to go.

234
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,993
Thank God I can.

235
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:28,017
- It's a shame that you can't.
- Why do you say that?

236
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,061
When you're going
to that dreadful war

237
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:33,061
and Papa's so old that he may not...

238
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,025
Andrei, let me ask you one thing...

239
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,073
don't go with bitterness in your heart.

240
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:44,049
Only forgiveness
will make us truly happy.

241
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:48,017
Forgiveness is a woman's
virtue. I'm not capable of it.

242
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:52,069
When I see Anatole Kuragin again,
I shall challenge him and kill him.

243
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:55,013
And then, perhaps, my
mind will be at peace.

244
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:29,077
I wish you would play again
properly, and sing again.

245
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:33,009
Sometimes I try, but it
feels wrong, you know?

246
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:36,013
As if I've no voice left to sing with.

247
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,001
It will come again.

248
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,013
You've been very ill.
You know, it takes time.

249
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:44,037
- What I did to Andrei...
- He should have forgiven you.

250
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:46,077
To leave you alone for a year
for no good reason...

251
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:49,077
and how could you have known
what sort of man Kuragin is?

252
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:51,985
Natasha, you made one mistake,

253
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:54,021
in a life that's all
been bringing happiness

254
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:56,021
to everyone you know... one mistake!

255
00:17:57,037 --> 00:17:59,045
I mean, look at me.

256
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,009
My life is one mistake after another.

257
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,053
Is that how you see it?

258
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:05,033
How could I see it otherwise?

259
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:09,009
I wanted to change the world
for the better, help my fellow men

260
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:12,049
and look at me... a fat,
drunken aristocrat

261
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,077
who makes a bungle
out of everything.

262
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:17,053
Natasha, I've done nothing
with my life, nothing!

263
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:19,037
You've been very kind to me.

264
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:21,077
And that's only because I...

265
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:23,029
Never mind.

266
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,985
No-one's as kind as you.

267
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:31,808
No-one understands me
as well as you do.

268
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:35,005
If you hadn't have been
there... then, and now...

269
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:37,049
I don't know what would have
happened to me, because...

270
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,001
If you knew how...

271
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,053
No, this is wrong!

272
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,001
What? What's wrong?

273
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:48,997
Natasha, I think...

274
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:53,029
I think it's best if
I don't visit you so often.

275
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:56,021
But why?

276
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:00,017
Because I...

277
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:03,065
Tell me.

278
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:34,013
First, get some stationery...
eight quires.

279
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:38,001
Here's a sample, exactly the same,
get it from Minsky's, nowhere else...

280
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:41,981
and varnish, sealing wax...
It's all on this list.

281
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,009
Give my compliments to
the Governor of Smolensk...

282
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:47,005
But, Papa, the French are
already approaching Smolensk!

283
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:49,077
They're on our doorstep.
Didn't you read Andrei's letter?

284
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:53,013
Nonsense, don't interfere!
Off you go, Tikhon! Off you go.

285
00:19:58,037 --> 00:19:59,981
Tikhon.

286
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,881
Go to the Governor, tell him
my father refuses to leave,

287
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,053
and ask him what can be done for us.

288
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:07,001
For how many days will
we still be safe here?

289
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:09,061
All right, Princess.
I'll see how the land lies.

290
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,049
And come back quickly.

291
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,712
Safe journey!

292
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:17,057
No, no, no, she can't...

293
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:21,041
The French can't be
near Smolensk already.

294
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:24,694
No, no, no, no...

295
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,053
The town is surrendered!

296
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:20,638
Leave! Leave!

297
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,005
Turn it round!

298
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:08,073
Done for! Russia's done for!

299
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:10,989
Go ahead, boys, take the lot!

300
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:13,009
Leave nothing for the French!

301
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:14,989
I'll set the fire myself.

302
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:26,029
Tikhon! What in God's name
are you doing here?

303
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:28,021
The master refused to leave, sir.

304
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,069
Tell him he must!

305
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:32,005
Tell him the French will be
at Bald Hills within days!

306
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:35,029
Do you understand? He MUST
leave now, as must you!

307
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,993
Yes, Your Excellency.

308
00:22:36,993 --> 00:22:38,029
Is everything lost now, then?

309
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,049
Far from it. But, for
now, you have to go!

310
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,981
GO!

311
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,025
- No! No!
- But, Papa, Andrei said...

312
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:59,041
Did he think I would abandon my
home to that accursed Frenchman?

313
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,061
Never!

314
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:02,981
Bald Hills must be defended,
to the last man!

315
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,810
Summon the militia! Give me my jacket.

316
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:08,049
Not that one! The full dress uniform!

317
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:11,077
Papa, the militia aren't here
any more! Everyone's going!

318
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:14,985
They would never dare disobey
me! You go, if you want to.

319
00:23:14,985 --> 00:23:16,065
I'm making my stand here!

320
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:18,045
Tikhon, buckle my sword!

321
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:19,989
Do it!

322
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:21,037
Do it!

323
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:42,021
Grandpa's going to war, isn't he?

324
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,993
Quickly!

325
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,057
Papa!

326
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:07,069
We must carry him to Bogucharovo!

327
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:10,053
We'll be safe there
for a while, at least.

328
00:24:18,045 --> 00:24:20,041
Carry on. I'm going to take a detour.

329
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,017
There's a place ahead where the
men can bathe, if they want to.

330
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:24,293
Very good, Your Excellency.

331
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:43,061
Good day, Master.

332
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:45,001
Where are the family?

333
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,571
All gone away, sir.

334
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:51,005
Thank God for that.

335
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,041
It's all right, Your Excellency,
it's not too cold.

336
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,065
If you fancy it, I
could order this lot out,

337
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:16,057
- you could have it to yourself.
- No, no, let them bathe.

338
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:20,993
So much healthy flesh.

339
00:26:22,603 --> 00:26:24,077
And all of it cannon fodder.

340
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:48,065
May I be of any assistance,
Your Excellency?

341
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:51,037
No, thank you. We're going to
our estate in Bogucharovo.

342
00:26:51,037 --> 00:26:53,065
- It's over there.
- I wouldn't advise it.

343
00:26:53,065 --> 00:26:55,981
The French are only
two days behind us.

344
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,001
Go to Moscow. You'll be safe there.

345
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:41,985
Dear heart...

346
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:46,065
Daughter...

347
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:50,993
My heart aches...

348
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:56,037
Forgive me.

349
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:58,017
Of course I forgive you, Papa.

350
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:04,735
Andryushka...

351
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:08,037
I want to see him.

352
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:14,033
He can't come, Papa.

353
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:16,025
He's away, with the Army.

354
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:21,013
Russia lost...

355
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:25,041
They destroyed her.

356
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:31,005
Pu...

357
00:28:32,073 --> 00:28:34,001
Pu...

358
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:37,017
What is it, dear?

359
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,458
Put on your white dress.

360
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,065
I like it.

361
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,981
Tikhon...

362
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:38,604
Tikhon, I wished for his death...

363
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:43,029
I prayed for it, and all
the while, he loved me!

364
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:49,033
He loved me...

365
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:31,057
As soon as we've buried my father,
we must all leave for Moscow.

366
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:33,989
Are you sure this is
the best? If we stayed,

367
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:37,033
I am sure we would be very
well-treated by the French officers.

368
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:40,009
I won't stay to see the
enemy in my father's house.

369
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:42,049
- If you please, Your Excellency?
- Yes, what?

370
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,989
The peasants are making
difficulties about the horses.

371
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:48,057
You see? They know they, too, will
be well-treated by my countrymen.

372
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:51,045
The French will put us
under their protection.

373
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:52,507
Truly, Princess, it will be for

374
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:54,017
- the best...
- I would rather die

375
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:56,001
than beg my enemy to protect me.

376
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:58,041
It would be an insult
to my father's memory.

377
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:00,069
Tikhon, I am sure this must
be a misunderstanding...

378
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:03,009
send Dron the Head Man
to me, please. Immediately.

379
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:05,025
They're waiting outside,
Your Excellency.

380
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:25,041
Dronushka, what is this?

381
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:28,005
Now, after our misfortune?

382
00:31:28,005 --> 00:31:29,989
We all walk under God, Princess.

383
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:33,049
I need to leave, this evening, or
tomorrow morning at the latest.

384
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:36,057
Can you have the horses
ready and the carts loaded?

385
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:38,069
There are no horses, Princess.

386
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:41,053
Of course there are horses!
What are you talking about?

387
00:31:41,053 --> 00:31:43,045
It's God's punishment, Princess.

388
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:46,009
Most of the horses were
taken for the Army,

389
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:47,997
and, as for the rest of them,

390
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:50,013
there's nothing left to feed them with.

391
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,466
Lies!

392
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:54,068
What it is, Your Excellency,
they've got it into their heads

393
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:57,009
that they'd be better off
waiting for the French.

394
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:58,065
You haven't understood.

395
00:31:58,065 --> 00:32:01,025
You have my word that
you will be housed and fed

396
00:32:01,025 --> 00:32:02,993
at our estate near Moscow.

397
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:05,049
If you stay, the enemy will destroy you.

398
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,989
The French will set us
free and give us land!

399
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:09,057
What have you ever done for us?

400
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:11,981
How can you say that?!

401
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:15,037
You wouldn't dare to if my father
were alive or my brother were here.

402
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:18,021
Now, I order you to have the
horses ready for departure!

403
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:35,985
Beautiful country... we should
find plenty of fodder here.

404
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:38,065
We need to secure it
before the French get to it.

405
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:40,993
And a few pretty girls?

406
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,029
Mine's the little one in front.

407
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:46,029
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- What can we do for you, sweet-face?

408
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:48,985
My mistress wishes to know
your name and your regiment,

409
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:51,745
if you please, and if you would
come to the house and speak to her.

410
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:55,009
Certainly. I'm Lieutenant Ilyin
of the Pavlograd Hussars

411
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:57,041
and this is Count Rostov,
our squadron commander.

412
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,450
And we will be delighted
to speak with your mistress...

413
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:01,009
might we know her name?

414
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:03,214
She is the Princess Marya Nikolayevna

415
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,013
Bolkonskaya, Your Excellency.

416
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:07,065
Her father, the Prince, died yesterday,

417
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:10,985
and the peasants have been taking
advantage of the situation.

418
00:33:10,985 --> 00:33:13,591
I am sorry to hear of it.
Please show us the way.

419
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,013
I am ashamed to have to beg
for your assistance, sir.

420
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:29,073
Not at all, Princess.
This is an outrage,

421
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,985
and I am only too happy
to be able to assist you.

422
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:35,760
It will be both a pleasure and an
honour to escort you away from here

423
00:33:35,761 --> 00:33:38,985
and I promise you, no-one will
dare cause you any trouble.

424
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:47,057
Thank you, Count Rostov.

425
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:23,073
My dear Prince, can it be true?

426
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:25,033
Smolensk in flames,

427
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:28,013
and Napoleon advancing on Moscow?

428
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:31,021
Oh, our army will stop him
well before Moscow,

429
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:35,009
and you know, Moscow is
a long way from Petersburg.

430
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:39,013
But if it comes to the worst,
what is to happen to us?

431
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,017
Are we all to be guillotined?

432
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:43,997
No, no, no, dear lady,
Napoleon is magnanimous.

433
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:47,981
I suppose, we shall all have to
brush up our French again, though.

434
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:52,053
Ah, Bilibin! Interesting
times we live in.

435
00:34:52,053 --> 00:34:54,077
The lovely Helene
not here this evening?

436
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:58,013
Ah, no... she had to
accept another invitation.

437
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:09,013
Two lovers, one absent husband,

438
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:11,993
and she's in a delicate condition.

439
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:16,065
Of course, the child
is not Bezukhov's.

440
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:20,009
I'm sure she'll sort it out.

441
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:25,997
Marry me...

442
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:30,009
... and I'd be yours and yours alone.

443
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:33,041
That's impossible... isn't it?

444
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:36,005
- Aren't you still marriedto Bezukhov?
- No!

445
00:35:36,005 --> 00:35:37,993
Well, only in name.

446
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:40,049
You see, we've...

447
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,997
He's never...

448
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:46,993
I can't say it in modesty...

449
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:48,033
You're saying...

450
00:35:49,993 --> 00:35:51,061
... it could be annulled?

451
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:53,069
Why not?

452
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:56,985
I'm sure if I write to Pierre,
he'll do anything I asked.

453
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:58,981
He's such an obliging soul.

454
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:05,077
You do want to marry me, don't you?

455
00:36:05,077 --> 00:36:07,041
Well...

456
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,025
Yes, of course!

457
00:36:12,993 --> 00:36:14,981
Then I'll write to Pierre directly.

458
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,053
You're still wasting your time,

459
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,981
turning over cards like a little boy?

460
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,061
I'm trying to determine
my fate, Catiche.

461
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:36,013
Someone told me that you
were going to the war.

462
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:38,021
Yes, I'm considering it.

463
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,985
You?

464
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:41,989
You know nothing about war.

465
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:48,025
Then perhaps it's time I found out.

466
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:56,029
'My dear mother and father,

467
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:59,005
'I hope you are making
plans to leave Moscow.

468
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:01,997
'Otradnoye will be
much safer for you.

469
00:37:01,997 --> 00:37:06,009
'As for myself, you will be happy
to hear that I am well and safe.

470
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:08,989
'The Pavlograd Hussars
have been held in reserve,

471
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:12,021
'so I have been buying
new horses for the regiment.

472

'We're in a beautiful
part of the country.

473
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:18,049
'No-one would think
that we were at war.'

474

able to be of service

- Ah!

00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:32,053
"I was happy to escort the
Princess for part of her journey

479
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:34,069
"to a place of greater safety.

480
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:37,989
"She was very grateful,
as you can imagine..."

481
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,053
There's a bit crossed
out there, can't read it.

482
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:45,053
"... and asked me to send her
warmest good wishes to you all."

483
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:46,073
Well!

484
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:48,057
If something should come of that,

485
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,037
it could solve all our problems.

486
00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:53,053
'I will soon be arriving in Voronezh,
where I have been invited

487
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:56,017
'to spend the evening with
the Governor and his wife.

488
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:58,053
'I understand they're
old friends of yours,

489
00:37:58,053 --> 00:38:01,049
'so I am very much looking
forward to meeting them.'

490
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,045
Ah, here they are,
the men of the moment!

491
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:09,033
You are welcome, gentlemen!
Please... take a drink.

492
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,053
Thank you.

493
00:38:16,037 --> 00:38:18,686
Rich pickings.

494
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:23,077
It is such a pleasure
to meet you at last.

495
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:25,053
A pleasure for me, too.

496
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,057
We heard of your rescue
of Princess Marya.

497
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:31,053
Ah! Well, it was fortunate
that I was passing.

498
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:34,029
You made a great impression
upon the Princess.

499
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:35,937
Did you know that she's here in

500
00:38:35,962 --> 00:38:38,028
- Voronezh, with her aunt?
- Really?

501
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:40,025
Yes, she is.

502
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:43,001
And, of course, you will call
upon her tomorrow morning,

503
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,985
to pay your respects.

504
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:47,005
I should be very pleased
to see her again.

505
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:49,001
You know, it's just the match for you.

506
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:51,045
Would you like me to arrange it?

507
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:52,993
If only it were that simple.

508
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:02,061
He's here!

509
00:39:18,057 --> 00:39:20,045
Count Rostov.

510
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,005
Princess.

511
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:27,013
I was so happy to hear
you were in Voronezh.

512
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:29,101
It really does seem
like fate, doesn't it?

513
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:31,005
Yes, it does.

514
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:33,687
I hope your family are well.

515
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:36,069
Yes, very well... that is to say,
my sister was quite ill,

516
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:38,049
but I believe she's recovering now.

517
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:39,989
Oh, I hope so.

518
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:42,009
I liked her very much
when I met her,

519
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:43,985
and I hope to see more of her.

520
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:45,025
I hope you do.

521
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,993
Strange how things turn
out sometimes, isn't it?

522
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:54,013
Yes, it is.

523
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:27,724
Ah, Prince Andrei!

524
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:30,037
Welcome back, Your Grace.

525
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,849
I'm delighted to be under

526
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:35,064
- your command again.
- Good lad!

527
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:38,037
I'm very glad to see you.

528
00:40:38,037 --> 00:40:39,672
How is your father?

529
00:40:41,017 --> 00:40:43,061
I learned of his death
only yesterday.

530
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:46,069
Oh! I'm so, so sorry to hear that.

531
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,637
I loved and respected him.

532
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:52,009
He was a great soldier in his day.

533
00:40:55,013 --> 00:40:56,053
Well, well.

534
00:40:58,013 --> 00:41:00,566
So, you'll be at my side on the day?

535
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:04,005
I thank you for the honour,
but I request permission

536
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:06,462
to be allowed to fight on the
front line with my regiment.

537
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:08,029
It'll be bloody.

538
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:10,009
But you don't need
me to tell you that.

539
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:14,981
I expect to lose 200,000 men.

540
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:17,045
God-willing, he'll lose more.

541
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:19,057
He thinks he's invincible.

542
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:21,017
He'll find he's not.

543
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:24,989
We're fighting on our own soil now.

544
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:29,825
We can't give him a clear run
to Moscow, not without a fight.

545
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:31,981
So...

546
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:35,005
... it has to be here.

547
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:38,065
We'll stop him here...

548
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:40,029
at Borodino.

549
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:42,985
Good.

550
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:45,985
Good luck, my boy.

551
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,989
I hope we meet again.

552
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:15,069
Excuse me, sir...
what's this place called?

553
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:17,077
Bordino... No, Borodino.

554
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,041
And are all these ours?

555
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:21,989
That's right... and
over there, the French.

556
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:24,981
Look! There. You can
see their fires on the hill.

557
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:27,728
And you are, sir? What, a doctor?

558
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,077
No, no...

559
00:42:29,077 --> 00:42:33,005
Um... I'm just here
to see what's going on.

560
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:23,029
Count Bezukhov!

561
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:26,017
Dolokhov.

562
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,659
I am so glad I saw you, old friend.

563
00:43:34,985 --> 00:43:38,029
God knows whether either of us
will be alive after tomorrow.

564
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:41,989
I am very sorry we fell out.

565
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:44,985
I wronged you, Petrushka,

566
00:43:44,985 --> 00:43:46,507
and I beg your forgiveness.

567
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,005
Who is that fool?

568
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:17,037
- Hey, watch yourself!
- I do beg your pardon.

569
00:44:17,037 --> 00:44:19,049
I'm looking for Prince Bolkonsky.

570
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:20,989
He's that way.

571
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,001
Pierre?

572
00:44:28,005 --> 00:44:29,463
What in hell's name
are you doing here?

573
00:44:29,488 --> 00:44:31,024
Looking for you!

574
00:44:31,025 --> 00:44:33,981
And I thought I would see if
there was anything I could do,

575
00:44:33,981 --> 00:44:35,985
for Russia and so on...

576
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:37,049
For God's sake, Pierre...

577
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,985
we're about to fight
the bloodiest battle yet...

578
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:41,605
I have to look after you now?

579
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:46,069
You just turn around
and go straight home,

580
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:49,985
- while you still have the chance...
- No, no! I'm here now.

581
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:53,005
It's all right... I promise
I won't get in your way.

582
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:58,005
Very well.

583
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:01,033
Come on, then.

584
00:45:09,077 --> 00:45:11,709
So, you think we'll win tomorrow?

585
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:14,993
I think we'll hold them to a standstill,

586
00:45:14,993 --> 00:45:16,053
which is as good as winning.

587
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:18,021
I sense it in our men.

588
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:21,021
They're ready to die this
time, they won't run away.

589
00:45:23,073 --> 00:45:24,997
It won't be pretty.

590
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:29,001
Really, you should go back to Moscow.

591
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:32,061
No, no, not now I've come all this way.

592
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:34,069
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

593
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:36,596
- You're not afraid?
- No!

594
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:41,021
No, why should I be?
If death comes, it comes.

595
00:45:42,985 --> 00:45:45,009
What do I have to lose?

596
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,049
I feel very much the
same, my friend.

597
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,005
I spoke to Natasha
just before I came here.

598
00:45:52,005 --> 00:45:54,985
She still loves you, Andrei,
and she longs for your forgiveness.

599
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,029
That's all over now,

600
00:45:56,029 --> 00:45:58,053
and I thought we'd agreed
we'd never speak of it.

601
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:16,029
I went back to Bald Hills.

602
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:18,997
I was walking through the orchard.

603
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:22,077
There were a couple of
peasant girls there, very young,

604
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:25,065
picking the plums and eating them.

605
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:28,057
They thought they were
doing something naughty.

606
00:46:28,057 --> 00:46:31,532
When they saw me,
they ran away laughing.

607
00:46:32,077 --> 00:46:35,049
I wanted to tell them, "It's all
right... take as many as you like."

608
00:46:38,013 --> 00:46:41,005
They were picking up their
skirts as they ran away.

609
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:43,553
I could see their little feet...

610
00:46:44,061 --> 00:46:45,993
... flashing white.

611
00:46:53,073 --> 00:46:55,053
It was her soul I loved.

612
00:46:57,001 --> 00:46:58,768
Was it all an illusion?

613
00:47:05,017 --> 00:47:06,069
You know, one time,

614
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:11,053
she was trying to tell me about
some old man she met in the forest,

615
00:47:11,053 --> 00:47:13,807
who'd been very kind to her.

616
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:17,057
She was trying to find
the right words to tell it...

617
00:47:17,057 --> 00:47:19,680
how special the moment had been.

618
00:47:21,997 --> 00:47:24,997
She couldn't find the words,
but it didn't matter.

619
00:47:26,989 --> 00:47:28,562
It was in her eyes, Pierre.

620
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:30,073
I know.

621
00:47:30,073 --> 00:47:32,077
- It was her soul I loved...
- I know.

622
00:47:32,077 --> 00:47:34,029
... and that animal, Kuragin...

623
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:38,021
... all he saw in her was a piece
of sweet flesh to feed on.

624
00:47:39,029 --> 00:47:41,025
Well, it's all over
and done with, now.

625
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,045
- No, it doesn't have to be.
- Enough. Time to sleep.

626
00:47:44,045 --> 00:47:46,053
You need to be fresh
in the morning and so do I.

627
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:48,005
- Andrei...
- Enough!

628
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,077
Warriors!

629
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:07,049
Here, at last, is the
battle you longed for!

630
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:11,985
Act as you acted at Austerlitz
and victory is assured!

631
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:15,985
"Posterity will remember you

632
00:48:15,985 --> 00:48:18,069
"as the heroes who fought and won

633
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:21,033
"in the great battle of Borodino!"

634
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:24,017
Vive l'Empereur!

635
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:25,061
What?

636
00:48:27,021 --> 00:48:29,989
- What's happened? Has it begun?
- Yes, if you please.

637
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:32,811
My master left a horse for you...
all the gentlemen have gone,

638
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:34,073
and General Kutuzov
left an hour ago.

639
00:48:34,073 --> 00:48:36,013
Why didn't you wake me?

640
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,993
My master said to let
you sleep, Your Excellency.

641
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,073
Excuse me...

642
00:48:44,073 --> 00:48:46,001
I beg your pardon.

643
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:52,013
Excuse me, excuse me...

644
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,029
I beg your pardon.

645
00:49:18,981 --> 00:49:20,009
Who's that?

646
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:21,049
You, sir!

647
00:49:22,077 --> 00:49:25,017
Count Bezukhov, at your
service, Your Grace.

648
00:49:25,017 --> 00:49:28,057
Anything I can do to help... I should
like to get in the thick of it!

649
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:30,867
Oh! Would you now?

650
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:34,582
All right, show him the way.

651
00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:38,997
God be with you, my boy.

652
00:49:38,997 --> 00:49:40,021
Follow me.

653
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:05,989
Sir, you shouldn't be here...
it's too dangerous!

654
00:50:05,989 --> 00:50:08,001
It's all right. I won't get in the way.

655
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:10,053
Let me know if there's
anything I can do.

656
00:50:13,073 --> 00:50:16,033
Are you not scared, Master?

657
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:17,916
No, I don't seem to be... are you?

658
00:50:18,053 --> 00:50:19,996
When you could have your guts
spilled at any minute?

659
00:50:19,997 --> 00:50:21,045
Of course I'm scared!

660
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:52,025
- We're getting cut to pieces!
- Nothing to do but endure.

661
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:57,029
Courage, lads!

662
00:51:10,017 --> 00:51:14,985
Colonel, it is my duty to report...
only eight charges left.

663
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:16,033
Do we continue firing?

664
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:18,001
Yes, of course.

665
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:20,053
You - run to the ammunition 
cart, get the reserves!

666
00:51:20,053 --> 00:51:21,993
I'll go! I'm strong.

667
00:51:21,993 --> 00:51:24,073
- This is no place for you, Master.
- No, no, I'll help you carry them.

668
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:42,849
Here they are, Master!

669
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:56,025
Sir, the ammunition
boxes got blown up!

670
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:04,045
Help me, brother! Help me!

671
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:39,029
Sire, Marshal Murat's compliments.

672
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:41,037
Reinforcements are necessary!

673
00:53:41,037 --> 00:53:43,073
Reinforcements?
We're only two to one!

674
00:53:43,073 --> 00:53:47,025
Marshal Murat says one more 
division would finish the job.

675
00:53:47,025 --> 00:53:51,009
Sire, the Russians are attacking
our left flank! We can't hold them!

676
00:53:51,009 --> 00:53:53,049
- Sire... the Imperial Guard? 
- No.

677
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:56,053
I'm not going to risk losing
the Imperial Guard in this shambles.

678
00:53:56,053 --> 00:53:58,069
Order the army to
withdraw and regroup.

679
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:01,033
Meanwhile, keep up
with the bombardment.

680
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:03,069
There's more than
one way to skin a cat.

681
00:54:15,045 --> 00:54:16,069
Look at that dog!

682
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:20,001
The things you see in a war.

683
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:21,073
Look out!

684
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:24,989
Get down, sir!

685
00:54:25,065 --> 00:54:26,989
Get down, sir!

686
00:54:26,989 --> 00:54:28,005
Get down!

687
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:04,073
All right, Your Excellency.

688
00:55:04,073 --> 00:55:07,021
It's a bad one, but we'll do our best.

689
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:21,053
Show it to me...

690
00:55:21,053 --> 00:55:23,017
There you are, sir.

691
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,009
Anatole?

692
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:29,065
Anatole.

693
00:55:29,065 --> 00:55:31,005
Kuragin.

694
00:55:31,005 --> 00:55:32,989
Bolkonsky.

695
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:35,592
Bolkonsky, have pity.

696
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:38,017
Look what they've done to me!

697
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,001
Gentlemen, we have 
endured everything

698
00:56:57,001 --> 00:56:59,766
the enemy could throw at us
and have driven them off.

699
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:05,041
Napoleon has suffered a mortal 
wound from which he will not recover.

700
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:09,001
The spirit of his army has been broken.

701
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:10,033
And now?

702
00:57:11,061 --> 00:57:12,993
Do we go on the offensive?

703
00:57:15,037 --> 00:57:17,049
No.

704
00:57:17,049 --> 00:57:18,989
We retreat.

705
00:57:19,993 --> 00:57:22,065
We lost half our army at Borodino.

706
00:57:22,065 --> 00:57:24,993
Let us not lose the other half.

707
00:57:24,993 --> 00:57:26,057
Abandon Moscow?

708
00:57:27,073 --> 00:57:30,576
Abandon Russia's sacred 
capital without a fight?

709
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:42,105
