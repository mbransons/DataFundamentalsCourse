00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,752
Giddyup! Hyah!

4
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:57,324
Let us praise the Lord

5
00:03:57,424 --> 00:04:00,994
who sendeth so generously
of His bounty to our table.

6
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:04,206
Let us show unto Him our thanks
by devoting our every thought

7
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:07,751
and every waking moment
to the contemplation of His goodness

8
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:10,670
and to the resolute pursuit
or our moral duty.

9
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,088
Amen.

10
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:14,758
Then we may consider the matter
agreed, Master Starling.

11
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,176
Yes, Master Goodgroome.

12
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:19,596
This will be a good marriage,
all things considered.

13
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:21,556
It's high time
my ward settled down

14
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:23,992
to the duties of being
a wife and mother.

15
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:28,204
And you, Amber, have you
nothing to say for yourself?

16
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:39,424
Well, speak up, my girl.

17
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:43,094
I won't marry him.

18
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,207
Amber.

19
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,668
What did you say, girl?

20
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:51,253
I'll never marry him,

21
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:54,756
nor any other farmer
you try to force on me.

22
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:58,777
Do you think I want to spend
the rest of my life in a pigsty?

23
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,740
Go to your room at once.

24
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,734
I owe you my apologies,
Master Starling.

25
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:16,753
And you, Robert.

26
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:19,339
Matt.

27
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,158
The girl's only out of humor.

28
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:25,245
I've borne enough of her humors
and her sinful pride.

29
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:27,330
Her vain ways have been
a village scandal

30
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,207
ever since she learned to walk.

31
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:31,710
I've raised the vixen
as my own daughter,

32
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,420
and, like my own daughter,
she'll behave,

33
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,756
if it means the skin
off her back entire.

34
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:39,234
No whip, Matt.
Please.

35
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:42,387
All right, no whip,

36
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:44,472
but she'll have to learn
once and for all

37
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:48,018
that vanity is Satan
at work in the female soul.

38
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:50,437
I've stood the last of her nonsense.

39
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:53,665
She'll marry Bob Starling,
and that's the end of it.

40
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:44,050
My services, sir.
Is there an inn hereabouts?

41
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,719
I need assistance
for a wounded man

42
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,345
and lodging for the night.

43
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,489
There's an inn down the road.

44
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,292
Hurry, wench, hurry.
The gentlemen are waiting.

45
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:20,812
Bid them be patient.
Supper will be served soon.

46
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:23,423
Mistress Poterell.

47
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:25,133
What are you doing
here, child?

48
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,719
I came to help.
I knew you'd be busy.

49
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,095
Bless you. You can help.

50
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:30,764
Take this wine
in to the gentlemen.

51
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:33,241
Yes, Mistress Poterell.

52
00:08:54,137 --> 00:08:56,723
We aren't
used to gentlemen like you.

53
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:00,919
My arm.

54
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,295
Out of the way, wench.

55
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:03,588
Put him here by the fire.

56
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:05,089
You'll be comfortable there.

57
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:06,174
That's it.

58
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:08,885
Not so fast, sweetheart.
I'm thirsty.

59
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:10,970
Been out of the country so long

60
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,056
that even these Puritan
wenches seem tempting.

61
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:14,866
Yes, bless my eyes.

62
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:19,896
Your pardon, sir.

63
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,357
We're still two days'
hard riding from London,

64
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,151
thanks to that cursed
ambush this afternoon.

65
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:27,529
We should be
in our saddles by sunrise.

66
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:30,573
When you're fed, gentlemen,
get some sleep.

67
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:31,616
Right, Bruce.

68
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,034
Good night, Bruce.

69
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:37,121
Well, that's more
what nature had in mind.

70
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:40,834
I'll buy a cup of your wine
for a kiss.

71
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,377
Thank you, sir.

72
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:45,338
Have these Puritan devils
corrupted our Englishwomen

73
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:47,298
with their inhuman ideas?

74
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:48,800
- Thank you, my dear.
- My lord—

75
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,426
Come, now, sweetheart,
be reasonable.

76
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:53,304
- You're for London to join the king?
- We're for London.

77
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:55,723
- May I ride with you?
- Ride with us?

78
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:57,725
- There's a sound notion.
- Harry, no.

79
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:59,769
Bruce, where's
the harm in it?

80
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:02,730
A new face would liven up
our journey, and such a face.

81
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,774
Can't I get it
into your iron skull

82
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:07,151
that our fortunes depend
on our getting to London

83
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:08,820
before the spoils are divided?

84
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,947
Bruce, one little girl.

85
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:12,490
Time enough for wenching

86
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,285
when we've made
our settlement with the king.

87
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:18,329
Well, you heard what
he said, sweetheart.

88
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:19,831
Who is he?

89
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:21,749
My Lord Carlton.

90
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:23,376
My name's Almsbury,

91
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:24,919
Sir Harry Almsbury
of Prince Rupert's horse.

92
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,296
You may have heard of us.

93
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:28,423
The battles of Marston Moor
and Raseby.

94
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:30,133
He must be very rich.

95
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,926
Poor as a parson's pig,
like all of us.

96
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,803
Sit on my knee, and I'll
tell you all about myself.

97
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:36,347
Better still,
take me to the stables.

98
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:38,725
I have to see to my horse.

99
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,393
The stables are close
behind the inn, sir.

100
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:41,978
You can't miss them.

101
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:43,980
I'm sure I can't, not
if you show me the way.

102
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,357
He will be rich
if he fought for the king.

103
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:48,776
Perhaps. Kings
have short memories.

104
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:53,114
Who cares? Myself, I prefer
the more simple pleasures in life,

105
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:54,782
such as a pretty face,

106
00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:57,035
a figure molded to
a gentleman's taste,

107
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:59,370
a little walk
in the moonlight.

108
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,723
Your pardon, sir.
I have work to do.

109
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,438
Ah, food.

110
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:15,113
What is it?

111
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,698
Your pardon, my lord,

112
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:20,218
but the wounded gentleman—
he's asking for water.

113
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:28,251
He's fast asleep.

114
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,878
Perhaps he called out
in a dream.

115
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:33,006
Why did you wake me?

116
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:35,717
- Please take me to London.
- I told you, I won't.

117
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:38,803
I'll work for you— I'll wash your clothes,
clean your boots, anything.

118
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:40,179
For the last time, no!

119
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,806
Carlton!

120
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:45,034
Carlton,
give me some water.

121
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,817
How do you feel, Jack?

122
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:56,821
- My arm burns like fire.
- Let's have a look at it.

123
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:59,090
Bring the light over here.

124
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:05,288
You're a very lucky man, Jack.

125
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:07,707
A fanatic takes a shot at you,

126
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:09,692
and you've earned
yourself a pension

127
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:11,769
from our most generous
sovereign.

128
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:14,047
Now, I— I've nothing

129
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:15,840
but a couple
of old flea bites to show

130
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,675
for my long
and loyal service.

131
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:20,203
What's a flea bite to a king?

132
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:22,664
Although he was
no stranger to them

133
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:26,671
when he was hiding
his royal carcass in France.

134
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:29,954
Stopped bleeding.

135
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:35,401
You'll stay here till
you're fit to ride, Jack.

136
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:37,687
When you reach London,

137
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:41,424
ask for me at the Saracen's Head
near St. Sepulchre's.

138
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,111
There.

139
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,554
Thanks, Carlton.

140
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:53,102
Sleep well, Jack.

141
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:59,008
My lord. My lord, I—

142
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,512
No, I won't take you
with me.

143
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:03,596
But—

144
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:05,890
Why have you got such
an itch to see London?

145
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,643
They'll make me suffer
the rest of my life if I stay here.

146
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:11,229
They've heard me say
that it's a blessing

147
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:14,023
for England to have a Stuart
back on the throne.

148
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:17,443
I wish I could be so sure
of the blessing.

149
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:19,278
Didn't you fight for him?

150
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:22,365
I fought for Bruce Carlton.
I'm going to see the king

151
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:24,617
to collect what's due
to the same Bruce Carlton

152
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:26,744
and to the men
who fought with him.

153
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:29,288
I've always wanted
to meet a gentleman.

154
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:32,250
And now that you have,
my dear, good night.

155
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,753
I've had little enough sleep
since we landed on English soil.

156
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:37,255
One more question.

157
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:38,631
Well?

158
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:43,094
Why didn't you try to kiss me
as the others did?

159
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:46,222
Well, perhaps
I didn't feel like it.

160
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:48,266
What sort of gentleman
are you?

161
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:51,811
Faith, I've often been
called on to explain a kiss,

162
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:53,829
but never before
the lack of one.

163
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,375
Here. Let me repair
the omission.

164
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:04,799
Thank you, my lord.

165
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,963
Is my Lord Rossmore
here?

166
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:46,449
Sir Thomas.

167
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:48,618
His Majesty will be
pleased to see you now.

168
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:50,052
Thank you.

169
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:52,830
Lady Ann.

170
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,724
Sir Thomas.

171
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:58,252
How does it seem today?

172
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,338
We were here yesterday,
you'll recall.

173
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:02,256
Let me see. You are...

174
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,300
Baron Carlton,
as you well know,

175
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,676
and Sir Harry Almsbury.

176
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:07,637
Both of
Prince Rupert's horse.

177
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:09,055
Oh, yes, of course.

178
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:10,681
His Majesty's apologies,
gentlemen,

179
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:13,684
but he'll be unable
to grant you an audience today.

180
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:15,311
But we've been
here since—

181
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,854
Tomorrow?

182
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:19,065
I fear that will be impossible,
too, my lord.

183
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:20,149
The next day?

184
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:21,484
I'm afraid not,
my lord.

185
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:22,735
When?

186
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:24,570
- Next month, perhaps.
- Next month?

187
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,573
You'll understand that
His Majesty's calendar is very full.

188
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:30,284
More so than his memory,
I gather.

189
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:34,288
I'm certain I can't have heard
your lordship aright.

190
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:35,848
Your pardon, gentlemen.

191
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:47,134
Charles can't have
changed so quickly.

192
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:49,362
It's an old Stuart custom.

193
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:58,162
Why, Barbara.

194
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:07,280
Isn't that the girl,
um, what's her name?

195
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,406
Barbara Palmer.

196
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:10,491
You met her with me
in Brussels two years ago.

197
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,827
I remember. I must say
her attitude towards you

198
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:14,745
seems to have changed
considerably.

199
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:16,414
We parted rather abruptly.

200
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:18,249
It was one of those
misunderstandings.

201
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,167
Look at the wench,
will you?

202
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:23,170
She doesn't wait to be
announced or anything.

203
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,258
Apparently, she's found an easier
road to royal favor than we have.

204
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:29,427
You know, Bruce,
for the sake of our fortunes,

205
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:33,155
see what you can do to clear up
that misunderstanding.

206
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:53,576
I think, Bruce, we'd better
keep it to ourselves

207
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:55,202
that the king
wouldn't see us.

208
00:17:55,302 --> 00:17:58,848
We had, indeed. It might have
a serious effect on our credit.

209
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,918
Your servant,
my lord.

210
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:05,212
Ah, there you are,
my good Gumble.

211
00:18:05,312 --> 00:18:07,548
Will you join the lady,
or have you already eaten?

212
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:09,842
What lady?
Where are you taking that?

213
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:12,678
Your cousin, sir, Mistress St. Clare.
She arrived while you were out.

214
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:14,472
Dressed like a country lass.

215
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:18,409
Poor lady, having to hide from
the Roundheads all these years.

216
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:24,732
Well, strike me blind!

217
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:26,275
What are you doing here?

218
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,235
Where shall I
put the tray, sir?

219
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:31,572
Anywhere on the table.
What is that?

220
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:34,241
Your lordship will understand
that I have no rooms, sir.

221
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:36,577
The whole of England seems
to have come to London,

222
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:41,499
so Mistress St. Clare suggested
I put a cot in here.

223
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,708
Will that be all, sir?

224
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:45,186
Yes, yes. That'll be all.

225
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:47,938
Thank you, my lord.

226
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:53,594
Well... cousin?

227
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:56,180
Well, I had to say
something, my lord,

228
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,182
else he would never
have let me in.

229
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,850
Who brought you here?

230
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,562
I came by myself. I heard you
say where you'd be staying.

231
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:08,067
Harry, see if we can find
a man and two horses

232
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,735
to take her back.

233
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:14,740
Whatever you say, Bruce, but why
not give it some thought overnight?

234
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,467
I'll see what I can arrange.

235
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:20,955
Oh, please, Bruce.

236
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:23,207
I can't go back.

237
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:25,209
You know they'll force me
into marriage.

238
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:29,672
I never heard that a steady husband
was such a bad thing for a girl.

239
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:32,091
And for you, I think
it's almost a necessity.

240
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:33,926
I'd rather die!

241
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:38,764
Believe me, I'd rather die than live
with Bob Starling and his pigs,

242
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:41,225
keeping his house
and bearing his children

243
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:44,228
and rotting away
in that stinking little village.

244
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:47,690
You can turn me away,
but I won't go back.

245
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,794
I'll stay in London
no matter what happens to me.

246
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,756
Oh, please, Bruce.

247
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:58,742
Let me live here with you.

248
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:02,204
I'll be your servant.
I'll never ask you for anything.

249
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:05,749
You're asking for a great deal
at this very moment.

250
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:08,085
More than I'm worth?

251
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:10,880
That's a very direct
question, my dear,

252
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,883
and deserves
a candid answer.

253
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:17,720
I don't know by what standard
of value you measure yourself,

254
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,848
but it can't match the currency
in which I weigh my freedom.

255
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:23,434
I'll make no claim
on your freedom, Bruce.

256
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:27,271
That's wise of you, but I'm leaving
England soon as soon as I can.

257
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:29,482
You've just got home!

258
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:32,376
Only to get ships from the king
for a privateering venture.

259
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:36,864
Well, then, just let me
stay here till you go.

260
00:20:36,964 --> 00:20:38,782
Please, Bruce?

261
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:40,784
If all I'm asking is...

262
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:44,747
just to be with you
as long as you're here,

263
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:49,251
that wouldn't be too much
of a burden on you, would it?

264
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:53,397
I'm far from regarding your
presence as a burden, my dear.

265
00:20:57,401 --> 00:21:00,471
Well, I found the man
who'll do it.

266
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:02,239
It will cost
a bit of money, but—

267
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:09,413
I'll tell him
you can't afford it.

268
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:16,779
It's a great honor to have
your patronage, my lord.

269
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:19,073
Would you prefer to pay
for your purchases now

270
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:20,824
or at your later convenience?

271
00:21:20,924 --> 00:21:22,468
- Later, I think.
- Bruce.

272
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,333
Is it worth the money?

273
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:32,253
Well, I had my doubts,
but now...

274
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:34,713
You're a beautiful woman,
my dear.

275
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:36,840
Well, wasn't I before?

276
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,218
Uh, no.
You were a pretty wench.

277
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:42,263
The clothes don't make
all the difference.

278
00:21:42,363 --> 00:21:44,348
It's how I feel.

279
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:45,891
Good day.

280
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:48,811
We'll send the other dresses to you
as soon as they're ready, my lord.

281
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:50,954
- Thank you.
- Mistress Abbott.

282
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:04,577
Saracen's Head.

283
00:22:04,677 --> 00:22:06,245
Yes, my lord.

284
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:09,123
I can't wait for Harry
to get a look at you.

285
00:22:09,223 --> 00:22:12,668
Well, I can. Bruce, we haven't had
one moment alone together.

286
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:15,396
Couldn't we do without Harry
just this evening?

287
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,382
Spring Gardens instead.

288
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:20,109
Yes, sir.

289
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:33,247
Amber.

290
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:38,836
Amber?

291
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:08,198
- Good morrow, Harry.
- Good morrow.

292
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:12,353
I hope you'll forgive me.

293
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:14,730
I didn't wait supper
for you last night.

294
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,732
Oh, I wish you'd been with us.

295
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:19,652
We've been to Spring Gardens
and up the river in a boat.

296
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:23,656
And we had breakfast at dawn
at a charming little inn near Chelsea.

297
00:23:23,756 --> 00:23:26,784
And Bruce has promised
to take me to the theater.

298
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:29,703
- You must come, too!
- Yes, you must.

299
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:32,347
You're extremely generous.
Both of you.

300
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:45,736
Harry, look.
There's Stanhope.

301
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,806
Sink me. Who's the wench
with Carlton?

302
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:50,557
I don't know,

303
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:52,826
but he shouldn't be allowed
to keep her to himself.

304
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:56,355
Almsbury, who is she?

305
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:58,232
His cousin.

306
00:23:58,332 --> 00:24:00,818
Well, good luck to your
privateering plans, Carlton.

307
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:02,377
Thank you.

308
00:24:04,296 --> 00:24:05,739
What's privateering?

309
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,826
Oh, taking treasure ships
on the high seas.

310
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:10,285
Oh. Piracy.

311
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:12,246
Not quite.
Pirates get hanged.

312
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:15,849
Privateers share their profits
with the royal treasury.

313
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:18,335
Gemini!

314
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:20,295
Buy my oranges.

315
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:21,380
Oranges.

316
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,340
Well, shall we sit down?

317
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,275
Buy my oranges.

318
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:37,855
Two households,

319
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:40,315
both alike in dignity,

320
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:44,611
in fair Verona,
where we lay our scene,

321
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:47,656
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

322
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:49,116
where civil blood makes...

323
00:24:49,216 --> 00:24:50,826
She's here. Alone.

324
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:53,912
From forth
the fatal loins of these two foes

325
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:56,373
a pair of star-crossed
lovers...

326
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:58,083
So that's
Mistress Palmer.

327
00:24:58,183 --> 00:24:59,835
But I don't see why she's
considered so beautiful.

328
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:00,961
Don't you?

329
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:03,672
She's well enough
if you like her kind.

330
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:05,758
But you'd think His Majesty
could choose someone

331
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:07,426
more fit to be a countess.

332
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:09,136
- Countess?
- Of Castlemaine.

333
00:25:09,236 --> 00:25:11,513
The dressmaker says
it may happen any day now.

334
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:13,348
Curse me,
women are wonderful!

335
00:25:13,448 --> 00:25:15,976
...nought could
remove, is now...

336
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:17,978
Harry, this is my chance.

337
00:25:18,078 --> 00:25:20,063
You watch for the king.

338
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:21,565
Harry, what— what's—

339
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:23,108
We'll wait outside.

340
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:27,696
What here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

341
00:25:27,796 --> 00:25:29,323
Gregory, on my word...

342
00:25:29,423 --> 00:25:32,117
Harry, look!

343
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:35,162
May I join you
for a moment?

344
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:36,388
Very well.

345
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:39,208
- Come on.
- What's he doing up there?

346
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:40,793
It's quite simple,
sweetheart.

347
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:42,669
Bruce wants ships
from the king,

348
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:44,713
and Palmer's the person
to get them for him.

349
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:46,423
Purely a matter
of business.

350
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:49,860
I know what sort of business
a man has with a woman like that.

351
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:56,475
The king!
It's really him!

352
00:25:56,575 --> 00:26:00,312
No, sire, I do
not bite my thumb at you, sir,

353
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:02,773
but I do bite
my thumb, sire.

354
00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:04,775
Ah, Stanhope.

355
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,318
Your Majesty.

356
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:07,778
You stay here.

357
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:09,905
- Where are you going?
- To warn Bruce, you little fool.

358
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:11,532
Bruce only said to watch.

359
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:14,201
Don't you realize what will happen
if Charles finds them in there?

360
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:17,913
Of course.
He won't get his ships.

361
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:20,307
Gregory,
remember thy swashing blows!

362
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:26,438
It's too late now.

363
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,299
Part, fools!

364
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,802
Put up your swords.

365
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:33,946
You know not what you do.

366
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:39,226
Art thou drawn
amongst these heartless hinds?

367
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,645
Turn thee, Benvolio,
look upon thy death.

368
00:26:41,745 --> 00:26:44,064
I do but keep the peace.

369
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:47,317
Put up thy sword or manage it
to part these men with me.

370
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,319
What, drawn,
and talk of peace!

371
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:53,323
I hate the word, as I hate hell,
all Montagues, and thee!

372
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:55,342
Have at thee, coward!

373
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:11,300
As I hate hell,
all Montagues, and thee!

374
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,610
Have at thee, coward!

375
00:27:17,781 --> 00:27:22,269
Of course, there's always a chance
that he might not hang you.

376
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:27,316
He might... merely have
your nose slit or boil you in oil.

377
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,776
Well, that's the end
of my privateering venture.

378
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:30,986
That's certain.

379
00:27:31,086 --> 00:27:33,947
And of my petition to have
my estates restored.

380
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:36,283
Serves me right for ever
entrusting my fortunes

381
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:39,286
to such an arrogant devil
as you are.

382
00:27:39,386 --> 00:27:41,622
You're not entirely
blameless, you know.

383
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:42,889
If you'd warned me in time—

384
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:45,726
Come in.

385
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:48,337
My Lord Carlton?

386
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:49,671
Yes.

387
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:53,258
His Majesty requests your
immediate presence at Whitehall.

388
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:55,485
I'll come at once.

389
00:27:56,945 --> 00:28:00,223
- At 11:00 at night?
- Charles must be in a temper.

390
00:28:00,323 --> 00:28:01,725
I'll come too, Bruce.

391
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:05,270
I may as well hang with you
as starve to death alone.

392
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,732
Oh, Bruce, he won't
really hang you, will he?

393
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:13,236
I doubt it, although...
Charles is inclined to be jealous.

394
00:28:13,336 --> 00:28:17,157
He apparently sets great store
by our redheaded friend.

395
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:19,993
Oh, I hate her.
She's the cause of this trouble.

396
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:23,847
Don't be too modest, sweetheart.
After all, you gave her a little help.

397
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,782
My services,
my lord.

398
00:28:58,882 --> 00:29:00,283
My services,
Sir Thomas.

399
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:02,344
Please come
with me.

400
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,895
I'll wait for you,
Bruce.

401
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:25,492
Come in, Carlton.

402
00:29:27,202 --> 00:29:30,288
You may go, Sir Thomas.
Your cut, my dear.

403
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:44,828
My apologies for
disturbing you at this hour,

404
00:29:44,928 --> 00:29:47,205
but I, uh...

405
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:51,226
You'll be pleased to hear
that in view of your many and...

406
00:29:52,394 --> 00:29:54,421
valuable services
on my behalf,

407
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:56,189
I have, uh...

408
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,801
decided to grant your petition.

409
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,762
You are most
generous, sire.

410
00:30:01,862 --> 00:30:04,056
Od's fish, man,
it's nothing.

411
00:30:04,156 --> 00:30:06,433
And the boldness
of your venture pleases me.

412
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:08,393
Point of 5.

413
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:09,770
Good.

414
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,523
There are two ships in Bristol Harbor,
crown property,

415
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:16,318
which I propose to make
available for your purpose.

416
00:30:16,418 --> 00:30:18,795
Your Majesty
is more than generous.

417
00:30:19,963 --> 00:30:21,298
Quint.

418
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:23,784
Good.

419
00:30:23,884 --> 00:30:26,912
Knowing that you are zealous
to be about this business,

420
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:29,748
I've ordered a coach
to carry you to Bristol tonight.

421
00:30:29,848 --> 00:30:31,391
Tonight?

422
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:38,940
Trio.

423
00:30:41,985 --> 00:30:44,487
Not good.

424
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:47,891
Yes, tonight.

425
00:30:47,991 --> 00:30:49,826
Your lead, my dear.

426
00:30:50,994 --> 00:30:52,687
20 and 1.

427
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:54,689
I believe that your original plan

428
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:56,900
called for a voyage
of six months' duration.

429
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,318
Yes, sire.

430
00:30:58,418 --> 00:31:01,780
I suggest that you prolong it for
as long as the health of your crew

431
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,282
and the safety
of your ships will permit.

432
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:05,784
I understand.

433
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:08,261
And now, good luck
and good hunting.

434
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:11,681
I'm deeply grateful,
sire, but...

435
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:16,294
Well?

436
00:31:16,394 --> 00:31:20,757
I fear I cannot avail myself
of Your Majesty's generosity.

437
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,384
You cannot?

438
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:23,844
I'm under obligation.

439
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:25,762
My petition was not
for myself alone,

440
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:29,850
but also for Sir Harry Almsbury
and the other gentlemen

441
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,810
who fought with me
on Your Majesty's behalf.

442
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,436
Are you making conditions, sir?

443
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:35,939
My honor makes
the conditions, sire.

444
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,568
Surely that would be understood
by the first gentleman of the land.

445
00:31:39,668 --> 00:31:42,904
Pandering to one's honor
can be an expensive vice.

446
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:46,158
- I must take that risk, sire.
- What do they want?

447
00:31:46,258 --> 00:31:49,077
Your equerry
has their petitions.

448
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:50,871
Very well.
They're granted.

449
00:31:50,971 --> 00:31:52,372
Thank you, sire.

450
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:55,892
26 and 15.
That's your trick, my dear.

451
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,854
Bon voyage.

452
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:09,139
No, no, my dear.

453
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:11,308
Never lead
from the ace queen,

454
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:15,370
because then, you see,
the king takes the trick.

455
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:28,425
No.

456
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:31,494
Let her sleep.

457
00:32:31,594 --> 00:32:33,205
Aren't you
going to tell her?

458
00:32:33,305 --> 00:32:36,208
You can tell her in the morning
after I'm gone.

459
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:37,626
Don't you understand?

460
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:39,252
The wench
is in love with you.

461
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:43,798
She's in love with her own ambitions.
I'm only part of them.

462
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:46,276
You're wrong, Bruce.

463
00:32:48,528 --> 00:32:50,805
You always were cold-blooded
about everything.

464
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:52,532
I'll help you pack.

465
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,380
Good morrow,
Amber.

466
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,174
Oh, good morrow.

467
00:33:54,677 --> 00:33:56,288
I...

468
00:33:56,388 --> 00:33:59,791
I must have fallen asleep
waiting for you last night.

469
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:02,252
We thought it best
not to wake you.

470
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:04,212
Bruce threw a blanket
over you while you slept.

471
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:05,922
Are you leaving?

472
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:09,259
Yes. For Almsbury Hall before
the king changes his mind.

473
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,428
Almsbury Hall? Then the king—

474
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:14,055
We found him in
a generous mood last night.

475
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:18,768
I have my estates again,
and Bruce, my dear...

476
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:20,370
Bruce.

477
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:31,406
He's gone.

478
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:33,074
Yes.

479
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:35,785
He only came back here
to fetch his baggage.

480
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:37,787
Have they taken
him to jail?

481
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:40,248
No. The king
sent him to sea.

482
00:34:40,348 --> 00:34:41,958
To sea? But I
don't understand.

483
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:46,296
You can always rely on Charles
to find the devious solution.

484
00:34:46,396 --> 00:34:48,715
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

485
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:50,633
Yes?

486
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:53,345
Your horse is saddled,
Sir Harry.

487
00:34:53,445 --> 00:34:55,221
Thank you.
Take my bags down.

488
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:56,848
Yes, sir.

489
00:34:56,948 --> 00:34:58,641
How could he?

490
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:01,244
How could he, Harry?

491
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:05,982
Without even
saying good-bye.

492
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:07,525
Bruce hates partings.

493
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:10,779
He asked me to make you
his apologies.

494
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:12,989
And he left this for you.

495
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:14,824
There's £200 here.

496
00:35:14,924 --> 00:35:18,286
Enough to pay any bills of yours
he hasn't already settled

497
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:22,207
and enough left over to keep you
until you can find some employment.

498
00:35:22,307 --> 00:35:24,976
Well, I've got a long ride
ahead of me, so...

499
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:33,259
Listen, Amber, I know London,
perhaps better than I should.

500
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,971
The town's aswarm
with rogues and adventurers.

501
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:39,140
It's no place
for a lone woman,

502
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,810
especially one as young
and beautiful as you are

503
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,812
and with your zest for living.

504
00:35:43,912 --> 00:35:46,356
Marygreen lies
close to my road,

505
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:48,108
and I'll be glad
to take you there.

506
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,192
No, Harry.

507
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,360
Oh, be sensible, Amber.

508
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,653
You've got a dowry here

509
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:54,114
will catch you
any farmer in England,

510
00:35:54,214 --> 00:35:56,282
even a country squire
or even a knight.

511
00:35:56,382 --> 00:35:59,177
A pox on your country squires.
I'll wait for him.

512
00:36:00,345 --> 00:36:03,248
You surely don't expect him
to marry you, child.

513
00:36:03,348 --> 00:36:07,419
When a man like Bruce marries,
it'll be for position, wealth, family.

514
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,712
I'll give him those things.

515
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:11,297
If he's above me now,

516
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:14,384
I'll put myself on his level—
higher if I have to.

517
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:17,637
Sweetheart, you can't just climb
from one class to another

518
00:36:17,737 --> 00:36:19,180
as though they're
rungs on a ladder.

519
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,515
What's to stop me?

520
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:23,518
I know what
sort of world this is.

521
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:26,521
I've kept my eyes open
since I came to London.

522
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:29,983
Barbara Palmer wasn't born
countess of castlemaine, was she?

523
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,776
I'm younger than she is.

524
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,820
You said yourself I was beautiful.

525
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,281
I'll get the things he wants—

526
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:39,033
a title, a fortune, all of them.

527
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,743
I'll climb so high,

528
00:36:40,843 --> 00:36:43,872
he'll have to reach up
to touch the hem of my skirt.

529
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:46,833
I still think you're
making a mistake.

530
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:49,127
I'm partly responsible
for what has happened.

531
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:51,379
I'll feel responsible
for what becomes of you.

532
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:53,548
It's a burden I don't
want on my conscience.

533
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:56,776
Go back while you
still have a chance.

534
00:37:02,282 --> 00:37:03,449
Good luck.

535
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:17,447
Good morrow,
Mistress Abbott.

536
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:19,240
Good morrow,
Mistress St. Clare.

537
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,243
I've come to pay you
Lord Carlton's reckoning.

538
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:24,829
Ah, yes. We heard that
his lordship had put to sea.

539
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:26,998
That'll be £18.

540
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:29,834
I trust he provided
for you generously?

541
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:31,294
Oh, yes.

542
00:37:31,394 --> 00:37:33,796
Yes. His lordship
was most generous.

543
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:36,799
He may be away
for some time?

544
00:37:36,899 --> 00:37:38,301
For several months.

545
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:39,802
Good day, madam.

546
00:37:39,902 --> 00:37:41,571
Good day.

547
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:45,725
Listen, my child,

548
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:48,311
I suppose you haven't
many friends in London.

549
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:51,356
Well, I've been here
such a short time.

550
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:54,317
Of course. I've taken a great
fancy to you, my dear.

551
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:56,319
It would give me
pleasure to help you.

552
00:37:56,419 --> 00:37:58,488
- But I need no help.
- To advise you, then.

553
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:00,657
This money that
Lord Carlton left you,

554
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:02,992
you're not carrying it
about with you?

555
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:05,703
- Well...
- It isn't safe, my dear.

556
00:38:05,803 --> 00:38:08,456
The city abounds
in pickpockets and cutpurses.

557
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:11,251
I'm afraid I don't know
what else to do with it.

558
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:13,503
Put it with a goldsmith
at interest.

559
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:15,483
Or better still, invest it
in some safe venture

560
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,673
that'll bring you a profit.

561
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,416
Isn't that so, Mr. Landale?

562
00:38:18,516 --> 00:38:21,719
Mr. Landale is one of
our leading men of business.

563
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:24,722
Mistress Abbott makes too much
of my meager interests.

564
00:38:24,822 --> 00:38:26,432
Still, people have
been kind enough

565
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:29,269
to say I have a certain
shrewdness in these matters.

566
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:32,188
Sow pennies
and reap pounds, eh?

567
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:33,773
I don't understand.

568
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:35,875
Money begets money, my dear.

569
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:38,135
This is an age of expansion.

570
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:41,739
Under the guidance of our wise
and far-seeing king,

571
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,242
English capital has
reached out to other lands,

572
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:48,496
other climes— to the colonies,
the Indies, to Hudson Bay.

573
00:38:48,596 --> 00:38:50,596
Well, I'd prefer to
keep my money here.

574
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,697
But you do keep it here,
my dear child.

575
00:38:52,851 --> 00:38:55,053
It's a matter of finance.

576
00:38:55,353 --> 00:38:58,298
Let us say you have
£1,000, eh?

577
00:38:58,398 --> 00:38:59,757
£200.

578
00:38:59,857 --> 00:39:01,718
Rather a small sum,
to be sure.

579
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:03,720
Still, invested, shall we say,

580
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,431
in American furs
or East Indian spices,

581
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:09,225
in a few months,
it might become £1,000,

582
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:12,103
and that £1,000
in turn 10,000,

583
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:15,189
and that 10,000,
100,000.

584
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:18,276
Indebtedness to sundry,
worthy London merchants

585
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:22,463
in the sum of £86,
5 shillings, and 6 pence.

586
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:27,243
Amber St. Clare,
stand and face the court.

587
00:39:27,343 --> 00:39:29,245
Have you anything to say

588
00:39:29,345 --> 00:39:31,914
before the court
pronounces sentence?

589
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:33,833
Your worship,
I was swindled.

590
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:36,461
That man
and that woman there,

591
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:39,797
they are numbered, I believe,
among your creditors.

592
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:42,216
But they stole my money.

593
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:46,487
What have you to say
to the prisoner's charges?

594
00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:51,100
She's a woman
of unsavory reputation

595
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,144
to whom, out of pity,
I advanced credit.

596
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:55,772
She has since refused
to pay me her just debts.

597
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:57,815
I, too, was deceived
by her, your worship.

598
00:39:57,915 --> 00:39:59,233
It is a weakness, I know,

599
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,277
but we are all loath
to see the evil

600
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:02,987
that lies behind a pretty face.

601
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:04,781
You told me
you were a merchant!

602
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:06,032
Well, you're not.

603
00:40:06,132 --> 00:40:07,784
You're no better
than a common thief!

604
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:09,661
Oh, order there.

605
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:12,330
You will address the court,
if you please.

606
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,873
Your worship,
if you'll but send word

607
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:16,626
to my Lord Carlton—

608
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:19,687
Oh? Where is he?

609
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:23,675
At sea.

610
00:40:23,775 --> 00:40:25,234
At sea?

611
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:33,351
Well, then to
Sir Harry Almsbury

612
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:35,019
at Almsbury Hall.

613
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,856
Oh, and who would pay
the costs of such a message?

614
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:40,650
Committed to Newgate Prison

615
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,736
until such time
as the indebtedness is dispelled.

616
00:40:43,836 --> 00:40:44,862
Next.

617
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:47,490
But, your worship,
I'll never be able to pay my debt...

618
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,550
- Bailiff.
- ...if I'm in prison!

619
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:00,795
Amber. Amber, the blanket.

620
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:03,798
I've only had it 10 minutes.
Wait your turn.

621
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:06,818
It's not for me. It's for Marge.
Her time's come.

622
00:41:10,238 --> 00:41:11,264
Here.

623
00:41:11,364 --> 00:41:14,225
Thank thee. We must
try to keep her warm.

624
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:17,311
Isn't there someplace
she can be taken to?

625
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:19,021
She ought to have a midwife.

626
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:21,874
Such things are only available
to prisoners with money.

627
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,655
She was hoping to carry
that baby another month yet.

628
00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:30,491
Soon as it's born,
they'll hang her.

629
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:31,951
What was her crime?

630
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,787
She stole a piece of cloth
from a mercer's shop, Marge did.

631
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:38,015
Nan. Come along, Nan.
Christmas cheer in the taproom.

632
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,293
Take the lass along, too.

633
00:41:40,393 --> 00:41:44,088
Amber, we're in luck.
Now you'll meet quality.

634
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:46,340
What sort of quality
could there be in this place?

635
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,259
Good enough
for your ladyship.

636
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,303
Mind who you're
talking to.

637
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:52,388
She owes near £100.

638
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:54,407
Well, come on.

639
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:10,798
Swindler! Thief!

640
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:18,681
Hey, Deadeye,
come here.

641
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:21,626
There they are.

642
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:22,877
Your servant,
ladies.

643
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:24,378
Will you step in here

644
00:42:24,478 --> 00:42:26,397
where the gentlemen can
have a look at you?

645
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:34,013
Here's a likely wench.

646
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:36,432
Give me a kiss,
sweetheart.

647
00:42:36,532 --> 00:42:38,951
Let me go.

648
00:42:41,037 --> 00:42:42,855
Gentlemen.

649
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:44,357
Let them go.

650
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:46,025
Gentlemen!

651
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,543
Thank you.

652
00:42:48,753 --> 00:42:51,239
Jack Mallard, madam,
at your service.

653
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:53,616
Black Jack.
The highwayman.

654
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:54,992
Your servant, sir.

655
00:42:55,092 --> 00:42:57,537
May I offer you
a glass of wine?

656
00:42:57,637 --> 00:42:58,704
Deadeye?

657
00:42:58,804 --> 00:43:00,164
At your service, sir.

658
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:03,793
A bottle of your best Madeira
at that table over there.

659
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:06,003
Go on, Amber.

660
00:43:06,103 --> 00:43:08,439
I'll find my own company.

661
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:11,317
Madam.

662
00:43:20,368 --> 00:43:21,978
To our host—

663
00:43:22,078 --> 00:43:23,646
Charles Stuart.

664
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:27,792
May God preserve him
and our beloved land.

665
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:34,615
Finest music in the world,
our English carols.

666
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:37,034
They would sound
more pleasant out there

667
00:43:37,134 --> 00:43:39,036
than they do in here.

668
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:40,413
Faith, so they would.

669
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:44,375
I take it you have a mind
to leave the place?

670
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:45,793
Don't worry.

671
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:49,630
They expect a certain amount
of impatience in their guests.

672
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,841
You know...

673
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:55,595
I could find use for a lass
of quality on the outside.

674
00:43:55,695 --> 00:43:57,013
In my profession,
you understand.

675
00:43:57,113 --> 00:43:59,015
That's fine talk,
Master Mallard,

676
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:02,560
but we're neither of us
on the outside, nor likely to be.

677
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,103
Speak for yourself, madam.

678
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:07,106
I'm spending the winter season here,
you might say,

679
00:44:07,206 --> 00:44:09,525
but when the roads
open up again in the spring,

680
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:12,486
Jack Mallard will be back
at his old trade.

681
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:14,030
You'd break out?

682
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,531
I have friends.

683
00:44:15,631 --> 00:44:17,491
Before my trial comes up,

684
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:20,536
I'll have a passport,

685
00:44:20,636 --> 00:44:24,373
and whoever happens to be keeping
company with me at the time

686
00:44:24,473 --> 00:44:28,185
will get her passport
paid for along with mine.

687
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,049
A wench like you wasn't
born to rot in prison.

688
00:44:33,149 --> 00:44:35,693
What would you
expect of me?

689
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:40,097
That you'd be true to me
and to the trade I teach you.

690
00:44:40,197 --> 00:44:42,642
Is it a bargain?

691
00:44:42,742 --> 00:44:46,854
There's one thing
I'd have to be sure of first.

692
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:48,856
Name it.

693
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:52,777
That you'd take care of me
no matter what happens.

694
00:44:52,877 --> 00:44:54,737
Prison is so unhealthy,

695
00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:57,073
I might not be able
to work right away.

696
00:44:57,173 --> 00:44:58,824
I might need a rest.

697
00:44:58,924 --> 00:45:01,160
Do not worry about that.

698
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,080
You look robust enough to me.

699
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,224
I promise I'll take care of you.
Are we agreed?

700
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:18,427
All you that in
the condemned hole do lie,

701
00:45:18,527 --> 00:45:23,140
prepare you,
for tomorrow you shall die.

702
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,311
And when St. Sepulchre's
bell tomorrow tolls,

703
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:31,373
the Lord have mercy
on your souls.

704
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:37,279
Past 12:00 on
a cold winter's night,

705
00:45:37,379 --> 00:45:40,241
and a merry Christmas
to all.

706
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:41,926
What does it mean?

707
00:45:44,386 --> 00:45:46,789
It means that
tomorrow at sunrise,

708
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:49,792
Sam Russell
and three other brave lads

709
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:52,937
shake hands with Jack Ketch
at Tyburn Tree.

710
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:57,817
Oh, well, it's only fair
to warn you.

711
00:46:01,362 --> 00:46:02,847
See this?

712
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:05,908
Last time they branded me
on the thumb.

713
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:07,827
This time...

714
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:11,831
if I'm so careless
as to wait here for my trial...

715
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,984
I'll be dancing on air.

716
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:17,194
'Tis only the nature of things.

717
00:46:17,294 --> 00:46:19,822
Some die in battle,
some in bed.

718
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:21,949
The highwayman?

719
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:26,162
Falling off a platform
while in conversation with a parson.

720
00:46:26,262 --> 00:46:29,248
As long as you know
beforehand.

721
00:46:29,348 --> 00:46:33,502
Maybe it's only fair
to warn you, too.

722
00:46:33,602 --> 00:46:36,272
I'm going to have a child.

723
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:41,135
That's why I took up your bargain.

724
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:43,220
It mustn't be born here.

725
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,825
Sink me,
but you're a sly wench.

726
00:46:49,451 --> 00:46:54,231
Well, it only proves that
you'll be worth getting free.

727
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:56,041
Merry Christmas.

728
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:32,812
Hello.
Welcome home.

729
00:47:32,912 --> 00:47:34,647
Blueskin.

730
00:47:34,747 --> 00:47:35,815
Hi.

731
00:47:35,915 --> 00:47:36,899
Oh, Jimmy.

732
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:38,859
It's good to have you back.

733
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:41,337
Mother Red Cap's
been expecting you.

734
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:48,177
What's the meaning of this?

735
00:47:51,222 --> 00:47:53,140
Well, Jack?

736
00:48:06,362 --> 00:48:09,657
I thought we could
find a use for her.

737
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,686
The time's close at hand.
Who'll pay her expenses?

738
00:48:13,786 --> 00:48:16,772
She'll earn them back.
I'll stand bond for that.

739
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:19,024
Your bond had more meaning

740
00:48:19,124 --> 00:48:21,235
before they burned you
on the thumb.

741
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:22,778
I'm thinking it's wiser

742
00:48:22,878 --> 00:48:25,406
if we keep you off
the highways for a while.

743
00:48:25,506 --> 00:48:28,784
There's less danger working
the streets here in London.

744
00:48:28,884 --> 00:48:30,786
Maybe you can bring back
some of the purses

745
00:48:30,886 --> 00:48:33,138
that the city fops
carry for their gaming.

746
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,183
Here are your pistols.

747
00:48:37,893 --> 00:48:40,254
You got them back
from the watch!

748
00:48:40,354 --> 00:48:42,715
It cost me £4, 7 and 6
in garnishes.

749
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:45,759
We'll not worry about
a little sum like that.

750
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:48,721
You also owe me £100
for arranging your escape,

751
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:51,724
and I don't like strangers
in my house.

752
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:54,810
You can't turn her out now.

753
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,371
I can, and I would.

754
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,861
She may bring us profit eventually.

755
00:49:03,961 --> 00:49:05,905
She's pretty, and she's flash.

756
00:49:06,005 --> 00:49:08,490
That's all I can say for her.

757
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:10,926
Take her up to the back room.

758
00:50:20,162 --> 00:50:23,006
Follow me, Jeffrey.
My coachman knows the way.

759
00:50:23,506 --> 00:50:26,026
Would it be proper for you
to take me home?

760
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:27,369
Proper, ma'am?

761
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:29,922
T'would be an unpardonable sin
if I didn't.

762
00:50:30,022 --> 00:50:31,840
My carriage
is down the street.

763
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,169
Oh, but it's just a short walk
through the alleyway here.

764
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,329
Through the...

765
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:40,040
As you prefer, sweetheart.

766
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,368
It's a great deal more comfortable
in my carriage.

767
00:50:43,468 --> 00:50:45,296
I'm sure you'd like that better.

768
00:50:45,396 --> 00:50:46,839
It's only a step more—

769
00:50:46,939 --> 00:50:48,482
- I assure you—
- Your pardon, sir.

770
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:49,642
Yes?

771
00:50:53,862 --> 00:50:55,556
Good work, Amber.

772
00:50:55,856 --> 00:50:57,658
You picked a fat one.

773
00:50:59,284 --> 00:51:00,702
Here they come.

774
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:03,272
Stop in the king's name!

775
00:51:03,372 --> 00:51:05,290
Run! Run for your life!

776
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:17,995
Did you get the wench, Captain?

777
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:21,014
The wench!
Don't let her escape!

778
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:07,002
There she is!

779
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:08,353
Halt!

780
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,618
This is the winning throw—
16!

781
00:52:39,718 --> 00:52:40,869
You're too lucky.

782
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:42,121
Your cast, Morgan.

783
00:52:42,221 --> 00:52:44,456
No. I've lost
my limit for tonight,

784
00:52:44,556 --> 00:52:47,626
and I'll thank you gentlemen
to take your leave.

785
00:52:47,726 --> 00:52:50,587
It's late, and the king
reviews our troop tomorrow.

786
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:52,297
Od's blood,
if one doesn't pity

787
00:52:52,397 --> 00:52:54,466
the poor soldier
in time of peace.

788
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:56,051
One more round.

789
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:57,444
No.

790
00:53:05,244 --> 00:53:07,729
Well...

791
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:09,648
Oh, please, sir.

792
00:53:09,748 --> 00:53:13,043
You're not angry because
I took refuge in your house?

793
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:23,537
Refuge, madam?

794
00:53:23,637 --> 00:53:27,499
Yes. I was returning from the tavern
with a gentleman.

795
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,835
He tried to force
his attentions on me,

796
00:53:29,935 --> 00:53:33,172
but I eluded him and came through
your door which was open.

797
00:53:33,272 --> 00:53:35,115
And where's
the scoundrel now?

798
00:53:35,815 --> 00:53:37,818
He was just outside
a moment ago.

799
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:40,304
I was waiting
for him to leave.

800
00:53:40,404 --> 00:53:42,212
If you wish him taught
a lesson in manners,

801
00:53:42,312 --> 00:53:44,330
- I'm at your service.
- Oh, no, no.

802
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,608
Please! He's a very
dangerous man.

803
00:53:46,868 --> 00:53:48,145
A notorious duelist.

804
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:50,230
I'm no stranger
to swordplay myself.

805
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,516
Open up there!

806
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:54,627
- Who's there?
- The watch.

807
00:53:56,878 --> 00:53:58,930
Beg pardon for disturbing you,
Captain Morgan.

808
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,032
What can I do for you?

809
00:54:00,132 --> 00:54:01,666
We're looking for a wench, sir.

810
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:04,219
One of the band of footpads
who cut a gentleman's purse

811
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,156
- up the alley here.
- I see.

812
00:54:06,257 --> 00:54:07,714
What makes you think
she's here?

813
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:10,275
She can't be far away.
We were close behind her.

814
00:54:10,475 --> 00:54:12,986
She must've sneaked
into a house along here.

815
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:16,132
- If I see her, I'll let you know.
- Thank you, sir.

816
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:21,970
Curse me if I didn't
believe your tale.

817
00:54:23,155 --> 00:54:25,015
What am I to do with you?

818
00:54:25,215 --> 00:54:27,935
You know what will happen
if you give me up.

819
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:30,796
They'll put a rope
around my neck and hang me.

820
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:34,208
It's too pretty a neck
for a rope, that's certain.

821
00:54:34,408 --> 00:54:37,519
But, sweetheart, I'm an officer
of His Majesty's guards

822
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:39,279
and sworn to uphold his laws.

823
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:41,532
All I ask is that you
don't give me up.

824
00:54:41,632 --> 00:54:43,992
Then, when the watch
is gone, I'll leave,

825
00:54:44,092 --> 00:54:45,619
and you'll never
see me again.

826
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:47,071
Where will you go?

827
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,433
I don't know.

828
00:54:51,533 --> 00:54:52,751
You have no home?

829
00:54:53,051 --> 00:54:55,879
Only the robbers' den
at Whitefriars,

830
00:54:55,979 --> 00:54:57,824
and there's a horrible
woman there

831
00:54:57,925 --> 00:54:58,949
who has me in debt.

832
00:54:59,149 --> 00:55:01,510
She'll never let me go
as long as I live.

833
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:03,303
This is the truth now?

834
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:06,139
Oh, yes.
Oh, please believe me.

835
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,108
- Morgan?
- Coming.

836
00:55:08,508 --> 00:55:09,935
Please help me.

837
00:55:10,035 --> 00:55:12,053
There's one possibility
that occurs to me,

838
00:55:12,153 --> 00:55:14,982
if you're willing
to put yourself in my hands

839
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:17,009
and do exactly as I say.

840
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:19,953
I'll do anything you say.
Anything.

841
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:21,072
Morgan!

842
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:24,575
- Oh, there you are.
- Good night, Morgan.

843
00:55:24,675 --> 00:55:26,159
Good night.
Where have you been?

844
00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:28,537
Drowning your sorrows
in the pantry, I'll wager.

845
00:55:28,637 --> 00:55:30,038
Good night to you,
gentlemen.

846
00:55:30,238 --> 00:55:31,540
Tomorrow night
at my house?

847
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,584
By all means.
Good night.

848
00:55:33,684 --> 00:55:35,110
Lieutenant Ivers.

849
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:42,175
Come in.

850
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:49,224
Well, as I so aptly remarked,

851
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:51,527
pity the poor soldier
in time of peace.

852
00:55:51,627 --> 00:55:53,228
This is Mr. Ivers.
Mistress...

853
00:55:53,328 --> 00:55:55,230
- St. Clare.
- Mistress St. Clare.

854
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,832
- My services, madam.
- My services, sir.

855
00:55:56,932 --> 00:55:58,826
Mr. Ivers is a close friend
of Mr. Killigrew

856
00:55:58,927 --> 00:56:00,027
of the Theater Royal.

857
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:01,553
An intimate friend,
you might say.

858
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:03,138
He's rejected six
of my plays.

859
00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:06,046
Mistress St. Clare is anxious to
obtain employment as an actress.

860
00:56:06,146 --> 00:56:08,535
Do you think you could use
your influence with Killigrew to help her?

861
00:56:08,635 --> 00:56:10,954
I should think Mistress St. Clare's
own influence

862
00:56:11,054 --> 00:56:12,748
would prove far
more persuasive than mine,

863
00:56:12,848 --> 00:56:14,799
but I'll be happy
to arrange an introduction.

864
00:56:14,899 --> 00:56:16,153
- Good.
- Good night, madam.

865
00:56:16,254 --> 00:56:17,294
Good night, sir.

866
00:56:17,394 --> 00:56:19,071
- Good night.
- Good night, Ivers.

867
00:56:20,355 --> 00:56:22,808
But I don't understand.

868
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:26,011
How can I hide at the theater
right out in public?

869
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,430
The king has made all actors
wards of the crown.

870
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,265
They're such a rowdy lot,
it's the only way

871
00:56:30,365 --> 00:56:32,267
he could insure himself
uninterrupted entertainment.

872
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:33,652
I still can't see how—

873
00:56:33,752 --> 00:56:36,188
Wards of the crown
are immune from arrest.

874
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:38,148
If Killigrew's pleased with you,

875
00:56:38,248 --> 00:56:40,609
and I don't see how
he can be otherwise,

876
00:56:40,709 --> 00:56:43,253
you'll be safe under
the protection of the king.

877
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,743
Amber.

878
00:57:31,843 --> 00:57:32,953
Amber.

879
00:57:33,053 --> 00:57:34,246
Yes, Mr. Killigrew?

880
00:57:34,346 --> 00:57:36,623
The Earl of Radcliffe
wishes to meet you.

881
00:57:36,723 --> 00:57:38,125
Mistress St. Clare.

882
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:39,251
My lord.

883
00:57:39,351 --> 00:57:40,877
I would be greatly favored

884
00:57:40,977 --> 00:57:43,255
by your company at supper
this evening, ma'am.

885
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:46,133
You're very kind, my lord,
but I'm already engaged.

886
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:48,677
Surely his lordship's
invitation takes precedent.

887
00:57:48,777 --> 00:57:50,721
Another night
will do as well.

888
00:57:50,821 --> 00:57:52,180
Tomorrow?

889
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,684
I deeply regret I shall be
unable to accommodate you.

890
00:57:55,784 --> 00:57:58,061
Let me speak to her
alone, my lord.

891
00:57:58,161 --> 00:57:59,688
She's rather new here
and doesn't—

892
00:57:59,788 --> 00:58:04,693
No, no. I prefer the illusion
of a voluntary decision.

893
00:58:04,793 --> 00:58:07,654
May I hope that
at some future time

894
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:11,616
circumstances will permit
other different responses?

895
00:58:11,716 --> 00:58:14,745
Well, it's hard to predict
one's circumstances, sir,

896
00:58:14,845 --> 00:58:17,789
but— well, knowing the weakness
of my own nature,

897
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:19,666
I shall probably be influenced

898
00:58:19,766 --> 00:58:23,186
by any further proofs
of your lordship's interest.

899
00:58:30,277 --> 00:58:31,720
Delightful,
Mistress St. Clare.

900
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,096
Thank you, my lord.

901
00:58:33,196 --> 00:58:37,017
Amber, there's
a gentleman to see you.

902
00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:38,351
Harry!

903
00:58:38,451 --> 00:58:40,996
So it really is you.

904
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:45,901
Amber.

905
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:47,652
What—

906
00:58:47,752 --> 00:58:49,946
They're only looking for
some new scandal to spread.

907
00:58:50,046 --> 00:58:51,531
That's exactly
what I fear.

908
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:53,867
My wife is a great believer
in scandal.

909
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:55,243
You're married now?

910
00:58:55,343 --> 00:58:56,745
I even have a daughter.

911
00:58:56,845 --> 00:58:58,246
Oh, how wonderful, Harry.

912
00:58:58,346 --> 00:59:00,081
But what about you, Amber?

913
00:59:00,181 --> 00:59:01,416
About me?

914
00:59:01,516 --> 00:59:04,336
Yes. Has anything like that
happened to you?

915
00:59:04,436 --> 00:59:07,422
Well, no.
I can't really say that.

916
00:59:07,522 --> 00:59:08,924
I—

917
00:59:09,024 --> 00:59:10,817
Nan!

918
00:59:12,527 --> 00:59:15,305
Sir Harry is one of
my dearest friends.

919
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:17,432
Well, I didn't know, mum.

920
00:59:17,532 --> 00:59:18,934
I was only—

921
00:59:19,034 --> 00:59:21,019
Besides, you're
a lady's maid now.

922
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,979
That's what I got you
out of Newgate for.

923
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:26,566
Newgate? At least you've increased
your knowledge of London.

924
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,109
I've seen a few things.

925
00:59:28,209 --> 00:59:30,529
What about Bruce, Harry?
Have you heard anything?

926
00:59:30,629 --> 00:59:33,114
He's taken some fine prizes
on the Spanish Main

927
00:59:33,214 --> 00:59:34,866
and put into Jamaica for repairs.

928
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:37,786
He might be in England anytime,
there's no saying.

929
00:59:37,886 --> 00:59:39,037
Are you still—

930
00:59:39,137 --> 00:59:41,623
I told you I'd wait for him.

931
00:59:41,723 --> 00:59:43,183
Amber!

932
00:59:46,728 --> 00:59:49,589
Rex, darling, this is
Sir Harry Almsbury.

933
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:51,341
Captain Morgan.

934
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:54,052
You're calling
on someone here, Sir Harry?

935
00:59:54,152 --> 00:59:55,345
Why, yes.
On Mistress St. Clare.

936
00:59:55,445 --> 00:59:56,972
I saw her in the play.

937
00:59:57,072 --> 00:59:58,139
Indeed, sir.

938
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:01,309
Rex, you don't understand.
Sir Harry's my uncle.

939
01:00:01,409 --> 01:00:04,646
That's right, Captain.
Her mother's brother.

940
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:06,982
Younger brother,
if I may be permitted to say so.

941
01:00:07,082 --> 01:00:09,067
He didn't know
I was in the theater.

942
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:12,070
Now, that's the truth—
I mean, that's the truth.

943
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,573
I was sitting out there
watching the play,

944
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:16,992
when suddenly
I said to myself,

945
01:00:17,092 --> 01:00:18,577
"Isn't that little Amber?"

946
01:00:18,677 --> 01:00:21,580
She used to be very little.

947
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,417
Well, my friends will be
waiting for me, Captain.

948
01:00:25,517 --> 01:00:28,086
I'll tell the family
you're well taken care of.

949
01:00:28,186 --> 01:00:30,088
You are well taken care of?

950
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:31,506
Oh, yes, yes,
Sir Harry.

951
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:33,633
They'll be glad to know.

952
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:35,594
Cousin Bruce and all.

953
01:00:35,694 --> 01:00:37,137
Your servant,
Captain Morgan.

954
01:00:37,237 --> 01:00:38,989
Your servant, sir.

955
01:00:41,116 --> 01:00:43,518
You didn't tell me
you had an uncle.

956
01:00:43,618 --> 01:00:45,312
Oh, didn't I?
Come along and talk to me

957
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:48,123
while I change,
darling, won't you?

958
01:01:18,945 --> 01:01:21,723
I'll have supper in
a few minutes, my lady.

959
01:01:21,823 --> 01:01:22,949
Thank you, Nan.

960
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:32,776
Let me take
your sword, dear.

961
01:01:32,876 --> 01:01:34,569
No, I can't stay for supper.

962
01:01:34,669 --> 01:01:36,571
I have to go to Wales
tonight on a mission.

963
01:01:36,671 --> 01:01:39,532
- Oh, Rex, will it be a long one?
- Several weeks, I fear.

964
01:01:39,632 --> 01:01:41,076
You'll miss my biggest part.

965
01:01:41,176 --> 01:01:43,995
I not only have lines
to say in the new play,

966
01:01:44,095 --> 01:01:46,122
but Killigrew's letting
me speak the epilogue.

967
01:01:46,222 --> 01:01:48,541
I'll miss you far more
than I will your performance.

968
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:50,418
You know how I regard
your profession as only

969
01:01:50,518 --> 01:01:52,420
a passing necessity
till your danger's over.

970
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,172
I'll miss you, too, Rex.

971
01:01:54,272 --> 01:01:56,549
Will you let me have some
money for while you're gone?

972
01:01:56,649 --> 01:01:58,009
- Money?
- £5.00 should be plenty.

973
01:01:58,109 --> 01:02:00,428
But I gave you £5.00
two weeks ago, Amber—

974
01:02:00,528 --> 01:02:02,555
I know I'm not
very prudent,

975
01:02:02,655 --> 01:02:05,016
but you do like me
to look pretty.

976
01:02:05,116 --> 01:02:06,951
Not while I'm away.

977
01:02:08,078 --> 01:02:09,537
Amber...

978
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:12,565
you know my feelings
towards you.

979
01:02:12,665 --> 01:02:15,986
At first, I thought of you as
a pleasant companion for a time.

980
01:02:16,086 --> 01:02:17,570
Well, haven't I been?

981
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,323
So much so that
I never want to lose you.

982
01:02:20,423 --> 01:02:23,118
I want you to marry me, Amber.

983
01:02:23,218 --> 01:02:24,119
Marry you?

984
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:25,537
Yes. Why not?

985
01:02:25,637 --> 01:02:27,998
No, I can't.
It's impossible.

986
01:02:28,098 --> 01:02:30,125
Because there's someone else?

987
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:31,835
Is there? Tell me.

988
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:34,045
Have you ever seen me
with anyone else?

989
01:02:34,145 --> 01:02:35,880
No, I haven't.

990
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,091
And take care
that I don't, Amber.

991
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:41,511
I warn you for his sake.

992
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:43,596
There's no one else, Rex.

993
01:02:43,696 --> 01:02:45,181
Then say you will.

994
01:02:45,281 --> 01:02:47,183
I've got to leave now,
I'm late already.

995
01:02:47,283 --> 01:02:49,019
Give me your promise
before I go.

996
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,562
Give me the £5.00?

997
01:02:50,662 --> 01:02:51,688
Of course, darling.

998
01:02:51,788 --> 01:02:53,189
I merely wanted
to be sure that

999
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:56,359
you weren't being
careless, that's all.

1000
01:02:56,459 --> 01:02:58,653
You do love me,
don't you, Amber?

1001
01:02:58,753 --> 01:03:00,989
You know what these
last months have been like.

1002
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:04,425
Do you think
I'm that good an actress?

1003
01:03:07,053 --> 01:03:10,932
I'll think of you every moment
of my journey.

1004
01:03:23,736 --> 01:03:25,722
Nan? Nan?

1005
01:03:25,822 --> 01:03:27,182
Here it is,

1006
01:03:27,282 --> 01:03:30,143
the last of what I
owe Mother Red Cap.

1007
01:03:30,243 --> 01:03:32,771
- Now she'll let me have the baby.
- Well, that's fine.

1008
01:03:32,871 --> 01:03:34,939
You take it to her first thing
in the morning.

1009
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,193
And then we'll find a wonderful place
in the country for little Bruce.

1010
01:03:38,293 --> 01:03:40,528
Are you planning
to marry Captain Morgan?

1011
01:03:40,628 --> 01:03:43,698
Of course not. I'm in love
with Bruce's father.

1012
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:46,076
Oh, I know it, and
you know it, most of the time.

1013
01:03:46,176 --> 01:03:48,161
But the captain
doesn't know it.

1014
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:50,497
I never knew anyone
could lead a man on

1015
01:03:50,597 --> 01:03:52,624
the way you can, Amber.

1016
01:03:52,724 --> 01:03:55,185
Did you ever think
how to turn one loose?

1017
01:03:56,644 --> 01:03:58,104
Nan.

1018
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:01,424
And since no barrier now remains,

1019
01:04:01,524 --> 01:04:04,052
we'll post the banns at once

1020
01:04:04,152 --> 01:04:07,305
and have them married
within the fortnight.

1021
01:04:07,405 --> 01:04:09,974
What say you to that,
Sir Brian?

1022
01:04:10,074 --> 01:04:11,935
'Tis all I ever wanted.

1023
01:04:12,035 --> 01:04:13,937
And you, my dear niece.

1024
01:04:14,037 --> 01:04:16,998
Shall he not be rewarded
with your love and your fortune?

1025
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:19,901
Nay. Never mind.

1026
01:04:20,001 --> 01:04:21,444
I'm sure you will agree

1027
01:04:21,544 --> 01:04:25,365
we need no verbal token
of maidenly assent.

1028
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:27,909
Her eyes have spoken.

1029
01:04:28,009 --> 01:04:30,845
Who'll buy
my oranges?

1030
01:04:46,653 --> 01:04:50,515
Though sober minds
may find our play too light,

1031
01:04:50,615 --> 01:04:52,517
your author and your players

1032
01:04:52,617 --> 01:04:57,021
claim the right to serve
no moral purpose by their art,

1033
01:04:57,121 --> 01:04:59,607
but gaily treat
with matters of the heart.

1034
01:04:59,707 --> 01:05:03,027
And should some critic
for this reason frown,

1035
01:05:03,127 --> 01:05:06,923
why, we'll appeal
the question to the crown.

1036
01:05:30,321 --> 01:05:33,266
Oh, Amber,
you were beautiful.

1037
01:05:33,366 --> 01:05:35,226
What an end!

1038
01:05:35,326 --> 01:05:37,270
You looked
so wonderful!

1039
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:39,205
Uh, Mistress St. Clare?

1040
01:05:40,873 --> 01:05:42,567
Madam is invited
to an informal supper

1041
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:45,612
as soon as she
has changed her costume.

1042
01:05:45,712 --> 01:05:48,615
I'll await your
convenience outside.

1043
01:05:48,715 --> 01:05:51,743
I told you she's
going to the palace!

1044
01:05:51,843 --> 01:05:53,203
The palace!

1045
01:05:53,303 --> 01:05:55,163
Oh! Whatever will I wear?

1046
01:05:55,263 --> 01:05:56,581
I don't know.

1047
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:57,916
Amber.

1048
01:05:58,016 --> 01:05:59,250
Oh, Harry,
I can't stop now.

1049
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:00,710
I've got to change.

1050
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:03,271
Well, in that case,
I won't detain you, but...

1051
01:06:05,773 --> 01:06:07,275
Bruce?

1052
01:06:19,954 --> 01:06:21,314
Sir Thomas.

1053
01:06:21,414 --> 01:06:22,523
Sir Harry.

1054
01:06:22,623 --> 01:06:25,526
Mistress St. Clare asks me
to present her compliments.

1055
01:06:25,626 --> 01:06:27,987
She will be unable to
accept your invitation.

1056
01:06:28,087 --> 01:06:30,031
But doesn't
the wench understand?

1057
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:31,574
It's not my invitation.

1058
01:06:31,674 --> 01:06:32,909
She understands.

1059
01:06:33,009 --> 01:06:34,535
But she was so overcome
by the honor

1060
01:06:34,635 --> 01:06:37,413
that she's in no condition
to respond to it.

1061
01:06:37,513 --> 01:06:39,249
- I can wait.
- I'm afraid not.

1062
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:41,542
At this very moment,
she's running a high fever.

1063
01:06:41,642 --> 01:06:43,211
Some other time,
perhaps.

1064
01:06:43,311 --> 01:06:45,755
And please extend
to His Majesty

1065
01:06:45,855 --> 01:06:48,816
my best wishes
as to his own well-being.

1066
01:06:58,409 --> 01:07:00,395
You haven't told me,
Bruce.

1067
01:07:00,495 --> 01:07:02,397
Did you miss me?

1068
01:07:02,497 --> 01:07:04,899
More than I expected to.

1069
01:07:04,999 --> 01:07:07,627
I worried about you, too.

1070
01:07:09,087 --> 01:07:11,714
And what's this great
mystery that awaits us?

1071
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:15,343
You'll see.

1072
01:07:29,232 --> 01:07:31,234
Wait here. Please.

1073
01:07:52,713 --> 01:07:54,966
Your son, my lord.

1074
01:08:11,983 --> 01:08:13,718
Well, our son's
a freebooter.

1075
01:08:13,818 --> 01:08:15,470
Very well.
I'm ready to pay ransom.

1076
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:16,971
What'll it be?

1077
01:08:17,071 --> 01:08:18,264
Indian chief.

1078
01:08:18,364 --> 01:08:20,183
Indian chief?
Very well.

1079
01:08:20,283 --> 01:08:22,602
I'll tell you a story
about my great friend,

1080
01:08:22,702 --> 01:08:24,395
the red Indian chief
Mattacumsett.

1081
01:08:24,495 --> 01:08:26,314
Do you know what
that means, Mattacumsett?

1082
01:08:26,414 --> 01:08:27,315
What?

1083
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:30,109
That means big chief
who's not afraid of the dark.

1084
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:32,528
- Are you afraid of the dark?
- No.

1085
01:08:32,628 --> 01:08:35,615
Good. Then I'll bring you
a tomahawk my very next voyage.

1086
01:08:35,715 --> 01:08:39,994
Bruce, why do you fill his head
with tales of wild savages?

1087
01:08:40,094 --> 01:08:41,788
Mattacumsett's no savage.

1088
01:08:41,888 --> 01:08:43,915
By their standards,
he's a gentleman.

1089
01:08:44,015 --> 01:08:47,168
Far more of one than
most of our London courtiers.

1090
01:08:47,268 --> 01:08:50,254
Come, darling. Mrs. Chiverton's
waiting to put you to bed.

1091
01:08:50,354 --> 01:08:51,756
Give Mother a kiss.

1092
01:08:51,856 --> 01:08:54,926
Sleep well. In the morning,
we'll look for birds' nests.

1093
01:08:55,026 --> 01:08:56,819
Good night,
my angel.

1094
01:09:03,784 --> 01:09:06,187
I declare, I'm getting
jealous of you two.

1095
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:08,523
After all, he's my first son.

1096
01:09:08,623 --> 01:09:09,732
Our son.

1097
01:09:09,832 --> 01:09:11,526
Isn't it wonderful,
Bruce?

1098
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:14,670
Yes, I've enjoyed
this day here.

1099
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,740
More than I can say.

1100
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,425
Have you, darling?

1101
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:22,970
Wouldn't be
such a bad life.

1102
01:09:24,722 --> 01:09:26,432
Living on a farm...

1103
01:09:27,683 --> 01:09:29,477
tilling a few acres...

1104
01:09:30,353 --> 01:09:31,646
raising a family.

1105
01:09:34,106 --> 01:09:36,108
And that supper
we had tonight.

1106
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,514
I'd no idea you'd such a way
with mutton and greens.

1107
01:09:41,614 --> 01:09:44,308
Darling, you forget
I was brought up on a farm.

1108
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:46,269
I couldn't forget it tonight.

1109
01:09:46,369 --> 01:09:48,020
You haven't changed so much

1110
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,399
from the girl I met
in Marygreen after all.

1111
01:09:51,499 --> 01:09:54,527
But, Bruce,
you know I've changed.

1112
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:58,573
I'm learning to read,
and I don't say "Gemini" anymore.

1113
01:09:58,673 --> 01:10:01,200
And I can hold my own with
any of your Whitehall ladies.

1114
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,493
I daresay you can.

1115
01:10:02,593 --> 01:10:04,745
Darling, I've been making
such wonderful plans.

1116
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:06,372
I'll leave the theater,

1117
01:10:06,472 --> 01:10:08,583
and we'll take a house
in London for the season.

1118
01:10:08,683 --> 01:10:10,751
One of those big houses
with a lawn that stretches

1119
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:12,587
all the way down to the river.

1120
01:10:12,687 --> 01:10:15,089
And we'll invite the whole court
to our entertainments,

1121
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:16,591
all except Castlemaine,
of course.

1122
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:19,110
They say the king
is tiring of her anyway.

1123
01:10:20,987 --> 01:10:22,763
Oh, please, Bruce.

1124
01:10:22,863 --> 01:10:25,766
But, sweetheart,
I'm going back to sea.

1125
01:10:25,866 --> 01:10:29,061
You're going to be
a pirate all your life?

1126
01:10:29,161 --> 01:10:31,355
I have no stomach
for life at court.

1127
01:10:31,455 --> 01:10:33,900
What's so fine
about life at sea?

1128
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,876
It's clean,
for one thing.

1129
01:10:37,086 --> 01:10:41,282
What would you do
if I hid myself on your ship?

1130
01:10:41,382 --> 01:10:42,658
Clap you in irons.

1131
01:10:42,758 --> 01:10:44,994
Besides, what would
Captain Morgan say?

1132
01:10:45,094 --> 01:10:46,954
I told you,
he means nothing to me.

1133
01:10:47,054 --> 01:10:48,831
That's not what I heard.

1134
01:10:48,931 --> 01:10:53,503
Well, he helped me
when I had some debts to pay.

1135
01:10:53,603 --> 01:10:54,795
And I suppose he knows

1136
01:10:54,895 --> 01:10:57,381
you're here
in the country with me.

1137
01:10:57,481 --> 01:11:01,594
Why should I have to run to him
with all my comings and goings?

1138
01:11:01,694 --> 01:11:03,513
Please believe me, Bruce.

1139
01:11:03,613 --> 01:11:05,806
There's no one but you.

1140
01:11:05,906 --> 01:11:08,351
There never has been,
and there never will be.

1141
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:11,854
I've never asked you
if there was.

1142
01:11:11,954 --> 01:11:14,123
But I want you to know.

1143
01:11:30,723 --> 01:11:32,308
Well, Amber.

1144
01:11:33,392 --> 01:11:35,628
It's early yet, Bruce.

1145
01:11:35,728 --> 01:11:36,963
Please?

1146
01:11:37,063 --> 01:11:38,814
Very well.

1147
01:11:41,776 --> 01:11:44,887
I don't want to waste
one moment of this.

1148
01:11:44,987 --> 01:11:48,015
These are the things
I'll remember when you're gone.

1149
01:11:48,115 --> 01:11:49,850
Walking with you,

1150
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,353
feeling your hand on my arm,

1151
01:11:52,453 --> 01:11:54,897
the feeling of you being close.

1152
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:56,315
Will you remember, too?

1153
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,818
It'll be hard
leaving you and our son.

1154
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:02,321
Oh, Bruce, it isn't too late
to change your plans.

1155
01:12:02,421 --> 01:12:04,365
After all, we don't have
to live in London.

1156
01:12:04,465 --> 01:12:06,200
We could find a place
in the country.

1157
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,054
Even a farm if you'd like,
if only you'd stay.

1158
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:15,042
My Lord Carlton?

1159
01:12:15,142 --> 01:12:17,044
At your service, sir.

1160
01:12:17,144 --> 01:12:20,881
My lord realizes, of course,
that he's done me an injury

1161
01:12:20,981 --> 01:12:22,925
which one gentleman
may not accept from another.

1162
01:12:23,025 --> 01:12:23,926
Rex!

1163
01:12:24,026 --> 01:12:26,929
If I have, sir,
'twas not by intention.

1164
01:12:27,029 --> 01:12:30,349
My friends will call on you
at your earliest convenience

1165
01:12:30,449 --> 01:12:31,976
to arrange a meeting.

1166
01:12:32,076 --> 01:12:34,036
Your servant, my lord.

1167
01:12:36,747 --> 01:12:39,025
I'm at your service,
Captain, of course.

1168
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:42,445
But surely there can be no harm
in discussing our differences.

1169
01:12:42,545 --> 01:12:44,030
The lady's an old friend of mine,

1170
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:48,200
I intended no violence to your honor
in paying my respects to her.

1171
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,453
Is it your custom to pay
your respects to a lady

1172
01:12:50,553 --> 01:12:53,623
promised in marriage
to another gentleman?

1173
01:12:53,723 --> 01:12:55,599
I... I didn't—

1174
01:12:57,268 --> 01:12:59,186
Your servant, sir.

1175
01:13:00,813 --> 01:13:02,064
Rex!

1176
01:13:03,441 --> 01:13:04,425
Rex!

1177
01:13:04,525 --> 01:13:05,718
Let him go.

1178
01:13:05,818 --> 01:13:08,721
You fool. The harm's done.

1179
01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:10,640
You have to fight him?

1180
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,933
Yes. Pretty, isn't it?

1181
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:16,395
Even if he wins, he'll have lost
what he's fighting for.

1182
01:13:16,495 --> 01:13:18,522
Do you think I'm worried
about what happens to him?

1183
01:13:18,622 --> 01:13:19,815
You should be.

1184
01:13:19,915 --> 01:13:21,901
He was telling the truth,
wasn't he?

1185
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:23,444
You did promise to marry him.

1186
01:13:23,544 --> 01:13:24,695
I promised nothing.

1187
01:13:24,795 --> 01:13:26,155
If he chose
to believe that—

1188
01:13:26,255 --> 01:13:28,616
Perhaps I'm just as much
to blame as you are.

1189
01:13:28,716 --> 01:13:31,761
Between us, we've destroyed
something very fine and decent.

1190
01:13:32,845 --> 01:13:34,747
If he lives through this,
go back to him,

1191
01:13:34,847 --> 01:13:38,542
even if you have to crawl
on your knees to do it.

1192
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:41,145
I'll do my best
to dissuade him.

1193
01:14:12,301 --> 01:14:13,452
- Ready?
- Ready.

1194
01:14:13,552 --> 01:14:15,346
- Ready?
- Ready.

1195
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:20,392
Gentlemen?

1196
01:14:21,685 --> 01:14:23,170
Ready.

1197
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:25,940
Ready.

1198
01:14:31,487 --> 01:14:33,280
On your guard,
gentlemen.

1199
01:14:35,449 --> 01:14:38,477
May I suggest, Captain,
that we consider this matter settled

1200
01:14:38,577 --> 01:14:40,187
when blood has been drawn?

1201
01:14:40,287 --> 01:14:42,273
The matter, my lord,
will be settled

1202
01:14:42,373 --> 01:14:43,916
when one of us is dead.

1203
01:15:20,661 --> 01:15:21,979
Amber.

1204
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:23,731
Harry, stop it.
He'll be killed.

1205
01:15:23,831 --> 01:15:24,732
Go back.

1206
01:15:24,832 --> 01:15:26,125
No.

1207
01:15:36,677 --> 01:15:37,661
He's wounded!

1208
01:15:37,761 --> 01:15:39,305
Don't move.

1209
01:15:41,682 --> 01:15:42,975
Surgeon.

1210
01:16:00,576 --> 01:16:03,120
Let this satisfy
your honor, Captain.

1211
01:16:04,455 --> 01:16:06,415
Take your sword, sir.

1212
01:16:32,983 --> 01:16:34,635
Bruce.

1213
01:16:34,735 --> 01:16:36,445
Bruce, you're hurt.

1214
01:16:37,529 --> 01:16:40,099
There's a man over there
who's dying.

1215
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:41,784
Go to him.

1216
01:17:25,911 --> 01:17:27,313
Thank you, Surgeon.

1217
01:17:27,413 --> 01:17:28,480
My lord.

1218
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,232
Bruce.

1219
01:17:30,332 --> 01:17:32,109
In heaven's name, Amber,

1220
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:33,986
haven't we caused
enough unhappiness?

1221
01:17:34,086 --> 01:17:35,821
A nameless child
and now a dead man.

1222
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:38,590
May God forgive us both
for our sins.

1223
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:57,985
Pray come in, my lord.

1224
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:12,358
I trust I find you in good health,
Mistress St. Clare.

1225
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:13,984
Thank you, my lord.

1226
01:18:14,084 --> 01:18:16,320
As it happens, I've been
suffering from the vapors.

1227
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:17,738
The shock of
the recent tragedy

1228
01:18:17,838 --> 01:18:19,448
which befell your
betrothed, no doubt.

1229
01:18:19,548 --> 01:18:20,950
I fear so.

1230
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:23,744
May I offer you my sincere
condolences, madam?

1231
01:18:23,844 --> 01:18:25,871
It was for that reason I called.

1232
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:27,456
I'm grateful, my lord.

1233
01:18:27,556 --> 01:18:30,334
I am no stranger
to sorrow myself.

1234
01:18:30,434 --> 01:18:34,755
I lost my dear countess in Italy
less than two years ago.

1235
01:18:34,855 --> 01:18:36,090
Oh, how dreadful.

1236
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:39,051
What was the cause
of her death?

1237
01:18:39,151 --> 01:18:43,030
A mysterious malady
which proved incurable.

1238
01:18:44,573 --> 01:18:45,766
How sad.

1239
01:18:45,866 --> 01:18:47,267
Sad, indeed.

1240
01:18:47,367 --> 01:18:48,852
We were well-suited
to each other.

1241
01:18:48,952 --> 01:18:51,730
She appreciated the luxuries
I was able to offer her,

1242
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:54,692
and I appreciated her beauty,
which was exceptional.

1243
01:18:54,792 --> 01:18:57,011
But my grief
was unassuageable.

1244
01:18:57,211 --> 01:18:58,237
Un...

1245
01:18:58,737 --> 01:19:00,781
Inconsolable.

1246
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:02,591
Oh. Yes.

1247
01:19:03,675 --> 01:19:05,828
Mine, too.

1248
01:19:05,928 --> 01:19:08,163
My heart goes out
to you, madam.

1249
01:19:08,263 --> 01:19:10,874
I trust that time will exert
a healing influence,

1250
01:19:10,974 --> 01:19:12,918
as it has in my case.

1251
01:19:13,018 --> 01:19:14,586
Thank you, my lord.

1252
01:19:14,686 --> 01:19:17,047
At which time I shall
give myself the pleasure

1253
01:19:17,147 --> 01:19:19,441
of calling on you again.

1254
01:19:35,749 --> 01:19:37,609
What do you think, Nan?

1255
01:19:37,709 --> 01:19:39,653
The old devil
wants to marry me!

1256
01:19:39,753 --> 01:19:41,030
Oh, Amber!

1257
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:43,490
You'll be Countess of Radcliffe!

1258
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:44,992
Yes...

1259
01:19:45,092 --> 01:19:49,263
but I'd like to know
how his first wife died.

1260
01:19:52,099 --> 01:19:53,584
It's a lovely day.

1261
01:19:53,684 --> 01:19:54,960
It is, indeed.

1262
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,755
And permit me to add, madam,
that its splendor is outshone

1263
01:19:57,855 --> 01:20:00,215
only by the radiance
of your person

1264
01:20:00,315 --> 01:20:02,593
and the felicity
of the occasion.

1265
01:20:02,693 --> 01:20:03,844
Congratulations.

1266
01:20:03,944 --> 01:20:05,387
Uh, congratulations,
Radcliffe.

1267
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:07,514
Redmond, my dear friend.
Your ladyship.

1268
01:20:07,614 --> 01:20:09,391
Such a beautiful
ceremony.

1269
01:20:09,491 --> 01:20:11,560
The poor dear bishop
hasn't spoken so distinctly

1270
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:12,895
since his last attack.

1271
01:20:12,995 --> 01:20:15,147
And what
a notable company.

1272
01:20:15,247 --> 01:20:18,108
We haven't seen the like
of it hereabouts for years.

1273
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:20,486
Perhaps we can thank
the plague in London for that.

1274
01:20:20,586 --> 01:20:23,530
I hear there's not a man or woman
of gentle birth left in the city.

1275
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:25,365
Oh, don't speak about it,
my lord, please.

1276
01:20:25,465 --> 01:20:26,784
I simply can't bear—

1277
01:20:26,884 --> 01:20:27,910
Now, Constance.

1278
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:29,870
I know, I know
all the arguments

1279
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:31,872
about how overcrowded
the city is.

1280
01:20:31,972 --> 01:20:34,374
But I still can't
help feeling sorry

1281
01:20:34,474 --> 01:20:37,477
for the poor creatures,
dying like flies.

1282
01:20:38,687 --> 01:20:41,256
Your pardon, my lady.
Gentlemen.

1283
01:20:41,356 --> 01:20:43,467
Gorgeous creature.

1284
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:45,094
Extraordinary.

1285
01:20:45,194 --> 01:20:46,804
Found her in the theater,
I'm told.

1286
01:20:46,904 --> 01:20:48,097
Oh, my dear.

1287
01:20:48,197 --> 01:20:50,390
How can you repeat
that outrageous story?

1288
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:53,060
His lordship will think
we believe it.

1289
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,895
Do not distress yourself,
Lady Redmond.

1290
01:20:54,995 --> 01:20:56,396
It is quite true.

1291
01:20:56,496 --> 01:20:59,399
My wife was compelled
by the exigencies of fortune

1292
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:01,860
to exhibit herself
on the public stage,

1293
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,364
but I have chosen to consider
her past life a closed book,

1294
01:21:05,464 --> 01:21:07,032
and to devote myself,

1295
01:21:07,132 --> 01:21:09,409
as perhaps the foremost
of my marital obligations,

1296
01:21:09,509 --> 01:21:10,928
to her complete re-education.

1297
01:21:12,012 --> 01:21:13,914
- Your ladyship.
- Thank you.

1298
01:21:14,014 --> 01:21:14,915
Redmond.

1299
01:21:15,015 --> 01:21:16,600
Ah. Thank you.

1300
01:21:18,769 --> 01:21:20,020
Harry.

1301
01:21:21,521 --> 01:21:24,424
My congratulations,
your ladyship.

1302
01:21:24,524 --> 01:21:26,844
I owe you a debt of gratitude.

1303
01:21:26,944 --> 01:21:29,930
You've restored my shattered faith
in gambling at long odds.

1304
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:32,015
Oh, Harry, stop it.

1305
01:21:32,115 --> 01:21:34,309
You're the only person
around here

1306
01:21:34,409 --> 01:21:36,520
who doesn't talk like something
out of the old court.

1307
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:38,105
And look like it.

1308
01:21:38,205 --> 01:21:40,440
Your husband was a friend
of my father's, you know.

1309
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:43,443
Well, if he'd been any younger,
he'd never have married me.

1310
01:21:43,543 --> 01:21:45,988
If he'd been any older,
he couldn't have.

1311
01:21:46,088 --> 01:21:49,283
Well, you got what you wanted—
money and a title.

1312
01:21:49,383 --> 01:21:51,285
A better one than Bruce's.

1313
01:21:51,385 --> 01:21:53,036
What do you think, Harry?

1314
01:21:53,136 --> 01:21:55,372
Shouldn't a baron be satisfied
with a countess?

1315
01:21:55,472 --> 01:21:57,833
He might prefer one
unencumbered by a husband.

1316
01:21:57,933 --> 01:21:59,585
Oh, he'll be no problem.

1317
01:21:59,685 --> 01:22:02,045
Our marriage is
simply an arrangement.

1318
01:22:02,145 --> 01:22:04,631
He wanted a young wife,
I wanted a title.

1319
01:22:04,731 --> 01:22:06,633
Besides,
he can't live forever.

1320
01:22:06,733 --> 01:22:09,219
He's making a very
impressive attempt at it.

1321
01:22:09,319 --> 01:22:12,264
Do you expect Bruce
to see your arrangement

1322
01:22:12,364 --> 01:22:14,283
the same way that you do?

1323
01:22:17,077 --> 01:22:19,563
Everything I've ever done
has been for Bruce.

1324
01:22:19,663 --> 01:22:22,149
I hope he appreciates
this last gesture of yours.

1325
01:22:22,249 --> 01:22:24,735
You'll have a chance
to find out shortly.

1326
01:22:24,835 --> 01:22:27,546
I saw him in London
before I left last night.

1327
01:22:28,714 --> 01:22:30,240
In London?

1328
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,993
Yes. He's having trouble
getting his cargo unloaded.

1329
01:22:33,093 --> 01:22:35,204
All the people
that haven't left the city

1330
01:22:35,304 --> 01:22:37,789
have shut themselves up
in their houses against the plague.

1331
01:22:37,889 --> 01:22:39,166
Where is his ship?

1332
01:22:39,266 --> 01:22:41,752
St. Paul's Wharf.
What can you possibly—

1333
01:22:41,852 --> 01:22:43,712
Oh, Harry, do me
a favor, will you?

1334
01:22:43,812 --> 01:22:47,007
Tell my husband that
I was called away suddenly.

1335
01:22:47,107 --> 01:22:48,342
Make up some excuse,
you know,

1336
01:22:48,442 --> 01:22:49,760
one that will sound reasonable?

1337
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:50,986
Reasonable?

1338
01:22:51,987 --> 01:22:53,280
Amber!

1339
01:22:55,115 --> 01:22:56,516
No Londra, signora.

1340
01:22:56,616 --> 01:22:59,311
I no Londra.
C'é la pesta, Londra

1341
01:22:59,411 --> 01:23:02,439
What about you? Will you
drive me for £5.00? 10?

1342
01:23:02,539 --> 01:23:04,524
I'll not cross
the Thames for £100,

1343
01:23:04,624 --> 01:23:06,960
not while the sickness lasts,
my lady.

1344
01:23:12,883 --> 01:23:15,410
But Amber's always been
devoted to her grandmother.

1345
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:17,955
The news may have
unsettled her wits.

1346
01:23:18,055 --> 01:23:19,556
Galeazzo!

1347
01:23:23,518 --> 01:23:26,463
Che la signora vole va
andare a Londra.

1348
01:23:26,563 --> 01:23:28,065
Imbecille!

1349
01:23:39,785 --> 01:23:40,852
Stop!

1350
01:23:40,952 --> 01:23:42,454
Stop there!

1351
01:23:43,246 --> 01:23:44,856
But I must go to the docks.

1352
01:23:44,956 --> 01:23:46,024
Order of the lord mayor.

1353
01:23:46,124 --> 01:23:48,960
You can try that way.
You might get through.

1354
01:24:34,881 --> 01:24:36,216
Bruce!

1355
01:24:37,676 --> 01:24:40,037
What the devil
are you doing here?

1356
01:24:40,137 --> 01:24:41,788
I heard you'd landed.

1357
01:24:41,888 --> 01:24:43,290
Don't you know it's dangerous?

1358
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:45,334
We've had three cases
of the plague on my ship.

1359
01:24:45,434 --> 01:24:47,727
Oh, Bruce,
just to see you again...

1360
01:24:48,937 --> 01:24:51,173
What is it? Are you ill?

1361
01:24:51,273 --> 01:24:53,467
No. We've been working
night and day to unload

1362
01:24:53,567 --> 01:24:55,761
and get out of this pesthole.

1363
01:24:55,861 --> 01:24:57,137
We're almost finished.

1364
01:24:57,237 --> 01:25:00,515
You need some rest
and something to eat.

1365
01:25:00,615 --> 01:25:03,018
My carriage is down there.

1366
01:25:03,118 --> 01:25:05,745
Bruce, please, darling.

1367
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:10,734
Mr. Ross!

1368
01:25:10,834 --> 01:25:12,252
Aye, my lord?

1369
01:25:15,839 --> 01:25:17,299
Carry on.

1370
01:25:35,692 --> 01:25:37,511
Let me out here.

1371
01:25:37,611 --> 01:25:39,554
Can't take any—
any chances.

1372
01:25:39,654 --> 01:25:41,431
It might be...
might be...

1373
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:45,185
No, don't say that, darling.
It's only the vapors.

1374
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,360
Guard!

1375
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,045
Guard, please.

1376
01:25:56,129 --> 01:25:57,030
Stand clear.

1377
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:59,408
I must get him inside.

1378
01:25:59,508 --> 01:26:03,537
Here. I'll give you £10
if you let us go in that house.

1379
01:26:03,637 --> 01:26:04,930
Drop it.

1380
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:40,966
Don't touch me.

1381
01:27:21,172 --> 01:27:22,591
Don't.

1382
01:27:23,633 --> 01:27:24,926
Don't, Amber.

1383
01:27:36,438 --> 01:27:37,506
No, Bruce.

1384
01:27:37,606 --> 01:27:39,299
Go away, Amber.

1385
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:41,776
Go away while you can.

1386
01:28:46,841 --> 01:28:48,134
Well?

1387
01:28:49,219 --> 01:28:50,745
I'm the nurse, dearie.

1388
01:28:50,845 --> 01:28:52,289
Mrs. Spong.

1389
01:28:52,389 --> 01:28:54,249
You were supposed
to come here yesterday.

1390
01:28:54,349 --> 01:28:57,268
My last was
a slow one to die.

1391
01:28:58,853 --> 01:29:01,506
Got the plague boil,
has he?

1392
01:29:01,606 --> 01:29:04,759
Well, that's the worst part
of the sickness,

1393
01:29:04,859 --> 01:29:07,762
but they never live at all
if they don't have one.

1394
01:29:07,862 --> 01:29:09,514
Is it coming
to a head?

1395
01:29:09,614 --> 01:29:12,058
Well, that's hard
to say, dearie.

1396
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:15,020
Sometimes they get fits
when it does.

1397
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,856
Then it's easy to tell.

1398
01:29:17,956 --> 01:29:20,525
We'll take a look at it
tomorrow morning,

1399
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:23,612
and then we'll cut it maybe.

1400
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:26,364
No sense worrying
too much about him.

1401
01:29:26,464 --> 01:29:29,951
The way he looks,
he'll die whatever we do.

1402
01:29:30,051 --> 01:29:32,120
He's not going to die.
He mustn't.

1403
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,122
Like to make a wager, dearie?

1404
01:29:34,222 --> 01:29:37,584
Twice my pay
against none at all?

1405
01:29:37,684 --> 01:29:39,085
No, don't touch him.

1406
01:29:39,185 --> 01:29:41,062
I'll see to him.

1407
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:46,609
There are some dirty things
in the kitchen.

1408
01:32:05,164 --> 01:32:06,399
Amber!

1409
01:32:06,499 --> 01:32:08,067
Mrs. Spong!

1410
01:32:08,167 --> 01:32:09,836
Mrs. Spong!

1411
01:33:21,658 --> 01:33:23,785
Bring out your dead!

1412
01:33:25,036 --> 01:33:26,271
Guard! Guard!

1413
01:33:26,371 --> 01:33:27,605
What do you want?

1414
01:33:27,705 --> 01:33:28,606
In there.

1415
01:33:28,706 --> 01:33:29,941
Oh, very well.

1416
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:31,501
Here you are!

1417
01:33:44,222 --> 01:33:45,932
Where is it?

1418
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:48,935
On the floor.

1419
01:34:21,217 --> 01:34:24,262
Bruce! Bruce, darling, what is it?
What is the matter?

1420
01:34:25,346 --> 01:34:27,640
Here, let me help you.

1421
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:06,304
Hurry, Amber, hurry.

1422
01:35:45,051 --> 01:35:46,953
I can't do it, Bruce.

1423
01:35:47,053 --> 01:35:48,746
I can't do it.

1424
01:35:48,846 --> 01:35:50,848
You must, Amber. Hurry.

1425
01:36:31,848 --> 01:36:33,224
Darling?

1426
01:36:40,857 --> 01:36:42,191
Darling.

1427
01:37:04,046 --> 01:37:05,548
Bruce.

1428
01:37:17,059 --> 01:37:18,477
Bruce.

1429
01:37:20,313 --> 01:37:22,148
Oh, darling, you're—

1430
01:37:39,582 --> 01:37:41,067
Oh, Bruce!

1431
01:37:41,167 --> 01:37:43,402
I must look
a perfect horror.

1432
01:37:43,502 --> 01:37:46,405
Oh, let me go
and dress my hair and—

1433
01:37:46,505 --> 01:37:48,032
The same Amber.

1434
01:37:48,132 --> 01:37:50,409
Don't go.

1435
01:37:50,509 --> 01:37:52,094
Stay.

1436
01:37:53,179 --> 01:37:55,348
Stay just as you are.

1437
01:38:03,689 --> 01:38:04,815
Ho!

1438
01:38:09,862 --> 01:38:10,763
Ecco, signore.

1439
01:38:10,863 --> 01:38:12,657
Questa la casa.

1440
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,144
No undate!

1441
01:38:16,244 --> 01:38:17,411
La pasta!

1442
01:38:25,711 --> 01:38:26,779
My Lord Carlton?

1443
01:38:26,879 --> 01:38:28,214
Yes?

1444
01:38:29,715 --> 01:38:32,510
I am the Earl of Radcliffe.

1445
01:38:34,053 --> 01:38:35,663
Where is she?

1446
01:38:35,763 --> 01:38:37,123
Where is who, my lord?

1447
01:38:37,223 --> 01:38:38,916
Do you refer
to Mistress St. Clare?

1448
01:38:39,016 --> 01:38:40,476
I refer to my wife.

1449
01:38:42,728 --> 01:38:44,839
She has been taking
care of you here.

1450
01:38:44,939 --> 01:38:49,093
It has cost me considerable time
and money to find you.

1451
01:38:49,193 --> 01:38:51,053
Amber is your wife?

1452
01:38:51,153 --> 01:38:52,597
Is she here?

1453
01:38:52,697 --> 01:38:55,157
Not at the moment.
She's gone to buy food.

1454
01:38:55,908 --> 01:38:59,604
Perhaps you'd best sit down
and consider this slowly.

1455
01:38:59,704 --> 01:39:01,355
Will you have some wine?

1456
01:39:01,455 --> 01:39:02,773
No, thank you.

1457
01:39:02,873 --> 01:39:05,234
I will, if you don't mind.

1458
01:39:05,334 --> 01:39:07,695
You must understand that
this information is so startling

1459
01:39:07,795 --> 01:39:11,257
that I can't adapt myself
to it easily.

1460
01:39:12,341 --> 01:39:16,120
May I inquire into the nature
of your present intentions?

1461
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:19,749
They are simple.
I have come to fetch the countess.

1462
01:39:19,849 --> 01:39:22,376
Do you propose to prevent me?

1463
01:39:22,476 --> 01:39:25,087
I see no way
in which I can do so

1464
01:39:25,187 --> 01:39:27,215
that is either
honorable or practical.

1465
01:39:27,315 --> 01:39:29,050
I'm glad to hear that.

1466
01:39:29,150 --> 01:39:31,469
I used to be proud
of my swordsmanship,

1467
01:39:31,569 --> 01:39:35,514
but... I'm rather old
for dueling now.

1468
01:39:35,614 --> 01:39:38,559
I presume I owe you
some sort of explanation.

1469
01:39:38,659 --> 01:39:40,186
I require none

1470
01:39:40,286 --> 01:39:41,938
about the past.

1471
01:39:42,038 --> 01:39:47,318
But I do confess a certain curiosity
regarding your... future plans.

1472
01:39:47,418 --> 01:39:49,820
They are forming in my mind
at this moment.

1473
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,032
I've long had the idea
of settling in Virginia.

1474
01:39:53,132 --> 01:39:56,786
Does your lordship consider
that I look fit enough to travel?

1475
01:39:56,886 --> 01:39:58,913
Beyond a doubt, my lord.

1476
01:39:59,013 --> 01:40:00,706
In that case,

1477
01:40:00,806 --> 01:40:03,542
may I say with sincerity
and humility

1478
01:40:03,642 --> 01:40:06,629
that you are an extremely
fortunate man?

1479
01:40:06,729 --> 01:40:08,464
And since I owe her ladyship

1480
01:40:08,564 --> 01:40:11,842
a debt far greater than
I can ever hope to repay,

1481
01:40:11,942 --> 01:40:16,472
would it be presumptuous to ask you
to give her my warmest regards

1482
01:40:16,572 --> 01:40:18,849
and best wishes
for her happiness?

1483
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:20,685
I shall convey them to her,

1484
01:40:20,785 --> 01:40:24,080
together with your regret
that you will never meet again.

1485
01:41:07,957 --> 01:41:11,527
You look quite domestic
in these surroundings, madam.

1486
01:41:11,627 --> 01:41:14,488
Perhaps a few months of solitude
at Radcliffe Manor

1487
01:41:14,588 --> 01:41:17,658
will teach you
all the wifely virtues.

1488
01:41:17,758 --> 01:41:19,035
Where is Bruce?

1489
01:41:19,135 --> 01:41:21,746
What have you done to him?

1490
01:41:21,846 --> 01:41:23,122
He has gone...

1491
01:41:23,222 --> 01:41:26,142
and quite of his own accord.

1492
01:41:34,859 --> 01:41:37,153
Are you ready,
madam?

1493
01:41:46,495 --> 01:41:47,897
The Marquis of Boustard,

1494
01:41:47,997 --> 01:41:49,665
the Lady Anne Somerset.

1495
01:41:53,461 --> 01:41:55,963
The Earl and Countess
of Radcliffee.

1496
01:42:01,635 --> 01:42:03,888
Sir Thomas
and Lady Berkeley.

1497
01:42:05,139 --> 01:42:07,041
Curse me
for a Roundhead dog.

1498
01:42:07,141 --> 01:42:09,377
For once,
the truth outdoes the rumor.

1499
01:42:09,477 --> 01:42:11,854
Why, it's that actress
what's-her-name.

1500
01:42:19,111 --> 01:42:20,721
The king isn't here.

1501
01:42:20,821 --> 01:42:22,056
A pity, madam,

1502
01:42:22,156 --> 01:42:24,892
but doubtless we shall pay
our respects again next year.

1503
01:42:24,992 --> 01:42:26,852
Perhaps you can
be presented then.

1504
01:42:26,952 --> 01:42:29,897
Next year? But they have a ball
like this every week.

1505
01:42:29,997 --> 01:42:31,524
I consider an annual visit

1506
01:42:31,624 --> 01:42:34,527
more than enough to suit
my taste for the present court.

1507
01:42:34,627 --> 01:42:35,903
I don't think
we shall remain

1508
01:42:36,003 --> 01:42:37,154
in London much
longer this year.

1509
01:42:37,254 --> 01:42:38,239
But—

1510
01:42:38,339 --> 01:42:42,410
It has, shall we say, too exhilarating
an effect upon your ladyship.

1511
01:42:42,510 --> 01:42:44,829
Ah, we have friends here.

1512
01:42:44,929 --> 01:42:47,206
Delightful to see you both.

1513
01:42:47,306 --> 01:42:49,834
We've been feeling
frightfully out of place here

1514
01:42:49,934 --> 01:42:51,836
among all these young people.

1515
01:42:51,936 --> 01:42:54,130
Oh, no offense, my dear.

1516
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:57,091
We've come to look on you
as one of us, you know.

1517
01:42:57,191 --> 01:42:59,135
Yes, I've noticed.

1518
01:42:59,235 --> 01:43:02,179
Yes. Good idea to sit down,
don't you think?

1519
01:43:02,279 --> 01:43:04,223
Find a quiet corner somewhere.

1520
01:43:04,323 --> 01:43:05,558
Splendid idea.

1521
01:43:05,658 --> 01:43:07,184
I want to tell her ladyship

1522
01:43:07,284 --> 01:43:10,312
all about our charity work
in the country.

1523
01:43:10,412 --> 01:43:14,191
My lord, if you're not dancing
with the countess, may I?

1524
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:16,068
You are under
a misconception, sir.

1525
01:43:16,168 --> 01:43:19,922
I am quite sure we have
never been introduced.

1526
01:43:22,341 --> 01:43:24,869
It'll take Charles himself
to pry her loose.

1527
01:43:24,969 --> 01:43:27,037
Pity he's not fishing
another stream tonight.

1528
01:43:27,137 --> 01:43:30,099
He may not know
what's running in home waters.

1529
01:43:39,024 --> 01:43:40,859
Your Majesty.

1530
01:43:48,993 --> 01:43:49,977
But, Charles,

1531
01:43:50,077 --> 01:43:52,229
you're not even dressed yet.

1532
01:43:52,329 --> 01:43:55,232
I've been firefighting
all afternoon down at the docks.

1533
01:43:55,332 --> 01:43:57,902
I'd have made a better
bargain for this throne

1534
01:43:58,002 --> 01:44:00,988
if I'd realized how much
they expect of a king.

1535
01:44:01,088 --> 01:44:03,449
You bring it on yourself, Charles.

1536
01:44:03,549 --> 01:44:05,951
No one forces you
to rush out of the palace,

1537
01:44:06,051 --> 01:44:09,997
bucket in hand, every time
some little blaze is reported.

1538
01:44:10,097 --> 01:44:11,916
It's more than a little
blaze this time.

1539
01:44:12,016 --> 01:44:13,959
It was still spreading
when I left.

1540
01:44:14,059 --> 01:44:15,503
The ball's already begun.

1541
01:44:15,603 --> 01:44:18,130
Shall I have someone
fetch your coat in here?

1542
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:19,840
No. The queen's
waiting for me.

1543
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:23,093
Queen? You're not
taking her to the ball, are you?

1544
01:44:23,193 --> 01:44:26,680
Yes. I trust you've provided
yourself with a suitable partner.

1545
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:30,242
Perhaps we shall have a dance
towards the end of the evening.

1546
01:44:31,577 --> 01:44:33,162
I'm not going.

1547
01:44:38,417 --> 01:44:43,088
I'm not going if you insist on bringing
that Portuguese scarecrow.

1548
01:44:44,923 --> 01:44:48,327
I had to send poor Fleurette
back to the country yesterday.

1549
01:44:48,427 --> 01:44:50,162
Oh, the one
with the fluffy ears?

1550
01:44:50,262 --> 01:44:51,997
She was the prettiest
of the lot.

1551
01:44:52,097 --> 01:44:54,333
Yes, but even her beauty
was small recompense

1552
01:44:54,433 --> 01:44:55,793
for the trouble she gave me.

1553
01:44:55,893 --> 01:44:57,102
Come, children.

1554
01:45:14,953 --> 01:45:19,375
Their most gracious majesties,
the king and queen.

1555
01:45:51,031 --> 01:45:54,143
Madam, you are making
a spectacle of yourself.

1556
01:45:54,243 --> 01:45:55,603
I don't care.

1557
01:45:55,703 --> 01:45:58,455
This is the first chance I've had
in a year to enjoy myself.

1558
01:46:06,922 --> 01:46:10,200
Uh, a report
on the, uh, fire, sire.

1559
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,244
Well, perhaps my guests
might be interested.

1560
01:46:12,344 --> 01:46:14,888
It's been such a dull season.

1561
01:46:16,473 --> 01:46:17,374
My lords...

1562
01:46:17,474 --> 01:46:19,335
ladies and gentlemen.

1563
01:46:19,435 --> 01:46:21,378
We have just received word

1564
01:46:21,478 --> 01:46:24,923
that the fire, fanned
by a strong east wind,

1565
01:46:25,023 --> 01:46:27,092
has reached Blackfriars.

1566
01:46:27,192 --> 01:46:29,511
St. Paul's is already aflame,

1567
01:46:29,611 --> 01:46:31,930
and so is the new exchange.

1568
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:35,451
Um... who's that
with old Radcliffee?

1569
01:46:36,493 --> 01:46:38,062
His wife, sire.

1570
01:46:40,456 --> 01:46:42,249
With your permission, madam.

1571
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:46,028
Your Majesty may
remember the occasion

1572
01:46:46,128 --> 01:46:48,739
when we first met...

1573
01:46:48,839 --> 01:46:51,241
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1574
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:55,746
Yes, yes.

1575
01:46:55,846 --> 01:46:57,431
Your Majesty.

1576
01:47:02,394 --> 01:47:04,755
I've changed
my mind, sire.

1577
01:47:04,855 --> 01:47:07,549
Your mind is rather
like your wardrobe, madam,

1578
01:47:07,649 --> 01:47:10,611
many changes and no surprises.

1579
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:24,358
It was most considerate of you,
my lord, to marry a beautiful woman.

1580
01:47:24,458 --> 01:47:25,943
You are very kind, sire.

1581
01:47:26,043 --> 01:47:28,237
We're all tired of looking
at the same faces.

1582
01:47:28,337 --> 01:47:30,589
And now if you'll
permit me, my lord.

1583
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:00,936
No gesture of loyalty
touches me so much

1584
01:48:01,036 --> 01:48:03,080
as a husband's generosity.

1585
01:48:05,874 --> 01:48:08,485
It's generous of Your Majesty
to notice me.

1586
01:48:08,585 --> 01:48:11,046
It's not the first time,
you'll recall.

1587
01:48:12,965 --> 01:48:15,033
I didn't think you would.

1588
01:48:15,133 --> 01:48:18,345
I do not often get refusals
to my invitations.

1589
01:48:20,138 --> 01:48:22,708
I was taken with
sudden illness that night.

1590
01:48:22,808 --> 01:48:26,311
So I was told, and I wondered
what his name was.

1591
01:48:35,821 --> 01:48:38,265
Once spurned, the man
is hesitant to try again

1592
01:48:38,365 --> 01:48:41,310
without some foreknowledge
of her response.

1593
01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:43,896
Well, it's difficult
for a woman to know

1594
01:48:43,996 --> 01:48:46,899
just where her first duty lies...

1595
01:48:46,999 --> 01:48:49,668
to her husband
or her sovereign.

1596
01:48:51,003 --> 01:48:53,322
Well, I try to be
a tolerant monarch,

1597
01:48:53,422 --> 01:48:56,758
and I always leave that decision
up to the individual.

1598
01:49:04,516 --> 01:49:06,101
My thanks, my lord.

1599
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:09,630
Perhaps it would be diverting
on your first visit to Whitehall

1600
01:49:09,730 --> 01:49:11,023
to stay for supper with us.

1601
01:49:12,149 --> 01:49:14,760
Oh, Your Majesty is very kind.

1602
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:16,094
I—

1603
01:49:16,194 --> 01:49:17,721
Your lordship, too, of course,

1604
01:49:17,821 --> 01:49:20,057
unless you would find
the late hour tiring.

1605
01:49:20,157 --> 01:49:23,519
I fear that is the case, sire.
You must forgive us.

1606
01:49:23,619 --> 01:49:25,521
Well, then let the countess stay.

1607
01:49:25,621 --> 01:49:28,565
You may be sure that she will
have a proper escort home.

1608
01:49:28,665 --> 01:49:30,275
Would you like that, madam?

1609
01:49:30,375 --> 01:49:31,777
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.

1610
01:49:31,877 --> 01:49:35,405
Milady is carried away
by Your Majesty's kindness,

1611
01:49:35,505 --> 01:49:37,574
but we are still in the first year
of our marriage

1612
01:49:37,674 --> 01:49:40,035
and make it a rule
never to be separated,

1613
01:49:40,135 --> 01:49:41,495
even for an hour.

1614
01:49:41,595 --> 01:49:45,332
We will go home together...
with Your Majesty's permission.

1615
01:49:45,432 --> 01:49:47,835
If I may disagree with you, sir,

1616
01:49:47,935 --> 01:49:50,838
it hardly seems fitting
to allow our private customs

1617
01:49:50,938 --> 01:49:53,090
to interfere with
the desires of the king.

1618
01:49:53,190 --> 01:49:55,551
Your devotion is
most gratifying, madam,

1619
01:49:55,651 --> 01:49:58,345
and while my suggestion
is in no sense a command—

1620
01:49:58,445 --> 01:50:00,973
In that case, sire,
we will take our leave now.

1621
01:50:01,073 --> 01:50:03,851
The news of the fire
has given me some alarm

1622
01:50:03,951 --> 01:50:05,894
since Radcliffee House
is, unfortunately,

1623
01:50:05,994 --> 01:50:09,831
much nearer to the endangered
area than Whitehall.

1624
01:50:21,635 --> 01:50:25,747
Sire. May I have permission to present
to Your Most Gracious Majesty

1625
01:50:25,847 --> 01:50:27,683
my ladies Elizabeth...

1626
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:31,353
and Rosemary Seymour.

1627
01:51:01,299 --> 01:51:04,036
I hope you have
a good night's rest, madam.

1628
01:51:04,136 --> 01:51:05,971
Thank you, my lord.

1629
01:51:12,769 --> 01:51:17,841
Amber, I didn't expect
you home so early.

1630
01:51:17,941 --> 01:51:19,593
I saw little Bruce.

1631
01:51:19,693 --> 01:51:22,554
He's well and happy,
but lonely, too.

1632
01:51:22,654 --> 01:51:24,906
He hopes you'll go
and see him soon.

1633
01:51:34,458 --> 01:51:38,362
Nan, watch his lordship's room.

1634
01:51:38,462 --> 01:51:39,696
As soon as his lights are out,

1635
01:51:39,796 --> 01:51:42,157
call me a hackney coach
to the corner.

1636
01:51:42,257 --> 01:51:43,867
I'm going back to the palace.

1637
01:51:43,967 --> 01:51:45,744
- Oh, Amber, you shouldn't.
- Well, why not?

1638
01:51:45,844 --> 01:51:47,412
Why, he'll find out.

1639
01:51:47,512 --> 01:51:49,039
Suppose he does.
What can he do?

1640
01:51:49,139 --> 01:51:51,708
Kill us all, that's what.
He's a devil.

1641
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,977
Stop jabbering
and do as I say.

1642
01:52:10,243 --> 01:52:11,912
Who's there?

1643
01:52:31,056 --> 01:52:32,349
Nan!

1644
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:34,601
Nan!

1645
01:52:36,586 --> 01:52:37,587
Nan!

1646
01:52:37,687 --> 01:52:40,065
Quickly! Quickly!

1647
01:52:40,857 --> 01:52:42,484
Next wagon!

1648
01:52:49,157 --> 01:52:50,700
Next wagon!

1649
01:53:14,307 --> 01:53:16,793
You bumbling lugs,
be more careful!

1650
01:53:16,893 --> 01:53:18,378
Galeazzo! Galeazzo!

1651
01:53:18,478 --> 01:53:20,172
Si, signore.

1652
01:53:20,272 --> 01:53:22,841
Where did you find
these clumsy fools?

1653
01:53:22,941 --> 01:53:24,301
I'm sorry, Excellence,

1654
01:53:24,401 --> 01:53:26,720
but these are the best people
I could find.

1655
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:29,222
These people are ruining
all my treasures.

1656
01:53:29,322 --> 01:53:31,308
But, signore,
they're trying very hard.

1657
01:53:31,408 --> 01:53:33,268
Begging your pardon,
your lordship,

1658
01:53:33,368 --> 01:53:34,853
but my lady's
upstairs alone.

1659
01:53:34,953 --> 01:53:37,122
Mind your own affairs.

1660
01:53:53,847 --> 01:53:55,473
Get your clothing.

1661
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:59,336
Where are we going?

1662
01:53:59,436 --> 01:54:00,896
To the country.

1663
01:54:02,063 --> 01:54:03,481
This time for good.

1664
01:54:05,066 --> 01:54:07,094
I see now
it may be a lifelong task

1665
01:54:07,194 --> 01:54:09,763
to teach you the deference
due to your lord and husband.

1666
01:54:09,863 --> 01:54:12,199
Husband?

1667
01:54:13,742 --> 01:54:17,104
Do you take
that mummery seriously?

1668
01:54:17,204 --> 01:54:19,356
We made a bargain,

1669
01:54:19,456 --> 01:54:21,566
and, believe me, it's cost me
more than it has you.

1670
01:54:21,666 --> 01:54:25,028
However that may be, you
are the Countess of Radcliffe.

1671
01:54:25,128 --> 01:54:26,988
You share
my name and my honor.

1672
01:54:27,088 --> 01:54:28,698
There's no part of our bargain

1673
01:54:28,798 --> 01:54:31,259
that I should submit
to humiliation and indignity.

1674
01:54:32,344 --> 01:54:35,413
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1675
01:54:35,513 --> 01:54:38,391
Perhaps the emotion
is foreign to you.

1676
01:54:39,434 --> 01:54:42,337
It is a matter of pride.

1677
01:54:42,437 --> 01:54:43,922
Pride?

1678
01:54:44,022 --> 01:54:47,050
Who would expect pride in you?

1679
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:50,387
I should have thought
it had dried up years ago,

1680
01:54:50,487 --> 01:54:52,197
together with the rest of you.

1681
01:54:54,574 --> 01:54:55,934
I am your husband, madam,

1682
01:54:56,034 --> 01:54:57,894
and will be spoken to
with respect.

1683
01:54:57,994 --> 01:54:59,437
I'll show you respect,

1684
01:54:59,537 --> 01:55:01,414
the only kind of respect
you understand.

1685
01:55:04,834 --> 01:55:07,629
Get out of here. Get out!

1686
01:55:09,256 --> 01:55:11,466
You filthy...

1687
01:55:13,385 --> 01:55:16,012
The fire.

1688
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:24,129
Yes. The fire.

1689
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:26,940
The flame,
at least, is clean.

1690
01:55:28,817 --> 01:55:29,901
No!

1691
01:55:31,027 --> 01:55:33,154
You've made your choice,
madam.

1692
01:55:39,786 --> 01:55:41,438
Galeazzo!

1693
01:55:41,538 --> 01:55:44,040
No! Galeazzo!

1694
01:55:45,208 --> 01:55:46,793
You're mad!

1695
01:55:47,919 --> 01:55:50,255
No! No!

1696
01:55:53,967 --> 01:55:56,678
Amber!
Amber, come quick!

1697
01:56:12,277 --> 01:56:14,095
Non, non, non, non. Merci.

1698
01:56:14,195 --> 01:56:16,156
C'est parfait,
Monsieur Louis.

1699
01:56:17,907 --> 01:56:19,559
Oh, Sir Robert.

1700
01:56:19,659 --> 01:56:22,187
You sent me a present
yesterday, didn't you?

1701
01:56:22,287 --> 01:56:24,773
This bracelet, I believe.

1702
01:56:24,873 --> 01:56:28,735
Just a trifle one of my ancestors
brought back from the Crusades.

1703
01:56:28,835 --> 01:56:31,696
And what is it that you
seek from His Majesty?

1704
01:56:31,796 --> 01:56:35,158
I seek nothing, my lady,
that is, for myself,

1705
01:56:35,258 --> 01:56:37,327
but my youngest brother
is getting married,

1706
01:56:37,427 --> 01:56:39,512
and there's a post
at the admiralty—

1707
01:56:40,722 --> 01:56:43,183
Oh, good morrow, darling.

1708
01:56:44,893 --> 01:56:46,461
My services, madam.

1709
01:56:46,561 --> 01:56:49,965
Oh, Bruce.
Bruce, my darling.

1710
01:56:50,065 --> 01:56:53,735
Darling.
How is my angel today?

1711
01:56:56,279 --> 01:56:57,973
Gentlemen.

1712
01:56:58,073 --> 01:56:59,657
- My lord.
- My lord.

1713
01:57:02,619 --> 01:57:05,146
Upon my word, I've never
seen such a pretty child.

1714
01:57:05,246 --> 01:57:07,357
Are you going
for your walk, Bruce?

1715
01:57:07,457 --> 01:57:10,193
Will you go with us today?
Please, Mother.

1716
01:57:10,293 --> 01:57:13,196
Oh, darling, that's
a very gallant invitation,

1717
01:57:13,296 --> 01:57:16,324
but I'm already bespoken
to another gentleman.

1718
01:57:16,424 --> 01:57:17,659
Yes, Mother.

1719
01:57:17,759 --> 01:57:20,662
You'll always be my cavalier,
though, won't you, darling?

1720
01:57:20,762 --> 01:57:22,580
Yes, Mother.

1721
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:25,583
Remember, Nan, he's not to play
with any of the other children

1722
01:57:25,683 --> 01:57:26,960
unless you know
their name and rank.

1723
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:30,230
Yes, my lady. The last boy
who blacked his eye was a duke.

1724
01:57:34,776 --> 01:57:36,177
Good morrow, Bruce.

1725
01:57:36,277 --> 01:57:37,512
Good morrow, sire.

1726
01:57:37,612 --> 01:57:39,639
Od's fish, none of my children

1727
01:57:39,739 --> 01:57:42,142
have the royal manners
that you display,

1728
01:57:42,242 --> 01:57:44,869
but, then,
neither did their mothers.

1729
01:57:47,747 --> 01:57:49,649
Are you ready,
my dear?

1730
01:57:49,749 --> 01:57:52,152
As always, sire.
Whenever you are.

1731
01:57:52,252 --> 01:57:55,155
A slight exaggeration, madam,
but then I've always felt

1732
01:57:55,255 --> 01:57:57,615
that the traditional
prerogatives of a king

1733
01:57:57,715 --> 01:58:00,677
should be subordinate to
those of a beautiful woman.

1734
01:58:13,898 --> 01:58:16,426
There, now,
children, children.

1735
01:58:16,526 --> 01:58:18,762
What distressing behavior.

1736
01:58:18,862 --> 01:58:20,889
I fear they're set
a bad example

1737
01:58:20,989 --> 01:58:22,949
by the gentlemen
of our court.

1738
01:58:25,452 --> 01:58:27,604
It was a mild jest,
I'll admit,

1739
01:58:27,704 --> 01:58:29,706
but at least it might
warrant a smile.

1740
01:58:31,374 --> 01:58:33,860
Od's fish, if it isn't
that rascal Carlton.

1741
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:35,336
And who's the wench
with him?

1742
01:58:38,089 --> 01:58:40,925
Sir Thomas,
bring them here.

1743
01:58:49,184 --> 01:58:53,188
My Lord Carlton,
His Majesty desires your presence.

1744
01:59:00,236 --> 01:59:02,180
Welcome back to England,
Carlton.

1745
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:04,140
Your Majesty.

1746
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:06,643
Well, won't you present
the young lady?

1747
01:59:06,743 --> 01:59:08,144
Yes, sire.

1748
01:59:08,244 --> 01:59:10,605
I have the honor
to present my wife.

1749
01:59:10,705 --> 01:59:13,108
My services, madam.
My congratulations to you, Carlton.

1750
01:59:13,208 --> 01:59:15,235
I had no word
of your marriage.

1751
01:59:15,335 --> 01:59:16,653
Well, that's hardly
strange, sire.

1752
01:59:16,753 --> 01:59:19,155
We were married only
last year in Virginia.

1753
01:59:19,255 --> 01:59:22,367
Virginia. If my Lady Carlton
is a fair sample

1754
01:59:22,467 --> 01:59:24,285
of what we're breeding
across the seas,

1755
01:59:24,385 --> 01:59:28,123
I must learn to pay more attention
to colonial affairs.

1756
01:59:28,223 --> 01:59:30,725
My Lady Radcliffe,
my Lord and Lady Carlton.

1757
01:59:37,732 --> 01:59:40,260
My Lady Radcliffe and I
are old friends.

1758
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:44,514
Indeed. What brings you
back home, Carlton?

1759
01:59:44,614 --> 01:59:46,474
Business and pleasure, sire.

1760
01:59:46,574 --> 01:59:48,184
We've settled in Virginia,

1761
01:59:48,284 --> 01:59:50,353
and I'm disposing
of my properties here.

1762
01:59:50,453 --> 01:59:54,107
Also, this is Lady Carlton's
first glimpse of London.

1763
01:59:54,207 --> 01:59:56,568
That should be almost
as notable an event

1764
01:59:56,668 --> 01:59:59,154
as London's first glimpse
of Lady Carlton.

1765
01:59:59,254 --> 02:00:02,449
I trust your visit will be long enough
so that we may have other glimpses.

1766
02:00:02,549 --> 02:00:04,993
Your Majesty's kindness
would be overwhelming

1767
02:00:05,093 --> 02:00:07,912
had I not been prepared
for it by all accounts.

1768
02:00:08,012 --> 02:00:11,708
You hear that? They must be rogues
who say America's a barbarous land.

1769
02:00:11,808 --> 02:00:13,668
Yes, sire.

1770
02:00:13,768 --> 02:00:16,921
My Lady Carlton
is a complete surprise.

1771
02:00:17,021 --> 02:00:19,357
You will hear
from us, my lord.

1772
02:00:21,025 --> 02:00:22,277
My dear.

1773
02:00:25,738 --> 02:00:26,738
Come, children.

1774
02:00:29,784 --> 02:00:31,895
- Is there no answer yet?
- No.

1775
02:00:31,995 --> 02:00:33,897
A servant took the message,
like the others.

1776
02:00:33,997 --> 02:00:36,107
He says they've all been delivered
into Lord Carlton's hands.

1777
02:00:36,207 --> 02:00:39,694
I don't believe it.
He would have come.

1778
02:00:39,794 --> 02:00:41,696
He might not want to, Amber.

1779
02:00:41,796 --> 02:00:43,239
Why not?

1780
02:00:43,339 --> 02:00:45,200
Nothing's changed
between Bruce and me.

1781
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:46,993
Nothing could ever
change it.

1782
02:00:47,093 --> 02:00:48,620
Not even a wife?

1783
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:50,205
I've been married myself.

1784
02:00:50,305 --> 02:00:52,624
Yes, but he might
also be in love.

1785
02:00:52,724 --> 02:00:55,268
Bruce?
Don't be ridiculous.

1786
02:01:00,565 --> 02:01:03,468
I wonder if he thought
I looked old.

1787
02:01:03,568 --> 02:01:06,279
He knows I'm almost 25.

1788
02:01:07,947 --> 02:01:09,265
Lord Carlton, my lady.

1789
02:01:09,365 --> 02:01:11,559
I'll be out directly.

1790
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:13,186
There, Nan, you see?

1791
02:01:13,286 --> 02:01:16,080
I told you nothing had changed.
Help me, quickly.

1792
02:01:21,753 --> 02:01:24,005
Her ladyship
will see you, my lord.

1793
02:01:31,638 --> 02:01:33,306
Bruce?

1794
02:01:38,311 --> 02:01:40,088
My services, my lord.

1795
02:01:40,188 --> 02:01:43,258
Well, Bruce, don't
you remember me?

1796
02:01:43,358 --> 02:01:44,592
No.

1797
02:01:44,692 --> 02:01:47,679
- Well, I'm your father, lad.
- From America, my lord?

1798
02:01:47,779 --> 02:01:51,491
Yes. Here,
let me look at you.

1799
02:01:52,909 --> 02:01:54,727
You were only a baby
the last time.

1800
02:01:54,827 --> 02:01:56,437
Now you're half a man.

1801
02:01:56,537 --> 02:02:00,525
Next year I'm to be a page at court
like my Lady Castlemaine's sons.

1802
02:02:00,625 --> 02:02:02,944
Will that be fun,
do you think?

1803
02:02:03,044 --> 02:02:04,821
I don't know.

1804
02:02:04,921 --> 02:02:07,907
I suppose you have to wait
until you're grown up to have fun.

1805
02:02:08,007 --> 02:02:10,451
I brought you a present.

1806
02:02:10,551 --> 02:02:12,245
A tomahawk.

1807
02:02:12,345 --> 02:02:14,455
A tomahawk?
Thank you, my lord.

1808
02:02:14,555 --> 02:02:16,249
Just like the Indians use.

1809
02:02:16,349 --> 02:02:18,960
Do you know any Indians?

1810
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:22,438
Yes. There's a boy just your age
who goes fishing in our river.

1811
02:02:27,485 --> 02:02:29,679
Go along to Nan now,
Bruce.

1812
02:02:29,779 --> 02:02:31,197
Yes, Mother.

1813
02:02:44,836 --> 02:02:46,796
Pray, sit down, my lord.

1814
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:55,413
We've come a long way
since Marygreen.

1815
02:02:55,513 --> 02:02:57,373
We have at that.

1816
02:02:57,473 --> 02:03:00,793
I've been meaning to pay
you a visit for several days.

1817
02:03:00,893 --> 02:03:02,211
I understand, Bruce.

1818
02:03:02,311 --> 02:03:04,297
I know it's rather
awkward for you.

1819
02:03:04,397 --> 02:03:06,424
Do you want to explain
how it happened,

1820
02:03:06,524 --> 02:03:08,635
or shall we just forget
about her entirely?

1821
02:03:08,735 --> 02:03:09,927
Corinna?

1822
02:03:10,027 --> 02:03:12,055
I don't know what
there is to explain.

1823
02:03:12,155 --> 02:03:16,351
I can guess most of it.
She's very rich, isn't she?

1824
02:03:16,451 --> 02:03:18,102
No. Rather the contrary.

1825
02:03:18,202 --> 02:03:20,605
Her father's
quite a small planter.

1826
02:03:20,705 --> 02:03:22,815
But... then why did you—

1827
02:03:22,915 --> 02:03:25,068
I didn't come here to
discuss my marriage, Amber.

1828
02:03:25,168 --> 02:03:27,570
I came to talk to you
about Bruce.

1829
02:03:27,670 --> 02:03:29,822
Have you given any
thought to his future?

1830
02:03:29,922 --> 02:03:33,660
But of course I have.
He'll be the Earl of Radcliffe.

1831
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:36,412
Charles has approved
the succession.

1832
02:03:36,512 --> 02:03:39,123
He might even be made a duke.

1833
02:03:39,223 --> 02:03:42,502
A title has its advantages,
that's true,

1834
02:03:42,602 --> 02:03:45,046
but I wonder
if it quite makes up

1835
02:03:45,146 --> 02:03:47,548
for the lack of a name.

1836
02:03:47,648 --> 02:03:49,842
You might have given him
your name once,

1837
02:03:49,942 --> 02:03:51,511
but now that you've married—

1838
02:03:51,611 --> 02:03:53,513
It's still not too late.

1839
02:03:53,613 --> 02:03:55,431
What do you mean?

1840
02:03:55,531 --> 02:03:58,059
It isn't an easy thing
to ask of you,

1841
02:03:58,159 --> 02:04:00,520
but, Amber,
we both love him.

1842
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:02,397
We want the best for him.

1843
02:04:02,497 --> 02:04:06,150
I'd like to adopt him
and take him back to Virginia.

1844
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:07,568
Bruce?

1845
02:04:07,668 --> 02:04:09,487
It's a sick age we live in.

1846
02:04:09,587 --> 02:04:11,614
We've both been touched
by the sickness,

1847
02:04:11,714 --> 02:04:14,158
but perhaps our boy
can be spared it.

1848
02:04:14,258 --> 02:04:16,077
In Virginia,
he can start afresh,

1849
02:04:16,177 --> 02:04:18,079
free from whispers
and scandal.

1850
02:04:18,179 --> 02:04:20,540
Whispering does a duke no harm.

1851
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:24,961
For the next 8 or 10 years,
the duke will be a growing boy.

1852
02:04:25,061 --> 02:04:29,215
How are you going to explain
a growing boy to your wife?

1853
02:04:29,315 --> 02:04:31,175
I already have.

1854
02:04:31,275 --> 02:04:34,011
You— You've told her...
about me?

1855
02:04:34,111 --> 02:04:36,013
Not by name,
of course.

1856
02:04:36,113 --> 02:04:40,476
Oh! Just some nameless wench
that you took pity on

1857
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:42,854
and kept out of
the rain one night.

1858
02:04:42,954 --> 02:04:45,273
I think I stayed
as close to the facts

1859
02:04:45,373 --> 02:04:48,109
as a husband ever does
under the circumstances.

1860
02:04:48,209 --> 02:04:49,610
He's my son,

1861
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:52,488
and I'm not going to turn him
over to this wife of yours.

1862
02:04:52,588 --> 02:04:55,783
She'd hate him. She'd make his life
miserable because he's mine.

1863
02:04:55,883 --> 02:04:57,577
You wouldn't say that
if you knew her.

1864
02:04:57,677 --> 02:04:59,412
She's no saint,
I'll warrant you.

1865
02:04:59,512 --> 02:05:01,873
Certainly not unless
I've been grossly deceived.

1866
02:05:01,973 --> 02:05:05,126
You think she's a different sort
of person from me, don't you?

1867
02:05:05,226 --> 02:05:07,587
You don't believe she'd
do exactly what I've done

1868
02:05:07,687 --> 02:05:09,213
under the same conditions?

1869
02:05:09,313 --> 02:05:11,716
I'm not making comparisons.
That wouldn't be fair.

1870
02:05:11,816 --> 02:05:13,176
I am making comparisons,

1871
02:05:13,276 --> 02:05:15,136
and I'll wager you
she's no more virtuous

1872
02:05:15,236 --> 02:05:17,346
underneath that
smug look than I am.

1873
02:05:17,446 --> 02:05:18,681
Listen, Amber,

1874
02:05:18,781 --> 02:05:22,101
don't decide anything as important
as this when you're upset.

1875
02:05:22,201 --> 02:05:25,646
I'm riding to Essex this afternoon
to settle my estate there.

1876
02:05:25,746 --> 02:05:28,649
I only ask you, before you
give me your final answer,

1877
02:05:28,749 --> 02:05:31,502
try to think of the boy a little, too.

1878
02:06:35,149 --> 02:06:37,385
Of course everyone
in London was there.

1879
02:06:37,485 --> 02:06:39,637
And when Castlemaine
came in with a strange man,

1880
02:06:39,737 --> 02:06:41,889
I tell you tongues were wagging.

1881
02:06:41,989 --> 02:06:44,600
And what do you think
he turned out to be?

1882
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:46,561
A dancer.
A common dancer.

1883
02:06:46,661 --> 02:06:49,647
No one expects Castlemaine
to show any taste,

1884
02:06:49,747 --> 02:06:52,233
but you'd think
she could do better than that.

1885
02:06:52,333 --> 02:06:55,403
Perhaps my Lady Carlton
finds our court scandal tiresome.

1886
02:06:55,503 --> 02:06:57,446
Oh, but I don't, Your Majesty,

1887
02:06:57,546 --> 02:06:59,574
since we have nothing
like that in the colonies.

1888
02:06:59,674 --> 02:07:02,577
What on earth
do you do for amusement?

1889
02:07:02,677 --> 02:07:05,079
Bruce and I manage
to entertain ourselves,

1890
02:07:05,179 --> 02:07:07,081
and there's so much to be done,

1891
02:07:07,181 --> 02:07:09,917
land to clear and plot,
buildings to raise.

1892
02:07:10,017 --> 02:07:12,128
Why, we're busy
from sunrise to sunset.

1893
02:07:12,228 --> 02:07:15,089
A reversal of our customs
here in London.

1894
02:07:15,189 --> 02:07:17,717
We just built a new room
for Bruce

1895
02:07:17,817 --> 02:07:20,094
where he can be alone
when he feels like it.

1896
02:07:20,194 --> 02:07:22,613
You're a shrewd
as well as a devoted wife.

1897
02:07:23,656 --> 02:07:25,683
Any man likes to have
a place of his own

1898
02:07:25,783 --> 02:07:28,185
where he can escape
his women.

1899
02:07:28,285 --> 02:07:31,314
But naturally,
a woman likes to know

1900
02:07:31,414 --> 02:07:34,358
just what he's escaping to.

1901
02:07:34,458 --> 02:07:36,485
Don't you find it so
with his lordship?

1902
02:07:36,585 --> 02:07:38,696
I'm interested in everything
he does, my lady,

1903
02:07:38,796 --> 02:07:41,490
and everything
he ever has done.

1904
02:07:41,590 --> 02:07:44,076
Uh, Charles, if you don't mind,

1905
02:07:44,176 --> 02:07:46,954
I've had a raging
headache all evening.

1906
02:07:47,054 --> 02:07:48,581
With your permission,
I'll retire.

1907
02:07:48,681 --> 02:07:50,708
But, of course, my dear,
if you're not well.

1908
02:07:50,808 --> 02:07:53,252
Perhaps you could send
Lady Carlton home for me.

1909
02:07:53,352 --> 02:07:56,213
Good night, my lady.
It was so good of you to come.

1910
02:07:56,313 --> 02:07:58,607
It was good of you
to ask me, my lady.

1911
02:08:11,746 --> 02:08:13,856
Oh, Sir Thomas.

1912
02:08:13,956 --> 02:08:17,568
His Majesty most expressly
wishes not to be disturbed.

1913
02:08:17,668 --> 02:08:20,488
But, my lady, a communication
from the Dutch ambassador.

1914
02:08:20,588 --> 02:08:23,532
I suggest that you
wait until morning.

1915
02:08:23,632 --> 02:08:25,051
Very well.

1916
02:08:26,594 --> 02:08:28,913
How well do you know
my Lady Radcliffe?

1917
02:08:29,013 --> 02:08:31,499
Tonight is the second time
I've seen her.

1918
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:34,126
You heard your husband say
they were old friends.

1919
02:08:34,226 --> 02:08:35,503
Yes, sire.

1920
02:08:35,603 --> 02:08:37,380
Her son is called Bruce,

1921
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:39,882
an unusual name,
save in Scotland.

1922
02:08:39,982 --> 02:08:41,634
Yes, sire.

1923
02:08:41,734 --> 02:08:44,595
I found her sudden headache
tonight quite extraordinary

1924
02:08:44,695 --> 02:08:47,640
in the presence
of a potential rival.

1925
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:49,433
I assure Your Majesty

1926
02:08:49,533 --> 02:08:52,019
no thought of such a rivalry
has entered my mind.

1927
02:08:52,119 --> 02:08:54,105
We are discussing
my Lady Radcliffe's mind,

1928
02:08:54,205 --> 02:08:56,065
which is
a very different mechanism.

1929
02:08:56,165 --> 02:08:59,110
I believe that its workings
have brought us together

1930
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:01,112
in what,
you are doubtless aware,

1931
02:09:01,212 --> 02:09:02,655
is a highly compromising
situation.

1932
02:09:02,755 --> 02:09:04,365
I am aware of it.

1933
02:09:04,465 --> 02:09:05,992
And you're not afraid?

1934
02:09:06,092 --> 02:09:08,160
Do I appear afraid?

1935
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:12,456
Would you be if you knew
that at this moment

1936
02:09:12,556 --> 02:09:15,084
a message is probably on its way
to my Lord Carlton

1937
02:09:15,184 --> 02:09:17,086
informing him
of your whereabouts?

1938
02:09:17,186 --> 02:09:19,547
Do you think
she would do that?

1939
02:09:19,647 --> 02:09:21,732
I think she's already done it.

1940
02:09:22,983 --> 02:09:24,885
She must hate me terribly.

1941
02:09:24,985 --> 02:09:27,304
There can be little doubt
about that.

1942
02:09:27,404 --> 02:09:30,307
It's difficult to know what to do,

1943
02:09:30,407 --> 02:09:33,394
though I'm sure you should
return at once to your lodgings.

1944
02:09:33,494 --> 02:09:35,813
It would seem
the wiser course.

1945
02:09:35,913 --> 02:09:38,315
Though a regrettable necessity.

1946
02:09:38,415 --> 02:09:40,443
I take that
as a compliment, sire.

1947
02:09:40,543 --> 02:09:43,112
It was so intended.

1948
02:09:43,212 --> 02:09:45,740
I've never been overfond
of your husband.

1949
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:49,160
Perhaps our tastes
are too similar,

1950
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:53,414
but please convey to him my best
wishes for his future happiness

1951
02:09:53,514 --> 02:09:56,725
and my most sincere
congratulations.

1952
02:10:04,942 --> 02:10:06,343
Thank you, sire.

1953
02:10:06,443 --> 02:10:07,470
Good night.

1954
02:10:07,570 --> 02:10:09,263
Good night, Your Majesty.

1955
02:10:09,363 --> 02:10:11,015
I wonder.

1956
02:10:11,115 --> 02:10:12,808
Yes, sire?

1957
02:10:12,908 --> 02:10:16,020
If we hadn't realized
we were victims of a plot,

1958
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:18,981
if you had simply
been my guest here tonight,

1959
02:10:19,081 --> 02:10:21,192
what might the result
have been?

1960
02:10:21,292 --> 02:10:24,211
It's a pity that we shall
never know, Your Majesty.

1961
02:10:26,213 --> 02:10:29,617
You will find a door
at the foot of the stairs.

1962
02:10:29,717 --> 02:10:32,052
There is always
a carriage waiting.

1963
02:10:54,158 --> 02:10:58,145
Why, Charles,
where's my Lady Carlton?

1964
02:10:58,245 --> 02:11:02,233
I sent her home,
as you requested.

1965
02:11:02,333 --> 02:11:05,486
I'm really very grateful to you
for bringing her here.

1966
02:11:05,586 --> 02:11:08,114
Women like that are
rare enough at any time,

1967
02:11:08,214 --> 02:11:10,032
but in these days,
they're as scarce

1968
02:11:10,132 --> 02:11:11,659
as lovelocks
on a Roundhead.

1969
02:11:11,759 --> 02:11:14,328
A faithful wife, Amber.

1970
02:11:14,428 --> 02:11:16,580
I never thought
to see one in Whitehall.

1971
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:18,999
You mean
she pretended to be faithful.

1972
02:11:19,099 --> 02:11:21,085
It was no pretense
if I'm a judge,

1973
02:11:21,185 --> 02:11:23,003
and I believe I am.

1974
02:11:23,103 --> 02:11:26,090
I think you'd better
not send that letter.

1975
02:11:26,190 --> 02:11:28,551
We made a mistake,
Amber, you and I.

1976
02:11:28,651 --> 02:11:31,637
For you, I fear it will prove
a costly mistake.

1977
02:11:31,737 --> 02:11:32,888
Charles.

1978
02:11:32,988 --> 02:11:35,558
The affront to my dignity
I might forgive.

1979
02:11:35,658 --> 02:11:37,601
Perhaps,
granted the moral level

1980
02:11:37,701 --> 02:11:39,478
I've permitted
this court to sink to,

1981
02:11:39,578 --> 02:11:42,356
even a king should expect
to be used as a pawn

1982
02:11:42,456 --> 02:11:44,108
in a dirty game,

1983
02:11:44,208 --> 02:11:46,777
but I'm not only a king.

1984
02:11:46,877 --> 02:11:48,362
I should know that.

1985
02:11:48,462 --> 02:11:49,905
But do you?

1986
02:11:50,005 --> 02:11:52,992
Of course I do, Charles,
and I love you.

1987
02:11:53,092 --> 02:11:55,077
I wish you did, my dear,

1988
02:11:55,177 --> 02:11:57,721
but you don't,
and you never have.

1989
02:11:58,764 --> 02:12:01,225
I don't blame you
for loving him,

1990
02:12:02,142 --> 02:12:04,436
but I cannot
forgive you for it.

1991
02:12:05,396 --> 02:12:06,714
If I hadn't been king,

1992
02:12:06,814 --> 02:12:08,924
I might have managed
sometime in my life

1993
02:12:09,024 --> 02:12:11,135
to fall in love myself,

1994
02:12:11,235 --> 02:12:14,805
but instead I've had to create
an illusion of happiness.

1995
02:12:14,905 --> 02:12:18,284
I've had to pretend to love,
pretend to be loved.

1996
02:12:19,493 --> 02:12:21,854
At best,
it was a fragile device,

1997
02:12:21,954 --> 02:12:25,024
too easily shattered,
as you've shattered it tonight.

1998
02:12:25,124 --> 02:12:28,068
Oh, Charles, I didn't mean to. I—

1999
02:12:28,168 --> 02:12:31,864
I know you didn't,
but it cannot be mended now.

2000
02:12:31,964 --> 02:12:35,618
You will have to make
arrangements to leave Whitehall.

2001
02:12:35,718 --> 02:12:38,929
I will undertake to make
some provision for your journey.

2002
02:12:40,347 --> 02:12:41,807
Come, children.

2003
02:12:57,781 --> 02:13:00,226
Mother, what is it, Mother?

2004
02:13:00,326 --> 02:13:01,685
Are we going away?

2005
02:13:01,785 --> 02:13:04,246
Yes, Bruce. Yes, darling.

2006
02:13:05,414 --> 02:13:07,274
You've been crying, Mother.

2007
02:13:07,374 --> 02:13:10,277
Oh, it's nothing, Bruce.
When you grow older,

2008
02:13:10,377 --> 02:13:13,572
you'll learn that women are
always crying for no reason.

2009
02:13:13,672 --> 02:13:16,033
Darling, we're going
to the country.

2010
02:13:16,133 --> 02:13:19,536
Perhaps you won't like it
as much as you do here.

2011
02:13:19,636 --> 02:13:22,623
Oh, but I will if you're there.

2012
02:13:22,723 --> 02:13:25,626
Oh, I want you to be happy.

2013
02:13:25,726 --> 02:13:29,004
We can be happy together,
just the two of us, can't we?

2014
02:13:29,104 --> 02:13:30,898
Yes?

2015
02:13:32,232 --> 02:13:34,134
Sir Thomas Dudley,
my lady.

2016
02:13:34,234 --> 02:13:36,612
Run along now, darling.

2017
02:13:47,247 --> 02:13:50,651
His Majesty has placed a coach
at your disposal, my lady.

2018
02:13:50,751 --> 02:13:53,195
As soon as you finish
packing, let me know.

2019
02:13:53,295 --> 02:13:54,571
Yes, Sir Thomas.

2020
02:13:54,671 --> 02:13:58,826
Of course, it isn't necessary
for you to leave London at once.

2021
02:13:58,926 --> 02:14:00,661
What else can I do?

2022
02:14:00,761 --> 02:14:02,663
May I be so bold as to inquire

2023
02:14:02,763 --> 02:14:05,182
if your ladyship is free
for supper this evening?

2024
02:14:06,225 --> 02:14:08,585
You're quite bold, Sir Thomas,

2025
02:14:08,685 --> 02:14:10,879
and hasty almost
to the point of indecency.

2026
02:14:10,979 --> 02:14:12,881
I hope your ladyship
will forgive a haste

2027
02:14:12,981 --> 02:14:14,733
which is born of ardor.

2028
02:14:18,612 --> 02:14:19,638
My lord.

2029
02:14:19,738 --> 02:14:20,989
Sir Thomas.

2030
02:14:22,908 --> 02:14:25,019
I've come sooner
than I intended, Amber.

2031
02:14:25,119 --> 02:14:27,688
We've decided to sail
for Virginia tomorrow.

2032
02:14:27,788 --> 02:14:29,231
Tomorrow?

2033
02:14:29,331 --> 02:14:31,191
Yes. I've finished
my business here,

2034
02:14:31,291 --> 02:14:34,153
and my wife doesn't seem
to find London as exciting

2035
02:14:34,253 --> 02:14:37,948
as I thought she would,
so I'd like your answer now.

2036
02:14:38,048 --> 02:14:39,616
It's no different, Bruce.

2037
02:14:39,716 --> 02:14:41,744
You can't have him.

2038
02:14:41,844 --> 02:14:44,163
I have no right to insist.

2039
02:14:44,263 --> 02:14:47,207
The only reason I do
is I think we'd...

2040
02:14:47,307 --> 02:14:50,753
both like to give him
a better start than... this.

2041
02:14:50,853 --> 02:14:56,967
Bruce, you don't know anything
about the start he did have.

2042
02:14:57,067 --> 02:15:00,846
Let me tell you some things
you don't know about your son.

2043
02:15:00,946 --> 02:15:03,057
He was born
in a den of thieves.

2044
02:15:03,157 --> 02:15:05,017
His godfather
was a highwayman,

2045
02:15:05,117 --> 02:15:07,102
and he had a murderess
for attendant,

2046
02:15:07,202 --> 02:15:09,980
and if I hadn't gone out
and stolen for him,

2047
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:11,523
he'd have died there.

2048
02:15:11,623 --> 02:15:15,527
You make me understand better than
I did how much I'm asking of you,

2049
02:15:15,627 --> 02:15:17,529
but I still ask it, Amber.

2050
02:15:17,629 --> 02:15:19,448
And I still say no.

2051
02:15:19,548 --> 02:15:22,326
What makes you think
he'd leave me anyway?

2052
02:15:22,426 --> 02:15:23,994
He loves me.

2053
02:15:24,094 --> 02:15:27,181
You haven't spent six days
with him in all his life.

2054
02:15:28,348 --> 02:15:31,585
Let's ask him
which of us he prefers.

2055
02:15:31,685 --> 02:15:34,521
Nan, send Bruce here.

2056
02:15:39,067 --> 02:15:41,553
You'll see whose son he is.

2057
02:15:41,653 --> 02:15:44,223
Amber, you're not going
to let a six-year-old child

2058
02:15:44,323 --> 02:15:47,201
decide something that
he can't even understand.

2059
02:15:49,161 --> 02:15:50,854
Do you want me, Mother?

2060
02:15:50,954 --> 02:15:52,064
Yes, darling.

2061
02:15:52,164 --> 02:15:55,234
Listen, Bruce, your father's here

2062
02:15:55,334 --> 02:15:58,487
because he wants to take you
to Virginia with him.

2063
02:15:58,587 --> 02:16:01,298
Virginia?
Oh, could I, Mother?

2064
02:16:06,929 --> 02:16:09,806
Would you really
take me, sir?

2065
02:16:11,141 --> 02:16:15,087
If your mother says you can
and if you'd like to come.

2066
02:16:15,187 --> 02:16:19,466
And I can see the red Indians
and all the wild animals,

2067
02:16:19,566 --> 02:16:21,718
and I can have a pony
to ride?

2068
02:16:21,818 --> 02:16:23,362
When will we go?

2069
02:16:24,655 --> 02:16:25,973
Tomorrow.

2070
02:16:26,073 --> 02:16:28,809
Tomorrow?
On your ship?

2071
02:16:28,909 --> 02:16:30,853
Yes, on my ship.

2072
02:16:30,953 --> 02:16:34,189
Then I won't have to grow up
before I'm happy.

2073
02:16:34,289 --> 02:16:37,359
And you'll come, too,
Mother?

2074
02:16:37,459 --> 02:16:38,861
Yes, Bruce.

2075
02:16:38,961 --> 02:16:40,654
Later perhaps.

2076
02:16:40,754 --> 02:16:41,947
Amber—

2077
02:16:42,047 --> 02:16:43,824
You can take him
with you now.

2078
02:16:43,924 --> 02:16:47,327
I'll tell Nan to pack his things
and send them over.

2079
02:16:47,427 --> 02:16:49,746
There's no need to hurry.
I can delay my sailing—

2080
02:16:49,846 --> 02:16:52,416
No. It's better this way.

2081
02:16:52,516 --> 02:16:54,835
You should understand
that, Bruce.

2082
02:16:54,935 --> 02:16:56,753
You've always hated partings,

2083
02:16:56,853 --> 02:16:59,298
and, besides, I have
a thousand things to do,

2084
02:16:59,398 --> 02:17:01,091
the hairdresser and the milliner,

2085
02:17:01,191 --> 02:17:03,969
and the arrangements for
the dance I'm giving for the king.

2086
02:17:04,069 --> 02:17:05,929
I'm inviting the whole court,

2087
02:17:06,029 --> 02:17:07,890
the foreign ambassadors as well.

2088
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:09,600
And I'm having 50 fiddlers

2089
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:13,395
and that dancer of Castlemaine's
to entertain my guests.

2090
02:17:13,495 --> 02:17:14,938
Oh, go!

2091
02:17:15,038 --> 02:17:17,624
For the love of heaven,
take him and go!

2092
02:17:54,661 --> 02:17:55,979
In heaven's name, Amber,

2093
02:17:56,079 --> 02:17:58,040
haven't we caused
enough unhappiness?

2094
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:23,649
May God have mercy
on us both for our sins.

2095
