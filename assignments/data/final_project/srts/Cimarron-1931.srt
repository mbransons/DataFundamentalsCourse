1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:14,483
- There they are. Plenty of room for them.
- C<i>u</i>t that o<i>u</i>t, Kid, and get o<i>u</i>t.

3
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,767
Hey, isn't that yo<i>u</i>ng Mr. Cravat, there?

4
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,838
By golly, it is.

5
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,942
Over here. What do yo<i>u</i> say?
I know what will fetch him.

6
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,914
Watch his ears perk <i>u</i>p
when he hears the old <i>Travelers.</i>

7
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,507
Let's give it to him.

8
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,364
High rickety! Well, yo<i>u</i> old<i>...</i>

9
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,034
Hello, b<i>u</i>ddy. Old B<i>u</i>ck.

10
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:02,665
Well, hate to be making it into a firefight.
If it ain't the old honker, himself.

11
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,042
Got yo<i>u</i>rself hitched?

12
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,978
Yeah, I've got a wife and son,
fo<i>u</i>r years old now.

13
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,643
Aye, this is like a Fo<i>u</i>rth of J<i>u</i>ly
celebration on J<i>u</i>dgment Day.

14
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,552
- Beats all Creation.
- Say, where are yo<i>u</i> heading for, Yancey?

15
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:23,061
- I'm c<i>u</i>tting dirt for the Little Bear Creek.
- That's the spot, believe me.

16
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,129
Yes, indeed.

17
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,143
Yo<i>u</i>'re Yancey Cravat, aren't yo<i>u</i>?

18
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,382
- And yo<i>u</i>?
- Lee, Dixie Lee.

19
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,983
- Indeed.
- Going for a town site?

20
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,059
No, I'm going for a q<i>u</i>arter-section ranch
o<i>u</i>t at the Little Bear Creek.

21
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,059
That's f<i>u</i>nny,
I'm heading for Little Bear, too.

22
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,997
Well, I know j<i>u</i>st the piece of land I want.

23
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,298
It's deep in the g<i>u</i>lly
and a lot of scr<i>u</i>b over.

24
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,813
Ready, aim<i>...</i>

25
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:35,840
- Yo<i>u</i> near fl<i>u</i>mmoxed. Are yo<i>u</i> h<i>u</i>rt?
- No, I'm all right.

26
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,915
B<i>u</i>t his legs are broken.
I heard them crack.

27
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,751
Please shoot him.

28
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,263
And in no time, no time, mind yo<i>u...</i>

29
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,275
they'd snapped <i>u</i>p every piece of land
that was worth having...

30
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,312
and by nightfall<i>...</i>
By nightfall there wasn't an acre.

31
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,607
Think of it, Lo<i>u</i>is, not an acre
left o<i>u</i>t of that two million.

32
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,777
The only spot I wanted
was the gro<i>u</i>nd we stood on, and<i>...</i>

33
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,252
Well, the girl got that q<i>u</i>arter section.

34
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,586
Yancey Cravat...

35
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,252
yo<i>u</i> let that h<i>u</i>ssy in black tights
have yo<i>u</i>r claim...

36
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,662
after having been gone a whole month,
away from yo<i>u</i>r wife and child.

37
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,995
- Now, Mama...
- Don't yo<i>u</i> "Mama" me.

38
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,499
Isaiah, go on with yo<i>u</i>r fanning.

39
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,204
Yes, Mrs. Venable.

40
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,933
- Well?
- The land was hers by right of claim.

41
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,536
I don't believe a word of it.
Why did yo<i>u</i> let her keep yo<i>u</i>r land?

42
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,309
Lt'd been a man, I co<i>u</i>ld have shot him.
Yo<i>u</i> can't shoot a woman.

43
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,680
- Why not?
- Oh, Felice.

44
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,187
I don't s<i>u</i>ppose yo<i>u</i>'d recognize the lady
witho<i>u</i>t her black tights.

45
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,547
"Let there be no strife
between thee and me."

46
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,517
That's from the Old Testament, Dabney.
Yo<i>u</i> may not recognize that.

47
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,029
It's all tommyrot.

48
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,463
Perhaps now, Yancey,
yo<i>u</i>'ll stop this ranting <i>u</i>p and down...

49
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,524
and be content to settle down
here in Wichita...

50
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,504
r<i>u</i>n that newspaper of yo<i>u</i>rs, and cond<i>u</i>ct
yo<i>u</i>r law practice, s<i>u</i>ch as it is...

51
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,564
with no more talk of Oklahoma.

52
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,166
Don't yo<i>u</i> realize
that this is a new empire?

53
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:49,078
Why, folks, there's never been
anything like it since Creation.

54
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,475
Creation? That took six days,
this was done in one.

55
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,913
History made in an ho<i>u</i>r. Why, it's like
a miracle o<i>u</i>t of the Old Testament.

56
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,926
- Don't be blasphemo<i>u</i>s, Yancey.
- Like a miracle o<i>u</i>t of the Old Testament.

57
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,992
Cities of ten tho<i>u</i>sands,
springing <i>u</i>p overnight.

58
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,896
Well, I'm going back.

59
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,860
I'm going back and help b<i>u</i>ild a new state
o<i>u</i>t of the last frontier of the nation...

60
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,338
and it'll be a state someday,
mark my words.

61
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,002
Yancey, yo<i>u</i>'re not leaving me again?

62
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:23,078
Leaving yo<i>u</i>, my bea<i>u</i>ty?
Not by a long shot, s<i>u</i>gar.

63
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,283
This time yo<i>u</i> and Cim
are coming with me.

64
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,423
Lo<i>u</i>is Venable, can yo<i>u</i> sit there
and see yo<i>u</i>r da<i>u</i>ghter dragged off...

65
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,518
to be scalped among savages?

66
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,928
- B<i>u</i>t I want to go, Mama.
- Yo<i>u</i> don't know what yo<i>u</i> want.

67
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,195
We start Monday week,
fresh and fair, with two freighters.

68
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,965
One with a printing o<i>u</i>tfit
and the other with the ho<i>u</i>sehold goods.

69
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,768
- Why, we can make it in nine days.
- I forbid it.

70
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,038
Yo<i>u</i>'re going to stay here with yo<i>u</i>r father
and mother in decent civilization.

71
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,213
- I've heard eno<i>u</i>gh.
- I'm going with him, Mother.

72
00:11:56,582 --> 00:12:00,780
That's it, honey.
Why, we've had eno<i>u</i>gh of this Wichita.

73
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,253
We're going o<i>u</i>t to a brand new two-fisted,
rip snorting co<i>u</i>ntry...

74
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,315
f<i>u</i>ll of Indians, rattlesnakes, g<i>u</i>n- toters,
and desperados.

75
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,926
- Isaiah, I declare.
- Miserable brat, yo<i>u</i> Boon boy.

76
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,964
Master Yancey.
Take me with yo<i>u</i> to Oklahomy.

77
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,470
Please take me, Master Yancey.

78
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,667
Yo<i>u</i> ain't going to no Oklahomy.
Yo<i>u</i>'re going to take a bath.

79
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,768
- Mammy, I want to<i>...</i>
- Get o<i>u</i>t. Get o<i>u</i>t.

80
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,480
Well, I'll go see
abo<i>u</i>t those freighters, h<i>u</i>h?

81
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,743
Come on here, Cim. Atta boy.

82
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,654
My son, yo<i>u</i>'re going to see more Indians
then yo<i>u</i> ever tho<i>u</i>ght of.

83
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,793
I never heard of s<i>u</i>ch a thing.

84
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,929
What do yo<i>u</i> mean, Sabra?
Yo<i>u</i>'re not going.

85
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:49,161
Why a Venable sho<i>u</i>ld ever
marry s<i>u</i>ch a man, a b<i>u</i>ffalo h<i>u</i>nter.

86
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,327
- Q<i>u</i>ite right.
- Annie.

87
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,668
A q<i>u</i>art of whiskey a day,
living in that dreadf<i>u</i>l Cimarron co<i>u</i>ntry.

88
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,936
- What is Cimarron?
- Savage, Co<i>u</i>sin Hewitt.

89
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:03,505
It means wild, <i>u</i>nr<i>u</i>ly.
Yancey's idea of a name for the boy, Cim.

90
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,449
Yo<i>u</i> don't like anything Yancey does.
Yo<i>u</i> never have.

91
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,215
And that newspaper of his,
<i>Wichita Wigwam.</i>

92
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,687
Editorials abo<i>u</i>t Indian's rights.

93
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,691
Yo<i>u</i> might think Yancey
was an Indian himself.

94
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,024
Who knows?
Some half-breeds are no darker.

95
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,429
- Don't yo<i>u</i> dare say that.
- I heard he killed a man.

96
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,366
I won't listen to yo<i>u</i> any longer.
I don't care abo<i>u</i>t Yancey's past.

97
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,700
I married him beca<i>u</i>se I loved him,
and I'm going with him.

98
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,041
- Sabra.
- I never heard of s<i>u</i>ch a thing.

99
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,304
Yancey, where's that iron skillet?
I can't find it anywhere.

100
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,899
- Right here, s<i>u</i>gar, with the stove.
- Why didn't yo<i>u</i> tell me?

101
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,443
Cim, honey, get <i>u</i>p off the gro<i>u</i>nd.
It's too damp.

102
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,406
Yo<i>u</i> know, I think we o<i>u</i>ght to
get o<i>u</i>t that old rag r<i>u</i>g...

103
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,452
and p<i>u</i>t it down here for s<i>u</i>pper.

104
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,077
Right yo<i>u</i> are, honey.

105
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,072
I think A<i>u</i>nt Cassandra m<i>u</i>st have p<i>u</i>t
the andirons in here, s<i>u</i>gar.

106
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,286
- High rickety!
- Isaiah!

107
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,919
Please let me stay,
Master Yancey, Miss Sabra.

108
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,324
I'll help, I'll work, I'll do everything.

109
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,124
I'll help yo<i>u</i> in Oklahomy.
Please let me stay.

110
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,965
Well, yo<i>u</i>'re here,
I reckon yo<i>u</i> can stay, Isaiah.

111
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,663
I hope yo<i>u</i> go to heaven when yo<i>u</i> die.

112
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,803
Let me do that cooking, Miss Sabra.
I'll fix them.

113
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,808
Yeah, yo<i>u</i> start right in
by getting some wood.

114
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,935
- Now, scoot.
- I'm scooting.

115
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,981
There's loyalty, Sabra,
that money can't b<i>u</i>y.

116
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,428
We're going into new things, pet.

117
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,424
A new empire...

118
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,693
and I want to help b<i>u</i>ild it for yo<i>u.</i>

119
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,436
And we'll have j<i>u</i>st
the prettiest little ho<i>u</i>se we can find, too.

120
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:22,371
- With flowers and things.
- With flowers and trees...

121
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,676
and morning glories growing all over.

122
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,588
It'll be o<i>u</i>r first real home, alone...

123
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,894
and I want yo<i>u</i> to be happy
all the way, s<i>u</i>gar.

124
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,398
O<i>u</i>r first real home...

125
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,065
alone.

126
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,915
Hold that iron. Don't move.

127
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,414
I ain't aiming to check yo<i>u</i> thro<i>u</i>gh.
All I want is yo<i>u</i>r ready money. Come on.

128
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,724
This is the first time I ever fronted
yo<i>u</i>r iron, Kid.

129
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,263
- Well, if it ain't Yancey. Howdy.
- Howdy.

130
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,438
- I'm sorry I dist<i>u</i>rbed yo<i>u</i> folks.
- This is my wife.

131
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:25,570
- Howdy, ma'am.
- My son's inside, asleep.

132
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,742
I'm heading for Osage,
aiming to make it my home.

133
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,304
Osage, h<i>u</i>h?

134
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,283
- Gonna start yo<i>u</i>r newspaper there?
- Yeah.

135
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,478
Good.

136
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,117
- Got to be loping.
- Need yo<i>u</i> h<i>u</i>rry away like this, Kid?

137
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,957
I got overdrawn at the bank at Red Fork
and they're looking for me.

138
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,001
L<i>u</i>ck to yo<i>u.</i>

139
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,632
- Stay away from Osage, will yo<i>u</i>, Kid?
- S<i>u</i>re thing.

140
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,044
Unless yo<i>u</i> send me an invite. C<i>u</i>t dirt!

141
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:15,553
It's a poser, honey. All this in six weeks
right <i>u</i>p from the raw prairie.

142
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,501
Next time yo<i>u</i> come here, Chief,
yo<i>u</i> go thro<i>u</i>gh the roof.

143
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,967
He shot him.

144
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,665
Esteban Miro, a half-breed and a bad one.

145
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,568
I didn't think he had the brash.

146
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,910
M<i>u</i>st have some friends aro<i>u</i>nd town.
Don't yo<i>u</i> worry, honey.

147
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,577
Look, s<i>u</i>gar,
they've named the streets already.

148
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,752
Pawh<i>u</i>ska Aven<i>u</i>e,
that's an Indian name, son.

149
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,528
<i>Paw-hu</i> means hair and <i>ska</i> means white.
White hair.

150
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,090
<i>Pawhuska</i> was an old Osage chief.

151
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,828
- I'm an Indian, old White Hair.
- Cim.

152
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,802
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

153
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,634
Lots of watermelons there, Isaiah.

154
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,279
- Yes, sir. I s<i>u</i>re glad I came to Oklahomy.
- J<i>u</i>st a min<i>u</i>te.

155
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,477
- I'll appeal to the highest co<i>u</i>rt.
- Yo<i>u</i>'re a sooner.

156
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,213
- Don't yo<i>u</i> call me...
- Gentlemen.

157
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,653
Step right inside.
We'll determine the stat<i>u</i>s of this case.

158
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,987
I don't let anybody call me a sooner.

159
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,620
- By the way, have yo<i>u</i> each $10 with yo<i>u</i>?
- Yes, we have.

160
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,062
Step right inside, men,
and tell <i>u</i>s all abo<i>u</i>t it.

161
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,723
All right. I want to know who<i>...</i>

162
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,528
Plenty of law practice.

163
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,864
Three or fo<i>u</i>r claimers
for some of these lots.

164
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,067
Look, honey. Look, folks working late.

165
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,381
Plenty of good water<i>...</i>

166
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,316
Here yo<i>u</i> are. That's right.

167
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,155
Now, lady, what can I do for yo<i>u</i>?

168
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,495
There's Lo<i>u</i>is Hefner's empori<i>u</i>m.

169
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,598
I saw old Lo<i>u</i>is stake that claim.

170
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,545
F<i>u</i>rnit<i>u</i>re in an <i>u</i>ndertaking parlor?

171
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,540
They have plenty of combination stores
o<i>u</i>t here <i>u</i>ntil the town gets larger.

172
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,386
If yo<i>u</i>'ve a mind,
yo<i>u</i> can fly o<i>u</i>t of there, Elmer.

173
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:47,393
Hold it there, partner.
Hold her, don't let her b<i>u</i>ck yo<i>u</i> down.

174
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,432
Get away from that weeping thing.

175
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:55,070
- Why don't yo<i>u</i> do something?
- I'm doing all I can, honey.

176
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,812
Old Elmer's been <i>u</i>ncorking
the red eye, I see.

177
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,986
Yancey, do get o<i>u</i>t of here
so we can find a place to sleep.

178
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,284
I'm nearly dead and so is Cim.

179
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,823
I'm sorry, honey. I<i>...</i>
Say, where's the Bixby Hotel?

180
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,591
Left t<i>u</i>rn.
Yo<i>u</i> j<i>u</i>st passed it on the other corner.

181
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,562
Honey, we passed right by it. Get along.

182
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,936
See yo<i>u</i> later, folks.
Giddy<i>u</i>p. Come on here, boy.

183
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:47,090
I won't bring <i>u</i>p my boy in a town like this.
I'm going back home.

184
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,492
Well, don't yo<i>u</i> think yo<i>u</i> better wait
<i>u</i>ntil morning, honey?

185
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,004
Yo<i>u</i> know, a good night's sleep...

186
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,631
and things are gonna look
entirely different.

187
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,140
I'll be back soon.

188
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:56,527
Lo<i>u</i>is Hefner, one of the town's
leading merchants now, I gather.

189
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,662
- Hello, Yance. I'm glad to see yo<i>u</i> here.
- I'm glad to be here.

190
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,898
I tr<i>u</i>st the f<i>u</i>rnit<i>u</i>re end of the b<i>u</i>siness
is doing better than the other.

191
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,070
Yeah. Only been three killings so far...

192
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,910
b<i>u</i>t we'll have to start a f<i>u</i>ll jail
pretty soon, I g<i>u</i>ess.

193
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,087
- Yo<i>u</i>'re gambling?
- No.

194
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,756
J<i>u</i>st watching where the money goes.

195
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,597
Yancey! Yancey Cravat!

196
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,266
- Old Grat!
- Yes. Come this way.

197
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:47,650
Yancey Cravat.
Why, yo<i>u</i> old letch monger.

198
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,646
Yo<i>u</i> are still wearing that white hat.

199
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,656
And yo<i>u</i>'re still making
lightning calc<i>u</i>lations.

200
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,959
- Yo<i>u</i> know the boys.
- Most of them.

201
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,759
Esteban Miro.

202
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,435
So, yo<i>u</i>'re Cravat, h<i>u</i>h?

203
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,638
Yeah, and yo<i>u</i>?

204
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,140
Yo<i>u</i>ntis, Lon Yo<i>u</i>ntis.

205
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,639
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

206
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,477
Gents, what are yo<i>u</i> going to have?
This is on the ho<i>u</i>se.

207
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:21,846
Brandy.

208
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,145
I'll have brandy.

209
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:30,856
- Are yo<i>u</i> going to start the newspaper?
- Yeah, Grat.

210
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,020
Yeah.

211
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,301
I <i>u</i>nderstand the former editor here,
a man named Paigler, died.

212
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,838
Was shot in the back, h<i>u</i>h?

213
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,123
What are yo<i>u</i> aiming at?

214
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,120
Here yo<i>u</i> are, gents.

215
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,341
Have another one.

216
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,315
All right.

217
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:37,219
Mr. Cravat, I'd like to talk to yo<i>u</i> a min<i>u</i>te,
if yo<i>u</i> have time.

218
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,766
Yo<i>u</i> see, I'm a printer and a darn good one.

219
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,892
And yo<i>u</i> see, I heard yo<i>u</i> were gonna
open <i>u</i>p a newspaper office called...

220
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,963
<i>The Oklahoma Wigwam,</i> see.
And I'd like to have<i>...</i>

221
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,043
Well, I'd like to go to work.

222
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,119
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

223
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,628
- Howdy, Yance.
- Howdy, B<i>u</i>ll.

224
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,563
- Morning.
- Morning.

225
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,598
Morning.

226
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,468
"...saffron-robed, arose from the ocean...

227
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:59,407
- "to bring light to gods and men."
- Ocean?

228
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,909
Yarns and laces, cell<i>u</i>loid collars...

229
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,819
knotting yarn, drawstrings,
shoestrings, s<i>u</i>spenders.

230
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,484
- Have yo<i>u</i> any fancy braids?
- Yes, ma'am, I have some fancy braids.

231
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,827
That's Sol Levy, a walking notion co<i>u</i>nter.

232
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,633
...s<i>u</i>spenders, darning yarn,
cell<i>u</i>loid collars...

233
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,099
Howdy, Sol.

234
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,564
Howdy, Mr. Cravat. Howdy, ma'am.

235
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,603
Yes, ma'am, here's some drawstrings<i>...</i>

236
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,673
...fancy braid and I'll give yo<i>u</i>
a real good bargain.

237
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,247
I never saw anything like it in my life.

238
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,947
I'm afraid they think my dress
is a little too elaborate.

239
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,754
Why, Milton wo<i>u</i>ld have no words
for s<i>u</i>ch bea<i>u</i>ty.

240
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,199
Howdy, Cim.

241
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,310
He called yo<i>u</i> Cim.

242
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,147
- The boys are <i>u</i>p to something.
- Who are they?

243
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,656
I can't say for s<i>u</i>re, b<i>u</i>t I think
they're the ones that did Paigler dirt.

244
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,850
Paigler? Who's that?

245
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,320
Isn't that the editor?
The one who was fo<i>u</i>nd shot dead?

246
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:29,399
- Yo<i>u</i> mean they did it?
- I don't say they did it, exactly.

247
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,596
They know more than is comfortable.

248
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,335
Still wearing that white hat, h<i>u</i>h?

249
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,834
Who's that?

250
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,108
That's Lon Yo<i>u</i>ntis.
Nothing to be alarmed abo<i>u</i>t.

251
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,447
Don't be frightened, honey.
Stand right where yo<i>u</i> are.

252
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,198
The dirty sc<i>u</i>m.

253
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,889
Inside. Get o<i>u</i>t of here.

254
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,301
Half-circle c<i>u</i>t.
Yo<i>u</i>'ll find that's the Cravat brand.

255
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,074
- Can't yo<i>u</i> take a joke, Yancey?
- Joke, nothing.

256
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,840
- Lf yo<i>u</i>r miss<i>u</i>s wasn't with yo<i>u.</i>
- Don't yo<i>u</i> "miss<i>u</i>s" me...

257
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,484
yo<i>u</i> dirty sc<i>u</i>m.

258
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,078
Yo<i>u</i>'re a lot of good for nothing lo<i>u</i>ses,
that's what yo<i>u</i> are.

259
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,182
Shooting at people in the street.
Yo<i>u</i> leave my h<i>u</i>sband alone.

260
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,988
- I declare, I've a notion to...
- Honey. Sabra.

261
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,823
Why, it'll be all over the So<i>u</i>thwest...

262
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,125
that Yancey Cravat was hiding
behind a woman's petticoat.

263
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,292
B<i>u</i>t yo<i>u</i> didn't. They can't say so.

264
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,932
Yo<i>u</i> shot him very nicely
in the ear, darling.

265
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,531
Well, yo<i>u</i> sho<i>u</i>ldn't interfere when men
are having a little friendly shooting.

266
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,838
Friendly?
A b<i>u</i>llet within an inch of yo<i>u</i>r head?

267
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,941
He knew where it was going.

268
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,610
Well, come on, s<i>u</i>gar.

269
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,377
I think we better find that ho<i>u</i>se
we're gonna live in, don't yo<i>u</i>?

270
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:27,712
Come on.

271
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,159
Down a little. A little more.

272
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,887
Now a little more. Hold!

273
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,321
J<i>u</i>st nail it.

274
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,403
I'll b<i>u</i>shwhack her.

275
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,836
- Well, honey, we're here.
- Yes, we're here.

276
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,972
We're getting started, too.

277
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,919
Yo<i>u</i> know, when I think of those five years
in Wichita<i>...</i>

278
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:06,548
- I tho<i>u</i>ght yo<i>u</i> liked it in Wichita.
- A prison cell, my pet.

279
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:11,318
Five years in one place,
that's the longest stretch I've ever done.

280
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,760
Five years.
Back and forth like a trail horse.

281
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,660
Ho<i>u</i>se, office, Venables, vegetables.

282
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,766
A little while, I'd have t<i>u</i>rned into either
a Venable or a vegetable, one or the other.

283
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,003
Well.

284
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,437
We better get this office
and print shop settled...

285
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,572
if yo<i>u</i>'re ever gonna get o<i>u</i>t an iss<i>u</i>e
of that newspaper.

286
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:36,347
I g<i>u</i>ess Rickey can attend to it.
He's a printer and a darn good one.

287
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,251
I gotta see
abo<i>u</i>t these real-estate transfers...

288
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,018
and write <i>u</i>p some editorials and news...

289
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,617
and we got a cl<i>u</i>e
to the Paigler killer last night.

290
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,094
- I wanna follow it <i>u</i>p.
- I wish yo<i>u</i> wo<i>u</i>ldn't.

291
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,721
If I can find o<i>u</i>t who killed Paigler...

292
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,200
I'm gonna print it in the first edition
of the <i>Oklahoma Wigwam.</i>

293
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,134
Well, did yo<i>u</i> see the<i>...</i>

294
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,943
Well, we got the shingle h<i>u</i>ng o<i>u</i>t all right,
Mrs. Cravat.

295
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:05,243
- Look fine, Miss Sabra.
- Come on, now, colored boy.

296
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,807
We'd better pitch in and <i>u</i>nsnarl things.

297
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,281
Never mind, Rickey.
I'll straighten this room.

298
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,584
- Yo<i>u</i> go on into the print shop with Isaiah.
- Yes, ma'am.

299
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,388
Well, we'll <i>u</i>nmantle the printing press...

300
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,658
and d<i>u</i>st off the adjectives.

301
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,481
Thank yo<i>u.</i>

302
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,452
Look, Mama,
see what an Indian j<i>u</i>st gave me.

303
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:48,915
Cim, how many times have I told yo<i>u</i>
not to talk to those dirty, filthy Indians?

304
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:53,530
Here, take this into the kitchen.
Be caref<i>u</i>l, now.

305
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,426
Don't drop it, and come back
and help Mother.

306
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,991
All right, Mama.

307
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,263
Safety pins, collar b<i>u</i>ttons...

308
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,364
needles, thread, thimbles,
crochet cotton...

309
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:07,934
cell<i>u</i>loid collars, safety pins,
crochet cotton, needles.

310
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:12,676
Here comes that little shrimp again.
Let's see how he feels today.

311
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:17,454
Hey, Sol! Come here!
I wanna b<i>u</i>y a little fancy lace!

312
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,353
Come on over here. Come on.

313
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,360
...cotton, needles, thread<i>...</i>

314
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:30,165
Come on, Sol,
I wanna b<i>u</i>y my gal a b<i>u</i>stle.

315
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,669
- How m<i>u</i>ch for a b<i>u</i>stle cover?
- Bring me a pair of tights.

316
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,301
Safety pins, cotton gloves, needles.

317
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,048
Please, don't start, please.

318
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,313
Please don't, mister. Please don't.

319
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,379
Please, mister. Please, don't.

320
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,885
- Bring him here.
- Please. Please. Please don't.

321
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,095
- Well, howdy, Mr. Levy.
- Please don't do it, mister.

322
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,867
- Please, mister, don't...
- That's all right. That's all right.

323
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,204
- Let's yo<i>u</i> and me have a drink.
- No, thank yo<i>u.</i> No.

324
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,207
Please don't do it, mister.
I don't want any. Thanks.

325
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,713
- What? Yo<i>u</i> don't want it?
- No.

326
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,943
Be a real pal and have a drink. Come on.

327
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,109
No.

328
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:25,121
- What do yo<i>u</i> think abo<i>u</i>t<i>...</i>
- Where yo<i>u</i> going, there?

329
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,614
Where yo<i>u</i> going, there?

330
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,741
Come here, yo<i>u</i> little r<i>u</i>nt, and have a<i>...</i>
Come <i>u</i>p here.

331
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,642
Please, mister.

332
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,111
Take a drink.

333
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,076
Please don't, mister. Please.

334
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,784
When I tell them to take a drink,
they drink, don't they?

335
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,560
Well, they better.

336
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,836
Yo<i>u</i>'re a ro<i>u</i>gh, eh, Yo<i>u</i>ntis?
J<i>u</i>st whip yo<i>u</i>r weight on wildcats, h<i>u</i>h?

337
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,443
Who asked yo<i>u</i>?

338
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:25,275
Come on, Sol. Yo<i>u</i>'re all right, h<i>u</i>h? S<i>u</i>re.

339
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,175
That's their idea of a joke.
Yo<i>u</i> go ahead abo<i>u</i>t yo<i>u</i>r b<i>u</i>siness.

340
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,620
- They won't be bothering yo<i>u</i> none, now.
- Thanks, Mr. Cravat.

341
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,188
Thank yo<i>u.</i>

342
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,260
Threatening to make Osage
the terror of the So<i>u</i>thwest...

343
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,129
as in the old days of the Cimarron, h<i>u</i>h?

344
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,863
- Now, yo<i>u</i> as the editor...
- Yeah, me as editor...

345
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,370
I'm interviewing citizens of note
regarding their sentiments.

346
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,866
- What's yo<i>u</i>rs?
- Stick to yo<i>u</i>r lawn.

347
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,309
Come on, Yo<i>u</i>ntis. Yo<i>u</i> know
what I'm aiming at. Who killed Paigler?

348
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,341
I'm advising yo<i>u</i> to keep yo<i>u</i>r mo<i>u</i>th sh<i>u</i>t.

349
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,616
Or the next time,
it won't be yo<i>u</i>r sombrero.

350
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,855
Thanks for the sentiment. Mine is<i>...</i>

351
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,889
Cherokee death cry. Means, yo<i>u</i> or him.

352
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:19,960
The second b<i>u</i>tton on his coat
is abo<i>u</i>t the spot for his wishbone...

353
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,071
maybe a co<i>u</i>ple of inches higher.

354
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,077
Get yo<i>u</i>r real-estate papers filed all right?

355
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,095
Yancey, dear.

356
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,163
Yo<i>u</i>'re not going to bother anymore
abo<i>u</i>t that Paigler man, are yo<i>u</i>?

357
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,927
Don't yo<i>u</i> be worrying yo<i>u</i>r pretty head
abo<i>u</i>t that.

358
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,531
Oh, please. What does it matter?
He's dead.

359
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,506
Maybe he did shoot himself.

360
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,507
Besides, yo<i>u</i>'ve got Cim and me
to think of.

361
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:09,350
Paigler was shot in the back
trying to do what I want to do:

362
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,357
Make a model empire
o<i>u</i>t of this new Oklahoma co<i>u</i>ntry.

363
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,295
No, sir, I'll show them first crack.

364
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,032
The <i>Oklahoma Wigwam</i>
prints all the news, all the time...

365
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,292
knowing no law except the law of God...

366
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,870
and the government
of these United States.

367
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,239
Say, that's a pretty good slogan.

368
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,469
Top of the page,
j<i>u</i>st ahead of the editorial col<i>u</i>mn.

369
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:36,376
Yancey, let them alone.
I don't want yo<i>u</i> to be killed.

370
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,979
- I don't.
- Honey...

371
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:42,113
I'm gonna clean <i>u</i>p the Paigler killing,
or I won't be alive myself.

372
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,922
Yo<i>u</i> don't wanna lose me j<i>u</i>st yet, do yo<i>u</i>?

373
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,724
No, dearest.

374
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:51,922
There he is.

375
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,493
- Howdy.
- Howdy, ma'am.

376
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,459
Yancey, o<i>u</i>r womenfolk
think it's abo<i>u</i>t time...

377
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:05,233
that some contact be established
between the town and Providence.

378
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,468
There ain't a minister here,
and we've come to ask yo<i>u...</i>

379
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,911
to cond<i>u</i>ct divine service next S<i>u</i>nday.

380
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,282
Divine service?

381
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,018
- Why, s<i>u</i>re. I'll be pleased to.
- Then that's settled.

382
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,354
- Fine.
- We'll have to arrange a place.

383
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,462
Well, let's see, there's Grat Gotch's.

384
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,526
- The gambling tent?
- It's the only place in town big eno<i>u</i>gh.

385
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,293
That's right.

386
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,963
Yeah, I know Grat well. I'll speak to him.
Come along.

387
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,263
Back soon, honey.

388
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,059
Good morning, Mr. Cravat.

389
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,540
Do yo<i>u</i> feel nervo<i>u</i>s
abo<i>u</i>t yo<i>u</i>r sermon, dear?

390
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,844
I'd rather plead to a Texas j<i>u</i>ry
than preach to this gang of<i>...</i>

391
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,319
What's everybody la<i>u</i>ghing at?

392
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,367
How can yo<i>u</i> la<i>u</i>gh?

393
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,371
- Isaiah.
- Can't yo<i>u u</i>nderstand?

394
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,716
I didn't go to fret nobody.

395
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,413
Yo<i>u</i> all dress <i>u</i>p fine
for a ch<i>u</i>rch's meeting...

396
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,613
so I pleased to dress myself <i>u</i>p
S<i>u</i>nday style.

397
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:04,125
That's right, Isaiah.
We take it as a personal compliment.

398
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:09,024
- Why, yo<i>u</i> look finer than any of <i>u</i>s.
- I j<i>u</i>st fixed my twily like yo<i>u</i> all.

399
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,234
Say, Isaiah, wo<i>u</i>ld yo<i>u</i> like to have
a real s<i>u</i>it of S<i>u</i>nday clothes?

400
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,296
A S<i>u</i>nday s<i>u</i>it for me to wear? For tr<i>u</i>e?

401
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,905
I don't want yo<i>u</i> to go
to that ch<i>u</i>rch meeting.

402
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,942
Oh, now, now. Yo<i>u</i> don't <i>u</i>nderstand.
Now, listen close.

403
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,910
I want yo<i>u</i> to do
something important for me.

404
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,451
Now, the ho<i>u</i>se is all alone, see.

405
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,085
I want yo<i>u</i> to go down there
and keep watch...

406
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,218
till we come home
from that ch<i>u</i>rch meeting.

407
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,262
Patrol d<i>u</i>ty. That's what.

408
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,322
Patrol d<i>u</i>ty? Yes, sir, Master Yancey.

409
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:46,164
Now yo<i>u</i> take this and if anyone tries
to break in, shoot.

410
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,897
- I'll kill them dead.
- Fine.

411
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,600
And then yo<i>u</i> get a new s<i>u</i>it and boots,
besides. Now, scoot.

412
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,471
Yes, sir. I'm scooting.

413
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,183
Do yo<i>u</i> think<i>...</i> Yancey, let's not go.

414
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,918
Tell them yo<i>u</i>'re sick or I'm sick.
Tell them anything...

415
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,585
We're late, honey.

416
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,264
Hi, Yance. Hiya, preacher man.

417
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,200
Now, Preacher, where's yo<i>u</i>r Bible?

418
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,270
Right here, boys.

419
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,503
Now no loafing in the entrance.
Either come in or stay o<i>u</i>t.

420
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,385
Did yo<i>u</i> see that man, Yo<i>u</i>ntis?
He looked at yo<i>u</i> so<i>...</i>

421
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,513
That's fine, honey.

422
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:42,717
I always like to have the members
of my flock right <i>u</i>nder my eye.

423
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,528
Q<i>u</i>ite a shindig, ain't it?

424
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:56,733
Some of these folks look as q<i>u</i>eer
in ch<i>u</i>rch as a m<i>u</i>le does in the front...

425
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,200
parlor.

426
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:08,115
How do, Mrs. Cravat?
I'm Mrs. Tracy Wyatt.

427
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,742
How do yo<i>u</i> do?

428
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,788
It was so nice of yo<i>u</i>r h<i>u</i>sband
to cond<i>u</i>ct this service this morning.

429
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:19,218
Abo<i>u</i>t time the intellect<i>u</i>al life
of this comm<i>u</i>nity was stirred <i>u</i>p a bit.

430
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,627
Yes.

431
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:26,361
I was a schoolteacher back East,
that is in Cairo, Illinois.

432
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,928
- Indeed?
- Yes, indeed.

433
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,099
I can trace my ancestry right back
to William Whipple...

434
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,934
one of the signers
of the Declaration of Independence.

435
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,105
Lands, yes.

436
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,747
Some p<i>u</i>mpkins.

437
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,245
I'll say. Hey, Annie.

438
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,792
Come along, girls.

439
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:06,640
- Dixie Lee, j<i>u</i>st arrived in town.
- Dixie Lee?

440
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:10,471
Why, I tho<i>u</i>ght yo<i>u</i>'d heard of her.

441
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,848
Why, she's a<i>...</i>

442
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,827
Right here, sister. Take my pew.

443
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,295
Get <i>u</i>p, webfoot, and give the gals a seat.

444
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:31,334
Rest the velvet, lady.
Look o<i>u</i>t for them splinters.

445
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,198
Sit down. Take off yo<i>u</i>r hat.

446
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,871
- Ain't she a h<i>u</i>ckleberry?
- Lollapalooza, field <i>u</i>p, pert and chipper.

447
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,875
Those girls. Red Fork.

448
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:08,235
Exc<i>u</i>se me, please.
Is it all right if I'm here?

449
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,538
Yo<i>u</i> can stay here j<i>u</i>st as long as I do.

450
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,337
Thanks.

451
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,250
Fellow citizens...

452
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,882
I have been called <i>u</i>pon
to cond<i>u</i>ct this opening meeting...

453
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,984
of the Osage first Methodist...

454
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:36,529
Episcopalian, L<i>u</i>theran, Presbyterian,
Congregational, Baptist, Catholic...

455
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,865
Unitarian, Hebrew ch<i>u</i>rch.

456
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,868
D<i>u</i>ring the co<i>u</i>rse of my career
as lawyer and editor...

457
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,606
I've been req<i>u</i>ired to speak
on vario<i>u</i>s occasions on many s<i>u</i>bjects.

458
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:53,046
I've spoken in defense of my co<i>u</i>ntry
and in criticism of it.

459
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,551
I've been called <i>u</i>pon
to defend and convict...

460
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,883
horse thieves, harlots, and m<i>u</i>rderers.

461
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:02,287
And while I know my bible
from cover to cover...

462
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:05,422
and many of its passages
are graven on my heart...

463
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:08,594
this, fellow citizens, is the very first time...

464
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:14,433
that I have ever been req<i>u</i>ired to speak
the word of God in His temple.

465
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:20,100
For any shelter,
however h<i>u</i>mble or however sordid...

466
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,772
no offense, Grat...

467
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,877
becomes, when His word is spoken in it...

468
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,881
His temple.

469
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:36,051
Therefore, let <i>u</i>s open
this a<i>u</i>spicio<i>u</i>s occasion by singing<i>...</i>

470
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,622
What do yo<i>u</i> know, boys, anyway, h<i>u</i>h?

471
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,760
How abo<i>u</i>t...

472
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:45,495
<i>Who Are You At Home,</i> for a starter?

473
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,902
Thanks, Rickey.
It's a good song, tho<i>u</i>gh a bit sec<i>u</i>lar.

474
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,465
B<i>u</i>t yo<i>u</i> all know it. That's the main thing.

475
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,309
Here, wait a min<i>u</i>te. Wait a min<i>u</i>te.

476
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,446
While we are singing,
we'll take <i>u</i>p a collection.

477
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,779
What for?

478
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,250
Beca<i>u</i>se, Pete, yo<i>u</i> infidel...

479
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,189
part of a ch<i>u</i>rch service
is in taking <i>u</i>p a collection...

480
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,520
and yo<i>u</i>r donations, fellow citizens,
ladies and gentlemen...

481
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,359
and yo<i>u</i>, too, Pete...

482
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,657
will be for the new ch<i>u</i>rch organ.

483
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,438
Great g<i>u</i>ns, Yancey.
We ain't even got a ch<i>u</i>rch.

484
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,447
Now, that's all right, Pete.

485
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,849
Once we b<i>u</i>y an organ, it stands to reason
we'd have to b<i>u</i>ild a ch<i>u</i>rch to p<i>u</i>t it in...

486
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,315
and, members of the congregation...

487
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,591
anybody contrib<i>u</i>ting less than two bits...

488
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,956
will be thrown o<i>u</i>t of this tent by me.

489
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,625
Indians not incl<i>u</i>ded.

490
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,931
All right, Jesse,
will yo<i>u</i> please favor <i>u</i>s with a pitch?

491
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,351
Will the ladies please join in
with their sweet soprano voices?

492
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,026
Now, once again, please.

493
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,836
Fellow citizens...

494
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,232
the s<i>u</i>m of the collection for the organ
for the first Osage ch<i>u</i>rch...

495
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:44,076
whose denomination shall be nameless,
is a gratifying total...

496
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,742
of $133 and 55 cents.

497
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:58,124
Wait a min<i>u</i>te, Grat,
did yo<i>u</i> say 55 cents? 55?

498
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,628
That's right, Yancey.

499
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:03,462
Some miserable, tightfisted,
skinflint of a<i>...</i>

500
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,162
Well, maybe it is an Osage by mistake.

501
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,108
How abo<i>u</i>t a Cherokee, Yancey?

502
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:16,042
Not a Cherokee, Sid.
I recognized yo<i>u</i>r voice by the sq<i>u</i>eak.

503
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:19,638
If yo<i>u</i> knew anything at all, yo<i>u</i>
and Yo<i>u</i>ntis and the rest of yo<i>u</i>r o<i>u</i>tfit...

504
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:21,684
yo<i>u</i>'d realize that a Cherokee
is too smart...

505
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:25,745
to p<i>u</i>t anything in the contrib<i>u</i>tion box of
a race that's robbed him of his birthright.

506
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,188
Friends, we've come to the sermon.

507
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,528
Anyone wishing to leave,
kindly do so now.

508
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,995
Please make way
for all departing worshippers.

509
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,374
My text is from Proverbs.

510
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,578
"A lion is in the way.
There's a lion in the streets."

511
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,743
Friends, there's a lion
in the streets of Osage.

512
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,523
I have a confession to make.

513
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:07,830
I have gone abo<i>u</i>t seeking information
of this lion.

514
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,032
I might say this jackal or dirty sk<i>u</i>nk...

515
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,262
if it wo<i>u</i>ldn't be sacrilegio<i>u</i>s.

516
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:16,667
B<i>u</i>t this jackal in a lion's skin...

517
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,371
who by threatening s<i>u</i>dden death...

518
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,409
has held this little town
abjectly terrorized.

519
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,212
I intended to anno<i>u</i>nce from this p<i>u</i>lpit...

520
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:28,948
this platform...

521
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,046
that I wo<i>u</i>ld p<i>u</i>blish this knowledge...

522
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,090
in the first iss<i>u</i>e
of the <i>Oklahoma Wigwam...</i>

523
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:38,389
coming off the press next Th<i>u</i>rsday,
thereby starting my paper off with a bang.

524
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,226
Friends, and fellow citizens...

525
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:49,264
I repent of my greed...

526
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,370
and my desire for self-advancement
at the expense of this comm<i>u</i>nity.

527
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:58,538
I no longer intend to withhold the name
of that yellow, sk<i>u</i>nking m<i>u</i>rderer...

528
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,807
who shot down Jack Paigler
when his back was t<i>u</i>rned.

529
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,787
I will tell yo<i>u</i> all now the name of that<i>...</i>

530
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,989
Was Lon Yo<i>u</i>ntis.

531
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,488
Stay where yo<i>u</i> are.

532
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,567
Lo<i>u</i>is Hefner...

533
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,298
as coroner, do yo<i>u</i>r official d<i>u</i>ty
and remove the body.

534
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:25,670
Okay, Yance.
It's self-defense and j<i>u</i>stifiable homicide.

535
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,437
This town needs a boot hill,
and I'll start it with this b<i>u</i>rial.

536
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,774
Come on, boys.

537
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,180
Fellow citizens...

538
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,315
<i>u</i>nder the circ<i>u</i>mstances...

539
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:38,686
we will forego this sermon...

540
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,814
and concl<i>u</i>de this service
with a brief word of prayer.

541
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,200
Bless this comm<i>u</i>nity, O Lord.

542
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,402
Amen.

543
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,913
I swan...

544
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,814
that's the most s<i>u</i>rprising ch<i>u</i>rch meeting
I ever attended.

545
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,785
B<i>u</i>t I m<i>u</i>st say,
yo<i>u</i>r h<i>u</i>sband did the proper thing.

546
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,988
The cleaning o<i>u</i>t of that gang
is one of the first moves...

547
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,218
to make this town fit to live in.
Thanks to yo<i>u</i>, Yancey.

548
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,388
- Horrible, he might've...
- B<i>u</i>t he didn't, honey.

549
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,391
Everything's all right.

550
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:27,160
- Did yo<i>u</i> have to kill him like that?
- No, I co<i>u</i>ld've let him kill me.

551
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:40,139
Congrat<i>u</i>lations, Mr. Cravat.
Haven't seen yo<i>u</i> since the r<i>u</i>n.

552
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,809
Well, how do yo<i>u</i> do Miss...

553
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:45,948
Lee?

554
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,988
No wonder.

555
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,155
- I heard yo<i>u</i> were in town.
- Yo<i>u</i>'ve known.

556
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,152
Yes, I'm here.

557
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:58,100
Tho<i>u</i>ght yo<i>u</i>'d settle down
on that q<i>u</i>arter section that I didn't get.

558
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:01,160
Well, I tried to be a farmer,
b<i>u</i>t I had to give <i>u</i>p the land.

559
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:05,833
The neighbors' wives formed a vigilance
committee, and I left by req<i>u</i>est.

560
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,705
A vigilance committee wo<i>u</i>ld.

561
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:20,883
Yo<i>u</i> haven't said a word
all the way home, pet.

562
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:22,716
What's stirring yo<i>u</i>?

563
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,862
That woman, smirking and smiling.

564
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,826
And yo<i>u</i> stood there act<i>u</i>ally
talking to her, holding her hand...

565
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,893
after she'd stolen yo<i>u</i>r land in the r<i>u</i>n, too.

566
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:38,338
She wanted that land beca<i>u</i>se she was
trying to give <i>u</i>p her way of living...

567
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,672
- was desperate.
- Well, what's she doing here, then?

568
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:42,405
Driven o<i>u</i>t by the neighbors...

569
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,572
she heard the railroad was coming
thro<i>u</i>gh and came down here.

570
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,877
Yo<i>u</i> talk as tho<i>u</i>gh
yo<i>u</i> know a lot abo<i>u</i>t her.

571
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:52,250
A little. Comes from a good family,
victim of circ<i>u</i>mstances.

572
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:55,190
Well, in a way, she's a good girl.

573
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:56,653
A good girl?

574
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,554
I know a lot of people
scattered over Oklahoma...

575
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,928
that sho<i>u</i>ldn't cast a stone at her.

576
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:06,591
Don't yo<i>u</i> q<i>u</i>ote yo<i>u</i>r Bibles
and Magdalenes at me, Yancey Cravat!

577
00:55:25,903 --> 00:55:27,996
- Hello, Bill.
- Well, well, well.

578
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:02,702
First anniversary n<i>u</i>mbers.

579
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:06,435
Say, yo<i>u</i>'ve been meaning to p<i>u</i>ll some
blood for a year. Why don't yo<i>u</i> s<i>u</i>bscribe?

580
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,137
Well, it cost $1.

581
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:11,338
Cravat co<i>u</i>ld <i>u</i>se that dollar
to b<i>u</i>y the new baby a rattle.

582
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:14,110
And a pair of r<i>u</i>bber boots
till the streets get paved.

583
00:56:14,184 --> 00:56:16,482
Yo<i>u</i> s<i>u</i>re need r<i>u</i>bber boots here,
or go barefoot.

584
00:56:21,959 --> 00:56:24,450
I got to get a pair of new boots<i>...</i>

585
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,461
Darling, she's awake.

586
00:56:33,737 --> 00:56:36,968
Hello, baby Donna. Hello, sweetheart.

587
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,536
Look, this is Daddy.

588
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:45,003
This is Mama,

589
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:52,245
Yancey, darling, I'm so happy.

590
00:56:52,556 --> 00:56:56,583

Make this town better for Donna to live in.

594
00:57:07,104 --> 00:57:10,039
No saloons. No women like Dixie Lee.

595
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:13,741
And I'm gonna have a hired girl
as soon as the newspaper...

596
