1
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:10,545
- It's 2 o'clock in the morning.
- Oh, George!

2
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:11,869
Well, it is.

3
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:15,506
What a cluck you are!

4
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:18,435
It's late, you know. It's late.

5
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:40,859
What a dump!

6
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:46,369
Hey, what's that from? “What a dump! “

7
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,551
How would I know?

8
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:51,948
Oh, come on, what's it from?
You know!

9
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:57,049
What's it from, for Christ's sake?

10
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,880
What's what from?

11
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:02,719
I just told you. I just did it.

12
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:05,054
“What a dump! “

13
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,057
Huh? What's that from?

14
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:10,487
I haven't the faintest idea.

15
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,099
Dumbbell!

16
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,242
It's from some Bette Davis picture...

17
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:17,578
... some goddamn Warner Brothers epic.

18
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,915
Martha, I can't remember all the films
that came out of Warner Brothers.

19
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,253
Nobody's asking you to remember
every Warner Brothers epic.

20
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:28,194
Just one single little epic.
That's all.

21
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:30,925
Bette Davis gets peritonitis at the end.

22
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:33,928
And she wears a fright wig
throughout the picture.

23
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,432
She's married to Joseph Cotten
or something.

24
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,422
Somebody.

25
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:43,773
She wants to go to Chicago because
she loves that actor with the scar.

26
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:44,989
She gets sick...

27
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:47,610
... and sits down at her dressing table...

28
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:49,227
What actor? What scar?

29
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,616
I can't remember his name!
What's the picture?

30
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:55,517
I want to know the name of the picture.

31
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,452
She gets this peritonitis...

32
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:02,621
... and decides to go to Chicago anyway.

33
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,710
“Chicago”! It's called “Chicago. ”

34
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,124
What is?

35
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,302
I mean the picture. It's “Chicago. ”

36
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,297
Oh, good grief!

37
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,104
Don't you know anything?

38
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,474
“Chicago” was a '30s musical...

39
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:26,053
... starring little Miss Alice Faye.
Don't you know anything?

40
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:27,746
This picture...

41
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,494
... Bette Davis comes home from
a hard day at the grocery store...

42
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:34,635
She works in a grocery store?

43
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,161
She's a housewife. She buys things.

44
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:42,505
She comes with the groceries...

45
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:45,508
... and she walks into
the modest living room...

46
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,680
... of the modest cottage
modest Joseph Cotten set her up in.

47
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:50,951
Are they married?

48
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:54,788
Yes, they're married.
To each other, cluck!

49
00:06:55,353 --> 00:07:00,018
And she comes in
and she looks around this room...

50
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:04,219
... and she sets down her groceries.

51
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,690
And she says...

52
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,697
... ”What a dump! “

53
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,531
She's discontent.

54
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:22,033
What's the name of the picture?

55
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,624
I really don't know.

56
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:25,216
Well, think!

57
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:26,838
I'm tired, dear.

58
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:30,557
I don't know why you're tired.
You didn't do anything today.

59
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:32,559
- I'm tired.
- You didn't have classes.

60
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,731
If your father didn't always set up
these Saturday night orgies...

61
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:38,900
Well, it's just too bad about you.

62
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:40,902
Well, that's how it is anyway.

63
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:45,237
You didn't do anything. You never do.
You never mix!

64
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,715
You just sit around and talk.

65
00:07:48,077 --> 00:07:52,414
What do you want me to do?
Bray at everyone all night like you do?

66
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,076
I don't bray!

67
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,408
All right, you don't bray.

68
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,910
I did not bray.

69
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:01,066
I said you didn't bray!

70
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,159
Fix me a drink.

71
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:07,171
Haven't you had enough?

72
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,598
I said fix me a drink!

73
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,094
Well, I don't suppose a nightcap
would kill either of us.

74
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:18,792
A nightcap? Are you kidding?

75
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:21,787
We've got guests.

76
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:24,645
Got what?

77
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,779
Guests. Guests!

78
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:36,120
Yeah, guests. People.
We've got guests coming over.

79
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,663
When?

80
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:39,656
Now.

81
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:44,101
Good Lord, Martha,
do you know what time it is?

82
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,202
Who's coming over?

83
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,569
- What's-their-name.
- Who?

84
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,078
Who's what's-their-name?

85
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,982
I don't know their name, George.

86
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:01,324
We met tonight. They're new. He's
in the math department or something.

87
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:04,027
I don't remember
meeting anybody tonight.

88
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:05,620
Well, you did.

89
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,935
Of all the asinine...
Who are these people?

90
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,834
He's in the Math Department.

91
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:12,901
Who?

92
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:18,002
He's in the Math Department.
He's young and he's blond...

93
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:20,678
He's good-looking, well-built?

94
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,170
Yes, good-looking, well-built.

95
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:26,508
- It figures.
- What?

96
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,845
Nothing.

97
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:32,674
His wife's a mousy little type
without any hips or anything.

98
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:34,517
Remember them now?

99
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:37,864
I guess so. But why do they
have to come over now?

100
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:41,703
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them, that's why.

101
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:44,372
- Daddy said we should be nice to them.
- Why now... ?

102
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:47,376
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them!

103
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:51,213
He didn't mean we were supposed
to stay up all night with them.

104
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:53,549
We could have them over
some Sunday.

105
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,420
Well, never mind.
Besides, it is Sunday.

106
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,885
Very early Sunday.

107
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,429
- It's ridiculous!
- Well, it's done.

108
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:32,091
Where are they?
If we've got guests, where are they?

109
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,722
They'll be here soon.

110
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:37,097
What'd they do, go home
and get some sleep first?

111
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:39,089
They'll be here.

112
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,900
I wish you'd tell me...

113
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:44,437
... about things. Stop springing
things on me all the time.

114
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:47,441
I don't spring things
on you all the time.

115
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:51,182
You really do! You're always
springing things on me.

116
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:53,244
Always.

117
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:57,916
Poor Georgie Porgie put-upon-pie.

118
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:07,757
What are you doing? Are you sulking?

119
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:12,758
Let me see. Are you sulking?

120
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,437
Is that what you're doing?

121
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,439
Never mind.

122
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,239
Just don't bother yourself.

123
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,455
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf,
Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf?

124
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:46,139
What's wrong? Didn't think it's funny?
I thought it was a scream.

125
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,481
It was all right.

126
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:50,144
You laughed when you heard it
at the party.

127
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:51,979
I smiled. I didn't laugh.

128
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,395
You laughed your goddamn head off!

129
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,816
It was all right.

130
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:57,478
It was a scream.

131
00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:00,653
It was very funny, yes.

132
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,082
You make me puke.

133
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,492
You make me puke.

134
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:09,665
Wasn't a very nice thing to say.

135
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,157
That wasn't what?

136
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:13,422
A very nice thing to say.

137
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:15,356
Oh, I like your anger.

138
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,172
I think that's what I like
about you most.

139
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,841
Your anger.

140
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:26,417
You are such a simp!

141
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:28,515
You haven't got...

142
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:31,951
... the what?

143
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:34,487
Guts?

144
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,860
Phrase-maker.

145
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,124
You never put any ice in my drink.
Why is that?

146
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,895
I always put ice in your drinks.
You eat it, that's all.

147
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:12,557
It's this habit you've got of chewing
on your ice cubes like a cocker spaniel.

148
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,656
You'll crack your big teeth.

149
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,270
Well, they're my big teeth.

150
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:20,577
Yeah, some of them, some of them.

151
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:22,912
I've got more teeth than you have.

152
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,074
Two more.

153
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:28,416
And you're going bald.

154
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:30,361
So are you.

155
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:49,931
Hello, honey.

156
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:57,024
Come on and give your mommy
a big sloppy kiss.

157
00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:01,115
I want a big sloppy kiss!

158
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:04,136
I don't want to kiss you right now.

159
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,961
Where are these people you invited?

160
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:13,193
Where is this good looking, well-built
young man and his slim-hipped wife?

161
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:16,121
Talking to Daddy. They'll be here.

162
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:21,364
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

163
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:35,994
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

164
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:40,332
If I kissed you I'd get all excited.
I'd get beside myself...

165
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:44,002
... and then I'd have to take you by
force on the living room rug.

166
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:49,008
Then our guests would walk in and
what would your father say about that?

167
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:50,670
Oh, you pig!

168
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:55,345
Fix me another drink, lover.

169
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:58,518
God, you can swill it down, can't you?

170
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,010
I'm thirsty!

171
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:01,344
Oh, Jesus!

172
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,026
I can drink you under any table you
want, so don't worry about me.

173
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:10,691
You got the prize years ago.
You've won every abomination award.

174
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,536
I swear if you existed I'd divorce you.

175
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:18,206
- Stay on your feet for your guests.
- I can't even see you!

176
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:22,544
If you pass out or throw up...
And try to keep your clothes on too.

177
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:27,717
There's no more sickening sight than
you drunk and your skirt over your head.

178
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,568
Your heads, I should say.

179
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,548
Party! Party!

180
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,793
I'm really looking forward to this.

181
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:37,961
- Go answer the door.
- You answer it.

182
00:15:37,962 --> 00:15:39,647
Get to that door, you!

183
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:41,538
Come on in!

184
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,734
Get over and answer that door.

185
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:48,239
All right. Whatever love wants.
Just don't start on the bit, that's all.

186
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,798
The bit?

187
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,745
What language is that?
Imitating one of your students?

188
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:57,081
Don't start in on the bit
about the kid, that's all.

189
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,585
- What do you take me for?
- Much too much.

190
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:01,921
I'll start in on the kid if I want to.

191
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,422
I'd advise against it.

192
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:06,928
Well, good for you.
Get over there and open that door.

193
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,429
You've been advised.

194
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,764
Sure. Get over there.

195
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:11,946
Yes, love. Whatever love wants.

196
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:14,436
Some people still have manners...

197
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:17,439
... and just don't break into
people's houses.

198
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,443
Even if they hear a subhuman monster
yowling at them from inside.

199
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:22,604
Goddamn you!

200
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,784
You must be our little guests.

201
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,353
Just ignore old sourpuss here.
Come on in, kids!

202
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:41,013
Just hand your coats to old sourpuss
here.

203
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,967
Perhaps we shouldn't have come.

204
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,458
Yes, it is late!

205
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,974
Late! Are you kidding?
Just throw your stuff down any place.

206
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:52,395
Furniture, floor.
Makes no difference around here.

207
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,646
I told you we shouldn't have come.

208
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,037
I said come on in. Now come on!

209
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:02,068
Look, muckmouth, you cut that out!

210
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,906
Martha's a devil with language.

211
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,860
Kids, sit down.

212
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,828
Isn't this lovely?

213
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:19,915
- Yes, indeed. Very handsome.
- Thank you.

214
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:36,785
Who did the painting?

215
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:42,613
Some Greek with a mustache
Martha attacked one night in a...

216
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:46,863
It's got a...

217
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:49,541
- Quiet intensity?
- Well, no...

218
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:52,577
Then a certain
noisy relaxed quality maybe?

219
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:56,081
How about a quietly
noisy relaxed intensity?

220
00:17:56,082 --> 00:17:57,987
Dear, you're being joshed.

221
00:17:58,551 --> 00:18:00,017
I'm aware of that.

222
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:01,043
I am sorry.

223
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:06,383
It's actually a pictorial representation
of the order of Martha's mind.

224
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:10,798
Fix the kids a drink.

225
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,939
What would you like to drink?

226
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,641
What would you like?

227
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:20,842
A little brandy maybe.
Never mix, never worry!

228
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:23,411
Brandy? Just brandy.
Simple, simple.

229
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:24,879
What about you...

230
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,518
Bourbon, if you don't mind.

231
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,254
Mind? I don't mind.
Don't think I mind.

232
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:35,424
Martha, rubbing alcohol for you?

233
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,495
Sure. Never mix, never worry!

234
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:50,605
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

235
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,944
Wasn't that funny? That was so funny!

236
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,576
Yes, it was.

237
00:18:57,615 --> 00:18:59,777
I thought I'd bust a gut!

238
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:05,123
George didn't think it was funny.

239
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:08,960
Martha thinks that unless you
bust a gut you're not amused.

240
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,964
Unless you carry on like a hyena
you're not having fun.

241
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:15,067
I certainly had fun.
It was a wonderful party!

242
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:19,131
- It certainly was.
- Your father, he is so wonderful!

243
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:24,315
He's quite a guy, isn't he?

244
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:26,262
You better believe it.

245
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:27,945
He's a marvelous man.

246
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:30,652
I'm not tearing him down.
We know he's a god.

247
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,320
You lay off my father.

248
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:35,658
When you've had as many
faculty parties as I have...

249
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:37,384
I rather appreciated it.

250
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:42,165
I mean aside from enjoying it,
I appreciated it.

251
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:47,404
Meeting, introducing, how he had us
stay at the Inn till our place is ready.

252
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:48,906
When I taught in Kansas...

253
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:50,507
You won't believe it...

254
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:55,698
... but we had to make our way all by
ourselves. Isn't that right, dear?

255
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,881
We had to make our own way.

256
00:19:57,882 --> 00:20:02,520
I'd have to go up to the wives
in the library or the supermarket...

257
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:05,241
... and say, “Hello, I am new here. ”

258
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:09,060
“You must be Mrs. So-and-so,
Doctor So-and-so's wife. ”

259
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,617
It really wasn't very nice at all.

260
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,430
Daddy knows how to run things.

261
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:19,238
He's a remarkable man.

262
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:21,034
You bet your sweet life.

263
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:23,386
I'll tell you a secret.

264
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:28,248
There are easier things in this world,
if you teach at the university...

265
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,584
... than being married
to the daughter of...

266
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:34,589
... the president of that university.
There are easier things.

267
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,761
It's a great opportunity. For some men
it would be the chance of a lifetime.

268
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:43,377
There are, believe me,
easier things in this world.

269
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,602
Some men would give their right arm
for the chance!

270
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:51,543
In reality that sacrifice is of a more
private portion of the anatomy.

271
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:55,613
Could you show me where the...

272
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:56,781
Are you all right?

273
00:20:56,782 --> 00:21:01,118
Of course, dear. I just want to
put some powder on my nose.

274
00:21:01,454 --> 00:21:04,104
Show her where we keep the euphemism?

275
00:21:07,794 --> 00:21:11,330
I'm sorry. I want to show you
the house anyway.

276
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:12,906
We'll be back, dear.

277
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,327
Honestly, George, you burn me up!

278
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:18,009
You really do!

279
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:22,976
Don't shoot your mouth off
about you-know-what.

280
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:26,277
I'll talk about
any goddamn thing I want to!

281
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:27,474
Okay, vanish!

282
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:30,148
Any goddamn thing I want!

283
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:01,579
What'll it be?

284
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,538
I'll stick to bourbon.

285
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,058
You're in the Math Department?

286
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,096
No.

287
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,892
Martha said so.
I think that's what she said.

288
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:30,383
Why'd you decide to be a teacher?

289
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:34,221
The same things that motivated you,
I imagine.

290
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:35,673
Oh? What were they?

291
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:39,486
What were the things that motivated me?

292
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:41,263
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

293
00:22:41,264 --> 00:22:44,399
You said the things that motivated you
and me were the same.

294
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,167
I said I imagined they were.

295
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:47,329
Oh, did you?

296
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:00,123
You like it here?

297
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:03,316
Yes, it's fine.

298
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:05,258
I meant the university.

299
00:23:06,624 --> 00:23:08,888
I know. I meant the university.

300
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:11,760
Well, I like it fine.

301
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:28,991
You've been here for quite a long time,
haven't you?

302
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,952
Oh, yes. Ever since I married
what's-her-name. Martha.

303
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,617
Even before that. Forever.

304
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,419
Dashed hopes and good intentions.

305
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,959
Good, better, best, bested!

306
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,473
How do you like that for a declension?

307
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,669
You didn't answer my question.

308
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:59,305
Don't condescend. I asked you
how you liked that declension.

309
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:03,318
I don't know what to say.

310
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,253
You don't know what to say?

311
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:08,859
Shall I say it's funny,
so you can say it's sad?

312
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:14,265
Or shall I say it's sad so you can say
it's funny? You can play that game!

313
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,668
- Very good!
- I think we'll just...

314
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:19,504
Now, calm down. Just calm down.
All right?

315
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:20,940
Another drink? Here.

316
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:24,528
I still have one.
And when my wife comes down...

317
00:24:25,012 --> 00:24:30,107
What I mean is, you and your wife
seem to be having some sort of a...

318
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,354
Martha and I are having nothing.
Martha and I are merely exercising.

319
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:37,858
We're walking what's left of our wits.
Pay no attention.

320
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:40,359
Now let's sit down and talk, huh?

321
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:44,865
It's just I don't like to become
involved in other people's affairs.

322
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:48,870
You'll get over that. Small college.
Musical beds is the faculty sport.

323
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:49,701
Sir?

324
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,374
Never mind. I wish you wouldn't go
“sir. ” How old are you?

325
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,364
Twenty-eight.

326
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,081
I'm forty-something.

327
00:24:56,979 --> 00:25:00,045
Aren't you surprised?
Don't I look older?

328
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:03,552
I think you look fine.

329
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:08,053
I've always been lean. I play handball.
How much do you weigh?

330
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:11,561
155, 160, something like that?
You play handball?

331
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:13,630
- Not very well.
- We'll play sometime.

332
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:18,068
Martha is 108... years old.
She weighs somewhat more than that.

333
00:25:18,402 --> 00:25:20,032
How old is your wife?

334
00:25:20,738 --> 00:25:22,078
She's twenty-six.

335
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:26,243
Martha is a remarkable woman.
I imagine she weighs around 110.

336
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:27,578
Your wife weighs...

337
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:30,644
No, my boy, your wife.
My wife is Martha.

338
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:32,044
Yes, I know.

339
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:36,630
If you were married to Martha
you'd know what it means.

340
00:25:37,256 --> 00:25:41,481
If I were married to your wife,
I'd know what that means.

341
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:47,893
Martha says you are in
the Math Department or something.

342
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:49,669
No, I'm not.

343
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:53,514
She's seldom mistaken.
Maybe you should be in it.

344
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:57,408
I'm a biologist.
I'm in the Biology Department.

345
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:06,122
You're the one's going to make all
that trouble making everyone the same.

346
00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:09,833
Rearranging the chromozones,
or whatever it is, right?

347
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:12,292
Not exactly. Chromosomes.

348
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:14,357
I'm very mistrustful.

349
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:19,536
You think we learn nothing from history?
I'm in the History Department.

350
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:20,532
Yes, I know.

351
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:23,474
Martha tells me I'm in
the History Department...

352
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:28,312
... as opposed to being the History
Department, in the sense of running it.

353
00:26:28,313 --> 00:26:31,146
I do not run the History Department.

354
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:33,518
I don't run the Biology Department.

355
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,654
You're twenty-one. Twenty-eight.

356
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:40,492
Perhaps when you're forty-something
you'll run the History Department.

357
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:41,824
Biology Department.

358
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:44,819
I'm really very mistrustful!

359
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:50,003
I read somewhere that science fiction
is not really fiction at all.

360
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:54,507
That you rearrange my genes so that
everyone will be like everyone else.

361
00:26:54,508 --> 00:26:58,045
I suspect we shall not have
much music or painting.

362
00:26:58,046 --> 00:27:02,683
But we'll have a civilization of
sublime young men much like yourself.

363
00:27:02,684 --> 00:27:07,334
Cultures and races will vanish.
The ants will take over the world.

364
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:09,690
Don't know much about science, do you?

365
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:13,267
I know history.
I know when I'm being threatened.

366
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:17,817
Your wife doesn't have any hips,
does she?

367
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:23,551
I'm not hip-happy. I was implying
that your wife is slim-hipped.

368
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:25,771
Yes, she is.

369
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,718
You got any kids?

370
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,878
No. Not yet. You?

371
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,896
For me to know and you to find out.

372
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:36,454
No kids, huh?

373
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:38,407
What's wrong?

374
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:42,198
Nothing. We wanted to wait
till we're settled.

375
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:47,567
Think you'll be happy
here at New Carthage?

376
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:51,213
Well, we hope to stay here.
I don't mean forever.

377
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:55,340
Don't bandy that about.
The Old Man wouldn't like it.

378
00:27:56,244 --> 00:28:00,675
Martha's father expects his staff
to come here and grow old...

379
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:03,344
... and fall in the line of service.

380
00:28:03,352 --> 00:28:05,657
One man, a professor of Latin...

381
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:08,923
... actually fell in the
cafeteria line one lunch.

382
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:13,262
But the Old Man isn't falling anywhere.
He isn't going to die.

383
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:14,643
There are rumors...

384
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:19,101
... which you can't breathe to Martha
for she foams at the mouth...

385
00:28:19,102 --> 00:28:20,936
... that the Old Man, her father...

386
00:28:20,937 --> 00:28:24,101
... is over two hundred years old.

387
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:29,468
There's an irony there, but I'm not
drunk enough to figure it out.

388
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:32,437
Damnit!

389
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:37,121
I wonder what women talk about
when men talk. I must find out.

390
00:28:37,122 --> 00:28:38,783
What do you want?

391
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:43,266
Isn't that a wonderful sound?

392
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:45,645
How many kids you having?

393
00:28:46,132 --> 00:28:48,133
I don't know. My wife is...

394
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:51,303
Slim-hipped.
Well, there's one of you at least.

395
00:28:51,304 --> 00:28:56,026
You must see this house, dear.
This is such a wonderful old house.

396
00:28:57,478 --> 00:28:59,947
For Christ's sake, hang on a minute!

397
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:02,150
She'll be right down, she's changing.

398
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:04,385
She's changing? What, her clothes?

399
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:05,821
- Her dress.
- Why?

400
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:08,990
I imagine that she wants
to be comfortable.

401
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:10,732
Oh, she does, does she?

402
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:12,485
You don't know!

403
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:18,109
- You all right, dear?
- Yes, dear, perfectly fine.

404
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:20,183
She wants to be comfortable?

405
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:22,172
Well, we'll see about that!

406
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:24,743
I didn't know that you had a son.

407
00:29:27,178 --> 00:29:30,513
- A son. I hadn't known.
- You to know and me to find out, huh?

408
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:33,729
Tomorrow is his birthday.
He will be sixteen.

409
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:35,803
She told you?

410
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:39,148
- She told you about him?
- Yes.

411
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,486
You said she's changing?

412
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:45,372
- And she mentioned...
- Your son's birthday.

413
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:50,869
You look pale. Would you like...

414
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:54,500
Yes, dear a little more brandy maybe.
Just a drop.

415
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:56,367
The bar?

416
00:29:56,843 --> 00:30:01,359
Yes, by all means, drink away.
You'll need it as years go on.

417
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:04,047
Damn destructive...

418
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,070
What time is it, dear?

419
00:30:07,254 --> 00:30:09,415
- 2:30.
- So late!

420
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:11,174
We should get home.

421
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,353
Keeping the baby sitter up?

422
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,049
I said we didn't have children.

423
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,315
Sorry, I wasn't even listening.

424
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,511
Or thinking. Whichever applies.

425
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,571
We'll go in a while.

426
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,062
No, you mustn't!

427
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:30,774
Martha is changing, and not for me.
Martha hasn't changed for me in years.

428
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:35,253
It means we're going to be here days.
You're being accorded an honor.

429
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:40,091
Don't forget Martha is the daughter
of our beloved boss... his right arm.

430
00:30:40,092 --> 00:30:43,261
I'd use another word,
but leave that sort of talk to Martha.

431
00:30:43,262 --> 00:30:44,657
What sort of talk?

432
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:49,757
Well, now!

433
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:54,573
Why, Martha, your Sunday chapel dress!

434
00:30:54,574 --> 00:30:56,906
Oh, that's most attractive!

435
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:58,639
You like it? Good.

436
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,782
What do you mean screaming
up the stairs at me?

437
00:31:02,783 --> 00:31:06,586
We got lonely for the soft purr
of your little voice.

438
00:31:06,587 --> 00:31:09,757
Well, you just trot over
to the bar-ie-poo...

439
00:31:09,758 --> 00:31:13,093
... and make your little mommy
a great big drink.

440
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:14,254
That's right!

441
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:22,310
You're quite a guy, getting your masters
when you were what, 12?

442
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:26,264
- Hear that, George?
- 12 and a half, actually.

443
00:31:26,275 --> 00:31:27,242
19, really.

444
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:30,579
- You needn't have mentioned it.
- I'm proud of you!

445
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,048
- I'm very impressed.
- You're damn right!

446
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:37,675
I'm wracked with jealousy.
What do you want me to do, throw up?

447
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:41,290
That's very impressive.
You should be proud.

448
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,282
He's a pretty nice fellow.

449
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:46,330
You might take over
the History Department.

450
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,641
Biology Department.

451
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,714
Yes. I'm preoccupied with history.

452
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,420
What a remark.
“I am preoccupied with history. ”

453
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:01,764
George is not. George is preoccupied
with the History Department.

454
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:03,805
He's preoccupied with it...

455
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:08,636
... because he is not the
History Department, he is only in it.

456
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:11,492
We went through that
while you were upstairs.

457
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:13,978
That's right, baby, keep it clean.

458
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:17,542
George is bogged down
in the History Department.

459
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:21,135
He's an old bog
in the History Department.

460
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:22,905
That's what George is...

461
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:26,865
... A bog, a fen, a G. D. Swamp!

462
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:32,837
Hey, swamp! Hey, swampy!

463
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,650
Can I get you something?

464
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:42,061
Well, sure.

465
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:46,264
You can light my cigarette
if you're of a mind to.

466
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,522
No. There are limits.

467
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,201
A man puts up with only so much...

468
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:55,706
... before he descends on the
evolutionary ladder which is your line.

469
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:59,878
I'll hold your hand when it's dark
and you're afraid of the bogeyman.

470
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:03,214
And I'll tote your gin bottles
out after midnight so no one sees.

471
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:08,115
But I will not light your cigarette.
And that, as they say, is that.

472
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:15,889
Hey, you played football, huh?

473
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:18,079
Yes, I was a quarterback.

474
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:20,963
But I was much more adept at boxing.

475
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:24,231
Boxing? You hear that, George?

476
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,242
Must've been good. Doesn't look
like you got hit in the face.

477
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:32,648
He was intercollegiate state
middleweight champion.

478
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:37,285
Still looks like you have a
pretty good body, is that right?

479
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:38,651
Decency forbids...

480
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:40,082
Shut up!

481
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:43,709
Is that right?
Have you kept your body up?

482
00:33:44,093 --> 00:33:46,706
It's still pretty good. I work out.

483
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,928
Yes, he has a very firm body.

484
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:54,046
Have you? I think that's very nice.

485
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:57,274
You know, once you have it,
you never know...

486
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,416
... when it'll come in handy!

487
00:34:01,447 --> 00:34:04,472
I say, why give it up until you have to?

488
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,041
I couldn't agree with you more!

489
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,291
Your obscenity is beyond human...

490
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:15,361
George here doesn't cotton
too much to body talk.

491
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:20,427
Paunchy isn't happy when the talk
moves to muscles. How much you weigh?

492
00:34:22,203 --> 00:34:23,636
155, 150...

493
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:28,766
Still at the old middleweight limit?
That's pretty good!

494
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,566
Tell them about the boxing match we had.

495
00:34:35,818 --> 00:34:36,648
Christ!

496
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,770
Tell them about it.

497
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:42,389
You tell them, you're good at it.

498
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:45,155
- Is he all right?
- Him? Oh, sure.

499
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,123
We had this boxing match...

500
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:50,499
... a couple years after we married.

501
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,820
A boxing match? The two of you?

502
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,755
Yeah, the two of us. Really.

503
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:58,194
I can't imagine it!

504
00:34:58,509 --> 00:35:01,845
Well, it wasn't in a ring
or anything like that.

505
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:04,661
Daddy was on this physical fitness kick.

506
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,852
He had a couple of us over one Sunday
and we all went out back...

507
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:14,029
... and Daddy put the gloves on himself
and asked George to box with him.

508
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,851
And George didn't want to.

509
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:22,929
So Daddy said, “Come on, young man!
What sort of a son-in-law are you? “

510
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:28,375
And while this was going on,
I don't know why I did it...

511
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,045
... I got into a pair of gloves myself...

512
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:36,207
... and I snuck up behind George,
just kidding and yelled, “Hey, George! “

513
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:40,994
And let go with a sort of roundhouse
right. Just kidding, you know.

514
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:45,888
And George wheeled around real quick
and caught it right in the jaw!

515
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:51,291
He caught it right in the jaw!

516
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:56,771
He was off-balance. He must have been.
And then he landed...

517
00:35:57,007 --> 00:35:59,568
... flat in a huckleberry bush!

518
00:36:22,536 --> 00:36:23,876
Pow, you're dead.

519
00:36:30,277 --> 00:36:32,611
Where'd you get that, you bastard?

520
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:35,615
I've had it awhile. Liked that, did
you?

521
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:36,605
Bastard!

522
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:42,622
Oh, that was pretty good.
Hey, give me a kiss.

523
00:36:42,623 --> 00:36:45,148
- Later, sweetie.
- Give me a kiss.

524
00:36:49,898 --> 00:36:53,634
So that's what you're after?
We having blue games for the guests?

525
00:36:53,635 --> 00:36:57,777
Everything in its place.
Everything in it's own good time.

526
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,800
Drinks now. Drinks for all.

527
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:02,630
You've nibbled away at your glass.

528
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:06,650
I need something.
I was never so frightened in my life.

529
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:08,321
Weren't you frightened?

530
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:12,597
- I don't remember.
- I bet you were.

531
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:14,793
Did you think I was going to kill you?

532
00:37:14,794 --> 00:37:17,319
You? Kill me? That's a laugh!

533
00:37:17,663 --> 00:37:19,003
I might some day.

534
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,528
Fat chance!

535
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:23,108
Where's the john?

536
00:37:24,171 --> 00:37:25,671
Down the hall and right.

537
00:37:25,672 --> 00:37:28,792
Don't come back with
any guns or anything.

538
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:31,677
You don't need any props,
do you, baby?

539
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:33,077
I'll bet not.

540
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:37,036
- No fake gun for you!
- May I leave my drink here?

541
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:40,821
Why not? We've got half-filled glasses
wherever Martha left them.

542
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:44,057
In the closet, the bathtub.
I found one in the freezer.

543
00:37:44,058 --> 00:37:47,028
- Oh, you did not!
- Yes, I did.

544
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:52,634
- Brandy gives you no hangover?
- I never mix.

545
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:55,968
- I don't drink very much either.
- Oh, good.

546
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,240
Your husband was telling us
about chromosomes.

547
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:04,046
- Chromosomes. He's a biologist.
- He's in the Math Department.

548
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:07,082
- Biologist.
- He's in the Math Department!

549
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:09,712
Biology.

550
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,720
Are you sure?

551
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,218
Well, I ought to be sure.

552
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,389
So he's a biologist. Good for him!

553
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,060
Biology's even better.

554
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:26,270
It's at the meat of things.
You're at the meat of things.

555
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:30,408
- She thought you were Math Department.
- Maybe I ought to be.

556
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:34,715
You stay right where you are.
Stay right at the meat of things.

557
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:37,584
You're obsessed by that phrase.
It's ugly.

558
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:39,145
You stay right there.

559
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:44,758
You can take over the History Department
as easy from there as any place else.

560
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:48,430
Somebody's got to take over
the History Department some day.

561
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:52,100
And it ain't gonna be Georgie-boy
over there, that's for sure.

562
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:54,626
Are you swampy, are you?

563
00:38:55,438 --> 00:38:59,108
In my mind you are bedded in cement
up to the neck.

564
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:01,609
No, up to the nose, it's quieter.

565
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:09,436
When is your son...

566
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:10,912
What?

567
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:13,035
Something about your son.

568
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:19,969
When is your son coming home?

569
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:28,973
When's our son coming home?

570
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:29,844
Never mind.

571
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:34,368
I want to know. You brought it up.
When's he coming home?

572
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:37,449
I said never mind.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

573
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,095
Him up! Not it! You brought him up,
more or less.

574
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:44,990
When's the little bugger appearing?
Isn't tomorrow his birthday?

575
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:47,327
I don't want to talk about it.

576
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:49,729
I don't want to talk about it!

577
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,365
She doesn't want to talk about it, him.

578
00:39:52,366 --> 00:39:55,233
Martha is sorry she brought it up. Him.

579
00:39:55,503 --> 00:39:58,154
When's the little bugger coming home?

580
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:04,345
Since you had the bad taste to
bring it up, when is the bugger coming?

581
00:40:04,346 --> 00:40:07,848
George talks disparagingly about
the little bugger...

582
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:09,875
... because he has problems.

583
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:12,456
What problems has the little bugger got?

584
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:15,526
Not the little bugger.
Stop calling him that!

585
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:20,294
- You! You've got problems!
- Never heard anything more ridiculous.

586
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:22,356
Neither have I!

587
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:27,372
George's biggest problem
about the... about our son...

588
00:40:27,373 --> 00:40:31,543
... about our great big son is that deep
down in the private pit of his gut...

589
00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:35,047
... he is not completely sure that it's
his own kid.

590
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:37,216
My God, you're a wicked woman!

591
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:41,887
And I've told you a million times,
I wouldn't conceive with anyone else.

592
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:43,753
A deeply wicked person.

593
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,594
I'm not sure this is a subject for...

594
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:51,695
Martha's lying. I want you
to know that Martha is lying.

595
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:55,268
There are few things I am certain of,
but the one thing...

596
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,039
... in this sinking world
that I am sure of...

597
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,442
... is my partnership,
my chromosomoligical partnership...

598
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:05,641
... in the creation of our blond-eyed,
blue-haired son.

599
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,080
I'm so glad.

600
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:12,521
- A very pretty speech, George.
- Thank you, Martha.

601
00:41:12,522 --> 00:41:15,855
You rose to the occasion good.
Real good.

602
00:41:16,192 --> 00:41:17,523
Well. Real well!

603
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:20,697
Martha knows better.

604
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:24,033
Yes, I've been to college
like everybody else.

605
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:27,526
George, our son does not
have blue hair.

606
00:41:27,872 --> 00:41:31,541
Or blue eyes for that matter.
He has green eyes like me.

607
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:33,875
Beautiful, beautiful green eyes.

608
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:35,880
He has blue eyes.

609
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:36,575
Green.

610
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:38,028
Blue, Martha.

611
00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:39,596
Green, you bastard!

612
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,945
Tut-tut yourself, you old floozy.

613
00:41:43,188 --> 00:41:44,884
He's not a floozie.

614
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:48,729
He can't be a floozie.
You're a floozie.

615
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,745
Now you just watch yourself!

616
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:52,396
All right!

617
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:56,517
I'd like another little nipper
of brandy please.

618
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:58,740
- I think you've had enough.
- Nonsense!

619
00:41:58,741 --> 00:42:01,556
- We're all ready, I think.
- Nonsense!

620
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:08,073
George has watery blue eyes,
kind of milky blue.

621
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:09,680
Make up your mind.

622
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,756
I gave you the benefit of a doubt.
Daddy has green eyes too.

623
00:42:13,757 --> 00:42:19,252
No, he has tiny red eyes, like a white
mouse. In fact, he is a white mouse.

624
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:22,766
You wouldn't say that if he was here.
You're a coward!

625
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:26,436
You know that shock of white hair
and these beady red eyes?

626
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:28,232
A great big white mouse.

627
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:33,778
George hates Daddy. Not for anything
Daddy's done to him, but for his own...

628
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:34,939
Inadequacies?

629
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,580
That's right.
You hit it right on the snout!

630
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:41,786
You know why the S. O. B.
Hates my father?

631
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:45,457
When George came to the History
Department, about 500 years ago...

632
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,125
... Daddy approved of him.

633
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:51,186
And you want to know what I did,
dumb cluck that I am?

634
00:42:51,464 --> 00:42:53,329
I fell for him!

635
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:55,132
I like that!

636
00:42:55,468 --> 00:42:57,637
She did, you should have seen it.

637
00:42:57,638 --> 00:43:01,441
She'd sit outside my room at night
and howl and claw at the turf.

638
00:43:01,442 --> 00:43:03,942
I couldn't work so I married her.

639
00:43:05,646 --> 00:43:07,477
I actually fell for him.

640
00:43:07,982 --> 00:43:09,814
It! That! There!

641
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:12,291
Martha's a romantic at heart.

642
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:14,481
That I am.

643
00:43:16,324 --> 00:43:20,658
I actually fell for him.
And the match seemed practical too.

644
00:43:21,497 --> 00:43:24,668
For a while Daddy thought
George had the stuff...

645
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:27,954
... to take over when
he was ready to retire.

646
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,507
- Stop it!
- What do you want?!

647
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:33,511
- I wouldn't go on if I were you.
- You wouldn't? Well, you're not!

648
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:36,748
You've already sprung a leak
about you-know-what.

649
00:43:36,749 --> 00:43:37,374
What?

650
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:40,043
About the little bugger. Our son.

651
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:42,520
If you start in on this, I warn you...

652
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:45,858
- I stand warned.
- Do we have to go through this?

653
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:49,261
Anyway, I married the S. O. B.
I had it all planned out.

654
00:43:49,262 --> 00:43:53,866
First he'd take over the History
Department, then the whole college.

655
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:55,868
That's how it was supposed to be!

656
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:56,905
Getting angry?

657
00:43:57,204 --> 00:44:00,707
That was how it was supposed to be.
All very simple.

658
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:03,877
Daddy thought it was a good idea too.
For a while!

659
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:06,880
Until he started watching
for a couple of years.

660
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:07,916
Getting angry?

661
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:10,551
Till he watched for a couple years...

662
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:13,554
... and started thinking
it wasn't such a good idea.

663
00:44:13,555 --> 00:44:16,840
That maybe Georgie-boy
didn't have the stuff!

664
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:18,959
That he didn't have it in him!

665
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,776
- Stop it, Martha!
- Like hell, I will!

666
00:44:22,465 --> 00:44:26,150
George didn't have much push.
He wasn't aggressive.

667
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:28,792
In fact, he was sort of a flop!

668
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:31,233
A great big, fat flop!

669
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:33,743
I said stop it!

670
00:44:34,078 --> 00:44:38,748
I hope that was an empty bottle.
You can't afford to waste good liquor.

671
00:44:38,749 --> 00:44:42,944
Not on your salary! Not on
an associate professor's salary!

672
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,584
So here I am, stuck with this flop...

673
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:49,593
... this bog in the History Department.

674
00:44:49,594 --> 00:44:52,429
Who's married
to the president's daughter...

675
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,423
... who's expected to be somebody.
Not just a nobody!

676
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:00,434
A bookworm who's so
goddamn complacent...

677
00:45:00,775 --> 00:45:03,443
... he can't make anything
out of himself.

678
00:45:03,444 --> 00:45:07,544
That doesn't have the guts
to make anybody proud of him!

679
00:45:09,618 --> 00:45:11,578
All right, George, stop it!

680
00:45:13,822 --> 00:45:15,522
I'm going to be sick!

681
00:45:48,193 --> 00:45:51,438
She'll be all right.
I'll make some coffee.

682
00:45:51,496 --> 00:45:54,226
- You sure?
- She'll be okay.

683
00:48:01,973 --> 00:48:03,658
I'm really very sorry.

684
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:10,138
She really shouldn't drink.
She's frail.

685
00:48:13,654 --> 00:48:15,449
Slim-hipped, as you say.

686
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:21,993
Where's my little yum-yum?
Where's Martha?

687
00:48:23,832 --> 00:48:26,787
I think she's going to make some coffee.

688
00:48:32,007 --> 00:48:33,968
She gets sick quite easily.

689
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,679
Martha? No, she hasn't been
sick a day in her life.

690
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,349
Unless you count time
she spends in the rest home.

691
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,840
No, no. My wife.

692
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:46,350
My wife gets sick quite easily.
Your wife is Martha.

693
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,690
I know.

694
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:56,008
She doesn't really spend any time
in a rest home?

695
00:48:56,368 --> 00:48:57,357
Your wife?

696
00:48:58,036 --> 00:48:59,025
No, yours.

697
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:01,202
Mine?

698
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:09,207
She doesn't. I would.

699
00:49:12,852 --> 00:49:15,548
If I were her... she... I would.

700
00:49:15,888 --> 00:49:18,473
But then I'm not and so I don't.

701
00:49:20,727 --> 00:49:22,354
I'd like to, though.

702
00:49:24,064 --> 00:49:27,154
It gets pretty bouncy
around here sometimes.

703
00:49:28,402 --> 00:49:29,577
Yes, I'm sure.

704
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:36,843
- Your wife throws up a lot?
- I didn't say that.

705
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:39,329
I said she gets sick quite easily.

706
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:42,416
By sick I thought that you meant she...

707
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:45,653
It's true, actually.
She does throw up a lot.

708
00:49:45,654 --> 00:49:47,049
The word is often.

709
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,672
Once she starts
there's practically no stopping.

710
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,140
She'll go right on for hours.

711
00:49:58,003 --> 00:49:59,630
Not all the time.

712
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:02,931
Regularly.

713
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:06,770
- You can tell time by her?
- Just about.

714
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:21,719
I married her because she was pregnant.

715
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:28,267
But you said you didn't have
any children.

716
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:30,533
She wasn't really. It was a...

717
00:50:31,939 --> 00:50:33,580
... hysterical pregnancy.

718
00:50:35,443 --> 00:50:38,606
She blew up and then she went down.

719
00:50:40,148 --> 00:50:42,813
And when she was up you married her?

720
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:45,849
Then she went down.

721
00:51:08,713 --> 00:51:10,613
When I was 16...

722
00:51:11,883 --> 00:51:15,663
... and going to prep school,
during the Punic Wars...

723
00:51:17,088 --> 00:51:20,324
... a bunch of us would go to town
the first day of vacation...

724
00:51:20,325 --> 00:51:23,030
... before we fanned out to our homes.

725
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:28,168
And in the evening
we would go to a gin mill...

726
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:31,171
... owned by the gangster-father
of one of us...

727
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:35,838
... and we would drink with the grown-ups
and listen to the jazz.

728
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:39,180
And one time, in the bunch of us...

729
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:40,739
... there was this...

730
00:51:41,283 --> 00:51:43,877
... boy who was 15...

731
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:49,337
... and he had killed his mother
with a shotgun some years before.

732
00:51:50,193 --> 00:51:52,184
Completely accidentally...

733
00:51:52,528 --> 00:51:57,164
... without even an unconscious
motivation, I have no doubt at all.

734
00:51:58,302 --> 00:52:01,704
And this one time this boy
went with us and...

735
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,900
... we ordered our drinks...

736
00:52:04,808 --> 00:52:07,693
... and when it came his turn he said...

737
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:09,713
“I'll have bergin.

738
00:52:10,415 --> 00:52:14,875
“Give me some bergin please.
Bergin and water. ”

739
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:19,513
We all laughed.

740
00:52:20,492 --> 00:52:25,520
He was blond and he had the face
of a cherub, and we all laughed.

741
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:30,735
And his cheeks went red
and the color rose in his neck.

742
00:52:30,736 --> 00:52:36,075
The waiter told people at the next table
what the boy said and they laughed...

743
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:40,726
... and then more people were told
and the laughter grew and grew.

744
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,482
No one was laughing more than us...

745
00:52:48,823 --> 00:52:53,268
... and none of us more than the boy
who had shot his mother.

746
00:52:55,162 --> 00:52:59,667
And soon everyone in the gin mill
knew what the laughter was about...

747
00:52:59,668 --> 00:53:04,745
... and everyone started ordering bergin
and laughing when they ordered it.

748
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:08,846
And soon, of course,
the laughter became less general...

749
00:53:08,847 --> 00:53:13,181
... but it did not subside entirely
for a very long time.

750
00:53:13,518 --> 00:53:16,510
For always at this table or that...

751
00:53:17,022 --> 00:53:19,242
... someone would order bergin...

752
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:23,859
... and a whole new area
of laughter would rise.

753
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:27,548
We drank free that night.

754
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:31,036
We were bought champagne
by the management...

755
00:53:31,037 --> 00:53:34,201
... by the gangster-father of one of us.

756
00:53:36,376 --> 00:53:40,039
And, of course,
we suffered the next day...

757
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,715
... each of us alone,
on his train away from the city...

758
00:53:46,454 --> 00:53:50,220
... and each of us
with a grown-up's hangover.

759
00:53:52,727 --> 00:53:54,922
But it was the grandest day...

760
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:57,562
... of my...

761
00:53:59,101 --> 00:54:00,432
... youth.

762
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:14,399
What happened to the boy?

763
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,328
The boy who had shot his mother.

764
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,702
I won't tell you.

765
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:29,332
The next summer on a country road,
with his learner's permit...

766
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:34,549
... and his father sitting to his right,
he swerved to avoid a porcupine...

767
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:38,010
... and drove straight into a large tree.

768
00:54:40,247 --> 00:54:42,387
He was not killed, of course.

769
00:54:42,983 --> 00:54:46,820
In the hospital when he was conscious
and out of danger...

770
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:50,036
... when they told him
his father was dead...

771
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:53,984
... he began to laugh, I have been told.

772
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,994
And his laughter grew
and would not stop.

773
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:05,006
And it was not until after
they'd jammed a needle in his arm...

774
00:55:05,007 --> 00:55:09,342
... not until his consciousness
had slipped away from him...

775
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,342
... that his laughter subsided. Stopped.

776
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:18,187
When he recovered
from his injuries enough...

777
00:55:18,188 --> 00:55:22,853
... so he could be moved without damage
should he struggle...

778
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,281
... he was put in an asylum.

779
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,441
That was thirty years ago.

780
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,533
Is he still there?

781
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:38,601
Oh, yes.

782
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,875
I'm told that for these thirty years...

783
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:45,881
... he has not uttered...

784
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:50,216
... one sound.

785
00:56:12,447 --> 00:56:13,842
That's Big Martha.

786
00:56:14,616 --> 00:56:16,123
She's making coffee.

787
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:21,085
For your hysterical wife,
who goes up and down.

788
00:56:22,093 --> 00:56:22,821
Went.

789
00:56:23,428 --> 00:56:24,952
Up and down.

790
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,421
Went? And no more?

791
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:30,594
No more. Nothing.

792
00:56:33,105 --> 00:56:36,070
Martha doesn't have
hysterical pregnancies.

793
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:38,543
My wife had one.

794
00:56:38,777 --> 00:56:41,537
Martha doesn't have pregnancies at all.

795
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:48,801
Do you have any other kids,
any daughters or anything?

796
00:56:49,956 --> 00:56:51,787
Do we have any what?

797
00:56:55,128 --> 00:56:57,794
I mean, do you only have
the one...

798
00:56:58,032 --> 00:56:59,624
... kid, your son?

799
00:57:01,802 --> 00:57:03,292
No, just one.

800
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:06,200
One boy.

801
00:57:07,642 --> 00:57:09,008
Our son.

802
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:15,511
That's nice.

803
00:57:18,153 --> 00:57:20,145
He's a comfort.

804
00:57:21,991 --> 00:57:23,322
He's a beanbag.

805
00:57:26,462 --> 00:57:27,429
A what?

806
00:57:27,664 --> 00:57:30,134
A beanbag. You wouldn't understand.

807
00:57:31,835 --> 00:57:33,564
A beanbag!

808
00:57:33,771 --> 00:57:37,507
I heard! I didn't say I was deaf,
I said I didn't understand!

809
00:57:37,508 --> 00:57:42,353
- You didn't say that at all.
- I was implying I didn't understand.

810
00:57:44,349 --> 00:57:46,016
- You're getting testy.
- I'm sorry!

811
00:57:46,017 --> 00:57:50,854
I just said our son, the apple of
our 3 eyes, Martha being a Cyclops...

812
00:57:50,855 --> 00:57:53,359
... our son is a beanbag,
and you get testy.

813
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,863
It's late, I'm tired.
I've been drinking since 9 o'clock.

814
00:57:56,864 --> 00:58:00,467
My wife is vomiting.
There's been a lot of screaming here.

815
00:58:00,468 --> 00:58:02,936
You get testy, naturally.
Don't worry about it.

816
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:06,306
Anybody coming here gets testy.
Don't be upset.

817
00:58:06,307 --> 00:58:08,738
- I'm not upset.
- You're testy.

818
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:17,838
I'd like to set you straight
about something while we're out here.

819
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:20,048
About something Martha said.

820
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:23,382
Hark! Forest sounds.

821
00:58:24,394 --> 00:58:25,725
Animal noises.

822
00:58:28,298 --> 00:58:30,232
Oh, well, here's nursie!

823
00:58:31,234 --> 00:58:34,010
We're sitting up, we're having coffee.

824
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:37,434
Is there anything I should do?

825
00:58:37,575 --> 00:58:42,130
No, you just stay there
and listen to Georgie's side of things.

826
00:58:42,413 --> 00:58:44,084
Bore yourself to death!

827
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:47,249
You clean up the mess you made in here?

828
00:58:47,252 --> 00:58:50,787
No, Martha, I did not
clean up the mess I made.

829
00:58:51,623 --> 00:58:55,739
I've been trying for years
to clean up the mess I made.

830
00:58:55,762 --> 00:58:57,663
Have you been trying for years?

831
00:58:57,664 --> 00:58:59,757
Accommodation, adjustment...

832
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:02,968
... those do seem to be
in the order of things.

833
00:59:02,969 --> 00:59:05,103
Don't put me in the same class with you.

834
00:59:05,104 --> 00:59:08,970
No, of course not.
I mean things are simpler for you.

835
00:59:09,743 --> 00:59:12,445
You marry a woman
because she's all blown up.

836
00:59:12,446 --> 00:59:17,417
- Where I, in my old-fashioned way...
- There was more to it than that.

837
00:59:17,418 --> 00:59:19,684
Sure. I bet she has money too.

838
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:23,249
Yes.

839
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:31,968
You mean I was right? I hit it?

840
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:35,837
My God, what archery! First try, too.
How about that?

841
00:59:36,474 --> 00:59:38,675
- There were other things.
- Yes.

842
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,303
To compensate.

843
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:43,010
There always are.

844
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:45,345
Allow me.

845
00:59:48,153 --> 00:59:51,145
Tell me about your wife's money.

846
00:59:54,393 --> 00:59:55,325
No.

847
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:57,228
Okay, don't.

848
01:00:01,301 --> 01:00:04,271
My father-in-law was a man of the Lord.

849
01:00:05,305 --> 01:00:06,935
And he was very rich.

850
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:08,297
What faith?

851
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:12,428
My father-in-law...

852
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:16,999
... was called by God
when he was six or something.

853
01:00:18,486 --> 01:00:23,177
He started preaching, baptized people,
and he saved them and then...

854
01:00:24,993 --> 01:00:29,573
... he traveled around a lot and
became pretty famous. Not like...

855
01:00:30,499 --> 01:00:32,170
... some of them but...

856
01:00:33,669 --> 01:00:35,432
... pretty famous.

857
01:00:38,341 --> 01:00:41,021
When he died he had a lot of money.

858
01:00:41,944 --> 01:00:44,505
- God's money?
- No, his own.

859
01:00:45,582 --> 01:00:50,027
- What about God's money?
- He spent it and he saved his own.

860
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:52,774
I think that's very nice.

861
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,552
Martha has money because...

862
01:00:57,762 --> 01:01:00,595
... Martha's father's second wife...

863
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:04,236
... not Martha's mother,
but after her mother died...

864
01:01:04,237 --> 01:01:06,228
... was a very old lady...

865
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,535
... who had warts, who was very rich.

866
01:01:10,111 --> 01:01:11,510
She was a witch!

867
01:01:13,181 --> 01:01:16,349
She was a good witch,
and she married the white mouse...

868
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,852
... with the red eyes,
and he must have...

869
01:01:18,853 --> 01:01:21,652
... nibbled her warts
or something...

870
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:27,618
... because she went up in a
puff of smoke almost immediately.

871
01:01:29,965 --> 01:01:33,871
And all that was left,
apart from some wart medicine...

872
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:36,438
... was a big, fat will.

873
01:01:41,544 --> 01:01:44,514
Maybe my father-in-law...

874
01:01:44,748 --> 01:01:48,983
... and the witch with the warts
should have gotten together.

875
01:01:49,253 --> 01:01:51,283
Because he was a mouse too.

876
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:54,891
- He was?
- Sure!

877
01:01:57,596 --> 01:01:59,427
He was a church mouse!

878
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:19,139
Your wife never mentioned a stepmother.

879
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,195
Maybe it isn't true.

880
01:02:23,123 --> 01:02:26,993
You realize I've been
drawing you out on this stuff...

881
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:30,863
... because you're a threat to me
and I want to get the goods on you.

882
01:02:30,864 --> 01:02:31,854
Sure.

883
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:34,401
I've warned you. You stand warned.

884
01:02:34,402 --> 01:02:35,960
I stand warned.

885
01:02:38,406 --> 01:02:41,644
You sneaky types
worry me the most, you know.

886
01:02:41,645 --> 01:02:44,981
You ineffectual sons of bitches,
you're the worst.

887
01:02:44,982 --> 01:02:49,677
I'm glad you don't believe me.
You've got history on your side.

888
01:02:50,154 --> 01:02:54,157
You've got history on your side.
I've got biology on mine.

889
01:02:54,158 --> 01:02:56,150
History, biology.

890
01:02:56,495 --> 01:02:58,829
- I know the difference.
- You don't act it.

891
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:03,167
We decided you'd take over the History
Department first, then the whole works.

892
01:03:03,168 --> 01:03:04,578
A step at a time.

893
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:12,550
What I thought I'd do is sort of
insinuate myself generally. You know!

894
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:14,474
Find all the weak spots.

895
01:03:15,715 --> 01:03:16,739
Like me.

896
01:03:17,517 --> 01:03:21,511
Become sort of a fact
and then turn into a...

897
01:03:23,924 --> 01:03:26,688
- A what?
- An inevitability?

898
01:03:27,194 --> 01:03:28,286
Exactly!

899
01:03:28,495 --> 01:03:30,360
An inevitability.

900
01:03:31,031 --> 01:03:34,207
Take over a few courses
from the older men.

901
01:03:36,371 --> 01:03:38,362
Plow a few pertinent wives.

902
01:03:38,707 --> 01:03:39,882
Now that's it!

903
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:43,378
You can shove aside
all the older men...

904
01:03:43,379 --> 01:03:46,881
... but until you're plowing pertinent
wives you're not working.

905
01:03:46,882 --> 01:03:49,727
That's the way to power. Plow 'em all!

906
01:03:52,054 --> 01:03:53,722
The way to a man's heart...

907
01:03:53,723 --> 01:03:57,827
... the wide, inviting avenue to his job
is through his wife...

908
01:03:57,828 --> 01:03:59,495
... and don't you forget it.

909
01:03:59,496 --> 01:04:04,341
I bet your wife's got the most inviting
avenue on the whole campus!

910
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,344
I mean, her father
being president and all.

911
01:04:11,743 --> 01:04:14,308
You bet your historical inevitability.

912
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:18,283
I just better get her off
into the bushes right away.

913
01:04:18,284 --> 01:04:19,955
You'd certainly better.

914
01:04:22,757 --> 01:04:24,952
I almost think you're serious.

915
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:28,762
No, you almost think you're serious.
And it scares you.

916
01:04:28,763 --> 01:04:29,525
Me?

917
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:30,995
Yes, you.

918
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:32,359
You're kidding!

919
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:36,604
I wish I were. I'll give you some
good advice if you want me to.

920
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:38,220
Good advice? From you?

921
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:43,773
You haven't learned yet. Take it
wherever you can get it. Listen.

922
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,767
I'm giving you good advice now.

923
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:51,787
There's quicksand here and you'll be
dragged down before you know it.

924
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:53,016
Sucked down!

925
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:58,127
You disgust me on principle and you're
a smug son of a bitch...

926
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:01,998
... but I'm trying to give you
a survival kit. Do you hear me?

927
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:04,133
I hear you. You come in loud.

928
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:06,302
You want to play it by ear, right?

929
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:10,307
Everything will work out anyway,
because the timetable's history, right?

930
01:05:10,308 --> 01:05:13,644
Right. Just tend to your knitting,
grandma. I'll be okay.

931
01:05:13,645 --> 01:05:14,976
I've tried to...

932
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,815
... tried to reach you, to...

933
01:05:17,816 --> 01:05:18,805
Make contact?

934
01:05:19,985 --> 01:05:20,974
Communicate?

935
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,309
Yes, exactly.

936
01:05:22,655 --> 01:05:27,375
Aw, that's touching. That's downright
moving, that's what that is.

937
01:05:27,493 --> 01:05:28,619
Up yours!

938
01:05:28,828 --> 01:05:31,627
- What?
- You heard me.

939
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:42,007
You take the trouble
to construct a civilization...

940
01:05:42,008 --> 01:05:46,673
... to build a society based on
the principles of... principle.

941
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:51,852
You make government and art and realize
they are, must be, the same.

942
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:56,906
You bring things to the saddest point,
where there is something to lose.

943
01:05:57,027 --> 01:05:59,696
Then, all at once,
through all the music...

944
01:05:59,697 --> 01:06:02,365
... through the sensible sounds
of building...

945
01:06:02,366 --> 01:06:04,821
... attempting, comes the Dies Irae.

946
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:08,100
And what is it?
What does the trumpet sound?

947
01:06:08,206 --> 01:06:09,537
Up yours!

948
01:06:15,714 --> 01:06:19,378
Here we are.
A little shaky, but on our feet.

949
01:06:19,585 --> 01:06:21,853
It wasn't too bad, dear, really.

950
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:24,756
- I'm not cold.
- Just put it on, we're leaving.

951
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:27,058
- You're what?
- We're going home.

952
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:29,584
What's been going on here?

953
01:06:29,796 --> 01:06:31,998
- What have you been up to?
- I'll get the car.

954
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:33,354
I'll call a cab.

955
01:06:34,868 --> 01:06:37,270
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

956
01:06:37,271 --> 01:06:40,072
Now let me see.
I think what I'm doing is...

957
01:06:40,073 --> 01:06:44,238
... I'm getting the car to take
our little guests home.

958
01:06:54,923 --> 01:06:56,925
Aren't you going to apologize?

959
01:06:56,926 --> 01:06:58,760
The road should've been straight.

960
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:01,095
Not that. For making her throw up.

961
01:07:01,096 --> 01:07:04,432
- I did not make her throw up.
- You certainly did.

962
01:07:04,433 --> 01:07:08,103
Who do you think did, sexy there?
He made his own wife sick?

963
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:10,639
- You make me sick.
- That's different.

964
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,608
Please! I throw up.

965
01:07:12,943 --> 01:07:15,945
I get sick occasionally all by myself,
without reason.

966
01:07:15,946 --> 01:07:18,614
- Is that a fact?
- You're delicate, honey.

967
01:07:18,615 --> 01:07:20,191
I've always done it.

968
01:07:20,251 --> 01:07:21,616
Like Big Ben?

969
01:07:21,819 --> 01:07:22,945
Watch it.

970
01:07:23,287 --> 01:07:27,023
George makes everybody sick.
When our son was a little boy...

971
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:29,794
... he threw up all the time
because of George.

972
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:34,667
It got so whenever George came into
a room, he'd start right in retching.

973
01:07:34,668 --> 01:07:37,623
Our son used to throw up all the time...

974
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:39,973
... because you were always
fiddling at him.

975
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:42,977
Into his bedroom,
kimono flying, fiddling...

976
01:07:42,978 --> 01:07:46,313
I suppose that's why he ran away
twice in one month.

977
01:07:46,314 --> 01:07:49,483
Twice in one month!
Six times in one year...

978
01:07:49,484 --> 01:07:53,320
Our son ran away from home
because Martha used to corner him.

979
01:07:53,321 --> 01:07:56,825
I never cornered
the son of a bitch in my life!

980
01:07:56,826 --> 01:08:01,162
He'd run to me when I got home
and say, “Mama's always coming at me. ”

981
01:08:01,163 --> 01:08:02,255
Liar!

982
01:08:03,332 --> 01:08:05,834
Always coming at him.
Very embarrassing!

983
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:09,338
If it was so embarrassing,
why are you talking about it?

984
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:11,674
I didn't want to talk about it at all.

985
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:15,610
I wish I had some brandy.
I love brandy, I really do.

986
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:18,247
- Good for you.
- It steadies me.

987
01:08:18,248 --> 01:08:20,012
I used to drink brandy.

988
01:08:20,685 --> 01:08:22,686
You used to drink bergin, too.

989
01:08:22,687 --> 01:08:23,902
Shut up, Martha!

990
01:08:26,591 --> 01:08:28,388
- What?
- Nothing.

991
01:08:30,028 --> 01:08:34,365
Did he tell you about that?
Come on, he must have said something.

992
01:08:34,366 --> 01:08:38,436
Actually what we did is
we sort of danced around a little.

993
01:08:38,437 --> 01:08:40,522
I love dancing. I really do.

994
01:08:40,706 --> 01:08:41,873
He didn't mean that.

995
01:08:41,874 --> 01:08:45,975
Well, I didn't think that he did!
Two grown men dancing!

996
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:51,984
He didn't tell how he tried to publish
a book and Daddy wouldn't let him?

997
01:08:51,985 --> 01:08:54,253
- A book? What book?
- Just a book.

998
01:08:54,254 --> 01:08:55,722
Just a book!

999
01:08:56,057 --> 01:08:57,490
Oh, look, dancing!

1000
01:08:57,959 --> 01:09:01,149
Why don't we dance?
I'd love some dancing.

1001
01:09:01,228 --> 01:09:03,396
- We're almost home.
- I want some dancing!

1002
01:09:03,397 --> 01:09:06,568
- That's not such a bad idea.
- Don't you love dancing?

1003
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:10,310
- With the right man, yeah.
- I dance like the wind.

1004
01:09:11,075 --> 01:09:13,737
Stop the car. We're going dancing!

1005
01:09:13,944 --> 01:09:16,829
- For heaven's sake!
- Did you hear me?

1006
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:18,673
Whatever love wants.

1007
01:09:25,357 --> 01:09:27,222
I dance like the wind!

1008
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,421
Put one on, will you?

1009
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,432
How are we going to work this,
mixed doubles?

1010
01:09:34,433 --> 01:09:36,768
You don't think I'm going
to dance with you?

1011
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:39,838
Not with him around.
And not with twinkle-toes either.

1012
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,469
I'll dance with anyone!
I'll dance with myself!

1013
01:09:44,277 --> 01:09:48,307
- Honey, you'll get sick again.
- I dance like the wind!

1014
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:56,349
All right, kiddies, choose up
and hit the sack.

1015
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:59,119
All right, George, cut that out!

1016
01:10:04,465 --> 01:10:05,915
Cut it out, George!

1017
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:07,448
What, Martha?

1018
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:10,902
All right, you son of a bitch!

1019
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,940
- What'd you say, love?
- It stopped!

1020
01:10:12,941 --> 01:10:14,408
Why did it stop?

1021
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,947
I said give me some change.

1022
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,181
Stop that!

1023
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,988
You are always at me
when I'm having a good time!

1024
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:30,492
Just leave me alone. I like to dance
and you don't want me to.

1025
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,655
Just leave me alone!

1026
01:10:37,468 --> 01:10:39,318
Choose it. Do your stuff.

1027
01:10:39,837 --> 01:10:41,342
You're damned right.

1028
01:10:41,472 --> 01:10:42,942
Hi, sexy!

1029
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:45,460
You want to dance, angel boobs?

1030
01:10:46,313 --> 01:10:48,178
What'd you call my wife?

1031
01:10:49,149 --> 01:10:53,486
No, if I can't do my interpretive dance,
I don't want to dance at all.

1032
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:55,008
I'll just sit here.

1033
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:57,175
Okay, stuff, let's go.

1034
01:11:01,663 --> 01:11:05,183
- We'll just sit here and watch.
- That's right.

1035
01:11:17,012 --> 01:11:19,174
You are strong, aren't you?

1036
01:11:19,683 --> 01:11:21,014
I like that.

1037
01:11:22,252 --> 01:11:24,286
They dance like they've danced before.

1038
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:27,612
A familiar dance, monkey nipples,
they know it.

1039
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:29,791
I don't know what you mean.

1040
01:11:32,196 --> 01:11:35,098
- I like the way you move.
- I like the way you move too.

1041
01:11:35,099 --> 01:11:38,384
- They like the way they move.
- That's nice.

1042
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:43,471
I'm surprised George didn't tell you
his side of things.

1043
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:46,043
- Well, he didn't.
- That surprises me.

1044
01:11:46,044 --> 01:11:48,045
- Does it?
- Aren't they cute?

1045
01:11:48,046 --> 01:11:49,947
He usually does when he can.

1046
01:11:49,948 --> 01:11:51,716
I don't think he trusts me.

1047
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:56,052
It's really a very sad story.

1048
01:11:57,056 --> 01:11:59,889
It would make you weep.

1049
01:12:00,226 --> 01:12:02,351
You have ugly talents, Martha.

1050
01:12:02,495 --> 01:12:03,962
Is that so?

1051
01:12:05,165 --> 01:12:06,671
Don't encourage her.

1052
01:12:06,734 --> 01:12:07,894
Encourage me.

1053
01:12:08,402 --> 01:12:10,036
I warned you, don't encourage her!

1054
01:12:10,037 --> 01:12:11,265
He warned you.

1055
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,869
- Don't encourage me.
- I heard him. Tell me more.

1056
01:12:20,484 --> 01:12:23,299
Georgie-boy had lots of big ambitions...

1057
01:12:23,587 --> 01:12:26,422
... in spite of something funny
in his past...

1058
01:12:26,423 --> 01:12:29,559
... which Georgie-boy here
turned into a novel.

1059
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,190
His first attempt and also his last!

1060
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:36,191
I rhymed!

1061
01:12:38,236 --> 01:12:39,362
I warn you!

1062
01:12:40,104 --> 01:12:44,098
But Daddy took a look
at Georgie's novel.

1063
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:46,477
You're looking for a punch in the mouth.

1064
01:12:46,478 --> 01:12:47,604
Do tell!

1065
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,748
And he was very shocked by what he read.

1066
01:12:50,749 --> 01:12:52,614
- He was?
- Yes, he was.

1067
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,888
A novel all about a naughty boy-child.

1068
01:12:56,189 --> 01:12:57,623
I will not tolerate this!

1069
01:12:57,624 --> 01:12:58,818
Oh, can it!

1070
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,783
A naughty boy-child...

1071
01:13:02,195 --> 01:13:05,562
... who killed his mother...

1072
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:08,128
... and his father dead!

1073
01:13:09,303 --> 01:13:10,292
Stop it!

1074
01:13:12,807 --> 01:13:14,808
And Daddy said, “Look here...

1075
01:13:14,809 --> 01:13:18,370
“... I will not let you
publish such a thing! “

1076
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:20,097
The dancing's over!

1077
01:13:20,315 --> 01:13:21,646
Violence!

1078
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:23,420
And Daddy said...

1079
01:13:23,485 --> 01:13:28,322
... ”You don't think I'm going to
let you publish this kind of crap? “

1080
01:13:28,323 --> 01:13:31,326
“Not on your life,
not while you're teaching here. ”

1081
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:34,862
“You publish that
and you're out on your ass! “

1082
01:13:35,164 --> 01:13:36,825
Desist! Desist!

1083
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:39,835
I will not be made mock of.

1084
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:43,172
He will not be made mock of,
for cripes sake!

1085
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:44,513
The game is over!

1086
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:46,232
Just imagine...

1087
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:51,180
... a book all about a boy who murders
his mother and kills his father...

1088
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:53,886
... and pretends it's all an accident.

1089
01:13:54,285 --> 01:13:55,880
Hey, wait a minute!

1090
01:13:56,356 --> 01:13:58,524
You want to know the clincher?

1091
01:13:58,525 --> 01:14:02,445
You want to know what
big brave Georgie said to Daddy?

1092
01:14:04,631 --> 01:14:06,360
But Daddy...

1093
01:14:07,035 --> 01:14:10,640
I mean, “But, Sir, this isn't
a novel at all. ”

1094
01:14:10,705 --> 01:14:12,039
You will not say this!

1095
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,540
The hell, I won't! Keep away!

1096
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,876
“No, sir, this is no novel at all. ”

1097
01:14:15,877 --> 01:14:19,347
“This is the truth.
This really happened to me! “

1098
01:14:19,348 --> 01:14:21,714
- I'll kill you.
- It happened!

1099
01:14:25,354 --> 01:14:26,286
Violence!

1100
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,465
Very quiet now.

1101
01:14:39,369 --> 01:14:40,734
We'll all be...

1102
01:14:41,104 --> 01:14:42,402
... very quiet.

1103
01:14:46,777 --> 01:14:47,607
Murderer!

1104
01:14:49,413 --> 01:14:51,443
What's the trouble in here?

1105
01:14:51,582 --> 01:14:54,508
Nothing. No trouble,
just playing a game.

1106
01:14:56,388 --> 01:14:57,893
Well, we're closing.

1107
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,318
One more round.

1108
01:14:59,524 --> 01:15:00,904
Same for everybody.

1109
01:15:00,926 --> 01:15:03,828
Give us one more round
and we'll be on our merry way.

1110
01:15:03,829 --> 01:15:05,922
All right? Good!

1111
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:07,064
Thanks.

1112
01:15:12,605 --> 01:15:15,905
Well, that's one game.
What shall we do now?

1113
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:22,356
Let's do something else. We played
Humiliate the Host, what'll we do now?

1114
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:24,383
Oh, look!

1115
01:15:25,285 --> 01:15:27,553
We must know other games,
us college types.

1116
01:15:27,554 --> 01:15:30,591
- Can't be the limit of our vocabulary.
- Haven't had enough?

1117
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:32,209
There are other games.

1118
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:33,823
How about...

1119
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:37,164
How about Hump the Hostess?

1120
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:42,024
Want to play that one? Do you want
to play Hump the Hostess?

1121
01:15:42,306 --> 01:15:44,441
Or do you want to wait till later,
off in the bushes?

1122
01:15:44,442 --> 01:15:45,675
Hump the Hostess!

1123
01:15:45,676 --> 01:15:47,016
Will you shut up?

1124
01:16:03,328 --> 01:16:06,999
You want to save that for later.
What shall we play now?

1125
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,505
- Portrait of a Man Drowning.
- I'm not drowning.

1126
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:13,338
- You told me to shut up.
- I'm sorry.

1127
01:16:13,339 --> 01:16:14,224
I'm sorry!

1128
01:16:15,942 --> 01:16:17,376
I know what we do.

1129
01:16:17,377 --> 01:16:20,880
Now that we've done this round
of Humiliate the Host...

1130
01:16:20,881 --> 01:16:23,383
... and don't want to play
Hump the Hostess yet.

1131
01:16:23,384 --> 01:16:26,886
I know what! How about a little round
of Get the Guests?

1132
01:16:26,887 --> 01:16:29,137
How about that? Get the Guests?

1133
01:16:30,057 --> 01:16:32,059
Book dropper, child mentioner!

1134
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,227
I don't like these games.

1135
01:16:33,228 --> 01:16:37,731
We've only had one game, we've got to
have another. You can't fly on one.

1136
01:16:37,732 --> 01:16:38,664
Silence!

1137
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:41,368
How will we play Get the Guests?

1138
01:16:41,369 --> 01:16:42,420
You be quiet!

1139
01:16:42,638 --> 01:16:44,367
I wonder.

1140
01:16:49,912 --> 01:16:53,949
Martha, in her indiscreet way,
told you all about my first novel.

1141
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,419
True or false that there
was such a thing.

1142
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:59,589
She told you about my first novel,
my memory book.

1143
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:02,425
I preferred she hadn't, but
that's blood under the bridge.

1144
01:17:02,426 --> 01:17:04,917
But what Martha didn't tell you...

1145
01:17:05,262 --> 01:17:08,601
... what Martha didn't tell at all about
was my second novel.

1146
01:17:08,602 --> 01:17:12,357
You didn't know about that, did you?
True or false?

1147
01:17:13,273 --> 01:17:16,106
Well, it's an allegory really, probably.

1148
01:17:16,443 --> 01:17:20,280
It's about a nice young couple
who comes out of the Middle West.

1149
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:21,948
It's a bucolic, you see.

1150
01:17:21,949 --> 01:17:24,818
This nice young couple
comes out of the Middle West.

1151
01:17:24,819 --> 01:17:27,120
He's blond and he's about thirty.

1152
01:17:27,121 --> 01:17:30,614
And he's a scientist,
a teacher, a scientist.

1153
01:17:30,959 --> 01:17:35,020
- His mouse, wifey, gargles brandy...
- Just a minute here!

1154
01:17:35,297 --> 01:17:37,732
This is my game!
You've had your game!

1155
01:17:37,733 --> 01:17:39,667
I want to hear. I love stories.

1156
01:17:39,668 --> 01:17:41,969
Mousie's father was a holy man, see?

1157
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:46,308
He ran a traveling clip joint and he
took the faithful, just took them.

1158
01:17:46,309 --> 01:17:48,654
- This is familiar.
- No kidding.

1159
01:17:48,811 --> 01:17:53,006
Anyway, Blondie and his frau
out of the Plains States came.

1160
01:17:53,149 --> 01:17:54,811
Very funny, George.

1161
01:17:55,386 --> 01:17:56,201
Thank you.

1162
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,788
They settled in a town
like Nouveau Carthage.

1163
01:17:58,789 --> 01:18:00,823
- I don't think you should go on.
- Do you not?

1164
01:18:00,824 --> 01:18:02,992
I love familiar stories.
They're the best.

1165
01:18:02,993 --> 01:18:06,664
How right you are! But Blondie
was all in disguise as a teacher...

1166
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:11,425
... because his baggage ticket had
bigger things writ on it. H. I. !

1167
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:13,143
Historical Inevitability.

1168
01:18:13,338 --> 01:18:16,674
- There's no reason to go further.
- Let them go on.

1169
01:18:16,675 --> 01:18:21,012
He had this baggage, and part of his
baggage was in the form of his mouse.

1170
01:18:21,013 --> 01:18:22,480
We don't have to listen.

1171
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:24,282
- Why not?
- She has a point.

1172
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,352
Nobody could figure out
Blondie's baggage, his mouse.

1173
01:18:27,353 --> 01:18:31,357
I mean, here he was pan-Kansas
swimming champion or something...

1174
01:18:31,358 --> 01:18:32,858
... and he had this mouse.

1175
01:18:32,859 --> 01:18:36,862
Of whom he was solicitous to a point
that faileth human understanding...

1176
01:18:36,863 --> 01:18:39,365
... given that she was
something of a simp.

1177
01:18:39,366 --> 01:18:41,033
This just isn't fair of you.

1178
01:18:41,034 --> 01:18:44,137
Perhaps not. His mouse
tooted brandy immodestly...

1179
01:18:44,138 --> 01:18:46,875
... and spent half her time
in the upchuck.

1180
01:18:46,876 --> 01:18:48,544
- I know these people.
- Do you?

1181
01:18:48,545 --> 01:18:51,213
But she was money baggage
among other things.

1182
01:18:51,214 --> 01:18:56,052
Godly money from the golden teeth of the
unfaithful and she was put up with!

1183
01:18:56,053 --> 01:18:59,389
- I don't like this story.
- And she was put up with!

1184
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:00,322
Stop? Hah!

1185
01:19:00,524 --> 01:19:03,159
- Please, please, don't.
- Beg, baby!

1186
01:19:04,061 --> 01:19:07,277
- Flashback to “How they got married. ”
- No!

1187
01:19:07,566 --> 01:19:10,381
- Why?
- How they got married was this.

1188
01:19:10,402 --> 01:19:13,177
The mouse got all puffed up one day...

1189
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:17,575
... and she went over to Blondie's house
and stuck out her puff...

1190
01:19:17,576 --> 01:19:19,244
... and she said, “Look at me. ”

1191
01:19:19,245 --> 01:19:20,579
I don't like this.

1192
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:25,250
“Look at me, I'm all puffed up. ”
“Oh, my goodness, ” said Blondie.

1193
01:19:25,251 --> 01:19:27,101
And so they were married.

1194
01:19:28,855 --> 01:19:29,982
And then what?

1195
01:19:30,257 --> 01:19:33,942
And then the puff went away again
like magic. Poof!

1196
01:19:36,764 --> 01:19:38,214
The puff went away?

1197
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:43,929
Honey, I didn't mean to. Honestly.

1198
01:19:47,442 --> 01:19:49,808
You shouldn't have told them!

1199
01:19:50,011 --> 01:19:53,003
No! You couldn't have told them!

1200
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:57,050
And that's how you play Get the Guests.

1201
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,120
Oh, please! I'm going to be sick!

1202
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:09,470
You shouldn't have done that.

1203
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:12,334
- I hate hypocrisy.
- That was cruel and vicious.

1204
01:20:12,335 --> 01:20:14,470
She'll get over it. She'll recover.

1205
01:20:14,471 --> 01:20:16,238
- And damaging to me.
- To you!

1206
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:17,035
To me!

1207
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:25,023
Beautiful. You got to have a swine
to show you where the truffles are.

1208
01:20:25,218 --> 01:20:28,687
Rearrange your alliances.
Make the best of things.

1209
01:20:28,688 --> 01:20:30,457
Put your wife in the car.

1210
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,193
I've had enough rides tonight.
We'll walk.

1211
01:20:33,194 --> 01:20:35,844
Right, you go plan some new strategy.

1212
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:38,631
You'll regret this.

1213
01:20:38,632 --> 01:20:40,700
No doubt. I regret everything.

1214
01:20:40,701 --> 01:20:42,870
No, I mean I'll make you regret this.

1215
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,205
Clean up the mess.

1216
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:45,311
You just wait.

1217
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,876
- Very good, George.
- Thank you.

1218
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:51,378
- Really good!
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1219
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:55,908
I mean, you did a good job.
You really fixed it.

1220
01:20:57,553 --> 01:21:00,388
That's the most life you've shown
in a long time.

1221
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:02,599
You bring out the best in me.

1222
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:07,579
You really are a bastard!

1223
01:21:07,898 --> 01:21:11,018
You can go around like
a hopped-up Arab...

1224
01:21:11,235 --> 01:21:14,704
... slashing at everything,
scarring up half the world...

1225
01:21:14,705 --> 01:21:17,573
... but let somebody else try it?
Oh no!

1226
01:21:17,574 --> 01:21:22,579
Why, baby, I did it all for you!
I thought you'd like it, sweetheart.

1227
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:25,649
It's to your taste,
blood, carnage and all.

1228
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,085
I thought you'd sort of get excited.

1229
01:21:28,086 --> 01:21:31,756
Heave and pant and come running at me,
your melons bobbling...

1230
01:21:31,757 --> 01:21:34,227
You have really screwed up, George.

1231
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,790
I mean it! You really have!

1232
01:21:37,696 --> 01:21:39,764
You can sit,
gin running from your mouth...

1233
01:21:39,765 --> 01:21:44,103
... you can humiliate me, tear me to
pieces all night, it's perfectly okay.

1234
01:21:44,104 --> 01:21:45,444
You can stand it!

1235
01:21:45,605 --> 01:21:46,939
I cannot stand it!

1236
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:49,950
You can stand it!
You married me for it!

1237
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:54,948
That's a desperately sick lie.

1238
01:21:54,949 --> 01:21:57,049
Don't you know it even yet?

1239
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,830
My arm's gotten tired whipping you.

1240
01:22:03,626 --> 01:22:06,192
- Year after year!
- Deluded, Martha.

1241
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,797
It's not what I wanted.

1242
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:11,134
I thought at least you were onto
yourself. I didn't know.

1243
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:12,466
No. You're sick!

1244
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:16,933
I'll show you who's sick!

1245
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:35,568
You really are having
a field day, aren't you?

1246
01:22:37,163 --> 01:22:40,999
Well, I'm gonna finish you
before I'm through with you.

1247
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,203
You and that quarterback?
You both going to finish me?

1248
01:22:44,204 --> 01:22:48,841
Before I'm through with you you'll
wish you'd died in that automobile!

1249
01:22:48,842 --> 01:22:51,477
You'll wish you'd never mentioned
our son.

1250
01:22:51,478 --> 01:22:52,445
I warned you.

1251
01:22:52,446 --> 01:22:55,048
- I'm impressed!
- I warned you not to go too far!

1252
01:22:55,049 --> 01:22:57,279
I'm just beginning!

1253
01:22:57,852 --> 01:23:01,688
I'm numbed so I can take you
when we're alone. I don't listen.

1254
01:23:01,689 --> 01:23:07,325
And if I do listen I sift it so I don't
really hear, which is the only way.

1255
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:10,365
But you've taken a new tack
in the last century...

1256
01:23:10,366 --> 01:23:13,699
... which is just too much. Too much!

1257
01:23:15,537 --> 01:23:20,209
I don't mind your dirty underthings in
public. I do, but I'm reconciled to it.

1258
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:24,213
You've moved into your own
fantasy world! You don't know...

1259
01:23:24,214 --> 01:23:25,649
- You have!
- Nuts!

1260
01:23:25,882 --> 01:23:27,167
You can go on...

1261
01:23:27,384 --> 01:23:31,800
Have you ever listened to your
sentences? You're so convoluted.

1262
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:35,060
You talk like one of your stupid papers.

1263
01:23:35,061 --> 01:23:38,563
Actually, I'm rather worried about you.
About your mind.

1264
01:23:38,564 --> 01:23:41,400
Don't you worry
about my mind, sweetheart!

1265
01:23:41,401 --> 01:23:42,687
I'll commit you.

1266
01:23:42,903 --> 01:23:43,835
You what?

1267
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:46,613
I think I'll have you committed.

1268
01:23:50,077 --> 01:23:52,238
Baby, aren't you something?

1269
01:23:52,913 --> 01:23:55,082
I've got to find a way to get at you.

1270
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:59,253
You've got at me, you don't have to
do anything, George.

1271
01:23:59,254 --> 01:24:01,922
A thousand years of you
has been enough!

1272
01:24:01,923 --> 01:24:03,663
You'll go quietly then?

1273
01:24:04,426 --> 01:24:07,919
Do you want to know what's
really happened?

1274
01:24:08,764 --> 01:24:12,757
It snapped! Finally. Not me, it!
The whole arrangement.

1275
01:24:13,436 --> 01:24:16,938
You can go on forever and ever,
everything is manageable.

1276
01:24:16,939 --> 01:24:21,010
You make all sorts of excuses:
“To hell with it, this is life. ”

1277
01:24:21,011 --> 01:24:23,813
“Maybe tomorrow he'll be dead.
Maybe tomorrow you'll be dead. ”

1278
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:25,374
All sorts of excuses.

1279
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:27,844
Then one day...

1280
01:24:28,051 --> 01:24:30,680
... one night, something happens...

1281
01:24:31,389 --> 01:24:32,413
... and snap!

1282
01:24:32,623 --> 01:24:36,268
It breaks and you just don't
give a damn anymore!

1283
01:24:37,962 --> 01:24:40,954
I tried with you, baby. I really tried.

1284
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,960
Come off it.

1285
01:24:46,805 --> 01:24:48,780
You're a monster. You are.

1286
01:24:50,009 --> 01:24:52,109
I'm loud, and I'm vulgar...

1287
01:24:52,144 --> 01:24:56,415
... and I wear the pants in the house
because somebody's got to!

1288
01:24:56,416 --> 01:24:58,316
But I am not a monster!

1289
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:00,308
I'm not!

1290
01:25:00,653 --> 01:25:04,857
You're a spoiled, self-indulgent,
dirty-minded, liquor-riddled...

1291
01:25:04,858 --> 01:25:06,986
Snap! It went snap.

1292
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:10,978
I won't try to get through
to you any more.

1293
01:25:11,334 --> 01:25:14,503
There was a second back there,
when I could've...

1294
01:25:14,504 --> 01:25:16,339
... gotten through to you.

1295
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,215
When maybe we could've out
through all this crap!

1296
01:25:21,178 --> 01:25:24,841
But it's past.
And I'm not going to try.

1297
01:25:25,182 --> 01:25:28,537
Once a month, Martha.
I've gotten used to it.

1298
01:25:28,585 --> 01:25:33,524
We get Misunderstood Martha, the
good-hearted girl beneath the barnacles.

1299
01:25:33,525 --> 01:25:38,028
The little miss that a touch of kindness
will bring to bloom again.

1300
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:42,367
I believed it more times than I'd admit.
I'm that much of a sucker.

1301
01:25:42,368 --> 01:25:45,370
But I don't believe you,
I just don't believe you!

1302
01:25:45,371 --> 01:25:49,401
There is no moment any more
when we could come together.

1303
01:25:49,542 --> 01:25:53,628
You can't come together with nothing.
And you're nothing!

1304
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:54,702
Snap!

1305
01:25:56,383 --> 01:25:59,793
I looked at you tonight
and you weren't there!

1306
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:04,888
It finally snapped.
And I'm gonna howl it out!

1307
01:26:05,392 --> 01:26:07,227
I won't give a damn what I do.

1308
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:11,398
And I'll make the biggest goddamn
explosion you've ever heard!

1309
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:13,567
And I'll beat you at your own game.

1310
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:16,570
- Is that a threat, George?
- That's a threat, Martha.

1311
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:18,139
You're going to get it, baby!

1312
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,750
Be careful, I'll rip you to pieces.

1313
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:24,131
You are not man enough.
You haven't the guts!

1314
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:26,403
Total war?

1315
01:26:27,216 --> 01:26:28,513
Total!

1316
01:30:39,428 --> 01:30:40,258
Bells.

1317
01:30:44,768 --> 01:30:47,259
I've been hearing bells!

1318
01:30:48,772 --> 01:30:50,103
Bells ringing.

1319
01:31:00,951 --> 01:31:03,561
And I couldn't sleep for the bells.

1320
01:31:07,058 --> 01:31:08,685
That woke me up.

1321
01:31:09,127 --> 01:31:10,412
What time is it?

1322
01:31:11,062 --> 01:31:12,495
Don't bother me.

1323
01:31:16,301 --> 01:31:17,633
I was asleep.

1324
01:31:18,805 --> 01:31:21,467
And I was dreaming of something...

1325
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:23,575
... and I heard the sounds coming...

1326
01:31:23,576 --> 01:31:26,241
... and I didn't know what it was...

1327
01:31:27,346 --> 01:31:29,127
... and it frightened me.

1328
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:31,693
I'm going to get you, Martha.

1329
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,810
Somehow, Martha.

1330
01:31:35,989 --> 01:31:40,476
And there was someone there and...
I didn't want someone there.

1331
01:31:40,663 --> 01:31:42,325
I was naked.

1332
01:31:42,666 --> 01:31:45,534
You don't know what's going on, do you?

1333
01:31:45,535 --> 01:31:47,235
I don't want to know.

1334
01:31:48,338 --> 01:31:49,669
Listen to them!

1335
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,850
- I don't want to!
- Look at them!

1336
01:31:56,681 --> 01:31:58,656
I don't want any children.

1337
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:01,835
I don't want any children, please!

1338
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,013
I'm afraid. I don't want to be hurt.

1339
01:32:08,527 --> 01:32:10,188
I should have known.

1340
01:32:11,363 --> 01:32:14,468
Does that stud you married
know about that?

1341
01:32:14,867 --> 01:32:18,370
How do you make your
secret little murders? Pills?

1342
01:32:18,371 --> 01:32:21,707
You got a secret supply of pills?
Apple jelly? Willpower?

1343
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:22,808
Going to throw up?

1344
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:25,177
Where is he? I want my husband!
I want a drink!

1345
01:32:25,178 --> 01:32:27,203
That's right, go at it!

1346
01:32:28,047 --> 01:32:30,368
You know what's going on there?

1347
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:36,212
I don't want to know anything.
You leave me alone.

1348
01:32:38,225 --> 01:32:39,123
Who rang?

1349
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:41,896
What were the bells? Who rang?

1350
01:32:41,897 --> 01:32:43,898
He's up there and you ask who rang?

1351
01:32:43,899 --> 01:32:45,332
Someone rang!

1352
01:32:49,671 --> 01:32:51,036
Someone rang.

1353
01:32:54,076 --> 01:32:56,311
The bells rang and it was someone...

1354
01:32:56,312 --> 01:32:57,472
Somebody.

1355
01:32:58,915 --> 01:33:02,585
Somebody rang.
The bells rang and it was somebody...

1356
01:33:06,924 --> 01:33:07,989
I've got it!

1357
01:33:09,026 --> 01:33:10,653
I've got it, Martha!

1358
01:33:11,261 --> 01:33:13,858
It was a message. The message was...

1359
01:33:13,933 --> 01:33:17,469
... our son... it was a message...
The bells rang...

1360
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:20,272
... and it was a message.
And it was about...

1361
01:33:20,273 --> 01:33:21,706
... our son...

1362
01:33:21,942 --> 01:33:23,671
And the message was...

1363
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:27,906
... our son...

1364
01:33:28,248 --> 01:33:30,444
... is dead!

1365
01:33:30,651 --> 01:33:33,787
Our son is dead
and I haven't told Martha!

1366
01:33:33,788 --> 01:33:38,303
Our son is dead, Martha doesn't know,
and you won't tell her!

1367
01:33:39,794 --> 01:33:43,464
I'll tell her myself.
In good time I'll tell her myself.

1368
01:33:43,465 --> 01:33:45,165
I'm going to be sick.

1369
01:33:45,467 --> 01:33:46,968
Are you? That's nice.

1370
01:33:46,969 --> 01:33:50,302
- I'm going to die.
- Good, go right ahead.

1371
01:33:59,315 --> 01:34:00,930
Martha, I have some...

1372
01:34:01,517 --> 01:34:02,984
... terrible news.

1373
01:34:05,155 --> 01:34:06,747
It's about our son.

1374
01:34:08,759 --> 01:34:09,817
He's dead.

1375
01:34:12,496 --> 01:34:14,236
Do you hear me, Martha?

1376
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:17,862
Our boy is dead.

1377
01:35:10,227 --> 01:35:12,718
Where the hell is everybody?

1378
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:14,235
I'll give you bastards five to come from
wherever you're hiding!

1379
01:37:29,714 --> 01:37:32,046
By God, you've gone crazy too.

1380
01:37:34,385 --> 01:37:36,876
I said you've gone crazy too.

1381
01:37:40,558 --> 01:37:41,890
Probably.

1382
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:46,315
You've all gone crazy.

1383
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,070
I come downstairs and what happens?

1384
01:37:58,144 --> 01:37:59,611
What happens?

1385
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:08,727
My wife's in the can with
a liquor bottle and she winks at me.

1386
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:10,423
Winks at me!

1387
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:13,569
She's never winked at you?

1388
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,261
What a shame!

1389
01:38:17,268 --> 01:38:21,713
She's lying down on the floor,
on the tiles, all curled-up...

1390
01:38:22,439 --> 01:38:26,075
... and she starts peeling
the label on the brandy bottle.

1391
01:38:26,076 --> 01:38:29,252
Maybe she'd be
more comfortable in the tub.

1392
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:34,952
And I asked her what she's doing
and she goes...

1393
01:38:34,953 --> 01:38:37,493
... ”Sshh, nobody knows I'm here. ”

1394
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:42,117
And I come down here...

1395
01:38:42,461 --> 01:38:47,386
... and you're stumbling around going
“clink”, for God's sake, “clink”.

1396
01:38:50,303 --> 01:38:52,134
You've all gone crazy.

1397
01:38:54,174 --> 01:38:55,641
Sad but true.

1398
01:38:57,144 --> 01:38:58,975
Where is your husband?

1399
01:38:59,313 --> 01:39:02,146
He is vanished.

1400
01:39:08,156 --> 01:39:09,919
You're all crazy.

1401
01:39:10,692 --> 01:39:11,750
Nuts!

1402
01:39:12,493 --> 01:39:16,634
'Tis the refuge we take
when the unreality of the world...

1403
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:19,315
... sits too heavy on our tiny heads.

1404
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:25,200
Relax! Sink into it. You're no better
than anybody else.

1405
01:39:26,842 --> 01:39:28,173
I think I am.

1406
01:39:33,984 --> 01:39:37,511
You're certainly a flop
in some departments.

1407
01:39:46,866 --> 01:39:48,096
What'd you say?

1408
01:39:50,036 --> 01:39:52,872
I said you're a flop
in some departments.

1409
01:39:52,873 --> 01:39:55,068
I'm sorry you're disappointed.

1410
01:39:55,209 --> 01:39:58,878
Maybe some time
when I didn't drink for ten hours.

1411
01:39:58,879 --> 01:40:01,541
Baby, you sure are a flop!

1412
01:40:02,716 --> 01:40:06,732
You're something. You know that?
You're really something!

1413
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:10,520
To you, everybody's a flop!

1414
01:40:10,725 --> 01:40:12,559
Your husband's a flop, I'm a flop.

1415
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,894
You're all flops.

1416
01:40:13,895 --> 01:40:17,730
I am the Earth Mother
and you are all flops.

1417
01:40:22,905 --> 01:40:24,896
I disgust me.

1418
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:37,056
There's only been one man in my life
who's ever made me happy.

1419
01:40:38,088 --> 01:40:39,919
You know that? One.

1420
01:40:40,591 --> 01:40:42,826
The gym instructor or something?

1421
01:40:45,763 --> 01:40:46,695
George.

1422
01:40:49,767 --> 01:40:51,098
My husband.

1423
01:40:51,602 --> 01:40:52,763
You're kidding?

1424
01:40:53,939 --> 01:40:55,770
You must be. Him?

1425
01:40:59,278 --> 01:41:00,908
You don't believe it.

1426
01:41:00,946 --> 01:41:02,521
Why, of course I do.

1427
01:41:02,815 --> 01:41:04,883
You always deal on appearances?

1428
01:41:04,884 --> 01:41:06,114
For God's sake!

1429
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:11,283
George who is out
somewhere there in the dark.

1430
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:15,460
Who is good to me. Whom I revile.

1431
01:41:16,966 --> 01:41:22,156
Who can keep learning the games we play
as quickly as I can change them.

1432
01:41:22,305 --> 01:41:25,807
Who can make me happy
and I do not wish to be happy.

1433
01:41:25,808 --> 01:41:28,471
Yes, I do wish to be happy.

1434
01:41:30,747 --> 01:41:32,738
George and Martha.

1435
01:41:33,817 --> 01:41:35,978
Sad, sad, sad.

1436
01:41:38,489 --> 01:41:41,992
Whom I will not forgive
for having come to rest.

1437
01:41:41,993 --> 01:41:44,643
For having seen me and having said...

1438
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:47,821
... ”Yes, this will do. ”

1439
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,493
Who has made the hideous, the hurting...

1440
01:41:52,838 --> 01:41:57,332
... the insulting mistake of loving me.

1441
01:41:58,177 --> 01:42:00,262
And must be punished for it.

1442
01:42:05,852 --> 01:42:08,685
Sad, sad, sad.

1443
01:42:12,526 --> 01:42:13,515
Some day...

1444
01:42:15,695 --> 01:42:16,896
... some night...

1445
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:21,532
... some stupid liquor-ridden night
I will go too far.

1446
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:28,208
I'll either break his back or I'll
push him off for good, which I deserve.

1447
01:42:28,209 --> 01:42:31,400
I don't think he's got
a vertebrae intact.

1448
01:42:31,713 --> 01:42:34,409
Oh, you don't?

1449
01:42:34,616 --> 01:42:36,311
You don't think so?

1450
01:42:37,219 --> 01:42:38,709
Oh, little boy!

1451
01:42:39,555 --> 01:42:43,336
You've got yourself so hunched over
your microphone...

1452
01:42:43,393 --> 01:42:44,724
Microscope!

1453
01:42:45,061 --> 01:42:47,729
Yes. And you don't
see anything, do you?

1454
01:42:47,730 --> 01:42:50,600
You see everything
but the goddamn mind.

1455
01:42:50,733 --> 01:42:56,356
You see all the specks and the crap,
but you don't see what goes on, do you?

1456
01:42:56,409 --> 01:43:00,912
You know so little. And you're going
to take over the world, huh?

1457
01:43:00,913 --> 01:43:02,403
I said, all right!

1458
01:43:04,418 --> 01:43:06,409
The stallion's mad, huh?

1459
01:43:06,753 --> 01:43:10,086
The gelding's getting all upset, huh?

1460
01:43:10,424 --> 01:43:12,415
You swing wild, don't you?

1461
01:43:12,759 --> 01:43:14,484
You poor little bastard!

1462
01:43:14,761 --> 01:43:16,377
Hit out at everything!

1463
01:43:16,764 --> 01:43:18,214
Go answer the door.

1464
01:43:19,767 --> 01:43:21,268
What'd you say to me?

1465
01:43:21,269 --> 01:43:24,104
I said go answer the door.
What are you, deaf?

1466
01:43:24,105 --> 01:43:26,607
You want me to go answer the door?

1467
01:43:26,608 --> 01:43:29,611
That's right, lunkhead,
go answer the door.

1468
01:43:29,612 --> 01:43:32,380
Or are you too drunk to do that, too?

1469
01:43:32,381 --> 01:43:34,115
There's no need for you to...

1470
01:43:34,116 --> 01:43:35,549
Answer it!

1471
01:43:36,151 --> 01:43:38,119
You be houseboy around here awhile.

1472
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:40,456
You can start in
being houseboy right now.

1473
01:43:40,457 --> 01:43:42,458
Look, I'm no flunky to you.

1474
01:43:42,459 --> 01:43:45,294
Sure, you are!
You're ambitious, aren't you?

1475
01:43:45,295 --> 01:43:50,030
You didn't come back here with me
out of driven passion, did you?

1476
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:53,806
You were thinking a little bit
about your career.

1477
01:43:54,005 --> 01:43:58,465
You can just houseboy your way up
the ladder for awhile.

1478
01:44:00,311 --> 01:44:01,978
There's no limit to you, is there?

1479
01:44:01,979 --> 01:44:04,520
No, baby, none. Go answer the door.

1480
01:44:04,549 --> 01:44:06,016
Go on, git!

1481
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,810
Aimless. Wanton.

1482
01:44:10,155 --> 01:44:12,600
Now, you just do as you're told.

1483
01:44:12,658 --> 01:44:15,493
You show ol' Martha
there's something you can do.

1484
01:44:15,494 --> 01:44:17,827
I'm coming, for Christ's sake!

1485
01:44:18,164 --> 01:44:19,825
Wonderful! Marvelous!

1486
01:44:20,166 --> 01:44:22,930
Just a gigolo everywhere I go.

1487
01:44:23,169 --> 01:44:23,984
Stop that!

1488
01:44:24,504 --> 01:44:28,247
Sorry, baby. Now you go
answer the little door, huh?

1489
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:39,220
How lovely!

1490
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:45,432
Why, sonny, you came home
for your birthday at last!

1491
01:44:45,662 --> 01:44:47,129
Get away from me!

1492
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:50,531
That's the houseboy, for God's sake!

1493
01:44:50,867 --> 01:44:55,372
That's not our own little Sonny-Jim,
our own all-American something or other?

1494
01:44:55,373 --> 01:44:59,710
I certainly hope not.
He's been acting awful funny if he is.

1495
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:02,016
I'll bet. Chippie, chippie, huh?

1496
01:45:04,316 --> 01:45:06,307
I brung these flowers...

1497
01:45:08,654 --> 01:45:09,985
... 'cause youse...

1498
01:45:10,789 --> 01:45:12,518
Aw, hell, Martha!

1499
01:45:14,326 --> 01:45:18,991
Pansies, rosemary, violence,
mah wedding bouquet!

1500
01:45:19,332 --> 01:45:22,247
If you don't mind, I'll get my wife...

1501
01:45:22,535 --> 01:45:26,004
You stay right where you are.
Make my hubby a drink.

1502
01:45:26,005 --> 01:45:27,673
I don't think I will.

1503
01:45:27,674 --> 01:45:32,340
No, Martha. That would be too much.
He's your houseboy, not mine.

1504
01:45:32,346 --> 01:45:34,337
I'm nobody's houseboy!

1505
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:40,310
I'm nobody's houseboy now

1506
01:45:41,957 --> 01:45:42,651
Vicious.

1507
01:45:42,858 --> 01:45:44,348
Children? That right?

1508
01:45:44,693 --> 01:45:49,196
Vicious children with their sad games
hopscotching their way through life?

1509
01:45:49,197 --> 01:45:50,632
Something like that.

1510
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:51,624
Screw, baby.

1511
01:45:51,867 --> 01:45:54,860
Him can't! Him too full o' booze!

1512
01:45:55,204 --> 01:45:58,537
Really? Here! Dump these in some gin.

1513
01:46:01,244 --> 01:46:03,982
A terrible thing to do
to Martha's snapdragons!

1514
01:46:03,983 --> 01:46:05,668
Is that what they are?

1515
01:46:05,885 --> 01:46:10,388
Yup. And I went by moonlight to Daddy's
greenhouse to pick them for her.

1516
01:46:10,389 --> 01:46:13,558
There is no moon.
I saw it go down from the bedroom.

1517
01:46:13,559 --> 01:46:14,829
From the bedroom?

1518
01:46:16,897 --> 01:46:18,182
There is a moon.

1519
01:46:18,398 --> 01:46:21,233
There is no goddamn moon,
the moon went down.

1520
01:46:21,234 --> 01:46:23,102
That may be, Chastity,
but it came back up.

1521
01:46:23,103 --> 01:46:23,694
Bull!

1522
01:46:23,904 --> 01:46:27,339
Once when I was sailing past Majorca,
the moon went down...

1523
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,744
... thought about it awhile then,
pop, came up again.

1524
01:46:30,745 --> 01:46:33,578
That is not true. That is such a lie!

1525
01:46:33,915 --> 01:46:36,750
You must not call everything a lie.
Must she?

1526
01:46:36,751 --> 01:46:39,419
I don't know when you people are lying.

1527
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:42,761
- You're damn right!
- You're not supposed to.

1528
01:46:43,525 --> 01:46:47,929
- So, I was sailing past Majorca...
- You never sailed past Majorca.

1529
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:51,435
You were never in
the Mediterranean at all, ever!

1530
01:46:51,767 --> 01:46:55,437
My mom and dad took me
as a college graduation present.

1531
01:46:55,438 --> 01:46:57,053
After you killed them?

1532
01:46:58,174 --> 01:46:59,300
Maybe.

1533
01:47:00,777 --> 01:47:03,109
Yeah. And maybe not too.

1534
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:04,713
Jesus!

1535
01:47:05,282 --> 01:47:09,285
Truth and illusion. Who knows
the difference, toots? Houseboy?

1536
01:47:09,286 --> 01:47:10,453
I'm not a houseboy.

1537
01:47:10,454 --> 01:47:14,169
You don't make it in the sack,
you're a houseboy.

1538
01:47:14,625 --> 01:47:17,001
Then you must have made it, yes?

1539
01:47:17,128 --> 01:47:21,943
Somebody's lying, not playing the
game straight. Who's lying? Martha?

1540
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:24,455
Tell him I'm not a houseboy.

1541
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:27,635
You're not a houseboy.

1542
01:47:31,811 --> 01:47:32,800
So be it.

1543
01:47:34,814 --> 01:47:38,374
Truth and illusion.
You don't know the difference.

1544
01:47:38,651 --> 01:47:41,844
No, but we must carry on
as though we did.

1545
01:47:42,324 --> 01:47:43,484
Amen.

1546
01:47:45,327 --> 01:47:46,728
Snap went the dragons.

1547
01:47:46,729 --> 01:47:47,559
Thank you.

1548
01:47:48,464 --> 01:47:49,362
Skip it.

1549
01:47:49,665 --> 01:47:51,099
I said snap went the dragons!

1550
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,534
Yeah, we know.

1551
01:47:53,503 --> 01:47:54,492
Don't!

1552
01:47:54,838 --> 01:47:56,013
Don't do that.

1553
01:47:56,339 --> 01:47:57,444
Shut up, stud!

1554
01:47:57,507 --> 01:47:58,807
I'm not a stud.

1555
01:47:58,842 --> 01:48:01,507
Then you're a houseboy. Which is it?

1556
01:48:01,678 --> 01:48:03,363
Does it matter to you?

1557
01:48:04,181 --> 01:48:07,771
No, actually it doesn't.
Either way I've had it.

1558
01:48:08,019 --> 01:48:10,724
Stop throwing these damn things at me!

1559
01:48:11,022 --> 01:48:13,523
- Either way. Snap!
- Shall I do something to him?

1560
01:48:13,524 --> 01:48:15,029
You leave him alone!

1561
01:48:15,192 --> 01:48:17,898
Which are you, baby, houseboy or stud?

1562
01:48:20,032 --> 01:48:24,297
Truth or illusion, George?
Doesn't it matter to you at all?

1563
01:48:26,538 --> 01:48:29,201
Snap! You got your answer, baby.

1564
01:48:34,547 --> 01:48:35,377
Got it.

1565
01:48:39,887 --> 01:48:42,722
You just gird your
blue-veined loins, girl.

1566
01:48:42,723 --> 01:48:47,060
There's one more game to play.
It's called Bringing up Baby.

1567
01:48:47,061 --> 01:48:50,396
I don't want a fuss. Don't want
any scandal around here, do you?

1568
01:48:50,397 --> 01:48:52,900
Want to keep to your timetable?
Then sit!

1569
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:57,905
And you, pretty miss, you like fun and
games! You're a sport from way back!

1570
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:58,895
All right.

1571
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,450
Good. But we're not all here.

1572
01:49:04,246 --> 01:49:06,081
Your little wifelet isn't here.

1573
01:49:06,082 --> 01:49:07,749
She had a rough night...

1574
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:11,890
We can't play without everybody.
We need your little wife.

1575
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:14,912
Cut that!

1576
01:49:15,926 --> 01:49:19,597
Just get off your butt and bring
that little dip back in here!

1577
01:49:19,598 --> 01:49:23,173
Now be a good puppy, go fetch.
Fetch, good puppy.

1578
01:49:32,879 --> 01:49:34,039
One more game.

1579
01:49:42,556 --> 01:49:44,891
I don't like what's going to happen.

1580
01:49:44,892 --> 01:49:46,702
Do you know what it is?

1581
01:49:47,061 --> 01:49:49,552
No. But I don't like it.

1582
01:49:49,897 --> 01:49:51,567
Maybe you will, Martha.

1583
01:49:52,901 --> 01:49:54,732
It's a real fun game.

1584
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:56,401
No more games.

1585
01:49:56,738 --> 01:50:00,572
One more, Martha. One more game
and then beddie-bye.

1586
01:50:00,909 --> 01:50:05,395
Everybody packs up his tools
and baggage and stuff and go home.

1587
01:50:05,581 --> 01:50:07,276
And you and me...

1588
01:50:07,817 --> 01:50:10,585
... we're going to climb
them well-worn stairs.

1589
01:50:10,586 --> 01:50:12,247
No, George, no.

1590
01:50:12,588 --> 01:50:13,919
Yes, baby.

1591
01:50:15,258 --> 01:50:18,049
It'll all be done before you know it.

1592
01:50:18,262 --> 01:50:20,332
No climb stairs with Georgie?

1593
01:50:20,597 --> 01:50:25,167
No more games. It's games I don't want.
No more games, please.

1594
01:50:25,269 --> 01:50:29,104
Sure you do. Original game girl!
Of course you do.

1595
01:50:32,277 --> 01:50:34,108
Don't you touch me!

1596
01:50:34,879 --> 01:50:37,969
Keep your paws clean
for the undergraduates.

1597
01:50:38,683 --> 01:50:39,734
Listen to me!

1598
01:50:39,919 --> 01:50:41,453
You've had an evening.

1599
01:50:41,454 --> 01:50:46,257
You can't stop when there's enough
blood in your mouth. We're going on.

1600
01:50:46,258 --> 01:50:50,295
I'm having at you, and your performance
will look like an Easter pageant.

1601
01:50:50,296 --> 01:50:51,677
Get yourself alert.

1602
01:50:51,832 --> 01:50:53,534
- Get some life in you.
- Stop!

1603
01:50:53,535 --> 01:50:55,135
Pull yourself together!

1604
01:50:55,137 --> 01:50:59,273
I'm going to knock you around
and I want you up for it!

1605
01:50:59,274 --> 01:51:00,614
What do you want?

1606
01:51:00,642 --> 01:51:02,677
- An equal battle.
- You'll get it.

1607
01:51:02,678 --> 01:51:05,881
- I want you mad.
- I'm mad. Don't worry about it!

1608
01:51:05,882 --> 01:51:08,183
Good girl!
We'll play to the death.

1609
01:51:08,184 --> 01:51:10,319
- Yours?
- You'll be surprised.

1610
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,987
Here come the tots. Be ready.

1611
01:51:11,988 --> 01:51:13,453
I'm ready for you.

1612
01:51:13,456 --> 01:51:15,789
Hip, hop. Hip, hip, hop.

1613
01:51:15,993 --> 01:51:18,154
Are you a bunny, honey!

1614
01:51:18,496 --> 01:51:20,911
- How's the bunny?
- Bunny funny!

1615
01:51:21,165 --> 01:51:23,166
Bunny funny. Good for bunny.

1616
01:51:23,167 --> 01:51:24,492
Honey funny bunny.

1617
01:51:26,504 --> 01:51:28,139
All right, here we go.

1618
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:29,835
Last game. All sit.

1619
01:51:31,009 --> 01:51:35,329
- Sit down. This is a civilized game.
- Just get on with it.

1620
01:51:35,347 --> 01:51:39,684
I think we've been having a real good
evening, all things considered.

1621
01:51:39,685 --> 01:51:43,355
We've got to know each other.
And we've had fun and games.

1622
01:51:43,356 --> 01:51:44,890
Like Curl Up On The Floor.

1623
01:51:44,891 --> 01:51:45,706
The Tiles.

1624
01:51:45,858 --> 01:51:47,692
The Tiles, Snap The Dragon.

1625
01:51:47,693 --> 01:51:48,853
Peel the Label!

1626
01:51:49,695 --> 01:51:51,687
Label. Peel the Label.

1627
01:51:52,032 --> 01:51:53,522
I peel labels.

1628
01:51:53,734 --> 01:51:55,749
We all peel labels, sweetie.

1629
01:51:56,036 --> 01:51:59,372
When you get through the skin,
and through the muscle...

1630
01:51:59,373 --> 01:52:04,439
... and slosh aside the organs, down to
the bone, you know what you do?

1631
01:52:04,712 --> 01:52:06,713
When you get down to the bone...

1632
01:52:06,714 --> 01:52:09,550
... you aren't all the way.
Something's inside the bone.

1633
01:52:09,551 --> 01:52:12,219
The marrow.
That's what you got to get at.

1634
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:15,723
But bones are pretty resilient,
especially in the young.

1635
01:52:15,724 --> 01:52:17,174
Now take our son...

1636
01:52:19,562 --> 01:52:22,227
Our son. Martha's and my little joy.

1637
01:52:23,666 --> 01:52:25,233
Just what are you doing?

1638
01:52:25,234 --> 01:52:28,070
- I'm talking about our son.
- Well, don't.

1639
01:52:28,071 --> 01:52:30,575
I want to.
It's important we talk about him.

1640
01:52:30,576 --> 01:52:34,221
You want to hear about our
bouncy boy, don't you?

1641
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:37,071
Martha's and my son.

1642
01:52:39,586 --> 01:52:40,926
You have a child?

1643
01:52:41,254 --> 01:52:43,415
Yes indeed, do we ever!

1644
01:52:43,756 --> 01:52:45,457
Will you talk about him or shall I?

1645
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:48,288
- Don't.
- All rightie, now let's see.

1646
01:52:48,328 --> 01:52:50,429
He's nice, despite home his life.

1647
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:54,601
Most kids would be neurotic,
Martha carrying on the way she does.

1648
01:52:54,602 --> 01:52:58,104
Sleeping till 4 p. m.
Climbing over the poor bastard...

1649
01:52:58,105 --> 01:53:03,109
... trying to break the bathroom door
to wash him in the tub when he's 16.

1650
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:06,091
Dragging strangers
to the house all hours.

1651
01:53:07,115 --> 01:53:08,275
That's enough.

1652
01:53:08,617 --> 01:53:10,184
Do you want to take over?

1653
01:53:10,185 --> 01:53:13,120
Why would anyone want to
wash a 16 year-old?

1654
01:53:13,121 --> 01:53:14,516
For Christ's sake!

1655
01:53:14,789 --> 01:53:15,882
Well, why?

1656
01:53:16,092 --> 01:53:17,959
Because it's her baby-poo.

1657
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,120
All right.

1658
01:53:19,462 --> 01:53:22,652
Our son, you want our son?
You'll have it.

1659
01:53:25,301 --> 01:53:26,876
Do you want a drink?

1660
01:53:30,474 --> 01:53:33,309
We don't have to hear it
if you don't want to.

1661
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:36,665
Who says? You in a position
to set the rules?

1662
01:53:38,148 --> 01:53:40,014
Good boy. You'll go far.

1663
01:53:40,485 --> 01:53:42,830
All right, your recitation please.

1664
01:53:48,459 --> 01:53:49,551
Our son...

1665
01:53:49,827 --> 01:53:50,759
All right!

1666
01:53:51,830 --> 01:53:52,990
Our son.

1667
01:53:55,501 --> 01:54:00,331
Our son was born in a September night,
a night not unlike tonight...

1668
01:54:01,507 --> 01:54:02,982
... though tomorrow...

1669
01:54:03,610 --> 01:54:05,445
... and sixteen years ago.

1670
01:54:05,578 --> 01:54:06,945
See, I told you.

1671
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:12,186
- It was an easy birth.
- No, you labored, how you labored!

1672
01:54:12,187 --> 01:54:13,817
It was an easy birth!

1673
01:54:14,523 --> 01:54:16,287
Once it had been...

1674
01:54:16,492 --> 01:54:17,857
... accepted.

1675
01:54:18,695 --> 01:54:21,493
- Relaxed into.
- That's better.

1676
01:54:22,532 --> 01:54:26,052
It was an easy birth,
once it had been accepted.

1677
01:54:27,371 --> 01:54:29,032
And I was young.

1678
01:54:29,373 --> 01:54:31,136
And he was healthy...

1679
01:54:32,209 --> 01:54:34,541
... a red, bawling child.

1680
01:54:35,045 --> 01:54:37,750
Martha thinks she saw him at delivery.

1681
01:54:37,881 --> 01:54:40,043
With slippery, firm limbs.

1682
01:54:41,219 --> 01:54:45,053
And a full head of black, fine hair.

1683
01:54:46,224 --> 01:54:47,555
Which, later...

1684
01:54:48,226 --> 01:54:49,536
... later became...

1685
01:54:51,464 --> 01:54:53,024
... blond as the sun.

1686
01:54:54,567 --> 01:54:55,898
Our son.

1687
01:54:56,235 --> 01:54:57,975
He was a healthy child.

1688
01:54:59,071 --> 01:55:02,905
And I had wanted a child.
Oh, I had wanted a child!

1689
01:55:03,242 --> 01:55:04,904
A son? Daughter?

1690
01:55:05,245 --> 01:55:06,234
A child!

1691
01:55:11,251 --> 01:55:12,912
I had my child.

1692
01:55:13,253 --> 01:55:14,413
Our child.

1693
01:55:17,425 --> 01:55:18,858
And we raised him.

1694
01:55:21,763 --> 01:55:23,793
Yes, we did. We raised him.

1695
01:55:27,101 --> 01:55:30,265
And he had green eyes.

1696
01:55:32,274 --> 01:55:35,937
Such green, green eyes.

1697
01:55:37,112 --> 01:55:38,943
Blue, green, brown.

1698
01:55:39,949 --> 01:55:41,644
And he loved the sun.

1699
01:55:41,951 --> 01:55:45,389
And he was tan
before and after everyone.

1700
01:55:47,459 --> 01:55:49,051
And in the sun...

1701
01:55:49,961 --> 01:55:51,507
... his hair became...

1702
01:55:52,498 --> 01:55:53,590
... fleece.

1703
01:55:57,637 --> 01:56:00,629
Beautiful, beautiful boy.

1704
01:56:05,979 --> 01:56:08,812
So beautiful, so wise.

1705
01:56:09,316 --> 01:56:11,096
All truth being relative.

1706
01:56:11,819 --> 01:56:13,150
It was true.

1707
01:56:14,822 --> 01:56:17,155
Beautiful, wise, perfect!

1708
01:56:17,358 --> 01:56:19,293
There's a real mother talking.

1709
01:56:19,294 --> 01:56:21,159
I want a child!

1710
01:56:22,831 --> 01:56:23,820
On principle?

1711
01:56:24,165 --> 01:56:26,656
I want a child. I want a baby.

1712
01:56:27,169 --> 01:56:29,349
This perfection could not last.

1713
01:56:30,339 --> 01:56:31,897
Not with George.

1714
01:56:33,109 --> 01:56:34,642
Not with George around.

1715
01:56:34,643 --> 01:56:36,311
There, you see, I knew she'd shift.

1716
01:56:36,312 --> 01:56:38,179
- Be still!
- Sorry, Mother.

1717
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:39,701
Can't you be still?

1718
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:45,345
Not with George. A drowning man takes
down those nearest, and he tried.

1719
01:56:45,522 --> 01:56:48,858
And, God, how I fought him!
How I fought him!

1720
01:56:48,859 --> 01:56:50,190
The one thing...

1721
01:56:50,527 --> 01:56:53,673
... I tried to carry unscathed
through the...

1722
01:56:54,031 --> 01:56:55,866
... sewer of our marriage...

1723
01:56:55,867 --> 01:56:59,870
... through the sick nights and the
pathetic, stupid days...

1724
01:56:59,871 --> 01:57:04,037
... through the derision and the
laughter. God, the laughter!

1725
01:57:04,543 --> 01:57:07,137
Through one failure after another.

1726
01:57:07,546 --> 01:57:11,836
Each attempt more numbing,
more sickening than the one before.

1727
01:57:12,217 --> 01:57:15,903
The one thing, the one person
I tried to protect...

1728
01:57:16,222 --> 01:57:20,718
... to raise above the mire of this vile,
crushing marriage...

1729
01:57:21,563 --> 01:57:25,578
... the one light in all this
hopeless darkness! Our son!

1730
01:57:25,767 --> 01:57:26,472
Stop it!

1731
01:57:31,207 --> 01:57:33,017
Why, don't you like it?

1732
01:57:33,075 --> 01:57:34,540
You can't do this.

1733
01:57:34,644 --> 01:57:35,404
Who says?

1734
01:57:35,444 --> 01:57:37,742
- I say!
- Tell us why, baby.

1735
01:57:38,748 --> 01:57:40,239
Is this game over?

1736
01:57:42,753 --> 01:57:44,853
Oh, no! Not by a long shot.

1737
01:57:45,756 --> 01:57:49,526
I've got a surprise for you.
It's about sonny-Jim.

1738
01:57:50,594 --> 01:57:52,280
I'm running this show!

1739
01:57:53,097 --> 01:57:54,086
Sweetheart...

1740
01:57:54,832 --> 01:57:57,768
... I’m afraid I've got
some bad news for you.

1741
01:57:57,769 --> 01:58:01,038
For both of us, I mean.
Some rather sad news.

1742
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:02,563
What is this?

1743
01:58:02,774 --> 01:58:07,111
Martha, while you were busy,
while the two of you were busy...

1744
01:58:07,112 --> 01:58:09,614
... I don't know where,
but you were somewhere...

1745
01:58:09,615 --> 01:58:12,195
... while you were busy for awhile...

1746
01:58:12,284 --> 01:58:15,187
... Missy and I
were having a little talk.

1747
01:58:15,188 --> 01:58:17,343
You know, a chaw and a talk.

1748
01:58:17,457 --> 01:58:19,220
And the doorbell rang.

1749
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:20,450
Chimed.

1750
01:58:26,967 --> 01:58:29,248
It's hard for me to tell you.

1751
01:58:29,937 --> 01:58:31,234
Please don't!

1752
01:58:31,472 --> 01:58:32,461
Tell me!

1753
01:58:33,474 --> 01:58:37,779
It was good old Western Union,
some little boy about seventy.

1754
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:39,412
Crazy Billy?

1755
01:58:39,815 --> 01:58:41,720
That's right. Crazy Billy.

1756
01:58:41,984 --> 01:58:45,009
And he had a telegram and it was for us.

1757
01:58:46,488 --> 01:58:48,643
I have to tell you about it.

1758
01:58:49,157 --> 01:58:53,492
Why did they bring it?
Why didn't they telephone it?

1759
01:58:53,997 --> 01:58:59,269
There are some telegrams you have to
deliver, Martha. Some you cannot phone.

1760
01:58:59,971 --> 01:59:01,311
What do you mean?

1761
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:06,645
I can hardly bring myself to say it.

1762
01:59:06,646 --> 01:59:08,111
You want to do it?

1763
01:59:13,519 --> 01:59:18,420
Well, Martha, I'm afraid our boy
isn't coming home for his birthday.

1764
01:59:18,859 --> 01:59:20,349
Of course he is!

1765
01:59:21,194 --> 01:59:23,195
Of course he is! I say he is!

1766
01:59:23,196 --> 01:59:24,026
He can't.

1767
01:59:28,403 --> 01:59:29,631
Our son...

1768
01:59:30,705 --> 01:59:31,694
... is...

1769
01:59:33,274 --> 01:59:33,968
... dead.

1770
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:38,415
He was killed late in the afternoon...

1771
01:59:39,048 --> 01:59:41,516
... on a country road with his
learner's permit.

1772
01:59:41,517 --> 01:59:44,385
He swerved to avoid a porcupine
and drove...

1773
01:59:44,386 --> 01:59:45,851
You can't do that!

1774
01:59:46,555 --> 01:59:48,170
... into a large tree.

1775
01:59:49,024 --> 01:59:50,514
You cannot do that!

1776
01:59:52,195 --> 01:59:54,100
I thought you should know.

1777
01:59:55,465 --> 01:59:57,194
You cannot do that!

1778
01:59:57,534 --> 02:00:00,639
You can't decide these things
for yourself!

1779
02:00:01,037 --> 02:00:03,138
I will not let you do that!

1780
02:00:03,207 --> 02:00:05,208
Have to leave around noon, I suppose.

1781
02:00:05,209 --> 02:00:07,444
I won't let you decide these things.

1782
02:00:07,445 --> 02:00:11,047
There are matters of identification,
arrangements to be made.

1783
02:00:11,048 --> 02:00:13,798
You can't do this! I won't let you!

1784
02:00:13,884 --> 02:00:17,054
- Get your hands off me!
- I haven't done anything!

1785
02:00:17,055 --> 02:00:19,557
Now you listen to me. Our son is dead!

1786
02:00:19,558 --> 02:00:22,098
Can you get that through your head?

1787
02:00:22,227 --> 02:00:26,898
Listen carefully. We got a telegram.
There was a car accident and he's dead!

1788
02:00:26,899 --> 02:00:30,254
Poof! Just like that!
Now how do you like it?

1789
02:00:33,742 --> 02:00:36,242
Let her go.
She'll be all right.

1790
02:00:46,922 --> 02:00:49,288
He is not dead.

1791
02:00:51,762 --> 02:00:52,751
He is dead.

1792
02:00:58,101 --> 02:01:00,433
You cannot decide.

1793
02:01:01,438 --> 02:01:03,273
He hasn't decided anything.

1794
02:01:03,274 --> 02:01:06,754
It's not his doing.
He doesn't have the power.

1795
02:01:06,778 --> 02:01:11,888
That's right. I'm no god. I have
no power over life and death, do I?

1796
02:01:12,984 --> 02:01:15,112
You can't kill him.

1797
02:01:15,521 --> 02:01:18,012
You can't let him die!

1798
02:01:22,928 --> 02:01:24,488
There was a telegram.

1799
02:01:28,001 --> 02:01:31,300
Show it to me! Show me that telegram!

1800
02:01:36,309 --> 02:01:37,298
I ate it.

1801
02:01:38,645 --> 02:01:40,807
What did you just say to me?

1802
02:01:41,849 --> 02:01:44,477
I ate it.

1803
02:01:47,822 --> 02:01:49,382
Good for you, Martha.

1804
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:52,760
You make a joke at a time like this?

1805
02:01:52,961 --> 02:01:54,495
Did I not eat the telegram?

1806
02:01:54,496 --> 02:01:57,665
You ate it. I watched you
and you ate it all down.

1807
02:01:57,666 --> 02:01:58,951
Like a good boy.

1808
02:02:00,268 --> 02:02:02,478
You won't get away with this.

1809
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:06,950
You know the rules, for God's sake!

1810
02:02:08,010 --> 02:02:09,847
What are you talking about?

1811
02:02:09,848 --> 02:02:11,515
I can kill him if I want to.

1812
02:02:11,516 --> 02:02:12,783
He is our child.

1813
02:02:12,784 --> 02:02:16,287
- You bore him. A good delivery.
- He is our child.

1814
02:02:16,288 --> 02:02:17,863
And I've killed him.

1815
02:02:19,892 --> 02:02:22,612
Oh my God, I think I understand this.

1816
02:02:22,862 --> 02:02:23,794
Do you?

1817
02:02:24,563 --> 02:02:28,539
- Oh my God, I think I understand this.
- Good for you.

1818
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:35,836
You've no right.
You've no right at all.

1819
02:02:36,042 --> 02:02:40,747
I have the right, we never spoke of it.
I could kill him any time I wanted.

1820
02:02:40,748 --> 02:02:42,409
Why?

1821
02:02:42,717 --> 02:02:44,184
You broke our rule, Martha.

1822
02:02:44,185 --> 02:02:47,746
You mentioned him to somebody else.

1823
02:02:48,055 --> 02:02:50,195
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

1824
02:02:53,428 --> 02:02:55,748
To me, you mentioned him to me.

1825
02:02:58,567 --> 02:02:59,727
I forget.

1826
02:03:01,069 --> 02:03:05,085
Sometimes when it's late night
and everybody's talking...

1827
02:03:05,408 --> 02:03:07,743
... I forget and I want to mention him.

1828
02:03:07,744 --> 02:03:10,406
But I hold on. I hold on.

1829
02:03:11,781 --> 02:03:14,409
I've wanted to so often.

1830
02:03:15,419 --> 02:03:17,614
But, George, you've pushed it.

1831
02:03:17,755 --> 02:03:21,165
There was no need,
there was no need for this!

1832
02:03:22,593 --> 02:03:24,553
I mentioned him, all right?

1833
02:03:25,763 --> 02:03:29,099
But you didn't have
to push it over the edge.

1834
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:31,255
You didn't have to kill him.

1835
02:03:39,111 --> 02:03:42,603
You didn't have to have him die.

1836
02:03:48,323 --> 02:03:50,952
That wasn't needed.

1837
02:04:20,658 --> 02:04:22,182
It's dawn.

1838
02:04:23,761 --> 02:04:25,681
I think the party's over.

1839
02:04:31,503 --> 02:04:33,188
You couldn't have any?

1840
02:04:35,874 --> 02:04:37,102
We couldn't.

1841
02:04:42,015 --> 02:04:45,645
Home to bed, children.
It's way past your bedtime.

1842
02:04:55,796 --> 02:04:57,263
You two go now.

1843
02:05:11,546 --> 02:05:13,671
- I'd like to...
- Goodnight.

1844
02:05:40,547 --> 02:05:41,912
You want anything?

1845
02:05:43,249 --> 02:05:44,739
No. Nothing.

1846
02:05:50,558 --> 02:05:51,889
Time for bed.

1847
02:05:58,599 --> 02:05:59,657
Tired?

1848
02:06:00,034 --> 02:06:01,058
Yes.

1849
02:06:02,369 --> 02:06:03,359
I am.

1850
02:06:12,748 --> 02:06:14,272
Sunday tomorrow.

1851
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:17,913
All day.

1852
02:06:55,561 --> 02:06:57,588
Did you have to?

1853
02:06:59,634 --> 02:07:00,658
Yes.

1854
02:07:05,507 --> 02:07:06,872
You had to?

1855
02:07:13,515 --> 02:07:14,636
I don't know.

1856
02:07:18,188 --> 02:07:20,383
- It was time.
- Was it?

1857
02:07:31,702 --> 02:07:33,135
I'm cold.

1858
02:07:35,706 --> 02:07:36,764
It will be better.

1859
02:07:49,321 --> 02:07:50,789
It will be better.

1860
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:55,593
I don't know.

1861
02:07:56,729 --> 02:07:58,458
It will be. Maybe.

1862
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:02,732
I'm not sure.

1863
02:08:11,578 --> 02:08:12,772
Just us?

1864
02:08:17,252 --> 02:08:19,722
- You don't suppose maybe...
- No.

1865
02:08:33,002 --> 02:08:34,729
- You all right?
- Yes.

1866
02:08:40,512 --> 02:08:41,479
No.

1867
02:08:46,618 --> 02:08:50,076
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

1868
02:08:52,425 --> 02:08:53,756
I am, George.

1869
02:08:57,463 --> 02:08:58,760
I am, George.

1870
02:09:00,767 --> 02:09:01,859
I am.
