1
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,170
Don't let him touch you!

2
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,875
<i>Butt Pie.</i>

3
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,348
There's a sequel to a book written
called <i>Butt Cake.</i>

4
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:01,317
Very popular at the news-stands.
About a butt with cake all over it.

5
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,687
<i>Chunky Asses?</i>

6
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,687
<i>Welcome to the Mel Backman Journal.</i>
<i>I'm Mel Backman.</i>

7
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,764
<i>With me today is Chandler Jarrell</i>

8
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:24,130
<i>who's doing something</i>
<i>very vital for the community.</i>

9
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,171
<i>Chandler is a finder of lost children.</i>
<i>Am I correct?</i>

10
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,641
- <i>Yes, I find missing children.</i>
- <i>That's very interesting.</i>

11
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:37,647
<i>There was a show called Finder</i>
<i>of Lost Loves. Did you see that?</i>

12
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,479
- <i>Tony Franciosa was the star.</i>
- <i>Yeah...</i>

13
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,520
- <i>I'm looking for this girl...</i>
- <i>I hope you're not nervous.</i>

14
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:48,717
<i>It's perfectly normal. This is</i>
<i>my fifth show and I'm still nervous.</i>

15
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,457
<i>In fact, is there anyone here</i>
<i>who's not nervous? Are you nervous?</i>

16
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:57,501
<i>I'm trying to find this girl, Cheryl Mosely,</i>
<i>who disappeared a while back...</i>

17
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,733
<i>This is wonderful. It's what</i>
<i>the programme is all about.</i>

18
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:08,745
<i>When I came here, I told them I didn't</i>
<i>want to be another Merv or Johnny.</i>

19
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:14,251
<i>I want to do the kind of programming</i>
<i>that's responsive to the community.</i>

20
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,652
<i>I'm trying to find Cheryl Mosely.</i>
<i>She's four foot, eleven...</i>

21
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,292
<i>This is wonderful.</i>

22
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:28,465
<i>If I want to get into your line of work,</i>
<i>is there a course I can take?</i>

23
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,468
- <i>Youjust have to care about children.</i>
- <i>Do you recommend this line of work?</i>

24
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:37,507
- <i>Can you make a lot of money?</i>
- <i>She's 16...</i>

25
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:41,204
<i>This is off the subject,</i>
<i>but that's a wonderful hat.</i>

26
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,610
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

27
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:48,846
- <i>She's 16 and I'm trying to find her...</i>
- <i>Great, let's say you do find her.</i>

28
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,980
<i>What would be the first thing</i>
<i>you'd say to her?</i>

29
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:59,464
- <i>Her name is Cheryl Mosely...</i>
- <i>Thank you, Chandler.</i>

30
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,829
<i>Let's talk about tortoises.</i>
<i>What have you got here?</i>

31
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,903
- <i>This is Teddy who is 80 years old.</i>
- <i>80?</i>

32
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,472
- <i>Isn't he darling?</i>
- <i>Teddy can kiss my ass.</i>

33
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,610
<i>I'm trying to find this girl,</i>
<i>Cheryl Mosely.</i>

34
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,405
<i>She was last seen</i>
<i>on Vineland in North Hollywood.</i>

35
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,745
<i>She had on a sweater and a skirt.</i>
<i>Call me on 4688492 if you have...</i>

36
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,788
<i>Shut up. If you have any information</i>
<i>about her, please contact me.</i>

37
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,586
<i>If you don't put the camera back,</i>
<i>I'll bust your ass. Leave it on me.</i>

38
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,720
<i>Cheryl Mosely, Chandler Jarrell,</i>
<i>24 hours a day, 4688492.</i>

39
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:37,164
<i>Now you can talk with the tortoises.</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

40
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,804
<i>Thank you. That was Chandler Jarrell.</i>

41
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,837
<i>You've had a sex change?</i>

42
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,081
OK, let's go. Take it slow, now.
Tie him, tie him.

43
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,249
Why are you hanging
in the back of the court?

44
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,693
Let's go. There you go.
All the way, boys. It's you!

45
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,026
Yes!

46
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,266
All right, come on, now.

47
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,738
What's wrong with you, Scrub?

48
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,437
Scrub.

49
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,382
- Good afternoon, Mr Jarrell.
- Hi.

50
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:30,454
- So you're the finder of lost children.
- You must have seen me on TV.

51
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:35,390
- Yeah, I like working with children.
- Hey, Chandler, come on!

52
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,324
Shut up!

53
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,993
- A child has been kidnapped.
- When?

54
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,001
Five days ago in north-eastern Tibet.

55
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,537
Tibet's a little bit
out of my territory.

56
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,198
This child is special.

57
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,903
- His destiny is to save the world.
- That's a good destiny.

58
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,708
Chandler, throw the ball!

59
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,372
Here!

60
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,612
400 years ago, the Neuchung Oracle
predicted that the <i>Gompen Tarma,</i>

61
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,949
that is Tibetan for "Golden Child",

62
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,287
would be taken to the new city,
the City of the Angels.

63
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,929
He would be rescued by
a man who is no angel.

64
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,122
- Who is that?
- You.

65
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,294
Yeah, right. OK.

66
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,668
I'm in the middle of a basketball game,
although I'd love to stay and chat.

67
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:27,001
- This looks like a big joint.
- I'm serious, Mr Jarrell.

68
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,647
Lick it and smoke it.

69
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,318
I think there were two of these,
and you smoked the other one.

70
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,714
Put it in your bag
and stop smoking scrolls.

71
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,953
It looks like a joint. You might get
jumped by Rastafarians, so put it away.

72
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,825
Excuse me, I have a game to play.
It was a nice thought.

73
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,626
I realise it's hard for you to take in,

74
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,894
but it's your destiny
to find the Golden Child.

75
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,130
And it's your destiny
to seek psychiatric help.

76
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,833
Really. Can I go and play now?
Please, go home?

77
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,411
Excuse me.
And such a cute girl, too.

78
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,411
Dope fiend!

79
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:12,318
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's Cheryl Mosely.

80
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,450
- How long has she been missing?
- About three weeks.

81
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,825
- What have you got?
- Not much.

82
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,596
Three days ago, the rental sign goes
down and a truck backs up to the door.

83
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,831
The neighbours hear a continuous,
low murmur night and day.

84
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:33,138
At ten last night, the truck pulls up again
and the murmuring stops.

85
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,749
A neighbour comes out to shut up
his dog who won't come down the hill.

86
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,977
He looks over the fence
and finds the body.

87
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:53,921
- Who rented the place?
- She did. By phone, mailed in cash.

88
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,135
- Did you take the referral I sent you?
- No.

89
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,901
- You only take the kid cases.
- Yeah.

90
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,045
Get a few more shots in here.

91
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:49,377
Ms Tibet, you can come out now.
Stop following me, I won't take your case.

92
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,073
You're already on it.

93
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,982
What makes you think
the kid was in the house?

94
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,620
This is a restraint curse. They must
restrain him spiritually and physically.

95
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,594
They need to keep evil on him
on all four sides of him at all times.

96
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,598
Just the writing isn't enough.
They'd need something else.

97
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,862
- Or what?
- Or the child projects himself astrally.

98
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,977
Give me a break.

99
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,444
You're telling me
that the people that killed Cheryl...

100
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,489
If I find them, they're the same people
that kidnapped the...

101
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,627
...the Golden Child. Exactly.

102
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,284
Right.

103
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,988
- But why would they kill Cheryl?
- I don't know.

104
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,896
- Why are they feeding the kid blood?
- Are you sure?

105
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,596
- I found a bowl of oatmeal...
- Yes?

106
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,573
...with some blood on the bottom of it.
It's probably hers.

107
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:57,208
I don't know. There is somebody
we could ask about the blood.

108
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,409
This is LA, though. You're going to
ask somebody about the blood?

109
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,249
Are they in this world
or do we have to project there?

110
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,524
Some part of the galaxy...

111
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,670
Mr Jarrell, you honour my shop
with your presence.

112
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,244
He's very pleased
to meet a man as great as you.

113
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,386
How do you say "Thank you"?

114
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,096
We must speak to Kala.

115
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
OK... Hey!

116
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,854
Mr Jarrell.

117
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,003
You may speak with her.
She can hear you.

118
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,303
Tell me about the Golden Child.

119
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,812
Every thousand generations,
a perfect child is born.

120
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,511
A Golden Child.

121
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,984
He has come to rescue us.

122
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,452
- Rescue us from what?
- From ourselves.

123
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,388
He is the Bringer of Compassion.

124
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,364
If he dies, compassion will die with him.

125
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,333
If something happens to the kid,
the whole world goes to hell?

126
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,770
The world will become hell!

127
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,711
It's not far from that now!
Who would want to take the kid?

128
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,509
Those who want evil rather than good.

129
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,446
- Can you be more specific?
- We do not know who took him.

130
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,288
Could you tell me why
they are trying to make him eat blood?

131
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,363
Nothing in this world will hurt him.

132
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:31,526
But if he were to pollute himself
with anything impure,

133
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,263
he would become vulnerable.

134
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:38,034
OK. So if <i>they...</i>

135
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,373
If he eats the blood, they can kill him.

136
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,674
Yes.

137
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,478
Do you have any other questions?

138
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,819
As a matter of fact I do.

139
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,256
What are you doing this weekend,
because your silhouette is kicking!

140
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,099
She plays the maraccas, too?

141
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:09,737
- This is the Chosen One?
- Yes...

142
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,309
You people put on a good show.
Where did you find her?

143
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,538
She's the librarian
at the Secret Repository at Palkor Sin.

144
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,015
She was flown here to help us.
She's over 300 years old.

145
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:25,953
- How did she manage that one?
- An ancestor was raped by a dragon.

146
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,661
Does that happen a lot
where you're from?

147
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,003
I'm sorry I got a little harsh.
Why don't you come up?

148
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,476
No, thank you.

149
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,286
- What is it?
- The spirits, the spirits...

150
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:08,096
A spirit's just told me that
you should come up for a little while,

151
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,930
have a drink,
and wait for further instructions.

152
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,637
I'm sorry. Why don't you come up
for a while? I'll be good.

153
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,809
OK.

154
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,477
I tried.

155
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:32,090
You should always give a woman
two chances to say no, just in case.

156
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,815
That's "no", twice.

157
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:38,361
All right... but the spirits
are going to be very upset.

158
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,589
You know, I am the Chosen One.

159
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,303
OK.

160
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,530
You <i>will</i> eat.

161
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,961
Get this, and the rest of your playthings,
out of here.

162
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,105
Hey, bird!

163
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:29,413
Did you just see a little Hare Krishna
midget in a tree, floating?

164
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:36,421
Or is it me?
That must be Rod Serling.

165
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,195
- Yeah?
- <i>Are you looking for Cheryl Mosely?</i>

166
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:45,632
- Yeah.
- <i>I know the bastards who grabbed her.</i>

167
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,501
- Who was she with?
- <i>Have you ever been in Pacoima?</i>

168
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,666
- Yeah. Who was she with?
- <i>Behind the freeway there's a house.</i>

169
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,870
<i>It's a pad for some bikers</i>
<i>called the Yellow Dragons.</i>

170
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,777
<i>She was with them last week.</i>
<i>She isn't there now.</i>

171
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,215
Who is this? Hello?

172
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,954
- What is it?
- Nothing.

173
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,325
I came prepared
in case we had any other eventualities.

174
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:49,024
Listen, you wait here.

175
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,966
If there's a problem, you leave.
Now, what are you going to do?

176
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,232
- I'll stay here.
- No. You stay here now.

177
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,602
If there's a problem,
get behind the wheel and drive away.

178
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,873
- Understand me? You got that?
- Yes.

179
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,574
Stay... leave. OK.

180
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,276
I won't hurt anybody.
I don't want any trouble.

181
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:41,716
No trouble... I'm sorry,
I just want some chips, that's all.

182
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,878
All I want is chips. A chip, that's it.

183
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,854
Turn that over, it's burning.

184
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,654
I just want some chips.

185
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,802
May I ask you a couple of questions?

186
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,643
- That ought to hold him.
- Yeah, that ought to hold him.

187
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,983
Hey, hey, hey! In my pocket,
there's a whole thing of Tic Tacs.

188
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,591
Take as many as you like. Please.

189
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,911
What are you doing here?

190
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,051
Hey!

191
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,792
I'll bust your brain, asshole!

192
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:12,590
Why did you come in here?
I told you to stay in the car!

193
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,699
I'm not going to turn this into a lecture,

194
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,461
but next time I tell you
to do something, you do it.

195
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:23,335
This is a man thing. This is no place
for a woman to be, understand?

196
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,675
Next time I tell you to do something, do it.
I don't want you to get hurt.

197
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:31,008
- Can I handle this, OK?
- OK.

198
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,515
Leave me alone, asshole.

199
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:42,518
A girl tattooed with a yellow dragon
was here. What happened to her?

200
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,355
What girl?

201
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:52,102
- I've never seen her before.
- OK.

202
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,769
Oh, Cheryl!

203
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,709
Yeah, her... We sold her.

204
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,379
What do you mean?
You sold her to who?

205
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:14,514
To Tommy Tong. He's got that
restaurant down on Broadway.

206
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:21,564
We traded her for a case of cigarettes
and a quart of pork fried rice.

207
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,497
Why would somebody
want to buy somebody?

208
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,069
- He needed a girl.
- For what?

209
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:32,369
He worked out a deal with the Devil.
He said he needed her blood.

210
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:41,876
Look, you're going to go over
and rough him up, huh?

211
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,521
Don't tell him I told you.

212
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:49,649
Why would I do that?
Let me get this right.

213
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:55,823
- So you sold her?
- Yeah, we sold her.

214
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,072
Wait here.

215
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,191
I'm looking for Tommy Tong.

216
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,693
Stop acting stupid,
the man owns the place, all right?

217
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,106
I'm looking for Tommy Tong.

218
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,608
You don't speak English?
Let me translate it.

219
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,545
Bring Tommy Tong here
or I'll bust your ass.

220
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,480
You understand that?

221
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:52,783
You see this dead girl? The last time
she was seen alive was with Tong.

222
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,949
Tell Mr Tong that he has a guest
or I'll bust your ass!

223
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:11,137
Let me show you
how I feel about that karate shit, OK?

224
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:41,232
How did you do that?
What was that... with the flip?

225
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,332
- You killed him.
- I didn't kill him!

226
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,696
- What happened?
- I don't know.

227
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,636
Maybe the guy cut himself shaving
and bled to death looking for a Kleenex.

228
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,775
Really, I... Hey!

229
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,504
Maybe the guy thought
that I was coming,

230
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,515
got scared and figured, "What the hell?"
And killed himself.

231
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,483
- You buy that?
- No.

232
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,885
Neither do I.

233
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,256
We may be up against
supernatural creatures.

234
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,726
- What?
- Demons.

235
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:28,804
By the time he finds you,
it will be too late.

236
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,515
<i>You were wise to kill Tommy Tong.</i>

237
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,818
<i>He was weak,</i>
<i>he might have betrayed us.</i>

238
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,426
Thank you, Lord.

239
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,723
<i>But why is the child still alive?</i>

240
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,230
You have no reason to fear him.

241
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:27,428
He's surrounded at all times
and in all the four directions by evil.

242
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,096
<i>Do not underestimate</i>
<i>the power of good</i>

243
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,902
<i>and do not dismiss</i>
<i>the strength of the child.</i>

244
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,069
<i>Time grows short.</i>
<i>The child will never eat the blood.</i>

245
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,680
What must I do?

246
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:41,545
<i>Move the child before</i>
<i>the Chosen One draws near.</i>

247
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,517
- And to kill him?
- <i>The Ajanti Dagger.</i>

248
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:48,181
<i>It is not of this world.</i>
<i>With it, you could kill the child.</i>

249
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,386
- But it's so well-guarded. How can I...?
- <i>Offer to exchange the child for it.</i>

250
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,657
<i>They can refuse nothing</i>
<i>for his safe return.</i>

251
00:38:55,833 --> 00:39:01,237
<i>Use the Ajanti Dagger.</i>
<i>With it, you need no other evil.</i>

252
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,772
<i>Use the dagger to kill the child.</i>

253
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,099
It's good to see you, Mr Jarrell.

254
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,745
Get your monkey off my back.

255
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,979
Of course. Fu, please retire.

256
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,620
Yeah, Fu. Save it.

257
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,887
Wait a second...

258
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,622
Wait a second, this is a dream.
I'm dreaming! Hey...

259
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,629
Why do you say that?

260
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,894
Because of people like Fu
with his monkey face,

261
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,402
the big-headed guy,
the fat dude and you.

262
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,939
You don't exist, it's a dream.

263
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:22,101
Perhaps I've had you brought here
to make you an attractive offer.

264
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:26,306
I don't think I can accept a proposal
this early in the season.

265
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,080
Thank you.

266
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:40,756
Has it occurred to you how many men
of less worth have attained so much,

267
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,900
while you, who can imagine so much,
have so little?

268
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:48,061
No, I'm not that lucky.
I don't have that much imagination.

269
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,307
I don't like your attitude.

270
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:03,112
This is a nice jacket. It's got a
"Morris Day" feel and looks good on you.

271
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,380
And the boots... smoking.

272
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:11,653
I'll repeat my offer one last time.

273
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,390
I am dreaming, so I can say anything
and get away with it.

274
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:20,026
So I think I'll say, from my heart...

275
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,467
Kiss my ass.

276
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,802
Kiss my ass!

277
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,843
I can see that it's pointless
talking to you.

278
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,916
Why do you insist on mispronouncing
my name, leaving the "J" silent?

279
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:38,180
- My name is "Jarrell" with a "J".
- Yes, I know.

280
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,323
My legs are more attractive.

281
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:44,655
I'm willing to make an exchange.
The child for the Ajanti Dagger.

282
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,873
This is just a reminder of the evening.

283
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,374
Something so that
you will know that you were here.

284
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:04,640
- You don't feel pain in your dream!
- You'll remember this for a long time.

285
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,909
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

286
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:13,216
Do you have any methyolate or
mercurochrome, it might get infected?

287
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,326
Tell your friends that
Sardo Numspa sends his greetings.

288
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,041
It's a mistake.

289
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,083
- Kee!
- Chandler!

290
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,417
They've tied you up in toilet paper.

291
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,792
- What are you doing here?
- I have to be here, it's my dream.

292
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,559
Listen, I think
the kid is here somewhere.

293
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,862
- We should find the kid together.
- Yes.

294
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,837
- Afterwards, we could spend some...
...time together!

295
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:08,240
- Yes, kind of let nature...
...take its course.

296
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,773
Yeah.

297
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,985
So, it is Sardo Numspa.

298
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,619
- What's this knife?
- The Crossed Dagger of Ajanti.

299
00:44:55,325 --> 00:45:00,160
They brought it to this world
to kill the second Golden Child,

300
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,992
the Bearer of Justice.

301
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,863
His death was a great loss.

302
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:11,030
Sardo needs it to kill the child,
but you can only use it to save him.

303
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:16,236
You must obtain the knife and
lure Numspa into freeing the child.

304
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:20,349
You must never let him
get possession of the knife.

305
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,042
That sounds like a neat trick.
How can I pull it off?

306
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:31,955
If need be, we will exchange
the dagger for the child.

307
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,563
If the Abbot of Karma Tang
will let us have it.

308
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:39,260
If the kid's so important, why
doesn't this guy give you the dagger?

309
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,030
He's a very difficult man.

310
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:47,036
Tomorrow, you will go with
Kee Nang to Tibet to obtain the dagger.

311
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:51,875
I ain't going to Tibet because I had
a crazy dream. This is ridiculous.

312
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,177
- Only the Chosen One can get the knife.
- Will you go?

313
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:03,222
Listen, this Chosen One thing
is going too far, OK?

314
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,556
This is not normal, OK?

315
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,857
I'm not saying no,
but I have to think it over,

316
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,866
because the Chosen One thing...
too far.

317
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:16,301
- Could you leave us for a moment?
- Yes, you talk it over.

318
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:19,135
This is not a normal thing
and it should be discussed.

319
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,971
Because it's not normal. Talk.

320
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:27,482
Chosen One, I'm the Chosen One...
Why...? Tibet...

321
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:31,143
Why can't I be chosen
to go to the Bahamas?

322
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:35,314
I've got to get chosen to go to Tibet.
This is really...

323
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:39,588
And Kala, you're not a normal chick.
You're too shy and need to open up.

324
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,993
You can't sit in a basement,
naked, smoking,

325
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,602
looking at soap operas
for the rest of your life.

326
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,482
- Yak loin.
- What is it?

327
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:14,325
- Yak loin. Good to keep the Yang up.
- Nothing wrong with my Yang.

328
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,527
How does
this dream transmission work?

329
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:25,573
- Part's dream and part's real.
- So the scar on my arm's real?

330
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,073
Right.

331
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:30,407
- What about "Numsy"?
- Numspa. Sardo Numspa.

332
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,446
- Yes.
- He's very real.

333
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,881
You were there and said things
that seemed pretty real.

334
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:39,022
- That part was dream.
- Just checking.

335
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,826
Aren't you going to ask me up?

336
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:00,800
- Am I dreaming now?
- Does a lady have to ask twice?

337
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:05,074
No! No... Please, twice!

338
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,580
Please, please.

339
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,048
Shit! Twice!

340
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:23,331
I didn't know whether you wanted
cream or sugar, so I left it black.

341
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,936
I want you to go to Tibet.
Will you go?

342
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,972
Wait a second. It's really cold in Tibet,
and I don't like the cold.

343
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:35,578
Why don't we just stay here
all weekend long under the covers,

344
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:39,682
watching television, sweating,
smiling and everything?

345
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,183
- You won't go.
- It's freezing in Tibet.

346
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:47,119
- Hey, where are you going?
- Tibet.

347
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:51,455
But I'm the Chosen One.
You can't get the knife.

348
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,397
I'll go. I'll go to Tibet.

349
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,234
Wait...

350
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:07,138
But if it's really cold,
we have to come back here. OK?

351
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,743
You are not in a rush
to leave this minute, are you?

352
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,440
Because, you know...

353
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,956
A bed! Is that a bed?

354
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,037
Kathmandu is the gateway to Tibet.

355
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,010
There are bulls walking around here.
And it's cold.

356
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,173
Two days into the mountains
and we'll be at the heights of heaven.

357
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:26,482
I thought this was the best part.
I'm freezing, I'm not enjoying myself.

358
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:29,989
But I want you to know
that I'll do my best to find the child.

359
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,256
Of course you are. I'll arrange
for our trek into the mountains.

360
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,127
You have about an hour to look around.

361
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:25,246
About 16:30,
but I won't make it to the party.

362
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,718
Hi.

363
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,887
Take it easy.

364
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:22,065
You want me to buy a necklace?
OK, I'll buy one.

365
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,265
I'll buy one.
Can you let me have the blue one?

366
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:28,707
I don't know
how much they cost, though.

367
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,277
One of those? OK.

368
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:35,680
Let me have the blue one,
it matches my coat.

369
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:45,057
Wait a second, you took 100!

370
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:50,325
No, one dollar is for you.
See George Washington?

371
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,525
That's Benjamin Franklin,
that's not happening.

372
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,170
Give this... You got the wrong money.

373
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:02,176
Can I have my money back?

374
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:09,381
- You gave me the wrong necklace, too.
- You're breaking my heart, asswipe.

375
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:13,614
- You speak English just fine.
- So do you, so what of it?

376
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:18,159
Give me my 100 back, take this dollar
and give me the right one.

377
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:22,196
Monkey breath, puke face,
eater of turtle slime.

378
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:28,035
- Give me my shit and take your shit.
- What, scuzzbucket?

379
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,469
OK, you slick shithead.

380
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,200
You sneaky little bastard!

381
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,810
You want your money? Take it!

382
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:01,704
Did you see a little naked man
with a $100 bill?

383
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:04,601
I have arranged for
yaks, ponies and boats.

384
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:07,436
You didn't see a naked bum
with $100?

385
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:10,512
No, but I can arrange for one. Come on.

386
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,276
You've got to show up sooner or later.
When you do, your ass is kicked.

387
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:20,389
I'll sell your clothes, leave you here
naked and bleeding without money.

388
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,890
Little dirty bastard!
Dude took my money.

389
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,999
If that bum hadn't taken my $100,
we'd have a boat with a motor.

390
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,432
- Shut up and paddle.
- Yeah, I'm gonna paddle.

391
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,700
I'm gonna paddle your ass
when I find you. I'll use this row.

392
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,969
I'm gonna row your ass till it bleeds!

393
00:54:54,924 --> 00:55:00,226
- We'll be there soon.
- You'd better have a spatula.

394
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,524
My ass is frozen to this yak.

395
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,710
Bow.

396
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,649
That's the dude who took my money!

397
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:09,955
We have come to ask for
the sacred Crossed Dagger of Ajanti.

398
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:14,593
- For what reason?
- For the Golden Child.

399
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:19,572
- He does not need it.
- To save his life.

400
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:24,009
The child lives for our sakes,
not for his own.

401
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,276
I humbly beg you,
let us have the knife.

402
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,985
Let him ask it.

403
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,397
I-I-I... want the knife.

404
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,905
Let him ask again.

405
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,522
I want the knife.

406
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,765
Please.

407
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,047
Only a man whose heart is pure
can wield the knife.

408
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,587
If you're such a man,
you will have it.

409
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,959
"Only a man whose heart is pure
can wield the knife."

410
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:51,590
And only a man whose ass is narrow
can get down these steps.

411
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:55,226
And if mine is such an ass,
then I shall have it.

412
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:00,268
Oh, shit.

413
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,173
Beyond the door is a corridor.

414
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:06,975
At the other end
is the sacred Ajanti Dagger.

415
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,519
If you walk to the other end of
the corridor and retrieve it, it's yours.

416
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,953
- That sounds simple enough.
- Just one thing.

417
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:18,025
You must carry this glass of water
without spilling one drop.

418
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:21,630
Are you Monty Hall now?
You must be Carol Marrow.

419
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,733
"Don't spill any water."
This is crazy!

420
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,893
And keep your thought
as pure as the water.

421
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,767
- The water isn't pure.
- Neither are you!

422
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,933
I give you this advice. Stay on the path.

423
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,707
You've got it.

424
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:44,844
I'm so afraid of the dark, too.

425
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:05,231
You need to get somebody
to come and clean up down here!

426
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:34,932
This is a piece of cake.
This is a piece of cake, OK?

427
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:43,405
Come on, come on...

428
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:52,120
Hey, there's no floor.
There's no ground.

429
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,518
Wait a minute, I've got it.

430
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:58,684
There is a ground. You're making it
look like there's no ground,

431
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:03,594
to see if I would be scared
and run back.

432
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:08,325
There's a ground, Monty!

433
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:32,423
There's no ground here!

434
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,688
Oh, shit...

435
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:54,280
- <i>Remember, stay on the path!</i>
- I heard you the first time!

436
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,715
Let's just hope the path stays under me!

437
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:38,185
- But I was supposed to stay on the path!
- <i>Yes.</i>

438
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,194
<i>But you must know</i>
<i>when to break the rules.</i>

439
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:45,198
- How many have survived this test?
- <i>None!</i>

440
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,134
None?

441
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:53,472
None? I'm going to break your ass,
when I get out of here.

442
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:57,033
What am I doing wrong?

443
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,699
I followed all your rules,
what am I doing wrong?

444
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:08,948
Keep your thoughts as pure
as the water and don't drop the water.

445
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,712
Don't drop the water.

446
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:16,557
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

447
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,718
The water...
The fire and the water...

448
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,659
OK.

449
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,169
To Monty!

450
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:31,037
A toast!

451
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,720
I've got the knife,
now turn on the goddamn light!

452
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:10,139
What is it, asswipe?

453
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:17,514
I want to ask your advice
about something.

454
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,623
I'll let that slide,
because it's your way.

455
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,951
Don't press your luck, though.

456
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,968
I know that you're
a very old and wise and...

457
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,996
...disgusting guy.

458
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,908
You'll wipe that on yourjacket, huh?

459
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:45,309
I was wondering what a man says
to a woman from your world,

460
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:50,077
when he wants her to understand that
he loves her and wants to marry her.

461
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:55,390
If you took the short path and reached
enlightenment before tomorrow,

462
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,618
who would want you for a husband?

463
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:03,254
- What's the short path?
- First of all, you must remain pure.

464
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:07,129
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

465
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,841
Oh, you mean no...

466
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:22,283
- Is there a long way?
- It takes 10,000 lifetimes.

467
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:26,080
We don't have that much time.
No women, what else?

468
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:32,251
For you? You must trust someone
you have no reason to trust.

469
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:36,489
You must make a promise
to someone you have just met.

470
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,692
You must love someone
who loves you.

471
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:47,471
- How can I know when to do all that?
- That's for you to decide.

472
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:52,679
You must tell no one
that I have put you on the path.

473
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:59,244
Well, thanks for your help.

474
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:02,186
He thinks I helped him!

475
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:08,126
Get that booger off yourjacket before
it freezes and you scratch yourself.

476
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:15,393
Keep that $100. There's no telling what
might be on the bill, when you return it!

477
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:32,711
Gompa? I have ruined myself
for the American.

478
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:36,016
- He's a fool.
- But he's brave.

479
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:40,128
- He's irresponsible.
- But he's generous.

480
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:45,133
He thinks of nothing
but protecting his own feelings.

481
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:51,000
But if you touch his heart,
there's nothing he wouldn't do for you.

482
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,539
He believes in nothing.

483
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:57,008
And still he does what is right.

484
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,307
He's a careless,
thoughtless, undisciplined fool.

485
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:06,080
Yes. I do like him very much.
It's very hard not to.

486
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,350
Those magnificent Americans.

487
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:14,690
So much power and so little
understanding of what to do with it.

488
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:19,062
What should I do?

489
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:24,939
You must help him
save the Golden Child.

490
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:28,508
And follow your heart.

491
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:34,643
- Thank you, Gompa.
- You're welcome, Daughter.

492
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,755
And when you want to marry him,
you have my blessing.

493
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:43,884
Thank you, Father.

494
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:55,133
They won't let me on the plane
with the knife.

495
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:58,705
- Yes, they will.
- No, they won't. I'm going to jail.

496
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:02,905
Thank you.

497
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:08,949
This won't work, and I'll spend the rest
of my life in a clay cell in Kathmandu.

498
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:12,679
- Another cow?
- It's Kathmandu, what do you expect?

499
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:18,316
There's no way they'll let me
on the plane with a knife under my shirt.

500
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:21,019
Relax and trust in your destiny.

501
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,529
- Come on.
- You trust in <i>your</i> destiny.

502
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,065
- Come with me.
- I have nothing to declare.

503
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:30,296
- But necessary.
- Why? I can show you my bag here.

504
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:33,306
- For your own protection.
- These are just my drawers.

505
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,740
These are clean
and those are dirty.

506
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:39,779
Excuse me, I have a plane to catch.
Come on, hurry up.

507
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,076
- What's this?
- Nothing.

508
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:48,087
Just once I want to go back to America.
I'm a citizen. What are you looking at?

509
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:52,956
It just does my heart good
to see another American citizen.

510
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:58,399
- Hold it!
- Are you crazy?

511
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:04,938
No, I'm Agent Jarrell from the American
Stolen Artefacts Foundation.

512
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:09,134
Everybody, it's OK! I'm with
the Stolen Artefacts Foundation!

513
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,303
Freddie, get out of my sight!
You make me sick!

514
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,416
I'll talk to you on the plane.
Nobody be alarmed!

515
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:19,281
I'm Chandler Jarrell,
American Stolen Artefacts Foundation.

516
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:23,186
Thanks to you, we were able
to catch this man, Freddie,

517
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,554
the piece of shit back there.

518
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,595
I thank the good people of Nepal.

519
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:31,255
You're all brilliant. Thank you, sir.

520
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:38,134
You are one hell of a leader.
The cunningness... the instinct...

521
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,708
The instinct is brilliant. I can tell
that you trained under this man.

522
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:44,277
You have the same glare of brilliance
in your eye.

523
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:47,347
You didn't know what you did,
but you're brilliant.

524
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:51,111
The best brilliance is born
from someone ignorant...

525
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:55,852
Forget it.
This is my assistant, Kee Nang.

526
01:09:56,025 --> 01:10:00,689
We thank you all.
People of Nepal, we thank you!

527
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,923
You're a bunch of
beautiful, brilliant people.

528
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:06,829
Nepal! N-E-P-A-L!

529
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,197
Viva Nepal! Viva Nepal!

530
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,307
No, thanks.

531
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,289
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

532
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,895
Hey. This is your problem, now.

533
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:10,964
Thank you. You did a marvellous job
in obtaining the knife.

534
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:18,036
You will be spending the next few days
at the house of a certain friend.

535
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,767
When will we be contacted
about the knife?

536
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:30,082
That's him. If he doesn't return
my property, I want him arrested.

537
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:39,255
Welcome home, Mr Jarrell.
You have something for me.

538
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:49,059
I'm sorry, Numsy.
I should be punished!

539
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:52,401
Everyone, I have stolen
from my brother, Numsy.

540
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:55,737
Officer, it's your duty to take me in.
Please, purge me.

541
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:59,074
I'm ashamed of myself.
I should be arrested.

542
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:02,081
I should be purged,
I should be flogged.

543
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,152
- I shouldn't walk among good people.
- Let me talk to him.

544
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:09,280
I'm a swine, a wretch.
I don't deserve to live like others.

545
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:12,427
How long do you think
you can keep up this masquerade?

546
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:16,792
Until I get arrested, or you realise
the rules of evidence in this country.

547
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:20,958
If I get arrested, they'll take me
and put me in a jail cell.

548
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:27,041
They'll take the knife, because it's stolen,
and put an "Exhibit A" sticker on it.

549
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:31,509
The knife sits in a room
and I sit in my little room

550
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,116
until the trial comes up
a month to a year later.

551
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:39,380
If you get me arrested, there's no telling
when you'll get your knife.

552
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,491
You have no idea who I am, have you?

553
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:50,826
Yes! You're Sardo Numsy!

554
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,360
I don't care who you are. I do care
that you kidnapped a kid, though.

555
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,371
I could destroy you just like that.

556
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:04,008
We wouldn't want that. Listen...

557
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:06,807
Bring me the boy
and I'll give you the knife.

558
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,849
Then no one will have
to be destroyed "just like that".

559
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,878
Think it over.

560
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,955
My brother's forgiven me!

561
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:19,060
Kee, Dr Hong,
Brother Numsy has forgiven me.

562
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:24,161
Dear brother!
Thank you, you're wonderful!

563
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:27,666
- What else did you tell him?
- That I wouldn't be as polite next time.

564
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:32,204
- You are foolhardy, aren't you?
- Well, I do my best.

565
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:27,293
Are you coming to bed?

566
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:32,325
No, I think I'm going to sleep out here.

567
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,797
Oh...

568
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:39,805
Good night.

569
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:35,796
I just heard something.

570
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,428
I don't like this. Let's get out of here.

571
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,613
Run!

572
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:31,944
I did not spend the night with you
to obligate you.

573
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:36,278
I spent the night with you
because I love you.

574
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:52,465
- She is beyond this world of pain.
- You can save her.

575
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:56,234
The Golden Child can bring her back.

576
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:59,067
As long as sunlight
still shines on her body...

577
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,142
No more magic and riddles.
She's dead!

578
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,645
You are the Chosen One.
You <i>will</i> find the child.

579
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:15,187
You have until nightfall to find him.
Sardo can't kill him until dark.

580
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,552
We'll get you out of here, OK?

581
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,404
Where's your boss?

582
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:26,267
Keep an eye on the kid.
Don't worry, I'm the Chosen One.

583
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,772
This won't take long.

584
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:33,874
My dear, sweet brother Numsy!

585
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:47,019
I can see that you're busy right now.
I'll come back some other time.

586
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,269
There are no keys in the car!

587
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,074
Come on, come on!

588
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,121
- Everything's going to be OK.
- I know.

589
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:16,621
Fasten your seatbelt, kid.

590
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:33,499
Did somebody give you a Valium,
or what?

591
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:41,714
This must happen a lot where
you're from. I'm gonna shit on myself!

592
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:09,700
Hey, Goldie!

593
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:15,406
You ain't going to help me with
the chain, just keep running, right?

594
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,483
Hey, wait!

595
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:42,713
- How long are you going to be?
- Two weeks.

596
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:46,012
- You drop the kid off and come back.
- Yes!

597
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:47,654
Good!

598
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:50,814
Listen, I bought this for you.

599
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:55,759
You put that on and no one will mess
with your head while you're here.

600
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,795
Good? Good.

601
01:28:57,965 --> 01:29:01,025
You don't want to go to Tibet
with a big... on your head.

602
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:07,232
That is a cool trick. Did you ever
think about going into show business?

603
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:09,842
I could be your partner,
I'd throw a rock at you,

604
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:14,072
and you'd make it float off
and hit the wall. Standing ovations.

605
01:29:14,248 --> 01:29:19,083
Do they have
Ed MacMahon's <i>Starsearch</i> in Tibet?

606
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:21,687
Probably not.
They probably have <i>Foodsearch.</i>

607
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:27,260
We could go on <i>Starsearch</i> and
let the audience throw rocks at you.

608
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:32,092
You could move your hand
and make them hit MacMahon... hard.

609
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:12,313
