1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:30,416
Soubirous.

3
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,557
Soubirous.

4
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:38,572
If you go early,
maybe you'll find work.

5
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:40,913
Mm.

6
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,944
Bonjour,
Monsieur Maisongrosse.

7
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,017
Ah, no work
for you today.

8
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:18,221
How can I hire anybody when
there isn't enough to keep me busy?

9
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:20,394
<i>People don't
come to bakers anymore.</i>

10
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:23,181
<i>No, they go to pastry cooks
because it's stylish.</i>

11
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,863
Why don't you
try the hospital?

12
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:29,678
The man who was doing odd jobs
moved to Tarbes yesterday.

13
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:31,600
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

14
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:13,321
Take that stuff clear out to the dump
at Massabielle and burn every bit of it.

15
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:16,327
<i>It's full of infection
and disease.</i>

16
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,774
Why did Christ
found the Church?

17
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:04,905
Christ founded the Church to teach,
govern, sanctify, and save all men.

18
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,830
How long did Christ
live on Earth?

19
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:10,921
Christ lived on Earth about 33 years
and led a most holy life in poverty.

20
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:14,733
That is correct, except that you omitted
the last and most important word.

21
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,741
"In poverty and suffering."

22
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:18,670
Never forget that, my child...

23
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:22,150
for only through suffering can we
hope to gain the Kingdom of God.

24
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:24,077
What is the Holy Trinity?

25
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,647
I said,
"What is the Holy Trinity?"

26
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:32,013
- Didn't you hear me?
- Yes, Sister, I heard you...

27
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,020
but I know nothing about it.

28
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:36,583
Have you ever heard of it?

29
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,054
Maybe I've heard of it.

30
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:41,006
You puzzle me, my child.

31
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:43,045
Are you pert, indifferent,
or only stupid?

32
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:46,731
I'm stupid, Sister.

33
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:48,686
I have a poor head for study.

34
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:52,295
You're also pert.
You're a grown girl, Bernadette...

35
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,308
the oldest in the class.

36
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:56,520
Ignorance of the Holy Trinity
is inexcusable.

37
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:00,359
<i>Go to the foot of the class.</i>

38
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:03,340
What is it, Marie?

39
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:06,220
I just wanted to say
that my sister Bernadette...

40
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:09,417
was sick the day the class learned
about the Holy Trinity.

41
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:11,341
She misses school a lot.

42
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:13,926
- She's always ailing.
- What ails her?

43
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,584
They call it "atma"
or some such name.

44
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:21,421
- You trying to say asthma?
- Yes, Sister. That's what Dr. Dozous calls it.

45
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,261
She can't breathe.
Sometimes she sounds just like this...

46
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:31,494
- Laughter wastes valuable time.
Return to your studies.

47
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,914
Antoinette, perhaps you can tell
Bernadette what the Holy Trinity is.

48
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:38,987
The Holy Trinity is one God
in three divine persons.

49
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,868
<i>God the Father, God the Son
and God the Holy Ghost.</i>

50
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,268
<i>Sister Marie Th√©rese, bonjour.</i>

51
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:46,504
<i>Bonjour,
Father Peyramale.</i>

52
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:50,793
- Bonjour, children.
- Bonjour, Your Reverence.

53
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:53,032
I was passing,
so I thought I'd stop in, Sister...

54
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,752
to see how many children
you were preparing for First Communion.

55
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:58,472
Six. We were just having
a review of our catechism.

56
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:01,607
Well, you all know
your catechism?

57
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,165
Yes, Your Reverence.

58
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,952
To learn your catechism
requires great diligence.

59
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,093
I believe such diligence
should be rewarded.

60
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:11,816
I have some holy pictures.
Would you like one?

61
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,739
Oh, yes, Your Reverence.

62
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,976
Very well.

63
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:20,235
- Here you are.
- Thank you, Your Reverence.

64
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,307
- As you grow older...
- Thank you, Your Reverence.

65
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,868
You will realize that
in learning your catechism...

66
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:28,552
you have given yourselves not only
a foundation of religious teachings...

67
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:33,028
but also a doctrine to guide you
as human beings throughout your lives.

68
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,751
<i>I'm sorry, Father.</i>

69
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:38,405
This girl is not deserving.
It would be unfair to the others.

70
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:41,291
The have studied
their catechism. She has not.

71
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,625
Well, that's too bad.
I'm sorry.

72
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:47,522
<i>It should be
an incentive to you then. Study hard.</i>

73
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:58,889
You found work?

74
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,570
Twenty sous!

75
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:07,564
From the baker?

76
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:11,273
Where then?

77
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:13,194
Don't ask me.

78
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:16,226
- You didn't beg.
- Worse.

79
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:18,154
Stinking filth
from the hospital...

80
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:20,074
had to be carted away
and burned.

81
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:22,954
That's the kind of job
they give to Soubirous.

82
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,190
This is where
they let him live.

83
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,267
Soubirous, the miller...

84
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:29,827
who made the finest
flour in Escobe...

85
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:31,754
lives in a jail...

86
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:34,405
that's too cold and damp
for prisoners.

87
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:36,329
Wasn't good enough
for thieves and murderers...

88
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,249
but for Soubirous
and his family...

89
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,169
sure, let them live here.

90
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:43,169
Let them freeze in the winter
and roast in the summer.

91
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,894
Let them get sick and die.
Who cares?

92
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:49,926
<i>Come in, Jeanne.
Maman, Jeanne came along.</i>

93
00:10:50,027 --> 00:10:52,329
She's going to help me
with my studies later.

94
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:56,388
All right. There's always enough
for one more. Sit down, all of you.

95
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,840
Oh, please don't, madame. I'm not a
bit hungry. I'll just watch the others.

96
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:03,689
Hail Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
The one that eats fastest gets the most.

97
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:06,056
<i>Justin! Where did you learn that?</i>

98
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,977
You'll go to hell
for saying such a thing.

99
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:12,166
All I said, "The one that eats the
fastest gets the most." And it's true!

100
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:16,740
- Now you've said it again!
- I've seen pigs with better manners and cleaner faces.

101
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:19,528
Get up from that table and go
wash yourselves! Both of you!

102
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:22,758
Oh, a mass meeting here, hmm?
How can anybody sleep with such racket?

103
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:26,207
- We're sorry, Papa.
- It's cold in here. Somebody fix a fire.

104
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:29,446
- There's no wood.
- So I'm to get the wood too?

105
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:33,540
I work hard all day long.
All I ask is a little peace and warmth.

106
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,650
What do I get?
Cold and chills.

107
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,577
Must I do everything
around here?

108
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:39,976
I'll go hunt for wood, Papa!

109
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,824
<i>- May I go with Marie and help, maman?
- No. You'll do no such thing.</i>

110
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:45,540
- You know how easily you catch cold.
- I'll dress real warm.

111
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,465
<i>- Maman.! Maman.!
- Please?</i>

112
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,497
<i>- All right. All right. Only wrap up good!
- Maman.! Maman.!</i>

113
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:53,766
<i>- Can I go too? Oh, but please, maman.
- No!</i>

114
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:57,641
You'll stay in this house and spend the
rest of the day asking God for forgiveness.

115
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,560
- Louise! Louise!
- What's wrong, Croisine?

116
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:02,527
The baby! Convulsions again! I don't
know what to do! Help me, Louise!

117
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:05,863
- Be calm, Croisine! Go back. I'll be over in a minute.
- Please, come now.

118
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:07,936
<i>- Maman, can I go with you and look?
- No!</i>

119
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:10,016
You stay here with your brother.

120
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,097
You can ask
for a little forgiveness too!

121
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,089
I want you girls back
before dark.

122
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:19,616
- Come on, Bernadette!
- Hurry up!

123
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:22,089
The last one
over the bridge is a goose!

124
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,791
<i>Hola, Bernadette.</i>

125
00:12:41,897 --> 00:12:43,719
Good day,
Madame Nicolau.

126
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:45,428
- Are your parents well?
- Yes. Very well. Thank you.

127
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:47,040
- Are your parents well?
- Yes. Very well. Thank you.

128
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:49,479
And how is your son
Monsieur Antoine?

129
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:53,254
<i>Splendid, thank you. And, uh,
Mademoiselle Bernadette?</i>

130
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,654
I'm well.
Thank you, monsieur.

131
00:12:57,033 --> 00:13:00,263
Well, I'd better hurry on.
My sister will wonder about me.

132
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,183
May I use your bridge?

133
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,420
As often as you like...
and no toll charge.

134
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:06,408
Thank you, monsieur.

135
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,270
Here. You better let me help you.
That bridge is not so dependable.

136
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:38,534
Thank you, monsieur.
You're very kind.

137
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:40,803
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

138
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,662
She's growing into
a fine young woman, isn't she?

139
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:55,079
Marie!

140
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:05,479
Marie!

141
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:09,093
Jeanne!

142
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:12,290
- Oh! Oh, for a moment I thought
it was the devil himself.

143
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:15,108
- You should have seen your face!
- You were nothing but eyes and mouth.

144
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:18,688
- You'd have been scared too.
- There's the wood over there. Come on. Follow me.

145
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:37,509
- We'll wade across.
- That's private property over there.

146
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:40,542
- What if it is?
- If we take wood from there, we'll be stealing.

147
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,265
Wood is wood. Don't
be such a fraidy cat, Bernadette.

148
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,302
- I'm not a fraidy cat.
- Yes, you are too.

149
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,295
Come on, Marie.
Let's go.

150
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:51,586
Oh! It's cold!

151
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,814
It's freezing! Hurry up!

152
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:02,977
<i>- It's cold.! Hurry.!
- It's co-o-old.!</i>

153
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,785
Bernadette, don't you
come in that water!

154
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:12,708
<i>Remember
what maman told you!</i>

155
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:15,588
- I won't catch cold.
- Oh, won't you? You'll get a cough...

156
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:17,955
then your asthma
will keep me awake all night long.

157
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:20,737
Maybe I can jump
across the rocks or something.

158
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,398
<i>Yes, and tumble in.</i>

159
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:26,277
And when you fall in and get your bottom
wet, don't ask me to wring you out.

160
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:29,473
But if I dry my feet real well,
I won't catch cold.

161
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:32,956
Oh, we don't need you anyway.
Come on, Marie. Let's go.

162
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:34,884
You stay there
till we get back.

163
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:37,764
<i>But three can carry
more than two can.!</i>

164
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,986
But what if she's not there?

165
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,287
I can't carry this heavy bundle
all the way back into town.

166
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,065
<i>Bernadette.!</i>

167
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,050
<i>Yoo-hoo.!</i>

168
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:49,084
See? I told you
she'd sneak off.

169
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:52,732
No, no. She wouldn't do that.
She's here somewhere.

170
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,953
There she is. Bernadette!

171
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:10,081
<i>Bernadette, come on.!
We've gotta go home.!</i>

172
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,999
<i>Bernadette, come on, now.!</i>

173
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,880
- What are you doing?
- Bernadette!

174
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,208
Maybe she's dead.

175
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,128
Holy Mother!
Maybe her asthma's killed her.

176
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:26,527
Oh, nonsense.
If she were dead, she'd be lying flat.

177
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:29,408
- Whoever heard of a dead person kneeling?
- Then why doesn't she speak?

178
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:32,441
She's trying to be funny.
I'll show her.

179
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:41,473
<i>Bernadette.!</i>

180
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,924
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

181
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:52,669
- That's what we're asking you!
- I thought your asthma had killed you!

182
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:03,360
<i>Don'tjust stand there. Come on.! You
know we've got to get home before dark.</i>

183
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:06,839
I'm coming.

184
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:09,760
We're not gonna wade through
that cold water again.

185
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:11,679
You go down that side
of the river...

186
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,882
and we'll meet you
at the bridge.

187
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:20,823
What cheats you two are.
This water is as warm as dishwater.

188
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:25,023
- Bernadette!
- You've got bats in your belfry!

189
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:27,739
- That water's freezing!
- Well, it isn't now.

190
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,207
Look, my toes
are not even white.

191
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:35,802
What were you doing over there,
kneeling in the rocks?

192
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,705
- Didn't you see anyone?
- Who?

193
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:43,736
Was somebody with you
in that cave?

194
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:48,223
Ohh. Somebody was.

195
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,622
And you were praying
for forgiveness.

196
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,054
- Jeanne.
- Come on. Tell us who it was.

197
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:56,218
Well, if I tell you...

198
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,621
you must swear
not to give me away.

199
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,306
<i>If maman should hear of it,
she might take a stick to me.</i>

200
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:04,986
- I swear.
- I give you my word, but I won't swear.

201
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:06,910
Swearing like that
is a mortal sin...

202
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:10,553
and you don't want me to sin like that
just before my First Communion, do you?

203
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:12,663
Aw, come on.
Tell us.

204
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:16,542
Well...

205
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,494
I saw a lady...

206
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:20,414
and she was all in white.

207
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,032
<i>- A lady?
- And she wore a blue girdle...</i>

208
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:26,714
and had a golden rose
on each foot.

209
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:30,231
I've never seen anything
in my life so beautiful.

210
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:33,117
Oh, piffle.

211
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:36,150
What would a beautiful lady
be doing in a filthy place like that?

212
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,230
I don't know.

213
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:41,303
But she was there...
truly, she was.

214
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:43,196
Tsk.

215
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:46,394
Come on.
Let's get away from here.

216
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:48,317
You take that bundle.

217
00:21:48,415 --> 00:21:51,710
No. I'll take this one.
It's bigger, and you must be tired.

218
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:17,053
The girls are not home yet?

219
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:19,038
Huh? No.

220
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,413
Oh, uh, Madame Millet's
coachman was here...

221
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,292
said there wouldn't
be anymore washing for you to do.

222
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,470
Tsk.

223
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:34,516
Where is the food
going to come from?

224
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:36,444
Don't ask me.

225
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,771
I've been laying here
worrying about that all afternoon.

226
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,652
Bernadette!
Where have you been?

227
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,532
<i>- I've been worried to death.
- But we got wood, maman.</i>

228
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,452
Three bundles...
enough for days.

229
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,622
There are other things to be done
besides getting wood.

230
00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:51,930
Sweeping and cleaning
and water to be fetched.

231
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:55,029
- I'll fetch the water, Maman.
- I'm about at the end of my rope.

232
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,973
Bernadette!

233
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:02,260
Bernadette! Don't run!

234
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:05,661
<i>- See you at school tomorrow. Maman, please take this.
- Good night, Marie.</i>

235
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,986
Tsk. She has no business
running like that.

236
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,387
She ran all the way home.

237
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:16,180
I couldn't even catch up to her.

238
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:18,424
She'll be coughing all night.

239
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,348
Bernadette's all excited...

240
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:23,380
because she says
she saw a lady at Massabielle...

241
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,708
all dressed in white
with golden roses on her feet.

242
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:30,903
<i>- What on earth are you talking about?
- That's what she told us.</i>

243
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:32,980
Golden roses on her feet.

244
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:37,144
She said this lady was standing
on a rock and smiled at her.

245
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:40,114
She had a rosary of pearls
and a golden crucifix...

246
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:41,628
<i>Marie.!</i>

247
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,747
You told on me.
And you said you wouldn't.

248
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,211
<i>Maman asked me.</i>

249
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:52,508
What's this foolishness
Marie tells me?

250
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:57,623
<i>It's true, maman. In the cave at
Massabielle, I saw a most beautiful lady.</i>

251
00:23:57,724 --> 00:24:00,091
A lady? What lady?

252
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,839
I don't know.
Suddenly she was there...

253
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,763
and then, suddenly,
she disappeared.

254
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:08,723
<i>- Ahh. Nonsense.
- Oh, no, maman. She was there.</i>

255
00:24:08,828 --> 00:24:11,162
Her face was so beautiful.

256
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,399
<i>Just to look at her made me feel...</i>

257
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,355
Soubirous,
you hear what she says?

258
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:20,024
I heard... and I know
why she says it too.

259
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:24,281
She's showing off.
Makes up a story to feel important.

260
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,163
It always starts
the same way with fairy tales.

261
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,148
Golden roses on her feet!

262
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:31,764
<i>Indeed.!</i>

263
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:36,439
No, Papa.
I really and truly saw the Lady.

264
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,395
Truly, I did.

265
00:24:40,316 --> 00:24:43,315
<i>Come in!</i>

266
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,882
It's for you, dear friend.

267
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,802
For saving my baby today.

268
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,090
Compared to a child's life, it's not
much, but we want you to have it.

269
00:25:07,676 --> 00:25:10,839
Oh, no.
No, I can't possibly.

270
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:13,656
<i>It's the only way
we have of repaying you.</i>

271
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:15,729
<i>Please.</i>

272
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:17,907
Yes, Louise.

273
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:20,051
After all, if our friends
are good enough to offer...

274
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:22,424
then the least we can do
is accept.

275
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:25,011
- But you need the food as much as we do.
- No, no.

276
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:27,187
My aunt came today
with much more than this.

277
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:30,520
We are merely sharing
our good fortune with you.

278
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:36,209
May God bless you both.

279
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:38,998
<i>- Why, this is food enough for days.
- Sausages.!</i>

280
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:40,921
Just like the kind
in the butcher's window!

281
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:43,921
- What a magnificent omelette those eggs will make.
- Ah, Louis!

282
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:45,968
<i>Bonsoir, Charles.
Madame, monsieur.</i>

283
00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:47,897
<i>Ah, Louis.
Good to see you.</i>

284
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:50,296
What brings you here
besides a cold rump?

285
00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:52,369
- You heard about Doutreloux?
- The stableman for Cazenave?

286
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:54,547
Uh-huh. A horse kicked him
and broke his leg.

287
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,505
- The horse broke his leg?
- No, no.

288
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:58,544
Doutreloux broke his leg...
three places.

289
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:00,723
<i>- Oh, mercy. That is bad.
- Oh, mercy, that is good.</i>

290
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:04,569
- Oh, shame on you!
- I mean it is bad for Doutreloux...

291
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,489
but it's good for your husband.

292
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:09,882
Cazenave offers you the job.
That's why I'm here.

293
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,898
It pays two francs a day
and your lunch.

294
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:14,001
- Soubirous!
- Two francs a day!

295
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:17,521
<i>- And the lunches are hot.
- Papa, can I ride in the coach with you?</i>

296
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:19,666
Me first. I'm older.

297
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,909
Why, you seem surprised.

298
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:23,984
After all, it was agreed
between Cazenave and myself...

299
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,912
that I should
fill the first vacancy.

300
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:30,799
But stableman? Well, I suppose even
a miller can't be too choosy these days.

301
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:33,272
You may tell Cazenave
that I accept.

302
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,370
He knows it. He wants you be there
at 5:00 in the morning.

303
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,231
<i>- Tears, maman?
- Only because I am so happy.</i>

304
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:45,526
I'm happy too.
We must celebrate.

305
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,448
- You will all stay to dinner.
- Oh, no, no, no.

306
00:26:47,545 --> 00:26:50,545
- Nonsense. You will dine with us!
- But tonight? I hadn't planned.

307
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,846
So we change our plan.
We have food. I have a position.

308
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,880
- We accepted your eggs. Now you
must accept our omelette.

309
00:26:56,985 --> 00:27:00,149
I will not hear another word!

310
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,545
<i>Children, help your mother.!</i>

311
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:06,324
<i>A succulent omelette
with sausages, maman.</i>

312
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:21,396
<i>Maman.! Maman.! Maman.!</i>

313
00:27:25,241 --> 00:27:27,281
Well, what is it?

314
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:32,879
- Bernadette.
- Speak. Speak!

315
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,919
- She's dead or something.
- What?

316
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:38,000
She's all white
and sick-looking.

317
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:39,991
Where is she?

318
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:44,141
They're taking her
to Madame Nicolau's.

319
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,386
<i>Oh, please. Please stay outside.
Outside, all of you.</i>

320
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:09,238
<i>- Please leave her in peace. She's very sick.
- It's all right, maman.</i>

321
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:11,757
<i>She's opening her eyes.</i>

322
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:15,701
- Do you feel better now?
- Yes. Thank you, madame.

323
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:19,694
- I'll fix you some warm milk.
- Thank you very much, but I don't need anything.

324
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,582
What was the matter?
What happened?

325
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,029
The Lady was there
a long time...

326
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,110
and she spoke to me.

327
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:33,461
She spoke to you?
What did she say?

328
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,342
She said...

329
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:42,103
"Will you render me the grace
of coming here each day for 15 days?"

330
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:44,371
And then she added...

331
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:48,181
"I cannot promise to make you
happy in this world...

332
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,253
only in the next."

333
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,621
So after church we asked
Bernadette to come with us...

334
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:04,174
because we wanted to see
if we could see the Lady.

335
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,581
<i>- Well, did you see her?
- No. None of us saw her.</i>

336
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,718
<i>But Bernadette said she did.</i>

337
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:10,797
Please.

338
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,413
Bernadette.

339
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:19,217
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yes, maman.</i>

340
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:21,206
There's nothing
to worry about.

341
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,621
Nothing to worry about?

342
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:38,003
Scare me half to death, and you say
there's nothing to worry about.

343
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:45,205
I left your father's dinner
to burn.

344
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:48,749
I ran through the streets like
a madwoman. And what do I find?

345
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:53,164
You sitting there like a...
like a princess on a throne.

346
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,790
- You good for n...
- Don't strike the child!

347
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,781
She's an Angel of God.

348
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:59,732
Angel?

349
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:01,684
She's the laughingstock
of Lourdes.

350
00:30:03,157 --> 00:30:07,314
<i>Come, maman. Maybe we can
get home before Papa does.</i>

351
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:13,076
No. I won't budge from this place until you
promise me never again to go to Massabielle.

352
00:30:13,173 --> 00:30:16,272
<i>- Never!
- But, maman, I can't promise that.</i>

353
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:19,789
The Lady has asked me
to return every day for 15 days.

354
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:22,992
<i>Promise your mother, Bernadette.
Such excitement's bad for you.</i>

355
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:24,916
You're sure to be
sick from it.

356
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:27,152
Very well.

357
00:30:27,254 --> 00:30:31,312
<i>I promise you, maman,
never to go to Massabielle again...</i>

358
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,155
unless you, yourself,
give me permission.

359
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:37,391
And that, I can promise you,
you'll never get!

360
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:39,795
I'm going to send you
to your Aunt Bernarde in Bartres...

361
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:42,096
where you'll forget
this foolishness.

362
00:30:42,197 --> 00:30:44,685
Now, home with you.
And you too!

363
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:46,992
Thank you for your kindness,
Madame Nicolau.

364
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:50,444
And thank you too, monsieur.

365
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:55,411
<i>What do you
think of it all, maman?</i>

366
00:30:55,508 --> 00:30:57,450
Things like that
bode no good.

367
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:06,291
<i>Maman, as long as I live, I'll
never see anything more beautiful...</i>

368
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:09,323
than the face of that girl
as she lay there at Massabielle.

369
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:15,632
One ought not even
touch a being like that.

370
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:29,810
<i>Maman. Maman.</i>

371
00:31:29,908 --> 00:31:32,461
<i>- Hmm? What is it?
- Bernadette's crying.</i>

372
00:31:47,443 --> 00:31:49,331
What's the matter,
my love?

373
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,766
Come to Mother.
We'll sit by the fire.

374
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:35,537
<i>Oh, maman, the Lady
was so beautiful.</i>

375
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:40,394
- Just to think of her makes me feel...
- There, there, there.

376
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,938
Girls of your age
often see things that don't exist.

377
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:48,784
But it passes.

378
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:51,533
You must just
put it out of your mind.

379
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:54,546
You're a big girl now.

380
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:59,050
Soon you'll be a woman.

381
00:33:01,874 --> 00:33:04,460
You'll marry a man
and you'll have children...

382
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:07,505
just as I did.

383
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:11,826
Life goes fast...

384
00:33:14,418 --> 00:33:16,807
my child.

385
00:33:19,218 --> 00:33:21,258
It's hard to believe
how fast.

386
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:30,481
If she stays here,
I fear for her health.

387
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:35,979
She speaks to no one. She doesn't sleep.
She doesn't eat enough to keep a bird alive.

388
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,903
Bernarde, couldn't you take her
to live with you?

389
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:41,612
To walk down the the street and have everybody
point you out as the father of that idiot...

390
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:45,009
- I'm a respectable miller!
- You are also the girl's father.

391
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:47,985
And you seem to overlook the fact
that you are her mother.

392
00:33:48,082 --> 00:33:51,049
The two people in the world who should
be comforting and understanding...

393
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:53,936
and you want to ship her off
as if she were a sack of flour.

394
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,422
- I'm thinking only...
- Only of yourself.

395
00:33:57,617 --> 00:33:59,624
Bernadette is a simple,
honest child.

396
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:02,315
She hasn't the cunning
to invent anything like this.

397
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:05,733
She sees this lady.
Nobody else does.

398
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:08,972
Who are you to say
that she is wrong and you are right?

399
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:12,814
This lady may well be
a heavenly creature.

400
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:16,775
Ahh. Heavenly creatures don't appear
in a filthy place like a city dump.

401
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:19,696
Christ was born in a stable.

402
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:23,088
This is a wild story
Bernadette tells.

403
00:34:23,216 --> 00:34:27,788
But since the Lady has asked her to go
to the grotto for 15 days, she must go.

404
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:31,020
<i>- Oh, I won't allow her to go again.
- You will go with her.</i>

405
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:33,161
You can't hide your head
in the sand...

406
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:37,039
and act as if your daughter were up to some
harmless mischief that doesn't concern you.

407
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:40,300
This is no joke. Consider
what this means to Bernadette.

408
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,222
- But what will people say?
- Nothing...

409
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,654
if you take your place
by her side.

410
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:47,786
All the women of the family
must stand by her.

411
00:34:47,888 --> 00:34:50,190
I'll come.

412
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:54,347
And when I walk with her,
let anyone dare to laugh.

413
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:29,996
<i>The matter has been
put before the council and approved.</i>

414
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:33,478
<i>So, therefore, fully convinced
that your request is justified...</i>

415
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:36,518
I am forwarding your plan,
as well as my recommendation...

416
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:39,590
- to the... to the Minister of the Interior.
- Commissioner.

417
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:42,565
Signed Baron Massy,
Prefect.

418
00:35:42,703 --> 00:35:48,038
So you see, gentlemen, the ceaseless
protestations of your mayor have borne fruit.

419
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:52,649
The highest authorities are contemplating
bringing the railroad to Lourdes.

420
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,573
<i>- Splendid.
- Magnificent.</i>

421
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:58,282
- Commissioner. That Soubirous girl went to Massabielle again.
- What is it?

422
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:01,165
- What should I do?
- I thought her mother had forbidden it?

423
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:03,336
Well, today
her mother went with her.

424
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:08,174
To think that such a thing could happen
in the middle of the 19th century.

425
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:11,270
- Oh, the girl's insane.
- Or suffering from hallucinations.

426
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:14,026
<i>Your Honor, may I suggest
that you act without delay.</i>

427
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:19,462
But, monsieur, for the mayor ever to
acknowledge the existence of such a situation...

428
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,454
would serve only
to give it importance...

429
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,681
an importance which the newspapers
would not ignore.

430
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,855
It's clearly a matter
for the imperial prosecutor.

431
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:30,853
No. Unfortunately,
the state has no charges to prefer.

432
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,780
It's up to
the commissioner of police.

433
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:37,221
No one has broken any law.
It's the duty of the district officer.

434
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:39,332
Massabielle's
in your district, isn't it?

435
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:41,642
- Yes, Commissioner.
- Then take care of it.

436
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:24,453
L...

437
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:29,835
I ran ahead to tell you
I'm not alone today.

438
00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:31,756
I hope you won't mind.

439
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:34,853
<i>Maman, Aunt Bernarde
and my sister are with me.</i>

440
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:37,324
And some other people
followed us.

441
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:40,006
<i>I'm sorry, but maman wouldn't
let me come by myself.</i>

442
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:42,476
I desire that people
should come here.

443
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:50,796
Where is she?

444
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,991
- Is she here?
- Oh, yes.

445
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:56,297
She's standing there
in the niche.

446
00:37:56,397 --> 00:37:59,779
<i>She's greeting you now.
See?</i>

447
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:38,596
Clear out down there!

448
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,253
All of you return to your homes
immediately!

449
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,573
<i>Did you hear me?
I said, "Clear out.!"</i>

450
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:51,876
This is hopeless.

451
00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:55,240
It's more than
one policeman can handle.

452
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:11,848
<i>It's a scandal.
It cries to heaven.</i>

453
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:15,690
<i>Imagine these penny-a-liners having
the audacity to print such a thing.</i>

454
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,827
All France
will be laughing at us.

455
00:39:17,931 --> 00:39:21,444
And Lourdes was going to
have a railroad connection.

456
00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:24,449
I'd even gone so far as to have
the plans drawn up for the depot.

457
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:26,726
Do you think they'll
be granted to us now?

458
00:39:28,107 --> 00:39:30,889
Never. Who's going to
run a railroad...

459
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:36,650
into a hole where spooks perform
their medieval antics in dirty cabins?

460
00:39:36,747 --> 00:39:38,689
We are dealing with
a whole lot more...

461
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:42,089
than the mere babbling
of a little swindler or an imbecile.

462
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:45,569
The entire future
of this town is at stake!

463
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:48,969
Something must be done
to stop this nonsense immediately.

464
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:51,619
- How?
- How?

465
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,545
Well, that's up to you
and the prosecutor.

466
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:56,807
As much as I'd like to put an end
to this stupidity, I am helpless.

467
00:39:56,907 --> 00:39:59,362
The child goes peacefully
to the outskirts of the city.

468
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:02,084
There she kneels,
says her rosary and goes home again.

469
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:04,161
Now, tell me,
is there anything unlawful in that?

470
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,688
Yes, on the ground
that it's, uh...

471
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,615
insulting to
religious sensibilities.

472
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:10,535
Really?

473
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:14,245
You can hardly call seeing the Blessed
Virgin in a veritable cesspool...

474
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:16,169
complimentary
to the Holy Family.

475
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:18,819
But that's just the point. She hasn't
claimed to see the Blessed Virgin.

476
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:21,769
- The crowd claims that.
- She says she sees a lady...

477
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:23,688
a beautiful lady.

478
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:25,608
And the visioning
of a beautiful lady...

479
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:28,073
can hardly be construed
as a violation of the criminal code.

480
00:40:28,202 --> 00:40:31,137
It better not be, or else
the entire male population of France...

481
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:33,216
will be spending most
of its time behind bars.

482
00:40:33,322 --> 00:40:35,144
This is hardly the moment for levity.

483
00:40:35,242 --> 00:40:37,413
Yes, yes, yes.
What is it? What is it?

484
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:44,260
Pardon me, sir,
but Dr. Dozous is here to see you.

485
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:46,751
<i>- Ask the doctor to wait.
- Just a moment.</i>

486
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,119
Dr. Dozous might be
very helpful to us.

487
00:40:50,218 --> 00:40:54,473
Let's not overlook the vast possibilities
offered by a diagnosis of insanity.

488
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,839
Yes.

489
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:59,207
- Ask the doctor to come in.
- Yes, sir.

490
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:05,856
- Will you please come in, Doctor?
- Thank you.

491
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:08,743
<i>- Doctor.
- Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

492
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,143
<i>- Bonjour.
- Ah, Doctor.</i>

493
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:13,543
I'm, uh... I'm sorry
to interrupt, gentlemen...

494
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:17,318
but I've made several visits to
Massabielle for the purpose of observation.

495
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:20,832
Today I examined the girl. I thought you
gentlemen might be interested in my report.

496
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:24,352
- Yes. Yes, of course. Won't you sit down, Doctor?
- Splendid. What did you find?

497
00:41:24,457 --> 00:41:28,450
Well, I arrived at the grotto
simultaneously with the crowd.

498
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:32,676
Immediately, the Soubirous girl knelt in
front of a niche in the side of the cliff...

499
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:38,439
made a series of courteous,
graceful, reverential gestures.

500
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:40,991
- Did you see anything in this niche?
- No.

501
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:43,552
- Did anybody else?
- N-No.

502
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:46,078
Well, then didn't
the crowd laugh at her?

503
00:41:47,912 --> 00:41:49,735
No.

504
00:41:49,832 --> 00:41:53,956
There was something about her
that precluded laughter.

505
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,247
Her exaltation...

506
00:41:58,376 --> 00:42:00,351
was so genuine...

507
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:02,399
that the observer
almost had the impression...

508
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:04,772
that he saw
what the child saw.

509
00:42:05,832 --> 00:42:07,654
Then as we continued
to gaze at her...

510
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:11,974
her face turned as pale
as white marble...

511
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:15,171
and her skin grew so taut...

512
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:18,784
that the structure of the skull
appeared clearly marked at the temples.

513
00:42:18,888 --> 00:42:20,993
<i>Considering the possibility...</i>

514
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:24,412
<i>that this was due
to cerebral anemia, I took her pulse.</i>

515
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:27,967
It was practically average. Also, there
was no affection of the nervous system...

516
00:42:28,072 --> 00:42:31,454
as in catalepsy or hysteria.

517
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,501
Even her eye reflexes
were normal.

518
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,414
Did she speak
to this thing in the niche?

519
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:40,610
Standing close beside her...

520
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:43,613
I heard twice in succession...

521
00:42:43,752 --> 00:42:46,948
a long, drawn-out...

522
00:42:47,015 --> 00:42:49,055
"Yes.

523
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:52,389
<i>Yes, "</i>

524
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,876
wrung from her very depths.

525
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:00,767
Evidently, she'd been
asked to convey a message...

526
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:03,718
because shortly after
she turned to the crowd and said...

527
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,637
"Pray for all sinners."

528
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:10,176
Anyone who talks to something
that isn't there is feebleminded.

529
00:43:10,279 --> 00:43:13,989
Another medical possibility
which I took into consideration.

530
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:17,665
Wanting to test her mental abilities,
I put this question to her:

531
00:43:17,735 --> 00:43:19,644
"Do you know
what a sinner is?"

532
00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:24,385
Without hesitation,
she answered, "Certainly, monsieur.

533
00:43:24,454 --> 00:43:27,007
A sinner
is one who loves evil."

534
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,629
That's quite a good answer.

535
00:43:30,726 --> 00:43:35,265
What pleased me was that
she said "loves" and not "does."

536
00:43:35,366 --> 00:43:39,970
Well, after this, any diagnosis of
feeblemindedness was out of the question.

537
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,241
Then she's a swindler.

538
00:43:42,342 --> 00:43:44,546
There's not the slightest justification
for such an assumption.

539
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:48,094
<i>Then I must presume, Doctor, that you
havejoined the ranks of the believers...</i>

540
00:43:48,198 --> 00:43:50,020
in this, uh, vision.

541
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:52,387
I am a doctor.

542
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:54,787
<i>I contribute
to the Medical Courrier.</i>

543
00:43:54,886 --> 00:43:59,807
I'm a member of... several scientific
societies. I trust that is answer enough.

544
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:03,586
If I have correctly understood
your report, Doctor, it is this:

545
00:44:03,686 --> 00:44:05,628
Science excludes fraud.

546
00:44:05,734 --> 00:44:09,443
It excludes mental disease
and a miraculous occurrence.

547
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:13,055
I venture then
to ask science, what is left?

548
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:18,302
<i>Yes. What is left?</i>

549
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,605
If the Church stops it,
the people cannot blame us.

550
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:29,280
Precisely. We can sit back
and sympathize with both sides.

551
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:31,836
A very wise attitude
for any government.

552
00:44:31,941 --> 00:44:33,850
- Is the dean at home?
- Yes, monsieur.

553
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:36,161
- Ah. Good morning, gentlemen.
- Ah. Good morning, Father.

554
00:44:36,261 --> 00:44:38,879
Good morning. Come in.

555
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:41,436
- Take off your coats.
- Thank you.

556
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:44,126
I presume the Soubirous girl
is what brings you here.

557
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:47,011
- Yes.
- I want you to know...

558
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:50,240
that the Church attributes
no religious significance whatsoever...

559
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:52,762
to the so-called
visions of Massabielle.

560
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:55,290
- Sit down.
- I'm very glad to hear that, Father.

561
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:59,041
- Then you will talk to this girl and you...
- No.

562
00:44:59,141 --> 00:45:01,028
It does not concern me.

563
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:05,059
That is a matter
for you city officials.

564
00:45:05,157 --> 00:45:07,458
We had hoped
you would cooperate with us.

565
00:45:07,557 --> 00:45:10,045
That I am doing.
Sit down.

566
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:15,324
I have instructed the cantonal clergy
not to set foot in the grotto...

567
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:17,534
and to ignore
the whole matter.

568
00:45:17,636 --> 00:45:20,538
But Your Reverence
has enormous power over the people here.

569
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,043
Wouldn't it be appropriate
for you to raise your voice?

570
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:26,041
I have no intention of adding
further importance to this turmoil.

571
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,547
Then you force the state
to invoke the law...

572
00:45:28,677 --> 00:45:32,092
which prohibits the Church
from opening any new place of worship...

573
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,978
without the formal consent
of the minister of worship.

574
00:45:35,076 --> 00:45:37,694
The Church has not opened
any new place of worship.

575
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,375
<i>The Church neither sponsors
nor recognizes...</i>

576
00:45:41,476 --> 00:45:44,225
these daily heathen gymnastics
which take place at Massabielle.

577
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,331
But how can you stand by...

578
00:45:46,436 --> 00:45:49,119
and see your parishioners
carry on these...

579
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,292
these pagan ceremonies?

580
00:45:51,396 --> 00:45:55,138
I understand that they use
a kitchen table as an altar.

581
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:57,058
And there they pray.

582
00:45:57,156 --> 00:46:01,084
Yes, on a spot littered with filth,
they pray to God.

583
00:46:01,188 --> 00:46:04,417
Prayer, gentlemen,
is good no matter where it is offered.

584
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:07,619
Yes, yes.

585
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:13,560
Well, shall we be going?

586
00:46:26,276 --> 00:46:28,642
- Thank you, Father.
- Sure.

587
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:31,291
- Have a pleasant good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Father.

588
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:34,306
Good morning.

589
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:39,930
That sly old fox.
By agreeing with us...

590
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:43,613
he's dumped the entire problem
right back in our laps.

591
00:46:43,714 --> 00:46:46,267
Unfortunately,
the followers of the girl...

592
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:48,673
are citizens
of this community.

593
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:51,869
The thought of offending them
is not very pleasant.

594
00:46:51,971 --> 00:46:54,589
- Especially with the election coming up.
- Well, then why offend them?

595
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,789
Why not refer the matter
to higher authorities?

596
00:46:57,891 --> 00:47:00,127
A very good suggestion,
monsieur.

597
00:47:00,227 --> 00:47:02,267
I'll write to the prefect
immediately.

598
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,960
"I consider it purely
a local problem...

599
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,906
"to be solved
by local authorities...

600
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:16,640
"and I do not wish to be
involved in any way whatsoever.

601
00:47:16,738 --> 00:47:19,040
"Settle it without delay.

602
00:47:19,138 --> 00:47:22,880
"The method I leave entirely
in the capable hands...

603
00:47:22,978 --> 00:47:24,952
of you and your associates."

604
00:47:25,058 --> 00:47:27,905
Signed, Baron Massy, Prefect.

605
00:47:29,058 --> 00:47:31,033
There he sits, like a general...

606
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:33,440
safely out of the range
of fire...

607
00:47:33,538 --> 00:47:36,636
and orders a handful of men
without any weapons...

608
00:47:36,738 --> 00:47:38,745
to wipe out
an impregnable fortress.

609
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,119
"Our capable hands."

610
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:43,934
They're only capable
when there's a ticklish job to be done.

611
00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:47,809
To think that one stupid girl
could cause all this trouble!

612
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:51,648
Only because there are millions
of others just as stupid as she is.

613
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:55,520
What can you expect from a peasantry
fed on religious dogmas...

614
00:47:55,617 --> 00:47:57,919
and nurtured on
superstitious nonsense?

615
00:47:58,018 --> 00:48:03,200
I firmly believe that this girl and what
she stands for is a menace to civilization.

616
00:48:04,353 --> 00:48:06,175
The girl is dangerous,
I admit, but...

617
00:48:06,273 --> 00:48:08,095
<i>She's a religious fanatic...</i>

618
00:48:08,193 --> 00:48:10,648
and every time
religious fanaticism steps forward...

619
00:48:10,753 --> 00:48:12,576
mankind moves backward.

620
00:48:12,673 --> 00:48:15,040
And that is why
I will fight this vigorously...

621
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:17,723
and I'll resort to any measures
to defeat it.

622
00:48:17,825 --> 00:48:21,240
I don't know much
about higher politics...

623
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:26,080
but I do know a lot about burglars
and thieves and scamps of all kinds.

624
00:48:26,176 --> 00:48:29,722
I know how to scare them
and apply pressure.

625
00:48:29,857 --> 00:48:33,752
I promise you that if you give me
five minutes with this girl...

626
00:48:33,856 --> 00:48:36,125
she'll never
go near the grotto again.

627
00:48:36,225 --> 00:48:39,040
Try it, by all means!
Try anything!

628
00:48:39,137 --> 00:48:41,820
I was thinking of somewhat
the same procedure.

629
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:44,125
However, not quite so crude.

630
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:47,006
There's something
about the title "Imperial Prosecutor"...

631
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:48,925
that makes people quake.

632
00:48:49,057 --> 00:48:50,966
Without so much
as raising my voice...

633
00:48:51,073 --> 00:48:52,982
- I am confiden...
- You can't handle people like this...

634
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:54,976
with silk gloves
and fancy words.

635
00:48:55,073 --> 00:48:57,756
We shall see. Send for
two of your policemen.

636
00:49:01,248 --> 00:49:03,070
- Just the one.
- Bernadette.

637
00:49:03,168 --> 00:49:05,688
<i>You stay here, Marie,
and wait for maman to come home.</i>

638
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:09,053
Don't worry her. Just tell her I've gone
to city hall with these gentlemen.

639
00:49:14,816 --> 00:49:16,638
What are you
arresting her for?

640
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:19,070
- Don't interfere with the law.
- The law?

641
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:21,372
- That to the law! That for you too!
- Bah!

642
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:24,090
- Madame Davan! Madame Davan!
- Madame Davan!

643
00:49:24,192 --> 00:49:26,014
They're arresting Bernadette!

644
00:49:26,112 --> 00:49:30,072
Madame Probert! Madame Probert!
Look what those pigs are doing!

645
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:49,693
- Do you know who I am?
- Oh, yes, monsieur.

646
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:51,766
You're the imperial prosecutor.

647
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:56,093
And that title means that I have been
appointed by His Majesty the emperor.

648
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,182
He has vested in me
the power to punish...

649
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:04,411
anyone who perpetrates a fraud
against this community.

650
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:06,333
Now do you understand
my position?

651
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:10,325
Oh, yes. You're much the same
as MonsieurJacomet.

652
00:50:10,431 --> 00:50:13,780
A good deal more.
I am his superior officer.

653
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,302
He hunts down the criminals
and swindlers. I send them to prison.

654
00:50:17,407 --> 00:50:20,189
<i>- Oh.
- Now, bearing in mind my title...</i>

655
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:23,702
and realizing the extent
of my authority...

656
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:26,741
I ask you never again
to go to Massabielle.

657
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,315
Oh, but I must, monsieur.
The Lady has asked me.

658
00:50:31,423 --> 00:50:33,943
Now there you go again
with this "lady."

659
00:50:34,047 --> 00:50:36,502
Bernadette, you'll admit
you are very ignorant...

660
00:50:36,606 --> 00:50:38,429
the worst pupil
in the whole school?

661
00:50:38,526 --> 00:50:42,007
That is true, monsieur.
I'm very stupid.

662
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:45,144
Then you should take heed
when intelligent people assure you...

663
00:50:45,246 --> 00:50:49,719
that this lady is only a childish
bit of imagination, an absurd dream.

664
00:50:49,822 --> 00:50:54,012
The first time I saw the Lady,
I thought it was a dream too.

665
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:56,980
<i>There now.
Now that wasn't so stupid.</i>

666
00:50:57,086 --> 00:51:00,403
Once you can mistake a dream
for something real...

667
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,332
but not six times.

668
00:51:02,366 --> 00:51:07,865
Isn't it strange that until your first visit
to Massabielle, your family was destitute?

669
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:12,886
Now your mother is employed by a wealthy
family, and your father has a steady job.

670
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:18,140
<i>And your followers have showered your
household with clothing and foodstuffs.!</i>

671
00:51:18,238 --> 00:51:23,802
If the court were to decide that your lady
represents a profitable business scheme...

672
00:51:23,902 --> 00:51:26,455
it would go very hard
with you.

673
00:51:26,557 --> 00:51:31,860
I have not accepted one thing, monsieur,
because I knew the Lady would not like it.

674
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:37,013
Look, my child,
I am trying to help you.

675
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:41,307
He's using the wrong technique.
He'll get nowhere.

676
00:51:41,405 --> 00:51:43,576
<i>I am not asking you
to retract anything.</i>

677
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:46,809
I merely want you to promise me
that you will accept my counsel.

678
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,968
<i>- If I can, monsieur, I will.
- Good. Now.</i>

679
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:54,746
Put your hand in mine...

680
00:51:54,844 --> 00:51:58,390
and promise me that you
will not go to the grotto again.

681
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,591
That I cannot promise, monsieur.

682
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:04,857
Let me remind you that I am
the imperial prosecutor.

683
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:07,509
I know, monsieur.
You told me that before.

684
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:09,500
Now listen, carefully, Bernadette.

685
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:14,005
In the next room is Jacomet.
He is cruel and mean.

686
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:17,785
Furthermore, he believes that everyone
should be treated like a criminal.

687
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:21,496
<i>If you refuse me, I will be forced
to turn you over to him.</i>

688
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,571
I can promise you
it will be horrible.

689
00:52:23,677 --> 00:52:26,808
He will have you cringing
and crying in no time.

690
00:52:26,908 --> 00:52:30,225
But I can spare you all this
if you will only be reasonable.

691
00:52:31,932 --> 00:52:35,096
Well, what is your answer?

692
00:52:35,196 --> 00:52:37,498
It is the same, monsieur.

693
00:52:37,596 --> 00:52:39,865
I must keep my promise
to the Lady.

694
00:52:39,964 --> 00:52:41,818
Very well!

695
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,275
I'm finished with you.

696
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:49,627
If you're intent upon
your own destruction, go.

697
00:52:49,724 --> 00:52:51,796
Yes, monsieur.

698
00:53:00,796 --> 00:53:02,650
What's your name?

699
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:05,236
But you know my name, monsieur.

700
00:53:05,372 --> 00:53:08,721
- What's your name!
- Soubirous, Bernadette.

701
00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:13,114
Before I go further...

702
00:53:13,211 --> 00:53:15,797
I want you to know
I will write down everything you say.

703
00:53:15,932 --> 00:53:18,353
<i>Such a paper is known
as a deposition.</i>

704
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,849
<i>It will be sent to the
imperial prefect at Tarbes.</i>

705
00:53:20,955 --> 00:53:24,217
Besides, we also have
Monsieur Estrade for a witness.

706
00:53:24,316 --> 00:53:27,414
You be very careful
what you say.

707
00:53:27,515 --> 00:53:31,573
Now, about this lady
you claim to see.

708
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,497
Do you know who she is?

709
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:36,246
No, monsieur, I don't.

710
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:38,584
What does she wear?

711
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:42,577
A white veil
with a blue girdle.

712
00:53:42,683 --> 00:53:44,788
And there's a rose
on each foot.

713
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,713
Hmm.

714
00:53:47,963 --> 00:53:50,713
She stands quite still
like a statue in church?

715
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,363
Oh, no!
She's ever so natural.

716
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:55,856
She moves about
and talks to me.

717
00:53:55,962 --> 00:53:58,580
She greets the people,
and even laughs.

718
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:02,937
Hmm. Do your parents believe
this story of yours?

719
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:06,962
No, monsieur.
I don't think they do.

720
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:10,744
And yet you expect me to believe
when your own parents don't?

721
00:54:10,843 --> 00:54:13,974
If your lady were real,
wouldn't other people see her too?

722
00:54:14,074 --> 00:54:17,751
I don't see why they can't.
She's there.

723
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,612
Now pay attention.

724
00:54:22,714 --> 00:54:25,202
I'm going to
read your answers back to you...

725
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:28,176
so you can confirm
their correctness.

726
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:33,684
"Bernadette Soubirous declares the Lady
wears a blue veil and white girdle."

727
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:36,307
No, a white veil
and a blue girdle.

728
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:39,192
You're contradicting yourself!
You said a white girdle!

729
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:42,159
You must've made a mistake
in writing it down, monsieur.

730
00:54:45,466 --> 00:54:48,183
"Bernadette Soubirous declares
the Lady resembles...

731
00:54:48,282 --> 00:54:50,835
the statue of the Blessed Virgin
in the parish church."

732
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,174
No, that's not true.

733
00:54:53,274 --> 00:54:56,307
The Lady has nothing to do
with the Blessed Virgin in the Church.

734
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,850
That's enough. Nothing but
a complete confession can save you now.

735
00:55:00,953 --> 00:55:03,375
Tell me the names of all persons
who are in league with you.

736
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:06,165
And don't try to lie,
because I know every one of them.

737
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:08,502
I don't understand
what you're saying, monsieur.

738
00:55:08,602 --> 00:55:10,456
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

739
00:55:10,553 --> 00:55:14,198
Certain persons have put you up
to circulating this disgusting story.

740
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:18,999
They've trained you, stupid as you are, to reel
off by rote exactly what they taught you.

741
00:55:19,097 --> 00:55:21,202
Now tell me...
Who are these people?

742
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:24,687
But you said a moment ago,
monsieur, you knew them.

743
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:33,296
The police are outside,
waiting my orders to take you to jail.

744
00:55:33,401 --> 00:55:37,557
But if you promise before this witness that
you will never set foot in Massabielle again...

745
00:55:37,657 --> 00:55:40,079
No. I must keep my promise
to the Lady.

746
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:43,087
You want me to call
the police?

747
00:55:43,193 --> 00:55:45,527
If the police take me,
I can't help it.

748
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:49,399
And that's not all. I'll have your
mother and father thrown into jail too.

749
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:51,950
<i>The rest of your family will starve.</i>

750
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,966
Come in!

751
00:55:54,073 --> 00:55:56,691
What the devil do you want?

752
00:55:56,793 --> 00:56:00,054
My child.
That's all I want. My child.

753
00:56:00,152 --> 00:56:04,756
Listen, Soubirous, this business at the grotto
has got to stop. I won't stand it any longer.

754
00:56:04,889 --> 00:56:08,849
So help me God, Commissioner, that's all
I want too. It's destroying my family.

755
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:11,570
The girl's a minor.
You're responsible for her.

756
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:14,868
Forbid her to go out except to school.
Lock her up at home if you have to...

757
00:56:14,968 --> 00:56:18,197
because if you don't,
I'll lock up the whole bunch of you.

758
00:56:18,296 --> 00:56:20,717
Now, get out!

759
00:56:20,824 --> 00:56:23,955
God help you if I have
to summon you again.

760
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,156
Well, monsieur,
what do you think of it?

761
00:56:34,263 --> 00:56:36,435
I think you were
extremely fortunate...

762
00:56:36,535 --> 00:56:39,219
in having the father break in
just when he did.

763
00:56:41,112 --> 00:56:44,014
<i>The fact that the authorities have
prevented her going from Massabielle...</i>

764
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:47,185
has served to make her seem more
important in the eyes of her schoolmates.

765
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:50,582
- That is most unfortunate.
- The children gather and whisper about nothing else.

766
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:52,751
I'd hoped, with your permission,
to talk to them and...

767
00:56:52,855 --> 00:56:57,427
No. The Bishop ofTarbes has forbidden
us even to recognize the situation.

768
00:56:57,527 --> 00:56:59,469
And he's right in doing so.

769
00:56:59,575 --> 00:57:03,317
Do you remember that girl
in Avignon? Rose Tamessiet?

770
00:57:03,447 --> 00:57:06,513
She claimed to have seen
the Most Blessed Virgin also.

771
00:57:06,615 --> 00:57:10,128
The Vicar General of that diocese
was patient and understanding.

772
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:13,613
Consequently, the people
mistook his attitude for approbation.

773
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:16,533
Then later, when the child
was exposed as a fraud...

774
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:19,479
the Church was looked upon
as her partner in crime.

775
00:57:19,574 --> 00:57:23,982
Immediately, atheism flared up,
and the anticlerical forces triumphed.

776
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:26,356
That is not going
to happen here.

777
00:57:26,454 --> 00:57:30,000
What I had in mind, Father,
could hardly be construed as approbation.

778
00:57:30,103 --> 00:57:33,005
I had planned to make an example
of this child in front of the class.

779
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,315
- Ridicule?
- Yes, Father.

780
00:57:35,415 --> 00:57:38,098
You have my permission
to try it. Good day, Sister.

781
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:40,304
Good day, Father.
Thank you.

782
00:58:20,086 --> 00:58:22,835
She can't go on like this.

783
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:26,766
Night after night.

784
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:38,099
My poor little one.
What have they done to you?

785
00:58:39,605 --> 00:58:41,994
Speak to me.

786
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:47,764
If I can't go see her anymore,
I shall die.

787
00:58:51,957 --> 00:58:54,062
You shall see her.

788
00:58:54,165 --> 00:58:56,652
I don't care
what Sister Vauzous says.

789
00:58:56,757 --> 00:59:01,197
You'll go again to Massabielle,
and no one will prevent you.

790
00:59:01,301 --> 00:59:05,457
If they lock me up,
well, let 'em.

791
00:59:05,557 --> 00:59:08,012
But you shall see her.

792
00:59:18,901 --> 00:59:22,349
I hope Baron Massy
subscribes to this paper.

793
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:25,616
Sounds a little different
from the last editorial, doesn't it?

794
00:59:25,717 --> 00:59:28,651
Listen to this.
"The officials at Lourdes...

795
00:59:28,757 --> 00:59:33,067
are to be highly commended for stamping
out these disgusting spectacles."

796
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:37,994
- But I have a feeling they will return to criticism again tomorrow.
- What makes you think that?

797
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:42,323
Because I am a man of greater vision
than you, Monsieur Le Mayor.

798
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,610
Especially when I sit
in this particular chair.

799
00:59:58,548 --> 01:00:00,555
I told them,
if they did this again...

800
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,482
I'd put every one of them
in jail.

801
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:06,857
Careful, Commissioner. If you do that,
I'll have to release them in ten minutes.

802
01:00:06,963 --> 01:00:10,705
- Then we would look foolish, wouldn't we?
- There must be some law to stop them.

803
01:00:12,627 --> 01:00:15,889
- Commissioner...
- I know. They're going to Massabielle.

804
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:18,126
You don't have to tell me.
I've got eyes. I can see.

805
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:20,432
- No, they're not going to Massabielle.
- They're not?

806
01:00:20,531 --> 01:00:22,768
They've already been.
They were there at 5:00 this morning.

807
01:00:22,868 --> 01:00:24,722
They're on their way now
to the dean.

808
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:26,412
The dean?

809
01:00:26,515 --> 01:00:29,515
Yes. The girl said the Lady
gave her a message for him.

810
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:32,968
Well, it seems the gods
have finally sided with us.

811
01:00:33,075 --> 01:00:38,313
Gentlemen, maybe now the Church will be forced
to take a stand whether it wants to or not.

812
01:01:09,043 --> 01:01:12,359
- Excuse me, Your Reverence.
- What do you want? Who are you?

813
01:01:12,466 --> 01:01:14,768
- Bernadette Soubirous.
- Oh.

814
01:01:14,834 --> 01:01:18,631
So you're the urchin
every idiot in France is talking about.

815
01:01:18,738 --> 01:01:21,640
Do your courtiers and
servants always follow you?

816
01:01:21,746 --> 01:01:25,772
If any of that crowd dare to enter
my garden, I'll have them arrested.

817
01:01:25,874 --> 01:01:27,762
Well, speak.
What do you want of me?

818
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:30,541
<i>- The Lady told me...
- What lady?</i>

819
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:32,464
The Lady in Massabielle.

820
01:01:32,562 --> 01:01:35,857
- Don't know her.
- She's a beautiful lady who always comes to me.

821
01:01:35,954 --> 01:01:38,026
- Is she from Lourdes?
- No, Your Reverence.

822
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:41,425
- Have you asked her name?
- Yes, but she gives no answer.

823
01:01:41,522 --> 01:01:45,351
- Perhaps the lady is deaf and dumb.
- Oh, no, she speaks to me.

824
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:47,280
What does she say?

825
01:01:47,378 --> 01:01:50,727
Just now the Lady said,
"Please go to the priests...

826
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:52,973
and tell them a chapel
is to be built here."

827
01:01:53,073 --> 01:01:55,081
Priests?
What does that mean?

828
01:01:55,153 --> 01:01:57,706
It appears your lady
is a confirmed heathen.

829
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:02,414
The very cannibals have priests. We Catholics
have religious, each bearing a specific title.

830
01:02:02,513 --> 01:02:05,448
But the Lady did say priests.

831
01:02:07,154 --> 01:02:11,888
Well, you've come
to the wrong place anyhow.

832
01:02:11,985 --> 01:02:15,847
- Have you any money with which to build a chapel?
- No, I have no money at all.

833
01:02:15,953 --> 01:02:20,109
Then you go back and tell your lady if she
wants a chapel, she'll have to provide the money.

834
01:02:20,209 --> 01:02:23,373
- Yes, Your Reverence.
- And you can also tell her, the Dean of Lourdes...

835
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:26,822
doesn't consider it very fitting
for a lady to climb barefoot on rocks...

836
01:02:26,961 --> 01:02:29,514
and to send gibbering
adolescents with messages.

837
01:02:29,617 --> 01:02:33,446
And what's more, once and for all,
he demands she leave him in peace.

838
01:02:33,553 --> 01:02:36,520
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Reverence. I'll tell her...

839
01:02:36,624 --> 01:02:39,112
Just one moment.

840
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:43,911
- Do you see this broom?
- Yes, Your Reverence.

841
01:02:44,017 --> 01:02:45,839
Then listen carefully.

842
01:02:45,937 --> 01:02:48,806
If you dare to annoy me
ever again...

843
01:02:48,912 --> 01:02:52,557
I'll take this broom,
and with my own hands, I'll...

844
01:03:09,457 --> 01:03:11,344
<i>Come in.</i>

845
01:03:16,304 --> 01:03:18,726
<i>I forgot something,
Your Reverence.</i>

846
01:03:18,832 --> 01:03:23,404
The Lady also said,
"Let processions come hither."

847
01:03:23,472 --> 01:03:26,538
Processions, eh?

848
01:03:31,504 --> 01:03:34,286
And do you think tomorrow
would be soon enough for your lady?

849
01:03:34,384 --> 01:03:37,645
Oh, yes, I'm sure
she would be delighted!

850
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,829
<i>- Now that I've given you the messages, I'll...
- One moment.</i>

851
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:47,911
I'll decide
when you're to go.

852
01:03:49,168 --> 01:03:50,990
<i>Close the door.</i>

853
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,425
I want you to convey a message
to your lady for me.

854
01:04:04,528 --> 01:04:06,350
Yes, Your Reverence.

855
01:04:09,903 --> 01:04:12,521
You find her quite
extraordinary, don't you?

856
01:04:12,623 --> 01:04:14,827
Oh, yes, Your Reverence!

857
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,445
Good.

858
01:04:26,543 --> 01:04:30,471
We shall find
how extraordinary she is.

859
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:35,430
I have heard that there is a wild rosebush
growing in the grotto. Is that true?

860
01:04:35,566 --> 01:04:39,822
Oh, yes. Right under the niche
where the Lady always stands.

861
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:44,839
Splendid. I want you
to tell the lady this.

862
01:04:44,943 --> 01:04:48,969
The Dean of Lourdes would like her
to perform a little miracle.

863
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:52,169
He would like her to make
the wild rosebush bloom...

864
01:04:52,271 --> 01:04:54,954
now, this last week
in February.

865
01:04:56,078 --> 01:04:58,499
<i>- Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Reverence.</i>

866
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:01,955
Then repeat what I said.

867
01:05:02,062 --> 01:05:06,634
The Dean of Lourdes would like the Lady
to perform a little miracle.

868
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:09,451
To make
the wild rosebush bloom...

869
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:11,885
now, this last week
in February.

870
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,764
Is that correct?

871
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:17,644
Yes.

872
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:21,801
I'll tell the Lady.
Good day, Your Reverence.

873
01:05:47,149 --> 01:05:49,931
Squad, halt!

874
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:53,738
Well, gentlemen,
I'm off to see the miracle.

875
01:05:53,837 --> 01:05:57,001
Bring me back a dozen roses,
will you please?

876
01:05:57,069 --> 01:06:01,477
I rather think I'll bring you back
100 dozen disillusioned people.

877
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:04,167
The dean set no definite time.

878
01:06:04,269 --> 01:06:06,604
Why do you assume
that today's the day?

879
01:06:06,669 --> 01:06:09,036
We don't.
Her followers did that.

880
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:12,678
- It should be on Thursday, they said.
- Why Thursday?

881
01:06:12,781 --> 01:06:14,853
Because someone who had nothing
better to do figured out...

882
01:06:14,957 --> 01:06:19,910
that she first saw the Lady on a Thursday,
the Lady returned to her on a Thursday...

883
01:06:20,013 --> 01:06:23,176
so naturally the buds
shall burst on a Thursday.

884
01:06:23,276 --> 01:06:28,011
Buds or no buds, you will never
destroy that girl's faith.

885
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,312
Can you say the same
of the crowd?

886
01:06:30,412 --> 01:06:33,194
- Wouldn't we be surprised
if the bush did bloom today!

887
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:35,747
Don't underestimate
the Dean of Lourdes.

888
01:06:35,853 --> 01:06:38,886
Who is the best authority
on roses in this district?

889
01:06:38,988 --> 01:06:41,955
Peyramale.
The weather too for that matter.

890
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,883
You mean you think the dean...

891
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,810
I merely think it is singularly strange
that Peyramale, of all people...

892
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:51,397
picks a rose bush, of all things,
to demonstrate a miracle.

893
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,729
Why didn't he ask the Lady
to make the rock into a white horse...

894
01:06:54,828 --> 01:06:58,570
or change the river water
into wine?

895
01:07:14,763 --> 01:07:16,738
Anything yet?

896
01:07:16,876 --> 01:07:18,851
- No.
- Then nothing will happen.

897
01:07:18,955 --> 01:07:22,217
- Shh!
- Quiet. Keep still.

898
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:42,887
It's no use, I tell you.
The bush will not bloom.

899
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:45,835
Shh, will you keep quiet?
- All right.

900
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:50,339
But you will see.
Life is not like that.

901
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:38,560
I don't see something.
Do you?

902
01:08:48,745 --> 01:08:58,500
<i>#Santa Maria #</i>

903
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:04,068
<i>#Mater dei #</i>

904
01:09:07,466 --> 01:09:12,288
<i>Go to the spring, drink
of the water and wash there.</i>

905
01:09:22,441 --> 01:09:25,539
<i>No, not the river.</i>

906
01:09:27,721 --> 01:09:29,696
Not the river?

907
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:35,493
<i>The spring yonder.</i>

908
01:09:35,593 --> 01:09:39,237
<i>- Eat of the plants.
- Eat of the plants.</i>

909
01:09:48,233 --> 01:09:51,102
- What's she doing now?
- Shh.

910
01:09:51,209 --> 01:09:55,715
<i>Drink of the spring,
and wash there.</i>

911
01:09:55,817 --> 01:10:00,454
The spring? Drink of the water,
and wash myself?

912
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:17,576
What is she looking for?

913
01:10:32,904 --> 01:10:35,522
She uses her nose
like a pig.

914
01:10:35,624 --> 01:10:39,814
Yes! And she roots up
the ground.

915
01:10:56,904 --> 01:11:00,351
- Come, darling.
- No, I must wash myself in the spring.

916
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,692
There's no spring here,
Bernadette.

917
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:06,140
There is! There is!
The Lady said so.

918
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,921
- Citizens!
- Shh.

919
01:11:28,025 --> 01:11:32,663
At last you've seen with
your own eyes what we officials
have known all along.

920
01:11:32,761 --> 01:11:37,913
<i>That this story of the Blessed Virgin
was born in a sick and warped mind.</i>

921
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,953
<i>You've been duped by an idiot.</i>

922
01:11:40,059 --> 01:11:44,882
I beg of you. Go back to your homes
and never return here again.

923
01:12:00,832 --> 01:12:02,655
<i>Fall in.!</i>

924
01:12:36,072 --> 01:12:38,178
<i>Don't be sad, Antoine.</i>

925
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,023
<i>I told you not to hope too much.
I knew it would not bloom.</i>

926
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:48,484
<i>You must learn
to expect nothing from God.</i>

927
01:12:48,586 --> 01:12:51,435
<i>And when you get nothing,
you will not be disappointed.</i>

928
01:12:51,531 --> 01:12:53,354
Keep still.

929
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:57,031
Go away and let me alone.

930
01:13:05,102 --> 01:13:09,358
<i>From the time we are knee-high,
they tell us the Blessed Virgin
is loving and good.</i>

931
01:13:09,455 --> 01:13:11,561
<i>Was she good to that girl
just now?</i>

932
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:15,942
Was she good to me? Me, Bouriette,
the finest stone-carver in Lourdes!

933
01:13:21,138 --> 01:13:23,986
<i>I'll never forget that day.</i>

934
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:26,538
<i>I was carving a statue
for the Church.</i>

935
01:13:26,643 --> 01:13:29,873
<i>A chip of marble flew off my chisel
and hit me in the eye.</i>

936
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:33,584
And as quick as that,
I was no longer a stonecutter.

937
01:13:33,685 --> 01:13:38,836
<i>And that's how
the Blessed Virgin repaid me...
by throwing a stone in my eye.</i>

938
01:13:38,934 --> 01:13:42,677
Ever since, it's been like
looking through a bowl of milk.

939
01:14:27,745 --> 01:14:29,720
Bouriette.
Bouriette!

940
01:14:29,825 --> 01:14:32,477
<i>- What is it, Antoine?
- Come here.!</i>

941
01:14:33,985 --> 01:14:36,190
Look!

942
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:39,073
Bernadette told them there was a spring,
and they called her insane.

943
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:41,921
Look at it, Bouriette!
Look at it!

944
01:14:43,172 --> 01:14:46,653
- Tell the others. Hurry!
- Bouhouhorts! La Grange!

945
01:14:46,757 --> 01:14:49,660
Bouhouhorts! La Grange!

946
01:14:49,765 --> 01:14:52,962
Come back! Look!

947
01:14:53,062 --> 01:14:56,740
<i>#Santa Maria #</i>

948
01:14:56,839 --> 01:15:04,326
<i>#Mater dei ##</i>

949
01:15:16,972 --> 01:15:19,689
Dr. Dozous!

950
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:23,723
Where is the doctor?

951
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:28,109
Dr. Dozous.
Dr. Dozous, my eye. I can see!

952
01:15:28,205 --> 01:15:31,337
I put mud on them from the grotto,
and now I can see. It's a miracle.

953
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:34,822
- Don't be in such a hurry
with your miracles.
- It's a miracle.

954
01:15:34,927 --> 01:15:38,375
Tomorrow at 2:00,
Madame Blanche. Come here.

955
01:15:40,177 --> 01:15:42,927
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

956
01:15:43,025 --> 01:15:45,808
Fix your eye on the ceiling
and look straight ahead.

957
01:15:50,355 --> 01:15:53,738
- All I did was put mud
on them from the grotto.
- Be quiet.

958
01:15:53,843 --> 01:15:57,422
- Then I said a prayer. Now I can see.
- Quiet.

959
01:15:57,524 --> 01:16:01,616
- It's a miracle, Doctor. It's a miracle!
- Be still.

960
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:07,379
There's no improvement
in this eye, Bouriette.

961
01:16:07,478 --> 01:16:10,348
Four scars on the cornea.

962
01:16:10,455 --> 01:16:14,285
- Same as it was six months ago.
- But I can see!

963
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:17,971
<i>It's like sheet lightning.</i>

964
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,896
Excuse me.

965
01:16:19,994 --> 01:16:23,409
<i>Doctor, everything is bright.</i>

966
01:16:23,514 --> 01:16:28,054
What you've done is pressed
against the eyeball so hard...

967
01:16:28,155 --> 01:16:31,025
you've irritated
the optic nerve.

968
01:16:32,444 --> 01:16:35,740
For a time, things will seem bright,
but that'll pass.

969
01:16:35,837 --> 01:16:37,877
- Take a look at that chart.
- Yes.

970
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:42,333
- Can you read it with your left eye?
- No, Doctor, I can't.

971
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:45,846
- How 'bout the right?
- No, no, I can't.

972
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,602
- How 'bout both eyes?
- No good, Doctor.

973
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:51,323
- There you are.
- But, Doctor, I never knew how to read.

974
01:16:51,424 --> 01:16:54,392
But I can see!
I can see you, Doctor!

975
01:16:54,497 --> 01:16:56,985
I can see everything!
It's a miracle.

976
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:01,793
- Come back tomorrow when
you're calmer, Bouriette.
- All right, but it's a miracle!

977
01:17:01,891 --> 01:17:04,958
It's a miracle!
It's a miracle!

978
01:17:10,052 --> 01:17:12,093
I understand it all now.

979
01:17:12,197 --> 01:17:14,619
Ever since that piece
of marble flew in my eye...

980
01:17:14,726 --> 01:17:17,148
she's been trying to find
a way to make it up to me.

981
01:17:17,254 --> 01:17:19,524
And at last she did.

982
01:17:19,623 --> 01:17:22,045
- Mortar.
- You can see better now, Bouriette?

983
01:17:22,151 --> 01:17:24,257
I see everything!

984
01:17:56,975 --> 01:17:59,943
- There's no hope.
- No. No.

985
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:03,365
Charles, get Louise Soubirous.
She has always saved him before.

986
01:18:03,472 --> 01:18:07,532
- She's not at home. I can't find her.
- It's too late.

987
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:10,122
It's better so.

988
01:18:10,226 --> 01:18:15,792
You don't want your child
to drag himself through life
a hopeless cripple, do you?

989
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,444
I want my child to live!

990
01:18:22,293 --> 01:18:25,610
No. No!

991
01:18:29,814 --> 01:18:31,789
Croisine.

992
01:18:33,815 --> 01:18:36,663
Croisine!
Croisine, come back!

993
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,335
- Somebody's coming.
- Who is it?

994
01:18:41,464 --> 01:18:44,182
<i>Where? I don't see anything.</i>

995
01:18:44,282 --> 01:18:47,348
Croisine.

996
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:50,233
Croisine, please.

997
01:18:52,955 --> 01:18:54,963
- Croisine, be sensible.
- Let me be.

998
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,370
Are you mad?

999
01:19:01,693 --> 01:19:04,923
Take him, Oh Lord,
or give him back to me.

1000
01:19:38,117 --> 01:19:39,939
Well, Doctor?

1001
01:19:42,214 --> 01:19:44,898
There can be no question
of innervation.

1002
01:19:44,999 --> 01:19:49,986
I can find no reason to doubt
the presence of muscular substance.

1003
01:19:50,088 --> 01:19:52,642
What does that mean, Doctor?

1004
01:19:52,745 --> 01:19:57,252
That means that yesterday the baby's
legs were completely paralyzed.

1005
01:19:57,354 --> 01:20:00,202
And today,
they're as sound as yours.

1006
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:04,613
I'm sure you can understand now
my anxiety...

1007
01:20:04,715 --> 01:20:07,050
<i>for confirmation
of my findings.</i>

1008
01:20:07,148 --> 01:20:12,234
<i>You're positive there's not
a possibility of error
in your previous diagnosis?</i>

1009
01:20:13,293 --> 01:20:15,115
"August 25.

1010
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:20,518
"High temperature,
violent convulsions...

1011
01:20:20,622 --> 01:20:23,012
complete paralysis
of the legs."

1012
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:28,106
- Couldn't we assume a
mere atrophy due to rickets?
- I couldn't.

1013
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:30,031
Then the water
at Massabielle must contain...

1014
01:20:30,161 --> 01:20:34,090
an unknown and powerful
therapeutic substance.

1015
01:20:34,194 --> 01:20:37,610
At any rate, I must report on this case
to the medical journals.

1016
01:20:37,714 --> 01:20:40,748
Mmm, I'd hesitate
to do that.

1017
01:20:40,851 --> 01:20:43,569
It might make you
an object of ridicule.

1018
01:20:43,667 --> 01:20:46,254
It won't be an easy thing
to write.

1019
01:20:46,356 --> 01:20:50,514
I'm not accustomed
to believing things I can't see.

1020
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:53,614
What about you, Father?
You've been very silent.

1021
01:20:53,718 --> 01:20:56,784
<i>What do you make
of all this?</i>

1022
01:20:56,887 --> 01:20:58,829
Unlike a doctor...

1023
01:20:58,935 --> 01:21:03,442
a religious must believe
a great many things he cannot see.

1024
01:21:03,544 --> 01:21:07,091
Sometimes, I confess,
it's extremely difficult.

1025
01:21:08,345 --> 01:21:11,761
Last night when I came here,
it was very dark.

1026
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:14,070
It's much lighter now.

1027
01:21:14,171 --> 01:21:16,026
Good morning, gentlemen.

1028
01:21:29,182 --> 01:21:31,932
<i>And no longer
are his legs like dishrags.</i>

1029
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:34,584
Now they're
firm and strong.

1030
01:21:34,687 --> 01:21:38,649
And without Bernadette,
it couldn't have been!

1031
01:21:38,752 --> 01:21:42,397
- Let me say a prayer by her bedside.
- Heavenly Father, no!

1032
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:45,880
Save your prayers for mass.
Now go home to your wife.

1033
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:47,928
Tonight you will all
have dinner with us.

1034
01:21:48,034 --> 01:21:51,450
We will have an omelette
ten-feet wide!

1035
01:22:01,093 --> 01:22:02,915
<i>Good morning, maman.!</i>

1036
01:22:03,013 --> 01:22:04,508
<i>Good morning, Papa.</i>

1037
01:22:07,335 --> 01:22:09,157
Morning, Bernadette.

1038
01:22:09,255 --> 01:22:11,427
Good morning,
Bernadette.

1039
01:22:42,414 --> 01:22:45,033
Then she held him
in that ice-cold water...

1040
01:22:45,135 --> 01:22:48,202
and all of a sudden,
the baby began to cry.

1041
01:22:48,303 --> 01:22:51,752
Not a weak, sickly cry,
but a healthy one.

1042
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:55,173
And both doctors agree
a great change took place.

1043
01:22:55,281 --> 01:22:58,129
They confess
they can't understand it.

1044
01:22:58,226 --> 01:23:00,877
It's left them wondering.

1045
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:03,434
What do you think of it,
Father?

1046
01:23:03,539 --> 01:23:06,889
I too am wondering.

1047
01:23:06,995 --> 01:23:10,706
Do you know, the baby
was never strong enough to cry before.

1048
01:23:10,805 --> 01:23:14,154
Then on the way home, the child
went to sleep in his mother's arms.

1049
01:23:14,229 --> 01:23:16,499
When he woke up,
he was smiling and hungry.

1050
01:23:16,597 --> 01:23:18,321
He was moving his legs.

1051
01:23:18,422 --> 01:23:21,739
<i>Almost since he was born,
his legs were as if they had no muscles.</i>

1052
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,808
- Oh.
- This is awful.

1053
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:08,736
Yes, Commissioner.

1054
01:24:08,834 --> 01:24:12,861
At sunrise, that whole hillside
will look like a sugar loaf
crawling with ants.

1055
01:24:12,962 --> 01:24:15,384
- It won't be so bad after tomorrow.
- Why?

1056
01:24:15,491 --> 01:24:20,194
The Lady only asked her to come
for 15 times. Tomorrow makes 15.

1057
01:24:20,292 --> 01:24:24,002
This is no longer a curiosity.
It's a disease! This crowd
will come if she's here or not.

1058
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,622
- Where do you think you are going?
- No place, monsieur.

1059
01:24:26,726 --> 01:24:29,574
- What have you got in that basket?
- My wife is very sick.

1060
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:33,183
- You've got your wife in the basket?
- No, monsieur, l...

1061
01:24:33,287 --> 01:24:36,484
I thought maybe I could sell
some hot chestnuts and wine.

1062
01:24:36,584 --> 01:24:38,406
There you are!
Now it's started.

1063
01:24:38,504 --> 01:24:40,643
Pretty soon
they'll be selling sausages.

1064
01:24:40,777 --> 01:24:44,487
You want sausage?
I've got sausage too.

1065
01:24:44,618 --> 01:24:46,658
Go. Go on.
Move.

1066
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:43,247
<i>#Santa Maria #</i>

1067
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:50,673
<i>#Mater dei #</i>

1068
01:25:50,744 --> 01:25:57,368
<i>#Santa Maria #</i>

1069
01:25:57,465 --> 01:26:02,355
<i>#Mater dei ##</i>

1070
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:16,054
Who is this Lady?
She must have a name.

1071
01:26:16,157 --> 01:26:18,362
Didn't you ask her
her name?

1072
01:26:18,462 --> 01:26:21,911
- I've told you to time and time again.
- Now it's too late.

1073
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:24,404
I did ask her today.

1074
01:26:24,511 --> 01:26:28,790
- Well?
- What she said I didn't understand.

1075
01:26:28,896 --> 01:26:32,126
- Speak. What was it?
- You haven't forgotten?

1076
01:26:32,225 --> 01:26:35,771
No, I repeated it many times,
so I wouldn't forget.

1077
01:26:35,874 --> 01:26:40,447
She said, "I am
the Immaculate Conception."

1078
01:26:45,092 --> 01:26:47,908
Immaculate Conception?

1079
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:51,452
Immaculate Conception.

1080
01:26:51,558 --> 01:26:56,032
Do you know what it means, "I am
the Immaculate Conception"?

1081
01:26:57,127 --> 01:26:59,070
Don't be afraid, my child.

1082
01:26:59,175 --> 01:27:02,471
I sent for you to help you,
not to scold you.

1083
01:27:03,528 --> 01:27:06,278
Well?

1084
01:27:06,377 --> 01:27:11,200
No, Your Reverence.
I do not know what it means.

1085
01:27:11,306 --> 01:27:13,445
Do you know the meaning
of the word "immaculate"?

1086
01:27:13,547 --> 01:27:17,988
Yes, I know that.
An immaculate thing is clean.

1087
01:27:18,092 --> 01:27:20,001
Good.
And "conception"?

1088
01:27:20,108 --> 01:27:23,108
Well, we'll leave that
for the moment.

1089
01:27:24,557 --> 01:27:27,372
Do you know what we mean
when we speak of the Original Sin?

1090
01:27:29,133 --> 01:27:34,405
Yes. The Original Sin
was committed by Adam and Eve...

1091
01:27:34,511 --> 01:27:38,287
when they did not remain
faithful to God, but broke His command.

1092
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:41,417
Father Pomian
taught you that, didn't he?

1093
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,659
Now, think hard.

1094
01:27:43,761 --> 01:27:46,696
Didn't he also speak
of the Immaculate Conception?

1095
01:27:46,802 --> 01:27:49,169
No, Father,
I never mentioned that dogma.

1096
01:27:49,266 --> 01:27:52,977
It doesn't belong to the pedagogic
material of the elementary class.

1097
01:27:53,076 --> 01:27:56,938
- Perhaps Sister Vauzous discussed it.
- I'm sure she didn't.

1098
01:27:58,292 --> 01:28:01,075
You must've heard
the expression somewhere.

1099
01:28:01,173 --> 01:28:03,562
Now try to remember.

1100
01:28:06,871 --> 01:28:09,260
Maybe I've heard
about it...

1101
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,254
but I don't remember.

1102
01:28:12,311 --> 01:28:15,727
Very well.
I'll try to explain it.

1103
01:28:18,425 --> 01:28:21,360
The Most Blessed
Virgin Mary...

1104
01:28:21,466 --> 01:28:25,525
was preserved free from
all stain of Original Sin.

1105
01:28:25,626 --> 01:28:30,329
Even from the first instant
of her presence in her mother's womb.

1106
01:28:30,427 --> 01:28:34,683
God did this for her because she was
to be the mother ofJesus Christ...

1107
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:38,676
the most singular
privilege of grace.

1108
01:28:39,901 --> 01:28:43,219
Do you understand that,
Bernadette?

1109
01:28:43,326 --> 01:28:45,596
No, Your Reverence.

1110
01:28:45,694 --> 01:28:48,248
Why should you?

1111
01:28:48,352 --> 01:28:51,931
Great scholars have wracked
their brains about it for centuries.

1112
01:28:53,472 --> 01:28:56,855
But perhaps you can grasp
this one thing.

1113
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:59,776
If the Most Blessed Virgin
were to speak...

1114
01:28:59,874 --> 01:29:04,250
she could not say of herself,
"I am the Immaculate Conception."

1115
01:29:04,355 --> 01:29:09,506
All she could say would be, "I am the
fruit of the Immaculate Conception."

1116
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:12,026
Birth and conception
are events...

1117
01:29:12,132 --> 01:29:14,784
but a person
is not an event.

1118
01:29:14,885 --> 01:29:20,189
You can't say, "I am
conception. I am birth."

1119
01:29:20,295 --> 01:29:24,419
Consequently, your lady is guilty
of an inexcusable blunder.

1120
01:29:24,519 --> 01:29:26,592
You must admit that.

1121
01:29:26,696 --> 01:29:30,919
So next time I see her,
I will tell her, Your Reverence.

1122
01:29:33,065 --> 01:29:36,295
- Excuse me, Father. I promised
to look in on Madame Cenac.
- Certainly.

1123
01:29:36,394 --> 01:29:39,428
- Good-bye, Bernadette.
- Good-bye, Father Pomian.

1124
01:29:46,348 --> 01:29:49,316
What am I to do with you,
Bernadette?

1125
01:29:51,117 --> 01:29:55,308
Your eyes seem honest,
your words sincere.

1126
01:29:55,406 --> 01:29:57,741
Yet I cannot believe you.

1127
01:29:57,839 --> 01:30:00,076
Today less than ever.

1128
01:30:00,176 --> 01:30:04,039
As your confessor, I beseech you,
renounce this falsehood.

1129
01:30:04,144 --> 01:30:07,757
Confess that your mother or your father
or your aunt or someone...

1130
01:30:07,857 --> 01:30:11,404
suggested that phrase that you might
become important in men's eyes.

1131
01:30:11,505 --> 01:30:15,696
But I can't confess that.
It isn't true.

1132
01:30:15,763 --> 01:30:18,545
No one suggested
anything to me.

1133
01:30:28,566 --> 01:30:33,324
Have you ever thought about your life?
What your future would be like?

1134
01:30:33,431 --> 01:30:35,985
Like the future
of all the girls hereabout.

1135
01:30:36,087 --> 01:30:39,765
After First Communion,
girls may indulge in proper pleasures.

1136
01:30:39,864 --> 01:30:43,607
They go to dances,
to festivals, meet young men.

1137
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:45,527
And after a time,
to please God...

1138
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:48,309
they marry
and have children.

1139
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:50,931
Wouldn't you like
to be such a girl?

1140
01:30:51,034 --> 01:30:55,989
Oh, yes! I'd like to go to dances,
have a husband someday.

1141
01:30:56,092 --> 01:30:57,979
Then wake up!

1142
01:30:58,076 --> 01:31:00,215
Now!

1143
01:31:00,317 --> 01:31:02,968
Otherwise life
is at an end for you.

1144
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:07,390
You are playing with fire,
Bernadette.

1145
01:31:10,751 --> 01:31:16,087
<i>- Commissioner,
that spring at the grotto...
- Yeah?</i>

1146
01:31:16,192 --> 01:31:18,942
The people are drinking
quite a bit of that water, aren't they?

1147
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:21,114
By the bucketful.

1148
01:31:21,217 --> 01:31:25,496
What they don't drink, they carry away
in pots and pans and bottles.

1149
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:29,757
Well, they're still at it.

1150
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:33,537
You thought it was bad before,
you ought to take a look at it now.

1151
01:31:33,636 --> 01:31:36,735
Sick, lame, canes, crutches.

1152
01:31:36,837 --> 01:31:38,659
Some even look like lepers.

1153
01:31:38,757 --> 01:31:42,271
<i>Listen to this, Commissioner.
"December 22, 1789.</i>

1154
01:31:42,374 --> 01:31:46,630
"All waters contained
in springs, wells, streams, rivers...

1155
01:31:46,727 --> 01:31:51,070
"or any other source whatsoever,
shall not be consumed
by anyone whosoever...

1156
01:31:51,176 --> 01:31:55,432
until the aforementioned waters
have been thoroughly analyzed
by a registered chemist."

1157
01:31:55,529 --> 01:31:57,417
That's perfect!

1158
01:31:57,514 --> 01:32:00,863
You know, I had a feeling
that somewhere in all these books...

1159
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:03,687
I'd find one old law
that would suit our purpose.

1160
01:32:03,787 --> 01:32:06,177
Shall I send my men out
to close the grotto now?

1161
01:32:06,316 --> 01:32:09,164
Not so fast, Commissioner.
First we'll take this to the mayor.

1162
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:11,333
And he will issue
a proclamation.

1163
01:32:43,635 --> 01:32:45,458
Come in.

1164
01:32:45,556 --> 01:32:48,044
<i>Ah, come in, gentlemen.!</i>

1165
01:32:48,149 --> 01:32:52,208
Thank you. I have good news.
The holocaust will spread no more.

1166
01:32:52,277 --> 01:32:54,667
- I have found a way to stop it.
- Our troubles are over.

1167
01:32:54,774 --> 01:32:59,150
And ironically enough,
it's the waters of Massabielle
that will quench this fire.

1168
01:32:59,255 --> 01:33:03,860
It's an old law. 1789.
Look there. Read it.

1169
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,066
"In the interest
of public health..."

1170
01:33:06,168 --> 01:33:08,984
Of course, with such
an important analysis...

1171
01:33:09,082 --> 01:33:11,537
we'll have to have the opinions
of many chemists.

1172
01:33:11,642 --> 01:33:15,734
And that might take
months and months and months.

1173
01:33:22,044 --> 01:33:24,117
I wonder...

1174
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:28,083
I wonder if we're not being
a little too hasty in this.

1175
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:30,427
Perhaps we're shortsighted...

1176
01:33:30,526 --> 01:33:35,382
in dismissing the possibility of
divine power in regard to Massabielle.

1177
01:33:35,487 --> 01:33:39,285
For after all, I'm sure that
you gentlemen as well as I...

1178
01:33:39,392 --> 01:33:41,465
do not want to oppose
the will of God.

1179
01:33:43,329 --> 01:33:47,291
Your sudden religious fervor
is most touching, Your Honor.

1180
01:33:47,394 --> 01:33:50,559
Could it be prompted by the fact
that the devout masses...

1181
01:33:50,658 --> 01:33:53,277
have brought with them
a wave of prosperity to Lourdes?

1182
01:33:53,379 --> 01:33:55,289
Monsieur!

1183
01:33:55,395 --> 01:33:58,844
But now that you mention it,
we shouldn't overlook that either.

1184
01:33:58,948 --> 01:34:01,764
Our hotels are filled,
our cafes are crowded...

1185
01:34:01,861 --> 01:34:04,195
and our shopkeepers
have never known such business.

1186
01:34:04,293 --> 01:34:07,360
And the railroad is sure
to take advantage of this influx
of visitors to Lourdes...

1187
01:34:07,462 --> 01:34:09,284
and extend its line here.

1188
01:34:09,382 --> 01:34:12,481
Yes, yes. And in that case
we shall need more hotels.

1189
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:14,406
But aside from all that...

1190
01:34:14,504 --> 01:34:18,247
I'm thinking mainly
of the thousands of pilgrims...

1191
01:34:18,344 --> 01:34:21,345
who come here daily
with hope in their hearts.

1192
01:34:21,481 --> 01:34:25,311
<i>If they derive any benefit
from the water at Massabielle...</i>

1193
01:34:25,418 --> 01:34:28,801
who are we
to deprive them of it?

1194
01:34:28,907 --> 01:34:33,545
Then too, think of the vast number
who cannot come to Lourdes.

1195
01:34:33,644 --> 01:34:38,827
For them, we could bottle
the miraculous water...

1196
01:34:38,925 --> 01:34:42,374
and it could be sold,
at a nominal fee, all over the world!

1197
01:34:42,478 --> 01:34:46,854
<i>Your Honor, will you dictate
the proclamation to close the grotto...</i>

1198
01:34:46,959 --> 01:34:51,116
or would you rather
that I contact Baron Massy...

1199
01:34:51,216 --> 01:34:53,322
and ask for permission
to do it myself?

1200
01:34:56,977 --> 01:34:59,661
Very well, I'll do it.

1201
01:34:59,762 --> 01:35:02,763
But I think you gentlemen
are making a big mistake.

1202
01:35:02,866 --> 01:35:05,387
Why not think it over
for a time?

1203
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:07,826
<i>Courreges, take a proclamation.</i>

1204
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,989
Oh, come in, Commissioner.
Any trouble?

1205
01:35:48,092 --> 01:35:50,646
Oh, no. We finally wiped out
this epidemic.

1206
01:35:50,749 --> 01:35:54,492
No, Commissioner. To wipe out an
epidemic you must eliminate the cause.

1207
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:58,071
I'll have the grotto patrolled night
and day. Nothing can happen now.

1208
01:35:58,175 --> 01:36:00,893
Perhaps nothing can happen
at the grotto.

1209
01:36:00,991 --> 01:36:03,839
However since the Lady is merely
a figment of Bernadette's imagination...

1210
01:36:03,936 --> 01:36:07,931
she can see her anyplace... beside the
river, in the hovel where she lives...

1211
01:36:08,033 --> 01:36:11,165
or if she wishes,
on the very steps of the city hall.

1212
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:15,806
- What?
- The next fence we build
must be around her imagination.

1213
01:36:15,907 --> 01:36:19,617
Have you ever heard
of Dr. DeBoe?

1214
01:36:19,683 --> 01:36:25,086
- Yes!
- I've just written him asking him
to come to Lourdes for a few days.

1215
01:36:32,006 --> 01:36:36,317
Just a moment. Come along. The
imperial prosecutor wants to see you.

1216
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:38,278
- You can't take her! She's done nothing!
- Come on.

1217
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:41,725
<i>I'll go, maman.
Don't worry. It won't be long.</i>

1218
01:36:41,832 --> 01:36:46,503
Why must you keep plaguing her?
She's tired and ill!

1219
01:36:46,569 --> 01:36:49,352
- Leave her alone!
- Please!

1220
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:56,033
I never felt that Dr. Dozous's
examination of the girl
was extensive enough.

1221
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:59,457
Well, after all, Dr. Dozous
is a general practitioner.

1222
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:01,637
The advances in psychiatry
have been so rapid...

1223
01:37:01,741 --> 01:37:04,709
that only a specialist could
hope to keep up with them.

1224
01:37:04,813 --> 01:37:08,611
Oh, do you think the girl
is insane, monsieur?

1225
01:37:08,718 --> 01:37:13,029
My dear Doctor, I am a great respecter
of medical science.

1226
01:37:13,135 --> 01:37:16,616
Therefore I think that as a layman,
I am not qualified to have an opinion.

1227
01:37:16,721 --> 01:37:19,372
<i>However, I do think that
the bare facts of the case...</i>

1228
01:37:19,473 --> 01:37:21,546
<i>should be permitted
to speak for themselves.</i>

1229
01:37:21,649 --> 01:37:25,163
Day after day, she stood
before a hole in a rock...

1230
01:37:25,266 --> 01:37:27,437
and conversed
with the Blessed Virgin.

1231
01:37:27,538 --> 01:37:30,572
Such delusions
are a usual symptom of paranoia.

1232
01:37:30,675 --> 01:37:33,523
I have many paranoiacs
in my clinic who claim visions...

1233
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:37,330
oftentimes followed
by a tendency towards violence.

1234
01:37:37,429 --> 01:37:39,764
Has this girl been allowed
to come and go as she pleases?

1235
01:37:39,862 --> 01:37:42,099
Well, I had planned
to put her under restraint...

1236
01:37:42,197 --> 01:37:45,514
but of course Dr. Dozous's favorable
diagnosis made that impossible.

1237
01:37:45,623 --> 01:37:47,184
<i>Tiens.!</i>

1238
01:37:47,287 --> 01:37:50,834
I trust that your examination, Doctor,
will not be a cursory one.

1239
01:37:50,904 --> 01:37:53,588
I can assure you,
it will be most extensive.

1240
01:37:53,688 --> 01:37:57,169
It may even be necessary
to place the child in an
institution under observation.

1241
01:37:57,273 --> 01:38:01,617
And unfortunately,
with paranoiacs, observation
sometimes takes a long time.

1242
01:38:01,722 --> 01:38:04,854
After all, a psychiatrist is not
an orthopedic surgeon...

1243
01:38:04,955 --> 01:38:06,995
who can set a broken bone
on the spot.

1244
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,489
Yes, yes, I understand.

1245
01:38:09,596 --> 01:38:11,833
<i>Come in.</i>

1246
01:38:21,982 --> 01:38:24,122
Eyes closed.

1247
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:29,018
<i>Now the other foot.</i>

1248
01:38:37,314 --> 01:38:39,519
Why are you so unsteady?

1249
01:38:42,115 --> 01:38:44,123
Because I'm very tired,
monsieur.

1250
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:50,909
All right.
You may sit down now.

1251
01:38:55,302 --> 01:38:58,369
- How many hours in the day?
- Twenty-four.

1252
01:38:58,471 --> 01:39:01,406
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

1253
01:39:01,511 --> 01:39:04,130
How much
is seven times five?

1254
01:39:05,384 --> 01:39:07,206
Thirty-five.

1255
01:39:07,304 --> 01:39:10,567
How much
is 17 times 18?

1256
01:39:13,354 --> 01:39:15,264
I do not know, monsieur.

1257
01:39:17,067 --> 01:39:18,889
Very well.

1258
01:39:20,843 --> 01:39:25,219
Would you know the answer, monsieur,
if you hadn't figured it out before?

1259
01:39:27,789 --> 01:39:29,612
Hmm?

1260
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:33,037
Not so fast, young lady.

1261
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:36,517
Don't bother. She'll go directly home.
We can take her from there.

1262
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:44,295
Here we are, Doctor.

1263
01:39:46,097 --> 01:39:47,920
Father Peyramale.

1264
01:39:48,018 --> 01:39:50,157
Have I the honor of addressing
the Dean of Lourdes?

1265
01:39:50,258 --> 01:39:52,527
You have that honor.
How can I serve you?

1266
01:39:52,627 --> 01:39:55,345
Hadn't we better go elsewhere
and discuss this matter?

1267
01:39:55,443 --> 01:39:59,568
It is you gentlemen who have chosen
this place of action, not I.
What do you want here?

1268
01:39:59,668 --> 01:40:03,466
I'm here on behalf
of the Medical Department of
the Provincial Administration.

1269
01:40:03,573 --> 01:40:07,764
There are evidences of definite
anomalies in this girl, Bernadette...

1270
01:40:07,862 --> 01:40:09,935
and I wish to place her
under observation.

1271
01:40:10,039 --> 01:40:13,203
I'm a professor of psychiatry
and neurology at the clinic ofTarbes.

1272
01:40:13,303 --> 01:40:16,086
<i>If the girl does not willingly
submit to this examination...</i>

1273
01:40:16,184 --> 01:40:18,934
we will be placed in the unfortunate
position of being forced...

1274
01:40:19,032 --> 01:40:21,619
to invoke the law of 1838.

1275
01:40:21,721 --> 01:40:26,938
This is the most shameless piece
of hypocrisy I have ever encountered.

1276
01:40:27,035 --> 01:40:29,970
I warn you.
I shall expose this hypocrisy.

1277
01:40:30,075 --> 01:40:32,826
And I shall raise such a voice
throughout all France...

1278
01:40:32,923 --> 01:40:37,147
the reverberations will send petty
politicians toppling from their seats.

1279
01:40:38,333 --> 01:40:40,188
Come here, Bernadette.

1280
01:40:42,846 --> 01:40:46,741
I know this child.
So does the imperial prosecutor.

1281
01:40:46,847 --> 01:40:50,143
She is neither a maniac
nor a menace to her fellowmen.

1282
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:53,536
If you still intend to take her,
gentlemen, well and good.

1283
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:57,178
But rest assured,
I shall not stir from this girl's side.

1284
01:40:57,313 --> 01:40:59,321
Now, call the police.

1285
01:40:59,426 --> 01:41:01,630
And when the police
do come, what then?

1286
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:03,640
When they come,
I shall say to them...

1287
01:41:03,746 --> 01:41:08,286
"Load well your guns, for your path
lies over my dead body."

1288
01:41:09,988 --> 01:41:12,258
Well?

1289
01:41:12,356 --> 01:41:15,040
- I'm sorry.
- Come, Bernadette.

1290
01:41:47,564 --> 01:41:49,866
Mother Superior has asked me
to watch over you.

1291
01:41:49,965 --> 01:41:52,486
I'm sorry to have
caused you this trouble.

1292
01:41:52,589 --> 01:41:56,420
I welcome the opportunity of talking
to you before I leave Lourdes.

1293
01:41:56,526 --> 01:41:58,599
<i>- You're leaving?
- Tomorrow.</i>

1294
01:41:58,703 --> 01:42:02,020
<i>I've been recalled to the Mother
House of our Lord of Nevers.</i>

1295
01:42:02,127 --> 01:42:07,082
The Dean of Lourdes is
on his way to speak to the
Bishop ofTarbes in your behalf.

1296
01:42:07,185 --> 01:42:11,725
I want you to know that although
you used your wiles successfully
on a great many people...

1297
01:42:11,825 --> 01:42:15,623
<i>one person remains
who does not believe you.</i>

1298
01:42:16,947 --> 01:42:18,769
That person is myself.

1299
01:42:18,867 --> 01:42:22,032
I've never wanted you
to believe me, Sister.

1300
01:42:23,572 --> 01:42:25,962
If that is one of those
disarming answers of yours...

1301
01:42:26,068 --> 01:42:28,786
that is supposed
to strike one silent...

1302
01:42:28,886 --> 01:42:30,708
you need not
waste it on me.

1303
01:42:32,406 --> 01:42:36,946
<i>You should be thankful, Bernadette,
you did not live in former times.</i>

1304
01:42:37,047 --> 01:42:40,561
Creatures who boasted
of equivocal visions...

1305
01:42:40,664 --> 01:42:43,731
and produced springs
as if by magic...

1306
01:42:43,833 --> 01:42:45,808
were burned at the stake.

1307
01:42:45,913 --> 01:42:47,889
<i>I have prayed for you...</i>

1308
01:42:47,994 --> 01:42:50,962
night after night,
and I shall continue...

1309
01:42:51,067 --> 01:42:53,009
so that your soul
may not be destroyed...

1310
01:42:53,115 --> 01:42:56,115
by the frightful danger
to which you are exposing it.

1311
01:42:59,228 --> 01:43:02,295
- And now good night, Bernadette.
- Good night, Sister.

1312
01:43:26,434 --> 01:43:31,192
However, above all that,
I come in the cause of justice.

1313
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:34,300
The authorities are scheming
and plotting this girl's destruction.

1314
01:43:36,868 --> 01:43:40,830
It is not the practice of the Church
to interfere with the authorities.

1315
01:43:40,933 --> 01:43:44,709
And particularly in the case
of Bernadette Soubirous...

1316
01:43:44,806 --> 01:43:47,676
we will rigidly adhere to
our policy of remaining aloof.

1317
01:43:47,782 --> 01:43:51,493
In my opinion, a change
in our policy is now necessary.

1318
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:55,848
That opinion is not shared
by an amazing number
of equally worthy ecclesiastics.

1319
01:43:55,945 --> 01:44:01,248
I realize that. I also realize that none
but myself has talked to this child.

1320
01:44:01,354 --> 01:44:05,381
I've begun to wonder if she is
not a true vessel of grace
and a worker of miracles.

1321
01:44:05,515 --> 01:44:07,304
Oh, stop!

1322
01:44:07,436 --> 01:44:09,225
My dear Dean...

1323
01:44:09,356 --> 01:44:12,521
only the Congregation of Rights can
determine whether a given phenomenon...

1324
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:14,988
is a genuine miracle
or a deception.

1325
01:44:15,117 --> 01:44:17,485
True.

1326
01:44:17,582 --> 01:44:19,437
That's all I ask.

1327
01:44:19,534 --> 01:44:21,705
That an Episcopal Commission
be set up to investigate.

1328
01:44:21,839 --> 01:44:26,509
Two or three questionable cures are not
sufficient to cause an investigation.

1329
01:44:26,607 --> 01:44:31,726
One questionable cure was
sufficient to cause a multitude
to travel hundreds of miles.

1330
01:44:35,409 --> 01:44:37,450
Very well.

1331
01:44:37,554 --> 01:44:40,043
- I will convoke such a commission.
- Thank you.

1332
01:44:40,146 --> 01:44:44,238
Providing certain obstacles
can be surmounted.

1333
01:44:44,339 --> 01:44:46,227
You fully realize,
of course...

1334
01:44:46,324 --> 01:44:48,429
just what
this will mean?

1335
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:52,526
The commission can render
only one of three decisions.

1336
01:44:52,629 --> 01:44:56,110
First, you're an impostor,
little Soubirous.

1337
01:44:56,214 --> 01:45:00,557
Hence away with you
to a prison for juvenile delinquents.

1338
01:45:00,663 --> 01:45:04,406
Second, you're a madwoman,
little Soubirous.

1339
01:45:04,504 --> 01:45:06,838
Away with you to an asylum.

1340
01:45:06,969 --> 01:45:11,792
- Third...
- You are the rarest of
mortal beings, little Soubirous.

1341
01:45:13,241 --> 01:45:16,591
Just when do you think
the commission will begin its work?

1342
01:45:16,699 --> 01:45:18,968
The scientists,
the chemists, the geologists...

1343
01:45:19,067 --> 01:45:21,751
cannot possibly conduct their
researches with the grotto boarded up.

1344
01:45:21,852 --> 01:45:24,787
- A letter from you
will force them to open it.
- No.

1345
01:45:24,892 --> 01:45:27,959
The emperor must command
that the grotto be opened.

1346
01:45:28,094 --> 01:45:30,844
Then the commission may assemble.
Not the other way around.

1347
01:45:30,974 --> 01:45:33,658
- When will you ask the emperor?
- Never.

1348
01:45:33,726 --> 01:45:36,694
I've not the slightest
intention of mentioning it.

1349
01:45:36,799 --> 01:45:40,760
He will not know that I even
contemplate convoking the commission.

1350
01:45:44,224 --> 01:45:47,225
- My attitude puzzles you, doesn't it?
- Frankly, yes.

1351
01:45:47,329 --> 01:45:52,568
I am giving your lady a chance
to prove herself to me.

1352
01:45:52,674 --> 01:45:56,472
If she is the Blessed Virgin,
then nothing is impossible for her...

1353
01:45:56,580 --> 01:45:59,166
and she will overcome
the emperor.

1354
01:45:59,268 --> 01:46:04,834
However, if she is overcome,
then she's a fraud.

1355
01:46:05,926 --> 01:46:08,414
The grotto will remain
boarded up...

1356
01:46:08,518 --> 01:46:13,538
and she and any thought of the
commission will vanish into thin air.

1357
01:46:15,496 --> 01:46:20,516
I wonder,
my dear Dean, who will win...

1358
01:46:20,616 --> 01:46:23,006
the emperor or the lady.

1359
01:46:34,859 --> 01:46:36,747
<i>Stay where you are.!</i>

1360
01:46:36,844 --> 01:46:38,667
You're under arrest.

1361
01:46:38,765 --> 01:46:41,831
Go down. I'll watch them
from here.

1362
01:46:41,901 --> 01:46:45,677
- Name, age, occupation.
- Jacques Gozos, 46, carpenter.

1363
01:46:45,742 --> 01:46:48,678
- Charge?
- Stealing water from Massabielle.

1364
01:46:48,783 --> 01:46:52,045
- One franc and costs.
- But I haven't got it, monsieur.

1365
01:46:52,143 --> 01:46:54,599
Two days in jail then.
Take him away.

1366
01:46:54,705 --> 01:46:56,614
<i>- Next case.
- Bruat. Woman.</i>

1367
01:46:56,721 --> 01:46:59,274
Bruat! Woman.

1368
01:47:03,507 --> 01:47:08,330
- Name, age and occupation.
- Bruat, Leontine, 34, governess.

1369
01:47:08,435 --> 01:47:11,731
Commissioner.

1370
01:47:13,557 --> 01:47:17,420
Bruat? Madame, are you by any chance
related to Admiral Bruat?

1371
01:47:17,558 --> 01:47:22,294
- He's my husband.
- Oh. I am Vital Dutour,
the imperial prosecutor.

1372
01:47:22,391 --> 01:47:25,708
- How do you do?
- Won't you come into my office
and sit down? Please.

1373
01:47:25,815 --> 01:47:28,914
I was arrested and led through
the streets, the same as the rest.

1374
01:47:29,016 --> 01:47:31,831
I do not wish to be treated
differently now that I'm here.

1375
01:47:31,961 --> 01:47:36,086
Madame, this is most distressing.
You are the bearer of a great name.

1376
01:47:36,186 --> 01:47:38,641
When ladies of your station
exhibit to the masses...

1377
01:47:38,746 --> 01:47:41,267
their utter contempt
for the law by breaking it...

1378
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:43,956
what is the poor
civil servant to do?

1379
01:47:44,059 --> 01:47:47,093
- Punish them the same
as you would the others.
- Very well, madame.

1380
01:47:47,196 --> 01:47:50,841
I am forced to require you
to pay a fine of one franc and costs.

1381
01:47:50,941 --> 01:47:53,210
Delighted, monsieur.

1382
01:47:56,734 --> 01:48:01,950
And here are a hundred more
for my fellow criminals
who are without funds.

1383
01:48:02,047 --> 01:48:04,469
And now, please,
may I have the bottle?

1384
01:48:04,608 --> 01:48:07,292
The bottle is confiscated.

1385
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,532
But I don't believe
it remains so, monsieur...

1386
01:48:09,633 --> 01:48:12,535
for I filled it at the desire of a
very high personage.

1387
01:48:12,642 --> 01:48:15,293
May I ask who
this personage is, madame?

1388
01:48:15,394 --> 01:48:17,882
Her Majesty,
the empress Eugenie.

1389
01:48:17,987 --> 01:48:21,304
I have the honor to be the governess
of His Highness, the prince imperial.

1390
01:48:21,443 --> 01:48:23,811
Take it, madame.

1391
01:48:23,908 --> 01:48:28,830
I begin to see the folly of
being the only one to do one's
duty in a feebleminded world.

1392
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:31,685
Madame.

1393
01:48:47,017 --> 01:48:48,905
His temperature
is quite normal now.

1394
01:48:49,002 --> 01:48:50,911
Oh, thank God.

1395
01:48:51,018 --> 01:48:52,993
I was right.
The water is miraculous.

1396
01:48:53,099 --> 01:48:54,921
I'm sure it is, madame.

1397
01:48:55,019 --> 01:48:57,889
<i>Loulou, my darling.
You'll be well now, my sweet.</i>

1398
01:49:02,605 --> 01:49:05,835
Louis.

1399
01:49:05,933 --> 01:49:08,716
Loulou is better.
The water from Lourdes made him well.

1400
01:49:08,814 --> 01:49:12,906
<i>Let us say, sire, the waters
did the prince no harm.
He had only a slight cold.</i>

1401
01:49:13,007 --> 01:49:15,822
How can you say that?
His forehead was on fire with fever.

1402
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,743
<i>Never more than
two degrees, madame.</i>

1403
01:49:17,841 --> 01:49:20,656
It was diphtheria
or scarlet fever. I know it. I feel it.

1404
01:49:20,753 --> 01:49:23,088
Please, my dearest,
don't excite yourself.

1405
01:49:23,185 --> 01:49:25,041
Come and sit down.

1406
01:49:25,138 --> 01:49:28,935
Loulou has had a number of attacks
like this and he's always gotten well.

1407
01:49:29,043 --> 01:49:32,556
I tell you, Louis.
It was the water that saved him.

1408
01:49:32,659 --> 01:49:34,831
That's a very frivolous
observation, darling.

1409
01:49:34,932 --> 01:49:37,452
You're doing a great injustice
to the doctor's prescriptions.

1410
01:49:37,556 --> 01:49:41,616
- You're an atheist, Louis.
- That's the most stupid thing
a sovereign could be.

1411
01:49:41,717 --> 01:49:43,540
Then you're worse
than an atheist.

1412
01:49:43,638 --> 01:49:47,283
You haven't the humility to thank God
for the grace he's accorded us.

1413
01:49:53,848 --> 01:49:56,499
By order of
His Majesty, the emperor...

1414
01:49:56,601 --> 01:50:02,199
the ordinance of May 10 is hereby
revoked and nullified as of this date.

1415
01:50:02,298 --> 01:50:04,121
The grotto shall be opened.

1416
01:50:04,219 --> 01:50:07,929
Signed, Louis Napoleon.

1417
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:16,345
I must say, my dear Dean...

1418
01:50:16,445 --> 01:50:19,861
your lady wastes
no time in accepting a challenge.

1419
01:50:22,527 --> 01:50:25,277
<i>The lady has had sweet revenge.</i>

1420
01:50:27,295 --> 01:50:31,803
<i>I'm being, uh, transferred to Alais.</i>

1421
01:50:31,905 --> 01:50:35,767
Perhaps I should say
demoted to Alais.

1422
01:50:35,873 --> 01:50:38,873
Yes, I rather expected
you would be.

1423
01:50:38,978 --> 01:50:41,696
I, too, received
a letter this morning.

1424
01:50:41,794 --> 01:50:45,985
Yeah? What hole
are you headed for?

1425
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:50,274
In my case, the lady wanted
even sweeter revenge.

1426
01:50:50,373 --> 01:50:54,913
I'm to stay here...
for a while at least.

1427
01:50:55,014 --> 01:51:00,132
Watch the thing I fought against
blossom like a fruit tree.

1428
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:06,563
It's the influenza again.
I can feel it.

1429
01:51:06,664 --> 01:51:11,619
Evidently her lady intends
to leave me exactly as she found me.

1430
01:51:11,721 --> 01:51:15,683
<i>- Some hot wine, Duran.
- Oui, monsieur.</i>

1431
01:51:26,797 --> 01:51:28,707
And then I ran
to the other side...

1432
01:51:28,813 --> 01:51:32,426
and ate of the grass and the herbs,
as the Lady had asked me to.

1433
01:51:32,526 --> 01:51:37,764
I can't understand the Lady demanding
anything so repulsive of you.

1434
01:51:37,871 --> 01:51:41,647
It doesn't fit into the description
that you gave of her...

1435
01:51:41,744 --> 01:51:43,916
that she bade you
act like an animal.

1436
01:51:44,016 --> 01:51:47,181
Do you act like an animal
when you eat salad?

1437
01:51:47,249 --> 01:51:49,933
Go on.

1438
01:51:50,034 --> 01:51:52,751
Then I looked for the spring.

1439
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:57,772
Since I couldn't see it,
I supposed the Lady meant
that it was below the ground.

1440
01:51:57,876 --> 01:52:00,691
So I began to scratch
and dig with my fingers.

1441
01:52:20,409 --> 01:52:24,566
To be considered a miracle,
a healing must be as sudden
as a bolt of lightning.

1442
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:27,798
It must be from
one moment to the next.

1443
01:52:27,898 --> 01:52:29,721
Further proof is necessary.

1444
01:52:31,963 --> 01:52:34,866
When I looked for the spring,
since I could not see it...

1445
01:52:34,972 --> 01:52:37,787
I supposed the Lady meant
that it was below the ground.

1446
01:52:37,884 --> 01:52:40,732
So I began to scratch
and dig with my fingers.

1447
01:52:42,877 --> 01:52:45,725
Then I looked for the spring.
Since I could not see it...

1448
01:52:45,822 --> 01:52:48,757
I supposed the Lady meant
that it was below the ground.

1449
01:52:48,863 --> 01:52:51,416
So I began to scratch
and dig with my fingers.

1450
01:52:51,519 --> 01:52:53,756
There is still the
possibility of deception.

1451
01:52:55,232 --> 01:52:57,654
Further proof is necessary.

1452
01:52:57,761 --> 01:52:59,801
The evidence is insufficient.

1453
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:23,173
Come in, Bernadette.

1454
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:25,093
I'm sorry to be late,
Your Reverence...

1455
01:53:25,191 --> 01:53:28,258
- but my brother came in
with a frostbitten nose.
- Come by the fire.

1456
01:53:28,359 --> 01:53:32,157
- I had to rub snow on it.
- March is coming in
like a lion, isn't it?

1457
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:35,015
- Sit down, Bernadette.
- Oh, thank you, Father.

1458
01:53:35,113 --> 01:53:38,497
I'm sorry I was unable to attend
your sister's wedding on Thursday.

1459
01:53:38,602 --> 01:53:41,123
- Father Pomian tells me it was lovely.
- Oh, yes.

1460
01:53:41,227 --> 01:53:43,114
We had lots of cakes.

1461
01:53:43,211 --> 01:53:45,962
One with figures on it.
It was ever so nice.

1462
01:53:46,059 --> 01:53:50,086
Now I suppose she'll be giving up
her position with Madame Millet.

1463
01:53:50,156 --> 01:53:52,197
Yes, they're going
to live on a farm.

1464
01:53:52,301 --> 01:53:55,269
But Madame Millet's
going to take me as housemaid.

1465
01:53:55,374 --> 01:53:57,196
So I heard today.

1466
01:53:57,294 --> 01:54:00,590
- That's why I wanted to talk to you.
- Oh, it's not hard work.

1467
01:54:00,687 --> 01:54:02,575
And the pay is good.

1468
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:04,712
You know...

1469
01:54:04,816 --> 01:54:07,304
it's strange, Your Reverence.

1470
01:54:07,409 --> 01:54:11,949
The Lady once told me
I could never be happy in this world...

1471
01:54:12,049 --> 01:54:13,872
but I am.

1472
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:16,305
Happier than I've ever been.

1473
01:54:16,403 --> 01:54:19,981
I've got a position. And...

1474
01:54:20,083 --> 01:54:23,215
And Monsieur Antoine
is a splendid young man.

1475
01:54:26,773 --> 01:54:28,813
Bernadette...

1476
01:54:28,917 --> 01:54:32,911
have you any idea of what the bishop's
commission has been doing?

1477
01:54:33,014 --> 01:54:36,178
Oh, yes. The gentlemen have
examined and tested...

1478
01:54:36,247 --> 01:54:39,117
- all the people who have been cured.
- That's true.

1479
01:54:39,256 --> 01:54:44,046
What of yourself? Don't you
think that you and your case
are part of their task also?

1480
01:54:44,153 --> 01:54:47,732
I've answered all
the gentlemen's questions.

1481
01:54:47,833 --> 01:54:50,256
I hope they won't
ask me any more.

1482
01:54:51,995 --> 01:54:55,825
The commission is now engaged
in writing a very important
report about you.

1483
01:54:55,931 --> 01:55:00,821
<i>It admits the possibility that you were
chosen by the Powers Above...</i>

1484
01:55:00,924 --> 01:55:05,049
and that your hand alone brought
forth the spring responsible
for miraculous cures.

1485
01:55:06,653 --> 01:55:11,226
- Don't you understand what that means?
- No.

1486
01:55:11,327 --> 01:55:14,491
It means that the greatest
and the wisest men in the Church...

1487
01:55:14,591 --> 01:55:17,341
will be watching you
for decades.

1488
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:21,434
And then, perhaps long after the rest
of us are dead and thought of no more...

1489
01:55:21,537 --> 01:55:24,636
- you will...
- This is dreadful.

1490
01:55:24,738 --> 01:55:27,738
I don't want it.
It can't be.

1491
01:55:27,842 --> 01:55:30,363
It's no small matter.

1492
01:55:30,467 --> 01:55:34,079
No, no. No.

1493
01:55:34,180 --> 01:55:39,713
Tell me, aren't the sisters
in the hospital and
in the school good and kind?

1494
01:55:39,813 --> 01:55:41,668
Yes.

1495
01:55:41,766 --> 01:55:43,653
Yes, they are.
They're very sweet.

1496
01:55:43,749 --> 01:55:46,401
Could you imagine yourself
as one of them someday?

1497
01:55:46,502 --> 01:55:49,634
Dear God, no.
That's far above me.

1498
01:55:51,368 --> 01:55:55,744
I just want to go and work for
Madame Millet as housemaid. Please.

1499
01:55:55,848 --> 01:55:57,572
My dear child.

1500
01:55:59,977 --> 01:56:04,353
To you, the Most Blessed Virgin
condescended.

1501
01:56:04,459 --> 01:56:07,591
This places
a responsibility on you.

1502
01:56:07,691 --> 01:56:10,888
You can't suddenly play truant
and run away from your destiny...

1503
01:56:10,987 --> 01:56:16,204
as though it were school
and become an old widow's servant.

1504
01:56:16,301 --> 01:56:20,677
A long time ago I told you you were
playing with fire, Bernadette.

1505
01:56:20,782 --> 01:56:24,361
Your Lady was
heavenly fire.

1506
01:56:24,463 --> 01:56:26,602
Heaven chose you.

1507
01:56:26,671 --> 01:56:30,414
And now there's nothing left for you
but to choose heaven.

1508
01:56:30,512 --> 01:56:33,808
- Isn't that true?
- Yes.

1509
01:56:33,936 --> 01:56:37,232
You'll like the life
with the sisters at Nevers.

1510
01:56:37,329 --> 01:56:40,112
Their order is
beautiful and lofty...

1511
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:42,796
and very much involved
in practical life.

1512
01:56:51,285 --> 01:56:54,700
Everything you have said
is true, Your Reverence.

1513
01:56:54,805 --> 01:56:57,391
And I will do
exactly as you say.

1514
01:56:57,526 --> 01:56:59,315
But...

1515
01:56:59,447 --> 01:57:01,619
<i>You're worried
about your family?</i>

1516
01:57:01,719 --> 01:57:03,542
<i>You needn't.</i>

1517
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:05,779
You may stay
with them until summer.

1518
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:09,459
It'll take that long before
the report is fully complete.

1519
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:14,231
And I've arranged for your
father to be established in
the mill on the upper Lapaca.

1520
01:57:14,330 --> 01:57:17,396
There he can practice the trade
for which he was meant.

1521
01:57:17,498 --> 01:57:19,833
Your family can live
without fear of poverty.

1522
01:57:23,324 --> 01:57:25,528
No, no, no, no, no.

1523
01:57:26,525 --> 01:57:28,827
<i>Bernadette.</i>

1524
01:57:28,925 --> 01:57:31,708
<i>Just one moment.</i>

1525
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:37,627
I've something more to say.

1526
01:57:41,088 --> 01:57:44,438
Although, as a member of
the commission, I shouldn't say it.

1527
01:57:44,577 --> 01:57:48,255
Now, mind you,
I have full faith in you...

1528
01:57:48,353 --> 01:57:53,341
but there's always been one
small detail which I never
could help but doubt.

1529
01:57:53,442 --> 01:57:55,581
It's the words
"Immaculate Conception."

1530
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:03,203
If you could ever admit
that this phrase...

1531
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:06,083
was not spoken
by the Lady...

1532
01:58:08,998 --> 01:58:11,813
things might be
very different.

1533
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:17,379
If you could retract
this single incident...

1534
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:21,475
then there might be, somewhere
in this world, a little corner...

1535
01:58:21,576 --> 01:58:24,097
where you could hide
and lead a normal life.

1536
01:58:29,578 --> 01:58:32,262
Would you like a little time
to think it over?

1537
01:58:34,379 --> 01:58:36,584
I don't need time,
Your Reverence...

1538
01:58:36,685 --> 01:58:38,757
because I've never
lied to you.

1539
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:41,544
Did I speak of lying?

1540
01:58:41,645 --> 01:58:44,133
And...

1541
01:58:44,238 --> 01:58:46,409
I don't want
a little corner to hide in.

1542
01:58:48,718 --> 01:58:51,501
Good day,
Your Reverence.

1543
01:59:11,668 --> 01:59:15,247
<i>Bernadette.</i>

1544
01:59:16,565 --> 01:59:19,151
May the patron saint of travelers
watch over you.

1545
01:59:19,253 --> 01:59:22,353
- Thank you.
- A Saint Christopher.
That's what we gave her!

1546
01:59:22,454 --> 01:59:25,717
Two will make
my journey doubly safe.

1547
01:59:25,815 --> 01:59:28,401
Go along, junior.
Go along.

1548
01:59:28,503 --> 01:59:30,359
Go on, junior.

1549
01:59:35,033 --> 01:59:37,139
I don't want to say it.
It sounds silly.

1550
01:59:37,241 --> 01:59:40,558
You owe your life to Bernadette.
You say it exactly as I taught you.

1551
01:59:44,827 --> 01:59:47,413
<i>We're going to
miss you, Bernadette.</i>

1552
01:59:47,516 --> 01:59:49,524
- I'm going to miss you too.
- Will the nuns...

1553
01:59:49,628 --> 01:59:52,825
Bernadette, if I live to be a hundred,
I shall never forget this hour.

1554
01:59:52,925 --> 01:59:57,530
For it was you who snatched
me from the jaws of death
and made all my... Here.

1555
01:59:57,630 --> 02:00:01,275
A Saint Christopher.
How thoughtful.

1556
02:00:02,431 --> 02:00:04,254
<i>Well, well, well,
Bernadette.</i>

1557
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:07,516
I shall be
only a moment.

1558
02:00:07,649 --> 02:00:10,683
I'm sorry to be late, but
it was unavoidable. I was
making a speech at the depot.

1559
02:00:10,785 --> 02:00:14,364
So my old and dear friend
is leaving Lourdes.

1560
02:00:14,466 --> 02:00:19,585
Bernadette, never will I
forget those first days
of trial and tribulation...

1561
02:00:19,682 --> 02:00:24,735
when practically we alone
stood side by side,
facing a doubting world.

1562
02:00:24,804 --> 02:00:26,943
- Always will I remember...
- Pardon me, Your Honor...

1563
02:00:27,045 --> 02:00:28,955
but the sisters in the carriage
grow impatient.

1564
02:00:29,061 --> 02:00:31,429
- Huh?
- And I've not yet said
good-bye to my family.

1565
02:00:31,525 --> 02:00:33,348
- Oh.
- Will you excuse me?

1566
02:00:33,446 --> 02:00:37,124
Certainly. Certainly.
This is merely something
to enjoy on your journey.

1567
02:00:37,222 --> 02:00:40,354
- Oh, thank you, monsieur.
- A-And this.

1568
02:00:40,455 --> 02:00:44,449
May the ever-watching patron saint
of travel hover over your carriage...

1569
02:00:44,552 --> 02:00:49,409
- and guide you safely
to your destination.
- Thank you, monsieur.

1570
02:00:56,651 --> 02:01:00,198
I... wanted to say
good-bye in here.

1571
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:14,125
Keep well wrapped-up.

1572
02:01:14,223 --> 02:01:16,744
And remember that you...

1573
02:01:16,847 --> 02:01:18,920
<i>Maman, I don't
need this shawl.</i>

1574
02:01:19,024 --> 02:01:21,129
Nonsense. It'll be very windy.
With your asthma...

1575
02:01:21,233 --> 02:01:23,600
Louise...

1576
02:01:23,697 --> 02:01:27,593
this is no time
to talk about shawls.

1577
02:01:27,698 --> 02:01:32,336
There's so much to say
and so little time to say it.

1578
02:01:32,435 --> 02:01:37,193
W-When the time comes,
one can say nothing.

1579
02:01:38,388 --> 02:01:42,448
One can only feel.

1580
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:46,129
- Good-bye, Papa.
- Good-bye, my child.

1581
02:01:48,342 --> 02:01:50,710
<i>Good-bye, maman.</i>

1582
02:01:56,088 --> 02:01:58,456
Good-bye, Bernadette.

1583
02:02:07,003 --> 02:02:11,510
Say good-bye to
Madame Nicolau and...

1584
02:02:11,612 --> 02:02:14,515
and her son.

1585
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:33,274
Please, dear Sisters,
I know you've waited so long...

1586
02:02:33,377 --> 02:02:35,199
but may I have
another moment?

1587
02:02:35,297 --> 02:02:38,614
- We must reach Toulouse before dark.
- Oh, nothing can happen to us.

1588
02:02:38,722 --> 02:02:41,570
Look, I have enough protection
for even the horses.

1589
02:02:41,698 --> 02:02:44,033
Very well, but hurry.

1590
02:02:55,078 --> 02:02:57,861
I said good-bye
once this morning, I know.

1591
02:02:57,958 --> 02:03:00,163
But I have a little
something for you.

1592
02:03:00,263 --> 02:03:03,460
- Don't worry. It's not
a Saint Christopher.

1593
02:03:03,559 --> 02:03:06,626
<i>You have only four.
I blessed five this morning.</i>

1594
02:03:06,728 --> 02:03:08,638
Someone must be late.

1595
02:03:10,121 --> 02:03:12,226
Bernadette...

1596
02:03:12,329 --> 02:03:16,585
sometimes to express certain things
in a letter is difficult.

1597
02:03:16,682 --> 02:03:21,190
So, wherever you may go,
if ever you should need me...

1598
02:03:21,291 --> 02:03:23,114
just send me this.

1599
02:03:23,212 --> 02:03:26,442
I shall understand
and come immediately.

1600
02:03:27,436 --> 02:03:30,885
Your Reverence...

1601
02:03:30,989 --> 02:03:33,925
if only you knew
how much this means to me.

1602
02:03:35,151 --> 02:03:37,518
Good-bye.

1603
02:03:52,210 --> 02:03:54,382
Good-bye, Bernadette,
and God bless you.

1604
02:04:33,147 --> 02:04:34,970
For you, mademoiselle.

1605
02:04:35,067 --> 02:04:38,363
Oh, monsieur,
they are so beautiful.

1606
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:42,717
I didn't come to say good-bye
with the others because...

1607
02:04:42,813 --> 02:04:45,148
there was something
I wanted to tell you.

1608
02:04:45,246 --> 02:04:47,069
What was it,
Monsieur Antoine?

1609
02:04:48,479 --> 02:04:50,487
Well, I, uh...

1610
02:04:50,591 --> 02:04:53,887
I wanted to say...

1611
02:04:54,016 --> 02:04:57,245
Well, my mother
is getting old.

1612
02:04:57,344 --> 02:05:00,574
She and I are used to each other.
We get along very well.

1613
02:05:00,673 --> 02:05:02,681
So I've decided
never to take a wife.

1614
02:05:04,226 --> 02:05:06,943
<i>Because, uh, a mother-in-law
and a daughter-in-law...</i>

1615
02:05:07,042 --> 02:05:09,531
<i>Well, that doesn't
work out so well.</i>

1616
02:05:11,076 --> 02:05:14,655
I'm going to stay
unmarried too.

1617
02:05:15,844 --> 02:05:19,042
Well, that's what
I wanted to say to you.

1618
02:05:19,141 --> 02:05:21,378
Now I wish you luck
on your journey, Bernadette.

1619
02:05:28,904 --> 02:05:30,911
Good-bye, Antoine.

1620
02:06:10,993 --> 02:06:13,808
- You are the postulant from Lourdes?
- Yes, Mother Superior.

1621
02:06:13,905 --> 02:06:15,728
What is your name?

1622
02:06:15,826 --> 02:06:19,055
Soubirous.
Bernadette Soubirous.

1623
02:06:19,123 --> 02:06:21,741
<i>- How old are you?
- Just past 20.</i>

1624
02:06:21,843 --> 02:06:23,666
What can you do?

1625
02:06:24,724 --> 02:06:28,205
Oh, nothing
that amounts to much.

1626
02:06:28,308 --> 02:06:31,026
In the world, what would you have
liked to have been?

1627
02:06:31,126 --> 02:06:34,989
I always thought
I could have been a good servant girl.

1628
02:06:35,094 --> 02:06:38,575
- Is that you, Sister Marie-Therese?
- Yes, Mother Superior.

1629
02:06:38,679 --> 02:06:41,778
<i>This is the mistress of the novices,
to whose guidance you'll look.</i>

1630
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:44,663
This is Bernadette Soubirous,
a new postulant.

1631
02:06:44,761 --> 02:06:46,583
We know each other.

1632
02:06:46,681 --> 02:06:49,016
The postulant will start
in the kitchen tomorrow.

1633
02:06:49,114 --> 02:06:51,001
You will be asked
to wash dishes...

1634
02:06:51,130 --> 02:06:53,018
scrub floors,
sweep corridors.

1635
02:06:53,115 --> 02:06:55,930
In brief, do all the lowly tasks
that need to be done.

1636
02:06:56,027 --> 02:06:59,989
But please observe, I do not command
you. I am merely proposing this.

1637
02:07:00,091 --> 02:07:03,867
If you do not feel equal to it,
or if such work is repellent to you...

1638
02:07:03,965 --> 02:07:06,518
physically or spiritually,
I wish you would say so now.

1639
02:07:06,621 --> 02:07:10,102
Oh, no, Mother Superior,
I'm very happy to work in the kitchen.

1640
02:07:10,206 --> 02:07:13,370
Good. Sister Marie-Therese
will show you to your cell.

1641
02:07:13,471 --> 02:07:15,294
With your permission,
Mother Superior...

1642
02:07:15,391 --> 02:07:17,367
there is one other matter
to be considered.

1643
02:07:17,472 --> 02:07:21,182
The postulant bears a name which
has made a great noise in the world.

1644
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,964
But, among us,
great names have no meaning.

1645
02:07:24,065 --> 02:07:26,815
Although they may have been acquired
through far greater effort...

1646
02:07:26,914 --> 02:07:30,428
we disassociate ourselves from all
we may have meant to the world...

1647
02:07:30,530 --> 02:07:32,353
and all it
has meant to us.

1648
02:07:32,451 --> 02:07:34,786
Moreover,
the name Bernadette...

1649
02:07:34,883 --> 02:07:37,699
is a childish
and trivial diminutive.

1650
02:07:37,796 --> 02:07:39,618
Quite right.

1651
02:07:39,716 --> 02:07:41,888
Before actually entering
upon your novitiate...

1652
02:07:41,989 --> 02:07:43,811
you will want
to choose another name.

1653
02:07:43,909 --> 02:07:46,910
Under the circumstances,
it would be best to do so now.

1654
02:07:47,014 --> 02:07:50,692
- Have you given the matter any thought?
- No, I haven't.

1655
02:07:50,791 --> 02:07:53,759
- What was your godmother's name?
- Bernarde.

1656
02:07:53,863 --> 02:07:57,606
Then, surely, you'll be happy to bear
the name of Marie-Bernarde, my child.

1657
02:07:57,704 --> 02:07:59,679
<i>This way, Marie-Bernarde.</i>

1658
02:08:27,664 --> 02:08:30,566
<i>The cell is not to your liking,
Marie-Bernarde?</i>

1659
02:08:30,672 --> 02:08:33,934
Oh, yes, Sister.
It is quite to my liking.

1660
02:08:34,033 --> 02:08:37,514
You will learn to be
comfortable in it.

1661
02:08:40,018 --> 02:08:42,604
A convent is no prison.

1662
02:08:42,707 --> 02:08:45,522
No force is exercised here.

1663
02:08:45,619 --> 02:08:48,270
If you do not feel capable
of our obedience...

1664
02:08:48,372 --> 02:08:51,569
you will find
the door is always open.

1665
02:08:51,669 --> 02:08:53,491
Good night,
Marie-Bernarde.

1666
02:08:53,589 --> 02:08:55,794
Good night, Sister.

1667
02:09:32,829 --> 02:09:36,125
<i>- Marie-Bernarde.
- Yes, Sister?</i>

1668
02:09:36,222 --> 02:09:39,387
What are you thinking about?

1669
02:09:39,487 --> 02:09:44,092
- About my family.
- Worldly remembrances
have no place in this house.

1670
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:48,186
We're here for the purpose
of concentration, not for
reverie and woolgathering.

1671
02:09:48,289 --> 02:09:50,177
Yes, Sister.

1672
02:10:05,925 --> 02:10:08,860
You find this work repellent?

1673
02:10:08,965 --> 02:10:11,781
- Oh, no, Sister.
- Then let's show our
willingness to serve God...

1674
02:10:11,879 --> 02:10:15,295
- and not hesitate in our tasks.
- Yes, Sister.

1675
02:10:30,602 --> 02:10:35,655
- Sister Marie-Bernarde is limping.
- Yes, I've noticed it.

1676
02:10:40,044 --> 02:10:44,682
I'm afraid it is a worldly desire
to become the center of attention.

1677
02:10:44,781 --> 02:10:46,854
I shall speak to her.

1678
02:10:49,838 --> 02:10:52,359
Sister Marie-Bernarde.

1679
02:10:52,463 --> 02:10:54,667
- Come here, please.
- Yes, Sister.

1680
02:10:54,768 --> 02:10:56,776
I wish to speak with you.

1681
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:00,176
Certainly, Sister.
Would you have me finish prayers first?

1682
02:11:00,273 --> 02:11:03,569
What I have to say to
you is just as important for your soul.

1683
02:11:03,698 --> 02:11:05,738
- We will speak in your cell.
- Yes, Sister.

1684
02:11:05,843 --> 02:11:08,014
Excuse me, Mother Superior.

1685
02:11:16,949 --> 02:11:19,949
Sit down, Marie-Bernarde.

1686
02:11:20,054 --> 02:11:23,470
I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

1687
02:11:25,655 --> 02:11:28,470
- Why do you limp?
- Oh, it's nothing, Sister.

1688
02:11:28,567 --> 02:11:31,186
Limping gains sympathy
from the other sisters, is that it?

1689
02:11:31,288 --> 02:11:35,183
<i>- But I never...
- You forget. I've known
you for many years.</i>

1690
02:11:35,289 --> 02:11:38,224
In the outside world
you were celebrated.

1691
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:41,559
From all over France,
people came just to gaze upon you.

1692
02:11:41,658 --> 02:11:43,481
Here, you are a nonentity.

1693
02:11:43,579 --> 02:11:47,027
<i>- You find that difficult
to bear, don't you?
- Oh, no.</i>

1694
02:11:47,132 --> 02:11:50,875
The temptation to cling to your eminence
is undoubtedly too strong for you.

1695
02:11:50,973 --> 02:11:53,112
Truly, Sister...

1696
02:11:53,212 --> 02:11:56,955
never have I said
or done anything to attract attention.

1697
02:11:57,053 --> 02:12:01,015
I wish only to be
one of the sisters here, nothing more.

1698
02:12:02,623 --> 02:12:06,300
Ten years ago, I was
forced to doubt you. I have not changed.

1699
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:08,888
I have never
told you an untruth.

1700
02:12:10,081 --> 02:12:12,023
I have tried to believe you.

1701
02:12:12,129 --> 02:12:16,767
Only God knows
how hard I've tried, but I cannot.

1702
02:12:16,866 --> 02:12:19,037
What is it
you don't believe?

1703
02:12:19,138 --> 02:12:21,528
What everyone else
is willing to believe.

1704
02:12:21,667 --> 02:12:24,056
The Lady?

1705
02:12:24,195 --> 02:12:27,742
Oh, I did see her.
I did.

1706
02:12:27,844 --> 02:12:32,766
Many agree with you, even
the Holy Father in Rome.

1707
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:35,653
But I do not. I cannot.

1708
02:12:37,351 --> 02:12:39,718
<i>What do you know
of suffering?</i>

1709
02:12:39,847 --> 02:12:41,670
Nothing.

1710
02:12:41,768 --> 02:12:44,768
In all our sacred history...

1711
02:12:44,872 --> 02:12:48,801
the chosen ones have always
been those who have suffered.

1712
02:12:48,905 --> 02:12:53,248
Why, then, should God
choose you? Why not me?

1713
02:12:55,243 --> 02:12:57,098
I cannot answer that.

1714
02:12:57,195 --> 02:12:59,050
<i>I know what it is to suffer.</i>

1715
02:12:59,148 --> 02:13:01,701
Look at my eyes.

1716
02:13:01,804 --> 02:13:04,073
They burn like
the very fires of hell.

1717
02:13:04,172 --> 02:13:07,206
Why?
Because they need sleep.

1718
02:13:07,342 --> 02:13:09,709
They need rest,
which I will not give them.

1719
02:13:09,806 --> 02:13:12,676
My throat is parched
from constant prayer.

1720
02:13:12,814 --> 02:13:16,393
My hands are gnarled from
serving God in humiliation.

1721
02:13:16,495 --> 02:13:19,659
My body is pain-wracked
from stone floors.

1722
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:24,715
Yes, I have suffered because I know
it is the only true road to heaven.

1723
02:13:24,817 --> 02:13:29,455
And if I, who have tortured myself,
cannot glimpse the Blessed Virgin...

1724
02:13:29,554 --> 02:13:33,778
how can you, who have never felt pain,
dare to say you've seen her?

1725
02:13:35,315 --> 02:13:38,862
I don't know why
I was chosen.

1726
02:13:38,964 --> 02:13:41,299
You are a hundred times
more worthy.

1727
02:13:42,613 --> 02:13:45,265
If only I could find evidence.

1728
02:13:45,365 --> 02:13:48,236
If only you could
give me some proof.

1729
02:13:48,375 --> 02:13:51,604
Maybe then I could believe.

1730
02:13:51,703 --> 02:13:54,671
Maybe then these monsters
of doubt and hate...

1731
02:13:54,776 --> 02:13:58,421
would stop
consuming my very soul.

1732
02:13:58,521 --> 02:14:01,783
For the love of God, Sister,
give me some proof.

1733
02:14:02,841 --> 02:14:05,559
I wish I could help you...

1734
02:14:06,842 --> 02:14:09,810
but I have never suffered.

1735
02:14:09,915 --> 02:14:12,501
I have never...

1736
02:14:15,228 --> 02:14:17,116
Perhaps I can help you.

1737
02:14:18,781 --> 02:14:21,432
<i>It may be
there is proof for you.</i>

1738
02:14:56,517 --> 02:15:01,570
- Well, Doctor?
- Well, in addition to
the large tumor on the knee...

1739
02:15:01,670 --> 02:15:04,486
she has tuberculosis
of the bone.

1740
02:15:04,584 --> 02:15:07,650
She has never complained
of pain?

1741
02:15:07,752 --> 02:15:09,575
No.

1742
02:15:10,824 --> 02:15:15,015
- Has she?
- She never mentioned it.

1743
02:15:15,113 --> 02:15:17,285
I can't understand it.

1744
02:15:17,386 --> 02:15:19,623
She's had this affliction
for a long time.

1745
02:15:19,722 --> 02:15:23,880
<i>And the constant pain
and suffering, which is so
characteristic of this disease...</i>

1746
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:26,828
<i>is too horrible to describe.</i>

1747
02:15:39,663 --> 02:15:43,494
<i>Oh, God, I have tried to storm
the gates ofheaven...</i>

1748
02:15:43,632 --> 02:15:45,542
by sacrificing myself.

1749
02:15:45,648 --> 02:15:48,616
I know now that
we must be chosen...

1750
02:15:48,721 --> 02:15:52,169
that we must be graced,
as you have graced this child.

1751
02:15:53,170 --> 02:15:55,177
God, forgive me.

1752
02:15:55,250 --> 02:15:57,640
I have persecuted her,
and I did not believe her...

1753
02:15:57,779 --> 02:16:02,286
because I was filled
with hate and envy.

1754
02:16:02,388 --> 02:16:07,441
God help me to serve this chosen soul
for the rest of my days.

1755
02:16:08,662 --> 02:16:12,754
God help me.
God help me.

1756
02:16:52,031 --> 02:16:54,421
You seem a trifle
stronger today, Sister.

1757
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:57,408
Yes, thank you,
Mother Superior, I am.

1758
02:16:57,537 --> 02:17:02,327
Sister Marie-Therese and I have
been discussing the possibility
of your taking a trip.

1759
02:17:02,465 --> 02:17:04,288
A trip?

1760
02:17:04,386 --> 02:17:07,648
We could make the journey to our convent
at Lourdes in easy stages.

1761
02:17:07,747 --> 02:17:09,820
Lourdes?

1762
02:17:09,923 --> 02:17:12,826
Should not you, of all people,
take advantage of the benefit...

1763
02:17:12,963 --> 02:17:14,873
that's come to
the whole world through you?

1764
02:17:16,837 --> 02:17:19,074
That cannot be done.

1765
02:17:19,174 --> 02:17:21,476
<i>And why not?</i>

1766
02:17:21,574 --> 02:17:24,160
The spring is not for me.

1767
02:17:24,262 --> 02:17:27,908
Why should not the spring work
in your case, of all cases, Sister?

1768
02:17:29,736 --> 02:17:32,584
The spring is not for me.

1769
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:34,590
Did the Lady
tell you that, my child?

1770
02:17:35,977 --> 02:17:38,563
She said...

1771
02:17:38,666 --> 02:17:42,376
"I cannot promise you
happiness in this world...

1772
02:17:42,474 --> 02:17:45,125
only in the next."

1773
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:50,883
The spring is not for me.

1774
02:18:16,178 --> 02:18:18,001
Thank you, Doctor.

1775
02:18:19,955 --> 02:18:23,087
In that case, Father,
we must notify the bishop immediately.

1776
02:18:23,187 --> 02:18:27,345
He wants to hear from Marie-Bernarde's
lips a final confirmation.

1777
02:19:08,893 --> 02:19:14,361
Sister Marie-Bernarde, we shall read
to you the final protocol...

1778
02:19:14,462 --> 02:19:18,075
of the Commission of Investigation,
assembled in 1858.

1779
02:19:18,176 --> 02:19:20,511
<i>It contains a record...</i>

1780
02:19:20,608 --> 02:19:23,871
<i>of all the testimony which
you offered at the time.</i>

1781
02:19:23,969 --> 02:19:28,410
We ask nothing of you,
except that you confirm that testimony.

1782
02:19:28,514 --> 02:19:32,224
<i>Do you feel equal to that?</i>

1783
02:19:38,916 --> 02:19:40,738
Yes.

1784
02:19:44,453 --> 02:19:48,677
"On February 11,
in the year of our Lord, 1858...

1785
02:19:48,774 --> 02:19:52,550
<i>"I, Bernadette Soubirous, was sent
in the company of my sister Marie...</i>

1786
02:19:52,647 --> 02:19:54,655
<i>"and my friend Jeanne Abadie...</i>

1787
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:56,735
to fetch firewood
in the forest."

1788
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:59,110
<i>Do you confirm this?</i>

1789
02:20:00,297 --> 02:20:02,119
I did see her.

1790
02:20:02,217 --> 02:20:04,901
<i>"At a location known
as Massabielle, I rested...</i>

1791
02:20:05,002 --> 02:20:07,686
<i>while my sister and friend
crossed the River Gave. "</i>

1792
02:20:07,786 --> 02:20:10,121
<i>Do you confirm this?</i>

1793
02:20:12,108 --> 02:20:14,956
I... did see her.

1794
02:20:15,052 --> 02:20:16,874
<i>"For a time, nothing happened.</i>

1795
02:20:16,972 --> 02:20:19,820
<i>- "Suddenly I noticed
that the rosebush was shaking.
- I did see her.</i>

1796
02:20:19,949 --> 02:20:21,771
"I thought this strange...

1797
02:20:21,869 --> 02:20:24,870
- because there was no..."
- I did see her.

1798
02:20:24,974 --> 02:20:28,139
I did see her.

1799
02:20:33,137 --> 02:20:35,406
I...

1800
02:20:35,505 --> 02:20:38,091
did... see... her.

1801
02:20:47,763 --> 02:20:49,902
You're not sorry
you came back to visit us?

1802
02:20:50,004 --> 02:20:53,780
No. For five years
I've been stationed in Languedoc.

1803
02:20:53,877 --> 02:20:56,812
A stinking hole,
if ever there was one.

1804
02:20:56,917 --> 02:21:00,879
Now that I see this, I realize
what a paradise I've been living in.

1805
02:21:00,983 --> 02:21:06,451
You see, my friend, how deeply hell
reaches into human life.

1806
02:21:06,551 --> 02:21:09,618
Poor, ignorant sheep.
Why do they come?

1807
02:21:09,721 --> 02:21:11,543
Because they have faith.

1808
02:21:11,641 --> 02:21:13,529
Because they're desperate.

1809
02:21:13,657 --> 02:21:15,862
Because occasionally
someone is cured.

1810
02:21:15,962 --> 02:21:19,923
And because some hypochondriac,
due to emotional excitement...

1811
02:21:20,027 --> 02:21:22,416
forgets a malady
that never existed.

1812
02:21:22,555 --> 02:21:25,556
Oh, yes, we have
hundreds of those.

1813
02:21:25,692 --> 02:21:29,206
But we have many, many other cases
that aren't so easy to explain.

1814
02:21:29,309 --> 02:21:34,044
<i>Yesterday there was a woman with
lupus... tuberculosis of the face.</i>

1815
02:21:34,141 --> 02:21:37,972
Suddenly she discovered
a nose and a mouth...

1816
02:21:38,111 --> 02:21:42,618
where only ten minutes before
there was nothing but
one large, decaying cavity.

1817
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:44,542
Please, Doctor...

1818
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:46,812
I'm not a gullible sheepherder
from the Pyrenees.

1819
02:21:46,913 --> 02:21:50,329
We have pictures in the office.
Would you care to come down?

1820
02:21:50,433 --> 02:21:52,954
Gentlemen, what's the use?

1821
02:21:53,058 --> 02:21:56,288
The same argument has been going on
for a great many years...

1822
02:21:56,386 --> 02:21:59,322
and I'm afraid will go on
for a great many more.

1823
02:21:59,427 --> 02:22:02,723
For those who believe in God,
no explanation is necessary.

1824
02:22:02,852 --> 02:22:05,307
For those who do not,
no explanation will suffice.

1825
02:22:05,413 --> 02:22:07,486
<i>- Your Reverence...
- Yes, Adolar.</i>

1826
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:10,241
Here is a message. Your housekeeper
thought it was important.

1827
02:22:10,342 --> 02:22:12,229
Thank you.
This is the first.

1828
02:22:12,326 --> 02:22:14,815
<i>You remember him,
the Bouhouhorts child?</i>

1829
02:22:14,919 --> 02:22:18,335
- Is that all, Your Reverence?
- Yes, thank you, Adolar.

1830
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:23,906
<i>You should have the doctor give
you something for that cold, monsieur.</i>

1831
02:22:24,009 --> 02:22:26,465
<i>No. It's just a little
laryngitis I picked up...</i>

1832
02:22:26,569 --> 02:22:28,937
<i>on the drafty train last night.</i>

1833
02:22:29,066 --> 02:22:31,205
<i>It will be gone by tomorrow.</i>

1834
02:22:31,306 --> 02:22:33,379
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Good day.

1835
02:22:33,483 --> 02:22:35,817
- Good day, Dean.
- Good day, Dean.

1836
02:22:35,915 --> 02:22:38,305
And I give you
full permission, dear Doctor...

1837
02:22:38,444 --> 02:22:40,932
to write down
in your big book...

1838
02:22:41,037 --> 02:22:46,537
that my amazing recovery
was due solely to the Lady of Lourdes.

1839
02:22:46,638 --> 02:22:50,697
If I kept such a book, I would
write you down merely as a skeptic...

1840
02:22:50,799 --> 02:22:56,234
who I promise will
leave Lourdes at least... wondering.

1841
02:22:56,336 --> 02:22:58,224
Not I, Doctor.

1842
02:22:58,321 --> 02:23:00,525
Not I.

1843
02:23:00,625 --> 02:23:03,178
This place only
succeeds in revolting me.

1844
02:23:03,282 --> 02:23:07,560
Once it was a dull but pleasing
little village. Now look at it.

1845
02:23:07,698 --> 02:23:12,369
- A tremendous sponge sopping up
all the infection of the world.
- Good morning, Mr. Jones.

1846
02:23:12,468 --> 02:23:14,290
- Morning, Dr. Dozous.
- Good day, gentlemen.

1847
02:23:14,388 --> 02:23:16,331
- Good day, Monsieur Dutour.
- Good day, monsieur.

1848
02:23:16,469 --> 02:23:20,299
- You look better today.
- Oh, yes, Doctor. I think
I feel much better today.

1849
02:23:24,534 --> 02:23:27,601
MonsieurJones's voice
has a lot in common with...

1850
02:23:27,703 --> 02:23:30,037
Monsieur Dutour's.

1851
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:37,554
- Don't you think?
- Yes, now that you mention it.

1852
02:23:40,122 --> 02:23:43,920
MonsieurJones
has cancer of the larynx.

1853
02:23:44,059 --> 02:23:46,961
#Ave, Ave #

1854
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:51,803
#Ave Maria #

1855
02:23:51,901 --> 02:23:54,105
- Holy Mary.
- Pray for us.

1856
02:23:54,205 --> 02:23:56,278
- Mother of God.
- Pray for us.

1857
02:23:56,381 --> 02:23:58,749
- Holy Virgin of virgins.
- Pray for us.

1858
02:23:58,877 --> 02:24:00,820
- Mother of Christ.
- Pray for us.

1859
02:24:00,958 --> 02:24:03,609
- Mother of Divine Grace.
- Pray for us.

1860
02:24:03,711 --> 02:24:06,101
- Mother most pure.
- I am a stranger here.

1861
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:09,557
I'm not like these
thousands of souls...

1862
02:24:09,696 --> 02:24:13,341
flickering brightly
and hopefully in the darkness.

1863
02:24:13,441 --> 02:24:17,435
My pride has always stood
between them and me.

1864
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:21,248
The pride of being
a superior human being.

1865
02:24:21,347 --> 02:24:25,341
But now I know that
we're all a wretched animal species...

1866
02:24:25,444 --> 02:24:28,892
distinguished from the insects
only by nerve centers...

1867
02:24:28,964 --> 02:24:30,820
<i>thoughts, reasoning.</i>

1868
02:24:30,885 --> 02:24:35,010
A hungry cancer
is feeding at my throat.

1869
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:37,893
Tomorrow I'll
crawl back to Languedoc...

1870
02:24:37,991 --> 02:24:42,018
hide in some hole of death
and be heard of no more.

1871
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:43,942
I'll be alone.

1872
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:45,982
Alone and desolate.

1873
02:24:46,121 --> 02:24:49,417
And why not? It's logical.

1874
02:24:49,545 --> 02:24:54,402
I'll be alone because I have loved
no one... no one and nothing.

1875
02:24:54,506 --> 02:24:57,093
- Not even myself.
- Pray for us.

1876
02:24:57,195 --> 02:24:59,585
<i>- Help of Christians.
- Pray for us.</i>

1877
02:24:59,691 --> 02:25:01,546
Nothing.

1878
02:25:01,612 --> 02:25:03,717
<i>- Queen of the patriarchs.
- Pray for us.</i>

1879
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:06,057
- Nothing.
- Pray for us.

1880
02:25:06,157 --> 02:25:08,229
<i>- Queen of apostles.
- Pray for us.</i>

1881
02:25:08,333 --> 02:25:10,341
<i>- Queen of the martyrs.
- Pray for us.</i>

1882
02:25:10,445 --> 02:25:12,901
<i>- Queen of all saints.
- Pray for me, Bernadette.</i>

1883
02:25:13,007 --> 02:25:15,374
<i>- Queen conceived without original sin.
- Pray for us.</i>

1884
02:25:34,739 --> 02:25:37,009
- Your Reverence.
- My child.

1885
02:25:38,868 --> 02:25:43,212
- I didn't lie to you.
- God knows you didn't.

1886
02:25:43,317 --> 02:25:46,733
They questioned me...

1887
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:49,620
again and again.

1888
02:25:50,582 --> 02:25:53,453
I saw her.

1889
02:25:55,096 --> 02:25:57,747
Tell them I saw her.

1890
02:25:59,193 --> 02:26:01,560
They won't believe me.

1891
02:26:01,657 --> 02:26:05,433
Yes, my little one,
you saw her.

1892
02:26:05,562 --> 02:26:09,141
And you will see her again.

1893
02:26:09,243 --> 02:26:11,632
I'm not so sure.

1894
02:26:13,884 --> 02:26:16,568
Maybe I haven't
suffered enough.

1895
02:26:16,668 --> 02:26:19,931
You've suffered enough,
my child, for the heaven of heavens.

1896
02:26:21,630 --> 02:26:23,637
Oh, no.

1897
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:28,763
I know about sick people.

1898
02:26:30,015 --> 02:26:33,050
We all exaggerate a little.

1899
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:38,907
Our pains aren't so terrible.

1900
02:26:41,986 --> 02:26:45,118
I believe...

1901
02:26:47,875 --> 02:26:52,448
Sister. Sister.

1902
02:26:54,821 --> 02:26:56,828
Are the pains worse?

1903
02:27:01,990 --> 02:27:03,965
What day is this?

1904
02:27:04,071 --> 02:27:06,592
Wednesday.

1905
02:27:06,695 --> 02:27:09,314
Wednesday?

1906
02:27:13,353 --> 02:27:16,037
Tomorrow...

1907
02:27:16,170 --> 02:27:19,073
Tomorrow
will be Thursday.

1908
02:27:24,396 --> 02:27:27,877
The Lady...

1909
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:31,691
<i>Madame...</i>

1910
02:27:31,789 --> 02:27:33,677
<i>Madame...</i>

1911
02:27:38,126 --> 02:27:40,647
Madame...

1912
02:27:44,175 --> 02:27:47,471
The Lady won't come here,
Your Reverence.

1913
02:27:49,361 --> 02:27:51,980
I'll never see her again.

1914
02:27:52,082 --> 02:27:54,253
You will, my child.

1915
02:27:54,354 --> 02:27:57,322
No.

1916
02:27:57,426 --> 02:28:00,656
No, I was stupid and lazy.

1917
02:28:02,644 --> 02:28:06,703
I didn't even know
what the Holy Trinity was.

1918
02:28:06,805 --> 02:28:10,635
Where are you, Madame?

1919
02:28:10,774 --> 02:28:12,913
Where are you?

1920
02:28:13,014 --> 02:28:15,568
She's gone.

1921
02:28:15,703 --> 02:28:17,558
<i>Behold my beloved speaketh...</i>

1922
02:28:17,655 --> 02:28:22,097
<i>- Gone.
- Arise. Make haste, my love,
my dove, my beautiful one.</i>

1923
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:27,439
<i>- I won't see her.
- For winter is now past.
The rain is over and gone.</i>

1924
02:28:27,578 --> 02:28:30,927
I'll never see her again.

1925
02:28:31,067 --> 02:28:33,139
<i>The vines in flower yield
their sweet smell.</i>

1926
02:28:33,243 --> 02:28:36,506
<i>- Never.
- Arise, my love,
my beautiful one, and come.</i>

1927
02:28:36,603 --> 02:28:40,434
<i>- Never.
- My dove in the clefts of the rock...</i>

1928
02:28:40,540 --> 02:28:43,094
<i>- in the hollow places of the wall.
- I'll never see...</i>

1929
02:28:43,197 --> 02:28:46,678
<i>Show me thy face.
Let thy voice sound in my ears.</i>

1930
02:28:46,782 --> 02:28:50,580
<i>For thy voice is sweet
and thy face comely.</i>

1931
02:28:50,719 --> 02:28:55,422
<i>My beloved to me, and I
to him who feedeth among the lilies...</i>

1932
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:57,724
<i>till the day breaks
and the shadows retire.</i>

1933
02:28:57,824 --> 02:29:01,720
<i>- Arise. Make haste...
- I love you.</i>

1934
02:29:01,825 --> 02:29:03,648
I love you.

1935
02:29:03,745 --> 02:29:07,391
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.</i>

1936
02:29:07,490 --> 02:29:13,056
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for me.

1937
02:29:16,868 --> 02:29:19,519
<i>Pray for us sinners now...</i>

1938
02:29:19,621 --> 02:29:22,884
<i>and at the hour
of our death. Amen.</i>

1939
02:29:22,981 --> 02:29:25,764
You are now
in heaven and on earth.
