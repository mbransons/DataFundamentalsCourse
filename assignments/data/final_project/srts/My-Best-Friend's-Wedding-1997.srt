1
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:27,375
2 and 2, menu.
Brian, 22, immediately.

2
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:34,173
Guillermo, two pigeons, right away.
Very important table right here.

3
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:46,352
- Give me two grain.
- I'll take that polenta.

4
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,440
This is the one I'm waiting for.
I need that meat

5
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:56,571
Pastry, get ready. I'll kill your
whole family if it's not perfect.

6
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:19,844
I'm writing it up as inventive,
and...

7
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,430
confident.

8
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:32,231
- Did the chap from Newsday call?
- I'll check.

9
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,652
Is it an interview,
or a guy you're setting me up with?

10
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,072
You never know what to do with men.

11
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,243
It's Michael.
Jules, it must be months, huh?

12
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:50,208
I can't wait to talk to you.
I'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.

13
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,253
Call me anytime. We got to talk.

14
00:04:54,462 --> 00:05:00,426
- Your man of the moment?
- No, my Michael. Michael O'Neal.

15
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:05,640
- Sounds desperate to talk to me.
- The sports writer, right?

16
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:11,020
Sophomore year at Brown.
We had this one hot month...

17
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:18,528
But you know me, I got restless.
I got up the nerve to tell him...

18
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,073
And he gave me this look...
And he said,

19
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:27,620
"It makes me want to cry. I'm
losing the best friend I ever had".

20
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:31,499
I felt the same way.

21
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:37,213
So I cried for maybe the third time
in my life, kissed him,

22
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:41,092
and we've been
best friends ever since.

23
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,430
We've seen each other
through everything...

24
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:52,728
Losing jobs, parents, lovers...
And we've travelled all over.

25
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:58,025
Best times of my life, maybe.
Drinking and talking...

26
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:03,072
- Even just on the phone.
- Moving Kindred spirits, eh?

27
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:08,077
No, he's nothing like me.
He's like you, only straight.

28
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:11,581
I remember one night in Tucson...

29
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:18,755
He takes a razor, cuts his finger,
then does the same to me...

30
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:25,094
He says, "Swear if we're not married
at 28, we'll marry each other".

31
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:30,558
We never talked about it again.
What made me think of that?

32
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:37,648
You'll be 28 in three weeks, right?
How old is he?

33
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:43,237
- You think..?
- "Desperate... to talk".

34
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:54,248
- No...
- Cheers. Courge!

35
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:59,879
It's Michael.
Jules, it must be months, huh?

36
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,258
I can't wait to talk to you.
I'm in Chicago at the Drke Hotel.

37
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:08,805
Call me anytime. We got to talk.

38
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:19,857
- Good evening, The Drake Hotel.
- I'm calling for Michael O'Neal...

39
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,408
You've been enrolled in the
Obscene Caller's Club.

40
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:35,123
It's great to hear your voice.
I've been calling for over a month.

41
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:40,586
I've been on a book tour.
My machine eats all my messages.

42
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:44,173
- You take 30 days to call back?
- Less, for you.

43
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:49,429
I have to ask you something.
I hope you don't turn me down.

44
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:53,766
If I could just
tell you something first...

45
00:07:53,975 --> 00:08:01,649
This'll probably give you the
biggest laugh of your adult life...

46
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:05,987
I was thinking about you.
I was remembering

47
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:12,326
that night we spent in Tucson,
about 1,000 years ago.

48
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:17,582
- You probably won't remember...
- I think about it all the time.

49
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,837
- You do?
- But it's not why I called.

50
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:28,050
- It's not?
- I called because I met someone.

51
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:36,851
Well That's great... You haven't
seen anyone since dingbat Jenny Lee.

52
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:42,899
I've never felt this way about
anyone, and she's all wrong for me.

53
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:48,196
- There's a good start
- She's 20 and at university.

54
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:54,535
Her name's Kim. She's beautiful,
and her dad's a billionaire.

55
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:58,790
And I've always been uncomfortable
with rich people,

56
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:04,754
but they're not like that they're
wonderful. Salt of the earth.

57
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:09,425
- So you've met her parents?
- Yeah.

58
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:12,845
We're getting married this Sunday.

59
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,392
Hallo?

60
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:23,648
It's Wednesday. How can you
be getting married on Sunday?

61
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:28,736
Actually, it starts tomorrow.
It's a four-day wedding.

62
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:36,869
- With about ten million guests...
- Aren't you working this weekend?

63
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:42,834
The Sox are at home. "Sport"
wants a profile on Frank Thomas.

64
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:49,132
You think it's irresponsible to take
Off a weekend to get married?

65
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,760
Jules, I'm scared.

66
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:57,181
- Maybe we should talk.
- I need you.

67
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:04,522
If you can't come and hold my hand,
I'll never get through this.

68
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,775
I can't wait for you to meet her.

69
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:13,906
Take a later flight.

70
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:21,706
No, I've got just four days to break
up a wedding and steal the groom.

71
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:25,251
He adored me for nine years. Me

72
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,758
And she's known him for about five
seconds. But she's rich and perfect.

73
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:36,179
So don't go feeling sorry
for Miss Pre-teen Illinois.

74
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:43,936
I can't lose him, George.
I'm gonna bring him back.

75
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,406
- Can you believe I'm doing this?
- Not hardly.

76
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:59,220
This makes everything perfect.
All I've heard is "Julianne..."

77
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:03,808
I've never had a sister.

78
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,734
I have a favour to ask you.

79
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:19,782
My best friend shattered
her pelvis dancing in Abilene.

80
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:22,326
Will you be maid of honour?

81
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:28,541
How about someone
you've known a bit longer?

82
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:36,090
I've only two relatives under 40,
and they're vengeful sluts.

83
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:39,719
My exit

84
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:45,975
So I have four days to make you
my best friend. Let's get personal.

85
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,535
- You like the colour?
- It's beautiful.

86
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:10,875
This will be tighter. You don't
want these things to fall out.

87
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:15,671
I don't want her to trip,
so I'll take this up a bit.

88
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:20,259
Would you rather the daffodil?

89
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:23,971
I thought bridesmaids
all wore the same?

90
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,101
Not you. You have to be distinctive.

91
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:35,983
- What else did he tell you?
- You hate weddings, you never go.

92
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:42,990
You're not up for anything that's
conventional or a "female priority".

93
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:48,121
Including marriage,
romance or even...

94
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:51,249
Love?

95
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:56,671
- Michael and I were a wrong fit.
- He said that, too.

96
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:04,512
I thought I was like you, until
I met rumpled, smelly old Michael.

97
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,685
Then I found I was as sentimental
as those nitwits I'd always pitied.

98
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,063
Funny, huh?

99
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,152
I need a cigarette.

100
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:30,204
George, all she does is talk about
her and Michael's future.

101
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:34,167
And she's just so bright-eyed
and dreamy and...

102
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:39,130
I don't know if I can do it.

103
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:46,679
- Want me to turn around?
- You're not who I was expecting.

104
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:55,021
- I've seen you a lot more naked.
- Well, things are...

105
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,899
Things are different now.

106
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:03,780
Yeah, I guess so.

107
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:13,956
You look really good...
without your clothes on.

108
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:26,469
George? She's toast.

109
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:38,106
So the honeymoon is where?

110
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:43,986
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento,
we could start there. Or Phoenix...

111
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:48,908
Garden spots
lf you disregard the temperatures.

112
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:54,705
- But there's always Embassy Suites.
- It's his career. I'm supportive.

113
00:15:54,914 --> 00:16:00,753
I've been everywhere.
I want to be with the man I love.

114
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:04,048
He's lucky.

115
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:09,971
One woman in a billion
could put up with his array of shit.

116
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:15,977
- You know his symphonic range...
- Of snoring? It's even worse.

117
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,730
You know that snaffle one?

118
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:25,611
Now it's got this phlegm thing
rattling behind it.

119
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:37,165
Earplugs work. And I got him
to stop smoking in bed.

120
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:43,880
But the bathroom's a swamp,
and he likes action movies

121
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:48,551
and karaoke bars.
And I can't carry a tune

122
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:52,638
- He sucks soup through his teeth.
- That's his trademark.

123
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:59,979
- Don't touch that one
- But he sure can kiss.

124
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:06,110
It's been a while.
I'll take your word on that.

125
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:17,038
After two weeks of listing
all his faults, I made a decision.

126
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:28,049
I threw the list away.
Loving him means loving all of him.

127
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:35,681
- Do you ever get claustrophobic?
- Nothing could make me hesitate.

128
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,019
- Or get hysterical in small rooms?
- Except one thing.

129
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:46,609
You You'll always be in his mind.
This perfect creature that he loved.

130
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:53,950
- Well, perfection can get wearying.
- I really had to face up to it.

131
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:59,455
But can I be jealous of you forever?
Our paths will keep on crossing.

132
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:04,377
He'll always talk about you
But the answer was so simple.

133
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:09,841
- I was gonna predict that
- You win.

134
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:17,056
- I've missed a step.
- He's got you on a pedestal.

135
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:20,309
And me in his arms.

136
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:30,820
It's the bride, and
the woman she'll never live up to

137
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,865
Are you okay, honey?

138
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:38,619
- Did she say the wrong thing again?
- We're the vengeful sluts.

139
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:44,500
- Just call us eager.
- Have you seen the groom's men?

140
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,045
But the short hairy fat one is mine.

141
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:51,549
- Kimmy's a virgin
- Is this Michael's Julianne?

142
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:58,264
I'm Isabelle Wallace.
He scarcely did you justice, girl.

143
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:03,811
My husband says we should take you
to the ball park, to see Michael.

144
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:10,485
First you must meet these old women.
If you've had enough profanity.

145
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:26,793
Who ordered a beer?

146
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:31,506
- Let me help you.
- Are you implying I'm clumsy?

147
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:37,220
I'm confusing you with someone else.
This is Hank and Eric from "Sport".

148
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,932
They were kind enough
to give me a job.

149
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,729
- This is Walter, my father-in-law.
- Future father-in-law.

150
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:52,485
If he gives you any grief,
come and see me

151
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:56,406
- And this guy you know.
- Papa Joe.

152
00:19:56,614 --> 00:20:01,744
We had to make
Michael's baby brother best man.

153
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:06,541
Best looking guy in any room

154
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:09,252
Scotty, that'll do

155
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:16,509
It's the duty of the best man to
dance with the maid of honour

156
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:24,100
- You can't dance.
- I've got moves you've never seen.

157
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:28,938
You're an imposter

158
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:32,400
What did you do with my best friend?

159
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:37,488
I'm still your best friend. You
just haven't seen me for a while.

160
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:47,999
All I'm saying is, some people might
find all that perfection boring.

161
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,878
See, that's what I thought at first.

162
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:55,423
No potential for the long range.

163
00:20:55,631 --> 00:21:01,679
- But she has a few good traits.
- Such as?

164
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:08,519
When I hug her, even in public,
I don't have to let go right away.

165
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:12,607
She lets me hold her
as long as I want.

166
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:15,777
- What?
- Nothing.

167
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:20,865
I forgot...
you and that "yukky love" stuff.

168
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:26,829
- You always get like that about it.
- I do not

169
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,959
- When we were...
- Together?

170
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:40,760
- Did I..? When..?
- Yes.

171
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:45,306
- I did what?
- Pull away when I tried to hug you.

172
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:57,193
Well, I've changed.
I'm not the girl I once was.

173
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:02,615
Any relationship over two weeks
I should know about?

174
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:06,327
It's not about longevity, Michael.

175
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:11,416
It's about being comfortable.

176
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:15,461
With the "yukky love" stuff.

177
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:22,093
And I am.

178
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:41,112
- Karaoke How did you find this?
- The doorman told me.

179
00:22:53,624 --> 00:23:00,089
- I didn't know there was karaoke.
- This is great. My two best girls.

180
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:04,510
- Margarita. Blended, no salt.
- Margarita. Straight up.

181
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:09,515
- Amstel Light.
- Two words for you: Margarita.

182
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:12,727
Vespa.

183
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:18,107
- Florence
- Me hanging on in the rain...

184
00:23:18,316 --> 00:23:23,196
- I love Florence.
- And the guy with the thing...

185
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:28,618
- 'Where's my pass?"
- "The pier is for fishing"

186
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:34,082
- I've always loved Florence.
- You should take her there.

187
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,044
She deserves a honeymoon.

188
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:43,216
Oh yeah, "lf San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento..."

189
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:49,097
You're off the road in September.
When does your fall quarter start?

190
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:55,311
I'm not coming back to senior year.

191
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,402
Don't architects find a degree...
an asset?

192
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:10,618
- Well, I travel every week...
- Being together is more important.

193
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:14,539
Say, Pinky
I want to hear you sing.

194
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:19,752
No, Kimmy hates to sing.

195
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,344
My bride-to-be here is about to
kick some ass on... what?

196
00:24:29,345 --> 00:24:35,309
- No, it'll be fun.
- Michael, she doesn't want to.

197
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:40,398
Ladies and gentlemen Please give
it up for the vocal stylings of:

198
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:44,652
Miss Kimberly Wallace

199
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:22,899
You suck

200
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:13,676
That was terrible Terrible

201
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:24,979
- You won't be lonely without us?
- Desperately

202
00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:31,569
- Maybe we don't have to go.
- To your grandmother's dinner?

203
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:36,949
I'd babysit you, but my loyalty is
to the bride in her time of need.

204
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:41,454
- It's not really that.
- Okay, if you're sure.

205
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:45,666
- Sure?
- Then I'll stay with Michael.

206
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:51,923
- Call me later?
- Of course.

207
00:27:57,595 --> 00:28:00,264
Have fun.

208
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:16,197
- You were shocked when I told you.
- Shocked? No.

209
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:22,453
A little... a lot.

210
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:27,792
- I fell off the bed.
- That explains the thump.

211
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,629
You like her, don't you?

212
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:36,551
- Yeah... I do.
- That's enthusiastic

213
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:42,098
- No. She's great.
- "No, she's great".

214
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:46,144
She seriously can't sing a note.

215
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:52,024
- But what a sacrifice...
- What sacrifice?

216
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:56,195
- Leaving school?
- All of it.

217
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:59,949
Giving it all up
to follow you in this dumb job

218
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:06,205
where you travel all year to
places like College Station, Texas.

219
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:10,918
- Dumb job?
- It's not a grown-up job, Michael.

220
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:15,423
- My job never bothered you before.
- It doesn't bother me now.

221
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:22,513
But I'm not Kimmy. Her father owns
the Sox and Cable Sports.

222
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:31,647
- I'm surprised it hasn't come up.
- What?

223
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:36,486
Corner office with a view.
You, in a nice blue suit.

224
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:42,450
- Living here, close to Mom and Dad.
- No, never.

225
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:46,662
She would never even think of that.

226
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:50,249
You don't know her.

227
00:29:57,215 --> 00:29:59,300
But Michael loves his job.

228
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:04,931
Sure Bad games, bad pay, bad towns,
bad hotels, real bad food...

229
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:11,395
Homeless, rootless, lonely. Your
copy gets into one issue in four...

230
00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:18,945
Why would he trade all that for a
PR job at a firm like your father's?

231
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:23,449
- My father and I discussed that.
- I'm not surprised.

232
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:28,246
So, do you think he'd really accept?

233
00:30:28,454 --> 00:30:33,668
Michael? It would be the greatest
thing that ever happened to him.

234
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:40,925
Present company excepted. So...
We make your dad a co-conspirator.

235
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:46,431
Walter's re-organising PR
and needs a brilliant guy

236
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:50,643
that he can completely trust.

237
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:57,108
Then you beg: "Michael, do this
for Daddy, just for six months".

238
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:03,906
- He'll see right through it.
- Only if he wants to.

239
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:09,036
At the end of six months,
he will be happy, -

240
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:14,667
- settled, successful.

241
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:35,229
- Beautiful Do you have a date?
- You never can tell.

242
00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:40,359
"Just the way you look tonight".

243
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:43,780
Okay, kid. You're up.

244
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:57,460
My father needs a favour.

245
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:03,841
He's re-organising
some of the company divisions.

246
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:07,261
Public relations
is a real problem area.

247
00:32:09,722 --> 00:32:13,309
It would only be for six months.

248
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:19,440
- Or three or four...
- And you knew about this?

249
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:24,987
I think you ought to listen to her.
It's her life, too.

250
00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:29,033
Are you telling me that
Walter thought this up?

251
00:32:29,242 --> 00:32:35,623
- Why don't you be honest, Kim?
- I am being honest

252
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:41,045
I'm supposed to just drop out of
school, forget my family and career?

253
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:45,842
- Forget all my plans?
- Forgive me for that.

254
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:51,806
I'm glad I'm hearing about this now.
What am I supposed to do?

255
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:58,229
I have a low-paid, zero-respect job,
which I happen to love.

256
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:04,944
Michael,
it sounds like a great opportunity.

257
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:10,742
Really? How come you never took
a sell-out establishment job?

258
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:17,331
- It's not you, and it's not me.
- Okay, if that's how you feel...

259
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,211
Just say it. My job's not
good enough. I'm not good enough.

260
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:28,009
- I never said that
- Yes, you did.

261
00:33:28,176 --> 00:33:35,141
You wait till two days before
our wedding to lay this on me.

262
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:43,024
I'm an insensitive, sexist asshole.
You're better off without me.

263
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:48,905
No, Michael You're so... so right.
And I'm so wrong.

264
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:53,367
We settled this and I reneged.
It wasn't fair.

265
00:33:53,576 --> 00:34:00,166
You have to forgive me
and forget this, or I'll just die

266
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:09,008
I'm sorry...

267
00:34:31,781 --> 00:34:36,619
George and Werner are not in.
Brevity is the order of the day.

268
00:34:36,828 --> 00:34:41,124
George! Answer this, damn it!
I'm in a meltdown!

269
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:46,879
She double crossed me. She grovelled!
She's so wrong for him.

270
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:52,969
Michael and I are the same person.
Self-absorbed and vaguely lovable.

271
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:59,392
I'm running out of time and sneaky
ideas. I'm at the end of my rope.

272
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,563
George,
you have got to think of something!

273
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:10,737
Coffee, anyone?

274
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:51,027
- George
- This is very Marcel Marceau.

275
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:55,615
Relax
We don't want your face coming off.

276
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:58,451
Hideous room

277
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:03,414
Death by mini-bar.
How glamorous

278
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:12,757
- You flew here. You hate to fly
- I have to go back this evening.

279
00:36:12,924 --> 00:36:15,843
You're butting in.

280
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:22,475
What I mean by "annoyingly perfect",
is her perfection isn't annoying.

281
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:27,146
It is vulnerable and endearing.
And that is annoying

282
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:32,443
- You like her
- If I didn't hate her I'd love her.

283
00:36:32,652 --> 00:36:38,241
This is my whole life's happiness.
I have to be ruthless.

284
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:42,995
He was in love with me.
I can make him happy.

285
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:47,792
I may break her heart,
but I'm really doing her a favour.

286
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,799
She would be so miserable tagging on
after this insensitive doof us.

287
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:01,889
Jules...

288
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:09,230
Do you really love him?
Or is this just about winning?

289
00:37:11,274 --> 00:37:19,031
In the beginning it was mostly...
a prior claim. He belonged to me.

290
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:24,704
But now, when I'm with him...

291
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:28,416
He's just so wonderful

292
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:32,670
How come I never knew that before?

293
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:37,383
It's the clarity that comes
with psychotic jealousy.

294
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,512
George, believe me...

295
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:46,851
If he felt like me,
he would know how I feel.

296
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:50,772
It's horrible.

297
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:56,736
Just tell him you love him.
Julianne

298
00:37:56,944 --> 00:38:01,824
Tell him you loved him
for nine years,

299
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:05,953
but you were afraid of love.

300
00:38:06,162 --> 00:38:10,208
- Afraid of needing.
- Needing what?

301
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:16,881
To belong to someone.
We all are, sweetheart. I'm sorry.

302
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:23,179
Tell him it's the worst, cruelest,
dumbest moment to do this,

303
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:27,600
but he's got to choose.

304
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:30,978
Tell him the actual truth?

305
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:37,443
Maybe not the actual truth.
Highlights.

306
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:47,078
Arms at your sides, please.

307
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:03,136
- Morning
- Michael, I have to talk to you.

308
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:08,433
No, I don't like the suit,
but it's not that.

309
00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:17,734
- Guard this with your life.
- What is it?

310
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:23,281
The ring.
I don't trust Scotty with it.

311
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:27,744
Please... you're practically
the best man anyway.

312
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,747
Open it.

313
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:37,754
- She'll like it, won't she?
- Yes...

314
00:39:40,757 --> 00:39:43,509
So, what was it?

315
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:48,306
You wanted to talk to me
about something?

316
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:53,561
We've known each other a long time.
20 years?

317
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,773
Okay, not that long.

318
00:39:56,981 --> 00:40:01,944
And in that time, we've grown...

319
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:07,075
close. Very close.
Do you know what I mean?

320
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:09,827
I think so.

321
00:40:10,036 --> 00:40:14,791
So, sometimes...

322
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:19,629
Could you excuse us, please?

323
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:29,430
Sometimes people think they know
how they feel about each other.

324
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:32,433
But they don't...

325
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:35,561
until...

326
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:38,856
until they do.

327
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:43,361
I have a point.
The question is, am I getting to it?

328
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:48,449
Whatever it is,
it can't be that big a deal.

329
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:55,540
Oh, Michael
"Big deal" is... a relative term.

330
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,099
Who's that guy?

331
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:17,228
George. He's my editor.

332
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:22,942
- Why is he here? Are you working?
- No...

333
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:27,905
- He's here to be with me.
- Why?

334
00:41:28,114 --> 00:41:33,369
Because he's my friend.
My good friend.

335
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:37,874
My best friend, these days.

336
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,253
You've been busy.

337
00:41:42,462 --> 00:41:46,924
So... all of this
has been about George?

338
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:12,033
- I'm speechless.
- Well, that's Jules.

339
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,411
- Congratulations
- Congratulations

340
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:21,375
I told him. If we're engaged,
we shouldn't be ashamed of it.

341
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:26,672
He's racing back to New York.
He just came by to...

342
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:34,889
Well, it takes a few hours.

343
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:45,024
Give me your ring

344
00:42:45,191 --> 00:42:49,821
- I have to have an engagement ring.
- I don't believe this...

345
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:55,701
- I came here to help you
- For one day, find me irresistible.

346
00:43:03,835 --> 00:43:06,587
Stop it

347
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:12,844
Something wrong?

348
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:20,226
It's just the way you always talked
about George. It always seemed...

349
00:43:20,435 --> 00:43:26,023
seemed like...
it sounded like George was...

350
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,153
- Gay?
- Actually, yes.

351
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:36,951
- Common misconception
- It is.

352
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,415
Because George likes to pretend
that he's gay.

353
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:51,215
Why would you do that?

354
00:43:51,424 --> 00:43:56,012
- I find it attracts women.
- It worked for me.

355
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,390
Big time.

356
00:44:09,484 --> 00:44:14,447
- Race you to the altar.
- Underplay

357
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:21,704
Hey, I'm Jules' fiancé, George.
Just in town for a quick... visit.

358
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:29,337
- Are you going to humiliate me?
- Only if I can.

359
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:32,381
George

360
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:38,513
I don't know why
I'm so carried away

361
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:43,893
- It's so...
- Against God's plan?

362
00:44:44,102 --> 00:44:48,314
No, it's wonderful

363
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:56,197
Mom

364
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:04,664
- You have to meet George.
- Kimmy's little sister?

365
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:08,376
They're gonna be married

366
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:13,548
- What's going on?
- Julianne's getting married.

367
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:20,179
I wanted to shout it from the
rooftops, but Jules said no.

368
00:45:20,388 --> 00:45:25,143
"This is Kimmy's day.
Let's not take the attention".

369
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:29,814
"Dear, sweet, adorable,
chocolate-covered Kimmy".

370
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,443
Those were her very words.

371
00:45:33,651 --> 00:45:37,613
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- Me, too.

372
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:43,244
It's so sweet of you to come.
I insist you stay to lunch.

373
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:47,832
Love to Love the bag,
the shoes, love everything.

374
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,961
- What about your flight?
- Cancelled.

375
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:01,929
I was very worried about you.

376
00:46:02,138 --> 00:46:06,601
- About me?
- Well, what I heard was hilarious.

377
00:46:06,768 --> 00:46:10,605
But all those broken relationships,
all those men...

378
00:46:10,813 --> 00:46:13,900
It must have hurt.

379
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:18,988
Hurt? She couldn't sit down
for seven years.

380
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:24,786
And all the while, the man of your
dreams was right in front of you.

381
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:27,413
She's talking about me.

382
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:31,292
George,
how did you and Julianne meet?

383
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:34,921
George is my editor.

384
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:40,218
But we met long before that.
It's a very romantic story.

385
00:46:40,426 --> 00:46:44,931
- Would you like to tell it?
- No. It's private.

386
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:47,558
Not any more.

387
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:53,106
I first met Julianne
in a mental institution.

388
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,945
She was visiting a French chef
she'd sent insane.

389
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:05,201
And I was visiting Dionne Warwick.
Well, that's who he thought he was.

390
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:09,288
- Who is Dionne Warwick?
- Sacrilege

391
00:47:09,497 --> 00:47:15,628
- She's Whitney Houston's aunt.
- She's on "Psychic Friends".

392
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:29,725
So there I was with "Dionne",
having one hell of a sing-song.

393
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:36,733
Then suddenly, breezing out of
the electroshock room, I saw her.

394
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:40,111
A vision in pink.

395
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:46,576
- Pink? You don't wear pink.
- She does, Michael, sometimes.

396
00:47:46,784 --> 00:47:50,163
- You do.
- I do.

397
00:47:50,371 --> 00:47:55,042
I said to Dionne,
'Who is this vision?"

398
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:59,714
She must be the understudy
to some Broadway star.

399
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:03,384
Her skin, her hair
ln that moment, I knew.

400
00:48:03,593 --> 00:48:08,055
- We don't all need to know...
- Yes, we do

401
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,102
- I'm very curious.
- They do.

402
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:18,399
I knew,
that some day we'd end up like this.

403
00:48:18,608 --> 00:48:26,324
Like some glittering
Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza.

404
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:31,579
And I said to Dionne,
"Dionne, I'm in love".

405
00:48:31,788 --> 00:48:37,210
Could this siren love me?
Are the gods that kind?

406
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:43,591
Dionne turned to me,
opened her lovely eyes and said...

407
00:48:49,889 --> 00:48:53,184
What did she say?

408
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:56,813
The moment I wake up...

409
00:48:58,564 --> 00:49:01,984
before I put on my makeup

410
00:49:02,193 --> 00:49:06,322
I say a little prayer for you

411
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:10,618
while combing my hair now

412
00:49:10,827 --> 00:49:14,705
and wondering what dress to wear now

413
00:49:14,914 --> 00:49:18,084
I say a little prayer for you

414
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:22,505
for ever you'll stay in my heart
and I will love you

415
00:49:22,672 --> 00:49:27,176
forever, we never will part
oh howl love you

416
00:49:27,385 --> 00:49:32,223
together, forever, is how it must be
to live with out you

417
00:49:32,432 --> 00:49:35,727
would only mean heartbreak for me!

418
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:39,439
Go, Granddaddy

419
00:51:07,068 --> 00:51:09,445
All right, now

420
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:15,576
- Heartbreak for you, actually...
- Just get on your plane.

421
00:51:15,785 --> 00:51:20,873
I'll call at the turn of the century
when I've forgiven you.

422
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:25,294
- It'd never have worked out.
- It was dishonest.

423
00:51:25,503 --> 00:51:28,965
Different temperaments.

424
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:35,888
Look. Tell him you love him.
Bite the bullet.

425
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:44,105
George

426
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:50,903
What will he do?

427
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:03,833
He'll choose Kim. You'll stand
beside her at the wedding,

428
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,296
kiss him goodbye,
and go home.

429
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:11,424
That's what you came here to do.

430
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:16,179
So do it

431
00:52:30,693 --> 00:52:33,946
George isn't my fiancé, Michael.

432
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:38,076
It's been over for ages,
but he can't accept it.

433
00:52:38,284 --> 00:52:44,040
I'd built you up so much,
I couldn't let him lose face.

434
00:52:44,207 --> 00:52:51,005
He could never stack up to the
one man I measure everyone against.

435
00:52:55,927 --> 00:52:59,222
This is strange...

436
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:06,771
When you told me
you were marrying George...

437
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:12,235
... I got this really strange...

438
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:16,739
You were jealous?

439
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:25,081
Crazy jealous.

440
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:28,584
I'm sorry.

441
00:53:33,214 --> 00:53:37,677
Can we spend some time alone
this afternoon?

442
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:42,390
Would that be all right?

443
00:54:09,709 --> 00:54:14,797
I've been thinking a lot,
the last couple of days, about us.

444
00:54:15,006 --> 00:54:18,551
Have you?

445
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:25,850
- There are a lot of memories.
- It's more than that.

446
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:31,647
It's kind of embarrassing
to say it this way, but...

447
00:54:31,814 --> 00:54:37,487
You've sort of been...
the woman in my life.

448
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,408
You've been the man in mine.

449
00:54:42,617 --> 00:54:48,456
I was thinking,
this could be our last time alone.

450
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:56,380
- Except for an affair twice a year.
- Except for that.

451
00:55:03,054 --> 00:55:10,395
I mean, you commit to this wedding,
and then...

452
00:55:10,603 --> 00:55:16,734
And then there's this momentum,
and you forget you chose it.

453
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:27,745
You and I didn't... in our
relationships with other people...

454
00:55:27,954 --> 00:55:33,835
We didn't use the word "love" a lot,
did we?

455
00:55:35,253 --> 00:55:40,842
Kimmy says, if you love someone,
you say it.

456
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:44,303
You say it right then, out loud

457
00:55:44,512 --> 00:55:51,894
- Otherwise, the moment just...
- Passes you by.

458
00:56:12,957 --> 00:56:18,713
We don't even have a song.
Kimmy and I...

459
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:25,428
We don't have a song.
You think that's a bad sign?

460
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:32,518
Some day,
when I'm awfully low

461
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:40,568
and the world is cold
I will feel a glow thinking of you

462
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:46,866
and the way you look tonight

463
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:53,039
- Is your dance card filled?
- I'll have to check my power book.

464
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,833
Is that right?

465
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:03,443
Excuse me...

466
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:08,114
- I thought Michael was taking me?
- I said I'd do it.

467
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:12,368
I'm kind of unofficial best man...

468
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:17,373
Kim said there was no friction
with Michael over the job?

469
00:58:17,582 --> 00:58:21,377
- Friction? No
- Good.

470
00:58:21,586 --> 00:58:27,842
- I haven't caused a problem?
- No, nobody has.

471
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:31,053
You're a little bit early.

472
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:35,683
I need to make some calls.
Could I use your office?

473
00:58:35,892 --> 00:58:39,771
- Of course At the end of the hall.
- Thank you.

474
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:41,939
Take your time

475
00:58:50,114 --> 00:58:52,950
E-mail...

476
00:58:54,786 --> 00:58:57,538
New letter.

477
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:07,298
"To Eric Isaacson..."

478
00:59:07,507 --> 00:59:13,304
"Senior Editor,
Sport Magazine".

479
00:59:13,513 --> 00:59:18,101
"From: Walter Wallace".

480
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:24,857
You can do this, it's easy.
Just do it fast, get it over with.

481
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:30,113
"Eric, I need a favour".

482
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:36,285
"My daughter's very happiness
is in your hands".

483
00:59:36,494 --> 00:59:40,164
"I have offered Mike O'Neal,

484
00:59:40,373 --> 00:59:47,839
my new son-in-law, a great
opportunity with my company".

485
00:59:48,047 --> 00:59:51,342
"To his own detriment,

486
00:59:51,551 --> 00:59:57,432
Michael will not
accept our offer,

487
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,645
while he works for you".

488
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:33,050
"My daughter joins me
in this plea for your co-operation".

489
01:00:33,259 --> 01:00:37,305
'With gratitude, Walter".

490
01:00:37,472 --> 01:00:39,307
SEND?

491
01:00:39,515 --> 01:00:44,854
Why would I send this?
He'd get fired.

492
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:48,024
No.

493
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:54,697
"Save for later".

494
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:03,164
I'm not sending it,
just saving it for a few hours.

495
01:01:03,372 --> 01:01:10,254
Till we come back and Michael
can see it. Perfectly harmless

496
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:48,918
SAVE

497
01:02:02,932 --> 01:02:07,979
Send out this, this, not this,
... that's it.

498
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:16,070
And there are four or five e-mails
I wrote over lunch. Send them, too.

499
01:02:19,407 --> 01:02:24,328
- I can't believe it Try every key
- It's the wrong set.

500
01:02:24,537 --> 01:02:31,878
There's got to be a janitor,
or a guard, or a cleaning woman

501
01:02:32,086 --> 01:02:36,758
Somebody has to be in there
I need a brick...

502
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:40,303
What's the big deal
about getting this file tonight?

503
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:44,140
- I have a deadline.
- And I'm getting married

504
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:48,728
Exactly
Everyone is going to be so busy...

505
01:02:48,895 --> 01:02:54,734
So it's my last chance to
get up there to Walter's office...

506
01:02:54,942 --> 01:03:01,157
- Then I could e-mail it out now.
- Tomorrow's Sunday

507
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:06,704
Monday morning, crack of dawn,
Walter will walk you right up there.

508
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:09,791
Give it up, kid

509
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:14,045
You can't win them all.

510
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:28,601
Goodnight.

511
01:03:30,395 --> 01:03:33,147
Jules...

512
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,445
- This thing means that much to you?
- Yes.

513
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:48,621
Come on, we'll phone from your room.
Walter's probably not even asleep.

514
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:52,959
We'll drive up, get the right key,
and go back to the office.

515
01:03:53,126 --> 01:03:57,588
But if I fall asleep on the altar
tomorrow, you'd better be there.

516
01:03:57,797 --> 01:04:02,718
These are all from Eric.
This fax is from Eric, too.

517
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:08,349
- Can't he ever leave me alone?
- Maybe it's congratulations.

518
01:04:18,776 --> 01:04:22,155
What is it?

519
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:31,289
"I can't believe I'm doing this
just before your wedding,

520
01:04:31,497 --> 01:04:37,378
but you need and deserve to know
what you're marrying into".

521
01:04:40,298 --> 01:04:45,428
"l received the following e-mail
this afternoon".

522
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:50,183
"Eric, I need a favour.
My daughter's happiness..."

523
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:53,853
Isabelle, I need to talk to Kim.

524
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:59,442
- Is there anything wrong?
- No, I'm just tired.

525
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:05,615
Jules...
Could you give me a minute?

526
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:09,243
Please?

527
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:58,876
Excuse me, miss.
Are you locked out?

528
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:04,966
No, I just stepped out...
It's a non-smoking room.

529
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:13,266
It's a non-smoking floor, too.
Why don't you go down to the lobby?

530
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:17,520
Why don't you have me arrested?

531
01:06:17,687 --> 01:06:24,569
I mean it
I am a dangerous, criminal person.

532
01:06:24,736 --> 01:06:29,115
I do bad things to honest people.

533
01:06:30,283 --> 01:06:32,869
Make a citizen's arrest

534
01:06:33,077 --> 01:06:38,040
It'd be like getting Al Capone
on tax evasion.

535
01:06:44,005 --> 01:06:48,217
Can I help you, miss?

536
01:06:51,471 --> 01:06:56,976
- Do you smoke, Richard?
- Yes, I do, but...

537
01:06:57,143 --> 01:07:02,023
It's a non-smoking floor.

538
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:05,485
But, you know what?

539
01:07:26,005 --> 01:07:31,260
You know,
my grandmother always said:

540
01:07:33,346 --> 01:07:37,809
"This, too, shall pass".

541
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:43,523
Thanks, Richard.

542
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:12,510
I want you to quit this shit.
It'll kill you.

543
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:19,851
What happened?

544
01:08:20,059 --> 01:08:25,815
It's over. She denied it.
She said I was crazy and paranoid.

545
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:28,860
A bad combination.

546
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:34,031
There's a big brunch tomorrow
at her parents' house.

547
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,619
And she said,
"How can I call it off?"

548
01:08:38,786 --> 01:08:45,168
'What do I tell everyone?"
No, it's for the best, it really is.

549
01:08:45,376 --> 01:08:49,672
She was right.

550
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,676
I am crazy...

551
01:08:53,885 --> 01:08:59,223
to fall for someone
I hardly knew.

552
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:06,397
I'm so glad you're here.

553
01:09:11,444 --> 01:09:14,739
You still got that ring?

554
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:31,089
I tried it on,
and it won't come off.

555
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:13,756
Why don't we take a walk,
or have some food sent up?

556
01:10:13,965 --> 01:10:18,970
I just want to be alone.
Is that okay?

557
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:22,181
Sure.

558
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:28,855
Maybe I'll go back to New York
for a while with you.

559
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:36,320
Eric will understand. Or we could
go somewhere, if you want.

560
01:10:36,529 --> 01:10:40,491
"If San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento..."

561
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:45,079
I've never been to Texas.

562
01:11:51,896 --> 01:11:53,773
What?

563
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:19,173
Can I try that?

564
01:12:29,559 --> 01:12:32,478
Excuse me.

565
01:12:34,647 --> 01:12:40,403
- So this is how you call it off?
- I came here to confront them.

566
01:12:40,611 --> 01:12:48,703
- Besides, she hasn't told anyone.
- Michael, there's a wedding at six.

567
01:12:54,250 --> 01:13:01,048
Have you changed your mind?
Do you want to marry Kimmy?

568
01:13:02,592 --> 01:13:07,638
I made a decision.
It's over.

569
01:13:07,847 --> 01:13:11,267
I'll go tell them...

570
01:13:11,476 --> 01:13:15,146
First...

571
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:20,568
Do you think she's all right?
Maybe you could go check on her?

572
01:13:23,196 --> 01:13:28,993
These are the most beautiful flowers
I've ever seen.

573
01:13:30,203 --> 01:13:34,165
How is he?

574
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:41,672
He's wondering why you haven't
told your parents the wedding's off.

575
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:45,718
I'm still hoping for a miracle.

576
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:49,055
How could he think
we would do such a thing?

577
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:54,018
I only minored in psychology,
but...

578
01:13:54,227 --> 01:13:58,022
Maybe Michael couldn't commit
to this marriage.

579
01:13:58,231 --> 01:14:01,526
So he created a delusion.

580
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:07,990
Produced an unconscious
psychosomatic manifestation of...

581
01:14:09,117 --> 01:14:12,954
I'm better with food.

582
01:14:13,162 --> 01:14:18,000
Okay... You're Michael.
You're in a fancy French restaurant.

583
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:23,464
You order...
créme bruleé for dessert.

584
01:14:23,673 --> 01:14:27,176
It's beautiful. It's sweet.

585
01:14:27,385 --> 01:14:30,972
It's irritatingly perfect.

586
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:36,436
Suddenly, Michael realises
he doesn't want créme bruleé.

587
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:41,232
- He wants something else.
- What does he want?

588
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:48,573
- Jell-O.
- Jell-O Why does he want Jell-O?

589
01:14:48,781 --> 01:14:55,079
Because he's comfortable with it.
Jell-O makes him... comfortable.

590
01:14:55,288 --> 01:15:02,086
Compared to créme bruleé, it's...
Jell-O. But that's what he needs.

591
01:15:02,295 --> 01:15:05,548
- I could be Jell-O.
- No

592
01:15:05,757 --> 01:15:11,012
Créme bruleé can never be Jell-O.
You could never be Jell-O.

593
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:14,223
- I have to be.
- Never

594
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:20,313
Tell your parents. Don't wait for
"Do you take this man..."

595
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:27,236
I love him The delusions I drove
him to have some truth in them.

596
01:15:27,403 --> 01:15:33,785
I want him to work for my father.
I want to stay in school.

597
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:38,748
Please, tell him it's my fault,
and that I love him.

598
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:44,337
You're the only person that I trust.

599
01:15:48,299 --> 01:15:51,219
I'll be right back.

600
01:16:04,565 --> 01:16:06,943
How is she?

601
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:11,197
- Hey, knock it off
- Yes, sir

602
01:16:12,115 --> 01:16:17,078
- I asked...
- She admits that it's her fault.

603
01:16:20,415 --> 01:16:25,628
Do you think she still loves me?

604
01:16:25,837 --> 01:16:29,757
Love... it's a strong word.

605
01:16:29,966 --> 01:16:33,344
I don't know that I'm qualified...

606
01:16:33,553 --> 01:16:38,891
I guess I could say that in her way
she has strong feelings...

607
01:16:44,564 --> 01:16:50,945
Sure she does, Michael.
She's crazy about you.

608
01:17:07,712 --> 01:17:14,093
Tell her I'll marry her at six,
if she'll still have me.

609
01:17:14,302 --> 01:17:17,055
Please?

610
01:17:23,311 --> 01:17:27,523
I'll be right... right back.

611
01:17:46,793 --> 01:17:50,463
What did he say?

612
01:17:53,925 --> 01:17:56,844
He said...

613
01:17:59,347 --> 01:18:02,016
"Marry me".

614
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:09,107
Thank God you were here

615
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:13,903
- I got so confused.
- It happens.

616
01:18:14,112 --> 01:18:18,908
- Got a minute?
- What's up?

617
01:18:30,711 --> 01:18:36,843
I'll say this quickly, or I'll have
a coronary and you'll never hear it.

618
01:18:37,051 --> 01:18:41,848
This is, by far,
the dumbest thing I've ever done.

619
01:18:42,056 --> 01:18:47,311
So dumb, in fact, that I can't...
But I'm gonna

620
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,440
What's wrong?

621
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:58,030
Michael...
I love you.

622
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:04,412
I've loved you for years, but I was
too arrogant and scared to see it.

623
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,165
Now I'm just scared.

624
01:19:07,373 --> 01:19:10,918
I realise
it's an inopportune time,

625
01:19:11,127 --> 01:19:16,340
but I have
this gigantic favour to ask of you.

626
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:22,972
Choose me. Marry me.
Let me make you happy.

627
01:19:23,181 --> 01:19:28,853
That sounds like three favours,
doesn't it? But...

628
01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:54,837
Kim

629
01:19:58,049 --> 01:20:01,135
Michael

630
01:20:08,768 --> 01:20:12,814
They're lovely together

631
01:20:14,774 --> 01:20:18,736
That's our maid of honour.
She's from New York.

632
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:39,966
Michael, wait
You'll never catch her.

633
01:20:42,802 --> 01:20:48,015
Doesn't anybody leave their car
unlocked? Nobody trusts anyone

634
01:20:48,224 --> 01:20:51,436
Ah, a good Samaritan.

635
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:06,200
"Shy tendrils of russet pleasure
began their unbidden journey".

636
01:21:06,409 --> 01:21:12,540
"She moaned. The tonnage of years
of anguish, sacrifice, mingling..."

637
01:21:12,749 --> 01:21:15,001
It is not going well

638
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:19,338
This is what comes
Of telling the truth!

639
01:21:19,547 --> 01:21:22,467
- Justice isn't fair!
- Where are you?

640
01:21:22,675 --> 01:21:26,888
I've stolen a bread van.
I'm chasing Michael on Michigan Ave.

641
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:33,102
It's all your fault I told him
I loved him, and I kissed him.

642
01:21:33,311 --> 01:21:39,650
- Jules, did Michael kiss you back?
- We were lip-to-lip

643
01:21:39,859 --> 01:21:46,908
- But did it give you any hope?
- We were interrupted.

644
01:21:47,075 --> 01:21:52,163
- By who?
- Kimmy. Now he's chasing her.

645
01:21:52,371 --> 01:21:55,625
Michael's chasing Kimmy.
You're chasing Michael.

646
01:21:55,833 --> 01:22:00,296
Who's chasing you? Nobody
There's your answer.

647
01:22:00,463 --> 01:22:02,548
You're not the one

648
01:22:02,757 --> 01:22:06,719
The wedding is at six p.m.

649
01:22:06,928 --> 01:22:11,224
You have a small opportunity
to do the right thing.

650
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:16,938
George?

651
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:46,926
All aboard

652
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:58,289
I have a confession to make.
Another confession.

653
01:24:01,959 --> 01:24:08,591
Besides that I love you.
This is even worse.

654
01:24:13,638 --> 01:24:18,851
The e-mail that Walter sent
to your boss...

655
01:24:22,313 --> 01:24:24,482
I wrote that.

656
01:24:24,482 --> 01:24:26,025
I wrote that.

657
01:24:27,443 --> 01:24:30,196
I'm the bad guy.

658
01:24:30,363 --> 01:24:35,493
Are you crazy?
Jules, are you completely insane?

659
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:40,665
I mean...
Jules, how could you do that?

660
01:24:40,873 --> 01:24:44,210
It wasn't supposed to get sent.

661
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:48,548
I just wanted you
to get mad at Kimmy.

662
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:04,188
I've done nothing but underhand,
despicable things since I got here.

663
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,902
I was...

664
01:25:10,778 --> 01:25:15,366
I was just trying to...

665
01:25:15,575 --> 01:25:20,913
win you... win you back.

666
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:27,211
But that doesn't excuse any of it.
I'm pond scum.

667
01:25:29,005 --> 01:25:35,720
Lower, actually. I'm like
the fungus that feeds on pond scum.

668
01:25:35,928 --> 01:25:39,015
Lower.

669
01:25:40,058 --> 01:25:43,144
The pus, that infects the mucus,

670
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:49,484
that cruds up the fungus,
that feeds on the pond scum.

671
01:25:55,323 --> 01:25:58,493
On the other hand...

672
01:26:00,286 --> 01:26:05,792
Thank you.
For loving me that much.

673
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:11,214
That way, it's pretty flattering.

674
01:26:11,422 --> 01:26:14,842
Except it makes me fungus.

675
01:26:15,051 --> 01:26:19,430
Well, that part I knew.

676
01:26:29,899 --> 01:26:32,735
God

677
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:39,867
I'm glad
you didn't get on that train.

678
01:26:40,076 --> 01:26:44,831
I came here looking for her.

679
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:51,462
- Why would she be here?
- This is where I proposed.

680
01:26:51,671 --> 01:26:56,467
I had to cover a game in Milwaukee.
She saw me off.

681
01:26:56,676 --> 01:27:01,764
The train was starting to leave...

682
01:27:01,973 --> 01:27:06,269
I jumped up on the step
and held the handle.

683
01:27:06,436 --> 01:27:12,358
Without a thought in my head,
I just shouted, "Marry me"

684
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:20,575
And the train was pulling out,
and she suddenly screamed, 'Yes"

685
01:27:21,784 --> 01:27:24,162
Just once.

686
01:27:25,788 --> 01:27:30,001
And blew me a kiss.

687
01:27:40,303 --> 01:27:43,723
It would have been a nice wedding.

688
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:47,810
You can't believe you've lost her

689
01:27:48,019 --> 01:27:52,523
You'll find her,
and see all that love in her eyes.

690
01:27:52,732 --> 01:27:57,320
I just hope it's soon, or I'd hate
to be you at six o'clock.

691
01:27:57,528 --> 01:28:04,994
Wait. We'll split up. Go to every
romantic place the two of you have.

692
01:28:05,203 --> 01:28:12,710
And I'll go... someplace brilliant.
We'll find her. We will find her

693
01:28:16,464 --> 01:28:21,177
- Wallace residence.
- Have you heard from Kimmy?

694
01:28:21,386 --> 01:28:26,224
- She slipped out in the commotion.
- Commotion?

695
01:28:26,432 --> 01:28:31,479
My sister licked an ice sculpture
and her tongue froze to it.

696
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:34,857
- That's a commotion?
- It's a sculpture of the "David".

697
01:28:35,066 --> 01:28:40,321
- And so Kimmy would be...
- Probably with Michael, doing it.

698
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:47,578
Or else crying in Comiskey Park.
Some guy said he saw her there.

699
01:28:50,665 --> 01:28:55,294
Can you bring my dress to the
church? I have to get something.

700
01:28:55,503 --> 01:28:59,632
Don't forget to shave.

701
01:28:59,841 --> 01:29:02,927
Here's the hair dryer.

702
01:29:03,094 --> 01:29:07,932
It's going to be okay.
No pictures, please

703
01:29:21,154 --> 01:29:24,657
Kimmy

704
01:29:24,866 --> 01:29:31,414
- I know you're in here.
- Leave me alone, you bitch

705
01:29:38,004 --> 01:29:40,840
Who the hell do you think you are?

706
01:29:41,049 --> 01:29:45,094
- Cat fight
- You pretended to be my friend.

707
01:29:45,303 --> 01:29:50,975
- And I made you maid of honour.
- Who asked you to do that?

708
01:29:51,142 --> 01:29:57,231
- Michael trusted you, so I did.
- You didn't trust me for a second.

709
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,902
- I was right.
- Yes, but that's not my fault.

710
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:06,449
You kissed him At my parents'
house On my wedding day

711
01:30:06,616 --> 01:30:11,704
- Tramp
- Shut up

712
01:30:11,913 --> 01:30:18,336
I'm not giving this man up to some
two-faced, big-haired food critic.

713
01:30:22,715 --> 01:30:27,428
All right, I kissed him

714
01:30:27,637 --> 01:30:32,433
I tried to steal him.

715
01:30:35,436 --> 01:30:39,190
I lost.

716
01:30:42,235 --> 01:30:48,741
He doesn't love me.
He loves you.

717
01:30:51,702 --> 01:30:59,711
I haven't done much that
I'm proud of the last three days.

718
01:31:00,795 --> 01:31:04,090
I'd like to take you to the church.

719
01:31:04,298 --> 01:31:11,097
So you can walk down that aisle,
and marry the man of our dreams.

720
01:31:11,305 --> 01:31:15,435
Because he sure wants to marry you.

721
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:11,884
So let's wish Mike and Kim
every happiness,

722
01:33:12,093 --> 01:33:17,765
for a long and happy life,
filled with...

723
01:33:17,974 --> 01:33:20,143
happiness.

724
01:33:21,644 --> 01:33:26,774
- I guess that's it.
- To the bride and groom

725
01:33:31,863 --> 01:33:37,785
Now let's hear from the maid
of honour, the lovely Julianne.

726
01:33:45,418 --> 01:33:49,464
I had the strangest dream.

727
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:55,803
I dreamed that some psychopath
was trying to break you two up.

728
01:33:59,974 --> 01:34:06,230
Luckily, I woke up, and I see...

729
01:34:06,439 --> 01:34:11,235
that the world is
just as it should be.

730
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:20,620
My best friend
has won the best woman.

731
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:34,675
I didn't get you a gift...

732
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:37,595
However...

733
01:34:37,762 --> 01:34:41,307
this is on loan...

734
01:34:42,433 --> 01:34:47,188
until you two find your song.

735
01:36:06,434 --> 01:36:10,563
- It's mine
- I don't think so.

736
01:36:12,899 --> 01:36:17,195
I got it

737
01:36:44,222 --> 01:36:47,934
Bye

738
01:37:32,437 --> 01:37:36,107
- Hello, George.
- Having a good time?

739
01:37:36,315 --> 01:37:41,654
- No, but I did what I came to do.
- You split them up?

740
01:37:41,863 --> 01:37:46,242
- No, I said goodbye.
- Good girl, I'm proud of you.

741
01:37:46,409 --> 01:37:50,705
- But you should be dancing.
- I have big plans for that.

742
01:37:50,913 --> 01:37:54,709
Just give me 30-35 years.

743
01:37:54,917 --> 01:38:00,923
The misery, the exquisite tragedy,
the Susan Hayward of it all.

744
01:38:01,132 --> 01:38:04,552
I can picture you sitting alone
in your lavender gown.

745
01:38:04,761 --> 01:38:09,307
- Did I tell you it was lavender?
- You haven't touched your cake.

746
01:38:09,515 --> 01:38:15,980
Probably drumming your fingernails
on the white linen table cloth.

747
01:38:16,189 --> 01:38:21,944
Perhaps even thinking,
I should have had that manicure!

748
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:26,657
- But it's too late now!
- I didn't tell you it was lavender

749
01:38:26,866 --> 01:38:30,703
Suddenly, a familiar song...

750
01:38:33,956 --> 01:38:38,878
And you're off your chair
in one exquisite movement

751
01:38:39,087 --> 01:38:45,343
wondering, searching,
sniffing the wind like a deer.

752
01:38:45,551 --> 01:38:50,056
Has God heard your prayer?.
Will Cinderella dance again?

753
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:55,686
Then suddenly, the crowds part

754
01:38:55,853 --> 01:38:58,689
and there he is.

755
01:38:58,898 --> 01:39:01,901
Sleek, stylish,

756
01:39:02,068 --> 01:39:07,740
adiant with charisma.
Bizarrely, he's on the telephone.

757
01:39:07,907 --> 01:39:11,869
But then, so are you.

758
01:39:12,078 --> 01:39:16,207
And he comes towards you,

759
01:39:16,374 --> 01:39:19,210
like a jungle cat

760
01:39:19,419 --> 01:39:24,757
And even though you correctly sense
that he is... gay,

761
01:39:24,924 --> 01:39:29,887
like most devastatingly handsome
single men,

762
01:39:30,096 --> 01:39:37,353
you think,
'What the hell, life goes on".

763
01:39:37,562 --> 01:39:39,939
Maybe there won't be marriage.

764
01:39:40,148 --> 01:39:43,484
Maybe there won't be sex.

765
01:39:43,693 --> 01:39:48,614
But, by God, there'll be dancing

766
01:40:05,965 --> 01:40:09,886
Bond. Jane Bond.
