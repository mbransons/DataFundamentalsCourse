1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,474
<i>A million baby kisses I'll deliver</i>

3
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,634
<i>If you will only sing the</i> Swanee River

4
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,311
<i>Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby</i>

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,271
<i>With a Dixie melody</i>

6
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,998
- Julie?
- She has left, sir.

7
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,950
- When? Where to? Was she packed?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,798
- How long ago?
- About half an hour ago.

9
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,230
- Do you know where, Henry?
- All I know is the airport.

10
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,358
- New York.
- She wouldn't let me take her...

11
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,597
Thanks. Steve, see what you can get me
on the next plane out of here.

12
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,837
Do it, will you?
Henry, get me some stuff in a bag.

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,199
I don't get it.

14
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,076
If something was on her mind,
why not wait and talk?

15
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,032
You don't just get up and go.
It does not make sense.

16
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,836
And my pal Steve lets me stand out there
and sing my brains out for another hour.

17
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,234
Why doesn't he tell me?

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,239
Haven't I got a right to know
when she gets a crazy notion like this?

19
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
- Do you think it was so sudden?
- What else?

20
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,917
I am thinking of the questions
she asked tonight.

21
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,555
- What questions?
- Were you happy?

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,069
Did you think of singing anymore?

23
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,156
I have told her a thousand times.

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,078
You told her,
and tonight she heard you sing.

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,389
So what?

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,158
You saw it coming, Papa.
And Steve, everybody but me.

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,038
All right, so I sang.

28
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,116
The crowd was yelling,
she told me to go ahead.

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,071
So I got wound up a little.

30
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,350
I told her, it does not mean
a thing to me anymore.

31
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,948
I was happy this way, the way we were.

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,358
- Steve, how about it?
- Give me time, will you?

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,676
It is going to be all right, Mamma.

34
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,109
I hate to run away like this
on your anniversary party.

35
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,516
If not for my party,
if I did not have to see a night club...

36
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,550
Mamma...

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,114
Fine! Now we got tears,
everything is solved.

38
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,834
- Congratulations, Mamma.
- Mamma, don't be silly.

39
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,315
Don't you see,
whether we'd had the party or not...

40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,432
You're all set. If you're going to make it,
you better get going.

41
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,399
It's ready, sir.

42
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,839
Goodbye, Mamma.

43
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,752
I do not know how long I will be gone.
If I do not get back soon...

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,838
anytime you want to go home,
Steve will take care of everything.

45
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,394
And I will see you in Washington, maybe.

46
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,796
Take care of yourself, Mamma.
You, too, Papa.

47
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,352
So long, Tom, Steve.

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,358
Wait a second,
I am driving you to the airport.

49
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,316
<i>You may think you mean it, Al...</i>

50
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,193
<i>but you will never be happy</i>
<i>away from show business.</i>

51
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,710
<i>And someday, if I ever feel</i>
<i>you quit just for my sake...</i>

52
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,156
<i>if I am ever sure you want to sing,</i>
<i>more than you want me...</i>

53
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,994
No, I am telling you, Steve,
there is not a trace of her.

54
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,714
She got here all right,
but didn't check in anyplace.

55
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,195
I have turned the town upside down.

56
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,471
She hopped in a car, I guess,
and just disappeared.

57
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,439
Steve, I need you.
How about you coming here?

58
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,233
<i>- I will be there tomorrow.</i>
- Good, I am waiting for you.

59
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,112
<i>- So long, Al.</i>
- So long.

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,791
Maybe I don't know my own mind,
but she was what I wanted.

61
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,515
The only thing I ever got for myself
outside of show racket.

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,553
But I guess I've just been kidding myself.

63
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,759
Love, a girl, a couple of words
I must have picked up out of a song.

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,513
If she says so,
I've been dying to sing all the time.

65
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,108
All I ever wanted was a cheering mob.

66
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,557
I will say this about the cheering mob:
That was love, brother.

67
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,353
For 20 years,
nobody ever walked out on me.

68
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,472
Okay, if she says so, I am back where I was.
Singing for a living.

69
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,471
And it ain't a bad feeling.

70
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,956
The only question now is:
How fast can I get back to work?

71
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,197
Tom, that script of yours
I read the other day back home, it's good.

72
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,472
That's the show I'd like to do, if you'll
take a chance with a character like me.

73
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,154
- I'll consider it.
- I want to start right away.

74
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,316
- First thing tomorrow.
- Why not tonight?

75
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,874
Why don't we kick it around?
Where's the script?

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,195
- I don't walk around with it.
- Let us get it.

77
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,311
Why didn't I bring the one
we had in California?

78
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,793
You mean this one?

79
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,034
You dog. Come to papa.

80
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,510
<i>Is it true what they say about Dixie?</i>

81
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,150
<i>Does the sun really shine all the time?</i>

82
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,952
<i>Do the sweet magnolias blossom</i>
<i>at everybody's door?</i>

83
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,159
<i>And do folks keep eating possum</i>
<i>till they can't eat no more?</i>

84
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,996
<i>Is it true what they say about Swanee?</i>

85
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,596
<i>Is a dream by that stream so sublime?</i>

86
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,231
<i>Do they laugh, do they love</i>
<i>like they do in every song?</i>

87
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,319
<i>If it's true, that is where I belong</i>

88
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,392
<i>I said do they laugh</i>

89
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,473
<i>Do they love</i>

90
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,557
<i>like they do in every song?</i>

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,228
That's pretty.

92
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,560
<i>If it's true, that is where I belong</i>

93
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,159
Al, you're on.

94
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,349
<i>The bells are ringing for me and my gal</i>

95
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,309
<i>The birds are singing for me and my gal</i>

96
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,273
<i>Everybody's been knowing</i>
<i>to a wedding they are going</i>

97
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,710
<i>And for weeks they've been sewing</i>
<i>every Susie and Sal</i>

98
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,708
<i>They are congregating for me and my gal</i>

99
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,351
<i>The parson is waiting for me and my gal</i>

100
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,558
<i>And sometime, I am going to build</i>
<i>a little home for two</i>

101
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,716
<i>for three or four or more</i>

102
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,993
<i>In Loveland, for me and my gal</i>

103
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,709
<i>The bells are ringing for me and my gal</i>

104
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,349
<i>The birds are singing for me and my gal</i>

105
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,711
<i>And sometime, I am going to build</i>
<i>a little home for two</i>

106
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,717
<i>or three or four or more</i>

107
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,834
<i>In Loveland, for me and my gal</i>

108
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,553
If you do not mind, that's all tonight.

109
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,079
What's the matter, Al?

110
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,074
Go on with the show.
Leave me out of the finale.

111
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,871
I tell you, nothing is the matter.
Just comes a night that...

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,956
How long can you go on
knocking yourself out?

113
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,230
For what? Their $4 and their applause?

114
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,076
Holy smoke! Don't know what hit me.

115
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,795
- I never walked off like that in my life.
- What's the matter, Al?

116
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,511
I just can't take it anymore.
I used to live for this.

117
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,193
The kick is gone. It is just hard work now.

118
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,829
So what am I killing myself for?
What am I getting out of it?

119
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,633
You were always telling me,
how about something for myself?

120
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,150
How about it? That's what I want now,
some laughs, fun.

121
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,599
Just for me.

122
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,072
What happened to you?

123
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,751
Sit down, Tom.
I think we got some news for you.

124
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,957
The boy is sick, Papa.
This he tries to hide from us.

125
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,914
- Papa, you agree or not?
- I agree.

126
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,559
So why do you sit?

127
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,558
Because it is a sickness not for doctors.

128
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,632
Please, no riddles.

129
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,032
Mamma, just go on pasting
in Asa's scrapbook.

130
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,593
You will understand.

131
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,318
Where will he get
a good Jewish meal over there, Papa?

132
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,230
Mamma, without Jewish meals,
Gentiles are surviving year after year.

133
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,508
Monte Carlo.

134
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,837
Before they take your money away,
they make you dress up yet.

135
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,519
I saw a dozen bluebirds today
in the back yard. And he is looking.

136
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,876
A girl with Asa. Who is it?

137
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,515
And if you knew, Mamma,
what would you know?

138
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,152
- Again a new girl.
- Mamma, with a man it's only natural.

139
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,517
- This is soup.
- Eat. You'll have another plate.

140
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,309
You don't know, Steve,
how we appreciate your visits.

141
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,112
I just come for the food.

142
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,271
For what it costs to come from New York...

143
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,470
you could buy a better meal than this.

144
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,998
So, this winter,
it's again Florida for Asa.

145
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,430
- He's having a great time.
- Yeah, so he always says.

146
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,557
Wait, do you hear? The radio.

147
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,355
All day long, a Mr. Bing Crosby.

148
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,996
Yes, he's doing all right.

149
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,870
Crooning.

150
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,196
- Very good.
- That's also singing.

151
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,075
And the name "Bing." Go explain people.

152
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,709
- But he's got something.
- Yes.

153
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,959
He's got something.

154
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,709
There was a time they played Asa's records.
That was a joy.

155
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,715
But for years now,
you would think Asa isn't alive anymore.

156
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,473
All right, Mamma.

157
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,993
We're eating, not singing. Give him the fish.

158
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,599
This week it's very good, Steve.
And a little horseradish?

159
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,989
There. But be careful.

160
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,153
Don't worry. This stuff got me once.
But I take it easy now.

161
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,874
Very easy.

162
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,273
I am afraid this week it was extra strong.

163
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,108
On his back, Papa. I'll bring the chicken.

164
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,236
Buying a horse, that I understand.

165
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,115
But buying a fighter, a human being.
How is this, Papa?

166
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,199
Foolishness, a tragedy, that's how it is.

167
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,357
A whole world is on fire,
a Hitler swallows nations...

168
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,952
millions of our people driven, tortured,
killed like flies.

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,150
You do not want to sing, all right.

170
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,834
But horses, fighters!

171
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,348
Hello, Cantor. This is Steve.

172
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,677
Tell me first, is Mamma any better?

173
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,674
I am afraid not.
The pneumonia came so fast.

174
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,869
Did you reach Asa?

175
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,470
No. I called Havana twice.
He is off cruising on somebody's boat.

176
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,875
They are getting in touch with him by radio.

177
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,629
I don't know how long it'll take him
to sail back to Havana and catch a plane.

178
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,639
- You will keep trying, please.
- Sure I will.

179
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,836
Thank you very much, Steve.

180
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,355
Bye.

181
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,392
You all right, Papa?

182
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,232
I wish I had been here.

183
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,432
She understood, Asa.

184
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,150
No sense to feel sorry.

185
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,671
That was a prayer for Mamma.

186
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,116
For Mamma, and all our people.

187
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,919
For their suffering, like millions today.

188
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,355
I know.

189
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,310
You do?

190
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,708
Come, Asa.

191
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,149
Sit down, Asa.

192
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,716
I'll get you something, something to eat,
or maybe a cold drink.

193
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,674
No, thanks, Papa, I don't want anything.

194
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,952
- Who looks after you here now?
- Someone comes in.

195
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,875
It is all arranged.
I think I have to lie down for a few minutes.

196
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,752
- Just on the couch.
- Sure, go ahead.

197
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,155
- Just a few minutes. You'll stay?
- Of course I will.

198
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,078
- I am going to call Steve in New York.
- Fine.

199
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,190
How about coming away with me
for a while?

200
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,959
- Take a little trip somewhere.
- We are in the war now.

201
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,231
- This is no time for trips.
- A week or so, just for a change.

202
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,474
Thank you.

203
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,792
But prize fights, racetracks,
that change I wouldn't need.

204
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,397
- Why do you say that, Papa?
- I merely said a fact.

205
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,235
- You hate everything I've been doing.
- It's your life to throw away.

206
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,871
What do you want me to do?

207
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,277
Who can tell another man?

208
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,398
You want me to get in the war
and fight at my age?

209
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,829
A man finds ways to do everything.

210
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,159
But if he is so busy fighting himself...

211
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,398
We will talk later.

212
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,355
Hello?

213
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,992
Oh, he's not? Will he... Come in.

214
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,518
Leave word for Mr. Martin
to call Washington, this number...

215
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,232
anytime before 11:00.

216
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,995
- That's right. Thanks.
- I'll do that.

217
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,194
Why, you...

218
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,236
Hello, Al.

219
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,839
- How are you?
- Fine.

220
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,429
- When did you get in?
- About an hour ago.

221
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,835
- How is Papa doing?
- Pretty good, Steve.

222
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,715
He is taking a nap in there, right now.

223
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,593
Yeah, he is fine.

224
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,751
Sit down, tell me the news.

225
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,997
- What are you doing around here?
- I got a date in 15 minutes.

226
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,599
This time of night?

227
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,951
I flew down to see a bunch of generals
at the war department.

228
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,514
- Who?
- Son, I have enlisted.

229
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,428
Enlisted! Why you're four times
older than I am!

230
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,791
- Don't tell me you're going to fight.
- Sure, from behind a desk.

231
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,799
- Quit kidding. What is this about?
- Entertainment for the kids overseas.

232
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,388
- Getting shows together?
- A little more than that.

233
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,751
You see, lots of entertainers
are over there now. Good talent.

234
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,235
But they got to have more, and the best.

235
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,512
Those kids are stuck away in
Pacific jungles, Aleutians, Africa, Iceland.

236
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,148
It'd be a terrific boost to morale
if they could get the top names to go over.

237
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,714
The biggest performers in the country.

238
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,070
That is the job they want me to tackle.

239
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,193
I guess they figured
if I could manage Jolson for 20 years...

240
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,992
I can lick anything.

241
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,432
Yeah, they're right.
You won't have any trouble, Steve.

242
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,835
Big name stars will go
once they know what's needed.

243
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,633
It's just a question of getting
a few of them to lead the way.

244
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,435
Sure. Darned big job, Steve.
I am proud of you.

245
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,239
Save it, pal.

246
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,754
You know, seven or eight years ago...

247
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,635
I could've been the guy
to start this thing off.

248
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,718
- What's the matter with now?
- Don't be silly.

249
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,278
These kids are hep.
They want the stuff they heard back home.

250
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,517
The top guys they know.
How many of them know me now?

251
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,315
But everybody in show business does.
And they have followed you before.

252
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,357
I'm thinking of the kids.

253
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,436
You know, I better get going.

254
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,109
- See you here later?
- Yeah.

255
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,994
So long, Al.

256
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,277
Maybe I'll walk over with you.

257
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,114
All right, boys, hold it. Hold it.

258
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,235
We are going to have a lot of fun tonight.

259
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,830
They've been telling us we're gonna
get some big entertainers up here.

260
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,191
And believe it or not,
we've got one of them with us right now.

261
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,869
In fact, when I heard this man was coming,
I said:

262
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,629
"They are making good in a big way."

263
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,030
I don't know what the name means to you...

264
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,675
but when I was your age,
it meant the world's greatest entertainer.

265
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,028
Al Jolson.

266
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,877
Thanks, Colonel.
If I am half as good as that send-off...

267
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,389
I may leave here a second lieutenant.

268
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,271
Hello, gang. I sing.

269
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,036
If you don't believe me,
write and ask your grandmothers.

270
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,510
It is wonderful working for guys like you...

271
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,189
'cause if you don't like it,
where can you go? It is me or nothing.

272
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,912
All kidding aside, fellows...

273
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,669
my stuff isn't what you were hearing
back home when you left...

274
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,077
but you might like an old one,
the way they used to do them.

275
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,628
Orchestra.

276
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,718
<i>We leave home expecting to find a bluebird</i>

277
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,635
<i>Hoping every cloud will be silver-lined</i>

278
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,790
<i>But we all return</i>

279
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,073
<i>And as we live, we learn</i>

280
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,151
<i>That we left our happiness behind</i>

281
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,388
<i>The bird with</i>

282
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,478
<i>feathers of blue</i>

283
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,035
<i>Is waiting for you</i>

284
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,473
<i>Back in your own backyard</i>

285
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,554
<i>You'll see your castle in Spain</i>

286
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,031
<i>Through your windowpane</i>

287
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,190
<i>Back in your own backyard</i>

288
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,912
<i>Oh, you can go to the east</i>
<i>Go to the west</i>

289
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,637
<i>Someday you'll come</i>

290
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,472
<i>Weary at heart</i>

291
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,433
<i>Back where you started from</i>

292
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,399
<i>You'll find your happiness lies</i>

293
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,399
<i>Right under your eyes</i>

294
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,677
<i>Back in your own backyard</i>

295
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,676
Big boot singing to those kids tonight.

296
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,870
I guess they thought I was a little old-timey.

297
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,275
They loved it. You heard them yell.

298
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,915
Yeah, I guess, it was just the idea
of something from home.

299
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,309
- Is that my plane?
- They'll call you.

300
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,437
- You ought to relax.
- How do you do that, Colonel?

301
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,437
It is kind of tough doing this,
after laying off a long time...

302
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,949
and not sure you're getting over,
that's what kills you.

303
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,277
You did not get over any better in Duluth,
20 years ago.

304
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,999
- Minnesota, that's where I first heard you.
- Well, I'll be darned.

305
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,788
- The old Lyceum Theatre.
- That's right.

306
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,951
It gets a little chilly in Duluth.

307
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,072
I played hooky from high school once
to see <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.

308
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,872
Oh, boy. That's going way back.

309
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,037
To me, you were the greatest thing
that ever lived.

310
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,475
Thanks.

311
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,110
Did you sneak in
that afternoon or did you pay?

312
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,231
- Pay.
- Then that's all right.

313
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,192
First time I hit New York, the only thing
I wanted to do was go to the theatre...

314
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,435
to see you.

315
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,037
Now I understand about tonight.
You're just an old fan.

316
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,355
I could've knocked you over
reciting <i>Little Bo Peep</i>.

317
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,674
Yeah, you could.

318
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,830
- Ready to take off, sir.
- Thank you.

319
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,113
Well, here we go.

320
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,954
Look, Colonel,
tell the boys I'll try to get back.

321
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,312
Tell them a lot of big stars
will be along soon, but not to forget me.

322
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,193
They'll never forget
you were one of the early ones.

323
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,878
That is something.

324
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,878
Colonel Bryant, you've been wonderful.

325
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,753
- Hope we meet up someday back home.
- I hope we do.

326
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,119
In fact, if you are ever in Hollywood...

327
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,511
- Hollywood? Movies?
- I produced a few.

328
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,879
That's a funny one.

329
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,113
- I played in a few of them in my time.
- I remember every one of them.

330
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,511
I'm afraid I do, too.
So long, Duluth. Good luck.

331
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,835
So long, Mr. Jolson. Good luck to you.

332
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,873
<i>I'm looking over a four-leaf clover</i>

333
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,476
<i>That I overlooked before</i>

334
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,632
<i>One leaf is sunshine, the second is rain</i>

335
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,112
<i>Third is the roses that grow in the lane</i>

336
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,678
<i>No need explaining, the one remaining</i>

337
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,475
<i>Is someone that I adore</i>

338
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,798
<i>I'm looking over a four-leaf clover</i>

339
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,958
<i>That I overlooked before</i>

00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,629

341

<i>When he starts throbbing</i>

342
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,878
<i>His own sweet song</i>

343
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,709
<i>Oh, wake up, you sleepy head, get up</i>

344
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,999
<i>Get out of bed, cheer up</i>

345
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,231
<i>The sun is red</i>
<i>Live, love, laugh, and be happy</i>

346
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,672
<i>What if I'd been blue?</i>
<i>Now I am walking through fields of flowers</i>

347
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,198
<i>Rain may glisten</i>
<i>but still I listen for hours and hours</i>

348
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,314
<i>I'm just a kid again</i>
<i>Doing what I did again</i>

349
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,998

353
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,993
<i>Remember me to Herald Square</i>

354
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,872

<i>Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown</i>

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,909
<i>Hearts seem light, and life seems bright</i>

367
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,639
<i>In dreamy, dreamy China</i>
<i>Dreamy, dreamy China</i>

368
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,589
<i>China, Chinatown</i>

369
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,118
<i>I'm just wild about Harry</i>

370
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,190
<i>Harry's wild about me</i>

371
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,792
<i>The heavenly blisses of his kisses</i>

372
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,917
<i>fill me with ecstasy</i>

373
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,114
<i>He's sweet just like chocolate candy</i>

374
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,156
<i>and like honey from the bee</i>

375
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,798
<i>I'm just wild about Harry</i>

376
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,113
<i>Harry's wild about, I can't live without</i>

377
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,999
<i>Harry's wild about me</i>

378
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,516
<i>And like honey from the bee</i>

379
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,038
<i>Say, I'm just wild about Harry</i>

380
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,393
<i>Harry's wild about, I can't live without</i>

381
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,196
<i>Harry's wild about me</i>

382
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,356
<i>Tie everything down.</i>
<i>We are coming in to New York.</i>

383
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,037
Come on, let's wake up.

384
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,754
That's right.

385
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,591
<i>Baby face, you got the cutest little</i>

386
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,470
I'd say he was going to be just fine.

387
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,599
- When did they bring me back?
- Night before last.

388
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,869
Let's get some more of this down
before we talk.

389
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,629
- What was it that hit me?
- A little fever you picked up way back.

390
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,436
- You know, I have seen you someplace.
- You certainly have.

391
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,198
- Where?
- Right here.

392
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,639
- When?
- This morning.

393
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,955
- This morning?
- When you woke up.

394
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,636
I wouldn't forget you. You're pretty.

395
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,913
Just a baby face.

396
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,077
- How do you know?
- You told me.

397
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,791
- Me? When?
- This morning.

398
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,628
- I said that?
- My friend, you sang it.

399
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,590
- Do you have to keep doing that?
- Do you have to keep talking?

400
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,951
- I sang it?
- More or less.

401
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,078
- How was I, in good voice?
- You can do better, I imagine.

402
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,514
You wouldn't know yourself.
You never heard me sing.

403
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,358
Well, to be honest with you.

404
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,878
- That was before your time, honey.
- A little bit.

405
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,992
Of course, you might have come across me
in the history books.

406
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,635
Now, I wouldn't say that.
I remember my folks talking about you.

407
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,278
I'd like to meet them.

408
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,790
But I don't imagine
I would be finding them up north.

409
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,353
No, you wouldn't,
you would be finding them in Arkansas.

410
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,870
Their name is Clark.
Their daughter's name is Ellen. Ellen Clark.

411
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,549
It saves a lot more questions, doesn't it?

412
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,795
Sure does.

413
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,912
Now we're going to lie back
and take a nice, long rest.

414
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,554
- Honey, there's somebody I got to talk to.
- Tomorrow.

415
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,353
Look, I just want to let Steve Martin
know I am all right.

416
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,675
Mr. Martin knows. So does Papa.

417
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,037
- Papa? He is here, too?
- He is positively darling.

418
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,355
- Where are they? I want to see them.
- Tomorrow.

419
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,632
Now look, baby, as far as I'm concerned,
tomorrow's always the middle of next year.

420
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,991
Rushing around like that
is just about the worst thing for anybody.

421
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,189
You don't say.

422
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,311
You are bound to do
most everything wrong.

423
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,590
Thanks, honey. Arkansas may feel that way...

424
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,633
Now, you take animals back on the farm,
pigs for instance, never rushing around...

425
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,548
except, of course, if they see a sudden
big shadow, an airplane or a hawk...

426
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,069
that scares them
and gets them all confused.

427
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,954
I've always believed people who
rush around get confused the same way.

428
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,551
You were going to say something?

429
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,470
Yeah. I wouldn't care to see anybody today.

430
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,151
Just as you say, Mr. Jolson.

431
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,195
My, we'll soon be smart as pigs.

432
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,632
- Hello, Papa.
- Asa.

433
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,716
- Steve.
- Jolson, loafing in bed.

434
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,434
He looks fine.
I would positively know him anyplace.

435
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,870
What gets me is how they tell a fever
from his normal condition.

436
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,877
- How do you feel, Asa?
- Okay.

437
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,117
- You had quite a tour for yourself?
- I gave it a whirl.

438
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,832
Too big a whirl maybe.

439
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,270
Tell them I'll be okay in a couple of weeks
and ready to hop off again.

440
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,674
That is not wise, Asa.

441
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,155
In fact, it sounds positively silly to me.

442
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,910
Boys as sick as he's been are sent away
someplace for six months to rest.

443
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,554
- Now, look...
- See? Ellen thinks so, too.

444
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,233
- So it is Ellen already.
- Papa doesn't lose a minute.

445
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,396
And, just what do you call him?

446
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,030
- Cantor, mostly.
- So far, that is.

447
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,714
That fever is going to be
in his system a long while.

448
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,195
If he goes hopping around,
he's apt to come down bad.

449
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,629
Where do you get
all those big answers, honey?

450
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,593
By just relaxing, which is what
you ought to do for a change.

451
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,518
Oh, brother!
You mean like back home, maybe?

452
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,119
First thing my folks do almost anytime,
we just sit down and take off our shoes.

453
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,118
Sister, his socks are even off
and that ain't helping.

454
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,199
If he'd just forget how important he is
for once, he might do a sensible thing.

455
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,709
- What do you mean by that?
- Just what I said.

456
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,159
Now listen, sweetheart...

457
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,477
whenever I've had a job to do,
I've always done it, see.

458
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,953
That's what I mean.

459
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,071
However, I just came in to say goodbye.

460
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,918
- Goodbye?
- Where are you going?

461
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,715
I'm transferred to an army hospital
in Arkansas. I'm leaving in the morning.

462
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,912
- Walking out on me?
- You'll be just fine.

463
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,236
You mean I won't be seeing you again?

464
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,875
I go off duty in a few minutes,
and I'll have to pack the rest of the night.

465
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,956
- Goodbye, Mr. Martin.
- Good luck, Ellen.

466
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,992
You can't make cracks at me
and walk out. I want to talk to you.

467
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,554
- I really won't have time.
- That is too bad...

468
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,878
because I thought on your last evening,
how nice if we could have dinner together.

469
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,029
- Now, I will have to have dinner, won't I?
- Delightful.

470
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,158
- At 7:00, shall we say?
- That'll be just fine.

471
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,119
- And for dessert, Ellen?
- No dessert, just coffee, Papa.

472
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,238
- Thank you.
- How will your daughter have her steak?

473
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,349
Rare.

474
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,829
Not my daughter, a friend.

475
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,549
- I beg your pardon.
- "Papa," you see...

476
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,397
- is a certain kind of modern term.
- I understand, sir.

477
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,674
He understands.

478
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,717
- Is this the kind of place you wanted?
- Exactly. Why not?

479
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,113
- A little swanky.
- That's me tonight, swanky.

480
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,359
You know, a waltz is my speciality.

481
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,717
Of course, mine is not exactly
a cheek-to-cheek style...

482
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,308
- but if you would honour me?
- I'd love it.

483
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,196
But wouldn't you like to say
what you wanted to say to me first?

484
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,513
Remarkable girl.

485
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,478
As a matter of fact,
I only wanted to thank you.

486
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,758
- For what?
- The things you said to my son today.

487
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,119
- A little brutal, wasn't I?
- But delightful.

488
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,151
You know, he's a very nice boy.

489
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,431
Of course, that's a father's opinion.

490
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,909
- You could be right.
- Thank you.

491
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,788
The only thing, he never learned how to live.

492
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,236
You know, there was a look in his eyes
when you spoke to him that way...

493
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,191
that I had never seen before.

494
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,756
To me, it was like the first step
when a baby learns to walk.

495
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,315
- Powerful baby, isn't he?
- Powerful.

496
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,755
And he'll go right on singing
when he shouldn't.

497
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,199
I'm afraid so.

498
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,830
You know, in his condition
that could be bad.

499
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,951
A baby doesn't walk in a day.

500
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,909
But the important thing, I have a feeling
he won't forget what you said.

501
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,556
In fact, if I know my boy,
he will have to see you again.

502
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,158
And if he does...

503
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,075
I do not think I'd mind that at all.

504
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,675
- And now?
- Delighted.

505
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,195
- Is there something wrong?
- Just getting back into my shoes.

506
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,594
Remarkable.

507
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,079
You know, Ellen is right,
and I am through arguing with you.

508
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,751
You're not going overseas again,
and that's all there is to it.

509
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,559
You hear me?

510
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,988
You don't know what a kick it was
to be singing again.

511
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,351
- Sure, I do...
- Listen, I found out something.

512
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,549
I have missed it every day since I quit.

513
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,920
I realise now, I've only been half alive.

514
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,472
All of a sudden I've got a terrific yen...

515
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,759
What do you say, Steve, what if
I want to get back on Broadway again?

516
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,952
- Do you think it is too late?
- What do you mean "too late"?

517
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,479
Don't kid me, pal.

518
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,354
Listen, the parade may pass some guys...

519
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,515
but anytime you want to get back
at the business...

520
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,234
- I wish I could believe it.
- You are crazy.

521
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,793
All right, see what you can dig up
for me, Steve.

522
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,872
A Broadway show, anything.

523
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,276
- Will you go to work on it?
- Sure.

524
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,476
- Right away?
- Yeah, right away.

525
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,309
But meanwhile, you got to promise me
you're not going overseas again.

526
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,910
Okay.

527
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,994
- Now we're getting someplace.
- All right.

528
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,519
I'll stay home, and make a little tour
of these GI hospitals around the country.

529
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,269
Now, wait. Ellen said to knock off everything
for at least six months.

530
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,831
- Ellen did.
- Yeah, Ellen did.

531
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,352
You know, Baby Face could be wrong
about something.

532
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,474
<i>Baby face, you got the cutest little</i>

533
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,716
<i>Oh, you've got a pretty face</i>

534
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,035
<i>There's not another one</i>
<i>could take your place</i>

535
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,991
<i>Ah, baby face</i>

536
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,352
<i>My poor heart is jumping</i>

537
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,869
<i>You sure have started something</i>
<i>Ah, baby face</i>

538
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,519
<i>I'm up in heaven</i>
<i>when I'm in your fond embrace</i>

539
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,837
<i>I didn't need a shove</i>
<i>'Cause I just fell in love</i>

540
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,953
<i>With your pretty, ah, you baby face</i>

541
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,355
<i>Baby face</i>

542
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,599
<i>You got the cutest</i>
<i>Ah, you got a baby face</i>

543
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,554
<i>There is not another one</i>
<i>could take your place</i>

544
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,398
<i>Ah, baby face</i>

545
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,315
<i>My poor heart is jumping, you sure have</i>

546
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,112
<i>Ah, baby face</i>

547
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,119
<i>I'm up in heaven</i>
<i>when I'm in your fond embrace</i>

548
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,556
<i>You're like a breath of spring</i>
<i>When Jolie sings</i>

549
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,873
<i>about your baby face</i>

550
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,472
I don't know why
I'd want to see anybody like you again...

551
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,797
but I couldn't wait to hit this place.
Now, isn't that daffy?

552
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,309
Haven't you been singing too much lately?

553
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,998
That's what I missed about you:

554
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,873
Nobody to boss me around
and give me the answers.

555
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,789
I am glad to see you.
In fact, I've been thinking about you.

556
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,713
And, now and then, this is really daffy...

557
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,590
I found myself thinking,
I could even get romantic about that pest.

558
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,870
You know how your mind
runs away with you at times.

559
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,434
Sure, mine does
with every other man I meet.

560
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,308
It is fun.

561
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,593
- But not exactly fun when I do it.
- Why not?

562
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,990
For instance,
if the gal happens to be young, like you...

563
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,630
I suddenly remember I am not so young.

564
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,116
I don't see what difference years make.

565
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,390
I knew a couple once, same age.

566
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,831
- It was terrible.
- It was?

567
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,596
Then I remember something else.

568
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,711
- I was married once.
- I know.

569
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,431
- I made an awful flop of it.
- Why?

570
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,350
It seems all I cared about was singing.

571
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,630
That didn't give marriage much of a chance.

572
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,513
You're afraid you might do
the same thing again?

573
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,758
- I guess I do not have to worry about that.
- No?

574
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,158
Because I walked out
on all the singing a long time ago.

575
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,759
But you still want to.

576
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,516
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

577
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,189
But the point is, the world
ain't exactly clamouring for me anymore.

578
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,513
Well, now, I am just sure
the world would again, if you wanted it to.

579
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,554
I like you.

580
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,750
And if it does, just see
that you get more out of life than singing.

581
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,031
I will try and remember that, baby,
if it ever happens.

582
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,554
I am afraid I would
need a little help, though.

583
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,877
I might have to ask somebody like you
where to start.

584
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,349
Now, if I am not around,
you just try relaxing.

585
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,479
Take off my shoes?

586
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,310
Anything you get fun out of,
you just go right ahead and do it.

587
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,477
Right now, it would be terrific fun
to kiss you.

588
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,513
Then I would.

589
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,755
What complications, Steve? What is it?

590
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,949
A lung was infected. They had to operate.
Cut out the bad spot.

591
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,392
<i>Now, he's gonna be fine.</i>
<i>He's in good hands.</i>

592
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,591
<i>- Cantor? Hello?</i>
- Yes, Steve.

593
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,558
Believe me, will you?

594
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,830
There is no sense
your making a trip out here.

595
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,952
I'll phone you again tomorrow. Goodbye.

596
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,153
The doc says you got a constitution
like an ox.

597
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,914
You're gonna mend so fast,
nobody will believe it.

598
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,473
Do you know something else?

599
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,354
He says you are as much all there today
as you ever were in your life.

600
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,557
- Hello, Ellen.
- Hello, Steve.

601
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,471
I thought you might be needing
some answers right now.

602
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,670
Just a good lung, baby. Got one of those?

603
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,277
You are breathing, honey.

604
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,318
Now, who would want a man
to do more than that?

605
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,640
I don't believe it. Let me talk to him.

606
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,757
He doesn't believe it.

607
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,912
Hello, Papa. You know this gal
gets her way about everything.

608
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,074
But yesterday, out of the hospital,
today married. Is this wise?

609
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,039
Never mind. It's lovely. Let me talk to her.

610
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,550
Here.

611
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,878
- Hello, Papa.
<i>- Ellen.</i>

612
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,792
It's really "Papa" now.

613
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,149
Yes, it's wonderful.

614
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,599
You should see this ring.

615
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,951
I got some orchids. If they were any bigger,
I couldn't see around them.

616
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,355
I must see both of you.
I am coming out there.

617
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,356
<i>When?</i>

618
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,311
After the high holidays, in two weeks.

619
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,756
Good. We'll have a nice place
waiting for you.

620
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,996
In fact, we are moving into a house today.

621
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,670
- You've got a house already?
- A beautiful one, out in the valley.

622
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,917
It's been rented up to a few months ago,
but we can get into it now.

623
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,837
It's Al's house.

624
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,233
- AI's house?
- Yes, the one Julie built.

625
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,509
<i>Imagine looking for a place in these times.</i>

626
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,951
<i>And one sitting out there,</i>
<i>just as vacant and pretty as can be.</i>

627
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,719
It doesn't make sense,
at least not in Arkansas.

628
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,432
You understand, don't you, Papa?

629
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,754
Yes. I think I do.

630
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,950
You get out here when you said,
in two weeks.

631
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,479
We'll be expecting you.

632
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,239
Yes. Goodbye.

633
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,999
Goodbye, Papa.

634
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,398
Let's get moving.

635
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,992
Now, isn't this a dill?

636
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,678
- Dill?
- Beautiful.

637
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,717
Don't you understand English?

638
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,515
I haven't had time to do much here.
But I'll get going in a couple of days.

639
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,676
First thing, we'll get a little fresh air.

640
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,109
A little dusting wouldn't do any harm.

641
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,630
Aren't you two in pretty poses?

642
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,589
How about getting
some of those bags upstairs?

643
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,869
Steve, you do it.

644
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,639
Mr. Jolson, you come over here
and sit down.

645
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,269
I've been hoping
somebody can play checkers here.

646
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,550
I can keep myself in pin money.

647
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,833
Al, honey...

648
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,716
it's cruel to bring you back to this house.

649
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,479
- No, baby.
- I know it is. I must be crazy.

650
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,752
- Fine time to tell me.
- I just didn't want any ghosts around.

651
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,632
I wanted you to wrestle with them here...

652
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,637
so you'd know
where you stood about the past...

653
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,990
and so I would know, too.
That's what I thought.

654
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,872
- That's right, baby.
- No, it isn't.

655
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,911
Look, if there are any ghosts around...

656
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,508
this is the place to make them
come out and fight.

657
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,517
That's what I'm getting to like about you.

658
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,552
- You're just saying that.
- And I'm meaning that.

659
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,113
Promise me, if this house gets you down...

660
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,950
when you can't take it anymore,
I want you to tell me straight out.

661
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,197
Like I could keep something from you
if I wanted to.

662
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,518
I also move pianos.

663
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,792
And my heavy cleaning
is in demand all over town.

664
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,873
Come on, you two.
You've got years to do that.

665
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,916
Here, I'll take a couple of those.
No arguments.

666
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,678
All right, you win.

667
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,071
Look when she lets me win.

668
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,115
Say, anybody thought about getting help?

669
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,276
How would you like to have
Henry and Alice back?

670
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,437
- Where would you find Henry and Alice?
- Already found them.

671
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,834
They'll be here tonight.

672
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,633
Quit their jobs and are flying back here
on broomsticks.

673
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,114
He could go on listening to the radio
like that forever.

674
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,118
- Likes music I guess.
- I wouldn't be surprised.

675
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,796
He looks to me like a man about ready
to go back to work.

676
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,679
You mean, sing?

677
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,628
- Don't you think he can, Steve?
- Sure.

678
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,716
- But he doesn't think so, does he?
- It's only natural.

679
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,639
- That lung's all healed.
- I suppose it is.

680
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,791
I can see why he'd be afraid.

681
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,753
Or is he afraid
that nobody wants to hear him?

682
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,959
In that case, he'd tell himself
it was his lung, wouldn't he?

683
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,152
Why worry about it, Ellen?
He's happy enough, isn't he?

684
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,033
Not if what he wants is to be back at work.

685
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,392
- Do you think he does?
- This is a laugh.

686
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,389
There was one woman once
who wanted him like this...

687
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,795
living a little and not singing his head off.

688
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,751
And here you are now...

689
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,916
- Not exactly a tactful guy, am I?
- Yes, you are, Steve.

690
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,756
I really want him to do both.

691
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,879
All I know...

692
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,549
it can't be good when the natural part
of a man is just moulding away.

693
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,190
You didn't answer me.
I asked you if you thought...

694
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,198
- he'd like to be back singing again.
- Of course he would.

695
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,551
He'd like to be right back
in the middle of show business again.

696
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,636
- He said so?
- Yes.

697
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,873
Just before he started that hospital tour.
Told me to go to work on it.

698
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,596
There is something I haven't told anybody,
and wouldn't tell him in a million years.

699
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,917
I did go to work, and the answer is:
Nobody wants him.

700
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,157
Broadway, radio,
nobody would risk a nickel on him.

701
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,437
A new crop of singers
has pushed Jolson right off the map.

702
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,791
If he tries for a comeback,
he'll take the beating of his life.

703
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,071
It would kill him
to have to face the truth about it.

704
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,118
So do you see what I mean, Ellen?

705
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,552
If he thinks he's through due to his lung,
even if he's lying to himself a little...

706
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,638
it's the kindest thing
that could have happened.

707
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,315
Do you understand what I'm saying?

708
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,878
See, as good as my word.

709
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,434
I tell you right now, you'll stay a long time.

710
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,676
If I like it here, I won't argue.

711
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,951
- Henry! I don't believe it.
- It's nice to see you again, Cantor.

712
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,230
- My goodness, it's a long time.
- Many years.

713
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,158
- You don't look a day older.
- Neither do you.

714
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,749
What a comfort we are to each other.

715
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,110
I don't have to ask if you are happy.

716
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,151
- I do not know.
- Miserable?

717
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,477
Husband out of work,
lazing around the house all day.

718
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,829
Not good.

719
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,989
Steve says he isn't wanted anymore...

720
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,918
and he'd take a beating
if he tried to sing again.

721
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,634
I am wondering, Papa,
which would be the worse beating:

722
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,433
Trying or just never singing again at all.

723
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,591
It's hard to say, Ellen.

724
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,508
You mean, if I were smart,
I'd mind my own business.

725
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,392
Women in love never do.

726
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,794
Is that bad?

727
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,953
Bad. Good.

728
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,233
It's history.

729
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,038
You know, it's nice you're here, Papa.
I've been sort of waiting for you.

730
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,192
Dinner must be ready.

731
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,035
We have to get some
special entertainment for Papa.

732
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,513
Me? Entertainment?

733
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,200
Don't you like to go dancing
in swanky restaurants?

734
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,311
That was in my younger days.

735
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,753
There's a benefit show
for the Community Chest next week.

736
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,678
A lot of big stars will be on the program.
Would you like to go?

737
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,473
- Nice. Very nice.
- I'll see that we're there.

738
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,959
- AI?
- Sure. Fine.

739
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,910
To give Papa a real thrill,
you ought to be on that stage that night.

740
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,395
- What doing, telling jokes?
- What you always did.

741
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,397
- Yeah?
- Just a song or two.

742
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,560
- Bet you one would be enough.
- I don't know.

743
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,558
If you sound as good as you do
when you sing in the bathroom.

744
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,875
Bathroom? You just hum a little.

745
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,914
With all that resonance in there,
you sound like Caruso.

746
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,190
Don't you know
that's why people sing in there?

747
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,312
- And you especially like it, don't you?
- Love it.

748
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,159
Why don't you try coming out
of the bathroom for a change?

749
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,952
The public might love it, too.

750
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,355
You're trying to get me back to work
or something?

751
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,439
I don't want a man lazing around the house
all the rest of his life.

752
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,950
You sound like you're only half kidding.

753
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,150
- About half.
- Only half?

754
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,392
In that case, tell you what to do, Steve.

755
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,115
You hop to New York
and get a show together for me.

756
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,515
Tell them not to worry
about my recent operation.

757
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,791
Of course, I haven't got the breath
for those high notes anymore...

758
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,957
Or radio. That'd be better.
They ought to be wild to have me.

759
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,752
A name like Jolson...

760
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,678
a name that bobbysoxers never heard of,
that's true...

761
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,076
and a style of singing
that went out with button shoes.

762
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,400
Or did you find that out already, Steve?

763
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,676
- Find out what?
- You know what.

764
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,631
I was gonna make a big comeback.

765
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,593
What did you find out?
Bet they were dying to have me back.

766
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,792
I really didn't get started,
but there was a lot of interest.

767
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,989
I see.

768
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,158
Of course, without your name in lights
on Broadway...

769
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,750
and making oodles of money,
I guess it wouldn't be singing.

770
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,474
What do you mean?

771
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,636
During the war,
you sang just to do something...

772
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,911
- for the fun of it.
- Sure. But that was then.

773
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,989
Even now, I can't see why you have
to be worried about a little old benefit.

774
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,873
There's gonna be 5,000 people
at that little old benefit...

775
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,639
in a big theatre. Not a thing to worry about.

776
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,591
Except if I can put two notes together...

777
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,870
and whether they can hear me
past the second row.

778
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,672
You can prove that to yourself.

779
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,791
Come on. What's the use talking about it?

780
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,115
Okay. If you're sure you can't.

781
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,228
What if I wasn't sure?

782
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,875
I don't see anybody breaking down doors
to get me on that benefit.

783
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,356
- Maybe if they knew you wanted to...
- Let's drop it, baby.

784
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,349
Sure.

785
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,513
How about a game
of checkers tonight, Papa?

786
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,237
No thank you, Ellen.
I couldn't eat another thing.

787
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,517
- Pretty tune.
- That's the big one right now.

788
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,716
Made to order for these crooners.

789
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,276
They sure sing this stuff today
nice and easy, don't they?

790
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,994
Who says you need
all the voice in the world to put a song over.

791
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,357
<i>'Cause I only have eyes</i>

792
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,789
<i>for you, dear</i>

793
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,438
<i>The moon may be high</i>

794
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,870
<i>But I can't see a thing in the sky</i>

795
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,671
<i>'Cause I only have eyes</i>

796
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,159
<i>for you</i>

797
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,876
<i>I don't know if we're in a garden</i>

798
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:14,194
<i>Or on a crowded avenue</i>

799
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,951
<i>You are here, so am I</i>

800
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,236
<i>Maybe millions of people pass by</i>

801
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,991
<i>But they all disappear</i>

802
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,159
<i>from view</i>

803
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,076
<i>And I</i>

804
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,439
<i>only have eyes</i>

805
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,512
<i>for you</i>

806
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,230
Must be the resonance in here.

807
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,957
Resonance, of course.

808
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,277
Okay, Steve.
If they can use me on that benefit.

809
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,639
- You win.
- Another game, Papa?

810
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,198
Another game, Steve?

811
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,630
I'm glad he's in shape again, Steve.

812
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,718
But actually, I got too big a list of stars,
right now.

813
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,638
Every year, the program's too long.
You know how it is.

814
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,113
Yeah, I know.

815
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,475
If you could still get a big name,
you'd grab it.

816
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,272
You just don't want Jolson.

817
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,595
Ten years ago,
you'd be kissing his feet to get him.

818
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,917
Be reasonable. All I'm trying to do
is get a big turnout for a benefit.

819
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,076
I've got to have names that mean something.

820
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,997
I don't care what you got to have.

821
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,111
When Al Jolson says he'll appear...

822
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,915
the guy you and I remember when he was
bigger than your whole list put together...

823
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,395
I'm not going to that guy
with some lame excuse...

824
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,476
that adds up to only one thing:

825
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,953
He's not wanted.

826
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,595
I can't do it, Charlie.
And you're not gonna make me do it.

827
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,477
All right, Steve. He's on.

828
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,231
- Hi.
- Good morning, baby.

829
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,553
Today is the day. Is it in the paper?

830
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,719
Let me see it.

831
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,151
My name is a little hard to find, baby.
It is at the bottom there.

832
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,350
"And many others." That's me.

833
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,360
- Nice day?
- Yeah. Real nice.

834
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,311
This is going way over time.

835
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,190
- Look at the time, Ralph. Let's go.
- No, wait. Please.

836
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,155
There's one fellow I've got to hear.

837
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,794
It's great to go on near the finish,
except there won't be any audience.

838
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,719
Where is everybody?

839
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,357
Seriously, I guess I've got
a few old friends out there.

840
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,869
Who else would be
hanging around at this hour?

841
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,788
So I'm gonna sing you an old one,
just one and let you go home.

842
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,319
By the way, a nice quiet one...

843
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,829
so as we won't disturb the people
who sleep.

844
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,270
Just like we rehearsed it, pal.

845
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:08,355
<i>Climb upon my knee, sonny boy</i>

846
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:15,753
<i>Though you are only three, sonny boy</i>

847
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,395
<i>You have no way of knowing</i>

848
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,679
<i>There's no way of showing</i>

849
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,550
<i>What you mean to me</i>

850
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:31,437
<i>sonny boy</i>

851
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,710
<i>When there are grey skies</i>

852
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:44,556
<i>I don't mind the grey skies</i>

853
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,873
<i>You make them blue</i>

854
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,269
<i>sonny boy</i>

855
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,997
<i>Friends, friends may forsake me</i>

856
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,991
<i>Let them, let them all forsake me</i>

857
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,994
<i>I still have you</i>

858
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,030
<i>sonny boy</i>

859
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,117
<i>You are sent from heaven</i>

860
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,634
<i>and I know your worth</i>

861
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,638
<i>You have made a heaven</i>

862
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,631
<i>for me here on earth</i>

863
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,199
<i>And the angels grew lonely</i>

864
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,916
<i>Took you, because they were lonely</i>

865
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,479
<i>I am lonely, too</i>

866
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,671
<i>sonny boy</i>

867
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,470
Nothing like singing for a lot of old-timers.

868
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,752
- I liked it, and I am not an old-timer.
- But you happen to be very nice.

869
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,670
Better watch the road, honey.

870
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,916
Amazing how he can still get you
with a corny old song like that.

871
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,320
I think he can still get anybody,
singing anything.

872
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,954
Singing styles have changed a little, Ralph.

873
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,469
I don't know about that.
But I know one thing.

874
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,195
His voice is better now than it ever was,
warmer, more heart.

875
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,513
Oddly enough...

876
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,634
a certain newspaper columnist brought me
a picture idea a few weeks ago:

877
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,432
<i>The Life of Jolson</i>.

878
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,313
He had to bring that idea to me, an old fan.

879
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,957
Listening to that voice tonight,
I kept thinking...

880
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,110
if you could give people a real chance
to hear him again...

881
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,437
Bit of a tough one, though.

882
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,515
- It was a beating, wasn't it?
- What?

883
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,318
This whole thing tonight
that I plagued you into doing.

884
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,189
It wasn't anything, honey.
I just said to myself:

885
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,232
"Now in Arkansas, we'd look at it this way."

886
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,715
I know I'm not headlining this show.

887
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,956
I got a hunch they don't even want me on it.

888
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,640
I know half this crowd
didn't want to hear me sing.

889
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,548
The other half is only sticking around
for old times' sake. I know all that.

890
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,912
I didn't come here for glory.
I just came to do something I wanted to do.

891
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,873
I don't care.

892
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,628
You were absolutely marvellous tonight.

893
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,151
There you are.
And I got something out of my system.

894
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,833
In fact, a couple more jobs like tonight,
and I'm a pretty happy man.

895
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,276
So what are you talking about?

896
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,309
Hello?

897
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,354
Yes, it is.

898
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,353
That's all right.

899
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,749
Who?

900
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,672
Oh, yes. How are you?

901
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,110
You really liked it, didn't you, pal?

902
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,356
It's nice of you to call and tell me.

903
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,914
No, that's okay. I hadn't gone to bed yet.

904
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,793
Thanks a lot.

905
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,233
Why, sure.

906
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,190
Anytime. I am generally home.

907
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,751
Thanks again. Goodnight.

908
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,910
Bryant?

909
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,277
How are you, Mr. Bryant?

910
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,268
You still don't know me, do you?
Colonel Bryant, the Aleutians.

911
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,078
- Duluth, Minnesota.
- That's right.

912
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,909
If it ain't old Duluth! It had to be an old fan.
I'm glad to see you.

913
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,554
Come on out and meet the family.
They will love you.

914
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,033
They are fans of mine, too.

915
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,799
And, brother, how many members
of that club are still around?

916
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,229
Meet Colonel Bryant. My wife, Mrs. Jolson.

917
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,679
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

918
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,712
- My father and Steve Martin.
- How are you, sir?

919
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,397
- Glad to know you, sir.
- How do you do?

920
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,671
This fellow phones in the middle
of the night to tell me I am terrific.

921
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,552
- Don't you love him?
- Mad about him.

922
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,113
See. Old homely.

923
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,913
- Sit down. Stay for lunch with us.
- Thanks. I'd like to.

924
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,589
You'll want him to stay for dinner, too,
'cause up in the Aleutians...

925
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,314
if it hadn't been for the pat on the back
he gave me...

926
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,830
I was worried and scared stiff.
He picked me right up off the floor.

927
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,918
In fact, you can bring your clothes
and move in, Colonel Bryant.

928
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,793
Let's forget the "Colonel."
I'm just a picture producer again.

929
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,276
I didn't tell you that.
Came from Hollywood all the time.

930
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,591
How does it feel to be back making movies?

931
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,076
They are always tough,
except when you get a really exciting idea.

932
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,317
- And I got one last night, listening to you.
- Yeah?

933
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,949
I didn't sleep much.
This morning I was still at it.

934
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,435
So I thought I'd come over
and talk to you about it.

935
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,710
- What's that?
- A motion picture.

936
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,752
You mean you want me
to play a part or something? Me?

937
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,599
No. A picture about you. Your whole career.

938
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,919
- Sound crazy?
- My friend, as goofy as can be.

939
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,268
- Why?
- Why?

940
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,157
- Last night should tell you why.
- Last night brought me out here.

941
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,635
Yeah, you and a few hundred others.

942
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,073
But you make pictures today
for a whole new generation.

943
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,589
They buy the tickets.
What's in this one for them?

944
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,359
The story of the biggest man
in entertainment for 30 years...

945
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,799
singing the biggest songs.

946
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,593
- That are deader than a doornail.
- Not when you sing them.

947
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,951
Amazing fellow.
Don't you love him? You would.

948
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,271
Look, pal, I'm going to forget
you ever mentioned an idea like this...

949
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,075
'cause if it ever got out you'd have
the whole town laughing at you.

950
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,555
That's the best thing this town does.

951
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,877
- Just begging for trouble, aren't you?
- Give me some reasons.

952
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,399
He wants reasons.

953
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,557
- That's only fair. Give him some.
- Reasons.

954
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,760
Look, I was singing in vaudeville at 15.

955
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,674
Let's say when I was really
getting underway in my 20s.

956
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,268
You expect me to play a 20-year-old
on the screen today?

957
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,198
I know, that one I wrestled with last night.

958
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,119
- But suppose somebody else played it?
- Somebody else?

959
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,038
- But me singing, of course.
- Of course.

960
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,235
You mean, put the songs through him
like he was singing.

961
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,916
I know a lot of the kick
is how you put the songs over.

962
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,434
I'm not talking about that.

963
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,597
I've seen a thousand guys imitate me,
and good, too.

964
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,432
But this would be my stuff
coming out of his mouth on the screen...

965
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,472
- just like I sang it?
- I think it could be done.

966
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,792
Let's say we found the guy and he is great,
but look, the songs?

967
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,718
Couldn't use the old recordings
I made years ago, right?

968
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,432
I'm afraid it is.

969
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,677
The sound quality of those old recordings
would be pretty bad today.

970
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,394
So I'd have to sing them all over again?

971
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,039
I guess you'd have to.

972
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,151
Just like I sang them back on Broadway...

973
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,158
where your picture is gonna show
how I used to knock them dead.

974
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,999
- I happen to think you can.
- Oh, brother!

975
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,033
I know I'm better
than I was in Duluth 20 years ago.

976
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:00,755
All that has happened since,
not hitting very well on one cylinder...

977
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,677
and sing four keys lower.

978
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,349
- Nobody would have known that last night.
- Because that was <i>Sonny Boy</i>.

979
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:11,678
- Why not anything else?
- Anything else, pal?

980
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,797
Those Mammies, those Rock-A-Byes,
you've got to give out.

981
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,559
- You think you couldn't do that?
- Think I couldn't do it?

982
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,875
- Have you tried?
- No, he hasn't.

983
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,399
Then why don't you?

984
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,876
Why not come in to the studio
and make a recording or two?

985
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,752
When could you do that?

986
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,993
- What do I say to this madman?
- That you are free almost anytime.

987
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,635
- What is the matter?
- Butterflies.

988
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,832
Like opening night on Broadway. Come on.

989
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,916
Let's have playback, voice and orchestra.

990
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,679
Let me out of here.
I'd rather spend a year in solitary.

991
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,792
How can a man sing
with the orchestra in Honolulu?

992
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,078
You looked great. Now we'll hear it.

993
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,350
- Maybe we ought to skip the whole thing.
- We'll see.

994
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,153
- I think you are going to like it.
- Ready.

995
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,792
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

996
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,156
<i>Yesterday, I heard a lover sigh</i>

997
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,797
<i>Goodbye, oh me, oh my</i>

998
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,391
<i>Seven times he got aboard his train</i>

999
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,755
<i>And seven times he hurried back</i>
<i>to kiss his love again, and tell her</i>

1000
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,235
<i>Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye</i>

1001
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,396
<i>Toot, Toot, Tootsie, don't cry</i>

1002
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:37,558
<i>The choo-choo train</i>
<i>that takes me away from you</i>

1003
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,434
<i>No words can tell how sad it makes me</i>
<i>Kiss me, Tootie, and then</i>

1004
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,390
<i>Do it over again</i>

1005
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,673
<i>Watch for the mail, I'll never fail</i>

1006
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,952
<i>If you don't get a letter</i>
<i>then you'll know I'm in jail</i>

1007
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,559
<i>Don't cry, Tootie, don't cry</i>

1008
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,039
<i>Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye</i>

1009
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,830
What's all the mystery?
What are we gonna see?

1010
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,350
- I told you, a little experiment, that's all.
- What's it got to do with me?

1011
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,756
That's what we're gonna find out.
Okay, Bill. Let's go.

1012
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,078
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

1013
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,351
<i>Yesterday, I heard a lover sigh</i>

1014
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,350
<i>Goodbye, oh me, oh my</i>

1015
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,234
<i>Seven times he got aboard his train</i>

1016
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,996
<i>And seven times he hurried back</i>
<i>to kiss his love again, and tell her</i>

1017
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,190
<i>Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye</i>

1018
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,190
What's going on here? Who is that?

1019
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,075
<i>The choo-choo train that takes me</i>

1020
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,668
- That's the recording I made.
- Of course it is.

1021
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,074
Who's the guy there?

1022
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,111
<i>Kiss me, Tootie, and then</i>

1023
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,795
<i>do it over again</i>

1024
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,193
<i>Watch for the mail, I'll never fail</i>

1025
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,437
<i>If you don't get a letter</i>
<i>then you'll know I'm in jail</i>

1026
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,078
<i>Don't cry, Tootie, don't cry</i>

1027
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:21,519
<i>Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye!</i>

1028
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,231
Wonderful. Who was that?

1029
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,548
Meet a young fellow named Larry Parks.

1030
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,390
Let's agree on one thing at the start, boys.

1031
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,114
I don't think anybody cares
about the facts of my life...

1032
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,832
about dates and places.

1033
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,918
I'll give you a mess of them,
you juggle them any way you like.

1034
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:54,999
What matters is the singing a man did,
and the difference that made.

1035
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,992
The thing to tell is a kid
who ran away from home when he was 15...

1036
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,838
'cause he was crazy to sing.

1037
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,555
Never stopped once through years of show
business, singing thousands of songs.

1038
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,433
A guy who ate, drank,
and slept nothing else.

1039
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,032
And when you get to Julie Benson,
that's important.

1040
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,516
'Cause then you find out
it's really the story of a wrong guy...

1041
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,553
who only cared about being a big hit,
and always leading the parade.

1042
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:22,229
He thought he was crazy about her,
and when she walked out...

1043
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,909
Though, if you ask him today,
when she left, it was just his pride...

1044
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,235
that was kicked around,
'cause in those days...

1045
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,476
he really couldn't think of anything
but himself.

1046
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,160
He had to get tossed on the shelf,
and take a beating...

1047
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,795
before he began to learn there might be
something else in the world.

1048
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,273
I'm scared of this picture.

1049
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,233
If it ever went over,
I might get wound up like the old Jolson.

1050
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,828
- I'd like to call the whole thing off.
- You would?

1051
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,310
But my wife won't let me.

1052
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,120
- Well, where are we?
- Still at the beginning.

1053
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:55,670
I guess the place to start would be
back in Washington when I was a kid...

1054
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,030
singing with my father in the synagogue.

1055
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,072
But what I was really interested in
was the burlesque house...

1056
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,191
a few blocks down the street.

You better hurry,
you've got about five minutes, sir.

1078
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:57,155
- What's that you keep taking all the time?
- Just something for my nerves.

1079
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,874
- Anything wrong with you?
- No, I feel fine.

1080

What are you stalling around for?
Come on, we'll be late.

<i>and in all directions, from pole to pole.</i>

1086
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,828
<i>But despite the heavy falls,</i>
<i>some collegians average...</i>

1087
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,712
<i>almost a mile a minute.</i>

1088
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,236
- Can I help you?
- No, thanks.

1089
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,598
What's the matter?

1090
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,556
- I just can't take it in there.
- You're not going to see the picture?

1091
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,831
I'll watch from back here.
I may be in later. You go on in.
