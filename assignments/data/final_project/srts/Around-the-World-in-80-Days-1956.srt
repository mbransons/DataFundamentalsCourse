1
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:11,746
Jules Verne wrote many books.

2
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:16,075
He was able to transfer
his soaring imagination to print.

3
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:18,670
His predictions were bold.

4
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:22,249
What he wrote was regarded
as fantastic fiction

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,007
but much of it has become fact.

6
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:30,009
Flying machines,
submarines, television, rockets.

7
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,992
But not even his imagination
could shrink the earth

8
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:35,806
to the point it has now reached.

9
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:38,981
<i>He wrote a book called
From the Earth to the Moon.</i>

10
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:42,692
And in Paris,
that authentic genius Georges Méliès

11
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:47,573
turned it into a movie, 35 millimeter
just as you're looking at it now.

12
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:50,235
It was, of course, fantasy.

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,575
But as of now,
no one has yet gone to the moon

14
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,658
to see whether Méliès was right.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,743
Here is the actual film
as Méliès' camera recorded it

16
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:01,581
at the turn of the century.

17
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:13,016
<i>I suppose that since man
began to walk upright</i>

18
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:16,271
<i>he has been interested
in space and speed.</i>

19
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,186
<i>He has wondered increasingly
about the planets he sees in the sky.</i>

20
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:26,439
<i>The stretching fingertips of science
have moved him higher and faster</i>

21
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:29,071
<i>than man has ever moved before.</i>

22
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:32,924
<i>One of Jules Verne's characters,
a fanatic and a dreamer</i>

23
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:36,123
<i>argues for the construction
of a rocket to the moon.</i>

24
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:47,582
<i>After reasoned discourse,
the venture is launched.</i>

25
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:57,056
<i>This is the first photographic dissolve.</i>

26
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:07,025
<i>This is a do-it-yourself rocket.</i>

27
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:20,267
<i>Rockets have changed.
Photography has changed.</i>

28
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:22,269
<i>Costumes have changed.</i>

29
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:27,394
<i>But some things remain unchanged,
even in imagination of Verne and Méliès.</i>

30
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:31,292
<i>Jules Verne's rocket returns to the earth</i>

31
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:35,668
<i>a minor planet,
where fiction lags behind the fact.</i>

32
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:38,553
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

33
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:42,742
<i>eight, seven, six, five,</i>

34
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:48,229
<i>four, three, two, one, fire!</i>

35
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:14,757
<i>There is, in this power of destruction
also the promise of hope.</i>

36
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:18,884
<i>A world of unlimited power
and limitless hope.</i>

37
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:22,903
<i>Man has devised a method
of destroying most of humanity</i>

38
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:27,478
<i>or of lifting it up to high plateaus
of prosperity and progress</i>

39
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:30,610
<i>never dreamed of by the boldest dreamers.</i>

40
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:35,150
<i>You are now looking
at the receding shape of this planet, Earth.</i>

41
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:43,948
<i>This is how the earth looks
from a camera in the rocket.</i>

42
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:49,786
<i>Jules Verne wrote a book
about going around the world in 80 days.</i>

43
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:53,831
<i>He even predicted
it could be done in 80 hours.</i>

44
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:57,467
<i>Today it can be done
in less than half that time.</i>

45
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:00,002
<i>But each journey must have an end.</i>

46
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:04,469
<i>Speed is got only when wisdom leads the way.</i>

47
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,539
<i>The end of this journey</i>

48
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:11,169
<i>whether to the high horizons of hope
or the depths of destruction</i>

49
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:14,048
<i>will be determined
by the collective wisdom</i>

50
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,236
<i>of the people who live
on this shrinking planet.</i>

51
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,527
There was a time not so long ago
when learned men thought that was flat.

52
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:29,123
<i>Around the World in 80 Days
is the Jules Verne classic.</i>

53
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:32,711
And the world was already shrinking
when it was written.

54
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:34,587
And that was in 1872.

55
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,871
<i>Morning paper. Get your morning paper here.
All about the bank robbery here.</i>

56
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,846
<i>Get your morning paper.
Paper, sir? Get your paper here.</i>

57
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:38,834
<i>All about the bank robbery here.
Get your morning paper here.</i>

58
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:44,907
<i>Get your morning paper.
Here you are. Paper, sir? Paper.</i>

59
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,741
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Thorndyke.

60
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,526
- Hinshaw.
- Yes, sir?

61
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,969
<i>Somebody's been tampering with
my Telegraph. The pages are all crushed.</i>

62
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:09,368
Eh, yes, sir. One of the members
borrowed it to read about the robbery.

63
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:11,309
You mean it's been used?

64
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:14,646
- Kindly remove it and send out for a fresh one.
- At once, sir.

65
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:18,395
I'm a patient man, Hinshaw,
but don't trespass on my good feelings.

66
00:08:22,384 --> 00:08:23,218
Psst.

67
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:26,612
Pilbeam! Did you hear that?

68
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:30,076
- Some fellow stole that chap's paper.
- The devil, you say!

69
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:31,194
Word of honor.

70
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:34,513
First time it's happened here
to my knowledge, in 45 years.

71
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,183
The club's going to the dogs.

72
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:39,170
Next thing you know, all the members
will be talking to each other!

73
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:42,003
- Yes, it's the thin end of the wedge.
- All daft.

74
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:51,176
- Ice, me Lord?
- Ice?

75
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,748
Certainly not.
What do I look like, a polar bear?

76
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:59,169
Sorry, sir. Several of the members
use it now and then.

77
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:03,150
Learned it from some Yankee, I dare say.
Those redskins over there drink anything.

78
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,881
A dangerous customer
I've always thought, sir.

79
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,153
A man might catch
a nasty chill on his liver.

80
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:11,121
Or break a tooth.

81
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,785
Remind me to speak
to the House Committee about it.

82
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:16,662
<i>No, by gad! I'll write a letter to The Times.</i>

83
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,415
- Psst, Hinshaw, I say, Hinshaw.
- Yes, Mr. Mockridge?

84
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,181
Must we have that confounded
animal around here stamping its feet?

85
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:43,774
- Mind the horse!
- Who does he think he is?

86
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,564
- That bloke is balmy!
- That bloke is a Yankee, I'll bet!

87
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:07,468
There's a sight!

88
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:21,151
Move over, sir!

89
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:24,692
Move over!
Move that confounded contraption!

90
00:11:58,748 --> 00:12:01,093
When I first placed you with Mr. Fogg
a fortnight ago

91
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,708
I warned you that he was an eccentric.

92
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:06,454
An eccentric, Mr. Hesketh-Baggott?
The man's a tyrant.

93
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,835
A cold-hearted, implacable fiend.

94
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:13,468
Must I remind you, Foster, that you are
speaking of a member of the Reform Club?

95
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:16,631
I don't care if he's a member
of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.

96
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:18,011
The man's mad!

97
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,697
Actually, excessive sanity
is not a necessary qualification

98
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,784
- for that particular institution.
- Believe me, sir, he's not human.

99
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:28,443
You know how many valets
he's had during the last six months?

100
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:31,564
Certainly I do. I've supplied him
with five of them myself.

101
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:35,439
And are you aware that he tortured them
with a refinement of cruelty

102
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:39,613
which would have put Torquemada and
the entire Spanish Inquisition to shame?

103
00:12:39,703 --> 00:12:43,951
He's a cold and methodical as those
two watches he carries about with him.

104
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:49,331
Come, come, come, come, Foster.
You are abandoning yourself to rhetoric.

105
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:53,332
Kindly remember that you have been rigorously
trained as a gentleman's gentleman.

106
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,445
A gentleman's gentleman is one thing, sir.

107
00:12:55,512 --> 00:13:02,717
- A whimpering, cringing, slave is another.
- Foster.

108
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:06,226
You are allowing
your native imperturbability

109
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:10,044
to be swept away
by a spate of mounting hysteria.

110
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:13,238
- You really must calm down.
- I can't help it, sir.

111
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:16,040
If you knew how ardently
I have worked for Mr. Fogg,

112
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:20,178
how enthusiastically I have endeavored
to cater to his every whim.

113
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:24,789
His bath water had to be exactly
one foot, three and one-quarter inches.

114
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,625
No less, no more.

115
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:30,690
His morning toasted to be
83 degrees Fahrenheit.

116
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:34,086
- No more, no less.
- Extraordinary.

117
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,292
How does one take
the temperature of toast?

118
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:45,112
Incidentally... Have you found out
anything definite about him?

119
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,104
I'm mean... Who he is, what he does?

120
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:51,851
- Not the fainted indication, sir. Have you?
- Alas, no.

121
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:54,815
All I have discovered is entirely negative.

122
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,200
He is not a professional man,
and he isn't in trade.

123
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,450
He has no family connections
or background worth mentioning.

124
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:06,032
He doesn't go in for hunting,
or fishing, or wenching.

125
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:11,122
Can not imagine how he ever got
into the Reform Club!

126
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,758
Perhaps your uncle, the Bishop
might inquire for you there, sir.

127
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:20,417
- He is a member, is he not?
- One of the most distinguished, Foster.

128
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:23,989
We are a very ancient family, you know.

129
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,512
Now, I was just rather curious
about our precious Mr. Fogg.

130
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:33,150
I suppose he'll be hectoring me soon
for someone to fill your place.

131
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:36,061
And thank you for your cooperation,
Foster.

132
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,362
We must pray for guidance.

133
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:43,703
You have a nice little position
for a gentleman's gentleman, sir?

134
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,581
- For you?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:57,793
Never doubt for one instant, Foster,
the efficacy of prayer.

136
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,585
What is your name?

137
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:03,007
Passepartout.

138
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:05,534
- Passepartout?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:08,347
I am from a very ancient family, sir.

140
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:14,140
Obviously.

141
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:20,903
You've led a rather speckled career,
I see. Professor of gymnastics.

142
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:24,699
- Yes, sir. Watch.
- No demonstrations, please.

143
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:28,743
Trapeze artist, fireman, chimney sweep.

144
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:32,957
- Amazing. How did you come to England?
- In a clothes basket, sir.

145
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,076
I escaped.

146
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,627
- From what?
- Women, sir.

147
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:38,044
A ladies' man, huh?

148
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:41,251
Well, there are no women
in this household.

149
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:43,213
Now, my conditions are strict.

150
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:47,882
My timetable never varies.
When I say breakfast at 8:24,

151
00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:51,071
- I do not mean at 8:23 or at 8:25.
- Yes, sir.

152
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:52,930
- Do you have a watch?
- Oh, yes, sir.

153
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,517
It's probably wrong.

154
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:05,402
Hmm. Very well. See that you behave
yourself. Any tomfoolery and out you go.

155
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:10,518
Oh, come on now, Ralph,
don't be so secretive.

156
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:14,918
- You're one of the governors of the bank.
- Yes. Let's have some lurid details.

157
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:16,750
Nothing to tell you.
You've read the newspapers.

158
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:18,417
Oh, they always exaggerate.

159
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:22,173
Do you mean to say the thief
actually got away with £55,000?

160
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:23,908
He did, in brand new bank notes.

161
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:27,298
Smote fill large denominations,
£500 or £1,000 each.

162
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,754
How did you know that?
We didn't disclose that to the press.

163
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,967
I assumed it.

164
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:35,137
The £55,000 of small currency would have
needed a handcart to transport it.

165
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,045
Therefore, it must have been compact
enough to stuff into one's pockets.

166
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:41,041
You're right. The man's audacity
staggers the imagination.

167
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:43,610
Imagine sauntering up
to the head cashier's table

168
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,897
and pilfering a sum like that
from under his very nose.

169
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:47,778
Serves you right in a way.

170
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:51,571
Surely you have some better hiding place
for your funds than the cashier's nose?

171
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:55,434
Your persiflage does not amuse.
This has been totally unexpected blow to us.

172
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:56,829
Unexpected, Mr. Ralph?

173
00:16:57,148 --> 00:17:00,331
Bankers must expect robbery much
the same way that chickens expect hawks.

174
00:17:00,423 --> 00:17:03,232
It's an occupational hazard.
My lead, I believe.

175
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:06,717
By the way, what was the head cashier
doing at the time?

176
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:08,570
He's writing receipt
for the three-shilling deposit.

177
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:09,973
Oh, no...

178
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:14,426
Go ahead and jeer, gentlement. We shall lay
the culprit by the heels soon enough.

179
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,143
We've notified detectives all over
the world from Liverpool to Cairo.

180
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:21,733
We've issued the descriptions throughout
Europe and America. He won't get any far.

181
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:23,977
I wouldn't underestimate him
if I were you, Mr. Ralph.

182
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:26,195
You're dealing
with a rather exceptional person.

183
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:27,777
Really? In what way?

184
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:30,988
Only a cool and logical individual
could have engineered such an exploit.

185
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,784
Obviously a gentlemen,
money can considerable presence of mind.

186
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:36,826
You seem to know rather more
about this affair than the police.

187
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,979
Merely what one might deduce
from the facts. Logically.

188
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,589
Well, if you ask me,
I'd say the odds were in favor of the thief.

189
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:47,630
If he's such a resourceful chap, as Fogg says,
he'll find plenty of places to hide.

190
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:50,926
Oh, yes. The world's a pretty
large affair, after all.

191
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:53,237
It was 100 years ago,
it's not any longer.

192
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,550
A man can girdle the globe now
in three months.

193
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:57,854
Less than that, to be precise.
In 80 days.

194
00:17:57,941 --> 00:18:01,688
You mean a complete tour
all around the world in 80 days?

195
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,047
I mean just that.

196
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:06,322
- Eh, he's talking nonsense.
- No, no, Fogg may have a point there.

197
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:09,193
The Great Indian Peninsula Railway
was opened only a fortnight ago.

198
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:12,037
<i>That shortens the trip considerably.
I read about that in The Daily Telegraph.</i>

199
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:14,326
<i>Oh, hang The Daily Telegraph.
I say it's impossible.</i>

200
00:18:14,414 --> 00:18:15,825
Nothing is impossible.

201
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:19,976
When science finally conquers the air, it may
be feasible to circle the globe in 80 hours.

202
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,747
Oh, it's a beautiful dream,
but I'm talking about this moment

203
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:25,718
and I say there's nobody
can go around the world in 80 days.

204
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:29,750
And I agree. Well, even if one made
ideal connections at every point

205
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:33,360
there'd still be typhoons,
shipwrecks, unforeseen delays.

206
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:35,475
I include the unforeseen.

207
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:39,906
You're pretty glib, Fogg,
but I'd like to see you do it in 80 days.

208
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,077
You're convinced that I could not?

209
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:47,070
So much so that
I'll wager £5,000 that you can't.

210
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:50,780
Let me understand you clearly, Stuart.
Are you formally challenging me

211
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:53,065
to undertake a journey
around the world in 80 days?

212
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,392
I am, sir, and I'm prepared
to back my conviction

213
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:59,493
- by posting my check right here and now.
- Very well, I accept.

214
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:02,516
I say, this is absurd.
The joke's gone far enough.

215
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:04,996
An Englishman never jokes
about a wager, sir.

216
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:10,500
My gentlemen, I have on deposit
at Barings Bank the sum of £20,000.

217
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:13,632
And I'm willing to wager any or all of it
upon the same contention.

218
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:16,972
Namely, that I can complete
a tour of the world in 80 days.

219
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,978
That is to say,
1,920 hours or 115,200 minutes.

220
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:24,708
Would anyone besides Stuart
care to participate?

221
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:28,255
I'm no gambler,
but if you want to make foolhardy bets

222
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:31,654
that you can't possibly win,
I'm afraid I shall be forced to take you on.

223
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:35,359
- So am I with you.
- So am I. What about you, Ralph?

224
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:39,009
My affiliation with the Bank of England
naturally precludes my betting

225
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:42,414
but as a member of this club,
I might under very special circumstances.

226
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:44,133
Then it's agreed? We all accept?

227
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:45,143
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:47,965
Very well. If I remember correctly,
the boat train for Dover

229
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:50,691
leaves London Bridge Station
at 8:45 tonight.

230
00:19:50,781 --> 00:19:52,463
- I will be on it.
- Tonight?

231
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,739
Don't you need a couple of days
to settle your affairs,

232
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:57,473
- to make preparations?
- No. I'm quite ready now.

233
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:00,645
You engage to be back here in London,
in the Reform Club

234
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,808
on Saturday, September 21st at 8:45 p.m.

235
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:10,654
Now, gentlemen,
clubs, I believe, are still trumps.

236
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,613
Shall we finish the game?

237
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,825
<i>- Yes, please?
- Come to my bedroom at once.</i>

238
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:03,030
Yes, sir.

239
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:39,320
- I called you twice.
- I came as fast as possible, sir.

240
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,779
You are not supposed to be home yet, sir.

241
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:46,785
My usual routine is beside the point.
We leaving for the Continent in 10 minutes.

242
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:50,001
<i>- Monsieur is going traveling?
- Yes. Around the world.</i>

243
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:56,635
Then you will not be here for breakfast.
Around the world?

244
00:21:57,074 --> 00:22:00,555
Exactly. Now reassemble your faculties
and start packing.

245
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:01,621
<i>Si, señor.</i>

246
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:11,351
<i>Which clothes does, monsieur,
I mean, which trunks?</i>

247
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:15,967
None whatever. Just take two shirts
and three pairs of hose for each of us.

248
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,819
- But I have only one shirt, sir.
- Then take that.

249
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:22,950
We'll buy whatever else we need en route.
Give me that red bag.

250
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:36,414
Open it up.
We'll need plenty of money.

251
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:40,984
Whatever you do,
never let this out of your sight.

252
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:45,580
<i>Monsieur can trust me.
I will cherish it like a woman.</i>

253
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:47,515
Don't make love to it. Just watch it.

254
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:50,412
Excuse me, sir. My cousin.

255
00:23:53,753 --> 00:23:54,951
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

256
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:07,507
Excuse me, sir. Is not my cousin.

257
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:15,999
Oh!

258
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,275
Thomas Cook and Son.

259
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:24,843
Thomas Cook.

260
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:29,665
Cook.

261
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:36,075
- Cook.
- Ah, Cook...

262
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:45,122
<i>Merci Mille fois,
monsieur, et bon voyage.</i>

263
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:46,758
<i>Mes homages, madame.</i>

264
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,736
Ah, you purchase the tickets.
I'll be back in a moment.

265
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:54,285
All right, sir.

266
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,238
<i>Entrez.</i>

267
00:26:02,548 --> 00:26:04,875
<i>Now, monsieur, train to Marseilles,</i>

268
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:11,137
steamer to Bombay via Suez, across India
by train, and steamer again to Hong Kong.

269
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,937
Only one drawback. With this route,
you miss Bali and the women.

270
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,271
But no, women of Bali
cannot be described.

271
00:26:22,444 --> 00:26:26,090
<i>- Please try.
- Oh, no, no, monsieur. Words would fail me.</i>

272
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:30,568
In any case, in Yokohama,
you will encounter the geisha girls,

273
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,913
<i>and those, monsieur,
are not to be sneezed at.</i>

274
00:26:33,956 --> 00:26:40,501
I shall remember. In Yokohama,
I must not sneeze at geisha girl.

275
00:26:41,462 --> 00:26:44,341
Then, between San Francisco
and New York,

276
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:51,358
you will discover Indian maidens galore,
statuesque, barbaric creatures.

277
00:26:51,472 --> 00:26:54,090
<i>Hah, monsieur,
what a crime you have only 80 days.</i>

278
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:59,937
However, first things first.
Here are your tickets to Marseilles.

279
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:02,806
Cancel those tickets, Passepartout.
There are of no further use to us.

280
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:06,250
- We cannot go by train.
- Has something happened? A wreck?

281
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:08,499
No, an avalanche has sealed
the Montfort tunnel,

282
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,317
and nothing can get through for a week.

283
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:13,820
Then the road are blocked, too.
How can we go on?

284
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:17,163
I don't know. But I refuse to be daunted
at this stage of the game.

285
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:19,738
There must be another way.
There has to be.

286
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:24,495
But after all, we are not birds.
We cannot fly across the mountains.

287
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:30,003
<i>That, monsieur, is not unfeasible,
fantastic as it seems.</i>

288
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:37,267
Isn't she lovely?

289
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:45,021
I have made 63 ascents, gentlemen,
to an elevation over 1,000 meters.

290
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:49,046
I've flown through the skies
at a speed surpassing that of an eagle.

291
00:27:49,197 --> 00:27:52,468
Are you quite sure, sir,
this is not just gallic braggadocio?

292
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,429
<i>Monsieur, you are now addressing</i>

293
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:57,765
the second most-celebrated
balloonist in Europe.

294
00:27:57,955 --> 00:27:59,787
- And who is the first?
- He is not available.

295
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:02,519
He was buried last Tuesday.

296
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:05,851
Tell me, sir,
is this apparatus of yours for lease?

297
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:11,376
If I operate it, yes.
If you do, it's only for sale.

298
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:14,420
- Passepartout, the bag.
- Yes, sir.

299
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:25,516
- We purchase your balloon, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

300
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:20,334
Passepartout! Passepartout! Come on, man.

301
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:34,047
Now, it's really very simple.
We empty out some sand,

302
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:40,273
and we go up. Then we pull this,

303
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:43,848
and with any luck, we come down.

304
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:46,954
I imagine we've release some gas
from the top of the balloon.

305
00:30:47,082 --> 00:30:51,920
Gas! Mr. Fogg,
I forgot to turn off the gas in my room.

306
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,751
No matter.
It will continue to burn at your expense.

307
00:35:03,465 --> 00:35:07,339
Well, gentlemen, I think this calls
for a restrained celebration.

308
00:35:07,634 --> 00:35:10,903
Guess what's become
of the intrepid Mr. Fogg?

309
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:14,119
- What?
- He's drifting over the Alps in a balloon.

310
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:16,974
- A balloon.
- What's he doing in one of those?

311
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:19,138
Don't ask me, but it's here in this paper.

312
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,763
- I say, he never mentioned the word balloon.
- Not very sporting, is it?

313
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,153
Rather sly, if you ask me.
I wouldn't have thought it of old Fogg.

314
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:29,776
Oh, I don't know,
seems quite resourceful to me.

315
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:32,846
English ingenuity,
never say die, all that sort of thing.

316
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,579
Does it happen to mention
over which Alps he's drifting?

317
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:37,822
No. I assumed they were the ones
in Switzerland.

318
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:42,086
Use your globe, sir. Could be
the Maritime Alps, in the south of France.

319
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:45,774
In which case Fogg's not only on schedule,
but ahead of it.

320
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,795
We stand to lose £20,000.

321
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:51,468
What was that you said
about a celebration, Stuart?

322
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,803
If nobody wants this newspaper,
I'll just put it on the table.

323
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:06,225
The southern perimeter of France,
Passepartout.

324
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:10,468
Often and with justification referred to
in the guidebooks as the "Azure Coast".

325
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:12,345
I think, the moment is
propitious for our descent.

326
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:13,282
Yes, sir.

327
00:36:20,855 --> 00:36:24,225
The gas valve's stuck, I think.
Can you get up there?

328
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:25,831
I'll try it, master.

329
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:52,067
These people seem to be speaking
some bizarre foreign tongue.

330
00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:53,627
- Do you understand them?
- Yes, master.

331
00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:55,878
And ask the folk with how far
we are from Marseilles,

332
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:57,528
and what conveyance they have
for us to proceed.

333
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:58,910
Yes, sir.

334
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:16,906
- Why aren't they speaking French?
- Because we are in Spain, master.

335
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:19,276
- Spain?
- Yes, sir.

336
00:38:22,268 --> 00:38:28,678
It's a long trip to Marseilles.
But by sea, in a fast boat, 10 hours.

337
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:30,953
Where would we procure such a boat?

338
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:44,469
There is one vessel here.
The boat of Abdul Achmed of Tangiers.

339
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:46,683
Where would we find this worthy?

340
00:39:00,598 --> 00:39:05,491
He sleeps by day. But at night,
he's in the Cave of the Seven Winds.

341
00:43:18,355 --> 00:43:21,701
- You think that's the man we're looking for?
- I think so, master.

342
00:43:45,173 --> 00:43:46,730
Excuse me, master.

343
00:45:18,663 --> 00:45:20,162
Good evening, sir.

344
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:24,667
It is forbidden to approach
his august personage.

345
00:45:24,753 --> 00:45:26,791
Perhaps you would transmit a message?

346
00:45:26,879 --> 00:45:29,915
I would like to engage his yacht
for a quick trip to Marseilles.

347
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:32,047
I will pay whatever he asks.

348
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:47,974
The ship is yours, sir.
Go where you wish without charge.

349
00:45:48,067 --> 00:45:51,854
However, my master is
an aficionado of the bullfight.

350
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:55,439
That is why he visits here,
to see the festival of the bulls.

351
00:45:55,532 --> 00:45:57,075
I do not understand.

352
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:00,944
He was most interested
in your servant's display of capework.

353
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,742
He would like to see more
tomorrow at the bullfight.

354
00:46:05,626 --> 00:46:08,122
You mean he wants him to enter the ring?

355
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:14,251
- But that will be a massacre!
- Please, master. I'm not afraid. Let me try.

356
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,260

Don't push me.

370
00:50:45,824 --> 00:50:49,493
It's the first time I've seen a real bull.
I don't want to fight.

371
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:57,766
Look at the horns. It's not my size.
Try to be nice to me. Try to be nice.

400

My ship is yours. If you leave now,
you will arrive in Marseilles in 10 hours.

401
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:14,264
- The odds are 30-to-1, gentlemen.
- £50 he doesn't.

402
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:18,907
- What was that, Mr. Vermilyea?
- I said, £50 he doesn't.

403
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:21,536
And 150 he does.

404
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:30,965
Why delude ourselves?
Even if the odds do go down,

405
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:35,258
<i>we know that Fogg got from Marseilles
to Brindisi in time to catch the Mongolia.</i>

406
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:37,799
Ah, but suppose
he doesn't get to Suez in time?

407
00:57:37,894 --> 00:57:39,580
His whole itinerary's
thrown out of schedule.

408
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:42,748
He can't possibly get from Bombay
to Calcutta in time for his connection.

409
00:57:42,837 --> 00:57:47,256
No, our money's as safe, gentlemen,
as if it were in the Bank of England.

410
00:57:47,361 --> 00:57:48,685
Ups, sorry.

411
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:06,504
A bulletin, gentlemen. A late bulletin.
Mr. Phileas Fogg has arrived at Suez!

412
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:28,114
Name, sir?

413
00:58:33,324 --> 00:58:35,526
- Name, sir?
- Passepartout.

414
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:45,077
- Thank you.
- Here! Just a minute.

415
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:49,874
Where's the gentleman who owns
this passport, this Mr. Phileas Fogg?

416
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:52,461
- My master is staying on board.
- Indeed.

417
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:57,568
Well, he'll have to report in person to the
British Consulate to establish his identity.

418
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,971
- Is that necessary?
- Eh, not necessary, mandatory.

419
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:03,515
It's mandatory. This is different, sir.

420
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:07,804
Mr. Fogg is at lunch now,
but I will give him your message.

421
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:51,187
<i>- Hello there.
- Hello, señor.</i>

422
00:59:51,275 --> 00:59:56,379
- Going sightseeing? Perhaps I can help.
- I have to buy some clothing for Mr. Fogg.

423
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:59,007
Well, I can show you an excellent place
quite nearby.

424
00:59:59,097 --> 01:00:00,970
<i>Oh, monsieur is very kind.</i>

425
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:04,142
You see, my master and I
came away without our clothes.

426
01:00:04,228 --> 01:00:06,099
Then I take it you left London hastily?

427
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:09,286
Lucky shoot.
Forty-five minutes after he told me,

428
01:00:09,377 --> 01:00:12,048
- we are off around the world.
- Around the world?

429
01:00:12,131 --> 01:00:16,738
Yes, sir. Around the world in 80 days.
He says it's a wager.

430
01:00:16,845 --> 01:00:21,159
But confidentially, between you and me,
I don't believe a word of it.

431
01:00:21,348 --> 01:00:23,492
Something else in the wind, eh?

432
01:00:23,642 --> 01:00:27,529
<i>I understand he gave the officers
of the Mongolia a bonus</i>

433
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,060
- to get the ship here ahead of time.
- Oh, yes, sir.

434
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:34,793
- He must be a very rich man.
- Ooh, la la, you can't imagine how much

435
01:00:34,883 --> 01:00:39,111
money we carry with us
all in brand-new bank notes.

436
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:41,773
Well, I'm sure
you can take good care of him.

437
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:44,360
No doubt you've been with
Mr. Fogg for years.

438
01:00:44,455 --> 01:00:46,280
Oh, no, sir. On the contrary.

439
01:00:46,372 --> 01:00:49,682
I entered his service
only the day we left London.

440
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:51,366
Indeed.

441
01:00:51,795 --> 01:00:53,206
So he turned up, did he?

442
01:00:53,297 --> 01:00:57,460
Yes, and I must say he gave every indication
of being a thoroughly honest fellow.

443
01:00:57,551 --> 01:00:59,613
Or a very shrewd article.

444
01:00:59,636 --> 01:01:03,337
Here's the description of the robber
I received from London.

445
01:01:04,016 --> 01:01:07,136
Yes. It tallies exactly.
What do you propose to do?

446
01:01:07,227 --> 01:01:09,635
Notify London to send a warrant
to Bombay,

447
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:13,643
I company him there, and arrest him
the moment he sets foot on British soil.

448
01:01:13,733 --> 01:01:15,567
Very enterprising of you, Fix.

449
01:01:15,653 --> 01:01:18,730
A nice ocean voyage
at the expense of Scotland Yard?

450
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:24,070
I beg your pardon, sir. I see my duty,
and I do it. Thank you, sir.

451
01:03:02,593 --> 01:03:06,636
I beg pardon, gentlemen, we're expecting
rather hot weather tomorrow,

452
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:09,048
so I've arranged the menu accordingly:

453
01:03:09,142 --> 01:03:12,309
"Cold breast of chicken,
potted meats and brawn,"

454
01:03:12,436 --> 01:03:15,390
- "curried lamb and rice."
- Hah, capital.

455
01:03:15,396 --> 01:03:18,103
Curry's the only dish
for a chap in this filthy climate.

456
01:03:18,192 --> 01:03:20,641
Purifies the blood,
tones up the system by luncheon...

457
01:03:20,735 --> 01:03:24,258
My lunch will remain the same, steward.
Kindly adhere to my instructions.

458
01:03:24,448 --> 01:03:27,573
Of course, sir.
But all that food on a hot day?

459
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:30,660
Steward, my Thursday midday meal
has always been

460
01:03:30,746 --> 01:03:33,768
and will always be hot soup, fried sole,

461
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:38,292
roast beef and Yorkshire pudding,
baked potatoes, suet pudding and treacle.

462
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,462
Your deal, Bishop.

463
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:56,287
Well, we meet again.
Feeling the heat a bit, are you?

464
01:03:56,438 --> 01:03:58,810
How about a nice lemon squash or a beer?

465
01:03:58,898 --> 01:04:01,309
- It's good.
- Steward!

466
01:04:04,488 --> 01:04:06,528
Bring two lemon squashes.

467
01:04:07,783 --> 01:04:10,950
Great stroke of luck we happen
to be on the same ship, wasn't it.

468
01:04:11,036 --> 01:04:16,160
- And both going to Bombay.
- Oh, yes. A strange coincidence.

469
01:04:16,729 --> 01:04:20,577
- Have you made this trip before?
- Oh, yes, often.

470
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:24,997
I, uh, I'm one of the agents
for the steamship company.

471
01:04:25,135 --> 01:04:28,886
- Oh, you know India well?
- My dear fellow,

472
01:04:28,971 --> 01:04:32,111
I doubt if there are five men
who know it as I do.

473
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:37,578
The mosques, the minarets,
the elephants, the snakes.

474
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:41,397
What about the women?

475
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:46,310
Ha-ha, yes. The women. Superb.

476
01:04:46,405 --> 01:04:51,116
- In what ways superb?
- Goddesses. Ravishing.

477
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:57,987
But, uh, listen, this tour of your master's,
what do you think his real purpose is?

478
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:01,915
Perhaps it's only
a secret diplomatic mission.

479
01:05:01,961 --> 01:05:05,456
I tell you, Mr. Fix.
I really know nothing about it.

480
01:05:05,883 --> 01:05:10,919
Don't change the conversation.
Tell me more about these Indian women.

481
01:05:11,013 --> 01:05:13,215
Well, now, let me see.

482
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:17,175
Would you excuse me?
I will be back in a minute.

483
01:05:28,573 --> 01:05:32,614
Bombay by dawn tomorrow, Mr. Fogg.
Two days ahead of schedule.

484
01:05:32,722 --> 01:05:36,367
- That's a new record for the run.
- A remarkable achievement, Captain,

485
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:39,394
and one that deserves
adequate recognition.

486
01:05:39,499 --> 01:05:41,208
- My compliments to you.
- Thank you.

487
01:05:41,293 --> 01:05:44,537
And the chief engineer. Uh, as arranged.

488
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:48,272
Now listen to me carefully.

489
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,645
Here's the list of the gear we'll so need
on our journey across Calcutta.

490
01:06:51,738 --> 01:06:55,238
While you're getting that,
I'll deal with the passports and the tickets.

491
01:06:55,326 --> 01:06:59,025
The train leaves at 4:00.
We'll meet at the railway station.

492
01:06:59,571 --> 01:07:01,137
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

493
01:09:07,656 --> 01:09:09,722
Mooo!

494
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:28,341
Infidel! How dare you!
That's a sacred animal!

495
01:10:12,523 --> 01:10:14,523
We've no warrant for this fellow's arrest.

496
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:16,817
The whole thing
is highly irregular, dash it all!

497
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:19,628
But he's the culprit, I swear to you.

498
01:10:19,697 --> 01:10:23,751
Wait a moment. I have an idea.
You issue the order for this arrest.

499
01:10:23,847 --> 01:10:29,204
- What? I couldn't do a thing like that!
- Not even for a reward of £2,000?

500
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:34,877
- Needless to say, I'd be willing to divide it.
- £1,000? No, Mr. Fix.

501
01:10:34,941 --> 01:10:35,998
The matter involves London.

502
01:10:36,087 --> 01:10:39,458
And the London office alone
can legally deliver the warrant.

503
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:42,883
Once Fogg's outside British jurisdiction,
I'll never get him.

504
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:49,819
- Quite. Good heavens! 4:00. It's tea time.
- Yes, I know. But this is a crisis.

505
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:52,937
Crisis or no,
nothing should interfere with tea.

506
01:10:58,276 --> 01:11:00,559
Devil take the man. Where could he be?

507
01:11:00,654 --> 01:11:05,567
Oh, chasing after some woman or other,
I suppose. These foreigners, you know.

508
01:11:08,995 --> 01:11:10,657
Come on, man! Come on!

509
01:11:13,392 --> 01:11:15,477
Come on, man! Come on!

510
01:11:25,054 --> 01:11:28,387
- Thank you, master.
- There will be no further fiddle-faddle.

511
01:15:40,768 --> 01:15:44,760
Yes, Fogg, There was a time
when one could scarcely traveling

512
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:47,689
in this part of the country
without encountering corpses.

513
01:15:47,774 --> 01:15:50,184
Those infamous stranglers.

514
01:15:50,714 --> 01:15:52,650
What did you say the named that sect was?

515
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:54,483
- Thuggee.
- Thuggee.

516
01:15:54,583 --> 01:16:01,287
Uh-huh. Individual members are known as Thugs.
They worship Kali, the goddess of death.

517
01:16:01,372 --> 01:16:06,430
They slay without discrimination.
Any age, sex, color.

518
01:16:06,564 --> 01:16:08,915
How did you finally
manage to stamp them out?

519
01:16:09,003 --> 01:16:11,642
Oh, we didn't. Not entirely.

520
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:14,591
Our constabulary managed
to diminish the number of murders,

521
01:16:14,677 --> 01:16:17,428
but we're forced to recognize
the Thuggee still exists.

522
01:16:17,513 --> 01:16:22,304
Every few months we come across a few
of the wretches at their ghastly rites.

523
01:16:26,355 --> 01:16:28,810
Strange we should stop hereabouts.

524
01:16:29,108 --> 01:16:32,108
Timetable makes no mention
of a station in this vicinity.

525
01:16:32,193 --> 01:16:35,410
I have no idea. To tell you the truth,
I haven't been on this line

526
01:16:35,535 --> 01:16:37,612
since they announced its completion.

527
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:38,738
Hmm.

528
01:16:55,175 --> 01:17:00,844
- Excuse me, sir. What is the difficulty?
- Difficulty? None whatever.

529
01:17:00,931 --> 01:17:02,965
This is the end of the line.

530
01:17:03,057 --> 01:17:05,094
- End of the line?
- Yes.

531
01:17:05,227 --> 01:17:09,354
There's still 50 miles of track to be laid
between here and Allahabad.

532
01:17:09,543 --> 01:17:12,725
But the London newspapers announced
the opening of this railway throughout.

533
01:17:12,818 --> 01:17:16,103
<i>It must have been The Daily Telegraph.
Never have read that in The Times.</i>

534
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:20,990
The fact remains, sir, that you sold tickets from
Bombay to Calcutta! That's fraud, sir. Fraud!

535
01:17:21,075 --> 01:17:23,614
I shall take this up with the Viceroy!

536
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:28,033
The notice in our Bombay station
is quite clearly posted as it is here:

537
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:31,125
"Passengers must provide
their own transportation"

538
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:34,294
- "between Kholby and Allahabad."
- All through the bush?

539
01:17:34,423 --> 01:17:37,109
I'm sorry if this inconveniences, gentlemen.

540
01:17:37,197 --> 01:17:40,756
It does indeed. I happen to be rejoining
my brigade, the 10th Jubbulpore.

541
01:17:40,845 --> 01:17:43,302
My friend here stands
to lose a considerable sum of money.

542
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:47,175
Not at all. I made provision
for precisely that sort of eventuality.

543
01:17:47,268 --> 01:17:49,593
Oh, come on, man,
you couldn't possibly have foreseen this.

544
01:17:49,687 --> 01:17:52,474
No, but I did expect some such obstacle
to arise en route.

545
01:17:52,565 --> 01:17:55,793
And I took the precaution of gaining two
extra days while crossing the Arabian Sea.

546
01:17:55,882 --> 01:17:59,404
Now, a steamer leaves Calcutta at noon
on the 25th for Hong Kong.

547
01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:00,418
Our only problem at the moment is

548
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:03,024
to find some form of conveyance
from here to Allahabad.

549
01:18:03,118 --> 01:18:05,682
Other than the oxcart,
nothing can get through that jungle.

550
01:18:05,746 --> 01:18:10,946
- Hmm. What about an elephant?
- Well, I do happen to know of one,

551
01:18:11,042 --> 01:18:13,369
but I doubt
if the owner would part with her.

552
01:18:13,463 --> 01:18:16,691
- Why not?
- She sleeps in the house, with the family.

553
01:18:16,756 --> 01:18:18,205
A pet.

554
01:18:21,095 --> 01:18:24,842
£1,000 for an elephant?
It's outrageous! You've been diddled.

555
01:18:24,931 --> 01:18:28,929
Undoubtedly, but it's not often
one needs an elephant in a hurry.

556
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:54,327
- What is that?
- Tiger. A royal Bengal tiger.

557
01:18:54,421 --> 01:18:56,660
They rarely attack an elephant.

558
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:21,504
Oh, yes.

559
01:19:31,914 --> 01:19:34,751
- What the deuce are you doing?
- Quiet, sir.

560
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:40,037
- Is bad.
- What is it?

561
01:19:40,174 --> 01:19:44,759
It's a religious procession of some sort.
Rather sticky if they spot us.

562
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:50,678
Hmm. I think we had better look into this.

563
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:55,333
Shh!

564
01:20:27,638 --> 01:20:30,721
Kali, the goddess of love and death.

565
01:20:30,807 --> 01:20:34,808
<i>Sahib, please!
If they hear our voices, we will be slain.</i>

566
01:20:44,457 --> 01:20:48,898
<i>- Hmm. Suttee.
- What do you mean by that?</i>

567
01:20:48,993 --> 01:20:51,661
A human sacrifice, but a voluntary one.

568
01:20:51,744 --> 01:20:55,410
The lady you've just seen is to be burned
on funeral pyre of her husband's.

569
01:20:55,499 --> 01:20:56,577
Scoundrels.

570
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:59,583
You actually mean that unfortunate
young woman is going to be burned alive?

571
01:20:59,669 --> 01:21:02,644
Oh, she's quite resigned to it.
It's a matter of religious belief.

572
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:05,465
This area's not under British jurisdiction.
There's nothing we can do.

573
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:08,717
<i>Forgive me, sahib. But the lady
does not wish to commit Suttee.</i>

574
01:21:08,804 --> 01:21:10,262
- She is being forced.
- What?

575
01:21:10,346 --> 01:21:11,923
Everyone knows of this affair.

576
01:21:12,014 --> 01:21:14,685
Her husband was a rajah
and very influential.

577
01:21:14,768 --> 01:21:19,096
- The custom is that she must die with him.
- Where is this wretched murder to take place?

578
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:22,059
The pagoda of Pillaji. Two miles from here.

579
01:21:22,693 --> 01:21:24,235
What if we decided to save her?

580
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,216
Good heaven, man,
you can't interfere with native affairs.

581
01:21:26,345 --> 01:21:28,812
- Why not?
- Err, this is done!

582
01:21:28,906 --> 01:21:31,576
My master does things
other people do not, sir.

583
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:33,617
You think you can rescue Aouda, sir?

584
01:21:33,704 --> 01:21:36,241
<i>- Is that the lady's name?
- Yes, sahib. Aouda.</i>

585
01:21:36,373 --> 01:21:41,369
Very fine person. Very beautiful.
Very. She was educated in England.

586
01:21:42,296 --> 01:21:43,494
That decides it.

587
01:21:43,589 --> 01:21:45,665
General, we place ourselves
under your command.

588
01:21:45,758 --> 01:21:48,593
Right.
Now, our first step is to reconnoiter.

589
01:21:48,618 --> 01:21:50,285
Now, uh...

590
01:21:51,304 --> 01:21:52,545
Follow me.

591
01:22:17,715 --> 01:22:21,325
Devilish! There are guards
all about the temple.

592
01:22:21,418 --> 01:22:24,621
- I can't seem to find an opening.
- And the Princess?

593
01:22:24,713 --> 01:22:29,339
- Inside. Surrounded by armed men.
- What course would you suggest?

594
01:22:29,425 --> 01:22:32,464
Oh, simple. Outflank the beggars.

595
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:38,225
- Now. Here's the temple. No, no, here.
- Mm-hmm.

596
01:22:38,249 --> 01:22:40,310
Here's the funeral pyre.

597
01:22:40,311 --> 01:22:45,103
We create a distractionary action here,
start a sortie here.

598
01:22:45,233 --> 01:22:48,402
- General, I have a plan.
- Please!

599
01:22:49,071 --> 01:22:51,478
Then we infiltrate
the guards from the rear.

600
01:22:51,572 --> 01:22:55,858
- Excellent.
- Exactly. Only one problem.

601
01:22:56,244 --> 01:22:59,947
This plan can't possibly work
with less than 75 men.

602
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:04,323
So, speaking as a strategist, I should say
our position here is untenable.

603
01:23:04,419 --> 01:23:07,538
Neverless, whatever the odds,
I'm determined to abstract that young woman.

604
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:10,466
Even though we're only four.
Passepartout...

605
01:23:10,804 --> 01:23:15,421
Passepartout.
Well, now where the devil is he? But...

606
01:24:03,218 --> 01:24:06,219
Aah! Aah! Aah!

607
01:25:05,164 --> 01:25:06,784
Hurry up! Come on!

608
01:25:08,064 --> 01:25:11,356
- Oh, gentlemen, you have rescued me! All of you.
- This is no time to demonstrate your gratitude.

609
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:13,129
Allow me to help you.

610
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,347
"Speechless at the violation
of a native temple"

611
01:25:28,438 --> 01:25:30,477
"and the abduction
of an Indian Princess"

612
01:25:30,565 --> 01:25:34,148
"by Mr. Phileas Fogg,
the authorities have arrested him."

613
01:25:37,155 --> 01:25:39,906
"An Indian Princess". Lucky dog!

614
01:25:39,991 --> 01:25:44,037
An absolute scandal, according to this.
The whole peninsula's up in arms against.

615
01:25:44,163 --> 01:25:47,163
Wonder what she's like.
A handsome creature, I'll be bound.

616
01:25:47,248 --> 01:25:49,324
Always thought old Fogg
had a twinkle in his eye.

617
01:25:49,417 --> 01:25:52,372
Handsome or not,
this business of barging about a native temple

618
01:25:52,462 --> 01:25:54,439
with one boots on is a very serious matter.

619
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:57,423
Could have been, if Fogg hadn't posted bail
and caught the next ship.

620
01:25:57,508 --> 01:26:00,843
I'm beginning to think our colleague's
a good bit cleverer than we supposed.

621
01:26:00,929 --> 01:26:03,301
A devious type, I'd rather say.

622
01:26:03,389 --> 01:26:08,931
<i>Let me see, if he's on the S.S. Rangoon,
he must be halfway to Hong Kong by now.</i>

623
01:26:14,567 --> 01:26:15,810
Somewhere here.

624
01:26:15,882 --> 01:26:17,682
- Uh...
- Uh.

625
01:27:31,019 --> 01:27:33,723
So I did the only decent thing
a man could do.

626
01:27:33,812 --> 01:27:36,436
- You mean...
- Yes, I finessed my queen of hearts

627
01:27:36,526 --> 01:27:39,561
and forced Finch-Tattersall
to sacrifice his ace.

628
01:27:39,652 --> 01:27:41,146
It was a tense moment, I can assure you.

629
01:27:41,237 --> 01:27:43,230
I wish you had seen
Lord Dudley's expression.

630
01:27:43,323 --> 01:27:45,999
Poor fellow went dead white.
Bit clean through his pipe stem.

631
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:48,201
Heh. Oh, well.

632
01:27:48,307 --> 01:27:51,951
- But I'm afraid I've bored you.
- How can you say that, Mr. Fogg?

633
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,740
Oh, I don't think that in my entire life.

634
01:27:55,794 --> 01:27:58,665
That's the most enthralling story
I've ever heard.

635
01:27:58,756 --> 01:27:59,393
Do you really mean that?

636
01:27:59,523 --> 01:28:02,001
- I'm most awfully pleased.
- It's so...

637
01:28:02,112 --> 01:28:06,136
- It's so personal and yet dramatic.
- That's exactly the way I feel about it!

638
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,282
I had no idea
you were so keen about whist.

639
01:28:08,368 --> 01:28:11,884
I adore it.
There is a kind of precision about it.

640
01:28:12,101 --> 01:28:17,180
I've always admired men who are precise,
who have a sense of order and discipline.

641
01:28:17,274 --> 01:28:20,095
- Fancy that.
- Yes, for example.

642
01:28:20,323 --> 01:28:24,321
Well, I simply cannot abide
a man who isn't punctual.

643
01:28:24,657 --> 01:28:27,325
It's extraordinary how well you put it.

644
01:28:27,449 --> 01:28:31,995
We have so little time
in our brief mortal span.

645
01:28:33,061 --> 01:28:35,197
Oh, my dear Princess,
I really must ask your forgiveness.

646
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:38,177
- Why, whatever for?
- It just dawned upon me I completely forgot to

647
01:28:38,273 --> 01:28:40,332
offer my condolences
upon your bereavement.

648
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,269
- What?
- To extend my sympathy

649
01:28:42,361 --> 01:28:44,961
for your anguish at this time of grief.

650
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:49,252
- But I don't feel any grief, Mr. Fogg.
- None at all?

651
01:28:49,973 --> 01:28:52,616
You see, I was a wife in name only.

652
01:28:52,725 --> 01:28:56,365
I met the late rajah exactly once,
at the age of seven,

653
01:28:56,459 --> 01:28:59,769
before my parents sent me
to England for my education.

654
01:28:59,857 --> 01:29:02,234
And you never saw him again?

655
01:29:03,028 --> 01:29:04,398
Never.

656
01:29:06,656 --> 01:29:11,368
Would you care to hear about the time
I drew a flush hand in diamonds?

657
01:29:11,744 --> 01:29:14,154
If you'd care to confide in me.

658
01:29:23,298 --> 01:29:26,915
Is Mr. Fogg always so proper,
haughty and formal?

659
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:32,753
Believe me, madame, I know nothing
about him except that he lives by this.

660
01:29:34,766 --> 01:29:36,559
Have there been any women in his life?

661
01:29:36,644 --> 01:29:40,829
I assume that he must have had a mother,
but I am not certain.

662
01:29:40,857 --> 01:29:45,015
Perhaps he has some secret sorrow,
some love who jilted him.

663
01:29:45,195 --> 01:29:49,594
He has only one love, madame. Cards. Whist.

664
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:54,945
He thinks of nothing but the whist,
morning, noon, and night.

665
01:29:55,956 --> 01:29:58,326
Oh, very interesting.

666
01:30:27,445 --> 01:30:31,922
Yes, he's a cool article, Mr. Tally.
A very unpredictable cove.

667
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:35,115
Just when you think you've cornered him,
he gives you the slip.

668
01:30:35,202 --> 01:30:38,615
- Got you puzzled, has he?
- Yes, by jingo, he has.

669
01:30:39,248 --> 01:30:43,116
Look at this heathen young woman,
for instance, this Mrs. Aouda.

670
01:30:43,211 --> 01:30:44,774
I know my man, Tally.

671
01:30:44,921 --> 01:30:47,799
And I tell you,
she don't fit into the pattern.

672
01:30:47,924 --> 01:30:50,711
He was down here, you know,
about an hour ago.

673
01:30:50,802 --> 01:30:52,091
- He was?
- Mm.

674
01:30:52,215 --> 01:30:55,590
- What did he want?
- Oh, this, that, and the other.

675
01:31:10,509 --> 01:31:12,813
He was quizzing me
about steamships out of Hong Kong.

676
01:31:12,908 --> 01:31:14,104
- For where?
- Yokohama.

677
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:15,991
We're due at Hong Kong at noon tomorrow.

678
01:31:16,078 --> 01:31:18,324
<i>And he sails on the S.S. Carnatic
at 8:00 the following day.</i>

679
01:31:18,433 --> 01:31:21,368
Ha-ha, that's what he thinks,
but I'll nail him this time

680
01:31:21,457 --> 01:31:23,331
you can pledge your last farthing on that.

681
01:31:23,418 --> 01:31:25,874
You didn't do so well at Calcutta,
according to you own stake.

682
01:31:25,963 --> 01:31:30,706
What could I do? I got him and
his servant's bail set at £1,000 a piece.

683
01:31:30,801 --> 01:31:35,503
And he hands it over without batting a lash.
If that blasted warrant had only arrived.

684
01:31:35,596 --> 01:31:39,428
<i>Cheer up. You've got 20 hours to get him
in Hong Kong before the Carnatic sails.</i>

685
01:31:39,517 --> 01:31:43,349
Yes, sir, I'll lag the blighter there
if I have to turn out the Governor to do it!

686
01:31:43,438 --> 01:31:48,481
A bulldog tenacity, Mr. Fix,
that's the spirit that built an empire.

687
01:32:04,251 --> 01:32:09,794
"134 Lower Lascar Road, Victoria." We will now
go in search of your uncle, Mr. Cominjee.

688
01:32:12,322 --> 01:32:15,554
134 Lower Lascar Road, Victoria.

689
01:32:24,021 --> 01:32:27,224
Here, follow that rickshaw, chop-chop!

690
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:30,482
Chop-chop!

691
01:32:52,611 --> 01:32:53,835
Here's a pretty kettle of fish.

692
01:32:53,925 --> 01:32:56,470
A man trying to run a business,
and the door's locked. I wonder what...

693
01:32:56,705 --> 01:33:02,115
Ah! Uh, boss man here?
Him back pretty soon?

694
01:33:02,224 --> 01:33:05,989
I should say the probabilities
are strongly against it.

695
01:33:06,103 --> 01:33:10,107
- I beg your pardon. Where is Mr. Cominjee?
- In Holland, I believe.

696
01:33:10,191 --> 01:33:13,892
He amassed a considerable fortune
by means I shall not attempt to describe,

697
01:33:13,987 --> 01:33:16,630
and has retired to Amsterdam
to raise tulips.

698
01:33:16,718 --> 01:33:19,485
He might at least have left a card
on his door to that effect.

699
01:33:19,575 --> 01:33:23,927
The gentleman was quite illiterate, sir,
and moreover, he was pressed for time.

700
01:33:24,017 --> 01:33:27,616
He retired 10 minutes
before the constables arrived.

701
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:31,953
Well, that alters things quite a bit.

702
01:33:32,047 --> 01:33:35,295
Obviously, the Princess cannot remain here
alone, in Hong Kong.

703
01:33:35,382 --> 01:33:36,900
There would seem to be
only one alternative.

704
01:33:36,925 --> 01:33:39,402
Oh, Mr. Fogg,
I know what you're going to say,

705
01:33:39,492 --> 01:33:41,759
but please don't send me back to India.

706
01:33:41,848 --> 01:33:44,933
If you will excuse me, sir,
I agree with the Princess.

707
01:33:45,018 --> 01:33:48,726
- You know, she has suffered very much.
- Your fears are groundless.

708
01:33:48,751 --> 01:33:51,228
I have no intention
of returning the Princess to India.

709
01:33:51,316 --> 01:33:52,808
She is our responsibility.

710
01:33:52,937 --> 01:33:55,235
- And will continue with us to Europe.
- Yes, sir.

711
01:33:55,339 --> 01:33:58,820
I will escort her to the Royal Court Hotel
and find accommodation for tonight.

712
01:33:58,907 --> 01:34:00,449
- You will buy the tickets.
- Yes, sir.

713
01:34:00,533 --> 01:34:04,612
<i>Three cabins on the Carnatic,
sailing tomorrow morning for Yokohama.</i>

714
01:34:04,704 --> 01:34:08,076
- And don't dilly-dally.
- Oh, no dilly-dally.

715
01:34:18,176 --> 01:34:21,428
Here, you, follow that ostrich!

716
01:34:26,873 --> 01:34:27,872
Giddy-up!

717
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:30,575
Giddy-up!

718
01:34:53,794 --> 01:34:57,546
<i>Well, strike me,
it's my old friend of the Rangoon.</i>

719
01:34:57,633 --> 01:35:00,039
Oh, hello, sir. Excuse me one minute.

720
01:35:00,802 --> 01:35:02,937
<i>Three cabins on the steamer Carnatic,
please.</i>

721
01:35:03,032 --> 01:35:06,223
Yes, sir. There's been a slight change
in the schedule, sir.

722
01:35:06,308 --> 01:35:09,225
She sails tonight instead of
in the morning as orginally planned.

723
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:12,349
- I didn't know, but all the better.
- Thank you.

724
01:35:15,484 --> 01:35:17,901
That will be all. Well, I...

725
01:35:18,006 --> 01:35:22,029
- I trust that you will be comfortable here.
- Oh, yes, thank you. I'm sure I will.

726
01:35:22,115 --> 01:35:24,571
It's very kind of you
to concern yourself about me.

727
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,690
Oh, not at all.

728
01:35:25,785 --> 01:35:29,699
Since you are temporarily alone in the world,
the least I can do is look after your welfare.

729
01:35:29,789 --> 01:35:31,746
I'm afraid I must have been a burden.

730
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:35,332
Quite the reverse, I assure you.
Your company has been most welcome.

731
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:39,704
I only wish I could express
my infinite gratitude.

732
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,754
Please, you shouldn't do that sort of thing.

733
01:35:44,887 --> 01:35:49,135
Mr. Fogg, why must you be so British?

734
01:35:50,183 --> 01:35:57,604
- Madame, I am what I am.
- No. You're kind and warm and generous.

735
01:35:58,163 --> 01:35:59,529
Ahem.

736
01:35:59,569 --> 01:36:00,833
Would you care to join me on the veranda?

737
01:36:00,858 --> 01:36:04,066
I understand they serve
an outstanding lemon squash.

738
01:36:06,409 --> 01:36:07,784
If you wish.

739
01:36:12,499 --> 01:36:15,784
- I see you're leaving Hong Kong.
- Correct, my friend.

740
01:36:15,877 --> 01:36:19,267
- And 12 hours ahead of time.
- Well, now think of that.

741
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:21,461
Nothing stops you and Mr. Fogg, does it?

742
01:36:21,549 --> 01:36:23,152
Oh, what name do you want
on these tickets, sir?

743
01:36:23,281 --> 01:36:24,717
- Just copy these.
- Thank You.

744
01:36:24,802 --> 01:36:27,969
Eh, look here,
since we may not see each other again,

745
01:36:28,056 --> 01:36:30,891
why don't we have
a little farewell drink together?

746
01:36:30,975 --> 01:36:32,299
Good idea.

747
01:36:33,311 --> 01:36:35,222
Nice and cozy, eh?

748
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:39,269
Over here.

749
01:36:41,278 --> 01:36:44,694
Remember, we don't have very much time, sir.
I have to get my tickets.

750
01:36:44,782 --> 01:36:48,614
Nonsense. We'll send a boy for them.
Here, you.

751
01:36:51,099 --> 01:36:54,697
You know the Transpacific Guess
Steamship Company in Canton Road?

752
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:57,709
- Near post office?
- Yes, yes. Send someone over there.

753
01:36:57,795 --> 01:37:00,603
Pick up tickets for Mr. Passepartout.

754
01:37:00,673 --> 01:37:03,212
- Passeport, too?
- Yes.

755
01:37:03,508 --> 01:37:06,343
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, old boy, what will it be?

756
01:37:06,427 --> 01:37:08,503
- A lemon squash.
- Poppycock.

757
01:37:08,596 --> 01:37:11,632
I said that I'd buy you a drink,
and I meant a man's drink.

758
01:37:11,724 --> 01:37:15,259
All right, anything you want,
but not too strong, please.

759
01:37:15,415 --> 01:37:19,930
Eh, my friend and I will have
a Hong Kong Snickersnee.

760
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:25,817
- What is that?
- It's indescribable. Liquid music.

761
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:31,401
It warms the heart,
fires the imagination, broadens the horizon.

762
01:37:31,744 --> 01:37:34,033
- What happened?
- A local color.

763
01:37:34,226 --> 01:37:36,991
The sort of a show they put on
for the tourists.

764
01:37:37,082 --> 01:37:38,364
Looks very real to me.

765
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:42,247
They're just boisterous children.
Ignore them.

766
01:37:42,672 --> 01:37:44,547
Now, look here, Passepartout.

767
01:37:44,633 --> 01:37:48,002
You've been square with me,
and I intend to behave the same.

768
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:51,795
Do you still think I'm an agent
for those fellows at the Reform Club?

769
01:37:51,889 --> 01:37:54,640
- No, but I don't know what you are.
- Then I'll tell you.

770
01:37:54,725 --> 01:37:56,848
I'm a professional detective.

771
01:37:56,935 --> 01:38:00,824
And I'm in pursuit of a very cunning,
very slippery criminal.

772
01:38:00,919 --> 01:38:01,811
Who?

773
01:38:01,899 --> 01:38:05,726
Phileas Fogg,
esquire of Saville Row, London.

774
01:38:05,903 --> 01:38:09,275
- What? My master?
- The same.

775
01:38:15,663 --> 01:38:17,948
Then what do you want from me?

776
01:38:17,999 --> 01:38:23,391
Eh, time. Just help me delay him 24 hours
till my warrant arrives.

777
01:38:23,504 --> 01:38:27,006
All I need is a little cooperation
on your part.

778
01:38:27,091 --> 01:38:31,007
A little cooperation?
Do you think I'd betray Mr. Fogg?

779
01:38:31,388 --> 01:38:33,262
I don't care how much money you offer me...

780
01:38:33,349 --> 01:38:37,180
All right, all right, you needn't get angry.
I don't blame you, in a way.

781
01:38:37,268 --> 01:38:41,370
It shows you're a loyal and
trustworthy chap, and I respect that.

782
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:46,233
Here. Let's have a little libation
on the altar of friendship.

783
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:51,321
And you insult my master.
I don't want to drink with you.

784
01:38:51,617 --> 01:38:53,608
Rot. You told me where you stood.

785
01:38:53,701 --> 01:38:57,116
And I say bravo
to a man who sticks to his principles.

786
01:38:57,204 --> 01:39:01,038
Here. Confusion to the enemies
of the Crown.

787
01:39:07,674 --> 01:39:09,834
I can't believe it.

788
01:41:12,145 --> 01:41:13,344
Ha.

789
01:41:14,467 --> 01:41:17,586
Honorable gentleman
feeling better this morning?

790
01:41:18,597 --> 01:41:20,590
What are you doing here?

791
01:41:22,475 --> 01:41:25,641
Why is the hotel moving this way?

792
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:30,562
<i>What? Steamship, not hotel.
You're on board the steamship Carnatic.</i>

793
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:32,986
<i>Carnatic.</i>

794
01:41:33,027 --> 01:41:36,362
Yes. We go Shanghai,
then we go Yokohama.

795
01:41:36,501 --> 01:41:37,901
Oh!

796
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:47,036
Finished?

797
01:41:49,794 --> 01:41:52,464
- Where is Mr. Fogg's cabin?
- Oh, next door.

798
01:41:52,547 --> 01:41:55,003
Oh, but Mr. Fogg not on board.

799
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,962
- What about the Princess?
- Princess? No, no, no, you come alone.

800
01:42:00,054 --> 01:42:02,129
Police, they find ticket in your pocket.

801
01:42:02,222 --> 01:42:05,177
Carry you here. You sleep like baby.

802
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:11,264
I betrayed my master. Everything is lost.

803
01:42:15,653 --> 01:42:17,397
What about my money?

804
01:42:17,487 --> 01:42:21,396
- They robbed me, too.
- Oh, it is bad.

805
01:42:21,491 --> 01:42:26,657
You not like Yokohama.
You not have money, Yokohama not like you.

806
01:42:29,605 --> 01:42:32,578
Oh, I betrayed my master.

807
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,767
<i>My good man,
I realize the Carnatic couldn't wait.</i>

808
01:42:35,862 --> 01:42:38,232
The point now
is what other vessel can we get?

809
01:42:38,321 --> 01:42:40,674
Nothing that could make
the voyage to Yokohama, sir.

810
01:42:40,763 --> 01:42:42,775
No steam packet, tug, or lighter?

811
01:42:42,867 --> 01:42:44,756
There must be something
in a port this size.

812
01:42:44,849 --> 01:42:46,925
At the moment, not a thing.

813
01:42:57,548 --> 01:42:59,771
Ah, good morning, Mr. Fogg.

814
01:43:00,031 --> 01:43:02,901
<i>- I'm afraid I don't, uh...
- We traveled together aboard the Rangoon.</i>

815
01:43:02,992 --> 01:43:06,242
- And my name is Fix.
- Ah, yes, Mr. Fix. How do you do?

816
01:43:06,997 --> 01:43:09,057
I believe you know my manservant,
do you not?

817
01:43:09,082 --> 01:43:12,323
Well, very slightly.
Why? Has something happened to him?

818
01:43:12,454 --> 01:43:14,410
Yes, confound it,
the fellow seems to have disappeared.

819
01:43:14,504 --> 01:43:18,984
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. He's a nice chap.
- I think I shall have to inform the police.

820
01:43:19,071 --> 01:43:22,550
I shouldn't do that,
if I were you. He'll turn up.

821
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:25,716
- Uh, missed your boat, eh?
- Yes.

822
01:43:25,807 --> 01:43:27,805
Oh, well,
there'll be another along in a week.

823
01:43:27,934 --> 01:43:29,057
I shall not be here.

824
01:43:29,143 --> 01:43:31,219
- No?
- Yokohama is my destination.

825
01:43:31,312 --> 01:43:33,850
- I shall get there if I have to swim.
- Oh.

826
01:43:40,570 --> 01:43:43,241
Now we are on a direct course
for Yokohama.

827
01:43:43,324 --> 01:43:46,382
<i>The Carnatic is bound first for Shanghai.</i>

828
01:43:46,473 --> 01:43:48,575
We may arrive in Yokohama
the day after her.

829
01:43:48,663 --> 01:43:52,328
<i>We're still in plenty of time to catch
the General Grant for San Francisco.</i>

830
01:48:04,961 --> 01:48:08,892
Very sporting of you
to let me share your craft, Mr. Fogg.

831
01:48:09,007 --> 01:48:11,842
Oh, nonsense.
Anything for a fellow Englishman.

832
01:48:11,926 --> 01:48:14,989
I trust your cousin in San Francisco
will be better by the time we arrive.

833
01:48:15,117 --> 01:48:19,767
- Yes, sir. Poor old Marmaduke.
- Thank you.

834
01:48:19,891 --> 01:48:21,173
Princess.

835
01:48:22,103 --> 01:48:23,631
- Fish, Fix?
- Oh.

836
01:48:35,366 --> 01:48:39,911
Steady, Mr. Fix. Fujiyama ahead.
We'll be in Yokohama by morning.

837
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,337
<i>Ah! There's the Carnatic.</i>

838
01:48:56,428 --> 01:48:59,844
<i>I imagine that steamship just behind her
is the General Grant.</i>

839
01:48:59,932 --> 01:49:02,221
Now the only thing missing is Passepartout.

840
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:04,881
The police in Hong Kong
said they put him on board.

841
01:49:04,978 --> 01:49:07,766
They also said he was penniless.
So we may have one clue.

842
01:49:07,857 --> 01:49:10,608
The man is a jack-of-all-trades.
He's told me a few of them.

843
01:49:10,692 --> 01:49:12,899
We might be able to find him by deduction.

844
01:49:12,987 --> 01:49:15,656
That is the new science employed
by our British police, Mr. Fix.

845
01:49:15,739 --> 01:49:20,381
Really? I learn something useful
every moment I'm with you, Mr. Fogg.

846
01:49:20,515 --> 01:49:24,280
Well, I hope you find your man.

847
01:50:25,477 --> 01:50:27,891
Two orchestra stalls, please.

848
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:50,200
The Great Scott. Look.

849
01:50:52,625 --> 01:50:54,711
- Passepartout.
- Ssst.

850
01:50:54,964 --> 01:50:56,377
Master!

851
01:51:03,848 --> 01:51:07,382
- Master, what genius to find me.
- Merely logic. Now come along.

852
01:51:07,475 --> 01:51:10,681
<i>The General Grant is preparing to sail,
and we haven't a moment to lose.</i>

853
01:51:28,498 --> 01:51:33,042
What a pity. Mr. Fogg has already
organized his whist game.

854
01:51:35,296 --> 01:51:37,621
Princess, Mr. Fix is a detective.

855
01:51:37,714 --> 01:51:40,441
He thinks Mr. Fogg has robbed
the Bank of England.

856
01:51:40,531 --> 01:51:42,626
Nothing escapes Mr. Fogg.

857
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,402
- But...
- Mr. Fix won't delay us.

858
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:47,216
We're out of the British jurisdiction now.

859
01:56:47,572 --> 01:56:49,149
He's in America.

860
01:57:24,937 --> 01:57:29,960
Don't tell me about men. They're all alike.
I wouldn't trust the best of them.

861
01:57:30,047 --> 01:57:33,443
Well, this here Phileas Fogg,
I'm sure he's different.

862
01:57:33,548 --> 01:57:37,110
It takes a gallant, adventurous bloke
to dash around the world like that.

863
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:38,761
Oh, don't be so soppy.

864
01:57:38,845 --> 01:57:42,593
He's probably running away
from some housemaid he ruined.

865
01:57:42,681 --> 01:57:47,138
Oh, you do have a horrid mind, Cora.
I think he's terribly romantic.

866
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:49,767
- They say he's so good-looking.
- Oh, rot.

867
01:57:49,876 --> 01:57:54,601
I don't care if he's Venus,
Adonis and Mercury both.

868
01:57:54,630 --> 01:57:57,339
He'll never do it in 80 days.

869
01:57:57,424 --> 01:58:00,925
- I bet you 10 Bob he don't.
- I'll take that.

870
01:58:01,512 --> 01:58:03,135
Here's my money.

871
01:58:03,721 --> 01:58:06,760
- Where's yours?
- Here it is. Oh!

872
01:58:06,786 --> 01:58:11,096
- What's up?
- Call a Bobby! I've been robbed.

873
01:58:29,619 --> 01:58:31,633
The voice of all our citizens!

874
01:58:31,725 --> 01:58:36,248
- I ask you, who will you vote for?
- Mandiboy!

875
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:38,483
Mandiboy is our man!

876
02:00:04,868 --> 02:00:07,069
Please, Mr. Fogg, let me watch.

877
02:00:10,123 --> 02:00:15,976
- Is this a religious spectacle?
- Some kind of an election, I would judge.

878
02:00:16,003 --> 02:00:20,359
Ah, perhaps they are creating
a new president.

879
02:00:20,423 --> 02:00:23,626
Well, whatever it is,
I suggest that we move over there.

880
02:00:48,156 --> 02:00:53,759
Bye! Bye! Bye-bye! Bye!

881
02:01:44,809 --> 02:01:46,198
Thank you, sir.

882
02:01:56,528 --> 02:01:59,626
Why don't you eat with a fork
like everybody else?

883
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,842
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

884
02:02:08,454 --> 02:02:11,762
Thank you. It's good.

885
02:02:14,877 --> 02:02:16,225
For you.

886
02:02:18,067 --> 02:02:20,311
- It's good.
- Here.

887
02:02:29,452 --> 02:02:30,993
Do you like it?

888
02:02:32,704 --> 02:02:35,868
- I'll eat it later.
- Scrambled eggs.

889
02:02:45,841 --> 02:02:49,880
How many times did I have to tell you
to stay out of here, you donkey? Come on.

890
02:02:49,971 --> 02:02:51,552
Louder, son.

891
02:03:02,334 --> 02:03:03,428
Looking for someone?

892
02:03:03,523 --> 02:03:06,524
Yes, a small, dark fellow.
He wandered in here a few moments ago.

893
02:03:06,609 --> 02:03:10,108
Could be almost anybody.
Sit down and describe him to me.

894
02:03:10,195 --> 02:03:13,729
- I'm afraid I can't. I'm in somewhat of a hurry.
- Never be in a hurry.

895
02:03:13,823 --> 02:03:15,614
You'll miss the best parts in life.

896
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:18,866
Madame, you don't understand.
I'm looking for my man.

897
02:03:18,954 --> 02:03:20,567
So am I.

898
02:03:21,663 --> 02:03:24,161
Oh, Mr. Fogg, there's Passepartout.

899
02:03:30,629 --> 02:03:32,770
Passepartout, put down that chicken!
Listen to me.

900
02:03:32,899 --> 02:03:33,708
Yes, master.

901
02:03:33,799 --> 02:03:36,212
This is a primitive country.
We're gonna need some protection.

902
02:03:36,302 --> 02:03:37,044
I have this.

903
02:03:37,173 --> 02:03:39,338
No, nothing so medieval.
A brace of pistols.

904
02:03:39,430 --> 02:03:41,137
- Pistols?
- Nothing extravagant, mind you.

905
02:03:41,222 --> 02:03:43,215
- Oh, no, sir.
- You have 47 minutes.

906
02:03:43,308 --> 02:03:45,928
- The train leaves on the hour.
- I shall be there.

907
02:03:49,397 --> 02:03:51,783
I've told you before,
do not spoil the natives.

908
02:03:51,808 --> 02:03:53,139
Yes, sir.

909
02:04:00,739 --> 02:04:02,530
You still in a hurry?

910
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:08,236
I thought the English were calm,
dreamy sort of people.

911
02:04:08,622 --> 02:04:11,726
Listen, you. Get out and stay out.

912
02:04:11,832 --> 02:04:14,786
If I ever catch you in here again,
I'll cut you up in a thousand pieces.

913
02:04:14,877 --> 02:04:18,376
That won't be necessary, I assure you.
I'm just leaving.

914
02:04:31,182 --> 02:04:33,953
Ah, an unexpected pleasure
to meet you here, Mr. Fogg.

915
02:04:34,039 --> 02:04:36,536
Eh-eh, uh, did you
have an enjoyable crossing?

916
02:04:36,665 --> 02:04:38,100
We didn't see much of you
aboard ship, Mr. Fix.

917
02:04:38,189 --> 02:04:41,473
<i>Yes, I was a victim of mal de mer,
I'm sorry to say.</i>

918
02:04:41,566 --> 02:04:45,349
Eh, you won't be lingering in this sort
of a hubbub much longer I guess so.

919
02:04:45,528 --> 02:04:49,739
- Are you taking the transcontinental train?
- Yes, Mr. Fix, the train next one. Are you?

920
02:04:49,823 --> 02:04:50,739
Yes.

921
02:04:50,868 --> 02:04:53,136
But how's your cousin,
the one who was ill?

922
02:04:53,305 --> 02:04:54,861
Oh, yes, poor old lady.

923
02:04:54,953 --> 02:04:58,079
She didn't trust the doctors here.
She's gone on to New York.

924
02:04:58,164 --> 02:05:00,742
I thought your cousin was a man.
I distinctly remember the name Marmaduke.

925
02:05:00,832 --> 02:05:04,415
Angelica Marmaduke.
He-he, oh, well, a lovely old lady.

926
02:05:04,753 --> 02:05:06,641
For a great smoke, try these, gentlemen.

927
02:05:06,734 --> 02:05:10,045
For a good government,
vote for Lucius P. Mandiboy.

928
02:05:10,987 --> 02:05:14,109
- Thank you, no. I only smoke my own blend.
- Oh, you do, do you?

929
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:17,262
You don't want to befoul your lips
with a plebeian cigar?

930
02:05:17,347 --> 02:05:20,174
No, it's just I'd prefer what my own
tobacconist compounds for me.

931
02:05:20,266 --> 02:05:23,704
Well, sweet spirits of niter,
aren't you the tender bud.

932
02:05:23,791 --> 02:05:27,386
Tell me, Percy, who are you voting for?
Camerfield or Mandiboy?

933
02:05:27,481 --> 02:05:29,480
Neither.
I happen to be a foreign visitor,

934
02:05:29,565 --> 02:05:31,605
therefore unconcerned
about who triumphs for it.

935
02:05:31,693 --> 02:05:35,503
How do you ring-tailed sidewinder,
if you don't raise my gorge, sir.

936
02:05:35,676 --> 02:05:38,905
Yessiree, Bob!
I'll be a dad-blamed polecat

937
02:05:39,032 --> 02:05:43,494
if you aren't about as ornery specimen
as ever I cut my eyes on.

938
02:05:43,891 --> 02:05:47,322
What kind of foreigner are you?
Maybe a hoochie-coochie dancer?

939
02:05:47,416 --> 02:05:49,953
- Unhand that lady, sir.
- Why don't you make me?

940
02:05:50,042 --> 02:05:54,018
- I will without further invitation.
- Why, you dirty...

941
02:05:54,162 --> 02:05:56,228
- Oh!
- Oh!

942
02:06:00,467 --> 02:06:02,218
Let us proceed.

943
02:07:48,352 --> 02:07:51,562
- Now what is the delay?
- Indians. But they're peaceful Indians.

944
02:07:51,648 --> 02:07:54,013
You can tell that
by the peace pipes they're smoking.

945
02:07:54,108 --> 02:07:57,144
Further down the line,
they're not so friendly.

946
02:08:13,415 --> 02:08:14,715
Ah!

947
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:36,561
Is the entire American population
in the way of this train?

948
02:10:57,726 --> 02:11:00,036
Oh, these American trains,
quite impossible.

949
02:11:00,124 --> 02:11:02,309
Yes, sir. I go, master.

950
02:11:15,658 --> 02:11:19,069
She'll never take the weight of this train.
We better go back.

951
02:11:20,078 --> 02:11:21,843
What's all of fuss here, boys?

952
02:11:21,934 --> 02:11:25,164
Can't you fellows run a railroad
without'n you stop every five minutes?

953
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:28,105
Oh, that bridge won't
hardly hold a locomotive, Colonel Proctor.

954
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:31,771
Why, hang me for a sheep-stealing
son of tarantula

955
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:35,213
if you ain't a pack
of yellow-bellied milksops.

956
02:11:35,258 --> 02:11:38,942
- Am I right, scout?
- Oh, yes. Yes, sir, you're right.

957
02:11:39,054 --> 02:11:43,264
- No, I ain't chancing it, fellows.
- Here, take a snort of this 40-rod.

958
02:11:43,453 --> 02:11:46,677
Back up your old teakettle there,
and shoot her over at 30 miles an hour.

959
02:11:46,702 --> 02:11:47,953
Well...

960
02:11:54,609 --> 02:11:55,605
Let her roll!

961
02:11:55,692 --> 02:11:59,144
That's the spirit, partner.
Bear down on that throttle.

962
02:13:09,902 --> 02:13:12,468
Now that's what I call
a proper rate of speed.

963
02:13:43,098 --> 02:13:45,200
I'll be rattlesnake's uncle.

964
02:13:45,288 --> 02:13:48,392
Thought you'd run away,
yellow-bellied lime juicer.

965
02:13:48,519 --> 02:13:52,329
- Hit a man with an iron bar, will you?
- Spades are trumps, I believe.

966
02:13:52,419 --> 02:13:56,334
"Spades are trumps, I believe".
Oh, my dear Algernon, really.

967
02:13:56,463 --> 02:13:59,169
- Be so good as to play.
- "Be so good as to play".

968
02:13:59,258 --> 02:14:04,135
Gracious. Why don't you play a man's game?
Poker, red dog, euchre.

969
02:14:04,346 --> 02:14:09,239
Want me to learn you how, Algy boy?
or should I learn you how to fight fair?

970
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:11,141
Would you pardon me?

971
02:14:12,603 --> 02:14:16,386
Sir, you are an insolent bully,
and I demand satisfaction at once.

972
02:14:17,649 --> 02:14:22,277
Mind moving into the other car, please?
It'll only be a minute or so.

973
02:14:25,490 --> 02:14:28,443
Now, don't miss, boys,
and damage the woodwork.

974
02:14:28,534 --> 02:14:31,238
The company's liable
take it out of my salary.

975
02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:33,905
Ready, or you want to holler uncle?

976
02:14:33,930 --> 02:14:38,034
I'm ready. We will count
to six together, turn, and fire at will.

977
02:14:38,125 --> 02:14:39,822
- Now?
- Now.

978
02:14:40,377 --> 02:14:46,381
One, two, three, four, five, six.

979
02:14:53,097 --> 02:14:54,472
Take this.

980
02:14:58,393 --> 02:15:00,090
Redskins!

981
02:15:07,296 --> 02:15:10,693
Thanks, partner. You may be
a foreigner, but you're true-blue.

982
02:16:17,085 --> 02:16:18,745
Are you all right?

983
02:16:19,171 --> 02:16:22,504
I'm all right,
but look what they've done to my coat.

984
02:16:23,363 --> 02:16:26,084
Hey, the train is running away!

985
02:16:27,094 --> 02:16:28,635
They must have got
the engineer and the fireman.

986
02:16:28,721 --> 02:16:29,752
What do you suggest?

987
02:16:29,847 --> 02:16:32,488
Fort Kearney's just ahead.
That's where the cavalry is.

988
02:16:32,578 --> 02:16:37,049
- But we'll pass right through at this rate.
- Somebody's got to stop the train.

989
02:17:35,503 --> 02:17:37,569
Aah!

990
02:18:39,752 --> 02:18:41,998
One of us must get to Fort Kearney.

991
02:18:56,703 --> 02:18:58,136
I'll try.

992
02:21:44,223 --> 02:21:49,409
- Oh, poor Passepartout. Not a trace of him.
- Everyone else seems to be accounted for.

993
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:51,852
Well, there's no sign of your valet, sir.

994
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:54,180
I'm afraid he's fallen
into the hands of the Sioux.

995
02:21:54,273 --> 02:21:57,629
It's was a deliberate sacrifice
to save the rest of us.

996
02:21:57,819 --> 02:22:00,758
- What will they do to him?
- Well, the Sioux are pretty merciless.

997
02:22:00,843 --> 02:22:03,000
You've heard about their tortures.

998
02:22:03,094 --> 02:22:05,862
Colonel, we must send
a rescue party at once.

999
02:22:05,972 --> 02:22:07,430
Excuse me, mister.

1000
02:22:07,571 --> 02:22:08,737
I, uh...

1001
02:22:08,994 --> 02:22:13,764
I know it sounds kind of heartless but
we can't hold the train.

1002
02:22:13,854 --> 02:22:17,352
That's a minor consideration.
A man's life is at stake.

1003
02:22:19,025 --> 02:22:21,777
Any of you men want to volunteer
for a raid against the Sioux?

1004
02:22:21,862 --> 02:22:24,068
- I will, sir!
- I will!

1005
02:23:27,626 --> 02:23:29,328
It's too warm.

1006
02:23:44,679 --> 02:23:46,348
Master!

1007
02:23:47,831 --> 02:23:49,292
Master.

1008
02:23:57,693 --> 02:24:01,901
Don't be blue, folks.
Everything is gonna be all right.

1009
02:24:02,134 --> 02:24:06,110
There'll be a local through here tomorrow.
That'll fit you into Omaha the day after.

1010
02:24:06,201 --> 02:24:07,952
Yes, and lose 24 hours.

1011
02:24:08,036 --> 02:24:11,700
If we miss our steamship in New York,
how are we gonna get to Liverpool on time?

1012
02:24:11,789 --> 02:24:17,373
I'm darned if I understand you city folks.
Always rushing, rushing, rushing.

1013
02:24:17,545 --> 02:24:23,037
Always thinking about the future.
No wonder you have stomach trouble.

1014
02:24:24,174 --> 02:24:25,966
It's all my fault, sir.

1015
02:24:26,051 --> 02:24:29,254
You should have caught that train
and let those Indians cook me.

1016
02:24:29,346 --> 02:24:32,738
- Then everybody would have been happy.
- No, Balderdash.

1017
02:24:32,828 --> 02:24:37,887
What I always say is,
it's an ill wind that blows no good.

1018
02:25:45,454 --> 02:25:47,328
Ease off the halyards.

1019
02:25:48,916 --> 02:25:50,453
Stabiling, man.

1020
02:25:56,923 --> 02:26:00,338
Look, the train. The train broke down.
Master, stop the wind, master.

1021
02:26:00,425 --> 02:26:03,836
- Contain yourself, Passepartout.
- To, to, to, to the left, master.

1022
02:26:07,264 --> 02:26:09,257
Everything's under control.

1023
02:26:13,019 --> 02:26:15,099
Those homemade American trains.

1024
02:26:18,774 --> 02:26:20,019
Goodbye.

1025
02:26:41,896 --> 02:26:43,452
Oh, well-played, Dennis.

1026
02:26:43,544 --> 02:26:46,164
I must say you have
a natural aptitude for the game.

1027
02:26:46,255 --> 02:26:48,979
Perfected by four years
of practice at Oxford, my dear fellow.

1028
02:26:49,111 --> 02:26:52,610
I did nothing else. Cost my poor old
governor well over £12,000.

1029
02:26:52,718 --> 02:26:54,711
Worth every penny of it.

1030
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:58,681
Hello, Sir Wilmette.
Haven't seen you in donkey's years.

1031
02:26:58,765 --> 02:27:00,673
- Are you staying here at the club?
- No.

1032
02:27:00,803 --> 02:27:01,496
Oh, you're not.

1033
02:27:01,601 --> 02:27:04,371
- Oh, but you have a house in town, no doubt?
- No.

1034
02:27:04,479 --> 02:27:06,930
- No, then you live in the country, do you?
- No.

1035
02:27:07,207 --> 02:27:11,146
- Uh-huh. Anywhere near London?
- No.

1036
02:27:12,881 --> 02:27:14,523
Hard luck.

1037
02:27:15,279 --> 02:27:16,560
Good day.

1038
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:28,809
Here we are, gentlemen.
From the British Consulate, New York.

1039
02:27:28,876 --> 02:27:30,750
Well, things are looking up.

1040
02:27:30,938 --> 02:27:33,159
"Phileas Fogg and party
presented their passports"

1041
02:27:33,253 --> 02:27:35,922
"at 2:30 Greenwich time this afternoon."

1042
02:27:36,006 --> 02:27:37,121
What time did that steamship sail?

1043
02:27:37,251 --> 02:27:39,832
Here, wait a minute,
I have a schedule right here.

1044
02:27:40,010 --> 02:27:43,175
Here we are. "City of Paris,"
No, that's yesterday's.

1045
02:27:43,262 --> 02:27:46,818
<i>Wait a minute. Now,
"Cunard, the China. New York, Liverpool."</i>

1046
02:27:46,974 --> 02:27:48,118
Sail today, 9:00 a.m.

1047
02:27:48,143 --> 02:27:50,099
Ha-ha, come on.
He's missed it by five hours.

1048
02:27:50,185 --> 02:27:52,718
And not another eastbound vessel
for three days.

1049
02:27:52,812 --> 02:27:56,560
I don't wish to crow, gentlemen, but I
seems to feel the crisp crackle of £20,000.

1050
02:27:56,649 --> 02:27:59,400
I think we better crack
that bottle of champagne we've been saving.

1051
02:27:59,485 --> 02:28:03,336
Right you are. But first,
what about a bet or two on the side

1052
02:28:03,425 --> 02:28:05,834
before this information leaks out?

1053
02:28:05,948 --> 02:28:08,117
- Aye, we better get over to Mr. Lloyd's.
- Yes.

1054
02:28:08,341 --> 02:28:09,117
Come on.

1055
02:28:09,872 --> 02:28:11,227
You wish so.

1056
02:28:19,878 --> 02:28:21,075
Listen!

1057
02:28:22,338 --> 02:28:24,911
They opened the telegram while I was there.

1058
02:28:25,007 --> 02:28:28,375
Fogg missed the China.
He can't possibly make it now.

1059
02:28:28,468 --> 02:28:29,927
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1060
02:28:30,011 --> 02:28:32,087
In that case I'll chance
another couple of quid.

1061
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:34,752
Here, you take care of things
while I slip round the course.

1062
02:28:34,849 --> 02:28:39,509
Wait a minute.
Put down an extra fiver after me.

1063
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:49,727
No, gentlemen, not a bit of activity all day.
There are just no odds on Mr. Fogg.

1064
02:28:49,819 --> 02:28:52,736
Well, how can that be?
We could barely get in here last Thursday.

1065
02:28:52,822 --> 02:28:54,981
Oh, yes, sir,
very mysterious these things.

1066
02:28:55,075 --> 02:28:58,359
- You never know from minute to minute.
- Gentlemen.

1067
02:28:59,287 --> 02:29:03,201
I have just received some rather
disquieting information about Mr. Fogg.

1068
02:29:09,837 --> 02:29:13,288
I think you already know Mr. Carmichael,
the General Manager of Lloyd's.

1069
02:29:13,382 --> 02:29:16,352
And this, as you may have guessed,
is Inspector Hunter of Scotland Yard.

1070
02:29:16,377 --> 02:29:17,916
- How do you do?
- Yeah.

1071
02:29:17,928 --> 02:29:20,465
I'm feel this will be very
painful to hear, gentlemen.

1072
02:29:20,555 --> 02:29:24,407
We've just received confirmation of
something we've suspected for some time.

1073
02:29:24,496 --> 02:29:28,176
The man who robbed the Bank of England,
and your fellow clubman Phileas Fogg

1074
02:29:28,271 --> 02:29:29,550
are one and the same.

1075
02:29:29,646 --> 02:29:32,250
- Of all the ridiculous nonsense!
- You don't really believe that.

1076
02:29:32,379 --> 02:29:33,064
Balderdash.

1077
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:35,141
Have you any grounds
for making such a charge?

1078
02:29:35,235 --> 02:29:37,559
We have, sir. Some very striking facts.

1079
02:29:37,653 --> 02:29:40,060
Coupled with behavior
which strongly points to his guilty.

1080
02:29:40,155 --> 02:29:41,981
- I don't believe it.
- Neither do I.

1081
02:29:42,073 --> 02:29:43,948
You've heard, I supposed,
that Mr. Fogg and his party

1082
02:29:43,973 --> 02:29:46,243
<i>did not sail on the Cunard steamship China.</i>

1083
02:29:46,327 --> 02:29:50,008
- Yes, yes, well, what of it?
- Read them that message, Mr. Carmichael.

1084
02:29:50,038 --> 02:29:52,743
"At 6:00 a.m. today,
our New York office reports"

1085
02:29:52,833 --> 02:29:55,225
<i>"that trading ship Henrietta
departed New York"</i>

1086
02:29:55,315 --> 02:29:58,163
"with a cargo of cotton,
linseed oil, and lumber."

1087
02:29:58,254 --> 02:30:01,421
"Her three passengers were
Mr. Phileas Fogg and party."

1088
02:30:01,507 --> 02:30:05,457
<i>And the Henrietta's destination,
gentlemen, is Caracas, Venezuela.</i>

1089
02:30:05,553 --> 02:30:08,549
And we have no extradition treaty
with Venezuela.

1090
02:30:08,598 --> 02:30:13,783
- In other words, Mr. Fogg has bolted.
- A member of the Reform Club.

1091
02:30:13,808 --> 02:30:15,443
- My mind rejects the whole idea.
- Of course.

1092
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:17,996
Surely there must be some explanation
for all this.

1093
02:30:18,084 --> 02:30:20,040
Perhaps so, gentlemen, but the only man
who can make it

1094
02:30:20,127 --> 02:30:24,431
is on the high seas at this moment,
bound for Central America.

1095
02:30:52,592 --> 02:30:56,258
Begging your pardon, sir,
we're way off course for Venezuela.

1096
02:30:56,347 --> 02:30:59,652
- Have you assumed command of this ship?
- Why, no, no, sir.

1097
02:30:59,745 --> 02:31:01,300
Captain,
don't overlook the rest of our bargain.

1098
02:31:01,429 --> 02:31:03,178
- What's that?
- The rest of our bargain.

1099
02:31:03,227 --> 02:31:06,560
Oh, by all means. Go below,
tell the engineer I want full steam.

1100
02:31:06,647 --> 02:31:10,106
- Full steam?
- Full steam. As much as she'll take.

1101
02:31:33,565 --> 02:31:36,546
You're burning her up too fast.
You'll never make it.

1102
02:31:36,631 --> 02:31:39,584
Just steer the ship, Captain.
Don't speculate.

1103
02:32:00,025 --> 02:32:03,279
What's happening?
Why are we slowing down?

1104
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:25,583
Well, that's it. They just put the
last teaspoon of coal in the old scow.

1105
02:32:25,757 --> 02:32:27,356
It's all finished, Mr. Fogg.

1106
02:32:27,447 --> 02:32:31,041
You still got a little breeze left,
but I don't think it'll get you there in time.

1107
02:32:36,141 --> 02:32:38,472
Only three more days to go.

1108
02:32:39,935 --> 02:32:43,636
I still can't believe that
Fogg robbed the Bank of England.

1109
02:32:44,210 --> 02:32:46,314
No British gentleman, having done so,

1110
02:32:46,401 --> 02:32:49,649
would have the effrontery
to set foot in this club.

1111
02:33:08,105 --> 02:33:09,932
Captain Speedy, I will be direct with you.

1112
02:33:10,024 --> 02:33:12,590
How much will you accept
for this vessel, cash in hand?

1113
02:33:12,673 --> 02:33:14,795
- Why, this is exceptional...
- £5,000?

1114
02:33:14,883 --> 02:33:17,253
£5,000?
What, this deck is made of Burmese teak.

1115
02:33:17,344 --> 02:33:20,714
Let us dispense with the poetry, Captain.
Passepartout, get the bag.

1116
02:33:20,805 --> 02:33:22,050
Yes, sir.

1117
02:33:25,643 --> 02:33:27,386
Will that be sufficient?

1118
02:33:27,477 --> 02:33:30,435
- Oh, she's yours!
- Done.

1119
02:33:30,772 --> 02:33:34,562
Now, as the new owner,
I wish to issue my first command.

1120
02:33:34,984 --> 02:33:37,521
Pile everything that will burn
into the stoke hole.

1121
02:33:37,612 --> 02:33:40,231
The cargo first,
of course, that linseed oil.

1122
02:33:40,321 --> 02:33:43,357
Then the upper decks,
masts, tables, chairs, windows,

1123
02:33:43,449 --> 02:33:46,450
ladders, everything,
including the lifeboats.

1124
02:33:46,536 --> 02:33:49,381
- Is that clear?
- The lifeboats?

1125
02:33:49,454 --> 02:33:52,956
Lifeboats. You heard what the man said.
Is that clear?

1126
02:34:15,082 --> 02:34:19,242
Come on, men. Keep moving. Come on.

1127
02:35:15,613 --> 02:35:18,272
Oh, no, not her.

1128
02:35:18,740 --> 02:35:20,984
<i>Not Henrietta!</i>

1129
02:35:21,534 --> 02:35:25,111
Not her. No! No! No!

1130
02:35:56,649 --> 02:36:00,232
- The gauges are falling fast.
- There's nothing more to burn.

1131
02:36:23,296 --> 02:36:24,600
How are we faring, engineer?

1132
02:36:24,695 --> 02:36:26,830
The pressure won't last
more than an hour.

1133
02:36:26,924 --> 02:36:28,833
- One hour?
- That's right.

1134
02:36:41,332 --> 02:36:42,225
Engine room.

1135
02:36:42,312 --> 02:36:45,227
<i>- Land ho!
- Land ho!</i>

1136
02:36:45,460 --> 02:36:47,128
Yay!

1137
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:50,803
Yay!

1138
02:36:50,907 --> 02:36:52,366
Hooray!

1139
02:36:52,823 --> 02:36:57,070
Ooh, done, Mr. Fogg. I never exactly
made a voyage like this before,

1140
02:36:57,159 --> 02:37:00,570
- but I can't deny, we got here.
- Thanks to you and your men, Captain.

1141
02:37:00,662 --> 02:37:02,861
After I put you ashore,
where do you want me to dock?

1142
02:37:02,956 --> 02:37:05,577
Anywhere you wish. I have no further
use for her, she's yours.

1143
02:37:05,666 --> 02:37:09,787
Well, thanks for the ship, what's left of it.
But, you know, could rebuild this ship...

1144
02:37:09,879 --> 02:37:12,329
You rebuild her, Captain.
I have more pressing matters.

1145
02:37:12,423 --> 02:37:14,582
Thank you very much.

1146
02:37:41,739 --> 02:37:44,313
Well, my friends,
the end of our journey is near.

1147
02:37:44,409 --> 02:37:47,693
Eight hours and 42 minutes
of the allotted time remain.

1148
02:37:47,786 --> 02:37:50,910
Our train will arrives at
Paddington Station in London at 6:02 p.m.,

1149
02:37:50,935 --> 02:37:55,157
ensuring ample time to proceed
to the Reform Club and settle the wager.

1150
02:37:55,252 --> 02:37:59,013
- Phileas Fogg! Stop that man!
- Don't delay, master. Come on.

1151
02:37:59,144 --> 02:38:01,645
Come on, master. Come on.

1152
02:38:02,716 --> 02:38:05,421
- What the devil is this?
- Are you Phileas Fogg?

1153
02:38:05,511 --> 02:38:07,253
Of course I am.
Have you taken leave of your senses?

1154
02:38:07,345 --> 02:38:10,630
- Then I arrest you in the Queen's name.
- Arrest? On what charge?

1155
02:38:10,723 --> 02:38:15,007
Of purloining £55,000 from
the Bank of England on the 3rd of July.

1156
02:38:15,102 --> 02:38:16,560
- It's not true.
- Silence.

1157
02:38:16,645 --> 02:38:19,099
You thought you were clever,
Mr. Phileas Fogg.

1158
02:38:19,188 --> 02:38:21,893
Thought you could outwit me, didn't you?

1159
02:38:22,016 --> 02:38:23,316
Hold him.

1160
02:38:23,755 --> 02:38:24,977
It's not true.

1161
02:38:25,106 --> 02:38:27,816
- Take him too.
- It's not true, sir.

1162
02:39:11,755 --> 02:39:14,437
I can't understand it.
A most shocking mistake.

1163
02:39:14,528 --> 02:39:16,604
It's never happened in my career.

1164
02:39:16,697 --> 02:39:19,866
It would seem, Mr. Fogg,
that I owe you an apology.

1165
02:39:20,889 --> 02:39:22,824
The most terrible thing has happened.

1166
02:39:22,911 --> 02:39:25,828
The real culprit
was apprehended in Brighton.

1167
02:39:25,912 --> 02:39:27,241
Then I am no longer suspect?

1168
02:39:27,330 --> 02:39:30,450
No, not in the least, sir,
oh, but I would like to tell you

1169
02:39:30,542 --> 02:39:33,370
that I've never had
any personal animosity for you.

1170
02:39:33,462 --> 02:39:38,374
Heh, on the contrary, you've always been
a perfect gentleman and most generous.

1171
02:39:38,382 --> 02:39:41,652
Heh, it's almost a pity
that you're not the real robber.

1172
02:39:41,740 --> 02:39:45,823
- Heh, you're so daring.
- Mr. Fix...

1173
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:49,973
Now that you have successfully thwarted me
and placed in my path the only obstacle

1174
02:39:50,060 --> 02:39:51,766
for which I was unable to make provision.

1175
02:39:51,853 --> 02:39:56,180
I feel I can tell you I have never
really enjoyed your company very much.

1176
02:39:56,272 --> 02:40:01,185
And furthermore, you play an abominable
game of whist. Good day, sir.

1177
02:40:12,475 --> 02:40:15,237
The wager is lost. Come.

1178
02:40:35,264 --> 02:40:37,425
What a gloomy place.

1179
02:40:39,769 --> 02:40:42,511
It's so melancholy, so joyless.

1180
02:40:44,856 --> 02:40:48,521
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Fogg.
I didn't mean to criticize your taste.

1181
02:40:48,610 --> 02:40:51,483
No, you're right. It is depressing.

1182
02:40:52,155 --> 02:40:53,898
- Passepartout.
- Yes, sir?

1183
02:40:53,989 --> 02:40:55,696
Look at the clocks.

1184
02:40:55,782 --> 02:40:58,783
Get in touch with Mr. McMonnies
and have them put in order.

1185
02:40:58,868 --> 02:40:59,906
Right away, this morning.

1186
02:41:00,035 --> 02:41:02,930
No, not this morning, it's Sunday today.
Tomorrow.

1187
02:41:03,039 --> 02:41:05,612
And make up the spare bedroom
for the Princess.

1188
02:41:05,708 --> 02:41:09,877
- Light a fire, and see to her comforts.
- Certainly, sir.

1189
02:41:09,962 --> 02:41:13,957
And now, madame, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to spend the rest of the day alone.

1190
02:41:14,675 --> 02:41:16,875
- Oh, Passepartout.
- Yes, sir?

1191
02:41:17,217 --> 02:41:19,424
Turn off the gas in your room.

1192
02:41:36,234 --> 02:41:39,069
You needn't bother, Passepartout.
I'll take this up to him.

1193
02:41:39,154 --> 02:41:44,861
- He won't eat, madame. He is feeling very low.
- Poor man.

1194
02:41:44,950 --> 02:41:52,163
You know, his whole fortune,
all that he risked, everything is lost.

1195
02:42:00,715 --> 02:42:04,499
- What will become of you, Passepartout?
- I can take care of myself.

1196
02:42:04,593 --> 02:42:12,098
After all, I have a dozen professions,
fireman, acrobat, traveling companion.

1197
02:42:32,492 --> 02:42:34,282
You must eat something, Mr. Fogg.

1198
02:42:34,368 --> 02:42:37,111
- No, thank you.
- Please.

1199
02:42:37,789 --> 02:42:40,113
You're angry with me, and justly.

1200
02:42:40,207 --> 02:42:42,449
Good heaven, Princess.
Why should I be angry with you?

1201
02:42:42,542 --> 02:42:44,949
You might have won your wager but for me.

1202
02:42:45,044 --> 02:42:50,192
You saved my life at the risk of your own,
generously, impulsively.

1203
02:42:50,299 --> 02:42:53,749
And I repaid you by delaying you,
involving you needlessly.

1204
02:42:53,843 --> 02:42:55,948
On the contrary,
it is I who owe you an apology

1205
02:42:55,973 --> 02:42:58,241
to having brought you here to England,
penniless.

1206
02:42:58,326 --> 02:43:00,510
But you must not concern yourself with me,
Mr. Fogg.

1207
02:43:00,535 --> 02:43:01,641
- Your own part...
- My dear.

1208
02:43:01,746 --> 02:43:06,347
Anything that has overtaken me
is a direct result of my own folly.

1209
02:43:06,646 --> 02:43:10,562
I refuse to deceive myself,
and I don't like self-pity.

1210
02:43:11,150 --> 02:43:13,724
Possibly things aren't
as desperate as they seem.

1211
02:43:13,820 --> 02:43:17,733
Well, to be candid, at the moment,
they're not particularly promising.

1212
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:22,108
- Surely your friends could aid you.
- I have no friends.

1213
02:43:22,785 --> 02:43:25,739
- No relatives?
- Not a soul.

1214
02:43:30,875 --> 02:43:35,701
Then I truly feel for you.
I know how tragic solitude can be

1215
02:43:35,796 --> 02:43:38,631
<i>when one has nobody
with whom to share his grief.</i>

1216
02:43:38,716 --> 02:43:42,167
<i>In my country, Mr. Fogg,
it is said that misfortune</i>

1217
02:43:42,261 --> 02:43:48,004
<i>if shared with another sympathetic spirit,
can be borne with resignation.</i>

1218
02:43:48,656 --> 02:43:54,310
Mr. Fogg... Do you wish at once
a kinswoman and a friend?

1219
02:43:55,855 --> 02:43:59,435
I'm not sure that
I interpret you correctly.

1220
02:44:01,235 --> 02:44:03,560
Will you have me for your wife?

1221
02:44:07,282 --> 02:44:09,198
<i>Aouda, my darling.</i>

1222
02:44:10,370 --> 02:44:11,622
<i>Passepartout.</i>

1223
02:44:12,912 --> 02:44:14,785
Yes, sir? Yes, master?

1224
02:44:14,872 --> 02:44:16,807
<i>I want you to go
to Reverend Samuel Wilson,</i>

1225
02:44:16,895 --> 02:44:18,908
<i>of Marylebone Parish at once.</i>

1226
02:44:19,376 --> 02:44:22,184
<i>- Right away, sir.
- Arrange for a wedding.</i>

1227
02:44:22,336 --> 02:44:25,754
<i>- One wedding, sir. When?
- Tomorrow.</i>

1228
02:44:25,882 --> 02:44:27,542
<i>Will that be all right, my dear?</i>

1229
02:44:27,633 --> 02:44:30,317
<i>- Yes, tomorrow.
- Olé, sir!</i>

1230
02:44:30,448 --> 02:44:31,490
<i>Passepartout.</i>

1231
02:44:32,454 --> 02:44:33,496
Yes, sir.

1232
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:37,013
<i>Curtail the jubilation, if you please,
and bring the Reverend Wilson with you.</i>

1233
02:44:37,099 --> 02:44:38,797
Yes, sir.

1234
02:44:54,177 --> 02:44:57,007
- Yes?
- A wedding. Come with me.

1235
02:44:57,158 --> 02:45:00,029
- No, I don't think so.
- Yes, quickly. It's an emergency.

1236
02:45:00,119 --> 02:45:02,076
- I'll get my hat.
- Quickly.

1237
02:45:17,002 --> 02:45:19,991
Ahh! Saturday.

1238
02:45:28,310 --> 02:45:29,805
It's Saturday.

1239
02:45:37,110 --> 02:45:43,902
- And so many clocks. Couldn't there be just one?
- Anything you suggest, my dear.

1240
02:45:44,387 --> 02:45:48,324
- Master! Master.
- How dare you bolt into a room in this fashion, sir?

1241
02:45:48,412 --> 02:45:50,698
Where is your training?
And remove your hat!

1242
02:45:51,206 --> 02:45:54,262
It's not Sunday, it's Saturday.
We have 10 minutes to left, master.

1243
02:45:54,287 --> 02:45:56,555
What in the everlasting blazes
are you jabbering about?

1244
02:45:56,647 --> 02:45:59,576
It's Saturday!
Look for yourself. It's Saturday.

1245
02:45:59,671 --> 02:46:02,458
Fiddlesticks.
The printers must have made an error.

1246
02:46:02,549 --> 02:46:04,128
You have made the error.

1247
02:46:04,258 --> 02:46:06,214
We will review
your impudence at a later date, sir.

1248
02:46:06,301 --> 02:46:07,879
In the meantime,
allow me to disillusion you.

1249
02:46:07,970 --> 02:46:11,754
I have kept detailed record
of every single phase of our entire trip.

1250
02:46:11,849 --> 02:46:15,217
We went around the world in 80 days,
this is the 81st...

1251
02:46:15,309 --> 02:46:16,804
It's Saturday.

1252
02:46:19,980 --> 02:46:24,395
We went eastward around the world,
always moving towards the sun.

1253
02:46:24,526 --> 02:46:27,313
Great heavens! We've crossed
the International Date Line.

1254
02:46:27,404 --> 02:46:29,299
We've gained an entire day. This is it.

1255
02:46:29,428 --> 02:46:31,384
- This is the 80th day.
- It's Saturday.

1256
02:46:31,470 --> 02:46:34,757
8:34 and ten seconds. We have 10 minutes
and 50 seconds left to get to the club.

1257
02:46:34,847 --> 02:46:37,115
You wait here, my dear.
Come, man, let's go!

1258
02:46:43,916 --> 02:46:47,475
Cabbie. Cabbie, Reform Club.

1259
02:46:47,546 --> 02:46:49,915
- Who?
- Reform Club.

1260
02:46:51,132 --> 02:46:53,443
Mind you, governor,
it's none of my business,

1261
02:46:53,530 --> 02:46:57,090
but do you two gents think you'll gonna
get into the Reform Club dressed like that?

1262
02:46:57,179 --> 02:46:59,674
- Drive on, man!
- Very good, sir.

1263
02:47:14,276 --> 02:47:15,542
Whoa!

1264
02:47:15,904 --> 02:47:19,606
- What's the matter? What happened?
- I'm sorry, sir. It's the hiccups, sir.

1265
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:23,650
I have them pretty bad, sir.
I can't do a thing with them, sir.

1266
02:47:23,911 --> 02:47:25,972
- Oh, blimey.
- Oh, confound the man.

1267
02:47:26,059 --> 02:47:27,949
It's all right, sir. I drive.

1268
02:47:30,959 --> 02:47:34,908
- What's the matter with the beast?
- It's no good, sir. He can't do it.

1269
02:47:35,003 --> 02:47:39,628
He'd love to, but he can't, sir.
He don't like orders from nobody but me, sir.

1270
02:47:41,197 --> 02:47:45,756
- Come on, please.
- It's no good, sir. He can't do it, sir.

1271
02:47:46,097 --> 02:47:47,840
No, he won't do it, sir.

1272
02:47:50,142 --> 02:47:54,763
The devil never sleeps, brethren.
Even now as we stand here,

1273
02:47:54,854 --> 02:48:02,876
he is hurrying some poor soul to his doom
tempting him down the path of iniquity.

1274
02:48:02,987 --> 02:48:05,738
And now, we shall take up the collection.

1275
02:48:11,953 --> 02:48:13,280
Excuse me.

1276
02:48:14,997 --> 02:48:18,621
Sir, would you like
to contribute something to our cause?

1277
02:48:18,709 --> 02:48:21,911
Madame, I don't think I have anything.
Wait. There's something.

1278
02:48:22,003 --> 02:48:22,729
A fiver?

1279
02:48:22,860 --> 02:48:24,920
Oh, please, madame. I'm in a terrible hurry.
It's a wager.

1280
02:48:25,006 --> 02:48:28,125
A wager? Did you hear that, brethren?

1281
02:48:28,426 --> 02:48:32,292
Our poor, benighted sinner is the very sort
I've been telling you about.

1282
02:48:32,387 --> 02:48:35,657
Don't do it, sir. Don't do it.
Don't give in to the Prince of Darkness.

1283
02:48:35,743 --> 02:48:37,320
Madame, I haven't the faintest intention
of giving interfere.

1284
02:48:37,449 --> 02:48:43,509
Have courage, my boy, to say no.
Turn to Hymn 579, everyone,

1285
02:48:43,604 --> 02:48:48,606
and lift up your voices
to save our poorly beset brother.

1286
02:48:49,092 --> 02:48:56,230
<i>Have courage, my boy, to say no</i>

1287
02:48:56,365 --> 02:49:00,501
<i>Have courage, my boy</i>

1288
02:49:00,536 --> 02:49:03,369
<i>Have courage, my boy, to say no</i>

1289
02:49:03,505 --> 02:49:04,603
That's good!

1290
02:49:04,638 --> 02:49:08,039
<i>Have courage, my boy, to say no</i>

1291
02:49:08,475 --> 02:49:13,343
<i>Have courage, my boy,
to say no, say no</i>

1292
02:49:14,006 --> 02:49:15,833
Good heaven, Ralphs. Why wait any longer?

1293
02:49:15,924 --> 02:49:18,629
- He's lost the wager.
- Of course he has, 20 times over,

1294
02:49:18,719 --> 02:49:20,758
once he missed transatlantic connection.

1295
02:49:20,846 --> 02:49:24,510
Steady on, chaps. Play the game.
Remember, we're all British gentlemen.

1296
02:49:24,599 --> 02:49:28,466
- There are still 14 seconds to go.
- My dear, Ralph, the man's not superhuman.

1297
02:49:28,561 --> 02:49:32,177
What do you expect him to do?
Pop down the chimney like Santa Claus?

1298
02:49:32,272 --> 02:49:37,017
I haven't the least idea. I only know that
Phileas Fogg is the most punctual man alive.

1299
02:49:37,902 --> 02:49:41,611
Well, gentlemen, here I am.

1300
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:47,276
I trust that I've not kept you waiting.

1301
02:49:47,370 --> 02:49:47,805
Hello, Fogg.

1302
02:49:47,935 --> 02:49:49,474
- Hello, Fogg.
- Hello, Fogg.

1303
02:49:49,603 --> 02:49:51,968
- Hello, Fogg.
- Great Caesar's ghost!

1304
02:49:52,039 --> 02:49:54,614
A woman in the club!

1305
02:49:58,900 --> 02:50:01,665
My dear, I must ask you
to leave these precincts at once!

1306
02:50:01,756 --> 02:50:05,339
- No woman has ever set foot in the club.
- Why not?

1307
02:50:06,176 --> 02:50:10,044
Because that could spell
the end of the British Empire.

1308
02:50:16,143 --> 02:50:18,138
This is the end.
