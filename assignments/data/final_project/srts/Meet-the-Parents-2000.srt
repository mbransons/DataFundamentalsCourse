1
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,433
# Show me a man

2
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,228
# Who's gentle and kind

3
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,272
# And I'll show you

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,733
# A loser

5
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,402
# Now show me a man

6
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,821
# Who takes what he wants

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:40,582
# Oh, how exciting

8
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,753
# So the poets sing

9
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,551
# When you're a fool in love

10
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:54,514
# And nothing goes the way you plan

11
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,475
# And no one cares

12
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,435
# And no one understands

13
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,437
# That you're a fool

14
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:03,064
# And you're in love

15
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:07,318
# Never another spring for you

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,907
# Never a robin to sing for you

17
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,327
# You're out there on your own

18
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:20,999
# When you're a fool in love

19
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:26,629
# When you're a fool in love

20
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:29,883
# Seems like the skies

21
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,593
# Are always grey

22
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:35,763
# You turn around,
there's someone in your way

23
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:38,016
# And it's you

24
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,434
# And you're in love

25
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,689
# Sometimes you think
that your luck has changed

26
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,860
# And a rainbow explodes
'cross the sky

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,825
# But when you're a fool in love

28
00:01:56,785 --> 00:02:03,584
# You'll be a fool
till the day you die #

29
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,356
I know we haven't been
together that long,

30
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,818
but these last 10 months have been
the happiest of my life.

31
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:34,198
You're not only the person I love,
you're also my best friend...

32
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:39,119
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

33
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:41,664
Will you marry me?

34
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:43,958
Yes.

35
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,585
Seriously, do you think
that sounds good?

36
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,797
- No!
- Really? Cos I think that...

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,465
No!

38
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,135
Oh! Oh! Sorry. Sorry.

39
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:57,556
Sometimes these catheters
can pinch a little bit.

40
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,766
Well, thanks. I appreciate it.

41
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,395
You got a real gentle touch
there, Doctor.

42
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,857
She won't be able to say no.

43
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,152
Actually, I'm a nurse.
Doctor'll be right in.

44
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,783
- Good luck, Greg.
- Thanks, Cameron.

45
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:26,167
OK, it's time for
our problem of the week.

46
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:29,880
I want you to pick out
your problem,

47
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:32,632
a problem that's been
bothering you all week.

48
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:35,552
With your eyes still closed...

49
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:39,514
I want you to picture
that problem in your mind.

50
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,267
Pretend it's right there
in front of you.

51
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,935
...not only my best friend,

52
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,605
but you're also
the person that I...

53
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,899
want to spend the rest
of my life with.

54
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:52,903
I love you. Will you... marry me?

55
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:56,323
Now I want you to scare
your problems away.

56
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:59,952
- I want you to say "boo"!
- Boo!

57
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:02,788
- BOO!
- BOO!

58
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:07,585
All right, you guys are great.
Very good.

59
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:09,712
I will see you guys after lunch.

60
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:12,465
Pam, isn't that your special friend?

61
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,593
Yeah, I think so.

62
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:19,472
- Why don't you talk to him?
- You think I should?

63
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:20,973
Yeah!

64
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:25,770
Come here!

65
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:31,692
- Hi, sweetie.
- How're you doing?

66
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:35,947
I was in the area, got off early,
thought you'd want to go eat.

67
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,824
That's very sweet.
What a nice surprise.

68
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:42,161
Oh, shoot!
I forgot to change my shoes.

69
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:46,165
That's OK. You know I can't resist
a man in nurse's shoes.

70
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:49,669
I got my sneakers here.
Let me change. It'll take a second.

71
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:51,254
Huh! OK.

72
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,923
Honey?

73
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:55,758
- Pam.
- Yeah?

74
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:58,511
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

75
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:01,974
Come on, sweetie. I got a half-hour
before I have to be back.

76
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:04,852
So you wanna go have lunch?

77
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,187
What are you doing?

78
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:11,191
Um, nothing. I just love you so much.

79
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:15,237
These last 10 months... have been
the happiest of my life.

80
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,949
Yeah, they've been amazing, but...
What's going on?

81
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:22,995
Nothing. I just... I just feel like,
you know, we're so close.

82
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:27,875
You're my best friend, and you're
also the woman that I love, and...

83
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,419
You OK, sweetie? You're acting weird.

84
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:32,171
I just got a crick in my neck.

85
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:35,174
I did CPR
on a 300-pound crack head today.

86
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:37,593
- Want me to massage your neck?
- No, no.

87
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:41,013
Honey, your kids are
trying to tell you something!

88
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,140
Oh, hold on.

89
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:45,350
Oh, it's my sister. Hello. Hi.

90
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:51,023
You're engaged? Congratulations!

91
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:55,611
You're getting married in two weeks?
That's... a little soon.

92
00:05:55,694 --> 00:06:00,574
Mom and Dad... really don't know
Bob very well. Dad was OK with this?

93
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:03,202
Wow. That was very thoughtful of him.

94
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:06,915
I can't believe he knew
to ask Dad's permission.

95
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,208
Yeah.

96
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:12,462
I'm just here with Greg.
He's taking me to lunch. He's OK.

97
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:16,674
I know you've got to go.
All right. I love you. Bye.

98
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:20,303
So, what's going on?
Debbie's marrying that guy?

99
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:21,888
Yeah. In two weeks.

100
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:24,307
Dr Bob of Denver. Isn't that great?

101
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,228
Yeah, that's... Didn't they
just meet a few months ago?

102
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:30,939
Yeah, but he asked her
and she said yes.

103
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,857
Well, he asked my dad first.

104
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:36,819
Yeah, I overheard that.
So he had to ask his permission?

105
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:38,655
No, he didn't have to.

106
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:42,325
Bob just understood
that Dad appreciates that.

107
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:45,495
- Mm-hm.
- Deb said that Dad loves him.

108
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:49,249
Bob bought him the perfect gift
that just won him over.

109
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:52,085
Really. Huh, a gift.

110
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,715
Is it OK to X-ray this?
Yeah. It won't mutate.

111
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:04,097
- Sir, that's not gonna fit.
- Wait a second.

112
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:07,560
It's too big. You got to check it.

113
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,439
Raise your arms, sir.

114
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:15,442
Look, I got an engagement ring
in the bag,

115
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:18,779
so I can't open it here,
can't I just carry it on?

116
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:23,492
If it don't fit through the frame,
you ain't carrying it on the plane.

117
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,078
531, New York, La Guardia. Check it.

118
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:27,997
Wait, wait, excuse me...

119
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,292
Don't worry,
it'll be waiting for you there.

120
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:40,843
'Welcome to La Guardia Airport.
Please follow the signs... '

121
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:52,938
Excuse me. Hi. You lost my bag
and there's a diamond ring inside it.

122
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,191
I didn't lose your anything, sir.

123
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:59,028
Put your address here
and we'll ship it when it surfaces.

124
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,362
And if it doesn't?

125
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,991
Am I supposed to go the whole weekend
with just these clothes?

126
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:10,372
It's great. I just thought
you were getting champagne.

127
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,251
Trust me,
your dad's gonna love this gift.

128
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,545
Well, don't forget he's retired.

129
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:19,216
He was in the rare flower business,
he'll be interested.

130
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,719
Sounds like they're hard to please.

131
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,264
No, not at all.
He's the sweetest man in the world.

132
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:30,310
- He's gonna love you. I promise.
- As much as he loves Dr Bob?

133
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:34,189
Easy on the sarcasm.
Humour is wasted on my parents.

134
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:36,274
What, are they Amish?

135
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:42,405
OK, no jokes.

136
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,868
- What are you doing?
- What?

137
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:49,871
My dad sees smoking
as a sign of weakness.

138
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:53,750
- OK, I'll leave them in the car.
- No! He'll check there.

139
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,794
- Oh, gosh...
- What...?!

140
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,758
Yeah, the roof
is probably a better idea.

141
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,134
Oh, and...

142
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:05,887
we're not living together.

143
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:08,807
- I thought you said you told them.
- Well...

144
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,602
Hi, Daddy! Hi!

145
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:17,024
- Oh, I missed you so much, Pamcake.
- I missed you too, Popjack.

146
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:24,115
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

147
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:27,285
Shortstack, shortstack,
coming up!

148
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:31,789
Where's my widdle girl?

149
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:34,208
Mommy! My mom!

150
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:36,127
Oh, you look so beautiful!

151
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,713
So do you! Look at you!

152
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:41,048
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mom, Dad, this is Greg.

153
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:44,927
- Hi, I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes.
- It's great to meet you.

154
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,847
- I'm Dina. Welcome to Oyster Bay.
- Thanks.

155
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:55,688
What you driving, a Ford?

156
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:57,481
Uh, yeah. It's a Taurus.

157
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,442
We were gonna get a mid-size,

158
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:02,486
but I figure, hey,
pulling down decent bucks,

159
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,364
might as well go all out
and pop for the full-size.

160
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:08,284
True. Interesting colour.
You pick it?

161
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:11,162
Oh, no, the guy at the counter. Why?

162
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,623
Well, they say geniuses pick green.

163
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:18,670
- But you didn't pick it.
- Jack!

164
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,717
Oh, yucky!
What smells of old sour milk?

165
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,011
Oh, poor Greg got spit up on
by a baby.

166
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:27,429
He didn't!

167
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:30,307
He did, Ma, at Lost Luggage.
The airline lost his bag.

168
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,017
Oh! They didn't!

169
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,644
Yeah, they did.

170
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:36,605
- What about you, honey?
- No, I carried on.

171
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:38,899
That's my girl!

172
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,610
It'll turn up, I'm sure.

173
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:45,364
And Greg, meanwhile,
anything you need, just ask, huh?

174
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:47,658
That's right. Mi casa es su casa.

175
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:50,077
Oh, thanks, Jack. You, too.

176
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,745
Yeah, ha ha!

177
00:10:53,163 --> 00:10:55,415
Hey, Momma, looks great!

178
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:58,043
Really?
We spruced up for the wedding.

179
00:10:58,126 --> 00:10:59,753
This is so nice!

180
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:01,255
We like it.

181
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,257
Beautiful.

182
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,761
Oh, now, Greg,
you have a very unique last name.

183
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:09,930
And we were curious, er,

184
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:12,474
how do you pronounce it?

185
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:15,269
Oh. Just like it's spelled.

186
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:17,729
F-O-C-K-E-R.

187
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:20,941
Focker.

188
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:22,694
Hmm... Focker.

189
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:29,534
- I'll get it, honey.
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

190
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:32,495
Oh, there he is!

191
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,997
Jinxy!

192
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,666
Come here, baby!
Come to Daddy, Jinxy!

193
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:38,001
Come on, Jinxy!

194
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:40,295
Come here. Come to Daddy.

195
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:43,298
Come on. Oh!
Taught him that in one week.

196
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:46,301
This is Pam's cat, Jinxy.

197
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:49,179
- Say hello. Wave to Greg.
- Hello, Jinx.

198
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:52,348
Attaboy!
That took me another week.

199
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:55,268
- My gosh!
- I didn't know you had a cat.

200
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:57,812
I left him here
when I moved to Chicago.

201
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:59,689
Your daddy's best friend!

202
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:03,651
You won't believe it,
he even taught him to use the potty.

203
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:05,361
Dad, that's kinda weird.

204
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:08,489
Why? Now we don't have
to smell kitty litter.

205
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:09,782
That's right.

206
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:13,077
How did you teach
the cat to use the toilet?

207
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:16,414
Easy. I designed a litter box
to put inside the toilet.

208
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:18,917
Once he got used to it,
I took it away.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,169
Oh! That's... Yeah, makes sense.

210
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:26,091
But he doesn't like it. Every chance
he gets he tries to squat and bury.

211
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:28,469
I had to move all my plants.

212
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:32,097
Plus you got another guy
in the house to leave the seat up.

213
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:39,313
He can't lift the seat. He lacks
the strength and opposable thumbs.

214
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:43,692
Ah, right. Opposable...
Didn't think about that.

215
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:47,696
Jinx is a house cat. He can't go out.
He lacks survival skills.

216
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,865
It's just one of those things.

217
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:53,911
I don't think Greg will
be playing with Jinxy. He hates cats.

218
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,373
Pam, I don't hate cats.

219
00:12:57,456 --> 00:13:00,834
I don't... I just happen
to be more of a dog lover.

220
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:02,962
Yeah. Yeah.

221
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:05,798
Well, it's OK if you hate cats, Greg.

222
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:08,342
I don't. I don't hate cats... at all.

223
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:12,596
That's OK. Just be honest about it.
There's some things I hate.

224
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,516
I'm being honest, really. Like what?

225
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:19,979
Why don't we let the kids freshen up?

226
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:24,692
Greg, we'll get you something
to wear from Jack's closet.

227
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:26,443
OK.

228
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,280
- Oh, honey.
- Yeah?

229
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:30,782
I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart.

230
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,869
Me, too, Daddy.

231
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:38,582
Hey, listen, be nice to this one, OK?

232
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,500
I kinda like him.

233
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:42,377
OK, I'll try.

234
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,629
Thank you.

235
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:52,762
Shirt fit OK, Greg?

236
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:54,681
Fantastic. Thanks, Jack.

237
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:56,641
Good. Tom Collins coming up.

238
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:59,227
I wish you hadn't said
that I hate cats.

239
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:00,645
You do hate cats.

240
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:03,440
But you didn't have to say
right when we met.

241
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:05,609
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.

242
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,694
Get your red hot pu-pus!

243
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,613
My goodness! What is that?

244
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:13,074
Oh, that's just...
a little something from me.

245
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:14,993
Go ahead, open it up.

246
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:18,413
Oh, look, honey.
Greg brought us a present!

247
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:20,373
Oh, isn't that nice?

248
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,467
Look at this. It's a flower pot...
with the dirt in it.

249
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:35,765
Actually, the real gift
is what's planted in the soil.

250
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:38,392
The bulb of a Jerusalem Tulip.

251
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:42,605
Which, I was told,

252
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:46,651
is one of the rarest and most
beautiful flowers in existence.

253
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:50,154
Oh, right, right.
Uh, the Jerusalem.

254
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:54,659
From the Jerusalis tulipizius genus,
yes, yes.

255
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,413
Anyway, the guy said
with regular watering

256
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:01,541
it should bloom in six months.

257
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,293
Well, we'll look forward to that.

258
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:15,763
So, uh, Greg, how's your job?

259
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:19,725
Um, good, Pam. Thanks for asking.

260
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:23,396
I recently got transferred to triage.

261
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,398
Is that better than a nurse?

262
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:30,444
No, Mom, triage is a unit of the ER.
That's where all the top nurses work.

263
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:33,406
- Well...
- No. They do.

264
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:36,660
Not many men in your profession.

265
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,747
No, Jack. Not traditionally.

266
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:47,629
Pam, did you know that your father
started his own business?

267
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,631
Really? Dad, that's great!

268
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,596
Yes, I thought with my experience,
why let retirement stop me?

269
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,681
I really admire that.

270
00:15:57,764 --> 00:16:01,059
So what is it? What's...?
What's the new venture?

271
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:03,687
Oh, let me ask you a question, Greg.

272
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,108
Let's say you have kids and you wanna
get out of the house, you know?

273
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:12,279
So you hire a baby-sitter,
someone you think you can trust.

274
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:15,199
References, experience -
all check out fine.

275
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:18,410
But, how do you know for certain

276
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:21,872
that your loved ones
are safe with this stranger?

277
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:26,126
I mean, can you ever really trust
another human being, Greg?

278
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,172
Sure. I think so.

279
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,633
No. The answer is you cannot.

280
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:37,054
Let me show you something.

281
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,807
Take a look at this, Greg.

282
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,354
What's this look like to you?

283
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:47,190
It looks like a teddy bear.

284
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,735
Smile. You're on nanny camera!

285
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:54,364
I've seen these advertised on TV.

286
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,158
Not like this you haven't.
Take a look.

287
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,119
Oh, my gosh.

288
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:02,539
Hi. Where's the other camera?

289
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,875
Right here
in this decorative artefact.

290
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,045
- That's great.
- Our cameras are motion activated.

291
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,006
They tape as soon as they
sense any movement.

292
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,426
We can hide them in mirrors,
lamps, you name it.

293
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,472
So no matter where you go...
we'll be watching you.

294
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:27,564
Couldn't this be construed
as illegal? Invasion of privacy?

295
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:32,318
Greg, when you have little Fockers
running around,

296
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,529
you'll see the need for protection.

297
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:36,531
Yeah.

298
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:42,705
- Impressive, isn't it?
- Quite.

299
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:47,167
- I'll get that.
- I'll get it.

300
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:50,588
OK.

301
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:53,924
Any problem with the documents?

302
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:57,970
Good. I'll meet you at the Oyster Bay
drugstore in about 20 minutes.

303
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:00,681
You gotta be careful
if you call here.

304
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:02,183
If I don't answer,

305
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:05,436
use a southern accent and ask
for the vegetarian special.

306
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:09,148
And the wedding's on Sunday?

307
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:12,026
Oh, that wasn't the airline, was it?

308
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:16,739
No, wrong number. We're out
of Collins, so I'll go to the store.

309
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:19,116
I thought I just bought some.

310
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,578
You know how that stuff just goes.
Back in a jif.

311
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:24,955
Well, why doesn't Greg go with you?

312
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,628
You'll need something in case
your suitcase doesn't show up.

313
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,088
- I'm sure it'll show up.
- Yeah.

314
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:36,884
Don't take a chance. You don't
even have a toothbrush. Go on.

315
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,552
Yeah.

316
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:41,347
OK, unless you want some privacy.

317
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,391
Why would I need privacy?

318
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:47,270
No, I didn't... think you would.

319
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:49,606
OK, let's head out.

320
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:54,361
- Bye.
- Have fun, you guys.

321
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:56,947
Pam, he seems wonderful!

322
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,699
He is.
We have the best time together.

323
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,076
Good.

324
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,204
- Now, have you two been mm-mm-mm?
- Mother!

325
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,998
No! Thinking about
anything permanent?

326
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:10,043
I don't know.
We haven't discussed it, but,

327
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:13,004
I definitely have
the feeling this is it.

328
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:17,384
Dad seems to like him,
don't you think?

329
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,094
Absolutely.

330
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:26,768
It's a big day Saturday.

331
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:28,562
Yes.

332
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,480
This car's...

333
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:35,193
You got... What do you use,
unleaded, regular unleaded?

334
00:19:35,277 --> 00:19:37,153
- Premium.
- Uh-huh.

335
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:45,161
Hey, Jack, now that...
Now that we have a second to talk,

336
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:48,498
I just want you to know
how much Pam means to me.

337
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:51,586
I know we haven't been together
that long,

338
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:56,048
but the time that we have spent
together has been incredible.

339
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:58,718
Greg, how come you don't like cats?

340
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,722
I don't not like cats.

341
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:05,975
I just... I just prefer dogs.

342
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:09,687
I mean, I'm just more of a dog
kind of... You know.

343
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,814
You come home, they're...

344
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:14,942
wagging their little tails,
happy to see you.

345
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:17,153
You need that assurance, do you?

346
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:20,615
You prefer
an emotionally shallow animal?

347
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:22,033
I...

348
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:25,453
When you yell at a dog, his tail
goes between his legs

349
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:28,247
and covers his genitals,
his ears go down.

350
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:31,834
A dog is easy to break. But cats
make you work for their affection.

351
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:33,794
They don't sell out like dogs.

352
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:44,805
You like Peter, Paul, and Mary?

353
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:49,352
Yes, I do. I'm a big fan.

354
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:53,440
# Puff, the magic dragon

355
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:56,860
# Lived by the sea... #

356
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:58,362
Great song.

357
00:20:58,445 --> 00:21:00,405
Yeah. One of my favourites.

358
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,536
Who would've thought
it wasn't really about a dragon, huh?

359
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,622
What do you mean?

360
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:11,333
You know, the whole drug thing.

361
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:17,214
No, I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

362
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:19,800
Some people, uh...

363
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:22,427
think that...

364
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:25,097
To "puff the magic dragon" means...

365
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,100
they're really... Erm...

366
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:30,644
To smoke a... smoke...

367
00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:34,731
...a marijuana cigarette.

368
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:38,527
Well, Puff's just the name
of the boy's magical dragon.

369
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:41,238
Right.

370
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:48,287
- Are you a pot head, Focker?
- No! No. What?

371
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,373
No, no, no, Jack.
No, I'm... I'm not. I...

372
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:54,585
I pass on grass... all the time.

373
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:56,379
I mean not all the time...

374
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:58,256
- Yes or no?
- No. Yes. No.

375
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:08,766
Greg, I'll meet you out front
in about... 12 to 15 minutes.

376
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,185
OK.

377
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:30,538
Hey. Hi.

378
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:32,081
- Hey.
- Hi.

379
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:34,626
Do you have any nicotine patches?

380
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,921
No. We have the gum.

381
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:41,549
All right.

382
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:43,259
You chew it.

383
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:46,804
Thank you. And what's your
most expensive bottle of champagne?

384
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:50,058
Mumm's. It's on sale for $13.95.

385
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:54,896
That's it? You don't have a nice
$80 or $100 bottle or something?

386
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:58,858
You can get a whole bunch of Mumm's.

387
00:23:33,978 --> 00:23:36,063
- Focker?
- Jack. Ready to go?

388
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:40,234
Rough and ready, yeah.
They ran out of Collins mix.

389
00:23:41,944 --> 00:23:43,487
You been waiting long?

390
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:45,990
No! I was just reading up about...

391
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:49,618
...pumps.

392
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:51,620
Pumps?

393
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:54,540
Yes. Breast pumps.

394
00:23:57,668 --> 00:23:59,587
I grew up on a farm.

395
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,221
Get your hot buns. Hot patooties.

396
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:11,057
Wow, Dina, everything looks fabulous.

397
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:14,519
It's such a treat
to have a home-cooked meal like this.

398
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:19,024
Dinner at my house meant fighting
over containers of Chinese food.

399
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:22,944
Oh, you poor thing! There wasn't
enough food to go around?

400
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:27,282
No, there was. We just never really
sat down like a family like this.

401
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:31,161
Greg, would you like to say grace?

402
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:35,207
Uh, well, Greg's Jewish, Dad.
You know that.

403
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,585
You're telling me
the Jews don't pray, honey?

404
00:24:38,668 --> 00:24:40,712
Unless you have some objection?

405
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:42,464
No, no, no. I'd love to.

406
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,008
Pam, it's not like
I'm a rabbi or something.

407
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:48,261
I've said grace at many...
a dinner table.

408
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:58,897
OK.

409
00:25:01,858 --> 00:25:04,736
Oh... dear God...

410
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:09,450
Thank you.

411
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,081
You are such a good God to us.
A kind and gentle and...

412
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,585
accommodating... God.

413
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:26,008
And we thank you,
O, sweet, sweet Lord of Hosts,

414
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:28,135
for the...

415
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:36,477
...smorgasbord you have so aptly
lain at our table this day...

416
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,314
and each day... by day...

417
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:45,278
Day by day... by day.

418
00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:51,993
O... dear Lord, three things we pray.

419
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:55,830
To love thee more dearly,

420
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:59,375
to see thee more clearly,

421
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:04,005
to... follow thee more nearly,

422
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:08,593
day by day... by day. Amen.

423
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:09,802
Amen.

424
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:12,514
Oh, Greg, that was lovely.

425
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:16,268
Thank you, Greg.
That was interesting too.

426
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,403
Oh. That's a... that's a lovely vase.

427
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:27,863
It looks great.

428
00:26:27,946 --> 00:26:31,742
Let me guess, is that one
of your secret cameras too, huh?

429
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:36,580
Greg...

430
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:40,709
That urn holds
the remains of Jack's mother.

431
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:44,254
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That...

432
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:46,590
That's all right. You didn't know.

433
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,050
I'm...

434
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,885
That's our Gran-Gran.

435
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:54,389
We like to think of her
as watching over us as we eat.

436
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:56,850
Love you, Ma. Miss you.

437
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:58,727
Miss you every day.

438
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,105
Oh, honey, why don't
you read Greg your poem?

439
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:04,608
Oh, no. He doesn't want to hear that.

440
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:06,318
What? No, what poem?

441
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:10,030
You see, when Jack had to retire
for health reasons...

442
00:27:10,113 --> 00:27:11,865
That's a bunch of malarkey.

443
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:14,869
...the doctor thought
it would be therapeutic

444
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:17,997
if he expressed his emotions
in an artistic way.

445
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:21,251
You wrote a beautiful poem
about your mother.

446
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:23,545
Please, we really want to hear it.

447
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:26,214
- Poem! Poem!
- Please?

448
00:27:26,297 --> 00:27:27,715
All right.

449
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,218
It's a work in progress.

450
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,679
I'm still not happy with it.

451
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:35,056
As soon as it's ready,

452
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:39,978
I'm going to glaze it onto a plate
and put it next to the urn.

453
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:41,229
Nice.

454
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:43,189
It's very special.

455
00:27:43,273 --> 00:27:46,943
My Mother... by Jack Byrnes.

456
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:52,115
You gave me life,
you gave me milk,

457
00:27:52,198 --> 00:27:54,367
you gave me courage.

458
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,911
Your name was Angela,

459
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:59,038
the angel from heaven.

460
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:04,502
But you were also an angel of God,
and He needed you, too.

461
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,130
Selfishly, I tried to keep you here,

462
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:09,924
while the cancer
ate away your organs,

463
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:12,927
like an unstoppable rebel force,

464
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:15,346
but I couldn't save you,

465
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,307
and I shall see your face...

466
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,311
nevermore,

467
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:22,813
nevermore,

468
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:24,231
nevermore.

469
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:28,444
Until we meet...

470
00:28:28,527 --> 00:28:30,279
in Heaven.

471
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,949
Daddy, that's beautiful.

472
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:35,367
It just gets me...

473
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:40,539
Amazing. So-so-so much love,
yet also so much... information.

474
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:45,252
It takes a lot out of him.

475
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:49,632
Greg, would you like some yams?

476
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:51,383
Thank you. Oh, yeah.

477
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:56,096
You must have had vegetables fresher
than that growing up on a farm.

478
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,474
Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit.

479
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:00,434
He told me he grew up on a farm.

480
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:04,939
Do they have many farms in Detroit?

481
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:08,984
No, Dina. Not a lot.
In fact, Jack, I should clarify this.

482
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:12,988
I didn't actually grow up...
on a farm per se.

483
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:16,575
The house that we grew up in
was originally erected

484
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:19,995
in the early Dutch farm...
colonial style.

485
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,457
So, that plus we had a lot of pets...

486
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:27,504
Which one did you milk then?

487
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:29,381
Dad!

488
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:31,841
Honey, he said he'd pumped milk.

489
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:34,719
What have you ever milked?

490
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,890
Cat.

491
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:40,976
A cat?

492
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:45,605
I milked a cat once.
You wanna hear a story?

493
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:47,607
Sure.

494
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:52,362
My sister had a cat and the cat
birthed a litter of kittens.

495
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:54,447
There must have been 30 of them.

496
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:57,450
There was this runt,
this sweet little,

497
00:29:57,534 --> 00:30:00,620
Little-Engine-That-Could runt
who could...

498
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,875
Wanted to get up there but couldn't
really get access to the...

499
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,127
To the... uh... teat.

500
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,004
Teat?

501
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:10,255
Dad.

502
00:30:10,338 --> 00:30:13,967
What have you.
I went in and just simply...

503
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,469
You know, just...

504
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:21,391
Into a little saucer.

505
00:30:23,143 --> 00:30:26,105
And then took the saucer
and fed it to Geppetto.

506
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:28,024
That was his name. Geppetto.

507
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:30,943
I had... I had no idea
you could milk a cat.

508
00:30:31,027 --> 00:30:33,362
You can milk anything with nipples.

509
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:38,910
I have nipples. Could you milk me?

510
00:30:38,993 --> 00:30:41,871
OK, can we
change the subject, perhaps?

511
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:47,627
Oh, champagne! I thought
we could celebrate with some bubbly.

512
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,338
That'd be great. Good idea.

513
00:30:58,763 --> 00:31:01,057
"I have nipples. Can you milk me?"

514
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,560
Well, in a funny way
you've already seen Deb's ring.

515
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:06,812
Mm-hm. That's true.

516
00:31:07,855 --> 00:31:12,151
Would anybody care for some of
Oyster Bay's finest champagne?

517
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:15,821
That is so sweet of you.
Isn't that a nice gesture?

518
00:31:15,905 --> 00:31:17,448
Yeah, very nice.

519
00:31:17,532 --> 00:31:20,034
How could I have seen Debbie's ring?

520
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:25,081
When I gave Bob the OK, I put him
in touch with my diamond guy

521
00:31:25,164 --> 00:31:28,710
and he picked the exact same design
that Kevin gave you.

522
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:32,881
- Kevin your old boyfriend?
- Thanks, Dad.

523
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:34,675
Kevin was Pam's fiancé.

524
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:43,600
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

525
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:46,645
Jinxy, no! Psst!

526
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:48,647
- Ohh...
- Jinxy, no!

527
00:31:52,192 --> 00:31:52,901
Shit!

528
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:57,239
Greg, sweetie, how are you doing?

529
00:31:57,322 --> 00:32:01,243
Fine, considering
I desecrated your grandma's remains,

530
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:05,455
found out you were engaged and had
your father ask me to milk him.

531
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:08,250
At least then
he was talking to me, so...

532
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,669
You didn't say you were that close.

533
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,839
- Who, Daddy and me?
- No, Kevin and you.

534
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:16,925
Do we have to know
everything about each other?

535
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:19,511
I never knew about your cat-milking.

536
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:22,639
That was a long time ago, Pam.

537
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:26,894
OK, well, so was this.
Kevin's and my...

538
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:30,898
connection was more...
physical than anything else.

539
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:35,111
Physical? Like what, like,
you worked out together?

540
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:37,155
No, no, it was nothing.

541
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:40,700
It was... just a stupid sexual thing.

542
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:42,994
I'm gonna go throw up now.

543
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:46,372
Oh, Greg. Kevin and I
were only engaged for a month

544
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:48,708
before I realised it was a mistake.

545
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:51,544
L- I gave back the ring,
I moved to Chicago

546
00:32:51,628 --> 00:32:55,757
and I met and fell in love with you,
so can we please drop this?

547
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:59,719
- OK.
- Good.

548
00:32:59,802 --> 00:33:03,223
I just feel this isn't going well.
Your dad hates me.

549
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:07,936
He doesn't hate you, sweetie.
Just give him a chance, all right?

550
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,104
Maybe he's nervous too, huh?

551
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:14,192
I thought he would love my gift,
being this big flower guy,

552
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:18,363
but it's like... he didn't show
the slightest bit of interest.

553
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:22,367
Listen to me, forget the gift.

554
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,994
You're the most adorable, loving,

555
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:28,039
sweetest man in the world
and I love you.

556
00:33:29,624 --> 00:33:32,210
And very soon
my parents are gonna see that

557
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:34,337
and grow to love you too, OK?

558
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,131
OK?

559
00:33:38,342 --> 00:33:41,387
Speaking of growing to love you...

560
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,764
- It's late.
- I know it's late.

561
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:46,392
But Mr Winkie
is still on Chicago time

562
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:51,021
and we both know there's only one way
to make Mr Winkie go away, right?

563
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:53,858
And there it is.

564
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:01,532
What's with the robe?

565
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:05,244
It's Pam's.
My pyjamas are in the suitcase.

566
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:07,788
Hey, I'll lend you a pair of Jack's.

567
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:09,623
- OK, honey?
- Sure.

568
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:11,417
You don't have to do that.

569
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,294
- No, no.
- No, we have to.

570
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:16,130
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

571
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:19,174
I just want to say
don't worry about what happened.

572
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:21,969
Oh. Well, thanks, Jack.

573
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:24,680
I still... I feel horrible, I mean...

574
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,808
Well, it was a horrible thing.

575
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:35,357
But let's put all that behind us
and enjoy our weekend together.

576
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:38,027
OK.

577
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,946
Thank you, Daddy.

578
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,615
Chug-chug-chug...

579
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:44,242
Thank you. These'll do just fine.

580
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:45,535
Good night.

581
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:48,246
Night. Why'd you give him
my favourite pair?

582
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,082
Night, see you in the morning,
right?

583
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,210
- Have a good sleep.
- You too.

584
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:57,505
Oh, no, no, Greg, we made up
the pullout for you down in the den.

585
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,969
Oh. OK, cos Pam said I should sleep
in Debbie's room, but...

586
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:07,098
Debbie's sleeping here tomorrow
so you'll have more privacy,

587
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:08,683
your own bathroom.

588
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:12,395
Just try not to flush the toilet.
It's a little quirky.

589
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:14,064
OK.

590
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:16,316
Oh, one more thing.

591
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:23,406
Look, I understand you've probably
had premarital relations with my Pam,

592
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,992
but under our roof, it's my way

593
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:29,496
or the Long Island Expressway,
is that understood?

594
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,873
Of course. Yeah.

595
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:34,918
Good. Keep your snake
in its cage for 72 hours.

596
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:37,879
OK.

597

Yeah, yeah. Jack.

We've been through this
with every boyfriend since,

607
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:24,844
what, middle school?

608
00:36:25,928 --> 00:36:28,347
I think Greg is a lovely young man.

609
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:32,894
And honey,
Pam thinks he might be the one.

610
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:37,023
She said that?
She said those exact words?

611
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:42,069
Well, I didn't tape record her, Jack,
but that's the impression I got.

612
00:36:42,153 --> 00:36:44,530
I feel sorry that boy never had...

613
00:36:44,614 --> 00:36:48,285
What kind of a family
doesn't sit down for dinner?

Fugitives.

Try to enjoy the weekend, honey.

616
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:56,877
- Both our daughters are in love.
- That's what I'm worried about.

617
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,378
Oh...

618
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:02,466
Oh, jeez. I just realised something.

619
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:04,551
- What?
- Pam's middle name.

620
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:07,512
Martha... Oh, no.

621
00:37:07,596 --> 00:37:09,848
Pamela Martha Focker.

"Operation Ko Samui"?

623
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:23,423
Looking for something, Greg?

624
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:27,677
Oh. Jesus, Jack, you scared me.

625
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,681
Well, I heard a noise so
I came to see if everything was OK.

626
00:38:31,764 --> 00:38:36,603
I just... I'm sorry, I saw a light on
in here and I kinda stumbled in...

627
00:38:36,686 --> 00:38:39,022
That's OK. See anything interesting?

628
00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:43,693
No. Not at all. I mean... I mean,
this is great, though.

629
00:38:43,776 --> 00:38:47,155
I love this... What you...
It's a cosy little nook.

630
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:49,449
I noticed you were looking at that.

631
00:38:51,618 --> 00:38:52,745
Yeah.

632
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:55,206
It's an antique polygraph machine.

633
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,874
Is that what that is?

634
00:38:56,957 --> 00:38:59,835
I've seen these before
but never up close.

635
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:01,879
You know what?

636
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:05,299
Why don't you try that on?

637
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:08,052
Oh... that's OK.

638
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:11,138
We'll have some fun!
I'll show you how it works.

639
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:14,516
- I shouldn't.
- Why? You've nothing to hide.

640
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,561
- No. I know.
- So there's no problem.

641
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:20,856
- No, there's no problem.
- So try it on.

642
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,734
- OK.
- I'll help you.

643
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:34,495
Don't worry, you'll enjoy this.

644
00:39:36,664 --> 00:39:38,123
All right.

645
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,213
Looks complicated. Now,
these aren't 100% accurate, right?

646
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:47,258
You'd be surprised
how accurate they are.

647
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:49,843
They can tell if someone's lying.

648
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:52,680
Now I'm gonna ask you some questions.

649
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:55,766
All you have to do
is answer yes or no.

650
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:57,185
OK.

651
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,272
All right, let's give it a whirl.

652
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:05,193
- Did you fly on an aeroplane today?
- Yes, I did.

653
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:10,782
No peeking. Did we eat
pot roast for dinner tonight?

654
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,075
Yes.

655
00:40:13,118 --> 00:40:15,203
Was it undercooked?

656
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:23,712
N- n-no, it was rare.
It was a little rare for my taste,

657
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:25,380
but I... I wouldn't...

658
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:28,133
I'm just kidding. I'm just... OK.

659
00:40:30,218 --> 00:40:33,346
Relax, relax.
The needles are jumping.

660
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:38,727
Have you ever watched
pornographic videos?

661
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,400
No.

662
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,697
- I mean, well, I don't...
- Yes or no?

663
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,667
Hey.

664
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,836
Hey.

665
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,217
What's the matter, you can't sleep?

666
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,510
No, I'm just going over my answers

667
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,347
from the polygraph test
your dad gave me.

668
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,141
- Oh, no, he didn't?
- Yeah, he did.

669
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,560
Well, did you lie to him?

670
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:23,731
No! I mean... Well, he asked me
if we were living together, I...

671
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,441
What did you tell him?

672
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:29,570
Nothing. Your mother walked in
and I yanked the thingies off.

673
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:34,075
Would you react like this if
he shoved bamboo shoots up my nails?

674
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:38,538
Or does he hook all your boyfriends
up to his little machine?

675
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,874
He doesn't need a machine.
He's a human lie detector.

676
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,292
What?

677
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,587
My father was never
in the rare flower business.

678
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,340
That was just his cover.

679
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,635
He was in the CIA for 34 years.

680
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,554
How could you not tell me this?

681
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,681
I wanted to, honey,

682
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,101
but it was strictly
on a "need-to-know" basis.

683
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:06,733
So, what, he's in the CIA?
He was a spy? He is a spy...?

684
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:09,278
No, he was a psychological profiler.

685
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:12,489
He interrogated double agents
in the company.

686
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:14,157
Oh, that's great.

687
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:17,411
I was scared of your dad
when he was a florist.

688
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,956
It's wonderful to know
I've got a CIA spy hunter on my ass.

689
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,459
Would you stop?
You're doing great, OK?

690
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:27,671
This is a lot to take in, honey.
I'm sorry.

691
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,590
It's just weird.

692
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:32,676
I know, but you're doing fine.
I promise.

693
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:43,896
- No!
- What's wrong, sweetie?

694
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:47,608
I forgot. I'm not supposed
to let the snake out.

695
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:49,234
You what?

696
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:51,653
I told your dad
I wouldn't touch you.

697
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,781
Well, I'm not in junior high
any more, OK?

698
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:57,910
No, seriously. I wanna try
to respect his rules, OK?

699
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,454
OK. Fine.

700
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:04,875
You go ahead and get some sleep
and I'll see you in the morning.

701
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,251
OK.

702
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:19,098
Morning, Greg.

703
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:21,643
Morning.

704
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:25,855
Pam told me she let you in on
a little secret of mine last night.

705
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:28,733
Yes, she did.

706
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:32,820
As long as you keep your mouth shut
for the rest of your life,

707
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:34,989
you're in no immediate danger.

708
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,826
I won't tell.

709
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:41,955
I'm just being humorous.

710
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:45,083
Ha. That's funny.

711
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,921
The fact is, Greg,
with the knowledge you've been given

712
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:53,049
you are now on the inside
of what I like to call

713
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:57,011
the Byrnes Family Circle of Trust.

714
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:59,973
I keep nothing from you,
you keep nothing from me

715
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:02,892
and round and round we go.

716
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:04,185
OK.

717
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,313
Understood.

718
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:12,736
OK, good. Come on,
let's go inside and have breakfast.

719
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,535
# Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat,
where are you?

720
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:22,413
# I love you #

721
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:25,708
Jinxy.

722
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,628
Not at the table, honey, please.

723
00:44:29,712 --> 00:44:31,088
Attaboy!

724
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,091
Hey, hey, look who's up!

725
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:35,718
You must be Greg.

726
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:37,386
Hello.

727
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:40,598
Somebody had a little visit
from the hair fairy.

728
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,349
Oh, yes.

729
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:44,435
Nice do. Nice do.

730
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:47,354
I'll do the intros.
This is my sister Debbie.

731
00:44:47,438 --> 00:44:49,899
- The bride to be. Congratulations.
- Hi.

732
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:53,652
- And her fiancé Dr Bob.
- Oh, call me Bob... MD.

733
00:44:53,736 --> 00:44:55,738
And his parents, Linda Banks.

734
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,323
Hi, how are you?

735
00:44:57,406 --> 00:45:00,618
And the world famous plastic surgeon
Dr Larry.

736
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,620
Oh, now, cut that out!

737
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:08,626
- Greg's in medicine too, Larry.
- Oh, really? What field?

738
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,878
Uh, nursing.

739
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:14,507
- That's good.
- No, really, what field?

740
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,677
Nursing.

741
00:45:20,597 --> 00:45:24,226
Why don't I get you a chair, Greg?

742
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:26,853
Thank you. Thanks.

743
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:29,856
So, you didn't want to go
for the MD?

744
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,902
No, I thought about it
but I decided it wasn't for me.

745
00:45:33,985 --> 00:45:35,904
Just as well, Board's a killer.

746
00:45:35,987 --> 00:45:38,782
Actually Greg aced his MCATs.

747
00:45:38,865 --> 00:45:41,117
- You serious?
- No, I did OK.

748
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:43,495
Oh, he did more than OK, trust me.

749
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:46,623
Why did you take the test?

750
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:50,877
I wanted to keep my options open.
Nursing was just better for me.

751
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:53,797
You can work in
several different areas.

752
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,926
I can focus 100% on patient care.
Doctors have bureaucracy...

753
00:45:58,009 --> 00:46:01,930
Uh-oh! Wasn't your friend Andy
supposed to be here by now?

754
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:06,977
Oh, I thought Deb told you,
Dr Andy can't make the wedding.

755
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,188
Damn! Now I have to reconfigure
the whole procession.

756
00:46:10,272 --> 00:46:15,443
Um... Bob, why doesn't Greg
stand in for Andy, be the usher?

757
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:17,780
Oh... No, Pam. No.

758
00:46:17,864 --> 00:46:21,742
That'll be fine.
Bob, Greg will be your second usher.

759
00:46:21,826 --> 00:46:24,537
Uh... Yeah, yeah. OK, sure.

760
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,374
Good. Well, let's all finish up
and get ready to go.

761
00:46:28,457 --> 00:46:32,128
We have a pre-activity briefing
in about 32 minutes.

762
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:35,381
Really! In that case,
I'd better get upstairs

763
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:37,925
and pay a visit
to the shower fairy.

764
00:46:42,555 --> 00:46:44,098
Dina, thank you so...

765
00:46:47,894 --> 00:46:49,395
Hey, you OK?

766
00:46:49,478 --> 00:46:51,397
Why didn't you wake me up?

767
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,318
- I thought you'd like to sleep late.
- Not when I'm a guest.

768
00:46:55,401 --> 00:46:56,819
It's OK.

769
00:46:56,903 --> 00:47:00,990
No, it's not OK. Tell that
to Dr Torquemada and his Inquisition.

770
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:03,492
Go take a shower, get dressed
and come down.

771
00:47:03,576 --> 00:47:06,913
- In what?
- Borrow some of Dad's clothes.

772
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:09,373
- No, I don't... Come on!
- Why not?

773
00:47:09,457 --> 00:47:13,461
I don't feel comfortable
wearing your dad's underwear.

774
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:16,422
OK, go wake up Denny
and borrow some of his.

775
00:47:16,505 --> 00:47:20,509
Wake up your brother, who I
never met, to borrow his clothes?

776
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:24,890
OK. All right. Where's Denny's room?

777
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:27,017
Top of the stairs, turn right.

778
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:34,942
Denny?

779
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,030
Denny?

780
00:47:41,114 --> 00:47:43,283
Denny?

781
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:47,162
Hello?

782
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:02,469
Hey, hey!
What the hell are you doing here?

783
00:48:02,553 --> 00:48:04,888
I'm... I'm Greg, Pam's friend.

784
00:48:04,972 --> 00:48:07,140
Were you sniffing my boxers, dude?

785
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:12,271
No! Dude, no. She said I could come
up and borrow some clothes from you.

786
00:48:12,354 --> 00:48:15,524
- No, no. Close the door... quick.
- OK.

787
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:20,612
- You tell anybody I wasn't here?
- No. They think you're asleep,

788
00:48:20,696 --> 00:48:22,406
so, it's all good.

789
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:24,534
You scared me.

790
00:48:31,249 --> 00:48:34,460
Your dad keeps you guys
under a close watch, huh?

791
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,379
No, it's not that bad.

792
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:39,966
Your little Pamcake's
got it a lot worse than I do.

793
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:42,093
Oh! You need some clothes.

794
00:48:42,176 --> 00:48:44,596
Yes, that would be great, thanks.

795
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,765
Hey, glad to hook you up. All right.

796
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:50,894
Like what you've done
with the crib.

797
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:56,065
Oh, Lil' Kim. She's phat.

798
00:49:00,945 --> 00:49:02,906
P-H phat.

799
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:05,325
These ought to do it.
Here you go, chief.

800
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:06,993
- All right!
- Enjoy.

801
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:09,245
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

802
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:12,916
Oh, don't worry about
the little covert op, all right?

803
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:15,460
- Keep it on the low down.
- Down low.

804
00:49:15,543 --> 00:49:17,170
No doubt.

805
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:21,799
Come get your revised itineraries!

806
00:49:21,883 --> 00:49:24,052
- Larry and Linda.
- Got it.

807
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:26,179
Bob. Honey.

808
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:30,517
I'm gonna activate the alarm.
It'll go off in T minus 16 seconds.

809
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:33,896
- I don't need a jacket.
- It's cold out. Hold on.

810
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:35,898
Here, take Denny's jacket.

811
00:49:39,235 --> 00:49:41,779
Denny, I'm lending Greg your jacket.

812
00:49:41,862 --> 00:49:43,781
- Whatever.
- Let's go.

813
00:49:46,325 --> 00:49:47,493
Fuck!

814
00:49:58,254 --> 00:50:01,215
- Denny! How's the tux fit?
- Dad.

815
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,508
What's that?

816
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:05,761
Oh, it's a sculpture
I found in Greg's jacket.

817
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:12,351
This isn't a sculpture.
It's a device for smoking marijuana.

818
00:50:13,686 --> 00:50:15,437
Really?

819
00:50:17,106 --> 00:50:19,942
Not mine. It's not.

820
00:50:23,529 --> 00:50:25,281
Jack. How are you doing?

821
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:31,036
Like the top hat. It compliments you.

822
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,164
Can I talk to you for a minute?

823
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:40,380
Sit down.

824
00:50:44,217 --> 00:50:48,054
Did I not clearly explain
the Circle of Trust to you, Greg?

825
00:50:48,138 --> 00:50:50,891
Mm, yeah. I think I got it.

826
00:50:50,974 --> 00:50:53,602
Then, is there something
you want to tell me?

827
00:50:53,685 --> 00:50:56,104
Mm, I... I don't think so.

828
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,773
Didn't we discuss this in the car?

829
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:04,613
Oh! Yes! You mean me and Pam.
I'd love to talk to you about that.

830
00:51:04,696 --> 00:51:07,532
Not about Pam,
we're talking about you.

831
00:51:07,616 --> 00:51:10,827
If I can't trust you, Greg,
then I have no choice

832
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:13,079
but to put you outside the Circle.

833
00:51:13,163 --> 00:51:16,249
And once you're out,
there's no coming back.

834
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:21,296
I would definitely
like to stay inside the circle.

835
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:23,632
Well, then tell me the truth.

836
00:51:24,716 --> 00:51:26,468
OK.

837
00:51:29,888 --> 00:51:32,724
Jack, I don't know
what we're talking about.

838
00:51:33,683 --> 00:51:36,103
All right, Focker, I'm a patient man.

839
00:51:36,187 --> 00:51:39,982
That's what 19 months in a Vietnamese
prison camp'll do to you.

840
00:51:40,066 --> 00:51:43,528
But I will be watching you,
studying your every move,

841
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:48,032
and if I find that you are trying
to corrupt my firstborn child,

842
00:51:48,115 --> 00:51:50,159
I will bring you down, baby.

843
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:52,620
I will bring you down to Chinatown.

844
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:57,416
# What am I gonna do?

845
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,377
# Hard to tell

846
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,505
# No, I'm not gonna kill myself,
but I might as well

847
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,555
I thought
we were going to Kevin's house.

848
00:52:10,638 --> 00:52:13,641
We are, sweetie.
This is Kevin's new house.

849
00:52:15,685 --> 00:52:18,854
Amazing house!
Not bad, huh?

850
00:52:21,023 --> 00:52:25,152
Maybe he uses marijuana
for medicinal purposes. People do.

851
00:52:25,236 --> 00:52:27,488
Look, he's been lying from the start.

852
00:52:27,572 --> 00:52:30,157
Hey. Getting some quality time
with the boys?

853
00:52:30,241 --> 00:52:31,784
Yeah. It was fun.

854
00:52:31,868 --> 00:52:35,162
Listen, I hope this lunch
isn't too weird for you.

855
00:52:35,246 --> 00:52:39,418
Why would "BBQ at Best Man's"
be weird?

856
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:42,504
Oh, my God, Greg!
I was sure I told you.

857
00:52:42,588 --> 00:52:45,632
Kevin is Bob's best man.
This is his place.

858
00:52:45,716 --> 00:52:47,426
Kevin, your ex-fiancé?

859
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:51,972
How does he know Bob?

860
00:52:56,226 --> 00:52:59,479
Well, they... went
to Lacrosse Camp together,

861
00:52:59,563 --> 00:53:03,066
and Kevin was the one
who introduced Bob to Debbie.

862
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,943
Lacrosse Camp?

863
00:53:05,027 --> 00:53:10,240
I was able to salvage this
wood from an old chapel in Nantucket.

864
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:16,079
The house is amazing.
Thank you.

865
00:53:16,163 --> 00:53:19,917
OK, the sun is out, the grill
is hot and the pool is luke,

866
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,462
so if I can interest you in a swim
and a BBQ, just follow me.

867
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:25,631
All right, Kevo. Right on schedule.

868
00:53:25,714 --> 00:53:28,508
- Bring it on!
- Must've cost a fortune.

869
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:50,573
- You OK, sweetie?
- Yeah.

870
00:53:50,657 --> 00:53:53,159
I'm really sorry. I thought you knew.

871
00:53:53,243 --> 00:53:54,911
It's not a big deal.

872
00:53:54,994 --> 00:53:59,332
If I can handle a weekend
without sex and cigarettes,

873
00:53:59,415 --> 00:54:01,501
I can handle your ex-fiancé.

874
00:54:01,584 --> 00:54:03,169
OK, thank you.

875
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:07,257
For the floor you're walking on,
I chose Bolivian wormwood.

876
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,925
It works well in here.

877
00:54:09,008 --> 00:54:13,888
I have the Viking range and the twin
Sub-Zs. They open up right there.

878
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:15,848
Oh, I get it. Like, hidden.

879
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:18,434
- Yeah, kinda blend in.
- Great.

880
00:54:18,518 --> 00:54:20,562
Are you a homeowner, Greg?

881
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:22,814
No, no. I rent.

882
00:54:24,232 --> 00:54:28,152
So, things are going
real well for you, aren't they, Kevo?

883
00:54:28,236 --> 00:54:30,947
Things have been going
so great lately.

884
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:34,784
I got in early on some wireless IPOs
and the stuff just skyrocketed.

885
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,329
Greg, what line of work are you in?

886
00:54:38,413 --> 00:54:39,831
I'm in healthcare.

887
00:54:39,914 --> 00:54:43,835
So you know what I mean. There's lots
to be made with the biotech stuff.

888
00:54:43,918 --> 00:54:45,963
I don't have to tell you that.

889
00:54:46,046 --> 00:54:48,090
How's your portfolio?

890
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:50,259
I'd say strong...

891
00:54:50,342 --> 00:54:52,803
to quite strong.

892
00:54:52,887 --> 00:54:56,974
Yeah, strike while the iron's hot.
Now's the time.

893
00:54:57,057 --> 00:54:58,726
Greg's a male nurse.

894
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:01,437
That's right. Thank you, Jack.

895
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,232
Wow. That's great,
to give something back like that.

896
00:55:05,316 --> 00:55:07,610
I'd love to do some volunteer work.

897
00:55:07,693 --> 00:55:11,989
The other day, I saw this dog,
he had, like, a gimp, he couldn't...

898
00:55:12,072 --> 00:55:15,326
It made me feel terrible.
I wished I could do something.

899
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:18,829
Well, I get paid,
but also it feels, you know, good,

900
00:55:18,913 --> 00:55:21,165
so it's kind of, everybody wins.

901
00:55:21,248 --> 00:55:25,753
What do you...? You're a Wall Street
trader, an investment guy?

902
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:30,174
I don't like to be painted with
that brush. Yes, that's my job...

903
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:34,637
Do we have time? OK, I wanna show
you what I'm really interested in.

904
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,764
Come on, let's go.

905
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:44,313
Wow! Looks like somebody got an "A"
in wood shop.

906
00:55:44,396 --> 00:55:47,107
Yeah, it's always been
kind of a hobby.

907
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:49,444
I whittled that out of beechwood.

908
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:53,615
It's beautiful.
So, what got you into carpentering?

909
00:55:53,698 --> 00:55:57,202
Carpentry?
I guess I'd have to say Jesus.

910
00:55:57,285 --> 00:55:59,162
He was a carpenter and I figured

911
00:55:59,246 --> 00:56:03,750
if you're gonna follow in someone's
footsteps, who better than Christ?

912
00:56:08,421 --> 00:56:09,506
Greg's Jewish.

913
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:12,592
- Are you?
- Yeah.

914
00:56:14,135 --> 00:56:17,264
Well, so was JC!
Wow. You're in good company.

915
00:56:17,347 --> 00:56:19,891
Ha! Right.

916
00:56:21,851 --> 00:56:23,687
I'm gonna head to the pool,

917
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:27,357
but why don't you show
Greg and Pam the gift?

918
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,901
You made a gift?
Greg.

919
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:34,739
I just put a fresh coat of lacquer on
this, so bear with me with the fumes.

920
00:56:36,032 --> 00:56:38,159
Wow! Kev!

921
00:56:39,494 --> 00:56:42,706
- Isn't that something?
- That's incredible!

922
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:44,875
Roses. Deb's favourite!

923
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:48,795
- Yes, right.
- The little holes are for candles?

924
00:56:48,879 --> 00:56:52,591
Yes. Later, they'll collect
rainfall and make a tiny birdbath.

925
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,843
That's great.

926
00:56:53,926 --> 00:56:57,054
It's beautiful. What is it?

927
00:56:57,138 --> 00:57:01,726
It's an altar.
Or you might call it a chuppah?

928
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:06,188
Isn't that sweet? Wow.

929
00:57:06,272 --> 00:57:09,692
I'll take it to the Byrnes'
and tomorrow Robert and Deborah

930
00:57:09,775 --> 00:57:12,194
will meet beneath it
to become man and wife.

931
00:57:12,278 --> 00:57:17,158
And later, when they purchase a home,
maybe it'll grace their garden.

932
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:21,120
Well, that's my...
sappy, romantic idea.

933
00:57:23,915 --> 00:57:26,292
It must have taken forever to build.

934
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:29,420
Not too bad.
About 70 hours, which isn't bad,

935
00:57:29,503 --> 00:57:33,174
considering I carved it by hand
from one piece of wood.

936
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:39,263
'Hey, Kevo! 12:15.
Time to start the barbecue. '

937
00:57:39,347 --> 00:57:42,308
OK, Mr B.
I better get back to playing host.

938
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:46,145
You guys grab your suits
and I'll meet you at the pool.

939
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:48,147
I'm gonna pass on the swimming.

940
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,690
You can't!

941
00:57:49,774 --> 00:57:51,692
I don't even have a suit.

942
00:57:51,776 --> 00:57:54,987
'Pamcake,
Pop's got your suit out here. '

943
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:58,158
- Coming, Dad.
- You gotta get going.

944
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:02,246
Gosh, she's great. Congratulations.

945
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:07,417
Thank you. And by the way, she had
the nicest things to say about you.

946
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:09,169
Really?

947
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:11,171
Yeah.

948
00:58:12,297 --> 00:58:16,301
Gosh, yeah,
we had some good times together.

949
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:19,263
Whoo, she is a tomcat!

950
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:26,770
Whew! So, let me hook you up
with some trunks, Gregor.

951
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:29,815
- I'm not gonna swim...
- I'm not taking no for an answer.

952
00:58:29,898 --> 00:58:34,611
Cold buffet's on the left,
wine and champagne on the right.

953
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,876
Yeah, that'd be grea...

954
00:58:49,877 --> 00:58:52,296
Hey, there he is! Get out here.

955
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:57,301
G- man, we got salmon,
we got swordfish. What'll it be?

956
00:58:57,384 --> 00:59:00,179
Uh... how about a little of both...

957
00:59:00,263 --> 00:59:02,849
K-dog... I'm pretty hungry.

958
00:59:02,932 --> 00:59:05,768
I think they call that the munchies.

959
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:10,773
Let's go.
Come on, Kev. Serve it up!

960
00:59:19,908 --> 00:59:21,701
Damn!

961
00:59:21,784 --> 00:59:23,620
Come on, team. He's got nothing!

962
00:59:23,703 --> 00:59:24,746
Service!

963
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:32,503
- Nice serve, pal.
- All right!

964
00:59:32,587 --> 00:59:33,755
Whoa, yes!

965
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:36,132
Get it!

966
00:59:37,926 --> 00:59:39,427
Come on!

967
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:43,181
- Nice shot, Maverick!
- Sweet setup, Iceman!

968
00:59:43,264 --> 00:59:45,475
Nice one, Nurse!

969
00:59:45,558 --> 00:59:48,770
- Glen, don't be afraid of the ball.
- It's Greg.

970
00:59:48,853 --> 00:59:50,605
Huddle up, team.

971
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:53,024
Not Glen. Greg is afraid of the ball.

972
00:59:53,107 --> 00:59:54,776
This is unacceptable!

973
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:56,819
Here's what we gotta do.

974
00:59:56,903 --> 01:00:00,114
- Let's go!
- We're getting creamed.

975
01:00:00,198 --> 01:00:03,661
If Florence Nightingale
played some defence...

976
01:00:03,744 --> 01:00:06,747
- Larry, I missed one shot.
- It was a big shot!

977
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:09,458
Larry, keep floating. Denny, go deep.

978
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:12,336
Greg, nobody's
expecting much from you

979
01:00:12,419 --> 01:00:14,672
so if I set you up can you spike it?

980
01:00:15,756 --> 01:00:17,841
Yeah, I'd have to be pretty high.

981
01:00:17,925 --> 01:00:21,345
I bet you would, Panama Red.

982
01:00:21,428 --> 01:00:24,390
- All right, look sharp.
- Let's play ball!

983
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:27,434
Come on!

984
01:00:27,518 --> 01:00:29,353
Let's go! Come on!

985
01:00:33,315 --> 01:00:36,569
You got to spike those, Focker!
You got to spike.

986
01:00:36,652 --> 01:00:38,195
Look how Bob did it.

987
01:00:38,279 --> 01:00:39,363
Thanks.

988
01:00:39,446 --> 01:00:40,823
Fire it up, Focker!

989
01:00:40,906 --> 01:00:43,909
- Let's do it! Good shot!
- Way to go, Deb!

990
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:45,369
Greg!

991
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:59,425
- What's the matter with you?
- It's only a game!

992
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:07,225
My eye! Oh, my eye!

993
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:17,527
- Pam, help your sister.
- I'm sorry, Deb.

994
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:20,405
You can see "Voight"
backwards on your forehead.

995
01:01:20,488 --> 01:01:21,698
Denny!

996
01:01:21,781 --> 01:01:25,410
You the bandleader?
Go over song selection with Bob. Bob!

997
01:01:26,453 --> 01:01:29,497
- Are you a Mr Focker?
- Yes.

998
01:01:29,581 --> 01:01:33,293
- OK, sign here, please.
- Thank you.

999
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:45,805
Hey, your suitcase.
You made sure it's all there?

1000
01:01:45,889 --> 01:01:48,183
Yeah, it's fine. What's up?

1001
01:01:50,352 --> 01:01:54,397
Just want to make sure you're OK
since hitting that spike.

1002
01:01:54,481 --> 01:01:57,400
- I'm really sorry about that.
- That's OK.

1003
01:01:57,484 --> 01:02:00,278
I don't know what
got into me, Iceman.

1004
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:03,240
- Iceman?
- Sorry, is it special for you two?

1005
01:02:03,323 --> 01:02:06,743
- No, Greg. Stop it.
- Stop what, Iceman?

1006
01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:10,540
Top Gun was a very popular movie
when we dated. That's it.

1007
01:02:10,623 --> 01:02:13,501
Hey, Iceman,
I have no problem with that.

1008
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:17,004
Do you wanna be Maverick?
Is that what this is about?

1009
01:02:17,088 --> 01:02:18,965
I can't be, Kevin's Maverick.

1010
01:02:19,048 --> 01:02:22,426
No, he used to be,
but we can change that.

1011
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,220
Can he be Goose?

1012
01:02:24,303 --> 01:02:26,514
No, because Goose dies in the end.

1013
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:29,976
It's very sad.

1014
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,146
- Honey, I don't...
- Greg, shut up.

1015
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,273
OK.

1016
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,370
Dad! You ever think of knocking?

1017
01:02:49,453 --> 01:02:52,206
Not in my own den.
What are you two doing?

1018
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,417
I'd say rounding second base.

1019
01:02:56,961 --> 01:02:58,963
This is Greg's room, Dad.

1020
01:02:59,046 --> 01:03:03,593
Not now - it's storage. Greg's in
Deb's room and she'll bunk with you.

1021
01:03:03,676 --> 01:03:06,971
- Fine. Come on, Greg.
- I'll be right up.

1022
01:03:08,806 --> 01:03:12,435
- Oh, good. They found your suitcase.
- Yeah.

1023
01:03:12,518 --> 01:03:15,105
I don't know
what happened at the tux shop

1024
01:03:15,188 --> 01:03:18,150
but if I gave you
the wrong impression

1025
01:03:18,233 --> 01:03:21,486
regarding Pam in any way,
I'm sorry, OK?

1026
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:23,864
I have the best intentions with Pam.

1027
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:26,909
Actually,
there's something in my suitcase

1028
01:03:26,992 --> 01:03:29,620
that I plan to give her
that I think, um,

1029
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:31,663
symbolises...

1030
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,793
...the level of my commitment to her.

1031
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:40,422
And I wouldn't feel right
asking her to wear it

1032
01:03:40,505 --> 01:03:44,801
without her father's
permission... Jack?

1033
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:46,970
Did you flush this toilet?

1034
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:51,642
Maybe... You know what?
Maybe Jinx flushed it.

1035
01:03:51,725 --> 01:03:56,563
I saw Jinxy come in last night
and squat and relieve himself.

1036
01:03:56,647 --> 01:04:00,359
Jinx knows not to use that toilet.
If he did, he'd never flush it.

1037
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:01,902
What does it matter?

1038
01:04:01,985 --> 01:04:06,073
The matter, Greg RN, is when
this toilet is flushed, it runs.

1039
01:04:06,156 --> 01:04:09,535
With a near-full septic tank
and toilet running all night,

1040
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:11,537
you could have a problem.

1041
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,789
Mr Byrnes?

1042
01:04:13,872 --> 01:04:16,500
This is not part
of my job description.

1043
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:19,254
Nice stench.
Really on a roll there, bud.

1044
01:04:19,337 --> 01:04:21,005
Bite me, Denny.

1045
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:25,385
In 20 hours there's a wedding here,
so I need my cesspool pumped now.

1046
01:04:25,468 --> 01:04:27,136
Not tomorrow, now!

1047
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:30,306
Dad, what's going on? Oh, my God.

1048
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,225
What's that smell?

1049
01:04:32,308 --> 01:04:34,477
That smell, Bob, is our shit.

1050
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:37,480
Focker made the septic tank overflow.

1051
01:04:37,564 --> 01:04:40,233
Jack, I told you it wasn't me.
It was Jinx.

1052
01:04:40,316 --> 01:04:44,612
Focker, I'm not gonna tell you again!
Jinx cannot flush the toilet!

1053
01:04:44,696 --> 01:04:46,656
He's a cat, for Christ's sakes!

1054
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:48,616
He doesn't have thumbs, Focker!

1055
01:04:50,243 --> 01:04:52,912
- Hey, look at this!
- Kevo!

1056
01:04:52,996 --> 01:04:55,081
Over by the tree, right?

1057
01:04:59,502 --> 01:05:02,881
No, no, not on the lawn.
Stay where you are!

1058
01:05:02,964 --> 01:05:04,799
- Not on the lawn!
- Kevin!

1059
01:05:05,842 --> 01:05:07,093
No, no!

1060
01:05:13,975 --> 01:05:16,102
What the heck?

1061
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:20,189
# I got my mojo working

1062
01:05:20,815 --> 01:05:22,860
# Just won't work on you

1063
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,197
# I got my mojo working

1064
01:05:28,282 --> 01:05:30,367
# Just won't work on you... #

1065
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:32,786
Oh, no!

1066
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:37,124
That's what I said I wanted
cos it is a black Samsonite suitcase.

1067
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:40,669
But, you think that
it's possible that Samsonite,

1068
01:05:40,753 --> 01:05:45,049
in some crazy scheme to turn
a profit, made more than one?

1069
01:05:45,132 --> 01:05:48,802
- 'I don't think so, sir. '
- Really, you don't? Hey!

1070
01:05:48,886 --> 01:05:50,554
Jinxy, stop.

1071
01:06:38,937 --> 01:06:42,190
I know I signed for it...
Don't tell me... What?

1072
01:06:42,274 --> 01:06:45,485
Do me a favour.
Can I talk to your supervisor?

1073
01:06:45,569 --> 01:06:48,113
- Hmm? What's your name?
- 'Joy. '

1074
01:06:48,196 --> 01:06:51,825
- Get me your supervisor.
- 'He's on a break. '

1075
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:54,870
When he gets back,
have him give me a call, OK?

1076
01:06:54,953 --> 01:06:56,955
It's a very important bag.

1077
01:07:01,835 --> 01:07:03,545
Jinx!

1078
01:07:04,671 --> 01:07:07,799
Don't ask me what for,
I just need you to do this thing.

1079
01:07:07,883 --> 01:07:10,427
I'm in a time situation
so just do it.

1080
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:14,306
- 'OK. Greg Focker? '
- Greg or Gregory. Run both names.

1081
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:17,809
Psst! Jinx! Psst, psst!

1082
01:07:17,893 --> 01:07:20,937
Come on! No! Jinx, come here! Jinxy!

1083
01:07:21,021 --> 01:07:22,689
Mew, mew, mew.

1084
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:26,735
No! No! Jinx! Shit!

1085
01:07:26,818 --> 01:07:31,157
Greg didn't ace his med school
Boards. He never even took the MCATs.

1086
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,036
Oh, Jack, that's what you had
your sources check out?

1087
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,955
What this poor boy did
on some test scores?

1088
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:40,917
I bet he doesn't
have a real nursing degree.

1089
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,213
A lot of these hospital workers
are pill poppers looking for 'ludes.

1090
01:07:45,296 --> 01:07:47,757
We know he's been puffing
the magic dragon.

1091
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,134
I knew the little cracker was lying.

1092
01:07:51,219 --> 01:07:53,346
Jinxy! Come here.

1093
01:07:53,429 --> 01:07:55,348
Come here, little Jinxy.

1094
01:08:01,312 --> 01:08:03,189
# Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat

1095
01:08:03,272 --> 01:08:05,024
# I won't hurt you #

1096
01:08:09,904 --> 01:08:12,073
The fact is, Greg lied to you.

1097
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,367
He did not lie to me, Dad!

1098
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:18,246
You should know the truth. I love you
too much to see you get hurt.

1099
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:21,207
I don't care what
your information says,

1100
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:23,334
Greg took the MCATs, OK?

1101
01:09:28,734 --> 01:09:31,403
Shit!

1102
01:10:06,397 --> 01:10:08,107
Oh, my God!

1103
01:10:08,191 --> 01:10:10,777
All right, all right, stand back!

1104
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,072
Stay back. Call 911.

1105
01:10:28,002 --> 01:10:30,922
Jinxy. Jinxy!

1106
01:10:31,005 --> 01:10:34,300
We checked every yard,
nobody's seen him.

1107
01:10:34,384 --> 01:10:36,427
He's not up in the trees.

1108
01:10:36,511 --> 01:10:40,140
- Jinx isn't up here.
- The neighbours haven't seen him.

1109
01:10:40,224 --> 01:10:43,435
You tried to milk him,
you son of a bitch!

1110
01:10:44,562 --> 01:10:46,522
Dad, stop it! That's enough!

1111
01:10:46,605 --> 01:10:48,315
Please calm down.

1112
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:52,444
How? 15 minutes to go
and the ring bearer's missing.

1113
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:55,656
- The ring bearer?
- Your daddy didn't tell you?

1114
01:10:55,739 --> 01:10:59,159
He taught Jinx to walk down
the aisle with this little pillow.

1115
01:10:59,243 --> 01:11:01,120
Oh, no, no, you didn't, Dad.

1116
01:11:01,203 --> 01:11:05,749
Yeah, you put this around the neck
and the ribbons are for the rings.

1117
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:07,710
Oh, for Christ's sakes!

1118
01:11:07,793 --> 01:11:10,754
- Oh, Dad.
- Now we can't have the rehearsal.

1119
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:13,632
Bob, you ride with me.
Larry, come with your car.

1120
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:19,221
If we're not back in an hour,
we'll reschedule for the morning.

1121
01:11:19,305 --> 01:11:23,100
No! We cannot cancel the rehearsal
for some stupid cat.

1122
01:11:23,183 --> 01:11:27,396
How could you say that? That cat's
been like a brother to you!

1123
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:31,775
We just let him wander the streets
without food, water or toilet?

1124
01:11:33,444 --> 01:11:36,196
- Dad, Greg'll find him.
- What?

1125
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,406
Yeah, what?

1126
01:11:37,489 --> 01:11:39,074
That's wonderful.

1127
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,787
Fine.

1128
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:45,665
Fine. OK. Denny? Denny? Denny!

1129
01:11:45,749 --> 01:11:46,958
Dad, I'm here.

1130
01:11:47,042 --> 01:11:50,003
Oh, OK.
You'll be the ring bearer for now.

1131
01:11:50,086 --> 01:11:52,714
I'm not wearing that stupid pillow
on my head.

1132
01:11:52,797 --> 01:11:54,883
Oh, yes, you damn well will!

1133
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,053
Jinx!

1134
01:11:59,179 --> 01:12:01,556
Jinx! Come on, Jinx.

1135
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,560
"Let him wander the streets
without food, water or toilet...

1136
01:12:05,644 --> 01:12:07,270
"Focker"!

1137
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:11,107
Actually, you may be in luck.

1138
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:14,361
They brought in a Himalayan
a little while ago.

1139
01:12:15,195 --> 01:12:17,113
There he is.

1140
01:12:17,948 --> 01:12:19,866
Holy shit! That's Jinx!

1141
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:22,994
- Jinxy...
- Uh, let me see that photo again.

1142
01:12:23,078 --> 01:12:25,372
Picture him without the stupid cap.

1143
01:12:25,455 --> 01:12:27,165
Jinxy! Jinxy!

1144
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:28,667
Uh, no.

1145
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:33,380
You see, in the picture
your cat has an all black tail,

1146
01:12:33,463 --> 01:12:36,466
and this one has a white tip.

1147
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:39,427
No, I'm sorry about that, chief.

1148
01:12:40,512 --> 01:12:42,556
Looks just like him.

1149
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:45,475
Almost. Except for that tail.

1150
01:12:57,196 --> 01:12:59,323
Dearly beloved...

1151
01:13:02,451 --> 01:13:04,829
Dearly beloved!

1152
01:13:04,912 --> 01:13:10,293
We are gathered here today
to join Dr Robert Banks...

1153
01:13:13,462 --> 01:13:14,964
Dearly beloved!

1154
01:13:15,047 --> 01:13:18,551
We are gathered here
on this beautiful day to join...

1155
01:13:21,429 --> 01:13:23,306
...in holy matrimony.

1156
01:13:23,389 --> 01:13:25,725
This is a special day...

1157
01:13:50,209 --> 01:13:52,336
He found him!

1158
01:13:53,378 --> 01:13:55,255
It's him!

1159
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:01,720
Oh, Daddy, it's Jinx!

1160
01:14:01,803 --> 01:14:03,555
My little baby!

1161
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,974
We found you!
We found you!

1162
01:14:06,058 --> 01:14:07,976
This is great!

1163
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:12,022
- Way to go, Greg!
- Gave us a little scare, huh?

1164
01:14:12,105 --> 01:14:14,942
Jinxy!

1165
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:25,994
# Oh, for once in my life

1166
01:14:26,078 --> 01:14:29,456
# I got someone who needs me... #

1167
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,749
To Greg!

1168
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:32,709
To Greg!

1169
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:35,963
- Where is Greg?
- In the rest room.

1170
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:39,550
Yes, I've tried every shelter
in the north shore.

1171
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:44,054
He's a brown and black Himalayan
with an all black tail.

1172
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,723
Mr Jinx.

1173
01:14:46,807 --> 01:14:49,726
Yeah, you check. I'll call back.

1174
01:14:51,478 --> 01:14:54,482
Hey, it's the man of the hour.

1175
01:14:54,566 --> 01:14:58,194
Sorry, folks. Had to pay
a visit to the urinal fairy.

1176
01:15:03,533 --> 01:15:06,661
Greg, nice work with the cat today.

1177
01:15:06,744 --> 01:15:08,580
Thanks, Jack. Glad I could help.

1178
01:15:08,663 --> 01:15:12,250
Hey, we never did finish
that little convo in the den.

1179
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:15,837
So there is still something
I'd like to talk about.

1180
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,173
We'll get right to it
as soon as we get back.

1181
01:15:19,257 --> 01:15:21,843
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Circle of Trust.

1182
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:25,013
Guess who's back in
the Circle of Trust?

1183
01:15:54,626 --> 01:15:56,879
Oh, poor Kevin looks lonely.

1184
01:15:57,671 --> 01:16:00,758
I should ask him to dance.
What do you think?

1185
01:16:00,841 --> 01:16:05,638
Sure. He could, uh, whittle
a private dance floor for you two.

1186
01:16:05,721 --> 01:16:08,766
I'm serious.
I saw some beechwood outside.

1187
01:16:08,849 --> 01:16:11,936
He's very handy.
He's an extremely handy...

1188
01:16:12,019 --> 01:16:14,647
and crafty craftsman.

1189
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:16,690
I shouldn't say that, but...

1190
01:16:16,774 --> 01:16:21,654
Come on, seriously. Part of you
wishes you ended up with him.

1191
01:16:21,737 --> 01:16:24,198
Yes, he's very talented.

1192
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:26,825
But it would have never worked out.

1193
01:16:26,909 --> 01:16:28,786
Why not?

1194
01:16:28,869 --> 01:16:31,330
I was never in love with Kevin.

1195
01:16:35,584 --> 01:16:37,878
I'm in love with you.

1196
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:42,049
- That's a good explanation.
- Think so?

1197
01:16:42,132 --> 01:16:44,009
- Thought you'd like that.
- I do.

1198
01:16:44,093 --> 01:16:45,719
I'm glad.

1199
01:16:47,471 --> 01:16:51,475
No, Jinx. Mr Jinx.
I called you half an hour ago.

1200
01:16:51,559 --> 01:16:55,437
OK, I already...
I already described it.

1201
01:16:55,521 --> 01:16:56,939
Airline.

1202
01:16:58,607 --> 01:17:01,194
Uh, it's...

1203
01:17:01,278 --> 01:17:02,779
It's... brown...

1204
01:17:02,862 --> 01:17:06,825
With a little bit of black... trim.

1205
01:17:07,951 --> 01:17:09,286
Yes.

1206
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:12,872
'Please enter your four-digit code. '

1207
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:16,793
'Jack, it's Hank from next door.

1208
01:17:16,877 --> 01:17:19,421
'Guess who wandered over here today?

1209
01:17:19,504 --> 01:17:24,134
'Mr Jinx. He's not wearing
his collar, but it's Jinxy.

1210
01:17:24,217 --> 01:17:27,429
'So just give me a jingle
when you guys get home,

1211
01:17:27,512 --> 01:17:29,681
'and I'll bring the rascal over. '

1212
01:17:29,764 --> 01:17:34,436
OK, just, uh, keep checking, please,
and I'll call back. Thanks.

1213
01:17:35,937 --> 01:17:38,732
- Any luck?
- No, they're still looking.

1214
01:17:38,815 --> 01:17:40,775
Jack, this is a great party.

1215
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:45,989
Sometimes things just come together
in their own... kookie sort of way.

1216
01:17:46,072 --> 01:17:50,744
Yeah. Like the way you found Jinxy
at that animal shelter, huh?

1217
01:17:50,827 --> 01:17:52,954
Yeah-huh. Right.

1218
01:17:53,038 --> 01:17:56,166
- Well, he's home now.
- Yes.

1219
01:17:56,249 --> 01:17:59,211
You know,
something about that ball of fur

1220
01:17:59,294 --> 01:18:01,671
just puts a big smile on my face.

1221
01:18:01,755 --> 01:18:02,964
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1222
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:05,218
You haven't seen his new tricks?

1223
01:18:05,301 --> 01:18:07,386
No.

1224
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:11,224
- Well, I'll show you.
- We don't have to do it tonight.

1225
01:18:11,307 --> 01:18:15,811
- He's probably tired.
- No, he'd like to show you tonight.

1226
01:18:19,232 --> 01:18:21,567
Honey, I'll drive.

1227
01:18:21,651 --> 01:18:24,904
- Hey, Larry, why don't I drive?
- Good idea!

1228
01:18:24,987 --> 01:18:27,823
I've always wanted
to test-drive a Benz.

1229
01:18:27,907 --> 01:18:29,909
Be my guest, Focker.

1230
01:18:30,993 --> 01:18:34,914
- Sweetie, what are you doing?
- Larry said I could drive.

1231
01:18:39,335 --> 01:18:42,213
- Let's go. Hurry, hurry.
- Bye, guys.

1232
01:18:42,296 --> 01:18:46,384
Thanks for driving, Greg.

1233
01:18:47,802 --> 01:18:51,889
- Drives better than a Taurus, huh?
- Yeah.

1234
01:18:51,973 --> 01:18:54,892
- Get in the car, honey. Hurry up.
- OK, OK.

1235
01:18:56,811 --> 01:18:59,647
Whoa, Nelly!

1236
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:01,983
Everybody comfortable?

1237
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:07,531
You're a little wild man
at that wheel!

1238
01:19:07,614 --> 01:19:09,825
That's a ride, man!

1239
01:19:09,908 --> 01:19:12,578
Got your seat belts on back there?

1240
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,668
Oh, Jesus, Focker!

1241
01:19:22,588 --> 01:19:26,216
- Jeez, take it easy!
- Benz drives like a dream.

1242
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,093
Don't make it a nightmare.

1243
01:19:30,721 --> 01:19:32,764
Oh, there's Jack.

1244
01:19:35,392 --> 01:19:36,435
Hey, Jackie.

1245
01:19:43,275 --> 01:19:46,028
You wanna play, pops? Let's play.

1246
01:19:49,197 --> 01:19:51,408
OK, now, Greg... Greg?

1247
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,877
Is everything OK, honey?

1248
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,379
Yeah, just trying to make good time.

1249
01:20:05,214 --> 01:20:07,174
What is the matter with you?

1250
01:20:07,257 --> 01:20:10,678
All right,
we're gonna get home, very soon.

1251
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:15,391
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1252
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:18,228
It's not the autobahn! Come on, Greg!

1253
01:20:24,275 --> 01:20:27,070
Maybe you
should drive, honey.

1254
01:20:42,877 --> 01:20:45,588
Oh, no. Oh, no, please.

1255
01:20:47,757 --> 01:20:49,717
- Yes!
- Jack just turned.

1256
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:54,764
You were supposed to make that left
at the light... Focker.

1257
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:57,392
I'm gonna be sick.

1258
01:20:57,475 --> 01:21:00,061
Where is he going?

1259
01:21:00,144 --> 01:21:02,105
Home, home, home.

1260
01:21:02,188 --> 01:21:04,023
What a ride.

1261
01:21:04,107 --> 01:21:07,986
Who gave him the keys?
OK, we're out.

1262
01:21:09,946 --> 01:21:14,660
Does he have a licence?
Yeah, a licence to kill.

1263
01:21:19,748 --> 01:21:22,126
Hey, nice driving, Mario!

1264
01:21:22,209 --> 01:21:24,128
Lunatic. You're a lunatic!

1265
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:26,672
Aw, leave him alone.

1266
01:21:41,353 --> 01:21:43,355
- It's everything!
- The cat!

1267
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:45,900
God damn you, Jinx! I'll get you...!

1268
01:21:45,983 --> 01:21:48,903
Dad! Hey, hey! Dad! Calm down!

1269
01:21:48,986 --> 01:21:50,654
Where's the cat?!

1270
01:21:50,738 --> 01:21:53,949
- Cat got out! Cat got out!
- All right...

1271
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:05,211
You spray-painted his tail to make
him look like Jinxy, didn't you?

1272
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:08,172
What's he talking about?

1273
01:22:08,255 --> 01:22:11,634
Hank Macatee called me
and told me he found Jinxy.

1274
01:22:11,717 --> 01:22:16,513
He put his collar on an impostor,
then spray-painted his tail,

1275
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:19,851
then he tried to beat us back
to get rid of the evidence!

1276
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,229
Oh, no, he...

1277
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,942
Please tell me that's not true, Greg.

1278
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:31,404
It was just a temporary solution
until I could find the real Jinx.

1279
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,077
How could you do something like that?

1280
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,913
I'm sorry.

1281
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:44,251
What are you gonna say next -
that you set Kevin's altar on fire?

1282
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,879
Oh, my God!

1283
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:53,718
Well, it wasn't intentional.
I was... chasing Jinx...

1284
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,972
I had a smoke,
and I think I lit something...

1285
01:22:57,055 --> 01:23:03,186
I don't know. He put so much...
goddam lacquer on that thing.

1286
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,772
It was an accident waiting to happen!

1287
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:08,525
This is very disappointing, Greg.

1288
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:15,657
Get out of my house, Focker,
and take your friend with you.

1289
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:20,287
So you lied about everything?
The cat, the fire...

1290
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,499
- The MCATs...
- I didn't lie about the MCATs.

1291
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:27,169
Pam, don't you see?
Your dad has turned you against me!

1292
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:30,506
I didn't turn her against you.
You did that.

1293
01:23:32,133 --> 01:23:36,095
Jack, you didn't like me
from the second I walked in here!

1294
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:41,225
I'm a very accepting person, Focker.
All I ask for is honesty.

1295
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:44,186
You want honesty?

1296
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:47,148
You wanna talk about
truth and honesty?

1297
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:50,192
OK, let's talk a little operation...

1298
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:52,111
Ko Samui...

1299
01:23:53,154 --> 01:23:55,865
- Jack.
- What's he talking about, Dad?

1300
01:23:55,948 --> 01:24:00,578
I thought there weren't any secrets
inside the Circle of Trust.

1301
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:03,706
- I don't know what you mean.
- You don't, huh?

1302
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:06,125
Cat got your tongue?

1303
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:10,004
Pam, Daddy's planning
a covert operation in Thailand

1304
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:12,298
for the day after the wedding.

1305
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,800
You are?

1306
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:16,677
Round and round we go, Jack.

1307
01:24:16,761 --> 01:24:20,932
They'd love to hear about
your rendezvous in the parking lot,

1308
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:24,770
where the guy gave you
the passports and documents?

1309
01:24:24,853 --> 01:24:27,689
Or your little phone call in Thai?

1310
01:24:27,773 --> 01:24:30,150
Jack can't talk Thai.

1311
01:24:30,234 --> 01:24:34,404
Oh, no, Dina, Jack can talk Thai.
Jack talks Thai very well.

1312
01:24:34,488 --> 01:24:37,532
I'm sorry, Pam,
but your dad is not retired.

1313
01:24:37,616 --> 01:24:40,827
He's still very much in the CIA.

1314
01:24:40,911 --> 01:24:42,746
Daddy?

1315
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:49,086
He... he's right. He's right.
I... I... My... my cover's blown.

1316
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:53,590
I... I am planning a secret operation
the day after the wedding.

1317
01:24:53,674 --> 01:24:55,175
What?

1318
01:24:55,259 --> 01:24:58,011
A surprise honeymoon for Deb and Bob.

1319
01:24:58,095 --> 01:25:01,098
You stupid son of a bitch!
You just blew it!

1320
01:25:01,181 --> 01:25:02,724
What?

1321
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:06,562
Ko Samui's an island
off the coast of Thailand!

1322
01:25:06,645 --> 01:25:09,856
That guy in the parking lot
is my travel agent!

1323
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:12,276
He was giving me their visas!

1324
01:25:13,986 --> 01:25:17,489
Wow, Thailand.
Thanks a lot, JB. That's some...

1325
01:25:17,573 --> 01:25:19,741
Don't mention it. I just...

1326
01:25:19,825 --> 01:25:25,872
You know, if nursing doesn't work
out, you have a career in espionage.

1327
01:25:28,501 --> 01:25:30,128
Thanks, Greg.

1328
01:26:04,162 --> 01:26:07,582
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go to the airport now.

1329
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,255
I guess you're gonna stay here?

1330
01:26:18,301 --> 01:26:19,928
Pam, I...

1331
01:26:29,938 --> 01:26:31,774
It's OK. It's OK.

1332
01:26:51,335 --> 01:26:53,087
Gaylord M. Focker?

1333
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:55,172
"Gaylord"?

1334
01:26:55,256 --> 01:26:57,174
Yeah, that's me.

1335
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,970
- I thought your name was Greg?
- It is.

1336
01:27:01,053 --> 01:27:03,889
- That's not on the form.
- It's my legal name,

1337
01:27:03,973 --> 01:27:06,016
since I was in third grade.

1338
01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:10,062
Whatever.

1339
01:27:12,189 --> 01:27:15,150
Wait, wait, wait.
Your name's Gay Focker?

1340
01:27:20,489 --> 01:27:22,741
- Denny.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1341
01:27:22,825 --> 01:27:25,661
It's not a normal name, you know?

1342
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:07,954
You're in luck. There is room...

1343
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:18,048
And without a Saturday stay-over
that fare difference will be

1344
01:28:18,131 --> 01:28:20,800
$1,137 and 11 cents.

1345
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:27,807
- Did you want me to book this seat?
- OK. All right.

1346
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:31,019
Did you want to check any bags?

1347
01:29:13,437 --> 01:29:16,107
We should be all right
with only one usher.

1348
01:29:17,233 --> 01:29:19,527
I'm not so sure, Jack.

1349
01:29:25,449 --> 01:29:27,827
Thought you might like to see this.

1350
01:29:36,294 --> 01:29:39,714
- How did you get this?
- I have my sources too.

1351
01:29:43,844 --> 01:29:48,265
I called Gaylord -
AKA Greg's parents in Detroit.

1352
01:29:48,348 --> 01:29:51,685
They saved his SATs, too,
in case you're interested.

1353
01:29:51,768 --> 01:29:55,689
Oh, honey, it doesn't matter
if he did well in some test.

1354
01:29:55,772 --> 01:30:00,736
Look at this! He almost destroyed
the wedding because he lied!

1355
01:30:02,237 --> 01:30:04,072
I love you, Daddy...

1356
01:30:05,157 --> 01:30:07,618
but you can be a real jerk sometimes.

1357
01:30:10,954 --> 01:30:15,250
So what if he took the MCATs?
He's still not good enough for Pam.

1358
01:30:15,334 --> 01:30:17,085
Who is, Jack?

1359
01:30:17,169 --> 01:30:21,048
Nobody has ever been good enough
for your Pam.

1360
01:30:25,135 --> 01:30:29,264
I mean, do you realise that you
never even warmed up to Kevin

1361
01:30:29,348 --> 01:30:31,308
until she broke up with him?

1362
01:30:31,391 --> 01:30:34,937
Maybe it's time to think
about what Pam wants.

1363
01:30:49,661 --> 01:30:51,496
Greg, it's me.

1364
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:53,790
I'm sure you're in the air by now,

1365
01:30:53,873 --> 01:30:58,169
so, um, I guess you'll get this
when you get home.

1366
01:31:00,797 --> 01:31:02,632
Listen, I am so sorry.

1367
01:31:03,675 --> 01:31:06,302
I acted like
a complete idiot, and...

1368
01:31:06,386 --> 01:31:08,763
And I hope that you can forgive me.

1369
01:31:08,846 --> 01:31:11,891
I mean, I... I don't care about...

1370
01:31:11,975 --> 01:31:15,478
the fire or the cat or...

1371
01:31:15,562 --> 01:31:20,024
I mean, I can't believe you
actually... spray-painted a cat...

1372
01:31:20,108 --> 01:31:22,360
It's actually really gross.

1373
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:24,696
But the point is that...

1374
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:28,741
that I understand
why you did it, and...

1375
01:31:28,825 --> 01:31:31,077
and I love you.

1376
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:36,082
I want you to know that I really,
I really, really love you and...

1377
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:41,879
So when you get this,
will you please call me?

1378
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:44,382
OK, bye.

1379
01:31:50,139 --> 01:31:54,894
I need a commercial flight ID scan.
New York, La Guardia to Chicago.

1380
01:31:54,977 --> 01:31:56,854
Four-hour sweeps,

1381
01:31:56,937 --> 01:32:00,858
last name Foxtrot-Oscar-
Charlie-Kilo-Echo-Romeo,

1382
01:32:00,941 --> 01:32:03,527
first name Golf-Alpha-Yankee...

1383
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:07,990
'Gaylord Focker, Atlantic American
flight 27. Departs 2:35.'

1384
01:32:08,073 --> 01:32:09,867
- 2:35?
- 'Affirmative. '

1385
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:11,994
23 minutes. Thanks.

1386
01:32:12,077 --> 01:32:13,954
Enjoy your flight.

1387
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:16,457
Hello.

1388
01:32:18,459 --> 01:32:22,796
Sorry, we're only boarding rows
nine and above. You'll have to wait.

1389
01:32:23,756 --> 01:32:25,758
I'm in row eight.

1390
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:27,927
Please step aside, sir.

1391
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:30,095
It's one row. Is it OK if I...?

1392
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:32,806
We'll call your row momentarily.

1393
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:36,227
Step aside, sir.

1394
01:32:59,793 --> 01:33:02,254
Thank you for waiting.

1395
01:33:02,337 --> 01:33:06,967
We're now boarding all rows, please.
All remaining rows.

1396
01:33:14,766 --> 01:33:16,142
Oh. Hello.

1397
01:33:18,353 --> 01:33:20,814
Mm-hm. Enjoy your flight.

1398
01:33:36,413 --> 01:33:38,039
Excuse me.

1399
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:42,294
OK, where's the fire, huh?

1400
01:33:49,926 --> 01:33:52,679
- Sir, you'll have to check that.
- I got it.

1401
01:33:52,762 --> 01:33:56,434
- No, sorry, that bag won't fit.
- I'm not checking my bag.

1402
01:33:56,517 --> 01:33:58,269
Don't raise your voice, sir.

1403
01:33:58,352 --> 01:34:01,480
I'm not raising my voice.
This would be raising my voice!

1404
01:34:01,564 --> 01:34:03,399
I don't wanna check my bag.

1405
01:34:03,482 --> 01:34:06,611
And your airline,
you suck at checking bags.

1406
01:34:06,694 --> 01:34:11,073
I did that once and you lost it,
and everything screwed up for me.

1407
01:34:11,157 --> 01:34:15,202
I assure you your bag will be placed
safely below with the other luggage.

1408
01:34:15,286 --> 01:34:18,456
Oh, yeah? How do you know
my bag is safe below?

1409
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:20,958
Are you gonna take my bag
and put it there?

1410
01:34:21,042 --> 01:34:24,378
Are you gonna go with the guys with
the earmuffs and put it there?

1411
01:34:24,462 --> 01:34:27,548
- No.
- OK, then shut your pie hole

1412
01:34:27,632 --> 01:34:29,425
and listen to me when I say

1413
01:34:29,508 --> 01:34:34,180
that I am finished with the
checking-of-the-bags conversation!

1414
01:34:34,263 --> 01:34:36,432
Sir, if a bag is this large...

1415
01:34:36,515 --> 01:34:40,728
OK, you know what? Get your
grubby little paws off of my bag!

1416
01:34:40,811 --> 01:34:44,065
It's not like I have a bomb
to blow up the plane.

1417
01:34:44,148 --> 01:34:47,443
I just want to stow my bag
according to regulations!

1418
01:34:47,526 --> 01:34:48,527
Sir! Sir!

1419
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:52,823
If you would take the sticks
out of your head you would see

1420
01:34:52,907 --> 01:34:56,077
that all I have to do
is do what I wanna do,

1421
01:34:56,160 --> 01:35:00,082
and all I wanna do is hold on
to my bag and not listen to you.

1422
01:35:00,165 --> 01:35:02,376
The only way I would let go

1423
01:35:02,459 --> 01:35:06,338
would be if you tried to pry it
from my dead, lifeless fingers, OK?

1424
01:35:06,421 --> 01:35:10,759
If you can get it from my
kung-fu grip, then you can have it.

1425
01:35:10,842 --> 01:35:13,011
Otherwise, step off, bitch!

1426
01:35:15,055 --> 01:35:17,307
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1427
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:20,477
Keep your...

1428
01:35:26,483 --> 01:35:29,778
Hey! You can't leave
your vehicle unattended!

1429
01:35:29,861 --> 01:35:31,446
So tow it.

1430
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:33,991
You threatened that stewardess.

1431
01:35:34,074 --> 01:35:37,869
I was just trying to get my bag
into the overhead storage thing!

1432
01:35:37,953 --> 01:35:41,832
- You threatened her with a bomb!
- I said I didn't have a bomb!

1433
01:35:41,915 --> 01:35:44,251
- You said bomb.
- I said I didn't have a bomb.

1434
01:35:44,334 --> 01:35:47,504
- You said bomb on an aeroplane
- What's wrong with that?

1435
01:35:47,588 --> 01:35:49,172
You can't say "bomb" on aeroplanes.

1436
01:35:49,256 --> 01:35:50,757
Bomb, bomb, bomb.
Bomb, bomb, bomb-bomb.

1437
01:35:52,676 --> 01:35:54,970
- Arrest me!
- Assaulting an...

1438
01:35:55,053 --> 01:35:58,181
What if I was a bombardier?

1439
01:35:59,558 --> 01:36:01,143
Norm.

1440
01:36:01,226 --> 01:36:04,397
Take five. We got a specialist.

1441
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,648
Bye, Norm.

1442
01:36:11,446 --> 01:36:14,532
Oh, shit. How'd you get here?

1443
01:36:14,616 --> 01:36:16,659
I'm everywhere, Focker.

1444
01:36:16,743 --> 01:36:19,871
- I didn't do anything, Jack.
- Yeah, I know.

1445
01:36:19,954 --> 01:36:23,082
Then tell these guys
that I'm not a terrorist.

1446
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:27,170
I'm not telling anyone anything
until you answer some questions.

1447
01:36:27,253 --> 01:36:31,299
Unless you wanna go to prison,
you better tell me the truth.

1448
01:36:31,382 --> 01:36:34,177
No more lies, understand?
No more lies.

1449
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:36,971
- Did you do this?
- Answer the question.

1450
01:36:37,055 --> 01:36:41,434
- Did you get me taken off the plane?
- Put your hands over there.

1451
01:36:41,517 --> 01:36:43,436
You're sick, you know that?

1452
01:36:46,648 --> 01:36:49,609
Is your name Gaylord Focker?
Yes or no.

1453
01:36:49,692 --> 01:36:51,069
Yes.

1454
01:36:51,152 --> 01:36:53,988
- Are you a male nurse?
- Yes.

1455
01:36:54,072 --> 01:36:55,949
- Are you a pot head?
- No.

1456
01:36:56,032 --> 01:36:58,326
- Have you ever smoked pot?
- Yes.

1457
01:36:58,409 --> 01:37:02,830
Did you spray-paint the tail of a cat
to pass him off as Mr Jinx?

1458
01:37:02,914 --> 01:37:04,624
Yes.

1459
01:37:04,707 --> 01:37:06,794
Because you were seeking my approval?

1460
01:37:06,877 --> 01:37:08,045
Yes.

1461
01:37:08,128 --> 01:37:10,839
- Because you love Pam?
- Yes.

1462
01:37:10,923 --> 01:37:12,675
Do you want to marry her?

1463
01:37:14,385 --> 01:37:16,637
Do you want to marry her?

1464
01:37:18,931 --> 01:37:20,683
I did.

1465
01:37:20,766 --> 01:37:22,810
Till I met you.

1466
01:37:22,893 --> 01:37:25,104
What does that mean?

1467
01:37:25,187 --> 01:37:28,816
I love your daughter.
I love her more than anything.

1468
01:37:28,899 --> 01:37:33,237
But frankly, sir, I'm terrified
of being your son-in-law.

1469
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:38,909
This weekend has made me doubt that
I could even survive in your family.

1470
01:37:42,538 --> 01:37:45,332
I think you've got
some serious issues.

1471
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:50,629
If I lighten up, would you
consider marrying my daughter?

1472
01:37:50,713 --> 01:37:52,673
Would you lighten up a lot?

1473
01:37:54,174 --> 01:37:56,135
- Y...
- Yes or no?

1474
01:37:56,218 --> 01:38:00,139
- Yes.
- Would you let us live our lives?

1475
01:38:00,222 --> 01:38:03,142
I promise not
to interfere in your lives.

1476
01:38:03,225 --> 01:38:05,603
Stop making fun of me
for being a nurse?

1477
01:38:05,686 --> 01:38:09,356
Could you at least try
to consider another profession?

1478
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,234
- Jack, yes or no?
- Ever?

1479
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:13,904
- No.
- OK, yes.

1480
01:38:13,987 --> 01:38:18,241
- Let me and Pam sleep together?
- Don't push it, Focker.

1481
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:21,036
You're in a real mess.

1482
01:38:22,495 --> 01:38:26,666
Would you support my daughter
the way she deserves to be?

1483
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,209
Yes.

1484
01:38:28,293 --> 01:38:30,587
Would you be honest and faithful?

1485
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:32,464
Yes.

1486
01:38:32,547 --> 01:38:36,968
Will you devote yourself entirely
to her for the rest of your life?

1487
01:38:37,052 --> 01:38:39,179
Of course.

1488
01:38:40,096 --> 01:38:41,723
Gaylord Focker...

1489
01:38:44,142 --> 01:38:46,186
Will you be my son-in-law?

1490
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:12,003
Greg? I thought you were
going back to Chicago.

1491
01:39:12,087 --> 01:39:14,131
We had a little plane trouble.

1492
01:39:14,215 --> 01:39:17,551
Plus, your dad caught up
with me at the airport.

1493
01:39:17,635 --> 01:39:20,263
Don't... don't worry, it's OK.

1494
01:39:20,346 --> 01:39:22,640
We worked out a lot of our issues.

1495
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:25,851
You and my dad worked out
a lot of your issues?

1496
01:39:25,935 --> 01:39:29,772
He gave me his human lie detector
thing, but I passed.

1497
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:33,442
- Good.
- Yeah.

1498
01:39:33,526 --> 01:39:35,361
And...

1499
01:39:35,444 --> 01:39:37,613
then he proposed.

1500
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:43,286
Are you feeling all right?

1501
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:48,165
Listen...
This weekend was a nightmare.

1502
01:39:48,249 --> 01:39:49,250
Oh.

1503
01:39:49,333 --> 01:39:52,461
I had this elaborate plan,
but somewhere...

1504
01:39:52,545 --> 01:39:56,007
between giving your sister
a black eye and...

1505
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:59,427
setting the house on fire,
it kind of went off track.

1506
01:40:00,553 --> 01:40:02,638
I just... I love you.

1507
01:40:02,722 --> 01:40:05,391
I love you so much.

1508
01:40:05,474 --> 01:40:07,768
I don't know, it makes no sense...

1509
01:40:07,852 --> 01:40:09,896
I think he's about to do it.

1510
01:40:09,979 --> 01:40:13,232
Come on, honey.
Give 'em some privacy.

1511
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:19,740
And if we can get through... what we
got through in the last 48 hours,

1512
01:40:19,823 --> 01:40:21,909
we could get through anything.

1513
01:40:22,993 --> 01:40:24,703
I think so, too.

1514
01:40:24,786 --> 01:40:27,331
- And I don't...
- Wait, hang on a sec.

1515
01:40:27,414 --> 01:40:29,041
Mr Jinx.

1516
01:40:29,124 --> 01:40:31,585
Mew mew mew mew. Mew mew mew mew.

1517
01:40:34,755 --> 01:40:37,049
Hi, Jinx...

1518
01:40:38,717 --> 01:40:40,552
It's a ring.

1519
01:40:41,803 --> 01:40:45,849
I like to think of it
as a little circle of trust.

1520
01:40:47,893 --> 01:40:49,728
Pam...

1521
01:40:50,896 --> 01:40:52,189
Will you marry me?

1522
01:40:52,272 --> 01:40:53,690
Yes!

1523
01:40:54,608 --> 01:40:56,026
Yes!

1524
01:40:58,028 --> 01:40:59,821
Yes!

1525
01:41:00,322 --> 01:41:02,115
Yes!

1526
01:41:02,741 --> 01:41:05,160
Attaboy, Greg.

1527
01:41:06,119 --> 01:41:09,164
That "circle of trust" thing,
that's mine.

1528
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:15,587
Well, looks like we've got
another wedding to plan.

1529
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:17,965
Yup. Just got to do one more thing.

1530
01:41:18,048 --> 01:41:20,467
- What's that?
- Meet his parents.

1531
01:41:21,511 --> 01:41:23,555
- Jack...
- Honey, relax.

1532
01:41:23,638 --> 01:41:26,432
I'm sure they're wonderful,
fascinating people.

1533
01:41:26,516 --> 01:41:28,142
Good night, Jack.

1534
01:41:36,276 --> 01:41:40,989
I mean, they'd have to be, right?
To name their son Gaylord Focker?

1535
01:41:43,116 --> 01:41:47,537
Do you, Deborah Byrnes, take Robert
Banks to be your wedded husband?

1536
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,330
Yes! I mean, I do!

1537
01:41:49,414 --> 01:41:51,624
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1538
01:42:08,308 --> 01:42:12,437
Let's just see if you really can
flush the toilet, Jinxy.

1539
01:42:37,922 --> 01:42:39,798
I knew it.

1540
01:42:39,882 --> 01:42:41,717
'Oh! Shit! '

1541
01:42:42,801 --> 01:42:44,428
I knew it.

1542
01:42:44,511 --> 01:42:45,804
'Damn! '

1543
01:42:53,062 --> 01:42:56,523
That's my future son-in-law.
What do you think?

1544
01:42:56,607 --> 01:42:58,734
'Hello, Jack.

1545
01:42:58,817 --> 01:43:01,779
'Aw, look at that. Nice, Jack. Hi.

1546
01:43:01,862 --> 01:43:03,781
'What's that, Jack? What?

1547
01:43:03,864 --> 01:43:06,075
'You're a big, fat, CIA man, huh?

1548
01:43:06,158 --> 01:43:09,787
'Did they teach you THAT...?
They teach you THAT?

1549
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:11,997
'Oh, yeah, what's that, Jack?

1550
01:43:12,081 --> 01:43:16,377
'You thought "Puff" was just the
