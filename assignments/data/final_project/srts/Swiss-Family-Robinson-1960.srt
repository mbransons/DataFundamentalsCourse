1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,276
Help!

2
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,351
Get us out of here!

3
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,990
Help!

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,755
Help! Get us out of here!
We're trapped.

5
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,193
Somebody get us out! Help!

6
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,592
What happened?

7
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,354
- She's hit something.
- Have mercy.

8
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,156
I can't get it open. It's jammed.

9
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,428
You first, Fritz.

10
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,519
Ernst, help your mother.

11
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,315
Captain Wilhelm? Anybody here?

12
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,992
Anyone there, Fritz?

13
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,358
If anybody was here, they'd have
heard us long before this.

14
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,954
As I said,
if they've abandoned the ship,

15
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,874
they've got no claim.
It's ours, by maritime law.

16
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,159
They wouldn't leave us here.
Something must have happened.

17
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,109
They thought the ship was going to
sink. It was every man for himself.

18
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,829
It was carrying too much sail. The
captain and the mate argued about it.

19
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,913
I'd have fought the pirates
instead of running into the storm.

20
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,149
Alright, Mother.

21
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,791
What a mess!

22
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,671
- At least we're not far from land.
- Then there's hope.

23
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,994
Maybe when we get to shore we can
get help. Make her sail again.

24
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,990
She'll never sail again.

25
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,192
We could build a raft.
We've got enough wood.

26
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,511
Fritz is right.
The sooner we get ashore, the better.

27
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Look what I found!

28
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,077
- Look.
- Those poor things!

29
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,596
They must have had a worse time
than we did.

30
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,988
How's it look?
Are we solid on the rocks?

31
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,235
I don't know. No, I'd say we're here
until the turning of the tide.

32
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,471
Help me, somebody! Help!

33
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,831
No!

34
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,393
Look what I found. The captain's
dogs. And are they glad to see me!

35
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,714
- He's alright.
- Better make a start. Come on.

36
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,631
Give me a hand.

37
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,552
If it's deserted I can work out where
we are when I learn how to use this.

38
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,958
Alright, take it along.

39
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,678
- It still works!
- There's no time for that.

40
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,239
- Let's put up a distress flag.
- We don't look distressed enough?

41
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,876
Anyone who sees a ship stuck on the
rocks might guess it's in trouble.

42
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,234
Now, you look after them, Turk.
You too, Duke.

43
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,993
- How can we take all these animals?
- We're not taking them.

44
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,119
- If we leave them they'll die!
- When we're safe on land

45
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,636
then you can talk to me
about the animals. Not before.

46
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,832
Francis, get them out of there!
We don't want this one or that.

47
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,835
- Wait a minute!
- Or that. We don't want any of them.

48
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,110
Right, Fritz.
Put it over your head. That's it.

49
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,196
- Alright, I'm fine.
- Grip the rope here.

50
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,157
- Alright?
- Come on, Mother. We'll catch you.

51
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,310
- Don't worry.
- Right, Fritz.

52
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,308
- Come on.
- Now.

53
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,870
- Sorry, Mother.
- Are you alright?

54
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,709
Fritz, the dogs!
He forgot the dogs.

55
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,836
They're not coming. Cast off.

56
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,309
They're my dogs! I found them!

57
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,911
Sit down. They weigh more
than any of us. We'd sink in no time.

58
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,671
Alright, Fritz? Right.
Watch that wreckage.

59
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,154
The dogs are going to swim it.

60
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,150
Come on, Duke. Come on, Turk.
You can make it. Keep swimming.

61
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,949
Straight between those rocks.
That side.

62
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,713
No, come and help me push over here.

63
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,231
Come on, boys, you can make it!
Keep swimming.

64
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,079
- Watch those rocks.
- Your side, Ernst. Push off!

65
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,590
Come on, Turk! Come on, Duke!

66
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,718
Look out!

67
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,798
Do something. They'll drown!

68
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,110
We can't take any more chances.

69
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,475
Look!

70
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,677
Come on, boy.

71
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,875
- Good boy, Turk. Well done.
- Keep them in the middle.

72
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,351
- That's right. In the centre.
- You see? They didn't sink us.

73
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,313
Let's get to shore.

74
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,518
I wouldn't dare pray for any more
miracles, not in one day.

75
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,599
Turk, Duke, wait. I'm coming too.
Wait for me!

76
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,797
- Francis, stay in your tub.
- I'm coming!

77
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,034
- Come back!
- Tie it round the tree stump.

78
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,271
Come on, let's go.

79
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,635
Francis, come back here.

80
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,151
See you later.

81
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,788
First thing we'd better do is
unload the raft. Then...

82
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,759
...put up some sort of
shelter for the night.

83
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,911
Not the first thing.

84
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,874
Fritz. No, hold it, Fritz.

85
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,033
- We are not making any progress.
- I know.

86
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,271
It's got to hang down even
on both sides.

87
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,239
- Aren't very good.
- We're lucky to have them.

88
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,551
- Pull your side down.
- Right, I've got my side.

89
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,793
Hold it down, Fritz.

90
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,878
Come on.

91
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,629
You're very lucky to have them.

92
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,396
I think tomorrow, if the ship's still
there, you and I, and maybe Ernst,

93
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,948
ought to try
and bring in the animals

94
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,193
and anything else we might need.

95
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,796
- How long will we have to stay here?
- I don't know. I just...

96
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,592
I just think we ought to do
everything we can.

97
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,672
What's going on?

98
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,592
Powder was wet.

99
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,193
Aren't you coming to bed?

100
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,630
You have to have some sleep.

101
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,515
- Besides, it's going to rain.
- No, I'm alright.

102
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,271
No-one can go back
and undo what's already done but...

103
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,873
Well, I... want you to know that...

104
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,115
...l'm sorry things didn't work out
the way I wanted them to.

105
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,232
I know.

106
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,108
It would have been better
if we'd just stayed in Bern.

107
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,710
I'm not so sure. Not with Napoleon
trying to grab up more and more.

108
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,874
Fritz and Ernst might both
be in a war. Maybe even you.

109
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:49,399
No. Better to stay and face things
rather than just running away.

110
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,436
Is it running away to try to find
a new life in a new colony?

111
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,314
Try to give our sons a chance
to live, a chance to be free?

112
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,675
Is that running away?

113
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,594
I keep thinking about all the men
in those other offices

114
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,879
along the Marktgasse. They go on
working at the same old jobs

115
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,509
and manage to find opportunities
for their families,

116
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,115
without running off
to the other side of the world.

117
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,915
We settled all this
before we left home.

118
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,314
It was a good thing we set out to do.

119
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,473
We were right. Nothing has changed
just because we were shipwrecked.

120
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,199
You're always right, aren't you?

121
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,430
We'll get there. I'm sure of it.

122
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,996
Sooner or later
there'll be a ship.

123
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,399
I'll pray for it
with every breath I take.

124
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,837
It's a big land, New Guinea.

125
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,352
For hundreds of years
there'll be new colonies,

126
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,590
a great new world to build.

127
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,156
No limit to what a man can do.

128
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,079
If we're a couple of months
late getting there, it won't matter.

129
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,193
We're not too badly off, are we?
We've got each other, the family,

130
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,238
- food to eat.
- Even a tent to keep the rain off,

131
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,118
if we had sense enough to use it.

132
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,755
Now don't worry. Try to go back to
sleep.

133
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,554
I'm soaked!

134
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,716
- Having trouble?
- I'll get it down,

135
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,791
but it may take a while.

136
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,232
Easy.

137
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,189
Wait a minute. Hold him.

138
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,717
Easy!

139
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,837
I keep trying to tell her
it's for her own good.

140
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,235
A ship! There's a ship!

141
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,836
Ahoy! Ahoy there!
I think they've seen us.

142
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,871
Take a look, Fritz.

143
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,312
- There's something on the sail...
- I knew it.

144
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,952
It's the pirate ship that chased us
into the storm. Get down!

145
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,555
And I deliberately tried
to get their attention.

146
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,154
This time we have a weapon.

147
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,233
- Do you know how to fire it?
- I think so. Let's pull it back.

148
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,838
I'll get a keg of powder. See if you
can find some rags, for wadding.

149
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,830
I know. I'll be right back.

150
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,316
We'll only have one shot. Let's wait
until we can't possibly miss.

151
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,155
- What's happening?
- They're going away.

152
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,358
Did they see us loading
the cannon and get scared?

153
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,515
Pirates scared off by one cannon
and three people?

154
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,875
Do you know what they're up to?

155
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,919
What's that?

156
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,278
A quarantine flag,
warning there's Black Death aboard.

157
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,237
How did you know that?

158
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,471
Well, I do a bit of reading too.
Come on, Fritz.

159
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,034
- Pull those new lines tight.
- Right.

160
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,236
Yes, that's it. There.

161
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,070
No! What's the matter with you?

162
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,553
Not that way, stupid. This way.

163
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,116
- Maybe it's too much for one trip.
- We had to try.

164
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,791
Sharks!

165
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,913
- You got one!
- Watch that one coming in.

166
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,914
- There's another one.
- I'll get it.

167
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,717
- I hit it!
- Here comes another one!

168
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,311
Get out of here!

169
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,754
Got one.

170
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,030
Look out, Ernst, there's another.

171
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,193
- No, it's a turtle.
- We disturbed him with our shots.

172
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,993
I think we scared them away.

173
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,115
It's pulling us!

174
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,235
Better to use your head
than break your back, I always say.

175
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,749
Francis, see if you can find the...

176
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,673
Where are you?

177
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,791
Here, Duke, Turk. Here, boys.

178
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,955
Where's Francis? Go find him.

179
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,070
Now you wait just one minute and I'll
have some sugarcane for you.

180
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,070
Now, come along, little fella.
I won't hurt you.

181
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,591
Now, just let me fix this.

182
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,159
Here, little elephant. Come here.
That's right.

183
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,153
Come on, little elephant.
I wouldn't hurt you.

184
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,358
Come on, little fella.
I wouldn't hurt you.

185
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,478
I have some nice fresh sugarcane
for you.

186
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,949
Come on.

187
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,953
Come on. Just a little closer.
That's right.

188
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,911
Come on, little fella.

189
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,156
Francis, where are you?

190
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,470
Now you just put your foot...
right there.

191
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,837
Come on, little elephant.

192
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,711
A little closer.
Just a little bit closer.

193
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,631
Right...

194
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,910
Now stop pulling!

195
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,312
What's the matter?

196
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,391
You get out of here!

197
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,198
Francis, where are you?

198
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,193
You get away from my elephant.
Get out. He's my elephant.

199
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,516
Duke, Turk, come on!
You bit him enough.

200
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,598
Good old Duke.

201
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,194
Did I tell you
you could leave the beach?

202
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,193
You might have been eaten, wandering
off that way!

203
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,316
What do you have to say
for yourself?

204
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,871
- I'm sorry but...
- But what?

205
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,350
Can I keep the baby elephant,
anyhow?

206
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,672
Now I'll keep you.

207
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,111
Come on, Rocky, get going.

208
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,676
Alright, Francis, hold it.

209
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,471
Slack off a bit.

210
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,751
Come on, Rocky, back up.
Good little fella, back up.

211
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,554
- Right.
- Hold it.

212
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,795
- That was a good idea, Ernst.
- Thanks, Fritz.

213
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,511
Come on.

214
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,830
Fritz, no more full planks,
just some odds and ends.

215
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,399
I think we've got enough.

216
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,270
Well? What do you think of it?

217
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,353
I'd like it a lot better if I knew
tigers couldn't climb trees.

218
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,079
They won't climb this one.

219
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,596
You probably won't have seen
such a house.

220
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,079
I'm sure of that.

221
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,154
The world is full
of nice, ordinary little people

222
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,552
who live in nice, ordinary
little houses on the ground.

223
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,438
But didn't you ever dream of having
a tree house?

224
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,557
No. Mostly I dream of having a house
in New Guinea.

225
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,719
You think we're going
to be here for a long time.

226
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,597
This I have no way of knowing

227
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,116
but we can't sit on the beach
just waiting for a ship.

228
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,954
- But there could be a ship?
- Of course.

229
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,516
Then I think we ought
to try to light the signal fire.

230
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,639
And just forget about the pirates?

231
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,269
Maybe they won't come back.
Maybe we could get away with it.

232
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,117
We can't chance it. Being alive is
more important than being found.

233
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,077
- Don't look down.
- Alright, Mother. I've got you.

234
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,156
- What do you think?
- Fritz, can I sleep with you?

235
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,630
- What an idea!
- It's not built for two.

236
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,589
- But I'll give you a swing.
- Be careful. Take this rope.

237
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,750
Tie it around his waist.

238
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,989
Mother?

239
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,750
- Getting on, aren't we?
- Yes.

240
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,673
Here, I want to show you something.

241
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,952
Faster!

242
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,829
Look. This is our room.

243
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,956
You won't to get me to go up there,

244
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,160
- not without some sort of railing.
- It'll be like a house, enclosed.

245
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,356
This is your own circular stairway.

246
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,750
Let's go back down
before someone falls off the edge.

247
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,914
- Come on, Francis.
- He'll be alright. I'll go first.

248
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,394
Come on, little fella. I wouldn't
hurt you. I just want to pet you.

249
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,391
Come on.

250
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,155
- Hold him, Ernst.
- I've got him.

251
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,836
- He caught it.
- Are you alright?

252
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,436
Yes. He's my new pet. Don't let him
go.

253
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,229
- Feel his heart beating!
- Mine could match his beat for beat!

254
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,836
Supposing I hadn't insisted that he
had this rope tied around his waist?

255
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,391
Until you get a railing put up,
I don't want Francis back up here.

256
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,597
And I assure you I won't be up here
either!

257
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,751
I'm sorry, dear.
I don't blame you for being upset.

258
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,230
But you don't seem to understand
what we have in mind.

259
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,231
No, but won't you trust us?

260
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,517
Do what you like,
just see Francis is on the ground.

261
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,670
I assure you I won't be back up here.

262
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,990
Alright, we'll do that.

263
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,835
You stay back in camp and when
we've got everything as we want it,

264
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,309
then we'll bring you back,
see how you feel.

265
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,110
Don't you think you can talk to me
like that.

266
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,194
- How much further?
- Hurry! You'll love the new house.

267
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,319
This way, Mother. Wait till you see
what we've done.

268
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,630
There's all sorts of things inside.

269
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,711
You just wait.

270
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,830
- We must be there now.
- Take off the blindfold.

271
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,638
Just a moment, please.
Old Swiss custom.

272
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,188
Carry the bride
across the threshold.

273
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,032
Father!

274
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,509
Duke, Turk, get out of my way.

275
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,477
How's this?

276
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,715
All the latest innovations.
Running water.

277
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,030
Genuine imported tortoiseshell.

278
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,875
And not forgetting the cooler.

279
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,553
This is Ernst's contribution.
He invented it.

280
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,473
He and Fritz built it.
See how it works, Mother? Look.

281
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,120
Big wheel turns the little wheel
up there,

282
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,395
the cup pours the water
into the shell,

283
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,359
it runs down the bamboo
and feeds the sink and the cooler.

284
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,835
I... can't believe it.

285
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,111
Darling, thank you.

286
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,839
I'm second. I go after Mother.

287
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,631
- Thank you.
- Up you go.

288
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,918
Up there's the boys' room.

289
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,672
And look.

290
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,355
This is something I worked out. When
in for the night, turn the wheel,

291
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,431
pull up the stairs.

292
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,675
Keeps out wild animals and neighbours
who may become a nuisance,

293
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,069
always wanting to borrow something.

294
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,674
We'll be troubled so much by them!

295
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,751
Get me down!

296
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,637
Remember this? I built it for us.

297
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,950
Don't tell me, you pull this
to ring for the butler.

298
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,071
Here, I'll show you.

299
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,070
You can lie and look at the stars.

300
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,190
Don't you remember?
That summer we went to Interlaken.

301
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,589
You said that some day,
if you could have your wish,

302
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,309
you'd sleep each night
so you could see the stars.

303
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,317
What is it? What's wrong?

304
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,151
These curtains don't belong here.

305
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,959
They're from the Captain's
cabin. We thought you'd like them.

306
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,668
It's so wonderful. I don't deserve
it. I can't believe it.

307
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,235
Don't worry about the curtains.

308
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,438
If you don't like them, I know
a woman who can fix anything.

309
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,073
Here it is. Tiger.
<i>"Panthera tigris,</i>

310
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,675
a native of Asia,
ranges north to Siberia

311
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,594
and south to India
and the Malay Peninsula."

312
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,875
Only with a land bridge

313
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,953
could there be so many
different animals on one island.

314
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,876
How do you know it's an island?
Why couldn't it be a peninsula?

315
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,276
Well, why don't you let us
try and sail around it?

316
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,590
You know how your mother feels
about that.

317
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,231
I think there used to be a
land bridge between here and Asia.

318
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,833
This is all that's left.

319
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,277
That's why so many different
types of animals are trapped here.

320
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,352
What do you think, Fritz?
Do you agree?

321
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,479
I suppose there could have
been one, a long time ago.

322
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,279
There's only one way to find out.

323
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,193
Ask Mother again.
Maybe she'll change her mind.

324
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,752
Mother wants to get to New Guinea
too. There might be a village

325
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,718
or some place where ships come in.

326
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,191
If the occasion presents itself, I
might bring it up again. What's this?

327
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,398
A spelling competition?
"Tiger, bear, elephant."

328
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,517
That's a list of animals
we've identified so far.

329
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,160
"Hyena, monkey, lizard."

330
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,991
Ostrich.

331
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,391
Help!

332
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,557
- Francis, let go!
- I can't let go

333
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,757
- or he'll get away.
- Let him go anyway. We'll catch him.

334
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,790
- Are you alright?
- Yes, I'm alright.

335
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,552
Are you alright?

336
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,710
Not a mark on him
that won't wash off!

337
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,231
- Grab his neck.
- We can learn to ride him.

338
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,072
Let me try. Help me out.

339
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,039
We'd better get him
trained a bit first.

340
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,395
- Let me try it, then.
- Alright.

341
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,869
I get to try next.

342
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,199
I got it.

343
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,308
You silly...

344
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,438
Here I go.

345
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,118
Look out for that rock.

346
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,799
No, you gotta keep swinging.

347
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,234
Everybody, follow the leader.

348
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,756
Come on, I'll race you down.

349
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,437
Mother, look at me.

350
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,470
- Go on, Father. You can do it.
- Of course I can.

351
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,119
Here I come.

352
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,392
- Where are we going?
- Wait and see.

353
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,113
Come on.

354
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,956
Look at the monkeys. Look.

355
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,679
- What?
- Look at them swinging.

356
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,236
- Look at that.
- I can do that.

357
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,595
- Let's see you try.
- Anyone can change hands.

358
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,991
- Now, steady.
- Go on.

359
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,155
My turn next.

360
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,515
- No, my turn.
- After me.

361
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,709
Are you alright?

362
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,231
Never better. See what I mean?

363
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,317
- You really are very graceful.
- Thank you very much.

364
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,230
Isn't this the kind of life we were
meant to live on this earth?

365
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,834
Everything we need. Everything's
right here, right at our fingertips.

366
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,597
You know, if only people could have
all this and be satisfied,

367
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:36,111
- the world wouldn't have problems.
- Or any future generations.

368
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,674
There isn't everything we need
right at our fingertips.

369
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,433
- Now what are you talking about?
- This.

370
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,389
It's wonderful for today, but what
about tomorrow? And our sons?

371
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,235
- What future is there here for them?
- Tomorrow can take care of itself.

372
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,072
Suppose we never got away?

373
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,630
They'd never know what
it was like to be married.

374
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,393
Yes. Yes, that's right.

375
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,519
Now you come to mention it, there
aren't many girls around here.

376
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,599
It's nothing to joke about.
Suppose they never have a chance

377
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,114
to know what it's like to have a
family?

378
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,992
What you're trying to say is

379
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,072
we ought to make every effort
to get away?

380
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,549
- Exactly.
- Right.

381
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,155
Then I'll tell the boys
they can sail around the coast,

382
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,232
- see what they can find.
- That's not what I said!

383
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,959
Sooner or later
we'll have to face it.

384
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,030
But what do they know about sailing
and outrigging and...

385
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,313
- Do you think it's safe?
- We can't hold on to them forever.

386
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,517
Come on, Rocky,
you can pull it faster.

387
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,631
Come on, pull.

388
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,235
Fritz, grab hold. That's it.

389
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,353
We'll be back soon and maybe
we'll find a ship to take us away.

390
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,431
Don't worry, Mother.

391
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,351
Be careful, Fritz.

392
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,268
Get Rocky clear.

393
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,235
Back up.

394
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,359
Well...

395
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,955
It's going to be up to you,
Fritz. If you run into a storm

396
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,795
or trouble of any kind, I'm relying
on your judgement, your good sense.

397
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,830
Make sure you both get safely back.

398
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,957
Goodbye, Ernst.

399
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,919
- Goodbye. Don't worry.
- Remember to use your head.

400
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,791
Good luck.

401
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,276
Don't worry.
They'll be back before you know it.

402
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,513
I hope we are doing the right thing.
Letting them go.

403
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,318
I'm sure we are.

404
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,949
If we'd let them go sooner we
might be in New Guinea by this time.

405
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,828
- Bye! Bring me back a crocodile!
- Goodbye!

406
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,239
Goodbye.

407
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,437
I wish Mother could see
this place. She'd love it.

408
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,911
You know what I'd like? I'd like to
see some real mountains once again.

409
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,911
Walk the Oberland.

410
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,390
Stand looking up at the Jungfrau
when a storm moves in.

411
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,314
Remember how you could smell
the snow in the air?

412
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,678
Do you ever think about what you'd
be doing if you'd stayed in Bern?

413
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,671
Sometimes.

414
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,194
I think about Herr Kobel,
what he said,

415
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,316
that I should attend the Academy.

416
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,349
- Fine chance you would have had.
- It might have worked out.

417
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,829
I tell you where I'd really like
to be.

418
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,959
Walking down the Nydeggasse,
like on a Sunday after church.

419
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,633
All the girls stroll past
all dressed up.

420
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,952
- Anyone in particular?
- No, nobody special.

421
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,036
Maybe you don't know them
or speak to them,

422
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,829
but you look and they look
and you just know they're there.

423
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,835
Fritz, if we ever get to New Guinea,
will there be any girls our age?

424
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,229
By the time we get to New Guinea
we won't care what age they are!

425
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,954
Ernst, get the sail down. Quick!

426
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,597
- Keep down.
- What's the matter?

427
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,309
- What happened?
- Quick, give me the glass.

428
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,915
There's something moving over there
on the beach.

429
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,471
Pirates.

430
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,473
I'm sure it's the same one we scared
off with the quarantine flag.

431
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,190
Let's sneak in closer. If we stay
behind the rocks they won't see us.

432
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,515
- Ernst, bring the bow round.
- I'm trying.

433
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:30,235
That chest they've opened was my
First Officer's, God rest his soul.

434
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,550
I wish they'd fight
and kill each other.

435
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,317
You let me do any talking.

436
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,512
No! Leave him! Put him down!
Kuala, listen to me!

437
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,310
Little boy, you all alone.

438
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,239
He is 14 years.

439
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,951
Leave him alone.

440
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,635
Leave the boy alone! Kuala, wait!

441
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:18,353
You will want me to write a ransom
note. I write.

442
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,031
My people send money
if you let me go.

443
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,878
You send plenty money,
then you go.

444
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,871
No, wait!

445
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,033
Leave the boy with me
or I not write ransom note.

446
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,509
No boy, no note.

447
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:01,118
I'm sorry, Bertie,
to have got you into this.

448
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,512
We'll... get out of this somehow.

449
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,590
Now keep as still as you can.
You'll only make things worse.

450
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,712
Now they'll decide which crew
is going to take us.

451
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,878
We could sneak in
and free the old man and the boy

452
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,554
before the others knew
what was happening.

453
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,872
Alright.

454
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,549
It's now or never. Come on.

455
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,674
At least I think they'll keep us
together.

456
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,669
- Don't make any noise.
- Who are you?

457
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,874
- Who are you?
- We've come to help you.

458
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,676
- If only we had a knife.
- Quick! Don't bother with me.

459
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,036
Get the boy free first. Go on!

460
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,995
They won't harm me. I'm valuable for
ransom. Get Bertie free.

461
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,951
Get away if you can.

462
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,430
If they ransom me, I'll get a ship
and come back for you.

463
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,431
I won't leave without you.

464
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,911
Get away quickly.
Don't waste time on me. Go on!

465
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,997
- Run!
- No, I won't go!

466
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,789
Go on, leave me!

467
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,869
- Come on.
- I can't go on another step.

468
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,351
In here.

469
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,231
Pirates took your ship?

470
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,231
What were you, cabin boy?

471
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,475
The old gentleman
back there's your grandfather?

472
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,391
Come on.

473
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,472
And who are you anyway?
Where did you come from?

474
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,551
We were shipwrecked. Our ship...

475
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,394
Run.

476
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,668
Come on.

477
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,114
They're leaving.
They're going away.

478
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,517
Could be a trick, so we come back,

479
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,592
like the Greeks
and the Trojan horse.

480
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,196
I think we'll stay here
until daylight.

481
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,348
Probably save time
cutting across the island

482
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,476
instead of going around the beach.

483
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,393
No question about it now,
this is an island.

484
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,870
What about me?
What am I going to do?

485
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,951
I guess you'll come with us.

486
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,918
Right about that direction should
take us home.

487
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,831
But if they release my grandfather
he'll come back here to look for me.

488
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,150
Don't worry. He knows you're with us.

489
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,959
If we're not here,
he'll just sail around the island.

490
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,033
He couldn't get a ship past our
place unseen, even if he wanted to.

491
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,272
- Bertie, you can have the middle.
- Come on.

492
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,033
I'll just sit up. Not sleepy.

493
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,236
Do you imagine we've changed a lot
since we first landed?

494
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,198
- In what way?
- Lots. Like getting stronger,

495
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,272
- more sure of ourselves.
- I suppose so.

496
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,355
When we first came here,
everything scared us.

497
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,830
- All those strange noises.
- How could I forget?

498
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,831
We must have been pretty helpless.

499
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,831
That I'd have to agree with.

500
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,118
Listen. You don't think
we were something like him?

501
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,558
I don't think so.
Did you get a good look at his hands?

502
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,111
I bet he's never done anything.
A wealthy family, an only child.

503
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,509
- Sometime, look at the way he walks.
- I did!

504
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,797
And back home, we used to call
Jean Monteau a sissy.

505
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,119
Remember we were wishing
we could see some girls?

506
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,796
We're so close to getting our wish
but we've still missed it completely!

507
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,790
That direction. That's the way
we've got to go, Fritz.

508
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,395
We'll cross here. Doesn't look
as though it'll be over our heads.

509
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,710
Do we have to cross just here?

510
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,278
It's easy. Take off your clothes,
carry them over your head.

511
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,271
Better than walking in wet clothes.

512
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,510
Just until we've crossed
the deep part.

513
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,672
- I can't swim.
- I don't think you'll have to.

514
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,239
Come on, get started.

515
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,592
I'm going back to the beach
to wait for my grandfather.

516
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,831
- Don't come any closer!
- Are you out of your mind?

517
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,992
- Stay back!
- That's my gun! You can't take it!

518
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,868
Sorry, but I need it more than you.

519
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,077
My grandfather
will make it alright with you.

520
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,515
Wait. You keep his attention.

521
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,195
- I'll slip round behind him.
- I'll keep his attention!

522
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,990
You! Bertie!
Put that down or I'll let this go.

523
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,153
Drop it!

524
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,351
Don't do that, Ernst, I'll shoot!

525
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,437
I don't want to shoot you.
Now put that down!

526
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,555
Let go of me!

527
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,634
Stop it!

528
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,678
I'll teach him to shoot at me!

529
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,278
She didn't mean to fire.

530
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,070
I don't care! I could have been...
What? She didn't?!

531
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:52,195
It's a girl!
Why would a girl dress up like that?

532
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,874
It was because of the pirates.

533
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,399
My grandfather made me cut my hair
and dress like this because...

534
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,069
Because he didn't want them to know.

535
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,473
At least now you can wash your face.

536
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,239
Well, it'll be nice
to be called Roberta again.

537
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:20,108
I'm sorry,
but if we'd known you were a girl

538
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,510
- we wouldn't have...
- We'll try to make it easy for you,

539
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,591
as much as possible.

540
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,471
- Careful.
- Give me your hand.

541
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,471
Thank you.

542
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,279
Careful. Watch your step, Roberta.

543
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,318
Thank you, Fritz.

544
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:06,352
Variations and deviations
are two completely different things.

545
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,158
Like here, Roberta.

546
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,676
Variations can be compensated
for mathematically.

547
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,753
But deviations, you never know
when they're going to happen.

548
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,833
My grandfather will get you
navigating one of his ships.

549
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,838
- Would you like that?
- Maybe. Someday.

550
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,388
I'd like to finish school first,
though.

551
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,349
- Do you like the sea, Fritz?
- I like things you can depend on.

552
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,158
You can never be sure of the sea.

553
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,470
That's the fun of it,
not being sure.

554
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,920
"The winds aloud howl o'er the masts,

555
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,389
and sing through every shroud.

556
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,074
Pale, trembling, tired,

557
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,833
the sailors freeze with fears

558
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,992
and instant death
on every wave appears."

559
01:04:55,040 --> 01:05:00,512
Homer's <i>Iliad.</i> One of the most
beautiful things ever written.

560
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:05,799
When we were caught in the storm I
thought of those lines over and over.

561
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,757
Do you read a lot, Fritz?

562
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,513
Him? He practically
doesn't even read at all.

563
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:16,034
Never needed to. Ernst always
tells me everything he knows.

564
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,159
I think we're getting off course.
We should bear more...

565
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,315
...to the right.

566
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,516
It's alright, he won't hurt you.

567
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,474
It's gone. Come on.

568
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,271
Stay close to me.

569
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,115
Get out of it, quick!

570
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,437
Do something!

571
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,116
Get the knife!

572
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,270
Ernst, the knife! The knife!

573
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,389
Hurry.

574
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,478
Hurry, Ernst!

575
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,115
- Hit the head!
- I can't find it.

576
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,719
Here!

577
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,109
Now!

578
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,514
I'm sorry it took so long to find it.

579
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,035
It was horrible.

580
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,954
Let's go back.
Please, let's go back.

581
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,954
It keeps getting worse.
And worse.

582
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,474
I think the worst is behind us now.

583
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,320
Here, give me your hand.

584
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,958
No! My compass has gone!

585
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,792
I don't know where to look.

586
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,998
I guess we'll have to get along
without it.

587
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,952
Without it? We wouldn't have a
chance. We need that compass.

588
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:56,591
We don't necessarily need a compass.
I think I can do as well without it.

589
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,114
Think? You could be wrong.

590
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,158
Alright, I don't think it,
I know it. And from now on, Ernst,

591
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,028
you're just going to have to trust my
judgement. Come on.

592
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,750
How's it feel now, Roberta?

593
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:46,830
I don't care what he says.
I can't go on day after day.

594
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:54,238
- We've got no other choice.
- We're lost and you know it.

595
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,233
- We're not lost.
- If you want to go on, go ahead.

596
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,436
Ernst and I have decided not to.

597
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,753
You've what?

598
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:07,114
We can find the river
and follow it back to the coast.

599
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,512
- Anyway, it's two against one.
- Even if it were ten against one

600
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,716
I've got to get us back
and I'm going to.

601
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,314
Being older
doesn't make you always right.

602
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,558
- What are you doing?
- Taking charge of the pistol.

603
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,236
It was appropriated once before
when somebody wanted to go back.

604
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,799
Give me back my pistol!

605
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,071
Now, watch yourself.

606
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,589
Stop it!

607
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,271
Have your pistol back.

608
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,117
But you only have a few shots left.
How far do you think you'd get?

609
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,879
There isn't any decision to make.
We've got to keep going.

610
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,510
I suppose we'd better go with him.

611
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,558
- Do you think you can?
- I'll try.

612
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,829
Go on, get out! Get away!

613
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,837
Go on. Get away.

614
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,720
Get away. Go on.

615
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,433
You really got yourself into a mess.

616
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,871
Alright, I won't hurt you.

617
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,313
Easy, boy. Easy. I'll get you out.

618
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,599
If we can get him out, maybe
you won't have to walk all the way.

619
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,069
You'll never get him out that way.

620
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,119
I'll get more branches, to make a
path.

621
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:27,352
At a time like this you gotta use
your head. Here you are.

622
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,756
<i>O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,</i>
<i>thy leaves are so unchanging</i>

623
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:48,508
<i>O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,</i>
<i>thy leaves are so unchanging</i>

624
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:56,280
<i>Not only green when summer's here,</i>
<i>but also when 'tis cold and drear</i>

625
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,475
<i>O Christmas tree,</i>
<i>O Christmas tree,</i>

626
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,869
<i>Thy leaves are so...</i>

627
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,118
Must have got wet coming over.

628
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,033
I don't know how you managed
to get it ashore.

629
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,317
I couldn't have done it alone.
Fritz and Ernst helped. I...

630
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:28,116
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

631
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,029
Are we ever gonna open up
these other packages?

632
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,159
- Those are for Fritz and Ernst.
- But suppose they don't come back?

633
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:47,198
- Suppose they got ate up?
- Francis, it's been a long day.

634
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,678
- And it's past your bedtime.
- But it's Christmas.

635
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,758
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- I'll come up and say goodnight.

636
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,319
Alright.

637
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,788
It's Fritz and Ernst!
What have you got there?

638
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,593
Did you bring me back my crocodile?

639
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,951
What have you got there? We thought
you got ate up or something.

640
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,996
Merry Christmas!

641
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,991
Merry Christmas!

642
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,999
Merry Christmas!

643
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,196
- What is it?
- A zebra.

644
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,191
Merry Christmas!

645
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,191
Ernst! Happy Christmas!

646
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,272
- Mother!
- Fritz! Happy Christmas!

647
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,911
A zebra.

648
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:41,631
- I think I need that razor next.
- Let's see, Ernst.

649
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,711
Yes. Got it.

650
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,198
It's a good thing you boys
have done. A very good thing.

651
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,953
And I'm going to try and make sure
it's not wasted.

652
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,629
How do you mean?

653
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,280
The pirates know you took
their prisoner

654
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,558
and that you're on this island.
Think they're going to forget?

655
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,075
They didn't know she was a girl
and not a cabin boy.

656
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,628
They wouldn't come after us.
What have we got?

657
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,952
- We've got their prisoner here.
- Pirates! If they come here,

658
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,031
I'll shoot them.

659
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,876
It'll take more than a crossbow.

660
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,439
We'll get the cannon from the ship.

661
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,751
It's useless.
It's rusted right over.

662
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,592
I should have covered it up.

663
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,035
Let's not waste time
looking backwards.

664
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,553
Thank you, Father.

665
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,359
First thing tomorrow,
we'll go out to the ship,

666
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:39,036
take off everything else we might
possibly need and then blow her up.

667
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,032
- You mean with gunpowder?
- What for?

668
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,350
They already know it's there.

669
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,069
I'm hoping that with hundreds
of islands and thousands of reefs,

670
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,674
they won't remember exactly
where we are.

671
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,069
Father's right.
We have to blow it up.

672
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,152
Be ready to fight
but not too proud to hide, eh?

673
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,557
Just a sip now.

674
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,037
That's enough.

675
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,275
It must have taken great courage to
pack up and set off for a new colony

676
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,954
and leave your whole world
behind you.

677
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,352
With my husband and my sons, I wasn't
leaving my entire world behind me.

678
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:22,639
You couldn't know what you were
getting into. All the hardships.

679
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,917
Think of the things
you might have had to do without.

680
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,434
Take a look.

681
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,789
- It's beautiful.
- I've always wanted a daughter,

682
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,997
someone I could dress up
and make clothes for.

683
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,799
I just didn't expect it
for Christmas.

684
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,229
Thank you.

685
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,154
How about this? We get some trees,
bend them down, make snares,

686
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:58,358
the pirates step in the snares,
trip them and they're caught.

687
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,398
But how can we defend this place?

688
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,598
I think what we need is a hill,
so they have to come up to us.

689
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,472
- I got an idea.
- What is it, Francis?

690
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,711
We could dig some big pits

691
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,394
and then we could put lions,
tigers, snakes,

692
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:21,555
and all sorts of animals in there.
When the pirates come, they fall in.

693
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:26,077
I don't know whether we could
manage the lions and tigers,

694
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:30,199
but I think a few pits
might be a very good idea.

695
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:47,395
You look very beautiful, my dear.
Come and join the family.

696
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,351
Allow me, Roberta.

697
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,839
May I have the pleasure
of the first dance?

698
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,872
There. What did I tell you?

699
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,953
Anything we really need, the island
will produce it. Even a girl.

700
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,759
A girl. But we have three sons.

701
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,635
Excuse me, Fritz.

702
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,317
I'll dance with you, Fritz.

703
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,392
I'll rest awhile, if you don't mind.

704
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,112
- What's the matter?
- I was just thinking.

705
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,872
We gotta have those lions and tigers
or else...

706
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,349
Well, that's the whole idea.

707
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,832
I guess we'll just
have to have them, then.

708
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,631
Since you have a partner, Ernst,
I'm sure you won't mind.

709
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,713
It might have been simpler
if I'd left the dress in the chest.

710
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,991
Alright, keep playing.

711
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,837
Thank you.

712
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,598
Come on, Francis.
May I have the pleasure?

713
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,039
Something must have gone wrong
with the fuse.

714
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,031
We're not going back to find out.

715
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,636
We'll have to pick up every scrap
of lumber. Can't leave any evidence.

716
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,949
Must be getting close.

717
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:43,029
I used to dream that somehow we'd
find a way to make her sail again.

718
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,519
Now...

719
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,313
Well, we can be sure of one thing.
If the pirates do come,

720
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,793
we're going to outnumbered.
Maybe ten to one.

721
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:16,193
But up here,
if we prepare everything in advance,

722
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,238
we'll be able to give
a good account of ourselves.

723
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,312
We'll be like medieval knights
defending the castle.

724
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:28,070
We'll keep the muskets
for our final defence.

725
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,355
I'll give the order
when to use them.

726
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:35,389
Of course, if anything should happen
to me, then Fritz will take charge,

727
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,472
- then Ernst.
- And then me.

728
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:43,553
Yes, then you, Francis.
We've only got a small army.

729
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:48,156
We can only afford one general.
Now that's our weak point

730
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,800
and
this is where they'll try to come up.

731
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,518
We could have used the cannon.

732
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,989
We'll have to do
the best we can without it.

733
01:25:55,080 --> 01:26:00,791
Down there we'll put our pits and
our snares and our entanglements.

734
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,192
We could plant some gunpowder and
touch it off with fuses from the top.

735
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,077
Anything to hold them up.

736
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:10,914
You can rely on me, Roberta.
I've got it all worked out.

737
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,151
Can I take care of the lions
and tigers and things?

738
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:17,038
- You're in charge of the tigers.
- Good.

739
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,359
I'd like to be something in the
world, so I want to go to school.

740
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:33,513
You'd love it in London, anyway.
There are concerts, parties, dances.

741
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,878
Ladies in beautiful gowns.
Elegant men in tall hats.

742
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,037
- Did you ever own a tall hat?
- No.

743
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:46,079
I can't wait to see you in one.
You'll be quite handsome.

744
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,474
I think that's what I miss most of
all, the colour and the excitement.

745
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,590
I know I'd especially like it...
if you were there.

746
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:05,953
I'll be there. As long as I live,
I won't travel any further from home

747
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,270
than an occasional trip
to the seaside.

748
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,111
Thank you, Roberta.

749
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,432
There must be something my
grandfather can do for you all.

750
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,158
Herr Kobel used to say,

751
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:22,268
"For some boys school is a
punishment, for others a reward."

752
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,510
There must be something
my grandfather can do.

753
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:38,553
Francis, don't! If you drop that
you could blow us all to pieces.

754
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:42,235
Dropping it wouldn't set it off.
You'd have to light the fuse.

755
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,869
- Even then I'm not so sure.
- You don't think they'll work?

756
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,669
They'll make noise, keep the pirates
confused, that's all.

757
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,958
Just because Papa thought of them
instead of you.

758
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,512
What's all this?
More pirate alarms?

759
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,431
Yes, for the steep side.

760
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,511
You and your pirate alarm.

761
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,912
What about your tiger?
Have you caught him yet?

762
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,437
No. Until Fritz and Ernst dig the
pits there's no place to keep him.

763
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,038
- One of you, give me a hand!
- It's alright, I'll go.

764
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,633
Don't bother.

765
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,717
Up there.
Pull the knot as tight as you can.

766
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,471
Francis, put that down!

767
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,749
Is that alright?

768
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,671
Good.

769
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,991
There we are.

770
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,071
What are you doing?

771
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,674
He was just showing me
how it will work.

772
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,035
I feel sorry for any pirates who
come.

773
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:19,999
It was my idea. If you like I'll
show you what else I had in mind.

774
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:03,995
Pirates. They're here! Into the fort,
everybody! Come on, quick!

775
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,109
- What is it?
- Francis! Where is he?

776
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,750
You know those coconut bombs?
You don't have to worry about them.

777
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,239
They work right well.

778
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:17,392
Come down!
You might have been killed?

779
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:20,836
If you'd stayed put, Ernst,
this wouldn't have happened.

780
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:24,515
- Don't tell me what to do!
- I just did.

781
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,272
- That's enough.
- I don't care.

782
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,590
He thinks he can just give orders.

783
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:33,595
I said that's enough.
This incident's closed.

784
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,671
Now let's get back to work.

785
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,992
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

786
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,399
If you really don't want to go to
school and your mind is made up,

787
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:03,474
maybe my grandfather could give you a
job. It'll be a good job, Fritz.

788
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,869
Perhaps in the counting house.

789
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,475
What if he doesn't get back here
for some reason?

790
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:13,109
What if we have to stay
on the island for 10 or 20 years?

791
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,509
He will come back, I know it.

792
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:20,594
He's probably headed this way now
in one of his fastest ships.

793
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,556
You'd take the job if he offered
it to you?

794
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:31,793
It's not that I wouldn't appreciate
it, but it's just not for me.

795
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,872
Cooped up in an office
counting somebody else's money,

796
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,871
doing the same thing
day after day.

797
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,872
What would you like to do?

798
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,112
If we get off this island I'd like
to do what we started out to do.

799
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,431
Go on to New Guinea
and become part of the new colony.

800
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,750
Maybe take up some land
in my own name.

801
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,876
- Well, why?
- Why?

802
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:00,519
Well, because it's a good thing.
You've got a chance to build,

803
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,397
with your own two hands.

804
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:06,837
It's the beginning of a new country.
That's what I like about it.

805
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,239
Well, I'm going to London.

806
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:17,559
Ernst was very flattering. He said
he'd like to be there if I was.

807
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,955
Wouldn't you like to see me
in London?

808
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:27,678
I don't know that I'll ever be
in London.

809
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:42,156
I don't see how anybody
can shoot a thing like this.

810
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,917
Why don't you teach me how to shoot?

811
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,594
It might be important
if there's a battle.

812
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,191
Alright. Come on.

813
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:05,359
Well... first you pull the gun tight
into your shoulder like this. And...

814
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:13,036
Well, here.
Tight into your shoulder and...

815
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:17,192
Well, right hand near the trigger.
No, here.

816
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,670
Left hand out to support it.
A little more. Right.

817
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:24,639
Now. No, you have to use
this hand to support it.

818
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,869
Now you sight along the barrel here.

819
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,275
You don't mind?

820
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,352
Why do you think I wanted you
to teach me?

821
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,911
- Roberta! Where are you?
- I'm over here.

822
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,029
May I have this next dance, m'lady?

823
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,236
You said that's what you missed.

824
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:01,029
- It's to make you feel at home.
- Where ever did you get that?

825
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,270
You wish the name of my tailor, sir?

826
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:07,035
Go past the town square,
take the first street to the left.

827
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:12,990
- Weren't you covering the pits?
- Weren't you working on the bridge?

828
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:16,959
He was teaching me how to shoot.
I asked him to.

829
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,913
Come here a minute.
I want to show you something.

830
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,391
If you'd like to learn how to shoot,
Roberta, I'd be happy to teach you.

831
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:32,392
I think I have the general idea.

832
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:46,950
The old tiger, he'll come along here
like this at night,

833
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,715
after the pit's been all covered up,
and he'll sniff the meat...

834
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:54,918
...and he'll start to circle the pit.

835
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,589
He'll come around here like this

836
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:07,309
...and he'll think, "I think I just
might grab that big hunk of meat."

837
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:13,191
So he gets down like this, gets like
this, and then...

838
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:19,955
Tell me, Francis, don't show me. Or
you'll be in there before your tiger!

839
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:24,955
Anyhow, he'll jump for the bait
and that's how I'll catch my tiger.

840
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:31,035
Think a tiger's going to fall for
this? You're wasting your time.

841
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,830
You talk about wasting time.

842
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:38,276
How many hours did you spend making
that silly hat?

843
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,396
None of your business.
You're not my boss.

844
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:45,508
No? We've got more important things
to do than try to amuse Roberta.

845
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,158
You're jealous.

846
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:51,233
Jealous? Of what?
Why don't you grow up?

847
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,439
That's enough, Ernst.

848
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,071
Fight!

849
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,149
Now hit him, Fritz.

850
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,711
Come on, Fritz. Get him.

851
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,239
Fight!

852
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:20,599
Come on, Ernst. Fight.

853
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:23,274
Get him, Ernst. Come on.

854
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,351
Get him, Ernst.

855
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,839
What a beauty!

856
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,156
Now your turn.
Come on, Fritz, get him.

857
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:41,113
Fight. Are you afraid of him, Ernst?
Poke him one.

858
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,118
Come on, Fritz. Ernst!

859
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,718
- What's this all about?
- Nothing.

860
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,837
Who started it?

861
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,917
You know,
I think this is probably my fault.

862
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:15,509
I think I've been pushing everybody
just a bit too hard.

863
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,149
It might do us a lot of good
to relax for a change.

864
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,231
So here's what we're going to do.

865
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,551
Tomorrow,
we are going to observe

866
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:28,394
the first national holiday
in the history of New Switzerland.

867
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,713
A holiday? You mean like Christmas?

868
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:36,716
Now let's get on with the work.
Get ready for it.

869
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,549
A holiday. We're going to have
a holiday, Roberta.

870
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:01,999
- Where did we get all these flags?
- I got them off the ship.

871
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:08,871
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

872
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:34,757
How do you like this?
For the winner of the race.

873
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:36,956
I'd better try it on for size.

874
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:42,559
Not going to argue?
Just conceding that I'll win?

875
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:48,395
This afternoon you and Ernst
were fighting. It was my fault.

876
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,711
- It wasn't your fault.
- Everything that's happened lately

877
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:56,032
is because you brought me back, even
the danger we're in from pirates.

878
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,475
You didn't ask to be brought here.

879
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,269
In fact, you had quite different
ideas. Remember?

880
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:09,594
Poor Ernst. The hours he must have
spent making that silly hat.

881
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,435
He didn't mean to neglect his work.
He was just trying to be nice to me.

882
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,274
- I know that.
- I never dreamed he'd do that.

883
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,191
I did hope I could repay your family

884
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:26,273
and all I've done is cause trouble
between you. I didn't want to.

885
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,351
Don't.

886
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:33,433
Roberta, I'm not much at saying
things, you know, but...

887
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:37,069
It's no good. When we leave here,

888
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,799
you're going on and I'm going back
to London.

889
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,391
Let's not make it difficult.

890
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:48,275
When we leave here? How do you
know we're ever going to?

891
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,351
We might be here...

892
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:58,918
- My tiger! I bet I got him!
- Francis, come back here.

893
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,111
Look out, Ernst.

894
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,316
- He might be anywhere.
- Let me go!

895
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,311
Francis, wait till we get there.

896
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,551
It's my tiger. Let me go.

897
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:19,031
Mind the pit.

898
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,634
Where is he?

899
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,989
I would never have believed it!
Well done, Francis.

900
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:38,468
Let's cover it with palm leaves
so he'll go to sleep

901
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,835
and the pirates won't know
he's there.

902
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,036
Go and tell Mother. We'll do it.

903
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,115
Yes.

904
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:50,512
You don't have to worry any more!
I got my tiger!

905
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,315
He's got his tiger.

906
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,115
Everybody back behind
the starting line.

907
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,792
Stay back.

908
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,239
Hang on.

909
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:29,279
Mother, you hold Duke, will you?
That's it.

910
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,875
You go round the first pylon
and then over to that one,

911
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,396
then back and forth three times
and here to the finish.

912
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:39,631
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
to the winner

913
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,395
this gorgeous culinary creation
which all of us will eat.

914
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:47,917
Quiet. Serving as official starter,
the loveliest lady of the canton.

915
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,789
Quick! Come back!

916
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,235
Quick, Mother, fire.

917
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,668
Faster.

918
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,191
Come on, Rocky, get going.

919
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:12,396
Come on, Duchess. Run, girl.

920
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,358
That way. Come on, Rocky.

921
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,869
I can't get on! Give me a chance.

922
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:26,632
No, Turk, get out of here,
you're ruining everything.

923
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:33,033
Look out, Mother.
Wait a minute, Ernst.

924
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:39,633
- No, not that way.
- Hold it, Clementine.

925
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,597
Jump on.

926
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,791
Good boy, Lightning.

927
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,597
You're going the wrong way, Roberta.
Come on, Rocky.

928
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:54,789
Stand still.

929
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,153
Now we're going to win.

930
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,475
It's not good
if you can't stay on him, Fritz.

931
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:19,229
Turk, get away.

932
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:23,435
Not fair, Ernst,
you have to ride him.

933
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,398
- Come on, Rocky, we're going to win.
- Come on, Lightning.

934
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,352
Straight on.
No, not that way, the other way.

935
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,954
No, the other way.

936
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,951
Come on.

937
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,637
Now.

938
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:45,471
I give up. Come on, Clementine.

939
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,119
Come on!

940
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,911
Out of my way.

941
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:06,152
I'm going to ride you
if it's the last thing I do.

942
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,515
Quick, the tape.

943
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:17,789
That's not the way
you're supposed to go!

944
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,830
Wrong way, Roberta.

945
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,354
Roberta. Come back here.

946
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:04,270
Come on, Rocky, we're winning!

947
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:06,715
Not fair, Roberta, I was winning!

948
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,189
You're not hurt?

949
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:12,192
- Pirates on the beach.
- What?

950
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,032
Pirates on our beach.

951
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:18,352
- Up the hill, everybody, quick!
- I'll get the muskets.

952
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:20,351
Come on, Roberta. Come on.

953
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:22,476
Remember your orders?
Get started!

954
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,357
Yes, sir!

955
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:51,637
Come on. Come on, Francis.

956
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:56,276
Duke, Turk, come back.

957
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,670
No time now. They'll be alright.

958
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,551
Come along, Mother.

959
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,474
Come on, Francis.

960
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:14,510
Just stay quiet.

961
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,599
Quick.

962
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,189
They've seen us.

963
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:43,158
They've seen us. The bridge, quick.

964
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,034
Alright, Mother?

965
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,873
Here, Duke! Here, Turk!

966
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,513
Good boy.

967
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:07,234
- Ready, Ernst?
- Ready.

968
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,594
Now!

969
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,558
Fritz, Ernst, come up.

970
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:42,995
Come up.

971
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:12,955
They must be getting near it now.
Over this way a bit.

972
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,957
My tiger! He got them.

973
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,876
Number three.
Now, don't light it till I tell you.

974
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,712
Now.

975
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:10,357
The flame
is meant to reach the powder

976
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:12,351
at the same time as the pirates.

977
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:18,555
See what I mean? Give me the torch.

978
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,435
Bull's-eye!

979
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,149
They're running!

980
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:57,353
- Now the coconut bombs.
- No, not yet.

981
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:04,912
- They're coming round this way.
- Don't fire yet.

982
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,069
Get back.

983
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:20,912
We've got them on the run.

984
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:37,556
- Right. The coconut bombs.
- Good!

985
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,677
That's it.

986
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,753
Keep throwing.

987
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,279
We haven't stopped them. Use the
rifles. Try and pick off the leaders.

988
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:29,828
Where are you going, Father?

989
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,029
It worked.

990
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:44,315
Watch those logs fall down.

991
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:49,671
There's a man getting squashed.

992
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,519
We're safe!

993
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:57,357
Kuala make talk.

994
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,752
You hear?

995
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:02,949
We hear you.

996
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,549
You take boy belong Kuala.

997
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:11,749
Give us boy, no more fight.

998
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,831
You hear?

999
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:17,236
You want the boy? Come and get him.

1000
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:20,392
We're ready for you.
You can put away your white flag.

1001
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:24,750
- Maybe it would be better to agree.
- Don't worry.

1002
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,513
He wouldn't bargain if he
thought he could beat us.

1003
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:32,435
Send the boy down the hill.
Kuala take boy.

1004
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,314
Nobody hurt.

1005
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,470
You hear?

1006
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,517
You make Kuala fight long time

1007
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,788
then you die!

1008
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:54,352
And Kuala take boy all the same.

1009
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,993
It's true. You can't possibly hold
them off forever.

1010
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:05,596
You don't look like a boy any more.
If you give yourself up now...

1011
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,240
But what will happen
to all of you if I don't?

1012
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,276
Nothing's going to happen to anybody.

1013
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:14,191
He must think we're mad.
Roberta, don't listen.

1014
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:16,953
My pirate alarm.

1015
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:20,672
They're coming up that way.

1016
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:37,953
Quick. Down!

1017
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:52,189
Look out! Father, look out!

1018
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,748
Ernst, look.

1019
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:14,589
Stay back.

1020
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:59,236
Get down!

1021
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:12,033
- How many rounds have we got left?
- Five.

1022
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:13,872
Five.

1023
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,159
They're very close.

1024
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,871
They're running away.

1025
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,711
It's a ship. A merchantman.
They're firing on the pirates.

1026
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,234
One of my grandfather's ships.

1027
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,637
I knew he'd come for us.

1028
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,876
- Here we are!
- We're here!

1029
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:21,916
- Can I see your hat, please?
- Of course.

1030
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,991
Thank you.

1031
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,674
No more, thank you.
That was delicious.

1032
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,719
Nothing to it, my boy. I've given
money to that college for years.

1033
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,836
It's time I asked for something.

1034
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:40,759
Well, Roberta and I have talked
about school but a... university!

1035
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:44,276
I never dreamed!
I'm going to a university!

1036
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,876
As for the rest of you,
I won't try to influence you

1037
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,520
but if you'd like
to return to Europe,

1038
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:54,637
I could give you an interesting
fresh start.

1039
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:58,395
But if you still want to go to New
Guinea I'll happily take you there.

1040
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:07,597
I think that since we have to decide
forever, that...

1041
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:12,995
...my husband and I
would just rather stay here.

1042
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,317
That's what you want?

1043
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:24,792
It's been a good life for us here.

1044
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:27,872
As Roberta says, there are
things you have to do without.

1045
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:32,192
But they're unimportant if people
aren't around feeling sorry for you.

1046
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:34,589
You mean I don't have to go?

1047
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:41,713
Fritz and Ernst will go with you.
We'll keep Francis for a few years.

1048
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:46,875
- I'll be back.
- You won't be without neighbours.

1049
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:50,748
You realise that? This is a new
island. There'll be a new colony,

1050
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:55,152
- a new governor.
- You might be made governor, Father.

1051
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,390
More than likely I should say.

1052
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,239
Hello.

1053
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:22,793
It's funny how you can change
your mind about what's important.

1054
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:27,112
What it is you really want.
Take your parents.

1055
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:31,435
All of this time they've been
wanting to get to New Guinea

1056
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:35,718
and now they have their chance they
find everything they want is here.

1057
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:37,552
You mean they're not going?

1058
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:42,956
- I can understand how they feel.
- I do, too.

1059
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:51,073
Two people, if they have each other,
what more could they want?

1060
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:57,595
I guess just to be alone.

1061
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:19,110
It's time to go now. The Captain
wants to sail with the tide.

1062
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,519
Just coming.

1063
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,714
Surely you'll want to go
and see him off?

1064
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:32,997
Anyway, I'll have to explain
to my grandfather.

1065
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:42,308
- Bye, Ernst.
- Good luck next year.

1066
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:45,837
Goodbye, Mother, Father,
Fritz, Roberta.

1067
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,229
Bye, Ernst.

1068
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:51,988
God be with you.

1069
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:56,278
Wait for me! Duchess!
Clementine! Turk!

1070
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,069
