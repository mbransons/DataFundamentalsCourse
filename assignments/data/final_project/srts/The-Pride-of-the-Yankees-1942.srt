1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,290
Why don't you look where you're going?

3
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,729
Come on, butterfingers.

4
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,328
Throw it here. Come on.

5
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,837
Okay, let's play ball. Come on, now.

6
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,878
- Hey, Murphy.
- What do you want?

7
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,012
- Let me in, will you?
- Get outta here.

8
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,550
- I got some Sweet Caporal cards!
- Who you got?

9
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,052
Hans Wagner. Grover Cleveland Alexander.

10
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,748
Them old-timers?

11
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,223
- Tris Speaker, Johnny Evers.
- Has-beens.

12
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,960
- Christy Mathewson.
- A dime a dozen.

13
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,724
Who you holdin' out?

14
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,501
Babe Ruth.

15
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,266
A rookie. Come on, let's play ball!

16
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,706
Come on. Three strikes and he's out.

17
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,267
Put it over the plate now. Come on.

18
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,114
He can't hit anything. Come on!

19
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,580
- What's the matter?
- Sasha.

20
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,277
- Yeah, Mom?
- Your professor's here. Come and take.

21
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,845
In a minute, Mom.

22
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,292
Not in a minute, Sasha. Now!

23
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,421
All right.

24
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,823
Hey, you. Come here.

25
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,629
- You gonna let me take his place?
- Gimme the cards.

26
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,967
Sure, Murph.

27
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,701
- Can I keep Babe Ruth?
- Keep him.

28
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,573
- Gee, thanks.
- Okay, let's play ball.

29
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,905
Get off the sack.

30
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,818
Okay. Let's go, come on.

31
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,747
He's a southpaw, come on. Over the plate, now.

32
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,620
Let's see a good one.

33
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,672
- What's your name?
- Lou Gehrig.

34
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,987
Well, what about it?
We can't wait here all day.

35
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,921
I can't do anything without my wife.

36
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,354
I didn't mean to do it, Mom.
I didn't know I could hit that far.

37
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,254
He busted Colletti's window.

38
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,552
Baseball.

39
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,922
- How much?
- $18.50.

40
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,756
I told him, Mama,
he should carry glass insurance.

41
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,866
Mr. Colletti, let me work it out after school.

42
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,236
- I'll run errands.
- No, Louie.

43
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,465
What we break, we pay for.

44
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:48,611
$16.25 leaves $2.25 I owe you.

45
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,979
- I pay you Saturday.
- Okay, Mrs. Gehrig.

46
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,712
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

47
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,344
Me, too, Mom.

48
00:05:55,555 --> 00:06:00,185
You'd better be, young Gehrig.
I'm telling you, that was a mighty wallop.

49
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:10,195
I feel awful about it, Mom. Honest, I do.
I'll pay you back the money.

50
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,669
I promised to fix Mrs. Reagan's dumbwaiter.

51
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:15,707
It isn't just the money, Lou,
it's the time you waste.

52
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,675
I'll get my working papers. I'll quit school.

53
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,273
Quit school?

54
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:22,373
How can you say that?

55
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,345
How many times have I told you?

56
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,376
I want you to go to school,
and high school, and college and...

57
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:33,785
Look at your papa. Look at me.
We didn't go to school, and what are we?

58
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,885
A janitor. A cook.

59
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,725
I want you to be somebody.

60
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,459
Sure, Mom.

61
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,600
Like your Uncle Otto, Louie.

62
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,669
He went to university. He graduated.

63
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,199
Don't you see, Louie?

64
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:54,235
That's why I'm cooking at Columbia,
so you can go there some day...

65
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,339
...and be an engineer like your Uncle Otto.

66
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,081
Mom, maybe I ain't cut out to be an engineer.

67
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,613
- What do you want to be?
- I want to be a...

68
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,784
- I don't know.
- You've got to know.

69
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,861
In this country,
you can be anything you want to be.

70
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,131
Don't you want to be an engineer
like your Uncle Otto?

71
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,135
- Don't you?
- Sure, Mom.

72
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,933
Whatever you want me to be.

73
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,283
This fraternity has standards.
You can't ignore his family.

74
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,626
- He's a cinch to be a four-letter man.
- His mother's the best cook at Columbia.

75
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,565
Somehow that doesn't add up
to Sigma Alpha Psi, in my mind.

76
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,431
Lou's all right, Van.

77
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,768
- I'm trying to maintain a certain standard.
- Gold standard?

78
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,740
<i>How would you like to get this right in the...</i>

79
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,774
Hold on.

80
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,310
Let's put it to a vote.
All those in favor of pledging Lou Gehrig...

81
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,016
Carried.

82
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,415
Go ahead, if that's what you want.
I won't stand in your way.

83
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,928
Hang a pledge pin on him.
Don't expect me to call him brother.

84
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,985
Let's eat.

85
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,363
I don't know why this has to happen
every night before dinner.

86
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,771
You certainly smacked that ball around
this afternoon.

87
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,406
Yeah. Tough on the guys
who live in the dormitories.

88
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,781
You never know when you're going
to get a baseball in your geometry.

89
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:44,055
- What's your batting average now?
- I'll swap it for your math grade.

90
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,387
Hold it, Lou.

91
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,669
Thanks, fellows.

92
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,873
This is an honor.

93
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,634
You know, I'm not much on talking.
I just would like to say...

94
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,679
...thanks, fellows.

95
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,808
- Welcome in, Lou.
- He's a swell guy.

96
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,383
- Hi, Mom.
- What?

97
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,219
I just said hi.

98
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,686
Hi. The soup is getting cold.

99
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,794
- Mom.
- What?

100
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:25,789
Look.

101
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:32,036
- Lou, they took you in.
- Yeah, just now.

102
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,372
Everything's going so fine now.

103
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:40,434
First Columbia, then a fraternity,
and the next thing, you will be an engineer.

104
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,843
This is just the pledge pin.
I get the real pin before long.

105
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,981
And when I get it,
I'm supposed to give it to my best girl.

106
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,519
You still my best girl, Mom?

107
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,086
Always.

108
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,628
It'll mean you'll have to go steady with me.
You can't look at anybody else.

109
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,188
Not even Papa?

110
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,959
All right, Papa.

111
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:10,266
Well, Sam. I'm going to build my football team
around a new man next fall.

112
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:12,310
A great halfback.

113
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,076
Somebody gunning for you, Jim?

114
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,448
I guess it's always open season
on football coaches.

115
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,487
Especially to you sportswriters.

116
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:26,887
That's the halfback I was telling you about.
Lou Gehrig, a line-plunging fool.

117
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,427
Football?
For a kid that can hit a baseball this far?

118
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,487
There's a pretty stiff wind
blowing in this direction.

119
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,897
That wind could blow him into the major leagues.

120
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,162
Lay off. That happened to Eddie Collins...

121
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,466
...the greatest second baseman
we had at Columbia.

122
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:43,406
It spread all over the sports pages,
and then he's playing professional baseball.

123
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,376
Lay off of this kid, will you?

124
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:49,608
I'm a newspaperman, Jim,
and that sure was some wallop.

125
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:30,488
If you won't introduce me, then I'll just go
right up and introduce myself.

126
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,581
I can't bear not meeting him.

127
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,924
Mr. Gehrig.

128
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,995
I suppose you'll think I'm terribly fresh,
but I just couldn't stand it another minute.

129
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,528
Lou, you seem to have made a conquest.

130
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,571
Mile-a-minute Myra,
the all-American prom-trotter.

131
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,903
Miss Tinsley, may I present Mr. Gehrig?

132
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,770
- How do you do?
- I do, Mr. Gehrig, just wonderful.

133
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,177
What chance have I got against a great athlete?

134
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,578
Pay no attention to me.

135
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,016
I'll just go away somewhere
and drink myself to death.

136
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,849
Aren't you going to ask me to dance?

137
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,224
Wouldn't you condescend to dance
with a little Miss Nobody like me?

138
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,260
- I guess I don't dance very well.
- You and your modesty.

139
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,128
Athletes do everything well.

140
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,105
Don't you want to dance with me?

141
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,606
Would you care to dance, Miss Tinsley?

142
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,208
I'd adore to.

143
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,660
I could just die dancing with you.

144
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:58,006
But it seems such a waste of time.
I want to talk to you.

145
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,177
I know a place we can be all by our lonesome.

146
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,147
It'll be just wonderful.

147
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,016
You know what?
I never danced before in my life.

148
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:16,191
- Now...
- I wouldn't kid you. I'd never kid you.

149
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,056
I was scared stiff, Miss Tinsley.

150
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,095
Myra.

151
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:29,100
Myra, would you like to dance again?

152
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,899
Later.

153
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,906
First, I want to know all about you.

154
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,877
Go on, tell me.

155
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,778
There isn't anything.

156
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,816
A great big, famous person like you?

157
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,417
You've even had your name in the paper.

158
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,358
Tell me, do you just adore baseball?

159
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:54,599
You see, I'm not gonna be a ballplayer.
Mom wants me to be an engineer.

160
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,365
You're going to do what she wants?

161
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,528
Of course.

162
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,364
I think that's just adorable.

163
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,438
Gonna be an old engineer
that never gets his name in the paper.

164
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,040
Just 'cause your mother wants you to.
You're wonderful.

165
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,681
You're the one that's wonderful.

166
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,412
Now, Mr. Gehrig...

167
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,852
Lou.

168
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,523
Are you going to remember me, Lou?

169
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,298
Remember you?

170
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,602
Maybe these will help you to.

171
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,444
Of course they will.

172
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,843
Because they're like you.

173
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,713
<i>- "Night and day time, always play..."
- Hey, Myra.</i>

174
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,876
Where have you been? How about our dance?

175
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,049
Excuse me, Lou.

176

ain't we got fun?"</i>

178
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,262
Here he is now, the pride of the ballroom.

179
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,660
- Quit kidding, will you?
- I wouldn't kid you.

180
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,598
I'd never kid you.

181
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,140
- Come on, eat.
- Nice work, Lou. You're wonderful.

182
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,670
No, I'm not.
You're the one that's wonderful.

183
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,843
What are you going to be
when you grow up, Van?

184
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:35,022
I'd like to be a great, big fireman
because I'm so good at it.

185
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,686
But the mater won't let me.

186
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,955
- She wants me to be a motorman.
- Hey, what is all this?

187
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,623
Van, even though
the big-league teams are begging you...

188
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:47,798
...on their bended knees to join them,
you will remember us, won't you?

189
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,933
I don't need anything
to make me remember you.

190
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,541
But I'd like to have these...

191
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,515
...because they're like you.

192
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,131
He was only joking.

193
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,117
A man from the Yankees is looking for you.

194
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,417
- More jokes?
- Gehrig? My name's Blake.

195
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,922
Miller Huggins of the Yankees...

196
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,619
- You're trying to be funny, too?
- Wait a minute.

197
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,935
Say, Lou.

198
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,268
What made you give Mr. Blake
the rush act last night?

199
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,005
He came up to your fraternity house
to do you a favor.

200
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,343
You mean that he...
You mean that you want to...

201
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,246
Wait a minute. Let's start over again.

202
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,753
This is Sam Blake of the Evening Standard.
Lou Gehrig.

203
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,616
You don't have to play with the Yankees,
but it's no insult to be asked.

204
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,853
The Yankees?

205
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:20,163
- You mean the New York Yankees?
- Not the Chillicothe Yankees.

206
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,127
Thanks.

207
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,331
That's wonderful.

208
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,529
But...

209
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,133
...I'm gonna be an engineer.

210
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,050
Engineer.

211
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:55,592
- Don't get up, Mama. I'll get it for you.
- I can do it. I'm all right.

212
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,034
No, you're not all right. You stay here.

213
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,129
- What's the matter, Pop?
- Mom is sick.

214
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,936
- It's nothing.
- It's something, Lou.

215
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:08,001
- I'll get a doctor.
- Never mind. He'll cost $2.

216
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,672
I'll get him.

217
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,507
We must get your wife
to the hospital immediately.

218
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:50,411
The general hospital is rather crowded,
but I'll see if I can make arrangements.

219
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,528
There must be room in one of the wards.

220
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,097
Mom's not going to a ward.

221
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,225
She's gonna have the best,
a good room in a private hospital.

222
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,166
But beggars can't be choosers.

223
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,138
The private hospital costs money,
and where are we going to get it?

224
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,274
I know where I can get it.

225
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,312
Tell the doc not to bother.
I'll make all the arrangements.

226
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,388
Aren't you gonna read what you're signing?

227
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,891
No, I'm in a hurry.

228
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,988
Just in case you're interested...

229
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,190
...you're the property
of the New York Yankees from now on.

230
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,467
Only, I think we'll have to smooth off
the rough edges.

231
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,140
To start with, I'm going to send you up
to play with Hartford.

232
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,906
- Here you are.
- Thank you, bye. Bye, Blake.

233
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,938
- Try to keep your afternoons free, will you?
- Sure.

234
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,112
Maybe he signed with the wrong team.

235
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,982
He's nutty enough to play
with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

236
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,214
You'll never be sorry you signed him.

237
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,152
Well, I don't know.

238
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,420
That's wonderful, Louie.

239
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,659
But one thing I don't understand.

240
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:10,168
They send you from New York to Hartford
to bring you back to New York.

241
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,802
I'll never understand America.

242
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,539
They're sending me there
for the experience I need.

243
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,575
That's the way they work it.

244
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,510
How you going to work it?

245
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,444
- Work what?
- Mama.

246
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:25,209
Louie.

247
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,787
- How's my best girl?
- Fine.

248
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,958
Mama, I've got to go make a phone call.

249
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,289
Wait a minute. Grab a hold of that.

250
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,536
- How are they treating you, Mom?
- Wonderful.

251
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,707
I can't get over how much
they give you here for nothing.

252
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,111
All the city hospitals are free.

253
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,738
Everybody treats me like a queen.

254
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,845
Mom.

255
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,780
- Yes, Louie?
- I want to tell you something.

256
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,155
- Excuse me a minute.
- Wait.

257
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,927
It's nothing, really.

258
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,961
I'm going away, Mom.

259
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,995
I'm going to Hartford.

260
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,632
- You see, Mom...
- Harvard.

261
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,668
Harvard?

262
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,902
That's wonderful.

263
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,713
You are going to be a great engineer.

264
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,579
Harvard's engineering school is good.

265
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,357
But Louie, suppose she finds out?
What about me?

266
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,458
Protect yourself in the clinches, Pop.

267
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,222
What about mail?
Suppose Mama writes you?

268
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,622
She'll write the letters, but you mail them.

269
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,757
What about the money you will be sending me?

270
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,530
- How will I explain that?
- Tell her you got a job.

271
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,401
- A job? Who, me?
- You.

272
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,097
Louie, wait.

273
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,269
- What kind of a job?
- That's up to you.

274
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,538
All aboard.

275
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,884
Politics.

276
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,478
- Good morning, Mrs. Gehrig.
- Good morning, Mrs. Roberts.

277
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,545
You saw the papers?

278
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,582
Papers? The one says white, the other black.
I never read them.

279
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:26,563
- You must be proud of your son.
- My Lou? Of course.

280
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,624
But I just can't get over how wonderful
everything is with my husband.

281
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,670
Mr. Gehrig, you know?

282
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,998
I had no idea that...

283
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:38,168
My husband told me in the hospital
how wonderful his job was.

284
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,938
I couldn't believe it.

285
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,639
You want to know when he leaves for work?

286
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,643
When he feels like it.

287
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,447
When he doesn't feel like it,
he doesn't go to work at all.

290
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,296
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

291
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,036
- What?
- Nothing.

292
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:09,439
- I couldn't wait for you to come to the door.
- It's in the paper!

293
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,071
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Shut up.

294

This is great news!
You should be a proud father!

295
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,504
You'll tell me later.

296
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,980
Mr. Gehrig, this is a great day.

297
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:23,180
- What is it all about?
- Didn't you read in the paper about Lou?

298
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,489
- Paper? Lou?
- Here it is.

299
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,786
Read it.

300
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,518

305

Congratulations.

306
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,524
If you don't mind, I think there are a few things
I ought to talk over with the folks.

307
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,119
We understand.

308
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,333
How's my best girl?

309
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,770
- I'd better go, too.

310
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,003

I didn't go there just because
I wanted to play baseball.

313
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,558
I went because we needed the money.

314
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:44,696
You were sick,
and the doctor said you might die.

315
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:49,729
I wish I had died, rather than see you
give up everything we planned.

316
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,869
For what? To play ball.

317
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,106
A disgrace like that.

318
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,244
It's not a disgrace to play with the Yankees.

319
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,807
That's what we came to America for.

320
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:05,680
A wonderful country
where everybody has an equal chance.

321
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,358
That's why you studied,
why you went to Columbia...

322
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,919
...so that you could play baseball?

323
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:17,457
After all my plans for you
to follow after your Uncle Otto.

324
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,664
Uncle Otto's dead.

325
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:24,698
Yes, and he'd turn over in his grave
if he knew what happened in the family.

326
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:36,111
People have to live their own lives.
Nobody can live it for you.

327
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,346
Nobody could make a ballplayer out of him...

328
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,187
...and nobody can make anything
but a ballplayer out of me.

329
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:45,628
You are good for nothing.
All baseballers are good for nothing.

330
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,028
Loafers in short pants.

331
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,269
You've never been to a ball game.

332
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,371
Lots of people go every day.
Men, women, and children.

333
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,008
Maybe there's something to it. Maybe it's fun.

334
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,649
Why don't you come out and watch me play...

335
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,986
...so you can judge for yourself?

336
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,622
- What do you say?
- Never.

337
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,574
- You sure we came to the right ballpark?
- Yes.

338
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,715
And those are not the players?

339
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:43,645
They are getting the field ready.

340
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,215
What do they do with the pillows?

341
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,857
They are not pillows. They are bases.

342
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:53,125
- You slide into them.
- I slide into them?

343
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,694
Just watch, Mama.

344
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,859
Just watch.

345
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,121
I can't understand it.
So many people with nothing to do.

346
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:33,390
Score cards. Get your score cards, folks.

347
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,591
You can't tell the players without a scorecard.

348
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,068
My own son, I can tell.
The others are none of my business.

349
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,072
- Is your son playing?
- Sure. Lou Gehrig.

350
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,937
Gehrig? Never heard of him.

351
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,442
- Substitute?
- No. Yankees.

352
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:49,876
Scorecards. Get your scorecards.

353
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,114
Hello, Babe.

354
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,518
- Hello, boys. How are you?
- Hey, Babe.

355
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,748
Was that homer yesterday 38 or 39?

356
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,451
Don't know, but I'll hit 'em and you count 'em.

357
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,996
- Where's Lou?
- I don't see him.

358
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,568
You sure we came to the right ballpark?

359
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,039
What did you say
the name of this genius was?

360
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,877
Gehrig. Henry Louis Gehrig.

361
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,511
$5 will get you $10,
you don't remember any part of it next year.

362
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,850
Henry Blotto Gehrig.

363
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,961
Come on, son. Give me the ball.

364
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,399
Will you give me the ball?

365
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,399
Come on.

366
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,979
Gehrig.

367
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,485
I want you to keep your eye on Wally Pipp,
out there on first base.

368
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,683
I know you can hit,
but fielding is important, too.

369
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:41,884
Yeah.

370
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,759
What's the matter, Wally?
You getting weak? Hit it.

371
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,739
What's the matter, Wally? Can't you see him?

372
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,836
Take your time, Wally old boy.
You can do it.

373
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:38,473
Strike!

374
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,118
- Time.
- Time.

375
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,356
Better take me out, Miller.

376
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,830
I've been seein' double since I was beaned.

377
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,333
That's a tough break. Have Doc look you over.

378
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,160
Too bad, Wally.

379
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,298
Gehrig.

380
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,165
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

381
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,312
Tanglefoot.

382
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,748
Never mind, that. Get in there for Pipp.

383
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,691
- Get a hold of one, I know you can do it.
- Okay.

384
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,731
Lot of pepper.
Come on, talk it up, you fellows.

385
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,138
<i>Gehrig now batting for Pipp.</i>

386
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,975
- You started something, Eleanor.
- Didn't I?

387
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:48,409
Dreadful, isn't it?
I seem to have tied a label on that rookie.

388
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,715
Tanglefoot!

389
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,056
Safe!

390
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,785
Omit flowers, please.

391
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,814
Are you putting the jinx on him?

392
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,759
No, Sam.
But you ought to have a nurse around.

393
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,028
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

394
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,566
Better get to the clubhouse,
have the doc look at you.

395
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,262
I'm all right, Mr. Huggins.
Don't take me out now.

396
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,168
I've been waiting too long to get in.

397
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,675
What do we have to do,
kill you to get you out of the lineup?

398
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:11,299
- Babe, we're waiting for you.
- What will it be tonight, Mr. Ruth?

399
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,805
I'll have a couple of those,
smothered with pork chops.

400
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,362
- Yes, sir.
- Take it easy.

401
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,737
And mushrooms.

402
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,872
- Maybe some nice fish.
- Say, that's an idea.

403
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,318
The Yankees.

404
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,346
Enjoying your stay in Chicago?

405
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,119
- Hello, Mr. Twitchell.
- Hello, losers.

406
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:39,094
Hello, Mr. Twitchell.
Gotta let 'em win once in a while.

407
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,436
There's your friend,
the Hot Dog King's daughter.

408
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,506
Tell them to bring some horseshoes
when they come to New York.

409
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:54,339
- You can't win with alibis.
- We weren't alibiing.

410
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,109
How's Tanglefoot?
Has he come to yet, or can't you tell?

411
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,481
You gave that rookie an awful riding
out there today.

412
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,751
Have you made up your mind yet?

413
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,847
Yes, I think I'll have some lamb chops
and pineapple.

414
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,361
Hello, Mr. Blake.

415
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,270
Tanglefoot.

416
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,675
Miss Twitchell. Mr. Gehrig.

417
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,887
All right, we're even.

418
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,663
If we're even, maybe you'll sit down with us.

419
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:57,265
- Not going to pull it out, are you?
- No.

420
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,013
Mr. Gehrig, I hear this was your first game today.

421
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,281
My first appearance.

422
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,915
And am I glad to get out
of the lumber business.

423
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,427
- You don't know what that means.
- I know what it means.

424
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,156
What does it mean?

425
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:23,060
Picking splinters off of your pants
from sitting on the bench so long.

426
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,298
How long do you expect
to stay off the bench, Mr. Gehrig?

427
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,968
I'll tell you. I got a hunch
I'm gonna be playing for a long while.

428
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,240
Wally Pipp must be awful sick.

429
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:36,506
<i>Say...</i>

430
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,373
What are you doing with this Yankee?

431
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,076
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Mr. Twitchell.

432
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,175
This is my father.

433
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,243
- How do you do?
- Yankees' new first baseman?

434
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,414
- Yes, sir, at last.
- I like the way you stand up to the ball.

435
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,616
Lot of power there.

436
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:49,989
Your father knows a player when he sees one.

437
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,858
- Yes, he stands up to the plate fine.
- Yes, he does.

438
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,161
And he falls down on the bats
pretty good, too, Dad.

439
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,025
Mr. Tanglefoot.

440
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,562
- Won't you join us, Mr. Twitchell?
- Thank you.

441
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,902
Say, Blake...

442
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,607
...you know a lot about women.

443
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,781
Yeah, sure.

444
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:20,883
What does it mean when a girl says
you remind her of a Newfoundland puppy?

445
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,560
Well, if it was an Airedale, that would be bad.

446
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,028
Or a police dog.

447
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,424
That would be fatal.

448
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,831
But a Newfoundland puppy...

449
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,697
...I'd see her again, if I was you.

450
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,962
I think he's got a pinochle deck.

451
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,692
Hey, where have you been?

452
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,996
Let me out of here.

453
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,034
Boys, where's Lou?
Did he get on the train all right?

454
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,737
Yeah, he got on.

455
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,672
Just hoping, that's all.

456
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:53,374
I've watched this game for four hands now.

457
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,256
You've had some swell hats, Babe,
but this one is tops.

458
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,026
It is beautiful.

459
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:12,526
Yeah? Now listen, you mugs. Lay off of this one.

460
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,538
If I see anyone touch it, I'll knock his teeth in.

461
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,035
And I'm not kidding.

462
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,141
Deal me in.

463
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,377
Come on. Ante up.

464
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,346
We can look at it, can't we, Babe?

465
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,578
- You know, from a distance?
- Don't try to kid me, Mark.

466
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,245
- You busted my last one.
- Me? No.

467
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,346
No, not Mark.

468
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,754
Don't look too hard.

469
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,027
That's the fifth straw hat I've bought this season
and that's the last straw.

470
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,031
The last straw? That's a good gag, Babe.
Get the point?

471
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,294
What a gag.

472
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,234
- I'm in.
- Give me three.

473
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,437
Three to Babe. Coming in.

474
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:52,873
- Jack?
- Two.

475
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:18,225
Go ahead, take a bite.
If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.

476
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,603
Take two bites.

477
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,142
What do you got?

478
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,476
Three kings.

479
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,610
Why, you...

480
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,982
- The busher was hungry.
- He didn't need cream and sugar.

481
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,180
That Gehrig's the chump of all time.
Falling for a gag like that.

482
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,748
He doesn't know about gags.

483
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,761
What does he know about, Mr. Bones?

484
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:50,600
- Baseball.
- He knows! I'll tell you something.

485
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:55,264
A guy like that is a detriment to any sport.
He's a boob with a batting eye.

486
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,433
He wakes up, brushes his teeth,
hikes out to the ballpark...

487
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,807
...hits the ball, hikes back to the hotel room...

488
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,608
...reads the funny papers, gargles,
and goes to bed.

489
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,410
That's personality.

490
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,778
- The best.
- A real hero.

491
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,683
Let me tell you about heroes, Hank.

492
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,520
I've covered a lot of them,
and I'm saying Gehrig is the best of them.

493
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:18,925
No front-page scandals, no daffy excitements,
no horn-piping in the spotlight.

494
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:19,985
No nothing.

495
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,828
But a guy who does his job and nothing else.

496
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,528
He lives for his job, he gets a lot of fun out it.

497
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:28,469
Fifty million other people
get a lot of fun out of him...

498
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,906
...watching him do something
better than anybody else ever did.

499
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:36,036
You'd be right, Sam, if all baseball fans
were as big boobs as Gehrig.

500
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,545
They are.
The same kind of boobs as Gehrig.

501
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,976
Only without a batting eye.

502
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,916
That's why I'm putting my money on Gehrig.

503
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,720
There's a package for you, Louie.

504
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,896
- I'll take it, Mom.
- No, I'll open it.

505
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,774
- Maybe I'd better pack it just like it is.
- No, I'll open it.

506
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:12,546
- Where did you say you play first?
- Chicago.

507
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,714
Great town.
They call me Tanglefoot in Chicago.

508
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:20,086
- Tanglefoot?
- Yeah, only she didn't mean it, I think.

509
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,583
Who?

510
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,729
That is the way you talk about a city.
The city's always "she."

511
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,263
Ships, too.

512
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,765
- What's this?
- That's my new suit.

513
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:38,138
- You never had one like this before.
- It's what they call a tuxedo.

514
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:42,042
- Some people call it a tux.
- You wear it when you go out at night.

515
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,545
To a smoker.

516
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,284
Louie.

517
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,191
Am I still your best girl?

518
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,828
Take care of my girl, Pop.

519
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,806
Ball two.

520
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,408
Have you seen Mr. Twitchell, lately?

521
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,244
- Twitchell?
- Yeah.

522
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,347
The fellow we met
at the Rathskeller that night, remember?

523
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,891
I didn't know he'd made
such an impression on you.

524
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,861
Strike two.

525
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,990
Say you wanted to find Mr. Twitchell.
What would you do?

526
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,931
I don't want to find Mr. Twitchell.

527
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:42,362
Don't worry,
you're bound to run into Eleanor one day.

528
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,897
- Eleanor?
- Yes. She'll know where her father is.

529
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,500
It's really quite simple.

530
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,068
Ball three.

531
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,580
I'll bet Twitchell misses you, too.

532
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,332
Pardon me. Well, Miss Twitchell.

533
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,927
- Hello, Mr. Blake. With us again?
- Back again.

534
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:18,736
Is your father around?
One of the boys is very anxious to see him.

535
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,073
- Who?
- Lou Gehrig.

536
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,279
Yes. He's talked an awful lot
about your father.

537
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:30,445
- He's practically talked about nothing else.
- Really?

538
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,736
Gehrig. Snap out of it, will you?

539
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,337
Hey, Tanglefoot.
What's the matter? Are you asleep?

540
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,776
You did it again, mister. Here's your doll.

541
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,808
Would you go away?
Would you please go away?

542
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,316
You're next.
See if you can be as lucky as he was.

543
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,948
How am I doin'?

544
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:45,322
I guess that does it. Shall we eat?

545
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,124
Don't you want to see me shoot?

546
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,529
All right, gents, it's only a nickel.

547
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:55,770
He wins a prize. Here you are, sir.
That's how easy it is.

548
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,637
- That little fellow must be awful strong.
- Yeah.

549
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,143
Try it again, just to prove that wasn't a fluke.

550
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,203
Go on, try it. There, now watch him.
Here he goes.

551
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,011
He did it before, he'll do it again.

552
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:10,412
He did it again.

553
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,387
I've never tried that.

554
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,989
I'll ring the bell once for you.

555
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,958
- How about eating?
- I'll just smack it once.

556
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:20,662
There you are, sir, you're next. All right, now.

557
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,800
- He's a big fellow. Bet he'll break the bell.
- Yeah.

558
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,470
Watch him. He looks like a strong fella.
He might break the machine.

559
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:30,563
Watch him. Step back.
Here you are. Win a prize.

560
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,445
Let's eat.

561
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:40,108
Why, aren't you going to ring the bell for me?

562
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:43,744
- What would you like to eat?
- I'm not so hungry. Go ahead and try it.

563
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,550
All this time,
you were saying how hungry you are.

564
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,319
I must have waited too long,
because I'm not hungry now.

565
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:53,295
You, mister. The little lady wants
to see how strong you are.

566
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:57,390
Don't disappoint the little lady.
Come right over, step right up.

567
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,436
Ring the bell, win a prize.
That's all you have to do.

568
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:03,234
Don't disappoint the little lady.
There you are.

569
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:07,538
Test your strength, that's all there is to it.
Ring the bell and win a prize.

570
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,910
Watch him, folks. Step right up, a nickel.

571
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:14,342
That's too bad. Try again, mister.

572
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:18,878
If at first you don't succeed, you know.
Just as easy as rolling off a log.

573
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:21,651
Wait a minute, mister. Hold this. Look.

574
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,816
You gotta get your wrists into it.

575
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,988
In anything athletic,
you got to get the wrists in. Watch me.

576
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:30,795
Watch him, folks.
Here he goes, watch him, here he goes.

577
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,801
- He did it again.
- See?

578
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,699
- Here, try it.
- That's all there is to it.

579
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:38,936
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's it.

580
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:44,112
Ring the bell and win a prize. That's all...

581
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,844
Here. Beat it, brother.

582
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,644
- Now we eat.
- Boy.

583
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:54,189
- What would you like to eat?
- Hot dogs and champagne?

584
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,315
Good!

585
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:09,207
<i>I'll be loving you</i>

586
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,380
<i>always</i>

587
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,252
<i>With a love that's true</i>

588
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:19,556
<i>always</i>

589
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,360
<i>When the things you've planned</i>

590
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:26,994
<i>Need a helping hand</i>

591
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:32,631
<i>I will understand, always</i>

592
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,108
<i>Always</i>

593
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:39,778
<i>Days may not be fair, always</i>

594
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:47,218
<i>That's when I'll be there, always</i>

595
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,523
<i>Not for just an hour</i>

596
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:54,722
<i>Not for just a day</i>

597
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,132
<i>Not for just a year</i>

598
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:01,261
<i>but always</i>

599
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:16,575
- To your first World Series.
- Don't say that, not yet.

600
00:54:16,986 --> 00:54:20,854
We've got six more cities waiting for us,
and anything can happen.

601
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,121
Did you realize, this is my last night
in Chicago this season?

602
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,820
And this is good-bye?

603
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:32,567
What a lot of 'em.
Six more to go. Six more good-byes.

604
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,894
Six more what?

605
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,202
You play in seven cities
when you're on the road.

606
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:42,608
You must have a girl in every city.
A ballplayer is a lot like a sailor, isn't he?

607
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,445
A girl in every port.
What's Miss Boston's name?

608
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,544
I never said I had a girl in Boston.

609
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,918
Haven't you? What about Philadelphia?

610
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,789
St. Louis? Cleveland? Detroit?
Washington? New York?

611
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,387
You forgot Chicago.

612
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,192
Chicago? Who?

613
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,801
Aren't you my girl?

614
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,500
I don't know what you mean by "your girl."

615
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,665
Your best girl, is that what you mean?

616
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:16,367
I guess that's what I mean.
I guess I thought you were.

617
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,804
Whatever gave you that idea?

618
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,083
I've seen you four days in a row.

619
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:27,453
And you're out with me here tonight.
Isn't that what best girls do?

620
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:31,584
Is it? I wonder if I'm going to miss you.

621
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:37,056
- Can't you find out before I go?
- Nope. Isn't that too bad?

622
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,464
Why is it like that?

623
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:42,628
I have no idea.

624
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,541
Seems silly, doesn't it?

625
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:48,134
I like that tune, don't you?

626
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,369
Dance with me?

627
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:09,730
Lou, if I do miss you,
I wish I knew how much I were going to.

628
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,998
I wish you knew before I left.

629
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:13,734
Shall I try?

630
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:15,829
How?

631
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:17,871
<i>Shall I...</i>

632
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,209
- Where do you go from here?
- Detroit.

633
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:22,608
All right.

634
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,909
Close my eyes,
and pretend it's tomorrow night...

635
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,006
...and I'm dancing with someone else.

636
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:31,182
- Yeah, I get the idea.
- All right, ready?

637
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,586
Are you in Detroit?

638
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,357
Yep. I'm sitting in the lobby
of the Statler Hotel.

639
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:44,660
Who am I dancing with?
Let me see. Who do I know?

640
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,202
Harold Chandler, Bill Talbot...

641
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:50,238
...Jim Johnson, Jack Austin...

642
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:53,135
...Bill Church, Sam Price...

643
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,369
Hey.

644
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,607
- What?
- You've got a ball club of your own.

645
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:03,078
I'm tired of this game. I don't like it.
I'm back from Detroit.

646
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,653
And I'm laughing again.

647
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,183
<i>"Not for just an hour</i>

648
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,655
<i>"Not for just a day</i>

649
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:15,630
<i>"Not for just a year</i>

650
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:18,189
<i>"but always"</i>

651
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,509
- All right, Babe.
- Hold it. That's it, still.

652
00:57:26,477 --> 00:57:28,604
Hand the ball to the kid.

653
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:32,147
That's it, Babe. Give us a big smile, Billy.

654
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:34,548
- Can you sit up a little, son?
- Hold it!

655
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:39,215
- There you are, kid.
- Let's have one with your arm around him.

656
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,554
- Can you look up at Mr. Ruth, sonny?
- Hold it.

657
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,956
That's it.

658
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,856
- Just one more.
- Right. Go right ahead.

659
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:50,390
Page one, on every rag from coast to coast,
or I go back to the copy desk.

660
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,494
That's enough, boys.

661
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:58,633
And what's more, Billy, I'm going to hit
a home run for you this afternoon...

662
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:02,076
...and what's more,
you can pick your own field...

663
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:04,213
...left, center or right.

664
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:07,140
What did you say? Center field? Okay.

665
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:11,811
- Hey, Babe.
- Yes.

666
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:14,289
- I wonder if you'd autograph this for me?
- I will.

667
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:16,883
- Would you autograph mine, too, please?
- Absolutely.

668
00:58:18,596 --> 00:58:19,995
Keep your chin up, Billy.

669
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:22,931
Mr. Gehrig, will you put your name on it, too?

670
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,989
Sure.

671
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:37,846
- You're quite a fan, aren't you?
- I haven't missed a game this season.

672
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,312
Yeah.

673
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:42,846
Thanks.

674
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,988
I like to play baseball.

675
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,189
You'll play again.

676
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,564
You know there isn't anything you can't do,
if you try hard enough.

677
00:58:56,634 --> 00:58:59,159
- You think so?
- Sure.

678
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:02,897
Could you knock a home run
for me this afternoon?

679
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:07,041
But you've already been promised one
by Babe Ruth.

680
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:08,203
Could you?

681
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,143
That's a pretty tall order.

682
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:16,845
Okay.

683
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,685
Could you knock two homers?

684
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:23,216
Two homers, in a World Series?

685
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:27,855
You said that you could do anything
if you tried hard enough.

686
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,727
That's what you said.

687
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:34,195
Yeah.

688
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:36,097
Okay.

689
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,169
I'll hit two homers for you,
if you hit one for me.

690
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,435
Me?

691
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:44,808
You've got to promise me that...

692
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:49,376
...one of these days, you're going to get
out of bed and go home on your own power.

693
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:50,611
But how?

694
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:53,623
If you want to do something hard enough,
you can do it.

695
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,153
We can both do it, can't we?

696
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,127
Okay.

697
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,893
- So long, Billy.
- So long, Mr. Gehrig.

698
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:06,435
- Lou.
- Lou.

699
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:16,275
<i>It's been announced
that all threat of rain has disappeared.</i>

700
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,576
<i>The World Series between
New York and St. Louis...</i>

701
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:21,140
<i>... will be resumed this afternoon as scheduled.</i>

702
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:25,420
Good afternoon.

703
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:28,253
This is Bill Stern,
from Sportsman's Park in St. Louis.

704
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:31,954
This is a World Series that'll make history,
go down in history, be history.

705
01:01:01,816 --> 01:01:04,614
The Babe has just stepped up to the plate.

706
01:01:09,623 --> 01:01:13,320
The Babe's going to try for a home run,
but it's not for the crowd.

707
01:01:13,394 --> 01:01:15,294
I'll tell you what the crowd doesn't know.

708
01:01:15,362 --> 01:01:18,456
<i>This one's going to be for a little boy
in a St. Louis hospital.</i>

709
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:22,298
<i>It's an IOU from the Sultan of Swat
to a little crippled kid.</i>

710
01:01:22,369 --> 01:01:23,427
Will he pay it?

711
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:25,299
Ball!

712
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:37,977
<i>There goes a home run
out in the center field bleachers.</i>

713
01:01:38,052 --> 01:01:40,714
<i>Ruth at first base.
Yankees come out of their dugout.</i>

714
01:01:40,788 --> 01:01:43,382
<i>A smile all over the faces
of the New York Yankees.</i>

715
01:01:43,457 --> 01:01:46,085
<i>Miller Huggins has a grin on his mouth
from ear to ear.</i>

716
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,187
<i>Things aren't bad enough here in St. Louis,
but the next man up has to be Lou Gehrig.</i>

717
01:01:50,264 --> 01:01:52,630
<i>Ruth is coming into home plate now.</i>

718
01:02:01,408 --> 01:02:03,842
Babe Ruth is pretty good, too.

719
01:02:10,718 --> 01:02:14,779
Gehrig is in the batter's box,
in a second, I think we'll be set to go.

720
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,552
Folks, this is going to be a great day
for little Billy in the hospital.

721
01:02:22,963 --> 01:02:27,093
<i>I've just been informed that Lou Gehrig
has promised to hit two home runs for him.</i>

722
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:48,711
<i>It's a home run for Lou Gehrig.
A home run for Gehrig.</i>

723
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:52,122
<i>Gehrig puts it right over the fence.
He really delivered.</i>

724
01:02:52,192 --> 01:02:55,628
<i>The Yankees have come out of their dugout,
Miller Huggins leading them.</i>

725
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:07,663
What a duel. This is a batting duel
between the two Kings of Clout.

726
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:09,402
Each one has knocked out a home run...

727
01:03:09,476 --> 01:03:12,775
...but Gehrig has promised two home runs
for that kid. Can he do it?

728
01:03:12,846 --> 01:03:14,575
Here's $10 says he can't.

729
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,645
Here's $10 says he can.

730
01:03:19,987 --> 01:03:21,249
Ball!

731
01:03:27,695 --> 01:03:29,026
Strike!

732
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,992
The catcher gives the signal.
Pitcher's got the ball, here's the windup.

733
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:39,536
Strike!

734
01:03:40,407 --> 01:03:41,669
<i>Strike two.</i>

735
01:03:42,343 --> 01:03:44,834
The ball is back to the pitcher.
He takes his time.

736
01:03:55,356 --> 01:03:57,221
<i>Strike three. Gehrig's out.</i>

737
01:04:00,027 --> 01:04:03,326
Louie didn't want Babe Ruth to feel bad.

738
01:04:24,018 --> 01:04:26,316
This is the sixth inning. Lou's at bat again.

739
01:04:26,387 --> 01:04:29,754
After that second home run for Billy,
that little boy in the hospital.

740
01:04:30,891 --> 01:04:32,051
Strike!

741
01:04:32,793 --> 01:04:34,192
Take it easy, Lou.

742
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:39,257
<i>Gehrig seems to be overanxious.
He's reaching for some bad ones.</i>

743
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:42,200
<i>He's trying too hard
for that second home run for that kid.</i>

744
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:45,466
That was a sucker bet.
I hate to take that $10 from you.

745
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:47,871
- Do you want to make it $20?
- $20 it is.

746
01:04:52,646 --> 01:04:54,079
Come on, hit it.

747
01:04:54,248 --> 01:04:56,113
Gehrig takes his bat off his shoulder.

748
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:58,344
Looks at it. Maybe he thinks it has a hole.

749
01:05:12,933 --> 01:05:14,298
<i>Strike three.</i>

750
01:05:14,635 --> 01:05:15,932
Oh, gosh.

751
01:05:19,673 --> 01:05:22,471
Maybe you'd better call Lou
on the long distance...

752
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:24,511
...and tell him to stop fooling.

753
01:05:37,057 --> 01:05:39,025
Hurry, hurry! Lay down!

754
01:05:39,093 --> 01:05:40,185
Safe!

755
01:05:41,795 --> 01:05:43,729
Now, remember, Lou, take it easy.

756
01:05:43,797 --> 01:05:47,426
Take it easy, don't press.
All we need is a single.

757
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,038
You might as well kick in with the $20.

758
01:05:52,106 --> 01:05:54,870
- The game isn't over yet.
- It's as good as over.

759
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:58,306
- You want to make it $30?
- It's a bet.

760
01:05:59,279 --> 01:06:00,644
Here he is again.

761
01:06:08,489 --> 01:06:09,615
Ball!

762
01:06:11,391 --> 01:06:13,086
They're going to pass him.

763
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,693
That's dirty pool.

764
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,961
<i>Last time at bat in this World Series
and if they walk him, it will fill the bases.</i>

765
01:06:24,037 --> 01:06:27,006
<i>That's a lot better
than risking an apple over the fence.</i>

766
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:37,914
Let him walk you, Lou.

767
01:06:40,687 --> 01:06:43,383
The count's no strikes, three balls, two outs.

768
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:46,451
<i>Here it comes.</i>

769
01:06:56,970 --> 01:07:00,804
If you haven't got $30,
I'll take your left leg on account.

770
01:07:11,251 --> 01:07:15,017
<i>What do you think of that one?
Two home runs in one World Series game.</i>

771
01:07:15,089 --> 01:07:17,455
<i>He's really a man, that man.</i>

772
01:07:17,524 --> 01:07:20,823
<i>From now on, they'll have to spell
Gehrig's name in capital letters.</i>

773
01:07:20,894 --> 01:07:22,122
Lou.

774
01:07:22,596 --> 01:07:24,188
Gehrig.

775
01:07:53,427 --> 01:07:55,952
Hey, guys, what about a half-dozen collars?

776
01:07:56,029 --> 01:07:57,428
Go to it, boys.

777
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:01,827
Mr. Gehrig.

778
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:04,303
Mr. Gehrig, telegram for you.

779
01:08:05,005 --> 01:08:07,303
Hey, don't tear my clothes.

780
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:24,247
Everything all right, Lou?

781
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,598
What's the idea?

782
01:09:15,142 --> 01:09:16,871
- You live here?
- No.

783
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,411
What are you doing here?

784
01:09:18,478 --> 01:09:21,140
I was calling on a young lady.

785
01:09:21,215 --> 01:09:23,649
At 4:00 in the morning?

786
01:09:24,484 --> 01:09:25,746
What for?

787
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,378
If you must know...

788
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:31,185
...I was calling on the young lady
to ask her to marry me.

789
01:09:31,258 --> 01:09:35,456
- I see. And who are you?
- My name is Lou Gehrig.

790
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:38,020
- Lou who?
- Gehrig.

791
01:09:39,266 --> 01:09:41,427
You look like him, too.

792
01:09:42,536 --> 01:09:44,094
I didn't recognize you in the dark.

793
01:09:44,171 --> 01:09:47,072
My name's O'Doole.
Glad to know you, Gehrig.

794
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:51,969
- You're gonna ask her to marry you?
- Yeah.

795
01:10:00,354 --> 01:10:02,879
Knocked out a couple of homers yesterday,
didn't you?

796
01:10:02,956 --> 01:10:04,446
I got a little lucky.

797
01:10:05,592 --> 01:10:08,322
I hope you have good luck today, too.

798
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:19,666
Is Miss Twitchell at home?

799
01:10:20,307 --> 01:10:23,765
- What's she done?
- Nothing yet.

800
01:10:23,944 --> 01:10:26,708
- Tell her Lou Gehrig wants to see her.
- Yes, sir.

801
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:30,181
- Will you come in and wait in the parlor?
- Yeah. Go on in.

802
01:10:30,484 --> 01:10:31,610
Thank you.

803
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,150
You're kinda fidgety.

804
01:10:41,228 --> 01:10:42,354
Yeah.

805
01:10:44,398 --> 01:10:45,660
Eleanor.

806
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,933
- What is it?
- A policeman wants to see you.

807
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:53,737
- A policeman?
- And a fellow called Lou Gehrig.

808
01:11:05,152 --> 01:11:07,518
I guess you don't need me anymore.

809
01:11:18,098 --> 01:11:22,364
Louie should be home most any minute.
I don't know what's keeping him.

810
01:11:23,103 --> 01:11:25,765
Tessie, don't you see him yet?

811
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:28,635
Not yet.

812
01:11:29,609 --> 01:11:31,941
I love surprise parties.

813
01:11:32,379 --> 01:11:34,939
Why didn't Lou come home
on the train with the team?

814
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:37,575
He missed the train. He sent us a telegram.

815
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:41,246
I bet Lou will be glad to get back home
after all that hotel food.

816
01:11:41,321 --> 01:11:42,481
Yes.

817
01:11:42,556 --> 01:11:46,890
Tonight we have stuffed breast of veal,
and tomorrow night, fried eels.

818
01:11:48,995 --> 01:11:50,986
Tessie, no sign yet?

819
01:11:51,498 --> 01:11:52,726
Not yet.

820
01:11:52,966 --> 01:11:54,900
I don't know what's keeping him.

821
01:11:54,968 --> 01:11:57,334
Papa is in there fussing with the food again.

822
01:11:57,404 --> 01:11:59,235
I gave you the instructions.

823
01:11:59,306 --> 01:12:02,241
You said you would tell Apfell.
You got it wrong.

824
01:12:02,309 --> 01:12:03,674
You have ruined everything.

825
01:12:03,744 --> 01:12:06,872
- What is it, Papa?
- This fool. This dope.

826
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:09,211
It ain't my fault. I just delivered it.

827
01:12:09,282 --> 01:12:11,273
- What happened?
- Look.

828
01:12:11,485 --> 01:12:14,113
They made Louie a right-handed batter.

829
01:12:14,654 --> 01:12:19,057
I didn't even know what it was.
Mr. Apfell just told me to deliver it.

830
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:22,626
The only one in America
that don't know Louie's a southpaw...

831
01:12:22,696 --> 01:12:23,993
...and he has to be our baker.

832
01:12:24,064 --> 01:12:27,158
- Maybe nobody'll notice it.
- A right-hander.

833
01:12:27,234 --> 01:12:29,600
- Tessie, now?
- Not yet.

834
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:32,263
What do you think happened to the cake?

835
01:12:32,339 --> 01:12:34,000
Now!

836
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:50,679
Where is everybody?

837
01:12:52,692 --> 01:12:54,353
Surprise!

838
01:13:04,371 --> 01:13:05,838
Mom, this is Ellie.

839
01:13:05,906 --> 01:13:08,306
I mean, Eleanor Twitchell.

840
01:13:09,242 --> 01:13:11,005
Hello, Mrs. Gehrig.

841
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:16,044
- And this is my pop.
- Lou, that was some ball game.

842
01:13:18,151 --> 01:13:20,085
- This is Mrs. Johnson.
- How do you do?

843
01:13:20,153 --> 01:13:23,350
Mrs. Martin, Mrs. Larsen, and Miss Larsen.

844
01:13:23,423 --> 01:13:26,688
Well, listen, folks,
there's something I've got to tell you.

845
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,794
I guess there's only one way to do this thing.

846
01:13:31,498 --> 01:13:32,988
Mrs. Gehrig, meet Mrs. Gehrig.

847
01:13:33,066 --> 01:13:35,899
- What?
- I mean, as soon as we get married.

848
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:42,301
Lou's done nothing but talk about you,
Mrs. Gehrig.

849
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:43,842
I'm so happy.

850
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,372
I got some refreshments in the other room.

851
01:13:54,087 --> 01:13:56,282
Brought you back a ball used in the third game.

852
01:13:56,356 --> 01:13:57,380
Did you?

853
01:13:59,793 --> 01:14:02,819
The trouble with you, Mama,
you are not modern.

854
01:14:03,697 --> 01:14:05,562
A young fellow nowadays...

855
01:14:05,632 --> 01:14:09,159
...he's engaged,
he takes his girl back to her hotel.

856
01:14:09,436 --> 01:14:12,405
It's 10 minutes to the hotel, 10 minutes back.

857
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:15,640
But it doesn't mean he gets home in 20 minutes.

858
01:14:24,217 --> 01:14:26,947
By the end of next season,
you can finish up in Chicago...

859
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:31,650
...come back here and get an apartment,
fix it up, then we'll get married.

860
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:37,156
I think she's giving us a gentle hint.

861
01:14:45,672 --> 01:14:47,503
Do you think your mother likes me?

862
01:14:47,574 --> 01:14:50,475
Like you? How could she help liking you?

863
01:14:50,844 --> 01:14:52,505
I was just wondering.

864
01:14:53,179 --> 01:14:55,704
She ought to be jealous of you.
You're so pretty.

865
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:57,477
I'm jealous of you myself.

866
01:14:58,018 --> 01:14:59,781
I guess I was wrong.

867
01:15:00,053 --> 01:15:02,647
- About what?
- Nothing.

868
01:15:02,756 --> 01:15:04,849
- Good night.
- Good night.

869
01:15:58,445 --> 01:16:01,505
I must say, you've picked
the most beautiful number in the store.

870
01:16:01,582 --> 01:16:06,417
- Ellie, if you are looking for a chifforobe...
- I found it, Mom. Just what I want.

871
01:16:06,487 --> 01:16:08,079
Isn't it lovely?

872
01:16:08,422 --> 01:16:12,654
It don't look very practical,
and it looks second-hand, too.

873
01:16:13,427 --> 01:16:15,054
It's an antique.

874
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:18,957
Louie can afford to buy new stuff.

875
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,027
I'll show you.

876
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:23,900
Look at that.

877
01:16:24,505 --> 01:16:27,406
Strong and practical. It'll last a lifetime.

878
01:16:32,012 --> 01:16:36,540
- Mom, I worked out sort of a scheme.
- It was only a suggestion.

879
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:40,182
- You see, the rug in the bedroom...
- The rug.

880
01:16:40,821 --> 01:16:43,790
You remind me. I'll show you.

881
01:16:46,693 --> 01:16:48,183
Take a look at that.

882
01:16:48,662 --> 01:16:51,495
It's exactly the right size for your living room.

883
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:54,557
I was planning on something
more a pastel shade.

884
01:16:54,635 --> 01:16:58,731
It's almost an exact duplicate
of the first rug we had in our place.

885
01:16:58,805 --> 01:17:00,432
Only more so.

886
01:17:00,607 --> 01:17:02,734
That's why I bought it for you.

887
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,376
It's your wedding present.

888
01:17:05,612 --> 01:17:09,070
I asked them to bring it up
to see how it would look.

889
01:17:09,449 --> 01:17:12,475
You can live with it for a while,
and if you don't like it...

890
01:17:12,553 --> 01:17:13,542
I can send it back.

891
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,351
I promise, you won't send it back,
not with the scarf on it.

892
01:17:18,392 --> 01:17:21,520
I just want you to let me show you
how it looks.

893
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:24,291
- Will you let me, Ellie?
- Certainly.

894
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,094
What's that?

895
01:17:29,469 --> 01:17:31,061
The bedroom paper, miss.

896
01:17:31,138 --> 01:17:34,130
You've made a mistake. It's the wrong pattern.

897
01:17:34,207 --> 01:17:37,904
- This is the one I selected.
- It was changed this morning.

898
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:42,039
- Who changed it?
- Isn't it beautiful?

899
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:45,380
This little rose pattern I picked out...

900
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:50,355
I guarantee you wouldn't like it
if you saw it on the wall, neither would Louie.

901
01:17:51,191 --> 01:17:53,955
Lou was with me when I picked it out.
He liked it.

902
01:17:54,027 --> 01:17:55,619
Men like anything.

903
01:17:55,696 --> 01:17:58,756
I never gave you much advice.
First, you wouldn't take it.

904
01:17:58,832 --> 01:18:02,199
Second, I've been married 35 years...

905
01:18:02,269 --> 01:18:04,499
...and I've learned one thing.

906
01:18:04,838 --> 01:18:05,930
Well?

907
01:18:06,406 --> 01:18:09,637
Can't you read between the lines
what I'm saying?

908
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:12,804
It's not anything I can say
in so many words...

909
01:18:12,879 --> 01:18:16,940
...and yet, it's something that,
if you don't handle it right...

910
01:18:20,587 --> 01:18:23,420
Don't say anything about this to Mama.

911
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:25,522
About what?

912
01:18:25,859 --> 01:18:28,555
It's all right.
It doesn't make that much difference.

913
01:18:28,629 --> 01:18:32,759
- And if you don't like the chifforobe...
- I'll probably get used to it.

914
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:36,064
You are very sweet to admit you are wrong.

915
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:49,171
Look, the same wallpaper
we had when you were a little boy.

916
01:18:49,249 --> 01:18:53,310
- What's wrong with Ellie?
- Ellie? Nothing. She just left here.

917
01:18:53,387 --> 01:18:56,515
- What happened? Was it about this?
- The chifforobe?

918
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,353
It's not what she ordered. She wanted...

919
01:18:58,425 --> 01:19:01,326
It wasn't practical. Not even mahogany.

920
01:19:01,395 --> 01:19:03,693
- The drawers were too small.
- But she liked it.

921
01:19:03,764 --> 01:19:07,666
She liked this wallpaper, too, at first.

922
01:19:07,734 --> 01:19:11,534
But I convinced her that pattern was better.
More practical.

923
01:19:12,072 --> 01:19:13,972
She's very sensible.

924
01:19:14,408 --> 01:19:17,900
- You are lucky to get a girl like her.
- That's right.

925
01:19:55,048 --> 01:19:57,573
I just had a nice talk
with your mother-in-law.

926
01:19:57,784 --> 01:20:00,582
- What about?
- Lots of things.

927
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:06,191
Mostly about interior decorating,
especially wallpaper and chifforobes.

928
01:20:07,627 --> 01:20:10,562
You know that wallpaper you picked out
for the bedroom?

929
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,664
I think it's wonderful.

930
01:20:15,969 --> 01:20:19,496
- Your mother picked out another pattern.
- I saw it. It's terrible.

931
01:20:19,573 --> 01:20:21,302
And so is that chifforobe.

932
01:20:21,374 --> 01:20:25,037
- You mean, the one that just came in?
- I mean, the one that just went out.

933
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:29,310
I told them to take it back.
I'd have nightmares looking at that thing.

934
01:20:30,717 --> 01:20:33,948
Lou Gehrig, I think I could learn to like you.

935
01:20:35,155 --> 01:20:37,555
I hope you didn't hurt Mom's feelings.

936
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:40,991
I probably did. But she'll get over it.
She'll have to.

937
01:20:41,061 --> 01:20:45,327
You can't run a baseball team with two captains
or a household with two bosses.

938
01:20:45,565 --> 01:20:48,432
There's only going to be one boss
in this house.

939
01:20:49,369 --> 01:20:52,668
You'd better get that apron off,
and get your nose powdered.

940
01:20:52,739 --> 01:20:53,728
Why?

941
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:57,265
I telephoned Sam Blake
to get the mayor over here right away.

942
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,834
What for?

943
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:01,411
I thought you wanted to get married.

944
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:12,151
<i>"...giving the ring and join hands.</i>

945
01:21:12,225 --> 01:21:16,491
<i>"Now therefore, I,
by virtue of authority reposed in me...</i>

946
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:28,200
<i>"I pronounce...</i>

947
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,281
"I pronounce, they are man and wife."

948
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:48,352
The party is over.
We've got to get this house ready for living.

949
01:21:48,428 --> 01:21:51,420
Put the bathtub in there. Thank you, sir.

950
01:21:52,465 --> 01:21:55,957
Mr. Blake, you better arrange right away
for a leave of absence for Louie.

951
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,630
- Leave of absence? What for?
- Your wedding trip.

952
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:01,230
Atlantic City would be a good place.

953
01:22:02,409 --> 01:22:04,036
Excuse me.

954
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:07,307
I haven't missed a game since I joined,
and I'm not going to now.

955
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,245
If he does, I'll get a divorce.

956
01:22:09,316 --> 01:22:11,716
You mean you are not
going to have a honeymoon?

957
01:22:11,785 --> 01:22:14,015
Of course. The Yankee Stadium.

958
01:22:14,087 --> 01:22:16,783
We'd better go if Ellie wants to stop
to change her dress.

959
01:22:16,857 --> 01:22:19,257
Holy Mackerel, I'll miss batting practice.

960
01:22:51,658 --> 01:22:53,023
Pull over.

961
01:23:03,236 --> 01:23:05,636
Fifty miles an hour on a thoroughfare.

962
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,100
Fifty-five to be exact, Officer.

963
01:23:08,642 --> 01:23:09,939
I know it's terrible but...

964
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:13,537
...it'll be terrible if we don't get
to the Yankee Stadium in 15 minutes.

965
01:23:13,613 --> 01:23:17,242
It'll be terrible if you don't get there
for the start of the game.

966
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:21,384
It will be terrible if Lou Gehrig
doesn't get there for the start of the game.

967
01:23:21,655 --> 01:23:24,624
You know he hasn't missed a game
since he joined the Yankees.

968
01:23:25,225 --> 01:23:26,624
Who'd you say?

969
01:23:27,327 --> 01:23:28,453
Lou Gehrig.

970
01:23:30,897 --> 01:23:33,092
- Hello, Mr. Gehrig.
- Hi, officers.

971
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:35,293
- This is Mrs. Gehrig.
- How do you do?

972
01:23:35,368 --> 01:23:39,099
This is our 10th wedding anniversary.
We've been married 10 minutes.

973
01:23:39,172 --> 01:23:41,697
- You just got married.
- What do you know about that?

974
01:23:41,775 --> 01:23:44,539
Pardon me,
but the game starts in exactly 14 minutes.

975
01:23:44,611 --> 01:23:46,044
What are we waiting for?

976
01:23:46,112 --> 01:23:48,580
Do you want to get pinched
for holding up traffic?

977
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:56,289
- Who you got there, Joe?
- Lou Gehrig.

978
01:23:56,356 --> 01:23:58,256
He's late for the game.

979
01:23:58,792 --> 01:24:00,987
It's Lou Gehrig. Come on.

980
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:25,743
That's the way to go in there.

981
01:24:28,221 --> 01:24:31,816
What are you doing, Lou?
Knocking the rice off of your spikes?

982
01:24:38,798 --> 01:24:40,561
All right, pitch to me, now.

983
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:53,011
That was a thank you for marrying me.

984
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:56,911
- What?
- That was a thank you for marrying me.

985
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:58,206
What?

986
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:02,783
He says that was thank you for marrying him,
and we thank you, too.

987
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:05,319
You're welcome.

988
01:25:11,097 --> 01:25:13,964
Not so bad for a guy
who nobody was going to remember.

989
01:25:14,034 --> 01:25:16,901
- One more kissing the bride.
- Okay.

990
01:25:17,537 --> 01:25:19,368
That's terrific. Hold it.

991
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:21,835
Thank you, Mr. Gehrig.

992
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:24,274
What about the one
where the bride kisses the groom?

993
01:25:24,344 --> 01:25:25,368
Yeah.

994
01:25:26,212 --> 01:25:28,908
I never knew you were
such a hound for publicity.

995
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:32,349
Publicity? I don't even care
if there's no film in their cameras.

996
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:34,046
All right, here we go.

997
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,109
Hold it.

998
01:25:36,156 --> 01:25:37,248
Okay.

999
01:25:38,224 --> 01:25:40,215
A girl's got to breathe.

1000
01:25:40,293 --> 01:25:42,659
- The best of luck to you, Lou.
- Thanks, Babe.

1001
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:44,629
You'll get a great play on these pictures.

1002
01:25:44,697 --> 01:25:47,359
The day that Lou won
all three American championships.

1003
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:48,628
Batting average, home runs...

1004
01:25:48,701 --> 01:25:51,465
He's got it wrong. This is the day I got married.

1005
01:25:51,838 --> 01:25:54,602
- Come on, let's get this.
- That's a good one.

1006
01:25:58,411 --> 01:26:00,311
You've got to forgive me. I was held up.

1007
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:03,076
The boss had a brainstorm.
He gabbled for two hours.

1008
01:26:03,149 --> 01:26:06,141
Finally I said,
"Look, Boss, this is Lou Gehrig's birthday.

1009
01:26:06,219 --> 01:26:09,120
"I'm master of ceremonies, so good-bye."

1010
01:26:09,189 --> 01:26:10,520
How are you anyway?

1011
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:13,684
- I suppose Lou is sore at me?
- I wouldn't know.

1012
01:26:15,361 --> 01:26:17,659
What's going on here? Where is Lou?

1013
01:26:17,864 --> 01:26:19,855
I was hoping he was with you.

1014
01:26:19,933 --> 01:26:21,992
With me? Did he say...

1015
01:26:23,169 --> 01:26:25,364
I did see him after the game, he...

1016
01:26:26,606 --> 01:26:28,335
What time was that?

1017
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:33,268
It was kinda late.
You see, we hung around for a while.

1018
01:26:36,816 --> 01:26:38,875
What did he say when he telephoned?

1019
01:26:40,854 --> 01:26:42,617
He didn't telephone.

1020
01:26:43,389 --> 01:26:47,223
He was probably detained somewhere.
Maybe something important.

1021
01:26:47,293 --> 01:26:48,555
No doubt.

1022
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:50,891
Now, don't be like that.

1023
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:53,056
You don't know how lucky you are.

1024
01:26:53,133 --> 01:26:55,533
Most women, when their husband's late,
have to worry.

1025
01:26:55,602 --> 01:26:58,298
They're either drunk
or run into a dame or something.

1026
01:26:58,438 --> 01:27:02,602
But you and Lou, why,
all you've got to do is sit pretty and smile.

1027
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:07,203
I'll bet this is the first time he's late
since he's been married.

1028
01:27:07,814 --> 01:27:09,907
This is the fourth time, Sam.

1029
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:15,685
That's nothing. Four times in 10 weeks.
That's perfectly understandable.

1030
01:27:16,623 --> 01:27:18,682
Have you tried calling up anywhere?

1031
01:27:18,892 --> 01:27:21,258
I don't have to call up. I know where he is.

1032
01:27:21,661 --> 01:27:25,062
Don't talk like that.
You know Lou is true-blue.

1033
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:27,258
- That's what you think.
- Don't get hysterical.

1034
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:29,893
- Things like this happen all the...
- I'm not hysterical.

1035
01:27:29,969 --> 01:27:33,803
I'm perfectly controlled.
I've just learned to face the facts.

1036
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:35,908
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get him.

1037
01:27:35,975 --> 01:27:37,943
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

1038
01:27:38,011 --> 01:27:39,103
I tell you, you're wrong.

1039
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:42,148
There's some explanation
that doesn't appear on the surface.

1040
01:27:46,486 --> 01:27:49,319
- You know where he is?
- Yes.

1041
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,516
- You sure?
- Yes.

1042
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,693
- How'd you find out?
- I caught him.

1043
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:59,426
I don't believe it. I can't believe it.

1044
01:27:59,532 --> 01:28:02,126
You got to go back.
You can't walk in on him like this.

1045
01:28:02,202 --> 01:28:03,191
Yes, I can.

1046
01:28:03,269 --> 01:28:06,568
You can't make a scandal.
Think of the fans and how they'll feel.

1047
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,470
I can't, I'm too selfish.

1048
01:28:08,775 --> 01:28:11,505
It almost kills my faith in human nature.

1049
01:28:12,478 --> 01:28:13,877
Lou Gehrig.

1050
01:28:15,648 --> 01:28:17,775
A guy with a wife like you.

1051
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:20,776
Pal or no pal...

1052
01:28:20,853 --> 01:28:24,619
...I'm going to take a baseball bat
and bust his skull wide open.

1053
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:27,449
I'm gonna make him wish
he was never born.

1054
01:28:28,328 --> 01:28:31,422
I'm gonna hound that guy
for the rest of his life.

1055
01:28:33,633 --> 01:28:35,726
Strike three. You're out.

1056
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:47,140
Well, of all the dirty, low-down tricks...

1057
01:28:47,213 --> 01:28:50,114
You almost made me
have a nervous breakdown.

1058
01:28:52,919 --> 01:28:56,548
- What's the score, Lou?
- 23 to 22, end of the ninth.

1059
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:58,352
Three men on bases.

1060
01:29:01,427 --> 01:29:03,088
He'll be right along now.

1061
01:29:03,162 --> 01:29:05,824
Don't talk to me, you Borgia.

1062
01:29:33,393 --> 01:29:34,883
Dad was right.

1063
01:29:35,361 --> 01:29:37,693
He knew a ballplayer when he saw one.

1064
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:42,862
When you said that, the Chicago Rathskeller
jumped right up in my lap.

1065
01:29:43,469 --> 01:29:46,563
- That wasn't yesterday, was it, Tanglefoot?
- No.

1066
01:29:47,073 --> 01:29:50,008
I sure didn't know
what I was walking into that day.

1067
01:29:50,376 --> 01:29:52,810
"Mr. Gehrig, meet Miss Twitchell."

1068
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:56,107
And I left my little world behind me.

1069
01:29:56,849 --> 01:29:59,079
Your world? What do you mean?

1070
01:29:59,385 --> 01:30:03,754
Baseball life is so different.
Sort of a little world all by itself.

1071
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:09,421
You play it in the spring, summer, and fall,
and talk about it in the winter.

1072
01:30:09,495 --> 01:30:13,727
- You really eat, drink, and sleep it.
- Yes, you have had a dish of it.

1073
01:30:19,906 --> 01:30:23,069
- Here it is, spring again.
- Some spring.

1074
01:30:23,142 --> 01:30:26,509
Spring for a ballplayer. Florida next week again.

1075
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,738
Look, how's this?

1076
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:33,584
These spring training trips
must be kind of dull for a girl.

1077
01:30:33,653 --> 01:30:36,486
How about you passing up
Florida this spring?

1078
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,922
Take a little vacation for yourself.

1079
01:30:40,593 --> 01:30:42,083
All right.

1080
01:30:42,161 --> 01:30:45,255
It's been a long time
since you've palled around with the team.

1081
01:30:45,465 --> 01:30:47,763
Give you a little vacation, too.

1082
01:30:48,301 --> 01:30:51,737
- We have seen a lot of each other.
- Yes, it's an idea.

1083
01:30:52,672 --> 01:30:54,037
Yes, it is.

1084
01:30:57,944 --> 01:31:02,540
- You don't want to stay here, do you?
- You don't want to go without me, do you?

1085
01:31:23,403 --> 01:31:24,893
The winner.

1086
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:29,499
You just handed me my next story
on a silver platter.

1087
01:31:29,575 --> 01:31:32,100
- How I Beat My Wife by Lou Gehrig.
- Nix.

1088
01:31:32,178 --> 01:31:34,237
- It's a piparoo.
- Over my dead body.

1089
01:31:34,313 --> 01:31:37,077
- It'll kill 'em.
- Lay off our private life.

1090
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:40,051
- Then, what'll I write about?
- About half a column.

1091
01:31:40,486 --> 01:31:45,219
If I was in the Sahara Desert,
dying of thirst, you'd bring me vinegar.

1092
01:31:45,391 --> 01:31:47,018
I'll see you at the ballpark.

1093
01:31:47,093 --> 01:31:48,185
Hey.

1094
01:31:49,562 --> 01:31:51,154
That's dirty pool.

1095
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:03,341
Why didn't you want Sam
to write about your private life?

1096
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:08,580
Because that's something
that belongs to just the two of us.

1097
01:32:09,682 --> 01:32:13,015
It's been a pretty good,
little old private life at that, hasn't it?

1098
01:32:13,085 --> 01:32:15,519
Even though we never had a honeymoon?

1099
01:32:16,556 --> 01:32:18,854
We've never had anything else.

1100
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:35,398
Hey. What's the idea?
You want a bust in the nose?

1101
01:32:35,475 --> 01:32:38,774
Just trying to clean up
some of that poison pen stuff of yours.

1102
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,837
Look at that,
"Gehrig's accidental home run yesterday."

1103
01:32:41,914 --> 01:32:44,940
- I'm writing what Babe thinks.
- You don't need paper for that.

1104
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:48,214
You can write all the Babe ever thought
on a piece of confetti.

1105
01:32:48,287 --> 01:32:52,485
That was pretty brainy, I suppose,
having Gehrig call Ruth "the Ex-King of Swat."

1106
01:32:52,558 --> 01:32:54,492
That's facts. Gehrig's writing facts.

1107
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,154
Ruth will show you some facts
in his column tomorrow.

1108
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,994
Any facts Ruth dreams up
will be topped by Lou Gehrig...

1109
01:33:00,066 --> 01:33:02,398
...without borrowing your opium pipe.

1110
01:33:15,114 --> 01:33:16,479
Come in.

1111
01:33:19,318 --> 01:33:22,185
- These just came, Mrs. Gehrig.
- Thank you.

1112
01:35:35,721 --> 01:35:38,019
Just like the kind Mom used to try to make.

1113
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:41,423
It's Mom's recipe, as if you didn't know it.

1114
01:35:41,761 --> 01:35:43,194
Anybody home?

1115
01:35:43,896 --> 01:35:46,660
- Hello, Ellie. Hello, Lou.
- Hello, Pop.

1116
01:35:46,732 --> 01:35:48,063
- Hello, Lou.
- Mom.

1117
01:35:48,134 --> 01:35:51,797
- Eating breakfast?
- Lou's been raving about your recipe, Mom.

1118
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,305
Don't let him eat too many, he'll get fat.

1119
01:35:54,373 --> 01:35:57,206
What if I do? Then I can quit baseball.

1120
01:35:57,410 --> 01:36:00,902
- What?
- Quit baseball? Louie, are you crazy?

1121
01:36:01,347 --> 01:36:04,646
I've always had a hankering
to go in for engineering, you know that.

1122
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,082
Engineering.

1123
01:36:06,152 --> 01:36:10,282
The best ballplayer in the world
would waste his time like that.

1124
01:36:10,356 --> 01:36:14,690
- Lou always told me his Uncle Otto...
- Uncle Otto, Schmotto.

1125
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,593
Digging ditches, that's all he ever did.

1126
01:36:17,663 --> 01:36:19,688
The world is full of Ottos.

1127
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:22,429
But how many Lou Gehrigs are there?

1128
01:36:22,501 --> 01:36:27,131
Look at him, eating flapjacks
on the most important day of his life.

1129
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:28,737
Important?

1130
01:36:28,808 --> 01:36:31,971
Don't tell me you have forgotten what day this is?

1131
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:33,677
My birthday? No.

1132
01:36:35,347 --> 01:36:40,284
- Ellie, I haven't forgotten?
- No. It's not my birthday, either.

1133
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:42,280
Or Mom's or Pop's.

1134
01:36:42,354 --> 01:36:45,949
- It's not our wedding anniversary.
- I'm surprised at you, Ellie.

1135
01:36:46,025 --> 01:36:50,985
Today is the day Lou Gehrig is playing
his 2,000th consecutive baseball game.

1136
01:36:51,063 --> 01:36:53,395
- So what?
- What?

1137
01:36:55,301 --> 01:36:59,237
Look at him. Pretending he don't care.

1138
01:36:59,638 --> 01:37:02,937
I've got an idea.
What do you say you miss today's game?

1139
01:37:03,008 --> 01:37:05,067
You've gone crazy maybe.

1140
01:37:05,144 --> 01:37:06,304
No, don't you see?

1141
01:37:06,378 --> 01:37:10,178
It's no news when Lou's in the lineup,
the real news is if he misses a game.

1142
01:37:10,249 --> 01:37:12,774
- Man bites dog.
- That's right.

1143
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:19,356
Stop joking and come on, get a wiggle on you.

1144
01:37:19,425 --> 01:37:23,452
The ballpark will be crowded,
and the fans will give you an automobile.

1145
01:37:23,529 --> 01:37:25,895
Why an automobile?
Maybe they will give him a yacht.

1146
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:29,366
An automobile or a yacht,
or the Statue of Liberty. I'd better go.

1147
01:37:29,435 --> 01:37:31,562
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.

1148
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:34,504
But I warn you,
all you'll get is a horseshoe of roses.

1149
01:37:34,573 --> 01:37:36,040
Don't be so cynical.

1150
01:37:36,108 --> 01:37:39,976
- "Good luck, Lou Gehrig," on a ribbon.
- You don't appreciate Lou's importance.

1151
01:37:40,045 --> 01:37:43,242
- They'll give him an automobile at least.
- I say a yacht.

1152
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:47,411
You don't appreciate my importance.
I'm going to get an automobile or a yacht.

1153
01:37:47,486 --> 01:37:51,320
If you insist, but you'll come home
with a horseshoe of roses!

1154
01:38:04,069 --> 01:38:05,331
Safe!

1155
01:38:23,055 --> 01:38:26,183
Why don't he bunt?
What's the matter with him?

1156
01:38:26,725 --> 01:38:30,388
- Three runs behind, and you want to bunt.
- The unexpected, Mom.

1157
01:38:30,462 --> 01:38:33,898
- Get onto yourself!
- He should wait him out.

1158
01:38:34,233 --> 01:38:37,293
The pitcher has been missing
the corners since the sixth inning.

1159
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:40,861
If that's true, why don't you tell McCarthy
how to run his job?

1160
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:42,237
Shut up.

1161
01:38:42,308 --> 01:38:46,938
McCarthy is going great today.
He has pulled three boners I know of.

1162
01:38:47,313 --> 01:38:50,043
How would you like to shut up yourself?

1163
01:38:50,115 --> 01:38:52,549
Say, why don't you both shut up?

1164
01:38:54,119 --> 01:38:56,280
Strike three. You're out!

1165
01:39:12,004 --> 01:39:13,335
What, no automobile?

1166
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:18,475
No yacht?

1167
01:39:26,385 --> 01:39:29,411
I was lucky to get away with my life.
I struck out three times.

1168
01:39:29,488 --> 01:39:32,321
The last time, in the ninth,
with the bases full.

1169
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:58,013
If I had my way, darling,
I'd give you the Yankee Stadium.

1170
01:39:59,685 --> 01:40:03,849
I wanted to knock a home run for you today,
but maybe I tried too hard.

1171
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:14,489
"Good luck, Lou Gehrig."

1172
01:40:17,169 --> 01:40:19,364
If they only knew what I know.

1173
01:40:19,705 --> 01:40:23,732
If they only realized what lies back
of those 2,000 games you've played.

1174
01:40:24,944 --> 01:40:28,209
This is for the time in Chicago
you got beaned and went on playing.

1175
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,407
This for having brown eyes!

1176
01:40:30,482 --> 01:40:34,282
That's for when you played 12 innings
in St. Louis with a broken toe.

1177
01:40:34,353 --> 01:40:36,878
Here's for being the greatest fan a man ever had.

1178
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:40,720
That's for when you had 103 fever
and played a double-header.

1179
01:40:40,793 --> 01:40:43,193
Here's for sitting up all night and curing me.

1180
01:40:43,262 --> 01:40:45,696
Here's for when you had the flu
and wouldn't quit.

1181
01:40:45,764 --> 01:40:47,857
Here's for not letting me quit.

1182
01:40:47,933 --> 01:40:52,233
This is for all the times you've had
broken fingers and not told me about it.

1183
01:40:52,604 --> 01:40:55,300
Here's for putting up with me all these years!

1184
01:41:22,501 --> 01:41:26,801
<i>I've won fair and square. Don't try to pretend...</i>

1185
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,632
What is it?

1186
01:41:34,246 --> 01:41:36,942
I must have sprained my shoulder or something.

1187
01:41:38,484 --> 01:41:42,147
It felt kind of stiff at the game.
Maybe that's why I struck out.

1188
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:45,652
I'll get the liniment.

1189
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:25,658
That's the one, there.

1190
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:31,361
Here we go.

1191
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:33,462
On the hustle. Come on, babe.

1192
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:39,643
That's the one.

1193
01:42:46,251 --> 01:42:48,913
Those kids don't know what to do
with their speed.

1194
01:42:49,621 --> 01:42:52,647
- Lucky you got out of the way so quick.
- Yeah.

1195
01:43:03,902 --> 01:43:04,994
Bill.

1196
01:43:05,504 --> 01:43:07,563
What's the matter with Lou?

1197
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:15,974
You're out.

1198
01:43:19,418 --> 01:43:21,886
I certainly came down here
like an old ice wagon.

1199
01:43:21,954 --> 01:43:25,117
- That should have been a hit, easy.
- They can't all be hits.

1200
01:43:25,190 --> 01:43:27,385
I tell you, maybe you're trying too hard.

1201
01:43:27,459 --> 01:43:28,926
You can't try too hard.

1202
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:32,020
Why don't you hit the shower,
and take the rest of the day off?

1203
01:43:32,097 --> 01:43:34,327
No. I need a lot of work.

1204
01:43:56,755 --> 01:43:59,588
The old man made it, six times around.

1205
01:44:00,626 --> 01:44:04,619
It's worse than being a golf widow,
waiting for your husband to run around a park.

1206
01:44:04,696 --> 01:44:06,425
I'm sorry to be so long.

1207
01:44:06,498 --> 01:44:08,693
- So, I'm slowing up?
- Sure.

1208
01:44:08,767 --> 01:44:11,065
I'll get a wheelchair and push you around.

1209
01:44:16,008 --> 01:44:18,374
What an exhibition. You call that baseball?

1210
01:44:18,443 --> 01:44:20,809
Gehrig booted the game.
Threw it down the drain.

1211
01:44:20,879 --> 01:44:22,744
That's a batting champion for you.

1212
01:44:22,814 --> 01:44:25,442
- Did you see him swing like an old lady?
- It's criminal.

1213
01:44:25,517 --> 01:44:27,747
They ought to give you your money back.

1214
01:44:38,363 --> 01:44:40,058
That game was just booted away.

1215
01:44:40,132 --> 01:44:42,498
I got better support than that
in the bush leagues.

1216
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:43,728
Shut up.

1217
01:44:43,802 --> 01:44:46,396
I can't pitch and play first base, too.

1218
01:44:46,471 --> 01:44:49,872
That old man on first ought to have
some crutches to get around with.

1219
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:03,577
What goes on here?

1220
01:45:04,723 --> 01:45:06,520
Just talked out of turn.

1221
01:45:10,495 --> 01:45:12,725
Save the fight for the field, boys.

1222
01:46:44,856 --> 01:46:47,848
You watch, Gehrig will come back.
He always does.

1223
01:46:47,926 --> 01:46:52,363
<i>Every ballplayer has a slump eventually,
but in this case, it isn't just a slump.</i>

1224
01:46:52,431 --> 01:46:54,262
<i>It's obviously a breakdown.</i>

1225
01:46:54,333 --> 01:46:56,528
- That's a lie.
- A dirty lie.

1226
01:46:56,601 --> 01:47:01,732
No, sir, he ain't through.
I tell you, Mr. Gehrig can't be through.

1227
01:47:01,807 --> 01:47:05,334
Gehrig'll come back.
He's made of iron. You wait and see.

1228
01:47:05,410 --> 01:47:09,938
15 years, then all of a sudden, he goes sour.
What's the answer?

1229
01:47:10,015 --> 01:47:12,950
Gehrig must be having trouble with his teeth.

1230
01:48:10,876 --> 01:48:12,138
Get back.

1231
01:48:20,886 --> 01:48:22,410
Strike two.

1232
01:48:31,229 --> 01:48:32,753
Strike three.

1233
01:48:56,388 --> 01:48:57,446
Joe.

1234
01:48:58,223 --> 01:49:00,555
You'd better send someone in for me.

1235
01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:03,550
I can't make it anymore.

1236
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:08,096
You sure you want it that way?

1237
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:09,258
Yup.

1238
01:49:12,537 --> 01:49:15,563
Dahlgren, get in there at first.

1239
01:49:21,446 --> 01:49:23,311
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1240
01:49:41,566 --> 01:49:43,966
<i>Your attention, please!</i>

1241
01:49:44,636 --> 01:49:46,365
<i>Dahlgren...</i>

1242
01:49:46,838 --> 01:49:50,638
<i>... now playing first base for New York...</i>

1243
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:54,577
<i>... replacing Gehrig.</i>

1244
01:50:01,052 --> 01:50:03,520
2,130 games.

1245
01:50:04,356 --> 01:50:05,880
14 years.

1246
01:50:17,402 --> 01:50:18,767
Play ball!

1247
01:50:41,728 --> 01:50:43,593
It's a routine, I'm telling you.

1248
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:45,858
In a place like this,
they give you the x-ray...

1249
01:50:45,932 --> 01:50:50,028
...the cardiograph, the metabolism,
the fluoroscope, the works.

1250
01:50:51,004 --> 01:50:53,598
Then they're liable to tell you got dandruff.

1251
01:50:53,673 --> 01:50:56,164
It's happened time and again.
A friend came here...

1252
01:50:56,242 --> 01:50:58,267
Got any chewing gum, Sam?

1253
01:51:02,982 --> 01:51:05,280
Had a talk with the doctor the other day.

1254
01:51:05,351 --> 01:51:08,184
He said he never ran up against
a better physical specimen.

1255
01:51:08,254 --> 01:51:10,279
Strong as an ox, he said you were.

1256
01:51:11,357 --> 01:51:15,418
Talked to the x-ray guy, too.
What a send-off he gave you.

1257
01:51:15,862 --> 01:51:19,093
Heart okay, lungs okay, everything okay.

1258
01:51:19,499 --> 01:51:21,194
I'll bet you...

1259
01:51:22,101 --> 01:51:23,728
Here's the doc.

1260
01:51:27,874 --> 01:51:29,205
How did I do, Doctor?

1261
01:51:29,275 --> 01:51:32,142
I'm afraid you'll have to
give up baseball for a while.

1262
01:51:32,211 --> 01:51:35,271
- You see, Mr. Gehrig...
- Go ahead, Doc.

1263
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:39,718
I'm a man who likes to know his batting average.

1264
01:51:39,786 --> 01:51:42,914
I've only made a superficial examination
of the tests.

1265
01:51:42,989 --> 01:51:45,822
We shall need some new x-rays.

1266
01:51:49,829 --> 01:51:52,855
Give it to me straight, Doc.
Am I through with baseball?

1267
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:55,065
I'm afraid so.

1268
01:51:57,770 --> 01:51:59,237
Any worse than that?

1269
01:52:00,406 --> 01:52:03,773
You heard what the doc said.
He's got to go over the tests again.

1270
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:08,140
Is it three strikes, Doc?

1271
01:52:08,915 --> 01:52:10,542
You want it straight?

1272
01:52:10,983 --> 01:52:12,416
Sure I do, straight.

1273
01:52:13,152 --> 01:52:14,585
It's three strikes.

1274
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:20,818
Doc, I've learned one thing.

1275
01:52:22,095 --> 01:52:25,929
All the arguing in the world
can't change the decision of the umpire.

1276
01:52:29,368 --> 01:52:31,393
How much time have I got?

1277
01:52:34,307 --> 01:52:35,638
Pardon me.

1278
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:40,435
<i>- Yes?
- Mrs. Gehrig is waiting.</i>

1279
01:52:41,948 --> 01:52:43,745
Have her come up, please.

1280
01:52:47,086 --> 01:52:49,646
I don't want Mrs. Gehrig to know, ever.

1281
01:52:49,722 --> 01:52:51,189
I understand.

1282
01:52:51,724 --> 01:52:54,659
- But the newspapers...
- Sam here can take care of that.

1283
01:52:54,727 --> 01:52:56,718
- Can't you, Sam?
- Sure. I will.

1284
01:52:56,796 --> 01:52:59,560
Leave it to me. I'll cook up something...

1285
01:53:01,134 --> 01:53:02,567
Hi, Ellie.

1286
01:53:04,904 --> 01:53:07,202
Darling, the verdict's in.

1287
01:53:07,473 --> 01:53:11,273
I'm not such a bad ballplayer.
I've really got something, haven't I?

1288
01:53:12,345 --> 01:53:13,471
What is it?

1289
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:17,443
I'd be cured by the time
I could learn to pronounce it.

1290
01:53:18,151 --> 01:53:22,520
- Can you pronounce it, Doctor?
- We really haven't concluded all our tests.

1291
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,718
Excuse me.

1292
01:53:29,195 --> 01:53:31,527
<i>- Yes?
- X-ray room is ready, Doctor.</i>

1293
01:53:31,597 --> 01:53:32,689
Thank you.

1294
01:53:33,232 --> 01:53:35,427
Just one more picture, Mr. Gehrig.

1295
01:53:35,635 --> 01:53:38,866
Just one more for the record, Doc?
Right back, Ellie.

1296
01:53:45,378 --> 01:53:48,279
You'll never get all the pictures
of Lou into that scrapbook.

1297
01:53:48,347 --> 01:53:50,178
You'd think he was a glamour boy.

1298
01:53:50,349 --> 01:53:52,044
What did the doctor tell Lou?

1299
01:53:52,385 --> 01:53:54,376
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1300
01:53:54,554 --> 01:53:58,012
Some little thing with a long name.
Some kind of an "itis," I don't know.

1301
01:53:58,491 --> 01:54:01,426
He'll have to lay off for a while. So what?

1302
01:54:01,494 --> 01:54:04,122
He'll be back next season, or the season after.

1303
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:06,430
Tell me the truth, Sam.

1304
01:54:07,099 --> 01:54:10,660
I am telling the truth, honest.
I'd swear on a stack of Bibles.

1305
01:54:10,736 --> 01:54:12,636
You heard what the doctor said.

1306
01:54:18,811 --> 01:54:20,642
When is Lou going to die?

1307
01:54:26,919 --> 01:54:30,184
- Who told you?
- Nobody had to tell me.

1308
01:54:31,123 --> 01:54:33,318
I could read it in your eyes.

1309
01:54:33,526 --> 01:54:35,084
All of you.

1310
01:54:38,497 --> 01:54:40,624
It's all right, Sam.

1311
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:43,828
I'll never let him know I know.

1312
01:54:47,173 --> 01:54:50,870
He's so young yet, so strong, and...

1313
01:56:19,231 --> 01:56:22,166
Ladies and gentlemen.

1314
01:56:25,271 --> 01:56:28,104
Lemonade, peanuts, and popcorn.

1315
01:56:28,174 --> 01:56:31,666
Given away free today
in honor of the great Lou Gehrig.

1316
01:56:36,749 --> 01:56:40,480
Bulletin.
Gehrig Day not a farewell but a come-on.

1317
01:56:40,553 --> 01:56:42,953
A ballyhoo to get more money out of the Yanks...

1318
01:56:43,022 --> 01:56:45,547
...when Gehrig comes back
to the game next season.

1319
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:53,927
Know what? We're gonna knock 'em dead
when we come back.

1320
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:57,565
Do you think we can get $50,000
out of those tightwads?

1321
01:56:57,636 --> 01:56:59,900
Not a cent under $100,000.

1322
01:56:59,972 --> 01:57:04,102
It stands to reason,
you'll be twice as good after you've had a rest.

1323
01:57:04,176 --> 01:57:05,302
You know...

1324
01:57:05,378 --> 01:57:09,246
...we've never had a honeymoon.
Why shouldn't we have one now?

1325
01:57:09,715 --> 01:57:13,845
Sure. Better late than never.
What about Niagara Falls?

1326
01:57:13,919 --> 01:57:17,047
Sure. Then we could go up
to northern Canada and go fishing.

1327
01:57:17,123 --> 01:57:20,456
I've been thinking maybe
we could take a trip around the world.

1328
01:57:20,526 --> 01:57:23,051
All the things we've never had time for before.

1329
01:57:23,229 --> 01:57:25,527
We've all the time in the world now, haven't we?

1330
01:57:25,598 --> 01:57:28,066
We've got all the time in the world now.

1331
01:57:29,001 --> 01:57:31,469
You're a scream in that moustache.

1332
01:57:34,306 --> 01:57:35,671
What's that?

1333
01:57:37,643 --> 01:57:39,304
Take it out and see.

1334
01:57:41,781 --> 01:57:43,043
Open it.

1335
01:57:51,891 --> 01:57:55,156
I had that made up
of some of the hardware I've collected.

1336
01:57:56,228 --> 01:57:57,786
Like it?

1337
01:58:00,966 --> 01:58:02,695
I adore it.

1338
01:58:06,906 --> 01:58:09,670
I remember when you got
every one of these medals.

1339
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:13,044
That's the one I got the most kick out of.

1340
01:58:13,112 --> 01:58:16,445
The batting championship I won
the year we were married.

1341
01:58:18,984 --> 01:58:20,474
Here, Ellie.

1342
01:58:21,087 --> 01:58:23,248
I've got a right to cry a little.

1343
01:58:23,923 --> 01:58:25,948
It's such a beautiful thing.

1344
01:58:29,328 --> 01:58:31,853
I wanted you to have it...

1345
01:58:32,998 --> 01:58:35,228
...because you've given me so much.

1346
01:58:36,669 --> 01:58:39,900
<i>You've been so...</i>

1347
01:58:43,375 --> 01:58:48,142
- Are you making love to me, you big ape?
- You bet I am, you dope.

1348
01:58:55,754 --> 01:58:57,187
Gehrig Day program.

1349
01:59:09,835 --> 01:59:11,496
It's Lou Gehrig.

1350
01:59:14,707 --> 01:59:16,800
Look. There's Lou Gehrig.

1351
01:59:16,876 --> 01:59:20,175
Right this way, Mr. Gehrig. Give him room.

1352
01:59:20,246 --> 01:59:22,407
- Stand back.
- Hello, Lou, old boy.

1353
01:59:22,481 --> 01:59:25,382
- When are you coming back, Lou?
- We sure miss you.

1354
01:59:25,451 --> 01:59:26,918
Mr. Gehrig, please.

1355
01:59:31,590 --> 01:59:33,615
Don't you remember me?

1356
01:59:35,694 --> 01:59:38,959
You knocked out two home runs for me
one afternoon.

1357
01:59:43,068 --> 01:59:45,002
Sure. I remember you.

1358
01:59:45,070 --> 01:59:47,402
- How are you?
- Just great.

1359
01:59:48,407 --> 01:59:52,673
I've been waiting here all afternoon
because I had to tell you something.

1360
01:59:52,878 --> 01:59:56,109
I just got in town today, and I had to tell you.

1361
01:59:57,249 --> 01:59:59,046
I did what you said.

1362
01:59:59,852 --> 02:00:03,310
I tried hard, and I made it.

1363
02:00:06,492 --> 02:00:08,824
Look, I can walk.

1364
02:00:14,266 --> 02:00:17,497
That's great work, kid.

1365
02:00:18,103 --> 02:00:19,764
That's wonderful.

1366
02:00:23,776 --> 02:00:26,973
- Have you got a ticket for the game?
- Yes, sir, you bet.

1367
02:00:29,481 --> 02:00:32,109
- So long.
- So long.

1368
02:00:42,795 --> 02:00:45,696
62,000 people have jammed the Yankee Stadium...

1369
02:00:45,764 --> 02:00:50,428
...to pay tribute to a man who, for 16 years,
has given everything that's in him.

1370
02:00:50,503 --> 02:00:53,734
Never in baseball has there been
such a spontaneous demonstration...

1371
02:00:53,806 --> 02:00:55,774
...of love and affection for one man.

1372
02:00:55,841 --> 02:00:58,241
<i>He's known as "Larruping Lou"
and "The Iron Horse."</i>

1373
02:00:58,310 --> 02:01:01,802
<i>No matter what, he'll never be forgotten.
Nor will his great records.</i>

1374
02:01:01,881 --> 02:01:03,712
<i>They'll never forget his greatest record.</i>

1375
02:01:03,782 --> 02:01:07,013
<i>His amazing feat of playing
2,130 consecutive ball games...</i>

1376
02:01:07,086 --> 02:01:08,917
<i>... over a period of 16 years.</i>

1377
02:01:08,988 --> 02:01:12,424
<i>Everyone is here to show him
just what they feel in their hearts.</i>

1378
02:01:12,491 --> 02:01:15,483
<i>To say hail and farewell
to the pride of the Yankees.</i>

1379
02:02:12,818 --> 02:02:14,786
The emotion on all sides is tremendous.

1380
02:02:14,853 --> 02:02:17,583
<i>Around home plate,
all the celebrities standing there.</i>

1381
02:02:17,656 --> 02:02:20,420
<i>The beginning of the ceremonies,
Joe McCarthy comes forward.</i>

1382
02:02:20,492 --> 02:02:24,360
<i>Hands Lou Gehrig a plaque.
On that plaque are two words. "Don't quit."</i>

1383
02:02:24,463 --> 02:02:27,125
<i>Nothing in Gehrig's nature was the quitter type.</i>

1384
02:02:27,399 --> 02:02:30,732
<i>McCarthy puts it down, turns around,
receives a trophy and in turn...</i>

1385
02:02:30,803 --> 02:02:32,600
<i>... gives that trophy to Lou Gehrig.</i>

1386
02:02:32,671 --> 02:02:36,607
<i>The trophy is a trophy from the Yankees,
the teammates of Gehrig.</i>

1387
02:02:36,675 --> 02:02:40,577
<i>Here comes the mayor of New York City.
Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia.</i>

1388
02:02:40,646 --> 02:02:44,776
<i>LaGuardia addresses a few words,
perhaps what Gehrig has meant to this city.</i>

1389
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:48,911
<i>LaGuardia turns around, extends his hand,
and shakes hands with Lou.</i>

1390
02:02:48,988 --> 02:02:52,355
<i>Gehrig visibly impressed
with all this demonstration of affection.</i>

1391
02:02:52,424 --> 02:02:55,018
<i>Postmaster General of the United States,
Jim Farley.</i>

1392
02:02:55,094 --> 02:02:58,894
<i>Farley shakes Gehrig's hand,
Gehrig again trying to manage a smile.</i>

1393
02:02:58,964 --> 02:03:02,491
<i>Now, Babe Ruth, the Sultan of Swat.
Babe talks into the microphone.</i>

1394
02:03:02,568 --> 02:03:05,901
<i>Praise from the man who preceded
Lou Gehrig in the batting order.</i>

1395
02:03:05,971 --> 02:03:08,735
<i>Babe walks over and puts his arms
around Gehrig's shoulders.</i>

1396
02:03:08,807 --> 02:03:11,970
<i>Here they are.
The heart of the Murderer's Row of the Yankees.</i>

1397
02:03:12,044 --> 02:03:13,568
<i>Gehrig with his eyes down.</i>

1398
02:03:13,646 --> 02:03:17,844
<i>Manager Joe McCarthy addresses some remarks,
drawing applause from the boys.</i>

1399
02:03:17,916 --> 02:03:21,682
<i>McCarthy walks over to Gehrig,
puts his hand affectionately on his shoulder...</i>

1400
02:03:21,754 --> 02:03:25,349
<i>... starts leading Lou Gehrig over
to a whole galaxy of microphones.</i>

1401
02:03:25,424 --> 02:03:28,951
<i>He'll be saying a few words.
This whole crowd in the stadium hopes so.</i>

1402
02:03:29,028 --> 02:03:32,464
<i>Gehrig stands at the microphones,
visibly impressed, all choked up.</i>

1403
02:03:32,471 --> 02:03:34,268
<i>Listen to that crowd!</i>

1404
02:04:10,976 --> 02:04:15,675
I have been walking on ball fields for 16 years...

1405
02:04:17,116 --> 02:04:20,142
... and I've never received anything but...

1406
02:04:20,219 --> 02:04:23,279
... kindness and encouragement...

1407
02:04:23,989 --> 02:04:25,650
... from you fans.

1408
02:04:30,129 --> 02:04:32,495
I have had the great honor...

1409
02:04:33,365 --> 02:04:35,265
... to have played...

1410
02:04:35,467 --> 02:04:39,733
... with these great veteran ballplayers on my left...

1411
02:04:41,507 --> 02:04:43,202
... Murderer's Row...

1412
02:04:45,244 --> 02:04:48,509
... our championship team of 1927.

1413
02:04:52,551 --> 02:04:57,011
I have had the further honor of living with...

1414
02:04:57,823 --> 02:05:01,418
... and playing with these men on my right...

1415
02:05:02,795 --> 02:05:05,764
... the Bronx Bombers, the Yankees of today.

1416
02:05:08,534 --> 02:05:10,263
I have been given...

1417
02:05:10,602 --> 02:05:14,732
... fame and undeserved praise...

1418
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:18,469
... by the boys up there
behind the wire in the press box...

1419
02:05:20,646 --> 02:05:23,171
<i>... my friends, the sportswriters.</i>

1420
02:05:26,085 --> 02:05:29,919
I have worked under
the two greatest managers of all time...

1421
02:05:30,289 --> 02:05:34,419
... Miller Huggins and Joe McCarthy.

1422
02:05:39,365 --> 02:05:42,198
I have a mother and father...

1423
02:05:45,137 --> 02:05:48,265
... who fought to give me health...

1424
02:05:50,542 --> 02:05:53,170
... and a solid background in my youth.

1425
02:05:57,349 --> 02:05:59,044
I have a wife...

1426
02:06:00,152 --> 02:06:02,347
... a companion for life...

1427
02:06:05,424 --> 02:06:08,552
<i>... who has shown me
more courage than I ever knew.</i>

1428
02:06:12,765 --> 02:06:16,496
People all say that I've had a bad break...

1429
02:06:18,370 --> 02:06:19,997
... but today...

1430
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:25,498
Today I consider myself...

1431
02:06:26,745 --> 02:06:30,909
... the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

1432
02:07:25,304 --> 02:07:26,794
<i>Play ball!</i>

1433
02:07:27,305 --> 02:08:27,932
