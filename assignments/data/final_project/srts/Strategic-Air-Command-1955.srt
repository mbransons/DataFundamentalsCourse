1
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,125
Bombers high

2
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:27,725
Riding the air

3
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:29,326
Every man

4
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:31,927
Doing his share

5
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:33,528
Men of war

6
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,529
Better beware

7
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:37,130
When the Air Force

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,330
Takes command

9
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,930
Bombers high

10
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:44,531
Ready we stand

11
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:45,933
Minutemen

12
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,534
Guarding the land

13
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:50,333
Thunder rides

14
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,334
Here in our hand

15
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:53,935
When the air force

16
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:56,536
Takes command

17
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:58,937
Our legions

18
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:00,937
Are legend

19
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:02,538
Our wings

20
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,139
Own the blue

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,739
With jets

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,540
Winding free

23
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,142
And men

24
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:14,342
Flying true

25
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:15,943
Ride the wind

26
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,544
Follow a star

27
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,145
Find the foe

28
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:22,746
Strike where they are

29
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:24,545
Round the world

30
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,546
Isn't too far

31
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:28,148
When the air force

32
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:33,149
Takes command

33
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,152
America today is watching her skies
with grave concern.

34
00:01:39,552 --> 00:01:43,153
For in these skies of peace,
the nation is building its defense.

35
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,954
To the officers and men of
The United States Air Force,

36
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:50,956
to The Strategic Air Command, whose
cooperation is gratefully acknowledged,

37
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:54,757
and to the young men
of America who will one day

38
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,558
take their places besides them, this
motion picture is dedicated.

39
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,767
Well, here we are.

40
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:25,567
An Elderly Parson, shouldn't yield
to temptation this way.

41
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:26,767
Oh, nonsense, Dad.

42
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:29,769
The sun will do you good.

43
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,370
Good morning.

44
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:58,179
Hi, darling!

45
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:05,781
Hey, that boy's good.

46
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:06,782
Who is he?

47
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:09,782
He's a rookie named Brewster.
Just up from Columbus.

48
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:11,384
Hi, Joe. How am I doing, coach?

49
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,985
Well, you're comming along.

50
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:13,985
Coming along, huh?

51
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,362
This daughter of yours is kind
of hard to please, you know?

52
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,786
Say, how about that Brewster kid?
Doesn't he look sharp?

53
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:20,163
No. They ougth to play him at third.

54
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:21,363
He doesn't move well to the right.

55
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,987
You want him to take my job.

56
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:25,788
Oh!, in 3 or 4 years, perhaps.

57
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,988
He's young. He can wait.

58
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:27,989
Yeah, true.

59
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,189
What's going on now, Robert?

60
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,191
Intersquad game.
Reds against the blues.

61
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,992
I'm captain of the blues.
See you later.

62
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,999
Oh, that reminds me.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I forgot to give Dutch a message.

64
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,200
Some Air Force friend of
his named Rusty Castle

65
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,201
phoned and said he was comming over.

66
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,202
Oh, well, Dutch won't care much

67
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,403
one way or the other.

68
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:07,604
How do you know he won't?

69
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:08,803
Well, I just know.

70
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:11,204
He's and old war buddy of his,
a flyer or something,

71
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:12,204
and I know Dutch.

72
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:14,805
The last thing he wants
is to hass over old times.

73
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,407
You seem to know
you husband very well

74
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:18,807
considering the short time
you've been married.

75
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:21,609
Oh, I do! I know him like a book.

76
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:23,808
- Is that so surprising?
- Well, rather.

77
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:24,810
Why?

78
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,410
I've known your mother
for 30 years.

79
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,851
What I don't know about her
would fill a very large book.

80
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:33,012
Now, I'm just going to show you.

81
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,212
Brewster is comming to bat,

82
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:35,213
and Dutch likes him.

83
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,013
And the kid always hits
to the left.

84
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:38,614
Now, you just watch Dutch.

85
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,014
If he connects,

86
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:42,616
he's going to try to
make it look like a hit.

87
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:49,417
See what I mean?

88
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:52,419
Any more questions, Dr. Thorne?

89
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:04,823
Well, I guess we better go, Dad.

90
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:06,624
Good morning, reverend, Sally.

91
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:07,825
Hi, Tom.

92
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,305
Well, our boy looks pretty good.

93
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,026
Yes, he's coming along.

94
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:14,226
Can't you stay a while?

95
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:15,988
No, thank you. Dad has
to work on his sermon,

96
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:17,027
and I have to go home

97
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:18,428
and get ready for the housewarming.

98
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:21,229
You just stay here and watch
your livestock at work.

99
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,830
And pretty expensive livestock...

100
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,231
especially your husband.

101
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:27,431
Yes, well, feeding him is
no cinch, either, you know.

102
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:28,712
I'll see you later. Tom.
Bye-bye.

103
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:29,833
- Mrs. Holland?
- Yes.

104
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,633
I'm Rusty Castle.

105
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,033
Oh, yes, of course!

106
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,033
This is my father Dr. Thorne

107
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,434
and Mr. Doyle.

108
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:37,434
Hello, Mr. Doyle.

109
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,235
Well, I'm glad to meet you, General.

110
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:40,836
- General?
- Rusty!

111
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:42,436
Rusty, how are you?

112
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:43,237
Hello, Dutch.

113
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:44,637
Boy, am I glad to see you.

114
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:46,237
Hey, you're looking great.
How are you hitting them?

115
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:47,239
Oh, I'm getting in shape.

116
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,815
- Did you meet all these people?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:51,039
Why didn't you tell us
you were coming to town?

118
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,017
Well, see. I was over at
a staff meeting at MacDill...

119
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,640
Oh, General Castle did phone.

120
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,642
I haven't had a chance
to tell you. I'm sorry.

121
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,442
Oh! Oh, well, that's all right!

122
00:05:58,443 --> 00:05:59,819
When, you just got here
at the right time.

123
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,020
We're having a houseworming tonight.

124
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,164
How about staying over, huh?

125
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:02,844
Well, I...

126
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,444
- Oh, please do!
- Along, come on!

127
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:05,045
I'd be glad to.

128
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:06,244
Good.

129
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:07,046
Well, I've got to run, sweetheart,

130
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:08,246
and I'll see you later.

131
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:09,246
I'm awfully glad
you can stay, General.

132
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:10,447
Thanks, Mrs. Holland.

133
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:11,647
Goodbye, reverend.

134
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:14,047
Well, what do you know?
What's new, Rusty?

135
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:15,448
Well, come on, give me the lowdown.

136
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,248
That's just what I came to do, Dutch.

137
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:18,626
But I think it better
wait until later.

138
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,449
Oh? What, is something cooking?

139
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,851
Yeah, in a way.

140
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:22,851
Is that so?

141
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:24,051
Hey, Dutch, you're up!

142
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:26,653
Oh!, I'll see you later.

143
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,694
Dutch is pretty valuable
to the Cardinals,

144
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:31,853
Isn't he, Mr. Doyle?

145
00:06:31,854 --> 00:06:33,055
Valuable?

146
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:35,256
He drove in 152 runs last year.

147
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:38,056
He just signed a $70.000
a year contract.

148
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,256
We don't pay salaries like that

149
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:40,256
for fun, General.

150
00:06:40,257 --> 00:06:42,657
Yes, I can understand that.

151
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:45,258
Dutch was the best
B-29 commander I had.

152
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,259
Not many men with his
judgment, coordination,

153
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
and whatever else it takes

154
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:52,461
to come through in the pinches.

155
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,782
Why did you ask me that, General?

156
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,462
Why?

157
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:57,062
I was thinking...

158
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:58,663
He'd be just as valuable to S.A.C.

159
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:00,665
S.A.C? What's S.A.C.?

160
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:03,465
Strategic Air Command.

161
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,465
We're the Air Forces's
Global bombing outfit.

162
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,867
Oh. You're the boys
that dropped the A-Bomb?

163
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,468
Well, I hope not.

164
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:10,867
Our job is to be ready and able

165
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:12,468
to strike back anywhere in the world

166
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,068
if this country is ever attacked.

167
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,670
And quite a job you got there, General.

168
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,870
Yes, It's a big job, all right.

169
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,871
Our greatest problem
is personnel, Mr. Doyle.

170
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:24,872
We need mature, experienced
leaders in S.A.C.

171
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:25,873
Men like Dutch.

172
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:30,075
Are you trying to tell me they
want Dutch back in the Air Force?

173
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,676
That's exactly what
I'm trying to tell you, Mr Doyle.

174
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:35,276
Oh, boy!

175
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:40,077
Well, this is the craziest thing
I've ever heard of.

176
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:42,078
What do you want with a guy me age?

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,280
I haven't flown
and airplane in 6 years.

178
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,079
I've never even been close to a jet.

179
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,480
Look, Dutch, we don't need
young kids in S.A.C.

180
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:50,882
We need old hands
like you, experience.

181
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:52,083
Well, where's the fire?

182
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:54,282
I, I, I just don't see
the necessity.

183
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:56,083
You would if you were in my seat.

184
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,483
Look, do you realize

185
00:07:57,484 --> 00:07:59,461
that we're the only thing
that's keeping the peace?

186
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:01,886
By staying combat ready,
we can prevent a war.

187
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:04,086
Dutch, if I didn't beleave that,

188
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:06,088
If my commanders and crew
didn't believe that,

189
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:08,487
I couldn't get a single
airplane off the ground.

190
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,889
But I I've don't my share.

191
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,889
Doggone it, why do you
have to recall me?

192
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,491
I'm not recalling you, Dutch.
This wasn't my decision.

193
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:20,091
Believe me, I fell worse
about it than you do.

194
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:22,092
I asked you to take
that reserve commission

195
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:25,093
just as a gesture
for old time's sake.

196
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:26,494
I never thought the time would come.

197
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:28,094
All right, whose decision was this?

198
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:29,495
General Hawkes.

199
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:31,295
I even tried to talk him out of it,

200
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:34,297
but they're calling up everyone
in your reserve classification.

201
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:38,475
The General was adamant...
no exceptions.

202
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:39,698
I could talk to?

203
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,299
Sure, sure, but he's boss of S.A.C.

204
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,900
There are people who could fire him,

205
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:45,301
but I'll guarantee there's no one

206
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,701
Who could ever make him
change his decision.

207
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:50,503
Well, this is it, then, huh?

208
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,303
I report a week from tuesday?

209
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:53,703
That's right.

210
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:55,504
Your orders are on their way now...

211
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:56,905
21 months of active duty.

212
00:08:58,306 --> 00:08:59,505
21 months?

213
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,706
You, you realize
what this does to me?

214
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,307
I'm no youngster anymore.

215
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,308
I've got a few more good
years in baseball left.

216
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:06,709
No you take me away...

217
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:10,909
Look, Dutch, there's just
no point in arguing with me.

218
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,311
No, I guess not.

219
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:16,312
Your orders read report to
my headquarters at Carswell.

220
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,913
Yes, sir.

221
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:22,914
Well, I...

222
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:26,316
I guess I'd better be
running along, Dutch.

223
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,916
See you soon, huh?

224
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:33,118
Yes, General, I suppose you will.

225
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:50,924
Leaving, General?

226
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,124
Oh, yes!, I'm afraid
I have to, Mr. Doyle.

227
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,726
Would you please give my
apologies to Mrs. Holland?

228
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,130
Well?

229
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:11,531
Well, that's it...

230
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:12,531
21 months.

231
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:15,733
I have to report to Carswell
a week from tuesday.

232
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,933
Isn't there anyone we can go to?

233
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:20,535
Castle says it's no use.

234
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:23,536
Of course, you know
how I feel, Dutch.

235
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:24,735
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:27,136
What worries me most
is Sally, though.

237
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:29,337
Sally? Oh! I wouldn't worry
too much about her.

238
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,537
No, but I do.

239
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:32,938
This is going to be
an awfull wallop to her.

240
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,339
She's been fixing up the house.

241
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,140
She's getting a big kick
out of the ball club.

242
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,340
Now something like this happens.

243
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,740
What am I going to tell her?

244
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:41,942
Maybe it won't be
as hard as you think.

245
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,744
Well, just don't say anything
to her about it, will you?

246
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:48,744
She's worked so hard on this
housewarming and everything.

247
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:51,145
I just want her to have
this evening, huh?

248
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:52,146
I won't say a word.

249
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:54,267
I'll figure out some way
to break it to her later

250
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:55,947
when everybody's letf.
Come on!

251
00:10:57,548 --> 00:10:59,347
It was a lovely party, Sally.

252
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:00,948
And you look just radiant.

253
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:01,949
Thank you.

254
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,749
It's wonderful to see a young couple
so gay and happy, isn't it?

255
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,150
It certainly is, Mrs. Thorne.

256
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:07,350
Good night, Tom.

257
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:08,351
Good night, Sally.

258
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:11,353
Good night, Tom. I'll see you.

259
00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:15,554
Well...

260
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:18,155
It was just a wonderful party, Sally.

261
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:20,755
Thank you, sweetheart.

262
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:23,556
You know, we're going
to remenber this for a long time

263
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,358
our first housewarming.

264
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:27,157
That's the kind of thing
you don't forget, you know.

265
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:30,159
No. That's why I wanted
it to be just perfect.

266
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,960
It sure was.

267
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,161
Your mother seemed to have
a good time, didn't she?

268
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,360
Yes. She always does.

269
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,762
She's beginning to sound more
like a baseball fan every day.

270
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:42,203
Say, your dad had a drink
just to celebrate the occasion.

271
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:44,364
I know. I saw him.

272
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:46,165
Sally, would you...

273
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,565
let me have this a minute. I...

274
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:52,367
come over here and sit down.

275
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:58,768
- Dutch.
- Sally. What?

276
00:11:58,769 --> 00:11:59,969
There's something I have to tell you.

277
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,369
Well, what is it?

278
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,771
You're going back into the Air Force.

279
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:06,372
Tom told me this afternoon.

280
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:07,948
Well, that's what I've been trying to.

281
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:09,172
Well, what do you think?

282
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:11,774
Well, what do I think?
What do you think?

283
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:16,174
I don't care about this house.
Mother can take care of that.

284
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:19,576
We can sublet. That's no problem.

285
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:21,577
I certainly don't mind
missing the season

286
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:22,977
and losing all that money.

287
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:23,977
What?

288
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,578
No. I'm not a child.

289
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,979
Oh, honey, I know you're not a child.

290
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,781
And if you go, then
we both go on active duty.

291
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:33,781
Besides, what's wrong
with being an Air Force wife

292
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:36,583
and living in a barracks
or whatever you call them?

293
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:38,183
It migh be fun.

294
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:41,983
Anything you do is fine with me,

295
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:44,384
just so long as you don't
leave me behind.

296
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:46,785
You mean that?

297
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:48,386
Of course I do.

298
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:51,188
I married you, Dutch,
not a house room.

299
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,794
I'm lieutenant colonel Holland.
I'm reporting in for duty.

300
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:11,595
May I see your
identification, colonel?

301
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:16,996
I, I don't have an I.D. card.
They never sent me one.

302
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,396
I'm sorry, sir.

303
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,797
I can't admit a civilian
without identification.

304
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,598
I'm not a civilian!
I wish I was a civilian.

305
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:25,200
Here. Here are my orders.

306
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,601
Civilian.

307
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:34,803
Security officer?

308
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:36,603
Captain, I've got a man
here at the gate

309
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:38,403
with no identification card.

310
00:13:38,404 --> 00:13:40,004
His orders say that
he's on active duty,

311
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,406
but he's not in uniform.

312
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,406
Very well, sir.

313
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,608
You'll have to wait, sir, until
the security officer gets here.

314
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:52,208
Sergeant, if you'd just
call General Castle...

315
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:53,209
Hey.

316
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,411
Pull over. Pull over there, then.

317
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:18,818
General Castle, please.

318
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:22,819
May I speak to the General?

319
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,821
This is Dutch Holland...
Colonel Holland.

320
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:30,423
Well, as soon as you reach him,
would you tell him,

321
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:32,822
I'm having a little trouble
at the main gate?

322
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:35,824
That's right. I can't get in.

323
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:44,627
May I see your orders?

324
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:45,827
Oh, this whole thing's ridiculous.

325
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:47,829
And your driver's license.

326
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,029
There you are.

327
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,430
License expired.

328
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,031
It has?

329
00:14:57,032 --> 00:14:59,032
Are you Dutch Holland the ball player?

330
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,232
I was.

331
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,914
I've been reading about you.
You don't look much like your pictures.

332
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:07,635
Well, you don't look much like
your picture, either, Captain.

333
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:09,236
We had a phony one time.

334
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:10,636
Fella got on the base

335
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:13,038
With a pass that showed
a picture of an orangutan.

336
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,837
They had us all
on the carpet for that one.

337
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:18,039
No orangutans allowed?

338
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,642
I'm glad to see your men
are on the job, Captain.

339
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:28,842
That's be all.

340
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,844
Hello, Dutch, how are you?

341
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:34,044
I'm sorry you had so much trouble here,
but a uniform would help, you know.

342
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:37,245
Yeah, well, I left in such a hurry,
and muy old ones were the wrong color.

343
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:40,047
Yeah, well, that'll be easy.
I'll drop you off at the post exchage,

344
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:41,246
first stop.

345
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:42,247
OK.

346
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,650
Did Sally come with you?

347
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,851
No, She'll be here
as soon as I get squared away.

348
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,451
Good. I can get you a set
of quarters here on the base.

349
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,452
Fine.

350
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:06,656
"Control tower
calling General Castle".

351
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:09,256
Castle. Go ahead.

352
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:11,257
Sir, I've got a commercial DC-3

353
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:12,859
coming in for an emergency landing.

354
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,858
Why can't he land
at municipal airport?

355
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:16,459
He says he can't make it, sir.

356
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,260
All right, have the security
officer notified right away.

357
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:21,661
Affirmative, General.

358
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:23,662
Notify the security officer.

359
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:26,863
We're kind of particular
these days, Dutch.

360
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:29,464
All S.A.C. bases are restricted.

361
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:41,068
Alert the fire trucks and meet wagon.

362
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,868
Fire station,

363
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,269
we have an unidentified
DC-3 in the pattern,

364
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,670
landing at the present time.

365
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:49,872
That is all the information we have.

366
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:25,084
This is Colonel Holland.
I'll vouch for him.

367
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:21,704
Where does that fool
think he's going?

368
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,116
All right, stand back.

369
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:01,717
Major, search that airplane.

370
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:02,518
Yes, sir.

371
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:04,919
That won't be necessary.

372
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:14,522
What's the excuse, Rusty?

373
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:15,722
Well, Frankly, sir,

374
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:18,323
I thought we handled
this security test pretty well.

375
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,723
Better than I expected.

376
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:23,725
Of course, you just
lost your life, Rusty.

377
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:26,927
Why didn't you block off
that taxi strip, Major?

378
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:28,326
It never ocurred to me,
General Hawkes.

379
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:29,527
It should have.

380
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:30,927
Your men should have gotten
here sooner.

381
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:33,128
My men should never have
gotten out of that aircraft.

382
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:36,130
Yes, sir. I don't have enough
experienced personnel, sir.

383
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,890
Don't tell me
your little problems, son.

384
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,931
All I'm interested in is results.

385
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:43,733
I want airtight security, Rusty,

386
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,132
so it'll be impossible
for an unidentified aircraft

387
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:49,334
to barge right into your flight line.

388
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,135
What the devil is
that civilian doing here?

389
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:56,137
I'm just carrying out
your orders, General.

390
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:57,938
My orders?

391
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:01,138
Yes, sir. He was with me,
General, just reporting for duty.

392
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:03,739
Lieutenant Colonel Holland,
this is General Hawkes.

393
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,739
You're Dutch Holland?

394
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,739
Yes, sir.

395
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,741
We've been expecting you.

396
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:07,741
Yes, sir, I know.

397
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:08,941
In a blue suit.

398
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,543
General, I realize...

399
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:16,144
Good to have you in S.A.C., Dutch.

400
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:18,145
Hope you enjoy your tour.

401
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:20,745
You'll find there's been a few
changes since you were in last.

402
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:24,347
Yes, sir, I've found
a few already, General.

403
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:29,148
Come in.

404
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:31,949
Colonel Holland, sir,
reporting for duty.

405
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,749
Glad to have you
assigned to my wing, Dutch.

406
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,949
Got a real job waiting
for you in operations,

407
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,351
unless you have a preference.

408
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:39,550
Well, sir, as long as I'm here

409
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,551
I'd just as soon fly
as sit at a desk.

410
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:43,151
You'll fly, all right

411
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:46,153
All my staff officers are pilots
first and desk jockeys second.

412
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:47,352
"Samford".

413
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:48,552
Come in, will you, Rocky?

414
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:50,953
Rocky Samford is my
director of operations.

415
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:52,553
You'll be his assistant.

416
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:54,555
Sounds fine to me, Colonel.

417
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,355
Of course, I'm an old B-29 pilot.

418
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,555
I don't know the first
thing about a B-36.

419
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:01,755
Well, we'll check you out on a B-36
while you understudy Samford.

420
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:03,157
The idea is for you to replace him,

421
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,156
so he can move into
one of the new units.

422
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:06,157
I see.

423
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:08,358
S.A.C. has something big coming up...

424
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,558
the B-47.

425
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,959
Colonel Samford. Colonel Holland.

426
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,159
How are you?

427
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,760
Glad to meet you, Dutch.

428
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,559
Been a fan of yours for years.

429
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
I heard about you back on Guam

430
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,360
when you where with the 315th.

431
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:21,760
Well, Rocky, he's your baby.

432
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,162
You've got yourself an assistant.

433
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:24,961
Shouldn't take you long
to take over my job, Dutch.

434
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,161
No sweat.

435
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:28,562
I've got 21 months.
I'll do what I can.

436
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:29,562
Good luck on your physical.

437
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:30,563
Thank you, sir.

438
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:31,564
Want to take a look at our setup?

439
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:32,565
Fine.

440
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:35,164
"P-E-Z."

441
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:39,365
"T-E-C-F-D...

442
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:40,765
E- D-F..."

443
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,766
Captain Brown.

444
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,166
"C-Z-P."

445
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,967
Call for you, Colonel Holland.

446
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,569
Colonel Holland.

447
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,169
Sally.

448
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:54,768
Well, how are you?

449
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:55,769
Where are you?

450
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,169
I'm at the airport.

451
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,369
What airport?

452
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,571
Here in Fort Worth?
What are you doing here?

453
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:02,770
Well, what do you think I'm doing?

454
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,772
I came to be with you

455
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:06,771
Oh!, I've missed you.

456
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:09,173
I'm your bride of 5 months,
remember me?

457
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,372
Yes, dear, I know, but...

458
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,373
Well, I just didn't see any sense
in sitting around and waiting,

459
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,373
so here I am.

460
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,374
Don't you want me?

461
00:22:15,574 --> 00:22:16,974
Well, honey, of course I want you,

462
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:18,775
but we don't have any quarters yet.

463
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:21,776
Now, I have to get in touch
with Rusty and find out.

464
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:23,152
I'll tell you. You go to a hotel.

465
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,976
Go to the Blackstone hotel,

466
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,977
and I'm taking a physical
examination right now.

467
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:29,578
What's the matter? Are you sick?

468
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:31,578
No, no, everything's fine.

469
00:22:31,778 --> 00:22:33,099
As soon as...
I'll call you later.

470
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,179
Bye, dear.

471
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:36,780
Good bye.

472
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:43,381
Where was I?

473
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:46,582
Say "A".

474
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,384
Captain Johnson.

475
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:56,783
It's for you, Colonel.

476
00:22:56,784 --> 00:22:58,585
Colonel Holland.

477
00:22:58,785 --> 00:23:01,186
You're at the main gate?

478
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:03,585
Well, yeah, I got ahold of Rusty,

479
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:06,186
and he's checking on it now, but I...

480
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:08,586
get somebody to take you
over to the officers club.

481
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,388
I'll come over
as soon as I'm finished.

482
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:13,389
I have no idea, dear.
They go over you from head to foot.

483
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:15,988
They're just down to my throat now.

484
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:17,589
What?

485
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,590
Well, this one says
I don't have any adenoids.

486
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:23,190
Adenoids.

487
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:24,990
Good bye, dear.

488
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:29,592
We're going to take you
up to 45.000 feet.

489
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,395
Major Fleming.

490
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:46,796
Colonel Holland can't come
to the phone right now.

491
00:23:46,797 --> 00:23:47,796
Just a minute.

492
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:49,596
It's your wife, Colonel Holland.

493
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:51,398
She says it's urgent.

494
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,198
Well, uh...

495
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,598
Tell her I'll call her back.

496
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,800
He says he'll call you back.

497
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,600
He's up to 45.000 feet.

498
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:06,602
I don't see him.

499
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:10,601
No, no, in a training tank,
Mrs. Holland.

500
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:11,802
Mrs. Holland is at your quarters.

501
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:13,203
She says to meet her there.

502
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:16,203
My quarters? Where are they?

503
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,003
She says General Castle
drove her to your quarters.

504
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,405
She has no idea where they are.

505
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:48,012
Do all Air Force officers
live in such luxury?

506
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:49,411
Oh, no, this is just because

507
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:51,813
General Hawkes has taken
such a shine to me.

508
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:54,613
Yeah, well, he certainly has,
the old bat.

509
00:24:54,813 --> 00:24:55,813
Now, shh, shh.

510
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:59,014
Sally, now, we're on a S.A.C. base.

511
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,214
Dutch, are you angry with me

512
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:04,215
because I didn't wait
for you to send for me?

513
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:07,016
Well, I was kind of upset at first,

514
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:10,416
but now that I see you
in that nightgown,

515
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,418
I've kind of changed my mind.

516
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,420
It's all right. All right, dear.

517
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:28,021
All right.

518
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,425
- Hi. - Hi.
- Hello, Mrs. Castle.

519
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,026
What's happened?

520
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:47,425
The cards are ahead 6 to 2.

521
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:49,426
Do you know that Brewster
just drove in another run?

522
00:25:49,427 --> 00:25:51,027
Eh, good for him!

523
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:53,227
Well, I guess
I'd better get out there.

524
00:25:53,228 --> 00:25:54,627
You wait for me, honey.
I won't be long.

525
00:25:54,628 --> 00:25:55,627
Are you sure?

526
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:56,827
Yeah. Rocky's going to show me

527
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:58,429
one takeoff and one landing.
That's all.

528
00:25:58,629 --> 00:25:59,629
OK.

529
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:01,029
- Bye.
- Bye.

530
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,233
- Hi, Dutch.
- Hi, Rocky.

531
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:21,233
- We're about set.
- Fine.

532
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:23,611
I'm going to ride copilot today.
Check the crew's proficiency.

533
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:25,812
You can ride behind the aircraft
commander, see how it's done.

534
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:26,836
OK.

535
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:28,836
This is a select combat crew,
incidentally...

536
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:30,437
all sharp tools.

537
00:26:33,237 --> 00:26:34,038
Hey!

538
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:35,038
Colonel Holland!

539
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:36,637
Sergeant Bible, how are you?

540
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,439
Good. gee, it's good to see you.

541
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,038
I thought the cardinals had
you all signed up, Skipper.

542
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,439
Yeah, I thought so, too,

543
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,040
but General Hawkes
has a prior claim,

544
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,439
and he wouldn't give me a waiver.

545
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,601
Well, it's looks like we're
taking up were we left off.

546
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:48,441
Well, I hope not.

547
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,242
We had 2 engines shot out the
last one over Tokyo, remember?

548
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,442
Oh, boy, that was quite
a night, wasn't it?

549
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:55,619
I thought you were going
to get out on the Air Force.

550
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:58,243
No, I'm still in. Still in the
same racket flight engineer.

551
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:00,243
Got married a while back.

552
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,643
Fine. Any kids?

553
00:27:01,644 --> 00:27:04,044
Sure have, one on the ramp,
one in the hangar.

554
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:06,644
Ha! Good for you. Good for you.

555
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:07,645
Say, now, what about this?

556
00:27:07,646 --> 00:27:11,046
Don't tell me you've rigged up
this great big thing so it'll fly.

557
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,447
Well, if it doesn't, it'll be my neck.

558
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:15,447
Preflight completed, sir.

559
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:16,248
OK.

560
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:18,247
I'll give you your safety
procedures in a minute, sir.

561
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:19,248
All right.

562
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,250
Checklist completed.
Ready to start engine, sir.

563

564
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:29,651

"Roger. Starting 4."

572
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:43,053
"Roger."

Hey, aren't you fellas a little
high for a landing pattern?

601
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:48,128
We're right on flight plan, Dutch.

602
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:49,528
How high you going?

603
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,329
40.000 feet, Colonel.

604
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,930
40.000 feet?

605
00:32:57,931 --> 00:32:59,531
Oh, I see!

606
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:02,731
One takeoff, one landing?

607
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:05,732
Where's the landing going to be,
Rocky, Fairbanks, Alaska?

608
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,133
Right where we told you.
Back at Carswell.

609
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:09,334
Oh, I see!

610
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:12,334
Profile mission, huh?

611
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:14,934
Texas to Alaska and back?

612
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:17,135
You know, when I was a kid,

613
00:33:17,136 --> 00:33:19,536
somebody sold me the key
to the pitcher's box.

614
00:33:19,537 --> 00:33:21,137
Looks like I just bought it again.

615
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:23,337
You sure did, Dutch.

616
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:25,538
Now, you know who's

617
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:26,937
Really gonna appreciate this?

618
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,538
My wife Sally. I asked her
to wait for me.

619
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:31,940
Don't worry, Dutch.
Espy's gonna tell her.

620
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,139
Colonel, you wanna see
the rest of this big cigar?

621
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,540
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:37,541
Take over, onionhead.

623
00:33:50,744 --> 00:33:53,144
This is Colonel Dutch Holland.

624
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:54,144
Captain Miller.

625
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,144
Hi, Captain.

626
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:56,145
Sergeant Jones.

627
00:33:56,146 --> 00:33:58,146
Mighty glad to meet you, Colonel.

628
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:00,546
Wait till my kids hear about this.

629
00:34:00,547 --> 00:34:02,947
We saw in the papers
you were coming.

630
00:34:03,147 --> 00:34:05,148
You and I are goin'
in opposite directions,

631
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:07,348
you might say.
This is my last flight.

632
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:08,549
Oh, you gettin' out?

633
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:10,549
Yes, sir. My hitch is up.

634
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:13,549
No more of this
high pressure stuff for me.

635
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,750
Fella likes to get home
once in a while

636
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,350
and see his wife and kids.

637
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:19,351
Kind of rough duty in S.A.C, huh?

638
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:21,751
Oh!, no, sir, I wouldn't say that,

639
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:24,551
not if you like being away
from home all the time,

640
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:28,754
temporary duty in England,
North Africa, Japan,

641
00:34:28,954 --> 00:34:31,354
maintenance of weekends,
working all night.

642
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:34,955
Oh, great! just not for me,
that's all.

643
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:37,955
- You wanna follow me, Colonel?
- Were we goin' now?

644
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:40,955
We're goin' through the holland
tunnel to the gunner's compartment.

645
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:44,757
Left gunner from radio
2 men coming through.

646
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:48,158
Well, I'll be darned.

647
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:50,759
- I'll see you later Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

648
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,560
- All right, Colonel.
- OK.

649
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:03,562
That's quite a trip.

650
00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:05,963
Yeah. It's about 80 feet.

651
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,963
I never have gotten used to that thing.

652
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:12,363
Fellas, this is Colonel Dutch Holland.

653
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:13,764
Sergeant Lassiter.

654
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,765
How are you?

655
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:18,366
Let's see... Sergeant Dames.

656
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,366
- Hello, Colonel.
- Oh, how are you?

657
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:21,966
Airmen lay.

658
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,567
Hello, Colonel.

659
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:26,167
It's not quite ready.
We'll have a cup in a minute.

660
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,367
All the comforts of home?

661
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:28,567
Sure, sure.

662
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:29,568
This is airman Davies.

663
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:31,168
Hi, Colonel. Have a seat.

664
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:32,169
Fine.

665
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,569
Well, what do you think of her, sir?

666
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,371
She's a battleship.
Oh, what am I saying?

667
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:44,172
I guess it seems a lot different

668
00:35:44,372 --> 00:35:45,772
from our old B-29.

669
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:48,573
That's the same gunsight
we had in the 29. Isn't it?

670
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,372
Same type, different model.

671
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:52,174
Of course, when you boil it all down,

672
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:53,773
it's still an aircraft and a crew

673
00:35:53,774 --> 00:35:55,775
working together to get
a bomb on a target.

674
00:35:55,975 --> 00:35:57,375
But there isn't a war on.

675
00:35:57,575 --> 00:36:00,176
Do many of the men feel like
that radio operator?

676
00:36:00,376 --> 00:36:02,175
Every day in S.A.C.'s a war, Colonel.

677
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,576
Pressure's on all the time,

678
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:05,776
and General Hawkes is
breathing down your neck.

679
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,977
We never know when the other
fella may start something,

680
00:36:07,978 --> 00:36:09,378
so we've gotta be combat ready

681
00:36:09,578 --> 00:36:12,378
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

682
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,779
How do you find the guys

683
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:15,779
that will take it
at these pay scales?

684
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,180
Well, it's the competition, maybe.

685
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,781
You take a sellect crew like this,

686
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,380
they've all got spot promotions.

687
00:36:21,381 --> 00:36:22,781
Our aircraft commander

688
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,581
would be a Major instead
of a light colonel

689
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:25,981
If he weren't on this crew.

690
00:36:25,982 --> 00:36:27,582
If one man lets the crew down,

691
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,182
The whole crew gets demoted.

692
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:31,183
It keeps 'em in there pitchin'

693
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:34,184
I can think of an easier way
to make a buck.

694
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:37,185
Well, the coffee's free, anyhow.

695
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:05,991
Colonel Holland,

696
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:07,991
This is Major Mapes,
our radar observer.

697
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:08,992
How are you?

698
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:09,993
Hi, Colonel.

699
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:11,792
Major Ike Knowland, our navigator.

700
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:12,993
Hi, Major.

701
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:14,794
You sure have my sympathy, Dutch.

702
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:16,393
How do you mean, Knowland?

703
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:18,394
I was yanked back in, too.

704
00:37:18,395 --> 00:37:21,195
Just when I got a nice
tv business started.

705
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:23,195
Built a house for the wife and kids.

706
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:25,397
Well, you'll only
be in for 21 months.

707
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:27,197
What do you mean, "only"?

708
00:37:27,397 --> 00:37:30,397
You can't tell me they need
radar navigators this bad.

709
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:32,797
Anyway, I did my share once.

710
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:34,998
We're not in a war.

711
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:38,000
I think I know what you mean.

712
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:53,604
Come on, Dutch.
We'll put you to work.

713
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:15,408
OK, she's yours. Course 3-3-0.

714
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:17,009
I've got it.

715
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,419
Where did those jets come from, Rocky?

716
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,821
Our fighter escort. Part of S.A.C.

717
00:39:14,423 --> 00:39:16,224
- I'll take over.
- OK.

718
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,424
That's it. Let's go home.

719
00:40:06,436 --> 00:40:09,246
Airspeed 1-3-5.

720
00:40:12,257 --> 00:40:13,662
1-3-0.

721
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,071
1-2-5.

722
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:33,333
Arm 'em.

723
00:40:34,738 --> 00:40:36,143
Reverse.

724
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,527
I'm terribly sorry, honey.

725
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:28,932
I had no idea this thing.

726
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:31,140
Oh, I know. Now you
clim in, Marco Polo,

727
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:32,746
before I sure you for desertation.

728
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:34,587
Did you ever go over
Niagara Falls in a barrel?

729
00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:35,958
Yes. That makes 2 of us.

730
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,564
- Hi, Sally.
- Hi.

731
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,972
Hey, Dutch, not so fast.
You're not through yet.

732
00:41:39,973 --> 00:41:41,378
Now what?

733
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,899
Steam bath and massage in
the physical conditionating room.

734
00:41:43,987 --> 00:41:45,392
Just a couple of hours more.

735
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:48,805
Honey, you better go on home.

736
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:51,614
This may take another couple of days.

737
00:41:51,615 --> 00:41:53,220
See you later.

738
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,058
Sally?

739
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,668
Well, here you are.

740
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:08,474
The same night, too.

741
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:10,081
You angry with me?

742
00:42:10,282 --> 00:42:11,887
No, darling. I'm just confused.

743
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:12,890
Why?

744
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:14,897
I don't know whether to fix you
breakfast or dinner.

745
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:16,303
Well, let's see...

746
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:18,310
It's nearer breakfast.

747
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:19,514
You hungry?

748
00:42:19,515 --> 00:42:21,322
Not very. I'm tired.

749
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:24,332
Where did you boys go
on your little jaunt,

750
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:25,937
or is that a secret?

751
00:42:25,938 --> 00:42:29,150
Well, this was
a local mission... Alaska.

752
00:42:29,752 --> 00:42:32,160
All right, you don't
have to tell me.

753
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:33,765
Honey, I just did tell you.

754
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:35,170
We went to Alaska!

755
00:42:35,171 --> 00:42:38,181
Alaska and back without
landing or anything?

756
00:42:38,182 --> 00:42:39,387
Yeah, yeah.

757
00:42:39,587 --> 00:42:41,192
Well, I'm certainly glad
I didn't know that,

758
00:42:41,193 --> 00:42:42,799
or I wouldn't have slept at all.

759
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,007
You don't look like you
slept very much, either.

760
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,416
Well, I did fly the airplane
most of the night,

761
00:42:47,616 --> 00:42:49,020
with a lot of help,

762
00:42:49,021 --> 00:42:50,225
but that's not it.

763
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:53,236
It's just being out of
the picture for so long.

764
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,247
Having so much to learn,
so much to cath up on.

765
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,255
Oh, sweetheart, you're just tired.

766
00:42:58,455 --> 00:43:01,064
You wouldn't believe
the mess of new gadgets

767
00:43:01,065 --> 00:43:02,470
they have on that thing.

768
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,477
The aircraft commander
was a real pro.

769
00:43:04,678 --> 00:43:07,086
Even he say he's still learning
things about the B-36.

770
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:10,096
Well, why are you worrying
about all of this?

771
00:43:10,097 --> 00:43:11,904
You said you had a desk job.

772
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:14,512
I'm supposed to be
an operations officer.

773
00:43:14,513 --> 00:43:16,721
And you can't tell an aircraft
commander what to do

774
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:18,327
unless you can do it yourself.

775
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:19,933
In this outfit, everybody flies,

776
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:21,738
from General Hawkes on down.

777
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,522
In other words, then,
you're going to fly a lot

778
00:43:23,546 --> 00:43:25,150
of missions like this one?

779
00:43:25,151 --> 00:43:26,355
I don't know any other way to do it.

780
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:28,965
Well, that's a happy prospect.

781
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:31,975
Especially if I find out too late.

782
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,781
I'm in over my head.

783
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:35,790
Maybe I better quit right now.

784
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:37,394
Quit?

785
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:40,405
Well, It's better than crossing
things up in an emergency.

786
00:43:40,406 --> 00:43:42,012
Honey, you know, I used to think

787
00:43:42,213 --> 00:43:44,219
the old B-24 was a lot of airplane.

788
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,632
Do you realize that
one B-36 with an A-Bomb

789
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,843
can do the job of 1.000
world war II bombers

790
00:43:50,844 --> 00:43:52,249
and 10.000 crew members?

791
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,456
Now, just think
of the responsability

792
00:43:54,457 --> 00:43:56,464
that places on everybody
that even goes near

793
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:58,470
one of these airplanes.

794
00:43:58,471 --> 00:44:01,281
I've never heard you
talk like that before.

795
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:04,091
I've never come up against
anything like this before.

796
00:44:04,092 --> 00:44:06,098
Well, neither have I, for that matter.

797
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:08,506
Being an Air Force wife
certainly is not for me,

798
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:09,511
but it isn't that simple.

799
00:44:09,712 --> 00:44:11,318
I could go in to Rusty tomorrow

800
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:13,526
and lay it on the line,
tell him I can't cut it.

801
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:14,930
Oh, don't talk like that.

802
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:16,335
Well, wouldn't you
like that, Sally?

803
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:18,743
Well, of course I would.
I'd like nothing better,

804
00:44:18,744 --> 00:44:20,550
especially under the circumstances.

805
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:22,156
What circumstances?

806
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:24,164
Oh, that's what makes me so mad.

807
00:44:24,365 --> 00:44:26,325
What's the sense of talking
about it when you know

808
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,378
you're not gonna do any
such thing, and you know it.

809
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:29,382
How do you know I won't?

810
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:30,788
Because I know you.

811
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:33,349
You'd no more walk in there
and tell Rusty you're gonna quit

812
00:44:33,397 --> 00:44:37,010
than... well, I was gonna say fly.

813
00:44:40,422 --> 00:44:42,831
I guess maybe you're right.

814
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:49,052
You know me pretty well, don't you?

815
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,663
Do I? Wish you'd put that in writing.

816
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:52,866
Why?

817
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:55,276
I'd like to send it to my father.

818
00:44:57,283 --> 00:44:59,691
Honey, you where gonna
say something back here.

819
00:44:59,692 --> 00:45:02,703
No, I've said everything
I have to say.

820
00:45:05,312 --> 00:45:06,115
Dutch.

821
00:45:06,316 --> 00:45:07,519
Yeah?

822
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,333
How do you want your eggs,
scrambled or fried?

823
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,542
Uh... scrambled.

824
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:18,961
No. Fried.

825
00:45:22,574 --> 00:45:24,381
Over...

826
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:26,388
Easy.

827
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,824
You know, I'm beginning to know you

828
00:45:36,825 --> 00:45:38,632
pretty well, too, young lady.

829
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,036
You are?

830
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,043
I learned a lot than night
at the housewarming.

831
00:45:42,044 --> 00:45:45,657
You remenber when I had
to break the news to you?

832
00:45:45,858 --> 00:45:49,270
That was a lovely house.
It was a lovely party, too.

833
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:50,274
Sally...

834
00:45:50,475 --> 00:45:51,277
Yes?

835
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:53,285
I've got something to tell you.

836
00:45:53,485 --> 00:45:55,292
Now, it's pretty personal,

837
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:57,499
but I think it's gonna
make you very happy.

838
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,106
What is it?

839
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:01,314
You're going to have a baby.

840
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,730
How dou you know?

841
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,339
I met the Stork at 40.000 feet.

842
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,951
Then I met doc Baxter,
and he congratulated me,

843
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:13,558
so that was the other.

844
00:46:14,963 --> 00:46:16,970
Well, what do you think?

845
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:18,374
What do I think?
I think it's wonderful.

846
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,378
I hope it's twins.

847
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:20,984
Oh, Dutch.

848
00:46:22,189 --> 00:46:25,200
Well, all I can say is
we're mighty lucky it happened

849
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,805
before you had
to report for duty.

850
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:28,209
Why?

851
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,618
Well, judging from my short
experience in the Air Force,

852
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:33,831
it couldn't very well
have happened after that.

853
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:38,447
Will do, General.

854
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:40,253
Well, you got what you wanted Dutch.

855
00:46:40,254 --> 00:46:42,661
Your own airplane
and a crew... temporarily.

856
00:46:42,662 --> 00:46:45,070
Now you're talkin'.

857
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:46,476
General Castle did the talking.

858
00:46:46,677 --> 00:46:49,888
But don't forget, you're still
flying a desk for me primary duty.

859
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:56,913
You sent for me, sir?

860
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,724
Colonel espy has ordered me
to reassing you, Knowland.

861
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:02,533
Your aircraft commander
has asked that you be replaced.

862
00:47:02,534 --> 00:47:04,741
Anything wrong with my qualifications

863
00:47:04,742 --> 00:47:06,146
for a select crew, sir?

864
00:47:06,147 --> 00:47:08,355
No. That's the unfortunate
part of it.

865
00:47:08,556 --> 00:47:11,566
You're as well qualified as any
radar navigator in this wing.

866
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:15,581
He says it's your attitude.
You haven't been putting out.

867
00:47:15,782 --> 00:47:17,789
Well, what do they expect
my attitude to be?

868
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:21,001
Gratitude for wrecking
my business career?

869
00:47:21,201 --> 00:47:24,211
What about my request
for transfer, sir?

870
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:26,820
Or is the only way to get out
of S.A.C. to be carried out?

871
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:28,627
Don't hold your breath
while you're waiting.

872
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:29,831
We'll let you know.

873
00:47:29,832 --> 00:47:31,437
Meantime, you're not
getting out of flying.

874
00:47:31,438 --> 00:47:33,445
You're being reassigned
to a noncombat ready crew.

875
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:37,460
You lost your spot promotion
a couple of days ago.

876
00:47:50,507 --> 00:47:52,312
Hey, Ike.

877
00:47:52,313 --> 00:47:53,919
Wait a minute.

878
00:47:56,528 --> 00:47:57,532
Say, uh...

879
00:47:57,733 --> 00:47:59,739
They're giving me a pick-up crew

880
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,144
to train with for a while.

881
00:48:01,145 --> 00:48:02,951
I'll need an experienced navigator.

882
00:48:02,952 --> 00:48:04,758
Not particular, huh?

883
00:48:04,959 --> 00:48:06,363
Maybe I am.

884
00:48:06,364 --> 00:48:09,374
We're both in a particular
sort of situacion.

885
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:12,585
Yeah. Same raw deal.

886
00:48:12,586 --> 00:48:14,593
Well, you migh say the same deal.

887
00:48:14,794 --> 00:48:15,794
How about it?

888
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:17,804
It's ok by me.

889
00:48:17,805 --> 00:48:19,009
It's OK with me,

890
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:22,823
until the first time
you get me off course.

891
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:31,454
1-3-0.

892
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:34,264
1-2-5.

893
00:48:35,669 --> 00:48:36,673
1-2-0.

894
00:48:38,279 --> 00:48:39,281
1-1-5.

895
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:40,286
Arm the props.

896
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:43,697
Ike, you missed your ETA
by 45 seconds.

897
00:48:43,698 --> 00:48:44,902
You owe me a buck.

898
00:48:44,903 --> 00:48:46,107
Ok, Dutch,

899
00:48:46,308 --> 00:48:48,314
But it's the first time
you've won it in 6 months.

900
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:50,121
Reverse.

901
00:49:29,664 --> 00:49:32,474
No more fuel leaks so far.

902
00:49:32,675 --> 00:49:36,086
Maybe the modification's
all right, maybe not.

903
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:39,098
The next series of tests
will give us the answer.

904
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,928
Has Dutch Holland been running
these fuel tank tests?

905
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:48,732
Yes, sir.

906
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:50,739
I thought he had a staff job.

907
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,145
You made him an aircraft commander?

908
00:49:52,345 --> 00:49:54,152
Well, I'd say he's doing both, sir.

909
00:49:54,353 --> 00:49:55,758
But he sure likes to fly.

910
00:50:00,174 --> 00:50:02,382
He does, eh?

911
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:18,439
Going, Dutch?

912
00:50:19,443 --> 00:50:22,051
Now don't have the baby
till I get back.

913
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,456
I want to be here to greet him.

914
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:26,066
I'll certainly try not to.

915
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:29,077
You know, I kinda have a feeling

916
00:50:29,078 --> 00:50:30,682
the little fella's
not going to report in

917
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:32,087
for about 2 weeks.

918
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:33,694
I'll be back in 4 days.

919
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:38,310
Well, I certainly hope
it's a little fella, for your sake.

920
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:40,116
But you know, it could be a girl.

921
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:41,321
A girl?

922
00:50:41,322 --> 00:50:42,324
Sure.

923
00:50:42,325 --> 00:50:43,931
I suppose it's a possibility.

924
00:50:44,935 --> 00:50:48,747
Sweetheart, do you have to go
on this trip right now?

925
00:50:48,748 --> 00:50:50,955
Honey, I've been running
these cold weather tests.

926
00:50:50,956 --> 00:50:52,160
I have to go through with them.

927
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:53,765
Couldn't it be postponed,

928
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:56,977
even just till after
the baby gets here?

929
00:50:56,978 --> 00:50:58,784
Well, Sally, we've got a job to do.

930
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:00,189
Now, if we start scheduling flights

931
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,393
to fit the birthrate,

932
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:02,999
do you realize
there are 1.500 babies

933
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,806
born a month in S.A.C.?

934
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:06,411
And do you realize

935
00:51:06,412 --> 00:51:08,218
you're getting to sound more
like General Hawkes every day?

936
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:09,824
- I am?
- Yes.

937
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:14,240
I promise I won't smoke
any big black cigars.

938
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:16,246
That will be very nice.

939
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:17,250
Right.

940
00:51:17,251 --> 00:51:18,857
Where are you going?

941
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:19,860
Thule.

942
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:21,264
Thule?

943
00:51:21,265 --> 00:51:22,470
- Where's that?
- Greenland.

944
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:24,477
Greenland?

945
00:51:24,678 --> 00:51:26,284
- Yeah.
- In february?

946
00:51:26,685 --> 00:51:27,688
Well...

947
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:29,695
With all that ice and snow?

948
00:51:29,696 --> 00:51:31,502
Well, we're running
cold weather tests,

949
00:51:31,703 --> 00:51:33,710
you see, and in order to run
a cold weather test...

950
00:51:33,911 --> 00:51:35,315
you have to have cold weather.

951
00:51:35,316 --> 00:51:37,123
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

952
00:51:37,524 --> 00:51:39,129
What do you want me to bring you,

953
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,739
a polar bear, penguin?

954
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:44,950
How about a husband?

955
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:46,557
Got one.

956
00:51:46,757 --> 00:51:50,571
No. I want a husband
right here on the ground,

957
00:51:50,772 --> 00:51:53,783
not one that's
8 miles over Greenland

958
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,392
or Alaska or Timbuktu.

959
00:51:57,396 --> 00:51:59,803
Whatever happened to that nive guy

960
00:51:59,804 --> 00:52:02,614
who played third base
for the Cardinals?

961
00:52:03,618 --> 00:52:05,223
You mean Brewster?

962
00:52:05,224 --> 00:52:07,432
No. I mean you.

963
00:52:09,037 --> 00:52:10,643
Oh, I'm sorry.

964
00:52:11,245 --> 00:52:16,263
It's just so hard to be
a good sport at 5 A.M.,

965
00:52:16,464 --> 00:52:19,877
especially when you're
9 months pregnant.

966
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:24,693
Now don't you worry.

967
00:52:24,694 --> 00:52:26,901
The little fella's never
gonna know the diferrence.

968
00:52:26,902 --> 00:52:29,310
Before he's a year old,
I'll be back at third.

969
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,121
I hope so.

970
00:52:38,343 --> 00:52:40,149
Good bye, dear.

971
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:17,685
Take it a minute.

972
00:53:31,936 --> 00:53:34,946
Aw, we're never gonna
get under this stuff, Leo.

973
00:53:34,947 --> 00:53:37,556
Call Thule approach control
for G.C.A.

974
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:38,760
Roger.

975
00:53:42,574 --> 00:53:43,978
Thule approach control
from Air Force.

976
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:45,786
I've just been out
on the left wing, sir.

977
00:53:45,987 --> 00:53:47,793
We've got a bad leak
in number 2 fuel tank,

978
00:53:47,994 --> 00:53:49,599
gas sloshing around
near the fire walls.

979
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,004
May have a fire any second.

980
00:53:51,005 --> 00:53:53,814
All right, cut off every
electrical system you can spare.

981
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:56,625
We're gonna be over the base
in about 40 minutes.

982
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:59,434
Aircraft commander to crew...

983
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:01,041
we have a bad fuel leak
in the left wing.

984
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,047
Gasoline fumes. No smoking.

985
00:54:03,048 --> 00:54:06,059
Take stations for possible
emergency bailout.

986
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,865
Take bailout stations.

987
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,338
Might be that sudden
temperature change, Dutch.

988
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:30,948
42 below zero out there.

989
00:54:32,755 --> 00:54:35,364
Rear scanner to aircraft commander...

990
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:38,375
we're on fire, Colonel.
Number one engine.

991
00:54:38,977 --> 00:54:41,385
Feather 1, 2, and 3.

992
00:54:41,386 --> 00:54:43,795
Fuel switches off to 1, 2, and 3.

993
00:54:43,995 --> 00:54:45,601
Fire extinguishers on.

994
00:54:52,024 --> 00:54:54,231
All right, start jets 3 and 4.

995
00:54:54,232 --> 00:54:55,838
100%

996
00:55:02,462 --> 00:55:05,071
Full power on 4, 5, and 6.

997
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:19,523
A.C. to crew standby
for inmediate bailout

998
00:55:19,724 --> 00:55:21,731
when you hear the long ring.

999
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:26,347
A.C. to navigator

1000
00:55:26,348 --> 00:55:28,757
call Thule tower.
Give 'em our exact position.

1001
00:55:28,957 --> 00:55:29,960
Keep giving it to 'em.

1002
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:33,373
Roger. Radio, this is navigator.

1003
00:55:34,377 --> 00:55:36,785
Our position is 68 degrees,

1004
00:55:36,986 --> 00:55:39,997
45 minutes west longitude.

1005
00:55:40,198 --> 00:55:41,602
76 degrees,

1006
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:44,813
10 minutes north latitude.

1007
00:55:44,814 --> 00:55:46,019
I repeat.

1008
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:48,025
Hadn't we better belly land, Dutch?

1009
00:55:48,026 --> 00:55:49,430
We'll freeze to deatch down there.

1010
00:55:49,431 --> 00:55:50,836
I'm afraid we'd blow up first.

1011
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,248
Fire spreading over
the whole wing Colonel.

1012
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,467
A.C. to crew...

1013
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:01,273
Bail out as close together
as you can.

1014
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,681
Try to join up as soon
as you hit the ground.

1015
00:56:03,682 --> 00:56:05,489
All right, here we go.

1016
00:56:35,999 --> 00:56:37,404
Go on, Leo.

1017
00:57:08,516 --> 00:57:11,526
Thule tower, this is 2-3-5-0.

1018
00:57:11,727 --> 00:57:13,534
I just broke out of the overcast.

1019
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:14,738
I'm too low to bail out.

1020
00:57:14,939 --> 00:57:17,950
I'm gonna attempt
a gear-up crash landing.

1021
00:58:25,593 --> 00:58:27,400
Hey.

1022
00:58:28,604 --> 00:58:30,811
Who's that? Ike?

1023
00:58:30,812 --> 00:58:32,217
You all right?

1024
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:34,826
Yeah. I guess so.

1025
00:58:35,027 --> 00:58:37,034
Just my ankle.

1026
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:40,044
Just wait a minute now. Don't move.

1027
00:58:40,045 --> 00:58:42,454
Wait till I close this hatch here.

1028
00:58:58,311 --> 00:58:59,917
Witch leg is it?

1029
00:59:00,117 --> 00:59:01,723
Right leg, Dutch.

1030
00:59:01,924 --> 00:59:04,132
No movin' now. Just lie still.

1031
00:59:04,533 --> 00:59:07,745
Here. Put that blanket over you.

1032
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:12,763
Wait till I get things
closed up here.

1033
00:59:21,595 --> 00:59:23,602
We're darn near buried, Ike.

1034
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,814
Storn comin' up, too.

1035
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:29,423
Oh, that's great.

1036
00:59:29,624 --> 00:59:32,834
All the air rescue boys need
is a good blizzard.

1037
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,244
Well, It's no use trying
to find the crew out there now.

1038
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:37,049
Not a chance.

1039
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,857
The bailed out miles from here.

1040
00:59:39,058 --> 00:59:41,065
Let me take a look at that leg.

1041
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:42,871
Hold that.

1042
00:59:43,072 --> 00:59:44,677
Davenport's got the emergency radio.

1043
00:59:44,678 --> 00:59:46,685
- That's one thing.
- Yeah.

1044
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:50,096
Good thing the guys in back
bailed out in time.

1045
00:59:50,097 --> 00:59:51,702
Yeah. They'd have had it.

1046
00:59:51,703 --> 00:59:53,510
This ankle's broken.

1047
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,315
Here.

1048
00:59:55,316 --> 00:59:58,326
Can you reach that
first aid thing there?

1049
00:59:58,327 --> 00:59:59,327
Hold that.

1050
00:59:59,527 --> 01:00:01,528
Why didn't you bail out?

1051
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:02,928
Waited too long, I guess.

1052
01:00:03,128 --> 01:00:05,729
I was trying to give them
a continuous voice fix.

1053
01:00:05,929 --> 01:00:08,729
You mean you kept
talking till we hit?

1054
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,130
Oh!, just in case we were off course.

1055
01:00:12,131 --> 01:00:15,532
Well, I'd say you were
rigth on course, Ike.

1056
01:00:28,735 --> 01:00:31,136
Is this all of them, sir?
All but Dutch and Nolan.

1057
01:00:32,136 --> 01:00:34,137
No sign of the wreck, General.

1058
01:00:34,337 --> 01:00:35,936
Why couldn't they have had
the same luck we had?

1059
01:00:35,937 --> 01:00:37,136
Why couldn't they have come down

1060
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:39,537
with an Eskimo Village in their lap?

1061
01:00:39,538 --> 01:00:41,938
Let's get back out there, Lieutenant.

1062
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:43,139
I'm going with you.

1063
01:00:52,742 --> 01:00:53,741
How's the arm, Dutch?

1064
01:00:53,742 --> 01:00:58,343
Oh, it's pretty good, but it's still sore.
Up around the shoulder joint there.

1065
01:00:59,343 --> 01:01:01,144
I think I'll have another look.

1066
01:01:06,545 --> 01:01:07,546
Anything doing?

1067
01:01:08,346 --> 01:01:10,146
No. It's still pretty gusty.

1068
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:12,346
Our smoke signal's burning fine.

1069
01:01:12,347 --> 01:01:14,346
Close the blister, will you, Dutch?

1070
01:01:14,347 --> 01:01:15,748
We don't need any more ventilation.

1071
01:01:15,948 --> 01:01:16,948
All right.

1072
01:01:18,149 --> 01:01:22,150
You know... you know, with only
4 hours of daylight,

1073
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,750
it might take quite a while finding us.

1074
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,151
I hope not. I'd like to
get out of this igloo.

1075
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,752
I supoose they've notified
our wives we're missing, huh?

1076
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:33,153
They'd have to after 2 days.

1077
01:01:33,353 --> 01:01:35,952
Sally's a wonderful sport about
everything, but after all,

1078
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:38,554
when you're having your
first child, this is rough.

1079
01:01:38,754 --> 01:01:39,554
When is it due?

1080
01:01:39,555 --> 01:01:41,355
When's it due? I don't right now!

1081
01:01:41,555 --> 01:01:44,755
Maybe now! How do I know?
Here I am out in a pile of snow.

1082
01:01:44,756 --> 01:01:46,755
Hey, sit down, Colonel, sit down.

1083
01:01:46,756 --> 01:01:48,133
We've got trouble enough without you

1084
01:01:48,157 --> 01:01:49,957
pacing up and downlike
a nervous father.

1085
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,958
Don't suppose it does much good.

1086
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:56,559
What do you want, Dutch?
A boy or a girl?

1087
01:01:56,759 --> 01:02:00,560
Oh... Boy, I guess,

1088
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,561
but I just have a hunch it's a girl.

1089
01:02:05,561 --> 01:02:07,561
Never. I'll bet you on it.

1090
01:02:07,562 --> 01:02:09,682
- You want to bet?
- I'll bet you 5 bucks it's a girl.

1091
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:12,763
- Did you hear something?
- No.

1092
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:14,964
No, there.

1093
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:16,964
Listen. That...

1094
01:02:19,765 --> 01:02:22,366
Hey, Colonel, what are you
doing down there awol?

1095
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:29,967
Say, I want to get
a message to my wife.

1096
01:02:29,968 --> 01:02:32,168
She's already been notified
that you'r ok, sir.

1097
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:36,370
This came for you
a couple days ago, sir.

1098
01:02:40,371 --> 01:02:42,371
A baby girl.

1099
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:44,092
Just happened to have this handy, sir.

1100
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:46,171
Well, have one.

1101
01:02:46,172 --> 01:02:47,172
Thank you, sir.

1102
01:02:47,173 --> 01:02:48,572
Hey, Rusty, it's a baby girl.

1103
01:02:48,573 --> 01:02:49,773
Congratulations, pappy.

1104
01:02:49,973 --> 01:02:51,573
Look. It says right
here a baby girl.

1105
01:02:51,574 --> 01:02:52,573
That's great, Dutch.

1106
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,373
What do you know? A baby girl.

1107
01:02:54,374 --> 01:02:55,774
Amazing, Colonel.

1108
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:57,975
6 pounds, 5 ounces it says.

1109
01:02:58,175 --> 01:02:59,776
It's a good thing
we found you, Colonel.

1110
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,775
6 pounds. What do you know?

1111
01:03:01,776 --> 01:03:03,176
She wants to know about a name.

1112
01:03:03,177 --> 01:03:04,577
Well, what about...

1113
01:03:04,777 --> 01:03:06,377
can you get a message
to her right away?

1114
01:03:06,378 --> 01:03:07,778
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

1115
01:03:08,378 --> 01:03:11,378
Before you do anything else,
why don't you go get washed up,

1116
01:03:11,379 --> 01:03:13,979
get some hot food and have
that shoulder looked at?

1117
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,179
We have about a half an hour

1118
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,981
before General Hawkes gets here.

1119
01:03:17,181 --> 01:03:18,980
We got word a couple of hours ago

1120
01:03:18,981 --> 01:03:20,781
that he's landing here
on his way back from England.

1121
01:03:20,782 --> 01:03:22,782
Oh, yeah! Well, that figures.

1122
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:24,983
Yeah. Here.

1123
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,583
Get that off right away,
will you?

1124
01:03:26,783 --> 01:03:27,782
Yes, sir.

1125
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:30,784
And, uh, this one for the General.

1126
01:03:33,785 --> 01:03:36,185
How much time was there
on number one engine?

1127
01:03:36,186 --> 01:03:37,585
341 hours, sir.

1128
01:03:37,586 --> 01:03:40,187
Did you inspect the fuel tanks
personally before takeoff?

1129
01:03:40,387 --> 01:03:40,987
Yes, sir.

1130
01:03:41,187 --> 01:03:42,988
Captain Symington
and Sergeant Bible, too.

1131
01:03:43,388 --> 01:03:44,388
Any fuel stains?

1132
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:45,588
No, sir.

1133
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,388
How much time did you spend
pre-flighting the aircraft?

1134
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:49,388
Over 4 hours,

1135
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:51,390
and that's not including
engine run-ups.

1136
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:54,591
You consider your flight
engineer fully qualified?

1137
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:56,991
I consider him the best
in the business, General.

1138
01:03:59,192 --> 01:04:01,191
Well, Rusty, there's no use
trying to get the rest

1139
01:04:01,192 --> 01:04:03,793
of this picture until Holland
meets the investigating board.

1140
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:07,193
But accidents don't
just happen, Colonel Holland.

1141
01:04:07,194 --> 01:04:08,394
There's always a reason.

1142
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,594
As Aircraft Commander
you're completely responsible,

1143
01:04:10,595 --> 01:04:12,394
even if a wing drops off.

1144
01:04:12,395 --> 01:04:15,195
Especially if a wing drops off.

1145
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:16,996
I'm leaving for Carswell in an hour.

1146
01:04:16,997 --> 01:04:17,996
Would you like a lift?

1147
01:04:17,997 --> 01:04:19,796
Yes, sir.

1148
01:04:19,797 --> 01:04:21,597
We'll continue this on my airplane.

1149
01:04:21,598 --> 01:04:23,198
Yes, sir.

1150
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,398
Flight surgeon seen that arm yet?

1151
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:27,799
No, sir, but I've talked to him.

1152
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,799
I'm OK. I'll have it checked

1153
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,999
as soon as I get back.

1154
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,400
It's just a bruise up
on my shoulder, General.

1155
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:33,400
Make sure of that.

1156
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:34,601
Yes, sir.

1157
01:04:50,606 --> 01:04:52,205
I want the latest results

1158
01:04:52,206 --> 01:04:54,207
of your last performance
and stability tests

1159
01:04:54,407 --> 01:04:55,406
as soon as possible.

1160
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:56,606
Yes, sir.

1161
01:04:56,607 --> 01:04:58,008
That cigar, sir.

1162
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:00,248
Doesn't the General know
the aircraft might explode?

1163
01:05:01,209 --> 01:05:03,009
It wouldn't dare.

1164
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,809
While we're gassing up

1165
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,210
I've got something to show you.

1166
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:10,211
Yes, sir.

1167
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,020
Holy smokes.

1168
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:46,620
So this id the B-47, huh?

1169
01:05:46,621 --> 01:05:48,020
She's the most beautiful thing

1170
01:05:48,021 --> 01:05:49,421
I've ever seen in my life, General.

1171
01:05:49,422 --> 01:05:50,422
Just look at her.

1172
01:05:51,022 --> 01:05:52,422
Look at her.

1173
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:56,623
I sure would like to get
my hands on one of these.

1174
01:05:56,624 --> 01:05:58,224
Maybe you will, Dutch.

1175
01:05:58,424 --> 01:06:00,425
Maybe you will.

1176
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,435
How are you, sweetie?

1177
01:06:39,635 --> 01:06:40,836
Oh, how are you?

1178
01:06:41,236 --> 01:06:43,435
Hey, what are you doing home
from the hospital so soon?

1179
01:06:43,436 --> 01:06:46,436
The birth rate of Carswell must
have jumped up or something.

1180
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:47,636
Boy, they were so crowded.

1181
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:48,814
They sure got rid of me in a hurry.

1182
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:49,837
What?

1183
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:52,638
Well, you seem to beall in
one piece. Was it very bad?

1184
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:55,438
No. I sure oiled up
an airplane, though.

1185
01:06:55,439 --> 01:06:56,839
We were all mighty lucky.

1186
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,839
The main things was

1187
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,080
I just kept worrying about you.

1188
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,440
I knew we were all right.

1189
01:07:00,441 --> 01:07:02,040
Oh, so did I, really.

1190
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:04,841
I kept listening to the radio
reports every day.

1191
01:07:04,842 --> 01:07:06,641
I knew you were coming back.

1192
01:07:06,642 --> 01:07:07,842
You just had to.

1193
01:07:07,843 --> 01:07:09,042
Oh!, yeah, sure.

1194
01:07:09,043 --> 01:07:11,243
Especially me being
a father and everything.

1195
01:07:11,244 --> 01:07:13,843
A father. Well, where's the baby?

1196
01:07:13,844 --> 01:07:15,244
Where are you hiding the baby?

1197
01:07:15,245 --> 01:07:16,645
Oh, she'll be here.

1198
01:07:16,845 --> 01:07:17,844
Oh, she's so pretty.

1199
01:07:17,845 --> 01:07:19,446
- She is?
- Yeah.

1200
01:07:20,046 --> 01:07:22,047
Dutch, are you
terribly disappointed

1201
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:23,246
because she's a little girl?

1202
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,447
Disappointed?
I'm delighted.

1203
01:07:24,647 --> 01:07:27,647
I won 5 bucks from
Mike Knowland on it.

1204
01:07:27,648 --> 01:07:28,448
Wait. I've got a present for you,

1205
01:07:28,648 --> 01:07:30,849
all the way from Thule.

1206
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:35,250
My goodness. It looks
as big as the baby.

1207
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:38,650
A penguin.

1208
01:07:38,651 --> 01:07:40,452
I couldn't get a polar bear.

1209
01:07:40,652 --> 01:07:43,651
Oh, but I didn't ask
for anything but a husband,

1210
01:07:43,652 --> 01:07:44,853
and I got him.

1211
01:07:50,254 --> 01:07:51,655
Here we are.

1212
01:07:52,655 --> 01:07:54,655
Dutch, I want you
to meet your daughter.

1213
01:07:54,855 --> 01:07:56,455
Well...

1214
01:07:56,456 --> 01:07:58,256
Well,...

1215
01:08:00,257 --> 01:08:03,657
Well, how do you do, young lady?

1216
01:08:03,658 --> 01:08:06,058
Very glad to meet you.

1217
01:08:06,259 --> 01:08:08,458
She says she is, too.

1218
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,860
Would you like to hold her, Colonel?

1219
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,059
Would you like to hold her?

1220
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,661
I'm not checked out on this, but...

1221
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:17,662
Oh, OK!

1222
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,063
She's not very big, is she?

1223
01:08:21,463 --> 01:08:24,663
- No.
- She sure is cute.

1224
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:27,063
What did you name her?

1225
01:08:27,064 --> 01:08:29,064
Just what you said. Hope.

1226
01:08:29,065 --> 01:08:30,064
Hope?

1227
01:08:30,065 --> 01:08:31,265
Hope? I said Hope?

1228
01:08:31,465 --> 01:08:35,465
Well, yes, that's what
you said in your telegram.

1229
01:08:35,466 --> 01:08:37,667
"Can't think of any name but Hope.

1230
01:08:37,867 --> 01:08:39,067
"Everything fine.

1231
01:08:41,268 --> 01:08:43,869
Oh, honey, see, I said,

1232
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:45,469
"Can't think of any name,

1233
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:47,670
"but Hope everything fine.

1234
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:51,871
Well, Hope. That's a pretty nice name.

1235
01:08:52,071 --> 01:08:53,070
Yeah.

1236
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:54,672
What do you think of the name Hope?

1237
01:08:55,672 --> 01:08:58,672
She says she likes it fine.

1238
01:08:58,673 --> 01:08:59,673
All right.

1239
01:08:59,873 --> 01:09:01,072
It's OK with me if it's OK with you.

1240
01:09:01,073 --> 01:09:02,473
I think it's really pretty.

1241
01:09:02,474 --> 01:09:03,873
Well, Hope, it is, then.

1242
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:06,274
Well, now, you say
good bye to your father.

1243
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:07,274
Good bye, Hope.

1244
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:10,275
I guess I'll be seeing you around.

1245
01:09:10,276 --> 01:09:14,076
That's was sort of a
silly thing to say.

1246
01:09:14,077 --> 01:09:16,077
She's gonna like it in Florida.

1247
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,077
Florida. Oh, I forgot to tell you.

1248
01:09:18,078 --> 01:09:19,677
We're gonna move.

1249
01:09:19,678 --> 01:09:20,679
When?

1250
01:09:20,879 --> 01:09:22,278
In about 2 weeks.

1251
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:23,679
I've been transferred to MacDill.

1252
01:09:23,879 --> 01:09:25,880
We're going back to our old house.

1253
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,880
Oh!, that's wonderful.

1254
01:09:27,881 --> 01:09:30,280
We'll be there just in time
to watch the spring training.

1255
01:09:30,281 --> 01:09:31,281
How did that happen?

1256
01:09:31,482 --> 01:09:33,282
They're setting up
a new B-47 wing.

1257
01:09:33,482 --> 01:09:36,882
General Hawkes gave me a chance
to get in on the ground for.

1258
01:09:36,883 --> 01:09:38,483
General Hawkes?

1259
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:40,883
What's a B-47?

1260
01:09:40,884 --> 01:09:42,284
It's a new jet bomber,

1261
01:09:42,484 --> 01:09:45,285
and it's the most beautiful,
wonderful airplane

1262
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:46,862
you've ever seen in your whole life.

1263
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:49,086
Sally, this is the most
wonderful thing

1264
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:50,687
you could ever imagine.

1265
01:09:55,888 --> 01:09:57,087
In the B-36.

1266
01:09:57,088 --> 01:09:58,888
We've got a good
long range heavy bomber,

1267
01:09:58,889 --> 01:10:00,688
but we've needed a medium bomber

1268
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:03,089
to replace our World War II types.

1269
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,490
The B-47 can fill that need

1270
01:10:05,491 --> 01:10:07,490
and greatly increase
the overall capabilities

1271
01:10:07,491 --> 01:10:09,491
of the Strategic Air Command.

1272
01:10:09,492 --> 01:10:11,491
It's been under development
for 8 years.

1273
01:10:11,492 --> 01:10:15,092
It's the fastest operational
jet bomber in the world.

1274
01:10:15,093 --> 01:10:16,293
Recently it was timed

1275
01:10:16,294 --> 01:10:18,494
at a ground speed
of 794 miles per hour,

1276
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:20,695
and it's ceiling
is over 40.000 feet.

1277
01:10:20,895 --> 01:10:23,696
This wing is so clean

1278
01:10:23,896 --> 01:10:26,295
that mechabics have to wear
soft soled shoes

1279
01:10:26,296 --> 01:10:27,696
If they walk on it.

1280
01:10:27,697 --> 01:10:29,097
A scuff on this metal skin

1281
01:10:29,297 --> 01:10:32,697
could slow it down 20 miles an hour.

1282
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:34,698
With the new family of nuclear weapons,

1283
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:38,899
on B-47 and a crew of 3
carries the destructive power

1284
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,701
of the entire B-29 force
we used against Japan.

1285
01:10:42,901 --> 01:10:44,700
Up until now the B-47 has been

1286
01:10:44,701 --> 01:10:47,101
in the hands of test pilots.
It looks good.

1287
01:10:47,102 --> 01:10:48,501
We don't now how good

1288
01:10:48,502 --> 01:10:51,302
until it's been proved out
by our regular S.A.C. crews.

1289
01:10:51,303 --> 01:10:52,702
That'll be General Castle's job

1290
01:10:52,703 --> 01:10:55,304
with the first new wing at MacDill.

1291
01:10:55,504 --> 01:10:59,504
I want to see a year of flying
crammed into 6 months.

1292
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,506
I'll tell you why I'm in a hurry.

1293
01:11:07,908 --> 01:11:10,307
When units of all 3 S.A.C. Air Forces

1294
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:11,708
are equipped with B-47's,

1295
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:14,108
our overall mobility will be doubled.

1296
01:11:14,109 --> 01:11:16,710
It all boils down
to less danger of war.

1297
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:20,110
With each B-47 delivered,

1298
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:22,911
S.A.C's capability of quick
retaliation is increased,

1299
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:25,712
and an enemy
would undoubtedly know it.

1300
01:11:25,912 --> 01:11:29,513
We'll be better able to realize
S.A.C.'s best hope:

1301
01:11:29,713 --> 01:11:33,114
to prevent a war from ever starting.

1302
01:11:33,314 --> 01:11:34,914
I've called you to Omaha

1303
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:36,715
for the special briefings
that will follow

1304
01:11:36,915 --> 01:11:38,715
because each one of you
is gonna be a key man

1305
01:11:38,716 --> 01:11:40,516
in the B-47 program.

1306
01:11:43,317 --> 01:11:45,317
Let's leave it this way.

1307
01:11:45,318 --> 01:11:48,317
The B-47 is on third base.

1308
01:11:48,318 --> 01:11:51,319
It'll be up to you to bring it home.

1309
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:42,933
Canopy Coming closed.

1310
01:13:27,545 --> 01:13:29,945
You all squared away, Ike?

1311
01:13:29,946 --> 01:13:31,145
Ok, Dutch.

1312
01:13:31,146 --> 01:13:32,145
How about you, Rocky?

1313
01:13:32,146 --> 01:13:33,346
Roger.

1314
01:13:33,347 --> 01:13:34,947
MacDill tower, this is 5024.

1315
01:13:35,147 --> 01:13:36,147
We're ready to go.

1316
01:13:36,348 --> 01:13:38,747
5024, you are cleared for takeoff.

1317
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,949
Roger, 5024.

1318
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:50,551
Rolling.

1319
01:13:50,751 --> 01:13:51,952
Arm A.T.O.

1320
01:14:00,754 --> 01:14:02,555
Fire A.T.O.

1321
01:15:06,172 --> 01:15:08,371
Air force 5024.

1322
01:15:08,372 --> 01:15:10,372
This is eagle control. Say again.

1323
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:11,573
We're just in time.

1324
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:13,574
The B-47 is on a bomb run.

1325
01:15:17,775 --> 01:15:21,775
Eagle control, this is Air Force 5024.

1326
01:15:21,776 --> 01:15:25,377
Type a bomb run, radar,
observer, Major Knowland,

1327
01:15:25,577 --> 01:15:29,977
I.K., altitude 43.000, 43.000 feet.

1328
01:15:29,978 --> 01:15:32,378
Type of release, automatic, over.

1329
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:33,778
Eagle control, Roger.

1330
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,980
Give us a call when
you depart the I.P.

1331
01:15:40,581 --> 01:15:43,981
Eagle control,
this is 5024 departing I.P.

1332
01:15:43,982 --> 01:15:44,982
Roger.

1333
01:15:48,183 --> 01:15:49,382
Ike, you all set?

1334
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:50,383
Roger.

1335
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:51,984
Ok, it's your airplane.

1336
01:15:59,786 --> 01:16:02,386
We are 25 miles out.

1337
01:16:02,387 --> 01:16:03,387
Roger.

1338
01:16:07,588 --> 01:16:09,788
Tour tone is loud and clear.

1339
01:16:09,789 --> 01:16:11,989
Standing by for information.

1340
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:17,191
Bomb away.

1341
01:16:18,591 --> 01:16:20,391
Dutch, that's a shot.

1342
01:16:20,392 --> 01:16:23,392
You mean this city's been wiped out

1343
01:16:23,393 --> 01:16:24,992
theoretically in a storm

1344
01:16:24,993 --> 01:16:27,193
by a bomber we didn't
even see or hear?

1345
01:16:27,194 --> 01:16:30,193
Sure. With radar,
weather's no problem.

1346
01:16:30,194 --> 01:16:31,395
We've been bombing cities

1347
01:16:31,595 --> 01:16:33,394
every day and every night
all over the U.S.,

1348
01:16:33,395 --> 01:16:35,196
only people never know it.

1349
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:46,798
What?

1350
01:16:46,799 --> 01:16:48,799
Seventh hour stretch.

1351
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,801
Thanks, Ike.

1352
01:16:57,802 --> 01:17:00,603
Hey, Rocky, we've got about
an hour and a half more to go.

1353
01:17:00,803 --> 01:17:03,363
Do you want to take it the rest of
the way and shoot the landing?

1354
01:17:03,403 --> 01:17:04,204
Roger.

1355
01:17:04,404 --> 01:17:05,404
You have it.

1356
01:17:11,405 --> 01:17:13,205
That shoulder again?

1357
01:17:13,206 --> 01:17:15,207
No. I'm stiff all over. Who isn't?

1358
01:17:57,018 --> 01:17:58,218
Pop the chute.

1359
01:18:20,424 --> 01:18:22,425
Say, you know, that boy's
got a lot on the ball.

1360
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:24,024
He could be another Bobby Feller.

1361
01:18:24,025 --> 01:18:25,024
Oh!, he looks great.

1362
01:18:25,025 --> 01:18:28,225
He won 18 for Rochester last year.

1363
01:18:28,226 --> 01:18:30,627
Dutch, will you stop
looking at your watch?

1364
01:18:30,827 --> 01:18:33,227
You said you don't
take off until midnight.

1365
01:18:33,228 --> 01:18:35,627
Well, honey, I'm not hopping
a streetcar, you know?

1366
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,629
A mission like this takes
6, 7 hours pre-flight briefing.

1367
01:18:38,829 --> 01:18:41,230
And what about the 4
days between missions?

1368
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:42,630
You've only had 2.

1369
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:46,031
I know, I know.
I'm filling in for Charlie.

1370
01:18:46,631 --> 01:18:48,632
You could watch the rest
of the inning, anyway.

1371
01:18:48,832 --> 01:18:50,231
All right, all right.

1372
01:18:50,232 --> 01:18:53,632
Hey, I just noticed those eagles.

1373
01:18:53,633 --> 01:18:55,433
When did you make chicken,
Colonel Dutch?

1374
01:18:55,434 --> 01:18:56,433
Couple weeks ago.

1375
01:18:56,434 --> 01:18:57,833
They figure we needed the raise

1376
01:18:57,834 --> 01:18:59,234
on account of the baby.

1377
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,834
She's not kidding.

1378
01:19:00,835 --> 01:19:04,035
How a Sergeant with 5 kids
makesit, I don't know.

1379
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:06,035
Well, I'll say this much
for General Hawkes.

1380
01:19:06,036 --> 01:19:08,637
He's certainly doing
everything he can for them.

1381
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,237
Struck him out. 2 in a Row.

1382
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:15,839
Honey, I've got to go. Bye.

1383
01:19:16,039 --> 01:19:18,640
Now look, this time I don't
want any penguins.

1384
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,239
I'll bring you a pelican.

1385
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,240
Bye, Tom.

1386
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:22,641
Bye, Colonel.

1387
01:19:25,842 --> 01:19:27,241
What's the matter, Sally?

1388
01:19:27,242 --> 01:19:30,043
Oh, nothing. I was just wondering

1389
01:19:30,243 --> 01:19:31,443
where he's going this time.

1390
01:19:31,643 --> 01:19:33,643
Hello, Sally. How are you?

1391
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:36,044
Oh, hi, Rusty!
I'm fine. How are you?

1392
01:19:36,245 --> 01:19:38,644
Fine, fine. May I present
General Hawkes?

1393
01:19:38,645 --> 01:19:40,045
It's a real pleasure, Mrs. Holland.

1394
01:19:40,046 --> 01:19:41,622
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

1395
01:19:41,646 --> 01:19:42,645
Same here.

1396
01:19:42,646 --> 01:19:44,247
Only I'm a little disappointed.

1397
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:46,446
I thought you'd be breathing fire.

1398
01:19:46,447 --> 01:19:48,448
Well, I usually do.
I just had a flame-out.

1399
01:19:48,648 --> 01:19:51,448
Oh, well, if you're here recruiting,

1400
01:19:51,449 --> 01:19:53,248
please don't take Brewster.

1401
01:19:53,249 --> 01:19:55,249
Oh, no! I'm a great ball fan.

1402
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,449
Oh, good. Why don't you
tell that to Mr. Doyle?

1403
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:58,651
Mr. Doyle, General Hawkes.

1404
01:19:58,851 --> 01:19:59,850
How do you do, Mr. Doyle?

1405
01:19:59,851 --> 01:20:01,050
Thank you for letting us in.

1406
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:02,451
My pleasure. Won't you sit down?

1407
01:20:02,452 --> 01:20:03,652
Thank you.

1408
01:20:03,852 --> 01:20:06,453
So you're the man that
stole my third baseman.

1409
01:20:06,653 --> 01:20:08,653
I wish we could keep him, too.

1410
01:20:08,853 --> 01:20:10,253
I'll bet you do.

1411
01:20:10,254 --> 01:20:12,253
So you're on Mr. Doyle's side, eh?

1412
01:20:12,254 --> 01:20:13,854
Yes, I am.

1413
01:20:13,855 --> 01:20:16,054
Well, we've got a job
to do, Mrs. Holland,

1414
01:20:16,055 --> 01:20:18,656
and getting men like
your husband isn't easy.

1415
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:21,056
Don't tell me your
little problems General.

1416
01:20:21,057 --> 01:20:24,457
I'm only interested in results.

1417
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:25,858
Touche.

1418
01:21:03,268 --> 01:21:04,268
Hello.

1419
01:21:06,466 --> 01:21:08,864
Oh, mother!, it's you.

1420
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:11,662
Nothing, nothing at all.

1421
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:13,261
It's just that every time

1422
01:21:13,262 --> 01:21:16,659
Dutch goes on one of
these missions I just die.

1423
01:21:17,459 --> 01:21:20,456
No, of course he doesn't know.

1424
01:21:20,457 --> 01:21:22,456
No, and he never will.

1425
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:27,052
No, no, but he should
be here any minute.

1426
01:21:27,053 --> 01:21:29,450
Yes, it was a long flight.

1427
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,849
Please don't ask me.

1428
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:32,649
I never know where he's going.

1429
01:21:32,849 --> 01:21:34,048
Look, mother.

1430
01:21:34,248 --> 01:21:36,647
We thought we'd take you all

1431
01:21:36,846 --> 01:21:38,046
to the officers' club.

1432
01:21:38,246 --> 01:21:39,444
You know, for dad's birthday,

1433
01:21:39,445 --> 01:21:42,043
if Dutch is here.

1434
01:21:42,243 --> 01:21:45,441
Well, I haven't had
a chance to ask him yet.

1435
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,040
Oh, here he is. I'll call you back.

1436
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,438
Oh, hi.

1437
01:21:51,837 --> 01:21:53,635
That's a real bear hug.

1438
01:21:53,636 --> 01:21:55,634
Oh, I'm just so glad to see you.

1439
01:21:55,834 --> 01:21:56,634
How are you?

1440
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:57,833
I'm fine.

1441
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:58,832
Was it rough?

1442
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:00,830
No, no. Everything went off fine.

1443
01:22:00,831 --> 01:22:02,030
It was like clockwork.

1444
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:05,027
My shoulder bothered me
the last couple of hours,

1445
01:22:05,028 --> 01:22:06,509
but outside of that...
How's the baby?

1446
01:22:06,627 --> 01:22:08,625
Oh, she's fine. She's still asleep.

1447
01:22:08,626 --> 01:22:09,625
Listen.

1448
01:22:09,626 --> 01:22:11,424
You know, Tuesday is Dad's birthday,

1449
01:22:11,624 --> 01:22:13,622
and I thought we'd take them
to the officers' club.

1450
01:22:13,623 --> 01:22:15,222
You'll still be here, won't you?

1451
01:22:15,422 --> 01:22:16,221
Yeah.

1452
01:22:16,421 --> 01:22:17,421
I think so.

1453
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:19,619
It all depends on
the operations schedule.

1454
01:22:19,819 --> 01:22:21,817
You won't be going
on another mission that soon.

1455
01:22:21,818 --> 01:22:22,817
Honey, I don't know.

1456
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:24,215
All I know is we should be.

1457
01:22:24,216 --> 01:22:25,414
Should be?

1458
01:22:25,415 --> 01:22:27,613
You shouldn't be flying at all.

1459
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:30,611
Dutch, why don't you go
and see the doctor?

1460
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,410
Every time you go
on one of these trips,

1461
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:35,208
when you come back
your shoulder is much worse.

1462
01:22:35,209 --> 01:22:37,007
You know how flight surgeons are.

1463
01:22:37,008 --> 01:22:38,407
It's not that bad.

1464
01:22:38,607 --> 01:22:39,805
I'm not taking any chances.

1465
01:22:39,806 --> 01:22:41,604
Now, honey, I know what I'm doing.

1466
01:22:41,605 --> 01:22:44,002
You're so tired, you don't
know what you're doing.

1467
01:22:44,003 --> 01:22:46,602
All right, all right, all right.

1468
01:22:46,802 --> 01:22:48,599
I'll fix you some breakfast.

1469
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,199
Then you should go to bed.

1470
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:51,798
All right, all right.

1471
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,592
So this will be the first
overseas movement

1472
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:04,989
of an entire jet bomber wing.

1473
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,388
While we're at it,

1474
01:23:06,389 --> 01:23:08,986
we've been ordered to try
something a little special:

1475
01:23:08,987 --> 01:23:10,386
a new record.

1476
01:23:10,387 --> 01:23:15,182
30 B-47s will make a routine
refueling stop at Seattle.

1477
01:23:15,183 --> 01:23:19,181
But the other 15 airplanes
will attempt to fly

1478
01:23:19,381 --> 01:23:22,579
from MacDill to Japan nonstop.

1479
01:23:24,777 --> 01:23:29,174
Now, General Espy has
some additional information.

1480
01:23:33,572 --> 01:23:36,170
The flight will be
7.400 statute miles

1481
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:37,968
in almost 16 hours.

1482
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:40,966
I will fly number one position
of the nonstop group.

1483
01:23:40,967 --> 01:23:42,765
Colonel Holland will fly number 15.

1484
01:23:42,766 --> 01:23:44,364
Lights.

1485
01:23:44,365 --> 01:23:45,763
Now here's the plan.

1486
01:23:45,764 --> 01:23:48,962
This operation will be
carried out in 3 phases.

1487
01:23:49,162 --> 01:23:50,960
First we'll move
the wing bag and baggage.

1488
01:23:50,961 --> 01:23:52,359
Everything, spare engines,

1489
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,357
fuel trucks and maintenance crews.

1490
01:23:54,358 --> 01:23:56,756
Tomorrow at 08:00,
globemaster cargo aircraft

1491
01:23:56,757 --> 01:23:58,555
will load the men and equipment.

1492
01:23:58,556 --> 01:24:02,552
The second starts
the following morning at 06:00

1493
01:24:02,553 --> 01:24:04,551
when our KC-97 tankers will take off

1494
01:24:04,552 --> 01:24:07,149
so as to be in place here...

1495
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:09,148
and here.

1496
01:24:09,149 --> 01:24:11,946
For in-flight refueling
rendezvous with the B-47s,

1497
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:16,543
who will proceed
to destination, Yokote.

1498
01:24:16,544 --> 01:24:18,742
Lights.

1499
01:24:18,743 --> 01:24:22,141
And third, the B-47s
will depart when ordered.

1500
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:24,738
All B-47 combat crews will stand by.

1501
01:24:24,739 --> 01:24:26,337
A word of caution.

1502
01:24:26,338 --> 01:24:28,535
There is a security blackout.

1503
01:24:28,536 --> 01:24:31,734
Let's do it first, then talk about it.

1504
01:26:02,077 --> 01:26:03,475
She's still asleep.

1505
01:26:03,476 --> 01:26:05,273
Does that child sleep all afternoon?

1506
01:26:05,274 --> 01:26:06,274
I have to get home.

1507
01:26:06,275 --> 01:26:07,872
Oh, now, she'll be awake soon.

1508
01:26:07,873 --> 01:26:09,271
You just be patient.

1509
01:26:09,272 --> 01:26:12,470
- Patient? I haven't seen her
since yesterday. - True.

1510
01:26:18,866 --> 01:26:20,265
Hello.

1511
01:26:21,464 --> 01:26:24,861
No, Colonel Holland isn't here.
This is Mrs. Holland.

1512
01:26:24,862 --> 01:26:28,259
Oh, it's long distance,
mother. Tom Doyle.

1513
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:31,057
Hi, Tom. How are you?

1514
01:26:31,058 --> 01:26:33,256
Oh, I'm fine.

1515
01:26:33,257 --> 01:26:35,054
She's just fine.

1516
01:26:35,055 --> 01:26:37,653
No, he's over at the base.

1517
01:26:37,654 --> 01:26:40,052
You can reach him at MacDill.

1518
01:26:42,451 --> 01:26:43,850
I see.

1519
01:26:45,449 --> 01:26:47,248
Yeah, I see.

1520
01:26:47,447 --> 01:26:49,445
Oh, I'm sure he can.

1521
01:26:49,446 --> 01:26:52,444
Oh, yeah, me?
You know I'm all for it.

1522
01:26:52,844 --> 01:26:53,643
Fine.

1523
01:26:53,644 --> 01:26:55,442
Fine, then I'll see you in a few days.

1524
01:26:55,642 --> 01:26:56,841
Bye, Tom.

1525
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:58,640
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

1526
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,638
God bless Tom Doyle, Brewster,

1527
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:01,719
and everybody in St. Louis.

1528
01:27:01,838 --> 01:27:02,838
What's come over you?

1529
01:27:03,037 --> 01:27:04,213
Oh, the most wonderfull
thing just happened!

1530
01:27:04,237 --> 01:27:05,036
What?

1531
01:27:05,236 --> 01:27:06,236
Brewster broke his leg.

1532
01:27:06,435 --> 01:27:08,233
Oh, wonderful? The poor boy.

1533
01:27:08,234 --> 01:27:10,033
Oh, I'm sorry about it, of course,

1534
01:27:10,233 --> 01:27:12,031
but don't you see?
This puts Tom in a spot,

1535
01:27:12,032 --> 01:27:14,029
and he wants Dutch to come back
and finish the season.

1536
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:17,227
You know, I'd almost forgotten
Dutch was a baseball player.

1537
01:27:17,228 --> 01:27:19,226
Oh, gosh, so had he.

1538
01:27:19,227 --> 01:27:21,026
Oh, but he'd never turn Tom down.

1539
01:27:21,226 --> 01:27:22,225
He'd love this,

1540
01:27:22,226 --> 01:27:24,224
and you know,
this settles everything.

1541
01:27:24,424 --> 01:27:25,622
Well, if you're going
to St. Louis,

1542
01:27:25,623 --> 01:27:27,422
I'd say it unsettles everything.

1543
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:28,820
Oh, no, Mom.

1544
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:32,218
No more long missions,
no more worrying.

1545
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:34,216
Sally, I hope it all
works out for you.

1546
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:35,617
Oh, it will, Mom. It really will.

1547
01:27:35,816 --> 01:27:36,616
Where are you going?

1548
01:27:36,816 --> 01:27:38,814
I have to find the sports page

1549
01:27:38,815 --> 01:27:40,413
to catch up on a few things.

1550
01:27:40,613 --> 01:27:44,810
You know, I don't even know
the Cardinal lineup anymore.

1551
01:27:44,811 --> 01:27:47,408
Well, this just came out of the blue.

1552
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:51,007
You know I want to do everything
I possibly can to help.

1553
01:27:51,806 --> 01:27:53,404
Uh-huh, yeah.

1554
01:27:53,405 --> 01:27:54,804
That's right.

1555
01:27:56,203 --> 01:27:58,202
Well, let me call you
in an hour, huh, Tom?

1556
01:27:58,402 --> 01:27:59,601
What's your number?

1557
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,799
What is it?

1558
01:28:03,798 --> 01:28:05,197
4728.

1559
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:06,996
I'll call you in an hour.

1560
01:28:07,196 --> 01:28:08,196
Right.

1561
01:28:28,383 --> 01:28:29,781
- Hi.
- Hi.

1562
01:28:29,782 --> 01:28:30,781
Did Tom get you?

1563
01:28:30,782 --> 01:28:32,780
Yeah, yeah. Talked to him twice.

1564
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:33,979
You know, he called here first,

1565
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,377
and he told me all about it.

1566
01:28:35,378 --> 01:28:37,777
I suppose you'll still have
to make the flight, anyway.

1567
01:28:37,977 --> 01:28:39,375
Well, we've been standing by all day

1568
01:28:39,376 --> 01:28:41,373
for weather and word from S.A.C.

1569
01:28:41,374 --> 01:28:43,373
How soon can you get away?

1570
01:28:44,572 --> 01:28:46,571
Sally, I had to turn Tom down.

1571
01:28:51,568 --> 01:28:55,764
I had to make a decision,
and I made it.

1572
01:28:55,765 --> 01:28:57,564
I'm not getting out at all.

1573
01:28:57,764 --> 01:28:59,763
I'm staying in the Air Force
permanently.

1574
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:02,761
Oh, you don't...

1575
01:29:02,961 --> 01:29:04,360
I know it's rough on you.

1576
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,759
I know how you feel.

1577
01:29:05,959 --> 01:29:07,956
I took all that into consideration,

1578
01:29:07,957 --> 01:29:10,556
but when I got rigth
down to rock bottom,

1579
01:29:10,756 --> 01:29:13,754
this was the only thing I could do.

1580
01:29:13,954 --> 01:29:16,351
But you've served your 21 months.

1581
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:18,750
There's no use arguing.
It's all settled.

1582
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:20,349
I've signed up.

1583
01:29:21,749 --> 01:29:25,745
You just went ahead and made
this decision all by yourself?

1584
01:29:25,746 --> 01:29:27,745
There are some decisions
you have to make alone.

1585
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:30,742
So this is going to be it?

1586
01:29:30,743 --> 01:29:32,142
The Air Force...

1587
01:29:32,342 --> 01:29:34,739
for the rest of your life
and mine.

1588
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:37,737
One station after another,
one mission after another.

1589
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:41,736
And you just walk in here
and calmly tell me this.

1590
01:29:41,936 --> 01:29:43,134
Well, there are times

1591
01:29:43,135 --> 01:29:44,733
when you are given
certain responsibilities.

1592
01:29:44,734 --> 01:29:45,932
You can't ignore them.

1593
01:29:45,933 --> 01:29:48,132
Well don't you have
any responsibilities

1594
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:49,730
to Hope and me?

1595
01:29:49,731 --> 01:29:51,728
Is it always General Hawkes?

1596
01:29:51,729 --> 01:29:54,726
General Hawkes didn't have
anything to do with it.

1597
01:29:54,727 --> 01:29:56,725
Oh, he's been working
on you for months.

1598
01:29:56,726 --> 01:29:58,125
Flattering you, promoting you.

1599
01:29:58,325 --> 01:30:00,323
Sally, if there was a war on,

1600
01:30:00,324 --> 01:30:01,922
you wouldn't question any of this.

1601
01:30:01,923 --> 01:30:03,521
Well, that's just it. There isn't.

1602
01:30:03,522 --> 01:30:05,719
But there is a kind of war.

1603
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,718
We've got to stay ready to figth

1604
01:30:07,719 --> 01:30:09,317
without fighting.

1605
01:30:09,318 --> 01:30:10,716
That's even tougher.

1606
01:30:10,717 --> 01:30:12,515
That's why I made this decision.

1607
01:30:12,516 --> 01:30:14,714
You made it. We didn't.

1608
01:30:14,715 --> 01:30:17,312
All these months
I kept telling myself,

1609
01:30:17,313 --> 01:30:19,710
"It isn't how much
you're together that counts.

1610
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:21,710
"It's that you are together.

1611
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:24,708
And... and now, suddenly,
we're not together at all.

1612
01:30:26,307 --> 01:30:28,106
Oh, Dutch, what's happened to you?

1613
01:30:28,306 --> 01:30:30,305
I just don't even know you anymore.

1614
01:30:31,304 --> 01:30:33,302
I... I'm still the same.

1615
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:36,701
And here I am all alone
with a stranger.

1616
01:30:54,489 --> 01:30:56,088
Colonel Holland.

1617
01:30:57,087 --> 01:30:58,686
Ok, I'll be right over.

1618
01:31:12,877 --> 01:31:16,475
Word just came through
from S.A.C. I have to go.

1619
01:31:20,073 --> 01:31:22,471
Sally, I can't go this way.

1620
01:31:22,671 --> 01:31:25,070
What difference does it make?

1621
01:31:26,469 --> 01:31:29,266
We couldn't be any farther apart,

1622
01:31:29,267 --> 01:31:31,665
even if you were in Tokyo.

1623
01:31:50,253 --> 01:31:52,252
Hey, Dutch, let's go!

1624
01:32:16,237 --> 01:32:19,034
Armadillo flying taxi runway 2-2,

1625
01:32:19,035 --> 01:32:21,233
wind is south 1-0.

1626
01:32:21,234 --> 01:32:23,032
Altimeter 3-0-1-1.

1627
01:34:16,959 --> 01:34:19,358
Hello, Sergeant.
This is Mrs. Holland.

1628
01:34:19,558 --> 01:34:21,357
Can you please tell me

1629
01:34:21,556 --> 01:34:23,954
if Colonel Holland has left yet?

1630
01:34:23,955 --> 01:34:25,953
You what?

1631
01:34:25,954 --> 01:34:27,353
You don't...

1632
01:34:27,553 --> 01:34:30,751
W... well, then where can
I find General Castle?

1633
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:33,948
The control tower.

1634
01:34:34,948 --> 01:34:35,948
No, nevermind.

1635
01:34:57,733 --> 01:35:00,132
Where can I find General Castle?

1636
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:03,528
Has Dutch left yet?

1637
01:35:03,529 --> 01:35:04,928
Oh, I'm sorry, Sally,

1638
01:35:04,929 --> 01:35:06,327
but Dutch took off
about 5 minutes ago.

1639
01:35:06,328 --> 01:35:09,125
Oh, there's something I've got to
hell him. I can't let him go this way.

1640
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:10,924
I wish there was something
we could do, Mrs. Holland.

1641
01:35:10,925 --> 01:35:14,123
Well, I'm affraid there isn't, General,
and I hope you're satisfied.

1642
01:35:14,323 --> 01:35:16,920
Wasn't one war enough for
you without calling him back

1643
01:35:16,921 --> 01:35:18,319
just when he was beginning to live?

1644
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,695
And you gonna let him go on and on?

1645
01:35:19,719 --> 01:35:21,117
How much more do you want?

1646
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:22,317
Sally.

1647
01:35:22,517 --> 01:35:24,158
I'm sorry you fell
that way, Mrs. Holland,

1648
01:35:24,316 --> 01:35:25,915
but I want you
to understand one thing.

1649
01:35:26,715 --> 01:35:28,712
This was Dutch's decision, not mine.

1650
01:35:28,713 --> 01:35:30,911
His decision because
you maneuvered him into it.

1651
01:35:30,912 --> 01:35:33,110
Promoting him, putting him
in important jobs.

1652
01:35:33,111 --> 01:35:35,508
Now let's get one thing straight.

1653
01:35:35,509 --> 01:35:37,907
If you think I promoted him
because he was Dutch Holland,

1654
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:39,706
you underestimate him.

1655
01:35:39,906 --> 01:35:41,904
He's an exceptional commander.

1656
01:35:41,905 --> 01:35:44,102
Dutch earned this the hard way.

1657
01:35:44,103 --> 01:35:45,824
I just hope he can
get through this mission.

1658
01:35:45,902 --> 01:35:46,902
There any reason.

1659
01:35:46,903 --> 01:35:48,100
He shouldn't be on this mission?

1660
01:35:48,101 --> 01:35:49,100
I think there's every reason.

1661
01:35:49,101 --> 01:35:51,698
And someday, when he
cracks, it's gonna be

1662
01:35:51,699 --> 01:35:54,297
because you didn't
give him any choice.

1663
01:35:54,897 --> 01:35:56,695
Mrs. Holland...

1664
01:35:56,895 --> 01:35:59,294
I, too, have no choice.

1665
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:40,867
45 aircraft now airbone, Dutch.

1666
01:36:44,065 --> 01:36:46,662
OK, navigator, how we doing?

1667
01:36:46,663 --> 01:36:48,461
On course.

1668
01:36:48,462 --> 01:36:50,260
On time, Dutch.

1669
01:36:50,261 --> 01:36:51,660
Roger.

1670
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,258
In 6 minutes the formation
will break up,

1671
01:36:54,259 --> 01:36:57,456
and we'll proceed on
our individual flight plan.

1672
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,838
There's our fuel tanker.

1673
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:26,638
Right on schedule.

1674
01:37:41,828 --> 01:37:44,626
Air Force 3-4-1-1,

1675
01:37:44,826 --> 01:37:47,025
what'll you have, ethyl or regular?

1676
01:37:48,224 --> 01:37:51,422
Ah, whatever you've got.
Just fill her up.

1677
01:37:55,219 --> 01:37:57,217
Your slipway doors are open.

1678
01:37:57,218 --> 01:37:58,617
Receptacle clear.

1679
01:37:58,817 --> 01:38:00,215
Everything looks normal.

1680
01:38:00,216 --> 01:38:01,615
Tanker ready for contact.

1681
01:38:01,815 --> 01:38:03,614
Receiver ready for contact.

1682
01:38:03,814 --> 01:38:05,213
Forward 2.

1683
01:38:06,612 --> 01:38:08,210
Stand by for contact.

1684
01:38:08,211 --> 01:38:09,810
Roger.

1685
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:12,808
Contact.

1686
01:38:13,008 --> 01:38:13,808
Contact.

1687
01:38:14,007 --> 01:38:15,007
Roger.

1688
01:38:31,596 --> 01:38:32,994
Up 3.

1689
01:38:32,995 --> 01:38:35,193
Your position is good.

1690
01:38:35,194 --> 01:38:37,992
Fuel pressure 35 pounds.

1691
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:41,389
Tranfer completed.

1692
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:42,789
Disconect when ready.

1693
01:38:42,989 --> 01:38:44,188
Roger.

1694
01:39:08,772 --> 01:39:11,170
Just caught a sports
broadcast, Dutch.

1695
01:39:11,171 --> 01:39:13,169
You're front page news.

1696
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,167
All about your passing up baseball

1697
01:39:15,168 --> 01:39:16,766
for an Air Force career.

1698
01:39:16,767 --> 01:39:18,765
Call that news, huh?

1699
01:39:18,766 --> 01:39:21,163
How about you, Ike?
Made up your mind yet?

1700
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:22,762
You staying in?

1701
01:39:22,763 --> 01:39:24,561
Oh, I guess I might as well.

1702
01:39:24,562 --> 01:39:27,360
Seems like quite a few of
the boys are staying in.

1703
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,759
You started quite a fashion, Dutch.

1704
01:39:54,743 --> 01:39:56,940
We bumped into
a 129 headwind, Dutch.

1705
01:39:56,941 --> 01:39:58,939
Jet stream.

1706
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:01,339
40 knots faster than briefed.

1707
01:40:01,539 --> 01:40:03,737
We've lost 13 minutos already.

1708
01:40:10,133 --> 01:40:12,132
Well...

1709
01:40:12,133 --> 01:40:15,133
Well, we better do
something about that, Ike.

1710
01:40:16,133 --> 01:40:17,533
Leo, what do you think?

1711
01:40:17,733 --> 01:40:19,732
Think we better try
and get over it?

1712
01:40:19,733 --> 01:40:22,933
If we stay under it,
we'll use too much fuel,

1713
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,934
that's for sure.

1714
01:40:25,134 --> 01:40:27,110
How much higher do you think
we'll have to go, Ike,

1715
01:40:27,134 --> 01:40:28,533
to get out of the jet stream?

1716
01:40:28,534 --> 01:40:32,333
Oh, maybe 2 or 3.000 feet.

1717
01:40:32,334 --> 01:40:35,133
Well, that altitude's
kinda critical for us

1718
01:40:35,134 --> 01:40:36,733
at this weight.

1719
01:40:36,734 --> 01:40:39,333
I think maybe we better try it, though.

1720
01:40:39,334 --> 01:40:41,535
Here we go.

1721
01:40:58,735 --> 01:41:01,535
Well, that's about
as high as she'll go.

1722
01:41:03,736 --> 01:41:05,936
How much longer we got, Ike?

1723
01:41:06,936 --> 01:41:08,936
5 hours, 11 minutes.

1724
01:41:09,136 --> 01:41:10,935
Well, we're preactically there.

1725
01:41:10,936 --> 01:41:13,935
I went crazy the first 10 hours.

1726
01:41:13,936 --> 01:41:15,535
My hellmet's killing me,

1727
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:17,936
and I feel like I'm sitting
on a block of concrete.

1728
01:41:18,136 --> 01:41:20,735
I'll trade you that block of concrete

1729
01:41:20,736 --> 01:41:22,737
for this picket fence
I'm sitting on.

1730
01:41:23,937 --> 01:41:25,936
You guys should've been navigators.

1731
01:41:25,937 --> 01:41:27,737
At least you can get off this seat

1732
01:41:27,937 --> 01:41:29,537
once in a while.

1733
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:40,539
Air Force 3-4-1-1,

1734
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:42,139
This is Yokota tower.

1735
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:45,741
Ceiling is still variable
from 1 to 400 feet.

1736
01:42:45,941 --> 01:42:46,941
Fog.

1737
01:42:47,141 --> 01:42:50,740
Visibility varying
from 1/4 mile to 2 miles.

1738
01:42:50,741 --> 01:42:52,740
Occasionally zero.

1739
01:42:52,741 --> 01:42:54,740
Uh, how about the other airplanes?

1740
01:42:54,741 --> 01:42:56,740
They all land OK, Yokota?

1741
01:42:56,741 --> 01:42:57,740
Affirmative.

1742
01:42:57,741 --> 01:42:59,341
The last one barely made it.

1743
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:01,341
Conditions may improve
in 30 minutes.

1744
01:43:01,541 --> 01:43:02,541
Can you hold?

1745
01:43:02,741 --> 01:43:06,341
Well, I... not if I have
to go to an alternate.

1746
01:43:06,542 --> 01:43:07,941
What's the forecast?

1747
01:43:07,942 --> 01:43:13,142
3-4-1-1, Okinawa is reporting
broken and still V.F.R.

1748
01:43:13,742 --> 01:43:16,142
Your other alternates
are still instrument

1749
01:43:16,342 --> 01:43:17,541
and bellow minimums.

1750
01:43:17,542 --> 01:43:20,341
Well, If I'm going to Okinawa,
I have to leave right now.

1751
01:43:20,342 --> 01:43:22,142
My fuel reserve's low.

1752
01:43:22,742 --> 01:43:25,142
Uh, stand by, Yokota.

1753
01:43:25,342 --> 01:43:27,142
Roger.

1754
01:43:48,544 --> 01:43:50,744
Yokota, this is 3-4-1-1.

1755
01:43:50,944 --> 01:43:54,744
Proceeding to Kadena
Air Force base, Okinawa.

1756
01:43:54,944 --> 01:43:55,944
Roger.

1757
01:43:56,144 --> 01:43:57,744
Yokota tower out.

1758
01:44:07,544 --> 01:44:09,744
Air Force jet 3-4-1-1.

1759
01:44:09,745 --> 01:44:11,745
This is Kadena aproach control.

1760
01:44:11,945 --> 01:44:14,144
You're now 68 miles out.

1761
01:44:14,145 --> 01:44:15,545
Weather getting worse.

1762
01:44:15,745 --> 01:44:17,144
Ceiling dropping rapidly.

1763
01:44:17,145 --> 01:44:19,145
You've got 3 miles and 500 feet.

1764
01:44:19,345 --> 01:44:20,744
Now you tell me.

1765
01:44:20,745 --> 01:44:22,744
That's a fine how do you do, Kadena.

1766
01:44:22,745 --> 01:44:24,145
I got 11 minutes fuel

1767
01:44:24,345 --> 01:44:25,744
and 9 more minutes to go.

1768
01:44:25,745 --> 01:44:28,145
It's gonna be a close one.

1769
01:44:29,746 --> 01:44:32,145
Air Force jet 3-4-1-1,

1770
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:34,945
contact GCA on 1-18.2

1771
01:44:34,946 --> 01:44:38,146
and stand by for immediate
jet penetration.

1772
01:44:39,346 --> 01:44:41,146
Affirmative. Affirmative.

1773
01:44:43,746 --> 01:44:46,145
Air Force jet 3-4-1-1,

1774
01:44:46,146 --> 01:44:48,946
You're cleared for immediate
jet penetration.

1775
01:45:28,148 --> 01:45:29,548
Dutch?

1776
01:45:34,949 --> 01:45:36,348
Hey, Leo.

1777
01:45:36,349 --> 01:45:38,549
Yeah, Dutch?

1778
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,549
There's...

1779
01:45:40,749 --> 01:45:42,549
There's something wrong. I...

1780
01:45:46,749 --> 01:45:47,749
Leo...

1781
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:49,149
I...

1782
01:45:51,149 --> 01:45:54,149
I can't move my right arm, Leo.

1783
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:57,149
Leo, you take ahold of the throttles.

1784
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:58,750
Reduce your power 10%.

1785
01:45:58,950 --> 01:46:00,750
Roger.

1786
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:03,750
A little more.

1787
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:05,750
Hup. There you are.

1788
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:10,749
All right, now...

1789
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:13,150
You handle the throttles,

1790
01:46:13,151 --> 01:46:15,550
I'll handle the controls, OK?

1791
01:46:15,551 --> 01:46:17,151
Roger.

1792
01:46:19,751 --> 01:46:22,151
Wheater now reporting 100 feet.

1793
01:46:22,351 --> 01:46:24,750
Visibility 1/4 of a mile.

1794
01:46:24,751 --> 01:46:27,351
Advise you hold east
of the outer marker.

1795
01:46:27,551 --> 01:46:28,551
Uh, negative.

1796
01:46:28,751 --> 01:46:30,150
Negative, Kadena.

1797
01:46:30,151 --> 01:46:31,951
I can't hold.

1798
01:46:32,951 --> 01:46:34,552
I'm committed.

1799
01:46:34,752 --> 01:46:37,151
I don't have enough fuel
to go around.

1800
01:46:37,152 --> 01:46:39,551
Go on now. Bring me on in.

1801
01:46:39,552 --> 01:46:42,752
Affirmative. Continue your penetration.

1802
01:46:46,552 --> 01:46:48,552
Air Force jet 3-4-1-1,

1803
01:46:48,752 --> 01:46:50,551
This is your final controller.

1804
01:46:50,552 --> 01:46:53,551
You need not acknowledge
any further transmissions.

1805
01:46:53,552 --> 01:46:56,152
You're 6 miles
from the end of the runway,

1806
01:46:56,153 --> 01:46:58,152
40 feet above the glide path.

1807
01:46:58,153 --> 01:46:59,553
Increase your rate of descent.

1808
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:07,553
You have now passed

1809
01:47:07,753 --> 01:47:09,553
through the GCA minimums.

1810
01:47:09,753 --> 01:47:12,753
I will hold your rate of descent.

1811
01:47:15,153 --> 01:47:17,153
You're right at the center line.

1812
01:47:17,154 --> 01:47:19,954
Steer to a heading of 1-7-5 degrees.

1813
01:47:21,154 --> 01:47:23,753
All right. Back another 5%, Leo.

1814
01:47:23,754 --> 01:47:25,153
Roger.

1815
01:47:25,154 --> 01:47:26,754
A little more.

1816
01:47:26,954 --> 01:47:29,153
Now forward.

1817
01:47:29,154 --> 01:47:30,554
A little more.

1818
01:47:30,754 --> 01:47:32,554
All right. Back a little.

1819
01:47:32,754 --> 01:47:34,953
There you are. Hold it.

1820
01:47:34,954 --> 01:47:36,954
Your course is good.

1821
01:47:36,955 --> 01:47:39,155
Your rate of descent is good.

1822
01:47:39,355 --> 01:47:41,554
Now steer to 1-8-0 degrees.

1823
01:47:41,555 --> 01:47:44,554
You're on glide path.
You're on course.

1824
01:47:44,555 --> 01:47:46,955
Your heading is 1-8-0 degrees.

1825
01:47:47,155 --> 01:47:50,154
You're on glide path.
You're on course.

1826
01:47:50,155 --> 01:47:53,154
You're 2 miles
from the end of the runway.

1827
01:47:53,155 --> 01:47:55,954
Your heading is 1-8-0 degrees.

1828
01:47:55,955 --> 01:47:57,955
Your rate of descent is good.

1829
01:47:57,956 --> 01:47:59,355
You're on course.

1830
01:47:59,356 --> 01:48:02,155
You're approaching the end
of the runway.

1831
01:48:02,156 --> 01:48:04,556
You're now over
the end of the runway.

1832
01:48:04,756 --> 01:48:05,756
Take over visually.

1833
01:48:05,956 --> 01:48:08,556
We're breaking out, Dutch.
I can see the ground.

1834
01:48:10,156 --> 01:48:12,155
All right, back a little more.

1835
01:48:12,156 --> 01:48:14,556
I got the runway.

1836
01:48:15,756 --> 01:48:17,756
Hold up. Hold up.

1837
01:48:17,757 --> 01:48:19,157
All the way back.

1838
01:48:19,357 --> 01:48:20,957
All the way back, Leo.

1839
01:48:21,157 --> 01:48:23,357
All right, fine. Pop the chute.

1840
01:48:46,358 --> 01:48:48,558
Thanks, GCA.

1841
01:48:48,758 --> 01:48:50,958
Thanks for getting us down, fellas.

1842
01:48:59,159 --> 01:49:01,158
Surprised you can use
that arm at all.

1843
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:03,158
Well, the inflammation's
gone down already, sir.

1844
01:49:03,159 --> 01:49:04,359
In just 3 days.

1845
01:49:04,559 --> 01:49:07,958
I ordered you back to
Omaha, Colonel Holland,

1846
01:49:07,959 --> 01:49:09,958
because of this medical report.

1847
01:49:09,959 --> 01:49:11,958
It indicates a chronic condition.

1848
01:49:11,959 --> 01:49:13,758
Might happen again any time.

1849
01:49:13,759 --> 01:49:16,159
Especially on long,
high altitude flights.

1850
01:49:16,359 --> 01:49:17,959
I suppose that's true, General.

1851
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:23,159
You know, I ougth to throw
the book at you.

1852
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,159
For not following
existing instructions

1853
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:27,960
about reporting to a flight
surgeon after an accident.

1854
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:30,759
For concealing a condition
that could have grounded you.

1855
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:31,960
Yes, sir.

1856
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,759
What you did could have resulted

1857
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,759
in the loss of your
aircraft and your crew.

1858
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,159
Until this last mission, sir,

1859
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,760
It was nothing more than annoying.

1860
01:49:40,761 --> 01:49:42,760
I wouldn't have taken such a risk.

1861
01:49:42,761 --> 01:49:45,161
I'm inclined to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

1862
01:49:46,961 --> 01:49:48,961
I suppose you know
you're all through flying.

1863
01:49:50,961 --> 01:49:52,560
Yes, sir.

1864
01:49:52,561 --> 01:49:54,961
You can't command
an operational unit.

1865
01:49:55,161 --> 01:49:57,960
You can stay in,
of course, at a ground job.

1866
01:49:57,961 --> 01:49:59,561
Would you like that?

1867
01:50:02,562 --> 01:50:04,362
No, sir.

1868
01:50:06,162 --> 01:50:07,562
I didn't think you would.

1869
01:50:09,362 --> 01:50:11,161
I'm going to let you go.

1870
01:50:11,162 --> 01:50:13,162
You're out of the
Air Force as of now.

1871
01:50:14,762 --> 01:50:16,362
Is your wife here yet?

1872
01:50:16,562 --> 01:50:17,761
No, sir.

1873
01:50:17,762 --> 01:50:19,762
I haven't seen her
since we left MacDill.

1874
01:50:20,762 --> 01:50:23,163
I don't suppose you can play
much ball with that shoulder.

1875
01:50:24,363 --> 01:50:25,163
No, sir.

1876
01:50:25,363 --> 01:50:26,962
Not this season, anyway, sir.

1877
01:50:26,963 --> 01:50:28,162
What are to do?

1878
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:29,762
I'm sure Tom Doyle

1879
01:50:29,763 --> 01:50:31,762
will have a spot
picked out for me, sir.

1880
01:50:31,763 --> 01:50:34,043
Well, if he doesn't make a
manager out of you, he's crazy.

1881
01:50:35,363 --> 01:50:37,562
Well, that's fine with me.

1882
01:50:37,563 --> 01:50:38,963
Let's hope so.

1883
01:50:39,163 --> 01:50:40,562
Good luck to you.

1884
01:50:40,563 --> 01:50:42,363
I'm sorry it had to end
this way, sir.

1885
01:50:42,563 --> 01:50:44,363
So am I, Holland. Damn sorry.

1886
01:50:44,364 --> 01:50:45,763
I hate to lose you.

1887
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:48,164
Thank you, sir.

1888
01:50:50,364 --> 01:50:52,164
Dutch...

1889
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:55,763
Dutch, I...

1890
01:50:55,764 --> 01:50:59,563
I suppose that you know
better than anybody else...

1891
01:50:59,564 --> 01:51:01,763
what an uphill battle it is
to keep S.A.C. going.

1892
01:51:01,764 --> 01:51:03,565
The job is big

1893
01:51:03,765 --> 01:51:06,164
and the pay is small.

1894
01:51:06,165 --> 01:51:08,565
The things that I've fought for...

1895
01:51:08,765 --> 01:51:10,164
better family housing,

1896
01:51:10,165 --> 01:51:12,565
better breaks for the combat crews

1897
01:51:12,765 --> 01:51:14,164
and the non-coms.

1898
01:51:14,165 --> 01:51:16,364
The things that help us
to get the best people

1899
01:51:16,365 --> 01:51:17,965
and keep the best people.

1900
01:51:19,365 --> 01:51:21,165
And 80% of them,

1901
01:51:21,365 --> 01:51:23,764
reserve officers
and citizen soldiers

1902
01:51:23,765 --> 01:51:25,366
just like you.

1903
01:51:27,366 --> 01:51:28,566
Dutch...

1904
01:51:28,766 --> 01:51:31,365
None of these things
are easy to come by.

1905
01:51:31,366 --> 01:51:32,965
We need all the help we can get.

1906
01:51:32,966 --> 01:51:34,765
Yes, sir.

1907
01:51:34,766 --> 01:51:36,766
I want you to know this:

1908
01:51:38,366 --> 01:51:40,965
The job you did
while you were with us,

1909
01:51:40,966 --> 01:51:43,965
and the decision you made
when you had an easy out,

1910
01:51:43,966 --> 01:51:46,767
gave us more help
than you'll ever realize.

1911
01:51:48,567 --> 01:51:50,167
We're grateful to you.

1912
01:51:51,767 --> 01:51:53,766
I'm glad to hear that, sir.

1913
01:51:53,767 --> 01:51:55,166
General Hawkes,

1914
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:57,166
will you please tell Colonel Holland

1915
01:51:57,167 --> 01:51:58,766
that Mrs. Holland is here?

1916
01:51:58,767 --> 01:52:00,766
She says to tell him
she'll be waiting for him

1917
01:52:00,767 --> 01:52:02,567
in General Wheatley's office.

1918
01:52:03,567 --> 01:52:05,167
Ask her to come in.

1919
01:52:10,368 --> 01:52:11,767
Hello, Sally.

1920
01:52:11,768 --> 01:52:13,767
Remember me? I'm that stranger.

1921
01:52:13,768 --> 01:52:14,767
Well, sure.

1922
01:52:14,768 --> 01:52:16,567
I'd know you anywhere.

1923
01:52:16,568 --> 01:52:18,367
You couldn't fool me.

1924
01:52:18,368 --> 01:52:20,767
I don't care what uniform
you're wearing.

1925
01:52:20,768 --> 01:52:22,568
You're still my husband.

1926
01:52:24,368 --> 01:52:26,367
I'm very proud of you.

1927
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:27,769
I'm ashamed of me.

1928
01:52:28,169 --> 01:52:29,169
We, uh...

1929
01:52:30,169 --> 01:52:33,168
We had a medical report
on that arm, Mrs. Holland.

1930
01:52:33,169 --> 01:52:35,168
I've got to let him go.

1931
01:52:35,169 --> 01:52:37,169
He's all yours.

1932
01:52:39,169 --> 01:52:40,369
Is that it?

1933
01:52:43,169 --> 01:52:44,969
That's it.

1934
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:55,769
That's our new B-47 wing

1935
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:57,770
Flying its first training mission.

1936
01:52:57,970 --> 01:52:59,769
We'll have 4 full new wings

1937
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:01,170
by the end of the year.

1938
01:53:26,771 --> 01:53:28,570
Ride the wind

1939
01:53:28,571 --> 01:53:30,772
Follow a star

1940
01:53:30,972 --> 01:53:32,571
Find the foe

1941
01:53:32,572 --> 01:53:34,972
Strike where they are

1942
01:53:35,172 --> 01:53:36,772
Round the world

1943
01:53:36,972 --> 01:53:38,772
Isn't too far

1944
01:53:38,972 --> 01:53:42,972
When the Air Force takes command
