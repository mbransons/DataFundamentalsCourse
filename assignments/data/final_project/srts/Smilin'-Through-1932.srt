1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,928
Moonyeen, Moonyeen.

3
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:40,499
If only I could be with you.

4
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:43,969
If only I knew the way to you.

5
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:49,107
John, John..

6
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:52,310
My dearest one.

7
00:01:52,377 --> 00:01:54,547
I'm always with you.

8
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:57,315
I'm here whenever you need me.

9
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:59,585
Why must I go
through this any longer?

10
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,954
Be patient, dear heart.

11
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,023
Someday, we'll be
together again.

12
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,727
These years have really
only been but a few moments.

13
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:12,698
And the years we must still
wait will be just as short.

14
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:18,704
Try to hear me, darling.
Sometimes you do.

15
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:23,976
Moonyeen, Moonyeen.

16
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,819
'Sir John, Sir John.'

17
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:36,188
I might have known
you were here.

18
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,260
Confound you, Ellen.
You frighten everybody away.

19
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:44,029
Now, look here, Sir John.

20
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,199
I've told you time and again
no good will come of you

21
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:51,136
wanting to talk with her
who's gone these 30 years.

22
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:52,605
No good?

23
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,542
It's the only thing
that keeps me alive.

24
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:13,526
'Uh, hello, come in.'

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,229
Beg pardon, Sir John.
Dr. Owen.

26
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:18,997
- Hello, John.
- Owen.

27
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:20,666
- Well..
- So, you're back.

28
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,267
Well,
that's the general impression.

29
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,734
Well, well,
how do you find Ireland?

30
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,639
Oh, great fishing,
best in years.

31
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,140
Oh, I missed you, John.

32
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:30,843
You should have come. Change
would have done you good.

33
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,554
- I don't need no change.
- That's where you're wrong.

34
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,580
- What?
- Well..

35
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,782
You know what people
are beginning to say, hmm?

36
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,085
Mmm, I know. They think
I'm a bit touched, eh?

37
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:42,788
Well, it's this confounded
living in the past

38
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,523
and trying to conjure up
ghosts, you know.

39
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,824
It's not doing you any good.

40
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,660
Still we won't talk
about that now.

41
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,261
That's where
you are wrong, Owen.

42
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:52,164
In the first place, I shall live
the kind of life I want to live.

43
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,431
Of course, John.

44
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:55,000
Heaven knows
I'm not interfering.

45
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,235
- I know better than that.
- And now, will you listen?

46
00:03:57,302 --> 00:04:00,539
And in the second place,
I get a great deal of comfort

47
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:03,809
out of what you call
conjuring up ghosts.

48
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,645
You see, I happen to believe
that there are times

49
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:09,648
when Moonyeen
is very close to me.

50
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,350
And I shall continue
to believe so.

51
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,919
Whatever people may think
or say.

52
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:17,923
John, old fellow, I said
let's not talk about it.

53
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,793
- Mind if I take a pew, hmm?
- Sorry, sit down, sit down.

54
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,537
- Have a drink?
- Of course, I'll have a drink.

55
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:24,663
'Good.'

56
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,766
Ah, well, here we are.

57
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:33,706
- John.
- 'Mm-hmm.'

58
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:36,742
Moonyeen's sister is dead.

59
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:39,945
No.

60
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,648
She and her husband
were drowned a few days ago.

61
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,817
A squall struck
their boat off Dublin Bay.

62
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:47,452
- That's horrible.
- Yes.

63
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,454
And that little mite
of theirs is left

64
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:51,624
practically unprovided for.

65
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,826
Yes, yes, I remember.
There was a child.

66
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:56,194
Yes, a little girl.

67
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:59,564
She's a,
she's a lovable little tot.

68
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,702
They're, uh, they're talking of
putting her into an orphanage.

69
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,838
- What? Impossible.
- That's what I thought.

70
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,206
- Yeah.
- So, you see, I..

71
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,242
Now, John.

72
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:13,078
Uh, don't bite my head off but..

73
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,280
What would you say
to having her here?

74
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:18,951
- Here? A child in this house?
- Yeah.

75
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:21,754
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
No, count on me for any amount...

76
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,356
A child is what's
needed in this house.

77
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:26,759
Give you something to think
about besides yourself.

78
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,302
- Out of the question.
- But, John, if you...

79
00:05:28,326 --> 00:05:30,195
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You see what I...

80
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:32,330
Owen, please, let's..

81
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:34,967
Let's drop the subject
if you don't mind.

82
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,572
John, I don't think
I realize until tonight

83
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,050
how much these years
have changed you.

84
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,442
- Oh!
- Your grief's become a habit.

85
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,011
You've grown selfish, morbid.

86
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,689
You'll be good enough not
to interfere in my affairs.

87
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:50,258
You've huddled in your burrow so
long, you've grown to hate life.

88
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:51,750
- I shall do as I...
- Goodnight.

89
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,719
Goodnight.

90
00:05:58,556 --> 00:06:00,659
I'll do as I please.

91
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,266
Huh, ridiculous nonsense.

92
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,769
I'll manage my own life.

93
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:12,871
Nobody's gonna dictate me.

94
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:18,110
Found..
What the..

95
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:22,180
Well, what do you want?

96
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:27,219
Here, now come here,
come here, come..

97
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:30,322
- I don't think I like you.
- Well..

98
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:35,994
Oh, indeed.
I resent that.

99
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:41,499
- Why not?
- You're so grumpy.

100
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,268
I shall tell my daddy.

101
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,873
Oh!

102
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:51,676
Oh, I'm sorry.

103
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,345
I apologize.

104
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:56,715
I had no intention of being
disrespectful, I assure you.

105
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,553
Well, uh,
won't-won't you shake hands?

106
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:04,923
We haven't been introduced.

107
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,259
No, we haven't, have we?

108
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,561
Well, wh-what's your name?

109
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:11,696
Kathleen. What's yours?

110
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,133
Mine is John.
How do you do?

111
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,337
- How do you do?
- How old are you, Kathleen?

112
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:22,140
I'm five in June.
How old are you?

113
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:25,944
Me? Well, I, uh,
I'm a little older than that.

114
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,480
Well..

115
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:32,785
Hey, v-very pretty.

116
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:35,220
This is a new frock.

117
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,089
Very becoming.

118
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:41,159
And I've got on my best panties
with a little tuck.

119
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:43,595
Yes, uh, charming,
charming, uh, uh..

120
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:46,331
W-won't you sit down, Kathleen?

121
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:53,438
Would you, uh..

122
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:56,541
Would you like-like to see
some pretty pictures?

123
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,710
No. No, thank you.

124
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,745
You wouldn't, eh?

125
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,247
Must have had a rough crossing?

126
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:05,750
- Yes, thank you.
- Hmm.

127
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,352
I, uh..

128
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:12,858
Uh, would you care for some...
milk or something?

129
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,393
No. No, thank you.

130
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:22,267
Uh, would you, uh,
by any chance, uh..

131
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,103
like to make your home
with me?

132
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,374
- No. No, thank you.
- Why not?

133
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:33,111
- Don't you like me?
- No. No, thank you.

134
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:36,414
Oh!

135
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:44,522
I-I think I better be going now.

136
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,225
Well, w-won't you say goodbye?

137
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,927
Goodbye.

138
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:58,703
Uh..

139
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,539
'Mr. Toastmaster,
ladies and gentlemen'

140
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:02,941
'and Miss Sheridan.'

141
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,544
It is my pleasure
and my privilege

142
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:07,913
on this auspicious occasion..

143
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,049
- Hear, hear.
- I thank you.

144
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:15,187
to offer my felicitations
to as charming a lady

145
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,355
as ever graced
a bachelor's board.

146
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:19,557
- Hear, hear.
- 'Hooray!'

147
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,293
Hooray! Hooray!

148
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,661
I thank you,
I thank you, thank you.

149
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:26,798
Now, now to blow out
the candles.

150
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,267
Remember, you don't get
your wish

151
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:32,537
unless you blow 'em
all out at once.

152
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:37,409
Now, when I say three,
Kathleen blows.

153
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:40,412
'Ready, one, two..'

154
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:44,682
'...three.'

155
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:48,420
How's that for blowing?

156
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,122
'Nothing wrong
with those lungs.'

157
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,799
Anything else you want me
to blow out around here?

158
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:54,126
- Now, well, what's the wish?
- Yes, what is it? Come on...

159
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:57,195
Now, please,
gentlemen, don't rush me.

160
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:01,166
I wish that
you weren't so generous.

161
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,336
You leave me
nothing to wish for.

162
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:07,472
And what's more, you're the
nicest person in the world.

163
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,141
And I love you tremendously.

164
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:10,919
There, that was rather sweet
of me, wasn't it?

165
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,911
Yes, I think so.

166
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,580
Even allowing
for little exaggeration.

167
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,749
Why do you look at me like that?

168
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:20,085
Strange.

169
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,320
Every year,
you grow more like her.

170
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:25,223
- It's almost uncanny.
- Moonyeen Clare?

171
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,860
- Hmm.
- Oh, but she was beautiful.

172
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,896
Yes, she was beautiful
and charming.

173
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:37,902
You are very like her, my dear.

174
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,605
Thanks, darling.

175
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,775
There, now look at that.
You made me all weepy.

176
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:46,444
I knew it, I knew it.

177
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,647
I've that
confounded thimble again.

178
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:52,650
Ah-ha, the ring.

179
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:53,952
Good Lord, a wedding.

180
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,553
- Willie Ainley.
- Oh, help.

181
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,223
- 'Willie's not a bad fella.'
- Willie is a dear.

182
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,760
"I say, you know, Kathleen,
I'm frightfully gone on you.

183
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:06,598
I'm not a bad sort of chap.
I'm steady, I'm reliable."

184
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,067
Oh, come, you mustn't
make fun of Willie.

185
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,103
'"Oh, you could always rely
on my being'

186
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:13,638
'just as I am now.
I should never change."'

187
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:17,175
'Look here, old girl. I can't
talk the romantic stuff.'

188
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:19,978
'But I think
you are simply ripping.'

189
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,613
I am dripping, Willie.

190
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,516
No, but look here, Kathleen,
I've simply got to talk to you.

191
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:29,454
It's my last chance. You know
I'm going to camp tomorrow.

192
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:49,041
Whatever induced you to drag me
miles from home in a storm.

193
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:51,176
But the paper said fine

194
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,712
and it wasn't raining
when we started.

195
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,883
Well, what are you going to do?

196
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,786
I can't think.

197
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:05,490
There hasn't been a soul inside
this house in nearly 50 years.

198
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:17,535
There will be two of us
inside within 50 seconds.

199
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,304
Oh, my.

200
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,852
Isn't that a candle?

201
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,554
Wait a jiffy.

202
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,370
Willie, do you mean
to say that nobody's been

203
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,096
in this house for 50 years?

204
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:46,298
'Uh-huh.'

205
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:50,368
You know, Willie, there's
some sort of mystery here.

206
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:55,073
People don't go away
and leave a house like this.

207
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,741
'Why didn't the maid
tidy things up?'

208
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:59,211
'Put that chair on its legs,
the nighties of the furniture?'

209
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:02,280
'Well, why worry about it?'

210
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:05,217
'People were afraid
to come into this room.'

211
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:07,051
Something had happened here,
something..

212
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,686
Something strange and terrible.

213
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:11,256
You have got
an uncomfortable mind.

214
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,592
They locked the doors
and went away for ever.

215
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,694
As though there were a curse
on the house.

216
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:19,097
I say, you know,
you're giving me the creeps.

217
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:31,042
- Willie!
- Oh, good heavens.

218
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:34,479
- What is it now?
- A wedding invitation.

219
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:39,384
"Mr. and Mrs. Richard Clare
of Castle Clare, Wicklow

220
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,953
"request the pleasure of
the company of Jeremy Wayne... "

221
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:44,756
"Jeremy Wayne, on the occasion
of the marriage

222
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:48,926
of their daughter, Moonyeen
with Sir John Carteret."

223
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,662
By Jove, Sir John.

224
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:54,132
Moonyeen Clare,
my mother's sister.

225
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,434
But they never were married.
She died that year.

226
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,871
It was the tragedy
of Uncle John's life.

227
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:02,607
Strange.

228
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,542
Do you suppose it could be
linked in some way

229
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:07,512
with this house?
With this man?

230
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,448
- Beats me.
- Look at this.

231
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:13,117
When Jeremy Wayne got it,
he crushed it in his hand

232
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:17,422
and threw it away.
Why would he do that?

233
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:21,293
Probably he was blotto.
He's emptied half the decanter.

234
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:24,429
Don't be an ass, Willie.
It's as clear as day.

235
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:32,069
'Jeremy Wayne.
He loved her too.'

236
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:35,139
I know what happened
in this room.

237
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,141
- He killed himself.
- What?

238
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,044
That's why they closed the doors
and left things as they were.

239
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,879
He couldn't face life
without her.

240
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,951
They found him here.

241
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,763
'Just a log.'

242
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:03,435
Don't you think perhaps
we'd better get out of here?

243
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,833
Shh. A carriage.

244
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,973
Do you suppose
it's a real carriage?

245
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,608
Shh.

246
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:25,917
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

247
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,785
How do you do?

248
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:34,258
- Uh, ghastly weather, isn't it?
- Ghastly.

249
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,729
- Ghastly.
- Yeah, ghastly.

250
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:39,731
You were caught
in the storm, I suppose.

251
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:41,633
Yes. Yes.

252
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,236
Yes.

253
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:46,704
Pardon me if I'm inquisitive

254
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:49,106
but are you, uh,
are you stopping here?

255
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:50,775
Oh, dear, no.

256
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,944
No, I-it was raining
very heavily.

257
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,855
We were standing under a tree
and the lightning hit

258
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,950
the next tree and, uh,
a-and killed two cows.

259
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:01,686
Cows? What cows?

260
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,054
Yes, two cows.

261
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,790
No, three.
Yeah, I saw the bodies.

262
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,866
Oh, so then we broke in
to get out of the storm.

263
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:19,937
Yeah, we were, we were all wet.

264
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:21,373
Oh, yeah?

265
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,343
I wish the place
were more comfortable for you.

266
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,612
Oh, I am glad
you were able to make the fire.

267
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:39,357
Yeah, uh, thank you,
thank you, I can do that.

268
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:41,258
Oh, thank you.

269
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:45,997
Oh, I'm afraid
you've got a cold.

270
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:48,500
Yeah, I wish I could
offer you something warm.

271
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:51,469
Excuse me. You mind
if I take this for a moment?

272
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:54,372
- Well, really...
- I, uh, I shan't be long.

273
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:00,344
- Who on earth is he?
- I've a pretty good idea.

274
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,979
- Well..
- Watch him.

275
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:03,624
Did you see the way
he looked at that silver?

276
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,517
Oh, don't be silly.

277
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:11,022
- 'Oh, boy.'
- Shh!

278
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,528
Got something under his arm.

279
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:22,434
The very thing for you.
Old port.

280
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,137
Look.

281
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:30,141
- 1847.
- 47?

282
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:34,045
That's the best I could find.
A-any old port in the storm.

283
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:37,782
Perhaps, we should introduce
ourselves.

284
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,151
- My name's Ainley.
- Oh, I'm pleased to meet you.

285
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,432
Well, you surely don't
intend to open that.

286
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,890
- Do you?
- I'm going to do my best.

287
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:48,192
But, uh, really, you know,
it isn't your property.

288
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:51,162
That's a nice point,
but I'll take it up later.

289
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:54,165
Do you realize
that stuff's worth

290
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:55,667
three or four pounds a bottle?

291
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,802
Ah, it ought to be pretty good.

292
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:02,674
Well, are you going to sit there
and be a p-party to this?

293
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,511
- I thought of doing just that.
- There we are.

294
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,913
Oh, you mind?

295
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,853
- Thank you.
- Not at all, not at all.

296
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:21,425
Oh, just a very little.

297
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,161
That's enough. When!

298
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:26,030
Fellow criminal.

299
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:33,170
- Won't you join us?
- Certainly not.

300
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:34,739
Oh!

301
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,312
How, uh, how about a toast?

302
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:43,314
- I know one.
- Yeah?

303
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,316
Here's to your health,
your honor

304
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:48,620
and the health of all your
descendants, great and small.

305
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:52,924
That's a mighty handsome toast.

306
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,692
It's an Irish toast,
the best I know.

307
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,328
Now, you keep as young
and as pretty as you are

308
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:59,764
until doomsday.

309
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,099
And never forget the man
who wished it.

310
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:13,010
I wonder now as I look at you,
have we never met before?

311
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:16,581
No, I guess we haven't.
I shouldn't have forgotten.

312
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,583
Could you be Irish too?

313
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,618
Yeah, I could
if I saw enough of you.

314
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:23,354
Well, if you're not Irish,
you're American.

315
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,989
- How do you know that?
- Oh!

316
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:28,760
- By the way you said ghastly.
- Now, how should I say it?

317
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:32,329
Well, if you mean
how do I say it, ghastly.

318
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:35,667
- Ghastly.
- No, just ghastly.

319
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:38,435
- Ghastly.
- Ghastly.

320
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:40,237
- Ghastly? No?
- No, no, like this.

321
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:41,505
- No?
- No.

322
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,974
Afraid not.

323
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,176
Oh, never mind.
We, we won't worry about it.

324
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:48,613
Ridiculous.

325
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,290
Mm, what I've been missing
all these years

326
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:51,554
not ever drinking uncle's port.

327
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,717
Mm-hmm.

328
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,586
I think you're making
a mistake, Willie.

329
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,654
I don't think I am.

330
00:20:58,122 --> 00:21:00,925
Oh, uh, sit down, old boy.
Sit down, please.

331
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,129
Tell me, what are you
doing in England?

332
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:08,332
- I came over to join up.
- But it's not your war.

333
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:11,869
Well, I'm half English,
and a scrap's a scrap.

334
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,838
I like that.

335
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:22,179
Do you know
this is scandalous of us?

336
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:24,548
- But I don't think he'd mind.
- Who?

337
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,150
Why, the owner, Jeremy Wayne.

338
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:35,693
- Isn't he a romantic figure?
- Yeah, grand.

339
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,795
I love that devil-take-you look.

340
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:44,035
Do you know
you don't look unlike..

341
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:47,905
- That's my father.
- Your father?

342
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:49,707
'Cause I'm Kenneth Wayne.

343
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:54,345
Well, this is romance.

344
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,883
You're telling me..

345
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:21,238
- Why, hello.
- Hello, Mr. Wayne.

346
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:24,776
- Isn't this nice?
- Eh, great, great.

347
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:26,720
Gosh, I-I just happened
to be taking a bicycle ride

348
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:27,744
around the country.

349
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,613
All alone?
How too bad.

350
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,817
'Oh, yeah, just all alone,
you know.'

351
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,952
Oh, you see, I always take
an extra bicycle with me

352
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,220
in case anything happens.

353
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:37,955
Why, of course,
how stupid of me.

354
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:40,324
Yeah, I might possibly
run into some man who, uh

355
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:41,659
wants to take a ride with me.

356
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:42,994
Or some lady?

357
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,696
You, uh, you know any ladies

358
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:46,430
who like to ride bicycles?

359
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,966
I couldn't possibly interest
you in a horse, could I?

360
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,068
Oh, I have lots of them
in my stable.

361
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:53,637
- Oh, is this where you live?
- Mm-hmm.

362
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,482
Oh, what a coincidence
that I should just happen

363
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:56,708
to be sitting on your wall.

364
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:59,210
A charming coincidence.

365
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:01,946
Gee, it's a shame
that you live there, you know?

366
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,281
I mean you, uh,
you seem so human.

367
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:07,584
I hope you're not going
to run away from me

368
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:09,120
because of where I live.

369
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:11,088
I thought you Americans
were democratic.

370
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:12,623
Well, it's sort
of a shock to, uh

371
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,434
find out that Cinderella
is really a princess.

372
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:17,394
But I turn back into a pumpkin
at midnight.

373
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,965
Well, I wasn't sure
that it was your house.

374
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,835
I mean when I saw you in it,
I, uh, still had hopes

375
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,602
that you might just
have been visiting.

376
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:27,604
In it?
When did you see me in it?

377
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:29,807
Oh, last night.

378
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:32,753
You watched me
from the outside last night?

379
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:34,478
Well, just till you went to bed.

380
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:36,413
I-I mean,
till you went upstairs.

381
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,951
Well, I'll be darned.
A window peeper.

382
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:42,920
Oh, no, I wasn't peeping.
No, I was just looking.

383
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:44,798
See, there's not much to do
around here nights and, uh

384
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:46,700
I sort of wanted to see
where you live, you know?

385
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:48,926
- Oh!
- Oh, well, anyway.

386
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:50,561
I might have known
it wouldn't work out.

387
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:52,163
So you wanted to see
where I live, mm?

388
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:54,465
- Yeah.
- What do you mean not work out?

389
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:57,068
Well, a princess wouldn't
wanna go bicycle riding.

390
00:23:57,134 --> 00:24:00,104
No?
But Cinderella might.

391
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:03,775
H-here, wait, let, wait,
let me help you.

392
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:05,509
I haven't ridden in years.

393
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,784
Here, oh!

394
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,185
Window peeper.

395
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,887
- Some more tea?
- Mm-mm.

396
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:51,823
It's mighty good tea.

397
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:54,091
- Not as good as I can make.
- No?

398
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:56,928
- I make very good coffee too.
- Mm. Can you sew on buttons?

399
00:24:56,994 --> 00:25:01,765
Mm-hmm. Darn socks and I-I'm
very nice with children.

400
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,168
You know, you-you'll make
somebody a good wife.

401
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:06,437
Thank you, sir.
That I will, sir.

402
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:10,574
- Uh..
- What?

403
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:12,419
Oh, I suppose I'll have to go
home and get dressed for dinner.

404
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:15,012
Oh, no, not yet.
Well, we-we've just come here.

405
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,148
We've been here for three hours.

406
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,716
- Oh, no.
- It has been fun, hasn't it?

407
00:25:19,783 --> 00:25:21,385
Oh, it's been swell.

408
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,790
I never knew that
bicycling could be so enjoyable.

409
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,460
Oh, yes, there's nothing
like a good bicycle.

410
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:30,971
You know, it's a little
like that old song

411
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:32,930
"A Bicycle Built For Two."

412
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:35,833
- I don't know it.
- Well, neither do I.

413
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,069
I mean,
it's-it's sort of a song.

414
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,637
I see, about-about
a bicycle built for two?

415
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:42,907
Yes. Yeah.

416
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:46,577
Gee, you're a great girl.

417
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:54,351
Well, uh,
have some more tea, hm?

418
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,290
What's doing that?

419
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:02,693
France.

420
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:08,565
- Guns.
- Mm-hmm.

421
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:09,633
Gee!

422
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:13,175
Alright, alright,
alright, don't get impatient.

423
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:15,039
I'll be over there in a month.

424
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:18,175
- A month?
- Mm.

425
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:19,676
Oh!

426
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:22,379
Is there anything else
I can get you?

427
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:25,116
Oh, no, thank you. Thank you,
Mrs. Crouch. It was lovely.

428
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:28,385
- A month.
- Well, just about. Mm-hmm.

429
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:29,897
Oh, Mrs. Crouch, uh,
I'm afraid we're going

430
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,001
to have to stay for dinner.

431
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:32,089
- Dinner, sir?
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:34,025
Oh, I don't serve dinner, sir.

433
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:36,894
Oh, well, it, uh, it, uh

434
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,263
looks too much like rain
to risk going out.

435
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,798
You see, Miss Sheridan here
had an aunt who-who caught cold

436
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:44,001
in a rainstorm once
and-and almost died.

437
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:46,603
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Mm-hmm.

438
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,972
But it isn't going to rain, sir.

439
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,607
Oh, but you can never can tell.

440
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:52,276
Please, Mrs. Crouch,
just something easy.

441
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:53,644
Or we can cook it ourselves.

442
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,922
Just some chops
and maybe a steak.

443
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,156
Have you, have you got any ale?

444
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,349
And how about
a little salad, huh?

445
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:12,263
I don't know.

446
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,400
'Cause I think love is..

447
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,105
Do you know what love is?

448
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:25,576
What?

449
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:28,079
Well, of course, there's..

450
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:31,115
There's different kinds of love.

451
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:35,719
I know but...
we were talking about..

452
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:36,853
real love.

453
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,555
Yeah.

454
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:40,157
Real love..

455
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:42,126
lasts forever.

456
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,029
- Yes, I know but...
- There are no buts.

457
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:47,498
'I know what I'm talking about.'

458
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,533
'Love is..'

459
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,205
'Love is something you feel.
It just happens.'

460
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,207
'You can't do anything
about it.'

461
00:27:56,273 --> 00:28:00,344
'If I love somebody...
I'd love him forever.'

462
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,084
To Major Owen, RAMC.

463
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:09,586
Well, I never saw the child
drink port before.

464
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,722
- In your honor, sir.
- Oh, thank you, my dear.

465
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:16,127
A soldier, a gentleman,
but a miserable chess player.

466
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:18,996
Absolutely untrue,
isn't it, Kathy?

467
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:23,134
- What vintage is this?
- Huh?

468
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,969
Uh, Coburn's '96,
if it really interests you.

469
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,240
'96, hmm, not bad for new wine.

470
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:32,309
- Pardon?
- Not bad, eh?

471
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:34,878
Oh, listen to the girl.
Coburn's '96, not bad.

472
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:38,182
I don't mean it's not good but
it doesn't compare with the '47.

473
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,352
Hmm, '47?
What do you know about the '47?

474
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:43,887
Well, I had a glass of it
the other day.

475
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:45,356
- Oh, you did, eh?
- Mm-hmm.

476
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:49,026
- Who gave it to you?
- A man I met with Willie.

477
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:51,728
- Aha! What man?
- Yes, come on, Kathleen.

478
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:53,930
I'd like to know a man
with a bit of '47.

479
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:56,033
Could we meet him?

480
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,702
- Oh, yes, I suppose so.
- Come on, out with it.

481
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:00,837
Well, Willie and I
went into an old house

482
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:02,506
to get out of the storm
the other day.

483
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,242
- Whose house?
- Um, just a big, empty house.

484
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:07,511
Oh! I smell a story in this.

485
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:10,814
Well, there's no sense
of making a mystery of it.

486
00:29:10,881 --> 00:29:15,119
- It was the old Wayne house.
- Wayne house.

487
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:18,998
You know that old, deserted
house back of the maid's

488
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:21,258
new road. Not a soul
been in it for 50 years.

489
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:24,328
And then quite unexpectedly,
in walks the owner from America.

490
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:28,365
What?

491
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,670
He's back. Jeremy Wayne.

492
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:36,273
Oh, no, Uncle John.
Not Jeremy Wayne.

493
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,309
Jeremy Wayne is dead.

494
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,577
This is his son.
He came to join up.

495
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:44,548
Dead?

496
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,386
- Uncle John!
- 'John! John!'

497
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:59,963
Owen, what is it?
What did this Jeremy Wayne do?

498
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,366
- I can't tell you.
- But in heaven's name, I...

499
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,636
That's his wish, Kathleen.
You must forget it.

500
00:30:05,702 --> 00:30:08,605
Forget it? How can I, Owen?
You must tell me.

501
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:10,207
- No, I can't.
- Then I must ask him.

502
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:14,077
Oh, no.
You must not, please.

503
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,522
You don't know
how it would hurt him.

504
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:18,048
- I know...
- Oh, don't insist, my dear.

505
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:21,318
It's better so.
Believe me.

506
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:35,499
Won't you come in, dear?

507
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,703
I'm sorry I said
anything that hurt you.

508
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,007
Kathleen, this young man,
this Wayne.

509
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:45,376
He's in the army, you say?

510
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:47,043
Yes, he's in Camp

511
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,346
It's just half an hour
from here.

512
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:50,933
Oh, but let's not talk
about him, dear.

513
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,584
I should prefer that
you don't ever see him again.

514
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:57,254
Uncle John?

515
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:59,923
Why mustn't I see him again?

516
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,658
He's really awfully nice.

517
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:04,628
I think you'd like him. We've
become rather good friends.

518
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:06,430
- Friends?
- Yes, and I'm sure...

519
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,665
Be silent!

520
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:10,367
You sicken me.

521
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:14,738
When did you meet this man?

522
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:20,411
- A week ago, almost.
- Have you seen him since?

523
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:23,380
- Yes.
- 'How often?'

524
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:26,583
- Why, quite often.
- Kathleen?

525
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,153
You must promise me
never to see him again.

526
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,489
I can't promise.
I want to see him.

527
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:35,926
- Why shouldn't I?
- Are you in love with him?

528
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:37,894
Are you? Answer me?

529
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,030
I don't know, I..

530
00:31:40,096 --> 00:31:41,898
If I am in love with him..

531
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:45,536
I don't know,
he's not in love with me anyway.

532
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:48,372
At least,
we've never said anything.

533
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,742
I only know I can't bear the
thought of not seeing him again.

534
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,911
I'm sorry, Uncle John,
I can't help it, I..

535
00:31:54,978 --> 00:31:56,680
I just can't.

536
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:05,489
Listen, my child.

537
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:09,260
I'm going to tell you something
you should have known long ago.

538
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,862
It's been my fault, I suppose.

539
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:14,498
But I hoped
I never would have to tell you.

540
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,568
I hoped I never would have
to live it all over again.

541
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:22,172
It's almost 50 years ago.

542
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:25,175
I can see it
as if it were yesterday.

543
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:28,211
This garden, a June night..

544
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,181
the same scent
of roses on the air.

545
00:32:31,248 --> 00:32:33,917
Excitement.
People coming and going.

546
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:36,420
Little lanterns among the trees.

547
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:40,957
And from the ballroom,
the sound of an orchestra.

548
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:44,027
It was the night
before our wedding.

549
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:46,430
I remember it so well.

550
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,765
The house was filled
with people.

551
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:50,434
- Sweetheart.
- Oh, ho ho.

552
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,036
- This is our dance, isn't it?
- Is it? I forgot.

553
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:54,771
Of course, it is. Come on.

554
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,775
Oh, where on earth
have you been?

555
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:34,044
Yes, what kind of a best friend
are you, eh?

556
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,179
Uh, John,
you don't deserve this.

557
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:37,614
I'm sorry, old man,
but you don't.

558
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:41,017
I know it, I know it,
but it's too late now.

559
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:46,523
- Crazy! Absolutely crazy!
- Well...

560
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,067
Hasn't said a sensible thing
all evening, Owen.

561
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:49,626
Can we blame him, hmm?

562
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:52,463
To tell you the truth, I'm not
making much sense myself.

563
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:53,930
I've never been so happy.

564
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:55,632
- You had a drink yet, Owen?
- Oh, yes.

565
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,109
I stopped for a quick one
at the Georgian Dragon.

566
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,503
- Oh, you did, eh?
- Well, no, no more, John.

567
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,605
- Go on.
- Oh, no, well..

568
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,274
Oh, by the way, uh,
Jeremy Wayne was there.

569
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,309
Oh, why didn't you bring him
along?

570
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,787
Well, he was
in pretty bad shape, John.

571
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:09,021
Drinking more
than was good for him.

572
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:10,814
Yeah, he takes it pretty hard,
doesn't he?

573
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,416
Poor devil.

574
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,318
Well, I can't say
I blame him either.

575
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,555
You know, Wayne's a wild
sort of fellow, John.

576
00:34:18,622 --> 00:34:19,632
I'm a bit worried about him.

577
00:34:19,656 --> 00:34:21,291
He was making vague sort

578
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:22,459
of threats against you.

579
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:24,528
Yeah, you know what that is?

580
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,197
That's-that's that
Georgian Dragon brandy.

581
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:28,865
Pretty dangerous stuff.

582
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:31,468
Do you remember the night when
you wanted to marry the barmaid?

583
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:33,036
After just two glasses of it.

584
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:37,216
Oh, we have had some
good times, haven't we?

585
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,575
Haven't we? Oh, my God.

586
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:40,152
And don't you think
they-they're gonna end

587
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:41,336
either, you blithering idiot.

588
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,380
Not, but, um, seriously, John...

589
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:45,716
Now, drink it.
Go on, drink it.

590
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:47,418
Alright.

591
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:48,752
I want to get back to Moonyeen.

592
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:50,687
I can't bear to let
that girl out of my sight

593
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:52,723
for more than a minute or two.

594
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:54,858
Ssh! Listen!

595
00:34:54,925 --> 00:35:01,632
* There's a little brown road
winding over the hill *

596
00:35:01,698 --> 00:35:02,966
Uh, j-just look at that now.

597
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:08,505
* To a little white cot
by the sea *

598
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:15,211
* There's a little green gate *

599
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:21,117
* At whose turnings I wait *

600
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:25,288
* While two eyes of blue *

601
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:29,426
* Come smiling through *

602
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:33,430
* At me *

603
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:38,902
* There's a gray lock or two *

604
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:43,173
* In the brown of her hair *

605
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:47,377
* There's some silver
in mine too *

606
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:50,981
* I see *

607
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:52,616
* But in all *

608
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:58,555
* The long years *

609
00:35:58,622 --> 00:36:05,428
* When the clouds
brought their tears *

610
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,800
* Those two eyes of blue *

611
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:14,370
* Kept smiling through *

612
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:18,575
* At me **

613
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,922
I promised him I'd tell you
he was here, Miss Moonyeen.

614
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:34,891
But I wouldn't see him, miss.
Not if I was you.

615
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,927
Quite right, Mary,
you go back into the house.

616
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:40,363
But I don't think
he's quite himself, miss.

617
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,667
- I'll tell Sir John.
- No, no, Mary. You mustn't.

618
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,683
Oh, Jerry, I knew
you couldn't let me get married

619
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,385
without coming to wish me joy.

620
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:04,287
What's the matter, Jerry?
What is it?

621
00:37:04,354 --> 00:37:07,457
- You know what it is.
- Come in, we're expecting you.

622
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:09,626
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Please, Jerry.

623
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:13,096
Don't act like this
on the night before my wedding.

624
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:15,098
You don't need to remind me
what night it is.

625
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:17,200
Jerry, dear,
we're not going to go

626
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:18,935
all over that again, are we?

627
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:20,971
As though
I weren't tortured enough.

628
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:22,773
As though
you weren't driving me mad.

629
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:24,841
That's not quite fair, is it?

630
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:28,679
You look so beautiful
in that dress.

631
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:29,980
Thanks, Jerry.

632
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:31,582
I had an awful time
getting it to fit.

633
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:33,425
I was so afraid it was going
to be an utter failure.

634
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:36,352
Oh, Moonyeen, Moonyeen.

635
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:39,455
Oh, Jerry.
Please, don't.

636
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:41,725
Haven't you any pity
for a man in hell?

637
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,127
Oh, Jerry, dear,
you mustn't. Get up.

638
00:37:44,194 --> 00:37:47,330
You're not going to marry him.
All my life, I've loved you.

639
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:49,241
Jerry, it isn't easy for me
either to have you say

640
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,501
things like this.
I'm so fond of you.

641
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,279
It was understood between our
families that we were to marry.

642
00:37:53,303 --> 00:37:54,605
It was understood by everyone.

643
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:56,115
Yes, but, Jerry,
this needn't mean the end

644
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:59,275
of our friendship.
Nothing should end that.

645
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:02,779
After all, girlhood and boyhood
sweethearts don't always marry.

646
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:05,548
Hmm, girlhood and boyhood
sweethearts.

647
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:10,120
You were such
a cunning, little boy.

648
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:12,088
And you were such
a beautiful, little girl.

649
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:14,224
Now, we mustn't ever
let anything spoil that.

650
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,434
Don't you see what I mean, dear?

651
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,698
Tomorrow you'll be in his arms.

652
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,928
This man you're marrying

653
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:19,238
what right has he
to take you from me?

654
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:20,096
Why is he better than I?

655
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,373
What is there in me
that's wrong?

656
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:22,699
Nothing, Jerry, nothing.

657
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,043
Is it because I drink?
I drink because I'm unhappy.

658
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:25,307
And I'm unhappy because of you.

659
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:27,113
This other man, he has
no faults, he's perfect.

660
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:28,615
But I tell you,
he shall not have you.

661
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,016
The man doesn't live
who can take you from me.

662
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,651
The man will not live
who takes you from me...

663
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,143
Jerry!

664
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,548
I'm marrying John tomorrow.

665
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:40,183
I'm marrying him
because I love him.

666
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,052
I loved him
from the moment I saw him.

667
00:38:42,118 --> 00:38:45,021
I shall always love him,
because he stands for everything

668
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:47,624
that's beautiful,
and fine, and true.

669
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:49,860
And even if he didn't,
I should still love him.

670
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:54,731
Mmm!

671
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,208
Moonyeen.

672
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:20,590
Ah, good evening, madam.

673
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:22,225
If you're not busy
tomorrow afternoon

674
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,860
how do you like to marry me?

675
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:25,647
What's the matter, dear?
Is something wrong?

676
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,136
- No, nothing.
- Something I've done?

677
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,733
Something I've said? 'Cause
if it is, I-I didn't mean it.

678
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,969
No, John, dear.
Hold me close.

679
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:35,706
- Anything about the wedding?
- No.

680
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:37,040
You're not unhappy, are you?

681
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:40,043
How could I possibly
be unhappy tonight?

682
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,945
- You're a funny little thing.
- Am I?

683
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,579
- 'Moonyeen!'
- 'John!'

684
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:45,381
'Where are they?'

685
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:47,250
Shh! Don't let's answer them.

686
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:54,390
Well..

687
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,273
You know sometimes,
I-I get a little scared.

688
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,709
How on earth did we two
ever happen to get together?

689
00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:15,912
I know, to think
that out of all the millions

690
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:17,881
of people in the world.

691
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,094
Can you imagine what fun
it's going to be in this house?

692
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:24,254
- Oh, darling.
- Just you and I.

693
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,222
Everything's fun.

694
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:27,758
I'm so excited
about going to Paris.

695
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:29,225
- Are you, dear?
- Mm-hmm.

696
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:31,627
You know I know a marvelous
restaurant in the Rue Vavin.

697
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:34,430
- You do?
- Yes, you wait.

698
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,449
Oh, God, what's the use
of going to Paris?

699
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:56,319
Hmm, what's the use
of doing anything?

700
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:58,955
Except sitting here
the rest of our lives.

701
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:01,224
Except the food's
awfully good in Paris.

702
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,926
It's gonna be
a beautiful honeymoon..

703
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:06,029
spent in a restaurant.

704
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:10,500
Mm, darling.

705
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:13,003
- Like my ring?
- It's a beauty, isn't it?

706
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:14,589
Belonged to
my great-great-grandmother.

707
00:41:14,637 --> 00:41:15,872
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

708
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:18,741
I say, let's practice, shall we?

709
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,945
With this ring, I thee wed.

710
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,547
This was pretty good,
wasn't it, huh?

711
00:41:24,614 --> 00:41:29,319
Alright, maybe I better practice
dropping it once or twice, huh?

712
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:32,155
Look, there-there's really
nothing to this getting married.

713
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:35,558
You see how easy it is?
I-I can do it with my eyes shut.

714
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,895
With this ring...
I thee wed.

715
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:47,237
- You know, this is fun.
- What on earth are you doing?

716
00:41:47,303 --> 00:41:50,306
It's fun opening
my eyes and seeing you.

717
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,876
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if every time I open my eyes

718
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,678
for the rest of my life,
you-you were there?

719
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:57,380
I will be.

720
00:41:57,447 --> 00:42:00,016
And always as beautiful
as you are tonight.

721
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:06,689
Well, after I get the ring on,
what happens next?

722
00:42:06,756 --> 00:42:08,859
- Mm?
- You kiss me.

723
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:11,928
Oh! That-that's going
to be very difficult.

724
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:29,112
- Hello, dearest.
- Hello, my sweet.

725
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,483
Tonight is the last time
we ever have to say goodbye.

726
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:35,485
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

727
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:37,687
Never any more partings.

728
00:42:37,753 --> 00:42:39,990
- No more separate plans?
- No.

729
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:42,625
No different thoughts.

730
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:46,062
Just we two...
made one.

731
00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:50,266
- Forever.
- And forever.

732
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,935
Amen.

733
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,006
- 'Moonyeen.'
- 'John.'

734
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:58,942
'Moonyeen!
Where the heck is she?'

735
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:07,637
Will thou have this man
to thy wedded husband

736
00:45:07,703 --> 00:45:10,340
to live together
after God's ordinance

737
00:45:10,406 --> 00:45:13,276
in the holy estate of matrimony?

738
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,180
Will thou obey him and serve him

739
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:21,384
love, honor and keep him
in sickness and in health

740
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:26,156
and forsaking all other,
keep thee only unto him

741
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:30,093
'so long as
you both shall live?'

742
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,428
I will.

743
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:39,702
- Wayne!
- Jerry!

744
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:42,938
- 'At my wedding.'
- There will be no wedding.

745
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:45,275
Be silent, sir.

746
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:47,477
Are you mad, Wayne?

747
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:49,011
Get out of here!

748
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,548
You took her away from me.

749
00:45:52,615 --> 00:45:54,584
But, by heaven,
you'll never have her.

750
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:55,951
No, Jerry, no!

751
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:02,325
After him!

752
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:08,431
He went this way.
Come on. Go on.

753
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:10,042
Catch him fast.
He's probably around the lake.

754
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:11,134
Come on.

755
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,702
Moonyeen.

756
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,160
But surely you can do something?

757
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:38,828
You must do something.

758
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,434
- John?
- Yes, dear.

759
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:48,838
It hurts. Make it stop.

760
00:46:54,076 --> 00:46:56,011
Are you alright?

761
00:46:56,078 --> 00:46:57,780
Yes, dear, of course.

762
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:02,185
Am I?
Is it..

763
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:06,656
It's nothing, darling.
Owen will help you.

764
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:11,961
John..

765
00:47:12,027 --> 00:47:14,063
Darling..

766
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,865
Wear..

767
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:18,801
the ring.

768
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,355
Dear?

769
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,125
Dear, don't be sad.

770
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:47,129
Our love could never die.

771
00:47:55,438 --> 00:48:00,042
- John, where are you?
- I'm here, my love.

772
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:04,079
Darling...
don't leave me.

773
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:06,148
Don't leave me.

774
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:13,856
John..

775
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:17,693
isn't it a pity?

776
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:04,840
For me too, it was the end.

777
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:08,110
She lay white and still
in my arms.

778
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:09,845
She was dead.

779
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:14,149
All that I lived for was gone.

780
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:16,619
It was the end.

781
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:19,622
I came back alone to this house.

782
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:22,224
All gay with flowers for her.

783
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:30,165
I sat alone where I sit now
the whole night through.

784
00:49:30,232 --> 00:49:32,535
Poor darling.

785
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:35,638
I've sat here many times since.

786
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:38,674
Whenever I'm in trouble
or sorrow, I come here.

787
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:41,311
For it's here
that she returns to me.

788
00:49:41,377 --> 00:49:44,213
Year after year, she has come.

789
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,848
Always when I needed her

790
00:49:45,915 --> 00:49:48,484
she was beside me,
she was here in this garden.

791
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:50,586
I know, dear, I understand.

792
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:55,858
Kathleen, tonight you told me
that Jeremy Wayne was dead.

793
00:49:55,925 --> 00:49:58,794
- I'm sorry I didn't kill him.
- Uncle John.

794
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:00,896
After the police
had given up the search

795
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:04,033
I tracked him for years through
half the ports of South America.

796
00:50:05,601 --> 00:50:07,503
For years, I hunted him
in my dreams.

797
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,772
I killed him in my dreams.

798
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,774
Now, he is dead.

799
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:13,676
And his son..

800
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:14,844
His son!

801
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,512
But Kenneth
never knew his father.

802
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:17,623
He was a baby when he died.

803
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,249
But, Kathleen, listen..

804
00:50:20,316 --> 00:50:22,151
you must promise me
to have nothing more

805
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:23,786
to do with the son of that man.

806
00:50:25,054 --> 00:50:26,756
You mean, it's..

807
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:30,460
- It's never.
- Never.

808
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:33,295
Kathleen?

809
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:36,932
Yeah, I promise.

810
00:50:48,844 --> 00:50:50,513
- Uh, good evening.
- Good evening.

811
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,550
- Is, uh, Miss Sheridan home?
- No, sir, she's out.

812
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:56,018
You told her I called Wednesday?

813
00:50:56,085 --> 00:50:58,788
- Oh, yes, sir.
- And, uh, and Friday?

814
00:50:58,854 --> 00:51:00,790
She was sorry to miss you, sir.

815
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:02,425
Oh, is she?

816
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,827
Well, uh, I guess I'll wait.

817
00:51:10,966 --> 00:51:13,335
- But really, sir...
- I'll-I'll wait.

818
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:35,958
He won't go.

819
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,534
What's the matter
with you, Ellen?

820
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,669
I didn't want
to interrupt you, sir.

821
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:49,605
- It's for Miss Kathleen, sir.
- Oh, uh..

822
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:53,643
It's the man from the canteen,
miss. He's here again.

823
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:54,944
Man from the canteen?

824
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,455
What's he doing here
at this hour of the night?

825
00:51:56,479 --> 00:51:58,080
I better go and see
what he wants, dear.

826
00:51:58,147 --> 00:51:59,682
I won't be a minute.

827
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,021
Very peculiar.

828
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:18,534
- Hello, Ken.
- Why wouldn't you see me?

829
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:21,537
- I can't tell you here.
- 'Ellen! Ellen!'

830
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:23,272
- Who's that?
- That's my uncle.

831
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:24,907
He mustn't know you've come.

832
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:26,676
Why not? What's wrong?
What's it all about?

833
00:52:26,742 --> 00:52:28,778
We can't talk here, Ken.

834
00:52:28,844 --> 00:52:30,379
I guess I shouldn't have come.

835
00:52:30,446 --> 00:52:33,215
Oh, please, don't think that.

836
00:52:33,282 --> 00:52:34,950
We'll get away from the house.

837
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:44,627
Yeah, I suppose he's right.

838
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:49,064
Certainly is great to find out

839
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:52,468
that your father
did a thing like that.

840
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:55,605
I'm sorry, but...
I had to tell you.

841
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:57,707
Oh, sure, it's, uh..

842
00:53:03,078 --> 00:53:04,614
Well..

843
00:53:06,115 --> 00:53:07,617
Well..

844
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,164
There's...there's really nothing
else we can do, is it?

845
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:24,600
No, I guess the whole thing
was cockeyed anyway

846
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,068
with me going to the front
so soon.

847
00:53:26,135 --> 00:53:29,672
Besides, we...we hardly know
each other, do we?

848
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:32,742
No, this, uh..

849
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:35,678
poor-boy-rich-girl thing's
usually a bust anyway.

850
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:38,313
Yes, I guess we were just
as lucky to stop it now.

851
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,615
- Weren't we?
- Yeah.

852
00:53:39,682 --> 00:53:41,483
It's a pretty close shave
though, we..

853
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,253
We might really have a, got a..

854
00:53:45,788 --> 00:53:47,056
Yes.

855
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:53,629
Well, it was nice
to have known you, miss.

856
00:53:53,696 --> 00:53:56,999
- If you're ever in Cleveland..
- Cleveland..

857
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:59,569
That sounds so awfully far away.

858
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:15,985
Uh, I promised.

859
00:54:17,186 --> 00:54:19,955
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

860
00:54:22,825 --> 00:54:25,661
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

861
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:38,240
- We don't seem to be..
- Oh, we don't, do we?

862
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:41,877
- If we are in love?
- Oh, we can't be that, can we?

863
00:54:45,547 --> 00:54:47,917
We mustn't see each other
though.

864
00:54:47,983 --> 00:54:50,620
- Or must we?
- That wouldn't be right.

865
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:52,163
Except that as long as
I'm going to France...

866
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:54,089
But wouldn't it be easier
if we didn't...

867
00:54:54,156 --> 00:54:55,991
- I don't know if it would...
- We can't just..

868
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:58,594
- We aren't children, are we?
- Oh, that's right, we..

869
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:00,863
We've got to use our heads,
but..

870
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,119
- 'Well..'
- Hm? What?

871
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:26,155
This is a douche of a game
with you going to sleep

872
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:27,489
after every move.

873
00:55:27,556 --> 00:55:29,324
I wasn't asleep.

874
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:31,560
Even if I were,
I could beat you.

875
00:55:33,562 --> 00:55:36,832
By the way, where does Kathleen
keep herself these days?

876
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:39,101
Oh, heaven knows. Why?

877
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:42,104
Well, haven't seen
much of her lately.

878
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:44,073
Nobody has.

879
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:45,708
Canteen keeps her pretty busy.

880
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,710
- I see.
- 'Hmm.'

881
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,578
The canteen.

882
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:59,955
Worse than ever today.

883
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:03,025
Those guns must be
over 100 miles away.

884
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:06,729
And still they go out
in thousands to fill the gaps.

885
00:56:19,742 --> 00:56:22,244
I thought
I'd never get away today.

886
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:23,846
- Same here.
- Am I very late?

887
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,081
- Only a minute.
- A minute's a year.

888
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,820
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, you.

889
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:36,792
Sweet..

890
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,997
Glad to see me?

891
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:45,034
- Now, what do you think?
- I don't know.

892
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,173
Oh! Good heavens.
Look at that spread.

893
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,844
Those big sticky buns.
I've already had one tea.

894
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,846
Oh, well, pretend to eat,
darling

895
00:56:56,912 --> 00:56:58,680
or you'll break her heart.

896
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,015
Oh, good afternoon,
Mrs. Crouch.

897
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:04,686
Good day, miss, I'm bringing
the tea, fresh made.

898
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,221
Ah, sinkers.

899
00:57:06,288 --> 00:57:08,791
They're not sinkers, sir.
They're donuts.

900
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,692
- Oh, yeah.
- There.

901
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,728
Now, I've just got
to get the scones.

902
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:15,664
- Scones?
- They're in the oven.

903
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:19,802
Well, now let me see.

904
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,670
What may I help you to?

905
00:57:21,737 --> 00:57:24,573
A radish? A sinker?

906
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:27,977
Uh, neither, if you please.

907
00:57:28,043 --> 00:57:30,645
- Yeah, uh, neither.
- If you please.

908
00:57:30,712 --> 00:57:32,281
Yeah, if you please.

909
00:57:33,715 --> 00:57:35,084
Well, how about a cookie?

910
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,719
You pick me out
a nice, slender one, please.

911
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,488
- How about that one?
- Ah, thank you.

912
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:44,827
- Darling.
- Darling.

913
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:49,564
Hey, Kathleen..

914
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:04,079
- Kathleen..
- What is it, Ken?

915
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:06,315
We're, uh..

916
00:58:06,381 --> 00:58:08,150
We're pushing off.

917
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,988
When, dear?

918
00:58:13,055 --> 00:58:14,924
- Tonight.
- 'Here we are.'

919
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:18,027
And piping hot,
and they're good.

920
00:58:18,093 --> 00:58:19,428
Though I said it, I shouldn't.

921
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:22,932
I'm sure they are.
Thank you, Mrs. Crouch.

922
00:58:22,998 --> 00:58:24,766
My mother taught me to bake.

923
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,002
My word, she was a one to bake.

924
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:28,703
And her dumplings, oh!

925
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:33,108
You just put your fork
into them and they went, pfft!

926
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:34,877
Eh?

927
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:38,380
Well, I dare say
you'll be wanting to be alone.

928
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:42,317
If there's anything at all you
want, just call me, will you?

929
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:43,953
Yes, thank you.

930
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:47,289
Ken, how can they?
You're not half-trained.

931
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:49,324
I know, I guess
they need more men.

932
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:50,860
Yes, but..

933
00:58:52,394 --> 00:58:53,328
so soon.

934
00:58:53,395 --> 00:58:55,530
Well, I'll get leave,
you know, darling.

935
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:57,432
Of course.

936
00:59:00,402 --> 00:59:03,338
- Well, uh..
- Let's be nonchalant, shall we?

937
00:59:03,405 --> 00:59:05,607
Naturally.

938
00:59:05,674 --> 00:59:08,177
- Allow me.
- Many thanks.

939
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:14,516
No use.

940
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,552
I feel like one
of Mrs. Thingummy's dumplings.

941
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:20,122
I've-I've gone pfft!

942
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:23,292
Kath, sweet.
Oh, dear, no.

943
00:59:25,127 --> 00:59:27,462
Oh, no, darling, don't. Please.

944
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:31,566
I'll be back, you know.

945
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:45,280
Ken, just how long have you?

946
00:59:45,347 --> 00:59:47,049
We've got to make Dover tonight.

947
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,383
We have a day's leave there

948
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,261
and then, we're off to France
the next morning.

949
00:59:50,285 --> 00:59:52,922
Couldn't you get leave now until
the time to leave from Dover?

950
00:59:52,988 --> 00:59:54,823
Well, only if..

951
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,559
only for something
extra special.

952
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:04,900
Take me to Dover with you...
tonight.

953
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:08,237
Have you thought, darling?
It's only a few hours.

954
01:00:08,303 --> 01:00:12,975
Then I'll leave you...
and I may not come back.

955
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,044
But we shall have had
those hours, dear.

956
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,212
It will help me to wait.

957
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,548
And if it's all we ever have..

958
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:22,451
it will help me to live.

959
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:28,123
I shall have been...your wife.

960
01:00:30,825 --> 01:00:32,294
My wife.

961
01:00:35,664 --> 01:00:37,299
Darling.

962
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:41,303
I love you.

963
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:45,007
Darling.

964
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:46,608
Uh, Ken, go back to camp.

965
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:48,343
Get leave to join the draft
at the boat.

966
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,745
Tell them
you're gonna be married.

967
01:00:50,812 --> 01:00:52,590
I'll throw some things in a bag,
then you come call me.

968
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:54,916
Yeah, sure. I'll be with you
half an hour.

969
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,585
Sweet.

970
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:02,124
Oh, what-what about your uncle?
What will you tell him?

971
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,525
I'll tell him the truth.

972
01:01:03,592 --> 01:01:06,061
- I must now.
- He'll never consent.

973
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:09,031
Whatever happens, darling,
I'll be waiting.

974
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,602
Pray for me.

975
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,948
Mrs. Crouch.

976
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:38,193
- Uncle John?
- Uh-huh, what, darling?

977
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,362
There's something
I must tell you.

978
01:01:41,896 --> 01:01:43,698
What is it, my dear?

979
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:49,104
I've broken my promise to you.

980
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:50,905
What-what promise?

981
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:53,108
I've been seeing Kenneth Wayne.

982
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:56,345
We love each other.
We're to be married.

983
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,949
- Married.
- I meant to keep my word.

984
01:02:01,016 --> 01:02:02,717
I tried. I really tried.

985
01:02:02,784 --> 01:02:05,287
He called several times,
and I refused to see him.

986
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:06,988
Then when I did see him at last,
it was..

987
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:10,125
it was only to explain.

988
01:02:10,192 --> 01:02:12,361
I should never have promised,
Uncle John.

989
01:02:12,427 --> 01:02:14,796
I loved him from the first.

990
01:02:14,863 --> 01:02:16,665
He's splendid and fine.

991
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:19,234
Won't you try to forget
what his father did?

992
01:02:19,301 --> 01:02:21,503
Won't you meet him,
just for my sake?

993
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,539
He's going to the front.
We've only tomorrow..

994
01:02:25,974 --> 01:02:28,009
We're to be married
before he leaves.

995
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,482
I'd sooner see you dead.

996
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,193
Excuse me, Sir John.

997
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:48,330
- Miss Kathleen?
- Ask him to wait, Ellen.

998
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,332
No, bring him in here.

999
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,668
- Uncle John, please...
- Bring him in here.

1000
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:55,470
'This way, sir.'

1001
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:59,808
Good evening, sir.

1002
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:01,876
I'm Kenneth Wayne.

1003
01:03:01,943 --> 01:03:04,113
My uncle wanted to see you.

1004
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:06,381
It's, uh, it's alright?

1005
01:03:08,983 --> 01:03:10,785
I'm ready to go with you.

1006
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:16,057
I hope you understand, sir.

1007
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,729
I understand only one thing
about a Wayne.

1008
01:03:20,795 --> 01:03:22,331
What's that?

1009
01:03:22,397 --> 01:03:25,867
The quality of your breed
is not to take its medicine.

1010
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:28,203
That's why your father took
the life of one person

1011
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,139
and ruined that of another.

1012
01:03:30,205 --> 01:03:31,540
He couldn't take his medicine.

1013
01:03:31,606 --> 01:03:33,251
I don't think you have any right
to put it like that.

1014
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:35,310
Kenneth, I'm going with you
just as I promised.

1015
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:38,147
If she marries you,
if she becomes your wife

1016
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:41,183
just as you're leaving,
and you never come back

1017
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,527
you'll have smashed
into her life

1018
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:45,554
for a few futile, cowardly hours

1019
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,365
because I shall never forgive
any part of it.

1020
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:49,458
I'm coming back,
and I'm going to make her happy.

1021
01:03:49,524 --> 01:03:51,560
It's the only thing in the world
I want to do.

1022
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:53,695
You ought to forget and forgive,
and try to help us.

1023
01:03:53,762 --> 01:03:56,798
When I forget, it will be
because I'll be dead.

1024
01:03:56,865 --> 01:04:00,034
'If he takes you from me,
then he can take care of you.'

1025
01:04:00,101 --> 01:04:02,804
That's my last word, Kathleen.

1026
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:04,639
I shall not change it.

1027
01:04:07,942 --> 01:04:10,145
Come on, let's get out of here.

1028
01:04:13,114 --> 01:04:16,117
We can get the next train and
be in town in time for dinner.

1029
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,719
We mustn't wait a second, dear.

1030
01:04:17,786 --> 01:04:20,489
- We have so little time.
- Kathleen, we can't do it.

1031
01:04:20,555 --> 01:04:22,600
I'd be an utter cad. I've
nothing but my shilling a day.

1032
01:04:22,624 --> 01:04:24,226
Oh, we can talk about that
in Dover.

1033
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,936
You're not coming to Dover.
He meant what he said.

1034
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,005
He wouldn't take you back, and
day after tomorrow, you're...

1035
01:04:28,029 --> 01:04:29,864
I don't care what happens
day after tomorrow

1036
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:31,900
anymore than I care
what happened 50 years ago.

1037
01:04:31,966 --> 01:04:36,004
- Oh, darling, I love you so.
- Is that all?

1038
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,939
All?

1039
01:04:38,006 --> 01:04:40,675
- Don't you want me too?
- Oh!

1040
01:04:40,742 --> 01:04:44,679
I want you.
I'm not ashamed to say it.

1041
01:04:44,746 --> 01:04:49,150
I'm yours, you're mine. I want
that to be true before you go.

1042
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,853
D-darling, I-I can't.
I'd have no piece of mind.

1043
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,055
Oh, Ken, don't send me away.

1044
01:04:54,122 --> 01:04:55,590
We may never be together again.

1045
01:04:55,657 --> 01:04:58,327
We will regret all our life
that we wasted these last hours.

1046
01:04:58,393 --> 01:05:00,229
I can't, Kathleen.
It wouldn't be fair.

1047
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:01,472
- Oh, Ken, if you love me...
- Kathleen.

1048
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:03,798
- Would you listen to me?
- No!

1049
01:05:03,865 --> 01:05:05,066
I won't listen.

1050
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:07,135
I won't. I won't.

1051
01:05:07,202 --> 01:05:09,103
But, dear, please be reasonable.

1052
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:12,207
Gee, this is our last half hour
and we've wasted in an argument.

1053
01:05:12,274 --> 01:05:14,075
I can't take you from comfort
and security

1054
01:05:14,142 --> 01:05:16,177
and leave you with nothing.
I can't do it.

1055
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,881
Oh, well, I can't force you
to take me.

1056
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:21,816
You haven't convinced me at all.

1057
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:24,819
But of course, if you,
you don't want me?

1058
01:05:24,886 --> 01:05:26,388
Oh!

1059
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,659
Oh, darling.

1060
01:05:30,725 --> 01:05:32,193
Darling, uh..

1061
01:05:42,937 --> 01:05:44,806
- Ken.
- Hmm.

1062
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:48,777
You're right.
I've known it all the time.

1063
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:53,582
- I've been an awful prune.
- Oh, no, darling.

1064
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:55,317
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have.

1065
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,486
You're far from a prune.

1066
01:05:59,187 --> 01:06:00,555
By the time
I get through with you

1067
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:03,858
you won't be fit
to fight anyone.

1068
01:06:03,925 --> 01:06:06,194
You're telling me?

1069
01:06:06,261 --> 01:06:09,398
That is sweet.

1070
01:06:09,464 --> 01:06:11,300
Come on, darling,
I've got to get going.

1071
01:06:11,366 --> 01:06:13,167
The train leaves at ten after.

1072
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:16,938
Uh, no, dear, at twenty after.

1073
01:06:17,005 --> 01:06:18,507
After.

1074
01:06:20,174 --> 01:06:21,810
After.

1075
01:06:23,912 --> 01:06:29,017
Will you, uh, will you
see me to the station, hmm?

1076
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:31,786
I don't think I could, dear.

1077
01:06:31,853 --> 01:06:34,823
All those people, I..
I know I'd disgrace you.

1078
01:06:34,889 --> 01:06:36,157
Oh!

1079
01:06:36,224 --> 01:06:37,826
Better say goodbye..

1080
01:06:39,394 --> 01:06:40,895
now.

1081
01:06:48,603 --> 01:06:51,606
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1082
01:06:58,313 --> 01:06:59,753
Oh, Ken, I can't let you go.
I can't.

1083
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:01,559
Oh, darling, you're not gonna
start this all over again?

1084
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,927
No, dear, I love you,
I can't help it...

1085
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:04,753
But, darling, it's the war.
And I'm in it.

1086
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:06,219
Then why can't you take me
with you?

1087
01:07:06,254 --> 01:07:07,814
If I don't go,
I'll get court-martialed.

1088
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:10,096
- Oh, I don't care if you're...
- Oh, for the love of my..

1089
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:51,866
I'm afraid
she isn't coming back, John.

1090
01:07:51,933 --> 01:07:55,069
She couldn't do that to me.
I don't believe..

1091
01:07:57,005 --> 01:07:58,807
'Kathleen.'

1092
01:07:58,873 --> 01:08:00,375
Kathleen.

1093
01:08:05,747 --> 01:08:06,948
Well..

1094
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:09,083
Because of your threat..

1095
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:11,853
he wouldn't marry me.

1096
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,188
He's gone now.

1097
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:15,590
He may never come back.

1098
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:17,158
If God's just, he never will.

1099
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:24,666
John! John, what devil
has got into you?

1100
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:28,970
Go after her. Beg her
to forgive you if she ever can?

1101
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:31,573
- I haven't asked your advice.
- I'm giving it.

1102
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,409
That boy you wished dead
is a fine chap.

1103
01:08:34,476 --> 01:08:36,778
I met him several times
at the depot.

1104
01:08:36,845 --> 01:08:38,813
One of the best.

1105
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,283
So, after all
we've been through together..

1106
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,585
you're on his side too.

1107
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:46,254
I'm on Kathleen's side
and I say you're wrong.

1108
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,522
You're doing a wicked thing.

1109
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:49,323
And one day,
you'll bitterly regret it.

1110
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:50,992
Just a moment, Owen.

1111
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:53,438
You say I'm doing a wicked thing
because I can't take the son

1112
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:57,131
of her murderer to my heart?
Well, I can't.

1113
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,435
I may be all you say
but at least I'm loyal to her

1114
01:09:00,502 --> 01:09:02,537
which is the best I know

1115
01:09:02,604 --> 01:09:04,338
and I shall continue
to be so till the end.

1116
01:09:04,405 --> 01:09:06,140
And who pays the price
of your loyalty?

1117
01:09:06,207 --> 01:09:07,818
You must think of the living
as well as the dead...

1118
01:09:07,842 --> 01:09:09,010
You've said enough, Owen.

1119
01:09:09,077 --> 01:09:10,157
You're willing to sacrifice

1120
01:09:10,211 --> 01:09:11,480
every decent human sentiment

1121
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:13,682
to a bitter memory
that should be forgotten.

1122
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,352
Owen, if you can say that..

1123
01:09:18,419 --> 01:09:20,655
If that's how you feel..

1124
01:09:20,722 --> 01:09:23,057
I don't think you and I
can go on as we have done.

1125
01:09:23,124 --> 01:09:25,426
Do...you mean that, John?

1126
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,562
I never meant anything so much.

1127
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,505
It's...it's been a great
many years, John.

1128
01:09:36,571 --> 01:09:38,507
I've said my last word.

1129
01:10:10,572 --> 01:10:11,906
Moonyeen.

1130
01:10:13,174 --> 01:10:14,709
Moonyeen?

1131
01:10:16,044 --> 01:10:17,546
Where are you?

1132
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:23,084
'John, I can't get
through to you.'

1133
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:25,720
'Your hate is standing
between us.'

1134
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:30,525
I need you, Moonyeen.

1135
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:31,993
You must come.

1136
01:10:33,361 --> 01:10:36,030
If I could only reach you, dear.

1137
01:10:36,097 --> 01:10:37,766
If I could only make
you understand

1138
01:10:37,832 --> 01:10:39,634
that they love each other..

1139
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:41,703
as we did long ago.

1140
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:45,974
He may never come back
to her, John.

1141
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,910
If you build a barrier
between those who love..

1142
01:10:48,977 --> 01:10:51,412
you'll stand between
your soul and mine..

1143
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:54,482
for all eternity.

1144
01:10:54,549 --> 01:10:56,217
Beloved?

1145
01:10:56,284 --> 01:10:59,588
Beloved, can't you hear me?

1146
01:10:59,654 --> 01:11:02,691
Unless you drive this hatred
out of your heart

1147
01:11:02,757 --> 01:11:05,426
unless you right this wrong..

1148
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:08,529
why, you can never
come to me.

1149
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,064
Never!

1150
01:11:11,065 --> 01:11:13,802
Never...never.

1151
01:11:17,872 --> 01:11:19,941
Why have you deserted me?

1152
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,836
Will it never stop?

1153
01:11:47,902 --> 01:11:50,071
- I can't bear it!
- Kathleen!

1154
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:02,917
I'm sorry.

1155
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:18,292
Ken! Oh, Ken!

1156
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:23,664
Oh, Willie!

1157
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,967
- Hello, Kath.
- Hello.

1158
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,770
I thought, perhaps, you might
be looking for me.

1159
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,304
My mistake, Kathleen.

1160
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,208
I'm so glad to see you, Willie!

1161
01:13:34,275 --> 01:13:35,643
Don't you look well?

1162
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:38,612
Oh, please forgive me for not
answering your last letter!

1163
01:13:38,679 --> 01:13:40,548
Or the one before that?

1164
01:13:40,614 --> 01:13:41,883
You're a fine one.
You are.

1165
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,451
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1166
01:13:43,517 --> 01:13:46,220
Oh, that's alright, Kath.
I really didn't expect you to.

1167
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:50,792
Well, I suppose I'd better
be barging along.

1168
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:53,394
All the luck in the world, Kath.

1169
01:13:53,461 --> 01:13:54,929
Thank you, Willie.

1170
01:13:54,996 --> 01:13:56,731
I'll see you again sometime.

1171
01:13:56,798 --> 01:13:58,432
See ya.

1172
01:13:59,901 --> 01:14:02,403
'Fall in, men!
Stay-stay calm!'

1173
01:14:55,523 --> 01:14:57,859
- I've six cases tonight, sir.
- Very good.

1174
01:15:00,895 --> 01:15:02,396
'Alright.'

1175
01:15:04,598 --> 01:15:06,100
That's it.

1176
01:15:07,601 --> 01:15:09,503
Oh, there...careful.

1177
01:15:10,404 --> 01:15:11,906
That's it.

1178
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:15,910
- 'Orderly!'
- Sir?

1179
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,950
Careful, now.
Careful.

1180
01:15:22,016 --> 01:15:23,651
Take your time.

1181
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:25,186
Alrighty.

1182
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:28,089
So sorry, boys.

1183
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:37,265
Here we are, sir.
Take it easy.

1184
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:38,799
I'll fetch you a cab
or something.

1185
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,234
Oh!

1186
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:46,107
'That's all of it, I think.'

1187
01:15:49,844 --> 01:15:51,279
'Wayne!'

1188
01:15:52,746 --> 01:15:53,781
Kenneth Wayne!

1189
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:55,316
Who is it?

1190
01:15:56,684 --> 01:15:57,751
Oh!

1191
01:15:57,818 --> 01:16:00,288
Oh, hello-hello, doctor.

1192
01:16:00,354 --> 01:16:01,755
Well, it is..

1193
01:16:01,822 --> 01:16:03,324
It's good to see you again.

1194
01:16:03,391 --> 01:16:05,526
Nice to have you back. Splendid!

1195
01:16:05,593 --> 01:16:08,229
Listen doctor, will you
do me a favor?

1196
01:16:08,296 --> 01:16:09,974
Will you, for heaven's sake,
look at my legs

1197
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:11,799
and stop being
so nice about them?

1198
01:16:11,866 --> 01:16:14,268
Of course! You're, uh..

1199
01:16:14,335 --> 01:16:15,904
You're coming up
to the hospital!

1200
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,805
Oh, no! No.
I'm discharged.

1201
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:19,607
- Splendid!
- Yeah.

1202
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:21,709
Then you can stay with me.

1203
01:16:21,775 --> 01:16:23,055
I know of someone who's waiting.

1204
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,512
I'm sailing
for America tomorrow.

1205
01:16:24,578 --> 01:16:26,514
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, tomorrow.

1206
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,417
I just came down to...get
some things from the old house.

1207
01:16:29,483 --> 01:16:30,551
But Kathleen..

1208
01:16:30,618 --> 01:16:33,487
Do I look like a man
who wants to see a girl?

1209
01:16:33,554 --> 01:16:35,957
She, uh...she loves you, Ken.

1210
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:38,259
She loves me, does she?
Well, what of it?

1211
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:39,827
She'll get over it, won't she?

1212
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:41,329
You want her to get over it?

1213
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:42,940
For heaven's sake, doctor,
use your head.

1214
01:16:42,964 --> 01:16:45,066
Yes, yes, yes!
Let her get over it!

1215
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,035
You're a doctor.
Give her pills!

1216
01:16:47,101 --> 01:16:48,178
Love is a disease, isn't it?

1217
01:16:48,202 --> 01:16:50,204
Cure it. Cut it out of her!

1218
01:16:50,271 --> 01:16:51,872
I'm afraid, it is not easy.

1219
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,807
Alright, it is not easy.
So what?

1220
01:16:53,874 --> 01:16:55,176
Tell her I'm a dirty swine.

1221
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,710
Tell her I'm going
back to America

1222
01:16:56,777 --> 01:16:58,588
to marry a million dollars...
tell her I got married

1223
01:16:58,612 --> 01:17:00,814
to mademoiselle from
Armentieres. Tell her anything.

1224
01:17:00,881 --> 01:17:04,218
Oh, but it means
so much to her, Ken.

1225
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:06,287
Why not just see her?
Why not?

1226
01:17:06,354 --> 01:17:08,923
Because I haven't got the..

1227
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:10,824
Because I'm shot to pieces.

1228
01:17:10,891 --> 01:17:14,262
Because I'm still in love
with her, if you must know.

1229
01:17:14,328 --> 01:17:16,206
And, now, will you, for the love
of Judas, let me alone?

1230
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:18,366
Let me alone!
Let me alone!

1231
01:17:24,805 --> 01:17:26,707
Captain Wayne, sir!
Captain Wayne.

1232
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:28,242
- Orderly!
- Sir?

1233
01:17:30,744 --> 01:17:32,113
'Kenneth!'

1234
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,426
- Take it easy.
- Now, up with him.

1235
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:37,818
- That's right.
- Give me that.

1236
01:17:37,885 --> 01:17:39,253
- That's it.
- Steady, now, Ken.

1237
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,222
Gimme-gimme-gimme that foot.

1238
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:42,991
- Here you are.
- There we are.

1239
01:17:43,057 --> 01:17:44,292
Oh, you wait here, sir.

1240
01:17:44,358 --> 01:17:46,294
I've got a carriage waiting.
I'll get it.

1241
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,761
I'll-I'll-I'll walk to it.

1242
01:17:47,828 --> 01:17:51,032
- Now, Wayne..
- Well?

1243
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:53,867
- Well, you see, doctor?
- Yes, I see.

1244
01:17:53,934 --> 01:17:55,136
Hey, now.

1245
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,771
I'm sorry, I...I blew up
like that.

1246
01:17:57,838 --> 01:17:59,907
Oh, please!

1247
01:17:59,974 --> 01:18:01,742
Thanks, doctor.

1248
01:18:01,809 --> 01:18:03,277
Goodbye.

1249
01:18:04,245 --> 01:18:07,381
And...forget what I told you.

1250
01:18:09,283 --> 01:18:10,985
Forget you saw me.

1251
01:18:18,526 --> 01:18:21,629
We certainly had great luck
with our girls, didn't we?

1252
01:18:28,469 --> 01:18:29,703
'Here we are, sir!'

1253
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:32,040
'All that dust down there'

1254
01:18:32,106 --> 01:18:34,075
'is enough to choke ya.'

1255
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:35,942
I've packed up the few things
you wanted, sir.

1256
01:18:35,976 --> 01:18:37,287
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

1257
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,113
- Come on, let's get going.
- Righto.

1258
01:18:41,082 --> 01:18:43,084
Oh, beg your pardon, sir..

1259
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:45,619
but just now, a most
extraordinary thing happened.

1260
01:18:45,686 --> 01:18:46,686
Yeah?

1261
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,855
I was down in the cellar..

1262
01:18:47,921 --> 01:18:49,357
and I accidentally
ran into a..

1263
01:18:49,423 --> 01:18:51,359
a few bottles
of very old port.

1264
01:18:51,425 --> 01:18:52,826
1847.

1265
01:18:52,893 --> 01:18:55,463
Uh-uh, do we take it?

1266
01:18:55,529 --> 01:18:57,765
- Well, what do you think?
- We take it!

1267
01:18:57,831 --> 01:18:58,842
Shan't be a minute.
Pack it up.

1268
01:18:58,866 --> 01:19:00,034
What time is the train?

1269
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:01,402
Ten five, sir.

1270
01:19:01,469 --> 01:19:02,803
Then you better make it snappy.

1271
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:04,638
Snappy is the word, sir.

1272
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:11,312
Well, old man..

1273
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:13,781
we've got an hour.

1274
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:17,318
Let's sit down
and feel sorry for ourselves.

1275
01:19:38,472 --> 01:19:40,541
Here's to your health,
your honor

1276
01:19:40,608 --> 01:19:43,911
and the health of all your
descendants, great and small.

1277
01:19:45,646 --> 01:19:47,915
That's a mighty handsome toast!

1278
01:19:47,981 --> 01:19:49,926
It's an Irish toast,
it's the best I know.

1279
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,528
Now, you keep as young
and as pretty

1280
01:19:51,552 --> 01:19:54,788
as you are...until doomsday.

1281
01:19:54,855 --> 01:19:57,325
And never forget the man
who wished it.

1282
01:19:57,391 --> 01:19:59,059
'Oh, Ken!'

1283
01:20:01,061 --> 01:20:03,631
'Ken!'

1284
01:20:03,697 --> 01:20:05,166
'Ken!'

1285
01:20:12,573 --> 01:20:14,475
Kathleen, hello!

1286
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:16,110
Oh..

1287
01:20:16,177 --> 01:20:18,312
Oh, it is you.

1288
01:20:19,113 --> 01:20:20,781
God!

1289
01:20:23,784 --> 01:20:25,386
I can't believe it!

1290
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,789
Darling, I knew you'd come.

1291
01:20:28,856 --> 01:20:31,392
I knew you'd come.
Oh, sweet!

1292
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:33,861
It's-it's so wonderful

1293
01:20:33,927 --> 01:20:35,596
to have you in my arms again.

1294
01:20:35,663 --> 01:20:37,865
I-I-I waited so long.

1295
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,969
And darling, and how are you?

1296
01:20:42,035 --> 01:20:45,105
How are you, dear,
sweet, poor darling?

1297
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,907
Let me look at you.

1298
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:50,244
I wish I wasn't crying so much,
I could see you properly.

1299
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:52,513
Oh, darling..

1300
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,683
Uh-uh, sweetheart,
are you glad to see me?

1301
01:20:55,749 --> 01:20:58,018
- You haven't said so, you know?
- Of course, I am.

1302
01:20:58,085 --> 01:21:01,522
Oh, darling...of course you are.

1303
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:04,258
You know, I went down to
the station, I didn't find you.

1304
01:21:04,325 --> 01:21:05,502
I must have missed you,
somehow or other.

1305
01:21:05,526 --> 01:21:07,395
I was so frightened. Oh..

1306
01:21:07,461 --> 01:21:09,096
But here you are..

1307
01:21:09,163 --> 01:21:11,031
you are here
and-and you're alive

1308
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:13,634
and that's all
that matters, isn't it?

1309
01:21:14,435 --> 01:21:17,205
How did you know I was here?

1310
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:19,340
I...I saw the light
in the window, dear.

1311
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,709
I just took a chance,
I ran up here all the way.

1312
01:21:21,775 --> 01:21:24,111
My heart was pounding, I was
so afraid I wouldn't find you.

1313
01:21:24,178 --> 01:21:26,780
- So you ran all the way?
- Yes, I ran all the way.

1314
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:28,749
I broke the record!

1315
01:21:28,816 --> 01:21:31,219
Oh, uh, what do you say,
we-we sit down?

1316
01:21:31,285 --> 01:21:33,787
- Shall we?
- Oh, darling.

1317
01:21:33,854 --> 01:21:35,489
Oh!

1318
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:39,460
- O-o-over here, see?
- Alright.

1319
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:42,463
When did you get in?
Why didn't you let me know?

1320
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,073
Why haven't you written
all these months?

1321
01:21:44,097 --> 01:21:45,733
Oh, I lost your address, now..

1322
01:21:45,799 --> 01:21:47,368
Lost my address?

1323
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:49,237
I thought you'd lost
an arm or something.

1324
01:21:49,303 --> 01:21:50,480
You didn't-you didn't
lose an arm, did you?

1325
01:21:50,504 --> 01:21:52,072
No, I don't think so.

1326
01:21:52,139 --> 01:21:53,707
- Lose anything else?
- Huh?

1327
01:21:53,774 --> 01:21:56,577
- Lose your heart?
- Oh, hundreds of times.

1328
01:21:56,644 --> 01:21:59,247
Liar, mine's still here, too.

1329
01:21:59,313 --> 01:22:01,081
It's so excited, my heart.

1330
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:03,150
It's so happy.

1331
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:05,152
Darling, is your heart
happy, too?

1332
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,154
Yeah, I-I don't see why not.

1333
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:09,823
It's been such a long,
long way to Tipperary.

1334
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:12,293
- Such a long time to wait.
- Yeah.

1335
01:22:14,295 --> 01:22:17,231
But now there's no reason
why you..

1336
01:22:17,298 --> 01:22:19,400
I mean, no reason why I..

1337
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:22,035
why you and I..

1338
01:22:22,102 --> 01:22:24,272
Because you have
come back to me, dear.

1339
01:22:24,338 --> 01:22:25,649
You know, I sort of thought
that maybe you

1340
01:22:25,673 --> 01:22:28,609
wouldn't be here
when I got back.

1341
01:22:28,676 --> 01:22:30,311
That's a strange idea.
Why not?

1342
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:32,322
Well, I don't know, everything
else in the world's so changed

1343
01:22:32,346 --> 01:22:34,147
I...I sort of thought
maybe you..

1344
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:37,518
might not still be so crazy
about-about this place and..

1345
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:39,753
Why, I love it here.
You know that.

1346
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:42,055
I wouldn't trade it
for anything in the world.

1347
01:22:42,122 --> 01:22:43,924
Oh, Kenneth,
what are you driving at?

1348
01:22:46,126 --> 01:22:47,761
Want me to live somewhere else?

1349
01:22:47,828 --> 01:22:50,264
You know I'd live anywhere
in the world with you.

1350
01:22:50,331 --> 01:22:52,099
But you..

1351
01:22:52,165 --> 01:22:55,336
- You like it here, eh?
- Yes.

1352
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:58,506
Oh, that's fine.
Dear, that's fine.

1353
01:22:59,773 --> 01:23:02,175
Maybe-maybe I was right
that day that I..

1354
01:23:02,242 --> 01:23:03,420
I made you go back
to your uncle

1355
01:23:03,444 --> 01:23:05,346
when you wanted to come with me.

1356
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:06,747
Well, maybe, but..

1357
01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:09,550
Oh, don't let's talk
about those things now, dear.

1358
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:12,320
You're back...and that's all
that matters.

1359
01:23:12,386 --> 01:23:15,323
By the way, how, uh...
how-how is your uncle?

1360
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:20,728
He hasn't changed
about you, dear.

1361
01:23:21,995 --> 01:23:24,231
- But neither have I.
- Hasn't changed, eh?

1362
01:23:24,298 --> 01:23:26,367
Still nursing
that old sorrow of his?

1363
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:27,577
But we are not gonna
let that make

1364
01:23:27,601 --> 01:23:29,503
the least bit of difference,
now, dear.

1365
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:33,307
See, it...must be great
to be like that..

1366
01:23:33,374 --> 01:23:36,276
love one woman all your life.

1367
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,779
Why...yes, it must be.

1368
01:23:40,381 --> 01:23:43,116
How's everything else been?
How's, what's his name, Willie?

1369
01:23:43,183 --> 01:23:44,718
Did Willie get back alright?

1370
01:23:44,785 --> 01:23:47,054
Oh, that's good, that's good.

1371
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,890
You know, Willie-Willie
might be just a type at that.

1372
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,994
Willie would love somebody..

1373
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:55,295
all of his life.

1374
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,797
Ken, what are you talking about?

1375
01:23:56,864 --> 01:23:58,808
- I-I'm just rambling along.
- Well, will you stop?

1376
01:23:58,832 --> 01:24:01,869
Just reminiscing. Gee, we had a
lot of fun here, didn't we?

1377
01:24:01,935 --> 01:24:04,137
Remember the day we met.
Right in this room, wasn't it?

1378
01:24:04,204 --> 01:24:05,473
- Yeah, a lot of fun.
- Yeah.

1379
01:24:05,539 --> 01:24:06,916
Gee, how badly we felt
that afternoon I

1380
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:09,410
we found out I was shoving off
for France?

1381
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:11,812
Oh boy, was that love
or wasn't it?

1382
01:24:11,879 --> 01:24:12,646
Kenneth?

1383
01:24:12,713 --> 01:24:13,723
We certainly took it seriously

1384
01:24:13,747 --> 01:24:15,549
that little affair of ours.

1385
01:24:15,616 --> 01:24:18,519
To bad, we had to go
to war and grow up.

1386
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:20,921
Kenneth, what are you saying?

1387
01:24:20,988 --> 01:24:22,856
What are you trying..

1388
01:24:22,923 --> 01:24:25,693
What do you mean,
"Little affair of ours?"

1389
01:24:25,759 --> 01:24:27,937
- Ken, what's happened to you?
- Well, I've-I've been to war!

1390
01:24:27,961 --> 01:24:30,121
I know you've been to war
and I've been waiting for you

1391
01:24:30,163 --> 01:24:32,065
because I love you.

1392
01:24:32,132 --> 01:24:33,767
And I thought you loved me.

1393
01:24:33,834 --> 01:24:36,003
I thought you wanted me.

1394
01:24:36,069 --> 01:24:37,371
I, uh..

1395
01:24:37,438 --> 01:24:39,773
I'm sailing for America..

1396
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,108
tomorrow.

1397
01:24:43,276 --> 01:24:45,713
What do you mean?
Alone?

1398
01:24:47,848 --> 01:24:49,417
Alone.

1399
01:24:49,483 --> 01:24:52,453
But, Ken, I am...I'm ready
to go with you, dear.

1400
01:24:53,353 --> 01:24:54,888
Oh, you're joking.

1401
01:24:54,955 --> 01:24:56,424
Don't joke, dear.
Don't scare me...

1402
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:59,259
Alright, Kathleen,
let's not-let's not..

1403
01:24:59,326 --> 01:25:01,795
When a thing's over,
it's-it's over.

1404
01:25:04,131 --> 01:25:06,667
Oh..

1405
01:25:08,869 --> 01:25:10,471
it's over.

1406
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:12,706
I see.

1407
01:25:14,074 --> 01:25:15,576
It's over.

1408
01:25:18,612 --> 01:25:20,714
Then why did you come here?

1409
01:25:20,781 --> 01:25:23,150
Did you wanna make sure
you didn't love me?

1410
01:25:23,216 --> 01:25:25,819
Well...I hope you're sure now.

1411
01:25:25,886 --> 01:25:27,955
I hope you'll forget all about
our little affair.

1412
01:25:28,021 --> 01:25:29,799
Forget that I loved you,
that I waited for you

1413
01:25:29,823 --> 01:25:31,425
that I would've
waited for you always.

1414
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:33,461
Kathleen, I've-I've changed.

1415
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:38,832
Yes, that's right.

1416
01:25:40,033 --> 01:25:41,535
That's certainly right.

1417
01:25:41,602 --> 01:25:43,437
Four years and..

1418
01:25:43,504 --> 01:25:45,973
well, you change.

1419
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:47,741
Yes, of course. I know.

1420
01:25:47,808 --> 01:25:49,710
Of course, you've changed.

1421
01:25:51,411 --> 01:25:53,814
I'm sorry, Kenneth, I..

1422
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:56,684
I didn't mean to throw
myself at your head.

1423
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,952
I didn't mean to embarrass
you like this.

1424
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,955
I've been quite stupid,
haven't I?

1425
01:26:02,022 --> 01:26:04,458
Taking it for granted
that you'd still be..

1426
01:26:06,627 --> 01:26:10,063
Well I...guess there's not much
more to say, is there..

1427
01:26:12,132 --> 01:26:13,467
except goodbye?

1428
01:26:15,335 --> 01:26:16,670
Goodbye, Kenneth.

1429
01:26:20,474 --> 01:26:23,310
'Here we are, sir.
Anything else?'

1430
01:26:27,047 --> 01:26:29,650
Take it easy, sir.
Steady now.

1431
01:26:30,183 --> 01:26:31,184
Steady.

1432
01:26:32,986 --> 01:26:34,622
Kenneth Wayne is just
as welcome here now

1433
01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:36,790
as he was four years ago.
And no more.

1434
01:26:36,857 --> 01:26:39,860
John, John, old friend,
you can't do this.

1435
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:41,662
You're hitting a man,
when he is down!

1436
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,964
You've got to tell her
about him. I can't do it.

1437
01:26:44,031 --> 01:26:46,700
I can't take the responsibility
of sending her to him

1438
01:26:46,767 --> 01:26:48,569
if you won't help.

1439
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,939
John...he's leaving in an hour!

1440
01:26:52,005 --> 01:26:53,306
Let him go.

1441
01:26:53,373 --> 01:26:55,108
Is that plain?
Let him go.

1442
01:26:55,175 --> 01:26:58,579
You've chosen to empty your life
of everything, but hate.

1443
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:01,148
Well...I believe that same hate

1444
01:27:01,214 --> 01:27:03,316
will be around you
in the hereafter

1445
01:27:03,383 --> 01:27:06,887
'and the sweet soul of Moonyeen
will never get through it.'

1446
01:27:06,954 --> 01:27:09,523
'I believe this, John,
and I beg of you'

1447
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:12,593
I...I beg of you

1448
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:15,262
that you'll do something
about it.

1449
01:27:15,328 --> 01:27:17,865
Now, John...now!

1450
01:27:49,029 --> 01:27:50,598
Kathleen..

1451
01:27:50,664 --> 01:27:52,132
Kathleen?

1452
01:27:56,136 --> 01:27:57,605
Where have you been?

1453
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:02,209
Have you seen him...
Kenneth Wayne?

1454
01:28:02,275 --> 01:28:04,177
Have you?

1455
01:28:04,244 --> 01:28:06,747
I'm not quite sure.

1456
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:08,682
I went up to his house.

1457
01:28:08,749 --> 01:28:10,550
Do you think that was..

1458
01:28:12,252 --> 01:28:14,221
I'd give a great deal
if I hadn't.

1459
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:16,857
Badly smashed up?

1460
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:19,727
No, not physically, but..

1461
01:28:19,793 --> 01:28:22,562
Oh, I don't know what to think.

1462
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:25,265
He doesn't seem the same to me.

1463
01:28:25,332 --> 01:28:28,135
Seems to have forgotten
that we were ever..

1464
01:28:28,201 --> 01:28:29,637
that we..

1465
01:28:30,904 --> 01:28:33,040
I don't know what to think.

1466
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,777
So he ended it, eh?

1467
01:28:38,578 --> 01:28:40,748
Well, perhaps it's for the best.

1468
01:28:43,984 --> 01:28:46,119
You'll get over it, my dear.

1469
01:28:48,521 --> 01:28:49,957
You didn't.

1470
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,128
But it's not the same, is it?

1471
01:28:55,195 --> 01:28:57,264
You knew that somebody
loved you.

1472
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:59,767
You were sure of it.

1473
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:01,702
You had that memory.

1474
01:29:02,502 --> 01:29:04,104
I have nothing.

1475
01:29:05,739 --> 01:29:08,108
I thought I was sure of it.
Now, I..

1476
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,778
I have nothing.

1477
01:29:14,547 --> 01:29:16,684
His train leaves at 10:00.

1478
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,221
Oh, I wish he were gone!

1479
01:29:22,422 --> 01:29:24,758
I can't help hoping
the maddest things.

1480
01:29:29,529 --> 01:29:31,198
If a car were to drive up..

1481
01:29:32,565 --> 01:29:34,467
and if it was he..

1482
01:29:34,534 --> 01:29:36,303
come back to me..

1483
01:29:37,404 --> 01:29:39,106
that gate would have opened.

1484
01:29:39,172 --> 01:29:42,009
He would have come
into this room.

1485
01:29:43,143 --> 01:29:45,212
But, you don't understand that,
do you?

1486
01:29:45,278 --> 01:29:47,781
Oh, yes, I understand.

1487
01:29:48,849 --> 01:29:50,550
You know, it's the little things

1488
01:29:50,617 --> 01:29:51,952
his laugh..

1489
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:55,155
the crazy things
he said and did.

1490
01:29:55,222 --> 01:29:58,558
He was absolutely crazy,
you know? Doesn't make sense.

1491
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:00,928
Absolutely crazy.

1492
01:30:02,863 --> 01:30:05,098
She said that once about me.

1493
01:30:07,634 --> 01:30:09,369
It's no use.

1494
01:30:09,436 --> 01:30:10,938
I'll always love him.

1495
01:30:11,004 --> 01:30:13,741
I'm just that sort of a fool.

1496
01:30:13,807 --> 01:30:15,675
I have no pride.

1497
01:30:17,277 --> 01:30:19,079
I'd love him, whatever he'd done

1498
01:30:19,146 --> 01:30:21,148
however bad he'd treated me.

1499
01:30:22,649 --> 01:30:24,718
And if he'd died..

1500
01:30:24,785 --> 01:30:26,653
I'd always have loved him..

1501
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,221
all my life..

1502
01:30:29,556 --> 01:30:31,024
as you loved her.

1503
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:33,660
Kathleen..

1504
01:30:33,727 --> 01:30:35,228
My child..

1505
01:30:35,295 --> 01:30:36,363
Kathleen, listen.

1506
01:30:36,429 --> 01:30:38,231
I better tell you this.

1507
01:30:38,298 --> 01:30:39,699
He's wounded.

1508
01:30:44,537 --> 01:30:46,206
You mean, Kenneth is wounded?

1509
01:30:46,273 --> 01:30:48,241
Yes...badly.

1510
01:30:49,709 --> 01:30:51,178
Wounded?

1511
01:30:51,711 --> 01:30:54,114
Oh, no!

1512
01:30:55,448 --> 01:30:56,784
Why didn't he tell me?

1513
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:58,551
He didn't think
he had the right.

1514
01:30:58,618 --> 01:31:00,420
Owen saw him at the station.

1515
01:31:03,523 --> 01:31:05,325
Then that was why..

1516
01:31:05,392 --> 01:31:07,727
Oh, but doesn't he know
I'd love him even if..

1517
01:31:08,728 --> 01:31:11,131
God, my poor darling!

1518
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:13,600
Then he does love me,
he does love me!

1519
01:31:13,666 --> 01:31:16,837
As if anything else mattered,
anything else in the world!

1520
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:18,605
The train leaves at 10:00.

1521
01:31:18,671 --> 01:31:20,673
Oh, is that clock right?

1522
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,709
I must catch him!

1523
01:31:22,776 --> 01:31:24,344
Kathleen!

1524
01:31:25,879 --> 01:31:28,715
I...I hope..

1525
01:31:28,782 --> 01:31:30,884
'I-I-I should like it if..'

1526
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:32,820
Do you think
you could possibly..

1527
01:31:32,886 --> 01:31:34,487
come back here again?

1528
01:31:35,789 --> 01:31:38,225
And bring him with you?

1529
01:31:38,291 --> 01:31:39,492
Oh!

1530
01:31:44,064 --> 01:31:45,665
Oh!

1531
01:31:45,732 --> 01:31:47,868
We'll both take care of him,
won't we?

1532
01:31:54,407 --> 01:31:55,843
Owen!

1533
01:31:55,909 --> 01:31:57,244
Hello, Kathleen!

1534
01:31:57,310 --> 01:32:00,047
- What is it?
- Go to Uncle John, quickly!

1535
01:32:11,558 --> 01:32:13,026
- Oh, hello.
- Oh!

1536
01:32:14,394 --> 01:32:16,429
Well..

1537
01:32:16,496 --> 01:32:18,731
Kathleen seemed to think
you needed me.

1538
01:32:18,798 --> 01:32:20,233
Anything wrong?

1539
01:32:20,834 --> 01:32:22,369
Wrong?

1540
01:32:22,435 --> 01:32:23,937
Uh, not with me!

1541
01:32:25,038 --> 01:32:27,340
Where is Kathleen?

1542
01:32:27,407 --> 01:32:29,209
She seemed in a hurry.

1543
01:32:29,276 --> 01:32:32,145
She's gone down to the station.

1544
01:32:32,212 --> 01:32:33,513
She seemed anxious to get there

1545
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,682
before the London train left.

1546
01:32:35,748 --> 01:32:37,017
Oh!

1547
01:32:37,717 --> 01:32:39,853
She'll be coming home?

1548
01:32:41,121 --> 01:32:42,689
They'll be coming home.

1549
01:32:42,755 --> 01:32:44,124
They?

1550
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:46,359
That's what I said.

1551
01:32:46,426 --> 01:32:48,195
Oh!

1552
01:32:48,261 --> 01:32:49,529
I see!

1553
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:52,332
Well..

1554
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:54,801
Well, I'll be jogging along, hm?

1555
01:32:54,868 --> 01:32:56,970
Uh-uh, would you, uh..

1556
01:32:57,037 --> 01:32:59,039
would you care to play
a little chess?

1557
01:32:59,106 --> 01:33:00,407
I mean, now that you are here.

1558
01:33:00,473 --> 01:33:02,842
Oh, I don't mind if I do.

1559
01:33:03,843 --> 01:33:04,912
Hmm..

1560
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:09,382
Forgotten your chess, hm?

1561
01:33:09,449 --> 01:33:11,518
Forgotten more
than you ever knew.

1562
01:33:11,584 --> 01:33:12,920
Ah!

1563
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:19,092
I wonder if she'll get
there in time.

1564
01:33:20,627 --> 01:33:22,362
We'll soon know.

1565
01:33:24,965 --> 01:33:26,967
John..

1566
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:28,868
I know of someone
who would be glad

1567
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:31,071
of what you've done tonight.

1568
01:33:32,205 --> 01:33:33,873
Yes.

1569
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:35,442
She is glad.

1570
01:33:36,543 --> 01:33:37,978
I know.

1571
01:33:43,883 --> 01:33:45,285
Oh, uh..

1572
01:33:46,453 --> 01:33:48,388
By the way..

1573
01:33:48,455 --> 01:33:50,924
have I apologized
to you, Owen?

1574
01:33:50,991 --> 01:33:52,492
Apologize?

1575
01:33:53,393 --> 01:33:54,627
For what?

1576
01:33:57,864 --> 01:34:00,400
- Right you are.
- Mm-hmm.

1577
01:34:13,613 --> 01:34:15,515
Almost too dark to see.

1578
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:23,756
'Well..'

1579
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:27,303
I would like to play one game

1580
01:34:27,327 --> 01:34:29,462
and have you keep awake
till the end.

1581
01:34:30,897 --> 01:34:32,365
Hm?

1582
01:34:46,946 --> 01:34:49,016
Good old, John.

1583
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:20,747
John?

1584
01:35:22,415 --> 01:35:25,118
John!

1585
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:41,468
- Moonyeen?
- John!

1586
01:35:42,702 --> 01:35:43,836
You've come back to me.

1587
01:35:43,903 --> 01:35:47,374
No, darling.
You've come to me.

1588
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,642
It's been so lonely without you.

1589
01:35:49,709 --> 01:35:51,678
I've missed you so much.

1590
01:35:51,744 --> 01:35:53,113
You know..

1591
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,014
I almost made an awful
mess of things.

1592
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:56,149
No.

1593
01:35:56,216 --> 01:35:58,085
You must forgive me,
dear, this time.

1594
01:35:58,151 --> 01:35:59,886
I'm getting very old.

1595
01:35:59,952 --> 01:36:01,721
Old, darling?

1596
01:36:01,788 --> 01:36:03,256
Why, look.

1597
01:36:08,495 --> 01:36:10,363
Oh!

1598
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:12,299
Why, then..

1599
01:36:12,365 --> 01:36:14,334
is this what
they call, "dying?"

1600
01:36:16,069 --> 01:36:18,471
- It's nothing, is it?
- Nothing, dear!

1601
01:36:19,272 --> 01:36:21,074
And everything.

1602
01:36:22,342 --> 01:36:25,378
We're together now, forever.

1603
01:36:25,445 --> 01:36:27,147
And forever.

1604
01:36:29,749 --> 01:36:31,184
Come.

1604
01:36:32,305 --> 01:37:32,583
