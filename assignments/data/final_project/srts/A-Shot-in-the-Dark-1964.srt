1
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,702
Maria.

2
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,692
Commissioner Dreyfus.

3
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,367
Yes, my darling.

4
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,868
I was just about to call you.
I'm on my way.

5
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,465
I've got the cheese
and the Beaujolais.

6
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,703
What?

7
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,573
My love,
kiss the children for me.

8
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,745
Hold on. Yes?

9
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,946
<i>Your wife is on the other line. </i>

10
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,817
Tell her I'm out of town.

11
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,291
Yes, my love?

12
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,624
I'll be with you in 20 minutes.

13
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,531
Monsieur Dreyfus.

14
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,802
Monsieur, a catastrophe!

15
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,209
We've just had a report of a shooting
at the Chateau de la Pierre Blanche.

16
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,839
- So?
- Monsieur Ballon!

17
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,214
- What? Ballon, the millionaire?
- Yes.

18
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,684
That is a catastrophe.

19
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,780
It's not so much the shooting
that is a catastrophe.

20
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,054
When the report came in,
there were few details.

21
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,391
Just that someone had been shot
and the address.

22
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:01,455
At first I didn't realize it was
the home of the millionaire Ballon.

23
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,761
So?

24
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,735
I made a terrible mistake.

25
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,933
Who did you assign to the case?

26
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,577
Clouseau.

27
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,077
Oh, my God.

28
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,503
Inspector Clouseau.

29
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,974
Good evening, sir.

30
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,413
- What is your name?
- My name is Henri LaFarge.

31
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,418
Make a note of that.

32
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,648
- You are the butler?
- I am the head butler.

33
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:01,454
Head butler. Cross out "butler"
and put down "head butler."

34
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,798
This is Monsieur Ballon.

35
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,605
Monsieur Ballon,
it is a great honor.

36
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,606
Oh, excuse me.

37
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,041
I am Inspector Clouseau
of the Sűreté.

38
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:23,172
I must apologize for my appearance.
I had a slight accident.

39
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,376
Would you like a bathrobe?

40
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:30,353
No, nothing at all.
It's a little dampness. It will soon go.

41
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,718
Monsieur Ballon,
you reported a shooting.

42
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,261
- I didn't. Maurice did.
- Maurice?

43
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,797
Yes. He's guarding Maria.

44
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,130
I was at the airport at the time
the shooting occurred. I just arrived.

45
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,702
Of course.

46
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,501
I shall have this case
cleared up in a few seconds.

47
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,371
Would you like
to examine the body?

48
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,967
I would be delighted.

49
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,410
This way, sir.

50
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,638
- You are Maurice?
- Yes, monsieur.

51
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,419
Monsieur Ballon said
you were guarding someone.

52
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,921
Yes, monsieur.

53
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,899
This pen has been fired recently.

54
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,407
- And you are?
- Maria Gambrelli.

55
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,246
I am Inspector Clouseau.

56
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,779
How do you do?

57
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,624
See what else you can find.

58
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,423
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking the gun, Inspector.

59
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,555
- This is my pistol pen.
- I know.

60
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:23,795
Get your own, please.
This is my own personal one.

61
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,643
Don't look in here.
Look outside.

62
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,516
- What did you say?
- Nothing, monsieur.

63
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,517
You can go.

64
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,327
Now, then...

65
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,329
Please.

66
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,305
- You found the body?
- Yes, monsieur.

67
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,109
Afriend of yours?

68
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:13,107
- Any idea who killed him?
- I've no idea.

69
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,016
- She killed him.
- What?

70
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,384
- That's not true.
- She says it's not true.

71
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,753
- She is lying.
- You watch your tongue.

72
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,486
I heard four shots.

73
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,188
<i>You heard four shots.
You did not see four.</i>

74
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,629
I am sorry.
You did not see these four shots.

75
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,758
No, monsieur.

76
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,770
Then you could not possibly know
who fired those shots.

77
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,999
The door was locked
from the inside.

78
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,506
What does that prove?

79
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,100
When I broke it open,
I found Miguelwhere you see him

80
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,543
and Maria with a gun in her hand.

81
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,248
- With a gun in her hand?
- Still smoking.

82
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,976
Did you have the gun in your hand?

83
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,946
Was it still smoking?

84
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,082
I suppose so.

85
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,219
But I don't know how it got there.
I really don't!

86
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,059
- Ridiculous!
- I will decide what is ridiculous.

87
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,328
- You surely don't believe...
- I believe everything.

88
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,336
And I believe nothing.

89
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,906
I suspect everyone.

90
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,976
And I suspect no one.

91
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,470
I gather the facts,

92
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,014
examine the clues,

93
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,813
and before you know it,
the case is solved.

94
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,787
There is much here
that does not meet the eye.

95
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,824
That is quite obvious.

96
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,987
- What was that you said?
- Nothing, monsieur.

97
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,591
All right, you can go now.

98
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,432
Yes, monsieur.

99
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,769
But do not try to leave.

100
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,935
Everyone in this household
is under suspicion.

101
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,444
Yes, monsieur.

102
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,058
Now, supposing you tell me
what happened.

103
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,528
He was having difficulty
with the buttons.

104
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,099
- Buttons?
- The buttons on my dress.

105
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:13,203
That is very strange, because
there are no buttons on this dress.

106
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,274
That is because
he was having difficulty with them.

107
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,536
So he just tore the dress off.

108
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,168
He attacked you?

109
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,682
Oh, no! I would have helped him,
but he couldn't wait.

110
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,308
The buttons are probably
all over the room.

111
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,045
He was so impetuous.

112
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,147
A passionate Spaniard, you know?

113
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:40,791
And he tore your dress off?

114
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,426
Yes. Then suddenly
someone opened the door.

115
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,470
Miguel leapt up and...

116
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,039
That is the last I remember

117
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,734
until Maurice came in
and found me with a gun.

118
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,005
Yes. There is,
if you will excuse me,

119
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,583
something here I do not
quite understand.

120
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,481
What don't you understand?

121
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,618
I don't understand

122
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,286
when you say
that you don't remember.

123
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,830
I guess I was unconscious.

124
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,161
- Unconscious?
- I have a bump.

125
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,928
Bump? Where?

126
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,301
Let me see. Oh, yes!

127
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,500
I don't know how it happened,
but it is so painful.

128
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,975
That is beautiful perfume
you're wearing.

129
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,978
- It's bath oil.
- Is it?

130
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,278
I really can't figure it out.
Someone must have hit me.

131
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,785
You have received
a mild concussion.

132
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,378
You have cream on your nose.

133
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,822
What? Oh, it's nothing.
It's from that thing over there.

134
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,895
You're allwet!
Is it raining?

135
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:48,330
No. That stupid driver of mine
parked too close to the fountain.

136
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:53,030
You should get out of these clothes.
You'll catch your death of pneumonia.

137
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,571
Yes, I probably will,

138
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:58,234
but it's all part
of life's rich pageant.

139
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:02,245
We police have to put up with a lot
of things because of our duties

140
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,976
that in private life
one wouldn't normally tolerate.

141
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,317
Why don't we have a smoke?
Helps to calm the nerves

142
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,448
and enable us to think more clearly.

143
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,125
Lovely perfume you're wearing.

144
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,597
That's not perfume.
That's bath oil.

145
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,534
- Oh, is it? It's very beautiful.
- Thank you.

146
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,161
I still smell it.

147
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,540
Now, where were we?

148
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,337
My bump.

149
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,880
Bump, right, that you received
when somebody hit you.

150
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,609
At least we presume
somebody hit you.

151
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,446
How else could it have happened?

152
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:44,215
In the police force,
first we presume. After, we find out.

153
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,315
That is the way we always work.
If we work the other way...

154
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,623
Goodness, it's stuffy in here.

155
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,629
- Your coat!
- Yes, it is my coat.

156
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,358
But it's on fire!

157
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,663
What? My coat is on fire!

158
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,566
My goodness, I'm burning!

159
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,777
Clouseau?

160
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,744
He fell out of the window!

161
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,272
Clouseau?

162
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,223
Are you all right?

163
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,824
Yes, I am perfectly all right.
Thank you.

164
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,897
In that case, you may go home.

165
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,965
Go home?

166
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,262
- You are relieved.
- Relieved?

167
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,567
I am taking charge.
Good night, Clouseau.

168
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,475
Good night, sir.

169
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,313
I'm sorry.

170
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,357
You idiot! You fool!

171
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,185
It's good I was able
to check my reflexes.

172
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,264
I might have killed you
with a karate chop.

173
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,760
You fool!

174
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,933
Just for that, you're off the case.

175
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,951
Back to town.

176
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,788
- When can I have the report?
- First thing in the morning.

177
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,263
Thank you.

178
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,490
Excuse me.

179
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,730
Monsieur Ballon?
I'm Commissioner Dreyfus.

180
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,035
Where is Inspector Clouseau?

181
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,042
I am personally taking charge
of this investigation.

182
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,044
I promise that you
and Madame Ballon

183
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,376
will be inconvenienced
as little as possible,

184
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:54,543
and the Ballon name will not suffer
the sensationalism of the press.

185
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,713
He was a strange fellow,
but I rather liked him.

186
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,423
I mean Clouseau.

187
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:04,256
Yes. He's an extraordinary man.

188
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,247
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

189
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,479
One moment, please.
Commissioner Dreyfus.

190
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,192
Hello. Inspector Clouseau here.

191
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,925
Get down here immediately.
You're back on the Gambrelli case.

192
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,364
The Gambrelli case?

193
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:53,632
Maria Gambrelli.
The maid who killed the chauffeur.

194
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:57,004
Oh, Maria Gambrelli, the maid.
Yes, excellent.

195
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,509
I'll be there right away.
Thank you.

196
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,239
Kato, I am back on the case.

197
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,539
I tellyou,
Maria Gambrelli is beautiful.

198
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,776
Innocent.

199
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:13,120
That was a good workout.
You're showing marked improvement.

200
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,420
Every day you're getting better.

201
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,060
Facts, Hercule, facts.

202
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,638
Nothing matters but the facts.

203
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,708
Without them, the science
of criminal investigation

204
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,369
is nothing more
than a guessing game.

205
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,042
You listen to me
and you will learn something.

206
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,745
Now then,
the facts in this case are...

207
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,582
The body
of the chauffeur was found

208
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,748
in the bedroom
of the second maid. Fact!

209
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,794
Cause of death...
four bullets in the chest. Fact!

210
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,129
The bullets were fired at close range

211
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:57,963
from a.25 caliber
Beretta automatic. Fact!

212
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,128
Maria Gambrelli was discovered

213
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,366
with the murder weapon
in her hand. Fact!

214
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,204
The murder weapon was registered

215
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,904
in the name of the deceased,
Miguel Ostos,

216
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,982
and was kept
in the glove compartment

217
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,279
of the Ballon Rolls-Royce. Fact!

218
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,355
Members of the household staff
have testified

219
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,481
that Miguel Ostos beat...

220
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,620
Careful, you fool.
You've broken my pointing stick.

221
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,821
I've got nothing to point with now.

222
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:32,700
...have testified that Miguel Ostos
beat Maria Gambrelli frequently.

223
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:37,036
Finally comes the sworn statement
of Monsieur and Madame Ballon,

224
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,940
as well as all the members
of the staff,

225
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,673
each of them with perfect alibis.

226
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:48,682
Hercule, what is
the inescapable conclusion?

227
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,154
Maria Gambrelli killed the chauffeur.

228
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:56,125
What? You idiot! Lmpossible!
She's protecting someone.

229
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,219
- How do you know that?
- Instinct!

230
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,729
But the facts.

231
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,595
You are forgetting
the most important fact... motive.

232
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,760
- He beat her.
- He was Spanish.

233
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,871
- He tore her dress off.
- Don't be ridiculous.

234
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,533
Would you kill somebody
who tore your dress off?

235
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,102
- I suppose not.
- Of course not.

236
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:19,877
No. There is no doubt
in my mind whatsoever, Hercule.

237
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,785
Maria Gambrelli is most definitely
protecting somebody.

238
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,380
Find that somebody,
and you have found the murderer.

239
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:30,894
I shall find the murderer
before the day is out.

240
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:35,729
Maria Gambrelli will tell me
who he is. Oh, yes.

241
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,438
- What was that you said?
- Nothing.

242
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,566
I see. All right.
You can go, Hercule.

243
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,797
I don't understand.

244
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:18,069
Why did you reassign Clouseau
to the Gambrelli case?

245
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,439
That is a good question,
and it deserves an answer.

246
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:27,314
What I'm about to tellyou must
remain in the strictest confidence.

247
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,584
This morning at 6:00 I received
a phone call from a superior.

248
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,923
I was informed that certain
extremely influential parties

249
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,930
were interested in having Clouseau
back on the case.

250
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,057
I had no choice but to comply.

251
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,829
Amazing.

252
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:49,839
If I were to divulge the identity
of the caller, you'd realize how amazing.

253
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,408
But why?

254
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,967
That's another good question.
And for that, I have no answer.

255
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,446
They're bringing in
the Gambrelli woman.

256
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,755
Sit down, Miss Gambrelli.

257
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,692
Sit down, Miss Gambrelli.

258
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,998
Now, where were...

259
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,999
Good morning, monsieur.

260
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,439
- Good morning, Miss Gambrelli.
- Good morning.

261
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,816
- You slept well?
- No.

262
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:47,255
- Wonderful.
- It is not easy to sleep in prison.

263
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,794
It isn't?
No, of course it isn't!

264
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,693
We shall have to do something
about that, won't we?

265
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,072
Stupid box.

266
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,711
But anyway,
first a few simple questions.

267
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,676
Is it all right if I smoke?

268
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,946
Yes, of course.
Have one of mine.

269
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,281
Thank you.

270
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,553
Well, have one of mine.

271
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,091
Thank you.

272
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:26,391
- Very, very kind of you.
- That's all right.

273
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,863
Allow me.

274
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,669
Thank you. Other way round.

275
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,365
Tastes very bad when you do that.

276
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,769
Well, now...

277
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,877
Are you comfortable?

278
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,041
They should have chairs like this
in the prison.

279
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,016
Yes, most certainly.

280
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,145
The furniture is deplorable,
extremely bad taste.

281
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,918
Terrible. One might as well
sit on the floor.

282
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,722
It's really time somebody did
something about it, don't you think?

283
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,057
Sure.

284
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,860
I will do something about it
this very moment!

285
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,532
Give me the prison superintendent
immediately.

286
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,763
<i>Yes, sir. </i>

287
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,807
Sometimes it's necessary
to cut though the red tape

288
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,843
and strike at the heart
of the matter.

289
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:16,710
Prison is bad enough
without uncomfortable furniture.

290
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,308
Yes?

291
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,677
Superintendent,
this is Inspector Clouseau.

292
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,517
When are you going to do something

293
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,183
about that terrible furniture
in your prison?

294
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,922
We are not savages!
This is not the Middle Ages.

295
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,989
You are running a house of correction,
not a torture chamber.

296
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,125
That made him think.

297
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,637
I suggest you take the matter
under serious consideration.

298
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,536
To cope with the modern criminal,

299
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,041
it is necessary
to use modern methods.

300
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,374
You can't have
a contemporary prison

301
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,209
without contemporary furniture.

302
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,945
Yes. That's my opinion anyway.

303
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,013
And the same to you,
Superintendent.

304
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,586
Filthy swine.

305
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,889
You're not like a policeman.

306
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,655
In your dossier...

307
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:16,005
I always keep my important
documents under lock and key

308
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,473
because one can never be too sure.

309
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,175
Now, here...

310
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,813
Excuse me.

311
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,987
Stupid of me.

312
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,861
Now...

313
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:54,303
Miss Gambrelli,
your dossier contains

314
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,212
some very, very interesting facts.

315
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:03,117
It seems you have known
Miguel Ostos for quite some time.

316
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,688
Yes.

317
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,984
- Were you in love with him?
- Yes!

318
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,254
You were in love with the man
that raped you?

319
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,885
That what?

320
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,799
Testimony of Georges Duval,
gardener.

321
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,960
Referring to Ostos,
you described him, and I quote,

322
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,506
as "that crazy Spaniard
who raped me in my father's field."

323
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:27,442
- He did not rape me.
- He did not force you?

324
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,639
You see, I tripped over a root

325
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,842
and I grabbed Miguel
to keep me from falling.

326
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,079
Somehow we both fell.

327
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,550
I cried a little bit afterwards,

328
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,126
but that wasn't because
I was sorry it happened.

329
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,889
It was something he said.

330
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,830
- He insulted you?
- No!

331
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,630
He lit a cigarette,
took a long puff and...

332
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,640
Why do so many men
smoke afterwards?

333
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,005
No wonder
tobacco companies get rich!

334
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,905
I admit, I'd never thought of it
quite that way.

335
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:11,253
Last night was to be our last night.
It was all finished.

336
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:15,520
- You were leaving him?
- Oh, no! He was leaving me!

337
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:19,892
Poor Miguel. He was really
in one of his moods last night.

338
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,126
First he babbled in Spanish,
and then he cried.

339
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,600
He really broke down and cried.

340
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,603
- You don't say.
- I do say.

341
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,970
When I tried to console him,
make him feel better,

342
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,943
suddenly he was tearing off
my clothes and cursing like a madman.

343
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,243
Very strange.

344
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,111
Very strange.

345
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,713
There's something
I don't understand.

346
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,486
Ostos was leaving you,

347
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,755
and yet, by your own account,

348
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,491
he was behaving
like a jealous madman.

349
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:59,693
You see, I thought
if he was leaving me,

350
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:03,399
he'd suffer,
thinking that I was alone.

351
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:08,371
And so I told him
there was someone else.

352
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,541
It was a lie. I admit that.

353
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,447
But only out of kindness!

354
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,415
I'm sorry.

355
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:22,584
- Nothing at all. Stupid tailor.
- Beautiful suit.

356
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:26,925
Yes. But don't worry.
A few stitches and you'll never know.

357
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,059
Miguel?

358
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,334
Hercule?

359
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,304
Must I go back to prison?

360
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,338
Unfortunately, yes.

361
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,743
But don't give up hope.

362
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,740
- What do you want?
- You sent for me.

363
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,613
Of course I sent for you!

364
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,985
Good-bye.

365
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,921
Good-bye, Miss Gambrelli.

366
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,642
There's no doubt in my mind
she is shielding someone.

367
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,012
Do you think
you can break her down?

368
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,080
Given enough time, I could have her
eating out of my hand.

369
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,482
Anyway, we have no time.

370
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,117
I must catch this man
before he leaves the country.

371
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,458
But if you don't know who he is...

372
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,293
She will lead me to him.
Release her.

373
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,196
- Release her?
- Of course!

374
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,565
How can she lead me to him
if she's still in prison?

375
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,797
But Commissioner Dreyfus...

376
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,569
I will assume complete responsibility.
Release her immediately!

377
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,406
I will apprehend this culprit
within 24 hours.

378
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,108
Get me out of here.

379
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,207
Quickly, or I shall scream.

380
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,184
Look, I've got Africa
all over my hand now.

381
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,036
Balloons.

382
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,740
Do you have a license
to sell these balloons?

383
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,613
License?

384
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,921
- Yes?
- Good morning, monsieur.

385
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,125
Good morning, Georges.
Is there something I can do for you?

386
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,331
Why, yes. And perhaps there's
something I can do for you.

387
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,908
What could you possibly do for me?

388
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,978
Do you remember
the night of the murder?

389
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,207
- Is that a rhetorical question?
- What?

390
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,580
Come along, Georges,
what is it you want?

391
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:38,121
I saw you climbing down
from Maria's room.

392
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,956
You have sharp eyes.

393
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,959
Yes, and a big stomach.

394
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:47,087
So hard to keep it filled.
Prices these days.

395
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,428
Are we going to discuss
the national economy,

396
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,262
or will you come to the point?

397
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,770
The point is 100,000 francs.

398
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,863
You know, for the groceries.

399
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,511
Then perhaps my eyes
will grow small again.

400
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:07,181
Yes. We'll certainly have to do
something about your stomach.

401
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,169
Go away!

402
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,746
Nice doggie.

403
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,388
Excuse me.
I just happened to be passing.

404
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,864
You have been cutting flowers.

405
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,341
You've been cutting something.
There's blood all over your shears.

406
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,704
That's very strange.

407
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,718
Facts, Hercule, facts.

408
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:25,592
Behind them lies the whole fabric
of deductive truth.

409
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:29,093
Hercule, let us examine these facts.

410
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,603
One... she was found with
the murder weapon in her hands.

411
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,572
Two... the murder weapon
was fresh with blood.

412
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:41,441
Three... there were no fingerprints
on the murder weapon other than hers.

413
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:45,538
And four... all the members
of the Ballon household staff

414
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,082
have perfect alibis.

415
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,519
Now then, Hercule,
what do these facts add up to?

416
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,751
Maria Gambrelli
killed Georges the gardener.

417
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,794
You are an idiot!

418
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,422
Only a fresh-faced novice would
come up with a conclusion like that.

419
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,229
Whoever killed Miguel
killed Georges the gardener,

420
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,497
and he did it to cover up
the first crime.

421
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:11,268
He's trying to lay the blame
at the foot of this poor servant girl.

422
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,741
Who do you suspect?

423
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,375
I suspect everyone.

424
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,382
I suppose that is possible.

425
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,884
Possible?
What do you mean, possible?

426
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,887
I deal in certainties.

427
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,854
I have only to break her down,

428
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,323
make her admit
she's protecting somebody,

429
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,988
and then force her
to divulge his identity.

430
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,859
There can be
no more cat-and-mouse.

431
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,360
No more subtle interrogation.

432
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,801
For her own sake,
and for the sake of justice,

433
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,176
I will resort to any means
short of brute force

434
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,340
to drag it out of her!

435
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,350
True, she will suffer.

436
00:40:55,052 --> 00:41:00,149
But in the end, she will be free
and we will have our killer.

437
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,259
- He released her again?
- Yes, sir.

438
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,723
Shallwe settle this thing now,

439
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,894
or do you intend making me late
for the recital?

440
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,371
We can't just fire her.
She's given us no cause.

441
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,341
Cause? We are up to our necks
in dead bodies.

442
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,607
<i>What are you waiting for,
the last act of Hamlet?</i>

443
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,046
If you're going to compare
the Ballon household

444
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,639
with a Shakespearean tragedy,

445
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,345
<i>Macbeth would be
more appropriate.</i>

446
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,449
Darling, my cue ball.

447
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,576
That was Madame Ballon.
Follow her.

448
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:35,140
When you've discovered
her destination, call me immediately.

449
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,613
Inspector Clouseau.

450
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,286
- Good evening, Monsieur Ballon.
- Good evening, Inspector.

451
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,492
There are one or two questions
I would like to ask,

452
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,569
some points that need clearing up.

453
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,638
Certainly. You play billiards?

454
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,105
Billiards? Yes, I have played
some billiards.

455
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:02,144
I find it makes for a more relaxed
and friendly conversation.

456
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,544
- Yes.
- Take a cue.

457
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:06,911
Cue, yes.

458
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,011
That will do.

459
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:18,958
Very strange.

460
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,692
You'd be better off with
an ordinary cue. That's a bridge.

461
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,893
The bridge cue! Yes.

462
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:28,301
I much prefer the good
old-fashioned plain cue.

463
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,032
Yes, yes.

464
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,972
I'm most terribly sorry.

465
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,581
I'm dreadfully sorry.

466
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:42,379
That's all right.
I've broken a few in my time.

467
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:45,978
Try this one.
This is my favorite cue.

468
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:52,153
You'll find that it's great
for curved shots.

469
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,441
You had some questions?

470
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:11,707
Yes.

471
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,743
I had hoped to have a talk
with your wife.

472
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,947
Well, she's out.
You just missed her.

473
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:22,355
On the contrary. She just missed me
in the driveway going out.

474
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,605
Monsieur Ballon, did you not state...

475
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:42,111
...that on the night of the murder

476
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:47,946
you had just arrived from London
on the 11:00 flight?

477
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,013
Yes. Why do you ask?

478
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,284
It was canceled
due to bad weather.

479
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,788
I arrived on an earlier flight.

480
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:01,023
I put it to you directly,
Monsieur Ballon,

481
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,498
that it was you
who murdered Miguel Ostos.

482
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,463
Don't be ridiculous.

483
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,610
You can just...
That's it.

484
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,613
These curved cues can be difficult.

485
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,376
Pull.

486
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,312
I disliked Miguel intensely,

487
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:29,256
but I'm not in the habit of killing people
merely because I dislike them.

488
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,259
I beg your pardon.

489
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:36,264
I may as well
tellyou the whole thing.

490
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,732
The night that Miguelwas killed,

491
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,202
I arranged for him
to meet the 11:00 plane.

492
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,500
I arrived on the 9:00.

493
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,632
He would be
on his way to the airport

494
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,108
while I was on my way home.

495
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,509
My wife was at a dinner party.

496
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:54,550
This would give me
a whole hour alone in the house!

497
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,221
For what?

498
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:00,682
For Maria.

499
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,987
What?

500
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,854
Does that surprise you?

501
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,904
Then I submit, Inspector Ballon,
that you arrived home,

502
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,741
found Miguelwith Maria Gambrelli,

503
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,748
and killed him in
a rit of fealous jage.

504
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,977
I admit to the affair,
but to kill for her...

505
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:34,546
- Would you kill for her?
- Of course... not.

506
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,784
- It's stillyour shot.
- Yes!

507
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,921
I'm dreadfully sorry,
Monsieur Ballon.

508
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:09,356
I appear to have grazed
your billiard table.

509
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,629
Telephone, monsieur,
for Inspector Clouseau.

510
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:16,926
That would be for me.

511
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,943
Yes, this is Inspector Clouseau.

512
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:43,023
All right, you stay there.
I will come over immediately.

513
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,922
Monsieur Ballon,
I wonder if you could oblige.

514
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,090
I have to meet my assistant,
and I am without a car.

515
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,634
- I'll have Pierre drive you.
- Excellent.

516
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:56,194
I suppose this is the end of our game.
Mind putting my cue away?

517
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,243
Have Pierre bring the car around.

518
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,935
The car is ready, monsieur.

519
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,531
I'm dreadfully sorry,
Monsieur Ballon.

520
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:36,636
Don't concern yourself, Inspector.
Maurice will do it for you.

521
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,719
Let go of my back.

522
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,251
Thank you, monsieur.

523
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:56,295
Whoever invented that rack
should have his head examined.

524
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,235
Well, we will continue
at anothertime.

525
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,306
A pleasure at any time.

526
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,610
I suggest you have your architect
investigated as well.

527
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,429
Madame Ballon is in apartment 12,
second floor.

528
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,261
If I'm not out within ten minutes,
send reinforcements.

529
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,128
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

530
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:48,193
I'm the game warden.
Do you have a hunting license?

531
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,068
Hunting license?

532
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,378
He was shooting crows?

533
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:08,390
He was disguised as a hunter
in order to watch the Ballon house.

534
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,728
Give me ten men like Clouseau,
and I could destroy the world.

535
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,703
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

536
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,399
After I got his release,
he got a phone call.

537
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,840
He ran out of his office
saying he had a lead

538
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,968
that would crack the case.

539
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,981
This case is so full of cracks,
one more won't make any difference.

540
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:44,222
- Francois.
- Yes, Commissioner?

541
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,227
I just cut off my thumb.

542
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:05,107
You say you followed Maria Gambrelli
to this godforsaken place?

543
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,682
She took a taxi this far,

544
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:10,685
then I followed her up the pathway
to the entrance to Camp Sunshine.

545
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,482
- Camp Sunshine?
- Yes.

546
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:15,956
I would have called you, but I perceived
Dudu the maid also enter the camp.

547
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,050
- Up the path, you say?
- Yes, but, Inspector...

548
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:22,120
You return to the Ballon residence
and look for more clues.

549
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:25,929
I will try to see what is afoot
at this Camp Sunshine.

550
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,527
Hurry up, man.
There's not a second to lose.

551
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,499
Good afternoon.

552
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:03,465
I am Inspector Clouseau
of the Sűreté.

553
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:10,669
Have you anyone registered here
by the name of Maria Gambrelli?

554
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,944
Gambrelli. Yes, I believe she
checked in about an hour ago.

555
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:19,147
Yes. Gambrelli. 11:45.

556
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,848
Where can I find her?

557
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,948
She could be most anywhere,

558
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,550
but my guess would be
the recreation area.

559
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:27,791
Thank you.

560
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:35,964
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

561
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,039
Have you been swmming?

562
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,805
Why, yes!
How did you know?

563
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:45,278
It is my business to know.

564
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,069
Where do you think you're going?

565
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,943
I do not think, sir.
I know where I am going.

566
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,379
I am going to the recreation area.

567
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,417
- Not like that, you're not.
- What was that you said?

568
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,352
You're not going
to the recreation area like that.

569
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,520
I am Inspector Clouseau
of the Sűreté.

570
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:29,887
How do you do? I'm Turk.

571
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,585
I am here on official business

572
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:34,289
Iooking for someone
at the recreation area.

573
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,729
Not unless you take off your clothes.

574
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:41,930
- You, sir, are under arrest.
- What for?

575
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:45,201
For making lewd and suggestive
remarks to an official.

576
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,868
- Lewd and suggestive remarks?
- Also for indecent exposure.

577
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,411
- Doesn't anyone wear clothes here?
- No.

578
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,879
- What?
- This is a nudist colony.

579
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,846
A nudist colony?

580
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:00,616
Right. Nobody gets in
unless they take their clothes off.

581
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,287
What, all of them?

582
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:08,660
All of them,
right down to your mustache.

583
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,060
Are you the one
who called the police?

584
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,969
- Someone reported a murder.
- Murder?

585
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,133
Tell the men to search the camp.

586
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,336
One of your men
is already in the camp.

587
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:38,903
- One of my men?
- Yes. Inspector Clouseau.

588
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,618
- I'm so sorry.
- Murder!

589
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,181
Beg your pardon.

590
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,688
Clouseau!

591
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,017
Over here.

592
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:33,162
Quick.

593
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:39,465
- Listen. That's Dudu.
- Dudu?

594
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,669
She's dead.

595
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:44,440
Dead? Dudu?

596
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:01,823
Come out!

597
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:06,299
Out! Round up everyone!

598
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:09,200
Get me that idiot,
if you can find him.

599
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,772
Straight away, sir.

600
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:16,134
If someone has been murdered here,
please let it be Clouseau.

601
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,585
- What are we going to do?
- We can't leave without our clothes.

602
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,856
I'm getting cold.
Just look at those goose pimples.

603
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,243
Clouseau!

604
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:27,278
- I know how you feel.
- I'm having a nightmare.

605
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:30,580
It's nothing to what would have
happened if they had caught us.

606
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,587
What do we do now?

607
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:36,785
You keep down, then they can
only see the top half of me.

608
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:40,454
Perhaps they will think I've just
come from the beach, from a swm.

609
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:44,499
We can't just keep
driving around. Please.

610
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:50,334
No. I will take us to my apartment
and somehow try to get us inside.

611
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,568
Whatever happens,
try to keep calm.

612
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,941
I assure you she's not in the house.

613
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,451
Sorry, but it is necessary
that I see for myself.

614
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,186
She has not been
in the house all day?

615
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,458
She left before I did this morning

616
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,626
and she wasn't here
when I got back an hour ago.

617
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,637
- Henri can verify that.
- Henri?

618
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,905
- The head butler.
- I'd like to talk to Henri.

619
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,808
Well, he could've verified it.

620
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,319
Only a few more blocks now.

621
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,127
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

622
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,895
I'm going to start screaming
and won't be able to stop.

623
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,938
Please, try to hold on to yourself.

624
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,723
Controlyourself, please!

625
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,985
You are off the Gambrelli case.

626
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,316
You will report for duty
to the Department of Records.

627
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,720
- Department of Records?
- In Martinique.

628
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:24,418
Tomorrow morning,
or you can forget your pension.

629
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,325
That is not fair.
I was only doing my duty.

630
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:31,833
And I am right, you will see.
Maria Gambrelli is not a murderer.

631
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,598
There is something personal in this.

632
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:39,197
Yes, deeply personal.

633
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,209
I hate you.
Every little bit of you.

634
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:43,944
Now get out!

635
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,673
You want me to leave?

636
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,155
You are making a terrible mistake.

637
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:57,624
If Maria Gambrelli is not a murderer,
and I say she is not,

638
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,754
you are sending an innocent girl
to the guillotine.

639
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,564
Excuse me, Francois.

640
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,235
And another thing!

641
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,273
Martinique?

642
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,779
He's on his way.

643
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:33,889
What about those influential parties
that wanted Clouseau on the case?

644
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:36,560
Whatever they do to me now,

645
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,567
it is not half of what
he has done already.

646
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:43,831
Besides...

647
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:49,208
I feel certain I know who
is behind those influential requests.

648
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,837
- Ballon.
- Ballon?

649
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,406
It's obvious he was having an affair
with Maria Gambrelli.

650
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:56,883
Most likely.

651
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,614
At first I couldn't understand
why anyone

652
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:03,123
would want a man like Clouseau
to be in charge of a murder case,

653
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:05,250
especially a case of this importance.

654
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:08,489
- But why would Ballon?
- He wouldn't.

655
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,895
Unless he was protecting someone.

656
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,991
If you were protecting someone,

657
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:15,662
who would be
the perfect man on the case?

658
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,136
Afool.

659
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,799
A detective who is
a complete and utter fool.

660
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,309
- Clouseau?
- Of course.

661
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,208
If Maria Gambrelli is convicted,

662
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,679
Ballon is up to his ears
in a very nasty scandal.

663
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:31,276
Clouseau was his insurance policy
against such a scandal.

664
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,322
Well, he has gone.

665
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,390
I feel like a child again.

666
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:45,023
It's an interesting theory,
but what if you are wrong?

667
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,267
I know it's an extremely
remote possibility,

668
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:53,172
but what if Ballon
is not protecting Maria Gambrelli?

669
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,800
What if she's innocent,
as Clouseau claims?

670
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,275
- Ridiculous.
- But a possibility.

671
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,577
What if Ballon
is protecting someone else?

672
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:05,916
Or what if Ballon himself
is the guilty party?

673
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,785
That's a sadistic thing to suggest.

674
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:12,054
But if only for the sake of discussion,
what if you are wrong,

675
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:16,996
and Clouseau,
a complete and utter fool...

676
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:18,726
I'd be ruined.

677
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,927
It's something to consider.

678
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:31,546
- Francois?
- Yes, Commissioner?

679
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:34,138
Would you please call for a doctor?

680
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,609
Are you ill?

681
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,720
I seem to have stabbed myself
with a letter opener.

682
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,515
Kato, you fool.
Get off of me!

683
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:11,552
Get off of me.
What are you doing? Not now!

684
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:21,891
Kato, release me, you fool.

685
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,433
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

686
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,562
Give me that telephone, you idiot!

687
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,442
Inspector Clouseau here.

688
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:38,479
This is the Commissioner.
You are back on the Gambrelli case.

689
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,385
Well, Kato, I'm back on the case.

690
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:52,294
Now to set the trap,
catch the killer...

691
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:58,460
...and prove to the world that Maria
Gambrelli is innocent of murder.

692
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:01,301
Hello, this is Inspector Clouseau.

693
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:04,236
Connect me
with my assistant immediately.

694
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:09,810
I'm ashamed of myself, Kato.
I forgot the first rule of self-defense.

695
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:13,575
No matter what the circumstances,
always anticipate the unexpected.

696
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:15,980
Had you been a real assassin,
you might have killed me.

697
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,144
We must accelerate
our training program.

698
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:21,121
You must attack me whenever
and wherever I least expect it.

699
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:23,817
And you must give no quarter.
Understand?

700
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,451
Hello, Hercule?
This is Clouseau.

701
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,962
I am back on the case.

702
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:31,726
Right. Release Maria Gambrelli
at once,

703
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,326
and make a reservation for two
tonight 8:00 at the Café Olé.

704
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,029
Right. Bye-bye.

705
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,767
Kato, unpack my things
and lay out my new blue suit.

706
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:45,472
I'm going to have a lovely hot soak
in a nice warm bath,

707
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,811
and I will plan out my strategy.

708
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,352
He released her again.

709
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:36,259
And he's taking her out to dinner.

710
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,997
Every paper in Paris has the story,

711
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:44,698
<i>including
the Christian Science Monitor. </i>

712
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,139
And he gave them the story.

713
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,939
You see, he claims
she's protecting her lover,

714
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:53,708
and the best way to force him
into the open is to make him jealous.

715
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:55,977
Jealous.

716
01:10:56,885 --> 01:11:00,480
That nincompoop.
That megalomaniac.

717
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:05,288
He's setting the science of criminal
investigation back 1,000 years.

718
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,794
And I can't do anything about it.

719
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:09,921
- Why not?
- Why not?

720
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,730
What if he's right?

721
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,196
What if he is?

722
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:17,829
I'm finished, washed up.

723
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:22,001
Sanity and reason become things
of the past. Madness reigns.

724
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,207
- Just relax.
- With Clouseau loose in the world?

725
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:29,546
You go about offering
irresponsible suggestions like that,

726
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,620
and you'd better find yourself
a good analyst.

727
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,518
- Just lie down.
- Just lie down.

728
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,456
- And relax.
- And relax.

729
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:39,322
Don't you think I want to relax?

730
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:42,363
I'd give my right arm
for a good night's sleep.

731
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,989
I haven't closed my eyes
in three days.

732
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:49,402
I've only eaten a chicken leg and
some clear broth since Wednesday.

733
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,302
I'm cracking up.

734
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:54,035
I'm coming apart at the seams.

735
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,737
Look at my eye.
I used to have a good eye.

736
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:59,040
I had two eyes, I mean.

737
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,740
Doctor, there is no hope.

738
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:03,784
There is no hope unless
I can get rid of Clouseau.

739
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,785
I must get rid of Clouseau.

740
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,356
What's wrong?

741
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:15,275
I'm not going to let you look at me
going up the stairs,

742
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,112
you naughty thing.

743
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,414
To take off your pants.

744
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,822
I'm just unlocking the door.

745
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:28,623
You split up your pants so you could
lure me into this apartment of yours.

746
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:32,257
Well, this is my apartment.

747
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:34,961
I know this is your apartment.

748
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,935
How about a little lure?

749
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:39,336
Nothing lure. You lure a-loo.

750
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:43,275
Lure a-loo, loo, loo, loo.

751
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:44,936
- Do you know...
- What?

752
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:47,446
I know this is your apartment,

753
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,676
but that won't help you
in the least bit.

754
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:53,585
Why won't that help me
in the least bit?

755
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:56,919
The answer,
Mr. Police Inspector...

756
01:19:57,025 --> 01:20:00,426
- Jacques Clouseau is the name.
- I've given up sex.

757
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,964
I've given up sex.

758
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:29,448
Promise me.

759
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:31,890
What, darling?

760
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:36,453
Afterwards, you will not smoke.

761
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:40,524
I give you my word
as an officer and a gentleman.

762
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:42,603
Also a policeman.

763
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,602
Policeman.

764
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:48,073
- Jacques?
- Yes, darling.

765
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,508
Carry me.

766
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:52,807
All right, my darling.

767
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,144
- Jacques.
- Yes, my darling?

768
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:58,810
I swore I'd never...

769
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:03,248
- Sorry, my darling.
- I swore I'd never do it again.

770
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:06,850
- Yes, darling.
- And I resolved to be so strong.

771
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:08,327
Yes, darling.

772
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,763
We all pay for our sins.

773
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,926
Could you open the door,
my darling?

774
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:17,300
Anything worth waiting for
is worth...

775
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:23,407
Oh, darling.

776
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:32,514
My darling, my dear sweet darling.

777
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:37,555
My sweet darling, just let me...

778
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:45,625
Jacques, it may be
somebody important.

779
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,134
What could be
more important than this?

780
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:51,103
Lookwhat you're doing.
Look at my sleeve!

781
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,436
It's all right.
It looks better that way.

782
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:58,069
Go to the door.
Probably somebody important.

783
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:00,670
- Don't go away.
- Darling, hurry.

784
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,215
Hurry, yes.

785
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:38,351
Darling!

786
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:41,684
Coming, my lovely little darling.

787
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,758
That's very strange.

788
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:56,299
- Darling.
- My darling.

789
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:04,304
This is too much
for a simple policeman.

790
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:10,610
Wait.

791
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,883
Wait, my darling.

792
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:23,053
You beautiful, wonderful...

793
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:25,828
There's a little pin here.

794
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:39,111
What is it?

795
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:44,916
Kato!

796
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,287
Kato!

797
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,130
God!

798
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:07,231
Don't worry, my darling.
It's only Kato.

799
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,670
Poor fool.

800
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:37,736
I killed him.

801
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,774
Don't worry, you didn't.
He's all right, my darling.

802
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:44,367
Nothing can happen to us now.
Nothing can disturb us.

803
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:58,315
"Trail of death
follows Inspector Clouseau."

804
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,387
Four people.

805
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:07,059
The doorman, two customers,
and a Cossack.

806
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:09,903
Most regrettable.

807
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:11,897
Regrettable?

808
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:15,373
Including the Ballon murders,
this brings the total to eight!

809
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:19,610
That just goes to prove
what I have said all along.

810
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:26,113
What you have said all along
qualifies you as the greatest prophet

811
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:29,679
since General Custer said he was
going to surround all those Indians!

812
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,055
Maria Gambrelli did not kill
those four people.

813
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,958
- Which four people?
- The last four people.

814
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:37,827
Someone else killed those people.
I was with her all the time.

815
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:41,060
Whoever he is, he is the same man
who killed the first four people.

816
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:44,195
- A doorman, a Cossack?
- Innocent bystanders.

817
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,705
The murderer was after me.
Fortunately he missed.

818
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,867
"Fortunately" is not the word.

819
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,445
Nevertheless, it proves
that my theory is correct.

820
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:53,514
Because of some misguided loyalty,

821
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:55,981
Maria will not divulge the name
of her former love.

822
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,678
That man is so jealous,
he will kill rather than lose her.

823
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:02,222
Are you saying this man
Maria Gambrelli is protecting,

824
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:05,781
her former lover, killed eight people
because he was jealous?

825
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,259
Insanely jealous.

826
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:10,729
So jealous, he made it look like
Maria was the murderer?

827
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,823
He's a madman, a psychotic.

828
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,765
- What about the maid?
- The maid?

829
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:17,360
Was he jealous of her, too?
He strangled her.

830
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:20,635
It's possible his intended victim
was a man and he made a mistake.

831
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:23,233
- A mistake? In a nudist camp?
- Nobody's perfect.

832
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:26,780
Idiot! Nincompoop! Lunatic!

833
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:29,543
I will have your murderer
for you by tonight.

834
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:32,745
- What?
- I have a plan.

835
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,481
What sort of plan?

836
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:38,748
A plan that cannot possibly fail.

837
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:58,835
Now remember, at 8:00 sharp
you pull the master switch

838
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:01,040
just as I am about
to name the murderer.

839
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,810
I leave the lights off five seconds.

840
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:06,284
Just long enough
for the murderer to leave the room.

841
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,617
Understand?
You're quite clear?

842
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:10,816
Now we synchronize watches.

843
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:17,260
In seven seconds,
it will be precisely...

844
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:20,493
2:43.

845
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,098
2:43?

846
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:27,140
Your watch must've stopped.
I've 7:46.

847
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,506
Yes. 7:46, yes.

848
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:32,739
No. Now it's nearly 7:47.

849
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:34,280
All right, 7:47.

850
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:36,976
Are we synchronizing on 7:47?

851
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:39,883
- That's what you said.
- No, I said it was "nearly."

852
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:44,516
I've now ten seconds to 7:47.

853
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:47,390
- I've got ten seconds after 7:47.
- You'll have to put your watch back.

854
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:48,792
All right.

855
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:51,956
Five seconds... four...

856
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:55,524
three... two... one...

857
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:56,968
Now.

858
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:02,335
Strange.
The second hand is not moving.

859
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,910
- It's ticking.
- It's moving now.

860
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:09,108
What? Yes.
Yes, it is.

861
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:11,276
I know that.
I can see that it's moving now.

862
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:14,514
Now I've 7:47 and 23 seconds.

863
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:18,524
Let's synchronize on 7:47 and a half.

864
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:22,494
Five... four... three...

865
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:25,157
two... one...

866
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,667
Now.

867
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:30,067
- My watch has stopped.
- Your watch?

868
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:33,237
Remarkable coincidence.
It stopped completely.

869
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:39,874
- Look, take my watch.
- But what about you?

870
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,472
Don't worry. I'll keep talking
till the lights go out.

871
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:45,575
- But we won't be synchronized.
- It will be all right.

872
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:47,621
I'll find a way.
Don't worry.

873
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:15,275
Very kind of you.

874
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:18,181
There's no need for you to stand.
Please sit down.

875
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:24,522
Now then, I expect you're wondering
why I've asked you all here.

876
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,957
Whatever the reason,
it's a damn nuisance.

877
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:30,497
We usually have dinner at 9:00.
You've stopped everything.

878
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:34,261
You will not be inconvenienced
for long, Monsieur Ballon.

879
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,804
Your clock has stopped,
Monsieur Ballon.

880
01:29:45,913 --> 01:29:49,542
Yes, but if you want to know
the time, it is exactly 7:50.

881
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:52,118
You are slow. It's 7:52.

882
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,085
No, my love.

883
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:57,487
This watch has not lost a second
since the day you gave it to me.

884
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,719
I didn't give it to you.

885
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:04,864
I have 7:55, monsieur.

886
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:07,560
- That is what I have.
- You're both fast.

887
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:10,432
No. My watch is right.
I'll prove it to you.

888
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:17,440
Would you tell me
the right time, please?

889
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:19,875
7:54. Thank you.

890
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:24,983
Yes?

891
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,576
It's for you, Inspector.

892
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:29,386
It's for me.

893
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:35,953
Yes?

894
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:38,855
- What time is it?
- What?

895
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,299
Your watch has stopped.

896
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:44,698
Where are you?

897
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:48,298
I'm in the basement.
I had the operator call this number.

898
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:51,742
I can't pull the switch at 8:00
if I don't know what time it is.

899
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:54,508
It's 7:54.

900
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:57,209
- 7:55 now.
- 7:55 now, yes.

901
01:30:57,318 --> 01:31:01,220
I just realized something.
I still won't know when it's 8:00.

902
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:03,950
- Count.
- What?

903
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:06,584
Count.

904
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:09,356
Count. You mean seconds?

905
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:13,491
Yes, that is exactly what I mean.
Don't dare call me here again.

906
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:18,265
Now then...

907
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:43,522
Now then, I will tellyou

908
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:47,533
why I have called you
all here tonight.

909
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:52,163
One of you is a murderer.

910
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:03,747
36, 37...

911
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,978
38, 39...

912
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:09,419
Before I name the killer...

913
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:13,520
...I will explain to you the facts

914
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:16,620
that led me to discover his...

915
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:20,599
or her... identity.

916
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:39,712
Now then, the night...

917
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,995
The night the chauffeur was killed...
What was the chauffeur's name?

918
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:50,461
- Miguel.
- "Miguel,"yes.

919
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,123
- Miguel.
- "Miguel."

920
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,461
Miguel!

921
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:56,901
- Well, this Italian...
- He was a Spaniard.

922
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:01,432
This Spaniard, "Manguel,"

923
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:03,840
he was furious with Maria Gambrelli.

924
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:07,176
He tore her dress off.
He protested violently.

925
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:09,676
My foot!

926
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:11,615
I'm terribly sorry.
I beg your pardon.

927
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:14,051
I did not notice.
Excuse me.

928
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:16,188
He tore her dress off.

929
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:19,020
And at that precise moment,

930
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:21,219
the door opened...

931
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:24,765
and somebody shot him.

932
01:33:24,865 --> 01:33:28,926
Maria could not see who the killer
was because she was unconscious.

933
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:33,439
The reason was that she had
received a bump upon the head.

934
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:34,838
Awhat?

935
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:36,942
A bump.

936
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:41,611
There is only one way she could
have received a bump like that.

937
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:44,241
She was hit upon the head
by an object.

938
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:47,617
The object was the knob
on the closet door.

939
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:50,953
Somebody was hiding in that closet.

940
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:55,017
When they opened the door,
she received a bump upon the head.

941
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:57,597
For heaven's sake,
come to the point.

942
01:33:57,698 --> 01:33:59,495
Don't tangle with...

943
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,660
- You clumsy idiot!
- I'm terribly sorry.

944
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:11,309
I'm coming, Maria, my darling.

945
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:12,811
My darling...

946
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:19,985
Careful, monsieur, with me.

947
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:23,454
Do not tangle with me.
I am a trained expert in karate.

948
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:26,082
My hands are lethalweapons.

949
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:32,927
Now then...

950
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:38,037
There is something
I am interested to know.

951
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:39,970
This room looks...

952
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:41,837
What happened?

953
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:44,467
You fell off the sofa, you stupid...

954
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:47,809
I know I fell off the sofa.
There's no need to tell me.

955
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:50,975
Everything I do
is carefully planned, madame.

956
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:52,518
I know that.

957
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:54,778
Now then...

958
01:34:57,391 --> 01:34:58,756
What was I saying?

959
01:35:00,828 --> 01:35:04,355
Listen, you daydreaming fool,
what are you doing?

960
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:06,558
Can't you pay attention
when I'm talking?

961
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:08,601
You're not listening to me.

962
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:11,536
With the greatest respect,
I heard every word you said.

963
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:14,199
Would you tell me
what it was that I said?

964
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:17,709
- You were talking about the closet.
- Yes?

965
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:21,714
When the closet door opened,
Maria received a bump on the head.

966
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:26,549
From that you inferred someone
had been hiding in the closet.

967
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:30,818
Listen, next time I may test you
without warning.

968
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:33,257
So pay attention at all times!

969
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,691
Yes, monsieur.

970
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:38,424
Now then,
whoever was in that closet

971
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:41,763
opened the door
and knocked Maria unconscious.

972
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:45,230
Whoever the man was
that was in that closet

973
01:35:45,339 --> 01:35:47,170
had a reason to be in that closet.

974
01:35:47,274 --> 01:35:52,371
- How do you know it was a man?
- Because we found his fingerprints.

975
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,541
And they were your fingerprints.

976
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:59,414
Why not? It's my house.
I've often been in that closet.

977
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,954
- For what reason?
- Last time was moths.

978
01:36:02,056 --> 01:36:03,045
"Muths?"

979
01:36:03,157 --> 01:36:04,988
- Moths.
- Yes, "muths."

980
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,356
Maria was complaining of moths.

981
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:12,626
Is that right, Maria, that you were complaining about
"muths"?

982
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:15,327
Yes, I did complain about moths.

983
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:18,837
You mean moths!
The flying moths.

984
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,600
Yes, of course.

985
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:24,940
But what I do not understand is
that in a household of this size

986
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:28,481
that moths should be brought to
the attention of Monsieur Ballon,

987
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:31,608
not one of the servants
or the local moth exterminator.

988
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:34,313
However, for the moment
we will pass over that

989
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:38,118
and we will continue to concentrate
on another type of...

990
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:41,126
local exterminator.

991
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:13,049
212, 213, 214...

992
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:17,221
Maria Gambrelli, even though
she now realizes it was a mistake,

993
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,822
is not the sort of woman
to have an affair with a man

994
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:21,993
and then expose him.

995
01:37:22,102 --> 01:37:23,467
We cannot condemn her,

996
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:25,937
because she does not believe
this man was a killer.

997
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:31,578
But this man was not only a killer,
he was an unprincipled villain

998
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:34,341
who would rather see Maria
go to the guillotine

999
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:36,005
than lose her to another man.

1000
01:37:36,116 --> 01:37:39,711
He was in the closet when she came
into the room with the Spaniard.

1001
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,789
He shot the Spaniard
and put the gun in Maria's hand.

1002
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:45,017
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1003
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:47,355
Benjamin, shut up!

1004
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:51,961
- You have something to say?
- He has nothing to say.

1005
01:37:52,066 --> 01:37:54,534
No, but she has.
Why don't you ask her?

1006
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:55,795
How dare you!

1007
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:58,596
She was having an affair
with my husband.

1008
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,936
- Liar!
- You are a fine one to talk!

1009
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:03,805
Your husband was having an affair
with my wife!

1010
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:06,471
What about you and Simone?

1011
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:08,377
- What about you and Georges?
- Liar!

1012
01:38:08,482 --> 01:38:11,417
You killed him. I saw you go
to the greenhouse just before Maria.

1013
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:15,215
- Why should I kill Georges?
- You were having an affair with him.

1014
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:18,553
- I should kill him for that?
- He was carrying on with her.

1015
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:20,854
- I saw you kill Dudu.
- Liar!

1016
01:38:20,961 --> 01:38:23,896
- I saw you!
- Why should I kill Dudu?

1017
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:28,332
Because you discovered
she was having an affair with Pierre.

1018
01:38:28,435 --> 01:38:30,062
- That's not true.
- She told me.

1019
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:34,402
She told you because you and Dudu
were blackmailing the madame.

1020
01:38:34,508 --> 01:38:37,739
- She saw Madame kill Miguel.
- Shut up!

1021
01:38:37,945 --> 01:38:38,969
What?

1022
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:42,981
Georges saw Ballon climbing out
of Maria's window after the shooting.

1023
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:45,745
I didn't kill him.
I was the one in the closet.

1024
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:49,254
My wife expected to find me with
Maria, and shot Miguel by accident.

1025
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:50,880
I put the gun in Maria's hand.

1026
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:52,925
I arrest you for putting
the gun in Maria's hand.

1027
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:54,119
Keep out of this.

1028
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:57,220
You pompous ass.
What about Henri?

1029
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:59,094
- What about Henri?
- You killed him.

1030
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,963
- Why should I kill him?
- Shut up!

1031
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:04,765
I saw you drag his body
into Maria's room.

1032
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:06,772
- It was you?
- Yes, it was.

1033
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:21,581
298, 299...

1034
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:26,623
Turn on the lights.

1035
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:35,725
Let me in!

1036
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:40,506
No!

1037
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:46,336
Stop! Come back, you fools!
Come back.

1038
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:48,438
Clouseau, stop them.

1039
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:51,313
- Stop them. The bomb.
- The what?

1040
01:39:54,788 --> 01:39:56,187
The bomb?

1041
01:39:58,092 --> 01:39:59,923
It was meant for you.

1042
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:02,359
What do you mean
it was meant for me?

1043
01:40:02,463 --> 01:40:05,296
A doorman, two customers,
and a Cossack.

1044
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:08,493
And now, six more innocent people.

1045
01:40:08,602 --> 01:40:11,969
They were all murderers except
Maurice, who was a blackmailer.

1046
01:40:12,072 --> 01:40:14,404
Compared with you,
they were all saints.

1047
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:16,738
Commissioner, what are you doing?

1048
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:19,312
- I hate you, Clouseau.
- Commissioner, please.

1049
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:22,246
- I hate you.
- What are you doing to me?

1050
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:26,149
Let go of me.
Commissioner, let go of my leg.

1051
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:28,816
Hercule!

1052
01:40:29,623 --> 01:40:32,023
- Get him off me.
- Commissioner...

1053
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:37,391
Commissioner!

1054
01:40:52,846 --> 01:40:53,972
Jacques.

1055
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:59,010
Jacques, are you all right?

1056
01:41:00,087 --> 01:41:02,783
It's all over now, darling.

1057
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:04,821
You're free.
