1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:08,233
Captain!

3
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:16,191
- Eddie, my briefcase?
- Here.

4
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:18,033
Hang on to it.

5
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:34,027
All right, already. Come on, come on.

6
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:44,030
This way, Mr. Brock.

7
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:02,665
Mr. Brock, welcome to
the Washington Statler. Your wing...

8
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,470
- I ain't got a whole floor?
- You've got an entire wing.

9
00:02:06,715 --> 00:02:10,230
I don't want one wing.
I want the whole bird.

10
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:15,225
- Your private elevator.
- Private? That's more like it.

11
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:17,387
- Hello.
- How are you?

12
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,584
Mr. Brock...

13
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:22,231
I thought you said this
was private. Take off.

14
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,547
You should be satisfied.

15
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,344
The public corridor and elevators...

16
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:33,468
- West, East and South Suite.
- Which one's mine?

17
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:36,826
The South Suite.
Each a private apartment.

18
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:42,831
Sleeping quarters upstairs,
terrace overlooks Washington.

19
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:45,754
- I'd like to point out...
- It's all right.

20
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:49,067
I'd like to point out
that this suite...

21
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:58,743
This suite is usually reserved
for foreign diplomats.

22
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:02,630
Oh, I almost forgot.
We thought you'd like this.

23
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:06,225
- Compliments of the management.
- Okay. Don't bother me.

24
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,427
May I?

25
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:16,624
May I show you the rest
of the accommodations?

26
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,434
Hey, Billie!

27
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:33,784
- What?
- Not bad, huh?

28
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:38,307
- It's all right.
- You know what this place costs a day?

29
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:41,234
Four hundred, you told me.

30
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:53,864
- Mrs. Brock seems delighted.
- It's not " Mrs. Brock."

31
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,953
Ain't no Mrs. Brock except my mother.
She's dead.

32
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,184
I see.

33
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:01,831
- Now look, don't get nosy.
- Oh, not at all.

34
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:07,827
She's a fiancÃ©e. Mine, in fact.
Eddie, take care of him.

35
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,068
Pardon me, sir.

36
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:14,107
- Thank you, Mr. Brock.
- Okay. Don't bother me.

37
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,228
How's the monarch of all he surveys?

38
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:20,313
- You plastered again?
- Still. Welcome.

39
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:22,432
I got things that can't wait.

40
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:25,672
- I got this ticket to get fixed.
- What about?

41
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,673
Some louse, just as we blew into town.

42
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:32,703
- I'm a lawyer, I don't own the law.
- What'd I do?

43
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:35,071
I'll see what I can manage.

44
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,904
- How'd we do?
- May cost a shade more.

45
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,713
- How much?
- It's negligible.

46
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:42,065
- Why more?
- Supply and demand, Harry.

47
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,273
Crooks are rare in these parts.
Don't worry.

48
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:48,114
Don't worry?
This stuff ain't deductible.

49
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:52,308
I'm not so sure.
"Item: One bribe, $80,000."

50
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:55,188
Eighty! You're very handy
with my dough!

51
00:04:55,715 --> 00:05:00,664
Fellow's coming up here any minute
to interview you. Paul Verrall.

52
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,070
Freelance snoop. Political stuff.

53
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:06,506
I don't wanna talk to no writer.
Eddie!

54
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:09,024
- You better talk to this one.
- Why?

55
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:14,434
He's one to look out for.
Take him in, then he won't go poking.

56
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:17,433
What's so important?

57
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:20,065
What we're after is important.

58
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:24,069
Listen, to get by in this town
takes power. You got some.

59
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,106
Takes money. You got plenty.

60
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,864
But above all, it takes
judgement and intelligence.

61
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:33,272
That's why you pay me
100,000 a year.

62
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:38,665
- What's all the excitement?
- Just making it clear where I fit in.

63
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,673
- Eddie, get me a shave up here.
- Right.

64
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,069
- Harry.
- What?

65
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:44,304
Barber shop!

66
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:47,985
Tell Billie to wear something plain
for the congressman.

67
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:50,874
Tell her yourself. You ain't pregnant.

68
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:53,675
Send up a barber
and a manicure right now.

69
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,185
Harry Brock! That's right.
Okay, make it snappy.

70
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:59,909
- And a shine!
- And a shine! Be right up.

71
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:05,183
Look, don't you worry about Billie.
One thing, she knows how to dress.

72
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:06,954
Probably Verrall.

73
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,587
- Hello, Paul.
- Hello, Jim.

74
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,314
Harry Brock, Paul Verrall.

75
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,227
- How do you do?
- How are you?

76
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:17,791
- Ain't I seen you before?
- I'll leave you.

77
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,587
What'll you drink?

78
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,355
- Scotch, if you got it.
- If I got it? Eddie.

79
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:24,307
Where do you think you are?

80
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:27,115
Where you been?
Get him a Scotch and...

81
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,504
- Soda?
- Water.

82
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,714
- Rye ginger ale for you?
- Right. He knows.

83
00:06:32,915 --> 00:06:36,954
Worked for me many years.
He's my cousin. He knows me.

84
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:39,623
- Right.
- Maybe I'll interview Eddie.

85
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:43,714
Pretty good. Maybe you
got something there. Sit down.

86
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:47,430
What's it gonna be, pal?
A plug or a pan?

87
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:50,103
I know how to talk
if I know your angle.

88
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:52,789
- No angle, just facts.
- A pan?

89
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,509
- Not exactly.
- Write whatever you want.

90
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:57,393
Come up. I wanna get shaved.

91
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:02,226
Nobody can hurt me.
I'm only talking because Jim asked me.

92
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:06,269
Pay him 100 grand for advice,
I'm a sucker not to take it.

93
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:09,632
- That's right.
- Butt out, will you?

94
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:13,114
Devery likes it
when I get wrote about.

95
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:16,984
- What do you wanna know?
- How much money you got?

96
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:18,184
What?

97
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:21,228
- How much money?
- What am I, an accountant?

98
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,306
- You don't know?
- Not exactly.

99
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:25,625
- Fifty million?
- I don't know.

100
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,228
- Ten million?
- Maybe.

101
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:28,874
- One million?
- More.

102
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,787
- How much more?
- Plenty.

103
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:35,831
- I made every nickel of it.
- Nice work.

104
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:39,664
You're gonna give me the business.
That's all right.

105
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,833
- You got me all...
- Tell how I'm a roughneck.

106
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:45,430
Everybody's scared.
For me, that's good.

107
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:47,074
Well, not everybody.

108
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:51,274
Enough. You can't hurt me.
All you can do is build me up.

109
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:54,871
- Hey, Eddie. Have a drink.
- No, thanks, really.

110
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:58,432
Do what I tell you.
Who pays you around here?

111
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:03,828
At home, he shaves me.
I got my own barber chair, right?

112
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:05,434
That's right.

113
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:09,870
- Go ahead, pal. Interview me.
- Where were you born?

114
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:15,103
Plainfield, New Jersey. 1907. I went
to work when I was 12 years old.

115
00:08:15,315 --> 00:08:19,831
I been working ever since.
My first job was a paper route.

116
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,464
I bought a kid out with a swift kick.

117
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,905
And you've been
working ever since.

118
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:29,825
Tell you how I'm top man in my racket.
Been in it 25 years.

119
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:33,266
- Steel.
- Not steel, junk.

120
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:37,554
- And I ain't ashamed to admit it.
- All right.

121
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:40,588
Here's some advice:
Never bull a bull artist.

122
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:43,867
I can sling it with the best of them.

123
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:48,313
- For 25 years, you say?
- Yeah. I'm a kid with a paper route.

124
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:52,110
I got a wagon. Going home,
I pick up junk in alleys.

125
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:55,432
I'm not the only one.
Other kids do it too.

126
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,911
Difference is, they keep it.
Not me. I sell it.

127
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:03,114
I'm making eight dollars in junk
and three from papers.

128
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:07,314
I see which is the right racket.
I'm a kid, but I see that.

129
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:10,786
Soon the guy I sell to
is handing me 20 a week.

130
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:15,069
Then he turns around,
offers me a job for 10. Dumb jerk.

131
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:18,273
I'd sell him his own stuff
and he never knew.

132
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:20,506
- How do you mean?
- Look...

133
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:24,151
In the night,
I drag it out, I load it up.

134
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,427
In the morning I go in
the front and collect.

135
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:30,473
- Twelve years old?
- Something like that.

136
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:33,349
- Pretty soon you own the yard.
- Right.

137
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:36,911
The jerk works for me now.
Know who else does?

138
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:42,235
The kid whose paper route I swiped.
I figure I owe him.

139
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:46,233
Good last few years
for the junk business.

140
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:50,826
- I ain't kicking.
- Do you anticipate any decline now?

141
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:54,147
- Talk plain.
- Is it still going to be good?

142
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:55,868
- We'll make it good.
- Who?

143
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:57,588
- Me, that's who.
- I see.

144
00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:00,150
- Fancy talk don't go with me.
- Come in.

145
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:03,024
- Good evening.
- Hello.

146
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:06,309
- I'll get out...
- No, don't go. I like you.

147
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:10,104
Play your cards right,
I'll put you on the payroll.

148
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:15,224
Once over light, no talk.
I get a manicure every day.

149
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:18,624
Over there someplace.

150
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:22,425
Okay, fellow, go ahead.

151
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:25,672
I wonder what you're doing
in Washington.

152
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,912
What are you, a wonder boy?
Not so tight.

153
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,908
Sightseeing, that's what I'm doing.

154
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,709
Some talk you've come
to find out...

155
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:37,713
So far I've been nice to you.
Don't pump me.

156
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:42,267
How's it going? How are you getting
on with King Junk?

157
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,229
He was born in New Jersey.
Sure is a tough man to dig.

158
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:49,552
I can't believe that.
He loves to talk. Billie!

159
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:51,950
This is Paul Verrall.
Billie Dawn.

160
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:53,184
How do you do?

161
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:57,351
- Wait.
- What's the matter?

162
00:10:57,755 --> 00:11:00,588
Where you going? Put it back!

163
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:03,025
- I just wanted...
- Put it back!

164
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,714
- Why...?
- Because I say.

165
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,708
Somebody's coming.
I don't want you stinking.

166
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:12,631
- Can't I just...?
- Go change. Don't give me no trouble!

167
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:15,232
Do what I'm telling you!

168
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:30,430
Barber, what'll you take
to cut his throat?

169
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,034
Some jokes I don't like.

170
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,625
- Don't get excited.
- Don't tell me what to do!

171
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:41,714
- Just a joke, Harry.
- That's all. I said beat it.

172
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:43,308
Eddie, take care of them.

173
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:45,705
- I'll be going too.
- No, don't.

174
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:47,906
You're the only friend
I got left.

175
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:52,148
I live around the corner.
If anybody beats you, scream.

176
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:53,708
I'll come running.

177
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:56,469
- Goodbye, Jim. Thanks.
- Goodbye.

178
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:00,510
I need Billie's signature.

179
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:03,832
Sure. Billie!

180
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:08,664
- You sore?
- Not sore, Harry.

181
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:12,273
- You look funny.
- I know.

182
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:17,188
- You want an aspirin?
- No, no, I'm fine.

183
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:20,667
Considering I've been dead
for 16 years...

184
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,628
...l'm in remarkable health.

185
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:32,874
- Billie!
- What?

186
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:34,827
Billie!

187
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:40,073
- What?
- Come over here right away!

188
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:43,268
Honey, would you please
fix the safety catch?

189
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:46,512
- He sure got good lungs.
- Yeah. Thanks.

190
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:50,270
There's a shortcut through
the service. This way.

191
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,072
- That's the door, honey.
- Thanks, honey.

192
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:08,430
Sometime I don't understand you.

193
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:11,229
- Sometime?
- What do you want?

194
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:12,424
Jim.

195
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:15,308
Few things I want you to sign, honey.

196
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:19,827
- That's all I do around here.
- Too bad about you.

197
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:22,708
- When's this congressman coming?
- Anytime.

198
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:24,911
I better get fixed up, huh?

199
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:27,669
- She look all right?
- Look who's talking.

200
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,834
You tell me. I don't wanna start off
on no left foot.

201
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:36,307
What got into him?

202
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,313
Nothing. Wants to make
a good impression.

203
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:41,068
So let him.

204
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,912
Two places on this one, please.

205
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:49,107
What happened to all that stuff
I signed last week?

206
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:50,868
All used up.

207
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:54,428
I must've signed
about a million of these.

208
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,865
What you get as corporate officer.

209
00:13:57,075 --> 00:14:00,067
I am? What do you know?

210
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,230
Come a long way from the chorus.

211
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:06,507
I wasn't only in the chorus.
I spoke lines.

212
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:09,064
- Really?
- Of course.

213
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:12,714
- How many?
- How many what?

214
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:15,349
- Lines did you speak?
- Five.

215
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:18,504
- I never knew that.
- Ask anybody.

216
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:20,273
I believe you.

217
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:24,910
I could've been a star
if I'd have stuck to it.

218
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:29,108
- Why didn't you?
- Harry didn't want me in the show.

219
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:33,064
He didn't wanna share me
with the general public.

220
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:34,628
I see.

221
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:40,267
Harry's changed. Don't you think so?

222
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:44,025
- How?
- He used to be more satisfied.

223
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,510
Now he's always
running around like this.

224
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,315
What'd he have to come
to Washington for?

225
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,309
- Long story.
- Well, don't tell it to me.

226
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:58,106
- I just wish he'd settle down.
- He's ambitious.

227
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,432
He talks all the time now.
He never used to.

228
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:06,504
Now he always tells me how
he's gonna be bigger, run everything.

229
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:12,034
- He may, at that.
- I don't care one way or the other.

230
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,548
- Take it easy.
- Now don't you start!

231
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:19,144
Better to drink after they're gone.

232
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:21,630
- This congressman?
- And Mrs. Hedges.

233
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:24,668
- This fella works for him.
- In a way.

234
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,264
So what's he putting it on for?

235
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,311
Just be nice. No rough language.

236
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,706
- I won't open my mush.
- I didn't mean that.

237
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:38,233
I don't have to be down here.
I could go back to my place.

238
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:40,824
In fact, I think I will.

239
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:45,426
- I tell you, Harry wouldn't like it.
- All right, all right!

240
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:56,425
How are you, Norval?
Haven't seen you in ages, Anna.

241
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:58,108
- You haven't.
- Come in.

242
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:02,906
You remember this little lady.
She used to be Billie Dawn.

243
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:05,111
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

244
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:07,915
This is Mr. Hedges
I've told you about.

245
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:09,707
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

246
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:13,311
- And this is Mrs. Hedges.
- Glad to meet you.

247
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,426
Glad to meet you.

248
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:24,027
- How about the terrace?
- That'd be nice.

249
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:25,304
- A drink?
- Love one.

250
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:27,307
- Sounds all right.
- Scotch?

251
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,864
- Scotch all around, Eddie.
- Right.

252
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:36,710
He's awfully tired.

253
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:41,631
- Stand over a hot resolution all day?
- Just about.

254
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:55,467
How do you like Washington,
Mrs. Brock?

255
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:07,265
- I haven't seen it yet.
- This is the first time you've been?

256
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:11,070
That's what I mean.
I never went on the road.

257
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:15,109
Well, we must show you around.
Beautiful city.

258
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:18,904
Too bad the Supreme Court
isn't in session.

259
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:20,668
What is it?

260
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:28,069
Lots of people'd
like to know that.

261
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,630
- Hello.
- Mr. Hedges, Harry Brock.

262
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:32,791
It's about time we got together.

263
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:35,668
Mrs. Hedges, I'm happy to meet you.

264
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,673
- Thank you.
- Sit down. Congressman.

265
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,915
- Have a good trip?
- I come in my car.

266
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:52,307
Stopped in Baltimore.
I got a junkyard there, second one.

267
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:55,672
- Before, I only had one.
- How many do you have?

268
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,945
I couldn't answer that, baby.

269
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:01,711
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

270
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:06,073
I don't know why I like Baltimore.
I get a feeling from it.

271
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:08,914
- Sentimental.
- Yes, I'm sentimental.

272
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:12,630
I think we're all a bit sentimental.

273
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:16,625
Well, it's a free country.

274
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:26,067
- Do you play bridge, Mrs. Brock?
- No, only gin.

275
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:28,432
- I beg your pardon?
- Gin rummy.

276
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:30,466
Oh, yes, of course.

277
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:34,913
I was going to ask you to join us.
A few of the girls meet.

278
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,549
I don't play bridge.

279
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:40,673
- You could learn!
- I don't think so.

280
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:45,227
She couldn't play till I learned her.
Now she beats my brains out.

281
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:49,867
How're you fixed for time tomorrow?

282
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:52,464
- Ten o'clock?
- Pretty early for me.

283
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,631
I'll say.

284
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:58,346
- Eleven?
- Okay.

285
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:02,225
- I can drop by here.
- Sure, it's on your way.

286
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:06,428
We can discuss the operation
and get a head start.

287
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:13,225
Wanna wash your hands
or anything, honey?

288
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,913
<i>No, thank you.</i>

289
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:21,348
I hope you're free
for Friday night dinner.

290
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:24,865
- People I want Harry to meet.
- Who wanna meet him.

291
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:29,114
- Thank you for everything, Mr. Brock.
- Call me Harry.

292
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:32,506
I haven't written you...
You understand.

293
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:35,309
You know I'm interested
in scrap iron.

294
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:39,309
I wanna sell it and not get stuck
with falling prices.

295
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:43,514
- I have a copy...
- Boil it down and give it to me.

296
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:48,027
I didn't come here to do paperwork.
The way I work is this:

297
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:50,988
Get the other guy
before he gets you.

298
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:57,310
I got in mind a worldwide
operating combo. Enough for everybody.

299
00:19:57,515 --> 00:20:01,827
Up till now, everybody's lined up
and understands everybody.

300
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,630
- I wanna move.
- You understand that legislation...

301
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:10,909
That's a lot of hot air.
I ain't talking about peanuts...

302
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:15,073
Give them enough rope. I've said so.

303
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:22,349
The trouble with these do-gooders is...

304
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,628
They never seem to know when to stop.
I've said...

305
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:31,664
We can do this.
It's up to you to find out how.

306
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:34,304
One amendment, for example...

307
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:38,707
...guarantees government support
of scrap iron price levels.

308
00:20:38,955 --> 00:20:40,673
We want to get it through.

309
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,993
See that you do. I'm here
to see that I get what I paid for.

310
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:48,307
- How do things look to you?
- Generally?

311
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:53,908
This country has to decide if
the people will run the government...

312
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:56,345
...or the other way around.

313
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,113
That's sound thinking.

314
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,073
- Thank you.
- Worthy of Holmes.

315
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:01,913
Great man, Holmes.

316
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:05,306
- My personal god.
- Who?

317
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:09,430
- Oliver Wendell Holmes.
- A wonderful man.

318
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,905
He gonna be here Friday night?

319
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:14,715
- I don't think so.
- Too bad.

320
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:17,349
- We mustn't keep you.
- We mustn't.

321
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:19,511
- Good night.
- Good night.

322
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:22,872
- Good night. See you tomorrow.
- That's right.

323
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:26,067
- Good night, Anna.
- Thank you so much.

324
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:30,063
Wait a while. I'll give you
something to thank me for.

325
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:32,508
Good night, all.

326
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:51,948
Drips.

327
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:54,305
- They're drips.
- Who are you to say?

328
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:57,507
- I'm myself.
- Nobody asked you. Shut up.

329
00:21:57,755 --> 00:22:01,350
- Pardon me for living.
- Get lost.

330
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:04,268
- Not yet.
- Get lost, I told you.

331
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:20,113
- She'll be in the way.
- What are you gonna do?

332
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,313
- I'd like to give her the brush.
- Complicated.

333
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:26,666
- I know.
- She owns more of you than you do.

334
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:31,426
She's gonna louse me up down the line.
Dumb broad.

335
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:33,109
You may be right.

336
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:36,074
- Listen, Harry. Send her home.
- No.

337
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:37,754
Why not?

338
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:43,711
- I'm nuts for her.
- Can't have your cake and eat it.

339
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:45,143
Just a saying.

340
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:48,631
- That don't make any sense.
- All right.

341
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:56,034
- What's cake got to do with it?
- Nothing, Harry.

342
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:59,113
- Must be a way to smarten her up.
- I guess so.

343
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:01,915
- Some kind of school?
- I doubt that.

344
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:03,269
Then what?

345
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:06,905
We might find someone
to smooth the rough edges.

346
00:23:07,115 --> 00:23:09,675
- How?
- Let me think about it.

347
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:14,503
I want you to think about something.
About marrying her.

348
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:17,070
Why marriage all of a sudden?

349
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:20,665
A wife couldn't testify
against her husband.

350
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,231
You've been engaged for seven years.
Why wait?

351
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,153
I didn't wanna be rushed.

352
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:29,745
We get married,
she'll think she's got it coming.

353
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:32,025
- She's different.
- A broad's a broad.

354
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:34,624
- You'll be sorry.
- I'll let you know.

355
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,469
We still gotta do something about her.

356
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:42,066
She opens her kisser,
something wrong come out. Talk to her.

357
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:44,425
- Take more than a talk.
- Then what?

358
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:47,627
It's not easy to make a person over.

359
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:51,714
Wait. That interview guy.
He's a smart cookie.

360
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:53,109
Paul Verrall.

361
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,704
He knows this town. He's classy.

362
00:23:55,955 --> 00:23:57,707
- But he won't do it.
- Why?

363
00:23:57,955 --> 00:24:01,072
- I'll pay him what he wants.
- I don't think so.

364
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,391
I bet you. What's his number?

365
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:07,469
- I'm not sure...
- What's his number? Come on.

366
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:11,350
- You ate already?
- Yeah.

367
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:13,313
- Piece of pie?
- No.

368
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:16,069
- Sit. How about a drink?
- No, thanks.

369
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:24,113
Okay, pal.

370
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:27,267
- I wanna ask you something.
- Sure.

371
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:30,273
- How much you make?
- Am I an accountant?

372
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:33,512
- I love this guy. Your name again?
- Verrall.

373
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,507
- Your regular name.
- Paul.

374
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:40,709
I got a friend, a good kid...
Maybe you seen her around. Billie?

375
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:43,469
She's a little on the stupid side.

376
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:45,905
I got her out of the chorus.

377
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:50,825
She'll be unhappy here,
never been with such kind of people.

378
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:52,753
- Know what I mean?
- I don't.

379
00:24:52,995 --> 00:24:56,271
- You could help her out. Me too.
- How?

380
00:24:56,475 --> 00:25:01,105
Explain things to her in your
spare time. What do you say?

381
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:05,746
- I don't think I could handle it.
- Mean an awful lot to me.

382
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:09,348
I'll give you 200 bucks a week.

383
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:14,675
- I'll do it.
- I love this guy.

384
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,513
- When do I start?
- Now.

385
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:21,743
Come with me and I'll introduce you.
You can take it from there.

386
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,463
Billie!

387
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:32,350
- What?!
- Come down here a minute. Come on in.

388
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:35,155
She's a nice kid.
You're gonna like her.

389
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:40,753
- I'm getting dressed.
- He's a friend of the family.

390
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:43,344
Come on, I'm telling you!

391
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:48,992
- This is Paul Verrall.
- I know.

392
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:50,793
He wants to talk to you.

393
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:52,951
- What about?
- You'll find out.

394
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:57,353
Jim and I got work to do.
I'll have to leave you two.

395
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:12,752
Your friend, Mr. Brock, has an idea.

396
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:15,987
He'd like us to spend
a little time together.

397
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:17,793
You and me, that is.

398
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,991
- You don't say.
- Yes.

399
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:23,392
- What are you, a gigolo?
- Not exactly.

400
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:26,985
- So what's the idea?
- Well, it's nothing special.

401
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:31,711
He'd like me to put you wise
to a few things, show you the ropes.

402
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:34,349
- Answer any questions.
- I got none.

403
00:26:34,555 --> 00:26:37,547
- I'll give you some.
- Thanks.

404
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:41,985
It might be fun for you.
There's a lot to see here.

405
00:26:42,195 --> 00:26:44,186
I'd be glad to show you around.

406
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,585
- You know the Supreme Court?
- Yes.

407
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:49,389
- I'd like to take that in.
- Fine.

408
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:51,785
- We're on, then?
- How you mean?

409
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,149
The arrangement.

410
00:26:53,315 --> 00:26:56,990
- I don't mind. Got nothing to do.
- Good.

411
00:26:57,235 --> 00:26:59,988
- What's he paying you?
- Two hundred.

412
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:02,954
You could've got more.
He's got plenty.

413
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,305
Oh, I'd have done it for free.

414
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:06,914
- I would.
- Why?

415
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:09,948
This isn't work. I like it.

416
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,709
- He thinks I'm too stupid, huh?
- No.

417
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:15,383
He's right. I'm stupid and I like it.

418
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,354
- You do?
- Sure.

419
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:21,753
I got everything I want.
Two mink coats, everything.

420
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:24,788
If there's something I want, I ask.

421
00:27:24,995 --> 00:27:27,555
And if he don't act friendly...

422
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,545
...I don't act friendly.

423
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:36,514
As long as I know how to get
what I want, that's all.

424
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:39,707
- As long as you know what you want.
- Sure.

425
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:43,510
- What?
- As long as you know what you want.

426
00:27:43,755 --> 00:27:47,464
- Are you trying to mix me up?
- Well, no.

427
00:27:51,995 --> 00:27:54,907
- I'll tell you what I would like.
- Yes?

428
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:58,425
- I'd like to learn how to talk good.
- All right.

429
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:01,110
- Is it hard?
- I don't think so.

430
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:03,112
What do I have to do?

431
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,546
I might give you
a few books to start with.

432
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:10,191
Every now and then I'll correct you.

433
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:12,995
- Go ahead.
- Well, that is, when I know.

434
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:15,789
- I don't talk so good myself.
- You'll do.

435
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,873
- Good.
- I never say "ain't." Did you notice?

436
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:21,669
- Oh, I do.
- I'll correct you then.

437
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:25,352
- Do that.
- Since I was small I never say it.

438
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:28,109
Our teacher used to slug you
if you did.

439
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,112
- Did what?
- Said "ain't."

440
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:33,751
- I got out of the habit.
- Was it worth the slugging?

441
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,064
Oh, not hard.

442
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:38,790
There's too much slugging.
I don't believe in it.

443
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:41,344
- I don't believe in it either.
- Good.

444
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:44,194
- I learn fast.
- You're great, Miss Dawn.

445
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:47,347
- Billie.
- Billie. An odd name, isn't it?

446
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:49,910
Half the kids I know are named it.

447
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:53,903
- Anyway, it isn't my real name.
- Oh? What is?

448
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:56,629
Holy cats. Emma.

449
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,550
- What's the matter?
- Do I look to you like an Emma?

450
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:03,992
No. You don't look
like a Billie either.

451
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:05,988
What do I look like?

452
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:08,351
- To me?
- Yeah, you.

453
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:12,354
You look like a lovely girl.

454
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,346
Let me ask you...

455
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:25,351
Are you one of these talkers, or would
you be interested in a little action?

456
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:29,588
- What?
- I got a yen for you right off.

457
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:33,305
- Well, do you get many?
- Now and then.

458
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:36,712
- What do you do about it?
- You'll find out.

459
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:40,794
- I will.
- Want a tip? Sweet-talk me, I like it.

460
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:45,790
Like that " lovely girl" line.
Don't worry, he don't see a thing.

461
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,788
He's too dizzy from being a big man.

462
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,714
This is gonna be different
than I thought.

463
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,031
- Do you mind?
- No.

464
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:57,944
It's only fair.
We'll educate each other.

465
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:00,827
- About those books.
- Yes?

466
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:06,104
I'll look around. If there's anything
interesting, I'll drop it back.

467
00:30:06,315 --> 00:30:10,354
You can drop it back even
if it's not so interesting.

468
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:18,947
- You two gonna get together?
- I think we're all set.

469
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:23,512
- Great, great. Appreciate it.
- So do I.

470
00:30:23,715 --> 00:30:26,354
Well, I guess... I guess I'll be going.

471
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:30,751
So long, kid!

472
00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:35,944
So long, kid.

473
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,513
Gin!

474
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:45,589
Forty-one.

475
00:32:45,835 --> 00:32:47,951
- Forty-one?
- Forty-one.

476
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:36,190
Pay attention, that Verrall guy
can do you some good.

477
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:38,153
All right.

478
00:33:42,515 --> 00:33:45,985
You're in the big league.
You should watch your step.

479
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,146
All right.

480
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:55,944
You gotta learn to fit in.
Can't have you around if you don't.

481
00:33:58,835 --> 00:34:01,588
Have to be careful
of what you do and say.

482
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:03,348
Three.

483
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:10,389
Twenty-eight.

484
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:12,745
- Twenty-eight?
- Twenty-eight!

485
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:29,225
You could use a little
education yourself.

486
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,153
- Who asked you?
- Nobody.

487
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:33,346
So shut up!

488
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:50,150
- Can't I talk?
- Go on, play your cards.

489
00:34:57,835 --> 00:35:02,147
- It's a free country.
- That's what you think.

490
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:37,188
Do you mind?!

491
00:35:41,595 --> 00:35:43,074
Gin.

492
00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:50,863
Thirty-four.

493
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,754
- Thirty-four?
- Thirty-four!

494
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:00,746
- Schneider!
- What?

495
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:03,150
$55.60.

496
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:06,188
- All right, that's enough.
- Pay me now.

497
00:36:06,435 --> 00:36:09,871
- Don't you trust me?
- Sore loser!

498
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:11,668
Shut up!

499
00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:16,145
Fifty-five dollars and 60 cents.

500
00:36:41,555 --> 00:36:42,749
Thanks.

501
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:55,184
- You gonna play like that all night?
- What?

502
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:06,674
Hurt your eyes.

503
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:39,549
- Hello.
- Hello.

504
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:42,753
I tried your suite. No answer.

505
00:37:43,235 --> 00:37:45,544
Yeah, I know. I'm not in.

506
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:50,911
- Morning papers.
- Oh, I don't read papers.

507
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:54,790
- Never?
- Once in a while, the funnies.

508
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:57,907
I think you should.
The not-so-funnies.

509
00:37:58,115 --> 00:37:59,104
Why?

510
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:02,148
- Well, it's interesting.
- Not to me.

511
00:38:02,355 --> 00:38:03,913
How do you know?

512
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,154
If you're gonna turn out
to be a pest, we can call it off.

513
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:09,344
Sorry.

514
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:13,907
I look at the papers sometimes,
but I never understand it.

515
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:15,912
So what's the sense?

516
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:19,994
Look through these, and anything
you don't understand...

517
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:23,392
...make a circle around it.
Then I'll explain.

518
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,103
- Whatever I can. All right?
- All right.

519
00:38:26,315 --> 00:38:29,512
And I thought you might like these.

520
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:31,946
Well, I'll try.

521
00:38:33,155 --> 00:38:37,307
Start reading. If you don't
like it, start something else.

522
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,109
One thing, my eyesight isn't so hot.

523
00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:42,385
Why don't you wear glasses?

524
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:45,348
- Sure, why not?
- Because it's terrible.

525
00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:04,032
Of course, they're not so bad on men.

526
00:39:06,715 --> 00:39:09,946
- Good night, Billie.
- Good night.

527
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,554
Hello!

528
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:35,553
Miss Dawn around?

529
00:39:37,515 --> 00:39:40,746
- Have you seen Miss Dawn?
- In her room.

530
00:39:44,995 --> 00:39:47,111
- Hello?
- Yes?

531
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:50,113
- Ready to start.
- Come on up!

532
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:23,949
- Hello.
- Hello.

533
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:30,665
- Been reading, huh? That's good.
- Yeah.

534
00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:33,554
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

535
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:45,151
- Did you have your breakfast yet?
- And lunch.

536
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:51,349
- There's a few things here.
- Which?

537
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:07,553
Read it out.

538
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:10,551
You want me to read?

539
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,188
Billie, things
are complicated enough...

540
00:41:14,395 --> 00:41:17,546
...without complicating them further.

541
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:23,554
I ought to take this pencil
and make a circle around you.

542
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:30,150
- Here are a few places you should see.
- A few?

543
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:34,951
The Capitol. I'll tell you all I know,
then we'll join a tour.

544
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:37,749
Senate's in session today.

545
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,351
Let's go to the rotunda.
It's famous for its...

546
00:41:41,795 --> 00:41:45,674
- Come on. You'll find it interesting.
- I'm coming.

547
00:41:45,995 --> 00:41:47,587
- Now before Congress.

548
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:52,750
On the walls of this rotunda
are eight historical paintings...

549
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,792
- with the landing of the Pilgrims...

550
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:01,465
- Revolutionary War paintings,
depicting the start...

551
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:05,793
...and finish of that war,
and its two greatest battles.

552
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:11,865
The east wall contains paintings
predating the Revolutionary period.

553
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:15,994
- <i>The Glorification</i>
<i>of the Spirit of George Washington.</i>

554
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:20,393
Washington is the figure
with the purple robe on his lap.

555
00:42:20,595 --> 00:42:25,464
The figures around him
represent Liberty and Victory.

556
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:30,385
Brumidi did most of that work
lying on his back...

557
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:34,514
...on a scaffold built
from the floor to the dome...

558
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:38,674
...a distance of 180 feet
and 3 inches.

559
00:42:39,795 --> 00:42:41,786
Now if you'll follow me...

560
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:45,550
How could anybody paint
upside down like that?

561
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:48,553
Hey, give me one of those.

562
00:43:00,955 --> 00:43:02,752
- Hello.
- How are you?

563
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:58,954
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

564
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:07,026
There's the Constitution...

565
00:44:08,635 --> 00:44:12,753
...the Declaration of Independence.
And come here.

566
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:19,986
And the Bill of Rights.
Know how old these are?

567
00:44:20,235 --> 00:44:23,591
- Oh, about 160 years.
- Who told you?

568
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:27,145
- What else do you know about it?
- What else?

569
00:44:28,715 --> 00:44:31,354
- What else?
- This whole country...

570
00:44:31,555 --> 00:44:35,343
...is founded on these
three pieces of paper.

571
00:44:35,555 --> 00:44:37,944
This whole country?

572
00:44:41,755 --> 00:44:46,385
"The right of the people
to keep and bear arms...

573
00:44:46,635 --> 00:44:50,344
...shall not be in-fringed."
- Infringed.

574
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:56,228
Good thing it's covered with glass.
I'd be making circles all over it.

575
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,147
How about some ice cream?

576
00:45:00,955 --> 00:45:03,549
Anything but tutti-frutti.

577
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,987
- How's chocolate?
- Fine.

578
00:45:07,195 --> 00:45:10,392
- I like you better with them on.
- What?

579
00:45:10,595 --> 00:45:12,551
Your glasses!

580
00:45:16,835 --> 00:45:20,305
Thanks. You know, chocolate's
the most popular.

581
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:21,948
I read that.

582
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:27,550
It's interesting how many things
a person could learn if they read.

583
00:45:28,155 --> 00:45:30,589
I don't suppose you read my piece.

584
00:45:30,835 --> 00:45:34,145
What are you talking?
Of course I read it. Twice.

585
00:45:34,355 --> 00:45:35,993
What did you think?

586
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:41,070
It's the best thing I ever read.
I didn't understand one word.

587
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:45,744
- What didn't you understand?
- None of it.

588
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,151
Here. Show me what.

589
00:45:58,195 --> 00:46:01,790
What's so funny?
That I'm blind, practically?

590
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:03,753
Practically blind.

591
00:46:03,955 --> 00:46:06,310
- Practically blind?
- You're wonderful.

592
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:10,588
- I'm sorry I look funny to you.
- You look lovelier than ever.

593
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:14,185
You sound like one of those
ads for eyeglasses.

594
00:46:14,435 --> 00:46:16,426
What didn't you understand?

595
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:20,992
Well, like the name of it:
"The Yellowing Democratic Manifesto."

596
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:25,154
- Simple.
- To who? Whom? Who?

597
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:27,353
Well, anyway, not to me.

598
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:30,786
- You know what "yellowing" means.
- Not this time.

599
00:46:30,995 --> 00:46:34,305
When a piece of paper gets old,
what happens to it?

600
00:46:34,715 --> 00:46:37,548
- Throw it away?
- No, it turns yellow.

601
00:46:37,755 --> 00:46:39,393
- It does?
- Of course.

602
00:46:39,595 --> 00:46:41,426
What do you know?

603
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:45,423
- You know what " Democratic" means.
- Not Republican.

604
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:49,030
Well, not exactly.

605
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:53,791
It means pertaining to our form
of government, which is a democracy.

606
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:57,785
- What's pertaining?
- " Has to do with."

607
00:46:58,035 --> 00:47:00,310
Pertaining. Nice word.

608
00:47:00,515 --> 00:47:03,188
- All right. " Manifesto."
- I don't know.

609
00:47:03,435 --> 00:47:06,871
- Why didn't you look it up?
- I did. I still don't know.

610
00:47:07,395 --> 00:47:11,752
By "manifesto" I mean the rules,
principles, ideals and hopes...

611
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:14,549
...on which the United States is based.

612
00:47:14,755 --> 00:47:18,031
The ideas of the men who
wrote the Constitution.

613
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,829
- You think it's turning yellow?
- Yes.

614
00:47:21,035 --> 00:47:24,232
The original inspiration
has been forgotten.

615
00:47:24,435 --> 00:47:27,188
- And that's bad?
- And that's bad.

616
00:47:30,595 --> 00:47:31,948
" Even a..."

617
00:47:32,235 --> 00:47:33,907
- " Cursory"?
- Cursory.

618
00:47:34,115 --> 00:47:37,232
"... examination of contemporary...

619
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:40,035
...society in terms of the Greek...

620
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:43,989
...philosophy, which defines
the whole as a representation...

621
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,993
...of its parts,
sends one immediately...

622
00:47:47,235 --> 00:47:50,989
...to the consideration of
the individual as a citizen...

623
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,113
...and the citizen as an individual."

624
00:47:54,315 --> 00:47:58,433
- Well?
- I looked up every word.

625
00:48:00,515 --> 00:48:01,948
Listen.

626
00:48:02,155 --> 00:48:05,545
Thousands of years ago,
a Greek philosopher said...

627
00:48:05,755 --> 00:48:09,065
...the world could only be
as good as its inhabitants.

628
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:10,993
- Makes sense.
- So I said...

629
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:12,987
...take one look at America...

630
00:48:13,235 --> 00:48:17,513
...and you figure you better look
at the people in it. One by one.

631
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,194
That's all.

632
00:48:19,715 --> 00:48:22,183
- That's this?
- Sure.

633
00:48:22,395 --> 00:48:24,989
Well, why didn't you say so?

634
00:49:09,755 --> 00:49:15,387
- What's the name of this number?
- Beethoven's Second Symphony, Opus 36.

635
00:49:15,595 --> 00:49:19,747
I didn't ask you who made it up.
I just asked the name of it.

636
00:49:37,395 --> 00:49:39,386
Here. Wait a minute.

637
00:49:43,635 --> 00:49:45,785
- There.
- Thanks.

638
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:52,152
- I can't get over it.
- Music that bad?

639
00:49:52,595 --> 00:49:56,793
- The music? Oh, it was swell.
- Well then, what?

640
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:59,789
I got a letter today, from my father.

641
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:01,269
- New York?
- Yeah.

642
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:03,870
- I can't get over it.
- Why?

643
00:50:04,075 --> 00:50:07,670
It's the first time he wrote me
in about eight years.

644
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:13,194
We had a fight, sort of.
He didn't want me to go with Harry.

645
00:50:13,395 --> 00:50:14,669
What does he do?

646
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:16,394
- My father?
- Yeah.

647
00:50:16,595 --> 00:50:18,870
Gas company. He read metres...

648
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:22,391
...but he can't get around
so good anymore...

649
00:50:22,595 --> 00:50:26,383
...so they gave him a different job.
Elevator man.

650
00:50:26,915 --> 00:50:30,271
He's a goofy old guy.
He used to take a frying pan...

651
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:33,626
...to work every day
and cook his lunch.

652
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:37,185
He said everybody
should have a hot lunch.

653
00:50:38,075 --> 00:50:40,066
I don't know how he did it.

654
00:50:40,275 --> 00:50:43,790
Four of us. Me and my three brothers.
He did everything.

655
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:46,589
My mother died. I never knew her.

656
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:51,073
He used to feed us and give us
our bath and buy our clothes.

657
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:52,987
Everything.

658
00:50:54,035 --> 00:50:59,109
All my life I used to think how
someday I'd like to pay him back.

659
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:05,188
It's funny how it worked out.

660
00:51:06,075 --> 00:51:11,388
Once I brought home $100 and gave it
to him. You know what he did?

661
00:51:14,115 --> 00:51:17,312
Well, it sure didn't
do the plumbing no good.

662
00:51:17,515 --> 00:51:23,192
I thought he'd hit me, but he didn't.
His whole life, he never hit me once.

663
00:51:24,075 --> 00:51:27,511
How'd he happen to write you,
after all this time?

664
00:51:27,715 --> 00:51:29,785
Because I wrote him.

665
00:51:30,235 --> 00:51:33,386
He says he's thought about me
every day.

666
00:51:34,115 --> 00:51:35,992
Gosh!

667
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:42,187
I haven't thought about him,
I bet once even, in five years.

668
00:51:43,195 --> 00:51:47,666
Oh, that's nothing against him.
I haven't thought of anything.

669
00:51:48,115 --> 00:51:50,185
Be nice to see him, maybe.

670
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:52,433
I guess so.

671
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:57,590
He says I should write again, and
I should have a hot lunch every day.

672
00:51:57,795 --> 00:52:00,263
And I should let him know how I am.

673
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:04,827
But he won't see me if I'm still
living in any way unethical.

674
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:06,991
I looked it up.

675
00:52:07,235 --> 00:52:09,988
He always said, "Never do nothing...

676
00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:13,983
...you wouldn't want printed
in the <i>New York Times</i>."

677
00:52:16,075 --> 00:52:20,591
I practically told you the whole
story of my life by now.

678
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,225
I enjoyed it very much.

679
00:52:23,555 --> 00:52:27,184
- How about the story of your life?
- Oh, no.

680
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:29,386
Much too long...

681
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:32,385
...and mostly untrue.

682
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:07,305
This is even more gorgeous than
the Radio City Music Hall, even.

683
00:53:07,515 --> 00:53:10,393
And do you notice? It smells nice.

684
00:53:10,595 --> 00:53:12,233
It does!

685
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,032
- Come on. Sit down.
- No.

686
00:53:19,235 --> 00:53:20,987
You're tired.

687
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:24,783
I'm not a bit tired.

688
00:53:27,635 --> 00:53:28,829
See?

689
00:53:29,035 --> 00:53:31,913
You know the thing you gave me
about Napoleon?

690
00:53:32,115 --> 00:53:34,071
- What?
- By Robert G. Ingersoll?

691
00:53:34,315 --> 00:53:36,545
- Oh, yes.
- I'm not sure I get it.

692
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,508
- There's no deep meaning.
- There must be.

693
00:53:39,715 --> 00:53:42,673
He goes and looks in Napoleon's tomb...

694
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:45,708
...and he thinks
of Napoleon's sad life.

695
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:50,545
And then he says he himself
would have rather been a happy farmer.

696
00:53:50,755 --> 00:53:56,591
" I would rather have been a French
peasant, and worn wooden shoes.

697
00:53:56,795 --> 00:54:01,471
I would rather have lived in a hut
with a vine growing over the door.

698
00:54:01,715 --> 00:54:05,788
And the grapes growing purple
in the kisses of the autumn sun.

699
00:54:06,595 --> 00:54:11,350
I would rather have been a poor
peasant, with my wife by my side...

700
00:54:11,555 --> 00:54:14,592
...knitting as the day
died out of the sky...

701
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:18,993
...with my children upon my knee
and their arms about me.

702
00:54:19,475 --> 00:54:22,148
I would rather have been that man...

703
00:54:22,355 --> 00:54:26,587
...and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust...

704
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:31,027
...than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder...

705
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:33,789
...known as Napoleon the Great."

706
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:38,985
How do you remember
all that stuff?

707
00:54:44,755 --> 00:54:48,873
So he'd rather be a happy peasant
than Napoleon. Who wouldn't?

708
00:54:49,075 --> 00:54:51,111
Harry wouldn't, for one.

709
00:54:51,315 --> 00:54:54,193
- What makes you think that?
- Ask him.

710
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:56,863
He probably never heard
of Napoleon.

711
00:54:57,115 --> 00:55:00,790
What's worse, he probably never
heard of a peasant.

712
00:55:02,195 --> 00:55:04,072
Do you hate him like poison?

713
00:55:04,315 --> 00:55:05,873
- Who? Harry?
- Yeah.

714
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:07,787
- No.
- You don't like him.

715
00:55:07,995 --> 00:55:09,189
No.

716
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:12,905
- On account of me and him?
- One reason. There are lots more.

717
00:55:13,115 --> 00:55:16,505
- What?
- Think about it. Harry's a menace.

718
00:55:16,715 --> 00:55:19,070
He's not so bad. I seen worse.

719
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:22,028
Has he ever thought of anyone
but himself?

720
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,588
Who does?

721
00:55:23,795 --> 00:55:27,071
History is the story
of the struggle between...

722
00:55:27,275 --> 00:55:30,631
...the selfish and the unselfish.
- I can hear you.

723
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:33,628
All that's bad is bred by selfishness.

724
00:55:33,835 --> 00:55:38,192
Sometimes selfishness can get to be
a cause, an organized force.

725
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:41,512
Even a government.
Then it's called fascism.

726
00:55:41,795 --> 00:55:44,867
- Can you understand that?
- Sort of.

727
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:49,512
- Well, think about it.
- You're crazy about me, aren't you?

728
00:55:49,715 --> 00:55:52,912
- Yes.
- That's why you get so mad at Harry.

729
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:57,832
I hate his life, what he does,
what he stands for. Not him.

730
00:55:58,075 --> 00:56:02,990
- He just doesn't know any better.
- I go for you too.

731
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:06,191
I'm glad of it.

732
00:56:20,715 --> 00:56:24,105
" I've sworn upon the altar of God...

733
00:56:24,315 --> 00:56:29,230
...eternal hostility against
every form of tyranny...

734
00:56:30,235 --> 00:56:32,590
...over the mind of man."

735
00:56:35,115 --> 00:56:38,232
So that's Thomas Jefferson, huh?

736
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:40,710
I heard quite a bit about him.

737
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:43,987
I mean even before
I hit town, even.

738
00:56:54,755 --> 00:56:56,188
Come in.

739
00:57:01,595 --> 00:57:04,553
What are you trying to do
with those books, hatch them?

740
00:57:06,515 --> 00:57:07,584
Blue?

741
00:57:09,995 --> 00:57:11,394
Nice, that.

742
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:15,193
Beethoven. Op 36.

743
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:20,789
- What's up?
- It's because of you I'm doing this.

744
00:57:21,035 --> 00:57:23,185
- I guess you know.
- No, I didn't.

745
00:57:23,755 --> 00:57:28,590
A lot of good it did me.
I never had this trouble before.

746
00:57:29,235 --> 00:57:31,544
- Trouble?
- Sure.

747
00:57:31,755 --> 00:57:35,953
When I met you, I figured everything
is gonna work out dandy.

748
00:57:36,155 --> 00:57:39,625
Then when you wouldn't
step across the line...

749
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:43,470
...I figured maybe the way
to you is through your head.

750
00:57:44,555 --> 00:57:45,988
Well, no.

751
00:57:47,835 --> 00:57:51,191
Well, anyway, what's the diff now?
Difference.

752
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:55,110
But I like you anyway.
It's too late for the rest.

753
00:57:55,315 --> 00:57:58,034
- Why?
- Why?

754
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:01,824
There's a certain time
between a fellow and a girl...

755
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:06,512
...when it either comes off or not.
If it doesn't then, it never does.

756
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:12,347
- Maybe we haven't got to our time yet.
- I think so. You dropped the ball.

757
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,113
Don't be so sure.

758
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:18,105
I never thought I'd
go through a thing like this.

759
00:58:18,315 --> 00:58:21,352
- Like what?
- Like getting all mixed-up.

760
00:58:21,555 --> 00:58:25,628
Like wondering and worrying
and thinking. Stuff like that.

761
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:30,750
Last night I started thinking.
I couldn't fall asleep for 10 minutes!

762
00:58:31,035 --> 00:58:34,744
I don't know if it's good
to find out so much so quick.

763
00:58:34,955 --> 00:58:39,710
Nobody's born smart. Know what
the stupidest thing on earth is? A baby.

764
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:41,985
What have you got against babies?

765
00:58:42,235 --> 00:58:46,148
I've got nothing against a brain
that's three weeks old.

766
00:58:46,355 --> 00:58:49,950
But if it's still empty after
30 years, I begin to wonder.

767
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:52,589
- Who says I'm 30?
- I didn't...

768
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,114
- You did!
- I swear.

769
00:58:54,315 --> 00:58:56,624
- You sure can get me sore.
- Sorry.

770
00:58:56,835 --> 00:58:58,746
- Do I look 30 to you?
- No.

771
00:58:58,955 --> 00:59:01,628
- Then why'd you say it?
- I don't know.

772
00:59:01,835 --> 00:59:04,588
- How old are you?
- Twenty-nine!

773
00:59:08,595 --> 00:59:10,233
Don't stop.

774
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:12,585
I meant, don't stop studying.

775
00:59:13,155 --> 00:59:14,588
Will you?

776
00:59:15,235 --> 00:59:18,113
I don't know why
it's so important to you.

777
00:59:18,315 --> 00:59:21,148
Sort of a cause.
I want everyone to be smart.

778
00:59:21,355 --> 00:59:23,391
As smart as they can be.

779
00:59:23,635 --> 00:59:26,308
A world of ignorant people
is dangerous.

780
00:59:26,515 --> 00:59:31,714
- That's why I wish I was doing better.
- You're doing wonderfully.

781
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:35,988
Most people would laugh
if they knew what I was trying...

782
00:59:36,235 --> 00:59:40,706
- I'm not laughing.
- I am. I'm sort of laughing at myself.

783
00:59:40,915 --> 00:59:43,588
Who do I think I am, anyway?

784
00:59:50,075 --> 00:59:52,305
Once in a while, for a change.

785
00:59:52,515 --> 00:59:55,632
Don't try so hard.
You miss the whole point.

786
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:59,948
- I wanna like what's best to like.
- You have room for a lot.

787
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:02,305
One learns to be bigger, not smaller.

788
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:04,625
- I'm getting bigger?
- Yes.

789
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:06,786
Glad to hear it.

790
01:00:07,115 --> 01:00:08,912
But all them books!

791
01:00:09,115 --> 01:00:11,709
I told you, it's not only books.

792
01:00:11,915 --> 01:00:13,746
- It's mostly.
- It is not.

793
01:00:13,955 --> 01:00:17,152
Who said, "The proper study
of mankind is man"?

794
01:00:17,355 --> 01:00:18,788
- Who?
- You should know.

795
01:00:18,995 --> 01:00:19,984
- Why?
- I told you.

796
01:00:20,155 --> 01:00:21,383
- I forgot.
- Pope.

797
01:00:21,595 --> 01:00:25,144
- The pope?
- Not "the pope." Alexander Pope.

798
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:29,634
- "The proper study..."
- "... of mankind is man."

799
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,833
- Of course, that means women too.
- Yes.

800
01:00:33,075 --> 01:00:34,588
Yes, I know.

801
01:00:35,355 --> 01:00:38,506
I've been studying
different mankind lately.

802
01:00:38,715 --> 01:00:43,186
Like the ones you told me.
Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine.

803
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,745
And all by myself
I got to thinking about Harry.

804
01:00:47,195 --> 01:00:50,983
He works so hard
to get what he wants, for instance.

805
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:53,550
But he doesn't know what he wants.

806
01:00:53,755 --> 01:00:56,747
- More of what he's got, probably.
- Money.

807
01:00:56,955 --> 01:01:00,504
Money, more people to push around,
more money.

808
01:01:00,715 --> 01:01:03,468
He's not so bad as you think he is.

809
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,386
We were just talking about you.

810
01:01:07,635 --> 01:01:12,151
That ain't why I pay you.
She knows enough about me. Too much.

811
01:01:12,355 --> 01:01:14,915
Jim phone? I had a date with him.

812
01:01:15,115 --> 01:01:17,629
- What about Paine?
- He was quite a fellow.

813
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:21,584
- Where was he born?
- London or England. A place like that.

814
01:01:21,795 --> 01:01:24,912
- London or...? It's the same thing.
- It is?

815
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:28,790
London's a city
in the country of England.

816
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:30,951
- You got patience.
- Take it easy.

817
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:34,591
- How can she be so dumb?
- We can't all know everything.

818
01:01:34,835 --> 01:01:37,793
- Who's Tom Paine, for instance?
- What?

819
01:01:38,035 --> 01:01:41,232
- You heard me. Tom Paine.
- What do I care?

820
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:42,424
I know.

821
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:46,389
If I wanted to know who he is,
I'd know. I don't care.

822
01:01:46,595 --> 01:01:49,746
- Don't let me butt in.
- Which book did you like?

823
01:01:49,955 --> 01:01:53,425
I didn't read by him.
Only about him. I made a list.

824
01:01:53,675 --> 01:01:55,984
- Who's " Rabbit" Maranville?
- Who?

825
01:01:56,195 --> 01:01:58,914
- " Rabbit" Maranville.
- I don't know rabbits.

826
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:02,994
- Think you're smart, huh?
- He was shortstop for the Braves.

827
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:05,908
- What are you? Some kind of genius?
- No.

828
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:09,027
- I hire and fire geniuses every day.
- I'm sure.

829
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:10,953
- Where's the list?
- Here.

830
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:14,192
Suppose you start
with <i>The Age of Reason</i>.

831
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:16,630
- <i>The Age of Reason</i>?
- Then, next...

832
01:02:16,835 --> 01:02:19,429
- Who's Willie Hop?
- Billiard champion.

833
01:02:19,675 --> 01:02:22,394
- It's pronounced " Hoppe."
- I asked her.

834
01:02:22,595 --> 01:02:25,587
- Sorry. Where were we?
- <i>The Age of Reason</i>.

835
01:02:25,835 --> 01:02:29,032
- Yes. Next, <i>The Rights of Man</i>.
- <i>The Rights of Man</i>.

836
01:02:29,275 --> 01:02:31,391
- I think...
- What's a peninsula?

837
01:02:31,635 --> 01:02:34,593
You think you're so smart?
What's a peninsula?

838
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:38,748
- Not you. Her.
- It's that new medicine.

839
01:02:40,955 --> 01:02:42,388
It is not.

840
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:45,345
- What then?
- A body of land...

841
01:02:45,555 --> 01:02:47,944
...surrounded on three sides
by water.

842
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:50,988
- So what?
- So what about Sam Paine?

843
01:02:51,195 --> 01:02:54,710
Some difference between...
Tom Paine! Not Sam Paine!

844
01:02:54,915 --> 01:02:58,988
Tom Paine practically started
this whole country.

845
01:02:59,795 --> 01:03:01,831
- You mean he's dead?
- Of course.

846
01:03:02,075 --> 01:03:05,704
I want you to learn her how to act
with live people.

847
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:08,554
Education's difficult to control...

848
01:03:08,755 --> 01:03:10,791
- Work on her.
- No extra charge.

849
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:14,112
- I don't need nothing you can tell me.
- We could...

850
01:03:14,315 --> 01:03:17,034
...tell each other some
interesting things.

851
01:03:17,235 --> 01:03:19,385
- What's the idea?
- Being friendly.

852
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:20,948
Who asked you?

853
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:23,909
The more I see you
I don't like you as much.

854
01:03:24,115 --> 01:03:25,992
You're awful fresh.

855
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:30,194
- Watch out. I got my eye on you.
- Okay. We'll both watch out.

856
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:33,711
- I could knock your block off.
- Yes, I know.

857
01:03:33,915 --> 01:03:37,146
Just do what you're supposed
to do, that's all.

858
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,549
We'll stop now.

859
01:03:38,755 --> 01:03:41,906
- Go on. I wanna see how you do it.
- Not now.

860
01:03:42,115 --> 01:03:45,585
I've gotta lie down.
You don't realize how hard I work.

861
01:03:45,795 --> 01:03:46,989
Some joke!

862
01:03:47,235 --> 01:03:51,945
- 200 bucks a week and I can't watch.
- Take you on separately. Glad to.

863
01:03:52,155 --> 01:03:55,591
Got a special course
for backward millionaires.

864
01:04:01,235 --> 01:04:06,184
" London or England."
Why don't you give up?

865
01:04:16,715 --> 01:04:18,945
- Harry?
- What?

866
01:04:19,595 --> 01:04:23,554
What's this business we're in
down here? Could you tell me?

867
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:25,347
What do you mean, "we"?

868
01:04:25,555 --> 01:04:29,184
- I figure I'm a partner, in a way.
- A silent partner.

869
01:04:29,435 --> 01:04:31,790
- So?
- So shut up.

870
01:04:33,355 --> 01:04:35,027
I got a right to know.

871
01:04:35,235 --> 01:04:38,193
Keep out of my hair.
Put your nose in a book.

872
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:41,432
I don't want to do anything
against the law.

873
01:04:41,635 --> 01:04:43,114
Do what I tell you.

874
01:04:43,315 --> 01:04:46,193
I think I know what it is,
only I'm not sure.

875
01:04:46,395 --> 01:04:48,829
What's the matter?
You do all right.

876
01:04:49,075 --> 01:04:51,635
Something you want
you ain't got, maybe?

877
01:04:52,515 --> 01:04:57,589
- What?
- I wanna be like the happy peasant.

878
01:04:58,555 --> 01:05:02,912
All right, I'll buy it for you.
Now will you quit crabbing?

879
01:05:03,635 --> 01:05:06,786
I finished finally.
Thanks loads for the loan.

880
01:05:06,995 --> 01:05:09,190
- How'd you like it?
- Oh, not me.

881
01:05:09,395 --> 01:05:13,308
I don't like when everyone
has a beef against the world.

882
01:05:13,515 --> 01:05:17,224
- I like to look on the cheerful side.
- Well, the point...

883
01:05:17,475 --> 01:05:22,754
- Can the coffee klatch. You, knock off.
- Sorry, Mr. Brock.

884
01:05:23,675 --> 01:05:26,394
- Don't get so pally.
- Paul says it's okay.

885
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:29,991
- Never mind him. I don't like it.
- Know what you are?

886
01:05:30,195 --> 01:05:31,389
What?

887
01:05:40,275 --> 01:05:43,472
- Antisocial!
- You can say that again.

888
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:46,027
Where you guys been?

889
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,947
- Sorry.
- You're always sorry.

890
01:05:48,155 --> 01:05:51,033
- My fault. How do you do?
- How do you do?

891
01:05:51,235 --> 01:05:55,547
- How are you, Billie?
- Superb. A new word.

892
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:59,984
- All right, what happened?
- It may take more time...

893
01:06:00,195 --> 01:06:01,867
- And more money.
- Why more?

894
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:04,953
The amendment has to be redrafted.

895
01:06:07,115 --> 01:06:11,393
- You make me feel like a sucker.
- Norval's doing his best.

896
01:06:11,595 --> 01:06:14,985
- It ain't good enough.
- There are a lot of votes.

897
01:06:15,195 --> 01:06:17,993
- Norval's just one guy.
- He's the wrong guy.

898
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,307
I'm sick of waiting.

899
01:06:21,515 --> 01:06:25,986
Pull your weight in this deal
or I'll get somebody who can.

900
01:06:27,555 --> 01:06:29,034
Quite a temper.

901
01:06:29,275 --> 01:06:34,793
Don't mind him. He's always lived
at the top of his voice. So long, Norval.

902
01:06:48,235 --> 01:06:52,433
Harry shouldn't talk to you like that.
You're a congressman.

903
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:53,869
Oh, well.

904
01:06:54,075 --> 01:06:58,546
No one should talk to a congressman
like that, or be able to.

905
01:06:59,035 --> 01:07:02,994
- Being a congressman is wonderful.
- Thank you.

906
01:07:03,235 --> 01:07:05,590
I think I could use a drink.

907
01:07:05,795 --> 01:07:09,151
Oh, sure, congressman. Come on in.

908
01:07:10,035 --> 01:07:14,631
If he pushes you around, he's
pushing a few million people around.

909
01:07:14,955 --> 01:07:17,025
- Who?
- The ones who picked you.

910
01:07:17,275 --> 01:07:19,550
- Not quite that many.
- How many?

911
01:07:19,755 --> 01:07:22,827
306,434.

912
01:07:23,075 --> 01:07:25,987
That's quite a few to push around.

913
01:07:26,195 --> 01:07:30,586
You're not one of my constituents
by any chance, are you?

914
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:41,912
- One of the people who voted for me?
- Oh, I never voted for anybody.

915
01:07:42,115 --> 01:07:44,345
- Why not?
- I wouldn't know how.

916
01:07:44,555 --> 01:07:48,389
- Simple. You just press a button.
- Yeah. But which one?

917
01:07:48,595 --> 01:07:53,988
You listen to the speeches.
You make up your own mind. That's all.

918
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,390
Why do you take it from Harry?

919
01:07:56,595 --> 01:08:00,588
You're more important than him.
You're a congressman.

920
01:08:00,795 --> 01:08:03,992
Yes, and as such,
I have a great many duties...

921
01:08:04,235 --> 01:08:06,954
...and responsibilities and...

922
01:08:07,235 --> 01:08:10,386
The operation of government
is very complex.

923
01:08:10,635 --> 01:08:15,345
Why should it be? I understand it in
the books, and when Paul tells me.

924
01:08:15,555 --> 01:08:18,706
But when I see this
happen, it's different.

925
01:08:18,915 --> 01:08:20,109
How?

926
01:08:20,315 --> 01:08:24,831
When it's a matter of the law,
is Harry more important than others?

927
01:08:24,995 --> 01:08:25,984
No.

928
01:08:26,115 --> 01:08:30,791
Then how come he's got so much to say?
Who ever voted for him?

929
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:38,593
Well, we'll have a nice,
long talk about it sometime.

930
01:08:40,315 --> 01:08:41,987
All right.

931
01:08:42,235 --> 01:08:44,430
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

932
01:08:44,635 --> 01:08:46,387
And thank you.

933
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:57,586
Quite a little girl.

934
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:01,553
- Billie?
- Come in.

935
01:09:01,755 --> 01:09:05,794
Will you come inside?
A few things for you.

936
01:09:14,955 --> 01:09:17,389
Sign those, will you, honey?

937
01:09:20,035 --> 01:09:22,549
- What is this?
- Same old stuff.

938
01:09:22,755 --> 01:09:26,191
- What?
- Take too long to explain.

939
01:09:26,435 --> 01:09:30,826
I like having things explained
to me. I found that out.

940
01:09:31,075 --> 01:09:33,794
- Some other time.
- Now.

941
01:09:33,995 --> 01:09:38,193
- It's an agreement about a merger.
- Merger?

942
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:42,110
- What's that?
- Several companies becoming one.

943
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:44,306
- All Harry's?
- No.

944
01:09:44,515 --> 01:09:45,584
Whose, then?

945
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:49,788
A few of Harry's and some others.
French, Italian and so on.

946
01:09:49,995 --> 01:09:51,951
A cartel!

947
01:09:53,395 --> 01:09:56,705
- What are you talking about?
- Cartels. I'm against it.

948
01:09:56,915 --> 01:09:58,507
Paul explained it to me.

949
01:09:58,715 --> 01:10:01,707
- It's perfectly all right.
- Are you sure?

950
01:10:01,915 --> 01:10:03,394
- Ask Harry.
- I will.

951
01:10:03,635 --> 01:10:05,307
- He won't like it.
- Why not?

952
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:09,030
- He doesn't like people butting in.
- I'm not " people."

953
01:10:09,275 --> 01:10:10,913
Listen to me. Be smart.

954
01:10:11,115 --> 01:10:14,027
How can I be smart if nobody
tells me anything?

955
01:10:14,235 --> 01:10:15,668
I'll tell you something.

956
01:10:15,835 --> 01:10:18,952
- Sign this. Don't start with him.
- Tomorrow.

957
01:10:19,195 --> 01:10:20,184
Why tomorrow?

958
01:10:20,435 --> 01:10:23,233
- I wanna look it over.
- It's all right.

959
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:25,984
Must be fishy or you'd tell me.

960
01:10:26,235 --> 01:10:27,953
Take my word for it.

961
01:10:29,435 --> 01:10:30,663
No.

962
01:10:31,035 --> 01:10:34,948
I know you feel bad.
You don't like doing his dirty work.

963
01:10:35,155 --> 01:10:38,591
- You know you're better than him.
- That's enough!

964
01:10:38,795 --> 01:10:42,788
But I'm not so sure.
Maybe you're worse.

965
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:44,344
- Interesting?
- Not very.

966
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:47,792
You're used to reading
more high-toned stuff.

967
01:11:48,035 --> 01:11:49,946
Yes, I am.

968
01:11:50,355 --> 01:11:52,550
- What's the matter, kid?
- Nothing.

969
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:55,747
- All of a sudden...
- I don't like that Jim.

970
01:11:55,955 --> 01:11:58,788
Why? What'd he do to you?

971
01:11:59,035 --> 01:12:02,710
He didn't do anything to me.
It's what he's done to himself.

972
01:12:02,915 --> 01:12:04,143
Done what?

973
01:12:04,355 --> 01:12:09,145
Paul said he could have been Assistant
Attorney General of the United States.

974
01:12:09,435 --> 01:12:12,029
- Who?
- Jim.

975
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:17,185
- So what's wrong with that?
- So nothing's wrong. Look at him now.

976
01:12:17,395 --> 01:12:20,785
Hangs around. Helps you promote.

977
01:12:20,995 --> 01:12:25,147
Lets you walk all over him
just because you pay him.

978
01:12:25,715 --> 01:12:28,707
So we finally get around to me.

979
01:12:30,035 --> 01:12:35,587
I'm not sure I like you, either.
You're selfish, that's your trouble.

980
01:12:35,835 --> 01:12:39,145
- Since when is all this?
- Since now.

981
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:44,788
I used to think you were a big man.
I'm beginning to see you're not.

982
01:12:45,035 --> 01:12:49,074
Through history there's been bigger
men than you. Now too.

983
01:12:49,275 --> 01:12:50,594
- Who?
- Thousands.

984
01:12:50,795 --> 01:12:52,547
Name one.

985
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:54,553
My father.

986
01:12:55,355 --> 01:12:57,550
Twenty-five a week.

987
01:12:58,435 --> 01:13:01,586
Don't get nervous just because
you read a book.

988
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:04,184
- You're as dumb as ever.
- Think so?

989
01:13:04,435 --> 01:13:08,633
Yeah, but I don't mind. You know why?
Because you're the greatest...

990
01:13:08,835 --> 01:13:10,826
- Leave me alone!
- Come here!

991
01:13:11,075 --> 01:13:14,431
- I feel like I wanna go away someplace!
- Where?

992
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:17,149
- We'll go to Florida.
- I mean alone.

993
01:13:17,355 --> 01:13:19,915
- You've gone nuts! Calm down!
- I can't!

994
01:13:20,115 --> 01:13:21,707
- Why not?
- I don't know!

995
01:13:21,915 --> 01:13:24,793
I hate my life.
There's a better kind.

996
01:13:25,035 --> 01:13:29,984
If you'd read some books you'd know.
Maybe you're right. I'm still dumb.

997
01:13:30,235 --> 01:13:34,786
But I know there's a better
kind of life than the one I got.

998
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:36,946
Or you!

999
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:40,787
You'd rather be with
that saxophone player?

1000
01:13:40,995 --> 01:13:43,714
- At least he was honest!
- He was a chump.

1001
01:13:43,915 --> 01:13:47,112
- He worked for a living.
- I worked since I was 12.

1002
01:13:47,315 --> 01:13:50,785
- Nobody give me nothing.
- Robbing a house is work too.

1003
01:13:50,995 --> 01:13:53,145
In my whole life...!

1004
01:13:58,355 --> 01:14:00,585
I never robbed a house in my life!

1005
01:14:00,795 --> 01:14:03,992
- What are you talking about?
- You can't understand.

1006
01:14:04,195 --> 01:14:06,584
Get off that high horse,
you dumb pot!

1007
01:14:06,795 --> 01:14:07,989
You...

1008
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:09,753
...menace!

1009
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:14,587
You never had a decent meal
until you met me!

1010
01:14:14,795 --> 01:14:17,992
But I had to eat with you!
You got no manners.

1011
01:14:18,235 --> 01:14:22,114
Taking your shoes off all the time
and picking your teeth.

1012
01:14:22,315 --> 01:14:24,749
You're just not couth!

1013
01:14:31,395 --> 01:14:33,750
I'm as couth as you are!

1014
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:39,225
- And that cheap perfume you put on.
- Cheap?

1015
01:14:39,435 --> 01:14:42,905
I don't own nothing cheap except you.

1016
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:47,354
You don't own me. Nobody can
own anybody. The law says.

1017
01:14:47,555 --> 01:14:50,991
- If I was scared, I wouldn't be here.
- Where are you?

1018
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:54,346
You don't like it here, beat it!

1019
01:14:56,355 --> 01:14:59,392
- Wait a minute! First this.
- Not now.

1020
01:14:59,635 --> 01:15:00,784
- Right now!
- No!

1021
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:04,345
I won't sign anything
till I know what it is.

1022
01:15:04,635 --> 01:15:06,944
Do what I'm telling you!

1023
01:15:08,635 --> 01:15:10,751
Harry, please don't!

1024
01:15:17,035 --> 01:15:18,548
There.

1025
01:15:32,235 --> 01:15:34,544
All right, now go on. Blow.

1026
01:15:35,275 --> 01:15:39,553
I don't want you bawling here.
You don't appreciate nothing.

1027
01:15:39,755 --> 01:15:45,148
Go sit on a park bench until you learn
how to behave. Go on, beat it!

1028
01:15:48,355 --> 01:15:50,346
This way out.

1029
01:15:50,835 --> 01:15:52,507
I gotta put something on.

1030
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:56,344
Hurry up. I don't want you around.
You bother me!

1031
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:02,954
Big fascist!

1032
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:26,953
All set?

1033
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:30,792
You think I'm gonna
let a broad talk back?

1034
01:16:31,035 --> 01:16:35,187
- Where is she?
- She's leaving. I can't stand a crier.

1035
01:16:35,435 --> 01:16:38,347
- What's she crying about?
- How do I know?

1036
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:41,272
Becoming a strange girl.

1037
01:16:41,475 --> 01:16:44,990
She's all right. It's these books.
They got her nervous.

1038
01:16:45,235 --> 01:16:47,544
Educating her was a mistake.

1039
01:16:47,755 --> 01:16:52,545
I didn't know it would be like this.
I'll fire that Verrall skunk.

1040
01:16:52,755 --> 01:16:53,710
Why blame him?

1041
01:16:53,915 --> 01:16:59,592
He taught her too much. You know
what she called me? A "fatch-ist"!

1042
01:16:59,795 --> 01:17:04,346
That don't make sense. I was born
in New Jersey. She knows that.

1043
01:17:06,635 --> 01:17:08,751
What's the matter, Harry?

1044
01:17:12,515 --> 01:17:14,949
I love that broad.

1045
01:17:16,515 --> 01:17:21,350
You think we could find somebody
to make her dumb again?

1046
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:32,745
Don't be late if you don't
want no bloody nose.

1047
01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:38,705
- Would you do me a favour, Harry?
- What?

1048
01:17:38,915 --> 01:17:41,349
Drop dead.

1049
01:18:32,915 --> 01:18:36,954
<i>I have sworn upon the altar of God...</i>

1050
01:18:37,435 --> 01:18:39,869
<i>... eternal hostility...</i>

1051
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:43,546
<i>... against every form of tyranny...</i>

1052
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:47,314
<i>... over the mind of man.</i>

1053
01:19:02,395 --> 01:19:04,784
Oh, hello. Chestnut-7180.

1054
01:19:05,035 --> 01:19:08,744
I'd like to speak to
Thomas Jefferson, please.

1055
01:19:08,995 --> 01:19:12,351
Oh, no. I mean Thomas Verrall.

1056
01:19:13,635 --> 01:19:16,513
No, Paul Verrall. Paul Verrall.

1057
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:19,149
Well, it's very important.

1058
01:19:20,435 --> 01:19:22,744
Well, I'll hold on.

1059
01:19:33,355 --> 01:19:35,186
- Jim!
- Yes?

1060
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:37,113
- What time is it?
- 11:30.

1061
01:19:37,315 --> 01:19:40,068
- I'll slug her when she gets back.
- If.

1062
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:44,951
- She always winds up where I want her.
- I hope so.

1063
01:20:01,515 --> 01:20:02,391
Jim!

1064
01:20:02,635 --> 01:20:04,273
- What time is it?
- 11:30.

1065
01:20:04,475 --> 01:20:07,831
- You said that before.
- 11:31.

1066
01:20:08,235 --> 01:20:12,945
- She's been gone eight hours.
- Maybe she's seeing a double feature.

1067
01:20:13,155 --> 01:20:15,953
That don't take eight hours.

1068
01:20:16,435 --> 01:20:18,995
- Could've had an accident.
- You'd hear.

1069
01:20:19,235 --> 01:20:22,386
Could have got attacked.
Happens all the time.

1070
01:20:22,635 --> 01:20:27,151
Not to Billie. Maybe the other
way around. But not to her.

1071
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:42,029
She here?

1072
01:20:42,235 --> 01:20:44,544
What do you mean?
No. Look some more.

1073
01:20:44,755 --> 01:20:47,792
- I been all over town.
- Well, go over it again.

1074
01:20:47,995 --> 01:20:52,910
- Do what I'm telling you.
- Sure. Just changing my socks.

1075
01:20:54,835 --> 01:20:56,393
- Harry.
- What?

1076
01:20:56,635 --> 01:20:58,546
Marry her.

1077
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:00,954
Still harping?

1078
01:21:01,155 --> 01:21:03,874
I'm thinking of your legal safety.
She...

1079
01:21:04,075 --> 01:21:05,906
I know what she owns.

1080
01:21:06,115 --> 01:21:08,310
You've got to do it, Harry.

1081
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:13,350
Broads always hook you in the end.
All this because a dame reads a book.

1082
01:21:13,555 --> 01:21:16,911
It's the new world.
Force and reason changing places.

1083
01:21:17,115 --> 01:21:19,504
- What?
- Knowledge is power.

1084
01:21:19,715 --> 01:21:23,185
I don't like this. You stewed,
that broad out of line.

1085
01:21:23,435 --> 01:21:26,154
- And some congressman!
- I think he's cute.

1086
01:21:26,355 --> 01:21:27,993
I'd like to trade him in.

1087
01:21:28,195 --> 01:21:30,106
- On what?
- On a senator!

1088
01:21:30,315 --> 01:21:31,794
On a senator?

1089
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:36,586
Take the blinders off and let in
the light. Just for a second.

1090
01:21:36,795 --> 01:21:41,585
You can't buy senators and congressmen
as if they wore price tags.

1091
01:21:41,835 --> 01:21:45,350
These guys are honest.
Sincerely trying to do a job.

1092
01:21:45,715 --> 01:21:49,503
Sometimes you find
a rotten apple, like Hedges.

1093
01:21:49,715 --> 01:21:53,549
But just once in a while.
In a great while.

1094
01:22:25,435 --> 01:22:29,508
Are you sure you're ringing
Mr. Brock's suite, operator?

1095
01:22:29,715 --> 01:22:32,275
Well, how about the bedroom?

1096
01:22:32,795 --> 01:22:35,514
Ring a few more times.
I wanna make sure.

1097
01:22:35,715 --> 01:22:38,707
- He's not in.
- Just one more ring.

1098
01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:42,114
Let's go.

1099
01:22:52,795 --> 01:22:55,389
The stuff's in his briefcase.

1100
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:57,551
In his bedroom.

1101
01:22:59,995 --> 01:23:03,192
I probably won't see you again, Paul.

1102
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,306
- I wanna say goodbye.
- What?

1103
01:23:05,515 --> 01:23:08,154
- And thanks.
- Where are you going?

1104
01:23:08,355 --> 01:23:11,950
- Away from here, that's all I know.
- Where?

1105
01:23:12,715 --> 01:23:14,387
You can tell me.

1106
01:23:14,595 --> 01:23:18,747
I don't know. I thought
I might go see my father for a while.

1107
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:21,589
- I've got a better idea.
- What?

1108
01:23:21,795 --> 01:23:23,945
Let's get married.

1109
01:23:25,435 --> 01:23:28,154
You must be daffy.

1110
01:23:28,835 --> 01:23:31,030
I love you, Billie.

1111
01:23:32,715 --> 01:23:35,752
You don't love me.
You just love my brain.

1112
01:23:35,995 --> 01:23:37,553
That too.

1113
01:23:38,395 --> 01:23:43,310
I'll think it over, but I can
tell you now, the answer's no.

1114
01:23:49,035 --> 01:23:51,265
What are you doing?

1115
01:23:51,475 --> 01:23:54,672
If you don't know,
I must be doing it wrong.

1116
01:24:08,635 --> 01:24:10,546
Fine time!

1117
01:24:14,835 --> 01:24:17,554
- Hello, Harry.
- Where you been?

1118
01:24:17,795 --> 01:24:21,470
I took a walk, like you told me.
I met Paul.

1119
01:24:21,675 --> 01:24:24,143
Okay, buster, knock off.

1120
01:24:26,515 --> 01:24:28,107
Good night, Paul.

1121
01:24:28,515 --> 01:24:31,507
Good night, Billie.
Good night, Harry.

1122
01:24:32,795 --> 01:24:36,231
What's the matter, Harry?
You miss me?

1123
01:24:51,955 --> 01:24:54,788
I got something to say
and I don't like to wait.

1124
01:24:54,995 --> 01:24:55,871
I know.

1125
01:24:56,075 --> 01:24:58,509
- Now I'm not so sure.
- Why not?

1126
01:24:58,715 --> 01:25:02,151
Talking fresh, slamming doors.
I knew you'd be back.

1127
01:25:02,395 --> 01:25:04,750
- You did?
- Jim was worried, not me.

1128
01:25:04,995 --> 01:25:06,713
Not yet.

1129
01:25:07,075 --> 01:25:10,192
- What took you so long?
- I had a lot to think.

1130
01:25:10,395 --> 01:25:12,955
- For instance?
- Where I stand around here.

1131
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:14,986
- I'm trying to tell you.
- What?

1132
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:16,463
Where you stand.

1133
01:25:16,675 --> 01:25:20,145
First, Verrall is out.
I don't like to see you upset.

1134
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:22,511
- Next, we'll get married.
- No.

1135
01:25:22,715 --> 01:25:24,865
But you gotta behave...
No?

1136
01:25:25,075 --> 01:25:28,545
- What do you mean, " no"?
- I don't wanna, that's what.

1137
01:25:28,755 --> 01:25:33,510
- In fact, I've never been so insulted!
- Who are you to say no?

1138
01:25:33,715 --> 01:25:37,947
Don't knock yourself out.
You got a lot of surprises coming.

1139
01:25:42,515 --> 01:25:44,073
- Just tell me.
- What?

1140
01:25:44,275 --> 01:25:47,665
- How can you not wanna marry me?
- For one, you're dumb.

1141
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:52,744
I got a different kind of life in mind.
Sorry, you wouldn't fit in.

1142
01:25:52,995 --> 01:25:55,509
- I don't understand!
- I do.

1143
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:57,307
What did I do?

1144
01:25:57,515 --> 01:26:02,145
I talked rough to you. Maybe I hit you
a couple of times. Easy.

1145
01:26:02,395 --> 01:26:05,148
Is that any reason
to treat me like this?

1146
01:26:05,435 --> 01:26:08,507
I done good too.
Can't we straighten it out?

1147
01:26:08,715 --> 01:26:10,307
- No.
- Why not?

1148
01:26:10,555 --> 01:26:15,993
All that stuff I've been studying,
it just mixed me up.

1149
01:26:16,195 --> 01:26:18,106
But when you hit me before...

1150
01:26:18,315 --> 01:26:22,991
...it was like it all knocked
together in my head and made sense.

1151
01:26:23,235 --> 01:26:24,953
I realized what it means.

1152
01:26:25,195 --> 01:26:30,144
How some people are always giving it,
and some taking. And it's not fair.

1153
01:26:30,395 --> 01:26:34,513
So I'm not gonna let you anymore.
Or anybody else.

1154
01:26:36,435 --> 01:26:39,905
Listen, kid. I got an idea.
You wanna come to Florida?

1155
01:26:41,915 --> 01:26:45,544
We used to have some good times
together. Remember?

1156
01:26:45,995 --> 01:26:48,748
I think you should
marry me. Don't you?

1157
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:53,346
I want you to marry me.
Do what I tell you or you'll be sorry.

1158
01:26:53,595 --> 01:26:58,510
- I'm not scared of you anymore, Harry.
- You're not, huh?

1159
01:27:01,355 --> 01:27:04,074
- And something else. I'm leaving.
- What?

1160
01:27:04,275 --> 01:27:05,708
For good.

1161
01:27:06,075 --> 01:27:08,350
You just can't walk out.

1162
01:27:08,595 --> 01:27:12,713
You're in too deep. I was wrong
hooking you in, but you're in.

1163
01:27:12,915 --> 01:27:15,873
- I'm not gonna be.
- You wanna wash it up?

1164
01:27:16,075 --> 01:27:19,750
Fine! I'm too important
to monkey around with you.

1165
01:27:19,955 --> 01:27:22,708
Jim! Jim, wake up!

1166
01:27:25,395 --> 01:27:26,544
What is it?

1167
01:27:26,795 --> 01:27:31,550
- Come on, you've got some work to do.
- All right. Be right with you.

1168
01:27:31,795 --> 01:27:34,104
Okay. Well, get a move on!

1169
01:27:35,955 --> 01:27:39,311
I'll fix it so you're out.
You're spoiled. I spoiled you.

1170
01:27:39,515 --> 01:27:44,145
I was gonna make you be a real partner.
You don't want it? Fine!

1171
01:27:44,395 --> 01:27:48,593
And you don't look like you used to.
I'll be glad to be rid of you.

1172
01:27:48,795 --> 01:27:51,150
And as far as I'm concerned...

1173
01:27:51,395 --> 01:27:54,512
Vice versa.

1174
01:27:56,515 --> 01:27:58,153
You're back.

1175
01:27:58,395 --> 01:27:59,748
- All set?
- Shut up!

1176
01:27:59,955 --> 01:28:02,913
Settle things up
and get her out of here.

1177
01:28:03,115 --> 01:28:05,549
- Are you sure?
- First time I am.

1178
01:28:05,755 --> 01:28:08,792
- Where's that stuff?
- In your bedroom.

1179
01:28:08,995 --> 01:28:11,350
- No!
- What do you mean, " no"?

1180
01:28:11,595 --> 01:28:15,508
I mean, let's take the shortcut.
The sooner, the better.

1181
01:28:22,315 --> 01:28:24,306
They're in the bottom drawer.

1182
01:28:31,915 --> 01:28:34,907
- Blue covers?
- Yeah.

1183
01:28:36,235 --> 01:28:39,113
- Three copies?
- That's right.

1184
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:42,346
Paul took them.

1185
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:44,509
- When?
- Just now.

1186
01:28:44,715 --> 01:28:45,704
What for?

1187
01:28:46,115 --> 01:28:49,312
Why do you think?
To put in the newspapers.

1188
01:28:49,515 --> 01:28:52,109
- Some jokes I don't like.
- It's no joke.

1189
01:28:52,315 --> 01:28:54,590
Paul says it's
the biggest swindle...

1190
01:28:54,835 --> 01:28:57,827
...since "the teapot."
Something like that.

1191
01:28:58,995 --> 01:29:00,872
Why are you getting so white?

1192
01:29:01,075 --> 01:29:04,147
You told me it was perfectly
all right.

1193
01:29:04,355 --> 01:29:07,074
- You double-crossing...
- It's not like that.

1194
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:11,632
If there's a fire and I call
the engines, who am I double-crossing?

1195
01:29:11,835 --> 01:29:13,746
The fire?

1196
01:29:17,795 --> 01:29:20,548
If this breaks,
nobody will play with us.

1197
01:29:20,795 --> 01:29:24,310
- What's to do?
- Might be best to call it off.

1198
01:29:24,515 --> 01:29:26,745
- What?
- Let him publish...

1199
01:29:26,995 --> 01:29:30,192
I've spent a lot of dough.
Just let that ride?

1200
01:29:30,435 --> 01:29:32,505
- Play it safe.
- I want my deal.

1201
01:29:32,715 --> 01:29:36,071
- Gonna be tough to get.
- Because of some weasel?

1202
01:29:36,275 --> 01:29:37,503
- Harry...
- You're chicken!

1203
01:29:37,715 --> 01:29:38,750
- Think so?
- Yes.

1204
01:29:38,955 --> 01:29:42,743
- I've been right and you've been wrong.
- Shut up!

1205
01:29:42,955 --> 01:29:44,752
I'll handle this.

1206
01:29:45,075 --> 01:29:46,747
All right.

1207
01:29:52,395 --> 01:29:55,068
- Looking for someone?
- Billie.

1208
01:29:55,475 --> 01:29:57,147
Come on in.

1209
01:30:01,755 --> 01:30:05,145
- Billie!
- Gee, I'm tired. I was down...

1210
01:30:05,675 --> 01:30:08,951
- I think you got something of mine.
- That so?

1211
01:30:18,795 --> 01:30:20,547
How about it?

1212
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,353
Sit down.

1213
01:30:33,235 --> 01:30:34,873
- Hello.
- How you been?

1214
01:30:35,075 --> 01:30:36,349
- Fine, you?
- Fine.

1215
01:30:36,715 --> 01:30:40,390
- Go to his place and get the stuff.
- It's not there.

1216
01:30:40,595 --> 01:30:42,153
Where then?

1217
01:30:43,595 --> 01:30:46,314
You wanna play rough?
I can do that too.

1218
01:30:49,555 --> 01:30:52,865
I mean business.
I got too much at stake.

1219
01:30:53,075 --> 01:30:56,147
You wanna get out alive,
you better give it back.

1220
01:30:56,355 --> 01:30:59,711
- I'm no blowhard. Tell him.
- He's no blowhard.

1221
01:30:59,915 --> 01:31:03,271
He's had people killed before.
About six years ago...

1222
01:31:03,475 --> 01:31:06,308
You ain't gonna tell
nobody nothing soon.

1223
01:31:06,835 --> 01:31:10,464
- Double negative! Right?
- Right.

1224
01:31:12,235 --> 01:31:15,944
You're gonna be in trouble
unless you do what I say.

1225
01:31:16,195 --> 01:31:19,346
Wait. There's another way
to handle this.

1226
01:31:19,555 --> 01:31:22,865
You've pulled a boner, friend.
My advice is lay off.

1227
01:31:23,075 --> 01:31:25,543
Stop sticking your noses
in my business.

1228
01:31:25,755 --> 01:31:28,349
You're the biggest buttinsky
I ever met.

1229
01:31:28,595 --> 01:31:32,907
That's my job. Your papers are
in the mail, addressed to myself.

1230
01:31:33,115 --> 01:31:35,754
- Your job? Getting in my way?
- Not exactly.

1231
01:31:35,995 --> 01:31:37,951
What, then? I'd like to know.

1232
01:31:38,155 --> 01:31:41,511
To find out what goes on
and get it to the people.

1233
01:31:41,715 --> 01:31:43,114
- What people?
- "The" people.

1234
01:31:43,315 --> 01:31:45,624
- Never heard of them.
- You will.

1235
01:31:45,835 --> 01:31:48,303
They're more well-known
all the time.

1236
01:31:48,515 --> 01:31:53,543
- And if we're operating within the law?
- Then the law needs revision.

1237
01:31:53,755 --> 01:31:55,666
- Are you the government?
- Yes.

1238
01:31:55,915 --> 01:31:58,748
- Since when?
- Since 1779. Right?

1239
01:31:58,995 --> 01:32:00,348
Right.

1240
01:32:00,955 --> 01:32:03,105
What do you think you've got?

1241
01:32:03,275 --> 01:32:06,347
Harry's connection
to Hedge's amendment.

1242
01:32:06,555 --> 01:32:08,785
- Why single us out?
- Yeah, why?

1243
01:32:08,995 --> 01:32:11,748
What we're doing is done every day.

1244
01:32:11,955 --> 01:32:16,949
Murders could go undiscovered
every day. What does that prove?

1245
01:32:17,195 --> 01:32:22,394
Undercover pressure, bribery,
corruption, government between friends!

1246
01:32:22,595 --> 01:32:26,508
It's tough to crack.
Ask me, I've tried for years.

1247
01:32:26,715 --> 01:32:30,344
You need more than knowing.
You gotta have facts.

1248
01:32:30,595 --> 01:32:34,508
- And most important, the names.
- He's got them.

1249
01:32:35,235 --> 01:32:39,353
All right. Let's get down to it.
What will you take, Paul?

1250
01:32:39,595 --> 01:32:41,153
I'll take a drink.

1251
01:32:41,395 --> 01:32:43,989
I ain't met a guy
didn't have his price.

1252
01:32:44,195 --> 01:32:46,026
- I have.
- I mean big numbers!

1253
01:32:46,355 --> 01:32:50,473
You'll be wearing
a big number across your chest!

1254
01:32:50,675 --> 01:32:52,745
I'll get to you later.

1255
01:32:52,955 --> 01:32:57,471
There's two ways to do this. One,
play ball. Two, watch your step...

1256
01:32:57,675 --> 01:33:02,544
...because there's no place you can
live if you monkey-wrench me.

1257
01:33:02,755 --> 01:33:04,552
What do you say?

1258
01:33:06,795 --> 01:33:11,152
- I'd like to think it over.
- All right. You got two minutes.

1259
01:33:34,155 --> 01:33:35,952
Come on, Billie.

1260
01:33:37,595 --> 01:33:39,153
Wait a minute, Harry!

1261
01:33:39,395 --> 01:33:40,748
Cut it out, Harry!

1262
01:33:40,955 --> 01:33:44,152
- Operator!
- Behave yourself.

1263
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:51,348
You stupid fool.
What do you think you are?

1264
01:33:51,555 --> 01:33:55,309
This muscle stuff is a thing
of the past. Cut it out!

1265
01:33:55,515 --> 01:33:56,914
I got mad.

1266
01:33:57,475 --> 01:33:58,954
Who are you to get mad?

1267
01:33:59,195 --> 01:34:02,744
- Be grateful you're free!
- You don't know me to talk like that!

1268
01:34:02,955 --> 01:34:06,550
I know you. A kick in the keister
and your problems are solved.

1269
01:34:06,795 --> 01:34:10,151
Bigger problems, bigger kicks.
Who's next? The nation?

1270
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:14,308
Don't blow your top.
I'm still ready to do business.

1271
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:16,949
How's 100 grand?

1272
01:34:17,195 --> 01:34:20,153
A hundred grand is beautiful,
but I can't take it.

1273
01:34:20,395 --> 01:34:21,714
Why not?

1274
01:34:23,475 --> 01:34:26,945
- My girl wouldn't like it, would she?
- No, she wouldn't.

1275
01:34:27,155 --> 01:34:28,793
Then what's your idea?

1276
01:34:29,115 --> 01:34:33,984
No idea. Legislation's
not meant for buying and selling.

1277
01:34:34,195 --> 01:34:37,153
"This country belongs
to the people who inhibit it"!

1278
01:34:37,475 --> 01:34:38,749
- Inhabit.
- Inhabit it!

1279
01:34:38,955 --> 01:34:40,752
- I'll do what I want.
- Try it.

1280
01:34:40,995 --> 01:34:42,144
- Who'll stop me?
- Us two.

1281
01:34:42,355 --> 01:34:44,152
Youse two? It'll be some day...

1282
01:34:44,395 --> 01:34:48,104
...when a hundred-a-week hick
and a dumb broad can stop me.

1283
01:34:49,195 --> 01:34:53,074
And you, standing around like
you're deaf! Say something!

1284
01:34:53,275 --> 01:34:55,345
- All right, I'll say something.
- Well?

1285
01:34:55,595 --> 01:34:56,744
They're right.

1286
01:34:56,955 --> 01:35:00,470
Whose side are you on?
What do you want?

1287
01:35:00,675 --> 01:35:02,347
- Rye ginger ale.
- Who asked you?

1288
01:35:02,555 --> 01:35:05,353
Tell that congressman he's
all washed up. I guarantee.

1289
01:35:05,555 --> 01:35:07,944
You won't
get away with it either.

1290
01:35:08,155 --> 01:35:11,909
- Don't worry about me.
- But I do. I worry like the devil.

1291
01:35:12,115 --> 01:35:16,313
When you live in Washington
it's enough to break your heart.

1292
01:35:16,515 --> 01:35:19,712
You see a piece of machinery,
the democratic structure...

1293
01:35:19,915 --> 01:35:22,873
...and somebody's always
tampering with it.

1294
01:35:23,075 --> 01:35:26,909
Steal from the government and
you steal from yourself, you dumb ox!

1295
01:35:27,115 --> 01:35:28,514
I'm going right ahead.

1296
01:35:28,715 --> 01:35:31,149
- I'll tell you where you're going.
- You?

1297
01:35:31,355 --> 01:35:35,951
In this whole thing, I guess you
forgot about how I'm a partner.

1298
01:35:36,195 --> 01:35:39,949
Jim once told me.
126 different yards I own.

1299
01:35:40,195 --> 01:35:41,310
Control.

1300
01:35:41,595 --> 01:35:44,553
Same thing. Here's how it is.
I don't want them.

1301
01:35:44,795 --> 01:35:47,753
I don't want what's yours,
so I'm signing them back.

1302
01:35:47,995 --> 01:35:50,748
- All right.
- Only not all at once. One at a time.

1303
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,508
One a year.

1304
01:35:53,595 --> 01:35:55,472
Only you gotta behave!

1305
01:35:55,675 --> 01:35:58,314
If you don't,
I could let go on everything.

1306
01:35:58,515 --> 01:36:01,154
For what you've done,
even since I've known you...

1307
01:36:01,395 --> 01:36:05,104
...I bet you could be put in jail
for about 900 years.

1308
01:36:05,515 --> 01:36:08,507
You'd be a pretty old man
when you got out.

1309
01:36:09,675 --> 01:36:11,154
What's going on around here?

1310
01:36:11,355 --> 01:36:12,470
A revolution.

1311
01:36:12,675 --> 01:36:15,314
Come on, Paul.
I'll send for my things.

1312
01:36:15,515 --> 01:36:19,110
You little crumb. You'll be
sorry for this. Wait and see.

1313
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:21,112
Go ahead.
You don't stand a chance.

1314
01:36:21,315 --> 01:36:23,271
You'll outsmart yourself.

1315
01:36:23,475 --> 01:36:24,954
- Goodbye, all.
- And you!

1316
01:36:25,195 --> 01:36:26,150
- Me?
- Yeah!

1317
01:36:26,395 --> 01:36:30,104
- You're fired.
- Sorry. I enjoyed working for you.

1318
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:34,264
- Open up.
- All right, Harry?

1319
01:36:34,475 --> 01:36:36,943
Do what I'm telling you!

1320
01:36:48,675 --> 01:36:50,506
How do you like that?

1321
01:36:51,075 --> 01:36:53,908
He could've had 100 grand.
She could've had me.

1322
01:36:54,115 --> 01:36:55,946
Both wind up with nothing.

1323
01:36:56,195 --> 01:36:58,106
Dumb chump!

1324
01:36:58,315 --> 01:36:59,668
Crazy broad.

1325
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:03,072
To all the dumb chumps
and all the crazy broads...

1326
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:05,152
...past, present and future...

1327
01:37:05,355 --> 01:37:08,347
...who thirst for knowledge
and search for truth...

1328
01:37:08,595 --> 01:37:12,668
...who fight for justice
and civilize each other...

1329
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:16,504
...and make it so tough
for crooks like you.

1330
01:37:16,715 --> 01:37:18,114
And me.

1331
01:37:27,315 --> 01:37:28,953
License, please.

1332
01:37:33,115 --> 01:37:34,946
- No, not this license.
- Sorry.

1333
01:37:35,195 --> 01:37:36,708
Forget it.
My wedding present.

1334
01:37:36,915 --> 01:37:39,873
- Take it easy, or you'll never make it.
- We'll make it.

1335
01:37:40,075 --> 01:37:42,748
It's a clear case
of predestination.

1336
01:37:42,995 --> 01:37:44,064
" Pre" what?

1337
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:45,708
Look it up.
