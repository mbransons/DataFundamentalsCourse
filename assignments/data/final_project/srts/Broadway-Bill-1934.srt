1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:19,870
Yes, J.L.

3
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,664
Yes, J.L.

4
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:33,757
–I've been waiting a half hour.
–Not now, I'm busy.

5
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,674
Got to get all his
sons–in–lay on the phone.

6
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,391
Maine 674.

7
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:40,394
Board of directors meeting tonight.
This is the first.

8
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:44,230
They know there's a meeting tonight.

9
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:45,721
The whole town knows it.

10
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,653
Just the same, J.L. Insists
notifying officially.

11
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,280
Hello, Higgins Hardware?

12
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:53,269
Mr. Early, please.

13
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,112
Higgins.

14
00:01:54,284 --> 00:01:55,233
Higgins!

15
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:01,950
That’s not a family,
it’s a disease.

16
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,750
Henry Early speaking.
Yes, Mrs. Petersen.

17
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:13,500
I just want to remind you there's
a board meeting at 7 sharp.

18
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:18,258
Arthur Winslow talking.

19
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,596
Yes, Mrs. Petersen.

20
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:22,134
Naturally.

21
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,265
The usual time, yes.

22
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,644
Mr. Brooks hasn't been in all
day. I don't know.

23
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,189
You've got to him and tell
him his father–in–law expects him.

24
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,909
Yes, Mrs. Peterson.

25
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:39,402
Have you tried his home?
His wife might...

26
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,158
She's hung up.

27
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:43,413
We've got to find Mr. Brooks.

28
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,835
That’s ridiculous.
He must be in his office.

29
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,876
He's not...

30
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:51,250
and you know how strict
your father is about meetings.

31
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,590
I'll see that he gets there.

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,717
I think I know where he is.

33
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:01,883
All right, Whitey.

34
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,935
Here comes the home stretch.
Come on!

35
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:05,218
Come on, Broadway Bill!

36
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:06,228
Princess, hurry up.

37
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:14,858
Take him to the barn.
I'll see you there.

38
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:16,153
Hot digidy!

39
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,454
–What he do it in?
–1 minute, 40 seconds.

40
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:26,622
–1:40?
–Yeah.

41
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:29,360
Gee, that knocks another second off.

42
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:32,332
He's liable to break the
world’s record.

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,460
Hi, Bill.

44
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:38,175
Ata boy.

45
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:41,348
–He can sure pick ‘em up.
–He's still stalling.

46
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:42,383
–Stalling?
–Yeah.

47
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,810
–Going as fast as you can see.
–Nice work.

48
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:49,391
–He's great.
–What’s this?

49
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,358
She taught Skeeter to do that.

50
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:54,611
–Skeeter?
–Miss named him that way.

51
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,772
You got a mascot, pal.

52
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:00,282
–Biggest pals.
–You know more about him than I do.

53
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:02,195
You hang around a lot, Princes.

54
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:05,448
–Make something of it?
–For Emperor Higgins.

55
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:06,906
Don't let him catch it.

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,159
Emperor Higgins doesn't
know I'm alive.

57
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,747
I'm just the young brat.

58
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:13,791
Get married, give him
another son–in–law.

59
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:17,750
Someone to take care of
another Higgins enterprise.

60
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:18,841
No, thanks

61
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,802
–I'm coming.
–Walk him around for about an hour.

62
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:23,130
–Any carrots?
–Six, but no more.

63
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:23,973
Not seven?

64
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:26,170
Take care of him or
I'll break your neck.

65
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:27,266
Come on, Bill.

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,565
A great horse!

67
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:34,810
I wish he run right now.

68
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,192
He's got background, stamina.

69
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:41,240
Ana a will to win.
That’s important in a horse.

70
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:47,408
The Imperial Racetrack
opened last week.

71
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:50,411
Don't you think I know it?

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,877
I saw you boyfriend,
Bill Taylor.

73
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,456
–Why don't you?
–Don't what?

74
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:59,214
Take Broadway Bill
down to the track.

75
00:04:59,427 --> 00:05:00,459
Are you crazy?

76
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:02,490
What are you waiting for?

77
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:05,220
You've been dying to get
out of Higginsville.

78
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:08,180
Your heart is in horses and
you're making paper boxes.

79
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:09,343
It doesn't make sense.

80
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:13,723
–What’s got into you?
–Oh.

81
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:17,589
You're a fool, daddy.

82
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:18,898
–I am, huh?
–Yes.

83
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,324
You've become another
Higgins' slave.

84
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,952
–Mind if I have an idea?
–What is it?

85
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:34,836
I've always been honest.

86
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,579
I'd cut off my right arm
before I'd lie to you.

87
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:38,504
What is it?

88
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,632
I read my bible and
don't mess around.

89
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:42,343
What do you want to tell me?

90
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:43,971
I've been addin' things up.

91
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:46,630
And subtracting, dividing
and multiplying.

92
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:49,134
And get the same answer.

93
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:52,726
It wouldn't be honest to race
Bill for anyone else.

94
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:55,353
Who asked you?
Go on, get out of here.

95
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:57,814
–Yes, sir.
–See you.

96
00:05:57,987 --> 00:05:59,649
Come on, Bill.

97
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:02,199
Mr. Brooks!

98
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,112
Your wife wants you
to come right home.

99
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:06,946
–There's a meeting tonight.
–Beat it.

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,410
–But she...
–Get out of here, I told you!

101
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:13,285
I was just trying to tell you.
It’s very important.

102
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:33,896
–Margaret...
–Yes?

103
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:36,271
He made 1:40.
How's that?

104
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,401
–Who made 1:40?
–Broadway Bill.

105
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,322
With Whitey. He
must weight at least 150.

106
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,197
There's a meeting tonight.

107
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:45,398
Finish dressing.

108
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:47,533
Let’s dock the meeting.

109
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:49,990
You take a bath?

110
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:51,447
Sure.

111
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,911
Smells horsy to me.

112
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,326
I'll take 4 if we
dock the meeting.

113
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:59,752
–Don't be silly.
–There's a full moon.

114
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,545
Let’s go out and sit
under it all night.

115
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:04,841
Or 2 nights, a week.
What do you say?

116
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,209
What’s eating you?

117
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,511
Same old bugs.

118
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,841
Father'd have a royal
fit if we didn't show up.

119
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:13,980
We've got to go.

120
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,141
Hang the meeting.
What difference does it make?

121
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:20,401
Your father'll do all the
talking, and we'll go:

122
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,644
Yes, J.L. Of course, J.L.

123
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:26,653
I've got a chronic pain in
my neck from nodding.

124
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:28,401
Don't be a fool.

125
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,995
Let’s go throw rock
as the meeting.

126
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:34,533
You say such stupid things.

127
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,949
Let’s do something else.

128
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:40,300
Why don't you get a zipper?

129
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:44,466
Some day you'll be calling the
meetings and won't want rocks.

130
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:46,343
They'd be absolute idiots.

131
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:49,677
Now hurry up, we're
going to be late.

132
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:52,339
–What about the moon?
–Come on.

133
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,680
–Margaret...
–Good heavens.

134
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:08,276
–I know I'm a pest.
–We'll never get there!

135
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,192
I'm serious.

136
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:13,201
What if I tell you
I'm miserable here...

137
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:15,411
dying a slow death?

138
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,531
Would you go away with me?

139
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,334
–Where to?
–Anywhere...

140
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:21,290
where I can make my own
living, do what I want.

141
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:24,333
The racing business, I suppose.

142
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:27,377
I'm not interested in
making paper boxes.

143
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:29,919
Do you really want me
to give up all this?

144
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,128
Why not?

145
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,847
Live not knowing where my next
meal's coming from.

146
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,302
–Wait for miracles.
–It’s better than this.

147
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:40,980
Doesn't it bother you
your husband’s a parasite?

148
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,980
That’s what I am.
There's no use kidding myself.

149
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,610
I've got a job cause I married you.

150
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,520
Father thinks you're
terribly clever.

151
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,821
That’s why the others are jealous.

152
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,900
He has great plans for
you, and someday...

153
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,780
Yeah, I know.
A crown prince.

154
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:59,793
–Good evening, Johnson.
–Evening, Mr. & Mrs. Early.

155
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:07,756
J.L.'s in the study.

156
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,888
–Good evening, J.L.
–Good evening.

157
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:21,971
Father.

158
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:37,322
Good evening, father.

159
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:39,662
Don't scold, I'm on time.

160
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,916
J.L.'s in the study.

161
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:53,339
You're not the smartest,
but the best–looking.

162
00:09:53,513 --> 00:09:54,294
Thanks.

163
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,307
Henry, Matilda.

164
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:02,937
Good evening, father.

165
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:05,629
–J.L.
–Good evening.

166
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:33,548
–Mrs. Brooks, Mr. Brooks.
–Hello, Johnson.

167
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:41,804
J.L.'s in the study.
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:47,975
–Good evening.
–Hello.

169
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:51,317
Hello, dad.

170
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:52,400
Hello, Princess.

171
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:55,323
–You're late.
–I know. It’s all my fault.

172
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:58,759
We'll get started.

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,543
Want to know it was?

174
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,500
You and Broadway were
talking too long.

175
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:12,298
Think I'll be thrown into
the Bastille?

176
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:13,878
You'll be lucky if not beheaded.

177
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:17,711
Before I go to the
chopping block...

178
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:20,960
could you dig up a
slug of whiskey?

179
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:22,224
Whiskey, in this house?

180
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:25,149
Doesn't anything change
around this mausoleum?

181
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:27,311
Yes, bedspreads and underwear.

182
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,726
That’s something.

183
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:54,503
Regarding the Acme
Lumber Company...

184
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,336
we bought it today.

185
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:02,427
And this morning it’s become
the Higgins Lumber Company.

186
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,143
I trust that meets
with your approval.

187
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:07,186
Sure. Naturally.

188
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,355
I trust it meets with yours.

189
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:13,807
Naturally, J.L.

190
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:19,736
For the present, it has
no active head...

191
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,320
and shall remain so...

192
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:24,409
until the one vacant chair here...

193
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:26,620
becomes suitably populated.

194
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:29,371
If you're referring to me,
you're wasting your time.

195
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:30,581
What’s that?

196
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,964
The man I marry won't
care for the lumber business.

197
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:37,879
–Don't be impudent.
–I'm sorry.

198
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,379
There's no further
discussion of business...

199
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,465
until after dinner.

200
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,245
I'm happy to say all the Higgins
enterprises are doing well.

201
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:16,399
All except the Higgins
Paper Box Company.

202
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,673
I'm sorry to report sales have
dropped to a dangerous extend.

203
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,596
I have the figures in front of me.

204
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:30,721
The first 3 months of
the fiscal year...

205
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:34,100
style 4, all colors,
dropped 14%.

206
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:38,434
The Higgins Special we
manufactured for 20 years...

207
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:41,905
with which we are nationally
identified...

208
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:43,860
22%.

209
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,743
The Company needs more
application of its management.

210
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:54,918
You can't expect a business
to flourish when the head...

211
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:57,378
is off gallivanting with a horse.

212
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:58,663
What’s your point?

213
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:00,123
–My point?
–Yes.

214
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,628
It’s quite obvious.

215
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:06,211
You came here 3 years
ago penniless and...

216
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,759
with a questionable background.

217
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:12,767
Some sort of association with
the racetrack business.

218
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,597
I was broadminded enough
to overlook that.

219
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:20,106
You and Margaret wanted
to get married and I approved.

220
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:23,230
I put you at the head of
the Higgins Box Company...

221
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:26,859
on of the largest and successful
of the Higgins enterprises.

222
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,871
You accepted that
responsibility with enthusiasm...

223
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:33,707
and I might even say gratitude.

224
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:36,953
You were the envy of
Mr. Early and Mr. Winslow.

225
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,755
Your first 2 years were successful.

226
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:43,466
But this past year the company
has suffered immeasurably.

227
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,471
I attribute it to one cause:
Neglect.

228
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,500
Shameful neglect.

229
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:54,264
Beginning tomorrow morning,
you will devote yourself...

230
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:55,813
exclusively to your business.

231
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,852
And get rid of that horse.

232
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:01,143
See that it’s done.

233
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:05,903
I've gone over the books of
the Acme Lumber Company.

234
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:11,238
Cash on hand and in
banks, $13,672 and 86 cents.

235
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:14,581
Accounts receivable, $32,842...

236
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:17,200
Wait a minute, Mr. Higgins.

237
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,620
I won't sell my horse.

238
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,409
I'm leaving Higginsville
in the morning.

239
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:24,789
Quiet!

240
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,539
What you say is true.
I have neglected the business.

241
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:31,100
The reason's simple:
I've always hated it.

242
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:33,807
It’s a good business.
It’s all right...

243
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:36,385
for you, or Mr. Winslow,
or Mr. Early.

244
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:39,234
They are suited to it,
and I'm not.

245
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:43,736
I may sound crazy, and maybe
I am but, you strike me the same.

246
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:47,274
Everything seems lopsided.
Higginsville, the Higgins family...

247
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,993
the Higgins enterprises.

248
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:53,831
We don't speak the same language.
You're interested only in...

249
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,785
accumulating money, expanding,
bobbling up the little ones.

250
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,744
You've just snatched Acme away
from some poor people.

251
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:03,246
–Hope it makes you happy.
–Careful with what you say!

252
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:07,469
You haven't taken a vacation in 40
years, rotting away in your kingdom.

253
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:09,759
If that’s your idea of high living...

254
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:11,888
it isn't mine, nor Margaret’s.

255
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,432
I wouldn't get rid of that
horse for you or anybody else.

256
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:17,389
Someday you'll take off
your hat to Broadway Bill.

257
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:21,726
I was broke when I came here, but
we want nothing from Higginsville.

258
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:25,692
Accept my resignation. I'll
wait for you in the car, Margaret.

259
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:28,230
You needn't bother.

260
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:45,173
The meeting's adjourned.

261
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,549
Why shouldn't I applaud him?

262
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,385
He should have gone long ago.

263
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:00,141
What sort of talk is this?

264
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:06,646
Your little monarchy
is fast folding up.

265
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,230
Your crown prince is through.

266
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,741
Stop this nonsense!

267
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:16,237
You're a strong and powerful
ruler, oh mighty king.

268
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:19,748
But you're not going to
crush him any longer.

269
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,329
What’s the matter with you?

270
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:25,334
You seem very happy
he's going.

271
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,836
I'm so happy I could shriek.

272
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:32,968
I could go out on
rooftops and shriek.

273
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:35,640
I prayed for him every night.

274
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:40,520
I hope he never sets foot
in Higginsville again.

275
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,759
Oh, father.

276
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,299
Look, look.

277
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:24,140
I feel 10 years younger.
How you feel?

278
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:31,982
<i>I'm headed for the last roundup.</i>

279
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:40,740
<i>The time has arrived.</i>

280
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:45,997
<i>I'm gonna leave sad times aside.</i>

281
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,869
<i>I'm headed for the last roundup.</i>

282
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:16,605
Hey, what’s up?

283
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:20,234
–What’s up?
–She's here, Gallant Lady.

284
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:21,528
Gallant Lady?

285
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,534
I gotta take a look.

286
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:30,872
Hello, Dan. Where've you
been all these years?

287
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,545
Hiding under rocks.

288
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:35,890
Bradshaw, come here.

289
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,555
–Where do you think you're going?
–Hello, Mike.

290
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,259
Get back there.

291
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:46,689
I can't bring Gallant Lady
out like this. She's too nervous.

292
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:47,811
Get off the platform.

293
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,642
Get back, will you?

294
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,107
Officer, do your duty.

295
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,220
Don't tell me what to do.

296
00:19:57,616 --> 00:19:58,815
Okay, Mr. Whitehall.

297
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:02,410
All right, get her out of here.
The pony first.

298
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:04,573
Bring her out.

299
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,752
Keep her head down,
watch her feet.

300
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,762
–That’s a beautiful animal.
–She'll win the Derby.

301
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:22,546
Make way.

302
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,630
Hello, Mr. Morgan.
Dan Brooks, remember me?

303
00:20:29,232 --> 00:20:30,809
–How are you?
–Fine, thank you.

304
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:33,855
–Who you betting on?
–Gallant Lady, of course.

305
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,277
Don't put your money down
yet, I may have some use for it.

306
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,819
–We were betting on Sun Up.
–Why not broadcast it?

307
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:50,201
Don't be a sucker, you
haven't a chance with that horse.

308
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:52,123
Try some small races first.

309
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:54,207
I'm coming back in style.

310
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:58,380
Nobody knows anything about
Broadway Bill, and if he wins...

311
00:20:58,761 --> 00:21:01,597
You don't believe he can
beat Gallant Lady, do you?

312
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,680
Why not?

313
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:04,806
–In his first race?
–I know what he can do.

314
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:06,221
How much is the entry?

315
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,854
I give up.

316
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:11,847
You must have rapped your
senses in paper boxes.

317
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:12,897
$500.

318
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,643
It’s a $25,000 race.

319
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,670
That’s cheap enough.

320
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:23,320
–You make out the check?
–Now?

321
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:26,823
You can do it the day before
the race, it’s in 2 weeks.

322
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:29,453
Yes, I'm having funds transferred.

323
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,828
You've got to nominate him before
6 o'clock, today.

324
00:21:34,213 --> 00:21:35,244
How much?

325
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:36,252
$50.

326
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:40,710
50?

327
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:43,261
I'll be right back.

328
00:21:46,935 --> 00:21:48,928
How much money you got?

329
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:50,348
–Money?
–Yeah, bring it out.

330
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:53,143
You've come to the wrong place.

331
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,811
I got this one, sad and
lonesome dollar.

332
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:59,192
I'm short 5. Bring it up.

333
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:00,145
–$5?
–Yes.

334
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:03,982
I'm the poorest man you
ever did see.

335
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:06,490
See that?

336
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:10,199
If there's any money there,
I'd be surprised.

337
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:14,329
–Bless my soul!
–That’s what I say.

338
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,628
Hey, boot, you ain't my
pocketbook no more.

339
00:22:21,846 --> 00:22:23,386
–Your receipt.
–Thanks.

340
00:22:23,762 --> 00:22:24,545
How about a stable?

341
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:28,215
I had one left and just gave
it to Gallant Lady.

342
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:30,849
Whitehall insisted on
having it to himself.

343
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:32,806
He'd take Gallant Lady
out of the race if...

344
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,855
Without Gallant Lady you
wouldn't have an attraction.

345
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:37,727
That’s it.

346
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,442
Go over and see Pop Jones.

347
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:42,855
He hangs out around the warehouse.

348
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,407
He's got an old barn.

349
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,403
–Okay, thanks.
–I'm awfully sorry.

350
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:50,705
Broadway Bill's been brought
up in a barn all his life.

351
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:52,659
–Good luck.
–Thanks.

352
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:58,128
What do we eat with? When I
get hungry, I get hungry.

353
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:02,714
When you're hungry, eat.
Can't go without food.

354
00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:04,509
Ain't gonna do my stomach no good.

355
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,172
Where we get the money
to buy it with?

356
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:10,432
We'll have to rely on the
old man with the whiskers.

357
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:12,891
–Who that?
–A miracle man.

358
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:16,519
When he puts his arm around
you, you're troubles are over.

359
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,210
A good man to meet up with.

360
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:46,345
Looks all right, Pop.

361
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,135
We've had some pretty
fine horses here.

362
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:50,136
Yeah?

363
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:52,715
–Who's the feed man here?
–Hey?

364
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:54,306
The feed man?

365
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,260
–Feed man?
–Yes.

366
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,304
Right here.

367
00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:59,230
I want a supply of
stuff sent in.

368
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:02,567
Some oats, bran, barley,
carrots and...

369
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:04,814
about 10 pounds of salt.

370
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:06,907
For cash or credit?

371
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:10,278
What do you mean?

372
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,619
Don't you trust me?

373
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:13,786
I don't know you...

374
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:17,326
I settle all my bills
at the end of the week.

375
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:21,119
–I need cash...
–And a couple of cots, Pop.

376
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:22,881
–Hey?
–A couple of cots.

377
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,420
–Cots?
–Something you sleep on.

378
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,829
To sleep here?

379
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:28,798
You don't think...?

380
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:33,221
You don't know it, but there's
the winner of the Derby.

381
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:34,971
Think I'll let him stay
by himself?

382
00:24:35,394 --> 00:24:38,515
I'll show you how you can
clean up a bankroll.

383
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,518
That horse is a sleeper.

384
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:42,650
–A what?
–A sleeper.

385
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:45,483
You want a cot for the horse too?

386
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:52,153
You hear Pop?
You're quite a kidder.

387
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:54,617
Come on, it’s feeding time.

388
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,240
–Whitey.
–Yes?

389
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:00,493
We gotta get to the bank
and make that deposit.

390
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:01,702
That’s for sure.

391
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,376
You still here?

392
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:14,470
We got to get that feed in.
Hurry up.

393
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:23,561
How was that?

394
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:27,567
He fell like a log.
A little slow though.

395
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,114
See his eyes?

396
00:25:29,282 --> 00:25:32,615
The old man with the whiskers
is working already.

397
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:34,906
Mr. Brooks!

398
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:42,451
Them clothes sure is elegant.

399
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:49,171
Think Colonel Pettigrew
will be impressed?

400
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,674
Colonel Pettigrew?
Who that?

401
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:53,886
A gentleman, Whitey.

402
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:56,464
With great understanding
and a soul.

403
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:59,342
A man to borrow money
from, if he has it.

404
00:25:59,521 --> 00:26:00,719
Borrow?

405
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:04,846
When I borrow I were my old
close, my rundown shoes.

406
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:08,527
–You got funny ideas.
–That’s the secret.

407
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:11,365
Never look down and out,
no matter how hungry you are.

408
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:15,232
You sure got the secret.
If he's got money, you'll get it.

409
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:18,534
All he's got to do is
look at them clothes.

410
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,372
Colonel Pettigrew.

411
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:26,664
I hope he's got 500 bucks.

412
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:36,673
–Colonel Pettigrew?
–Yes?

413
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:38,759
Take your feet off my chair.

414
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:40,500
Yes, my love.

415
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,769
A fortune.

416
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:48,309
Just by investing the sum of $50.

417
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:51,653
Stop dreaming.
Where you gonna get $50?

418
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:54,273
You can be very annoying.

419
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:58,199
Don't do us no good with those
phone numbers you're popping.

420
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:03,663
–That’s 5,000 you owe me.
–Double or nothing.

421
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:05,163
No you don't.

422
00:27:05,336 --> 00:27:08,172
Last season I had you
up to $80,000.

423
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,798
I traded, didn't I?

424
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:12,672
–For a buck and a quarter.
–But in cash.

425
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:17,134
–See if you can find a flaw.
–I read fairy tales at night.

426
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:19,383
It won't be when
I get the 50.

427
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,304
Then go to work.

428
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,766
I'll have it without work.

429
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:26,970
Where from, vinegar–puss?

430
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,105
–Colonel Pettigrew.
–Yes, my love.

431
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:32,353
A man who races
horses...

432
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,819
Dan Brooks,
a very dear friend of mine.

433
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,826
Anybody had $50 wouldn't
be a friend of yours.

434
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:42,122
Dan Brooks' got a thousand times
50 and never turned me down.

435
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,161
We're his guests at lunch today.

436
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:48,746
–He'll buy us lunch?
–At the Ritz Hotel.

437
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:50,585
Colonel!

438
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:54,900
My old and trusted friend!

439
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:55,541
Glad to see ya.

440
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,799
Meet my business associate Oscar
McGuire, known as Happy.

441
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:01,539
This is Dan Brooks.

442
00:28:01,227 --> 00:28:02,768
–How do you do?
–How are you?

443
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:04,478
Come on, sit down.

444
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,181
–It’s been a long time.
–Yes.

445
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:14,696
I'm a starving man.
Bring me the whole lunch.

446
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:17,739
I'll take the same, please.

447
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,190
The same for you, sir?

448
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:22,240
–I'm not here to make a speech.
–Right, sir.

449
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:24,122
Colonel, you look fine.

450
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,829
I hear you're rolling in wealth.

451
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,289
Just so–so.

452
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:30,288
Don't believe all
the stories you hear.

453
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:32,289
I was talking to the
boys and they agree.

454
00:28:32,464 --> 00:28:34,837
You know they exaggerate.

455
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,549
–How about you?
–Holding my own, that’s all.

456
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:42,910
Don't be modest. Racing
horses again, aren't ya?

457
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,928
Just keep my hand in.

458
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:46,224
That’s what I always said about you.

459
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:49,643
I always said: Dan Brooks?
A lad who'll come through.

460
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:51,309
How long does this go on?

461
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:55,733
Don't mind him, Friday the 13th.

462
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,732
Here's your soup...

463
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:02,868
and one more soup.

464
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,339
I'm glad I run into you, Dan.

465
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:12,664
I got a proposition to clean up
$160,000, and want you in on it.

466
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,711
–That so?
–Just for old time sake.

467
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:18,760
–That’s nice of you.
–Nothing at all.

468
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,300
I'll need a little financing though.

469
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,343
You'll need what?

470
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:27,762
With a start of $50,
I got a pile of...

471
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:32,856
You're not by any chance trying
to borrow $50 from me, are you?

472
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:35,150
Not borrow, exactly.

473
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:36,773
Wait a minute.

474
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:42,775
I came here to borrow $500.

475
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,708
–Don't tell me you're broke?
–Yes, totally.

476
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:53,295
–And you came...?
–Yeah.

477
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:55,289
–And I came...?
–Yeah.

478
00:29:56,674 --> 00:29:58,417
That’s the funniest!

479
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:10,634
What’s son funny about that?

480
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,482
–Everything satisfactory?
–Yeah.

481
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:25,864
–How broke are you?
–A veritable pauper.

482
00:30:26,663 --> 00:30:28,740
Not even enough for the meal?

483
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:32,451
–No. How about you?
–No.

484
00:30:34,255 --> 00:30:36,625
No, no, no!

485
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:40,503
Gentlemen, we're in a situation.

486
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:45,465
I haven't been thrown out
of a place like this in years.

487
00:30:48,434 --> 00:30:51,601
–You finished, gentlemen?
–Yes, quite.

488
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,182
–Finished?
–Yes.

489
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:55,262
Waiter.

490
00:30:56,652 --> 00:30:57,896
Come here.

491
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:02,318
What’s the idea?

492
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:05,657
I'll never come here again!

493
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:17,960
I'm so sorry.

494
00:31:19,507 --> 00:31:21,132
Here they are, red–hot.

495
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:30,263
–You're a good trader.
–It’s not the size I wanted.

496
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:33,390
What did you expect for a
hamburger, a telephone pole?

497
00:31:33,563 --> 00:31:35,721
I ain't kickin', but...

498
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:40,652
I ought to have a hat.

499
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:44,864
–Give you a Coke for the hat.
–Don't like Coke.

500
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,670
–A pie for the tie.
–Forget the tie.

501
00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:50,782
–You have to have dessert.
–Look.

502
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:53,539
We may be in for dinner tonight.

503
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:57,492
Spats. You should ought
to see me in spats.

504
00:31:57,672 --> 00:32:00,672
–There we go.
–I'm a sight for sore eyes.

505
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:04,200
–Another hamburger for the spats.
–Maybe tonight.

506
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:08,259
Okay, dinner tonight for
the hat, spats and tie.

507
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:09,345
It’s a deal.

508
00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:12,393
We got a little business.
You mind?

509
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:13,840
Oh, sure.

510
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:18,275
If you got anything for my wife...

511
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:20,814
Bring her in and we'll cut her up.

512
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:23,189
Smart guy, huh?

513
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:28,905
What now? Raising $500
is no child’s play.

514
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:30,321
You're a great disappointment.

515
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:34,741
From what you say, Broadway
Bill must be a superb animal.

516
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:37,759
If I can get him in that race.

517
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:39,290
Don't worry, that’s
as good as done.

518
00:32:39,461 --> 00:32:42,712
My time and wisdom are
devoted to your welfare.

519
00:32:42,882 --> 00:32:44,819
I'm sorry for you.

520
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:47,553
I got an ace in the hole, Edna.

521
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:50,839
A 50 to 1 shot.
You got to marry her first.

522
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,882
Who's Edna?

523
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:54,384
That vinegar–puss landlady
at the boarding house.

524
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,674
Why she expect to marry you?

525
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:59,210
I encouraged her. An
economic necessity, you know.

526
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:02,723
That’ll give you an idea
of what I've been driven to.

527
00:33:02,902 --> 00:33:04,230
Driven to, my eye.

528
00:33:04,404 --> 00:33:08,105
He'd rather make false love
to her than to go to work.

529
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:11,362
Trouble is he's got a landlady
in every town in the country.

530
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:14,156
It’s kept me in food and lodging
for years. And you too.

531
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:17,367
Do you think she'd fall
for a Ford truck?

532
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,288
That’s a perfect mating.

533
00:33:20,837 --> 00:33:22,099
Quiet!

534
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:24,498
I'm not kiddin', Happy.

535
00:33:24,673 --> 00:33:26,666
I got a Ford truck I
want to sell for $35.

536
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:29,169
But we need 500.

537
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:33,519
There are small races tomorrow
with $500 stakes.

538
00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:35,846
If we win one, we're home.
Broadway Bill is a breeze.

539
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,186
We need $35 for expenses. 10 for
a jockey, 25 for nomination.

540
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:41,432
An inspiration.
That’s as good as in the bag.

541
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:44,977
Vinegar–puss will own a Ford truck...

542
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:47,560
even if I have to make the
supreme sacrifice.

543
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:48,854
Bravo!

544
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,738
–It’s a long shot.
–Got to try it.

545
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,286
–Is this it?
–Yes. Sturdy and dependable.

546
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:05,126
–What is it?
–Does it look like a lawnmower?

547
00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:07,539
Might as well be.

548
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:11,666
Come on, beloved, Broadway
Bill's in the 2nd race.

549
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,597
Oh, darling!

550
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,110
I couldn't sleep last night
thinking of you.

551
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:20,722
–You make love so beautifully!
–That’s only the beginning.

552
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:21,893
Let’s go.

553
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:25,398
Give them plenty of start.
I can still hear them.

554
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:45,166
What’s the matter?
They've been there 10 minutes.

555
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:47,704
Having trouble with
Broadway Bill.

556
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:54,949
Turn him round there.
Hold him.

557
00:35:01,896 --> 00:35:03,639
Get back there.

558
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:08,521
Turn him around and
bring him in here.

559
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:12,322
–Guess he ain't ready yet.
–Sure he is.

560
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:15,534
Nervous in his first race.
He'll outrun them all.

561
00:35:15,744 --> 00:35:18,530
Hold him!
Don't let him through.

562
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:38,172
Number 5.

563
00:35:47,568 --> 00:35:49,809
That horse is half nuts.

564
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:51,856
Joe, we're going home.

565
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,987
That’s the end of Broadway
Bill in this race.

566
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,365
–Don't let him start again.
–AII right.

567
00:35:58,536 --> 00:35:59,865
Poor Dan.

568
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:02,909
I wonder what he's going to
do with Broadway Bill now.

569
00:36:14,427 --> 00:36:16,599
–Hello, darling.
–Hello.

570
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:19,465
–That’s a nice robe.
–Thank you.

571
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:28,769
–Any news from Dan?
–I had a letter from him.

572
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:29,974
What’s he say?

573
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:33,817
All about being sorry,
hopes I understand...

574
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:37,199
He still loves me,
wishes I'd join him.

575
00:36:39,286 --> 00:36:41,574
I think that was about all...

576
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:43,905
the rest of it’s about a rooster.

577
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:45,791
–Skeeter?
–What did you call him?

578
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,952
Skeeter.
I gave him that name.

579
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:52,376
Broadway Bill won't run
without him.

580
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:55,802
3 pages devoted to a rooster,
and one to me.

581
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:57,711
That’s a perfect division.

582
00:36:57,887 --> 00:37:00,177
–Did you send Skeeter to him?
–Of course not.

583
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:02,264
Broadway Bill needs him.

584
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:04,592
Don't be silly,
he'll be back soon.

585
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:07,960
Maybe this trip's
what he needed.

586
00:37:07,273 --> 00:37:10,393
–He'd never get it off his chest.
–Margaret...

587
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:12,521
I...

588
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:15,355
Please don't mind if I
talk to you about this.

589
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,565
I know it’s presuming of me
to give you advice.

590
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,159
–But, please don't do it.
–Do what?

591
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:23,278
Don't give him up.

592
00:37:23,956 --> 00:37:25,581
I haven't given him up.

593
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,583
But you're thinking about it.

594
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:32,380
Why not stay with him.
You'll not find someone as...

595
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:34,172
What are you getting
so excited about?

596
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:38,255
He loves you.
Doesn't that mean anything?

597
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:41,181
If Dan loves me,
he'll come back.

598
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,820
You're homesick, pal.

599
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:00,860
He won't perk up till
that rooster comes.

600
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:02,655
She gonna send him?

601
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:07,530
I don't know.
She hasn't answered my letter.

602
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:14,541
Skeeter!

603
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:15,960
Skeeter!

604
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,099
Princess!

605
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:23,128
God, it’s good to see you!

606
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:26,762
Look out for Skeeter!

607
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:29,605
I almost crushed him.
Hello, Skeeter!

608
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:31,929
Bill, here's your boyfriend!

609
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,690
Look who's come to see you.

610
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:38,648
I told you I'd bring him back.

611
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:39,487
Look, Bill.

612
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:42,574
Skeeter, get up there.

613
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,623
Take them out for a walk.

614
00:38:51,793 --> 00:38:53,335
He missed Skeeter?

615
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:56,255
He was down in the dumps.

616
00:38:56,423 --> 00:38:58,878
Horses get that way sometimes.
They get stuck on a mascot.

617
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,429
Princess, you're a lifesaver.

618
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,922
Let’s take a walk.

619
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:07,590
–Come on.
–Let’s take a walk.

620
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,427
Sit down and tell me
about it. How's Margaret?

621
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:14,432
Margaret?
She's all right.

622
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:16,849
–She's coming down?
–I'm afraid not.

623
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,731
She wanted to but
Matilda got the grip.

624
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:21,862
You know Matilda, always
sick at the wrong time.

625
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:25,115
That’s too bad.
You didn't have to come.

626
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:28,278
Margaret asked me to come.

627
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:32,666
She did? Well, give her a big
kiss for me when you get back.

628
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,501
I'm not going back.

629
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:35,873
What? Come on!

630
00:39:36,338 --> 00:39:39,541
You're taking the next
train back to Higginsville.

631
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:41,543
–Says who?
–Says me.

632
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,929
How much money you got?

633
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:48,922
I need $25 to enter Bill
in the race tomorrow.

634
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,887
I'll leave you some.

635
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:54,351
That’s me, big–hearted Dan.

636
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:57,643
–It’s not Higgins' money?
–No, it’s mine.

637
00:39:57,818 --> 00:40:00,440
I can't take Higgins' money.
Come on, beat it.

638
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,605
I'm staying till the
race is over.

639
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:05,402
You can't hang around
a racetrack town like this.

640
00:40:05,576 --> 00:40:07,818
Don't be so patronizing.

641
00:40:07,994 --> 00:40:11,364
–What’ll the emperor think?
–Hang the emperor!

642
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:14,199
Another revolutionary, huh?

643
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:18,769
First the crown prince consort,
then the little princess.

644
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:19,748
Lo the poor emperor!

645
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:25,793
You getting to be
quite a little dish.

646
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:30,804
–Will I have difficulty here?
–What do you think?

647
00:40:31,518 --> 00:40:34,851
Go out and get myself
a peasant and get married.

648
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,769
Don't do that, Princess.
Save yourself for me.

649
00:40:39,943 --> 00:40:44,710
When Margaret throws me out,
you and I'll hit the road together.

650
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:48,657
Nice idea, if my
peasant doesn't object.

651
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:52,161
Who is he?
That guy back home?

652
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:54,579
Come on, tell papa.

653
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:56,708
Don't be so smart!
He's perfect!

654
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,751
He's 11 feet tall, has no
ears and eats babies.

655
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:04,132
Princess!

656
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:06,878
Princess, look here!

657
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:08,963
You know me enough to
take a little kidding.

658
00:41:09,556 --> 00:41:12,889
Pay no attention to what
I say about your peasant.

659
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:15,101
You can marry anybody you like.

660
00:41:15,478 --> 00:41:18,396
I ought to sock you for
taking me so seriously.

661
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:20,972
Let’s give Bill a workout.

662
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:24,693
Hold it!

663
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:32,112
Put him in number 6, Joe.

664
00:41:32,413 --> 00:41:35,199
Let nobody through.

665
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,769
Hold it.

666
00:41:55,143 --> 00:41:58,228
Hold him back, now.

667
00:41:58,396 --> 00:41:59,677
Come on!

668
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,228
–He's getting it now.
–Bring him tomorrow.

669
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:08,318
See what that rooster makes?

670
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:11,699
Saddle the rooster.
Might have a better chance.

671
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:18,873
Put him in number 8.

672
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:23,121
Don't stop him this time.
I want to clock him.

673
00:42:23,297 --> 00:42:24,708
Back him up a little.

674
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:27,539
Come on!

675
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:34,889
–Bring him in the morning...
–Thanks

676
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:52,405
–What he do it in?
–1:37.

677
00:42:55,246 --> 00:42:57,737
Go get him and cool him out.

678
00:42:57,914 --> 00:43:00,322
Here comes a spy from
the Confederate Army.

679
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:04,961
What do you want, Mata Hari?

680
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:08,797
Glad you stopped around, Pop.
We just clocked him.

681
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:10,130
How about that feed bill?

682
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:12,543
–Know what he made it in?
–I don't give a hang!

683
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:14,969
I want that feed bill paid.

684
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:17,170
You worrying about a
little thing like that?

685
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:19,425
All I've been getting
is promises.

686
00:43:19,603 --> 00:43:21,679
I always keep my promises.

687
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:24,262
I can't pay my bills
with promises.

688
00:43:24,442 --> 00:43:26,730
If I don't get my money,
I'm going to the law!

689
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:30,318
Colonel Pettigrew will
guarantee all my bills. Right?

690
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:33,193
Of course I guarantee that.

691
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:35,193
How much is it, $1,000?

692
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:39,152
Don't pay it now. All Pop
wants is your guarantee.

693
00:43:39,331 --> 00:43:41,822
He's a stranger to me.

694
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:42,914
What?

695
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:46,253
You don't know Colonel
Pettigrew? Can you imagine?

696
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:48,248
He's one of the biggest men...

697
00:43:48,423 --> 00:43:51,922
I don't care!
I want my money!

698
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,420
I'll let you in on a good thing.

699
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:57,842
You know what Broadway Bill
made the mile in? 1:37.

700
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,807
He made the mile in 1:27!

701
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,349
Why tell him that?

702
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,186
I thought this was on the Q.T.

703
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,108
I have a good mind to
withdraw my $25,000.

704
00:44:08,277 --> 00:44:09,391
Don't get excited.

705
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,985
I didn't invest $25,000 for
you to slip information to...

706
00:44:13,157 --> 00:44:16,110
–a penny–antie feed man.
–Pop Jones is a friend of mine.

707
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:19,369
–I don't care if he's your brother!
–He can be trusted.

708
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:22,539
You can trust him, I won't!
I'm through!

709
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:25,875
–Please!
–Let him go, I'll take his share.

710
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:29,543
You've got $50,000 in already.

711
00:44:29,715 --> 00:44:33,380
Your horse is good enough.
I'll write you a check.

712
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:37,389
Hope I haven't caused you
any trouble, Mr. Brooks.

713
00:44:37,556 --> 00:44:40,889
If you know what’s good for
you, leave Dan Brooks alone.

714
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:54,239
<i>Anyone who looks to the</i>
<i>Lord will find heaven.</i>

715
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,780
<i>–Heaven.</i>
<i>–Heaven.</i>

716
00:44:56,951 --> 00:45:00,864
<i>I want to walk with the Lord...</i>

717
00:45:01,871 --> 00:45:07,458
<i>to heaven.</i>

718
00:45:07,836 --> 00:45:10,672
What’s going on here?

719
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:12,458
A little vocal gymnastics.

720
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:14,916
I mean you.
What are you doing here?

721
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,463
What’s it look like?

722
00:45:16,637 --> 00:45:19,507
Get back to your hotel.
You hang around here too much.

723
00:45:19,724 --> 00:45:21,800
Get washed, dinner will
be ready in a minute.

724
00:45:21,976 --> 00:45:23,885
Is this s girls seminary?

725
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,137
You'd better put on some pants.

726
00:45:26,313 --> 00:45:28,436
What about these?

727
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:30,599
–Where'd you get those?
–From your bag.

728
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,936
My only pair of dungarees.

729
00:45:33,112 --> 00:45:36,445
–Take them off.
–Mr. Brooks, please!

730
00:45:38,284 --> 00:45:40,322
You little mug, ya.

731
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:43,827
You're kind of cute in that.

732
00:45:44,123 --> 00:45:45,451
Sure, ravishing.

733
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:48,199
Sailors swoon at
the sight of me.

734
00:45:48,668 --> 00:45:50,126
You've grown up, too.

735
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:55,503
Some guy's gonna cop you
off. That peasant guy, maybe.

736
00:45:55,675 --> 00:45:59,295
Bill Taylor.
What about Bill Taylor?

737
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:00,717
I've got work to do.

738
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:02,217
When did you eat last?

739
00:46:02,516 --> 00:46:05,601
–Whitey says you don't eat.
–I have plenty to eat.

740
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:07,762
You can't win races
if you don't eat.

741
00:46:08,688 --> 00:46:09,934
I'm not running.

742
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:14,318
–Where'd you get these?
–Only a few supplies.

743
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:17,650
Oh, boy, Princess!

744
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,525
You're a little angel from heaven!

745
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:22,778
I married the wrong woman.

746
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:25,114
What will we open tonight?

747
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:27,664
Which one?

748
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:28,864
Oh...

749
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:30,585
the split pea soup
and the succoté.

750
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,164
The split pea soup...

751
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:35,376
and the succoté.

752
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:37,699
The split pea soup and the succoté.

753
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:40,925
<i>The split pea soup</i>
<i>and the succoté...</i>

754
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:43,422
<i>had a fight upon a timer.</i>

755
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,639
<i>Said the split pea soup</i>
<i>to the succoté:</i>

756
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:50,597
<i>Without corn you'd</i>
<i>just be lima.</i>

757
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,896
<i>–Oh, lima.</i>
<i>–Lima.</i>

758
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:59,353
<i>Without corn you'd</i>
<i>just be lima.</i>

759
00:46:59,907 --> 00:47:01,318
Get out of here!

760
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:02,945
What makes you so happy?

761
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,655
Happy?
Well, I'll tell you.

762
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:09,114
Because the old man with the
whiskers got his arm around me.

763
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:12,329
Because we entered Bill in
the $500 race tomorrow...

764
00:47:12,503 --> 00:47:14,210
with the money you
forced on me.

765
00:47:14,588 --> 00:47:18,751
Because I've got a winner,
and our troubles are over.

766
00:47:20,135 --> 00:47:25,599
<i>Gosh darn, you're not very</i>
<i>much yourself now.</i>

767
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,766
<i>You're not very</i>
<i>much yourself now.</i>

768
00:47:30,396 --> 00:47:32,768
–What rimes with self?
–Molasses?

769
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:37,311
I ought to let you have it.

770
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,695
You want to win that race?

771
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:44,115
You'll never know how much.

772
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:46,327
You will, I'm sure of it.

773
00:47:46,786 --> 00:47:50,202
–Got my fingers crossed.
–I know you have.

774
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:54,873
I got to get the money
to do things.

775
00:47:55,545 --> 00:47:58,297
Buy more horses, train them right.

776
00:47:58,507 --> 00:48:01,922
–I may even go in for breeding.
–Sounds wonderful!

777
00:48:02,385 --> 00:48:06,869
I'm going to have the finest
thoroughbreds in the country.

778
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:09,099
It’s starting to rain.

779
00:48:09,643 --> 00:48:11,221
Put Bradshaw on!

780
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:13,684
Mr. Whitehall.

781
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,726
How's Gallant Lady?
It’s raining hard.

782
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,938
Make sure all the windows
are shut.

783
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:23,983
We don't want her
catching any colds.

784
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:27,615
She's liable to catch pneumonia.

785
00:48:27,786 --> 00:48:31,286
She won't. She's as snug
as a bug in a rug.

786
00:48:31,456 --> 00:48:33,164
Right, I'll hop to it.

787
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:37,199
Check those windows.
Go on, hop to it.

788
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:40,210
Go was up. Dinner will
be ready in a minute.

789
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,215
Rain's coming in.

790
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:45,338
Margaret wants to be sure,
and it’s up to me.

791
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:47,673
–Rain's coming in.
–What?

792
00:48:47,847 --> 00:48:49,425
–The roof is leaking.
–The roof's leaking?

793
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,594
Yes, sir.

794
00:48:52,353 --> 00:48:55,936
Holy smokes!
It was clear a minute ago.

795
00:48:57,358 --> 00:48:58,936
That don't matter.

796
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,731
Whoa, Bill.

797
00:49:04,782 --> 00:49:07,710
Get up there and stuff that up.

798
00:49:07,242 --> 00:49:09,400
It’s getting on Bill.

799
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:11,987
Don't be long, dinner's ready.

800
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:20,458
There's another one to your left.

801
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,746
Stuff it up.

802
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,373
Hurry up!

803
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:32,599
Whoa, Bill!

804
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:34,931
Whitey!

805
00:49:35,103 --> 00:49:38,210
Come on down.
Help me close these doors.

806
00:49:42,485 --> 00:49:45,985
–What a storm!
–Close that door!

807
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:52,494
Whoa!

808
00:49:56,876 --> 00:49:59,581
Go to the Whitehall stables,
see if they got a stall for Bill...

809
00:49:59,753 --> 00:50:01,579
just for tonight.

810
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,579
Hurry up!

811
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:10,960
Whoa, Bill.

812
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:14,480
I'll get you dry.

813
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:22,771
These are soaking wet.

814
00:50:23,277 --> 00:50:25,684
We have to take them off.

815
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:38,905
Boss!

816
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:44,248
–Couldn't get a thing.
–What do you mean?

817
00:50:44,422 --> 00:50:46,250
Did you tell them this
is like a sieve?

818
00:50:46,425 --> 00:50:49,177
–Yes, but they run me out.
–They did?

819
00:50:49,512 --> 00:50:51,302
I did my best.

820
00:50:51,472 --> 00:50:54,556
–Keep Bill dry!
–Yes, sir.

821
00:50:57,853 --> 00:50:59,134
Where are you going?

822
00:50:59,646 --> 00:51:02,190
–What are you gonna do?
–Plug up those holes.

823
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:14,483
Here.

824
00:51:15,286 --> 00:51:16,782
Hot in here!

825
00:51:16,998 --> 00:51:19,702
Have a look at that thermostat.

826
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:25,583
Mike, turn down that radio.

827
00:51:27,759 --> 00:51:29,585
But real soft.

828
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:43,728
Cheer up, Gallant Lady, the
storm will soon be over.

829
00:51:47,485 --> 00:51:49,693
Whitey, get dry rags.

830
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:54,905
Poor darling.
You won't catch cold, will you?

831
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:56,614
Poor darling.

832
00:51:57,789 --> 00:51:59,119
It’s cold again.
What time is it?

833
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:02,369
–4 o'clock.
–Get some sleep.

834
00:52:03,293 --> 00:52:04,621
I'm wide awake.

835
00:52:04,795 --> 00:52:07,333
Go to bed.
You'll be all right tomorrow.

836
00:52:07,505 --> 00:52:09,628
Whitey, come take care of Bill.

837
00:52:10,885 --> 00:52:13,376
–You're going to bed.
–I don't want to.

838
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:14,965
Never mind. Come on.

839
00:52:22,896 --> 00:52:25,387
I don't want to.
I'm not sleepy.

840
00:52:25,565 --> 00:52:27,974
Stop arguing and get
off that wet coat.

841
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:30,231
Sit down.

842
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,199
You ought to be in your
hotel, nice and warm.

843
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:37,690
Lay down.

844
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:44,619
Thanks, Dan.

845
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,465
You're a sweet kid, Princess.

846
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:53,251
Dan.

847
00:52:54,929 --> 00:52:55,545
Yeah?

848
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,849
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

849
00:53:01,768 --> 00:53:02,764
Sure.

850
00:53:03,728 --> 00:53:04,643
Yeah.

851
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:43,762
Come on, doctor, right in here.

852
00:54:23,934 --> 00:54:25,344
Sick animal.

853
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:27,619
–Bad?
–Yep.

854
00:54:28,146 --> 00:54:31,266
Running a high fever.
Needs care and rest.

855
00:54:33,318 --> 00:54:34,860
Looks so pathetic.

856
00:54:37,155 --> 00:54:40,442
It may be some time
before he runs.

857
00:54:41,242 --> 00:54:43,733
I'll send the medicine back
with the boy.

858
00:54:44,288 --> 00:54:45,568
Doc!

859
00:54:45,873 --> 00:54:47,416
What about Saturday?

860
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,996
He's got to run.
That’s the big race.

861
00:54:50,168 --> 00:54:52,327
Saturday? I don't know.

862
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,130
Animals are very funny.

863
00:54:54,297 --> 00:54:57,382
Sometimes they snap
out of it like this...

864
00:54:57,802 --> 00:55:00,429
Don't take him out 'till
the fever's disappeared.

865
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:02,842
Even then, don't work him too
hard. Give his heart a chance.

866
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:06,349
Rest him up 'till the last
minute. Come on, boy.

867
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,436
I know.

868
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,646
It’s Alice I'm worried about.
What did she go for?

869
00:55:17,822 --> 00:55:20,443
She took him a pet rooster.

870
00:55:20,615 --> 00:55:22,193
Sounds insane!

871
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,195
That’s no place for her!
Little imp!

872
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:28,349
I sent her a telegram
ordering her to come home.

873
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:32,454
She replies: "Having a good time.
Back after races."

874
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,119
We got to get her back.

875
00:55:35,297 --> 00:55:37,373
Don't bother, she'll be back.

876
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:41,336
–And so will Dan.
–What makes you think so?

877
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:44,760
That’s why I came to see you.

878
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:47,885
I know others want to
manage the paper box factory.

879
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,349
Leave the others out of this.

880
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:53,356
They forget that I'm
the eldest daughter.

881
00:55:53,523 --> 00:55:55,728
I can't keep his job
open indefinitely.

882
00:55:55,902 --> 00:55:59,317
You owe it to me. It was
your fault that he left.

883
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,646
My fault he doesn't
like paper boxes?

884
00:56:02,324 --> 00:56:05,195
You thought you'd order him
around, like the others.

885
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:06,994
That’s very interesting.

886
00:56:07,663 --> 00:56:10,414
You may not know it,
but people are laughing at me.

887
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:14,324
They're saying I have
a horse for a rival.

888
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,378
And the horse won out.

889
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,123
I've got to stop that blabbering.

890
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:22,592
–You think he's coming back?
–I know he is.

891
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,503
Don't be so cock–sure.

892
00:56:25,264 --> 00:56:26,592
Go down there with him.

893
00:56:27,579 --> 00:56:28,931
That’s a fine attitude for you.

894
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:33,516
–He's your husband.
–When he's here at home.

895
00:56:40,655 --> 00:56:42,777
You won't let Dan down.

896
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:49,909
A cold can't stop you.

897
00:56:51,623 --> 00:56:53,829
Don't be a sickie.
Get up.

898
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:56,460
Get up.

899
00:56:58,338 --> 00:57:00,746
Come on, get up.

900
00:57:02,427 --> 00:57:03,920
Try to get up.

901
00:57:05,512 --> 00:57:07,967
Come on, get up!

902
00:57:14,353 --> 00:57:15,599
Come on, try.

903
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:18,771
Come on.

904
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:22,108
Ah, that’s it.

905
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:25,655
Come on, boy, come on.

906
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:32,284
Oh, Bill!

907
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:41,505
Come on, Bill.

908
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:47,427
Yes, get up.

909
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:49,134
Come on!

910
00:57:51,141 --> 00:57:52,422
Come on, boy!

911
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,594
That’s it, try.

912
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:56,597
Come on! There you go!

913
00:57:57,815 --> 00:58:00,567
Dan!

914
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,360
He's trying to get up!

915
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:05,940
–What?
–Look.

916
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:08,902
Bill, come on, boy. Come on!

917
00:58:09,284 --> 00:58:11,775
Come on, up you go.

918
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,496
Come on!

919
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:15,739
Come on, up you go!

920
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,289
Come on, up.

921
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,369
–Yes!
–That’s it, Bill!

922
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,293
How do you feel?

923
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,623
–He's up!
–That’s great, Bill!

924
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,210
Look at his eyes.

925
00:58:26,385 --> 00:58:30,400
–What happened?
–I gave him a talking to.

926
00:58:30,597 --> 00:58:34,969
Get some carrots.
Hey, Whitey!

927
00:58:34,268 --> 00:58:35,927
I know where they are.

928
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:38,936
Come on, Bill, eat carrots.

929
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,646
Look at him!

930
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:48,318
–He's eating, Princess.
–He'll be OK by Saturday.

931
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:49,570
Sure he will.

932
00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:53,867
I can't take a chance, Colonel.
Not until Saturday.

933
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,576
We got to dig up
$500 someplace else.

934
00:58:56,748 --> 00:58:58,905
I am entirely at your disposal.

935
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:01,327
We'll have to go out
and work for it.

936
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,460
Let’s not go too far.

937
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:07,820
Funny place to make money,
around a racetrack.

938
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,110
–I'll help.
–This is a man's job.

939
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:10,878
Colonel?

940
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:15,800
–lf I must, I must.
–Go dig up Paddy.

941
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,463
The shock'll kill him.

942
00:59:16,643 --> 00:59:19,978
–Any ideas?
–A hand full of them.

943
00:59:20,688 --> 00:59:24,556
Princess, take care of Bill.
We'll dig up that 500.

944
00:59:24,902 --> 00:59:26,728
Right on the dot.

945
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:28,487
Come on, dice.

946
00:59:29,364 --> 00:59:32,152
–10 is the point!
–What luck!

947
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,364
Yes, a 10!

948
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:36,913
Wait a minute!

949
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,199
Loaded!

950
00:59:41,376 --> 00:59:43,534
–You've had it!
–Cheater!

951
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,996
–What’s the name?
–Smith.

952
00:59:46,173 --> 00:59:48,498
–Mary Smith?
–Yes.

953
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,760
–The coat too?
–No, not yet.

954
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:55,338
I can give you something
for these.

955
00:59:57,351 --> 00:59:58,762
I'm all ready.

956
00:59:58,936 --> 01:00:00,809
–Pick your sucker.
–Yes, sir.

957
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,264
–Pick 'em and pluck 'em.
–I can't believe it yet.

958
01:00:04,442 --> 01:00:06,766
Remember all we get
goes to Broadway Bill.

959
01:00:10,197 --> 01:00:13,697
There's our first innocent victim.

960
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,442
Perfect. Okay, go to work.

961
01:00:16,996 --> 01:00:19,719
Pick 'em and pluck 'em.

962
01:00:25,128 --> 01:00:29,208
May I borrow you pencil
just for a moment.

963
01:00:30,217 --> 01:00:31,675
Yes, sir.

964
01:00:36,891 --> 01:00:40,940
–You own horses?
–Oh, yes.

965
01:00:40,394 --> 01:00:41,853
Colonel!

966
01:00:42,313 --> 01:00:46,474
The big boss says to scratch
your horse from the next race.

967
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:49,688
Scratch my horse?
What do you mean?

968
01:00:49,862 --> 01:00:52,199
The race is in the bag.
It’s all set for...

969
01:00:54,574 --> 01:00:56,697
Got him all set to win, hey?

970
01:00:56,869 --> 01:00:58,280
Told me not to tell anybody.

971
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,864
Thank you, son.

972
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:02,456
Thank you, my good man.

973
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,789
Couldn't you let a fella in on it?

974
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,331
–On what?
–The horse all set to win.

975
01:01:09,548 --> 01:01:12,170
No, no, I couldn't do that.

976
01:01:12,342 --> 01:01:14,465
I haven't won a race today.

977
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:17,900
These things are confidential.

978
01:01:17,181 --> 01:01:19,849
It too many people bet,
it brings the odds down.

979
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:23,137
I promise not to bet much.
Just enough to get even.

980
01:01:23,311 --> 01:01:24,889
Sorry, stranger.

981
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:28,222
I didn't want the Colonel
to see me.

982
01:01:28,442 --> 01:01:30,898
How'd you like to have
the name of that horse?

983
01:01:32,697 --> 01:01:36,445
–How would I like it?
–Cost you $25.

984
01:01:36,615 --> 01:01:38,905
–$25?
–Okay, forget it.

985
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,577
–Wait a minute.
–I could lose my job.

986
01:01:43,123 --> 01:01:46,621
–It’s a lot of money, but...
–Make it snappy.

987
01:01:46,793 --> 01:01:49,331
Here, $25.

988
01:01:49,588 --> 01:01:52,588
What’s the name of the horse?

989
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:53,706
–Doughboy.
–Doughboy?

990
01:01:53,885 --> 01:01:56,505
Don't be spreading it
all over the joint.

991
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,552
No, no! Doughboy!

992
01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:00,217
Doughboy!

993
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:04,224
Just got news from the stable.
Doughboy, a sure thing.

994
01:02:04,394 --> 01:02:06,351
Doughboy! Doughboy!

995
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:07,518
Doughboy!

996
01:02:07,856 --> 01:02:10,893
–I knocked him off 25 smackers.
–Excellent.

997
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:13,356
–What horse you give him?
–Doughboy.

998
01:02:13,528 --> 01:02:17,690
What a pity. Doughboy doesn't
have a ghost of a chance.

999
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:18,862
Doughboy!

1000
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:21,360
Put all you dough on Doughboy!
He can't lose.

1001
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:23,411
I got good information.

1002
01:02:23,623 --> 01:02:27,786
Bet it all on him,
your husband will be happy.

1003
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,338
$150 on Doughboy!
All the money I got in the world.

1004
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:36,465
–Half a bottle of Coke?
–Nothing.

1005
01:02:36,635 --> 01:02:40,467
–$10 for my watch?
–I can't accept that.

1006
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:44,139
Bet all your money on Doughboy.

1007
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:46,516
The master told me
he can't lose.

1008
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,143
Wait 'till I tell my wife
about this.

1009
01:02:55,695 --> 01:02:57,356
I beg your pardon.

1010
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:00,697
You want to make money?
Put all you've got on Doughboy.

1011
01:03:01,284 --> 01:03:02,614
Thank you, son.

1012
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,286
Madam, allow me.

1013
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:14,204
You remind me so much
of my mother.

1014
01:03:14,382 --> 01:03:18,166
Just for that, I'll give you
a tip on Doughboy.

1015
01:03:18,677 --> 01:03:20,503
Thank you, madam.

1016
01:03:20,762 --> 01:03:24,927
I just got the lowdown on
the next race: Doughboy.

1017
01:03:29,563 --> 01:03:31,603
–Place your bets.
–10 on Doughboy to win.

1018
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:32,853
50 on Doughboy to win.

1019
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,606
I just came from the stables.
It’s Doughboy!

1020
01:03:39,739 --> 01:03:42,822
–AII I got on Doughboy!
–He's gonna win.

1021
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,349
25! 25!

1022
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:54,204
25 on Doughboy to win!

1023
01:04:03,431 --> 01:04:04,842
Doughboy! Doughboy!

1024
01:04:06,434 --> 01:04:07,679
Where's Doughboy?

1025
01:04:14,565 --> 01:04:17,219
Milked by my own con.

1026
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:22,565
–Whitey?
–Yes?

1027
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:31,621
That’s what you get
for trying to cheat.

1028
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:34,329
I don't cheat,
except when I have to.

1029
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:38,204
–This was for Broadway Bill.
–A noble cause.

1030
01:04:38,382 --> 01:04:40,838
You won't have to do it anymore.

1031
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:44,217
I got $120 dollars here.

1032
01:04:44,554 --> 01:04:46,963
You won at shooting dice,
you understand.

1033
01:04:47,141 --> 01:04:47,887
Yes.

1034
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,967
If you tell Mr. Brooks,
I'll break your neck.

1035
01:04:50,143 --> 01:04:52,302
–I won't.
–I'll have more tomorrow.

1036
01:04:52,646 --> 01:04:53,974
And the next day.

1037
01:04:54,148 --> 01:04:57,659
460, 465, 470, 475...

1038
01:04:57,233 --> 01:04:58,811
480, 485, 490...

1039
01:04:58,985 --> 01:05:01,393
495 and 500.

1040
01:05:01,572 --> 01:05:03,813
–Eureka!
–And 10 to celebrate.

1041
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:07,773
–Who made it?
–We owe White a vote of thanks.

1042
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:09,496
Hooray!

1043
01:05:09,664 --> 01:05:10,610
To Whitey...

1044
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:13,780
who definitely saved
us from decease.

1045
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:16,914
–Take a bow.
–Thank you.

1046
01:05:17,463 --> 01:05:18,494
Your contribution wasn't much...

1047
01:05:18,672 --> 01:05:22,123
but for your story on Doughboy,
we forgive you.

1048
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,670
First time I see a guy sucked
in by his own gag.

1049
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,637
I'm just a child of impulse.

1050
01:05:31,726 --> 01:05:34,217
For your moral support, a kiss.

1051
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,893
Thank you, kind sir.

1052
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,219
Come on.
Where's your coat?

1053
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,559
It was warm, so I
left it at the hotel.

1054
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:42,567
You ready?

1055
01:05:42,737 --> 01:05:44,362
–The beer garden?
–I say we do.

1056
01:05:44,532 --> 01:05:45,527
Then I'm ready.

1057
01:05:45,699 --> 01:05:49,282
But first to the secretary to
deposit the gold, and then beer.

1058
01:05:49,494 --> 01:05:51,202
Come on.

1059
01:05:55,668 --> 01:05:57,210
No ladies allowed in here.

1060
01:05:57,378 --> 01:06:00,829
She's not a lady.
She's a friend.

1061
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,460
The winner of the Derby
arrives with the entry.

1062
01:06:04,217 --> 01:06:06,126
–Fine, come in.
–Let’s all go in.

1063
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,509
Good night!

1064
01:06:53,224 --> 01:06:54,601
Good night to everyone!

1065
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,153
Hello, Princess.

1066
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:15,576
Hello.

1067
01:07:16,873 --> 01:07:20,769
<i>The split pea soup</i>
<i>and the succotash...</i>

1068
01:07:20,251 --> 01:07:25,449
<i>fell in love one spring</i>
<i>and summer.</i>

1069
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,458
<i>The split pea soup</i>
<i>caught the succotash...</i>

1070
01:07:31,637 --> 01:07:36,217
<i>on the rest of the</i>
<i>hardware dormer.</i>

1071
01:07:36,393 --> 01:07:37,936
Must you do that?

1072
01:07:38,478 --> 01:07:39,889
No.

1073
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:42,434
That’s a relief.

1074
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,445
No you don't.

1075
01:07:57,809 --> 01:08:03,166
<i>On the way home the succotash</i>
<i>had a pack on like a donkey.</i>

1076
01:08:03,795 --> 01:08:07,579
What’s the matter?
You staggering?

1077
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:10,708
Where's Bill?

1078
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:13,885
Where's Bill?

1079
01:08:14,347 --> 01:08:15,591
Whitey!

1080
01:08:16,391 --> 01:08:17,221
Whitey!

1081
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,264
Where's Bill, Whitey?
Whitey!

1082
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:24,512
Mr. Brooks!
They took him away!

1083
01:08:24,692 --> 01:08:27,100
–Who took him?
–Mr. Jones, the feed man.

1084
01:08:27,278 --> 01:08:29,270
Come with the sheriff.
He had attachment papers.

1085
01:08:29,447 --> 01:08:31,355
–What papers?
–He just took him.

1086
01:08:31,532 --> 01:08:32,645
Why didn't you stop him?

1087
01:08:32,824 --> 01:08:36,609
They had a rope to his neck
and tied him to an automobile.

1088
01:08:36,787 --> 01:08:39,872
That could kill him.
You should have stopped them!

1089
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:41,582
I couldn't keep up with them.

1090
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,659
–Where'd they go?
–I don't know.

1091
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:45,662
–I'll find him.
–Dan, wait!

1092
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,460
Wait a minute!

1093
01:08:50,134 --> 01:08:51,212
Dan!

1094
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,844
Come on, you stubborn mule!

1095
01:09:02,854 --> 01:09:03,886
What are you doing?

1096
01:09:04,481 --> 01:09:05,180
Hey!

1097
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:10,395
What are you doing
to that horse?

1098
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:14,317
Wait a minute.

1099
01:09:14,824 --> 01:09:16,984
Take your hands off me.

1100
01:09:17,161 --> 01:09:18,192
Come on!

1101
01:09:19,538 --> 01:09:21,115
Take it easy!

1102
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:23,618
You'll cool off in there.

1103
01:09:24,918 --> 01:09:28,667
–Take care of my horse.
–You won't need it.

1104
01:09:28,922 --> 01:09:30,997
–He's gone screwy.
–What’s eating him?

1105
01:09:31,175 --> 01:09:34,295
Someone attached his horse
and he's gone crazy.

1106
01:09:49,902 --> 01:09:52,108
He's been hollering
all night for you.

1107
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:53,193
Hello, Princess.

1108
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:56,364
–I got you some food.
–That’s wonderful.

1109
01:09:56,533 --> 01:09:57,993
I'll be back in a few minutes.

1110
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:01,779
–Some coffee?
–Boy, could I use this.

1111
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,405
They wouldn't let me
in all night.

1112
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:07,707
Is there anything we can do?

1113
01:10:08,796 --> 01:10:10,752
No, we're sunk.

1114
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:13,666
–I asked father for...
–What?

1115
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,845
Don't be angry.
It didn't make any difference.

1116
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,179
He said, if you wanted to
make good, this is your chance.

1117
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:22,427
He's right, too.

1118
01:10:26,813 --> 01:10:29,221
I bet the bunch back there are
getting a laugh out of this.

1119
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:32,400
–Don't give up.
–There isn't anything we can do.

1120
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,903
It’s just not my cards.
If I could only get out of here...

1121
01:10:37,658 --> 01:10:38,820
Maybe I could...

1122
01:10:42,287 --> 01:10:43,747
It doesn't matter.

1123
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:46,622
We didn't wish hard enough.

1124
01:10:46,792 --> 01:10:49,331
Whiskers didn't hear us.
Cute hat, where'd you get it?

1125
01:10:49,502 --> 01:10:51,449
What are you going to do?

1126
01:10:52,672 --> 01:10:54,297
What are you going to do?

1127
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:59,711
Make paper boxes.
Margaret’ll like that.

1128
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:02,640
Don't do that. You'll
never forgive yourself.

1129
01:11:02,806 --> 01:11:05,216
I promised her I'd come back.

1130
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:08,596
I'm hardly a success here,
I'll go back to paper boxes.

1131
01:11:08,771 --> 01:11:10,564
It isn't too late,
something might happen.

1132
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,974
This is not the day for miracles.

1133
01:11:13,194 --> 01:11:15,150
I want to get Pittsburgh.

1134
01:11:17,448 --> 01:11:19,854
–What’s the price?
–Okay, 2,000 on Soto.

1135
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,775
I want to get Buffalo.

1136
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:24,618
Buffalo, like on the nickel.

1137
01:11:24,787 --> 01:11:27,789
Denver 2,200, Frisco 1,800,
New Orleans 3,000, Dallas 12.

1138
01:11:27,957 --> 01:11:30,819
–What’s the total?
–Close to 20,000.

1139
01:11:30,251 --> 01:11:32,243
We haven't even started.
What’s the average?

1140
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:34,377
–7 to 1.
–7 to 1?

1141
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:37,958
I'm gonna shoot the works
on that horse of yours.

1142
01:11:38,135 --> 01:11:39,829
You sure he's all right?

1143
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,420
–Except Gallant Lady...
–Forget Gallant Lady.

1144
01:11:41,595 --> 01:11:43,560
He's a synch.

1145
01:11:44,975 --> 01:11:47,347
Get your bets down, please.

1146
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,676
The big race of the day.

1147
01:11:49,854 --> 01:11:52,609
Gallant Lady favorite, 2 to 1.

1148
01:11:52,233 --> 01:11:53,395
Sunup, 4 to 1.

1149
01:11:53,567 --> 01:11:56,436
Gallant Lady, 30 to 15 to win.

1150
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:57,985
Any bets on Broadway Bill?

1151
01:11:58,154 --> 01:12:00,563
They're laying off like poison.

1152
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:03,860
100 to 1, pick up some
sucker money.

1153
01:12:04,203 --> 01:12:05,863
Broadway Bill, 100 to 1.

1154
01:12:08,373 --> 01:12:11,541
Okay, Broadway Bill
is 100 to 1.

1155
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:13,667
A 100 to 1 shot.

1156
01:12:15,672 --> 01:12:19,337
Broadway Bill!
Where you've been all my life?

1157
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,399
Shut up, will you?

1158
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:23,302
I'll give my bookie heart failure.

1159
01:12:23,471 --> 01:12:25,962
He's gonna buy my Easter
outfit and don't know it.

1160
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:28,386
–Number 4.
–It’s for you, Mae.

1161
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,840
It would be.

1162
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:32,130
That guy in 4 is gonna
drive me screwy.

1163
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:33,648
You ought to be thrilled.

1164
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:34,681
One of the richest
men in the world.

1165
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:39,186
Where is everybody?
Nurse!

1166
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:41,362
What’s all the excitement?

1167
01:12:41,532 --> 01:12:44,568
Where's that doctor? I've
got to get out of here.

1168
01:12:44,743 --> 01:12:46,402
Relax.

1169
01:12:46,578 --> 01:12:49,199
All this fuss for a broken ankle.

1170
01:12:50,123 --> 01:12:53,658
Reading these magazines is
making an idiot out of me.

1171
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:54,914
Forget them.

1172
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:58,707
Tell me something.
How do you pass your time?

1173
01:12:58,882 --> 01:13:00,341
I flirt with the angels.

1174
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,548
–You what?
–Bet on horses.

1175
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,886
Bet on horses.
That keep your mind occupied?

1176
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,592
My mind occupied,
my blood boiling...

1177
01:13:08,768 --> 01:13:11,139
my nerves frazzled,
and my purse empty.

1178
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:12,854
Why do you do it?

1179
01:13:13,104 --> 01:13:15,512
–I'm an idiot, like you.
–What?

1180
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:18,609
You control empires, I
bet on horse tails.

1181
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:21,980
So long, money bags,
and keep your shirt on.

1182
01:13:23,823 --> 01:13:25,402
Come here.

1183
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:29,279
–What horse you betting on?
–Broadway Bill.

1184
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:31,704
Broadway Bill?

1185
01:13:31,997 --> 01:13:34,786
–Why?
–100 to 1 is reason enough.

1186
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,788
100 to 1? How much money you bet?

1187
01:13:37,962 --> 01:13:39,791
–Two smackers.
–Two what?

1188
01:13:39,965 --> 01:13:42,336
Two dollars, the family fortune.

1189
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:46,506
Bet two smackers for me.

1190
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,510
–You?
–Better than reading this trash.

1191
01:13:51,685 --> 01:13:53,511
Give me something to think about.

1192
01:13:53,688 --> 01:13:57,103
–How do we know we've won?
–Watch the papers tomorrow.

1193
01:13:57,274 --> 01:13:58,554
All right, here.

1194
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:00,726
–This is funny.
–What’s funny?

1195
01:14:01,194 --> 01:14:05,323
JP Chase, the richest man,
betting 2 bucks on a nag.

1196
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:07,783
Sure you can spare it?

1197
01:14:07,952 --> 01:14:11,652
Put those 2 bucks on Buffalo
Bill, or whatever his name is.

1198
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:19,710
Here's a hot one. JP Chase bets
2 bucks on Broadway Bill.

1199
01:14:19,878 --> 01:14:21,872
JP Chase? That’s funny!

1200
01:14:22,966 --> 01:14:25,921
JP Chase bets $2 on
Broadway Bill.

1201
01:14:26,949 --> 01:14:28,134
–He does?
–Broadway Bill!

1202
01:14:30,569 --> 01:14:33,925
Chase bets 2 Cs on
Broadway Bill.

1203
01:14:34,145 --> 01:14:35,721
That’s a scream.

1204
01:14:35,895 --> 01:14:38,386
–Who's Broadway Bill?
–A horse, dummy.

1205
01:14:38,565 --> 01:14:42,184
Betty, JP Chase bets 2 Cs
on Broadway Bill.

1206
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,734
That’s a scream.

1207
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,484
JP Chase bests 2 Cs
on Broadway Bill.

1208
01:14:46,657 --> 01:14:48,863
Broadway Bill?
I had a hunch on that plug.

1209
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,533
Joe, JP Chase just bet 2 Cs
on Broadway Bill.

1210
01:14:52,704 --> 01:14:53,654
Broadway Bill?

1211
01:14:53,831 --> 01:14:56,832
Hey, JP Chase just bet 2 Gs
on Broadway Bill!

1212
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,819
JP Chase? What do you know?

1213
01:14:59,252 --> 01:15:01,791
–That’s good enough for me.
–Give me that phone.

1214
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,998
20,000 bucks, can you imagine that?

1215
01:15:04,175 --> 01:15:06,712
If JP chucks it down,
he must know something.

1216
01:15:06,885 --> 01:15:08,842
Must be hot.
He bet 50,000 smackers.

1217
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:10,127
100,000? You're kidding.

1218
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:13,721
–I heard 200 grand.
–On Broadway Bill?

1219
01:15:13,893 --> 01:15:17,640
–Something like a 1<i>l</i>4 of a million.
–On a 100 to 1 shot too.

1220
01:15:18,646 --> 01:15:20,889
I'll give you a hot one.
Broadway Bill.

1221
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:22,725
2 bucks on Broadway Bill for me.

1222
01:15:22,902 --> 01:15:24,693
2 bucks worth of Broadway Bill.

1223
01:15:24,862 --> 01:15:26,250
Broadway Bill, on the nose.

1224
01:15:26,197 --> 01:15:27,738
I'm a friend. Broadway Bill.

1225
01:15:27,905 --> 01:15:29,185
<i>Bet on Broadway Bill.</i>

1226
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:30,860
Don't you do it.

1227
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:31,947
Don't spread it around.

1228
01:15:32,118 --> 01:15:33,578
Broadway Bill. Ed told me.

1229
01:15:33,787 --> 01:15:34,865
No one knows yet.

1230
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,699
I'll pay you back Tuesday.

1231
01:15:36,247 --> 01:15:37,493
We need it for the rent.

1232
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:38,911
We can get married.

1233
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:39,500
Can't miss.

1234
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:40,413
100 to 1.

1235
01:15:40,586 --> 01:15:41,119
Broadway Bill.

1236
01:15:41,293 --> 01:15:42,420
JP Chase?

1237
01:15:42,212 --> 01:15:42,877
Broadway Bill?

1238
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:44,541
–Broadway Bill!
–Broadway Bill!

1239
01:15:45,298 --> 01:15:47,890
2 bucks on Broadway Bill.

1240
01:15:47,301 --> 01:15:48,960
$200 on Broadway Bill.

1241
01:15:49,136 --> 01:15:50,713
Where can I bet
on Broadway Bill?

1242
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:55,930
My brother in Denver says
to bet on Broadway Bill.

1243
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,893
For Broadway Bill.

1244
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,891
$2 for me, $2 for my brother
and $2 for my wife.

1245
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,230
I got a telegram.
He's gonna win.

1246
01:16:04,484 --> 01:16:08,199
I thought it was my mother.

1247
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:11,525
–$10 on Broadway Bill.
–$2 on Broadway Bill.

1248
01:16:11,699 --> 01:16:13,408
Make that 60 to 1.

1249
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,661
It’s 60 to 1.

1250
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,909
Eddie, Chicago on the phone.

1251
01:16:18,123 --> 01:16:22,286
What’s the matter?

1252
01:16:22,837 --> 01:16:25,872
Sure we're going to shoot
the works on Sunup.

1253
01:16:26,256 --> 01:16:29,506
Who? Broadway Bill
hasn't got a chance!

1254
01:16:29,844 --> 01:16:32,761
What do I care what a bunch
of yokels are doing?

1255
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:35,551
The better I'm gonna like it.

1256
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:38,180
Sunup goes from 4 to 1
to 12 to one.

1257
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:41,685
The day of the race it could
be 20 to 1. A good bankroll.

1258
01:16:42,729 --> 01:16:47,356
We just worry about Gallant
Lady, and that’s taken care of.

1259
01:16:47,778 --> 01:16:49,770
Yeah, it’s all taken care of.

1260
01:16:49,988 --> 01:16:52,444
Keep in touch with me.

1261
01:16:52,617 --> 01:16:54,739
You guys make me sick!

1262
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:55,521
Get out of there.

1263
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,863
–Detroit on the phone.
–Okay, give it to me.

1264
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:03,239
Okay, Detroit.

1265
01:17:04,668 --> 01:17:07,587
I wish you guys would forget
about Broadway Bill.

1266
01:17:07,881 --> 01:17:10,798
We're 12 to 1 instead of 4 to 1.
What more do you want?

1267
01:17:10,966 --> 01:17:13,541
You guys squawk your heads off.

1268
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,471
Forget it!

1269
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:17,128
–Boss!
–What?

1270
01:17:17,306 --> 01:17:20,225
One less rival. Broadway
Bill's gonna be scratched.

1271
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:23,390
–What do you mean scratched?
–I just heard it.

1272
01:17:23,563 --> 01:17:24,726
What happened?

1273
01:17:24,899 --> 01:17:27,104
–I thought it was good news.
–What happened?

1274
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:30,630
The guy that owns him
is in jail.

1275
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,103
In jail?

1276
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,680
With him out, Sunup
odds go back to 4 to 1.

1277
01:17:35,243 --> 01:17:37,779
I got to get a hold of that guy...

1278
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,326
–Dan Brooks.
–Dan Brooks!

1279
01:17:40,539 --> 01:17:44,702
Got to put Broadway Bill
back in. Wait till I get back.

1280
01:17:44,877 --> 01:17:46,251
Good luck.

1281
01:17:47,671 --> 01:17:49,378
He's in number 3.

1282
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:53,960
–Hello, Morgan.
–Hello.

1283
01:17:54,177 --> 01:17:58,340
–Changed your headquarters?
–Thought a change would do me good.

1284
01:17:58,599 --> 01:18:00,390
Why'd you scratch your horse?

1285
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,301
That’s a long story.

1286
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:05,931
–Creditors get unreasonable.
–You got me in an awful mess.

1287
01:18:06,355 --> 01:18:08,314
I bet a lot on that horse.

1288
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,439
–Did you see him work out?
–Sure.

1289
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:14,101
He's a great horse, if only
they'd realize that.

1290
01:18:14,282 --> 01:18:18,444
When your in a jam, come to me.
How much you owe?

1291
01:18:19,369 --> 01:18:21,326
Only 150.

1292
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:24,332
Don't keep a secret like
that from a pal. Here.

1293
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,324
–You got any whiskers?
–What?

1294
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:30,380
Skip it.

1295
01:18:31,465 --> 01:18:33,587
I don't know how to thank you.
I'll pay you back...

1296
01:18:33,759 --> 01:18:36,630
Forget it.
I'll get it back when he comes in.

1297
01:18:36,804 --> 01:18:38,712
He will. You just watch him.

1298
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:41,131
–You got a jockey?
–Not yet.

1299
01:18:41,309 --> 01:18:43,846
How about Williams?

1300
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:45,644
Can you get him?

1301
01:18:45,811 --> 01:18:49,313
He'll do what I tell him.
We're just like that.

1302
01:18:49,483 --> 01:18:50,764
Go down to the Captain.

1303
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:54,774
Pay his fine or whatever,
but get him right out.

1304
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:57,104
–That’s grand.
–You're all fixed.

1305
01:18:57,282 --> 01:18:59,854
I'm gonna break down
and weep on your shoulder.

1306
01:19:00,286 --> 01:19:04,412
Don't thank me. I expect
to clean up on this.

1307
01:19:04,622 --> 01:19:06,331
You deserve it.

1308
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,420
–So long.
–Thanks, Morgan.

1309
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,702
–I'll send Williams over.
–Thanks, Mr. Morgan.

1310
01:19:16,301 --> 01:19:20,859
–Bill 10, Sunup 12.
–12, huh?

1311
01:19:20,262 --> 01:19:21,673
–We bet?
–No, we wait...

1312
01:19:22,265 --> 01:19:23,972
Find out about New York.

1313
01:19:24,143 --> 01:19:25,519
–Broadway Bill, 8 to 1.
–What’s Sunup?

1314
01:19:25,685 --> 01:19:27,893
15 to 1.

1315
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:31,514
When it gets to 20 to 1,
have him ring me back.

1316
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:35,692
You know what Broadway
Bill is doing? 6 to 1.

1317
01:19:35,862 --> 01:19:36,858
Why worry?

1318
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,438
There's dough on that horse.
Where's it from?

1319
01:19:39,617 --> 01:19:43,695
Somebody knows
something, I tell you!

1320
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:47,157
–Maybe it’s the Greek.
–The Greek's with us.

1321
01:19:47,332 --> 01:19:50,916
–Where's it come from?
–Use your brain.

1322
01:19:51,859 --> 01:19:54,122
Every bet on Broadway
Bill is a 2–buck bet.

1323
01:19:54,297 --> 01:19:56,171
Does that sound like wise money?

1324
01:19:56,341 --> 01:19:58,251
It was 50 to 1.
Meat for suckers.

1325
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:01,489
Barbers, maids scrambled
to get aboard.

1326
01:20:01,221 --> 01:20:04,838
Before you know, all losers
hock their undershirts.

1327
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:08,635
I've seen it happen a million
times. Sack money...

1328
01:20:08,813 --> 01:20:09,761
I still don't like it.

1329
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:12,560
You'd be happier if you knew
Williams will ride Bill.

1330
01:20:12,733 --> 01:20:15,650
Williams rides Bill and
Roberts Gallant Lady.

1331
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:18,569
–Happy?
–I worried for nothing.

1332
01:20:18,738 --> 01:20:20,778
You can be happy all afternoon.

1333
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,359
Sunup is 20 to 1 in Chicago.

1334
01:20:22,534 --> 01:20:24,527
How much will they handle?

1335
01:20:24,703 --> 01:20:25,948
–15,000.
–Okay.

1336
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,340
New York, 20 to 1.

1337
01:20:27,206 --> 01:20:28,913
How much can they handle?

1338
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:30,576
–20,000.
–Okay!

1339
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:33,122
Chicago, 15 grand,
New York, 20 grand!

1340
01:20:33,293 --> 01:20:34,956
Princess, come here.

1341
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,502
This is Ted Williams,
the jockey.

1342
01:20:37,675 --> 01:20:40,295
Is that bandage okay?

1343
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:42,377
Here's that great fella.

1344
01:20:42,554 --> 01:20:44,140
Ain't got much test.

1345
01:20:44,347 --> 01:20:46,756
Got plenty on the track.

1346
01:20:46,932 --> 01:20:49,305
I heard he threw
his last jock.

1347
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:52,515
He'll take the lead right
off the jump.

1348
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:54,431
–Don't hold him back.
–No?

1349
01:20:54,608 --> 01:20:58,393
It drives him crazy
to be held back.

1350
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:00,777
He's got plenty of wind.

1351
01:21:00,948 --> 01:21:02,619
Sounds great.

1352
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,655
Go get dressed,
got to be on time.

1353
01:21:05,828 --> 01:21:08,340
Take power cause you're
riding a winner!

1354
01:21:08,206 --> 01:21:08,786
Sure.

1355
01:21:08,956 --> 01:21:12,456
Man with the whiskers, I thank you!

1356
01:21:12,626 --> 01:21:14,783
Princess, we can't lose!

1357
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:17,417
I feel like dancing!

1358
01:21:17,756 --> 01:21:19,131
–So do I.
–Go ahead.

1359
01:21:19,382 --> 01:21:21,542
<i>–The split pea soup...</i>
–Got her doing it.

1360
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:24,430
<i>Fell in love one spring</i>
<i>and summer.</i>

1361
01:21:24,511 --> 01:21:29,305
<i>The split pea soup caught</i>
<i>the succotash on a dormer</i>

1362
01:21:29,475 --> 01:21:31,304
You want an honest race?

1363
01:21:31,479 --> 01:21:33,636
I don't like this implication
of my jockey.

1364
01:21:33,813 --> 01:21:37,479
We spend a fortune every
year on detectives. Why?

1365
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:39,690
To break honest.

1366
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:41,689
If not, we'll close up the track.

1367
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:45,231
What makes you think
my boy's involved?

1368
01:21:45,408 --> 01:21:47,615
I had Morgan and
his men trailed.

1369
01:21:47,787 --> 01:21:50,703
I was determined to know
what he had up his sleeve.

1370
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:54,574
I found out.
It’s your jockey, Roberts.

1371
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:57,992
That’s the works.

1372
01:21:58,171 --> 01:22:01,256
–How much we got down?
–100,000, average 12 to 1.

1373
01:22:01,425 --> 01:22:03,500
Over a million bucks.

1374
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:06,421
It’s the one we've been waiting
for, and I'll take care of you.

1375
01:22:07,681 --> 01:22:10,386
Boss, Roberts has been suspended.

1376
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,302
He ain't gonna ride Gallant Lady.

1377
01:22:13,186 --> 01:22:14,217
How'd you find out?

1378
01:22:14,395 --> 01:22:16,639
I saw it on the bulletin.
They got Bobby North.

1379
01:22:17,606 --> 01:22:20,979
Somebody smelled a rat.
This is a mess.

1380
01:22:20,277 --> 01:22:22,981
I knew this was too
good to be true.

1381
01:22:28,869 --> 01:22:30,149
On Gallant Lady.

1382
01:22:31,162 --> 01:22:32,706
Gallant Lady.

1383
01:22:33,373 --> 01:22:35,829
$50 on Gallant Lady.
She's gonna win.

1384
01:22:36,376 --> 01:22:39,578
–$50 on Gallant Lady.
–$50 on Gallant Lady.

1385
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,460
<i>The horses are now</i>
<i>at the padder.</i>

1386
01:22:49,847 --> 01:22:51,923
You'll do your stuff, Bill.

1387
01:22:53,185 --> 01:22:55,391
Don't let the fever bother you.

1388
01:22:55,938 --> 01:22:57,729
Doc said you were all right.

1389
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:02,309
You know what this race
means to us.

1390
01:23:09,658 --> 01:23:10,823
Saddle your horses.

1391
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:31,713
I'm interested in one horse.
Sunup, number 5.

1392
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:33,634
Beat him and you win this race.

1393
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:35,386
He's a tough customers.

1394
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,478
He might try anything.

1395
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,438
Gallant Lady must win this race.

1396
01:23:40,649 --> 01:23:43,569
He won't get away with a thing.

1397
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:46,154
One horse you gotta beat,
Gallant Lady.

1398
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,148
I don't care how.

1399
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:50,283
You've won lots of races.

1400
01:23:50,449 --> 01:23:53,239
Win this one, $5,000 for you.

1401
01:23:53,453 --> 01:23:56,904
Use your head, or anything
else necessary.

1402
01:23:57,829 --> 01:23:58,824
You understand?

1403
01:23:59,292 --> 01:24:00,372
Yes, sir.

1404
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,247
If anyone gets in front of you...

1405
01:24:03,546 --> 01:24:05,704
swing around on the outside.

1406
01:24:05,965 --> 01:24:08,717
Don't worry about loss of time.

1407
01:24:08,886 --> 01:24:09,716
One thing you got to remember.

1408
01:24:09,886 --> 01:24:13,301
–You listening?
–Yes.

1409
01:24:13,474 --> 01:24:15,520
Don't hold him back.

1410
01:24:15,307 --> 01:24:17,384
I've got to win this race.

1411
01:24:18,619 --> 01:24:21,145
My whole future depends on it.

1412
01:24:21,814 --> 01:24:24,770
I can't explain it to you but,
good luck.

1413
01:24:24,944 --> 01:24:25,809
Good luck to you.

1414
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:29,353
Jockeys up.

1415
01:24:33,286 --> 01:24:35,323
Remember, it’s up to you.

1416
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:38,622
If your smart,
you'll cop this race.

1417
01:24:38,832 --> 01:24:41,786
Well, Bill, it’s up to you now.

1418
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,832
What are you shaking for?

1419
01:24:48,882 --> 01:24:50,470
Who's shaking?

1420
01:24:50,969 --> 01:24:54,600
<i>It’s a thrilling sight,</i>
<i>the grandstands are packed...</i>

1421
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:56,220
<i>the blood pressure is</i>
<i>running high and...</i>

1422
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:59,970
<i>and the great question today is...</i>

1423
01:24:59,269 --> 01:25:01,511
<i>who will win the Derby?</i>

1424
01:25:01,689 --> 01:25:05,851
<i>Until a few days ago, Gallant</i>
<i>Lady was an outstanding favorite.</i>

1425
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:08,350
<i>Since then, for</i>
<i>some mysterious reason...</i>

1426
01:25:08,528 --> 01:25:12,112
<i>Broadway Bill has received</i>
<i>terrific support.</i>

1427
01:25:12,283 --> 01:25:16,280
<i>Overnight, the odds went down</i>
<i>from 100 to 1, to 6 to 1.</i>

1428
01:25:16,453 --> 01:25:18,529
<i>That’s what makes horse racing.</i>

1429
01:25:18,706 --> 01:25:21,541
If he wins the race
he's not coming back?

1430
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:23,582
Wouldn't you like to know.

1431
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,295
That’s the way, Skeeter.

1432
01:25:35,139 --> 01:25:37,427
Let’s go see a good race.

1433
01:25:49,862 --> 01:25:51,569
<i>They're going on to the track.</i>

1434
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,246
Won't be long now.

1435
01:26:10,423 --> 01:26:13,542
We've got to win. If we don't,
it’s "good–bye, Colonel".

1436
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:15,712
–What’s the matter?
–My head’s in a noose!

1437
01:26:15,887 --> 01:26:18,675
I promised I'd marry her
if Broadway Bill loses.

1438
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:20,390
You can always change your mind.

1439
01:26:20,685 --> 01:26:23,173
She made him put it in writhing.

1440
01:26:23,354 --> 01:26:26,971
It can't be done. I'm slightly
married already.

1441
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:29,936
–With who?
–To another in Deytonia.

1442
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:31,604
In a moment of...

1443
01:26:31,779 --> 01:26:35,630
I'm sure that time the horse
forgot what he came for.

1444
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:37,399
I've got to get back
to that skylark.

1445
01:26:37,577 --> 01:26:40,577
–So long and luck.
–Thanks.

1446
01:26:40,747 --> 01:26:43,350
The guy that puts his dough...

1447
01:26:43,207 --> 01:26:46,207
on them actually believes
in fairies.

1448
01:26:46,918 --> 01:26:48,792
Pay no attention to him.

1449
01:26:49,296 --> 01:26:50,327
Good luck.

1450
01:26:51,672 --> 01:26:52,835
Thanks, Princess.

1451
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:54,586
Well, here we go.

1452
01:26:55,344 --> 01:26:58,960
I may be on my way back
to Higginsville in a while.

1453
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,173
Don't think about that.
You'll win.

1454
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:06,306
–What’s the matter with you?
–Nothing.

1455
01:27:07,648 --> 01:27:08,810
Nothing.

1456
01:27:08,983 --> 01:27:10,262
Good luck, darling.

1457
01:27:20,286 --> 01:27:21,399
There's Sunup!

1458
01:27:23,456 --> 01:27:25,448
–There's your horse!
–Shut up and sit down.

1459
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:28,625
I'm going to go see
him start.

1460
01:27:28,793 --> 01:27:30,869
I wish I knew how
this was gonna end.

1461
01:27:35,801 --> 01:27:38,899
Broadway Bill look all right.
Why worry?

1462
01:27:40,597 --> 01:27:42,673
I don't think he was
ever sick.

1463
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,189
He looks all right.
I got a bet on him.

1464
01:27:53,985 --> 01:27:55,564
I got plenty on him.

1465
01:27:55,738 --> 01:27:57,944
Excuse me, lady.

1466
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,524
Did you bet on Broadway Bill?

1467
01:28:01,701 --> 01:28:03,908
If you didn't, you're crazy.

1468
01:28:05,163 --> 01:28:06,538
<i>They're getting ready.</i>

1469
01:28:06,832 --> 01:28:08,706
$2 on Broadway Bill.

1470
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:11,704
–Broadway Bill.
–Fill this out.

1471
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:16,336
May as well go crazy
with the rest of the world.

1472
01:28:16,509 --> 01:28:17,671
–What do you want?
–What?

1473
01:28:17,842 --> 01:28:20,297
–Your bet?
–Broadway Bill on the nose.

1474
01:28:21,846 --> 01:28:23,439
Your bet?

1475
01:28:23,224 --> 01:28:25,631
–Gallant Lady, of course.
–Me too.

1476
01:28:33,108 --> 01:28:37,229
<i>Now they're at the barrier</i>
<i>of a mile and a quarter.</i>

1477
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,238
<i>A sport of kings, one</i>
<i>of the oldest sports.</i>

1478
01:28:40,533 --> 01:28:44,197
<i>Gallant Lady, the favorite.</i>
<i>Sunup, a great money horse.</i>

1479
01:28:44,368 --> 01:28:47,489
<i>Broadway Bill, who threw</i>
<i>his jockey...</i>

1480
01:28:47,914 --> 01:28:49,289
Johnson!

1481
01:28:49,332 --> 01:28:53,497
<i>Some say Dan Brooks has a</i>
<i>screw loose for entering him.</i>

1482
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:55,293
<i>But we'll keep an eye on him.</i>

1483
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:56,627
Any Scotch in the house?

1484
01:28:57,591 --> 01:28:59,548
–No, sir.
–Get some.

1485
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:02,511
–Get some!
–Yes, sir.

1486
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,837
<i>I think they're ready</i>
<i>for the bell now.</i>

1487
01:29:10,313 --> 01:29:13,640
Keep your eyes open.
Anything's liable to happen.

1488
01:29:13,231 --> 01:29:15,520
Don't forget to break, Bill.

1489
01:29:32,126 --> 01:29:33,323
He's in the vanguard!

1490
01:29:35,253 --> 01:29:38,600
<i>Broadway Bill first,</i>
<i>Gallant Lady second!</i>

1491
01:29:38,215 --> 01:29:42,378
Come on, Bill! Oh, boy!

1492
01:29:42,636 --> 01:29:44,949
That’s the baby!

1493
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:53,261
Let go of his head!
I told him not to hold him!

1494
01:29:59,987 --> 01:30:02,442
You're holding him, .
You're holding him!

1495
01:30:02,613 --> 01:30:03,859
You're holding him!

1496
01:30:04,329 --> 01:30:05,444
Gallant Lady's got it made.

1497
01:30:09,454 --> 01:30:12,989
Old man with the whiskers.
Put your arm around me!

1498
01:30:13,917 --> 01:30:15,246
Hey!

1499
01:30:23,385 --> 01:30:24,927
I'll throw you over the fence!

1500
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:26,798
You're crazy!

1501
01:30:27,979 --> 01:30:29,136
Come on!

1502
01:30:29,765 --> 01:30:31,510
Let go of that bit!

1503
01:30:33,229 --> 01:30:35,199
Let go of him!

1504
01:30:39,149 --> 01:30:40,430
Let go of that bit!

1505
01:30:47,952 --> 01:30:49,659
Come on, Bill!

1506
01:30:51,788 --> 01:30:54,161
You can win!

1507
01:31:01,172 --> 01:31:03,332
Come on, Broadway Bill!

1508
01:31:03,509 --> 01:31:05,547
Yeah, Broadway Bill!

1509
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:08,909
<i>Broadway Bill is coming up fast.</i>

1510
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:10,469
<i>He's 4th by half length.</i>

1511
01:31:19,731 --> 01:31:21,192
Broadway Bill!

1512
01:31:21,818 --> 01:31:25,188
Friend of the lost souls, come on!

1513
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,900
Come on, Bill, that’s it!

1514
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:39,372
<i>They're on the last stretch.</i>

1515
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:48,671
Come on, Bill!

1516
01:31:52,641 --> 01:31:54,100
Come on, Bill!

1517
01:31:54,851 --> 01:31:56,131
Get out of the way!

1518
01:31:56,688 --> 01:31:57,636
Come on, Bill!

1519
01:31:58,814 --> 01:32:01,766
–Pull back, are you crazy?
–I can't hold him!

1520
01:32:01,984 --> 01:32:03,358
Come on, Bill!

1521
01:32:11,243 --> 01:32:12,618
Come on, Sunup!

1522
01:32:22,212 --> 01:32:23,541
Go, Bill!

1523
01:32:27,509 --> 01:32:28,707
Come on!

1524
01:32:41,398 --> 01:32:44,648
Yes, sir!
He did it!

1525
01:32:51,448 --> 01:32:52,444
Bill!

1526
01:32:59,457 --> 01:33:01,368
<i>There's a horse down.</i>

1527
01:33:02,377 --> 01:33:06,375
<i>Don't invade the track.</i>

1528
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:10,962
<i>Everybody keep back,</i>
<i>you know how dangerous it is.</i>

1529
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:14,305
<i>Get back now.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1530
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:17,426
<i>Don't you know that’s</i>
<i>dangerous? Keep off the track!</i>

1531
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:22,765
Let me in!
That’s my horse!

1532
01:33:24,108 --> 01:33:26,100
Get back, everybody.

1533
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:29,146
What happened?

1534
01:33:31,407 --> 01:33:32,984
This way, Doc.

1535
01:33:34,743 --> 01:33:37,530
Are you a doctor? A veterinary?
What happened?

1536
01:33:37,704 --> 01:33:38,569
What happened, Doc?

1537
01:33:39,664 --> 01:33:44,956
<i>Broadway Bill fell. He was</i>
<i>over, he won, and then dropped.</i>

1538
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,755
–What’s the matter with him?
–Just a minute.

1539
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:53,595
Too much for him,
burst his heart.

1540
01:33:54,262 --> 01:33:56,600
He was dead when he hit the dirt.

1541
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:57,426
Too bad!

1542
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,220
–A picture, please.
–Get back.

1543
01:34:00,936 --> 01:34:03,143
Get those men out of here.

1544
01:34:03,314 --> 01:34:05,389
Everybody, back.

1545
01:34:09,652 --> 01:34:10,768
Tough break, kid.

1546
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:15,193
These old eyes have seen
some great horses, but I...

1547
01:34:15,743 --> 01:34:17,403
<i>Off the track, everybody.</i>

1548
01:34:19,789 --> 01:34:20,324
Princess.

1549
01:35:12,297 --> 01:35:13,462
Dan.

1550
01:35:18,264 --> 01:35:19,543
Don't cry.

1551
01:35:40,327 --> 01:35:42,699
The winner of the Imperial Derby.

1552
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:50,918
We are grateful to Mr. Brooks
for permitting us to...

1553
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,619
lay Broadway Bill to rest
on these grounds.

1554
01:35:54,466 --> 01:35:57,384
So that his fine spirit
may always be with us.

1555
01:35:57,970 --> 01:36:02,134
What he did yesterday was a
lesson in courage and loyalty.

1556
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:05,889
The ideal and purpose
of horse racing...

1557
01:36:06,619 --> 01:36:08,469
is to teach us lessons like this.

1558
01:36:08,896 --> 01:36:10,557
If we profit by them...

1559
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:13,899
then racing is something
more than a sport.

1560
01:36:14,944 --> 01:36:17,731
Broadway Bill must
never be forgotten.

1561
01:36:19,574 --> 01:36:20,689
Mr. Brooks.

1562
01:38:11,311 --> 01:38:13,600
I'll have to say
good–bye now, Dan.

1563
01:38:14,523 --> 01:38:15,981
Going home?

1564
01:38:19,153 --> 01:38:20,777
But you won't.

1565
01:38:21,779 --> 01:38:22,895
No.

1566
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:25,283
I guess I'm on my way.

1567
01:38:30,581 --> 01:38:31,659
Good luck.

1568
01:38:32,416 --> 01:38:34,788
You've been swell,
Princess, you've helped me.

1569
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,240
Thanks, Dan.

1570
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:39,202
There's Dad.

1571
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:48,386
–Dan!
–JL.

1572
01:38:48,599 --> 01:38:49,926
Margaret come down with you?

1573
01:38:50,141 --> 01:38:51,518
No.

1574
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:57,475
She counted on your coming
back to Higginsville now that...

1575
01:38:57,649 --> 01:38:59,228
Yeah, I see.

1576
01:38:59,777 --> 01:39:02,101
She figures this is
a stroke of luck.

1577
01:39:02,947 --> 01:39:05,104
I'm not going back, JL.

1578
01:39:10,662 --> 01:39:11,742
Well...

1579
01:39:11,913 --> 01:39:15,163
Margaret will be a hard girl
to leave Higginsville, Dan.

1580
01:39:18,753 --> 01:39:20,248
Maybe she shouldn't.

1581
01:39:21,798 --> 01:39:23,376
Maybe you're right.

1582
01:39:24,759 --> 01:39:27,380
Nothing seems to matter
anymore.

1583
01:39:27,555 --> 01:39:29,511
Take Alice back home.

1584
01:39:57,792 --> 01:40:00,810
That’s my decision and it’s final.

1585
01:40:00,253 --> 01:40:02,810
What’s gotten over you?

1586
01:40:02,338 --> 01:40:05,505
I understand selling the
factory when Dan and I were

1587
01:40:05,676 --> 01:40:08,546
divorced, but selling all
of them is absurd.

1588
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:11,838
–Now the ironworks.
–And the bank.

1589
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:12,881
Not the bank!

1590
01:40:13,225 --> 01:40:14,470
Not the bank!

1591
01:40:14,768 --> 01:40:17,939
In 2 years you got
rid of everything.

1592
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:20,141
It’s mine to get rid of
if I want to.

1593
01:40:20,565 --> 01:40:22,974
I'm giving them back to the
people that founded them.

1594
01:40:23,277 --> 01:40:26,693
I'm a man, not a whale that
gobbles up minos.

1595
01:40:26,863 --> 01:40:29,484
–You're forcing us out.
–What’ll become of us?

1596
01:40:29,783 --> 01:40:32,720
You'll have to go to work.

1597
01:40:32,244 --> 01:40:34,367
Go out and find jobs.

1598
01:40:34,831 --> 01:40:38,163
I wan son–in–laws that are
men, not dependents.

1599
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:39,537
I want...!

1600
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:56,716
It’s Dan!

1601
01:40:59,896 --> 01:41:01,604
It’s Mr. Brooks.

1602
01:41:02,274 --> 01:41:06,141
"Release the princess from
that tower", he said.

1603
01:41:15,954 --> 01:41:18,493
Don't be an idiot like
your sister. Go on.

1604
01:41:32,970 --> 01:41:34,300
–Hello!
–Dan!

1605
01:41:34,222 --> 01:41:35,420
Hello!

1606
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:39,101
Hello, Princess!
It’s good to see you.

1607
01:41:39,354 --> 01:41:42,220
Look, Broadway Bill II...

1608
01:41:42,898 --> 01:41:44,960
and the Princess.

1609
01:41:45,568 --> 01:41:46,599
Dan!

1610
01:41:49,863 --> 01:41:51,572
We're headed for Letonia.
Come on.

1611
01:41:51,907 --> 01:41:52,938
Good–by, Dad!

1612
01:41:56,911 --> 01:41:58,110
Hello, Whitey.

1613
01:42:07,171 --> 01:42:09,130
Wait for me!

1614
01:42:10,305 --> 01:43:10,536
