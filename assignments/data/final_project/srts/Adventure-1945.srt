1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:33,976
Why don't you put some
ant powder on that, cap?

3
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:37,401
Thanks, seńor.

4
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,868
It's closed.
Come on!

5
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:42,998
Well, it says
"ladies," don't it?

6
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,627
Aah!

7
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,180
Seńor patterson, the door i have closed!

8
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:51,143
And i have opened.
Put some hinges on him.

9
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:52,312
You can never tell
when i might want

10
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:54,108
to bring a lady
in here, rudolfo!

11
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:56,405
Si, seńor.
Si, seńor.

12
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,415
Nick! Rudolfo's letting
this place run down.

13
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,963
Yes, sir, a little worse every 10 years.

14
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:04,425
I've begun to
notice it myself.

15
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,929
Minnie's calling
you, mr. Patterson.

16
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,432
Who?

17
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:10,439
Just a ship,
miss maria.

18
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,817
Oh.

19
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,945
Dear old minnie toper. Champagne.

20
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:14,199
Champagne.

21
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:17,456
Champagne to say hello, and
champagne to say good-bye.

22
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,878
Not today, seńor.

23
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:55,883
We don't shake for the
last one, like always?

24
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,553
Not like always.

25
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:02,523
Oh. Well, maybe you got 'em
loaded up a little, huh, nick?

26
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,904
Ok, roll 'em.

27
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,749
11. Ioaded
with luck!

28
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,174
Mm-hmm. Well, maybe if
i speak real nice to 'em,

29
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:15,012
maybe they'll talk
back to me, huh?

30
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:19,063
They talk to you,
and cry for me.

31
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,277
Well...

32
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,532
say you love me. I'll
make believe i believe it.

33
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,120
I love ya.

34
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:28,670
Aw, harry, try saying
"i love no girl more."

35
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:30,675
How many times we
said good-bye, pal?

36
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,970
3.

37
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:34,267
3. what do you know.
3 good-byes to one gal.

38
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,105
I'm just a one-woman
man, right, nick?

39
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,235
Yes, seńor.

40
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:40,240
Well, here's to the girl
i'll never love more.

41
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:43,122
What's the matter?

42
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:45,377
I don't know this girl
you never love more-

43
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,880
i hear her
laughing at me.

44
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:48,886
Sure. Minnie. She's always laughing.

45
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,058
I hope it's minnie.
Here's to minnie.

46
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,197
Minnie ain't fooling.
Good-bye, nick.

47
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,826
Hasta la vista,
harry.

48
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:00,622
So long, everybody!

49
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,042
Adios, amigo!

50
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:03,587
Adios!

51
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:05,133
Adios, seńor.

52
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:16,118
Hail and
farewell.

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,039
I'm going to
miss you, harry.

54
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:20,378
Never to see
your face again.

55
00:04:20,462 --> 00:04:24,221
Black with sin and grinning
like the bad angel himself.

56
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,309
It breaks me up inside
to see you leave, harry!

57
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:29,651
That's fine, mudge. Let's
get aboard. We're sailing.

58
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:33,076
Ooh, i'm sailing?
Aye, aye, bosun!

59
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:35,039
Shipmates by the
grace of heaven!

60
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:36,960
You boys did good
this trip.

61
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:42,599
Abandon! Cast off the
lines! Fare thee well!

62
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,896
Why do sailors
drink so hard?

63
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,068
Oh, that is a
complicated matter.

64
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,657
A boy who is going to
sea for the first time

65
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:51,411
should be thinking
of simple things.

66
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:52,498
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,127
Your family, who
love you on earth.

68
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,967
Your mother and father,
who love you in heaven.

69
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:59,598
I have them in my
thoughts, great-grandfather.

70
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,023
I'm ramon estado.

71
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:06,197
This is my great-grandfather,
seńor ramon estado.

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,493
Hi.

73
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:10,207
The first mate told me i
was to be under your command.

74
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,544
Ok, get aboard.

75
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:12,588
Thank you.

76
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:14,927
Adios.
Go with god.

77
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,266
With god.
Adios, grandfather.

78
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:25,035
I know my great-grandson
will be safe with you.

79
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,455
Sure, sure.

80
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:29,003
I was a sailor
myself, at one time.

81
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,049
Why didn't you keep
that kid on the farm?

82
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,388
The sea is a good
school also, is it not?

83
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:35,518
Oh, yes.
Swell, grandpa.

84
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,651
We turn out some awful
smart seagulls and sharks.

85
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,537
Ok, baby,
i'll hurry back.

86
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,958
I'll wait, harry.

87
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,088
I'll be like a statue facing the sea.

88
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,383
I won't even move!

89
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,931
Ha ha! Don't move
until i'm back.

90
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,564
I won't.

91
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,572
Get rid of
this gangway!

92
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:58,909
Aye.
Muchachos!

93
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,161
Let go everything!

94
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:03,460
Stand by,
fore and aft, all hands!

95
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:06,009
Harry, l-i'm just
a little bit stung.

96
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,559
Yeah, yeah. Get on
those head lines!

97
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:13,318
Sir, has this ship
been properly blessed?

98
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,824
Oh, sure, sure. I bless
the old tub myself,

99
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,912
morning, noon,
and night.

100
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,936
And don't throw 'em
on the decks!

101
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,857
Stow 'em below,
while you're at it!

102
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:03,773
And i say it's
a proven fact

103
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,026
that morality
among british seamen

104
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:06,195
is higher than
among yanks.

105
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:08,159
You limeys are played out, that's why.

106
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,790
Oh yes? We still hold
dominion over palm and pine.

107
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:13,505
Yeah, and under every tree
sits a yank with a dame!

108
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:15,259
Ha! Gus
won't face the facts.

109
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:16,512
What facts?

110
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:18,600
The facts of morality
among seamen, that's what.

111
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:21,358
I say british sailors has
higher morals than yanks.

112
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,988
Here. Here's the
statistics what proves it

113
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:26,036
in black and white.
Where's the page?

114
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,878
Oh, harry, that was me
proof! Black and white!

115
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:31,549
Black and green,
pink and yellow,

116
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,804
i can't run a deck gang
with you waving books around.

117
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,224
Yeah!

118
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:36,644
Pay him, gus.

119
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:38,064
So why do i
pay him?!

120
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:40,862
I've seen you both in port. Pay him.

121
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:42,951
Ha! Thanks,
harry.

122
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:53,310
You washing again?

123
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:55,524
Oh, hello, harry.

124
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:58,154
It kind of comforts a
man to scoop up seawater

125
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:01,204
that's full of the sins of
the world and put soap in it.

126
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,958
You've got sin
on the brain.

127
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,715
Well, it'd be hard to
explain to you, harry,

128
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,931
but a man sure feels dirty
after he's been in port

129
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:10,769
and done the things
i done.

130
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:13,107
Never mind that.
You owe me 60 pesos.

131
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:14,485
I'll give you a
chance to get even

132
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,906
before you go
on watch.

133
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,660
Before i go on
watch, harry?

134
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:19,706
Thanks, harry.

135
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:26,556
I put you on
the paint detail.

136
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,439
Oh, i got to get this
clock back together again.

137
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:31,485
You've lost
half the parts.

138
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:34,576
Couldn't fix it,
anyway.

139
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,794
Oh, harry! Ain't you gonna
trust me to fix nothing?

140
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:41,134
Sure. Fix this
ventilator.

141
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:44,015
But it ain't a machine! It don't move!

142
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,688
Sure it does! Did you ever
look inside a piece of iron?

143
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:48,986
You kidding me,
harry?

144
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,200
No, no. This ventilator's a little sky,

145
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:53,454
full of suns and
moons and stars!

146
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,752
They whiz around,
imitating the big universe.

147
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:56,921
Yeah, harry?

148
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,718
Millions of electrons and protons

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,138
live in this
ventilator.

150
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:01,558
And if you listen
hard enough,

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,103
you'll hear a guy
electron whistling

152
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:04,690
at a dame proton.

153
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,403
Love blossoms
between 'em.

154
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:08,742
And what's the
result of it all?

155
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:10,329
I don't know,
harry.

156
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:12,793
A piece of iron.
Paint it.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,550
What are you looking
for? A raft full of dames?

158
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:35,514
No, sir. The evening
star just came out.

159
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:37,311
My grandfather says
beauty like this

160
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:39,065
will stay with
a man always.

161
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,404
That why you're
aboard?

162
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:43,785
Grandfather thinks a man
should travel the seas

163
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,748
and touch hands
with the universe

164
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,922
so that he can live
at peace on land.

165
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,885
The ocean don't do nothing
but drive you ashore,

166
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,681
and the land drives
you back to sea.

167
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,769
That's just
black water.

168
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:57,610
Don't get to thinking you
can walk no place on it.

169
00:09:57,652 --> 00:09:59,823
I do not know if men
can walk on water,

170
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:01,787
but i would not be
afraid to try.

171
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:03,750
Look, kid, i got a lazy crew this trip.

172
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,630
It don't help none for you
to stand seagull-watcher

173
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:07,133
or ask dumb questions
about nothing.

174
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:08,302
Get to work!

175
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:10,641
Sorry, sir.

176
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,899
Ah, that's right, you ain't
due on watch for another hour.

177
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:15,696
Forget what i said.

178
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:26,137
Hey, harry, there's
a jap sub chasing us.

179
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:28,309
Don't go spreading
wild rumors!

180
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:30,021
No, it said sub
on the book!

181
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,818
Sponce is running to
the captain now!

182
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,488
We're on the alert!

183
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:35,285
Sit down and
cut for deal!

184
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,331
Aw, harry,
this ain't sensible!

185
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,336
Playing cards in a
crisis like this...

186
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:40,839
nothing more
sensible.

187
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:42,719
King's higher than
queen, 2 and 2 make 4.

188
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:45,601
Do you know that we may
be facing our last moment?

189
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:46,937
So what?

190
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,316
Well, i ain't in
such good standing

191
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,200
that i can afford to die
with cards in my hand.

192
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,912
I'll hide the
evidence, mudge.

193
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:56,461
And the cards is running
bad for me, too...

194
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,633
that's because of those
sins i committed in chile.

195
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:01,263
If he is a jap sub,
and he does get us,

196
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:03,394
and if you do get killed,
god's going to drop everything

197
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:05,064
and jump on you
for playing cards?

198
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:06,568
You ain't that
important.

199
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,531
Well, maybe not
to you,

200
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:11,748
but every man has a
trembling immortal soul,

201
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:13,501
and that's
important to god.

202
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,717
All right, it is the japs! This is it!

203
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:21,271
Listen to them mugs.

204
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:24,611
5 minutes ago, they were too
lazy to draw a decent breath.

205
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:28,037
Harry, a man has an actual
right not to want to be dead!

206
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,582
Ah, soon as
the danger's over,

207
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,587
they'll be sitting on their
barnacles and grousing.

208
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:34,594
Harry, please! We'll be trapped in here.

209
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:36,223
We'll die in here!

210
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:37,977
Uh-uh, not me.
I'm not dying yet.

211
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,189
Yeah, but how
do you know that?

212
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,904
I ain't gonna die
till i'm good and ready!

213
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:57,023
Look at it. Miles deep,
but nothing to drink.

214
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:58,402
Ok, gus, ok.

215
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:01,785
What gripes me most is i
ain't getting paid for this.

216
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:03,288
Who says so?

217
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,751
The company.

218
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,296
The minute
you're torpedoed,

219
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:07,758
the company
stops your pay.

220
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,011
Here. Shuffle
the cards.

221
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,225
I can't play anymore. I'm bushed, harry.

222
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,436
Really bushed!

223
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,482
Well, 5 days in the
sun's a little rugged.

224
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:17,823
How is it, ramon?

225
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:19,328
Good.

226
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:24,172
Harry... he's going to
let me go.

227
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:26,011
Yeah, you'll get home all right, kid.

228
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:32,693
Sure, sure. You're
going to make it.

229
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,948
Here, kid.
Drink this.

230
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:36,995
Get his head, mudge.

231
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:43,845
That's our rations!
You got no right to-

232
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,309
you don't mean that, gus.
You're better than that.

233
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:48,315
We ain't gonna drink
water when we get to port.

234
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:50,319
We're gonna
drink whiskey.

235
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:03,350
I guess he decided
to walk home.

236
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:07,444
Ramon died fine.

237
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:09,407
He didn't feel
nothing.

238
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:10,910
That's a good enough
way to die,

239
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:12,540
without feeling it.

240
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:15,087
That's a good enough
way to live, brother.

241
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:18,010
Here, pass this
on to gus.

242
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:20,099
Hand me that canvas.

243
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:21,562
I gotta pray,
harry.

244
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:23,190
It's our only
chance!

245
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:25,236
Who's stopping you?
The kid prayed.

246
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:26,866
You see god, you
got to save harry.

247
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:28,620
I'm not asking this
for myself.

248
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:30,541
You ask it
for yourself.

249
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,754
Harry don't really
mean that, god.

250
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,593
He knows you took
the only one of us

251
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:36,556
that was in any
shape to die.

252
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,892
Leave me out of it.

253
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:39,731
I'm asking for harry and
gus and limo and model t.

254
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:41,735
I'm not asking
for me!

255
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:45,118
But if you send help,
i'll live a better life.

256
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:46,496
I'll never even look
at bad women no more.

257
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,502
Huh! Now you're gonna
bargain with him!

258
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:50,004
I'll never touch
another drop

259
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:51,425
of hard liquor,
so help me.

260
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:52,929
I'll never use a knife
on another man in a fight,

261
00:13:53,013 --> 00:13:54,934
no matter how much bigger he is than me.

262
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,397
You got yourself out
on a limb now, brother.

263
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:58,609
I know you hear
harry, god,

264
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:00,488
but forgive his
sacrilege and his mocking.

265
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:02,494
I'll give you
all my money,

266
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:04,748
all of it, to your
church, so help me.

267
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,628
Oh, now you're gonna cheat
him. You ain't got a dime!

268
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,468
Yes i have, too. $2,500
cash- you know that, god-

269
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:10,806
in a savings account

270
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,935
in the maritime union
bank in frisco.

271
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,982
And i'll give every penny
of it to your church,

272
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,444
so help me.

273
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:17,948
That's a sucker
deal, mudge.

274
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:20,369
You couldn't keep one of
those promises, let alone 4.

275
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,416
Yes i can, god. Don't listen to harry.

276
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:24,923
I swear on my
immortal soul.

277
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:27,220
On my trembling immortal
soul, i swear it!

278
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:34,989
We're saved!
Thank god!

279
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:36,075
My prayer
done it!

280
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:40,419
Well, well!
So we got a navy.

281
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:43,049
Cor blimey, gus, you
look like a real gent.

282
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:46,516
Yeah, limo, i feel like a
gent outside and a wolf inside.

283
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,941
You sure you cut all
the hairs out of my ears?

284
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,862
Everything is
shipshape now, sir.

285
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:54,661
That torpedoing must have
been a terrible experience.

286
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:56,331
Yes, sir, you
merchant marine boys

287
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,086
got just as much right
to call yourselves heroes

288
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,840
as anyone on
the front lines.

289
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:01,678
Yeah, yeah. Hey, you
nicked me on the chin.

290
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:03,098
Where's my
citation?

291
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,601
They gave harry a medal one time,

292
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:06,147
but a pelican
swallered it.

293
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:08,486
Yeah, we was trolling it for bait.

294
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,786
Well, i'm all clean
and neat, and now i'll-

295
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,208
ok, mudge. And for being
so rugged on the raft,

296
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:16,422
you can have second
choice of the tomatoes.

297
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:18,970
Oh no, harry, i'm not
going with you. Remember?

298
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:20,515
Remember what?

299
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:23,439
I got the money, the
$2,500 for the church.

300
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:25,778
That was a solemn
oath, harry,

301
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,657
the kind a man's
got to keep.

302
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:29,663
I'd be highly honored
was you to come along.

303
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,207
I ain't in
on the deal.

304
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,087
Oh. Well, then,
i'll have to handle

305
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:35,092
this transaction
by myself.

306
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:36,637
What's all the rush?

307
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,645
A man of strong moral
character might wait,

308
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:41,107
but i better
not.

309
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,903
Hold it. Ain't you
forgetting something?

310
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, no, harry. I've got
every promise memorized.

311
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:49,418
No women, no liquor, no knife
fights, and the church donation.

312
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:51,089
But we ain't drunk
the minnie tober down.

313
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:52,509
I know that,
harry, but-

314
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,013
hey, you guys,
mudgin don't want to

315
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:55,517
drink the
minnie tober down!

316
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:57,021
You've got to
do that, mudgin!

317
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,273
She was
a good ship!

318
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,818
And her bilge
didn't stink.

319
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:01,322
He's reflecting
on you, harry!

320
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:02,324
Oh, no,
harry.

321
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,453
I'll say so!

322
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,873
A guy that won't drink a lost ship down

323
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:06,167
reflects on
his bosun!

324
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,337
Yeah!

325
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:08,715
He don't have to do
anything on my account.

326
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,720
All right, all right, i'll
do it on your account, harry.

327
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,641
But just
one short beer.

328
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:21,079
*... of you, of you,
i'm dreaming *

329
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:26,216
* the sea rolls wide
'tween me and dublin town *

330
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:32,188
what's the matter with handsome tonight?

331
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:33,608
I don't know.

332
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:35,655
He don't like blondes and
he don't like brunettes.

333
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:39,414
Why don't you settle
for me, then, big boy?

334
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,252
You're a nice redhead,

335
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:44,217
but i'm looking for a dame
with green hair and purple eyes.

336
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:50,190
*... green on irish ground *

337
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:54,868
scamps and scalawags! Maura
o'flaherty left weeping on the docks!

338
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:59,421
Just keening like a banshee!
L- i'll bear no more of it!

339
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:01,718
No more of it!

340
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:04,349
Waiter. Waiter!

341
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,207
It's gone, harry.
My money's gone.

342
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,711
I was rolled. It's
gone, all right.

343
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:17,214
It ain't up
there, mudge.

344
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:18,551
We turned the dump
inside-out.

345
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,431
This is what you get for
breaking all those promises.

346
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,975
Well, i didn't
knife anybody.

347
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:24,022
No, you ain't violated
the atlantic charter.

348
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,280
Police!
Police!

349
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:28,575
Limo and model t!

350
00:17:28,617 --> 00:17:29,870
They're still up
there. Come on.

351
00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:44,279
Owwww!

352
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,819
Here he is!

353
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,702
Hey! Where you been
keeping yourself, mudge?

354
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,340
In an alley
someplace.

355
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,428
He's got the bloody
rotten shakes, harry.

356
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:16,023
What's the matter,
pal? You hurt?

357
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:21,494
I'm awful
scared, harry.

358
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:23,917
Of what?

359
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,044
I don't know.

360
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:26,632
Well, we ain't
got all day.

361
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:30,224
Let him talk. Spit it out, mudge.

362
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,730
In the fight, i threw my knife away,

363
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:35,403
not wanting to cut a
man, you understand?

364
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,616
And it struck another man in the arm.

365
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:41,793
I saw the blood
dripping,

366
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:43,923
and i looked down at my hands like this,

367
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:46,555
and then, sudden-like, i ran.

368
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,230
Then it
happened.

369
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:51,901
What
happened?

370
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:54,951
I lost my soul.

371
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:58,584
You lost what?

372
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:00,839
My weeping immortal soul, harry.

373
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:02,678
Like a nightmare.

374
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,347
Like a hand reaching
into my chest

375
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,977
and tearing
something open.

376
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,817
A shiny little seed no
bigger than a pinpoint

377
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:12,409
come out of here, and
i grabbed at it, and...

378
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,502
and it drifted away
in the fog.

379
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:18,256
Cor blimey!

380
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,637
No wiring or nothing attached, mudgin?

381
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:25,858
Not a thread.
Not a cobweb, even.

382
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:29,283
It was like
a little firefly.

383
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:31,079
I'm awful glad
you're here, harry.

384
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:34,754
This is my
fault, too.

385
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:38,096
Oh, no, no. You can't say that, harry.

386
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:40,602
If a man loses
his soul,

387
00:19:40,644 --> 00:19:43,484
that's his own personal responsibility.

388
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:45,823
How long you gonna
put up with this little guy?

389
00:19:45,907 --> 00:19:47,160
He's bug-eyes,
he's cuckoo.

390
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:49,248
That ain't so, gus.

391
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,545
I'm as rational
as you are.

392
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:53,133
You gotta take
it into account

393
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:56,181
i saw my soul disappear
up powell street.

394
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:58,897
Maybe it happened
like he says.

395
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,527
He sure looks like
all of a sudden

396
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,157
he lost his magneto.

397
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,122
You feel kind of like you
ain't getting the juice, mudgin?

398
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,129
I don't
feel nothing-

399
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:11,384
all numb-like
inside.

400
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,100
Ah, baloney!

401
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,520
You ain't got
a soul, mudgin.

402
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,023
Nobody's got
a soul.

403
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,486
So how can you lose what don't exist?

404
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:20,072
I saw it, gus.

405
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:22,495
Well, go find
the thing, then!

406
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:23,873
You ought to take
this matter up

407
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,168
with a good church
of england reverend.

408
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:26,880
Oh, a preacher
wouldn't know!

409
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,259
Why wouldn't he
know?

410
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:29,554
It's his bloomin'
business to know, isn't it?

411
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:31,601
Preachers only
know about souls

412
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:33,063
that leave
a dead body

413
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:34,607
and go straight
to heaven or hell.

414
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,030
I bet a good electrician
could tell mudgin more.

415
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:38,993
Maybe mudgin's dead and don't know it.

416
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:41,207
Leave him
alone, gus.

417
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,295
Are you
nuts, too?

418
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,592
Don't tell me you
believe his screwy talk!

419
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:47,096
I don't believe
in nothin'.

420
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,936
Oh, you gotta
believe it, harry.

421
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,442
We're all shipmates.

422
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:54,238
It's like i told you i
had cancer or something.

423
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:56,452
You wouldn't just laugh
it off and ditch me.

424
00:20:56,536 --> 00:20:58,039
That's exactly
what he's gonna do!

425
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,585
Go on, beat it!

426
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,088
You've imposed on
harry long enough.

427
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:02,551
I said leave
him alone, gus.

428
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,054
Ok.

429
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,892
Oh,
look out, harry!

430
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:10,194
You'll never learn.

431
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:12,825
You still telegraph
that right.

432
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:20,510
It's all right, it's all
right. They're close friends.

433
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:27,903
I'll see you later. You
guys take care of mudge.

434
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,451
Now harry's
sore at me.

435
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:32,664
You sore at gus,
harry?

436
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,920
No, i like gus fine.
I'll see you later, gus.

437
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,465
Where you going,
harry?

438
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,264
Harry!
Don't leave me!

439
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:41,310
Harry! Wait for me!

440
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,200
I wouldn't feel so bad
if i knew what to do, hmm?

441
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:53,590
He... he wouldn't just
put a guy in the doghouse

442
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:55,261
and leave him
there.

443
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:01,734
Harry. Harry!

444
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:07,666
God's asking me to keep my promises.

445
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:12,010
All right, all right, it's all my fault!

446
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:13,221
Oh, no, l-l-

447
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:14,766
yeah, yeah. Go get it off your mind.

448
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,270
Buy yourself
a drink.

449
00:22:16,354 --> 00:22:17,732
It ain't safe for
me to be alone.

450
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:19,194
A man running around
without a soul?

451
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:20,906
Hold it.

452
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:29,177
Where's lucille? Don't
she work here anymore?

453
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,680
No, she had
tough luck.

454
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:33,144
Fell downstairs the other
night and broke her leg.

455
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,987
I got her address here
someplace. You want it?

456
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:39,201
Not with a broken
leg, i don't!

457
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:42,041
Harry, come here!

458
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,252
Now what?

459
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:44,755
Lookit!

460
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,095
"The tree of knowledge
is rooted in the ages."

461
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:48,933
Maybe they know about a case like mine.

462
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,645
You come in with me
while i ask 'em.

463
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:52,149
Me, go in that dump?

464
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:53,777
Oh, but i can't talk
to library people.

465
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:55,406
You're my bosun. You
talk for me at mast.

466
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:56,785
You ain't at mast!

467
00:22:56,869 --> 00:22:58,999
I am so at mast! I'm
up before the captain!

468
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:00,418
The real captain.

469
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:01,880
And those gooks in
there are gonna help you?

470
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,926
Well, they're swell educated.
Educated people might, harry.

471
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:06,809
Oh, educated, huh?

472
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:10,359
Lookit, harry. "reading
maketh a full man," it says.

473
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:13,658
Full of what? Full of sap
from the tree of knowledge!

474
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,873
What grows on trees?
Dried prunes.

475
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:17,878
And what do you get
from sap and prunes?

476
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,675
Well, harry,
i only said-

477
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:24,184
"as stars to the sailor
are books to the scholar."

478
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:25,687
Ain't that
sweet.

479
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,484
They know about
sailors.

480
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:29,280
Yeah, but harry,
i just thought-

481
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:31,076
educated people... they
don't brag on billboards,

482
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,666
they chisel their
ads in granite!

483
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:37,842
"Knowledge is power." "books
are the legacy of time."

484
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:43,272
Uh-oh. There's the topper-
"wisdom is peace." huh!

485
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:46,154
So they're wise.
So they got peace.

486
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:47,574
Yeah, but harry-

487
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:49,244
come on, mudge.

488
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:50,999
We'll go in and get a
great big hunk of wisdom,

489
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,380
and a nice fat
bellyful of peace.

490
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,903
I'll wait here
while you ask 'em.

491
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:05,367
If they had ice, would
be wonderful for stiffs.

492
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,878
Follow me, pal.

493
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:19,735
Yeah. What do you
do for 'em?

494
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:30,344
Yes?

495
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,848
Can't find it.

496
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:33,268
Pardon?

497
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:34,354
The tree.

498
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,860
Huh?

499
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:39,658
The tree of knowledge. Come in,
it says, and get under the tree.

500
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,496
Where do you keep it?

501
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:45,965
The next bar is about a block
and a half down the street.

502
00:24:46,007 --> 00:24:47,635
You can't miss it.

503
00:24:47,678 --> 00:24:49,348
I know where all
the barrooms are.

504
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:51,436
I thought i'd stop
a moment in yours.

505
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:52,857
What do you say, you
gonna set 'em up?

506
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,361
We'll heist one
under the tree,

507
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:55,697
and get drunk with
a little knowledge.

508
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:57,493
Look, mister, are you
going to keep this up?

509
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:59,164
Because if so, i'll
have to call a guard.

510
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,835
Oh, no. No, no, miss.
I take it all back.

511
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,379
I didn't say a word.

512
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,260
I'm not looking for
trouble. I'm bringing it in.

513
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:05,888
I got a sick sailor
with me.

514
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,141
What?

515
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:08,770
Yeah. Yeah, that guy
over there.

516
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:11,526
He's sick, and he's
looking for help.

517
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,574
Please excuse
harry, miss.

518
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:15,245
He's doing this
for me.

519
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:16,581
Yeah, that's
right, mudge.

520
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:17,959
Tell the lady
what's eating you.

521
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:19,546
I wouldn't be surprised
if she could help you.

522
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,010
She looks pretty
smart to me.

523
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,264
Did harry tell you
what we was looking for?

524
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:25,144
He said
you were sick.

525
00:25:25,227 --> 00:25:26,939
Well, not really sick,
miss. You see, l-l-

526
00:25:27,023 --> 00:25:28,568
what's the matter?

527
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,155
I lost my soul.

528
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,533
Popped out of his chest

529
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:32,954
and lammed up powell
street in the fog.

530
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:34,959
It did. We was wondering
whether you could refer us

531
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:36,964
to a book dealing with
a similar experience.

532
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:38,467
You're a sailor?

533
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:39,970
Yes, miss.

534
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:41,307
Merchant marine?

535
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:42,309
Yes, miss.

536
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,688
Is he?

537
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,902
Yes, he's the bosun, and if
you was ever torpedoed, miss,

538
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:48,700
you wouldn't swap harry
for no bosun going.

539
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:51,499
Were you torpedoed?

540
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:52,918
The last trip.

541
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:54,422
And you saved him?

542
00:25:54,464 --> 00:25:55,800
He's nuts.

543
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,304
You see, a tree
grew on the ship,

544
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:58,640
and we all sat
around and read.

545
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,601
Oh, harry.

546
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:00,938
Didn't say a word.

547
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:03,068
Suppose you tell me what
you're looking for, please.

548
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,738
I'm really
rather busy.

549
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:06,242
Yes. It was like
this, miss.

550
00:26:06,285 --> 00:26:08,081
We were out there on a
raft, and on the sixth day,

551
00:26:08,122 --> 00:26:11,254
i made the lord 4 promises,
what i'd do if he saved us.

552
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:15,557
But i broke my promises,
and i lost my soul.

553
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:20,986
Uh, what do you say, you
got a book around here

554
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,866
that a soul might
walk back on?

555
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,495
We've got some
books for you.

556
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:25,999
You hear that, harry?

557
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,503
Sure. Tells you all about
that soul racket, huh?

558
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,008
Right. Come
with me, please.

559
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:32,556
Come on, harry.

560
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:34,519
We'll start here. There
are some excellent studies:

561
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:36,565
One by a surgeon
in the british navy,

562
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,070
and this one by
an american colonel:

563
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:39,990
Facts on combat
fatigue.

564
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,539
Combat fatigue?
Sounds good.

565
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:44,669
Yes, the strain
of war, you know,

566
00:26:44,711 --> 00:26:46,590
sometimes causes
psychoneurosis.

567
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:49,012
Psychoneurosis? That
sounds pretty good, too.

568
00:26:49,096 --> 00:26:53,356
You see, mr. Mudge, you've
had a subjective experience.

569
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,027
You made promises
you didn't keep,

570
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:56,823
and that made you
feel guilty,

571
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,744
so that you imagined
you lost your soul.

572
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:00,917
Oh, no, miss.
I didn't imagine that.

573
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,336
I really lost it,
in the fog.

574
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,923
On powell
street.

575
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:05,511
Shhhhhh!

576
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:07,098
We're disturbing
the readers.

577
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,601
You mean they're
disturbing us!

578
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:11,901
Hey, pipe down,
you clucks!

579
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:17,164
You know, i'm not
out with you.

580
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:18,835
When you go, i stay.

581
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:20,715
So whisper,
will you please?

582
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:23,387
Harry, this nice lady
is trying to help me.

583
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:25,392
Ok, ok.

584
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:27,313
I never whispered
before in my life.

585
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,568
How do i sound?

586
00:27:29,653 --> 00:27:32,869
Look, mr. Mudge,
take this and read it.

587
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:34,413
This... this page here.

588
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:37,797
It may help explain your problem.
I have to get back to work.

589
00:27:40,554 --> 00:27:42,141
You see this
shelf here?

590
00:27:42,183 --> 00:27:43,185
Yeah.

591
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:45,064
They're funny
pictures.

592
00:27:47,028 --> 00:27:48,364
Funny girl.

593
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:50,160
Say, harry,
i ain't never heard-

594
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:53,919
what do you got?

595
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:58,597
The soul- a symposium of modern thought.

596
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,101
Go to it.

597
00:28:00,143 --> 00:28:02,106
You read it to me,
harry.

598
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,528
I ain't never had
no knack at reading.

599
00:28:04,612 --> 00:28:06,240
Ok.

600
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,624
"The soul,
or psyche,

601
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:12,756
"also referred to
as the spirit,

602
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,806
"the self-substance,
the elan vital,

603
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,314
"the eternal and indestructible essence.

604
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,152
See footnote 1-a."

605
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:22,906
Here's 1-a, harry.

606
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:26,205
"It must be
remembered

607
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:29,171
"that a large body of
contemporaneous thought

608
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:32,220
"denies the
existence of a soul

609
00:28:32,304 --> 00:28:34,726
"and scoffs at
man's importance

610
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:37,024
or significance
as an individual."

611
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,903
Shhhhh!

612
00:28:40,867 --> 00:28:44,584
Shut up! A guy can't hear
himself think in here!

613
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:47,548
Shh! Do you want
to be thrown out?

614
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:53,313
I'm sorry, miss, but this book
says a man ain't got no soul.

615
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:57,114
Well, one man's
opinion... and mr. Mudge,

616
00:28:57,156 --> 00:29:00,037
i am hardly the last word
on whatever is troubling you,

617
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:03,128
but i do know that a lot
of strange things happen.

618
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,469
Phenomena like extrasensory perceptions,

619
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:09,686
thought transference, such
as religious mystics report.

620
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,106
Mystics?

621
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:12,944
What religious
denomination are you?

622
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:18,248
Me? Nothing. None at all.
I ain't even been baptized.

623
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,668
Oh.

624
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:22,884
Perhaps it would help if i
sent you to father cassidy

625
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,472
or the reverend
mr. Thompson

626
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,644
or maybe
a psychiatrist.

627
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:28,188
Psychiatrist!

628
00:29:28,273 --> 00:29:29,943
And what's wrong
with psychiatry?

629
00:29:30,027 --> 00:29:32,198
Mudge ain't a
diagram or chart!

630
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:33,995
Cut into him,
and he'll bleed!

631
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,211
How tender.
How profound.

632
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:39,550
Please, miss, i didn't come
in here to start a fight.

633
00:29:39,592 --> 00:29:41,053
Nor will i forget
what i'm owing you

634
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:42,640
for your good
intentions, miss.

635
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:45,731
You didn't laugh at me,
like most would've done.

636
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:47,694
Maybe that's
the only help

637
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:50,534
a man in my condition
can expect.

638
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:52,957
Just not to be
laughed at.

639
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,839
Now l-i'll be getting
along out of here,

640
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,844
and i'm hoping,
for your sake,

641
00:29:57,886 --> 00:30:00,224
that harry will
do the same.

642
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:01,896
Thank you kindly,

643
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:04,568
and if i wasn't in the
doghouse with the lord almighty,

644
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:07,408
i'd be asking him to
give you his blessing.

645
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,086
Great work.

646
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,255
So long.

647
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,555
Well, the fun's over
in my tavern.

648
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:35,267
I hope
you enjoyed it.

649
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,273
Had a wonderful
time.

650
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:39,235
Some tree.

651
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,241
Don't run into it
on your way out.

652
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:42,118
So long.

653
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:45,751
Yeah, yeah,
i'll be careful,

654
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:47,255
and you know, the
tree of knowledge

655
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,257
that's rooted
in the ages-

656
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:49,761
treat that careful.

657
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:51,933
Them ages
get you so much-

658
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,021
psychoneurosis,
guilt neurosis,

659
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:55,525
cirrhosis
of the liver-

660
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:57,864
you couldn't live
without 'em!

661
00:30:57,948 --> 00:31:00,119
It would be tough.

662
00:31:03,336 --> 00:31:04,964
I'll bet it would...

663
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:07,095
and don't worry,
there they are,

664
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:09,350
and as pretty parrots come
and go, you're a good one.

665
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,981
I know what those guys were
after better than you do, pal.

666
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:14,069
There's nothing out there,
and there's nothing in here.

667
00:31:14,154 --> 00:31:17,453
The only difference between you
and me is i know it and you don't.

668
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:19,959
You're kiddin' yourself,
and gettin' away with it.

669
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:22,131
Ain't that wonderful?

670
00:31:24,512 --> 00:31:27,018
Are you having
a good time?

671
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:30,025
Rotten.

672
00:31:31,404 --> 00:31:34,160
This is no fun.

673
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:35,664
No, it isn't.

674
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:38,588
Kidding you gets me
nothin', sister.

675
00:31:39,924 --> 00:31:41,845
What do you want?

676
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:45,019
Yeah.
What do i want?

677
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,356
That's it.

678
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:48,528
What's it?

679
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,741
Just "it."

680
00:31:53,206 --> 00:31:54,709
Can i go now?

681
00:31:54,794 --> 00:31:58,135
Sure, you can go.

682
00:31:58,219 --> 00:31:59,722
Thanks.

683
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:02,979
The tree
is all yours.

684
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,442
Let me know when
you run into yours.

685
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:05,443
Run into what?

686
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:07,198
Your tree-
the "it" tree.

687
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,161
That's right. That's
what i'm looking for.

688
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:10,330
It's it, ain't it?

689
00:32:10,415 --> 00:32:13,171
It's it, ain't it?
Some word, "it."

690
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:15,510
In the dictionary, it
breaks all records for usage:

691
00:32:15,594 --> 00:32:18,016
A personal pronoun of the
third person or neuter gender,

692
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,520
used as a substitute
for a noun;

693
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,191
or representing
something possessing sex

694
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:23,028
when sex is not
particularized or considered;

695
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:25,200
or to refer to some matter
not definitely conceived;

696
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:26,537
or as the grammatical
subject of a clause,

697
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:27,874
such as "it is
believed he is dead."

698
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:29,210
"He is dead," is as
generally believed-

699
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:31,048
you can't smoke
in here!

700
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:32,634
I'll bet you can't.

701
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,890
I don't think you
could die in here!

702
00:32:34,932 --> 00:32:36,686
I think they carry you
in after you're dead.

703
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,273
Take a look
at these dodo birds!

704
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:39,776
What are they all
tiptoeing about?

705
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:41,823
The dead can't wake
the dead.

706
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:46,919
Well, so long.

707
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:49,091
Much obliged
for tryin'.

708
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,762
So long.

709
00:32:57,737 --> 00:32:59,867
Hello.

710
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:01,537
I was, uh,
talking to her.

711
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:02,373
Oh.

712
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:03,208
You ready?

713
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:04,545
I'll hurry.

714
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:07,552
Ho, ho, boy! How you don't fit in here!

715
00:33:07,636 --> 00:33:08,554
Friend
of yours?

716
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:09,766
No.

717
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,935
Why don't i
fit in here?

718
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:12,439
In this graveyard?
Why, you're a lark!

719
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,608
There's a song
in your eyes,

720
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:14,486
and they're
lit with livin'.

721
00:33:14,528 --> 00:33:15,238
Mister!

722
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:16,240
Everybody died
on the vine

723
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:17,660
and whambo!
In comes the grapes.

724
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:19,957
Shh!
- Shh, shh!

725
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:20,792
Ha ha ha!

726
00:33:20,835 --> 00:33:21,628
Helen!

727
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,630
Oh, sorry.

728
00:33:22,673 --> 00:33:23,591
How are you,
helen?

729
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:24,635
Who are you?

730
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:26,097
Harry.
- Hiya, harry.

731
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,141
Sit down.

732
00:33:27,142 --> 00:33:28,144
Hey, hey.

733
00:33:29,857 --> 00:33:30,984
What do you do?

734
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,529
I'm a secretary.
What do you do?

735
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,240
I'm a sailor.

736
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,451
Oh, just
off a whaler?

737
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:36,122
Merchant marine.

738
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:37,290
Glad to meet you,
helen.

739
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,795
Hi.
- When do we eat?

740
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:39,796
I'm eating
with emily.

741
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:40,632
She emily?

742
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:41,676
Uh-huh.

743
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,514
Hello, emily.

744
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:45,185
Emily,
merchant marine.

745
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:46,689
Well, that's fine.

746
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:48,736
I've seen you meet
some officers in the navy,

747
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,364
but i've never seen
this exuberance before.

748
00:33:50,406 --> 00:33:51,826
You had the
same chance, emily.

749
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,626
They don't know it's us. Look around.

750
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:57,172
Here. I'm going
to get my hat

751
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,717
and get out of here
before i'm fired.

752
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:06,778
Took you long enough
to get your hat, emily.

753
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:07,865
Oh, boy,
he's in again.

754
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:09,160
He's out again, you mean. Good night.

755
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:10,705
Just a minute.
Would you do me

756
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:12,292
the honor to dine with me
- uh, both of you?

757
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:15,007
No, thank you. I wish
you'd stop pushing me.

758
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:16,469
Well,
look, girls, look-

759
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:19,017
l- i'm a sailor, and i'm marooned,
and in your town.

760
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:21,022
Now, if you was in my town,
i wouldn't turn you down.

761
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:22,359
Oh, let him
eat with us, em.

762
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:23,527
Helen, no.

763
00:34:23,612 --> 00:34:25,700
All right, and i hope you're satisfied.

764
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:27,036
I got nowhere to go,

765
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,707
and after talking to you two nice girls,

766
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:30,712
do you think there are any
other nice girls in this town?

767
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:31,881
He's talkin'
awful nice now.

768
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:32,967
Yeah, ain't
i talkin' nice now?

769
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:34,303
Awful nice.

770
00:34:34,346 --> 00:34:35,724
See what helen says? I'm
talkin' awful nice now.

771
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,186
Do you want him to go with us, really?

772
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,188
I think
it'd be fun.

773
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:39,232
I don't
think so.

774
00:34:39,274 --> 00:34:40,902
Well, it's
whatever you say.

775
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:41,905
Before you speak,

776
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:42,908
you'd better not
do any talking.

777
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:43,910
Let helen
do it for you.

778
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:44,912
All right.

779
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:45,748
I'll just
stand here and hope.

780
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,920
Now, see how sweet
he can be?

781
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:50,760
Well, this is getting dull
enough. If the only way to end it-

782
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:53,601
i'm just whistling
for a cab, pals.

783
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:57,234
You don't have to do this on my account.

784
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,573
I think i do.

785
00:34:59,657 --> 00:35:01,578
Well, he'll know you just
came along to chaperone us.

786
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,914
I think he knows
that already.

787
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:04,210
Why'd he invite you?

788
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:07,509
Your friend has a rather
complicated mind for a sailor.

789
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:18,578
How we doin'?

790
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:20,582
Emily, you know what
he's been tellin' me?

791
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:21,751
He's been talkin' scientific.

792
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:22,713
I'll bet.

793
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:24,132
He says if a drunken man staggers,

794
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:25,344
he always
staggers-

795
00:35:25,386 --> 00:35:27,307
where'd you say he staggles
- er, staggers?

796
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:29,145
True north, emily.
True north.

797
00:35:29,187 --> 00:35:30,648
True north! Isn't that interesting?

798
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,483
Terrific.

799
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:32,736
That's right,
emily.

800
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,657
Once upon a time, some
guys got lost in the jungle,

801
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,994
so they all chipped in their hooch,

802
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:36,955
got one of
the guys drunk,

803
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,500
and made a compass
out of him.

804
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:39,377
Isn't it cute?

805
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:41,341
I can't stand it.

806
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:46,770
That's one fact i
didn't get out of a book.

807
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,070
Oh, emily, where'd
you rather be than right here?

808
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:53,077
Don't push me,
darling.

809
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,247
Now, it's
been very nice,

810
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:55,750
but as we have
to get up tomorrow,

811
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,964
shall we, uh,
start sailing for home?

812
00:35:58,048 --> 00:35:59,301
Oh, i don't want
to go home.

813
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:00,805
Don't you always get up
in the morning, emily?

814
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:01,973
We don't usually
get up sundays.

815
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:03,812
Tomorrow's sunday,
you know.

816
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:04,981
I didn't know.

817
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:06,318
Don't you know sunday when it comes?

818
00:36:06,402 --> 00:36:08,323
On land, every day's
a sunday for a sailor.

819
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:11,037
Oh. Emily's got a little
farm she's trying to sell.

820
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,001
Some people are coming
to see it tomorrow.

821
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:14,170
You going
to help her?

822
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:15,256
Yes.

823
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,593
You want me to help you,
so you can help her?

824
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:19,014
Oh, doesn't he put things just darling?

825
00:36:19,057 --> 00:36:20,017
Emily, what's
the matter with me?

826
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,023
I'm crazy
about this guy.

827
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:24,486
What's the matter
with me?

828
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,199
I don't know.

829
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:27,995
I never felt
like this before.

830
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,668
Meet a man, fall flat on my
face. You ashamed of me, emily?

831
00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:32,548
No, no.

832
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:33,717
A little ashamed?

833
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:35,054
A little.

834
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:36,558
She's ashamed
of me, harry,

835
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,269
but emily
don't like men.

836
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,068
Do men like her?

837
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:42,739
Do they, emily?

838
00:36:42,823 --> 00:36:43,908
No.

839
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,454
They'd like her
if she'd let 'em,

840
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:46,874
wouldn't they,
harry?

841
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,378
I don't know.

842
00:36:48,462 --> 00:36:50,425
Ain't she beautiful?

843
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,178
Oh, come on,
helen-

844
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:53,389
no, wait a minute.

845
00:36:53,432 --> 00:36:54,350
This is something
that's got to be decided.

846
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:55,854
Yeah, she's
good-looking enough.

847
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:58,026
The trouble with emily
is she don't want much.

848
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,908
I don't know what
you mean. Do you?

849
00:37:00,992 --> 00:37:03,330
Yeah, you're
a mild girl.

850
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:05,836
Oh.

851
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,173
Got a fella?

852
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:08,885
No.

853
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,390
Want one?

854
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:12,394
Not especially.

855
00:37:12,436 --> 00:37:14,733
Well, that's got something
to do with what i mean.

856
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:17,155
Along with that, you're
kind of independent.

857
00:37:17,198 --> 00:37:18,534
You bet i am!

858
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:20,204
Oh, don't fight with her. Fight with me.

859
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:21,667
I mean,
look at me.

860
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:24,423
I'm just crazy
about this guy.

861
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:26,595
Oh, you're lucky.
You got a smart fella.

862
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,602
He'll teach you how
to roll a barrel of oil.

863
00:37:29,686 --> 00:37:30,771
Will you, harry?

864
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:33,194
How do you roll
a barrel of oil?

865
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:36,452
I'll tell you.

866
00:37:36,494 --> 00:37:37,830
Uh, did you girls
ever take a bath?

867
00:37:37,873 --> 00:37:38,666
Huh?

868
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:39,668
I mean, did you
ever notice

869
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,297
how the water
runs out of the bathtub,

870
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:42,967
how the water
goes down the drain?

871
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,597
No, i never did. I get
right out of the bathtub.

872
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,641
I don't like
feeling wet.

873
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:46,977
Heh heh. I thought
maybe you might have

874
00:37:47,062 --> 00:37:48,315
sat there
thinking once.

875
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:50,235
Oh, no, i can't dry myself fast enough,

876
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:53,785
but emily sits there,
till the water's all gone.

877
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:55,665
Hmm?

878
00:37:57,336 --> 00:37:58,923
Is that so?

879
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:01,429
Helen!

880
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:02,932
Great stuff,
that brandy!

881
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:04,102
What'd i say?

882
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:05,606
Let the professor
say it.

883
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,237
He was going to tell
us some... discovery.

884
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:10,868
Oh, who cares? How's the brandy whirl?

885
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:12,122
Hey, waiter!
Waiter!

886
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,751
Nothing doing, helen.
I'm not kidding.

887
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:15,171
Oh, leave her
alone. Come on.

888
00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:16,466
Another little drink
won't kill you, either.

889
00:38:16,549 --> 00:38:18,010
I'm taking her
home, see?

890
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:19,556
Want to bet on that?

891
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,018
I'll bet on that-

892
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,187
fight, fight, fight all night long.

893
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,399
What a party!

894
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:26,030
Hey, there's
harry now! Hiya, harry!

895
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:26,950
Hey!
How are you?

896
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:29,204
Hey! Hiya, gus!

897
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:30,374
Come on over, boys!

898
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,836
I want you to meet
some friends of mine-

899
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,175
nice and mild,
right down your alley.

900
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:35,344
Hiya, gus!

901
00:38:35,387 --> 00:38:36,514
Hiya, harry!

902
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:38,018
Hiya, boys!
How ya doin'?

903
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:39,522
I got a spare tomato for you, boys.

904
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:41,317
This is emily. Shake hands with emily.

905
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:43,447
Hiya, gus!
Hello, handsome!

906
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,492
Hello!

907
00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:45,703
How are ya,
good-lookin'?

908
00:38:45,787 --> 00:38:46,956
They're
little kidders.

909
00:38:46,998 --> 00:38:49,295
Honey, i'm all warmed up
and ready to take off.

910
00:38:49,337 --> 00:38:51,091
Any of you guys
want to buzz the field?

911
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,469
Sure!

912
00:38:52,553 --> 00:38:53,973
Now, big boys
go first.

913
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:55,685
Open up
the throttle, big boy.

914
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:57,648
I fly on high octane.

915
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,034
Any of you want to share
the ride, just cut in.

916
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:05,083
Oh, boy!
Heh heh heh...

917
00:39:05,752 --> 00:39:07,255
emily!

918
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:08,550
I want a dance
with emmy.

919
00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:10,388
Come on, gus! Let's have a dance-

920
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,891
oh, ho ho!

921
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,353
Hiya, mudge!

922
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:16,110
Hiya, toots!
Yes, ma'am!

923
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,910
Come on!

924
00:39:19,953 --> 00:39:21,414
Hey,
what is this?

925
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,421
Ladies first!

926
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:27,387
Stop her, harry,
stop her!

927
00:39:27,471 --> 00:39:28,640
She's a gone nut!

928
00:39:28,724 --> 00:39:30,102
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

929
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:32,733
Come on, gus.
I get a dance.

930
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:36,952
Get her, harry!
Get her!

931
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,173
Oh!

932
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:46,391
Hey!

933
00:39:48,814 --> 00:39:50,777
Emily! Emily!

934
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,072
Have you
got a match?

935
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:29,620
Oh, a beautiful thing
it was, miss!

936
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:30,582
What?

937
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:32,210
Oh, hello, mudge.

938
00:40:32,252 --> 00:40:33,713
I've been in a fight.

939
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:35,719
Like the very battle
of the boil, it was.

940
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:37,055
He called me mild!

941
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:39,018
A mild tomato!

942
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:41,775
Ah! Like queen deirdre
herself, you were.

943
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:43,362
Was i, mudge?

944
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:47,497
Aye! Queen deirdre fighting
the black prince single-handed.

945
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:49,877
Cracked his skull with a
spiked shillelagh, she did,

946
00:40:49,962 --> 00:40:51,423
and gave him
the heave-ho,

947
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:55,140
from the top story of
dublin castle! Heh heh!

948
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:57,355
What hand done
the deed, miss emily?

949
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:59,066
Well...

950
00:40:59,151 --> 00:41:01,531
l- i guess it was
my right hand. I...

951
00:41:01,615 --> 00:41:02,659
oh.

952
00:41:04,915 --> 00:41:06,126
It's a great
privilege.

953
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,804
Emily!
What's the matter?

954
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,348
What's got
into you? Come on!

955
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:14,312
Yeah.
What's the idea,

956
00:41:14,396 --> 00:41:15,523
starting a riot,

957
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:16,943
and in
a public place?

958
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:18,405
Lot of women
present.

959
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:20,075
Somebody
might have got hurt.

960
00:41:20,118 --> 00:41:21,872
What got into you?

961
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,417
You've gone nuts!

962
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:28,429
If that's life,
i'll take the library.

963
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:31,562
Here's the cab. Come on,
emily. Get in. Come on!

964
00:41:31,604 --> 00:41:33,274
Get in there!

965
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:36,240
I'd like to find the
guy that slugged me.

966
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:37,493
I'm going
back in there.

967
00:41:37,535 --> 00:41:39,372
No, harry!
Get in the cab!

968
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,918
Come on!

969
00:41:59,004 --> 00:42:00,006
It's just a small
little place, but it-

970
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:01,969
just big enough for two,
and both, women.

971
00:42:02,011 --> 00:42:03,639
Oh, emily,
i want him to come up.

972
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:05,143
Thank you for a charming
evening, mr. Sailor.

973
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:07,398
If we don't see you
again before you sail,

974
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,613
fair winds and blue skies and all that.

975
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:12,118
Oh, why
can't he, emily?

976
00:42:12,202 --> 00:42:14,332
Helen says good night.

977
00:42:16,546 --> 00:42:18,884
Give up, buddy.
You're brushed.

978
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:21,767
You know what
i oughta do?

979
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,189
I oughta go up there
and take that dame apart.

980
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,239
She's the freshest dame
i've ever met.

981
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,326
Ah, she's the kind of
dame, you go up there,

982
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:31,332
she'll crack you over
the head with a bottle.

983
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,459
Hmm?

984
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:33,628
I ain't kiddin'.

985
00:42:33,713 --> 00:42:36,177
You couldn't get me up
there with a derrick.

986
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:38,015
She works in
the library, too.

987
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,729
There you are.
You can't trust nobody.

988
00:42:44,572 --> 00:42:45,783
Mmm. Oh!

989
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:48,038
Oh!

990
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:49,083
That bad?

991
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,169
You all right?

992
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:51,714
I didn't
drink so much.

993
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:54,011
No, all you did
was fight.

994
00:42:54,053 --> 00:42:56,684
Oh! That sailor!

995
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:59,525
Heels have a morbid
fascination for you.

996
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:00,945
Morbid fascination
are your words.

997
00:43:00,987 --> 00:43:01,989
I just think
they're cute.

998
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:04,328
Mr. Harry patterson
was excessively cute.

999
00:43:04,412 --> 00:43:05,790
Is that bad?

1000
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,583
Yes.

1001
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,797
I guess i'm a poor
judge of character.

1002
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,263
He just struck me as being
kind of a heel in a cute way.

1003
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:14,102
I feel rather
sorry for him.

1004
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:15,689
Sorry?

1005
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:19,740
Yes. Just as i'd feel sorry
for any animal that's...

1006
00:43:19,782 --> 00:43:24,125
being tormented in a-
in a trap or a maze,

1007
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,922
and if you try to help
him, he'll turn on you

1008
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:27,592
and tear your
heart out.

1009
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:28,720
Why should he
do that?

1010
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:31,100
'Cause he's afraid
you'll tear his heart out.

1011
00:43:33,607 --> 00:43:35,904
Well, let's
forget about it.

1012
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,454
Oh, emily!

1013
00:43:39,538 --> 00:43:40,498
Brrr!

1014
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:43,423
Ha ha! We're going
to the farm, remember?

1015
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:50,272
Oh!

1016
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:52,026
Ooh...

1017
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:53,906
hi, helen!

1018
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,744
Tell emily
the skies are blue

1019
00:43:55,828 --> 00:43:57,749
and the winds
are fair!

1020
00:43:58,668 --> 00:44:00,422
Emily,
he's coming right up!

1021
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:01,884
Watch him
go right down.

1022
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:04,098
But, emily, we've got
to act polite to him.

1023
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:05,851
I'll act polite.

1024
00:44:10,572 --> 00:44:12,117
Now, look here,
mr. Sailor-

1025
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,662
you know, i says to myself,
i says, "harry, old boy,

1026
00:44:13,704 --> 00:44:16,460
"it wouldn't surprise me if my
girl's a little weary this morning,

1027
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:19,801
"so why don't i hire a bus
to ride them out to the farm?

1028
00:44:19,844 --> 00:44:21,848
After all, they're your pals.
They'd do as much for you."

1029
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:24,271
Oh, look at her
- tough night, wakes up beautiful.

1030
00:44:24,355 --> 00:44:25,065
Mr. Sailor?

1031
00:44:25,107 --> 00:44:25,942
Mm-hmm?

1032
00:44:25,984 --> 00:44:26,777
Let's get
something straight.

1033
00:44:26,861 --> 00:44:27,779
Yeah,
let's do that.

1034
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:29,158
Nice little place
you got here.

1035
00:44:29,242 --> 00:44:31,664
Today's sunday, and all
days aren't sunday to me.

1036
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:33,293
Also, that little
exhibition last night

1037
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:36,760
was my first and last
performance. Good-bye.

1038
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:38,932
She's always saying good-bye to me!

1039
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:40,435
Now, look here! If you
two don't stop fighting,

1040
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,398
i'm leaving...
to get ready!

1041
00:44:42,482 --> 00:44:43,943
Helen's a funny
girl, ain't she?

1042
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:46,325
Yes, helen's a very
funny girl, but i ain't.

1043
00:44:46,408 --> 00:44:47,577
Hey, hey, wait!

1044
00:44:47,661 --> 00:44:49,540
That curl on the back of your neck-

1045
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:51,379
it curls
the wrong way!

1046
00:44:51,462 --> 00:44:52,172
Oh, it does?

1047
00:44:52,214 --> 00:44:53,842
Yeah, here-
let me look.

1048
00:44:53,885 --> 00:44:55,388
Well, i'll be-

1049
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,560
it curls
counterclockwise!

1050
00:44:58,437 --> 00:44:59,188
Is that bad?

1051
00:44:59,273 --> 00:45:00,275
That shouldn't be.

1052
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,196
Smoke, vines, and water twist clockwise

1053
00:45:02,238 --> 00:45:03,449
in the northern
hemisphere, see?

1054
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:04,493
A woman's hair, too.

1055
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,662
Really?

1056
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:06,665
But south
of the equator,

1057
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:08,168
a girl's hair curls
counterclockwise,

1058
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:09,338
from right
to left, see?

1059
00:45:09,422 --> 00:45:11,009
Well, perhaps i'm in
the wrong hemisphere.

1060
00:45:11,093 --> 00:45:13,431
Hmm! That curl
sure crosses me up!

1061
00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:15,645
Oh, your original
research was wrong.

1062
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:16,856
No, no, no-

1063
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:18,903
where's
your bathroom?

1064
00:45:18,987 --> 00:45:20,323
Come in here.
I'll show you.

1065
00:45:21,744 --> 00:45:23,456
Is that curl natural
in your hair?

1066
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,586
Get out of here,
please!

1067
00:45:25,628 --> 00:45:27,883
Y- you just didn't train it that
way to be contrary?

1068
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:29,094
Ooh! Who's going
to take a bath?

1069
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:30,849
No, no! No bath,
honey-scientific experiment.

1070
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:31,935
Come here.
Bend over.

1071
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:33,188
Let me look at the back of your neck.

1072
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,900
What is this, a booby trap or something?

1073
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:36,905
No, no, no-
there, you see?

1074
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:38,325
Her hair
curls clockwise.

1075
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:39,787
Now, watch
the water whirl.

1076
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,300
See?
Left to right, see?

1077
00:45:45,384 --> 00:45:46,553
Everything north
of the equator

1078
00:45:46,595 --> 00:45:47,806
is left to right
but you.

1079
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,310
I'm so sorry.

1080
00:45:49,394 --> 00:45:50,981
That sure
crosses me up.

1081
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:53,487
I had it doped out that the
gimmick is like two clocks,

1082
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:54,322
running opposite
to one another.

1083
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:55,408
The gimmick?

1084
00:45:55,492 --> 00:45:57,120
Yeah, yeah. The world,
honey-two clocks.

1085
00:45:57,204 --> 00:45:58,289
Oh, that's cute!

1086
00:45:58,374 --> 00:45:59,752
But she's got a
southern hemisphere curl.

1087
00:45:59,836 --> 00:46:01,548
You dead sure you
didn't train it that way?

1088
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,968
Quite sure,
mr. Aristotle.

1089
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,928
Well, what
do you know?

1090
00:46:04,013 --> 00:46:05,098
I've been in a lot of bathtubs,

1091
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:06,309
but i never watched how the water ran.

1092
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,020
Did you, emily?

1093
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,021
No.

1094
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:09,484
Get in
the tub, emily.

1095
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:18,631
Oh, that was a very shocking
remark. I don't blame emily.

1096
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:21,262
You weren't
shocked.

1097
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:24,937
Mmm, not in here.

1098
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,065
Hmm?

1099
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:28,320
After all, you'll get
me in bad with emily.

1100
00:46:28,405 --> 00:46:29,282
Oh.

1101
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:37,969
I'm just crazy
for the ocean.

1102
00:46:38,053 --> 00:46:39,055
It's so
kind of simple.

1103
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:40,391
Simple and dumb.

1104
00:46:40,434 --> 00:46:41,937
But in
a cute way, harry.

1105
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:45,738
I mean, one little wave piles
on top of the other little wave,

1106
00:46:45,822 --> 00:46:48,160
and the fish
just swim around.

1107
00:46:48,244 --> 00:46:50,374
What makes it
so black out?

1108
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:51,919
Too many women have been crying into it.

1109
00:46:52,004 --> 00:46:52,755
Oh...

1110
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:53,924
yeah, women cry
in the dark.

1111
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:55,219
That's what makes the ocean black.

1112
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:57,725
Hasn't he got
the weirdest ideas?

1113
00:46:57,809 --> 00:46:59,479
Patterson
and einstein.

1114
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:01,693
I don't care for the ocean
when it looks so black.

1115
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,946
Well, that's
easily fixed.

1116
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:03,823
How?

1117
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:04,993
Well, just bail
all the tears

1118
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:06,663
back into all the women
who have ever cried.

1119
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:08,836
Now, you know, that's
a brilliant thought.

1120
00:47:08,878 --> 00:47:12,010
The truth is, it's the
men who do all the crying.

1121
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:14,432
More tripe
out of books!

1122
00:47:14,516 --> 00:47:16,395
You two start fightin'
again, i'll jump out.

1123
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,356
She started it.

1124
00:47:17,398 --> 00:47:19,277
Oh, i won't say
another word.

1125
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,573
Thanks.

1126
00:47:22,995 --> 00:47:26,211
* clang clang clang went the trolley *

1127
00:47:26,295 --> 00:47:29,761
* ding ding ding
went the bell *

1128
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:31,348
there it is,
harry.

1129
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,183
Hmm.

1130
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:33,520
Emily, wake up.
We're here.

1131
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:35,775
Not bad. How'd you
get ahold of it, emily?

1132
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:38,949
My folks left it to me-the
old homestead, you know?

1133
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:40,829
Turn here, harry,
turn here.

1134
00:47:40,913 --> 00:47:42,207
It's just
a headache, harry.

1135
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,004
I've been after em a long
time to sell the thing.

1136
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:45,257
Who's buying it?

1137
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:47,387
I put an ad in the paper
saying i'd be out today

1138
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:49,809
and i had one telephone
call from a mr. Buckley.

1139
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:51,772
Well, look
- that must be the buckleys now.

1140
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:54,403
Ready money!
A nice, quick sale!

1141
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:00,167
Mr. Buckley?

1142
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,045
Yes. Miss sears?

1143
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:02,047
I'm sorry
i'm late.

1144
00:48:02,131 --> 00:48:03,384
Not at all.
We looked around,

1145
00:48:03,468 --> 00:48:04,888
but it isn't
quite what we want.

1146
00:48:04,972 --> 00:48:06,433
Oh, the place
looks shabby,

1147
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,354
but people with taste could
make things very charming.

1148
00:48:08,396 --> 00:48:10,526
Yes, yes, it does
have possibilities.

1149
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,366
Miss sears,
mrs. Buckley.

1150
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:14,535
Miss sears.

1151
00:48:14,578 --> 00:48:15,747
I'm so glad you could
come, mrs. Buckley.

1152
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:17,167
I wanted you
to see the house.

1153
00:48:17,209 --> 00:48:18,253
Thank you.

1154
00:48:18,337 --> 00:48:20,091
Excuse me. What price you askin', emily?

1155
00:48:20,175 --> 00:48:22,388
Oh, why, 8,500.

1156
00:48:22,472 --> 00:48:24,769
It's 10 acres and all
fit for cultivation.

1157
00:48:24,811 --> 00:48:26,690
What? Why, it's a steal at that price.

1158
00:48:26,774 --> 00:48:28,820
Mr. And mrs. Buckley,
miss melohn, mr. Patterson.

1159
00:48:28,904 --> 00:48:30,658
How do you do?

1160
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,412
You people ever done any dirt farming?

1161
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:35,085
Oh, no. We just want
a place for the weekend.

1162
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,258
Yes. Build a pool, keep
a few horses, and...

1163
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,636
well, then you got
no problems at all.

1164
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,889
Slap on
a little paint,

1165
00:48:39,973 --> 00:48:41,769
hire a couple guys, clean
off the rattlesnakes,

1166
00:48:41,811 --> 00:48:42,729
fill up
the gopher holes-

1167
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:44,775
rattlesnakes!

1168
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:45,987
Why, rattlesnakes in
california? How silly!

1169
00:48:46,071 --> 00:48:48,660
Helen, have you ever
seen a snake on this farm?

1170
00:48:48,744 --> 00:48:50,247
Well, maybe it was texas
i was thinking of.

1171
00:48:50,331 --> 00:48:51,500
Yeah, yeah, texas.

1172
00:48:51,584 --> 00:48:53,380
Well, we'll think it over
and look around a bit.

1173
00:48:53,422 --> 00:48:54,591
Thank you, miss sears.
I'll call you.

1174
00:48:54,675 --> 00:48:56,095
Yes.
We'll let you know.

1175
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:58,016
Thank you.

1176
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,160
Do you know
what i think?

1177
00:49:06,203 --> 00:49:09,043
There's only one
snake on this farm.

1178
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:10,672
Aw, they wasn't
gonna buy.

1179
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,097
Why, it'd be a crime to sell a
farm like this for a dude ranch.

1180
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,106
Yes, sir! Good,
rich dirt! Smell it!

1181
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,947
Well, you could
grow food here,

1182
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,327
not a crop of fat dames,
torturin' horses,

1183
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:24,997
wastin' water
in a fancy pool!

1184
00:49:25,082 --> 00:49:27,880
Yes, sir! Good, rich dirt
that ain't doin' its job!

1185
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,175
If you're
so fond of dirt,

1186
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:31,138
you can buy this farm
at a big bargain.

1187
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,307
Say, that's
an idea, harry.

1188
00:49:32,391 --> 00:49:34,312
Oh, no, not me.
I'm shippin' out.

1189
00:49:34,354 --> 00:49:35,815
This is a proposition for some guy

1190
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,985
who wants to get married, settle down,

1191
00:49:37,069 --> 00:49:37,904
and have
a lot of kids.

1192
00:49:37,988 --> 00:49:38,990
Well, that
couldn't be you.

1193
00:49:39,074 --> 00:49:40,243
When are you
shippin' out, harry?

1194
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:42,707
I don't go to sea
until my money's spent.

1195
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:47,636
Pretty good barn.
Any hay in it?

1196
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,142
No.

1197
00:49:50,226 --> 00:49:51,687
Isn't it sweet?

1198
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:52,689
Mmm.

1199
00:49:52,774 --> 00:49:54,110
Huh, harry?

1200
00:49:55,029 --> 00:49:56,657
My goodness,
em...

1201
00:49:56,742 --> 00:49:57,827
stuffy!

1202
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,832
After that library,
how would she know?

1203
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:05,304
Nice, homey folks.

1204
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:07,309
Not yours, emily?

1205
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:13,323
Yes, mine. Aunts,
uncles, and grandma.

1206
00:50:13,365 --> 00:50:15,703
And it all boiled
down to you, huh?

1207
00:50:18,043 --> 00:50:19,546
Mmm mmm!

1208
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,219
Hey, got a kitchen.
Yes, sir...

1209
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:25,435
mmm!
Got an icebox, too.

1210
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,527
Yep, plenty
of nothing in it.

1211
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:32,119
T'ain't bad, emily.

1212
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:33,079
Not bad.

1213
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,332
What do you got
upstairs?

1214
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,501
The bedrooms.

1215
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:36,670
Well, let's
take a look at them.

1216
00:50:36,713 --> 00:50:38,467
Hey!
Wait for me!

1217
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:41,474
Hello!
Where'd you come from?

1218
00:50:44,106 --> 00:50:45,567
Mmm!

1219
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:04,530
Hmm hmm.

1220
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:17,478
Hey, downstairs!

1221
00:51:17,562 --> 00:51:18,898
Where'd you get this?

1222
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,025
What?

1223
00:51:20,068 --> 00:51:22,406
This big pile
of feathers!

1224
00:51:24,245 --> 00:51:26,500
That's the bed
i was born in.

1225
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,886
Some bed.

1226
00:51:33,016 --> 00:51:35,229
Oh, i love it
here, emily. I love it!

1227
00:51:35,313 --> 00:51:36,273
Don't you, harry?

1228
00:51:36,357 --> 00:51:38,821
Yeah, yeah.
It's ok. It's swell.

1229
00:51:38,905 --> 00:51:40,575
Emily, you know
what we could do?

1230
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:42,079
Yes, i know...

1231
00:51:42,163 --> 00:51:43,583
but i have to work
in the morning.

1232
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,878
I have a job
in the library.

1233
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:46,255
Well, i work, too,
don't i?

1234
00:51:46,298 --> 00:51:48,177
We could leave early in the
morning and make it easy.

1235
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:49,472
Mm-hmm.

1236
00:51:50,642 --> 00:51:52,730
I have an idea i've
already been outvoted.

1237
00:51:52,814 --> 00:51:55,152
Most suspicious girl
i ever ran into.

1238
00:51:55,236 --> 00:51:57,240
If we're staying,
i can cook.

1239
00:51:57,283 --> 00:51:59,580
You can cook, yeah,
but what?

1240
00:51:59,622 --> 00:52:01,083
All right,
all right.

1241
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:02,880
I'll go to tony's.
He'll be open.

1242
00:52:02,922 --> 00:52:04,216
You get some wood
for the stove.

1243
00:52:04,258 --> 00:52:05,218
I'll drive you
in my bus.

1244
00:52:05,261 --> 00:52:06,764
I'll get
the wood.

1245
00:52:06,848 --> 00:52:08,769
I'd rather walk.

1246
00:52:08,853 --> 00:52:10,064
Got any dough?

1247
00:52:10,106 --> 00:52:11,860
Don't put yourself out.

1248
00:52:11,902 --> 00:52:12,862
Don't worry.

1249
00:52:21,216 --> 00:52:24,682
Hey! Now, don't you two
get to fighting again!

1250
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:29,485
You been to naples?

1251
00:52:29,528 --> 00:52:30,739
Yeah,
i been there, tony.

1252
00:52:30,822 --> 00:52:32,450
Beautiful
- girls beautiful. Everything beautiful.

1253
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:34,957
Ah, beautiful,
yes, and no fog!

1254
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:36,669
Gotta the blue seas
there.

1255
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,173
A'blue, a'blue
a'blue blue!

1256
00:52:38,215 --> 00:52:39,050
No meat?

1257
00:52:39,134 --> 00:52:40,052
No meat.

1258
00:52:40,136 --> 00:52:42,015
No meat. Well,
that's all then, tony.

1259
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,144
Well, uh...

1260
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:45,482
that's a... beautiful $1.45, miss emily.

1261
00:52:45,566 --> 00:52:46,484
$1.45?

1262
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:47,613
Hold it, emily.
Hold it.

1263
00:52:47,655 --> 00:52:50,035
Uh, tony, you ever, uh, roll 'em, tony?

1264
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:52,332
Uh, roll you double
or nothin', huh?

1265
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:53,710
Ok, ok!

1266
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,006
No, no, tony.

1267
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,049
My pal.

1268
00:52:56,133 --> 00:52:57,803
Oh, miss emily my friend, miss emily.

1269
00:52:57,888 --> 00:53:00,352
I justa say, "naples!" never loses.

1270
00:53:00,436 --> 00:53:01,271
How many roll?

1271
00:53:01,354 --> 00:53:03,525
One roll.
- Ok!

1272
00:53:06,032 --> 00:53:06,783
Ok?

1273
00:53:06,826 --> 00:53:07,619
Ok.

1274
00:53:07,703 --> 00:53:08,872
Ho ho! Lovely.

1275
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,712
Naples!

1276
00:53:15,096 --> 00:53:16,265
No naples!

1277
00:53:17,226 --> 00:53:18,520
Naples
done you wrong, pal.

1278
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:21,528
Heh heh.
Ok, ok, mister.

1279
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,864
Beautiful a'dice!
Beautiful!

1280
00:53:22,907 --> 00:53:24,327
Ok, emily.
Come along.

1281
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,370
Good-bye, tone.

1282
00:53:25,454 --> 00:53:26,707
Good-bye,
good-bye.

1283
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:27,876
Good-bye, tony.

1284
00:53:27,919 --> 00:53:29,046
Good-bye, good-bye.

1285
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:30,215
See you.
Take it easy.

1286
00:53:30,299 --> 00:53:32,136
It's a'beautiful,
beautiful...

1287
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:34,392
thievery,
plain thievery.

1288
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:36,313
Science.

1289
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:39,655
Such a nice
little man, too.

1290
00:53:42,788 --> 00:53:44,166
Shh!

1291
00:53:46,463 --> 00:53:47,716
What's wrong?

1292
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,053
It's a chicken.

1293
00:53:49,137 --> 00:53:50,431
Oh, what of it?

1294
00:53:50,473 --> 00:53:53,146
Goes great
with macaroni.

1295
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,237
You think farmer ludlow's going
to roll dice for a chicken-

1296
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:58,910
i'm not rolling dice with
farmer ludlow. Don't worry.

1297
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:00,246
Well, he's not going
to sell his chickens.

1298
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:01,750
He's crazy
about his chickens.

1299
00:54:01,792 --> 00:54:03,588
Let's take
a peek at 'em.

1300
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,426
If you think you're going
to steal a chicken from him-

1301
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:07,806
i just said
take a peek at 'em.

1302
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:12,317
Chickens are sure
doing nice on that corn, effy.

1303
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:14,656
Well, you can
give 'em all my share.

1304
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,413
I don't know
why corn ever grows!

1305
00:54:17,497 --> 00:54:19,418
Mrs. Ludlow
doesn't like corn.

1306
00:54:19,502 --> 00:54:21,089
And i don't like
mrs. Ludlow.

1307
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:22,216
Mean?

1308
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,137
Mean. Mmm mmm!

1309
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:25,474
Mr. Ludlow?

1310
00:54:25,558 --> 00:54:27,270
Mmm mmm!

1311
00:54:27,354 --> 00:54:28,439
Mean.

1312
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:29,650
Mmm.

1313
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:36,166
Oh!

1314
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:37,336
Can you imitate
a rooster?

1315
00:54:37,378 --> 00:54:38,338
Now, look here!
If you think-

1316
00:54:38,381 --> 00:54:40,177
can you imitate
a rooster?

1317
00:54:40,218 --> 00:54:42,348
I think so.
L- i never tried,

1318
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:43,851
but if
farmer ludlow-

1319
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:45,188
never mind
farmer ludlow.

1320
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,190
Make like
a rooster.

1321
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,193
What for?

1322
00:54:47,235 --> 00:54:48,571
Want to catch us
a hen.

1323
00:54:49,616 --> 00:54:51,662
Well, i bet
it won't work, but...

1324
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,168
here goes.

1325
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:58,178
Cock-a-doodle-do!

1326
00:55:03,023 --> 00:55:07,784
Cock-a-doodle-do!

1327
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:15,679
I thought you said
we'd catch us a hen.

1328
00:55:15,763 --> 00:55:17,517
We will, but
hens are realists.

1329
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,899
No hen would come running
for a rooster she can't see.

1330
00:55:25,578 --> 00:55:27,081
What'd you do
that for?

1331
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:29,921
That line
hypnotizes him.

1332
00:55:29,964 --> 00:55:32,219
That's why some people stay in ruts.

1333
00:55:32,261 --> 00:55:34,558
There's a line like that
on the library floor.

1334
00:55:34,642 --> 00:55:36,062
Stick with
your chickens.

1335
00:55:36,103 --> 00:55:38,734
Ok. Now, here's
a rooster in a rut.

1336
00:55:38,777 --> 00:55:40,238
He wanted
war and glory,

1337
00:55:40,322 --> 00:55:42,201
so he came out here to
fight another rooster.

1338
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:44,081
A rooster's got
imagination, see?

1339
00:55:44,165 --> 00:55:47,506
That's why that corny
imitation of yours fooled him.

1340
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:49,260
Now make
like a hen, emily.

1341
00:55:49,344 --> 00:55:51,599
Oh, no, now we really
have a rooster.

1342
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:52,768
I should
imitate a rooster.

1343
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:55,023
Nope.
Make like a hen.

1344
00:55:55,108 --> 00:55:57,906
Oh, all right, sailor.
I'll prove you wrong.

1345
00:56:10,812 --> 00:56:12,065
You see?

1346
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:13,777
It doesn't
make sense.

1347
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,741
If she was going to
chase after this rooster,

1348
00:56:15,783 --> 00:56:18,121
why shouldn't i have
made rooster noises?

1349
00:56:18,163 --> 00:56:19,917
No hen wants a rooster
unless she's afraid

1350
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,253
some other hen's
going to get him!

1351
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,261
What'd you do
that for?

1352
00:56:24,345 --> 00:56:26,600
What? Oh, pullets
are better eatin'.

1353
00:56:26,642 --> 00:56:28,270
Besides, i could
never kill a rooster.

1354
00:56:28,355 --> 00:56:29,942
Life means
too much to him.

1355
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:32,238
Make like a hen
some more.

1356
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:40,174
Oh!

1357
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:42,012
Aah!

1358
00:56:42,054 --> 00:56:44,100
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1359
00:56:44,185 --> 00:56:46,523
What's wrong
with the chickens?!

1360
00:56:46,565 --> 00:56:48,361
Ain't nothin' the
matter with them chickens.

1361
00:56:51,577 --> 00:56:54,041
Something's wrong with
those chickens, i tell you!

1362
00:56:54,084 --> 00:56:55,420
Get my gun!

1363
00:56:55,504 --> 00:56:56,631
Them dogs again!

1364
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:12,502
Oh!

1365
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,772
Oh!

1366
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:22,861
Harry! Harry!

1367
00:57:22,945 --> 00:57:24,030
Ok, emily?

1368
00:57:24,114 --> 00:57:25,032
Ok.

1369
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:28,583
Shh...

1370
00:57:44,372 --> 00:57:46,042
if he comes closer,
i'll trip him!

1371
00:57:46,126 --> 00:57:47,211
No, no, no!

1372
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:49,258
You take one leg, and
i'll take the other!

1373
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:50,845
You're crazy.

1374
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,022
He's gone.

1375
00:57:55,106 --> 00:57:56,860
Come on. Let's get
out of here.

1376
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:02,039
What's all
the shootin' for?

1377
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:05,881
Oh, helen!

1378
00:58:05,966 --> 00:58:06,884
We got chickens!

1379
00:58:06,968 --> 00:58:07,886
What happened?

1380
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,055
Oh, look at you!

1381
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,729
Old man what's-his-name
took a shot at us!

1382
00:58:11,813 --> 00:58:12,982
He did?

1383
00:58:13,024 --> 00:58:14,778
We had lots more,
but they got away!

1384
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,738
Was it fun?

1385
00:58:15,823 --> 00:58:17,451
Oh, was it!
Ha ha!

1386
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:19,539
Of course, we'll go back and
pay him for them, won't we?

1387
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:21,837
Helen,
my old pal, helen!

1388
00:58:21,921 --> 00:58:23,758
Harry, harry!

1389
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,635
Oh, i missed you!

1390
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:25,679
Did you
miss me, pal?

1391
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:27,767
Oh, brother,
i missed you!

1392
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,773
Helen, do you know what
you can do with a rooster?

1393
00:58:29,857 --> 00:58:31,778
You can draw a line
and hypnotize him!

1394
00:58:31,861 --> 00:58:33,281
We got macaroni!
Goes good with chicken!

1395
00:58:33,365 --> 00:58:34,868
You did?
- Mm-hmm.

1396
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,166
* old macdonald
had a farm *

1397
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,421
* ee-yl-ee-yl-oh *

1398
00:58:39,505 --> 00:58:40,590
* and on that farm-*

1399
00:58:40,674 --> 00:58:42,386
he said,
"make like a hen,"

1400
00:58:42,429 --> 00:58:43,682
and so i said...

1401
00:58:43,723 --> 00:58:45,602
* with a chick-chick here
and a chick-chick there *

1402
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:46,647
* here a chick,
there a chick *

1403
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,733
* everywhere
a chick-chick *

1404
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,905
* old macdonald
had a farm *

1405
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:51,534
* ee-yl-ee-yl-oh *

1406
00:58:51,576 --> 00:58:54,374
* oh! And on that farm
he had some ducks *

1407
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:55,878
* ee-yl-ee-yl-oh *

1408
00:58:55,961 --> 00:58:56,838
* with a quack quack here

1409
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,924
* and a quack quack there *

1410
00:58:58,008 --> 00:58:58,968
* here a quack,
there a quack *

1411
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,012
* everywhere
a quack quack *

1412
00:59:00,055 --> 00:59:01,851
* old macdonald
had a farm *

1413
00:59:01,892 --> 00:59:04,356
* ee-yl-ee-yl-oh *

1414
00:59:21,565 --> 00:59:22,818
was you ever
married, helen?

1415
00:59:22,902 --> 00:59:24,489
Almost, once.

1416
00:59:24,572 --> 00:59:25,657
What broke it up?

1417
00:59:25,742 --> 00:59:28,206
Oh, we got tired of
each other. I don't know.

1418
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:29,668
Sure, like
everything else.

1419
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:31,672
It all ends nowhere.

1420
00:59:31,756 --> 00:59:33,552
Don't you believe
in marriage at all?

1421
00:59:33,594 --> 00:59:35,765
No. Dull.

1422
00:59:35,808 --> 00:59:37,645
Gee, you say that
like you mean it.

1423
00:59:37,729 --> 00:59:39,566
I'll say i mean it,

1424
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,196
and i ain't just
pickin' on marriage.

1425
00:59:41,237 --> 00:59:44,077
I mean anything that
starts out exciting, see?

1426
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:46,249
Just leaks
itself to death.

1427
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,381
All the zip,
all the... everything.

1428
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:52,055
You tell me one thing
that stays exciting.

1429
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:53,392
Just one.

1430
00:59:53,434 --> 00:59:55,564
I hate to think.

1431
00:59:55,606 --> 00:59:56,566
Yeah.

1432
00:59:56,608 --> 00:59:58,612
Well, let's don't.
Let's just-

1433
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:01,118
in the first place, you
can't think on land, helen.

1434
01:00:01,202 --> 01:00:02,455
You got to
be out there.

1435
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:03,666
What's out there?

1436
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:04,835
The sea...

1437
01:00:04,878 --> 01:00:07,091
it's the only road there
is that leads to it.

1438
01:00:07,175 --> 01:00:08,344
What's it?

1439
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:10,850
It?

1440
01:00:12,187 --> 01:00:13,565
It's just it.

1441
01:00:13,649 --> 01:00:16,280
I know what "it" is.

1442
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:17,616
What?

1443
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:19,329
This.

1444
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:29,520
I think the time has
come for me to retire.

1445
01:00:29,604 --> 01:00:30,689
It's early, emily.

1446
01:00:30,774 --> 01:00:32,194
Is it?
I wouldn't know it.

1447
01:00:32,278 --> 01:00:34,032
Everything leaks
to death, he says.

1448
01:00:34,115 --> 01:00:35,869
It looked for awhile
as if today never would.

1449
01:00:35,953 --> 01:00:37,874
The dullest day
i ever spent in my life.

1450
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:40,923
Why, emily, that doesn't speak
very well for present company.

1451
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:43,053
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
that way. It's just that l-

1452
01:00:43,095 --> 01:00:45,851
i'm sorry for emily
- nice girl, don't know what she wants.

1453
01:00:45,936 --> 01:00:47,021
Of course, you do.

1454
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:48,984
The sea's
the only road to it.

1455
01:00:49,068 --> 01:00:51,574
My old friend, "it."

1456
01:00:51,658 --> 01:00:53,871
I love the way helen
puts it. What is "it"?

1457
01:00:53,913 --> 01:00:56,126
Why, emily, you
sound cross, dear.

1458
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,504
What about?

1459
01:00:57,547 --> 01:01:00,637
Well, i don't know.
I... everything's been so pleasant.

1460
01:01:00,721 --> 01:01:03,018
Ok, i'll call it a day!

1461
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:06,192
I'll go up and dream of
the sea, the road to "it."

1462
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:09,701
Oh, to hear a big,
grown man talk of "it!"

1463
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:11,873
It's so silly!

1464
01:01:11,915 --> 01:01:14,337
Nobody's asking you
any opinion, you know.

1465
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,049
Did i say anyone
was asking for-

1466
01:01:16,133 --> 01:01:16,926
emily!

1467
01:01:17,011 --> 01:01:18,222
And i'm not
asking for yours!

1468
01:01:18,305 --> 01:01:20,894
Don't you sit there and say
i don't know what i want!

1469
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:22,691
Hot air! You could
start a furnace!

1470
01:01:22,775 --> 01:01:24,571
You're nothing but
a first-class soapbox!

1471
01:01:24,654 --> 01:01:26,575
Emily! She never
talked like this!

1472
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:28,538
What's the matter, pal?
I thought we made up.

1473
01:01:28,622 --> 01:01:30,250
I did, too!
I thought th-that-

1474
01:01:30,293 --> 01:01:32,631
in the first place, we
had nothing to make up.

1475
01:01:32,673 --> 01:01:35,304
I seem irritated? I suppose i
thought you were worth talking to,

1476
01:01:35,347 --> 01:01:36,808
and what i heard-
i've heard nothing!

1477
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,105
Life is dull!
What news!

1478
01:01:39,189 --> 01:01:40,442
And the brilliant
summary?

1479
01:01:40,526 --> 01:01:42,781
The answer dwells
across the sea!

1480
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,326
You're a dope!

1481
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,291
Stick to your tomatoes!
You've got your answer!

1482
01:01:47,376 --> 01:01:50,299
A good crack on the
jaw would do you good.

1483
01:01:50,383 --> 01:01:52,095
If that would do it,
i'd love it!

1484
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:53,807
I'd love to look up
to a man,

1485
01:01:53,891 --> 01:01:56,564
but i don't think
you hit hard enough!

1486
01:01:56,648 --> 01:01:58,736
I'd rather he hit me
than listen to him!

1487
01:01:58,778 --> 01:02:00,908
Words come out of his mouth, you
think you're going to hear something.

1488
01:02:00,992 --> 01:02:05,085
You get hit with
feathers! It, it, it, it!

1489
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:06,296
Get down!

1490
01:02:08,886 --> 01:02:11,308
Nobody talks to me
and gets away with it!

1491
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:12,853
"It"? I'll tell you
what "it" is!

1492
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,568
"It's" the excitement, see?
Excitement that don't die!

1493
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:17,489
I've seen life
important! Oh, have i!

1494
01:02:17,532 --> 01:02:18,952
Just let 'em think
they're gonna lose it!

1495
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:21,500
I've seen women and children
trampled on to get into lifeboats

1496
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:23,713
and then they're all
safe and all bored again!

1497
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:26,344
All bored! For life
to be exciting,

1498
01:02:26,387 --> 01:02:28,600
you'd have to have
a shipwreck every day!

1499
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:33,988
So that's what i'm
looking for, wise guy-

1500
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:36,661
life exciting. You can
throw the shipwrecks away!

1501
01:02:36,745 --> 01:02:38,666
That's all. Just
an easy pick-up!

1502
01:02:40,086 --> 01:02:42,341
And if i say the sea is the
only road that leads to it,

1503
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,596
it's because the sea
sounds like it.

1504
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:47,771
She does the talking,
you do the listening.

1505
01:02:47,813 --> 01:02:50,778
She sings out there.
She's full of bands.

1506
01:02:52,909 --> 01:02:54,746
And if i picked
on you to talk to,

1507
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:56,960
it was because of the ocean
in your eyes that did it.

1508
01:02:57,044 --> 01:03:00,343
I never saw it
in no eyes before...

1509
01:03:00,427 --> 01:03:02,974
and i'll call it
a day, too.

1510
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:06,233
And i'm sick
to death of you!

1511
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:21,790
Oh! Oh!

1512
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:24,881
Why do sailors
drive so fast?

1513
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:27,345
Hey, hey, that's how
sailors get wrecked!

1514
01:04:27,387 --> 01:04:30,686
I'm high, and i haven't had
a drop to drink. Are you high?

1515
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:32,483
Yeah, blowin' about
a force 9 gale!

1516
01:04:32,525 --> 01:04:34,989
Oh, you're not a gale,
you're a tornado.

1517
01:04:35,073 --> 01:04:37,328
You're not exactly a
low-pressure area yourself.

1518
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:38,623
Oh, ha ha!

1519
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:41,797
Oh, you do say the
sweetest, most poetic things.

1520
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:44,470
Uh-oh.
That ain't poetry.

1521
01:04:44,554 --> 01:04:45,472
Yes, it is, too.

1522
01:04:45,556 --> 01:04:47,143
No, we're
running out of gas.

1523
01:04:47,185 --> 01:04:49,315
Oh, we've been running
on gas power?

1524
01:04:49,399 --> 01:04:50,986
Yeah, and we're
slowed down to 60.

1525
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:52,323
Well, now that
we've slowed down,

1526
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:53,993
couldn't you drive
with one hand?

1527
01:04:54,077 --> 01:04:55,455
Sure.

1528
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:57,669
Thanks, sailor.

1529
01:05:00,593 --> 01:05:02,848
Hey, thar she blows!
Good old reno!

1530
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,769
Boy, this is one town i'm
really going to show you!

1531
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:05,897
Oh, it's
a waste of money.

1532
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:07,192
Now, how do you
figure that?

1533
01:05:07,275 --> 01:05:09,989
Because i won't look at
anything, really, except you.

1534
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:11,535
You're
acting stubborn.

1535
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:13,665
When i feel poetic,
i feel poetic.

1536
01:05:13,749 --> 01:05:16,255
Do you ever hear of
elizabeth barrett browning?

1537
01:05:16,339 --> 01:05:18,009
Sure, sonnets from
the portuguese.

1538
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:19,053
Why, harry!

1539
01:05:19,096 --> 01:05:20,516
Heard it
on a quiz program.

1540
01:05:20,558 --> 01:05:23,523
Ah, ha ha!
No, listen...

1541
01:05:23,565 --> 01:05:24,859
"unless you can muse

1542
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:26,362
"in a crowd all day

1543
01:05:26,405 --> 01:05:28,702
"on the absent face
that fixed you,

1544
01:05:28,744 --> 01:05:31,041
"unless you can love
as the angels made

1545
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,879
"with the breath
of heaven betwixt you,

1546
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,885
"unless you can dream
that his love will last

1547
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,893
"through behoving
and unbehoving,

1548
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:41,900
"unless you can die
when the dream is past,

1549
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:44,782
oh, never
call it loving."

1550
01:05:44,824 --> 01:05:46,578
Do you like it?

1551
01:05:46,662 --> 01:05:48,082
Boy, you are high!

1552
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:49,126
Mm-hmm!

1553
01:05:49,168 --> 01:05:51,298
That's just
how i feel.

1554
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,430
You take charge of the poetry,
em. I'll take charge of reno.

1555
01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:56,269
Ah...

1556
01:05:57,438 --> 01:05:58,983
oh, harry, look!

1557
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:00,403
Oh, what luck!

1558
01:06:00,446 --> 01:06:02,409
Yeah, only 3 miles.

1559
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:04,914
Oh, no! I mean
the other sign-that!

1560
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,094
Oh... ha ha!

1561
01:06:10,136 --> 01:06:11,263
All right, emily.

1562
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:12,265
Oh!

1563
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:14,437
Only that?
Just "all right"?

1564
01:06:14,521 --> 01:06:16,275
No, but let's see
if we can make reno.

1565
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:18,155
Oh, ha ha!

1566
01:06:31,897 --> 01:06:36,031
* i'm free again *

1567
01:06:36,073 --> 01:06:37,701
* oh, me, oh, my *

1568
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,498
* oh,
i'm free again *

1569
01:06:39,582 --> 01:06:40,333
ha ha ha!

1570
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:41,335
Hey!

1571
01:06:41,378 --> 01:06:42,213
No, you!

1572
01:06:42,297 --> 01:06:43,675
Are you looking
for a new girl?

1573
01:06:43,759 --> 01:06:44,469
What's your name?

1574
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:45,345
Uh, grace.

1575
01:06:45,429 --> 01:06:47,517
Well, here she is-
this is grace.

1576
01:06:47,601 --> 01:06:49,689
Ok, gracie,
show him no mercy.

1577
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:51,485
Remember, george, everything
that you did before,

1578
01:06:51,569 --> 01:06:52,738
and don't
do it again!

1579
01:07:53,176 --> 01:07:55,139
Oh, yes!
Ha ha ha!

1580
01:07:55,181 --> 01:07:56,893
Mm-hmm!

1581
01:07:56,977 --> 01:07:58,522
Ha ha!

1582
01:07:58,606 --> 01:08:01,863
Your chuckle, my love,
is a deep laugh.

1583
01:08:01,948 --> 01:08:03,242
I'm chucklin', all right.

1584
01:08:03,242 --> 01:08:04,912
First time we've been in a room.

1585
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:07,419
That's right...

1586
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:11,763
out there-there were walls
out there, high as heaven.

1587
01:08:11,805 --> 01:08:13,433
Wonder where
they stuck my bag?

1588
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:14,226
Oh.

1589
01:08:14,269 --> 01:08:15,605
Where did we
buy the bag?

1590
01:08:15,647 --> 01:08:16,941
Must have been
in a store.

1591
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,657
Oh, i got
a new hat out of it.

1592
01:08:30,182 --> 01:08:31,476
Ice water, sir?

1593
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:32,855
Yeah, come in.

1594
01:08:38,536 --> 01:08:39,705
Thank you.

1595
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:40,832
Thank you, sir!

1596
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:43,046
I'll buy my girl
a present!

1597
01:08:44,425 --> 01:08:46,513
Oh, uh, you and the missus
like anything else, sir?

1598
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:47,682
Who?

1599
01:08:47,725 --> 01:08:49,521
Mrs.
Patterson.

1600
01:08:49,563 --> 01:08:50,732
Oh!

1601
01:08:50,816 --> 01:08:53,697
Would you like anything
else, uh, mrs. Patterson?

1602
01:08:54,784 --> 01:08:56,830
Uh, no, thank you,
mr. Patterson.

1603
01:08:56,872 --> 01:08:58,333
No, thank you.

1604
01:09:02,302 --> 01:09:06,019
Well, well,
mrs. Patterson.

1605
01:09:08,024 --> 01:09:09,318
What's the matter?

1606
01:09:09,402 --> 01:09:10,153
Darling...

1607
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:11,031
yes, darling?

1608
01:09:11,115 --> 01:09:12,326
Was that my
wedding present-

1609
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:13,620
marrying me?

1610
01:09:13,663 --> 01:09:14,623
I don't get you.

1611
01:09:14,707 --> 01:09:15,834
Why did
you marry me?

1612
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,296
Isn't that what you wanted right away?

1613
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,008
Why, yes, but it
wasn't a command,

1614
01:09:19,092 --> 01:09:21,013
nor was it a favor to
me, anymore than to you.

1615
01:09:21,097 --> 01:09:22,851
Ok, but-

1616
01:09:22,935 --> 01:09:24,313
hey, look,
is that right?

1617
01:09:24,397 --> 01:09:26,568
Are you supposed to give
women presents that marry you?

1618
01:09:26,652 --> 01:09:28,197
Oh, ho ho, dear!

1619
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:30,912
Oh... all right.

1620
01:09:30,954 --> 01:09:32,582
What's
the matter, baby?

1621
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:38,806
Oh, look
at this sailor.

1622
01:09:43,276 --> 01:09:46,199
Whew!
And am i sailing!

1623
01:09:49,123 --> 01:09:50,250
Wha-

1624
01:09:50,334 --> 01:09:51,754
what in the world-

1625
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:53,091
oh, what is this,
darling?

1626
01:09:53,175 --> 01:09:54,678
Oh, just a girl.

1627
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,307
Oh,
just a girl, eh?

1628
01:09:56,349 --> 01:09:57,309
That's all.

1629
01:09:57,351 --> 01:09:58,812
Her name's jeanne,
is that right?

1630
01:09:58,855 --> 01:10:00,149
Pronounced "john."
French.

1631
01:10:00,192 --> 01:10:02,990
Oh, "john."
Mm-hmm.

1632
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,660
Got any others
around you anywhere?

1633
01:10:04,703 --> 01:10:05,997
No, no.

1634
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,127
She was
the one and only, eh?

1635
01:10:08,211 --> 01:10:10,466
No. I didn't
marry her, did i?

1636
01:10:10,508 --> 01:10:12,679
Perhaps
she didn't ask you.

1637
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:16,272
Hey, hey...

1638
01:10:16,356 --> 01:10:18,152
what is
all this, huh?

1639
01:10:18,235 --> 01:10:21,116
Just a minute,
darling, just a minute.

1640
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:22,955
There.

1641
01:10:22,997 --> 01:10:24,751
Harry,
what's my name?

1642
01:10:24,835 --> 01:10:26,129
Emily.

1643
01:10:26,213 --> 01:10:27,591
Don't sound
much alike, do they?

1644
01:10:27,675 --> 01:10:28,677
Nope.

1645
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:30,264
Don't forget it.

1646
01:10:34,065 --> 01:10:36,362
Oh, george!

1647
01:10:36,404 --> 01:10:37,824
Mmm...

1648
01:10:37,908 --> 01:10:38,910
hmm?

1649
01:10:38,952 --> 01:10:41,541
Oh, i'm sorry,
dear, sorry.

1650
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:42,502
Why, you-

1651
01:10:42,586 --> 01:10:44,298
ha ha ha ha!

1652
01:10:45,635 --> 01:10:48,475
That's not a square deal! I got 2 bags!

1653
01:10:48,517 --> 01:10:50,396
But i have to open the door with my key!

1654
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,693
Em, it's your door. You
opened it a million times!

1655
01:10:52,777 --> 01:10:54,447
Oh, but 8 seconds.
Make it 10!

1656
01:10:54,531 --> 01:10:55,909
Ok, go ahead.

1657
01:10:55,993 --> 01:10:57,329
You understand, now,
if i get into the apartment

1658
01:10:57,413 --> 01:10:59,543
before you catch me, you
have to stand outside forever.

1659
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:01,172
Yeah, right
in the hall.

1660
01:11:01,256 --> 01:11:02,174
Ready?

1661
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,346
1... 2...

1662
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,390
3, 4, 5, 6...

1663
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:06,142
oh!

1664
01:11:06,184 --> 01:11:07,645
Ha ha ha! Oh!

1665
01:11:08,315 --> 01:11:09,526
Oh!

1666
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:11,237
Ha ha ha ha!

1667
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:16,918
Harry?

1668
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,090
Yeah?
What's the matter?

1669
01:11:19,132 --> 01:11:21,721
The last time going down
the stairs was sunday,

1670
01:11:21,764 --> 01:11:23,434
on the way
to the farm.

1671
01:11:23,476 --> 01:11:25,439
Yeah. Well?

1672
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,444
Well, you were just
about the last gentleman

1673
01:11:27,486 --> 01:11:29,282
i wanted to see
that morning.

1674
01:11:29,324 --> 01:11:31,245
Yeah, i recall
your greeting.

1675
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,751
And the next time coming
up these same stairs,

1676
01:11:33,835 --> 01:11:36,299
i'm your wife.

1677
01:11:36,382 --> 01:11:38,345
You'd have bet a lot of dough
against that, wouldn't you have?

1678
01:11:38,387 --> 01:11:40,141
I'd have
bet my life.

1679
01:11:40,225 --> 01:11:43,148
I'd have bet the end
of the world first.

1680
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,610
Harry...

1681
01:11:44,694 --> 01:11:45,487
yeah?

1682
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:47,325
I wish
we were in reno.

1683
01:11:47,367 --> 01:11:48,285
Want to go back?

1684
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,377
Oh, no.
Ha ha ha!

1685
01:11:56,055 --> 01:11:58,268
Are you coming in here
with me like a husband?

1686
01:11:58,352 --> 01:12:01,108
Well, i wasn't doing
this sunday, neither.

1687
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:03,447
Hey, am i married, too?

1688
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:06,287
I don't know. I guess so. Ha ha-

1689
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,668
emily!
Oh, emily!

1690
01:12:08,711 --> 01:12:10,507
You ought to be shot!
You heel, you!

1691
01:12:10,548 --> 01:12:11,341
Helen!

1692
01:12:11,384 --> 01:12:12,302
You ought to be
strung up-

1693
01:12:12,344 --> 01:12:14,098
helen!
We're married!

1694
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:14,850
Huh?

1695
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:16,354
Well,
we think we are.

1696
01:12:16,438 --> 01:12:17,983
Oh, don't be dumb, emmy!
You think you are?

1697
01:12:18,066 --> 01:12:20,154
Him, married? He wouldn't
marry his own mother!

1698
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:21,156
Well, you girls
figure it out.

1699
01:12:21,241 --> 01:12:22,159
I'm buying
a little drink.

1700
01:12:22,243 --> 01:12:23,161
Let me know how
you come out.

1701
01:12:23,246 --> 01:12:24,874
Look, look.

1702
01:12:26,712 --> 01:12:27,672
You mean legal?

1703
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:28,508
Yes!

1704
01:12:28,592 --> 01:12:29,469
It isn't forged?

1705
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:30,806
No, of course not.

1706
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:31,849
Oh, darling!

1707
01:12:31,933 --> 01:12:33,854
Oh, helen!
Do you still like me?

1708
01:12:33,938 --> 01:12:35,734
Emily!

1709
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:37,363
Married!
Emily's married!

1710
01:12:37,405 --> 01:12:39,033
Hey! Like me, too, will ya?

1711
01:12:39,076 --> 01:12:40,621
Oh, harry, i thought
she never would!

1712
01:12:40,705 --> 01:12:41,958
She's such a lonesome girl, really.

1713
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,753
She'd go out with me just to
be nice, but she'd hate it.

1714
01:12:43,795 --> 01:12:45,382
She could have every man
in frisco if she wanted,

1715
01:12:45,466 --> 01:12:46,719
and i know she could. You don't know!

1716
01:12:46,803 --> 01:12:47,721
Oh, helen, please!

1717
01:12:47,805 --> 01:12:49,601
She's the
best girl goin'!

1718
01:12:49,685 --> 01:12:51,230
Well, say somethin',
harry! Say somethin'-

1719
01:12:51,314 --> 01:12:52,859
ok, ok, i agree
with you, pal.

1720
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:54,403
Oh, harry!

1721
01:12:54,488 --> 01:12:55,406
Oh!

1722
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:57,035
I love you
for her lovin' you!

1723
01:12:57,077 --> 01:12:58,538
I'm in love
with both of you!

1724
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:01,672
I'm in-i'm in love
with both of you!

1725
01:13:01,714 --> 01:13:03,175
I don't know if i've
ever loved anybody

1726
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:04,887
as much as i love
the two of you!

1727
01:13:04,972 --> 01:13:07,018
Oh, harry, look! You got
lipstick all over you!

1728
01:13:07,102 --> 01:13:09,524
I'm sorry!

1729
01:13:09,608 --> 01:13:11,529
Hey, emily,
you know somethin'?

1730
01:13:11,613 --> 01:13:12,866
The last time
i kissed harry

1731
01:13:12,949 --> 01:13:14,410
was on that sofa
at the farm.

1732
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,917
Do you realize i haven't
seen either one of you since?

1733
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:19,089
I mean, i kiss harry
on the sofa,

1734
01:13:19,131 --> 01:13:20,718
next time i see him
and kiss him again,

1735
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:24,560
a little item, dear! He's
married between kisses!

1736
01:13:24,644 --> 01:13:26,440
Ok, girls, ok.
What do you say?

1737
01:13:26,482 --> 01:13:28,278
This is fine,
but it's a little dry.

1738
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,283
I'll get cleaned up and go
out and get a bucket of wine.

1739
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:31,618
This calls
for a celebration.

1740
01:13:31,661 --> 01:13:32,955
This calls for me to
get out. I get it.

1741
01:13:32,998 --> 01:13:33,958
I'm late
for the office.

1742
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,921
No, no. You're crazy.
No office today.

1743
01:13:36,005 --> 01:13:37,090
We'll celebrate,
the 3 of us!

1744
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:38,093
Really?

1745
01:13:38,177 --> 01:13:40,265
Yes, yes!
Good old reno!

1746
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,061
We brought it back with
us, darling, didn't we?

1747
01:13:42,103 --> 01:13:44,191
You know it!
Hook her, emily, hook her!

1748
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:45,527
Ha ha!

1749
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:48,243
You crazy about him?

1750
01:13:48,326 --> 01:13:49,453
Just crazy.

1751
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:51,166
He crazy about you?

1752
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:52,294
Just crazy.

1753
01:13:52,378 --> 01:13:53,839
Oh...

1754
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:57,431
oh, emily!

1755
01:13:57,515 --> 01:13:59,561
Now, tell me
all about it.

1756
01:13:59,645 --> 01:14:02,944
You arrive at reno, "let no
man put asunder," and then-

1757
01:14:03,028 --> 01:14:04,197
then what'd you do?

1758
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,200
We played roulette.

1759
01:14:05,284 --> 01:14:06,202
You did?

1760
01:14:06,286 --> 01:14:07,413
And then
he bought me a hat.

1761
01:14:07,498 --> 01:14:08,458
That's better.

1762
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:10,922
Isn't it silly?
I love it.

1763
01:14:11,006 --> 01:14:12,634
And then
we had a steak.

1764
01:14:12,677 --> 01:14:13,804
Steak's a steak
anytime, isn't it?

1765
01:14:13,846 --> 01:14:14,764
Hey, where's
the towels?

1766
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:15,767
Behind the door.

1767
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:16,519
Behind the what?

1768
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:17,646
Behind the door.

1769
01:14:17,689 --> 01:14:19,276
Huh! Funny place
to keep 'em!

1770
01:14:19,318 --> 01:14:20,905
Squawking already!

1771
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,993
Hey, i got to get myself under a roof!

1772
01:14:23,077 --> 01:14:25,165
I'll get a room as close by as i can.

1773
01:14:25,249 --> 01:14:26,669
Well, wait
a minute, helen!

1774
01:14:26,752 --> 01:14:28,297
I mean,
let me see, i...

1775
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,344
whoa, whoa!

1776
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:32,683
Funny, i never
gave it a thought,

1777
01:14:32,767 --> 01:14:33,602
i mean,
about living.

1778
01:14:33,644 --> 01:14:35,022
We hadn't
even mentioned it.

1779
01:14:35,106 --> 01:14:36,902
Let's take a short pause before
the party. What do you think?

1780
01:14:36,944 --> 01:14:38,531
Think you'll live here, or
get a little house someplace?

1781
01:14:38,614 --> 01:14:40,034
I don't know. Where are
we going to live, harry?

1782
01:14:40,118 --> 01:14:40,786
Never gave it
a thought.

1783
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,123
Well, now,
look, you two.

1784
01:14:42,207 --> 01:14:43,501
You don't have to decide
today. Here's your apartment.

1785
01:14:43,585 --> 01:14:44,587
You can't beat it
for two anyplace.

1786
01:14:44,671 --> 01:14:45,840
But speaking
for myself,

1787
01:14:45,924 --> 01:14:47,218
i'd think you'd like a
little house with a garden.

1788
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,554
Anyway, i get myself
a room-

1789
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:50,225
oh, helen, i'd hate to turn you out.

1790
01:14:50,268 --> 01:14:51,228
Oh, don't be silly.

1791
01:14:51,312 --> 01:14:52,857
A roof's a roof,
as far as i'm concerned.

1792
01:14:52,899 --> 01:14:54,235
Wait a minute,
helen, hold it.

1793
01:14:54,277 --> 01:14:56,240
This isn't going to make any
difference with you girls.

1794
01:14:56,282 --> 01:14:58,036
I'm shippin' out
in a couple of days.

1795
01:14:58,078 --> 01:14:59,205
Then you two girls
keep on living here,

1796
01:14:59,248 --> 01:15:00,542
just as if nothing
happened at all.

1797
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:02,421
You're shipping out?

1798
01:15:02,506 --> 01:15:03,508
What do you think
i'm doin'?

1799
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:04,635
I'm a sailor,
ain't i?

1800
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:05,930
Yes, of course,
but...

1801
01:15:06,014 --> 01:15:07,851
i guess i thought you'd go
to work here or something.

1802
01:15:07,894 --> 01:15:10,525
Well, i guess i just
thought you'd want to stay.

1803
01:15:10,567 --> 01:15:14,033
Well, i... i guess i
don't know what i thought.

1804
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:17,165
A shore job? Me?
Ha! Emily!

1805
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,630
Oh, no, dear,
of course not!

1806
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,259
It's funny.

1807
01:15:22,178 --> 01:15:25,310
All...
all thinking stops.

1808
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,234
Love's a drug,
isn't it?

1809
01:15:28,318 --> 01:15:29,487
Oh, but, harry,

1810
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:30,489
when you come back, you
want a place of your own

1811
01:15:30,532 --> 01:15:31,492
to come back to,
don't you?

1812
01:15:31,534 --> 01:15:32,787
Well, what's the matter
with this place?

1813
01:15:32,871 --> 01:15:35,084
Well... nothing,
if i'm not here.

1814
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:36,629
How do you
bother me any?

1815
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:38,467
Well, you don't
want me around

1816
01:15:38,509 --> 01:15:39,636
when you
come home, do you?

1817
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,642
Oh, you mean
there's only one room.

1818
01:15:41,725 --> 01:15:44,272
Sure. 'course i can go
sit in a gutter someplace,

1819
01:15:44,357 --> 01:15:45,610
but that isn't what i'm talking about.

1820
01:15:45,651 --> 01:15:47,447
A man doesn't want
another woman around

1821
01:15:47,531 --> 01:15:49,076
if there are
a thousand rooms.

1822
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,287
Well, that's
a bed, ain't it?

1823
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:51,916
That? Hurts you
to sit on it!

1824
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,127
Well, it won't kill you
to sleep on it

1825
01:15:53,211 --> 01:15:54,422
a couple of nights,
will it?

1826
01:15:54,464 --> 01:15:55,967
You want to be with emily
while i'm gone, don't you?

1827
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,806
What's the use of gettin' a
room for a couple of nights?

1828
01:15:57,889 --> 01:15:58,891
But, anyway,
do as you want.

1829
01:15:58,975 --> 01:16:00,395
I ain't gonna
tell you how to sleep.

1830
01:16:00,437 --> 01:16:01,898
But, harry,
that isn't the idea.

1831
01:16:01,983 --> 01:16:03,946
A man wants a home
of his own.

1832
01:16:04,029 --> 01:16:05,449
A man's got a garden, for instance.

1833
01:16:05,533 --> 01:16:06,911
He thinks about it
while he's away,

1834
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,373
wonders
how it's growing.

1835
01:16:08,457 --> 01:16:09,584
Does he?

1836
01:16:09,668 --> 01:16:11,046
Certainly!

1837
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:13,009
Man's got to wonder how
something's growing-

1838
01:16:13,051 --> 01:16:14,429
a garden
or a baby or-

1839
01:16:14,513 --> 01:16:15,974
what baby?

1840
01:16:16,017 --> 01:16:17,019
Huh?

1841
01:16:17,102 --> 01:16:19,649
Oh... you mean
a baby.

1842
01:16:19,692 --> 01:16:22,323
Well, you know, for a minute i thought

1843
01:16:22,365 --> 01:16:24,954
you was talking about
another friend of yours.

1844
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,458
My mistake, my mistake. A baby, huh?

1845
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,003
Do you want
a baby, pal?

1846
01:16:28,046 --> 01:16:29,507
Nope.

1847
01:16:29,591 --> 01:16:31,971
She's on a rampage, and
you're all wound up, boy!

1848
01:16:32,055 --> 01:16:33,600
Helen, why don't
you get married?

1849
01:16:33,642 --> 01:16:34,895
You sound like
you'd like it.

1850
01:16:34,979 --> 01:16:36,983
The other night, you
weren't giving it very much.

1851
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:39,072
Anyway, i never know
when i'll be back.

1852
01:16:39,114 --> 01:16:40,492
I'm liable to be
shipped anywhere.

1853
01:16:40,576 --> 01:16:42,956
I'm liable to not
see you for years.

1854
01:16:45,922 --> 01:16:48,010
Are of you surprised
about anything?

1855
01:16:48,094 --> 01:16:50,516
Room's kind of lost
a lot of it's, uh...

1856
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,273
oh, no, harry, no. Everything's
going to be all right.

1857
01:16:53,357 --> 01:16:54,568
Yeah, yeah,
let's get going again.

1858
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,113
You know, wine goes
great in the morning,

1859
01:16:56,197 --> 01:16:57,742
and the 3 of us
will go out.

1860
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,499
We'll find some of the boys, and we'll
have a party until the ship sails.

1861
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:04,968
That'll take care of the beds.
I'll be right back, ladies.

1862
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:15,911
Gee, it's...
it's 8:30.

1863
01:17:17,874 --> 01:17:19,711
Hey, emily...

1864
01:17:19,754 --> 01:17:20,881
yeah?

1865
01:17:20,923 --> 01:17:24,347
It's, uh... it's none
of my business, but...

1866
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,021
you know sailors are
kind of crazy, and...

1867
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:29,276
i'd nip that bird
right in the bud

1868
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:30,697
and tell him
what's what.

1869
01:17:30,781 --> 01:17:33,997
All that talk i gave him
about the prize he'd won-

1870
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,084
he knows it, does he? Yes, he does.

1871
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:37,881
Him...
if he was mine,

1872
01:17:37,965 --> 01:17:40,805
i'd stick an anchor on him
before 10:00 this morning.

1873
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:42,851
I'm afraid he'd
drag it a little.

1874
01:17:42,935 --> 01:17:46,610
No, helen, just to keep the record
straight, i walked right into this.

1875
01:17:46,694 --> 01:17:48,782
I knew he was a crazy guy.

1876
01:17:48,824 --> 01:17:52,081
I had plenty of time to
think it over, but i didn't.

1877
01:17:52,124 --> 01:17:53,920
I'm not blaming harry
at all.

1878
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,174
I'm buying his wine.

1879
01:17:56,259 --> 01:17:58,639
What are you
gonna do?

1880
01:17:58,723 --> 01:18:00,435
I'll see you later.

1881
01:18:00,477 --> 01:18:02,147
Ok.

1882
01:18:49,847 --> 01:18:52,102
Hi!

1883
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:53,772
Hi.

1884
01:19:02,878 --> 01:19:04,632
I got champagne,

1885
01:19:04,716 --> 01:19:07,472
and i got the best bottle
of brandy in frisco.

1886
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:08,725
Which do you want?

1887
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:10,730
Hey! What do you want?

1888
01:19:12,234 --> 01:19:14,197
I want a divorce.

1889
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:15,909
Huh?

1890
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:20,712
Wait a minute.

1891
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:23,761
Don't let's wait,
harry.

1892
01:19:23,845 --> 01:19:26,434
We don't believe in
waiting, do we, harry?

1893
01:19:26,519 --> 01:19:29,526
Ok... you say you want a
divorce, and i say, "why?"

1894
01:19:29,609 --> 01:19:30,945
Hmm?

1895
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:32,657
And i say,
"look, mister..."

1896
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,997
what is our name?
Patterson?

1897
01:19:35,081 --> 01:19:37,837
Why, i want a divorce,
mr. Patterson,

1898
01:19:37,921 --> 01:19:39,508
because i want a divorce.

1899
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:42,264
I don't want to be
married to you.

1900
01:19:42,307 --> 01:19:45,564
I don't think
you're a good husband.

1901
01:19:45,648 --> 01:19:47,903
Hmm. All that talk
with helen-

1902
01:19:47,987 --> 01:19:49,657
that's the dope,
ain't it?

1903
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,454
All that talk about
little gardens

1904
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,374
or whatever we were
talking about.

1905
01:19:53,459 --> 01:19:56,132
You're wrong. I don't want
little gardens, either.

1906
01:19:56,174 --> 01:19:59,515
I don't want to settle down
- not a nickel's worth.

1907
01:19:59,599 --> 01:20:02,021
You agree with me that
marriage is the bunk, huh?

1908
01:20:02,105 --> 01:20:04,276
There ain't nothing
between a man and a tomato-

1909
01:20:04,318 --> 01:20:07,032
uh, a woman
- but like a time at reno.

1910
01:20:07,117 --> 01:20:09,831
But to settle down?
That ain't it, is it?

1911
01:20:09,915 --> 01:20:11,209
My old friend "it."

1912
01:20:11,252 --> 01:20:13,841
Let's put it
this way, harry:

1913
01:20:13,925 --> 01:20:17,600
I'm no more like helen...
no more like her than...

1914
01:20:17,684 --> 01:20:20,983
than... than the girl
on your arm.

1915
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:24,074
Hey, you ain't jealous of her, are you?

1916
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:25,786
No, dear.

1917
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:27,833
Could be a little,
pal...

1918
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:30,840
especially a girl a guy
carries around with him.

1919
01:20:30,882 --> 01:20:32,845
I wouldn't like
a guy painted on you

1920
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,390
staring at me,
neither.

1921
01:20:34,474 --> 01:20:35,852
Wouldn't you, harry?

1922
01:20:35,936 --> 01:20:37,397
No, i wouldn't.

1923
01:20:37,482 --> 01:20:41,241
Hey, how about this- suppose
i stick you on the other arm?

1924
01:20:41,324 --> 01:20:42,660
No, thank you,
darling.

1925
01:20:42,703 --> 01:20:44,874
Wait a minute. You wouldn't
be ashamed of this girl none?

1926
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:47,338
I don't know what i'm protecting
her about. She don't need it.

1927
01:20:47,381 --> 01:20:48,884
I'm sure she doesn't.

1928
01:20:48,968 --> 01:20:52,935
And, harry, i'm not
a bit interested.

1929
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,775
This girl was good.

1930
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:58,658
She lived on the shores
of normandy before the war.

1931
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:01,079
I looked good to her
because she lived

1932
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:03,126
nowhere near anybody
worth knowing.

1933
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:05,090
I couldn't help
looking good to her.

1934
01:21:05,132 --> 01:21:08,431
Then come a time when i'd
better get out of there, see?

1935
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:11,898
But get this straight- i
missed her more than she did me.

1936
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:15,281
She was one lovely girl.
I'd bet on that.

1937
01:21:15,365 --> 01:21:17,411
What did she say
when you said good-bye?

1938
01:21:17,453 --> 01:21:20,251
I didn't say good-bye.
She was asleep.

1939
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:22,465
Did she see this?

1940
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:24,971
Nope.

1941
01:21:25,055 --> 01:21:26,391
Sorry.

1942
01:21:26,433 --> 01:21:30,526
Well... i like
your french lady.

1943
01:21:30,568 --> 01:21:32,781
And i repeat-
i'm not in love

1944
01:21:32,866 --> 01:21:34,745
with little houses
and little gardens.

1945
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:37,126
Little gardens don't mean
one thing or another.

1946
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:40,132
I don't mean that i'm
afraid of the sea, either.

1947
01:21:40,175 --> 01:21:42,889
We could have all
the 7 seas between us.

1948
01:21:42,973 --> 01:21:45,019
It could still
be perfect.

1949
01:21:45,062 --> 01:21:46,983
What i'm trying
to say is...

1950
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:49,322
we didn't bring reno
back with us.

1951
01:21:49,364 --> 01:21:50,658
Reno's still in reno,

1952
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,913
and reno should grow
in a garden.

1953
01:21:52,998 --> 01:21:54,501
Get me?

1954
01:21:55,796 --> 01:21:57,759
Sure, i get you.

1955
01:21:57,801 --> 01:21:59,095
And, say...
i wouldn't wonder

1956
01:21:59,137 --> 01:22:01,977
if you and me are a lot
alike, do you know it?

1957
01:22:02,019 --> 01:22:03,898
And how about this-
you get a divorce,

1958
01:22:03,982 --> 01:22:05,318
and then
when i land again,

1959
01:22:05,403 --> 01:22:07,658
if you feel better about
it, we'll get married again.

1960
01:22:07,742 --> 01:22:09,830
Right to left,
left to right...

1961
01:22:09,913 --> 01:22:11,792
ok, pal, ok.

1962
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:13,338
What's the matter?

1963
01:22:13,422 --> 01:22:16,262
We're divorced, dear.

1964
01:22:16,346 --> 01:22:18,852
Oh...
but not officially.

1965
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:21,984
We weren't married
officially, either.

1966
01:22:22,068 --> 01:22:24,991
Ok, pal, ok. Now how
about finding the boys?

1967
01:22:25,075 --> 01:22:26,202
No, thanks.

1968
01:22:26,245 --> 01:22:27,498
Party's over, huh?

1969
01:22:27,581 --> 01:22:29,042
It was a nice one.

1970
01:22:29,085 --> 01:22:30,045
Mm-mmm.

1971
01:22:30,087 --> 01:22:31,757
Well, she does move, don't she?

1972
01:22:31,841 --> 01:22:34,890
I told you on the stairs,
it can happen fast.

1973
01:22:34,974 --> 01:22:37,020
Ok, darling, ok. And
if you change your mind,

1974
01:22:37,062 --> 01:22:38,858
i'll be hanging around
the same joint, probably,

1975
01:22:38,942 --> 01:22:40,529
and i hope
you change it, pal.

1976
01:22:40,613 --> 01:22:42,033
Thanks, harry.

1977
01:22:42,116 --> 01:22:44,037
If i do, i'll
look you up, pal.

1978
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:45,499
Ok, pal. So long.

1979
01:22:45,583 --> 01:22:46,668
So long.

1980
01:22:46,752 --> 01:22:48,840
Do i get a kiss?

1981
01:22:48,883 --> 01:22:51,263
Sure.

1982
01:23:00,578 --> 01:23:02,457
Ok.

1983
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,590
So long.
So long.

1984
01:23:07,636 --> 01:23:10,434
You're a good girl.

1985
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:32,612
Hi, gus!
- Hey, harry!

1986
01:23:32,697 --> 01:23:33,615
What ship
we working?

1987
01:23:33,699 --> 01:23:35,202
It's a lucky thing
you showed up!

1988
01:23:35,245 --> 01:23:36,581
They got mudgin on
the carpet in there.

1989
01:23:36,665 --> 01:23:38,126
What for?

1990
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:39,630
He won't sail
without his soul.

1991
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:42,679
Yeah, and they're gonna
take his book away.

1992
01:23:42,721 --> 01:23:44,767
Yeah?

1993
01:23:44,851 --> 01:23:46,396
And another thing...
show me the law

1994
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,276
of the maritime union
or the shipping commission

1995
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,367
that says you can take a man's
book away for losing his soul.

1996
01:23:51,451 --> 01:23:53,038
What soul? My weepin', immortal soul

1997
01:23:53,121 --> 01:23:55,501
that i have to have to
go to heaven if i die.

1998
01:23:55,585 --> 01:23:57,046
We've argued
long enough.

1999
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:59,177
Now, ship on the pacific
belle, or lose your book.

2000
01:23:59,261 --> 01:24:02,268
You ain't got a right to pass
judgment on a thing like this.

2001
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:03,604
Oh, i ain't, huh?

2002
01:24:03,647 --> 01:24:05,443
No, you ain't, mister.
You ain't big enough.

2003
01:24:05,484 --> 01:24:06,987
The maritime union
ain't big enough.

2004
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:08,575
That's all, brother.
You're beached for good!

2005
01:24:08,659 --> 01:24:10,663
Oh, no, you can't!
Hold it, mudge.

2006
01:24:10,747 --> 01:24:12,167
Harry!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2007
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:13,754
Paul revere patterson.
Hiya, pals.

2008
01:24:13,796 --> 01:24:16,302
Ok, but this little
character-where have you been?

2009
01:24:16,344 --> 01:24:17,805
On a mission of mercy
in reno.

2010
01:24:17,889 --> 01:24:20,102
Look, patterson, we've listed
your crew for this trip.

2011
01:24:20,145 --> 01:24:22,108
They've all checked in
ok but this screwball.

2012
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:23,611
He'll check in.
When's she sail?

2013
01:24:23,695 --> 01:24:24,780
Be aboard
friday morning.

2014
01:24:24,865 --> 01:24:27,454
What are we arguing about?
If we sail, we sail.

2015
01:24:27,538 --> 01:24:29,918
I'll guarantee mudge.
Give him back his book.

2016
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,087
Ok,
there you are.

2017
01:24:31,171 --> 01:24:32,883
Much thanks, steve.
Come on, mudge.

2018
01:24:32,926 --> 01:24:34,930
I don't know, harry.
A man in my condition-

2019
01:24:35,014 --> 01:24:37,895
take it easy. I'll give you a
certificate of loss for the thing.

2020
01:24:37,938 --> 01:24:40,151
Worse guys than you have
skimmed past the pearly gates.

2021
01:24:40,235 --> 01:24:41,696
Did you get him
off, harry?

2022
01:24:41,739 --> 01:24:43,200
Sure, sure.

2023
01:24:43,284 --> 01:24:45,622
Where you really been, harry?
I couldn't find you noplace.

2024
01:24:45,707 --> 01:24:47,962
I was married
- married and divorced. Reno, reno.

2025
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:49,340
Who was she,
harry?

2026
01:24:49,382 --> 01:24:51,219
A friend of mudgin-
psychoneurosis.

2027
01:24:51,262 --> 01:24:52,264
Miss emily?

2028
01:24:52,348 --> 01:24:54,895
Yeah. Yeah, emily.
I'll see you guys later.

2029
01:24:54,979 --> 01:24:59,281
You did that
to miss emily?

2030
01:24:59,365 --> 01:25:01,829
Patterson...
married?

2031
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:05,838
Let's have a drink,
mudge, on me.

2032
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:10,014
A drink? No, not now.
I got an errand to do.

2033
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,560
Whew...

2034
01:25:28,602 --> 01:25:29,938
did i stop one!

2035
01:25:30,022 --> 01:25:32,193
'Twas a dirty fight?

2036
01:25:32,278 --> 01:25:34,951
No, it was strict
merchant marine rules.

2037
01:25:35,034 --> 01:25:37,164
I'm always
underestimating him.

2038
01:25:37,248 --> 01:25:39,921
Don't you really mean
that you overestimated me?

2039
01:25:40,005 --> 01:25:41,592
Oh, no, miss emily.
I bet you done better

2040
01:25:41,675 --> 01:25:43,387
than anybody else
could've done.

2041
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:44,765
I claim a draw.

2042
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:47,481
You know, they say a
girl can't ever win.

2043
01:25:47,564 --> 01:25:49,861
All she can do is
hold down the score.

2044
01:25:49,945 --> 01:25:52,033
I got to take
the blame for this.

2045
01:25:52,117 --> 01:25:55,876
Oh, no. We were both
overconfident...

2046
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:59,635
but you can quote me-
a very charming man.

2047
01:25:59,677 --> 01:26:01,013
Oh, the tricky,
twisty ways of him.

2048
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:02,391
When i brung him
into the library,

2049
01:26:02,475 --> 01:26:04,855
i knowed from the very first
it was you he'd be after.

2050
01:26:04,898 --> 01:26:06,109
So did i.

2051
01:26:06,151 --> 01:26:09,993
But the charm of the
scamp-you didn't know that.

2052
01:26:10,035 --> 01:26:11,246
Oh, yes.

2053
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,961
Not like me, who's followed
him these many years.

2054
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:15,381
I've cursed him
for picking fights,

2055
01:26:15,465 --> 01:26:17,469
then gone after him into
the brawl he started.

2056
01:26:17,554 --> 01:26:19,642
I've even defended
him to women

2057
01:26:19,726 --> 01:26:21,689
using my native
eloquence.

2058
01:26:21,772 --> 01:26:23,317
What did you tell him?

2059
01:26:23,401 --> 01:26:24,904
He'll miss you,
i say.

2060
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:27,911
He'll grieve for you and
come back a better man.

2061
01:26:27,954 --> 01:26:30,835
Be patient, be true,
and wait for him to grow

2062
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:33,675
the thorny rose you
planted in his heart.

2063
01:26:33,759 --> 01:26:35,346
That was lovely,
mr. Mudgin.

2064
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:36,891
It was a lie.

2065
01:26:36,934 --> 01:26:39,398
But i'll not lie
to you, miss emily.

2066
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,778
It's good riddance
you broke with him.

2067
01:26:41,862 --> 01:26:43,908
That was brave.
That was strong.

2068
01:26:43,992 --> 01:26:47,709
I told you i got at
least a draw, didn't i?

2069
01:26:47,752 --> 01:26:50,174
You ain't bruised
too bad?

2070
01:26:50,216 --> 01:26:52,095
No.

2071
01:26:52,179 --> 01:26:55,228
You see, i'm a pretty
tough mug myself.

2072
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:58,444
Sure, now, you are.
You are.

2073
01:26:58,528 --> 01:27:01,702
But me... i'm sailing
with him.

2074
01:27:01,785 --> 01:27:04,458
Bullied me into it,
he did! Sheer bullying!

2075
01:27:04,542 --> 01:27:06,254
You deserve a bow.

2076
01:27:06,338 --> 01:27:08,593
A bow? For saving
that black ocean,

2077
01:27:08,677 --> 01:27:10,347
and me
without a soul?

2078
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:13,480
Both of us are
lost-castaways.

2079
01:27:13,564 --> 01:27:15,067
He needs you,
mr. Mudge.

2080
01:27:15,151 --> 01:27:16,905
Keep this under
your hat, pal,

2081
01:27:16,989 --> 01:27:19,996
but he isn't nearly the
champion he thinks he is.

2082
01:27:20,038 --> 01:27:21,875
Harry patterson?

2083
01:27:21,959 --> 01:27:25,300
I can say no more.
It's a trade secret...

2084
01:27:25,384 --> 01:27:29,560
but put the laurel wreath on
his brow and let him swagger.

2085
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:33,236
The guy still rates a
cheer, and you can quote me.

2086
01:27:33,278 --> 01:27:34,948
Queen deirdre
herself.

2087
01:27:34,991 --> 01:27:37,037
Shake.

2088
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,420
Good-bye, mr. Mudge.

2089
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,497
Hi.

2090
01:28:13,793 --> 01:28:16,299
Helen! What are you
doing home?

2091
01:28:16,341 --> 01:28:20,434
I'm trying to think of something
to tell you that i forgot.

2092
01:28:20,476 --> 01:28:23,650
I give up... so
i'll tell the truth.

2093
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:27,367
I left a lot
of worry here.

2094
01:28:27,451 --> 01:28:30,040
Oh, dear helen.

2095
01:28:30,124 --> 01:28:32,087
Hey, you sound fine.

2096
01:28:32,129 --> 01:28:37,684
Em, are you packing to go away
with him his last few days?

2097
01:28:37,767 --> 01:28:41,191
No. We parted...
gay as two larks.

2098
01:28:41,276 --> 01:28:43,865
If you're sorry for me,
you'll be sorry...

2099
01:28:43,949 --> 01:28:46,872
but you can have the harbor
till he's gone.

2100
01:28:46,915 --> 01:28:48,669
I'll be back
in two days...

2101
01:28:48,752 --> 01:28:51,968
tell you about a daydream
i had in the library.

2102
01:28:56,605 --> 01:28:58,317
Thank you.

2103
01:29:25,257 --> 01:29:26,175
Hi, em!

2104
01:29:26,218 --> 01:29:27,805
Come down here.

2105
01:29:27,847 --> 01:29:28,807
What's the matter?

2106
01:29:28,849 --> 01:29:30,477
What are you painting my house for?

2107
01:29:30,562 --> 01:29:31,647
Ha! It needs it,
don't it?

2108
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:33,359
What are you
painting it for?

2109
01:29:33,444 --> 01:29:35,323
Just a going-away
present, that's all.

2110
01:29:35,407 --> 01:29:36,785
I guess i thought
it would please you.

2111
01:29:36,869 --> 01:29:39,124
Thought you'd leave a
little money in my shoes.

2112
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:40,962
Now, look.

2113
01:29:41,004 --> 01:29:44,011
That's the last way
to look at it, emily.

2114
01:29:44,094 --> 01:29:46,600
I see how it would make
you sore, naturally,

2115
01:29:46,684 --> 01:29:48,480
but it ain't
like that.

2116
01:29:48,564 --> 01:29:50,276
When i said a present,
i meant like a present

2117
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:51,779
to reno
from both of us.

2118
01:29:51,863 --> 01:29:54,076
Usually you paint the
town good the last day,

2119
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:55,455
in my trade.

2120
01:29:55,539 --> 01:29:57,251
But i thought, just
to show you that reno

2121
01:29:57,335 --> 01:29:59,005
was the best time
i ever had ashore,

2122
01:29:59,089 --> 01:30:00,550
i'd paint your house
instead.

2123
01:30:00,634 --> 01:30:02,054
Well...

2124
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:05,562
that's very nice of
you, harry, of course.

2125
01:30:05,605 --> 01:30:07,568
Now we can say
good-bye again.

2126
01:30:07,651 --> 01:30:09,781
As you said, we're always
saying good-bye.

2127
01:30:09,865 --> 01:30:12,746
You don't want me
to finish it?

2128
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,629
No, harry, thanks.

2129
01:30:15,712 --> 01:30:17,591
Why?

2130
01:30:17,676 --> 01:30:19,680
Because...

2131
01:30:20,683 --> 01:30:22,270
because i say so!

2132
01:30:22,354 --> 01:30:24,024
Ok.

2133
01:30:24,108 --> 01:30:25,778
Ok!

2134
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:28,576
Oh, fine, you decided
to paint the house.

2135
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,706
It looks great. I take
it you're miss sears.

2136
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:31,668
I'm mr. Littleton.

2137
01:30:31,751 --> 01:30:32,836
I wish
i'd known-

2138
01:30:32,921 --> 01:30:34,048
i should give up
my last day,

2139
01:30:34,132 --> 01:30:35,050
and you
don't want it.

2140
01:30:35,134 --> 01:30:36,219
But, painter,
what's the trouble?

2141
01:30:36,304 --> 01:30:37,473
Now, this can all
be settled.

2142
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:38,809
What a sucker
i was!

2143
01:30:38,852 --> 01:30:41,149
Get out here, will you?
Get out of here!

2144
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:42,527
What's the matter,
miss sears?

2145
01:30:42,611 --> 01:30:43,780
Looks to me like
he's doing a fine job.

2146
01:30:43,864 --> 01:30:44,949
Get out?
Listen, i'm out!

2147
01:30:44,992 --> 01:30:45,952
I never was such
a sucker.

2148
01:30:46,036 --> 01:30:47,038
I should give up
my last day

2149
01:30:47,122 --> 01:30:48,291
to paint this
rusty dump!

2150
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:50,087
We can't get anywhere
this way, painter.

2151
01:30:50,129 --> 01:30:53,804
Get out of here!
Go on, get out of here!

2152
01:30:55,099 --> 01:30:57,479
I'll get out when
i'm good and ready!

2153
01:30:57,564 --> 01:31:00,404
Yeah, yeah, you got
that library look.

2154
01:31:00,446 --> 01:31:01,949
You're screwy.

2155
01:31:02,033 --> 01:31:03,286
Oh!

2156
01:31:06,084 --> 01:31:07,880
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

2157
01:31:07,922 --> 01:31:10,678
Miss sears, you can't treat
painters like that these days.

2158
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,638
They're independent.

2159
01:31:11,723 --> 01:31:12,892
Whoa,
they're independent.

2160
01:31:12,976 --> 01:31:14,646
So long,
screwball!

2161
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:25,547
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2162
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:38,036
All right, all right,
get that spring line in.

2163
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,289
Shore leave's over.

2164
01:31:39,331 --> 01:31:41,419
Come on, shake a leg!

2165
01:31:41,461 --> 01:31:42,421
Ok, harry.

2166
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,925
All clear aft?

2167
01:31:43,967 --> 01:31:45,303
All clear aft,
captain.

2168
01:31:48,228 --> 01:31:50,191
All clear forward,
bosun?

2169
01:31:50,274 --> 01:31:52,487
All clear forward,
captain!

2170
01:31:52,572 --> 01:31:54,451
All right,
take it away!

2171
01:31:54,535 --> 01:31:56,247
Let's get out of here!

2172
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:05,936
Hey!

2173
01:32:07,399 --> 01:32:09,529
Hi!

2174
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:11,492
Hey, fellas,
look who's here!

2175
01:32:11,576 --> 01:32:12,829
Hiya,
slugger!

2176
01:32:12,912 --> 01:32:15,125
Hiya, dempsey!

2177
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:16,212
Hiya, fellas!

2178
01:32:16,296 --> 01:32:17,549
Hi!
Hi!

2179
01:32:18,802 --> 01:32:19,846
Don't hit the ship!

2180
01:32:19,888 --> 01:32:20,848
Where is he?

2181
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:22,059
Hey, harry!

2182
01:32:22,143 --> 01:32:24,314
Here's your...

2183
01:32:24,357 --> 01:32:26,194
hiya, pal!

2184
01:32:29,703 --> 01:32:30,621
Hey, emily!

2185
01:32:30,664 --> 01:32:32,376
Hiya, rocks!

2186
01:32:33,629 --> 01:32:35,466
Do you know why
i was mad?

2187
01:32:35,509 --> 01:32:36,678
No!

2188
01:32:36,762 --> 01:32:38,140
L-

2189
01:32:38,182 --> 01:32:40,479
i didn't want
anything changed!

2190
01:32:40,563 --> 01:32:42,317
What?

2191
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:43,946
I liked it as it was!

2192
01:32:43,987 --> 01:32:44,905
What?

2193
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:45,950
Ahh!

2194
01:32:45,992 --> 01:32:48,790
I liked it as it was!

2195
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:51,213
Oh. How was it?

2196
01:32:51,297 --> 01:32:53,928
Wasn't painted sunday,
was it?

2197
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:56,141
Oh! Hey,
don't get sweet!

2198
01:32:56,225 --> 01:32:57,603
This ain't no time
to get sweet!

2199
01:32:57,645 --> 01:32:58,772
Throw a rock!

2200
01:32:58,815 --> 01:33:00,569
Ok!

2201
01:33:01,906 --> 01:33:03,409
Hey!

2202
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,168
I'll buy you a drink!

2203
01:33:07,252 --> 01:33:09,758
Ha ha! What'll
you have, pal?

2204
01:33:09,842 --> 01:33:12,598
Ice water!
Bellboy's knocking!

2205
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:15,521
Who bought me this?

2206
01:33:15,564 --> 01:33:16,900
Me!

2207
01:33:16,984 --> 01:33:18,529
Where?

2208
01:33:18,571 --> 01:33:22,664
Reno!

2209
01:33:26,925 --> 01:33:29,305
Awwwww...

2210
01:34:01,926 --> 01:34:04,014
hey, mudge!

2211
01:34:04,098 --> 01:34:06,562
Don't your soul rate
waving good-bye, too?

2212
01:34:06,604 --> 01:34:09,110
You mean grinnin' like
the way you said it?

2213
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:13,746
Sure. A guy's soul,
his dame, powell street,

2214
01:34:13,788 --> 01:34:14,790
tip your hat to him.

2215
01:34:14,874 --> 01:34:16,085
Ahh, i couldn't.

2216
01:34:16,169 --> 01:34:17,589
That's too final.

2217
01:34:17,672 --> 01:34:18,799
Aw, snap out, pal.

2218
01:34:18,883 --> 01:34:20,887
Nothing is ever final
as long as you're living.

2219
01:34:20,972 --> 01:34:22,976
Well, miss emily
was final.

2220
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:24,396
Emily?
Yeah.

2221
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,067
I saw her say
good-bye.

2222
01:34:26,151 --> 01:34:28,072
Ho ho, she's always
saying good-bye to me.

2223
01:34:28,156 --> 01:34:29,200
She's crazy.

2224
01:34:29,284 --> 01:34:30,286
Did you see her
throw her hat?

2225
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:31,330
Indeed i saw it.

2226
01:34:31,372 --> 01:34:32,416
You saw nothin'.

2227
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,045
You should have seen her
throwing rocks.

2228
01:34:34,087 --> 01:34:35,047
Some screwball.

2229
01:34:35,089 --> 01:34:36,258
My frisco screwball.

2230
01:34:36,342 --> 01:34:38,305
Screwball, eh? Ha!

2231
01:34:38,347 --> 01:34:40,685
She's gonna be waitin'
for you when you get back,

2232
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:41,688
ain't she?

2233
01:34:41,772 --> 01:34:42,983
Sure.

2234
01:34:43,025 --> 01:34:44,278
Wouldn't surprise me if
she met the ship swimming.

2235
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,826
No, no, mr. Bosun,
you never left her.

2236
01:34:46,868 --> 01:34:48,998
She left you,
god bless her.

2237
01:34:49,081 --> 01:34:51,294
But you're never gonna be
rid of her, not miss emily.

2238
01:34:51,337 --> 01:34:53,383
With her laughter and
her sweet craziness.

2239
01:34:53,467 --> 01:34:55,555
She'll tear
your heart out.

2240
01:34:55,639 --> 01:34:57,810
You stumbled onto
a queen,

2241
01:34:57,894 --> 01:35:00,065
and queens get into
men's blood,

2242
01:35:00,108 --> 01:35:02,948
and dirty tramps from
the sea can't take it!

2243
01:35:04,118 --> 01:35:05,663
Mudge.

2244
01:35:05,747 --> 01:35:07,167
This is me you're
talking to-harry.

2245
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,213
Yeah, i know
it's you, harry.

2246
01:35:09,255 --> 01:35:10,299
Yeah?

2247
01:35:10,383 --> 01:35:12,930
I guess it was something
i was saving up.

2248
01:35:13,014 --> 01:35:14,183
Now it's said.

2249
01:35:14,267 --> 01:35:15,185
Don't want to
take it back?

2250
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:16,481
Not one word.

2251
01:35:18,904 --> 01:35:19,989
Take it back.

2252
01:35:20,073 --> 01:35:21,618
You ain't talking to
your friend,

2253
01:35:21,702 --> 01:35:22,829
you're talking to
your bosun.

2254
01:35:22,913 --> 01:35:24,834
Oh, my bosun, is it?

2255
01:35:24,876 --> 01:35:28,551
Well, bein' a sailor and
with respect to discipline

2256
01:35:28,594 --> 01:35:31,350
to bosun patterson,
i take it back.

2257
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:35,025
To my friend
that was,

2258
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:36,863
never will i.

2259
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:44,673
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2260
01:35:59,585 --> 01:36:02,007
It was all my idea, coming to reno.

2261
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:03,636
Emily was here on her honeymoon,

2262
01:36:03,678 --> 01:36:05,098
and i said the way to get cured quick

2263
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:07,103
is take a hair of the dog that bit you.

2264
01:36:07,145 --> 01:36:09,275
You mean a tack from
the heel that kicked you.

2265
01:36:09,317 --> 01:36:11,405
My last one was
just plain rat.

2266
01:36:11,447 --> 01:36:13,159
How about yours,
emily?

2267
01:36:13,243 --> 01:36:14,621
Mine was a sailor.

2268
01:36:14,663 --> 01:36:16,500
Oh. Annapolis man?

2269
01:36:16,585 --> 01:36:17,503
No.

2270
01:36:17,587 --> 01:36:19,466
What was his rank, darling?

2271
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:20,677
He's a bosun.

2272
01:36:20,761 --> 01:36:22,682
Greatest bosun
of them all.

2273
01:36:22,766 --> 01:36:24,144
And the biggest
heel.

2274
01:36:24,228 --> 01:36:26,316
But what's
a bosun, emily?

2275
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,569
I think it's
the next rank

2276
01:36:27,653 --> 01:36:28,906
above admiral
of the fleet.

2277
01:36:28,948 --> 01:36:31,495
He was just
a tough mug sailor.

2278
01:36:31,579 --> 01:36:32,706
He sounds
romantic.

2279
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:35,128
Don't believe i ever knew a sailor.

2280
01:36:35,213 --> 01:36:38,136
Oh, you missed a lot.

2281
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:40,558
She was a perfectly
happy librarian until he-

2282
01:36:40,643 --> 01:36:43,817
oh, no, helen, no.
I worked in a morgue.

2283
01:36:43,859 --> 01:36:45,529
You should have seen
the dead rise up

2284
01:36:45,571 --> 01:36:47,199
when that sailor
came in.

2285
01:36:47,242 --> 01:36:49,956
Even gabriel's horn
couldn't pipe him down.

2286
01:36:49,999 --> 01:36:52,546
He treated you like a
tomato on a big shore leave.

2287
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:54,175
What a shore leave.

2288
01:36:54,259 --> 01:36:57,099
And then he
ran off to sea!

2289
01:36:57,183 --> 01:36:59,689
I would have had
an adorable husband.

2290
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:00,899
Adorable?

2291
01:37:00,984 --> 01:37:02,905
For 3 days
every 6 months.

2292
01:37:02,988 --> 01:37:04,658
Or one day
every 10 years.

2293
01:37:05,494 --> 01:37:06,914
Mm-hmm.

2294
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:12,511
Emily! Emily!

2295
01:37:12,595 --> 01:37:14,056
Hey, joe!

2296
01:37:14,099 --> 01:37:16,437
She isn't used
to drinking.

2297
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:18,275
Better get a doctor,
helen.

2298
01:37:20,405 --> 01:37:21,616
Is she
all right?

2299
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:22,911
Was it just
the brandy?

2300
01:37:22,995 --> 01:37:25,626
Oh, no, no, no. But
nothing to be alarmed about.

2301
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:27,840
Quite a common ailment
among brides.

2302
01:37:27,924 --> 01:37:29,009
Huh?

2303
01:37:32,309 --> 01:37:33,269
Emily-

2304
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:35,650
oh, you poor kid,
emily!

2305
01:37:35,734 --> 01:37:37,989
They say a woman
can't keep a secret.

2306
01:37:38,073 --> 01:37:39,117
You should have
told me.

2307
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:40,328
Oh, no, no.

2308
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:41,706
You're not going
through with the divorce.

2309
01:37:41,749 --> 01:37:43,628
Certainly i am.

2310
01:37:43,712 --> 01:37:46,009
Well, you better
write him and-

2311
01:37:46,051 --> 01:37:47,930
no, no, never.

2312
01:37:48,014 --> 01:37:50,185
And i want you to promise
that you won't write to him.

2313
01:37:50,269 --> 01:37:51,187
Ohhh...

2314
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:53,986
having babies is
no fun, you know.

2315
01:37:54,028 --> 01:37:55,239
The least
he could do is-

2316
01:37:55,323 --> 01:37:57,703
no, he couldn't.
Not for me.

2317
01:37:57,787 --> 01:37:59,708
I'm not going
to ask him.

2318
01:37:59,792 --> 01:38:01,212
Oh, emily!

2319
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:05,264
Hey, hey, don't let it get you down.

2320
01:38:05,306 --> 01:38:07,979
What are we gonna do?

2321
01:38:08,062 --> 01:38:10,985
Right now you're going to
wash the tears off your face.

2322
01:38:11,028 --> 01:38:13,492
We're going to
the dance tonight.

2323
01:38:13,576 --> 01:38:15,789
* once there was a waitress *

2324
01:38:15,831 --> 01:38:18,712
* in the bridge door hotel *

2325
01:38:18,797 --> 01:38:21,428
* her master was a fine one *

2326
01:38:21,511 --> 01:38:24,810
* and her mistress was a-swell *

2327
01:38:24,895 --> 01:38:28,695
* along came a sailor lad *

2328
01:38:28,779 --> 01:38:31,410
* fresh from the sea *

2329
01:38:31,494 --> 01:38:34,501
* and that was the beginning *

2330
01:38:34,585 --> 01:38:36,130
* of all that misery *

2331
01:38:36,214 --> 01:38:37,968
when did he speak
to you guys last?

2332
01:38:38,051 --> 01:38:41,100
Outside of given orders, not since
we left sydney, more than a month.

2333
01:38:41,184 --> 01:38:42,311
I ain't had
a look out of him

2334
01:38:42,395 --> 01:38:43,898
since frisco, 6 months.

2335
01:38:43,941 --> 01:38:45,737
6 months and 11 days.

2336
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:46,864
If you ask me,

2337
01:38:46,906 --> 01:38:48,702
it's all hooked up with that goofy fight

2338
01:38:48,744 --> 01:38:50,957
he and mudge had when we left frisco.

2339
01:38:51,041 --> 01:38:52,335
Mudgin gives me
the creeps, too.

2340
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:53,547
All over the ship

2341
01:38:53,631 --> 01:38:54,758
and in
every blinkin' port

2342
01:38:54,842 --> 01:38:56,178
like a daft
bird dog after

2343
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:57,890
a grouse that flew away.

2344
01:38:57,975 --> 01:39:01,107
Still lookin' for that
cockeyed soul of his.

2345
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:03,571
*... as far as you can see *

2346
01:39:03,655 --> 01:39:06,620
* for i trusted one once *

2347
01:39:06,662 --> 01:39:10,588
* and he put out to sea *

2348
01:39:10,672 --> 01:39:11,925
* and that is- *

2349
01:39:11,967 --> 01:39:12,927
stop that yowling!

2350
01:39:12,969 --> 01:39:14,389
Where's mudgin?

2351
01:39:14,473 --> 01:39:15,642
He's up in
the...

2352
01:39:15,684 --> 01:39:16,811
oh.

2353
01:39:16,895 --> 01:39:18,315
Yeah, "oh."

2354
01:39:30,261 --> 01:39:35,147
Hello, bosun harry,
old pal... sir.

2355
01:39:35,231 --> 01:39:36,901
What are you doing
off-duty?

2356
01:39:36,944 --> 01:39:38,572
Miss emily,
harry.

2357
01:39:38,656 --> 01:39:41,329
I saw her-saw her
from the lookout.

2358
01:39:41,413 --> 01:39:44,712
She was standin' right
here by number one lifeboat.

2359
01:39:44,796 --> 01:39:48,095
She didn't look scared
or sorrowful or nothin'.

2360
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:50,058
Brave and beautiful
she was.

2361
01:39:50,142 --> 01:39:54,444
Gay-like, she smiled and
throwed her shoes in the ocean.

2362
01:39:58,371 --> 01:40:01,044
You're drunk.
You're blind drunk.

2363
01:40:01,127 --> 01:40:03,507
No, no, harry.
Sober i saw her, too.

2364
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:05,346
The fifth night
out of frisco.

2365
01:40:05,388 --> 01:40:07,643
Yeah. Yeah, that's right, mudgin.

2366
01:40:07,685 --> 01:40:08,979
You're always
seeing things.

2367
01:40:09,021 --> 01:40:11,067
If it ain't your soul popping out of you

2368
01:40:11,151 --> 01:40:12,195
and running up
powell street,

2369
01:40:12,279 --> 01:40:13,156
it's a tomato.

2370
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:17,583
Yeah, that's right,
mr. Bosun, sir.

2371
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:19,546
I can see things.

2372
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:21,885
I can hear things, too.

2373
01:40:21,969 --> 01:40:24,683
Sir.

2374
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:30,364
Here. Come on,
this way.

2375
01:40:30,448 --> 01:40:31,408
Yes, sir,

2376
01:40:31,451 --> 01:40:33,622
bosun old pal, sir.

2377
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:35,418
Right back up there
on watch.

2378
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:37,590
Come on.

2379
01:40:38,676 --> 01:40:41,432
Get up there, and
make it fast, pal.

2380
01:40:41,516 --> 01:40:43,061
Hold on now,
harry.

2381
01:40:43,104 --> 01:40:44,064
Start climbing.

2382
01:40:44,106 --> 01:40:45,818
Climbin' it is,
i'll scoot up

2383
01:40:45,902 --> 01:40:48,073
that witchbroom handle...

2384
01:40:49,076 --> 01:40:50,872
it's been a screwy
deal, harry,

2385
01:40:50,956 --> 01:40:52,877
but you don't
want this.

2386
01:40:52,961 --> 01:40:55,592
We've hoisted too many
together for this.

2387
01:40:55,676 --> 01:40:57,054
He's stiff, harry.

2388
01:40:57,096 --> 01:40:59,267
I ain't hoisted one
with you for a long time.

2389
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:05,282
Harry, that's the first
time you ever hit a man

2390
01:41:05,366 --> 01:41:06,744
with his hands down.

2391
01:41:06,828 --> 01:41:10,211
You've been hit harder
than even i thought.

2392
01:41:10,294 --> 01:41:12,883
You're massacred.

2393
01:41:21,488 --> 01:41:23,534
Stand by for
that freight's spring line!

2394
01:41:25,957 --> 01:41:28,295
Let go of
your spring.

2395
01:41:29,842 --> 01:41:31,512
Cast her in.

2396
01:41:35,438 --> 01:41:38,445
Come on, get that
gangplank up here.

2397
01:41:39,699 --> 01:41:41,286
Hiya, chili!

2398
01:41:47,259 --> 01:41:48,553
Harry!

2399
01:41:57,241 --> 01:41:59,037
Oh, harry,
harry.

2400
01:41:59,121 --> 01:42:00,666
I've been counting
the time, too, pal.

2401
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:01,668
Every second.

2402
01:42:01,710 --> 01:42:03,004
Did you count every second, harry?

2403
01:42:03,047 --> 01:42:04,550
I might have missed a
moment, baby, here and there.

2404
01:42:04,634 --> 01:42:06,012
Don't tell me
about them.

2405
01:42:06,054 --> 01:42:07,265
Still love me
best?

2406
01:42:07,349 --> 01:42:08,936
I mean, minnie the best and me second?

2407
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:10,189
Look, see them
footprints of yours?

2408
01:42:10,231 --> 01:42:11,400
Say good-bye to them.

2409
01:42:11,484 --> 01:42:13,363
I'll be right back in
them when you leave, harry.

2410
01:42:13,405 --> 01:42:14,407
You're crazy
with the heat.

2411
01:42:14,491 --> 01:42:15,952
I've quit the ship.
I'm washed.

2412
01:42:15,995 --> 01:42:17,874
I'm quitting everything,
right to left, left-

2413
01:42:17,958 --> 01:42:20,171
i mean right and left.

2414
01:42:20,213 --> 01:42:21,841
I'm spittin' cotton.

2415
01:42:21,926 --> 01:42:22,844
Hey, nick!

2416
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:24,389
Champagne!

2417
01:42:24,474 --> 01:42:26,896
I want to get the bad
taste of this mud scow

2418
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:28,274
out of my mouth.

2419
01:42:28,316 --> 01:42:30,237
Blow your perfume
at me, pal.

2420
01:42:30,321 --> 01:42:32,492
I'm sick of
smelling sailors.

2421
01:43:01,271 --> 01:43:04,278
Champagne never to say good-bye again.

2422
01:43:04,362 --> 01:43:06,951
Champagne to say
hello and hello.

2423
01:43:07,035 --> 01:43:08,204
Hello, hello!

2424
01:43:08,246 --> 01:43:10,501
To chili,
my dear old homestead.

2425
01:43:10,543 --> 01:43:12,547
To the dear old homestead
and dear me in it.

2426
01:43:12,632 --> 01:43:14,093
Mmm, mmm.

2427
01:43:20,818 --> 01:43:21,987
Ok!

2428
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,950
Tell time it can stop.

2429
01:43:24,786 --> 01:43:26,582
Stop, time!

2430
01:43:26,666 --> 01:43:27,919
She stop?

2431
01:43:28,002 --> 01:43:29,171
All anchored, baby.

2432
01:43:29,213 --> 01:43:30,841
Now, now say
you love me.

2433
01:43:30,926 --> 01:43:32,638
I love ya.

2434
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,640
Better.

2435
01:43:33,683 --> 01:43:34,601
Good.

2436
01:43:34,643 --> 01:43:35,854
No girl
laughs at me?

2437
01:43:35,938 --> 01:43:38,109
I'm all yours, baby.

2438
01:43:40,658 --> 01:43:42,913
Hey, let's go. Where's reno around here?

2439
01:43:42,955 --> 01:43:44,124
Reno? Who's she?

2440
01:43:44,166 --> 01:43:46,588
Ha ha! Reno's
no girl, baby.

2441
01:43:46,672 --> 01:43:48,092
Like minnie,
another ship?

2442
01:43:48,134 --> 01:43:49,261
A little city,

2443
01:43:49,304 --> 01:43:50,473
biggest little city
in the world.

2444
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:53,146
Reno sounds sweet.
Let's go to reno.

2445
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:54,190
Ok, emily.

2446
01:43:54,274 --> 01:43:55,401
Emily?

2447
01:43:56,237 --> 01:43:57,197
Oh.

2448
01:43:57,239 --> 01:43:59,160
Don't tell me
emily's a ship.

2449
01:43:59,244 --> 01:44:01,290
Don't tell me emily's a little city!

2450
01:44:01,374 --> 01:44:02,627
The good ship emily.

2451
01:44:02,711 --> 01:44:03,629
No!

2452
01:44:03,713 --> 01:44:04,882
The good old town
of emily, nevada.

2453
01:44:04,925 --> 01:44:06,052
No!

2454
01:44:06,094 --> 01:44:07,973
All right,
emily's a girl.

2455
01:44:08,057 --> 01:44:10,897
We got married
and divorced.

2456
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:17,831
Seńor patterson,
is it not?

2457
01:44:17,873 --> 01:44:18,958
It is.

2458
01:44:19,042 --> 01:44:20,378
And i brought you
some of the kid's things.

2459
01:44:20,462 --> 01:44:21,840
Ah. Yeah, the kid flunked.

2460
01:44:21,882 --> 01:44:23,594
And us guys that
didn't pray was passed.

2461
01:44:23,678 --> 01:44:24,972
Yes, i had
the same thought

2462
01:44:25,015 --> 01:44:27,019
when i was in
sail long ago.

2463
01:44:27,103 --> 01:44:28,690
The best and the
bravest, they are taken.

2464
01:44:28,774 --> 01:44:30,319
That's right,
a dirty gyp.

2465
01:44:30,403 --> 01:44:32,199
But he shoved off
with a laugh.

2466
01:44:32,283 --> 01:44:34,705
Seems like he just up
and walks away on the sea.

2467
01:44:34,789 --> 01:44:37,420
Oh, sit down.
This is my maria.

2468
01:44:37,462 --> 01:44:38,840
Seńorita.

2469
01:44:38,924 --> 01:44:40,093
Hola, seńor.

2470
01:44:40,135 --> 01:44:42,056
Long after your ship
had dropped from sight,

2471
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:44,270
she stood and waved at the empty sea.

2472
01:44:44,312 --> 01:44:47,277
Attaboy,
my statue.

2473
01:44:57,844 --> 01:45:00,099
A kindly act,
seńor.

2474
01:45:00,142 --> 01:45:01,269
I thank you.

2475
01:45:01,353 --> 01:45:03,316
To a sailor.

2476
01:45:07,785 --> 01:45:09,664
And his evening star.

2477
01:45:14,844 --> 01:45:17,517
Ok, grandpa!
What do you say?

2478
01:45:17,559 --> 01:45:19,062
Great-grandpa.

2479
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:21,109
Ok, great-grandpa.

2480
01:45:21,192 --> 01:45:22,528
Let's all get stiff.

2481
01:45:22,612 --> 01:45:24,032
I'm sorry i cannot join you, sailor,

2482
01:45:24,074 --> 01:45:25,327
i have an engagement for supper.

2483
01:45:25,369 --> 01:45:26,622
Uh-oh. Who is she?

2484
01:45:26,664 --> 01:45:30,047
My grandchildren, my great
- grandchildren,

2485
01:45:30,131 --> 01:45:32,261
my children,
and my wife.

2486
01:45:32,344 --> 01:45:34,014
Holy moses-

2487
01:45:34,099 --> 01:45:35,519
all living
in one house?

2488
01:45:35,602 --> 01:45:37,314
On my ranch
in the hills.

2489
01:45:37,398 --> 01:45:38,400
But i see
that you are

2490
01:45:38,484 --> 01:45:40,321
well-fortified,
too, seńor.

2491
01:45:40,405 --> 01:45:42,702
Do we drink again to a happy future

2492
01:45:42,786 --> 01:45:43,913
and a lot of
children?

2493
01:45:43,956 --> 01:45:45,793
Nah, no,
no children,

2494
01:45:45,877 --> 01:45:47,130
no gardens.

2495
01:45:47,214 --> 01:45:49,093
The only flower that
grows in a garden

2496
01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:50,805
is familiarity.

2497
01:45:50,889 --> 01:45:53,019
And they say
it breeds contempt.

2498
01:45:53,103 --> 01:45:56,277
Again, i had the same
thought when i was young.

2499
01:45:56,361 --> 01:45:58,825
You and i would have
had a high time once.

2500
01:45:58,909 --> 01:46:00,454
And finished,
as always,

2501
01:46:00,537 --> 01:46:02,458
with a headache
in the heart.

2502
01:46:02,542 --> 01:46:05,591
Harry was married,
seńor.

2503
01:46:05,675 --> 01:46:06,802
Oh?

2504
01:46:06,886 --> 01:46:09,183
Yeah, yeah,
i took a whack at it.

2505
01:46:09,225 --> 01:46:11,355
How long, harry?

2506
01:46:11,397 --> 01:46:13,234
3 days.

2507
01:46:13,277 --> 01:46:15,114
Quite a whack.

2508
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:16,618
Don't regret
a minute of it.

2509
01:46:16,702 --> 01:46:18,122
One long laugh.

2510
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:20,209
She'd throw a kiss
with one hand

2511
01:46:20,252 --> 01:46:21,880
and a rock
with the other.

2512
01:46:21,922 --> 01:46:24,344
Ha! That screwball!

2513
01:46:24,387 --> 01:46:26,183
"Oh," she says,

2514
01:46:26,225 --> 01:46:29,274
"you cheated that
nice little man.

2515
01:46:29,357 --> 01:46:30,401
Good-bye!"

2516
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:33,700
Just scientific,
darling.

2517
01:46:33,784 --> 01:46:36,498
"And i won't
steal a chicken!

2518
01:46:36,541 --> 01:46:38,295
Good-bye!"

2519
01:46:38,337 --> 01:46:41,594
I love you,
darling.

2520
01:46:41,637 --> 01:46:44,560
"Oh, what are you doing
on my roof?

2521
01:46:44,644 --> 01:46:47,317
Stop painting my roof!
Good-bye!"

2522
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:50,366
She was always saying
good-bye to me

2523
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:52,997
from the moment
i met her! Ha!

2524
01:46:53,081 --> 01:46:54,877
That screwball.

2525
01:47:00,766 --> 01:47:03,230
A charming,
violent lady.

2526
01:47:03,272 --> 01:47:04,525
Well, seńor...

2527
01:47:04,609 --> 01:47:06,112
no, no,
don't go.

2528
01:47:06,196 --> 01:47:07,657
I have
my engagement.

2529
01:47:07,742 --> 01:47:08,995
The madhouse
in the hills?

2530
01:47:09,078 --> 01:47:11,124
It is mad, no doubt,
but peaceful,

2531
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:13,630
and it should be a little
violent to be peaceful.

2532
01:47:13,714 --> 01:47:14,883
Yeah?

2533
01:47:14,926 --> 01:47:18,392
My wife and i live
familiarly as two old shoes,

2534
01:47:18,434 --> 01:47:19,770
yet we live
in conflict.

2535
01:47:19,854 --> 01:47:21,399
We live to make
each other laugh,

2536
01:47:21,483 --> 01:47:23,362
and the children
are our audience.

2537
01:47:23,446 --> 01:47:25,868
We are greater strangers
than the day we met,

2538
01:47:25,952 --> 01:47:27,873
and thus, my friend,

2539
01:47:27,957 --> 01:47:30,880
familiarity
breeds beauty.

2540
01:47:30,923 --> 01:47:32,468
Adios, seńor.

2541
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:33,846
Seńorita.

2542
01:47:40,696 --> 01:47:42,032
He's good.

2543
01:47:42,116 --> 01:47:44,162
The old boy's good.

2544
01:47:44,205 --> 01:47:46,543
Yes, harry.
He's very good.

2545
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:49,968
Yeah, you're 193, and
you can pull that stuff.

2546
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:52,641
When are you going
back to her?

2547
01:47:52,725 --> 01:47:55,189
Ha! Where do we go
from here?

2548
01:47:55,273 --> 01:47:56,400
I left!

2549
01:47:56,484 --> 01:47:57,987
I got laughed out.

2550
01:47:58,072 --> 01:47:59,325
I wasn't
laughing at you.

2551
01:47:59,408 --> 01:48:01,287
It wasn't you
who was laughing.

2552
01:48:01,371 --> 01:48:03,501
It's she-
laughing at me.

2553
01:48:03,585 --> 01:48:05,589
Adios, harry.

2554
01:48:05,631 --> 01:48:07,259
Hey!

2555
01:48:08,096 --> 01:48:09,808
Maria, hey!

2556
01:48:09,892 --> 01:48:11,437
Maria!

2557
01:48:11,479 --> 01:48:13,525
Hey!

2558
01:48:16,073 --> 01:48:17,367
Ha ha!

2559
01:48:17,410 --> 01:48:18,746
You see what i mean?

2560
01:48:18,788 --> 01:48:21,669
They're always saying
good-bye to me.

2561
01:48:21,712 --> 01:48:22,756
Nick!

2562
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,680
Come on, what'll you have,
everybody?

2563
01:48:27,685 --> 01:48:30,692
It's like i say, red-

2564
01:48:30,734 --> 01:48:33,114
a guy can forget
anything.

2565
01:48:33,198 --> 01:48:36,539
A big, strong guy
like you? Simple.

2566
01:48:36,581 --> 01:48:39,713
Time does it.
Time and distance.

2567
01:48:39,797 --> 01:48:41,676
Don't i know.

2568
01:48:41,719 --> 01:48:43,431
Ain't i told you,
harry?

2569
01:48:43,515 --> 01:48:45,227
Sure.

2570
01:48:45,311 --> 01:48:48,819
I'll bet you can't even
remember the guy's face

2571
01:48:48,903 --> 01:48:50,657
or nothin'
he ever said.

2572
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:51,825
Right?

2573
01:48:51,868 --> 01:48:53,622
Right.

2574
01:48:53,664 --> 01:48:57,130
He was a soft-talking heel from alabama

2575
01:48:57,173 --> 01:49:00,514
with a dimple
in his chin,

2576
01:49:00,598 --> 01:49:02,644
and i forgot him
like that.

2577
01:49:02,728 --> 01:49:04,064
Just like that.

2578
01:49:04,106 --> 01:49:05,985
And you ain't
a sailor.

2579
01:49:06,069 --> 01:49:07,990
A sailor's got plenty
of ocean-

2580
01:49:08,074 --> 01:49:10,371
10,000 miles
of the stuff.

2581
01:49:10,455 --> 01:49:13,671
And time,
that does it. Time.

2582
01:49:13,754 --> 01:49:15,424
Good old time.

2583
01:49:15,509 --> 01:49:17,847
God bless time,
i say.

2584
01:49:17,931 --> 01:49:20,854
It's better than
booze or dope.

2585
01:49:20,897 --> 01:49:22,191
The docs ain't got
nothing

2586
01:49:22,233 --> 01:49:24,906
compared to what
a few months will do.

2587
01:49:24,948 --> 01:49:26,451
Or years.

2588
01:49:26,535 --> 01:49:29,208
Sometimes
you need years.

2589
01:49:29,292 --> 01:49:31,046
Not me.

2590
01:49:31,088 --> 01:49:34,095
That depends on who
you're forgetting.

2591
01:49:34,179 --> 01:49:37,520
I don't wish to appear
dogmatic, my dear harry,

2592
01:49:37,604 --> 01:49:40,235
but it does depend
on who you forget.

2593
01:49:40,319 --> 01:49:44,036
There ain't a dame on earth
i can't forget in 6 months.

2594
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:46,207
Ok, ok.

2595
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:47,752
You fall in love
with a dame,

2596
01:49:47,837 --> 01:49:50,551
and she wants to plant
trees in your heart.

2597
01:49:50,635 --> 01:49:54,185
To shade a potato patch that
she'll water with your blood.

2598
01:49:54,269 --> 01:49:55,563
Harry...

2599
01:49:55,647 --> 01:49:57,234
harry,
mudgin's hurt.

2600
01:49:57,318 --> 01:49:58,738
He fell off
the ship.

2601
01:49:58,822 --> 01:50:00,325
Ok, throw him
back again.

2602
01:50:00,367 --> 01:50:01,995
But, harry, he's layin' on the dock

2603
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,291
with his whole
side caved in!

2604
01:50:03,333 --> 01:50:05,003
Tell the captain i don't
fall for that stuff.

2605
01:50:05,087 --> 01:50:07,467
Tell him mudgin
and i parted company.

2606
01:50:07,509 --> 01:50:10,558
Harry, captain was sailing
without you, but not mudgin.

2607
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,604
He jumped ship
to find you.

2608
01:50:12,647 --> 01:50:16,656
I ain't seen mudgin so
crazy since he lost his soul!

2609
01:50:19,705 --> 01:50:21,835
This better be
on the level.

2610
01:50:22,713 --> 01:50:24,091
Here, pal,
20 bucks.

2611
01:50:24,175 --> 01:50:25,219
What for?

2612
01:50:25,261 --> 01:50:27,432
Good conversation.

2613
01:50:36,078 --> 01:50:38,625
Ok, boys,
take him aboard.

2614
01:50:39,629 --> 01:50:41,299
How is he, doc?

2615
01:50:45,977 --> 01:50:49,026
Stop jarrin' him.

2616
01:50:51,992 --> 01:50:54,122
'Course...

2617
01:50:54,164 --> 01:50:56,001
ireland is...

2618
01:50:56,043 --> 01:50:59,843
and me wash spitoons
for sean again.

2619
01:50:59,928 --> 01:51:04,188
The sea... ships...

2620
01:51:05,274 --> 01:51:07,237
good-bye, darlin'.

2621
01:51:08,824 --> 01:51:10,202
Look out!

2622
01:51:10,286 --> 01:51:11,956
Torpedo, torpedo!

2623
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:13,167
Ok, mudge, ok.

2624
01:51:13,252 --> 01:51:14,129
Lay still and rest.

2625
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:17,803
Oh, it's you, harry.

2626
01:51:17,888 --> 01:51:18,848
Yeah.

2627
01:51:18,932 --> 01:51:20,560
Here, want some
water?

2628
01:51:20,603 --> 01:51:23,359
Where's the sky?

2629
01:51:23,443 --> 01:51:25,406
And the wind
blowin'?

2630
01:51:25,489 --> 01:51:26,742
We're on the ship,
mudge.

2631
01:51:26,784 --> 01:51:27,953
Bound for frisco.

2632
01:51:28,037 --> 01:51:29,457
Frisco?

2633
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:31,504
Then i'll go
on deck now.

2634
01:51:31,588 --> 01:51:33,718
No, no, no.
Take it easy.

2635
01:51:37,059 --> 01:51:40,734
But a man mustn't
die in this rathole.

2636
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:43,574
You ain't gonna die.

2637
01:51:43,658 --> 01:51:46,038
Indeed, now?

2638
01:51:49,005 --> 01:51:50,759
Let's take him
on deck, harry.

2639
01:51:50,842 --> 01:51:52,053
Couldn't make him
no worse.

2640
01:51:52,137 --> 01:51:54,726
Yeah, if we
done it careful.

2641
01:51:56,189 --> 01:51:57,316
Ok. Ok.

2642
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:04,417
The sky...

2643
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,170
the wind...

2644
01:52:11,643 --> 01:52:15,276
mudge, we're out of
the rathole.

2645
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,487
I know it.

2646
01:52:16,571 --> 01:52:17,782
Well, take a look.

2647
01:52:17,866 --> 01:52:22,209
I'm scared to...
and ashamed.

2648
01:52:22,293 --> 01:52:24,757
Nothing to feel
that way about.

2649
01:52:24,799 --> 01:52:26,093
The fog-

2650
01:52:26,178 --> 01:52:28,600
the fog's
closin' in,

2651
01:52:28,642 --> 01:52:31,231
and i ain't got
my soul-

2652
01:52:31,315 --> 01:52:34,113
my weepin'
immortal soul.

2653
01:52:34,197 --> 01:52:36,160
You never lost it,
mudge.

2654
01:52:36,244 --> 01:52:38,582
Yes, i did.
On powell street.

2655
01:52:38,625 --> 01:52:40,337
A tiny light,
a little star.

2656
01:52:40,379 --> 01:52:41,924
I'm in
the dark now.

2657
01:52:42,008 --> 01:52:43,135
All by myself,

2658
01:52:43,219 --> 01:52:45,808
and not even a match to
strike on my britches.

2659
01:52:45,892 --> 01:52:48,356
A disgrace
to ireland.

2660
01:52:59,174 --> 01:53:00,677
Aye...

2661
01:53:00,761 --> 01:53:05,021
did you feel it,
harry?

2662
01:53:05,063 --> 01:53:06,357
Did it touch you?

2663
01:53:09,157 --> 01:53:11,495
Sure, mudge, sure.

2664
01:53:12,582 --> 01:53:14,336
Tell me something-

2665
01:53:14,419 --> 01:53:17,342
my soul, he give it
back to me.

2666
01:53:30,709 --> 01:53:32,922
That's right,
mudge.

2667
01:53:46,956 --> 01:53:48,376
Near enough.

2668
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:53,764
Ain't you got
up there yet?

2669
01:53:53,848 --> 01:53:56,688
Oh, you still loose?

2670
01:53:56,730 --> 01:53:58,776
Nothing ever
changes.

2671
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:00,321
Well, i guess
i'll take a chance.

2672
01:54:00,364 --> 01:54:01,992
Brother,
you're due.

2673
01:54:02,034 --> 01:54:03,621
I'll hang around
a few minutes,

2674
01:54:03,705 --> 01:54:05,166
in case you come
out on your ear.

2675
01:54:05,251 --> 01:54:06,420
Ok.

2676
01:54:18,867 --> 01:54:20,120
Hi, helen.

2677
01:54:20,162 --> 01:54:21,498
Emily!

2678
01:54:21,582 --> 01:54:22,960
Hi, pal.

2679
01:54:23,002 --> 01:54:25,842
Em! Em!

2680
01:54:26,928 --> 01:54:27,930
Where is she?

2681
01:54:27,972 --> 01:54:29,726
She don't live here
anymore.

2682
01:54:29,768 --> 01:54:30,728
Where does she live?

2683
01:54:30,771 --> 01:54:31,856
Why?

2684
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:33,151
Hey, what's
eating you?

2685
01:54:33,235 --> 01:54:34,237
What kind of
a greeting is this?

2686
01:54:34,279 --> 01:54:35,949
Greet you?
I greet you?

2687
01:54:36,033 --> 01:54:37,745
I could cut your throat, you rat!

2688
01:54:37,829 --> 01:54:39,457
And i could
cut mine, too!

2689
01:54:39,542 --> 01:54:41,087
That morning
from reno in there-

2690
01:54:41,129 --> 01:54:42,382
that day of
the big celebration

2691
01:54:42,424 --> 01:54:43,927
and all that stuff
i pulled about-

2692
01:54:43,969 --> 01:54:46,934
about being so happy because
you made her feel so happy!

2693
01:54:47,018 --> 01:54:49,858
Oh, boy, all those words
came back and bit me!

2694
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:51,111
What's the matter,
helen?

2695
01:54:51,195 --> 01:54:52,740
Emily and i parted
the best pals going.

2696
01:54:52,782 --> 01:54:54,076
She don't know
you're alive!

2697
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:55,956
She'd divorced.
She's rid of you.

2698
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:58,128
She's all right,
and you leave her alone.

2699
01:54:58,212 --> 01:55:00,425
You leave her alone!

2700
01:55:00,509 --> 01:55:02,764
There's my cab.

2701
01:55:08,236 --> 01:55:10,199
Where you going?

2702
01:55:11,995 --> 01:55:13,916
Where you going?

2703
01:55:15,545 --> 01:55:17,842
Golden gate bridge.

2704
01:55:19,304 --> 01:55:20,640
Where you going?

2705
01:55:20,725 --> 01:55:22,980
Hey-hey, i thought
that other dame-

2706
01:55:23,022 --> 01:55:24,066
hurry, driver, hurry.

2707
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:25,778
Hey, what is?

2708
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:28,075
You tell me where emily
is, and i'm not kiddin'.

2709
01:55:28,117 --> 01:55:29,704
I'll tell you.
She's having a baby!

2710
01:55:29,788 --> 01:55:31,667
How do you like
that?

2711
01:55:31,751 --> 01:55:32,711
A baby?

2712
01:55:32,795 --> 01:55:35,259
Yeah, a baby.
Ever heard of them?

2713
01:55:35,343 --> 01:55:36,930
Well, this is it!

2714
01:55:36,972 --> 01:55:40,021
What's the idea of her having
a baby, and me not knowing it?

2715
01:55:40,105 --> 01:55:41,942
If i'm a father,
i'm a father.

2716
01:55:41,984 --> 01:55:43,237
Where is she?

2717
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:44,907
We're going there.
The farm.

2718
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:46,871
Well, you wait
till i get there.

2719
01:55:46,913 --> 01:55:49,251
Come on, step on it!
Get going!

2720
01:55:49,294 --> 01:55:51,507
Yes, father.

2721
01:55:56,394 --> 01:55:58,565
I'm going
to town. Stick around.

2722
01:55:58,650 --> 01:56:00,529
Yeah, he won't be
with us long.

2723
01:56:00,613 --> 01:56:02,074
The least you could do
is leave her alone now.

2724
01:56:02,158 --> 01:56:03,661
Yeah? Well, it's on your head.

2725
01:56:03,703 --> 01:56:05,373
The doctor says she's in
no condition to be upset.

2726
01:56:05,416 --> 01:56:06,543
I'm handling this.

2727
01:56:08,047 --> 01:56:09,258
Hello,
miss melohn.

2728
01:56:09,342 --> 01:56:10,427
How is she?

2729
01:56:10,512 --> 01:56:11,472
She seems
fine.

2730
01:56:11,514 --> 01:56:12,934
No, no,
i'm sorry.

2731
01:56:13,018 --> 01:56:14,103
No visitors.

2732
01:56:14,187 --> 01:56:15,189
I ain't no visitor,
toots.

2733
01:56:15,231 --> 01:56:16,316
Chief surgeon,
merchant marine.

2734
01:56:16,401 --> 01:56:17,319
He is?

2735
01:56:17,361 --> 01:56:19,115
No, it's him-
the big bosun.

2736
01:56:19,157 --> 01:56:20,577
Oh.

2737
01:56:39,832 --> 01:56:42,212
Don't see it. Where do you keep it?

2738
01:56:42,297 --> 01:56:44,260
Said there's
a tree in here.

2739
01:56:44,302 --> 01:56:47,016
Oh. Is that it
out there?

2740
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:48,394
It's a big tree.

2741
01:56:48,437 --> 01:56:50,400
One night i met a girl
underneath it.

2742
01:56:50,483 --> 01:56:54,283
Shh! Shh!

2743
01:56:54,368 --> 01:56:56,331
We're in the library,
at that.

2744
01:56:56,414 --> 01:56:57,750
I'm just whistling
for drinks.

2745
01:56:57,834 --> 01:56:59,421
Ha ha ha ha!

2746
01:57:00,299 --> 01:57:03,139
Hiya, pal!
Remember me?

2747
01:57:03,222 --> 01:57:07,565
I wouldn't know you,
you've changed so.

2748
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:09,654
How do you do,
mr. Patterson?

2749
01:57:09,696 --> 01:57:11,366
How do you do?

2750
01:57:11,451 --> 01:57:14,124
You don't look
no different, baby.

2751
01:57:14,207 --> 01:57:17,256
Hey, i got the news
from dear old helen.

2752
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:19,010
Congratulations,
pal.

2753
01:57:19,094 --> 01:57:20,681
Oh.

2754
01:57:20,723 --> 01:57:23,103
All right, are you?

2755
01:57:23,187 --> 01:57:24,356
Uh-huh.

2756
01:57:24,398 --> 01:57:27,279
I'm fine, i'm fine.

2757
01:57:28,533 --> 01:57:31,331
And you shouldn't be
reading in this light.

2758
01:57:31,415 --> 01:57:33,921
You want to ruin
your eyes? Hmm?

2759
01:57:35,049 --> 01:57:37,304
No air!

2760
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:39,225
Hey...

2761
01:57:39,309 --> 01:57:41,063
when's this supposed
to happen, pal?

2762
01:57:41,106 --> 01:57:42,651
It could have
happened yesterday.

2763
01:57:42,734 --> 01:57:43,861
Well, what's
the idea?

2764
01:57:43,946 --> 01:57:45,950
Why ain't you in a
hospital, where you belong?

2765
01:57:45,992 --> 01:57:47,036
This ain't no setup.

2766
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:49,291
A farm,
a hick doctor.

2767
01:57:49,375 --> 01:57:51,421
You know who'll take the
rap if anything goes wrong?

2768
01:57:51,506 --> 01:57:52,550
Me.

2769
01:57:52,592 --> 01:57:54,889
Such concern, harry-

2770
01:57:54,931 --> 01:57:56,434
i'm overcome.

2771
01:57:56,476 --> 01:57:58,731
But i was born
in this bed,

2772
01:57:58,773 --> 01:58:00,276
and dr. Ashlon
was my doctor.

2773
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,323
I see. Dr. Ashlon
was your doctor,

2774
01:58:02,407 --> 01:58:03,618
now he's my doctor.

2775
01:58:03,702 --> 01:58:05,706
An old man tripping
on his beard.

2776
01:58:05,748 --> 01:58:07,460
Not a chance.

2777
01:58:07,544 --> 01:58:10,217
Are you having
a good time?

2778
01:58:10,259 --> 01:58:11,804
Hmm?

2779
01:58:12,807 --> 01:58:16,064
Just as fresh
as ever.

2780
01:58:16,149 --> 01:58:18,446
A dame's gonna have a baby,
she usually writes a guy,

2781
01:58:18,529 --> 01:58:19,907
don't she?

2782
01:58:19,991 --> 01:58:22,121
Sometimes a girl...

2783
01:58:22,205 --> 01:58:23,959
gets writer's cramp,
harry.

2784
01:58:24,001 --> 01:58:25,212
Yeah?

2785
01:58:25,296 --> 01:58:28,428
Well, it wasn't
thoughtful of you.

2786
01:58:28,512 --> 01:58:29,848
Ha!

2787
01:58:29,932 --> 01:58:32,145
I've been wondering what it
would be like to see you again.

2788
01:58:32,187 --> 01:58:33,356
How is it?

2789
01:58:34,317 --> 01:58:37,115
Oh, it's just... gay.

2790
01:58:37,158 --> 01:58:38,870
What's that mean?

2791
01:58:38,954 --> 01:58:40,290
It doesn't hurt.

2792
01:58:41,334 --> 01:58:45,009
Not to be hurt
hurts more.

2793
01:58:46,347 --> 01:58:48,226
I guess i don't
get you.

2794
01:58:48,268 --> 01:58:49,437
That big tree.

2795
01:58:49,479 --> 01:58:52,235
You met a girl
under it, harry.

2796
01:58:52,278 --> 01:58:54,616
That first night,
that first kiss...

2797
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:59,085
the moon turned over, and the
flood splashed in her face.

2798
01:58:59,127 --> 01:59:02,301
Where is that girl?

2799
01:59:03,597 --> 01:59:05,894
I don't see myself
in your eyes, harry.

2800
01:59:05,977 --> 01:59:07,104
Harry.

2801
01:59:07,189 --> 01:59:08,442
Yeah?

2802
01:59:08,525 --> 01:59:11,406
Will you marry me,
harry?

2803
01:59:11,491 --> 01:59:13,370
Sure thing,
anytime!

2804
01:59:13,454 --> 01:59:15,375
Right to left,
left to right.

2805
01:59:15,417 --> 01:59:18,173
You wouldn't marry me if i asked you to.

2806
01:59:18,215 --> 01:59:20,929
Oh, probably would.

2807
01:59:21,014 --> 01:59:23,687
I was alone for a long
while before you came along,

2808
01:59:23,729 --> 01:59:28,114
and i've been alone for a
longer while since you left.

2809
01:59:28,198 --> 01:59:32,500
I know there'll never be
another man under a tree for me.

2810
01:59:32,541 --> 01:59:35,631
Funny, all that talk
of trees and libraries.

2811
01:59:35,674 --> 01:59:39,140
There should be a real
tree, for a minute.

2812
01:59:41,396 --> 01:59:43,400
Well, pal,
i'll hand you one.

2813
01:59:43,485 --> 01:59:46,450
I'll never kiss another
girl under a tree, either.

2814
01:59:46,534 --> 01:59:48,538
We just missed,
didn't we?

2815
01:59:50,794 --> 01:59:52,464
How long you staying
this time, harry?

2816
01:59:52,548 --> 01:59:54,970
Oh, i got a couple
of weeks, with luck.

2817
01:59:55,054 --> 01:59:56,223
Good.

2818
01:59:56,265 --> 01:59:57,810
How are the boys?

2819
01:59:57,894 --> 02:00:01,945
Oh, and harry,
how's my mudgin?

2820
02:00:01,988 --> 02:00:03,742
He's ok.

2821
02:00:03,825 --> 02:00:05,704
He, uh,
found his soul.

2822
02:00:05,747 --> 02:00:06,707
Oh?

2823
02:00:06,749 --> 02:00:09,087
It had wings
on him.

2824
02:00:09,130 --> 02:00:11,093
Flew away
with him.

2825
02:00:17,275 --> 02:00:19,112
You must miss him
terribly.

2826
02:00:21,034 --> 02:00:23,790
Aw, he's just
a pal of mine.

2827
02:00:23,874 --> 02:00:25,962
He's a pal
of mine, too.

2828
02:00:26,046 --> 02:00:29,470
He called me
queen dierdre.

2829
02:00:29,512 --> 02:00:31,850
That poor lost poet

2830
02:00:31,935 --> 02:00:35,401
who had the strength
of a bosun.

2831
02:00:35,485 --> 02:00:37,615
He was strong
enough.

2832
02:00:41,625 --> 02:00:43,295
What's the matter?

2833
02:00:43,338 --> 02:00:45,092
Oh...

2834
02:00:45,134 --> 02:00:48,517
a friend of ours
wants to see us.

2835
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:50,354
Oh...

2836
02:00:50,438 --> 02:00:51,899
nurse! Nurse!

2837
02:00:51,942 --> 02:00:52,986
Pain?

2838
02:00:53,069 --> 02:00:55,825
Yeah. Where are you?
Get in there, will you?

2839
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:58,123
It hit her
just like a knife.

2840
02:00:58,165 --> 02:00:59,793
Well, that's what
we've been waiting for.

2841
02:00:59,836 --> 02:01:02,676
That's great. You've
been waiting for it.

2842
02:01:39,849 --> 02:01:40,809
Harry!

2843
02:01:40,852 --> 02:01:42,021
She all right?

2844
02:01:42,063 --> 02:01:43,566
Yes, she's all right.

2845
02:01:43,650 --> 02:01:45,320
You got a little boy,
harry!

2846
02:01:45,362 --> 02:01:48,494
But if you want to see
him, you better hurry!

2847
02:01:55,637 --> 02:01:58,059
Cyanosis, doctor.

2848
02:02:00,273 --> 02:02:03,322
Normal
pregnancy, normal birth,

2849
02:02:03,406 --> 02:02:04,366
but he doesn't
breathe.

2850
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:05,786
Tell me why.

2851
02:02:05,829 --> 02:02:07,666
You're just out of
johns hopkins, ain't you?

2852
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:09,211
You know everything.
Tell me why.

2853
02:02:09,254 --> 02:02:10,256
Get out of here.

2854
02:02:10,298 --> 02:02:11,425
I'm his father.

2855
02:02:11,509 --> 02:02:12,929
Father? You are?

2856
02:02:12,971 --> 02:02:14,265
Oxygen.

2857
02:02:14,349 --> 02:02:16,479
Oxygen got to...

2858
02:02:16,563 --> 02:02:17,690
any chance, doc?

2859
02:02:17,732 --> 02:02:19,528
I don't know.

2860
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:21,491
Johns hopkins
doesn't know.

2861
02:02:22,577 --> 02:02:23,871
Adrenaline.

2862
02:02:24,791 --> 02:02:26,044
Maybe some more
doctors-

2863
02:02:26,128 --> 02:02:27,046
don't talk like
a fool!

2864
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:29,260
50 seconds between
life and death,

2865
02:02:29,344 --> 02:02:30,513
and he calls
for more doctors.

2866
02:02:30,555 --> 02:02:33,102
Our baby.
And we did it.

2867
02:02:33,186 --> 02:02:37,028
Don't even give god
credit for a little help.

2868
02:02:37,113 --> 02:02:38,867
L- i'm praying.

2869
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:41,456
Well, i don't know
why he should hear you.

2870
02:02:41,498 --> 02:02:43,461
Moochers, all of us.

2871
02:02:43,503 --> 02:02:46,844
Take his loan of life
and never work it out,

2872
02:02:46,886 --> 02:02:48,723
never pay him back.

2873
02:02:48,807 --> 02:02:50,268
Squandered
his sunshine

2874
02:02:50,311 --> 02:02:52,817
on miserable
two-legged beasts,

2875
02:02:52,859 --> 02:02:55,030
lend his world to
biological misfits-

2876
02:02:55,114 --> 02:02:56,826
deaf, dumb, blind.

2877
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:58,288
Make him breathe, doc.

2878
02:02:58,372 --> 02:02:59,666
Come on.

2879
02:02:59,751 --> 02:03:02,591
Grab it, sonny.
Work your lungs.

2880
02:03:02,633 --> 02:03:04,512
Cyanosis, doctor. More oxygen.

2881
02:03:04,596 --> 02:03:07,143
Yeah,
that'll do it.

2882
02:03:07,227 --> 02:03:08,981
It worked in the past,
that ought to do it.

2883
02:03:09,065 --> 02:03:10,192
Yeah.

2884
02:03:10,276 --> 02:03:13,784
Pin clouds of glory on
him with a hypo needle.

2885
02:03:15,079 --> 02:03:17,543
Syringe music
in his ears.

2886
02:03:17,585 --> 02:03:19,840
Drop stars
in his eyes.

2887
02:03:19,924 --> 02:03:21,260
And...

2888
02:03:29,113 --> 02:03:31,911
and i guess he couldn't do it for us.

2889
02:03:31,995 --> 02:03:34,501
His little
immortal soul is-

2890
02:03:34,543 --> 02:03:36,046
breathe!

2891
02:03:37,133 --> 02:03:38,803
Breathe for us, pal.

2892
02:03:38,887 --> 02:03:40,850
Come on, boy.

2893
02:03:40,933 --> 02:03:43,898
I want to give you
to your mother.

2894
02:03:43,982 --> 02:03:45,778
Come on with it!

2895
02:03:45,862 --> 02:03:48,618
You got to do it for me!

2896
02:03:49,872 --> 02:03:51,208
Breathe.

2897
02:03:51,292 --> 02:03:52,962
For your mother.

2898
02:04:05,618 --> 02:04:06,829
Attaboy.

2899
02:04:06,913 --> 02:04:09,419
Attaboy!

2900
02:04:16,728 --> 02:04:19,777
Harry!
Harry!

2901
02:04:26,502 --> 02:04:28,673
You hear him?
He's here.

2902
02:04:28,757 --> 02:04:30,678
He's here
to stay.

2903
02:04:32,683 --> 02:04:34,144
I heard you, harry.

2904
02:04:34,229 --> 02:04:35,732
I heard you.

2905
02:04:41,121 --> 02:04:43,000
Listen to him.

2906
02:04:44,086 --> 02:04:45,380
Yes.

2907
02:04:47,762 --> 02:04:50,518
Young harry patterson.

2908
02:04:50,602 --> 02:04:52,523
Young mudgin patterson.

2909
02:04:52,607 --> 02:04:55,238
Oh, yes.

2910
02:04:55,322 --> 02:04:56,700
Yes.

2911
02:04:56,783 --> 02:05:00,249
Young william mudgin
patterson.

2912
02:05:02,088 --> 02:05:03,800
Young mudgin.

2913
02:05:04,845 --> 02:05:07,267
Big harry.

2914
02:05:07,309 --> 02:05:09,522
Emily.

2915
02:05:09,606 --> 02:05:12,780
And a tree.

2916
02:05:13,305 --> 02:06:13,882
