1
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:56,146
We can't hold out much longer, sir!

2
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,802
General Hummel, 
you've gotta get us outta here now!

3
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:29,513
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.

4
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:39,732
Goddam it, sir! How long do we have to wait? 
I've lost 15 men already!

5
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:43,444
Sir, they're lightin' us up like a firestorm!

6
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,821
This is General Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!

7
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:48,449
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.

8
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,288
They're not coming for us, are they, sir?

9
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,886
Congressman Weaver and esteemed members
of the Special Armed Services Committee,

10
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:12,639
I come before you to protest a grave injustice.

11
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:23,692
Aim!

12
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:28,072
It has to stop.

13
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:14,576
I miss you so much.

14
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:26,588
There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

15
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:29,508
Something I couldn't do while you were here.

16
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:34,513
I tried.
You know I tried everything.

17
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:38,851
And I still don't have their attention.

18
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:42,813
Let's hope this elevates their thinking.

19
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:45,315
But whatever happens...

20
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:49,945
please don't think less of me.

21
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:34,573
Marine, inform the garrison C.O.

22
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:37,492
that General Hummel's coming on board
with a security inspection team.

23
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:41,330
Yes, sir. 
Sir, it's an honor having you, sir.

24
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:14,154
Ya know, at least we can get some-

25
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,282
- A long time before guard meeting, huh?
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.

26
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:36,635
I got the access card. 
We've got 30 minutes till those darts wear off.

27
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,845
Move it!

28
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,559
The access card, sir.

29
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:49,189
Let's do it.

30
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:55,320
Twenty-four hundred magazine check.

31
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,547
- Man, it's wet out there!
- Check me through, will ya?

32
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,892
Clear!

33
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:56,131
- I want 16, Major!
- Move it!

34
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:24,993
Evac!
Seal the door!

35
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:26,244
- No! No!
- Come on, man! Seal it!

36
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:29,164
- No! Help!
- Seal it!

37
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,794
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here! Oh, God! 

38
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,005
Let me out! Let me out!

39
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,176
Clear out.
Get outta here!

40
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,852
Sorry.

41
00:07:56,232 --> 00:07:58,526
Let's move out.

42
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,332
Two more cc's of acetylene chloride.

43
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:20,548
- That'll be five dollars, Isherwood.
- You suck.

44
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,100
You guys have too much time on your hands.

45
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:34,145
Yes! She's here! Bring it to me now. 
Thank you, Phil!

46
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,524
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

47
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,736
Carla wouldn't approve. 
She thinks it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

48
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:46,157
Carla's right. 
Why don't you just spend $13 on a CD, man?

49
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:48,410
First of all, it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

50
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:50,912
And second, these sound better.

51
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:56,084
Could be serious.
Could be sarin gas.

52
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:01,297
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff of something 
in this package

53
00:09:01,423 --> 00:09:03,299
postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp.

54
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,718
It could be detergent,
or it could be sarin gas.

55
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:08,179
Bosnian refugee camp?

56
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:11,641
Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin. 
Serbians don't like Bosnians.

57
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,935
You guys wanna get suited up?

58
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:20,692
- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

59
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:24,821
We have air lock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.

60
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:31,619
October 1, 0900 hours.

61
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:35,415
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent Trainee Marvin Isherwood

62
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,750
initiating exam of wooden crate.

63
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:41,296
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

64
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:43,840
- Marvin, sarin is a-
- G.B. aerosol.

65
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,675
That is correct.

66
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,011
Now, let's see.
We have some dirty magazines.

67
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:51,014
Stone Age Cave Girls in the Raw. Kinky.

68
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,309
And, uh-
Not a good sign.

69
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:57,520
Hello, little baby doll.

70
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:59,647
Look it, Stan. 

71
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:01,858
- Hi there, Stanley.
- Marvin, don't!

72
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:05,987
- Hi, Stan.
- Shit! Move back! Move back!

73
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:10,074
- I want the exhaust.
- Hang on, guys.

74
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,535
We'll have that room clear in 50 seconds! 
You're gonna be okay.

75
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,621
Jesus Christ!

76
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:19,709
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

77
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:23,212
The bad news is that the gas is corrosive 
and it's eating our suits.

78
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:25,124
It's all over my hand, man!

79
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,625
The really bad news is there's enough C-4 and poison gas 
to blow the whole chamber

80
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,089
and kill everybody in the building.

81
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,490
- Detonation too heavy.
- Everybody, out of the room now!

82
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:35,892
Seal us inside.

83
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:42,857
- Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?
- The acid's eating my su-

84
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:46,402
It's eating my fucking suit!
All right? Shit!

85
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:49,697
- Just wash us off!
- Where are my sprinklers?

86
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:51,824
We're working on it. It's coming.
It's just a flow problem.

87
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,444
Well, that's a pretty big friggin' problem, Lonner. 
Fix it now!

88
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:56,797
We're working on it! 
How much time do you have on that detonator?

89
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:57,998
A minute ten.

90
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:00,291
- Look at this!
- We're gonna have the room clear.

91
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,461
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!
- The atropine, Isherwood.

92
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:06,255
- What?
- Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!

93
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:07,977
Marvin, the atropine, now!

94
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:10,678
Inject it in your heart before your suit melts.

95
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,262
Shit!

96
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:15,181
Make him take his dose.

97
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:18,643
- Where's that water?
- Get that away from me!

98
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:22,271
Come on, Phil, fix it for Christ's sake!

99
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:24,633
Take the atropine now, Stan, for Christ's sake!

100
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:25,634
We're fucked.

101
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:27,419
The poison's mixing.

102
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:31,739
What the fuck are you waiting for, Stanley? 
You take the fucking needle now!

103
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:34,450
- Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit!
- Forty seconds!

104
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:37,995
If that suit melts-
If you die, we all die!

105
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:40,623
Inject your heart and then diffuse the bomb!

106
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:43,876
- Come on, just do it, Stan!
- What if I miss my heart? I can't see shit!

107
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:44,823
Do it now!

108
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:48,924
Look how big this is. 
You want me to stick this into my heart?

109
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:52,510
- Are you fucking nuts?
- The sprinkler's coming! It's coming!

110
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:54,721
Okay, here we go, man!

111
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:59,434
Sprinkler activated.

112
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,477
How much time left?

113
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:03,729
Twenty seconds!

114
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:06,941
We're not gonna make it.

115
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:10,236
Fifteen.

116
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:14,991
Oh, come on.

117
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:17,368
Clear!

118
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:21,914
Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber!

119
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,959
I almost stabbed myself in the heart with this thing.

120
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:28,045
<i>Please lock me away</i>... 

121
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:30,548
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

122
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:32,216
Hi, baby.

123
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:40,057
I had such an interesting day today.

124
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:42,477
Yeah, I had kind of an interesting day myself.

125
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:45,938
Oh, okay, you go first.

126
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:50,359
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send 
a little care package, box of goodies,

127
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:54,572
which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

128
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:56,282
So I took the rest of the day off.

129
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:59,493
Glass of wine, little guitar.
Just relaxing.

130
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:00,694
Wow!

131
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:05,041
I mean it, honey. 
The world is being Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

132
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,211
I really believe that anyone 
who's even thinking about having a child in this world,

133
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:11,839
is coldly considering an act of cruelty.

134
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:14,800
I know, I'm rambling, I'm complaining. 
I'm sorry.

135
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:18,221
- What's your news, baby?
- I'm pregnant.

136
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,599
I'm sorry?

137
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:24,602
I'm pregnant.

138
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:29,315
- Really?
- Yeah.

139
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,401
- Wow!
- Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

140
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:34,987
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

141
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,323
How do you know? 
I mean, h- how do you know?

142
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:44,080
Blue! 
Just turned blue so I went to the doctor.

143
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:46,308
Well, you didn't mean what you just said, did you?

144
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:47,109
When?

145
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,377
Uh, just right now when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world,

146
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:52,380
and having it be an act of cruelty.

147
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:53,767
I meant it at the time.

148
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:56,768
Stanley, at the time?
You said it seven and a half seconds ago.

149
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,028
Well, gosh!

150
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:02,348
Kind of a lot's happened since then.
Look, we're not even married.

151
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:05,520
I know. 
It's funny you should mention that.

152
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:07,021
It's funny?

153
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:10,690
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

154
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,100
Good.

155
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:16,391
Will you marry me?

156
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:20,592
Whoa! Whoa! Wai- 
Hey, Marriage Police, pull over!

157
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:23,536
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

158
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:37,216
The Rock is the most famous 
and was the most feared prison ever built.

159
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:39,802
Is it really true that there's never been an escape?

160
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:44,098
Ah, that's true. 
From 1936 until '63 when the prison closed,

161
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,016
there were 14 attempts.

162
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:51,772
No one is believed to have made it to shore, 
alive at least.

163
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:55,025
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. 
I'm sorry, but tourists are not allowed back here.

164
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:57,570
- I don't really give a shit! Do you?
- No.

165
00:14:57,695 --> 00:15:00,114
- Come here, fruity.
- Move!

166
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:03,276
Hey, girls? Hi. 
You all havin' a good time?

167
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,177
Yeah.

168
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:07,037
Will you do something for me?
It's really, it's really important.

169
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:10,908
Tell your teacher that you need to get back on the boat 
and go home right now.

170
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,503
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Broadway!

171
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,589
This cell block housed

172
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:20,259
the most awesome scum in America.

173
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:22,970
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Ranger Bob,

174
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:27,766
cordially invite you to become inmates of Alcatraz, 
temporarily, of course.

175
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,855
On the line!

176
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:37,443
Pretty tight quarters, aren't they, huh?

177
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,904
Like being a caged animal.

178
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:42,573
Spend a couple of years in there-

179
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:44,310
What's the matter, fellas?
Something wrong with the tour?

180
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,711
The tour's over, Bob.

181
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:55,461
What kind of fucked-up tour is this?

182
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:12,186
General Hummel, 
Captains Frye and Darrow reporting, sir.

183
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,865
Welcome to the Rock, gentlemen.

184
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:16,066
Land the choppers on the back side 
and deploy as planned.

185
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,525
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Move out!

186
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,611
I'm not allowed to carry a gun.

187
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:23,447
Oh, you're not allowed to carry a gun? 
I got a goddam gun.

188
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:27,284
If I'd've known this was gonna happen, 
I'd have brought my motherfuckin' gun! Help!

189
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:31,932
All right, gentlemen, this'll be our new home.

190
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,833
Tom, I want my command center right here.

191
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:44,093
- I want Coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

192
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:48,555
Put the satellite over there.
I wanna be up at 1600.

193
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,642
Let's move it.

194
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:01,538
Systems up.

195
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:03,539
Possible penetration point in the shower room.

196
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:07,700
- We're setting anti-intrusion.
- I brought a personal touch, sir.

197
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:11,829
It's an anti-motion trembler device. 
It's custom-made.

198
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:14,540
Nobody knows about it and nobody expects it.

199
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:18,002
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

200
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:22,089
And then if they disturb Mr. Backup here, 
we own 'em.

201
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:39,356
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're being detained against your will.

202
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:41,442
For that, I apologize.

203
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,744
It is not our intention in any way to harm you.

204
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:47,406
You will not be detained one minute longer 
than is necessary for us to complete our mission.

205
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:56,290
Attention on deck!

206
00:17:56,415 --> 00:18:00,085
Stand easy, men.

207
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,965
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, 
we are now in harm's way.

208
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,344
For Major Baxter and I, 
this is the last campaign in a career datin' back to Tet '68.

209
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,682
Likewise for Captain Hendrix, Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

210
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:17,561
who cut their teeth under my command in Desert Storm.

211
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:21,231
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow, 
this is my first operational situation with you and your men.

212
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:24,067
And I have to say, 
thus far your conduct reflects your reputations.

213
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:26,111
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

214
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:29,698
We have achieved our position through poise, 
precision and audacity.

215
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:31,867
To this we must now add resolve.

216
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:35,412
We'll be branded as traitors,
the gravest capital crime.

217
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:37,664
Punishable by death.

218
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:41,001
A couple hundred years ago,

219
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:43,629
a few guys named Washington, Jefferson and Adams,

220
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:47,049
were branded as traitors by the British.

221
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:49,927
And now they're called patriots.

222
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:52,054
In time, so shall we.

223
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,041
God willing, in less than 48 hours 
you will evacuate this island in gunships

224
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,163
under cover of hostages and V.X. gas warheads.

225
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:05,108
Your destination: 
a non-extradition treaty country.

226
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:09,780
You will each be paid a fee of $1 million 
for services rendered.

227
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:14,660
But you can never again set foot on your native soil.

228
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:17,579
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

229
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,456
The men of Marine Force Recon

230
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:23,168
are selected to carry out
illegal operations throughout the world.

231
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:27,673
When they don't come home...

232
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:31,510
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them,

233
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,804
and denied compensation.

234
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:37,307
Well, I have choked on these lies my entire career!

235
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:39,935
Well, here and now the lies stop!

236
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:49,528
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

237
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:55,826
This is FBI Director Womack.

238
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:59,496
Director, be advised.

239
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:02,332
Eighty-one, I say again,

240
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:06,253
81 civilians are under my control as of this moment.

241
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:10,590
You are to take measures to assure this remains 
a need-to-know classified fact.

242
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,092
Who is this?

243
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:14,928
Mr. Director, 
you have a very serious problem.

244
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:17,764
A battery of V.X. gas rockets is presently deployed,

245
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:22,144
to deliver a highly lethal strike 
on the population of the San Francisco Bay area.

246
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:24,806
I will call again at 0100 hours to state my demands.

247
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,607
I want to know who I'm talking to.

248
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:30,861
This is Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel,
United States Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

249
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:32,696
Out!

250
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:37,409
- I'll cancel your reservations.
- Get the Pentagon.

251
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:43,206
And call the San Francisco office.
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

252
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:46,376
Last night General Hummel,
using brutal but nonlethal force

253
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:51,590
under the guise of a security exercise,
walked off with 15 V.X. poison gas rockets.

254
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:53,800
He lost one of his own men in the process.

255
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:57,637
That's General Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

256
00:20:57,763 --> 00:21:01,933
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

257
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:04,895
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars,

258
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,730
and the Congressional Medal of-

259
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:10,025
Jesus!
This man is a hero!

260
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,652
Well, I think "legend" 
might be a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

261
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:16,156
Well, now we can add kidnapping and extortion 
to his list of accolades.

262
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:18,700
Mr. Sinclair, General Hummel is a man of honor.

263
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:21,995
General, it's him.

264
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,082
Frank, it's Al Kramer.

265
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,043
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

266
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:30,462
I don't know, Frank.
Ah, why don't you tell me.

267
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:33,381
Got a lot of very, very worried people here, Frank.

268
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:35,467
I'll come straight to the point.

269
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:38,929
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died 
under my various commands.

270
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:41,389
Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China.

271
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:44,684
Southern China? 
We never admitted we sent troops into China.

272
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,020
Who is this?
Identify yourself.

273
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:51,066
White House Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair, General.

274
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:54,861
- How old are you, Chief of Staff Sinclair?
- I'm 33.

275
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:59,157
Well, Mr. Sinclair, 
you've probably got no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

276
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:01,618
By your ninth birthday, 
I was runnin' black ops into China,

277
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:04,704
and my men were responsible 
f- for over 200 enemy kills.

278
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,668
Al, put some rigging tape over Mr. Sinclair's mouth. 
He's wasting my time.

279
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:11,253
Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

280
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:13,505
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

281
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,384
Those surgical hits made by our smart bombs, 
covered so well on CNN?

282
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:22,138
It was my men on the ground 
that made those hits possible by lasing the targets.

283
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:25,684
Twenty of them were left to rot outside Baghdad 
after the conflict ended.

284
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,311
No benefits were paid to their families.

285
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:31,815
No medals conferred.

286
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,819
These men died for their country, 
and they weren't even given a goddam military burial.

287
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:42,492
The situation is unacceptable.
You will transfer $100 million

288
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:46,413
from the Grand Cayman Red Sea Trading Company account 
to an account I designate.

289
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:49,249
From these funds, 
reparations of $1 million will be paid

290
00:22:49,374 --> 00:22:51,876
to each of the 83 Marines' families.

291
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:55,380
The rest of the funds I will disperse at my discretion.

292
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:58,008
Do I make myself clear?

293
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:01,219
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. 
What is that?

294
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:04,306
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

295
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:08,018
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds 
from illegal arms sales.

296
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:10,645
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

297
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,441
You alert the media, I launch the gas.

298
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:17,235
You refuse payment, I launch the gas.

299
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,239
You've got 40 hours, 
till noon day after tomorrow to arrange transfer of the money.

300
00:23:21,364 --> 00:23:25,243
I am aware of your countermeasure. 
You know and I know it doesn't stand a chance.

301
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:29,164
Hummel from Alcatraz.
Out.

302
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:34,085
All right. We have to identify the hostages 
and contact each of their families.

303
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,131
Uh, tell 'em somethin'. 
Make up a story, and we've got to keep this undercover.

304
00:23:38,256 --> 00:23:42,427
If this comes out, the city of San Francisco will be in chaos. 
I am talking anarchy.

305
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:46,097
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate

306
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:51,352
for a single rocket armed with V.X. poison gas, 
General Peterson?

307
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:54,522
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's, that's not so bad.

308
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:59,486
- Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!
- Oh.

309
00:23:59,611 --> 00:24:04,240
One teaspoon of this hits the floor,
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

310
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:08,161
One teaspoon of this shit detonated in the atmosphere

311
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:11,206
will kill every living organism in an eight-block radius.

312
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:13,625
Get the point?

313
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,252
Uh, what did Hummel mean by your countermeasure, General?

314
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:20,548
Standard poison is countered by napalm. 
It burns it up, consumes it upon detonation.

315
00:24:20,673 --> 00:24:22,967
Now, the problem with V.X. poison gas is

316
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:25,470
that it's designed specifically to withstand napalm.

317
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:29,057
That's where, uh, thermite plasma comes in. 
General Peterson?

318
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:32,977
Thermite plasma incendiary systems
can burn hot enough to consume V.X.,

319
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:36,648
but they're still in the test phase; 
it's not operational.

320
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:41,194
Hummel knows this. 
We are dealing with one smart son of a bitch.

321
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:45,073
What's it gonna take 
to equip a flight of F-18s with thermite plasma

322
00:24:45,198 --> 00:24:47,867
within the next 36 hours?

323
00:24:47,992 --> 00:24:50,495
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

324
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:53,665
All right, we can try.

325
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,126
But I strongly urge you to consider the use of this 
as a secondary initiative.

326
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:59,462
Then we have to go to our primary initiative. 
Uh, Admiral?

327
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:03,091
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL ground commander, 
Commander Anderson.

328
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:07,887
Mr. Womack, who is your best chemical/biological man?

329
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,858
- Oh, that's interesting.
- Oh, yeah.

330
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:12,059
That's very compelling.

331
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:21,860
- You like my pigtails?
- Oh, yeah, the pigtails are very naughty.

332
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:24,821
Naughty. Naughty.

333
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:29,325
Just the Amaretto cream with peach sorbet persuasion.

334
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,828
- This isn't happening.
- No, Stan, don't answer it.

335
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:34,956
- This isn't happening!
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.

336
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:37,792
I have to. It's the office, baby.
They know I'm home.

337
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:40,545
How could they possibly know that you're home?

338
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,839
It's the FBI.

339
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:46,968
Stanley!

340
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:49,679
Goodspeed.
Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.

341
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:52,140
I'll be, I'll be down, 
yeah, downstairs in ten minutes.

342
00:25:52,265 --> 00:25:54,726
No, you won't.

343
00:25:56,686 --> 00:26:00,523
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

344
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:03,735
Stanley, no, 
you do not have to go to San Francisco.

345
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,946
Are you kidding me right now? 
You need to stay here and talk to me about things.

346
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:10,658
- I've got to go, baby.
- Oh! I am Catholic! Do you realize that?

347
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:14,954
I am pregnant and I am unmarried. 
And this causes a serious problem for me.

348
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,040
I cannot believe you.

349
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,967
No, no.

350
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:33,431
I love you.
I will marry you.

351
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:36,225
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

352
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:40,396
- Come to San Francisco.
- Really?

353
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:42,398
Yeah, I'm sure it's just a training exercise.

354
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:44,817
Check into the hotel.
Order up some champagne.

355
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:46,903
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

356
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:48,738
- Baby, you're gonna marry me?
- You know it.

357
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:51,532
You're gonna marry me!

358
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:55,411
- Honey, come on. Just a really quick one.
- Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

359
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,581
A night-time airdrop incursion is out 
due to the full moon.

360
00:26:58,706 --> 00:27:00,583
Likewise a frontal seaside attack.

361
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:04,003
If we're compromised and shots are fired, 
Hummel might launch.

362
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:06,756
Our only alternative is an attack from within the prison.

363
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:10,343
We penetrate the island through the tunnels
under the prison buildings undetected,

364
00:27:10,468 --> 00:27:13,387
and emerge in its center; 
that way we can jump the Marines from behind.

365
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:17,225
And if we're lucky, 
take their rocket positions without a shot fired.

366
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,769
I don't understand. 
You-you've studied the architectural plans?

367
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:23,815
They're useless. 
Alcatraz has been ripped up and rebuilt for years.

368
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,901
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

369
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:29,487
We need firsthand intelligence of the tunnel systems.

370
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:32,949
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

371
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:35,159
All the guards we contacted were useless.

372
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:40,248
Um, there is someone who I think can help us.

373
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:45,503
- This is for the sake of national security.
- No!

374
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:49,298
It's the sake of national security 
that got us here in the first place 33 years ago.

375
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:52,218
I knew! 
I knew someday this would come back to bite us.

376
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:55,179
Forget it!
He does not exist.

377
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:58,766
He does exist! 
We just chose to forget him for 30 years.

378
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:01,978
- We locked him up and threw away the key.
- Oh, and a lot of goddam good it did us.

379
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:05,815
He broke out of two maximum security prisons. 
And if he hits the streets-

380
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,234
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

381
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:11,362
Thirty years ago he was a highly trained SAS operative.

382
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:13,239
He is my age now, for Christ's sake!

383
00:28:13,364 --> 00:28:16,200
I have to get up three times a night to take a piss.

384
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:19,453
We can't risk letting him out.

385
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:23,165
He's a professional escape artist.

386
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,660
- Gosh. Neat, uh- Neat, neat plane.
- Yeah.

387
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:01,621
Dr. Goodspeed. James Womack.

388
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:03,372
- A pleasure to meet you, sir. Thank you.
- Welcome.

389
00:29:03,497 --> 00:29:05,291
You come very highly recommended.

390
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:08,878
B.A. Columbia; M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

391
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:11,047
Biochemistry, toxicology.

392
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:13,674
Well, I'm one of those fortunate people 
who like my job, sir.

393
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,594
Got my first chemistry set when I was seven. 
Blew my eyebrows off.

394
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:19,639
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

395
00:29:19,764 --> 00:29:21,515
What do you know about V.X. gas?

396
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:24,935
Liquid. 
Failed pesticide discovered by a mistake in 1952.

397
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:26,604
Uh, actually, 
it's kind of like champagne that way.

398
00:29:26,729 --> 00:29:28,439
The Franciscan monks thought they were making white wine.

399
00:29:28,564 --> 00:29:30,358
Somehow the bottle carbonated.
Voilŕ! Champagne.

400
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:33,027
- And then the whole thing just-
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.

401
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:35,363
It's very, very horrible, sir.

402
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:37,782
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

403
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:41,410
This isn't a "train" exercise, is it?

404
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:45,956
No, Dr. Goodspeed, it's not a training exercise.

405
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,121
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning, Director.

406
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,998
This is Ernest Paxton, 
agent in charge of the West Coast operation.

407
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:30,310
- Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.

408
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:31,311
How do you do, sir?

409
00:30:31,335 --> 00:30:35,714
It's been a fairly interesting day so far. 
The prisoner's here. Shall we?

410
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,802
Now, my boys, they haven't been able to find a file on this guy. 
Who is he anyway, sir?

411
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,763
His name is John Mason, a British national

412
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:47,852
incarcerated on Alcatraz in 1962, escaped in '63.

413
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:50,563
I was under the impression 
that no one ever escaped Alcatraz, sir.

414
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:52,898
Paxton, don't argue!

415
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:57,111
This man has no identity, 
not in the United States or Great Britain.

416
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:59,780
He does not exist.
Understand?

417
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:02,116
I want one thing:
how he escaped the Rock.

418
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:05,286
Specifically the route he took through the island's bowels.

419
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:08,789
- The papers are in order, sir.
- We're prepared to offer him a full pardon.

420
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:13,502
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason. 
I know him too well.

421
00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:15,963
Well, if you know him,
then why don't you question him?

422
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:20,718
No, he'll remember me. 
I don't want his anger clouding the issue.

423
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:22,261
All right, I'll take care of him.

424
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,857
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent in Charge, 
Ernest Paxton.

425
00:31:34,982 --> 00:31:39,236
In charge of what? 
Fucking me over for another three decades?

426
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:42,323
I don't know anything about your previous matters. 
I'm here because

427
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:45,409
a special situation exists 
that we feel you might be able to help us with.

428
00:31:45,534 --> 00:31:47,786
Well, what might that be?

429
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:52,207
I've been in jail longer than Nelson Mandela,
so maybe you want me to run for president.

430
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:55,586
- Not exactly.
- Mmm, a pity.

431
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:57,671
I feel rather like Alcamedes.

432
00:31:57,796 --> 00:31:58,734
Who?

433
00:31:58,735 --> 00:32:02,235
Alcamedes. 
He was imprisoned by his king in ancient Greece.

434
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:06,472
- Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.
- James the First.

435
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:10,100
Even someone as bright as you
must be aware that, uh,

436
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:12,394
there's a certain pattern emerging here.

437
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,605
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?

438
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,067
Yeah, I heard of him. 
Didn't he play hockey for the fuckin' Red Wings?

439
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:21,320
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, pops.

440
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:24,114
I don't like you any more than you like me.

441
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:26,617
But I'm here to make you a legitimate offer.

442
00:32:26,742 --> 00:32:28,911
You wanna hear what I have to say or not?

443
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:33,707
By all means, dear Paxton.
By all means.

444
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:36,126
We got a problem in a place that I think you know.

445
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:39,046
There's a hostage situation on Alcatraz.

446
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:42,633
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

447
00:32:42,758 --> 00:32:46,178
The Rock has become a tourist attraction?

448
00:32:46,303 --> 00:32:49,181
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know the Rock.

449
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:52,643
- You broke out.
- Yes, successfully.

450
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:55,729
Yeah. So why don't you do yourself a favor 
while you're helpin' us?

451
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:58,691
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

452
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:01,944
Hmm? While you got a little lead 
left in your pencil.

453
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:06,448
While I'm considering your offer,

454
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:10,744
I want a suite in the Fairmont Hotel.

455
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,581
You know I'm here to cut you a deal.

456
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:18,794
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

457
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:21,588
Here. Here's a quarter.

458
00:33:25,926 --> 00:33:30,639
Do yourself a favor. Call your lawyer.
You're goin' back to jail.

459
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:36,770
- Y-You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

460
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:39,106
I'm just givin' him somethin' to think about.

461
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:40,899
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think we have time

462
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:42,401
for him to just sit around and think about it.

463
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:45,737
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right.

464
00:33:45,863 --> 00:33:46,990
You go talk to him.

465
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:47,991
- Me?
- Yes.

466
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:50,659
- Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- You're an FBI agent!

467
00:33:50,784 --> 00:33:52,870
- W-What is your specialty again?
- Chemical weapons.

468
00:33:52,995 --> 00:33:55,664
Don't mention that!

469
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:01,753
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

470
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:06,550
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

471
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:10,179
Okay.

472
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:17,394
Hi.

473
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,523
I'm an agent with the, uh, uh, F-Federal-

474
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:24,484
FBI. Uh-

475
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,322
- Eh, well, my- I'm Stanley Goodspeed.
- But of course you are.

476
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:30,908
Well, at least he got his name right.

477
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:34,745
- Of course I am. Huh.
- And you have an emergency.

478
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,207
That's right.

479
00:34:38,332 --> 00:34:40,542
And you need my help.

480
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:42,294
Exactly right.

481
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:47,132
- Coffee.
- No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

482
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:50,218
Offer me coffee.

483
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:52,971
Oh, yes! 
Well, that was, in fact, gonna be my next-

484
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:55,807
Can we get a cup of coffee in here, please?

485
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:58,644
And offer to take these off.

486
00:34:59,645 --> 00:35:01,396
Mr. Mason, really.

487
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:04,942
- All kidding aside.
- As a gesture of your good faith.

488
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:10,390
Prisoner requests to have his handcuffs taken off.

489
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:11,591
No, no, no, no.

490
00:35:13,742 --> 00:35:15,994
Why don't you go ahead 
and have his handcuffs taken off, please?

491
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,747
Well, I guess that's one way to go.

492
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:25,003
This is a pardon and release contract
from the attorney general's office.

493
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:29,132
Now, it makes you a free man
provided you cooperate.

494
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:32,594
So if you'll just, uh, sign,

495
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,680
uh, at, uh, where it says-

496
00:35:34,805 --> 00:35:38,016
- "Signature"?
- That's- Yes. "Signature".

497
00:35:38,141 --> 00:35:43,063
Well, timeo danaos et dona ferentis.

498
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:46,191
"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."

499
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:48,902
Oh, an educated man!

500
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:54,074
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

501
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:57,035
In point of fact, I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

502
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,454
- Really?
- Yes.

503
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,208
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

504
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:07,379
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

505
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:11,383
Well-trained.

506
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:14,428
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

507
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:17,973
Okay.

508
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:21,977
I want a suite, a shower, a shave,

509
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:23,937
and the feel of a suit.

510
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:27,232
May I also suggest, uh, a haircut?

511
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:28,653
Am I out of style?

512
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:31,054
Unless you're a 20-year-old guitarist from Seattle.

513
00:36:31,778 --> 00:36:33,947
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

514
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:37,033
Yeah, well, uh, uh-
Okay, thank you very much.

515
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,988
All right. Call the Fairmont.

516
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:41,789
Close the floor if necessary,
but I want him sealed off.

517
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:44,833
And he gets two hours max.

518
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:01,051
Great job, Goodspeed.

519
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,852
Why didn't you throw in a trip to Tahiti 
while you were at it?

520
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:06,396
- I'll deliver this to the attorney general.
- Uh, no, you'll give it to me, Reynolds.

521
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:11,318
And take Attorney Reynolds outside.
There's a car waiting for you. Thank you.

522
00:37:13,653 --> 00:37:17,199
That's a signed federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

523
00:37:17,324 --> 00:37:19,826
You're not acquainted with the full facts, Goodspeed.

524
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:24,289
With all due respect, sir, I'd like clarification. 
I gave that man my word.

525
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:29,711
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know basis, 
and you don't need to know.

526
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:32,839
It's, uh, it's, eh, kind of curious, but, uh,

527
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:35,217
Sir Walter Raleigh, Alcamedes, Solzhenitsyn,

528
00:37:35,342 --> 00:37:38,178
they, um, well, they were all wrongfully imprisoned.

529
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:52,275
Womack! Now, why am I not surprised, 
you piece of shit!

530
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,653
Eh, peace! Peace!

531
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:04,496
Hey, we're not home.
Leave a message.

532
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:06,748
Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

533
00:38:06,873 --> 00:38:09,876
Uh, listen, don't come to San Francisco.

534
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:12,420
I repeat, do not come to San Francisco.

535
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:14,089
- Stanley, no!
- Carla.

536
00:38:14,214 --> 00:38:15,632
- Carla.
- Like hell I'm not coming!

537
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:18,176
Wait. Car-

538
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:26,518
Who's Carla? 
And why don't you want her to come to San Francisco?

539
00:38:32,148 --> 00:38:35,527
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

540
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:38,571
Watch it, he'll bite you.

541
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:50,333
Good. Mobile Command is fully operational.

542
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:53,962
- We'll be there in approximately two hours.
- I'm not armed, sir.

543
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:56,673
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

544
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:01,052
I left it in my, uh, my sock drawer.

545
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:04,055
A gun?

546
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,809
For what?
You're a chemical freak.

547
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:12,397
No, I'm a chemical super-freak, actually. 
But I still need a gun.

548
00:39:13,398 --> 00:39:15,650
Give him a goddam gun.

549
00:39:17,652 --> 00:39:20,780
Have you fired one of those things since the Academy?

550
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:24,951
<i>If you're going to San Francisco</i> 

551
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:27,704
<i>Don't forget to wear flowers in your hair</i>

552
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:30,731
<i>If you're going</i>

553
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:34,303
<i>To San Francisco</i>

554
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:39,290
<i>You're sure to meet some gentle people there</i>

555
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:42,587
And you come for- 

556
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:47,390
<i>If you're going to San Francisco</i>

557
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:49,893
Uh, uh, room service?

558
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:54,481
Ah, listen. This is the penthouse.
Do you do snacks, drinks? Huh?

559
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:56,733
Hello!

560
00:39:56,858 --> 00:39:59,110
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

561
00:39:59,235 --> 00:40:00,538
Barber.

562
00:40:01,863 --> 00:40:03,242
Just clippers. No scissors.

563
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:05,743
No scissors?
You've got to be kidding me, no scissors!

564
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:08,119
I mean, did they tell Picasso,
"No brush"?

565
00:40:08,244 --> 00:40:10,038
With scissors, this man could kill you.

566
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:14,918
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer now, can I?

567
00:40:15,043 --> 00:40:18,087
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

568
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:24,427
Oh, who did this to you? This is just not right. 
In fact, it's nasty!

569
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:26,346
Well, it's a grunge thing.

570
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:28,598
Well, it's some kind of thing.

571
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:31,601
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp protein pack 
and maybe some color?

572
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:33,937
No.

573
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:37,899
Okay.
Not very nice, is he?

574
00:40:38,024 --> 00:40:39,943
No, he's not.

575
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:59,420
Hey, somebody ordered it.
Can't let it go to waste.

576
00:41:01,145 --> 00:41:02,482
Don't you ever stop eatin'?

577
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,384
Not when it's free.

578
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:08,221
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

579
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:10,924
The boss is watchin'. 
Come on, have- Try some of this lobster.

580
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:15,645
- Mm-hmm.
- My secretary here will settle the bill.

581
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:19,065
So what do you have in store for me, Womack, 
when this is over?

582
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,985
You'll get your life back, Mason.

583
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,946
But you could've given me my life back years ago.

584
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:33,830
- Why should I trust you now?
- You've got my word.

585
00:41:33,955 --> 00:41:37,083
Will you shake on it?

586
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:50,930
- Freeze, mister!
- Oh, man!

587
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:53,725
Help!

588
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,686
Drop the gun or I drop your boss.

589
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:59,981
You will not!

590
00:42:00,106 --> 00:42:01,941
Get!

591
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:04,652
- He's getting very heavy.
- Then pull him up.

592
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:12,035
Please don't!

593
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,912
Help! Shit!

594
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:17,749
Come on, have a scallop.
Come on, catch.

595
00:42:25,381 --> 00:42:28,050
You hoist him!

596
00:42:28,176 --> 00:42:30,136
Help! Help! Help!

597
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:32,388
- Where's Mason? Where is Mason?
- Help! Hang on!

598
00:42:32,513 --> 00:42:34,567
- Where's Mason?
- Mason's gone!

599
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:35,568
Gone?!

600
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:39,896
Clear.

601
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:42,774
Living room's clear!

602
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:46,152
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

603
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:49,113
All units, this is Caretaker. 
We have a Signal Six. He's in the hotel!

604
00:42:55,578 --> 00:42:57,291
Okay, I don't wanna know nothin'.

605
00:42:57,292 --> 00:42:59,892
I never saw you throw that gentleman off the balcony.

606
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:04,086
All I care about is, 
a-are you happy with your haircut?

607
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:06,589
Easy!

608
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:12,011
Watch it, you fuckhead,
you're gonna pull my arm out!

609
00:43:13,387 --> 00:43:15,765
Watch out!

610
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:22,438
Oh, no!

611
00:43:29,612 --> 00:43:31,614
Watch it!

612
00:43:35,326 --> 00:43:38,412
- Hey, watch it!
- He's over there!

613
00:43:54,428 --> 00:43:56,806
Hey!

614
00:43:57,014 --> 00:43:59,836
This is my Humvee. 
I don't want any dings, dents or scratches,

615
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,837
or I'll have your ass. Hey!

616
00:44:02,562 --> 00:44:04,146
Hey! Stop! Hey!

617
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,529
Hey, I was inside the bedroom with Jack Powell!

618
00:44:11,654 --> 00:44:13,322
Hey, call the guard! Go!

619
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,494
FBI.

620
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:30,881
Move!

621
00:44:38,681 --> 00:44:40,266
Whoa! Whoa!

622
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:43,894
Suspect is in a black Humvee,
heading west on California.

623
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,105
Speed approximately 70 miles per hour.

624
00:44:53,195 --> 00:44:56,782
Get out of the way!

625
00:44:58,868 --> 00:45:01,328
I want a net put on this son of a bitch, 
you hear me?

626
00:45:34,445 --> 00:45:37,364
This guy's hittin' every fuckin' thing in sight 
tryin' to block us!

627
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,364
I hope you're insured!

628
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:29,208
Oh, well, why not?

629
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:47,393
You're goin' down!

630
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:12,710
Hello?

631
00:47:12,835 --> 00:47:15,254
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

632
00:47:19,466 --> 00:47:23,012
Information?
San Francisco?

633
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:26,223
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G-

634
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:30,769
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?

635
00:47:33,814 --> 00:47:36,317
Hang on!

636
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:41,822
Holy shit!

637
00:47:51,707 --> 00:47:53,834
Whoa-oa!

638
00:47:55,544 --> 00:47:58,464
Oh, no!

639
00:48:02,426 --> 00:48:04,678
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

640
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:12,394
Oh, my baby!

641
00:48:16,231 --> 00:48:18,192
Oh, no!

642
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,500
Oh, no.

643
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:40,339
Oh, God!

644
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:43,092
Oh, God!

645
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:05,531
Hey, man, you just fucked up your Ferrari.

646
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:09,535
- Oh, no! Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

647
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,245
Neither is this!

648
00:49:15,374 --> 00:49:18,752
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?

649
00:49:18,877 --> 00:49:22,589
I'm gonna hunt him down! 
That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

650
00:49:24,324 --> 00:49:25,346
Chem weapons. Isherwood.

651
00:49:25,347 --> 00:49:28,747
Marvin, look up Wolfburg Federal Penitentiary.

652
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:30,931
The inmate is Mason, John.

653
00:49:31,056 --> 00:49:33,976
Hey, Stan, listen, 
I'm gettin' out of this government shithole.

654
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:36,937
I'm goin' over to Orkin to design roach motels. 
Cool, huh?

655
00:49:37,062 --> 00:49:38,591
Look, I just stole a kid's motorcycle.

656
00:49:38,592 --> 00:49:41,292
I'm not really feeling too good about it, okay? 
Wolfburg. Got it?

657
00:49:41,316 --> 00:49:45,737
Yeah, I got it. 
All right, Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

658
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:50,617
Go to February '76. 
Who was transferred to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

659
00:49:52,327 --> 00:49:54,496
This is weird.
They got medical records.

660
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:59,835
They got place of birth. Glasgow.
Uh, but they don't have a name.

661
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,670
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
They have next of kin.

662
00:50:01,795 --> 00:50:06,049
A Jade Angelou of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

663
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:27,487
Jade?

664
00:50:27,613 --> 00:50:31,283
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

665
00:50:36,663 --> 00:50:38,874
Were you afraid to come alone?

666
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,792
Yeah.

667
00:50:42,669 --> 00:50:45,839
- It's okay.
- I'll be over here if you need me.

668
00:50:45,964 --> 00:50:49,593
The last photograph I had of you, 
you were about ten.

669
00:50:49,718 --> 00:50:52,054
Yeah?

670
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:57,142
Well, I found a picture of you among my mom's things 
when she died.

671
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:03,607
Oh, yeah? Well, uh-
Why don't we take a walk?

672
00:51:03,732 --> 00:51:06,568
I got 'im.
Palace of Fine Arts.

673
00:51:06,693 --> 00:51:10,655
Your mother, uh- 
Yeah, well, sh-she was very special.

674
00:51:10,781 --> 00:51:13,241
Yeah, she was.

675
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:17,454
But I don't think that we should romanticize
what happened between you and her.

676
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:20,415
Meeting in a bar after a Led Zeppelin concert.

677
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,251
Head out, and I was the result.

678
00:51:23,377 --> 00:51:26,254
Well, I'd like to think it would've led somewhere 
if only-

679
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,508
If only what? 
Six federal marshals hadn't kicked down our door,

680
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:32,010
and dragged you back to prison?

681
00:51:33,345 --> 00:51:35,972
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

682
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:41,645
- So, they let you out?
- Yeah.

683
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,730
That's good.

684
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:48,360
What did you do?

685
00:51:48,485 --> 00:51:50,153
J-

686
00:51:53,323 --> 00:51:58,745
Jade, I don't have a great deal of time here.

687
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,581
But I'll be coming back.
And, uh-

688
00:52:01,706 --> 00:52:05,293
- Maybe we can...
- What? We can what?

689
00:52:06,878 --> 00:52:11,341
You know, you're almost the only evidence

690
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:13,885
that I exist.

691
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:15,846
But I don't know you.

692
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:18,014
That's what I want to change, eh?

693
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:27,065
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand times 
on the chance that we would meet.

694
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:30,026
Here we are, and I'm lost.

695
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:32,946
Well, I don't know 
how I'm supposed to be feeling either.

696
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:37,075
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

697
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,328
If you can believe that, then it's a start.

698
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:45,959
Okay.

699
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:59,347
Is this about you?

700
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:16,573
You broke out of prison again, didn't you? 
Why did you come to me?

701
00:53:16,698 --> 00:53:20,452
FBI, ma'am.
Your father's working with us.

702
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:22,537
He's helping us resolve a dangerous situation.

703
00:53:22,662 --> 00:53:25,040
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

704
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:28,084
Well, gee whiz, John, 
I guess we oughta get goin', huh?

705
00:53:28,209 --> 00:53:30,670
Whatever you say, Stanley.

706
00:53:36,926 --> 00:53:39,346
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

707
00:53:39,471 --> 00:53:42,641
What do you say we cut the chitchat, a-hole?

708
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:46,728
You almost got me killed twice.
And my jaw hurts like hell!

709
00:53:47,896 --> 00:53:50,148
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

710
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:52,651
If I had my way, 
you would be shipped back to Wolfburg in leg irons,

711
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:56,196
and caged like an animal 
for the rest of your natural fucking life!

712
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:57,739
You wrecked half the city!

713
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:04,954
Now, tell me about the tunnels.

714
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:10,335
If you know the system, 
it will take you wherever you need to go.

715
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,422
All right, there's an intake pipe here, below low tide. 
Is that our best access?

716
00:54:14,547 --> 00:54:16,925
Yes. That's exactly where I had come out.

717
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:20,470
Then beneath the cistern, 
there's a connection to the abandoned septic system.

718
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:22,263
How many feet is that?

719
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:25,517
Uh, 57 paces.

720
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:27,727
Where do we go from there?

721
00:54:30,563 --> 00:54:33,817
Where do we go from there?

722
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:36,403
That's a good question.

723
00:54:37,821 --> 00:54:41,199
- I have no idea.
- What?

724
00:54:41,324 --> 00:54:44,577
I mean, I'll know it when we're all inside.

725
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:48,123
No. You're not goddam goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

726
00:54:48,248 --> 00:54:52,460
I can't! My blueprint was in my head.

727
00:54:52,585 --> 00:54:55,880
I was underground for three days in the dark,

728
00:54:56,005 --> 00:54:58,591
just waiting for the tides to be right.

729
00:54:58,716 --> 00:55:02,137
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

730
00:55:02,262 --> 00:55:04,806
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

731
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:06,045
Wait a second.

732
00:55:06,246 --> 00:55:09,846
Now, this piece of work 
might be the only chance those people over there have.

733
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,856
If he's not going, 
then why the hell did we get him out of jail?

734
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:13,801
He's smart.

735
00:55:13,802 --> 00:55:16,402
I got him out to get you people in,
not go with you.

736
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:20,655
If it's the only way of getting the intelligence I need, 
then he goes.

737
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,490
He'll fuck with you.

738
00:55:22,615 --> 00:55:26,369
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

739
00:55:28,454 --> 00:55:30,456
Now, Womack...

740
00:55:30,582 --> 00:55:33,209
you're between the Rock and a hard case.

741
00:55:36,129 --> 00:55:38,756
How is your bowling arm?

742
00:55:40,383 --> 00:55:42,010
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal is to take out the launchers,

743
00:55:42,135 --> 00:55:44,596
then neutralize the V.X. chemical rounds.

744
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:47,066
Well, we know the poison's being kept in the prison morgue,

745
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:50,960
from the satellite thermal imaging which is right here; 
these colorized dots.

746
00:55:51,186 --> 00:55:53,498
Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?

747
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:55,399
No, sir, but I've studied them.

748
00:55:55,523 --> 00:55:58,943
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

749
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:01,696
Got a really neat layout over here of the chem round 
as well as the rocket,

750
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:04,657
- so let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

751
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,746
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

752
00:56:09,871 --> 00:56:13,166
The power of this chemical 
is way beyond anything you can imagine.

753
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:14,918
An ecological disaster, sir.

754
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:17,462
Plus the devices themselves are complicated.

755
00:56:17,587 --> 00:56:20,298
That's why you're coming with us.

756
00:56:23,259 --> 00:56:27,055
- I am?
- You're the expert. What's your problem?

757
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:31,851
You mean I'm going, going out there, under the water?

758
00:56:31,976 --> 00:56:34,187
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.

759
00:56:34,312 --> 00:56:36,522
Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.

760
00:56:36,648 --> 00:56:39,275
Have you ever been in a combat situation?

761
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,903
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?

762
00:56:42,028 --> 00:56:45,490
An incursion underwater to retake an impregnable fortress 
held by an elite team

763
00:56:45,615 --> 00:56:48,743
of U.S. Marines in possession of
81 hostages and 15 guided rockets,

764
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:51,913
armed with V.X. poisoned gas.

765
00:56:52,038 --> 00:56:55,792
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

766
00:57:02,298 --> 00:57:04,175
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

767
00:57:07,011 --> 00:57:09,514
You don't look too good.

768
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:12,266
In fact, you look like shit.

769
00:57:12,392 --> 00:57:15,645
My stomach's doing hula hoops around my ass.

770
00:57:17,063 --> 00:57:19,107
You all right?

771
00:57:19,232 --> 00:57:21,317
I mean, you gonna make it through this thing?

772
00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:23,486
I don't know.

773
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:25,988
I always expected something like this 
was going to happen,

774
00:57:26,114 --> 00:57:28,908
but nothing prepares you for it.

775
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:31,327
Now I'm- I'm responsible

776
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:33,371
for a whole city.

777
00:57:36,457 --> 00:57:38,167
Look, I know this isn't easy for you.

778
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:40,503
Remember you were trained
for this kind of a situation,

779
00:57:40,628 --> 00:57:42,630
and believe me, it'll come back to you.

780
00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:46,134
Besides, you got the best SEAL team in the country 
backing you up.

781
00:57:46,259 --> 00:57:49,971
Okay.
You're right.

782
00:57:50,096 --> 00:57:53,641
I- I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

783
00:57:53,766 --> 00:57:56,561
There's something else.

784
00:57:56,686 --> 00:58:00,189
It's terrible.
N- No, it's wonderful,

785
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:02,733
except it isn't.

786
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:06,112
My girlfriend's pregnant...

787
00:58:06,237 --> 00:58:10,074
and she's just flown in to see me.

788
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:12,910
You keep your mind 
on what you're going to be doing out there tonight.

789
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:14,898
And I'll send someone to pick up your girlfriend,

790
00:58:14,899 --> 00:58:16,899
and bring her here to the command center.

791
00:58:28,718 --> 00:58:32,471
- Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

792
00:58:32,597 --> 00:58:36,350
I'm at the White House with General Kramer.

793
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:40,354
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few problems 
with the account transfer.

794
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:43,941
- Don't tell me problems, tell me solutions.
- Now, we've spoken to the president,

795
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:46,402
and I know that you're well aware 
of his stance on terrorism.

796
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:49,041
- So what we'd like to do is-
- This isn't about terrorism.

797
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:51,342
This is about justice.

798
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:54,452
It's about reminding you people 
who found it politically convenient to forget.

799
00:58:54,577 --> 00:58:56,871
This is goin' nowhere, Frank.

800
00:58:56,996 --> 00:58:58,706
Well, then, let me tell you what is.

801
00:58:58,831 --> 00:59:01,292
Fifteen V.X. gas rockets into the heart of San Francisco.

802
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:03,669
You've got 17 hours to deliver the money.

803
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:06,464
Or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen.

804
00:59:11,636 --> 00:59:14,347
- What's the word from Mojave?
- General Peterson can give us

805
00:59:14,472 --> 00:59:17,516
no definite assurance on the thermite plasma.

806
00:59:17,642 --> 00:59:19,685
That is the word.

807
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,359
Green light to SEAL incursion.

808
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,964
Fall in!
All right, listen up.

809
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:50,174
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

810
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:52,259
Lieutenant Shepard will be attached to his hip.

811
00:59:52,385 --> 00:59:56,347
You breathe, he breathes with you. 
You piss, he helps.

812
00:59:56,472 --> 00:59:58,307
Understood?

813
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:00,810
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.

814
01:00:00,935 --> 01:00:05,690
When he neutralizes the threat, 
we launch green flares and we wait for the cavalry.

815
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:09,819
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're in the fight of our lives

816
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:12,863
against maybe the greatest battalion commander 
in the Vietnam War.

817
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:15,157
I shit you not.

818
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:17,159
Any questions?

819
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:20,913
Let's load up!

820
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,507
After you, ace.

821
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:55,406
Pass out and activate the minicams.

822
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,704
Everything set here?
Minicams operational?

823
01:01:02,997 --> 01:01:05,291
Roger that, sir.
We are on-line.

824
01:01:09,086 --> 01:01:14,049
Shep, what's the status 
on the special operational gear for Mr. Mason?

825
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:19,305
Uh, let's see.
We have, uh,

826
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,183
one quart of kerosene in a squeeze bottle.

827
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:30,065
Three washers and waterproof matches.

828
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:33,486
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

829
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:35,946
Now, this is atropine. 
If you come in contact with the gas,

830
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:38,240
you have 20 seconds to inject it into your heart.

831
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:41,660
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

832
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:48,334
I have three incoming bogeys bearing 275.

833
01:01:48,459 --> 01:01:50,836
Range: 6,000 meters.

834
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:57,259
FBI Command Center?

835
01:01:57,384 --> 01:01:59,912
Oh, I would just love for you to tell me 
what is goin' on.

836
01:01:59,913 --> 01:02:00,613
Nope.

837
01:02:00,638 --> 01:02:03,807
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend. 
Actually, he's, um, my fiancé.

838
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:06,310
- Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

839
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:09,438
Okay. Well, you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

840
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:11,690
Hey, where are you g-
Goddam it!

841
01:02:16,779 --> 01:02:19,323
Decoy choppers commencing run to Alcatraz.

842
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:23,244
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

843
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:25,731
We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.

844
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:26,932
Shit!

845
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:40,552
In my day, we did it all 
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

846
01:02:40,678 --> 01:02:44,014
- Your day?
- Yes. Didn't you read my résumé?

847
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:47,142
I don't-
I don't know anything about you.

848
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:49,687
- Hmm. I know something about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

849
01:02:49,812 --> 01:02:53,440
Goodspeed, Godspeed, Godspell...

850
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:56,235
you never went to any antiterrorist school.

851
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,238
So just make sure you don't get us all fucking killed.

852
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:05,369
- We're goin' dark.
- Night vision!

853
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:09,248
Raider One has dropped below radar coverage,

854
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:11,250
heading around Treasure Island.

855
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:16,422
Sir, we've got two bogeys 
bearing due east and closing.

856
01:03:21,844 --> 01:03:23,220
Decoys?

857
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:26,265
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

858
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:33,313
Sir, Raider One is at the drop zone.

859
01:03:35,733 --> 01:03:38,819
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

860
01:03:40,446 --> 01:03:42,406
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

861
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:46,243
- Good to go!
- Good to go! Good to go!

862
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:58,464
All right, so the S.D.U.s have been deployed, 
and the Eagles are in the water.

863
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:10,684
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

864
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:12,936
- Double-time it.
- Yes, sir. Hendrix!

865
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:15,022
- You lead the patrol.
- Aye, aye, sir.

866
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:17,149
Let's move. Move out!
Move out! Move out!

867
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:17,584
The Eagles are on the Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

868
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,093
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.

869
01:05:26,168 --> 01:05:28,362
You've led us into a room with no exit.

870
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:35,244
- Any ideas, Dillinger?
- Figure it out soon. We're sitting ducks.

871
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:36,912
We're a little tight on time.

872
01:05:37,037 --> 01:05:40,290
You stand by the door until I open it.

873
01:05:40,415 --> 01:05:43,585
I'd like to know how you plan on accomplishing that?

874
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,880
Through here.

875
01:05:53,053 --> 01:05:56,598
- You're shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.

876
01:05:56,723 --> 01:05:58,600
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

877
01:05:58,725 --> 01:06:01,645
You catch one of those flame bursts, 
you're a corpse.

878
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,982
Thank you.

879
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:05,083
Commander, you said never to leave his sight, 
but, uh-

880
01:06:05,107 --> 01:06:07,109
Stand fast, Lieutenant.

881
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:10,070
Have a nice day.

882
01:06:32,509 --> 01:06:36,263
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

883
01:06:43,604 --> 01:06:46,481
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

884
01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:50,319
- Nothing.
- Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

885
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:52,696
Sweep forward!

886
01:07:01,705 --> 01:07:04,291
Looks like he fucked us, Commander.

887
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:07,502
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

888
01:07:13,008 --> 01:07:14,885
Welcome to the Rock.

889
01:07:30,108 --> 01:07:32,486
- Mason.
- That's a no-no.

890
01:07:32,611 --> 01:07:36,323
That's the subway. 
That'll drop you into the tunnels.

891
01:07:36,448 --> 01:07:38,575
Do it!

892
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:58,553
Sir, the Eagles have breached the tunnel system.

893
01:08:04,935 --> 01:08:07,479
You enjoying this?

894
01:08:07,604 --> 01:08:10,649
Well, it's certainly more enjoyable 
than my average day.

895
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:15,153
Reading philosophy, 
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

896
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:19,199
Though it's less of a problem these days. 
Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

897
01:08:23,745 --> 01:08:26,957
We've got seismic activity in one of the storm grates. 
North side.

898
01:08:27,082 --> 01:08:29,835
Continue patrolling the area.

899
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,795
Sweep forward!

900
01:08:33,213 --> 01:08:35,006
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

901
01:08:37,342 --> 01:08:40,053
- They're hearing sounds above, sir.
- Stand fast.

902
01:08:40,178 --> 01:08:42,931
Down, down, down.

903
01:08:48,228 --> 01:08:50,814
West storm drain's clear.

904
01:08:55,193 --> 01:08:58,905
Ninety-seven paces to the shower room.

905
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:06,413
The Eagles are now at the access tunnel.
They're right under the shower room, sir.

906
01:09:14,254 --> 01:09:16,339
Fiber optics.

907
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:22,596
- Something's not right.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

908
01:09:42,157 --> 01:09:44,075
Quiet.

909
01:09:53,835 --> 01:09:55,838
Motion sensors.

910
01:09:56,963 --> 01:10:00,967
- Beams cutting across the manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

911
01:10:05,305 --> 01:10:09,225
Commander, the beam is hitting 
some sort of reflective device.

912
01:10:09,351 --> 01:10:12,145
Possibly a prism.

913
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:17,651
I want to use a mirror to cut the beam,

914
01:10:17,776 --> 01:10:22,072
send the beam back to its source
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

915
01:10:26,534 --> 01:10:28,995
We've got motion on a trembler in the shower room, sir.

916
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,247
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

917
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:37,837
Got it.
Good to go.

918
01:10:37,962 --> 01:10:42,175
- Fuck, man! I knew this would happen! Fuck!
- Move!

919
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,427
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

920
01:10:55,605 --> 01:10:59,067
They're entering into the shower room, sir.

921
01:11:01,653 --> 01:11:04,239
They're securing the area.

922
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:15,417
Just sit tight.

923
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:20,964
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

924
01:11:21,089 --> 01:11:23,258
- Stand fast!
- Hold your fire!

925
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:25,427
- Drop your weapons!
- Hold your fire!

926
01:11:28,388 --> 01:11:31,975
It's a fucking trap.

927
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,768
This is General Hummel.

928
01:11:33,893 --> 01:11:37,564
Drop your weapons.
Drop 'em!

929
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:40,650
Anderson here, General Hummel.

930
01:11:40,775 --> 01:11:43,319
Commander. Team leader.

931
01:11:43,445 --> 01:11:46,406
Commander Anderson, 
if you have any concern for the lives of your men,

932
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:49,534
you will order them to safety their weapons 
and place them on the deck.

933
01:11:49,659 --> 01:11:51,494
This is not happening.

934
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:55,039
Sir, we know why you're out here.

935
01:11:55,165 --> 01:11:57,458
God knows I agree with you.

936
01:11:57,584 --> 01:12:00,795
But like you, 
I swore to defend this country against all enemies,

937
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:05,967
foreign, sir, and domestic.

938
01:12:06,092 --> 01:12:09,596
General, we've spilled the same blood in the same mud.

939
01:12:09,721 --> 01:12:12,348
You know goddam well I can't give that order.

940
01:12:12,473 --> 01:12:14,184
We're dead.

941
01:12:14,309 --> 01:12:17,770
Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander.

942
01:12:17,896 --> 01:12:21,649
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't do anything stupid.

943
01:12:21,774 --> 01:12:24,152
No one has to die here.

944
01:12:24,277 --> 01:12:28,656
Men following the general, 
you're under oath as United States Marines!

945
01:12:28,781 --> 01:12:31,784
Have you forgotten that?

946
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:33,995
We all have shipmates we remember.

947
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:37,457
Some of them were shit on and pissed on by the Pentagon.

948
01:12:37,582 --> 01:12:39,928
But that doesn't give you the right to mutiny!

949
01:12:39,929 --> 01:12:40,929
You call it what you want!

950
01:12:41,753 --> 01:12:43,673
You're down there, we're up here.

951
01:12:43,674 --> 01:12:45,674
You walked into the wrong goddam room, Commander!

952
01:12:45,798 --> 01:12:47,759
- Stand fast!
- Goddam it, Commander, one last time.

953
01:12:47,884 --> 01:12:50,011
You tell your men to safety their weapons, 
drop 'em on the deck.

954
01:12:50,136 --> 01:12:52,680
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

955
01:12:52,805 --> 01:12:55,600
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

956
01:12:55,725 --> 01:12:58,478
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

957
01:12:58,603 --> 01:12:59,523
Let's waste these fuckers.

958
01:12:59,524 --> 01:13:02,024
One last time.
You order your men to safety their weapons-

959
01:13:09,572 --> 01:13:11,574
Cease fire!

960
01:13:30,718 --> 01:13:33,262
Don't go.

961
01:13:35,223 --> 01:13:37,100
Cease fire!

962
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:47,902
Cease fire!

963
01:13:48,027 --> 01:13:50,154
Shit! Goddam it!

964
01:13:50,279 --> 01:13:52,615
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

965
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,826
Don't. Don't go.

966
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,877
It's over.

967
01:14:55,803 --> 01:14:57,763
Oh, God!

968
01:15:16,866 --> 01:15:18,868
Mason.

969
01:15:29,337 --> 01:15:30,456
We got some movement.

970
01:15:30,557 --> 01:15:31,857
- Who?
- Two of 'em!

971
01:15:31,881 --> 01:15:33,549
- Who is it?
- Eagles 11 and 12.

972
01:15:33,674 --> 01:15:36,385
- I-It's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

973
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:39,055
I've gotta get a team together right now.
We've gotta move with the second option.

974
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:41,557
What, and invite another massacre? 
No way.

975
01:15:41,682 --> 01:15:46,395
We've got a 60-year-old convict and a lab rat. 
I'm telling you, it's over.

976
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,606
Not for Mason, it isn't.

977
01:16:00,534 --> 01:16:04,163
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

978
01:16:06,707 --> 01:16:09,502
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

979
01:16:09,627 --> 01:16:12,254
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

980
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:16,008
Goodspeed.
Goodspeed, do you read me?

981
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:17,802
It's for you.

982
01:16:19,345 --> 01:16:21,597
- Sir?
- What's the status?

983
01:16:21,722 --> 01:16:24,475
The status is they're dead.
They're dead!

984
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,602
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

985
01:16:26,727 --> 01:16:31,023
That is unacceptable.
Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

986
01:16:31,148 --> 01:16:33,734
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

987
01:16:33,859 --> 01:16:36,946
What do you have, a fuckin' water pistol?

988
01:16:37,071 --> 01:16:39,740
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

989
01:16:41,826 --> 01:16:44,078
I didn't want this.

990
01:16:44,203 --> 01:16:46,789
- Jesus, I didn't want this.
- You knew this might happen, Frank.

991
01:16:46,914 --> 01:16:50,001
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

992
01:16:50,126 --> 01:16:52,628
Then maybe we need to execute a few hostages.

993
01:16:52,753 --> 01:16:55,965
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

994
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:59,635
- You heard him. End it!
- Holster that sidearm, Captain.

995
01:17:18,154 --> 01:17:19,989
Sir?

996
01:17:23,492 --> 01:17:25,911
You made a terrible mistake.

997
01:17:26,036 --> 01:17:29,248
And more of our brothers have died in vain.

998
01:17:29,373 --> 01:17:32,460
Damn you for forcing me into this position.

999
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:38,507
I need to talk to you right now, alone.

1000
01:17:38,632 --> 01:17:41,051
Now you told me I'm on a need-to-know basis.

1001
01:17:41,177 --> 01:17:42,332
And I'm tellin' you right now,

1002
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:46,433
I need to know 
who the fuck John Mason is right now, sir.

1003
01:17:46,557 --> 01:17:50,644
All right, you wanna know?
1962, J. Edgar Hoover

1004
01:17:50,769 --> 01:17:53,522
is head of the FBI, some say the country.

1005
01:17:53,647 --> 01:17:57,526
It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

1006
01:17:57,651 --> 01:18:01,197
de Gaulle, British members of Parliament, 
even the Prime Minister.

1007
01:18:01,322 --> 01:18:04,408
I mean, this guy had dirt on everybody in the world.

1008
01:18:04,533 --> 01:18:08,120
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger stories. 
Where does Mason fit in?

1009
01:18:08,245 --> 01:18:10,956
Mason was the British operative who stole the files.

1010
01:18:11,081 --> 01:18:13,834
But our Bureau agents caught him at the Canadian border.

1011
01:18:13,959 --> 01:18:17,254
Of course, the British claimed they'd never heard of him.

1012
01:18:17,379 --> 01:18:19,298
And we held him without trial

1013
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:23,761
until he gave up the microfilm,
but he never did.

1014
01:18:23,886 --> 01:18:26,597
Well, I'm surprised Hoover
didn't use his daughter as leverage.

1015
01:18:26,722 --> 01:18:29,975
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

1016
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:33,687
Today, well, it's a different Bureau.

1017
01:18:33,812 --> 01:18:38,067
So you held this guy without trial his whole life! 
No wonder he's pissed.

1018
01:18:38,192 --> 01:18:42,571
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half century:

1019
01:18:42,696 --> 01:18:46,909
the alien landing at Roswell, 
the truth about the J.F.K. assassination.

1020
01:18:47,034 --> 01:18:50,788
And Mason's angry, he's lethal,
he's a trained killer.

1021
01:18:52,498 --> 01:18:56,460
And he is the only hope that we have got.

1022
01:18:56,794 --> 01:18:59,505
Mason! Mason!

1023
01:19:01,674 --> 01:19:04,093
There are 81 hostages still up there.

1024
01:19:04,218 --> 01:19:05,970
Yeah, like me.

1025
01:19:06,095 --> 01:19:08,722
All right, you wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

1026
01:19:08,847 --> 01:19:11,600
Okay. FBI!
Freeze, sucker!

1027
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:17,898
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

1028
01:19:18,023 --> 01:19:21,610
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

1029
01:19:21,735 --> 01:19:24,488
Let's find out.

1030
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:30,828
I could; you, no.

1031
01:19:30,953 --> 01:19:33,372
Besides, your safety's on.

1032
01:19:33,497 --> 01:19:37,084
Goodspeed, have you resolved the situation?

1033
01:19:39,545 --> 01:19:42,131
Not yet.

1034
01:19:42,256 --> 01:19:45,634
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

1035
01:19:45,759 --> 01:19:48,262
You're right, 
I don't use guns and I don't kick down doors.

1036
01:19:48,387 --> 01:19:51,098
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

1037
01:19:51,223 --> 01:19:55,519
What it says is Chemical Weapons Specialist.

1038
01:19:55,644 --> 01:19:59,523
That's right.
I got a lunatic up there, man,

1039
01:19:59,648 --> 01:20:03,193
with 15 missiles armed with some really funky stuff.

1040
01:20:03,318 --> 01:20:08,115
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

1041
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:12,703
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

1042
01:20:12,828 --> 01:20:15,998
They've got my girlfriend in the city 
with a baby on the way.

1043
01:20:16,123 --> 01:20:20,210
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

1044
01:20:20,335 --> 01:20:22,337
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

1045
01:20:31,138 --> 01:20:33,515
Sir, this man's weapons and tack radio are missing!

1046
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,311
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

1047
01:20:37,436 --> 01:20:40,230
There's probably a maze of tunnels on this island. 
Check every access you can find.

1048
01:20:40,355 --> 01:20:41,399
Sir.

1049
01:20:48,155 --> 01:20:50,824
Even if you escape from the island,

1050
01:20:50,949 --> 01:20:54,161
you can't escape the rockets.

1051
01:20:54,286 --> 01:20:57,915
So, where are you gonna go? Go where?
What are, what are you gonna do?

1052
01:21:01,919 --> 01:21:05,047
- Show me where the morgue is, Mason.
- I'm out of here.

1053
01:21:08,509 --> 01:21:11,136
What about your daughter?
Mason?

1054
01:21:13,388 --> 01:21:15,891
Rodents located.

1055
01:21:16,016 --> 01:21:20,229
The way I see it, 
you don't really have any choice, do you?

1056
01:21:20,354 --> 01:21:22,689
I don't think you do.

1057
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,827
Move!

1058
01:22:00,394 --> 01:22:01,979
They're onto us.

1059
01:22:02,104 --> 01:22:04,314
Burn 'em out.

1060
01:22:06,566 --> 01:22:08,777
This mother's gonna blow big.

1061
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:53,947
I don't understand. 
How could we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

1062
01:22:54,072 --> 01:22:56,575
We've lost comms.
Still got 'em on locaters.

1063
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:08,378
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

1064
01:23:08,503 --> 01:23:11,673
How do you like your choices?

1065
01:23:11,798 --> 01:23:14,885
- I don't.
- That's what I thought.

1066
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:18,096
All right, come on.

1067
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:21,641
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.

1068
01:23:21,767 --> 01:23:24,561
Did you know it was originally a Civil War fort?

1069
01:23:24,686 --> 01:23:27,606
Oh, really? Huh. Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too,

1070
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:31,026
maybe when this is all over, 
you and I can stop by the souvenir shop together.

1071
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:35,322
But right now I just- I just-
I wanna find some rockets.

1072
01:23:36,948 --> 01:23:41,495
Don't tempt me.
We are going to the morgue.

1073
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:09,022
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

1074
01:24:09,147 --> 01:24:10,774
Your best?

1075
01:24:10,899 --> 01:24:14,736
Losers always whine about their best.

1076
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:17,739
Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.

1077
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:21,117
Carla was the prom queen.

1078
01:24:21,243 --> 01:24:24,621
- Really?
- Yeah.

1079
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:29,417
Locaters have them approaching the morgue, sir.

1080
01:24:29,543 --> 01:24:32,003
Come on, come on.
You can do it, Doc.

1081
01:24:39,844 --> 01:24:42,389
You must never hesitate.

1082
01:25:05,412 --> 01:25:08,623
I think you're shooting too close to the rocket.

1083
01:25:08,748 --> 01:25:10,625
Him, but not the rocket.

1084
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,961
Any other news, Professor?

1085
01:25:15,714 --> 01:25:18,466
Not the rocket!
Not the rocket.

1086
01:25:32,897 --> 01:25:35,275
I got a little somethin' for ya.

1087
01:25:58,548 --> 01:26:02,719
Oh, yeah, okay. 
That's just about the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1088
01:26:04,512 --> 01:26:06,431
Mason,

1089
01:26:08,475 --> 01:26:11,102
the second you don't respect this, 
it kills you.

1090
01:26:11,227 --> 01:26:13,271
Put it over there.

1091
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:26,534
You've been around a lot of corpses. 
Is that normal?

1092
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:30,330
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1093
01:26:30,355 --> 01:26:31,374
Yeah, that happens.

1094
01:26:31,475 --> 01:26:33,375
Well, I'm having kind of a hard time concentrating.

1095
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:37,420
- Can you do something about it?
- Well, like what? Kill him again?

1096
01:26:37,545 --> 01:26:40,423
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1097
01:26:40,548 --> 01:26:44,594
And most of the time I work in a glass jar 
and lead a very uneventful life.

1098
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:48,890
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here,

1099
01:26:49,015 --> 01:26:51,643
is one of the most deadly substances
the Earth has ever known.

1100
01:26:51,768 --> 01:26:54,395
So what do you say you cut me some friggin' slack?

1101
01:27:10,829 --> 01:27:12,747
A really elegant string-of-pearls configuration.

1102
01:27:12,872 --> 01:27:15,542
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

1103
01:27:15,667 --> 01:27:17,752
Well, what exactly does this stuff do?

1104
01:27:17,877 --> 01:27:20,922
If the rocket renders it aerosol, 
it can take out the entire city of people.

1105
01:27:22,549 --> 01:27:26,928
Really? And what happens if you drop one?

1106
01:27:27,053 --> 01:27:30,431
Happily, it'll just wipe out you and me.

1107
01:27:30,557 --> 01:27:32,934
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1108
01:27:33,059 --> 01:27:36,271
Stops the brain from sending nerve messages 
down the spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1109
01:27:36,396 --> 01:27:39,440
Any epidermal exposure or inhalation, 
and you'll know.

1110
01:27:39,566 --> 01:27:44,070
A twinge at the small of your back 
as the poison seizes your nervous system.

1111
01:27:44,195 --> 01:27:45,989
Do not move that!

1112
01:27:49,033 --> 01:27:51,661
Your muscles freeze, you can't breathe.

1113
01:27:51,786 --> 01:27:54,998
You spasm so hard you break your own back, 
spit your guts out.

1114
01:27:55,123 --> 01:27:57,875
But that's after your skin melts off.

1115
01:27:58,001 --> 01:28:00,336
My God.

1116
01:28:00,461 --> 01:28:03,590
Oh, I think we'd like God on our side at the moment, 
don't you?

1117
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,137
So what I'm doing now
is removing the guidance system chips,

1118
01:28:09,262 --> 01:28:11,222
so the rocket will splash down after 500 feet.

1119
01:28:11,347 --> 01:28:13,433
All right, let me have that.

1120
01:28:13,558 --> 01:28:17,604
You can let go of it. 
All right, just back away. Just back away!

1121
01:28:17,729 --> 01:28:20,815
Sir, morgue team has not checked in.

1122
01:28:23,693 --> 01:28:25,361
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird. 
Over.

1123
01:28:27,572 --> 01:28:30,491
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddam it!

1124
01:28:32,785 --> 01:28:36,289
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

1125
01:28:36,414 --> 01:28:38,666
Rats alive! Close on the morgue.
Close on the morgue.

1126
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:41,669
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1127
01:28:41,794 --> 01:28:44,088
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

1128
01:28:47,717 --> 01:28:49,677
Hold it.

1129
01:28:49,802 --> 01:28:52,347
Converge on the morgue.
Move out.

1130
01:28:53,765 --> 01:28:56,267
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

1131
01:28:56,392 --> 01:28:59,645
Good. I love pressure.
I eat it for breakfast.

1132
01:28:59,771 --> 01:29:01,439
Come on. Time's up.

1133
01:29:01,564 --> 01:29:03,649
There's three rockets somewhere else. 
We have to find them.

1134
01:29:07,153 --> 01:29:07,904
Come on!

1135
01:29:28,174 --> 01:29:30,385
Clear!

1136
01:29:31,636 --> 01:29:33,471
I'm too old for this.

1137
01:29:33,596 --> 01:29:37,266
- Where's it go?
- I've no idea.

1138
01:29:37,392 --> 01:29:40,728
Sir, all the guidance chips are gone.

1139
01:29:40,853 --> 01:29:42,939
Captain, I guess you didn't quite take care 
of the rat problem.

1140
01:29:43,064 --> 01:29:43,866
No, sir.

1141
01:29:43,991 --> 01:29:47,153
Well, there are two dead men here 
who strongly suggest you go finish the job.

1142
01:29:47,154 --> 01:29:48,254
Yes, sir.

1143
01:29:48,778 --> 01:29:51,781
Yes, sir!
Rio, Royce, let's go!

1144
01:29:51,906 --> 01:29:53,908
Move out!

1145
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:02,125
- You really don't know where this goes?
- No, I don't know where it goes.

1146
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,460
Well, it's starting to pick up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

1147
01:30:04,585 --> 01:30:06,587
No, I don't.

1148
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,009
God.

1149
01:30:45,084 --> 01:30:47,795
Mason, you all right?

1150
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,590
Yes, perfectly okay, you fucking idiot!

1151
01:30:53,092 --> 01:30:55,511
- They're coming.
- Who?

1152
01:30:55,636 --> 01:30:58,472
- The Marines!
- Where?

1153
01:32:00,534 --> 01:32:03,829
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

1154
01:32:09,835 --> 01:32:12,797
No! No! No!

1155
01:32:27,353 --> 01:32:29,397
Mason!

1156
01:32:32,483 --> 01:32:34,360
Mason!

1157
01:33:49,768 --> 01:33:55,107
You motherfucker!
Die! Die! Die!

1158
01:34:15,294 --> 01:34:19,006
I'm rather glad you didn't hesitate too long.

1159
01:34:22,635 --> 01:34:25,804
How do you do it?

1160
01:34:27,681 --> 01:34:31,727
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British Intelligence.

1161
01:34:33,979 --> 01:34:35,814
Come on.

1162
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:40,235
But in retrospect, 
I'd rather have been a poet or a farmer.

1163
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:41,945
Okay.

1164
01:34:46,283 --> 01:34:49,370
Okay, the president arrives in three hours.

1165
01:34:49,495 --> 01:34:54,375
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1166
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,753
- What's the word from Mojave, General?
- The same as last time, Lou.

1167
01:34:57,878 --> 01:35:00,547
They're going as fast as they can.

1168
01:35:05,386 --> 01:35:09,431
- Do it over here.
- On your knees. On your knees!

1169
01:35:19,525 --> 01:35:22,695
Navy SEALs, listen up. 
You've got something that belongs to me.

1170
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:25,239
Twelve guidance chips, to be precise.

1171
01:35:25,364 --> 01:35:29,993
Let me remind you there are lives at stake, 
civilian lives.

1172
01:35:30,119 --> 01:35:32,079
Speak up.

1173
01:35:32,204 --> 01:35:36,166
- Speak up!
- I, uh, uh-

1174
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:39,086
- Tell them your name.
- My name is Larry Henderson.

1175
01:35:39,211 --> 01:35:43,298
- Oh, man.
- And I'm a father of three.

1176
01:35:43,424 --> 01:35:46,718
And, uh, they've got a gun to my head.

1177
01:35:46,844 --> 01:35:50,597
You've got exactly three minutes 
to return the guidance chips to the exercise yard,

1178
01:35:50,722 --> 01:35:53,434
- or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.
- Oh, no.

1179
01:35:54,685 --> 01:35:57,229
Hey. Wha-

1180
01:35:57,354 --> 01:35:59,606
Now, three to go.

1181
01:35:59,731 --> 01:36:02,776
You find them and defuse them, okay?

1182
01:36:04,027 --> 01:36:05,571
- All right.
- All right.

1183
01:36:05,696 --> 01:36:09,283
I'll try and delay Hummel and give you more time.

1184
01:36:09,408 --> 01:36:12,578
Hey, what about Mr. Henderson's head?

1185
01:36:15,247 --> 01:36:18,125
Okay?
What do you mean?

1186
01:36:23,839 --> 01:36:25,799
Okay.

1187
01:36:37,769 --> 01:36:41,273
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

1188
01:36:43,192 --> 01:36:45,485
I'm all that's left of the enemy.

1189
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:01,168
Bingo.

1190
01:37:10,302 --> 01:37:12,346
Stand easy.

1191
01:37:15,933 --> 01:37:19,019
Thought I'd been in the service a long time.

1192
01:37:19,144 --> 01:37:23,398
- Name and rank, sailor.
- Well, it's Army, actually.

1193
01:37:23,523 --> 01:37:28,862
Answer the question. 
And address him as "General, sir."

1194
01:37:28,987 --> 01:37:32,074
Captain John Patrick Mason, General, sir,

1195
01:37:32,199 --> 01:37:36,078
of Her Majesty's S.A.S. 
Retired, of course.

1196
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:43,585
You're a long way from home, Captain.

1197
01:37:43,710 --> 01:37:45,295
How the hell are you involved in this?

1198
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:47,839
Oh, I have a unique knowledge of this prison facility.

1199
01:37:47,965 --> 01:37:51,301
I was, uh, formerly a guest here.

1200
01:38:05,732 --> 01:38:07,818
Hi, sweetie.

1201
01:38:15,117 --> 01:38:17,119
Hey, come back here, little boy.

1202
01:38:18,995 --> 01:38:21,331
Did they bother to tell you who I am, 
why I'm doing this?

1203
01:38:21,456 --> 01:38:23,917
Or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

1204
01:38:24,042 --> 01:38:27,879
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

1205
01:38:28,004 --> 01:38:31,133
Then you wouldn't have any fuckin' idea 
what it means to lead some of the finest men on

1206
01:38:31,258 --> 01:38:34,594
God's earth into battle, 
and then see their memory betrayed by their own government.

1207
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:37,889
I don't quite see how you cherish the memory of the dead,

1208
01:38:38,014 --> 01:38:40,726
by killing another million.

1209
01:38:40,851 --> 01:38:43,937
And, uh, this is not combat.

1210
01:38:44,062 --> 01:38:48,316
It's an act of lunacy, General, sir.

1211
01:38:48,442 --> 01:38:51,111
Personally, I think you're a fuckin' idiot.

1212
01:38:57,284 --> 01:38:59,578
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed, 
from time to time,

1213
01:38:59,703 --> 01:39:03,248
with the blood of patriots and tyrants." 
Thomas Jefferson.

1214
01:39:03,373 --> 01:39:08,295
"Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious", 
according to Oscar Wilde.

1215
01:39:13,925 --> 01:39:17,971
- Thank you for making my point.
- Where are the guidance chips?

1216
01:39:18,096 --> 01:39:20,807
Where are the guidance chips?

1217
01:39:20,932 --> 01:39:25,020
- I destroyed them.
- That was a bad move, soldier.

1218
01:39:25,145 --> 01:39:27,147
Does that mean you'll execute us both?

1219
01:39:56,218 --> 01:39:58,762
You're lucky that old man Hummel wants you alive.

1220
01:39:58,887 --> 01:40:00,847
'Cause I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy.

1221
01:40:07,646 --> 01:40:11,566
I'd take pleasure in guttin' you...

1222
01:40:11,691 --> 01:40:13,235
Boy. 

1223
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,780
"I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy."

1224
01:40:18,448 --> 01:40:20,700
What is wrong with these people, huh, Mason?

1225
01:40:20,825 --> 01:40:24,496
Don't you think there's a lot of, uh, 
a lot of anger floatin' around this island?

1226
01:40:24,621 --> 01:40:27,791
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
Don't you think?

1227
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:31,878
A lot of angst, a lot of:
"I'm 16, I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1228
01:40:32,003 --> 01:40:34,256
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island,

1229
01:40:34,381 --> 01:40:37,592
with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure-seeking 
psychopathic Marines.

1230
01:40:37,717 --> 01:40:40,345
Shame on them!

1231
01:40:42,764 --> 01:40:46,351
Anyway, I only got one chem round. 
There's two left.

1232
01:40:46,476 --> 01:40:50,355
- Mason?
- Yes, I'm here.

1233
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,983
I was just thinking how wonderful it was,

1234
01:40:53,108 --> 01:40:55,443
when the inmates weren't allowed to talk in here.

1235
01:40:55,568 --> 01:40:58,238
Not allowed to talk.

1236
01:40:58,363 --> 01:41:00,490
How'd you do it?

1237
01:41:00,615 --> 01:41:06,204
Uh, nurtured the hope that there was hope.

1238
01:41:06,329 --> 01:41:08,915
That one day I'd breathe free air.

1239
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,377
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1240
01:41:12,502 --> 01:41:17,340
Modest hopes, but, uh, they kept a man alive.

1241
01:41:17,465 --> 01:41:20,593
What'd they put you away for, John?

1242
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:23,680
Oh, that's a long story.

1243
01:41:23,805 --> 01:41:26,683
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.

1244
01:41:26,808 --> 01:41:29,853
When was the last communication from our men on Alcatraz?

1245
01:41:29,978 --> 01:41:31,604
Seven hours.

1246
01:41:34,232 --> 01:41:36,443
Thermite plasma is operational.

1247
01:41:36,568 --> 01:41:39,779
- Get me the president.
- Be seated.

1248
01:41:39,904 --> 01:41:43,992
Gentlemen, consider yourselves on ground alert. 
If we receive launch authority,

1249
01:41:44,117 --> 01:41:47,787
your mission is the complete thermal destruction 
of Alcatraz Island.

1250
01:41:47,912 --> 01:41:51,332
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

1251
01:41:51,458 --> 01:41:54,252
Eighty-one American civilians
and a number of U.S. Marines

1252
01:41:54,377 --> 01:41:56,671
will lose their lives in this air strike.

1253
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:01,134
Why didn't you just tell them where the microfilm was

1254
01:42:01,259 --> 01:42:04,095
and, and create a solution?

1255
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:08,808
Hmph. The moment they had the microfilm, 
they'd suicide me.

1256
01:42:08,933 --> 01:42:12,896
- Some solution.
- And you ended up here.

1257
01:42:13,021 --> 01:42:17,233
Which brings me to another question. 
When you broke out-

1258
01:42:17,358 --> 01:42:21,863
Let me see if I can get this straight.
You went down the incinerator chute,

1259
01:42:21,988 --> 01:42:26,367
on the mine cars, 
through the tunnels to the power plant,

1260
01:42:26,493 --> 01:42:30,330
under the steam engine- 
That was really cool, by the way.

1261
01:42:30,455 --> 01:42:32,999
And into the cistern through the intake pipe.

1262
01:42:33,124 --> 01:42:38,588
But how, in the name of Zeus's butthole,

1263
01:42:38,713 --> 01:42:41,508
did you get out of your cell?

1264
01:42:41,633 --> 01:42:44,344
I only ask because in our current situation,

1265
01:42:44,469 --> 01:42:49,682
well, it could prove to be useful information, maybe!

1266
01:43:07,992 --> 01:43:11,037
Trade secrets, my son.

1267
01:43:12,121 --> 01:43:13,414
Wow.

1268
01:43:13,706 --> 01:43:16,042
General, two operational rockets left.

1269
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:17,877
One's at the lower lighthouse
and there is one on the roof.

1270
01:43:18,002 --> 01:43:21,005
And both of the birds are ready to fly, sir.

1271
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:24,384
- G-General, can you hear me?
- I heard you, Captain.

1272
01:43:24,509 --> 01:43:27,053
Oh, just makin' sure.

1273
01:43:27,178 --> 01:43:31,724
Should we prepare for launch, General?

1274
01:43:31,849 --> 01:43:33,893
I'll handle the strategy, Captain.

1275
01:43:34,018 --> 01:43:36,563
Yes, sir.

1276
01:43:37,689 --> 01:43:41,567
The hour is approaching, sir. 
Just letting the general know of the time, sir.

1277
01:43:41,693 --> 01:43:45,530
- I'm very aware of the time, Captain.
- Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

1278
01:43:45,655 --> 01:43:48,283
Me and my boys are ready to cock, lock, 
and ready to rock.

1279
01:43:50,785 --> 01:43:52,662
Mason, where're you going?

1280
01:43:52,787 --> 01:43:55,290
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1281
01:43:55,415 --> 01:44:00,795
You're not leaving! 
There's a madman in there with his hand on a, on a button!

1282
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:04,090
Shh. Some sniper's gonna get his ass.

1283
01:44:05,299 --> 01:44:08,302
Stop moving, Mason.

1284
01:44:08,428 --> 01:44:10,930
Mason, stop moving.

1285
01:44:11,055 --> 01:44:14,684
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1286
01:44:14,809 --> 01:44:18,312
- I read it in his eyes.
- You read his eyes?

1287
01:44:18,438 --> 01:44:20,732
Oh, well, then, everything's just fine!

1288
01:44:20,857 --> 01:44:23,359
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

1289
01:44:24,819 --> 01:44:27,905
Three minutes to go, sir.

1290
01:44:28,031 --> 01:44:31,242
- They're not gonna call, Frank.
- Oh, they'll call.

1291
01:44:31,367 --> 01:44:34,370
They'll call if we fire 
one of our rockets up their ass.

1292
01:44:34,495 --> 01:44:37,498
Sir.

1293
01:44:42,462 --> 01:44:45,089
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank. It's Al Kramer here.

1294
01:44:45,214 --> 01:44:47,542
- How's it going out there?
- How do you think it's goin'?

1295
01:44:47,767 --> 01:44:51,095
- Listen, we're gonna need another hour.
- You've got three minutes.

1296
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:54,140
Listen, uh, Frank, 
we have to get final authorization from the president.

1297
01:44:54,265 --> 01:44:56,350
You've got three minutes.

1298
01:44:56,476 --> 01:44:58,728
Frank, please don't do anything stupid.

1299
01:45:01,314 --> 01:45:03,316
They want another hour.

1300
01:45:03,441 --> 01:45:06,736
Well, that's bullshit.
That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

1301
01:45:06,861 --> 01:45:08,905
They're calling our bluff, sir.

1302
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:12,867
They're playing you for a fool, sir.

1303
01:45:12,992 --> 01:45:16,204
Order the launch, General.

1304
01:45:16,329 --> 01:45:19,874
Come on, General.
Let's be all we can be.

1305
01:45:34,263 --> 01:45:36,349
The mission's not complete!

1306
01:45:36,474 --> 01:45:38,351
Well, mine is.

1307
01:45:38,476 --> 01:45:41,229
When this is over, you'll go back home,

1308
01:45:41,354 --> 01:45:46,359
driving Carla and your baby insane 
in your beige Volvo.

1309
01:45:46,484 --> 01:45:50,071
And I'll be dead or back in prison, 
which is the same thing.

1310
01:45:50,196 --> 01:45:52,281
You're not leaving.

1311
01:45:56,744 --> 01:46:00,790
All right,
I'll do it myself.

1312
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:04,418
I got three weeks' weapons training.

1313
01:46:04,544 --> 01:46:08,422
I'll kick the- 
Out of a platoon full of Marines.

1314
01:46:08,548 --> 01:46:11,300
No problem.

1315
01:46:23,145 --> 01:46:26,023
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery.
- Aye, sir.

1316
01:46:26,148 --> 01:46:29,610
Fire open control circuit coordinates to the roof, sir.

1317
01:46:30,361 --> 01:46:32,071
Let's go!

1318
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:38,452
Laser powered up!

1319
01:46:39,787 --> 01:46:45,001
- Oh, no.
- I said, on your knees!

1320
01:46:45,126 --> 01:46:49,755
My name's Stanley Goodspeed. 
I'm a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI.

1321
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:51,799
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

1322
01:46:51,924 --> 01:46:54,510
- Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?
- Shut the fuck up!

1323
01:46:54,635 --> 01:46:57,305
Because if the winds change
after you launch those rockets,

1324
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:59,432
- we're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

1325
01:46:59,557 --> 01:47:03,561
And you're gonna end up in either a glass jar 
or a plastic bag.

1326
01:47:03,686 --> 01:47:06,981
So, what do you say you do the math, 
h-hand over the gun- 

1327
01:47:07,106 --> 01:47:10,484
- and let's go find some rockets?
- I said shut the fuck-

1328
01:47:19,285 --> 01:47:21,996
- You made the right choice.
- I decided I didn't want your child

1329
01:47:22,121 --> 01:47:24,915
growing up without a father.

1330
01:47:25,041 --> 01:47:27,877
Hey, the last time I swam this channel I was your age.

1331
01:47:28,002 --> 01:47:31,005
So, I'm fucked either way.
So, come on.

1332
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:34,008
Weapon is hot. 
I am standing by for the launch command.

1333
01:47:34,133 --> 01:47:36,844
Man, killing Navy SEALs is one thing...

1334
01:47:36,969 --> 01:47:40,347
- Is this for real?
- Hey, it's business.

1335
01:47:43,142 --> 01:47:45,561
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

1336
01:47:45,686 --> 01:47:48,606
Launch coordinates:
six, seven,

1337
01:47:48,731 --> 01:47:51,859
five, four, five, niner.

1338
01:47:54,361 --> 01:47:58,449
The weapon is hot. 
I'm standing by for launch command.

1339
01:47:58,574 --> 01:48:00,534
That's affirmative.

1340
01:48:07,291 --> 01:48:09,710
Standing by for command.

1341
01:48:17,718 --> 01:48:20,262
I'm waiting for launch command, General.

1342
01:48:29,021 --> 01:48:31,273
- Fire.
- Fire!

1343
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,572
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

1344
01:48:44,119 --> 01:48:48,666
Origin: Alcatraz, 67253725.

1345
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:52,795
- What's the goddam heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1346
01:48:52,796 --> 01:48:53,596
Speed?

1347
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:55,774
Three hundred knots.
It's headed right at Oakland.

1348
01:48:57,299 --> 01:48:59,718
Football game.

1349
01:49:02,096 --> 01:49:03,889
Oh, my God.

1350
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:29,915
Missile radically changing direction.

1351
01:49:35,045 --> 01:49:39,425
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1352
01:49:40,884 --> 01:49:43,137
Oh, Christ!

1353
01:49:43,262 --> 01:49:45,639
Missile losing altitude.
Falling.

1354
01:49:47,266 --> 01:49:50,644
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

1355
01:49:53,939 --> 01:49:56,775
Bogey detonated under water.

1356
01:50:00,279 --> 01:50:01,196
What the fuck?

1357
01:50:01,322 --> 01:50:03,699
It missed.

1358
01:50:03,824 --> 01:50:05,951
- Well, that's great.
- Extremely great.

1359
01:50:06,076 --> 01:50:08,329
But there's still one left.

1360
01:50:08,454 --> 01:50:12,082
What happened to the rocket? 
What the fuck happened to the coordinates?

1361
01:50:12,207 --> 01:50:15,711
What the fuck is going on?
Sir! Major!

1362
01:50:15,836 --> 01:50:18,797
- Captain, step outside.
- Talk to me, sir.

1363
01:50:18,922 --> 01:50:20,841
Captain, step outside!

1364
01:50:34,155 --> 01:50:35,765
Get me the Pentagon.

1365
01:50:50,462 --> 01:50:52,540
What the hell was that, Frank?

1366
01:50:53,465 --> 01:50:55,394
- I said, what the hell-
- I heard what you said!

1367
01:50:55,419 --> 01:50:58,722
If you're gonna be insubordinate, 
I'd appreciate it if you'd do it with a little more respect.

1368
01:50:58,723 --> 01:50:59,723
Cut the crap, General.

1369
01:51:00,347 --> 01:51:02,424
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

1370
01:51:02,549 --> 01:51:04,551
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No!

1371
01:51:04,676 --> 01:51:07,721
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

1372
01:51:07,846 --> 01:51:10,933
You're coming loose. 
The rest of us are in complete control.

1373
01:51:11,058 --> 01:51:13,977
- We're askin' 'em for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

1374
01:51:14,103 --> 01:51:15,938
- The men are falling apart.
- The men are Marines!

1375
01:51:16,063 --> 01:51:19,650
Are they?

1376
01:51:19,775 --> 01:51:22,402
- I wanna talk to General Kramer.
- You've been asked by an old friend.

1377
01:51:22,528 --> 01:51:24,930
- Put him on the phone right now.
- You've been ordered by a superior officer.

1378
01:51:24,955 --> 01:51:25,775
This is Major Baxter.

1379
01:51:25,776 --> 01:51:27,976
Now you're being given your last chance 
by a man with a gun.

1380
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,019
Put the phone down.

1381
01:51:34,456 --> 01:51:37,125
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warmin' up.

1382
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:40,587
At ease.

1383
01:51:49,179 --> 01:51:51,765
They need a decision, Mr. President.

1384
01:52:00,858 --> 01:52:03,360
These past few hours

1385
01:52:03,485 --> 01:52:07,281
have been the longest, darkest of my life.

1386
01:52:07,406 --> 01:52:11,493
How does one weigh human life?

1387
01:52:11,618 --> 01:52:15,038
One million civilians against 81 hostages.

1388
01:52:16,415 --> 01:52:18,458
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1389
01:52:20,252 --> 01:52:24,798
That we have ignored,
abandoned or marginalized

1390
01:52:24,923 --> 01:52:27,301
a great soldier like Frank Hummel,

1391
01:52:27,426 --> 01:52:32,306
and that American boys have paid 
for that neglect in blood,

1392
01:52:32,431 --> 01:52:36,643
is equally real and equally tragic.

1393
01:52:39,563 --> 01:52:42,608
We are at war with terror.

1394
01:52:42,733 --> 01:52:44,985
Fighting a war means casualties.

1395
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:48,488
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

1396
01:52:52,784 --> 01:52:55,245
Air strike approved.

1397
01:52:58,415 --> 01:53:00,167
Red Thunder to tower.
Request clearance.

1398
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:04,221
With the amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there...

1399
01:53:04,346 --> 01:53:07,549
- Tower this is Strike Leader. Prepared to go.
- it'll be over in a few seconds.

1400
01:53:07,674 --> 01:53:09,885
Flight time to drop point.
17 minutes.

1401
01:53:16,516 --> 01:53:21,271
Excuse me, General, sir, with all due respect, 
but what the fuck is going on?

1402
01:53:21,396 --> 01:53:24,566
- You changed the coordinates, didn't you?
- That's affirmative, Captain.

1403
01:53:24,691 --> 01:53:28,653
So, now they think we're gutless, the Feds? 
They think we won't actually do it.

1404
01:53:28,779 --> 01:53:31,556
They're gonna come at us with everything they've got. 
Air and sea.

1405
01:53:31,582 --> 01:53:33,511
They're gonna bomb our ass back to the Stone Age.

1406
01:53:33,512 --> 01:53:35,612
They don't know we missed on purpose.

1407
01:53:36,036 --> 01:53:41,708
Great. We're not gutless, we're incompetent. 
That right?

1408
01:53:41,833 --> 01:53:45,670
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1409
01:53:45,796 --> 01:53:48,298
Load the V.X. into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1410
01:53:48,423 --> 01:53:50,342
The consequences of our actions I'll face alone.

1411
01:53:50,467 --> 01:53:53,929
Excuse me, General, 
but what about the fucking money?

1412
01:53:54,054 --> 01:53:56,515
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1413
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:58,350
Bullshit it's over.

1414
01:53:58,475 --> 01:54:02,020
You're talking to a general, soldier. 
Maintain discipline.

1415
01:54:02,145 --> 01:54:04,189
I'm not a soldier, Major.

1416
01:54:04,314 --> 01:54:08,985
The day we took hostages we became mercenaries. 
And mercenaries get paid!

1417
01:54:09,111 --> 01:54:11,696
I want my fucking money!

1418
01:54:11,822 --> 01:54:15,534
This mission was based on the threat of force.

1419
01:54:15,659 --> 01:54:19,663
I'm not about to kill 80,000 innocent people.
Do you think I'm out of my fucking mind?

1420
01:54:22,249 --> 01:54:24,709
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1421
01:54:29,214 --> 01:54:31,758
Whoever said anything about bluffing, General?

1422
01:54:31,883 --> 01:54:33,760
Stand down, Captain.

1423
01:54:38,431 --> 01:54:40,684
Stand down, Captain!

1424
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:49,568
Major, I'm ordering you 
to take these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1425
01:54:52,571 --> 01:54:56,658
- That's a simple order, Major!
- It's not so simple, Frank.

1426
01:54:56,783 --> 01:54:59,202
Sergeant Crisp...

1427
01:54:59,327 --> 01:55:02,080
secure the General.

1428
01:55:02,205 --> 01:55:04,541
I'm relieving you of your command, sir.

1429
01:55:09,087 --> 01:55:11,089
Sergeant!

1430
01:55:18,096 --> 01:55:21,433
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

1431
01:55:29,691 --> 01:55:33,111
Major Baxter, you're either with us or against us.

1432
01:55:38,825 --> 01:55:41,870
It has been the greatest honor of my life 
to serve with you, General.

1433
01:55:46,958 --> 01:55:49,711
But like he said...

1434
01:55:51,087 --> 01:55:53,673
it's over.

1435
01:56:09,648 --> 01:56:11,775
Let's get him.

1436
01:56:16,863 --> 01:56:19,491
Mason!

1437
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,381
My God, what have I done?

1438
01:56:23,382 --> 01:56:26,082
Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket?

1439
01:56:29,167 --> 01:56:32,087
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

1440
01:56:32,212 --> 01:56:34,881
- Lower lighthouse.
- Go!

1441
01:56:48,144 --> 01:56:51,022
Darrow, go to the lighthouse.
I'll take care of this fucker!

1442
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:01,533
One, two, three!
Eat that!

1443
01:57:15,964 --> 01:57:17,382
Did it.

1444
01:57:48,496 --> 01:57:52,917
Come here. 
Come here, you little chicken shit!

1445
01:57:53,042 --> 01:57:56,296
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

1446
01:57:56,421 --> 01:57:58,631
Well, come on. Come on. 
Don't be scared. I won't hurt ya.

1447
01:57:58,756 --> 01:58:00,925
- Come on.
- Do you know how this shit works?

1448
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:03,178
You know how this shit works?

1449
01:58:07,223 --> 01:58:09,267
Come on. Come on.

1450
01:58:09,392 --> 01:58:11,436
I don't need the gun.
I'll put it down.

1451
01:58:11,561 --> 01:58:15,899
Come on, let's play.
Come on. Come on.

1452
01:58:16,024 --> 01:58:20,653
Listen, I think we got started off on the wrong foot. 
Stan Goodspeed, FBI. Uh-

1453
01:58:20,778 --> 01:58:23,948
Let's talk music. 
Do you like the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1454
01:58:24,073 --> 01:58:26,117
I don't like soft-ass shit.

1455
01:58:26,242 --> 01:58:28,369
Oh, you- Oh, oh. 
Oh.

1456
01:58:28,494 --> 01:58:32,457
Well, I only bring it up because, 
uh, it's you.

1457
01:58:32,582 --> 01:58:35,084
You're the Rocket Man.

1458
01:58:36,753 --> 01:58:38,504
No!

1459
01:58:40,632 --> 01:58:44,802
- How do you like how that shit works?
- Second rocket's away!

1460
01:58:52,644 --> 01:58:54,687
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

1461
01:58:56,064 --> 01:58:58,441
Shit!

1462
01:59:18,461 --> 01:59:20,588
Darrow!

1463
01:59:20,713 --> 01:59:22,715
Open up!

1464
01:59:25,551 --> 01:59:27,178
Come on.

1465
01:59:27,303 --> 01:59:29,013
Open up!

1466
01:59:57,792 --> 02:00:00,545
Hey, you mother!

1467
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:36,664
Oh, I'm gonna get you now, baby.

1468
02:00:40,251 --> 02:00:42,837
Okay.

1469
02:00:44,964 --> 02:00:46,591
I got ya.
I got you, baby.

1470
02:00:48,009 --> 02:00:50,219
Come on.

1471
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:07,653
Fucker!

1472
02:01:34,347 --> 02:01:36,349
Red Thunder Strike Leader.

1473
02:01:36,474 --> 02:01:38,809
Time on target: seven minutes.

1474
02:01:56,118 --> 02:01:59,038
English prick. 
I tell you my old man was Irish?

1475
02:02:01,958 --> 02:02:04,669
Maintain air speed 450 knots.

1476
02:02:10,967 --> 02:02:13,052
Fuck!

1477
02:02:31,445 --> 02:02:33,489
It's me and you, pal.

1478
02:02:33,614 --> 02:02:36,033
I want that fucking chip!

1479
02:02:46,293 --> 02:02:48,337
I love pressure.

1480
02:02:55,594 --> 02:02:58,556
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

1481
02:02:58,681 --> 02:03:01,058
Now, pay the piper and come out like a man.

1482
02:03:30,629 --> 02:03:33,007
Increase speed to 500 knots.

1483
02:03:33,132 --> 02:03:35,843
You motherfucker!
Die!

1484
02:03:40,598 --> 02:03:44,560
I'm gonna choke my million bucks out of you. 
You're gonna die.

1485
02:03:44,685 --> 02:03:47,521
Eat that, you fuck!

1486
02:04:15,925 --> 02:04:18,385
All right, team, inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

1487
02:04:23,432 --> 02:04:27,436
Come to course heading 142 degrees.

1488
02:04:35,152 --> 02:04:37,279
When he neutralizes the threat,

1489
02:04:37,404 --> 02:04:40,491
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

1490
02:04:45,246 --> 02:04:48,916
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on their souls.

1491
02:04:49,041 --> 02:04:52,169
Please don't let this happen. 
There has to be something you can do. Please.

1492
02:05:02,888 --> 02:05:05,891
Let's drop to the deck.
One hundred feet below radar.

1493
02:05:16,026 --> 02:05:18,404
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

1494
02:05:21,824 --> 02:05:25,744
This is Red Thunder.
Master armed. Master armed.

1495
02:05:27,079 --> 02:05:29,581
Time on target: 12 seconds.

1496
02:05:32,126 --> 02:05:35,212
T.O.T. ten seconds.

1497
02:05:39,341 --> 02:05:41,218
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1498
02:05:43,846 --> 02:05:45,973
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

1499
02:05:46,098 --> 02:05:49,393
This is C.Q One, C.Q One! Green smoke!
We have green smoke! Over.

1500
02:05:49,518 --> 02:05:51,687
- Eh, gimme that! Gimme that! Abort!
- Abort!

1501
02:05:51,812 --> 02:05:54,523
- Flight leader, abort, abort, abort!
- Jesus Chri-

1502
02:05:56,775 --> 02:05:59,403
I already dropped them!

1503
02:06:08,454 --> 02:06:12,416
- Oh, goddam it!
- Oh, my God!

1504
02:06:15,169 --> 02:06:18,130
Get out of my way. 
Let me through, please. Let me through!

1505
02:06:22,551 --> 02:06:26,472
The cells did not get hit.
The bombs hit on the back of the island.

1506
02:06:49,369 --> 02:06:54,458
I'm fed up saving your ass.
I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

1507
02:06:54,583 --> 02:06:58,587
I suppose all this 
will make a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1508
02:06:58,712 --> 02:07:04,009
You're insane, Mason. The kid'll have nightmares. 
Spend all my money on shrinks.

1509
02:07:05,219 --> 02:07:07,179
Goodspeed, come in.

1510
02:07:07,304 --> 02:07:10,474
Goodspeed, Goodspeed, do you read me? 
Come in!

1511
02:07:10,599 --> 02:07:14,061
- Scanning all radio frequencies.
- Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1512
02:07:16,271 --> 02:07:19,024
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

1513
02:07:24,279 --> 02:07:27,950
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

1514
02:07:28,075 --> 02:07:30,744
This is Goodspeed.

1515
02:07:32,454 --> 02:07:36,792
- Are the hostages alive?
- Every one of 'em.

1516
02:07:39,795 --> 02:07:42,381
Goodspeed, it's Womack.

1517
02:07:42,506 --> 02:07:45,217
What about Mason?

1518
02:07:52,432 --> 02:07:54,726
- He's dead, sir.
- How? When?

1519
02:07:54,851 --> 02:07:57,479
Just come and get me.

1520
02:07:59,982 --> 02:08:03,151
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1521
02:08:03,277 --> 02:08:05,988
But, of course. I knew he would.

1522
02:08:06,113 --> 02:08:09,199
The S.D.U.s and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

1523
02:08:09,324 --> 02:08:12,537
If you can get to the Pan Pacific Hotel, 
there's clothes in my closet,

1524
02:08:12,762 --> 02:08:15,707
$200 in the Bible. Room 26.

1525
02:08:16,832 --> 02:08:21,211
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1526
02:08:23,171 --> 02:08:26,383
But thank you.

1527
02:08:26,508 --> 02:08:32,347
Well, Stanley, uh, 
this is when we go our separate ways, huh?

1528
02:08:32,472 --> 02:08:36,977
But, uh, I'm sure you know 
the etymology of your name "Goodspeed".

1529
02:08:37,102 --> 02:08:41,231
Yeah, Godspeed: 
to wish someone a prosperous journey. Why?

1530
02:08:41,356 --> 02:08:45,068
Well, if you fancy a journey...

1531
02:08:45,193 --> 02:08:48,113
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

1532
02:08:49,114 --> 02:08:51,324
I was thinking of Maui.

1533
02:08:51,450 --> 02:08:53,660
No.

1534
02:08:57,247 --> 02:09:00,208
Forget Maui.

1535
02:09:05,589 --> 02:09:09,760
"St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.

1536
02:09:09,885 --> 02:09:12,137
Front pew, right leg.

1537
02:09:12,262 --> 02:09:15,098
Hollow."

1538
02:09:15,223 --> 02:09:17,893
Is this what I think it is?

1539
02:09:19,519 --> 02:09:22,481
Mason?

1540
02:09:35,911 --> 02:09:37,980
Congratulations, Dr. Goodspeed.
You did it.

1541
02:09:37,981 --> 02:09:39,081
Thank you, sir.

1542
02:09:39,206 --> 02:09:42,000
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1543
02:09:42,125 --> 02:09:44,461
Well done, son.

1544
02:09:44,586 --> 02:09:46,213
So, where's Mason?

1545
02:09:46,338 --> 02:09:50,425
Vaporized.
Blown out to sea.

1546
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:52,844
Blown out to sea, huh?

1547
02:09:52,969 --> 02:09:55,388
Yeah.

1548
02:09:56,264 --> 02:10:00,519
Poor bastard.

1549
02:10:00,644 --> 02:10:05,607
Goodspeed, where's Mason? Where's his body? 
I wanna see that son of a bitch!

1550
02:10:05,732 --> 02:10:09,319
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1551
02:10:09,444 --> 02:10:14,032
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

1552
02:10:14,157 --> 02:10:17,285
Oh, yeah!
Absolutely, sir.

1553
02:10:20,121 --> 02:10:24,209
St. Michael's Church, front pew, right leg.

1554
02:10:24,334 --> 02:10:26,211
Front pew, right leg.

1555
02:10:26,336 --> 02:10:28,338
Vandals! Vandals!

1556
02:10:28,463 --> 02:10:30,674
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

1557
02:10:30,799 --> 02:10:34,594
- Stop! Vandals! Stop!
- I'm sorry!

1558
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:37,556
- Come on, baby!
- I've got it! Okay, let's go!

1559
02:10:37,681 --> 02:10:40,934
- Stop! Stop!
- Sorry!

1560
02:10:42,686 --> 02:10:44,271
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

1561
02:10:46,314 --> 02:10:49,192
Vandals! Vandals!

1562
02:10:49,317 --> 02:10:54,322
Honey, uh, you wanna know who really killed J.F.K.?
