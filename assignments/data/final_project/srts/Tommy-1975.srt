1
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:06,677
Captain Walker didn't come home.

2
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:11,890
His unborn child will never know him

3
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:17,104
We believe him missing with a number of men,

4
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:22,317
Don't expect to see him again

5
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:43,172
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy

6
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:52,556
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy

7
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:02,983
A son! A son!

8
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:17,581
A son!

9
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:23,837
Hear the joyful celebrations in the street!

10
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,136
It's a boy born on this first day of peace!

11
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:44,691
We've won! A son! We've won!

12
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:32,925
I'm your friendly green coat,
And I welcome you to Bernie's Holiday Camp!

13
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:38,138
G'day, and you'll be happy,

14
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:42,309
And it's Bernie you will thank.

15
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:48,565
You must be little Tommy.
Well, call me Uncle Frank.

16
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:58,867
Welcome you too, Mrs. Walker,
Here you'll always find a helping hand!

17
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,583
The camp with the extras

18
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:12,840
If you come to Bernie's,
You might think you're in Heaven!

19
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:04,141
Here we have the winner, folks!
Have you ever seen a lovelier pair?

20
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:11,440
What a shapely ankle!
What a perfect shin!

21
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,653
If you could feel this silken thigh,
You'd know who has to win!

22
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:26,455
If you could feel this silken thigh,
You'd know.

23
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:46,058
You don't know how much I've missed

24
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:51,271
To feel a man again,
To dance, to kiss.

25
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,700
Your eyes reveal: You're lonely.

26
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,828
This evening must pass slowly.

27
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,957
Until we're one, my heart won't rest.

28
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,339
Will Tommy share our happiness?

29
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:41,113
I'll be more than an uncle;
I'll be just like a Dad!

30
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:48,537
I will be a green coat too,
And when I'm big, I'll own a Holiday Camp!

31
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,877
A camp with a difference,
Always be good weather.

32
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,841
When you come to Tommy's,
The holiday's forever!

33
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:40,881
I'm glad you like your Uncle Frank.
He'll surely love you too, just like a Dad

34
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:58,398
He's very nice, I think.
Did he fight in the War?

35
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:38,438
Gotta feeling '51 is gonna be a good year,

36
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,612
Especially if you and me see it out together.

37
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:51,451
So you think that '51 is gonna be a good year.

38
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:58,041
We'll marry now and see it out together.

39
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:05,549
I have no reason to be over-optimistic,

40
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:13,682
But somehow when you smile
I can brave bad weather.

41
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:17,579
What about the boy?
What about the boy?

42
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:22,584
What about the boy, he saw it all!

43
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,381
You didn't hear it, you didn't see it!
You won't say nothin' to no one,

44
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,760
Ever in your life. You never heard it.
How absurd it all seems, without any proof

45
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,931
You didn't hear it, you didn't see it!
You won't say nothin' to no one,

46
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,268
Ever in your life.
You never heard it.

47
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:45,858
How absurd it all seems, without any proof!

48
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:57,119
You won't say nothin' to no one,
Never tell a soul what you know is the truth!

49
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,053
Now he is deaf.
Now he is dumb

50
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,308
Now he is blind.
The guilty are safe,

51
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,063
But always accused by his empty eyes.

52
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:38,493
Nothing to say, Nothing
to hear, And nothing to see

53
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:43,707
Each sensation makes a note in his symphony.

54
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:52,799
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go

55
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,056
Come on the amazing journey,
And learn all you should know.

56
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:09,983
A vague haze of delirium creeps up on him.
Soaring and flying images spin.

57
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:16,240
He is your leader, he is your guide.
On the amazing journey,

58
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:09,626
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

59
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:14,840
Come on the amazing journey,
And learn all you should know

60
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:26,518
His eyes are the eyes that transmit all he knows,
The truth burns so bright it can melt winter snows.

61
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:30,689
A towering shadow, so black and so high,.

62
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:34,860
A white sun burning the earth and the sky.

63
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:17,379
Did you ever see the faces
Of the children, they get so excited

64
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:26,013
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited

65
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:31,977
They believe in dreams and all they mean,
Including Heaven's generosity.

66
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:39,276
Peeping 'round the door to see what
Parcels are for free in curiosity.

67
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:54,583
He doesn't know who Jesus was,
Or what praying is.

68
00:22:54,583 --> 00:23:00,839
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

69
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:27,115
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?

70
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:03,402
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.

71
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:36,143
Surrounded by his friends,
He sits so silently and

72
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:41,356
Unaware of anything.
Playing poxy pinball, picks his nose

73
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:45,527
He smiles, he cries,
He pokes his tongue at everything

74
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:46,570
I believe in love,

75
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:52,826
But how can men who've never seen light
Be enlightened?

76
00:24:53,869 --> 00:25:00,125
Only if he's cured
Will his spirit's future level

77
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,211
Ever heighten.

78
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,964
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.

79
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:12,221
He doesn't know who Jesus was,
Or what praying is.

80
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,937
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

81
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:43,478
You talk about your woman,
I wish you could see mine.

82
00:26:54,823 --> 00:27:00,454
Everytime she starts to lovin',
She brings eyesight to the blind.

83
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:17,471
You know, her daddy gave her magic.
I can tell by the way she walks.

84
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:31,235
Everytime she starts to shake,
The dumb begin to talk,

85
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:21,493
She's got the power to heal you,
Never fear.

86
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:36,508
Just one word from her lips,
And the deaf can hear.

87
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:21,460
If your child ain't all he should be now,
This girl will put him right.

88
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:27,716
I'll show him what he could be now,
Just give me one night!

89
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:37,643
I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen,
Pay me before I start.

90
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:43,982
I'm the Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed
To mend his aching heart.

91
00:33:55,661 --> 00:34:01,208
Give us a room, close the door.
Leave us for a while.

92
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:07,464
Your boy won't be a boy no more;
Young, but not a child!

93
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:13,720
'Cause I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen,
Pay me before I start.

94
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,977
The Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart.

95
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,547
Gather your wits and hold on fast,
Your mind must learn to roam.

96
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:54,803
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do,
You're gonna hit the road!

97
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:40,117
My work is done, now look at him.
He's never been more alive.

98
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:46,373
His head it shakes, his fingers clutch.
Watch his body writhe!

99
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:43,337
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Cousin Kevin?

100
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:48,967
There's something 'bout him I
Don't really like.

101
00:41:54,890 --> 00:42:00,729
I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright.

102
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:16,703
We're on our own, cousin.
All alone, cousin.

103
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,960
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away

104
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,216
You won't be much fun,
Being blind, deaf and dumb,

105
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:35,472
But I've no one to play with today.
Do you know how to play Hide and Seek?

106
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:40,686
To find me, it would take you a week!

107
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:45,899
You won't go anywhere.
There's a lot I can do to a freak!

108
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:52,155
How would you feel if I turned on the bath,
Ducked your head under and started to laugh?

109
00:42:55,284 --> 00:43:01,540
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Will change your expression to one of alarm.

110
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:23,520
I'm the school bully,
The classroom cheat,

111
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:30,402
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet.

112
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:37,701
I'll put glass in your dinner,
and spikes in your seat.

113
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:49,171
I'll drag you around
By a lock of your hair,

114
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:55,636
And give you a push
At the top of the stair!

115
00:43:55,636 --> 00:44:01,892
What would you do if I
Shut you outside

116
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:09,191
To stand in the rain and
Catch cold, so you'd die?

117
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:18,575
I'm the school bully,
The classroom cheat,

118
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:24,831
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet.

119
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:32,130
I'll stick pins in your fingers,
And tread on your feet.

120
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:44,977
We're on our own, cousin.
All alone, cousin.

121
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:51,233
We've thought of some nice games to play
While the grownups has all gone away.

122
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:58,532
You weren't too much fun,
'Cause you're blind, deaf and dumb,

123
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,660
But I'd no one to play with today.

124
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:59,635
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie?

125
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:05,974
Do you think it's alright?
He's had a few too many tonight

126
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:15,067
Yes, I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright.

127
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:44,471
I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie;
I'm glad you won't see or hear me,

128
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:49,685
As I fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about.

129
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:55,941
Your mother left me here to mind you,
And I'm doing exactly what I bleedin' well want to,

130
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,997
Down with your bedclothes,
Up with your nightshirt.

131
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:16,253
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about.

132
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:23,552
You won't "shite"
As I fiddle "abite. "

133
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:10,659
Do you think it's alright
Leaving Tommy by the mirror?

134
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:16,915
You would think he had sight,
Been staring half the night.

135
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:25,549
Yes, I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright

136
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:41,763
Extra, extra, pinball bonanza!
Deaf dumb and blind kid makes the big game!

137
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:46,977
Saturday, the final, he faces the champ!
Extra, extra, extra!

138
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:53,233
Pinball, the big time, a million in hand!
You can rule the world from a yacht in the bay!

139
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:57,404
Champagne flowing, you're popular, man!
Pinball, let's play!

140
00:53:57,487 --> 00:54:00,407
Tommy keeps on winning,
He's a millionaire,

141
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:04,578
Momma's got a brand new Cadillac.
Hurry to the show,

142
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:07,706
We're nearly on the air!
Extra, extra!

143
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:45,035
Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.

144
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:48,163
From SoHo down to Brighton,
I must have played them all.

145
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:51,291
But I ain't seen nothin' like him
In any amusement hall.

146
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:56,505
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

147
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:07,349
He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.

148
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:10,477
Feelin' all the bumpers,
Always playin' clean.

149
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:14,648
He plays by intuition.
The digit counters fall.

150
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:18,819
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

151
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:29,371
He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.

152
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:32,499
A pinball wizard,

153
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:36,670
Got such a supple wrist!

154
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:39,798
How do you think he does it?

155
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:40,841
I don't know!

156
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:42,384
What makes him so good?

157
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:48,140
Well, he ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.

158
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,268
Don't see lights a-flashing,
He plays by sense of smell.

159
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:54,396
Always has a replay,
Never tilts at all,

160
00:55:54,396 --> 00:55:59,610
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

161
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:10,329
He can't beat me now,
I've always been the champ!

162
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:14,499
I know it's a trick!
No freak's gonna beat my hand!

163
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:43,695
He can beat my favorite table,
He can beat the best.

164
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:46,823
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

165
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:49,952
He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I've never seen them fall.

166
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:55,165
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

167
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,517
He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist.

168
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:16,645
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist!

169
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:28,115
He's a pinball wizard
His score shoots even more

170
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:33,328
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord!

171
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:41,170
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more

172
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:18,707
thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.

173
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:30,297
It rains champagne!
A son was born again!

174
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:36,845
A genius untamed!
A life of wealth and fame, wealth and fame!

175
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:51,026
Champagne flowing down just like rain,
Caviar breakfasts every day.

176
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:58,450
Merchant banks and yachts and...
Servants and cars and private sand.

177
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:06,792
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.

178
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:45,247
They flock in, thousands strong.
We'll just play along.

179
01:01:45,581 --> 01:01:51,837
A million in reserve.
For love, a just deserve, just deserve!

180
01:01:59,636 --> 01:02:05,893
Birds and flowers and peacock's wings,
Sequined gowns and birds that sing!

181
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:12,983
Private planes and fishing lanes.
Bigger crowds and bigger, bigger, bigger takes.

182
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:22,367
But what's it all worth?

183
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:36,548
What's it all worth when my son is blind?
He can't hear the music nor enjoy what I'm buying.

184
01:02:37,174 --> 01:02:43,430
His life is worthless, affecting mine.
I'd pay any price to drive his plight from my mind!

185
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:25,527
There's a man I've found
Could bring us all joy!

186
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:30,449
There's a doctor I've found can cure the boy!
A doctor I've found can cure the boy!

187
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:35,329
There's a man I've found could remove his sorrow,
He lives in this town, let's see him tomorrow,

188
01:07:01,813 --> 01:07:08,070
He seems to be completely unreceptive.
The tests I gave him showed no sense at all.

189
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:15,702
His eyes react to light; the dials detect it.
He hears but cannot answer to your call.

190
01:07:57,828 --> 01:08:04,084
There is no chance, no untried operation.
All hope lies with him and none with me.

191
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:11,592
Imagine though the shock from isolation,
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see.

192
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:02,059
His eyes can see,
His ears can hear, his lips speak.

193
01:09:02,059 --> 01:09:06,230
All the time the needles flick and rock.

194
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:12,486
No machine can give the kind of stimulation,
Needed to remove his inner block.

195
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:27,709
I often wonder what it is he's feeling.
Has he ever heard a word I've said?

196
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:35,717
Look at him, now in the mirror dreaming.
What is happening in his head?

197
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:50,315
What is happening in his head?
Oooooh, I wish I knew, I wish I knew.

198
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:37,237
Tommy, can you see me?
Can I help to cheer you?

199
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:42,451
Tommy, can you hear me?
Can you feel me near you?

200
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:48,707
Oooh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

201
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:58,151
You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a twitch

202
01:11:58,151 --> 01:12:02,322
But you gaze at your own reflection!

203
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:06,493
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself.

204
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:11,707
How can the mirror affect you?

205
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:17,880
Can you hear me
Or do I surmise

206
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,050
That you fear me can you feel my temper

207
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:28,307
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise,

208
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:42,905
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror?

209
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:31,286
I'm free - I'm free,

210
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:41,505
And freedom tastes of reality!

211
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:48,595
I'm free - I'm free,

212
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:55,978
And I'm waiting for you to follow me.

213
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:01,316
If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high

214
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:05,487
You'd laugh and say "Nothing's that simple. "

215
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:07,573
But you've been told many times before

216
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:09,658
Messiahs pointed to the door

217
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:14,872
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

218
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:38,854
I'm free - I'm free

219
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:46,028
And I'm waiting for you to follow me.

220
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:58,934
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?

221
01:16:53,572 --> 01:16:59,828
Mother, Father.
Touch me, feel me.

222
01:17:02,331 --> 01:17:04,708
Who am I, where did I come from?

223
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:08,879
Have you known me, have you seen me?

224
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:15,469
You're a hero! You are famous!
You're a champion of the young!

225
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:20,682
You are rich, but it's so absurd to try
To explain all the things you've done.

226
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:26,939
You're a god, and you're loved;
Thousands watch you play

227
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:32,778
Pinball! It's a fever!
And you're the master of the game!

228
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:39,117
And now that you're whole,
You'll be champion of their very souls.

229
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:48,293
Yes, I'm healed!
Delivered from silent darkness.

230
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:53,507
No more locked doors
Or stifled screams.

231
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:59,763
Pinball! What I see now before me

232
01:18:01,223 --> 01:18:06,979
Is far beyond the game,
Beyond your wildest dreams!

233
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:17,823
Those who love me
Have a higher path to follow now

234
01:18:18,949 --> 01:18:23,537
And you, dear mother, too
Must be prepared!

235
01:19:17,049 --> 01:19:22,888
Extra, extra, read all about it!
Pinball Wizard in a miracle cure!

236
01:19:22,888 --> 01:19:27,059
Extra, extra, read all about it!
Extra, Extra!

237
01:19:28,727 --> 01:19:33,398
Right now, right now, story and pictures
Pinball bonanza, a mother's joy!

238
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:36,527
...to show times, lessons and actors.

239
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:59,466
Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting.

240
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:04,680
He went on cleaning his black Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping.

241
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:12,813
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah.

242
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:18,652
She picked up a book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire!

243
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:23,782
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart

244
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:26,910
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,

245
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:34,209
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...

246
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:37,337
Is to be what you'll be. "

247
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:51,101
The theme of the sermon was come unto me,
Love will find a way,

248
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:56,315
So Sally decided to ignore her dad,
And sneak out anyway!

249
01:20:56,315 --> 01:21:01,528
She spent all afternoon getting ready,
Decided she'd try to touch him,

250
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:06,742
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday.

251
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:14,750
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart

252
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,878
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,

253
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:23,717
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...

254
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:25,802
Is to be what you'll be. "

255
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:45,113
She arrived at six and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine.

256
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:50,327
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying.

257
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:55,541
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row

258
01:21:55,541 --> 01:22:00,754
And then one of the people came on stage
And shouted, "Here we go!"

259
01:22:03,674 --> 01:22:08,679
The crowd went crazy as Tommy hit the stage!

260
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:14,935
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage!

261
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:22,317
Your happy welcome is like a favor
I must now return.

262
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:28,782
The darkness of my childhood past
And flames of blood now burn.

263
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:33,996
The pinball game I play so well
Reflects a way of life.

264
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:39,543
This meeting is just another game;
Let's play to win, tonight!

265
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:44,423
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart

266
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:47,551
That she and Tommy were worlds apart

267
01:22:51,305 --> 01:22:53,182
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...

268
01:22:53,182 --> 01:22:55,267
Is to be what you'll be. "

269
01:23:06,737 --> 01:23:11,867
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,
Mingling with her tears.

270
01:23:11,867 --> 01:23:17,080
Try to walk the path I walked,
Never mind the pain and fear.

271
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:22,294
Each one of you has freedom
In your heart without my grace.

272
01:23:22,294 --> 01:23:28,550
Let me see you raise your hands
See joy upon your face!

273
01:23:30,636 --> 01:23:35,516
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage!

274
01:23:35,516 --> 01:23:40,729
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch

275
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:44,900
And a gash across her face,
her pretty face! Ooooh.

276
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,028
Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said,

277
01:23:48,028 --> 01:23:50,656
"Don't say I didn't warn yer. "

278
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:56,912
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California.

279
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:05,546
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild!

280
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:11,802
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile.

281
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:19,369
While Tommy flies, the world is turning.

282
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:23,540
Life goes on for you and me

283
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:28,754
Our chief concern is money earning,

284
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:33,967
Why can't someone set us free?

285
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:45,354
Can't you feel him?
Can't you feel him?

286
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:07,102
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration

287
01:27:07,102 --> 01:27:13,358
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

288
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:30,876
I overwhelm as I approach you
Make your lungs hold breath inside!

289
01:27:33,879 --> 01:27:40,135
Lovers break caresses for me
Love enhanced when I've gone by.

290
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:58,403
They worship me and all I touch
Hazy eyed they catch my glance,

291
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:07,663
Pleasant shudders shake their senses
My warm momentum throws their stance.

292
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:18,841
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration

293
01:28:18,841 --> 01:28:24,054
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

294
01:28:29,476 --> 01:28:34,565
Soon you'll see me can't you feel me
I'm coming...

295
01:28:35,732 --> 01:28:40,737
Send your troubles dancing I know the answer
I'm coming...

296
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:48,453
I'm a sensation.

297
01:29:09,183 --> 01:29:15,439
I leave a trail of rooted people
Mesmerised by just the sight,

298
01:29:18,275 --> 01:29:24,531
The few I touched now are disciples
Love as One I Am the Light...

299
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:54,144
Come to my house,
Be one of the comfortable people.

300
01:29:57,481 --> 01:30:02,778
Come to this house, We're
drinking all night, Never sleeping.

301
01:30:07,282 --> 01:30:10,911
Milkman come in!
And you, baker,

302
01:30:11,245 --> 01:30:15,707
Little old lady, welcome,
And you, shoemaker.

303
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:24,049
Come to this house,
Into this house!

304
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:33,976
Come to this house,
Be one of us.

305
01:30:37,396 --> 01:30:43,569
Make this your house,
Be one of us.

306
01:30:47,114 --> 01:30:50,742
You can help
To collect some more in.

307
01:30:50,742 --> 01:30:54,913
Young and old people,
Let's get them all in.

308
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:12,973
Ask along that man with a big red carnation

309
01:31:12,973 --> 01:31:16,101
Bring every single person
From Victoria Station.

310
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:22,357
Go into that hospital,
And bring the nurses and patients.

311
01:31:22,357 --> 01:31:27,571
Everybody go home and fetch their relations.

312
01:31:28,405 --> 01:31:33,827
Come to this house,
Be one of the comfortable people.

313
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:43,921
Lovely bright home,
We're drinking all night never sleeping.

314
01:31:47,466 --> 01:31:50,594
Hullo, Tommy, there's more at the door.

315
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:58,310
There's more at the door.
There's more at the door.

316
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:13,325
We need more room,
Build an extension.

317
01:32:13,325 --> 01:32:18,539
A colorful palace,
Spare no expense, now!

318
01:32:28,257 --> 01:32:34,513
Come to me now!
Come to me now!

319
01:33:10,048 --> 01:33:16,305
To raise your weary spirits high,
My son will teach your silent hearts

320
01:33:17,973 --> 01:33:21,101
To talk!

321
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:31,653
Every home will have his picture.
Pilgrims all will touch his hand.

322
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:40,287
Pinball tables, gold and silver,
Altars to the Master's plan!

323
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:51,131
Rio, Paris, New York, London.
Moscow, Peking, Tokyo, the world

324
01:34:00,933 --> 01:34:07,189
A Tommy Camp in every city,
Millions flocking in like sheep.

325
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:13,779
What they want ain't cheap, 's a pity.
But who am I to upset their dreams?

326
01:37:22,301 --> 01:37:27,389
These pricy gips don't teach us!
Your freedom doesn't reach us!

327
01:37:28,849 --> 01:37:35,022
Enlightenment escapes us!
Awareness doesn't shape us!

328
01:37:35,731 --> 01:37:41,069
How can all this trvia
Take us to the goal you reached?

329
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:48,785
We came here to be like you,
To find the world you've reached

330
01:37:50,954 --> 01:37:57,211
These pricy gips don't teach us!
Your freedom doesn't reach us!

331
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:12,017
How can all this trvia
Take us to the goal you reached?

332
01:38:12,559 --> 01:38:18,607
We came here to be like you,
To find the world you've reached!

333
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:32,996
Welcome to the camp!
I guess you all know why we're here.

334
01:38:34,122 --> 01:38:39,962
My name is Tommy, and I became aware this year.

335
01:38:39,962 --> 01:38:46,218
If you want to follow me,
You've got to play pinball.

336
01:38:46,218 --> 01:38:52,474
So put in your earplugs,
Put on your eyeshades,

337
01:38:52,474 --> 01:38:57,688
You know where to put the cork!

338
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:04,903
Hey you, gettin' drunk,
So sorry, I've got you sussed.

339
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:11,159
Hey, you, smokin' mother nature,
You missed the bus.

340
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:17,416
Hey, hung up old Mister Normal,
Don't try to gain my trust.

341
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:23,672
'Cos you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways,

342
01:39:23,672 --> 01:39:26,800
Although you think you must!

343
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:43,275
Now you can't hear me,
Your ears are truly sealed!

344
01:39:45,027 --> 01:39:50,449
You can't speak either,
'Cos your mouth is filled

345
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:56,705
You can't see nothing,
And pinball completes the scene.

346
01:39:58,081 --> 01:39:59,750
Here come willing helpers

347
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:02,878
To guide you to
Your very own machine!

348
01:40:50,092 --> 01:40:53,971
We're not gonna take it.
We're not gonna take it.

349
01:41:03,146 --> 01:41:07,818
We're not gonna take it,
Never did and never will,

350
01:41:09,194 --> 01:41:11,572
We don't have to take it.

351
01:41:11,905 --> 01:41:15,242
Gonna break it!
Gonna shake it!

352
01:41:15,242 --> 01:41:17,327
Let's forget it better still!

353
01:42:01,413 --> 01:42:07,669
Don't want no religion,
As far as we can tell!

354
01:42:08,086 --> 01:42:13,300
We ain't gonna take you,
Never did and never will!

355
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:23,310
We forsake you,
Gonna rape you,

356
01:42:23,644 --> 01:42:29,900
Let's forget you better still!

357
01:45:14,857 --> 01:45:21,113
Listening to you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat.

358
01:45:22,865 --> 01:45:29,121
Following you I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!

359
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:39,464
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.

360
01:45:41,633 --> 01:45:47,890
From you I get opinions.
From you I get the story.

361
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:03,655
Listening to you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat.

362
01:46:04,072 --> 01:46:10,329
Following you I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!

363
01:46:14,166 --> 01:46:20,422
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.

364
01:46:23,342 --> 01:46:29,598
From you I get opinions.
From you I get the story.

365
01:46:55,791 --> 01:47:02,047
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.
