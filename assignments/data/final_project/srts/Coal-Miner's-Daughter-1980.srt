00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,161
(Birds twittering)

2
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,886
(Coughing)

3
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:21,768
Fire! Fire in the hole.

4
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:24,146
(Distant voice) Fire in the hole!

5
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,735
(Explosion)

6
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:33,448
Let's get it, boys.
Always loads easy on payday.

7
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:37,869
(Steam train puffing)

8
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:13,238
(Klaxon)

9
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:21,246
Hi, Daddy. Look at your knee.
Why don't you wear your knee pad?

10
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,881
Loretty, that old shaft's so low,

11
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:27,843
you wear your knee pads,
you skin your back.

12
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:30,722
If you don't wear 'em,
you skin your knees.

13
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:34,015
I'll wear 'em tomorrow
and give my back a turn.

14
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:38,437
Boys, there ain't no place
this thing can't take me.

15
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,099
There ain't a creek she can't ford
or a hill she can't climb.

16
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:46,279
I know a thing she can't climb.
That heap of red dog.

17
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:49,406
I can climb that
in a by-God New York minute.

18
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,027
- Shit!
- Hey!

19
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:54,695
You boys watch your language
in front of these kids.

20
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:01,953
All right, does anybody wanna bet me
I can't climb that mess there?

21
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:04,875
- (Man) That pile up there?
- Hell yes! I can...

22
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:07,593
Oh, I'm sorry, little girl. Excuse me.

23
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,841
(2nd man) It can't be done.

24
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:13,587
I got me $25 that says I can do it.
Does anybody wanna bet me?

25
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:18,052
- (Murmuring)
- (Soldier) I'll take all of it.

26
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:20,725
Come on, kids. Let's get to the store.

27
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:23,809
(Both) Give the company
their money back.

28
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:27,478
Loretta, come on, honey.

29
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:30,733
(Men shouting out bets)

30
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,948
- Hi, Ted.
- Hey, Colin.

31
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:40,617
Who's that soldier boy
strutting around like a bantam rooster?

32
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:43,455
It's old man Red Lynn's boy. Doolittle.

33
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:47,632
Come back from the army
acting like a wild heathen.

34
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:51,838
He'll calm down a soon as they slap
a coal shovel in his hand.

35
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,630
- That Sears Roebuck order come in yet?
- I'll get it for you.

36
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:59,554
- (Engine revs)
- (Doolittle) All right.

37
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:02,889
Loretty, get you and Herman
a jar of Viennas.

38
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:18,283
(Crowd jeering)

39
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,000
(Miner) Get your mule, son.

40
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:27,129
Hey, Cousin Ted, come on in here
and get in on this bet, a sure thing.

41
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:30,707
Doolittle will never get up there
without rolling over.

42
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:49,150
(Engine straining)

43
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:56,152
(Gears grinding)

44
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:10,589
(Crowd booing)

45
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:14,844
Lord, that son of a gun Doolittle
don't know what quit means.

46
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:19,845
He sure went to a lot of trouble
to get on top of a pile of junk.

47
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:21,968
(Ted) Come on, Herman.

48
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:25,929
(Young boy) Mommy, Daddy's home!

49
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:28,104
(2nd boy) What's in that box?

50
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,148
(Ted) Something special.
Don't open it till we get inside.

51
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:36,029
(Children shouting excitedly)

52
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:43,070
(Woman) Y'all get washed up
before you come in.

53
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:46,373
Y'all hear your Momma?
Everybody go wash now.

54
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,088
(Gun being cocked)

55
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:57,424
Lee Dollarhide.

56
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:02,298
Come on in here, Doo.
I was just about to blast you one.

57
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:11,731
Old boy down at the store
said you wanted to see me.

58
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:13,935
Here, take you a sip.

59
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,280
OK, fellas.

60
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,445
- Donald Ray.
- Thanks, Daddy.

61
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,616
Jack. Hand that to brother Jack.

62
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,454
- Thank you.
- (Mother) Take the baby, Jack.

63
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,579
(Ted) How do they feel, gang?

64
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,872
Daddy, Peggy got two right feet.

65
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:36,130
- (Ted) What?
- Two right shoes.

66
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:39,711
(Ted) I'll be darned. Don't worry.
We'll get 'em changed.

67
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:42,433
- (Mother) How they feel?
- Loretta.

68
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:47,928
(Jack) Get your hands off.
Leave him alone, Donald Ray.

69
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,396
- (Baby crying)
- Daddy.

70
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:55,570
Hey, how come she gets
something extra?

71
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:59,231
Jack, Loretta's getting to be a woman.
Going on 14.

72
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,738
Women s'posed to have pretty things.

73
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:05,830
She ain't no woman.
She ain't nothing but a dadburned kid.

74
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:07,949
What are you, Herman?

75
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:12,162
(Kids laughing, door slams)

76
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,009
Remember when
you used to work for me,

77
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:29,519
- sell my goods at the mines?
- You paid a nickel for every jug I sold.

78
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:33,892
- How'd you like to work for me again?
- Not for no nickel a jug!

79
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,477
I'm talking about real money, Doo.

80
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,398
Business is good. I'm selling
more whiskey than I can make.

81
00:07:42,451 --> 00:07:46,318
I heard you'd been stealing some
from the boys in Greasy Creek.

82
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,447
Just when I run shy of my own.

83
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:55,202
I'm fixing to make me another run
on Greasy Creek.

84
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:57,580
You got that Jeep.

85
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,717
You know how to use a gun
and you can use you a job.

86
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,760
I'll go fifty-fifty with you.

87
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,928
Doo, if you're born in the mountains,
you got three choices -

88
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,266
coal mine, moonshine

89
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,725
or moving on down the line.

90
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:33,661
- (Song turns to static)
- Get your feet off!

91
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,459
Turn the radio off.
We can't afford no new batteries.

92
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:44,217
You got one of
your bad headaches again, Daddy?

93
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:46,469
Do you want me to mix
up some medicine?

94
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:48,840
It don't do no good. It'll pass.

95
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:53,470
- What you see in them grounds?
- (Ted) Loretty, take the baby.

96
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:57,520
I see a woman crying.
Looks to me like a man crying, too.

97
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,644
- Who are they?
- (Mouthing)

98
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,776
Loretty.

99
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:08,699
- What are they crying about, Mommy?
- Take the baby out and rock her.

100
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:12,031
Bad times is a-coming.

101
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:15,581
Well, we don't need no fortune-teller
to know that.

102
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,900
тЩк In the pines, in the pines тЩк

103
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:23,126
тЩк Where the sun never shines тЩк

104
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:28,218
тЩк And I shiver when the cold wind blows тЩк

105
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:32,641
тЩк The longest train тЩк

106

тЩк I ever saw... тЩк

107
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:41,317

108
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,481
тЩк The purtiest boy тЩк

109

тЩк In the pines... тЩктЩк

112
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,626
(Gunshot echoes across valley)

113
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:26,072
Good thing you wasn't working for him.
You'd be by his side.

114
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:27,573
I know that, Daddy.

115
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:32,077
Course if you had, at least you'd have
been working somewhere.

116
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:02,606
- (Fast bluegrass)
- (Clapping and whooping)

117
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,212
(Music stops)

118
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,214
(Woman) You're out.
That's all right, you did fine.

119
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:32,887
(Music restarts)

120
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:35,802
Get up and dance!

121
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:45,228
Preacher Banks was supposed
to be here to auction off these pies.

122
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:49,903
- He's sick and I...
- I can't take no time to auction no pies.

123
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:55,287
If these girls want to eat pies with a boy,
they'll do it if there's an auction or not.

124
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,861
I'll auction off them pies for you.

125
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:00,825
- You will?
- I sure will.

126
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:04,708
Six bits? Got six bits there.
Who's gonna bid a dollar?

127
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:06,996
- (Boy) I will!
- We got a dollar here.

128
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:10,749
It's a dollar one time.
Boys, that's a dollar twice.

129
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:13,340
That's sold right there for a dollar.

130
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,806
- Give me that dollar right there.
- Thank you.

131
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,526
All right, we got one pie left.
It's a chocolate pie belonging to...

132
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,479
Loretta Webb.

133
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,146
Who's gonna bid first?

134
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:37,285
- I bid two bits.
- Buddy, that's an insult!

135
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,623
Who's gonna start it off for a dollar?
Who'll give me a dollar, now?

136
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:47,254
I guess I get it, then.

137
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:51,710
- Heck, I'll bid a dollar, buddy.
- You ain't supposed to bid.

138
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,547
- A dollar once, a dollar twice...
- A dollar and a dime.

139
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:58,463
- Three dollars.
- That ain't fair, he's cheating!

140
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:01,553
- Three dollars once, twice...
- Three and a dime.

141
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:05,553
- Three seventy-five.
- Three seventy... seven.

142
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:08,312
(Laughter)

143
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,480
- Five dollars.
- (Crowd gasps)

144
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:17,403
(Quickly) Once, twice,
sold to Mr. Doolittle for five dollars.

145
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:24,741
Play in the house
and play in the sea

146
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:27,200
And when that pretty girl turns to me

147
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,210
Swing her high and swing her low

148
00:13:32,384 --> 00:13:34,460
Swing your partner, do-si-do

149
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:39,637
Takes that lamb
and takes that squirrel

150
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:42,553
Takes that pretty girl
round the world...

151
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:56,698
- Make a lot of chocolate pies?
- Not too many, except this one.

152
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,703
(Coughs)

153
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,329
How much salt did that recipe call for?

154
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:11,291
You don't put no salt in chocolate pie.
Just sugar and...

155
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:15,131
You must have got 'em mixed up.

156
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:19,386
Makes sense, though.
Salt and sugar both white.

157
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:28,182
(Square dance caller continues)

158
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:35,727
There ain't no sense in walking
when you can ride. Come on!

159
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,992
- I ain't gettin' in that.
- You ain't never rode in a car before?

160
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:43,653
That ain't no car.
It looks like something from Mars.

161
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:48,201
Mars? Gal, what the hell do you know
about Mars anyway?

162
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:52,878
I bet you ain't never been past
the mouth of this hollow.

163
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:57,798
- Come on, get in this thing.
- I said I ain't gettin' in it and I ain't!

164
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:00,845
If you like me so much,
you can walk me home.

165
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:06,225
Oh, Lord, them pies ain't the only thing
salty about you.

166
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:08,392
Wait! We'll walk it, then.

167
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:10,514
(Machinery hums)

168
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:17,650
The first time I ever seen you I said
me and that gal's gonna get together.

169
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:21,446
I saw you, too. In that little soldier suit.

170
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:24,696
I thought you looked just like
a toy soldier.

171
00:15:24,746 --> 00:15:28,197
I went ashore on D-day plus four and
I stayed until the damn thing was over.

172
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:32,081
I wasn't no little old toy soldier.

173
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:36,872
You know what D-day is, don't you?

174
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,759
- What?
- Never mind.

175
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,935
Tell you one thing
that army showed me -

176
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,683
there's a whole big world out yonder.

177
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:59,235
Showed me I ain't about to spend my life
buried in no coal mine, neither.

178
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,655
There ain't no damn future in it and
that's what I'm interested in - the future.

179
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:06,944
You got any plans for the future?

180
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:11,706
- Huh?
- Not that I know of.

181
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,375
- You sure cuss a lot.
- Yeah, I do.

182
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:17,794
Cuss, drink, chase wild women.

183
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,798
What? What are you doing?

184
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:24,255
I'm gonna kiss you good night.
Ain't you ever been kissed before?

185
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,273
Hey, Loretta?

186
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:45,277
I'm gonna bring my Jeep here
and take you for a ride.

187
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:47,449
You ain't gonna get that up here.

188
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:50,165
There ain't nothing I can't do, once I...

189
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:53,041
(Pigs squealing, dog barking)

190
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:59,538
(Mother) Loretty, honey,
take Peggy Sue in and feed her.

191
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:06,295
(Car approaching)

192
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,973
Stranger coming! Stranger coming!

193
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:13,728
Stranger coming!

194
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:18,607
Stranger coming!

195
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:21,987
(Mother) What is it?

196
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:31,404
I told you I'd get this thing up here.
You gotta take a ride with me now.

197
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,053
(Toots horn)

198
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:12,820
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey, Doo.

199
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:17,203
(Truck and Jeep blast horns in turn)

200
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:30,387
(Tyres squealing)

201
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:53,411
I can't breathe. I feel like I'm gonna faint.

202
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:56,455
- That's because you're in love.
- It is?

203
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,373
Yep.

204
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:06,131
(Dog barking outside)

205
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:12,466
(Jeep screeches to halt outside)

206
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,550
(Jeep engine revs)

207
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:22,641
Where have you been?

208
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:27,279
- Doolittle took me riding.
- What?

209
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:30,691
- Doolittle took me riding.
- Took you riding?

210
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:34,360
You just run off.
Didn't ask nobody or nothing.

211
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:37,413
Run off and worry everybody to death.

212
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:50,752
Y'all get to bed. Go on.

213
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:12,950
He'd rather cut off his arm
than have to whip you like that.

214
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:16,952
What you want
running off with that wild boy?

215
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,072
I love him, Mommy.

216
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,574
You do no such a thing.

217
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:27,621
Stay away from Doolittle or I'll give you
worse than what your Daddy did.

218
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:30,839
Get some salve for your legs.

219
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:15,386
Loretty, you know
I don't like to boss you

220
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,303
but I got to now, honey.

221
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:19,970
- Daddy...
- Just let me talk.

222
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:23,268
Doolittle's been up the house
every day this week.

223
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:25,804
- I don't want him hanging around.
- Why?

224
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:29,689
Cos you ain't got no business
hanging around with him.

225
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:32,939
You're just a little girl,
he's a grown-up man,

226
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:35,658
wild as the devil.

227
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,989
I love him, Daddy.

228
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:40,953
And he's a-wanting me to marry him.

229
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,078
You ain't even 14 yet.

230
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,498
- Y'all ain't knowed each other a month.
- I know.

231
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,625
But I love him.

232
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:57,010
Lord, Lord, don't do it, Loretty.

233
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:01,513
Don't throw all them young years away.

234
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,928
You're my pride, girl. My shining pride.

235
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,517
I just can't help it.

236
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:14,184
I can't.

237
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,952
(Boys chatting, indistinct)

238
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:31,000
(Man on radio)
<i>Presenting the Grand Ole Opry.</i>

- <i>Let her go, boys.</i>
- (Bluegrass)

240
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:37,968
Get up, Mommy. Do your squaw dance.

241
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:41,428
See if we can't get a smile
out of old sourpuss here.

242
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:45,139
- Yeah, come on, Momma.
- Come on, Clary.

(Doolittle) I knocked
but I reckon y'all couldn't hear me.

252
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,452
- Guess I broke up the party.
- It don't matter.

253
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:48,953
Come on and sit down.

254
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,039
Go on, Donald Ray.

255

Y'all get out or I'm gonna
knock the tar out of you.

256
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:58,798
- Why? We're playing chequers.
- Jack, go on.

257
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:01,879
- Say please.
- Herman?

258
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:05,298
Junior, come on, take 'em out. Please?

259
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:08,805
- Come on, let's go.
- Purty please.

260
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:13,931
Look here at this.

261
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:18,110
My gosh, Doo.

262
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:22,448
- Where'd you get all that?
- Paychecks. I've been saving.

263
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:25,861
You know what tomorrow is?
It's our anniversary.

264
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:28,663
Get a little closer.

265
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:30,782
Herman, I'm gonna kill you!

266
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:38,965
- What were you saying, Doo?
- Tomorrow is our anniversary.

267
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:42,294
I figured it'd be a good day
for us to get married,

268
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:45,014
especially since I got all that money.

269
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:49,431
(Sighs)

270
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,096
Go ask Daddy.

271
00:25:06,452 --> 00:25:11,529
Mr. Webb, me and Loretta is fixing
to get married if it's all right with you.

272
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,871
Tomorrow.

273
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,003
Go ask Clary.

274
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:40,310
Mrs. Webb, erm, me...

275
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:45,487
me and Loretty was thinking about
getting married...

276
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,324
tomorrow.

277
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:52,572
Go ask Ted.

278
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:07,504
(Herman) Where's lover boy?

279
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,758
Doolittle, what are you doing?

280
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,474
Ted said to ask Clary
and Clary said to ask Ted and...

281
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:18,392
- I don't know.
- Come on and sit down.

282
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:23,984
Wait'll they go to bed,
then you can catch them together

283
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,402
else they'll run you about all night.

284
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:29,991
Mr. and Mrs. Webb?

285
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:37,618
I know everything's happened real fast.

286
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:41,203
I know she's young,
I know how much y'all love her

287
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:44,339
but the deal is...

288
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:46,755
I love her too.

289
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:48,878
Just as much as you do.

290
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:54,215
I growed up real fast,
I seen a lot of the world.

291
00:26:54,268 --> 00:26:59,808
First time I seen that girl I said
that's all I'm ever gonna want out of life.

292
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:01,600
And I promise you

293
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:06,821
I'm gonna break my back
working to make her happy.

294
00:27:07,907 --> 00:27:11,323
I reckon y'all set on it
no matter what we say.

295
00:27:12,578 --> 00:27:16,790
I don't wanna go against y'all
but yes'm, we're set on it.

296
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:23,539
Two things I want you
to promise me, boy.

297
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:25,665
Don't you never hit her

298
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:30,252
and don't take her off
far away from home.

299
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:32,048
Yes, sir.

300
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:34,174
I promise you that.

301
00:28:02,878 --> 00:28:04,954
Wilt thou love her, comfort her,

302
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:07,710
honour and keep her
in sickness and in health

303
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:11,803
and keep thee only unto her
so long as you both shall live?

304
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:13,388
I will.

305
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:16,634
Loretta, wilt thou have this man
to be thy wedded husband,

306
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:19,471
to live together
in the holy estate of matrimony?

307
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,513
Wilt thy love him, comfort him,

308
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:24,600
honour and keep him
in sickness and in health

309
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,185
and keep thee only unto him
so long as you both shall live?

310
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:30,194
Mm-hm, yeah, I will.

311
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:33,573
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

312
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,158
I do.

313
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:40,281
Please join right hands.

314
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:47,921
The wedding ring is a visible sign
of an inward and spiritual grace

315
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:52,793
signifying the uniting of
this man and woman in holy matrimony.

316
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:55,217
Do you two have rings?

317
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:57,257
I ain't got no ring, Judge.

318
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:17,159
She'll warm up here in just a minute.

319
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:19,528
I got a present for you from Momma.

320
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:23,947
(Doo unzips trousers and urinates)

321
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:32,381
(Toilet flushes)

322
00:29:49,944 --> 00:29:52,861
Go on and get ready for bed,
baby, come on.

323
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:19,963
(Lorries passing outside)

324
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:30,809
You don't wear a nightgown
over your clothes.

325
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,267
I'm freezing, Doo.

326
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,481
(Laughs) Get on in there and take off
everything but your nightgown.

327
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:40,776
Go on, Loretty.

328
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:42,655
Go on!

329
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:44,781
Go. Go on, now.

330
00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:33,542
(Loretta) Don't do that. Don't!

331
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:37,669
- Doo, no!
- It's just a little rough the first time.

332
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:41,467
- Don't worry. Come on, baby.
- (Loretta crying out)

333
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:44,265
Hush, Loretty.

334
00:31:44,308 --> 00:31:47,807
(Gasping and sobbing) No! No.

335
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:20,586
This stuff's cold.

336
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,679
It froze between here and the restaurant.

337
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:26,965
You want a hot breakfast, go with me.

338
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:32,806
I ain't having all them people looking
at me knowing what we've been doing.

339
00:32:32,856 --> 00:32:37,933
Do you think this is something the rest
of the world ain't caught on to yet?

340
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,444
- It's a little rough the first time.
- Didn't seem too rough on you.

341
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:46,818
Get used to it cos a marriage...

342
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,331
I ain't gonna get used to you
getting on me and sweating like a pig!

343
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:59,210
You told Daddy you wouldn't hit me
and look at you already.

344
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:01,963
I'm sorry, Loretta, but you drove me to it!

345
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,848
(Train horn)

346
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,316
(Dog barking)

347
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,785
Hi, hon.

348
00:33:42,968 --> 00:33:46,717
Look here at this.
These radios are on sale real cheap.

349
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:50,014
- You reckon we could get us one?
- (Doo groans)

350
00:33:56,815 --> 00:34:00,730
Here, you read that.
Then we'll talk radios.

351
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,115
My gosh, Doo, this has got pictures in it.

352
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:13,989
(Muttering)

353
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:21,710
- (Whistles) Here, dog.
- (Dog barking)

354
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:36,851
Oh, Loretty, that there book...

355
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:42,860
That thing's helped
millions of people the world over.

356
00:34:42,903 --> 00:34:45,476
I thought it might do us a little good.

357
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:48,781
I can't read this.
It's got big old words in it.

358
00:34:49,827 --> 00:34:52,318
Look at this one. Look.

359
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:55,288
That dadgum word is a foot long.

360
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:58,701
What's a foot-long word
supposed to mean?

361
00:35:01,255 --> 00:35:03,331
(Doo groaning)

362
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:09,511
I don't need no book
to tell me what's wrong.

363
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:14,430
You just need to be more patient
and gentle with me, honey, that's all.

364
00:35:15,686 --> 00:35:17,974
I just need a little more time.

365
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:21,473
Give you a little more time.

366
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:25,190
Let me add up all these things
I have to give you more time on.

367
00:35:25,237 --> 00:35:28,487
You need a little more time
to learn how to cook.

368
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:32,861
You need a little more time
to learn how to clean the damn house.

369
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:36,411
Plus you need more time
to learn how to love your man.

370
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:39,790
Is there anything
you know how to do right now?

371
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:45,837
- When you gonna get me that ring?
- (Doo groans)

372
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:50,212
Stop making that noise.
You sound like an old bear growling.

373
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:55,090
Where are you going?
Doo, are you leaving?

374
00:36:02,274 --> 00:36:05,441
No, I ain't leaving.

375
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:11,940
(Peggy Sue)
Mommy, look who's here! Loretta!

376
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,028
(Loretta) Hi. Hi, Peggy.

377
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,950
- Hi.
- Look who's here, Dad!

378
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,075
Look who's here, Dad!

379
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:25,123
Hi, Mommy. Doo's throwed me out.

380
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:29,964
Thank the Lord. Maybe it ain't too late
to save you from ruining your life.

381
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,466
- Loretty, you home!
- Hi, Daddy.

382
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:36,682
I believe married life's making you fat.

383
00:36:38,477 --> 00:36:40,434
Oh, no.

384
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:43,480
(Girl) F, O, D...

385
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:45,397
Ready, Loretta?

386
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:51,896
The last time I seen you
was for a shot for the measles.

387
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:54,819
Now you're married.
How do you like it?

388
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:56,612
Fine.

389
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:02,076
Except me and Doo is separated.

390
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:07,118
Things happen pretty fast
between you and Doo, don't they?

391
00:37:25,732 --> 00:37:28,402
(Toots horn)

392
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,980
Hey!

393
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,865
(Doo) Hold up there.

394
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:38,531
(Woman) Hey, Doolittle, how are you?

395
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:41,532
- Good day, isn't it?
- It sure is.

396
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:45,330
- (Woman) What have you been doing?
- Working too damn hard.

397
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:48,212
- What about you?
- Hey, Doolittle Lynn.

398
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:51,789
Who's that sow wallowing in your Jeep?

399
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:55,709
- What did you call me?
- A sow. That's a woman pig.

400
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:06,346
Hi, Loretta, I just...

401
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,474
Hey, Loretta!

402
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:18,527
- I was fixing to come see you.
- Was you gonna bring your girlfriend?

403
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:21,946
She don't mean nothing.
I got something to tell you.

404
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:24,203
I got something to tell you too.

405
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:28,331
Loretta, I am leaving Kentucky.

406
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:32,791
I'm going to Washington
to get me a job on a ranch.

407
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,759
That damned coal mine's
got me buried alive.

408
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:39,847
- Was you just gonna leave me?
- Just till I get the money to send for you.

409
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,259
- What makes you think I'd come?
- You're my wife.

410
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:47,142
I'm your wife! You better think
of a better reason than that.

411
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:50,973
There ain't nothing for me
in Kentucky, Loretta.

412
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:54,644
Except a chest full of coal dust
and being an old man time I'm 40.

413
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:58,154
You ask your daddy.

414
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,651
'Sides that, you got to come with me,
I love you.

415
00:39:02,704 --> 00:39:05,789
You promised Daddy
you wouldn't take me off far.

416
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:10,790
You just have to decide
whether you're his daughter or my wife.

417
00:39:14,341 --> 00:39:17,425
Get in. I'll take you back to the house.

418
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:21,629
What are you doing in the bottom?

419
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:24,089
I come to see Doc Turner.

420
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:26,051
You sick?

421
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:28,475
Yeah, I'm gonna have a baby.

422
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:33,601
(Chuckles) Oh, Lord, Loretta.

423
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:39,321
Darlin', you might have found something
that you know how to do.

424
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:42,035
Stop! Don't go so fast!

425
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,244
(Chatting, indistinct)

426
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:08,389
It's from Doo! He sent me the money
to come to Washington.

427
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:26,617
She's late. Reckon she might have
jumped the tracks.

428
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:29,747
Oh, Daddy, them things don't do that.

429
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:34,666
- Do they?
- They've been known to.

430
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,045
Get up here. Let's see what you weigh.

431
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:49,142
117!

432
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:52,186
Boy, this baby's gonna be a big one.

433
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,433
- You weigh now.
- It wouldn't do no good.

434
00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:59,944
I wouldn't know how much was me
and how much was all that coal dust.

435
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:02,064
(Train whistle)

436
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,245
I ain't never gonna see you again.

437
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:14,410
Yes, you will, Daddy.

438
00:41:15,504 --> 00:41:19,418
Maybe. But I ain't never gonna see
my little girl again.

439
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:24,625
Them years has been robbed from me,

440
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:27,052
like a thief broke in and robbed 'em.

441
00:41:43,823 --> 00:41:52,163
(Woman on radio) <i>тЩк As I listen to
the words you are saying тЩк</i>

442
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:59,503
(With radio) тЩк It brings memories
when I was a trusting wife тЩк

443
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:08,254
тЩк It wasn't God

444
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:10,263
Thank you, Betty Sue.

445
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:17,271
тЩк As you said
in the words of your song тЩк

446
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:21,609
Ernest Ray, your Daddy is gonna
wear you out when he gets home.

447
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:26,114
(With radio) тЩк ... married men
think they're still single тЩк

448
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:36,500
(Doo) Y'all scared of the rain?
Let's go to work, boys.

449
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,007
(Doo) Come here, boy. Come here.

450
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:44,793
Daddy, Daddy!

451
00:42:44,843 --> 00:42:46,919
How you doing?

452
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,670
Hello, darlin'. Come here, baby.

453
00:42:52,934 --> 00:42:55,259
What did you do all day, baby?

454
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:58,312
I put up 17 quarts of this apple butter.

455
00:42:58,356 --> 00:43:00,894
And Doo, the dadgum sink stopped up.

456
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:03,564
I spent half the morning fixing that.

457
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:07,858
- (Ernest ray whining)
- Jack Benny, stop kicking him.

458
00:43:07,907 --> 00:43:11,691
Do you hear me? And then I had
that doctor's appointment.

459
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:16,737
It's a false alarm.
We'd better be a whole lot more careful.

460
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:19,828
Cover your mouth
when you're coughing.

461
00:43:19,878 --> 00:43:22,665
And then I come home.

462
00:43:22,714 --> 00:43:24,457
Eat, boy.

463
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:28,671
Betty Sue, you are not leaving this table
till you finish that.

464
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,255
- Sit up. Come here.
- Then I come home and cooked supper.

465
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:35,391
- And I'm about ready to die.
- (Kids chattering)

466
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:38,471
- How was your day?
- Wet.

467
00:43:42,942 --> 00:43:45,398
- Hey, Mooney!
- Yo!

468
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:49,110
Your momma called long distance
from Kentucky today,

469
00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:53,653
said happy anniversary
and why don't you call her more often.

470
00:43:53,703 --> 00:43:55,826
Much obliged.

471
00:43:55,872 --> 00:43:59,407
Why don't you have a phone put in
sometime, Mooney?

472
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:01,748
We don't like telephones.

473
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:09,875
(Loretta) тЩк The captain
he must have been drinkin' тЩк

474
00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:13,926
тЩк For he knew that he had done wrong тЩк

475
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:18,968
тЩк He was trying to win the record тЩк

476
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,350
тЩк When he let the Titanic go down тЩк

477
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,769
тЩк The children were cryin', "Dear Mother" тЩк

478
00:44:27,946 --> 00:44:32,193
тЩк Dear mother has gone to stay тЩк

479
00:44:32,242 --> 00:44:35,741
тЩк But maybe it'll turn to somethin'... тЩк

480
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:37,661
Close your eyes.

481
00:44:37,706 --> 00:44:42,284
тЩк That'll raise the Titanic some day тЩк

482
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:46,547
тЩк Do-do di-do-do do-do-do... тЩк

483
00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:49,377
(Singing more softly)

484
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:53,554
(Whispering) I was thinking,
we got an anniversary coming up,

485
00:44:53,596 --> 00:44:56,847
I was wondering
what kind of present you wanted.

486
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:02,428
I ain't got no wedding ring yet.

487
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,639
Wedding ring?

488
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:06,648
Bullshit.

489
00:45:06,693 --> 00:45:10,987
- Oh, bullshit!
- Doo! Jack Benny!

490
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,818
Now, go to sleep. You too, Jack Benny.

491
00:45:25,462 --> 00:45:27,917
(Sighs)

492
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:36,380
Happy anniversary, darlin'.

493
00:45:38,308 --> 00:45:40,550
It looks like you had a happy one.

494
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,518
You know, most couples spend
their anniversary together.

495
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:49,318
- (Strums guitar with foot)
- What's that?

496
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,776
Your anniversary present.
Happy anniversary.

497
00:45:52,822 --> 00:45:55,396
My anniversary present?

498
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:00,076
Sometimes I think you got a washer
missing in your brain. I can't play that.

499
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:03,870
Most people can't
without they learn how first.

500
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:06,918
You're not too ignorant to learn,
are you?

501
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:10,046
If you don't want it, I'll give it to the kids

502
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:13,090
or I'll put it in the kindling box.

503
00:46:13,134 --> 00:46:15,210
Give me that.

504
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:28,524
- What you get me a guitar for?
- Cos I like the way you sing.

505
00:46:32,737 --> 00:46:35,062
You really think I sing good?

506
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:37,191
Baby, I know you do.

507
00:46:39,536 --> 00:46:41,493
Can I have a present, too?

508
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:50,410
(Faltering)
тЩк Have I told you lately that I love you? тЩк

509
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:56,215
тЩк Have I... could I tell you once again тЩк

510
00:46:56,261 --> 00:47:00,305
- тЩк Some... how... тЩк
- (Children yelling)

511
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:07,060
If you boys knock Cissy off of this porch
one more time, I'll have to whup you.

512
00:47:07,105 --> 00:47:08,979
That's right.

513
00:47:09,023 --> 00:47:17,031
- (Washer gurgling)
- тЩк No... no... with all my... тЩк

514
00:47:17,073 --> 00:47:23,111
тЩк Heart and... soul how I adore you тЩк

515
00:47:23,162 --> 00:47:27,207
(Confidently)
тЩк Well, darlin', I'm tellin' you now тЩк

516
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,453
You boys stop fighting
and listen to me sing.

517
00:47:31,588 --> 00:47:37,092
тЩк This heart would break
in two if you refuse me тЩк

518
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:42,840
тЩк I'm no good without you anyhow тЩк

519
00:47:42,891 --> 00:47:49,143
тЩк Dear, have I told you
lately that I love you? тЩк

520
00:47:49,188 --> 00:47:53,732
тЩк Well, darlin', I'm tellin' you now тЩктЩк

521
00:47:53,776 --> 00:47:58,485
How about Saturday night let's get us
one of them baby-sitters and...

522
00:47:58,531 --> 00:48:00,524
go honky-tonkin'?

523
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:03,113
- You mean together?
- Yeah, together.

524
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:04,620
OK.

525
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:12,750
What are you grinning about?

526
00:48:12,795 --> 00:48:15,666
- (Doo sniggering)
- Doo!

527
00:48:17,383 --> 00:48:19,672
What are you up to?

528
00:48:20,845 --> 00:48:22,304
My Lord.

529
00:48:22,347 --> 00:48:24,672
(Lap-steel guitar from bar)

530
00:48:36,194 --> 00:48:40,607
I'll have one of them beers, please,
plus one Coca-Cola.

531
00:48:46,663 --> 00:48:50,826
- How about a dance, darling?
- I can't. I'm married.

532
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:54,209
Must not be too married,
you ain't wearing no ring.

533
00:48:56,464 --> 00:49:00,877
- I bet I know what this is all about.
- Oh, dang, you guessed it.

534
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,465
Wait right here, I'll be right back.

535
00:49:13,106 --> 00:49:16,023
I got something sitting
right on back there...

536
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:25,070
Come here, darling.
Come here, honey.

537
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:31,823
I'll be right with you.

538
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:42,751
Loretta!

539
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:47,013
What the hell are you doing running off?

540
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:50,508
Don't make me get up and sing.
Please, I'm sick.

541
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,142
- Oh, hell, the old boy wouldn't allow it.
- Thank the Lord.

542
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:58,482
- You have to audition tomorrow.
- I can't sing for no strangers.

543
00:49:58,526 --> 00:50:01,977
- Yes. I fixed it up already.
- You didn't ask me!

544
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:05,944
How can I ask you if you're hiding
like a stupid hillbilly?

545
00:50:05,992 --> 00:50:09,824
Don't call me that.
I may be ignorant but I ain't stupid.

546
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:14,782
- Why do you want me to sing anyway?
- I'm proud of you when you sing.

547
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:21,123
I'm glad I make you proud, honey,
but I can't sing in front of people.

548
00:50:21,174 --> 00:50:24,009
- I just can't.
- Yes, you can, baby.

549
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:27,717
You gonna sing for these old boys
in here in the morning

550
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:31,382
and next week you're gonna be
on that stage singing

551
00:50:31,434 --> 00:50:36,428
if I have to kick your stu... ignorant
hillbilly ass every step of the way!

552
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:45,483
And now we've got
a special treat for you.

553
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:50,952
Making her very first public appearance,
please welcome our new girl singer,

554
00:50:50,995 --> 00:50:53,403
Miss Loretta Lynn!

555
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:10,679
One, two, three, four, one.

556
00:51:10,723 --> 00:51:12,799
(Lap-steel introduction)

557
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:23,853
тЩк There he goes тЩк

558
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:28,647
тЩк He's walkin' away тЩк

559
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:33,402
тЩк And each step he takes тЩк

560
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,163
тЩк Brings heartache my way тЩк

561
00:51:39,335 --> 00:51:43,202
тЩк She's won his heart тЩк

562
00:51:44,298 --> 00:51:47,465
тЩк I lost him someway тЩк

563
00:51:49,512 --> 00:51:53,260
тЩк There he goes тЩк

564
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:57,008
тЩк He's walkin' away тЩк

565
00:51:59,355 --> 00:52:04,100
тЩк Oh, if I hadn't cheated тЩк

566
00:52:04,152 --> 00:52:08,695
тЩк And if I hadn't lied тЩк

567
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:14,278
тЩк I'd be the one тЩк

568
00:52:14,328 --> 00:52:17,365
тЩк Who's walkin' by his side тЩк

569
00:52:17,415 --> 00:52:21,163
тЩк I love him still тЩк

570
00:52:22,295 --> 00:52:26,127
тЩк And I guess it shows тЩк

571
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:30,710
тЩк The way that I feel тЩк

572
00:52:31,804 --> 00:52:35,422
тЩк As there he goes тЩк

573
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:42,513
тЩк Oh, if I hadn't cheated тЩк

574
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:46,349
тЩк And if I hadn't lied тЩк

575
00:52:48,237 --> 00:52:52,282
тЩк I'd be the one тЩк

576
00:52:52,325 --> 00:52:55,741
тЩк Who's walkin' by his side тЩк

577
00:52:55,786 --> 00:52:58,657
тЩк I love him still тЩк

578
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:04,374
тЩк And I guess it shows тЩк

579
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:08,921
тЩк The way that I feel тЩк

580
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:13,841
тЩк As there he goes тЩктЩк

581
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:30,643
- Darling, you were good.
- You got a big voice.

582
00:53:30,696 --> 00:53:34,279
(Man on stage) Would you like to hear
her sing another one?

583
00:53:34,325 --> 00:53:37,112
- Doo, they like me!
- They love you.

584
00:53:37,161 --> 00:53:41,574
They gonna love you a whole lot more
if you go and do another one.

585
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:43,332
Go on.

586
00:53:44,418 --> 00:53:48,961
(Loretta) тЩк So fill my glass up
to the top... тЩк

587
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:52,209
(Humming)

588
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:58,879
тЩк So fill my glass up to the... brim тЩк

589
00:54:00,101 --> 00:54:03,517
тЩк Da-dah da-da-da-dah... him тЩк

590
00:54:03,562 --> 00:54:07,560
тЩк I've lost everything in this world тЩк

591
00:54:07,608 --> 00:54:12,400
тЩк And now I'm a honky tonk girl тЩктЩк

592
00:54:12,446 --> 00:54:15,068
I done wrote myself a song, Betty Sue.

593
00:54:15,116 --> 00:54:17,274
Your Momma's a dadgum songwriter.

594
00:54:17,326 --> 00:54:19,864
- It's a nice song, Mommy.
- Thank you.

595
00:54:19,912 --> 00:54:23,744
(Doo) You can sing in every honky tonk
in the country -

596
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,741
there's thousands doing it
and they ain't getting nowhere.

597
00:54:27,795 --> 00:54:29,254
You need a record.

598
00:54:29,297 --> 00:54:34,124
The next step's even more important
and that's getting people to play it

599
00:54:34,176 --> 00:54:37,628
but right now
what you and me have to worry about

600
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,591
is you making the best doggone record
you can, it all depends on that.

601
00:54:43,602 --> 00:54:46,556
You know so much
about the music business.

602
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:50,306
I don't.
I'm just figuring it out as I go along.

603
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:53,603
It's just got three chords.

604
00:54:59,243 --> 00:55:01,816
Honey, what are you gonna sing for us?

605
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:05,915
She's gonna do a song she wrote herself
called Honky Tonk Girl.

606
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,414
Right. Honey, what key's it in?

607
00:55:08,461 --> 00:55:12,161
Y'all just play, she'll follow you just fine.

608
00:55:13,299 --> 00:55:16,300
- Go ahead and y'all just play.
- She does talk?

609
00:55:16,344 --> 00:55:19,179
Generally people
that can sing can talk.

610
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:22,139
She'll talk up a storm
if she feels like it.

611
00:55:22,183 --> 00:55:26,097
Y'all settle down, now.
Come over here and sit on my knee.

612
00:55:27,063 --> 00:55:31,440
You'll have a lot better view.
Boys, sit up big. Listen to your momma.

613
00:55:31,484 --> 00:55:35,149
(Engineer) Tape is rolling,
let's go for it. Take one.

614
00:55:35,196 --> 00:55:36,987
Three, four, one.

615
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:47,790
(Out of tune)

616
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,625
(Engineer chuckling)

617
00:55:49,668 --> 00:55:53,120
That's all right, don't worry.
We got a lot of tape.

618
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:56,043
All right, y'all get ready for take two.

619
00:55:56,092 --> 00:55:58,665
- Could you give us a minute?
- Sure.

620
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,795
Kids, come with me.

621
00:56:01,472 --> 00:56:03,928
I guess we're leaving now, so...

622
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:06,133
Put that thing back on.

623
00:56:06,185 --> 00:56:08,261
What are you doing in here?

624
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,852
Doo, what are you doing?

625
00:56:11,899 --> 00:56:14,853
Darling, I want you to sing to
these babies.

626
00:56:14,902 --> 00:56:17,737
- Sing to the babies?
- Just like at home.

627
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,856
Y'all sit in that green chair.

628
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:23,782
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

629
00:56:26,122 --> 00:56:30,119
- Three, four, one.
- (Guitar introduction)

630
00:56:35,464 --> 00:56:41,549
тЩк Ever since you left me
I've done nothin' but wrong тЩк

631
00:56:41,595 --> 00:56:47,468
тЩк Many nights
I've laid awake and cried... тЩктЩк

632
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:50,934
(Engineer) Hold it, little lady.
Just hang on a minute.

633
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,977
Let's take a break and see if
I can find a few more pickers.

634
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:57,184
I can't afford no more pickers.

635
00:56:57,236 --> 00:57:00,439
As bad as them two are,
what do you want more for?

636
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:04,534
I mean more better.
That little lady sings her hind end off.

637
00:57:07,872 --> 00:57:14,040
тЩк Ever since you left me
I've done nothin' but wrong тЩк

638
00:57:14,712 --> 00:57:19,919
тЩк Many nights I've laid awake and cried тЩк

639
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:27,756
тЩк We were so happy,
my heart was in a whirl тЩктЩк

640
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:31,308
Let's do this thing, darlin',
we ain't got all day.

641
00:57:31,353 --> 00:57:34,189
I ain't got all these doodads
sewed on yet.

642
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:36,603
I got to get to work. Come on, now.

643
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:39,651
It's just gonna be
your head and shoulders.

644
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:41,853
Get in front of the backdrop.

645
00:57:41,906 --> 00:57:43,779
- That bedspread?
- Yeah.

646
00:57:43,824 --> 00:57:46,232
Wait! I have to put on some lipstick.

647
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:49,286
I like you better natural.
Forget the lipstick.

648
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,746
- This zip's all rotten.
- Sit down there.

649
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:56,706
- Get up on the back of the chair.
- On the back of the chair.

650
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:04,887
Oh, that's gonna be purty.

651
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:09,176
I don't want you ever wearing
no make-up or none of that junk.

652
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:11,098
It ain't right.

653
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:14,594
- Here we go.
- Where should I look?

654
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:16,723
Look at heaven, baby.

655
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:20,772
Get out of there. I'm trying to take
your momma's picture.

656
00:58:22,196 --> 00:58:24,105
Thank you, baby.

657
00:58:24,156 --> 00:58:25,900
Smile.

658
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:30,113
Aw, beautiful.
That's just beautiful. That's it.

659
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:34,578
Put the backdrop back on the bed.

660
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,831
Are you and Daddy going out again?

661
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:39,249
Yes, I've got to sing over in Lynden.

662
00:58:39,296 --> 00:58:43,460
- Can I go with you?
- Oh, no, that's a rough old honky tonk.

663
00:58:44,802 --> 00:58:47,838
(Typewriter keys clacking, cock crowing)

664
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,325
Did you stay up all night again?

665
00:59:18,377 --> 00:59:20,583
I'll get me a nap later on.

666
00:59:20,629 --> 00:59:24,294
- Let me fix you some breakfast.
- I'll get a bite later.

667
00:59:24,341 --> 00:59:27,591
Be ready when I get home.
We gotta drive to Spokane.

668
00:59:27,636 --> 00:59:29,130
OK. Bye-bye.

669
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:31,468
(Betty Sue) Where's my egg, Mommy?

670
00:59:32,558 --> 00:59:35,227
I'm cooking it as fast as I can.

671
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:38,554
(Man outside) Loretty!
(Boy, laughing) Loretty.

672
00:59:46,238 --> 00:59:48,314
(Man) Loretty!

673
00:59:50,409 --> 00:59:52,865
Loretty!

674
00:59:56,457 --> 01:00:00,668
Long distance!
Your ma's calling from Kentucky!

675
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:03,284
Emergency, she said.

676
01:00:05,215 --> 01:00:08,881
(Old man) тЩк Amazing grace,
how sweet it sounds. тЩк

677
01:00:08,927 --> 01:00:15,677
(Congregation) тЩк Amazing grace тЩк

678
01:00:15,726 --> 01:00:21,764
тЩк How sweet it sounds... тЩк

679
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:24,057
(Old man) That saved a wretch like me.

680
01:00:24,109 --> 01:00:34,787
тЩк That saved a wretch like me... тЩк

681
01:00:34,828 --> 01:00:37,663
(Old man) I once was lost
but now I'm found.

682
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:42,748
- тЩк I once was lost... тЩк
- He come to me, Mommy, when he died.

683
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:47,583
- I seen him just as plain.
- тЩк And now I'm found... тЩк

684
01:00:47,633 --> 01:00:51,168
He wanted to be with you
and them grand-young'uns.

685
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,711
(Old man) Was blind but now I see.

686
01:00:53,764 --> 01:00:57,464
- Mommy, I shouldn't have left.
- тЩк Was blind тЩк

687
01:00:57,518 --> 01:01:03,521
тЩк But now I see... тЩктЩк

688
01:01:05,484 --> 01:01:08,319
I don't guess he ever got over
me taking her off.

689
01:01:08,362 --> 01:01:11,861
You did the right thing, Doo,
leaving here.

690
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:16,658
Anyhow, it's over and done now,
I reckon.

691
01:01:19,164 --> 01:01:21,834
No, it ain't, Doc,

692
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,951
it ain't never gonna be over.

693
01:01:24,002 --> 01:01:32,461
...we have already come

694
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:34,587
(Bulldozer chugging)

695
01:01:55,951 --> 01:02:00,909
I widened that trail. It ain't gonna be
so hard to get up here next time.

696
01:02:18,223 --> 01:02:21,177
This'll be covered in wildflowers
in six weeks,

697
01:02:21,226 --> 01:02:23,848
why are you bringing plastic ones here?

698
01:02:23,896 --> 01:02:27,312
Because they don't die.
The real ones just die.

699
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:31,063
- Darlin'...
- Like everything else.

700
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:35,863
Mommy's moving away, Daddy's gone.

701
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:39,858
I ain't gonna have no home.

702
01:02:39,912 --> 01:02:41,988
You got our home.

703
01:02:45,793 --> 01:02:47,869
Get away from me!

704
01:02:51,215 --> 01:02:53,291
Leave me alone.

705
01:03:07,189 --> 01:03:09,265
(Engine starts)

706
01:03:33,674 --> 01:03:36,378
Loretta, we gotta decide something.

707
01:03:39,012 --> 01:03:42,761
Most of them radio stations
we sent records and pictures to

708
01:03:42,808 --> 01:03:44,884
are in this part of the country.

709
01:03:44,935 --> 01:03:47,556
If we're really gonna do this thing,

710
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:51,436
we gotta go see 'em
and make sure they play that record.

711
01:03:51,483 --> 01:03:55,647
I talked to your momma
and she said she'd watch the kids for us.

712
01:03:57,489 --> 01:04:01,024
We gotta move right now,
you understand?

713
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:09,205
If you don't want it, I ain't gonna make
you do nothing you don't wanna do.

714
01:04:11,086 --> 01:04:14,621
We'll just go back
to what we was doing, that's all.

715
01:04:18,218 --> 01:04:20,294
- I want it.
- What?

716
01:04:20,345 --> 01:04:22,421
I said I want it!

717
01:04:22,472 --> 01:04:27,348
- Baby, I can't hear you!
- I wanna be a singer, Doo!

718
01:04:27,394 --> 01:04:29,470
I want it real bad.

719
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,598
I want it real bad.

720
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:37,857
Jack, you see that row of numbers?

721
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:42,068
That tells you how many miles
you've gone, how far we've been.

722
01:04:42,117 --> 01:04:44,952
I love you
and I'll see you when we come home.

723
01:04:44,995 --> 01:04:46,869
Come on, girl.

724
01:04:46,914 --> 01:04:48,990
- Mommy, I love you.
- I love you.

725
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,920
Betty Sue, you take care
of the little ones.

726
01:04:52,961 --> 01:04:55,333
Will you mind Grandma? OK?

727
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,417
Bye, Jack! Bye, Ernest Ray! Bye-bye.

728
01:05:01,386 --> 01:05:05,882
I left y'all some Tootsie Rolls
in the top drawer in the bedroom!

729
01:05:05,933 --> 01:05:07,890
- Bye-bye!
- Bye, Mommy!

730
01:05:07,935 --> 01:05:11,469
- Bye, Mommy!
- Come back, Mommy!

731
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:13,597
(Changing radio stations)

732
01:05:16,902 --> 01:05:21,279
(DJ) <i>Now here's that number one hit,
Walkin' After Midnight.</i>

Disc jockey name of Bobby Day.

735
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:29,700
Keep your eyes open for the transmitter.

736
01:05:29,748 --> 01:05:32,619
- The what?
- The transmitter.

737
01:05:32,668 --> 01:05:37,211
<i>тЩк ...always walkin' after midnight тЩк</i>

738

(Radio, car engine off)

742
01:05:56,858 --> 01:06:00,773
Dadgummit, Doo, wait a minute!
People can see in here.

743
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:03,987
- Hurry up, let's go.
- What do I say?

744
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:07,816
Don't even think about it, darlin',
just start talking.

745
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:15,746
...to see a weeping willow...
- (Knocking)

746
01:06:15,794 --> 01:06:18,546
Crying on his pillow

747
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:23,416
Maybe he's crying for me

748
01:06:23,468 --> 01:06:26,173
And as the skies turn gloomy...

749
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:28,926
I'm sorry, folks, no visitors allowed.

750
01:06:29,975 --> 01:06:32,548
Hi, Bobby. My name's Loretta Lynn

751
01:06:32,602 --> 01:06:37,514
and I sent you a picture
and my newest record on the Zero label.

752
01:06:37,566 --> 01:06:39,938
No kidding, you can't be in here.

753
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:44,523
It's a song I wrote
called Honky Tonk Girl.

754
01:06:44,573 --> 01:06:47,858
- I got the idea...
- I got it and I played it

755
01:06:47,909 --> 01:06:50,697
and it just sorta laid right there.

756
01:06:50,746 --> 01:06:53,746
So thanks for coming in, you all.
Bye-bye, now.

757
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,660
Bye-bye.

758
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:00,494
You're listening to Tri-State Country

Here's a word from our friends
down at Hutchins' Hot Pigs. (Snorts)

761
01:07:07,262 --> 01:07:09,800
Tell them all about it, Hutch.

762
01:07:09,848 --> 01:07:13,715
You played it? You ain't even took it
out of the wrapper.

763
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:19,522
You know how many records I get?
I don't have time to play all of them.

764
01:07:19,566 --> 01:07:21,642
Why did you lie to us?

765
01:07:21,693 --> 01:07:25,738
Why'd you say they didn't like us?
Doo worked so hard!

- Get her out. I gotta go on the air.

Heck, we got four babies
we had to leave home.

770
01:07:37,959 --> 01:07:41,874
We drove all the way here,
spent every last dime we had.

771
01:07:41,922 --> 01:07:46,714
- We got a treat for you here today...
- Now you're saying nobody likes it...

772
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,718
I can't believe it! I can't believe
you'd do something so mean as that!

773
01:07:51,765 --> 01:07:54,635

01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:29,656
She's on right now, she's on the radio!

908
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:32,486
Hey, buddy, could you turn the radio up?

909
01:16:32,535 --> 01:16:35,619
тЩк ...nothing but wrong тЩк

910
01:16:35,663 --> 01:16:40,824
тЩк Many nights I've laid awake and cried тЩк

911
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:45,707
тЩк We were so happy тЩк

912
01:16:45,757 --> 01:16:49,173
тЩк My heart was in a whirl тЩк

913
01:16:49,218 --> 01:16:54,639
тЩк But now I'm a honky tonk girl тЩк

914
01:16:57,602 --> 01:16:59,974
(Man) Hey, sweet thing!

915
01:17:00,021 --> 01:17:02,097
Sweet thing!

916
01:17:04,192 --> 01:17:06,315
How's that husband of yours?

917
01:17:06,361 --> 01:17:08,852
Trying to sober up to do his show.

918
01:17:08,905 --> 01:17:10,981
Turn the radio up, will you?

919
01:17:11,032 --> 01:17:14,199
Listen, I'm trying to hear the radio.
Turn it up!

920
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:16,569
He's got a wife on the Opry.

921
01:17:16,621 --> 01:17:20,571
Oh, is that right?
Hell, you got it made, man!

922
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:24,041
All you gotta do is count it
as the old lady rakes it in.

923
01:17:24,087 --> 01:17:26,163
I do my share. Turn it up!

924
01:17:26,214 --> 01:17:28,290
Sure you do, Hoss, sure you do.

925
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:31,674
I'm trying to hear my wife sing
on the radio.

926
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:35,468
Is that your job?
She sings and you listen? (Laughs)

927
01:17:39,227 --> 01:17:45,597
тЩк And now I'm a honky tonk girl тЩктЩк

928
01:17:50,196 --> 01:17:52,402
I'll be!

929
01:17:53,491 --> 01:17:55,697
Wonderful.

930
01:17:55,743 --> 01:17:58,234
Real wonderful, honey, thank you.

931
01:17:58,287 --> 01:18:02,202
By the way, you think you might
come back next week?

932
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,042
- I ain't got nothing else planned.
- She ain't got... OK, Loretta Lynn!

933
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:12,334
(Ernest) She's a doll, I'll tell you.

934
01:18:12,385 --> 01:18:14,045
Thank you, honey.

935
01:18:15,221 --> 01:18:17,759
Doo, did you hear? They loved me!

936
01:18:17,807 --> 01:18:20,974
They want me back next week,
can you believe it?

937
01:18:21,018 --> 01:18:25,727
I can. Now we gotta sit down
and plan what we're gonna do next.

938
01:18:25,773 --> 01:18:28,644
I'm too happy to think about that now.

939
01:18:28,693 --> 01:18:30,769
I don't care if I die tomorrow,

940
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:35,233
if I never sing another song,
it ain't never gonna be better than this.

941
01:18:35,283 --> 01:18:38,034
Did you hurt yourself?
Your jaw's swollen.

942
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:41,992
That's just from grinning,
that's from pure happiness.

943
01:18:42,039 --> 01:18:49,122
(Loretta) тЩк I fall to pieces тЩк

944
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:55,715
тЩк How can I be just your friend? тЩк

945
01:18:57,221 --> 01:19:03,473
тЩк You want me to act
like we've never kissed тЩк

946
01:19:04,604 --> 01:19:07,640
тЩк You want me to forget тЩк

947
01:19:08,733 --> 01:19:12,184
тЩк Pretend we've never met тЩк

948
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:17,694
тЩк And I've tried and I've tried тЩк

949
01:19:17,742 --> 01:19:20,447
тЩк But I haven't yet тЩк

950
01:19:21,537 --> 01:19:28,703
тЩк You walk by and I fall to pieces... тЩк

951
01:19:28,753 --> 01:19:32,453
Friends, this is a number one hit song
by Miss Patsy Cline.

952
01:19:32,548 --> 01:19:36,712
Y'all all know she's in the hospital
cos she's been in a car wreck.

953
01:19:36,761 --> 01:19:39,133
I wanna dedicate this song to her.

954
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:42,715
Patsy, if you're listening,
this song is for you.

955
01:19:46,771 --> 01:19:54,067
тЩк I fall to pieces... тЩк

956
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:01,571
Oh, thank you.

957
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:05,242
Loretta, Patsy Cline's husband.

958
01:20:05,289 --> 01:20:07,282
- Charlie Dick.
- Hello.

959
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:11,912
Patsy heard you, she wants you
to come and see her. Can you come?

960
01:20:11,963 --> 01:20:14,880
This is Charlie Dick,
Patsy Cline's husband.

961
01:20:14,924 --> 01:20:18,340
She was listening.
She wants to meet me. Can we go?

962
01:20:18,386 --> 01:20:22,549
Sure, go ahead. I'll take the young'uns.
Get your momma's guitar.

963
01:20:22,598 --> 01:20:24,757
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

964
01:20:24,809 --> 01:20:27,976
OK, honey,
Momma will be home soon. Bye-bye.

965
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,479
Bye, Mom.

966
01:20:29,522 --> 01:20:32,642
Patsy Cline... was listening? To me?

967
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:36,901
- Bye-bye, honey.
- Bye! See you later, Momma!

968
01:20:42,827 --> 01:20:45,365
Hey.

969
01:20:45,413 --> 01:20:48,829
Hey! Did you bring me that beer like I...?

970
01:20:51,168 --> 01:20:55,380
I keep my straw in the top drawer, honey,
right behind you.

971
01:20:55,423 --> 01:20:57,499
Right behind... top drawer.

972
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:03,046
It's right in there. Thank you.

973
01:21:03,973 --> 01:21:07,638
That's the one. Thank you.

974
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:15,725
What's the matter with you?

975
01:21:16,736 --> 01:21:20,568
Ain't you ever seen
no glamorous star before?

976
01:21:20,615 --> 01:21:23,651
You ain't mad at me
for singing your song, Patsy?

977
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:25,279
Mad?

978
01:21:25,328 --> 01:21:27,404
Sit down.

979
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:35,662
I'm scared because people might think
you sing it better than I do.

980
01:21:35,713 --> 01:21:40,174
- Uh-uh!
- You're stirring things up in this town.

981
01:21:40,217 --> 01:21:43,586
Hey. How many times
you been on the Opry now?

982
01:21:43,638 --> 01:21:45,844
Seventeen straight times.

983
01:21:47,558 --> 01:21:51,722
People wanna know who you been
sleeping with that you been on so much.

984
01:21:51,771 --> 01:21:54,012
Who's been saying that?

985
01:21:54,065 --> 01:21:57,599
Gals that sleep with everybody
and still ain't been on.

986
01:21:57,652 --> 01:22:00,439
- Like who?
- Let me put it this way,

987
01:22:00,488 --> 01:22:03,904
take it as a compliment,
you got 'em running scared.

988
01:22:05,368 --> 01:22:08,534
I can't believe I'm talking to Patsy Cline.

989
01:22:08,579 --> 01:22:13,371
(MC) Patsy Cline has been hospitalised
for several months now.

990
01:22:13,417 --> 01:22:17,166
We are happy to say she is here tonight
to sing for you.

991
01:22:17,213 --> 01:22:20,796
A Grand Ole Opry welcome
for Patsy Cline!

992
01:22:22,051 --> 01:22:24,803
(Man) You're looking hot tonight, girl.

993
01:22:33,104 --> 01:22:43,235
тЩк Sweet dreams of you тЩк

994
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:51,573
тЩк Every night тЩк

995
01:22:51,622 --> 01:22:55,951
тЩк I go through тЩк

996
01:22:57,003 --> 01:23:03,456
тЩк Why can't I forget you тЩк

997
01:23:03,509 --> 01:23:09,179
тЩк And start my life anew? тЩк

998
01:23:09,223 --> 01:23:14,466
тЩк Instead of having sweet dreams тЩк

999
01:23:15,563 --> 01:23:19,691
тЩк About you тЩк

1000
01:23:21,444 --> 01:23:27,696
тЩк You don't love me тЩк

1001
01:23:27,742 --> 01:23:30,908
тЩк It's plain... тЩктЩк

1002
01:23:30,953 --> 01:23:33,361
(Doo) Johnny didn't need any dogs...

1003
01:23:33,414 --> 01:23:36,249
(Woman) Great, Patsy!
(Man) Nice show, Patsy!

1004
01:23:36,292 --> 01:23:41,369
What y'all two devils been up to
besides getting into trouble?

1005
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:43,000
Delmar, two Co-Colas.

1006
01:23:43,049 --> 01:23:46,252
Mooney says he's gonna
take me squirrel hunting.

1007
01:23:46,302 --> 01:23:48,627
Don't you bring home no squirrels.

1008
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:52,973
When I left Virginia
I swore I'd never eat another squirrel.

1009
01:23:53,017 --> 01:23:57,311
I love squirrel meat.
Don't you like squirrel, Patsy?

1010
01:23:57,354 --> 01:24:00,640
Of course I do.
I married Charlie, didn't I?

1011
01:24:01,734 --> 01:24:03,810
Charlie, you know I love you.

1012
01:24:05,529 --> 01:24:10,690
Even if I have to remind him he ain't
nothin' but a damn tax deduction.

1013
01:24:10,743 --> 01:24:15,452
That goes for you too, Doolittle Lynn,
and don't you forget it.

1014
01:24:20,086 --> 01:24:24,035
- (Patsy) тЩк Is on us women... тЩк
- (Laughter)

1015
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:30,175
тЩк And it's not true
that only you men feel the pain... тЩк

1016
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:32,012
(Man) It's true, it's true!

1017
01:24:32,056 --> 01:24:35,923
тЩк Right from the start, most every heart тЩк

1018
01:24:35,976 --> 01:24:38,977
тЩк That's ever been broken... тЩктЩк

1019
01:24:40,147 --> 01:24:44,608
- Doo? You all right?
- Yeah.

1020
01:24:45,736 --> 01:24:47,978
Got you enough books?

1021
01:24:49,281 --> 01:24:51,357
(Carnival organ)

1022
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:55,579
(Fans chattering, indistinct)

1023
01:24:57,206 --> 01:24:59,614
- Have a look.
- She's not in there.

1024
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:01,576
Get down from there. Let me try.

1025
01:25:01,627 --> 01:25:03,785
(Thunder)

1026
01:25:04,922 --> 01:25:08,671
My Lord, Patsy,
I hope we don't get rained out.

1027
01:25:08,717 --> 01:25:13,011
You don't get rained out on circuits
like these, you just keep singing.

1028
01:25:13,055 --> 01:25:15,593
Mud, flood, hell or high water.

1029
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:18,097
(Man) Five minutes, Patsy.

1030
01:25:18,144 --> 01:25:21,809
- Looks like that's it for me.
- What else do you wear?

1031
01:25:21,856 --> 01:25:25,189
I start with liquid make-up
and powder that down.

1032
01:25:25,234 --> 01:25:28,685
Get ready cos I'm gonna call you up
after my first song.

1033
01:25:28,737 --> 01:25:30,196
OK.

1034
01:25:32,825 --> 01:25:36,194
(Fan knocking on window)
Somebody moving!

1035
01:25:36,245 --> 01:25:38,321
What did you do that for?

1036
01:25:38,372 --> 01:25:41,373
What have you got on your face?

1037
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:43,493
I just thought I'd try it.

1038
01:25:44,503 --> 01:25:46,543
- Do you like it?
- No.

1039
01:25:47,631 --> 01:25:50,205
Hell no. You know that I don't like it.

1040
01:25:50,259 --> 01:25:53,176
Get on back there and take it off.

1041
01:25:54,471 --> 01:25:56,797
- No.
- What?

1042
01:25:56,849 --> 01:25:59,007
Hey, now, wait a minute!

1043
01:25:59,059 --> 01:26:02,428
(Man) Loretta Lynn!
(2nd man) I'll be darned!

1044
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:10,686
тЩк I'm back in baby's arms тЩк

1045
01:26:10,738 --> 01:26:15,530
тЩк How I missed those lovin' arms тЩк

1046
01:26:15,576 --> 01:26:19,905
тЩк I'm back where I belong тЩк

1047
01:26:19,955 --> 01:26:24,035
тЩк Back in baby's arms тЩк

1048
01:26:25,211 --> 01:26:30,169
- тЩк Don't know why we quarrelled... тЩк
- (Man) I'm sorry...

1049
01:26:30,216 --> 01:26:34,712
тЩк We never did before тЩк

1050
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:38,510
тЩк Since we found how much it hurts тЩк

1051
01:26:38,557 --> 01:26:42,769
тЩк I bet we never quarrel any more тЩктЩк

1052
01:26:44,146 --> 01:26:46,933
- No good.
- How do you win a parrot?

1053
01:26:46,982 --> 01:26:48,774
Two out of three.

1054
01:26:50,402 --> 01:26:52,644
One...

1055
01:26:52,696 --> 01:26:56,030
One parrot. Let me know
when I run out of money.

1056
01:26:56,075 --> 01:26:59,241
Get away with every parrot you got.

1057
01:27:02,414 --> 01:27:07,325
- Where you stacking these?
- Put them next to the red trailer.

1058
01:27:07,378 --> 01:27:12,289
Let's move it up. I'm cold, miserable, wet,
I'm gonna lose my voice.

1059
01:27:14,134 --> 01:27:16,542
- Have you seen Doo?
- No, darling.

1060
01:27:16,595 --> 01:27:20,759
(Roadie) Put that in the corner
and put that big thing against it.

1061
01:27:22,559 --> 01:27:26,474
(2nd roadie) Anything else?
(3rd roadie) Yeah, this right here.

1062
01:27:27,606 --> 01:27:32,683
- Put them on top. That's it.
- Everybody, this bus is taking off!

1063
01:27:33,779 --> 01:27:36,650
If you wanna keep that arm,
get it off my husband.

1064
01:27:36,699 --> 01:27:39,865
- Who are you telling what?
- I don't know who you are.

1065
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:43,244
But I know what you are.
Doo, they're gonna leave.

1066
01:27:43,289 --> 01:27:48,365
If you was keeping your man satisfied
he wouldn't have to go nowhere else.

1067
01:27:48,419 --> 01:27:50,577
- (Bus horn)
- Doo, come on!

1068
01:27:50,629 --> 01:27:54,876
- (Driver) Loretta, let's go!
- Let me get my parrots, baby.

1069
01:27:57,970 --> 01:28:02,133
- (Bus horn)
- (Driver) Loretta!

1070
01:28:02,182 --> 01:28:03,725
Thank you.

1071
01:28:03,767 --> 01:28:05,226
(lnaudible)

1072
01:28:05,269 --> 01:28:08,139
(Horn honking repeatedly,
engine revving)

1073
01:28:08,188 --> 01:28:11,225
Why you in an uproar?
I wasn't doing nothing.

1074
01:28:11,275 --> 01:28:13,232
Yeah, I saw you doing nothing.

1075
01:28:13,277 --> 01:28:16,895
Darlin', I get lonesome,
I need somebody to talk to.

1076
01:28:16,947 --> 01:28:20,897
It didn't look like no talking to me.
I'm warning you, Doo...

1077
01:28:20,951 --> 01:28:24,154
I'd better not catch you
with trash like that again.

1078
01:28:24,204 --> 01:28:26,956
I mean it.

1079
01:28:26,999 --> 01:28:29,075
Warning me?

1080
01:28:29,126 --> 01:28:32,210
Goddamn, don't you ever
warn me about nothing!

1081
01:28:32,254 --> 01:28:34,413
You understand that?

1082
01:28:35,507 --> 01:28:37,583
Hear me talking to you?

1083
01:28:40,804 --> 01:28:42,880
You hear me talking to you?

1084
01:28:50,314 --> 01:28:53,315
тЩк Women like you, they're a dime a dozen тЩк

1085
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:56,276
тЩк You can buy 'em anywhere тЩк

1086
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,736
тЩк For you to get to him
I'll have to move over тЩк

1087
01:28:59,782 --> 01:29:02,486
тЩк And I'm gonna stand right here... тЩк

1088
01:29:02,618 --> 01:29:06,865
тЩк This is the chorus.
It'll be over my dead body тЩк

1089
01:29:06,914 --> 01:29:10,330
тЩк So get out while you can тЩк

1090
01:29:10,376 --> 01:29:15,666
тЩк Cos you ain't woman enough
to take my man тЩктЩк

1091
01:29:16,757 --> 01:29:19,544
Where the hell
did you get the idea for that?

1092
01:29:19,593 --> 01:29:21,052
Where do you think?

1093
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:26,756
(Chattering, indistinct)

1094
01:29:27,851 --> 01:29:29,927
Hey, Charlie!

1095
01:29:29,978 --> 01:29:32,600
(Patsy) Charlie!

1096
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:35,813
Wake up, Charlie.

1097
01:29:37,861 --> 01:29:41,776
- Where the hell you been?
- Shopping. Looks like you have too.

1098
01:29:41,824 --> 01:29:44,990
Get that crap off your face.

1099
01:29:45,035 --> 01:29:49,412
- I like it and it's stayin'.
- Hold on, Mooney, this is my idea.

1100
01:29:49,456 --> 01:29:53,786
- If I wanna wear make-up, I will.
- You'll do whatever I tell you.

1101
01:29:53,836 --> 01:29:55,413
I'll do just what I want!

1102
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:58,333
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Don't you hit me!

1103
01:29:58,382 --> 01:30:01,051
I'll whip your butt, girl! Goddamn!

1104
01:30:01,093 --> 01:30:04,711
Hey, hey. Come on, let's get in the car.

1105
01:30:04,763 --> 01:30:08,761
Charlie, get in the car and drive.
Loretta, get in!

1106
01:30:08,809 --> 01:30:11,098
Charlie, get in that car and drive.

1107
01:30:11,145 --> 01:30:14,679
(Man) That's Patsy Cline.
(Woman) That's Loretta Lynn!

1108
01:30:14,731 --> 01:30:16,808
- Damn!
- (Man) Hello, Patsy!

1109
01:30:21,822 --> 01:30:25,985
Ain't no chance of gettin' in
that goddamned car, hey, boys?

1110
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:29,946
(Squealing tyres)

1111
01:30:38,839 --> 01:30:40,713
(Car door slams)

1112
01:30:48,223 --> 01:30:50,893
Oh, my God. Did I do that?

1113
01:30:53,479 --> 01:30:55,555
Is it broke?

1114
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:05,487
Aren't you gonna talk?

1115
01:31:19,838 --> 01:31:24,880
Baby, I'm gonna get me a job,
driving a truck or being a mechanic,

1116
01:31:24,927 --> 01:31:27,003
doing something that I'm good at.

1117
01:31:28,138 --> 01:31:30,760
You're good at managing me.

1118
01:31:30,807 --> 01:31:33,215
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

1119
01:31:33,268 --> 01:31:37,017
Getting here's one thing
and being here's another.

1120
01:31:38,982 --> 01:31:41,853
My job's done,
I'll just get me another one.

1121
01:31:43,278 --> 01:31:45,983
Doo, if it's gonna break us up I'll quit.

1122
01:31:46,031 --> 01:31:48,736
Successful people don't quit, baby.

1123
01:31:53,747 --> 01:31:57,246
Got another one of your headaches,
don't you?

1124
01:32:00,045 --> 01:32:02,121
Just like your daddy.

1125
01:32:02,172 --> 01:32:04,959
Coal dust give him the headache.

1126
01:32:05,008 --> 01:32:07,499
I guess I'm what's giving 'em to you.

1127
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:18,309
Loretta.

1128
01:32:24,236 --> 01:32:26,988
Figured it was about time.

1129
01:32:44,548 --> 01:32:47,039
Doo.

1130
01:32:50,554 --> 01:32:54,338
(Radio) тЩк For you to get to him,
I'll have to move over тЩк

1131
01:32:54,391 --> 01:32:56,799
тЩк And I'm gonna stand right here тЩк

1132
01:32:57,894 --> 01:33:01,145
тЩк It'll be over my dead body тЩк

1133
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:04,523
тЩк So get out while you can тЩк

1134
01:33:04,568 --> 01:33:09,859
тЩк Cos you ain't woman enough
to take my man тЩктЩк

1135
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,615
I'm pregnant again, Patsy.

1136
01:33:15,662 --> 01:33:17,821
Are you sure?

1137
01:33:25,005 --> 01:33:27,578
I don't wanna have it.

1138
01:33:27,633 --> 01:33:30,124
I've been having babies since I was 14.

1139
01:33:31,219 --> 01:33:34,719
- What does Mooney think?
- He doesn't know.

1140
01:33:34,765 --> 01:33:38,299
Hey, c'mon, you oughta be happy.
I'm tickled.

1141
01:33:38,352 --> 01:33:40,677
We're gonna have a baby!

1142
01:33:40,729 --> 01:33:44,940
I'm gonna give you the biggest
baby shower in Nashville.

1143
01:33:44,983 --> 01:33:47,225
I want you to make a list.

1144
01:33:48,445 --> 01:33:50,521
Then we'll go shopping.

1145
01:33:50,572 --> 01:33:53,241
I saved all of my maternity clothes.

1146
01:33:53,283 --> 01:33:55,406
I got Randy's old things too.

1147
01:33:55,452 --> 01:33:57,990
You're gonna need all this, Loretta.

1148
01:33:59,498 --> 01:34:01,574
(Patsy) Ow!

1149
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:04,294
- You know, I forgot I had this.
- Oh, Patsy.

1150
01:34:04,336 --> 01:34:07,919
- Can you believe it?
- You scared me.

1151
01:34:07,964 --> 01:34:11,665
- Red drives men wild.
- That's just what I need.

1152
01:34:11,718 --> 01:34:15,253
You never know
when it'll come in handy.

1153
01:34:17,224 --> 01:34:21,056
Anything you can't find
we gonna buy when I get back.

1154
01:34:21,103 --> 01:34:24,721
- Where are you going?
- I got a benefit in Kansas City.

1155
01:34:24,773 --> 01:34:28,308
I didn't know I had that. Maybe I'll keep it.

1156
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:31,147
This'll take you through your fifth month.

1157
01:34:31,196 --> 01:34:34,399
- Are you sure I can have this?
- Take it.

1158
01:34:34,449 --> 01:34:37,201
I got something with your name on it.

1159
01:34:37,244 --> 01:34:39,616
I love that.

1160
01:34:39,663 --> 01:34:41,869
(Children laughing outside)

1161
01:34:41,915 --> 01:34:45,082
Oh, Patsy, I got to go.
Doo's waiting for me.

1162
01:34:45,127 --> 01:34:47,499
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1163
01:34:47,546 --> 01:34:50,167
All right, I'll call you on Monday.

1164
01:34:50,215 --> 01:34:52,089
- OK.
- We'll go shopping.

1165
01:34:52,134 --> 01:34:54,885
Anything we can't buy... we'll make.

1166
01:34:55,929 --> 01:34:59,179
- Anything we can't make, we'll steal.
- (Laughing)

1167
01:34:59,224 --> 01:35:02,344
- You take care of yourself.
- OK.

1168
01:35:02,394 --> 01:35:04,766
- Thank you, Patsy.
- Bye-bye, darling.

1169
01:35:04,813 --> 01:35:08,431
Take care.
I'm calling you first thing Monday.

(Patsy on radio) тЩк You don't love me тЩк

1171

Maybe you ought to slow down.

01:42:06,025 --> 01:42:08,563
If you slow down,
they forget about you.

1261

01:52:29,315 --> 01:52:34,522
a little girl, the next day I was married,
the next day I was having babies and...

1353
01:52:38,532 --> 01:52:41,450
next day I was out here singing for y'all.

1354
01:52:43,245 --> 01:52:45,534
And, uh...

1355
01:52:49,335 --> 01:52:54,127
Patsy was always saying,
"Little girl, you got to run your own life."

1356
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:01,803
But my life's running me and, uh...

1357
01:53:07,436 --> 01:53:09,180
Uh...

1358
01:53:14,693 --> 01:53:18,359
Where's my... Where's Doo?

1359
01:53:25,412 --> 01:53:27,370
Doo?

1360
01:53:28,666 --> 01:53:32,414
- Come on, let's go.
- (Mike thumps, feedback howls)

1361
01:53:35,589 --> 01:53:37,831
We've got you.

1362
01:53:42,763 --> 01:53:45,088
(Loretta groaning)

1363
01:53:47,309 --> 01:53:50,061
(Doo, softly) Come on, baby.

1364
01:53:50,104 --> 01:53:51,978
Baby.

1365
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:58,436
(Crowd murmuring)

1366
01:54:39,403 --> 01:54:41,479
(Birds twittering)

1367
01:54:56,045 --> 01:54:58,536
(Doo) Whoa, babies. Whoa, babies.

1368
01:54:59,632 --> 01:55:03,546
Whoa, babies, slow down, now.
Whoa, babies.

1369
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:08,304
Hey.

1370
01:55:08,349 --> 01:55:11,468
- I got something I wanna show you.
- What?

1371
01:55:16,106 --> 01:55:17,980
(Tyres squealing)

1372
01:55:18,025 --> 01:55:20,101
Slow down, Doo!

1373
01:55:33,082 --> 01:55:36,201
- What do you think?
- About what?

1374
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:40,166
What are you up to, Doo?

1375
01:55:40,214 --> 01:55:43,547
I'm gonna build us a house right here.

1376
01:55:45,761 --> 01:55:48,003
That's a hell of a view, ain't it?

1377
01:55:48,055 --> 01:55:52,302
I picked this particular spot
on account of from right in there

1378
01:55:52,351 --> 01:55:55,518
it looks a bit like Kentucky used to be.

1379
01:55:56,981 --> 01:56:00,812
Thought I'd put the bedroom
at the front of the house

1380
01:56:01,902 --> 01:56:06,694
so we can wake up and look out
and watch the sun come up.

1381
01:56:08,075 --> 01:56:12,452
Thought back here would be
a good place for a breakfast nook...

1382
01:56:12,496 --> 01:56:14,987
Dadgummit, Doo.

1383
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:18,207
You never asked me nothing
about no new house.

1384
01:56:18,252 --> 01:56:20,375
I wanted to surprise you, baby.

1385
01:56:20,421 --> 01:56:23,256
Well, stop surprising me.

1386
01:56:23,298 --> 01:56:26,252
You never ask me about nothing.

1387
01:56:27,928 --> 01:56:30,419
Hell, I thought you'd want a new house.

1388
01:56:31,515 --> 01:56:33,721
For the privacy if not for nothing else.

1389
01:56:33,767 --> 01:56:37,635
I ain't said I don't want no new house.

1390
01:56:37,688 --> 01:56:42,480
I just said you ain't asked me
nothing about it. You never do.

1391
01:56:42,526 --> 01:56:46,191
You just say, "Here's the deal,
take it or leave it!"

1392
01:56:46,238 --> 01:56:47,981
It's driving me crazy.

1393
01:56:48,032 --> 01:56:53,571
Hell, let's call the lawyers and get
a divorce. I'm tired of this bullshit.

1394
01:56:56,707 --> 01:57:01,333
I don't want no divorce,
I just want the bedroom in the back!

1395
01:57:03,797 --> 01:57:06,549
You put the dadgum bedroom
in the front

1396
01:57:06,592 --> 01:57:11,052
and the sun comes in every morning
at five o'clock and shines in my eyes.

1397
01:57:11,096 --> 01:57:13,172
How am I supposed to sleep?

1398
01:57:13,265 --> 01:57:18,260
You're not too ignorant to get up
and pull the blinds down, are you?

1399
01:57:18,312 --> 01:57:20,518
No, and I'm not too ignorant to know

1400
01:57:20,564 --> 01:57:24,609
that the bedroom don't belong
where the living room ought to be.

1401
01:57:24,651 --> 01:57:26,774
(Doo growls, Loretta mimics him)

1402
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:30,770
Stop growling, you sound like
an old bear or something.

1403
01:57:33,285 --> 01:57:37,449
All right, we'll put the bedroom
in the back of the house.

1404
01:57:40,417 --> 01:57:44,545
Let's not be too hasty, maybe we oughta
leave the bedroom in the front,

1405
01:57:44,588 --> 01:57:47,708
it's always been there
and it's purty here.

1406
01:57:47,758 --> 01:57:52,669
It's beautiful. We'll put a bedroom
in the back and one in the front too.

1407
01:57:52,721 --> 01:57:56,422
Great. Then we'll both have
our own bedroom.

1408
01:57:56,475 --> 01:58:00,686
No, I'm gonna be living in a tree house
up the hill there.

1409
01:58:04,733 --> 01:58:07,900
(MC) Ladies and gentlemen,
back with us once again,

1410
01:58:07,945 --> 01:58:11,479
the first lady of country music,
the coal miner's daughter,

1411
01:58:11,532 --> 01:58:13,608
Miss Loretta Lynn.

1412
01:58:15,285 --> 01:58:20,327
тЩк Well, I was born
the coal miner's daughter тЩк

1413
01:58:22,626 --> 01:58:27,786
тЩк In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Hollow тЩк

1414
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:33,299
тЩк We were poor but we had love тЩк

1415
01:58:33,345 --> 01:58:37,343
тЩк That's the one thing
my Daddy made sure of тЩк

1416
01:58:37,391 --> 01:58:42,765
He shovelled coal
to make a poor man's dollar

1417
01:58:43,939 --> 01:58:49,064
тЩк Daddy loved and raised eight kids
on a miner's pay тЩк

1418
01:58:51,363 --> 01:58:55,906
тЩк Mommy scrubbed our clothes
on a washboard every day тЩк

1419
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:02,285
тЩк Why, I've seen her fingers bleed тЩк

1420
01:59:02,332 --> 01:59:05,369
тЩк To complain there was no need тЩк

1421
01:59:05,419 --> 01:59:11,172
тЩк She'd smile in Mommy's
understanding way тЩк

1422
01:59:13,051 --> 01:59:19,137
тЩк In the summertime
we didn't have shoes to wear тЩк

1423
01:59:20,184 --> 01:59:25,344
тЩк But in the wintertime
we'd all get a brand-new pair тЩк

1424
01:59:27,524 --> 01:59:31,059
тЩк From a mail-order catalogue тЩк

1425
01:59:31,111 --> 01:59:34,812
тЩк Money made from sellin' a hog тЩк

1426
01:59:34,865 --> 01:59:40,286
тЩк Daddy always managed
to get the money somewhere тЩк

1427
01:59:41,371 --> 01:59:47,160
тЩк Yeah, I'm proud to
be a coal miner's daughter тЩк

1428
01:59:49,171 --> 01:59:54,414
тЩк I remember well
the well where I drew water тЩк

1429
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:59,673
тЩк The work we done was hard тЩк

1430
01:59:59,723 --> 02:00:03,341
тЩк At night we'd sleep cos we were tired тЩк

1431
02:00:03,393 --> 02:00:09,182
тЩк I never thought
of ever leavin' Butcher Hollow тЩк

1432
02:00:10,859 --> 02:00:15,817
тЩк Well a lot of things
have changed since way back then тЩк

1433
02:00:18,408 --> 02:00:23,782
тЩк And it's so good to be back home again тЩк

1434
02:00:24,957 --> 02:00:27,993
тЩк Not much left but the floor тЩк

1435
02:00:28,961 --> 02:00:32,246
тЩк Nothing lives here any more тЩк

1436
02:00:32,297 --> 02:00:38,632
тЩк 'Cept the memories
of a coal miner's daughter тЩк

1437
02:00:39,638 --> 02:00:42,045
(Applause)

1438
02:00:43,141 --> 02:00:50,389
тЩк They say to have her hair done
Liz flies all the way to France тЩк

1439
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:56,775
тЩк And Jackie's seen in a discotheque,
doing a brand-new dance тЩк

1440
02:00:57,364 --> 02:01:03,901
тЩк And the White House social season
should be glittering and gay тЩк

1441
02:01:05,122 --> 02:01:08,573
тЩк But here in Topeka, the rain is a-fallin' тЩк

1442
02:01:08,625 --> 02:01:12,160
тЩк The faucet is a-drippin'
and the kids are a-bawlin' тЩк

1443
02:01:12,212 --> 02:01:16,079
тЩк One of the them's a-toddlin'
and one is a-crawlin' and тЩк

1444
02:01:16,133 --> 02:01:19,003
тЩк One's on the way тЩк

1445
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:27,053
тЩк Ever since you left me
I've done nothing but wrong тЩк

1446
02:01:28,145 --> 02:01:33,483
тЩк Many nights I've laid awake and cried тЩк

1447
02:01:34,693 --> 02:01:41,360
тЩк We were so happy,
my heart was in a whirl тЩк

1448
02:01:41,408 --> 02:01:46,948
тЩк But now I'm a honky tonk girl тЩк

1449
02:01:48,165 --> 02:01:51,368
тЩк You come to tell me somethin' тЩк

1450
02:01:51,418 --> 02:01:55,001
тЩк You say I ought to know тЩк

1451
02:01:55,047 --> 02:02:01,132
тЩк That he don't love me any more
and I'll have to let him go тЩк

1452
02:02:01,178 --> 02:02:07,797
тЩк You say you're gonna take him
but I don't think you can тЩк

1453
02:02:07,851 --> 02:02:13,272
тЩк Cos you ain't woman enough
to take my man тЩк

1454
02:02:14,358 --> 02:02:17,976
тЩк Well, I like my lovin' done
country style тЩк

1455
02:02:18,028 --> 02:02:21,278
тЩк And this little girl
would walk a country mile тЩк

1456
02:02:21,323 --> 02:02:25,155
тЩк To find her a good ol'
slow-talking country boy тЩк

1457
02:02:25,202 --> 02:02:27,490
тЩк I said a country boy тЩк

1458
02:02:27,537 --> 02:02:30,953
тЩк I'm about as old-fashioned as I can be тЩк

1459
02:02:30,999 --> 02:02:33,834
тЩк And I hope you're likin' what you see тЩк

1460
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:38,419
тЩк Cos if you're lookin' at me тЩк

1461
02:02:38,465 --> 02:02:41,382
тЩк You're lookin' at country тЩк

1462
02:02:42,803 --> 02:02:46,006
тЩк Well, you've been
makin' your brags around town тЩк

1463
02:02:46,056 --> 02:02:48,973
тЩк That you've been lovin' my man тЩк

1464
02:02:49,017 --> 02:02:52,386
тЩк But the man I love,
when he picks up trash тЩк

1465
02:02:52,437 --> 02:02:55,723
тЩк He puts it in a garbage can тЩк

1466
02:02:55,774 --> 02:02:58,561
тЩк And that's what you look like to me тЩк

1467
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:01,564
тЩк And what I see's a pity тЩк

1468
02:03:01,613 --> 02:03:05,064
тЩк You better move your feet,
if you don't wanna eat тЩк

1469
02:03:05,117 --> 02:03:08,117
тЩк A meal that's called Fist City тЩк

1470
02:03:09,663 --> 02:03:12,664
тЩк Well, your pet name for me is "squaw" тЩк

1471
02:03:12,707 --> 02:03:15,661
тЩк When you come home drinkin'
and can barely crawl тЩк

1472
02:03:15,710 --> 02:03:19,755
тЩк And all that lovin' on me
won't make things right тЩк

1473
02:03:21,091 --> 02:03:24,258
тЩк Well, you leave me at home
to keep the tepee clean тЩк

1474
02:03:24,302 --> 02:03:26,840
тЩк A-six papooses to break and wean тЩк

1475
02:03:26,888 --> 02:03:31,301
тЩк Your squaw is on the warpath tonight тЩк

1476
02:03:32,477 --> 02:03:35,395
тЩк No, don't come home a-drinkin' тЩк

1477
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:38,108
тЩк With lovin' on your mind тЩк

1478
02:03:38,150 --> 02:03:43,986
тЩк Just stay out there, on the town,
and see what you can find тЩк

1479
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:46,782
тЩк Cos if you want that kind of love тЩк

1480
02:03:46,825 --> 02:03:49,779
тЩк Well, you don't need none of mine тЩк

1481
02:03:49,828 --> 02:03:55,866
тЩк So don't come home a-drinkin'
with lovin' on your mind тЩк

1482
02:03:57,085 --> 02:04:03,835
тЩк No, don't come home a-drinkin'
with lovin' on your mind тЩктЩк
