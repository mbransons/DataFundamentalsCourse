1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,330
I'd like to tell you a story about a guy,
a girl and a bathing suit.

3
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,160
I saw her at every swimming meet
the city ever had. Just like this one.

4
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,590
She was always lined up
with a group of other girls...

5
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,540
She stood out like a swan
in a bunch of mud hens.

6
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,910
I saw the starter take his place
and call, "Swimmers up."

7
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,150
She hit the water and cut through it
like a million-dollar yacht.

8
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,890
At the turn, it was neck and neck...

9
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,900
...but she soon pulled away,
away out in front.

10
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,700
And that's where she belonged,
out in front.

11
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,980
Well, she walked
to her dressing room on air.

12
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,150
And I went right after her.

13
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,620
Well, she knew me
and knew what I wanted...

14
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,790
...but the answer was still no.

15
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,990
I tried to convince her we could go
places together, but she wasn't interested.

16
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,300
She didn't wanna go any place but home.

17
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,530
She lived in a little apartment near the
college with all her trophies and her sister...

18
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,410
...a scatterbrained little chick
who had a lot to offer...

19
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,710
...but couldn't seem
to get anyone to take it.

20
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,410
I kept telling her the swimsuit business
was crying for us.

21
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,210
With my ideas and her face and ﬁgure,
we'd be a cinch.

22
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,720
She seemed interested, but was worried
about her amateur standing.

23
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,520
But I felt if I kept after her,
I'd make her realize...

24
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,460
...there comes a time in every woman's life
when she has to turn professional.

25
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,770
We started on a shoestring.
She was clever.

26
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,570
She designed and modeled her own suits.

27
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,180
They were new, different.

28
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,040
A little gag here, a little trick there.

29
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,940
And did they sell!
Say, she could sell anything.

30
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,090
The orders kept coming in
and pilling up...

31
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,850
...and we shipped them out
as fast as we could fill them.

32
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,820
Before you knew it,
we were in big business.

33
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,700
-So what?
-So what?

34
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,740
Everybody and his brother will be there.

35
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,240
Not to mention LIFE and Look
and the news services.

36
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,770
Sorry, I don't play polo.

37
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,640
Neither will the players when they get
a load of you parading around the pool...

38
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,040
...in that swimming spectacle
you're gonna stage.

39
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,880
-I'm going to stage?
-A tribute to our South American neighbors.

40
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,250
You're a good neighbor, aren't you?

41
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,450
Sounds like great publicity.

42
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,850
What about the club?
They're pretty conservative.

43
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,360
-I wonder if they'll go for it.
-They'll go for it.

44
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,120
As soon as you sell Mr. Cantord,
the club president.

45
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,900
Me? Oh, now, just a minute, Joe.
You're the barker of this outfit.

46
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,830
I'm just the trained seal.

47
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,410
You balance this ball
on that pretty nose of yours...

48
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,640
...and we'll both take a big, fat bow.

49
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,750
-Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go.
-Go where?

50
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,580
To Middlebrook, to meet
the South American polo team.

51
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,250
Oh, Betty, get that gleam out of your eye.
You're not going.

52
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,480
Oh, Evie, this is my chance
to meet a romantic Latin.

53
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,790
And a polo player
is what I've always wanted.

54
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,860
Yes, last year, it was a football player
you always wanted.

55
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,830
-The year before that, it was a cowboy.
-Well, l'm flexible.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,870
You're too flexible.

57
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,910
Well, this time, it's the real thing.
This time it's love.

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,540
Love. Oh, Betty.

59
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:21,010
Evie, you might as well face it.
I'm madly in love.

60
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,480
-With whom?
-The South American polo team.

61
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,450
Betty, dear, you've got to stop
throwing yourseIf at men.

62
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,530
-You're only going to get hurt.
-Not if my aim is good.

63
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,250
Besides, what's wrong
with a woman chasing a man?

64
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,950
Well, it just isn't done.

65
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,900
Men are men and women are women,
and, well, that's just the way it is.

66
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,330
Well, I don't wanna change it,
I just wanna get in on it.

67
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,600
If I don't stop dreaming
of orange blossoms...

68
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,730
...l'm gonna have to sleep
with a smudge pot at the foot of my bed.

69
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,010
-Are you hurt?
-No, not too bad. Just got my shoulder.

70
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,970
We've got a great masseur at the club.
Fix you up in no time.

71
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,270
Hey, Julio!
Call Jack Spratt, the masseur.

72
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,990
Who will be the lucky winner
on tonight's Stroke of Fortune...

73
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,950
...the quiz show to end all quiz shows?

74
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,180
You don't have to guess anything,
you don't have to say anything...

75
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,160
...and you don't have to know anything.

76
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,230
If you're lucky and have a telephone
and can answer our call...

77
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,160
...you will receive $1000
and other valuable prizes...

78
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,860
...if you're lucky and have a telephone.

79
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,300
And now, the wheel is turning.

80
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,410
While we're waiting for
the winning number, the orchestra plays.

81
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,810
Excuse, please, Señor,
you make with the massage?

82
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,950
-Not now. Come back later.
-But, Señor--

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,140
You want me to lose a thousand dollars?

84
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,840
This is an important program.
They give away prizes.

85
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,010
Last week there was an old maid
in Pomona...

86
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,490
...she won a 32-room house,
a four-door sedan...

87
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,890
...a live-bait barge
and a two weeks vacation...

88
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,550
...in a Tibet monastery,
with all expenses paid.

89
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,190
Oh, but, Señor, you better come with me.
Señor O'Rourke, she hurt his arm.

90
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,860
Her did? Señor O'Rourke,
you mean the captain of the polo team?

91
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,160
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

92
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,240
I wouldn't have won anything anyhow.
I listen to these quiz programs all the time.

93
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,280
of course, they never call me.
They-- Sort of a waste of time.

94
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
Sometimes those quiz programs
are not on the level.

95
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,720
Stop the music, stop the music!

96
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,050
-Long distance is ringing the winner.
-Probably some phony name.

97
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,520
-Mr. Jack Spratt of Clayport, California.
-Jack Spratt!

98
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,850
Whoever heard of anyone
named Jack Spra--?

99
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,090
That's me! They're ringing me!

100
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,290
-No answer yet?
-It's locked.

101
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,870
-Keep trying, operator.
-Oh, the key, the key.

102
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,600
-Don't stop ringing!
-You'd better hurry up, Mr. Spratt.

103
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,240
-Well, I can't find my key!
-This is your last chance.

104
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh, no, no, no!

105
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,440
Mr. Spratt doesn't answer?

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,570
Well, never mind, operator.

107
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,340
But Mr. Spratt
will receive our consolation prize...

108
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,250
...of five crisp, new $1 bills.

109
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,360
Five dollars? Five dollars.

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,190
You'll never know what I went through
to get all those phones.

111
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,960
Night after night in those phone booths.

112
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,660
I paid $30 for that radio,
a fortune in box tops.

113
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,270
Wore out two pair of pants
just sitting.

114
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,510
I lose half of my customers,
and what happens?

115
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,080
They call me and I can't even get in,
all on account of a little key.

116
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,490
A little key no bigger than--

117
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,160
Oh, no, no, no.

118
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,560
Oh, no, no, no.

119
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,350
Hey, mister.

120
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,340
-Where will I find the polo players?
-Oh, they are out on the polo field, I think.

121
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,730
Well, how do I get there?

122
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,170
Well, you go down this road
until you come to a--

123
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,440
No, no, you go down this road
until you come to a tree...

124
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,810
...and then you turn to the--

125
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,310
No, no.
You go down this road until you come....

126
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,580
Gee, I don't think you can get there
from here.

127
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,920
Well, aren't there any polo players
around here?

128
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,460
El capitan José O'Rourke
is in the tack room, I think.

129
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,290
Well, how do I get to the tack room?

130
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,560
Well, you go down this road
until you come to-- No, no, no.

131
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,260
-You go down this road until you come to--
-Oh, here we go again. Never mind.

132
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,830
Great country, South America.

133
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,270
You know, I've always wanted to meet
one of those black-eyed Señoritas.

134
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,710
The Señoritas right here
look muy bonitas to me.

135
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,870
Yeah, well,
they may look that way to you...

136
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,020
...but whenever I meet them,
they're always face-down on a table.

137
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,980
They only come to me to get them
in shape for some other guy.

138
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,590
-Can you keep a secret?
-Sure.

139
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,050
Well, I wouldn't like this noised around,
but I've never had a girl.

140
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,520
-No.
-See, my mother was very strict.

141
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,460
-Didn't have my first date till I was 24.
-Your mother wouldn't let you go out...

142
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,970
-...with members of the opposite sex?
-Yeah, but she wouldn't tell me...

143
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,930
...which ones was the opposite sex.

144
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,300
-I'll bet you've had plenty of girls.
-Too many.

145
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,270
Believe me, horses are more dependable.

146
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,470
of course, one cannot
make love to a horse.

147
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,910
No, unless one happens
to be another horse.

148
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,980
of course,
I don't have much choice myseIf.

149
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,680
You see, women don't like me,
and, well, I don't like horses, so....

150
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,980
Well, amigo,
maybe your approach is wrong.

151
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,680
Now, what is the first thing you do
when you get a woman in your arms?

152
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,350
Well, I give her a salt rub.

153
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,290
Oh, no, no, I'm talking about love.

154
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,460
The first thing you do is kiss her.

155
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,070
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.

156
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,300
Oh, don't tell me
you have never kissed a woman.

157
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,770
Well, have you ever held a woman
in your arms?

158
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,070
Have you ever held a woman's hand?

159
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,310
Well, have you ever--?

160
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,710
Oh, amigo, you are in bad shape,
aren't you?

161
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,320
-I don't know.
-But I will show you what to do.

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,050
First, you have a beautiful woman
in your arms.

163
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,160
You hold her tenderly.
Oh, she's gorgeous and she's all yours.

164
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,560
-She is?
-Oh, yes.

165
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,930
-Would you mind if I held her for a while?
-Of course. Here, you take her.

166
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,300
You know, she's heavier than I thought.

167
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,740
Now, you must say to her:

168
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,810
-Why do l have to speak Spanish?
-Because it's a language of love.

169
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,580
-Women can't resist it.
-They can't?

170
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,590
Now, hold her tight.
No, tighter. Still tighter. Tighter.

171
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,020
-She's kind of big.
-All right, kiss her.

172
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,360
No, not like a baby, like a man.

173
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,800
Oh, amigo, I like you.

174
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,130
And you have made my arm
as good as new. Well, hasta la vista.

175
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,640
Oh, in your language,
that means "adios, amigo."

176
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,010
Gee, he sure looks romantic
in that Groucho costume.

177
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,780
Gosh, anybody could get a girl
if he looked like that.

178
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,320
What a guy.

179
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,370
Señor O'Rourke.

180
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,630
Speak to me, say something.

181
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,340
Oh, gee, he's unconscious.
What'll I do now?

182
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,050
Oh, no, I gotta give him a chance
to defend himseIf.

183
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,850
Oh, Señor O'Rourke, I didn't know
you were behind that door, honest.

184
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,590
l wouldn't hurt a polo player for anything,
especially a South American polo player.

185
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,990
My name is Betty Barrett.

186
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,660
I hope you don't think I'm bold
for breaking in like this.

187
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,630
Gee, you're handsome.
Do you think I'm pretty?

188
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,140
You don't have to answer that now.

189
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,640
I live at the Savoy Apartments
and if you're ever in the neighborhood...

190
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,010
...you might drop in sometime. Tonight.

191
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,650
Oh, Señor O'Rourke!

192
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,360
-Is this all right, Miss Betty?
-Oh, yes, but they like it hot.

193
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,340
There, that's better.

194
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,070
Are you sure my sister's
not gonna be home this evening?

195
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,870
-Yes, I'm sure.
-Oh, I sure hope so.

196
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,570
No, I guess it'd be too obvious
if I sat on his lap.

197
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,700
-Will there be anything else, Miss Betty?
-I wish to be alone tonight, Matilda.

198
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,640
You may go.

199
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,070
Come in.

200
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,850
-Oh, José, what a surprise!
-I am delightful.

201
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,950
What a beautiful--

202
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,960
It's an old native custom.

203
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,390
Won't you sit down?

204
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,890
Oh, I do not understand so good
your language.

205
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,930
Well, sit down in your own language.

206
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,760
Merci, mademoiselle.

207
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,800
You understand Spanish good? Good.

208
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,810
Spanish is the beautiful language of love.

209
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,040
You speak it very fluently, don't you?

210
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,570
Tijuana.

211
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,880
Well, I wanna if you wanna.

212
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,350
My hors d'oeuvres. I prepared
some of our native dishes for you.

213
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,620
Oh, I am delightful.

214
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,700
My beautiful-- Sacramento, California.

215
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,570
-Well, don't go away, José. “Babalu.”
-“Tico-Tico.“

216
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,040
Well, if Spanish does it,
this ought to do it.

217
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,450
I made these just for you.

218
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,320
Oh, I am delightful. You made--

219
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,100
This thing,
I've lost so much weight, you know.

220
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,860
I made these
with my own two little hands.

221
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,440
Oh, your little hands.
They are so.... So.... So so-so.

222
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,870
Gee, just like in the ads.

223
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,480
You are so gentle, so beautiful, so....

224
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,520
Tell me more.

225
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,350
Tell me more.

226
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,470
Oh, that's beautiful.

227
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,730
You sound so different
when you speak Spanish.

228
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,740
You know, that's just the way
I feel about you.

229
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,170
And that means I want to hold you
in my arms forever.

230
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,310
And now, please, turn over.

231
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,040
Oh, that's an old South American
expression meaning...

232
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,840
...let's have some music.

233
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,620
Oh, that's beautiful.
Shall we dine or shall we dance?

234
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,890
-Well--
-Let's dance.

235
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,470
Oh, doesn't this music
do something to you?

236
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,750
Gee, members of the same lodge.

237
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,560
Argentina, Brazil or Nicaragua?

238
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,390
Oh, your friend here says
that he plays all the instruments.

239
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,740
How interesting.

240
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,710
Oh, nice. He has consented
to do a number for us.

241
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,250
-I hope you don't mind.
-Mind?

242
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,020
Oh, he'd love it.
I'll sing too. José, come on.

243
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we have a rare treat.

244
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,520
A countryman of mine from South America
is gonna do a number for us...

245
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,220
...accompanied
by his very charming companion here.

246
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,590
What would you like us to play?

247
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,860
Oh, yes. Go ahead.

248
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,340
The orchestra is yours.
Use any instrument you like.

249
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,020
I love those men who go:

250
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,530
Give me a South American drummer

251
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,900
And keep your butcher and your plumber

252
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,900
Oh, let me hear the fabulous fracas

253
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,740
of the maracas

254
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,040
Give me the guy who strums the guitar

255
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,380
An ocho cuatro to the bar

256
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,710
I'll even take the yoke

257
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,590
From Buenos Aires musicians' local

258
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,230
Who does the vocal

259
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,100
Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques
Babalu, Babalu.

260
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,500
I love those men who go:

261
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,510
They've warned me time and again

262
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:40,150
But, oh, how I love those men

263
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,390
Those men

264
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,390
Those men

265
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,100
Excuse me.

266
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,990
I love those men who go:

267
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,690
But, oh, how I love those men

268
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,770
-Did I wake you?
-Fine time to get home.

269
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,600
Fine time before I got home.

270
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,400
Where have you been, with whom,
and who said you could wear my coat?

271
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,370
Casa Cugat, José O'Rourke and nobody.

272
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,410
José O'Rourke? Not one of those
South American polo players?

273
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,040
Not just one of the players, the captain.
I hit the jackpot.

274
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:26,590
Betty, dear, can't you get in enough trouble
here without going below the border?

275
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,460
Look, Betty. Now, no one wants a nice,
substantial man for you more than I do...

276
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,970
...but these visiting firemen
are strictly on a joy ride.

277
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,430
Now, believe me, honey...

278
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,100
...when you fall hard and they exit laughing,
it's not going to be so tunny.

279
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,240
Oh, you've been out with them.

280
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,970
Certainly not.

281
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,710
But, Eve, he thinks I'm wonderful.
He says he's never met anybody like me.

282
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,510
That I believe.

283
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,710
-Betty, dear, you don't know this type.
-Yes, I do.

284
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,330
Tonight was just a buildup.
Next time, he'll show his teeth.

285
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,620
I love those men who go:

286
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,020
Betty, look, please.

287
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,100
Now, put down these animated beanbags
and listen to me.

288
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,530
I want you to promise
you won't see him again.

289
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,830
Nope. I got a date with him tomorrow.

290
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,500
I love those men who go:

291
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,000
Yes, I'll see that it's taken care of.

292
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,520
Of course. All right. All right.

293
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,080
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

294
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,250
-I received a telephone call this morning.
-Your name, please?

295
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,410
José O'Rourke.

296
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,790
Oh, yes, Mr. O'Rourke.
Miss Barrett's expecting you.

297
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,490
Miss Barrett? I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

298
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,230
If you'd just be seated,
she'll be back shortly.

299
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,490
She's showing some buyers
through the tactory.

300
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,540
Oh, could I join them? You see, I've never
seen a bathing suit in its natural state.

301
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,940
Oh, yes, of course.

302
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,740
-Miss Carroll.
-Yes?

303
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,970
-How far has the tour gotten?
-I think they're on the third floor.

304
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,480
Thank you. This way, Mr. O'Rourke.

305
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,780
-This way, please.
-Oh, yeah.

306
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,380
I usually make a rough sketch
of a new idea...

307
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,260
...and then give it to our artists
to retouch and refine.

308
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,400
The design is then put on the material...

309
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,230
...and the pattern is stamped
by these pattern machines...

310
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,800
...onto this special pattern paper.

311
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,070
They look a little like
old-tashioned piano rolls, don't they?

312
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,480
As you know, our bathing suits
are made of silk from China...

313
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:32,410
...rubber from Malaya, wool from Australia,
cotton from all over the world...

314
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,150
...and, of course, our own wonderful
synthetic rayons made right here.

315
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,420
And now, if we--

316
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,830
If you'll step this way, please.

317
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,230
I'd like to show you another
very interesting piece of equipment.

318
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,600
The spools of thread are putting together
a patchwork of colors...

319
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,770
...which revolve
into a beautiful harmony.

320
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,940
This strange-looking monster
is knitting swimsuit material of Celanese...

321
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,450
...rubber yarn, Lastex and Mattletex.

322
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,250
Now, those in the rear are set to handle
any type of material we intend to use.

323
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:19,520
We hang the pattern paper on,
tie the yar--

324
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,300
As l was saying....

325
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,350
The automatic blade cuts through hundreds
of thicknesses of material simultaneously.

326
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:40,450
See? And once the material is cut,
it is stacked in sizes ranging from 10 to 20.

327
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,950
You know, any woman over size 20
should have her bathing suit made to order.

328
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,650
Oh, I agree.

329
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,760
Shall we go on
to the finishing department?

330
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,460
And over there,
the girls are sewing the very first seam.

331
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,540
On this shaft back here, the girls
are working on the actual garment...

332
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,670
...sewing and finishing the neckline.

333
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,830
These girls are Mattletexing
the waistline for perfect fit.

334
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,910
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
you have seen the Neptune bathing suit...

335
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,750
...conceived, designed and created.

336
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,290
If you will kindly step into the salesroom,
you will see it come to life.

337
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,450
The Riviera suit.

338
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,900
The Christmas package.

339
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,810
The Ballerina.

340
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,220
The Sarong.

341
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,530
The Scotch Mist.

342
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,700
The Pantywaist.

343
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,820
The Olympic, for the sportswoman.

344
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,400
And now, the Streamliner.

345
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,480
Lovely, Miss Barrett. Perlectly charming.

346
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,680
Thank you. Thank you very much.

347
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:00,260
You'll notice that the suit
neither shrinks, sags nor stretches.

348
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,620
No, it doesn't, does it?

349
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,030
Would you mind telling me
what company you represent?

350
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,930
Oh, I'm in business for myself

351
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,540
Would you mind turning around
for me, please?

352
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,430
-Well, no, not at all, Mr...?
-O'Rourke. José O'Rourke.

353
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,970
-Did you say O'Rourke?
-Yes.

354
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,170
Lotus, my robe, please.

355
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,750
Mr. O'Rourke,
would you mind stepping into my office?

356
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,150
-I won't keep you waiting long.
-Oh, Miss Barrett, for you, I'd wait forever.

357
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,320
Lotus.

358
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,170
Mr. O'Rourke,
you're exactly what I anticipated.

359
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,900
You have the advantage.
I anticipated nothing like you.

360
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,210
You no doubt have some idea
why I sent for you.

361
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,710
No, but I assure you I'm delighted.

362
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,150
Does the name Barrett
mean anything to you?

363
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,010
No, not yet, but I have a feeling it will.

364
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,090
-What can I do for you, Miss Barrett?
-You can stay away from my sister.

365
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,160
-Your sister?
-I have plans for my sister.

366
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,590
Worthwhile plans.

367
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,250
And I don't intend to see them disrupted
by a South American detour.

368
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,960
Oh, forgive me,
I don't understand this word “detour.“

369
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,830
Allow me to explain.

370
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,700
To detour is to take the bad road
because the good road is unavailable.

371
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,280
But, Señorita Barrett,
l am not unavailable.

372
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,870
And now, will you break the date
with my sister?

373
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,610
Date? Well, l....

374
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,510
You have a date with her tonight.
Will you please break it?

375
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,190
Very well. If I must, I must.

376
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,290
Good. Thank you very much.

377
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,290
However, there is a slight condition.

378
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,220
I thought so. Well, how much?

379
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,230
Oh, it isn't money I want.

380
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,770
No? What do you want?

381
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,330
Merely that you consent to go
in your sister's place.

382
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,000
Me? Why, you're out of your mind.

383
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,540
Oh, not at all, just a little lonesome
after I put my horses to bed.

384
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,380
Mr. O'Rourke...

385
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,510
...your state of mind after you tuck
your horses in is hardly any of my concern.

386
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,220
I'm sure you can find some other
misguided female to take their place.

387
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,560
Oh, undoubtedly, but you see,
I am particularly drawn to your family.

388
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,170
So if I cannot go out with you, l....

389
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,500
You realize, of course,
that this is just another form of blackmail.

390
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,510
Oh, Señorita Barrett,
in my language, there is no such word.

391
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,420
If I go with you, will you promise
never to see my sister again?

392
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,450
I promise.

393
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,450
Very well, it's a deal.

394
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,860
Oh, Señorita Barrett, your spirit
of seIf-sacrifice is truly admirable.

395
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,620
-Where shall I pick you up?
-This address, 8:00.

396
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,390
-Good. Oh, do you have a car?
-Of course.

397
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:58,770
Oh, then we will go to dinner,
drive along the ocean.

398
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,270
There'll be a moon tonight. I'm sure
you can show me many points of interest.

399
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,900
Mr. O'Rourke, I will show you
the most miserable evening of your life.

400
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,840
Oh, I don't think so.

401
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,710
Oh, there is just one more question.
How do I get this contraption off my finger?

402
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,450
It's very simple.

403
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,720
On this side, we have the oldest
avocado trees in Southern Calilornia.

404
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,660
Over here, you will observe
a small inlet known as Pirates' Cove.

405
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,060
Around the bend, there is--

406
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,300
Miss Barrett, I don't care
what's around the bend, really.

407
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,630
You've shown me Pirates' Cove
with no pirates...

408
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:38,270
...lnspiration Point with no inspiration
and Lovers' Lane with no love...

409
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,710
...so I will take you home now.

410
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,310
Thank you very much.

411
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,680
Why are we slowing down?

412
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,650
And don't you tell me we're out of gas.
It's my car, remember?

413
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,520
Look.

414
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,590
Quote, “to detour
is to take the bad road...

415
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,730
...because the good road
is unavailable,“ unquote.

416
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,130
-Did I say that?
-Yes.

417
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,560
You also insinuated
that l was a blackmailer...

418
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,070
...and several other unpleasant things.

419
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,940
Well, I'm sorry. But, well,
Mr. O'Rourke, please try to understand.

420
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,670
My sister Betty
is somewhat of a problem.

421
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:19,250
She needs to find a man that's substantial
and settled and, well, safe.

422
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,720
And I am not?

423
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,580
Well, are you?

424
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,160
No. No, I am unsubstantial,
unsettled and definitely unsafe.

425
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,160
But not for your sister, no.

426
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,630
Don't worry, Miss Barrett.
I'll keep my end of the bargain.

427
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,890
Thank you very much, Mr. O'Rourke.

428
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,970
Jose, please.

429
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,930
Jose.

430
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,500
-And now if you'll take the road to the left--
-Of course.

431
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,540
Oh, do you mind if we stop
at the stable a moment?

432
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,780
My best pony has been rather ill.
I would like to look in on her.

433
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,250
No, not at all.

434
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,450
I'll only be a second.

435
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,690
She is very beautiful in the moonlight.

436
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,630
Julio, tonight, I want you to play
like you've never played before.

437
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,030
Patron, l have serenaded
beautiful Señoritas...

438
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,170
...all over the world for you
and l have never failed you.

439
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,540
And tonight, I won't fail you.

440
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,250
Oh, I'm afraid my pony's worse.
I'll have to sit up with her all night.

441
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,650
Oh, I'm sorry.

442
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,310
-Would you care for a cigarette?
-No, thank you.

443
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,720
-Your horses mean a great deal, don't they?
-Oh, yes, Señorita.

444
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,130
When they suffer, l suffer.

445
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,110
-What's that?
-Oh, just some of the stable boys.

446
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,340
They play at the drop of a sombrero.

447
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,520
Do you know what the music is saying?

448
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,990
l have an idea.

449
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,330
I think maybe we'd better be going.

450
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,070
My heart beats faster, faster

451
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,800
Faster and faster

452
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,810
At the sight of you

453
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,120
My heart beats faster, faster

454
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:17,790
Faster than I have ever felt it do

455
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:26,070
You bring me madness, madness

456
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,670
Beautiful madness every little while

457
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,150
When you pass by

458
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,360
And you smile

459
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:56,660
My heart beats faster, faster

460
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,810
Not its own master

461
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,140
When I hear your voice

462
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:12,080
My heart hears music, music

463
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,080
Music for dancing

464
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,690
And it has no choice

465
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,800
And if I never kiss you

466
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:32,300
Tell me, what can my poor heart do?

467
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,840
But just beat faster and faster

468
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,880
Until it breaks

469
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,520
In two

470
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,570
There, that's better.
How does it feel, Linda?

471
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,500
Fine, unless I breathe.

472
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,580
Miss Felligi, we ought to have it a little
lower here and a little bit higher there.

473
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,470
-Right.
-Eve, I've gotta talk to you.

474
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,810
Oh, come on in, Joe. I'll just be
a moment. That's all. Thank you.

475
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,350
-I'll take care of the sketches, Miss Felligi.
-Yes, Miss Barrett.

476
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,580
-Where were you last night?
-Where were you this morning?

477
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,220
l was getting over last night.

478
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,620
I spent three hours with the president
of the club waiting for you.

479
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,460
-And you waited in the bar.
-Can I help it if he likes television?

480
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,070
I'm sorry, Joe.
I had something else to do.

481
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,600
Oh, I suppose last night
wasn't important.

482
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,760
Well, of course it was, Joe,
but, well, this was personal.

483
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,300
Oh, personal, eh?

484
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,110
Joe, lower your eyebrows.
l'm strictly a career gal.

485
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,150
The only interest l have in men is whether
or not they whistle at our bathing suits.

486
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,580
You know that.

487
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,850
Oh, now you're talking.

488
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,080
You know, honey, love has ruined more big
business than the Sherman Antitrust law.

489
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,630
Unless, of course, one partner
happens to be in love with the other.

490
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,530
l have a picture of Sears
falling in love with Roebuck.

491
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,030
That's not what I meant.

492
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,790
I'll pick you up at 8:00 sharp.

493
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:15,240
And this time, my little wet-foot, l'll deliver
you to the president of the club personally.

494
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,400
Yes, master, yes.

495
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,140
Matilda, where's my little white coat?

496
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:25,980
Last time I saw it, it was going
through that door on Miss Betty.

497
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,750
Oh, I see. Where was Miss Betty going
when she went through the door?

498
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,190
To the other door.
Said she had to get out before you got in.

499
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,120
Well, do you know where she was going?

500
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,750
l wouldn't fill out an affidavit,
but I have an idea.

501
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,300
l eavesdropped a phone call.

502
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,960
-To whom?
-A Mr. José O'Rourke.

503
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,570
Said she'd meet him
at his apartment tonight. Alone.

504
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,170
Matilda, are you sure?

505
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,440
Sure, I'm sure. I heard it
with my own two little pierced ears.

506
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,140
Well, that scheming, calculating....

507
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,700
-Miss Barrett. What an expected pleasure.
-I'll bet it is.

508
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,430
Well, where is she?

509
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,440
-Who?
-My sister Betty, of course.

510
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,510
-Oh, is she loose again?
-You know perfectly well she is.

511
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,340
Don't tell me that she isn't here,
because I know she is.

512
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,280
-Miss Barrett, I gave you my word, I--
-Your word.

513
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:33,080
-What does your word mean?
-Oh, to me it means a great deal.

514
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:39,550
Why don't you sit down,
have a nice drink and cool off, huh?

515
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,660
Mr. O'Rourke, I wouldn't drink with you
if you were the last man on earth.

516
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,130
Well, what an interesting possibility.

517
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,030
Will you tell my sister
to come out of your closet?

518
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,540
There is nothing in my closet
except a few suits...

519
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,200
...one of which is minus a button.

520
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,810
At home, we have a skeleton.

521
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,310
-She's probably under the bed.
-I suggest you look.

522
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,180
I intend to.

523
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,440
You know, in my country,
that practice is confined to old maids.

524
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,680
-Your button.
-Would you like to sew it on?

525
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,090
Oh, would you care for a shower?

526
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,860
Shirts, shorts, pajamas
and miscellaneous.

527
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,800
Very, very funny. What about
the other door, the one in the living room?

528
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,870
-Miss Barrett, please.
-I thought so.

529
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,310
-Well, one would think you didn't trust me.
-And one would be so right.

530
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,410
-Now, kindly step aside.
-Miss Barrett, I am a gentleman.

531
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,450
Step aside.

532
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,180
Very well. You win.

533
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,680
-Well, you do have a date with her?
-With your sister? No. Believe me.

534
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,520
Now, I will take it as an apology...

535
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,990
...if you sit down
and have that drink with me. All right?

536
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,360
I'm sorry.

537
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,570
I'm not that sorry.

538
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:12,580
A lovely lady, soft music...

539
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,410
...a warm summer's evening.

540
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:20,220
You know, for an evening
that started out so badly...

541
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,290
...it has definite possibilities.

542
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,820
No, no, no, before you drink,
you must always say, ”Salud.”

543
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
You know, I--

544
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,110
-You know, on second thought--
-Yes?

545
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,340
-I really can't stay
-But, baby, it's cold outside

546
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,820
-l've got to go away
-But, baby, it's cold outside

547
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,460
-This evening has been
-Been hoping that you'd drop in

548
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,250
So very nice

549
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,090
l'll hold your hands
They're just like ice

550
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,700
-My mother will start to worry
-Beautiful, what's your hurry?

551
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,230
-My father will be pacing the floor
-Listen to the fireplace roar

552
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,600
-So, really, I'd better scurry
-Beautiful, please don't hurry

553
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,260
-Well, maybe just a haIf a drink more
-Put some records on while I pour

554
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,310
-The neighbors might think
-But, baby, it's bad out there

555
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,850
-Say, what's in this drink?
-No cabs to be had out there

556
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,610
-I wish I knew how
-Your eyes are like stars right now

557
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:24,220
-To break the spell
-l'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

558
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,620
-I ought to say, ”No, no, no, sir”
-Mind if I move in closer?

559
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,290
-At least I'm gonna say that I tried
-What's the sense of hurting my pride?

560
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,160
-I really can't stay
-Oh, baby, don't hold out

561
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:38,570
-But it's cold outside
-Baby, it's cold outside

562
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,670
-I simply must go
-But, baby, it's cold outside

563
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:52,210
-The answer is no
-But, baby, it's cold outside

564
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,820
-The welcome has been
-How lucky that you dropped in

565
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,790
-So nice and warm
-Look out the window at that storm

566
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,260
-My sister will be suspicious
-Gosh, your lips look delicious

567
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:06,920
-My brother will be there at the door
-Waves upon a tropical shore

568
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,500
-My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
-Gosh, your lips are delicious

569
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,970
-Or maybe just a cigarette more
-Never such a blizzard before

570
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,200
-l've got to get home
-But, baby, you'd freeze out there

571
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,710
-Say, lend me a comb
-lt's up to your knees out there

572
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,640
-You've really been grand
-l thrill when you touch my hand

573
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,340
-But don't you see?
-How can you do this thing to me?

574
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,010
-There's bound to be talk tomorrow
-Think of my lifelong sorrow

575
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,560
-At least there will be plenty implied
-If you caught pneumonia and died

576
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,590
-I really can't stay
-Get over that old doubt

577
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,830
-But it's cold outside
-Baby, it's cold outside

-Mind if I move in closer?

592

00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:01,140
-So nice and warm
-Look out the window at that storm

599
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,870
-Your sister will be suspicious
-Gosh, your lips look delicious

600
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,180
-Your brother will be there at the door
-Waves upon a tropical shore

601
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:11,790
-Your maiden aunt's mind is vicious
-Gosh, your lips are delicious

602
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,120
-Maybe just a cigarette more
-Never such a blizzard before

603
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,420
-You've got to go home
-But, baby, I'd freeze out there

604
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,730
-l'll lend you my comb
-lt's up to my knees out there

605
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,560
-You've really been grand
-l thrill when you touch my hand

606
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:29,070
-But don't you see?
-How can you do this thing to me?

607
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,570
-There's bound to be talk tomorrow
-Think of your lifelong sorrow

608
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,110
-At least there will be plenty implied
-If l caught pneumonia and died

609
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,680
-You really can't stay
-Get over that old doubt

610
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:42,380
-But it's cold outside
-Baby, it's cold outside

611
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,390
I called for Eve that night
and waited a couple of hours for her.

612
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,500
But she never showed.

613
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:07,110
Well, it was too early to go home,
so I dropped in at Cugie's.

614
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,570
The joint was really jumping.

615
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,710
I fought my way to the bar and sat down.

616
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,550
But this time I was smart.
This time, I stuck to the soft stuff.

617
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,690
Through the mirror I saw Lukie,
the owner of the club, bearing down.

618
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,090
I'm one of the few people who like Lukie.

619
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,490
Maybe he deals under the table
once in a while...

620
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,960
...but he always gave me
a square shuffle.

621
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,860
He tried to buy me a drink,
but I wasn't having any.

622
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,200
Then he asked me the $64 question:

623
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:38,360
Where's the mermaid tonight?

624
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,970
She stayed at home.
She has a little headache.

625
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,510
Too bad. Don't look natural
to see you here without her.

626
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,710
Well, I'll probably drop in
on the way home and see how she feels.

627
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,380
Well, you can save yourself a trip.

628
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,290
She's evidently feeling better.

629
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:08,070
-Nice-looking guy, if you like the type.
-And I don't.

630
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:09,990
Shall we?

631
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,270
-Do you know him?
-Only by reputation.

632
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:20,580
José O'Rourke,
the famous South American polo player.

633
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,180
A 10-goal man.

634
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,910
-That's good?
-You bet it's good.

635
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,850
He's the whole team. Subtract him...

636
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,580
-...they haven't got a chance of winning.
-Winning what?

637
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,350
The big polo match at Middlebrook.

638
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:33,720
-Don't you read the papers?
-Only the race results.

639
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,420
Big game, eh? Any good bets around?

640
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,860
Lukie, this is a polo match,
strictly society stuff.

641
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,830
Fifty bucks is tops in the locker room.

642
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,870
Fifty bucks? That's birdseed.

643
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,640
I bet that on traffic signals.

644
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,940
So this guy is the whole works, eh?

645
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:53,670
Without him, they haven't got a chance?

646
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,340
-What else do you know about him?
-Nothing.

647
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,480
Except he's dynamite with the ladies,
undoubtedly out to feather his nest.

648
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,890
Right now, he's unfeathering mine.

649
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:11,100
You know, I never dreamed this morning
I'd hold you in my arms this evening.

650
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,430
The only reason
I'm in your arms this evening...

651
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,190
...is so my sister Betty won't be.

652
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,200
Oh, and all the time
I thought it was my charm.

653
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,760
Our song, remember?

654
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,060
Jose, how wonderlul to see you again.

655
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:46,760
The minute I heard the music,
I thought of you.

656
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,870
Remember?

657
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,570
Lovely thing. The music.

658
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:58,370
Jose, darling, how cute of you
to have them play our song.

659
00:54:58,550 --> 00:54:59,780
-Remember?

660
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,970
He has it played at the drop of a Señorita.

661
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:05,680
Let's sit down, shall we?

662
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:10,120
Señor O'Rourke.

663
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,700
-She just said that--
-I know.

664
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:18,960
“Our song. Remember?“

665
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,230
I'm sorry, Señor,
but this is a table for two.

666
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,890
This was a table for two.

667
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,970
Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Backett.

668
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,510
-Mr. Backett is a dear and old friend.
-Very old.

669
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,740
-I aged 10 years waiting for you.
-Joe, please, I'll explain later.

670
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,440
-Why should you?
-Well, Mr. Backett is my partner.

671
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,850
Well, it's a wonder you're not bankrupt.

672
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,350
Please, no.

673
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,920
Now, look, I happen to have a date
with Miss Barrett this evening...

674
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,820
...and I don't want anybody to annoy her.

675
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,990
I had a date with Miss Barrett first,
and who's annoying her?

676
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,130
You both are. Now, please, sit down.

677
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,270
-I'm sorry, Señorita, I apologize.
-Well, I don't.

678
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,700
And there are a few other things
I'd like to say.

679
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,740
Say them to me on the dance floor, then.

680
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,400
Come on. Excuse us, please.

681
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,750
What do you mean
by creating such a scene?

682
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,080
“Creating a scene,“ she says.
She stands me up last night.

683
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:14,020
I call for her tonight, she's not there.
No message, nothing.

684
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,820
I come to the Casa Cugat
alone, friendless.

685
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,830
-And sit in the bar.
-I had nothing but salted peanuts!

686
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:25,260
I wonder, worry, I grieve.

687
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:28,400
-I'm just about to call the morgue.
-Oh, Joe....

688
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:32,170
When in she comes
on the arm of a professional guest.

689
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:37,710
-José is not a professional guest.
-Wait till the check comes around.

690
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,750
I go to your table.
I sit down like a gentleman.

691
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,410
This mallet-wielder insults me.

692
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:48,280
I try to delend mysell
and I'm accused of creating a scene?

693
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,190
-Joe, please.
-Doesn't our business...

694
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,420
...our friendship, mean more to you
than this Romeo from the Amazon?

695
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,590
Joe, I can explain,
if you'll let me get a word in.

696
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:02,170
-He's not a Romeo, he's--
-Oh, really?

697
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,340
The man means absolutely nothing to me.

698
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,040
The reason I came out with him...

699
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:14,710
...was to keep him away from Betty,
and he knows that.

700
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,370
She's crazy about him.

701
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:18,710
She would follow him
right across the border...

702
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,880
...if I didn't nip this thing in the bud.

703
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,360
-Now, do you understand?
-Knowing your sister, I'd say maybe.

704
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,290
And you're not going to see him again?

705
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,760
-No, of course not.
-Good. Let's get out of here.

706
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,960
You've got a busy day
at the office tomorrow.

707
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:35,760
Well, Joe, it's early yet,
and I can't just walk out--

708
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,670
Take me home, Joe.
Get my things, would you, please?

709
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,110
So this will be
the best game of the season.

710
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,910
-Now--
-Excuse me.

711
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,910
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

712
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,610
-Don't let it bother you.
-Of course not.

713
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,260
Know anything about polo?

714
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:10,900
-What's his first name?
-No, no, it's a game.

715
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,510
Very fast. Played with a mallet and a ball.

716
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,630
-Oh, you mean croquet.
-No, you dope.

717
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:20,080
Now, listen, and get this straight.

718
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,880
Go out to the Middlebrook Country Club
tomorrow...

719
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,710
...and pick up a polo player
named José O'Rourke.

720
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:28,450
-Bring him here.
-Suppose he don't wanna come?

721
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,150
Persuade him.

722
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:34,260
You know, boss, sometimes
I hardly know what you mean.

723
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,090
Hey, Julio, is José O'Rourke around?

724
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:41,030
Oh, no, Señor. He is out on the polo field.

725
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,760
He will be back soon, I think.

726
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,740
Well, I'll wait in the--

727
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,880
-He's pretty good, ain't he?
-Oh, that is nothing, Señor.

728
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:04,180
-Come out here, I show you a good trick.
-Really?

729
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,530
Hey, Gonzales.

730
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,560
-What's he gonna do?
-Knock the cigarette out of your mouth...

731
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:13,890
...with the whip.

732
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,800
-Out of whose mouth?
-Oh, do not be afraid, Señor.

733
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:21,140
He never misses. With one flip of
the whip, he will cut the cigarette in half.

734
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:24,210
Yeah? I'll make it easier for him. There.

735
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:27,250
Okay, he do it with half a cigarette.

736
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,350
-Are you sure he can do this trick?
-Sure.

737
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,950
-He does it with my brother all the time.
-Yeah?

738
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,550
I'd like to see him
do it with your brother first.

739
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,820
Okay. Hey, No Nose!

740
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:41,330
No Nose? I'll see you in the tack room.

741
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:46,500
Hey, Pancho,
where does José O'Rourke hang out?

742
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,200
The tack room.

743
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,270
Gee, thanks, Mr. O'Rourke.

744
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,810
You know, that gaucho suit
worked for me too.

745
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,310
I got a girl now. She kind of likes me too.

746
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,070
I hope you don't mind,
but you know who she thinks I am?

747
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,440
-José O'Rourke?
-That's right, how did you know?

748
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:06,750
Gosh. Pardon me,
we're in the midst of a conversation.

749
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,980
-Okay, buddy, let's go.
-Let's go where?

750
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,220
-Never mind, just get going.
-Here, don't push me, Mac.

751
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:14,390
-Come on, get going.
-I said, don't push me.

752
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,160
Now, I dare you to do it again. I dare you.

753
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:20,100
Say, you take directions nicely,
don't you?

754
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,630
Look, I ain't got all day.
Lukie wants to see you.

755
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,170
Lukie? Lukie who?

756
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,770
Lukie Luzette, that's who.

757
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,040
You mean the fella,
the guy, the one--?

758
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,510
Yeah, all three.

759
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:36,040
-Oh, what does he want with me?
-He don't tell me his business.

760
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,910
He said, bring in José O'Rourke.
So I'm bringing you in.

761
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,610
Oh, you've got the wrong fella.
I'm not José O'Rourke.

762
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,690
-I'm Jack Spratt.
-And I'm Little Bo Peep.

763
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,660
-Quit stalling.
-No, I wouldn't fool you, honest, I wouldn't.

764
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:49,990
I'm not a South American.
Look, no accent.

765
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,530
Now, wait a minute, now.

766
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,100
South Americans are always
tall, dark and handsome.

767
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:56,500
-I'm a little bitty redhead.
-Oh, no, you don't.

768
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,760
Here, put me down.

769
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,910
Look, ask anybody.
They'll tell you I'm not José.

770
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,210
José. José, darling.

771
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,680
Hey, somebody who knows you.

772
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,510
-Oh, no. No.
-Get her in. Tell her to come in.

773
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,520
Oh, there you are, darling.

774
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,210
Guess that means we're engaged.

775
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:17,980
Oh, aren't you gonna say something?

776
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,690
Oh, I know. You're speechless with joy,
I can see it in your eyes.

777
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,800
Oh, I can hardly wait
for the day when I'll be Mrs. Jo--

778
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:29,730
What's the matter? Aren't you happy
about my being Mrs. Jo--?

779
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:34,370
Darling, you do want me to be Mrs. Jo--?

780
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,670
You keep that up,
you're gonna have a slap-happy wife.

781
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:40,310
And I want you to be proud
when people point us out...

782
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,920
...and say, “There go the newlyweds,
Mr. and Mrs. José O'Rourke.“

783
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:49,890
I'll tell Eve about it tonight.

784
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,960
I'd tell her now,
but she's rehearsing the girls at the pool.

785
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,330
Oh, I forgot. My engagement ring.

786
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:00,660
I bought it today.
You'll get the bill for it tomorrow.

787
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,340
Well, l have to go now.

788
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:07,870
I think I go with you.

789
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,370
Well, come on, if you're coming.

790
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:13,070
Well, something seems
to be holding me back.

791
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,650
What's the matter?
Is there something on your mind?

792
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:20,480
-Well, not exactly.
-Well, then I'll see you at the pool.

793
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,450
<i>La traviata</i>.

794
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,950
Here. Here.

795
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:28,860
So she's gonna marry you
and become Mrs. Jo--

796
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:33,230
-Hey, get going.
-Okay.

797
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,050
Oh, pardon me, Madam.

798
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:06,120
Hey, did you see a redheaded guy
go by here? Which way did he go?

799
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,730
-Albuquerque.
-Albuquerque.

800
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,840
Albuquerque?

801
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,800
-Well, kids, what's new?
-This is a cute little number.

802
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:41,600
All right, now, girls.
Come on, we're gonna try it again.

803
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,370
Betty, you put the record on
and count it out, would you?

804
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,910
-Okay.
-Come on, gals.

805
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,940
Get into positions. Line up.

806
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:55,580
Get them started.
I'm gonna work out new formations...

807
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,780
-...before we try in the water.
-All right.

808
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,780
Ready, go.

809
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:02,950
Backstroke, two, three...

810
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:08,150
...four, live, six, seven, together.

811
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:13,360
Forward, two, three, four, live.

812
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:14,760
Breaststroke.

813
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:19,460
Go to position four. Tread water, right.

814
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,630
Up and down. Lay back.

815
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:27,440
Both, up and down. Both.

816
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:32,610
Pat, eight.
One, two, pat, two, three, slide up.

817
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,780
Six, seven, eight....

818
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,610
I wonder if José has a sister.

819
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:43,490
Three, four, five, six, seven, up,
one, two, three, down.

820
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:45,330
One, two, three, four.

821
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,230
One, two, three and turn.

822
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,310
One, two, three and turn.

823
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,040
One, two, three, four.

824
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:01,680
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no.

825
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,020
Boss, I got him.
I got him locked up in there.

826
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:13,560
Good work.
I got a big wad riding on Middlebrook.

827
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:16,060
With this O'Rourke
out of the running, I'm a cinch.

828
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,570
Why, you birdbrain. That isn't O'Rourke.

829
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:24,000
That's some stupid-looking
redheaded goon.

830
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,340
Gee, I'm sorry, boss.
I'm sorry I made that mistake.

831
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,310
I hate myself.

832
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,380
I'll let him go
and pick up the real guy.

833
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,450
Let him go? So he can tip off O'Rourke?

834
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,280
You let him out of your sight until
after the game and I'll cut your throat.

835
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:41,120
This time I'll send someone with a brain.

836
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:43,520
Yeah, somebody with a brain.

837
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:49,860
That evening, on my way out of the factory,
I stopped to look in on Eve.

838
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:51,690
An old family custom.

839
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:54,770
l was surprised to find her
still at her drawing board...

840
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:58,630
...and a little curious to know
what she was working on so late.

841
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:01,140
It was a sketch of a new swimsuit.

842
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:04,540
A very nice suit, except for one thing:

843
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,220
It looked exactly like a polo outfit.

844
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,680
-You like it?
-Frankly, no.

845
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,950
It's too reminiscent.

846
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,090
-Of a certain polo player.
-José?  

847
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,630
-That's ridiculous.
-Oh, ridiculous, is it?

848
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,390
Ever since that polo player rode into
your life, you've been a different girl.

849
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:27,430
You've missed appointments,
neglected your work.

850
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,040
We've built up something together, Eve.
Something that's pretty good.

851
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:36,400
I don't care to see it knocked flat
by a gust of wind from below the border.

852
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,610
Joe, the business means just as much
to me as it does to you.

853
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,720
As for José O'Rourke,
l don't wanna ever see him again.

854
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:47,080
Well, now you're talking.

855
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,850
Maybe he did give me the idea
for the suit.

856
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,690
So what? It's new and different.

857
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,990
I thought we could spring it
at Middlebrook...

858
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,890
...when we give our water show.

859
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:00,800
Sort of a tribute
to our South American neighbors.

860
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,060
Oh, that's my girl.

861
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,100
What say let's close up shop?

862
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:10,800
-How about a nice, cozy dinner?
-Nothing I'd like better, Joe.

863
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,280
-Pick me up in an hour, huh?
-Okay, honey.

864
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,180
And you forget what I said.
I should know...

865
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:18,750
...that the kind of guy
who would appeal to Betty...

866
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,850
...couldn't get to first base with you.

867
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,110
Very pretty.

868
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:27,080
-What are you doing here?
-Watching you.

869
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:30,690
I came to return your gloves.

870
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:33,860
Thank you very much for the gloves.

871
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:36,590
Now, wait. Now, wait, wait a minute.

872
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,360
When are you going to return
the things you took of mine?

873
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:42,300
-I've taken nothing of yours.
-Oh, but you have.

874
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:46,770
-My peace of mind, my every thought, my--
-Oh, José.

875
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:49,210
Please, leave me alone.

876
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:52,640
And I'd appreciate it a great deal
if you'd leave my sister alone too.

877
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:56,610
-Well, are you opposed to marriage?
-Why, are you thinking of it?

878
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,510
Oh, yes. Very much, all the time.

879
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,990
-Well, that's a relief.
-I hoped it would be.

880
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:08,590
I suppose I really ought to
apologize to you.

881
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,630
Well, it's about time.

882
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:16,730
You can hardly blame me for thinking
your intentions weren't entirely honorable.

883
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,460
-Of course not.
-After all...

884
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,340
...l feel a very deep responsibility
to my sister Betty.

885
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:25,880
-Well, naturally.
-But if you have marriage in mind....

886
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,710
Well, I guess if it's all right with Betty,
it's all right with me.

887
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,050
Well, now that you approve of marriage
and approve of me...

888
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:35,350
...there is only one thing left to clear up.

889
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,320
-What's that?
-It isn't Betty I want to marry.

890
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:40,830
lt's you.

891
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:44,090
Me?

892
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:51,140
It's been that way from the beginning,
but you wouldn't see it.

893
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:54,970
-You wouldn't listen.
-Well, José, I can't listen now.

894
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,440
This is impossible.

895
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,410
-It's all wrong.
-What's wrong about it?

896
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,780
-We can't do this to Betty.
-It's perfectly all right with Betty.

897
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,650
-Well, what about Joe?
-It will be all right with Joe too.

898
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:09,020
He'll find somebody else in the water,
make a fortune with her....

899
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:10,780
Well, that only leaves you and me.

900
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,530
-Oh, no, José.
-Listen, I love you.

901
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,330
I loved you the moment I saw you.
I will always love you.

902
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,960
Now, are you going to get out of there,
or will I have to go in after you?

903
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:24,370
No, no.

904
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,910
Don't come in. I'll come out.

905
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:42,410
Up to now, my relationship with Eve
had been strictly business.

906
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,990
But I knew
I had always been in love with her...

907
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,490
...and tonight I decided to do
something about it.

908
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:55,160
As I handed her the flowers,
I felt something was wrong.

909
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,100
Flowers, I brought you some flowers.

910
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:01,170
Thank you, Joe. They're beautilul.

911
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,670
Well, they won't be
if you don't put them in water.

912
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,870
Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

913
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:12,250
I'd say you were thinking,
and not about flowers.

914
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:17,980
What's on your mind, honey,
or would you rather not tell me?

915
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,590
Of course I wanna tell you, Joe, but....

916
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,060
Well, I just don't know how.

917
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,760
-If it's anything I said tonight, I'm sorry.
-Oh, no...

918
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:27,200
-...it's nothing like that.
-Then what is it?

919
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,300
As if I didn't know.

920
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:36,080
You sure he's the right guy for you?

921
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,980
-That he's sincere and honest and worthy?
-Yes, I'm very sure.

922
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:42,280
You weren't sure an hour ago.

923
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:45,650
Well, a lot can happen in an hour.

924
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,950
It was like a bolt of lightning.
I don't know.

925
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,580
I guess that's just the way it happens
when it's real.

926
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:59,620
I'm very happy, Joe.
I'd like you to be happy for me.

927
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:03,700
-When's it gonna be?
-Tonight.

928
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,040
He isn't wasting any time, is he?

929
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,400
We're flying up to Yuma tonight...

930
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:11,810
...and right alter the game tomorrow,
we're leaving for South America.

931
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:13,450
South America?

932
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:16,380
Well, you don't need me anymore, Joe.

933
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:18,280
The firm's well-established.

934
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:21,650
It can get along just as well without me.
You're the driving force.

935
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,380
I just did what you told me.

936
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,500
There are lots of girls coming up now.
Smarter ones, and prettier too.

937
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:34,230
Oh, Joe, I just wish
it could have been you.

938
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,300
-That must be Betty.
-You haven't told her yet?

939
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,770
No, and I'm not
looking forward to it either.

940
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:46,610
She hasn't had much luck with men...

941
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,550
...and the one man she's crazy about,
I take away from her.

942
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,240
Hi, sis. Hi, Joe.

943
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,890
Oh, I have something thrilling to tell you.

944
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,180
I'm so excited, I gotta sit down.
l can't sit down, I'm too excited.

945
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,950
Your sister has something to tell you.
It may be a shock, so you better sit.

946
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:03,930
I know! You and Eve
are gonna get married.

947
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,090
-Well, you're only half right.
-Please, Joe, let me tell her.

948
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,900
Oh, what is it?

949
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:12,800
Betty, dear, it's about José.
l was all wrong about him--

950
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:16,240
Oh, that's wonderful.
l didn't know how I was gonna tell you.

951
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:18,740
-Tell me what, dear?
-About me and José.

952
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:22,910
-What about you and José?
-We're gonna be married.

953
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:27,580
-Married?
-Yes, I'm so excited I could die.

954
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:36,430
-I don't believe it.
-I didn't believe it either, but it's true.

955
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,900
-Look, a ring and everything.
-It's a ring, all right.

956
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:43,870
-When did he give it to you?
-A few hours ago, when he proposed.

957
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,300
He's had a busy day.

958
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:47,460
Well, he wanted to get married
right away...

959
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,670
...but I was worried about Eve,
because she thought he was a heel.

960
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:53,680
We all make mistakes.
People aren't always what they seem.

961
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:57,220
-Well, Evie, then you give your consent?
-Of course she does.

962
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:00,580
She wishes you every happiness
in the world, don't you, Eve?

963
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,350
-Of course I do, Betty.
-Well, that's wonderlul.

964
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,360
Then you two can stand up for me.

965
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:09,020
l'm afraid we can't.
We have a lot of work at the factory.

966
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:14,230
Well, don't take it so hard, sis.
I'll still be around.

967
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:19,570
Hey, Matilda, what's for dinner?
l'm starved.

968
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:25,410
Oh, no, Joe, he wouldn't dare.

969
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:29,450
-Let me go.
-No, no, this is my job.

970
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,610
I'll take care of it.

971
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,090
-Hello, darling.
-Don't you “darling“ me.

972
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:41,560
How dare you show your face
around here?

973
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:44,720
-Of all the contemptible, despicable, low--
-Why, Eve, I--

974
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:49,000
I ought to slap your face,
but you're not just worth the effort.

975
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,600
Let me in.

976
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,710
Let me in!

977
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,900
I must talk to you.

978
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,980
No use looking at that door, bud.

979
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:16,360
-I'd tackle you before you got hallway.
-Oh, football player, huh?

980
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,200
I suppose like most football players,
you've got a slipped disc.

981
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:24,100
All I ever got slipped
was 200 bucks before each game.

982
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,740
-Now, sit down.
-Look, don't get so rough.

983
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:30,640
I'm only concerned about your back.
A lot of football players have slipped discs.

984
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:33,840
-You don't have trouble with your back?
-I don't have any trouble.

985
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:35,740
Really? Even right there?

986
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,320
Just as I thought. You know,
I run across a lot of these cases in my work.

987
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:41,460
Yeah? What do they do?

988
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,680
I'd rather not tell you about it.
lt'd only make you worry.

989
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,380
First, it throws you off to one side
a few degrees.

990
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,020
And then a little more,
a little more, a little more.

991
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,500
And finally you're at an angle
where they just cover you up.

992
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:57,390
What do you mean?
l ain't off no degrees.

993
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,700
You're not, huh? Get the chair.

994
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:03,870
Here, sit down and face me.
We'll make a little test right here.

995
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,100
Now, look me straight in the eye.

996
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:10,550
-Hey, you sitting up straight?
-Sure.

997
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:15,760
-Gee, there does seem to be a difference.
-I knew it.

998
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,750
Stand up.

999
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,790
You know, you could probably go like this
for years before the final stages.

1000
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:28,940
But then again,
it could happen over night.

1001
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,130
Hey, walk over to me.

1002
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,330
-What happens in the last stages?
-Oh, I'd rather not tell you.

1003
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:40,310
It's pretty horrible and, well,
I wanna remember you just as you are.

1004
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,210
-Is there any cure?
-I could help you.

1005
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,720
-But you haven't been nice to me.
-Is there a cure?

1006
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:47,220
I don't brag, but my massages
have helped hundreds.

1007
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:49,290
-Would you give me a treatment?
-Oh, sure.

1008
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,590
Get over on the table there.
Just stretch right out.

1009
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,790
There, get up there. Every second counts.

1010
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:59,090
You never know where those
slipped discs might slide to next.

1011
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:01,860
Here. How's that feel, huh?

1012
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,260
See, this is much quicker.

1013
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,910
Besides, you don't want
any backtalk to me anyhow.

1014
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:09,870
Here. Now we'll put a little
pressure pack on here.

1015
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,440
-How's that, huh?
-Yeah.

1016
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:13,980
-That feel better?
-Yeah.

1017
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,620
-That hurt?
-No, no.

1018
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,010
Oh, it will.

1019
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:19,620
You'll feel better
when it stops hurting.

1020
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:21,120
Now, we'll--

1021
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:23,810
There. How does that feel, huh?

1022
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:25,580
Yeah.

1023
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:29,390
This is in case you walk in your sleep.

1024
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:35,090
Now, for the final treatment,
we'll give you a little hot poultice here.

1025
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:38,260
Yes, sir. You should be done
in about an hour.

1026
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:43,970
Haven't been able to find out
why José O'Rourke isn't in the game.

1027
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:46,200
But the South Americans
certainly miss him.

1028
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,680
Well, I'm gonna go and find him.

1029
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:53,780
There is the stroke,
and it's over for a score.

1030
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:57,080
That makes the score 2-0
for the North Americans.

1031
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,520
Don't you understand what
I'm trying to tell you? He's been kidnapped.

1032
01:18:02,530 --> 01:18:05,430
José O'Rourke.
He's been kidnapped, kidnapped.

1033
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,300
Pardon me, Señor.
Did you say kidnap?

1034
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:12,030
No, but I'll try it that way.
He's been kidnapped.

1035
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:13,730
Kidnap? Hey, Pedro.

1036
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,810
-What did he say, what did he say?
-He don't know what it means too.

1037
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,180
Oh, well--

1038
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:25,750
Oh, I'd better call the police.

1039
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:29,120
Hey, have either of you
seen José O'Rourke?

1040
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:30,550
Or do you know where he is?

1041
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:34,720
Si, Señorita, José O'Rourke
has been kidnapped, I think.

1042
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:38,160
Kidnapped?
You mean he's been abducted?

1043
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:40,820
Abducted? Hey, Pedro.

1044
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:50,300
-Well, what did he say?
-He is still working on “kidnapped.“

1045
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,500
Oh, this is awful.
I'd better go call the police.

1046
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:56,880
-Hello, is this the police department?
-l have to report a kidnapping.

1047
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,180
Hello, give me the police department.

1048
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:00,720
This is the police department?

1049
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:03,820
Well, look, my fiancé has been
kidnapped, I mean, napped.

1050
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:05,320
A description?

1051
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:09,050
Well, he's about 6-feet-2, he's got
red hair and brown eyes and he's....

1052
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:12,490
He's here! José, darling,
thank goodness you're safe.

1053
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:13,930
-How'd you get away?
-I wa--

1054
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,130
No time for explanations.
Get your polo suit.

1055
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,790
-You gotta get out there and win the game.
-Yeah.

1056
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:21,000
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What's the matter?

1057
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:24,200
-Are you ill?
-Well, I've been duped.

1058
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,610
-Duped?
-Yeah.

1059
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:28,010
They filled a needle with dupe
and they duped me.

1060
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,210
You mean doped, you dope.
Did they hurt you?

1061
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,010
Oh, it was terrible.

1062
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:36,350
First, they stick me with a little needle, then
they stick me with a little bigger needle.

1063
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,650
Then with a little bigger,
bigger needle.

1064
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,990
To think you have to go out there
and play polo.

1065
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,430
Oh, I'm in no condition to ride a horse.

1066
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,830
Why?

1067
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,830
Where you think they stick the needles?

1068
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:50,030
And there it comes out.

1069
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,330
Bakersfield hit it,
number four for North America.

1070
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:55,410
Hernandez is on it, riding. They're all riding.
There's Nelson.

1071
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,840
There goes North America,
riding for another score.

1072
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:59,500
That team is really galloping.

1073
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,210
They're balanced.
They're riding as a team, believe me.

1074
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:06,050
They're going along down the field.
It looks as if they're going to score.

1075
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,450
No! No!

1076
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:09,590
Sit down, son, sit down.

1077
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,550
They're carrying Sanchez off the field.

1078
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:14,390
The South Americans
certainly need a miracle man today.

1079
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,860
But where are they going
to get a miracle man? Where?

1080
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,560
-What's the matter? All right?
-The dupe.

1081
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:23,860
Keep breathing. Once you stop
breathing, that dupe will get you.

1082
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,270
Now, open up your eyes.

1083
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,530
-Now, get up on the horse.
-Where's the horse?

1084
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:29,610
-In front of you.
-I thought that was you.

1085
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,680
Come on, give him a hand.
He's been duped.

1086
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:33,540
That's South American for doped.

1087
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:37,670
Put your foot in his hand, not the stirrup.
That's better, yeah.

1088
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:38,980
No.

1089
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,450
Here, I'll show you how to do it.

1090
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,430
You see?

1091
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,750
-Now, go in there and win for us.
-Okay.

1092
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:50,420
Wait a minute!

1093
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,330
I'm not supposed to be up here,
you're supposed to be. Come on.

1094
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,200
Put your foot in the hand like that.

1095
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:59,640
-Up, up. That's it.
-Here.

1096
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:02,570
-No, you're on the wrong horse.
-Wait a minute. Put me down.

1097
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:08,840
There must be an easier way
to get on one of them.

1098
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,180
Try it like this.

1099
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:12,750
Oh, that's good, and then you....

1100
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,150
There.

1101
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,590
-That's good.
-Here, get in there and win for us.

1102
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,590
You're supposed to be up there, not him.
Now, come on, over.

1103
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,730
Here. Wait a minute.
What are you doing? l....

1104
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,260
Put me down, will you?

1105
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:28,030
Hey.

1106
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:31,300
No, no, no.

1107
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:35,000
-Here, that's it.
-Here.

1108
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,870
That's it, put this foot over.
This foot over.

1109
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:41,410
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, I'm--

1110
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:50,850
Oh, there you are.

1111
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,180
Where did he go now?

1112
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,590
Now, where's José?

1113
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,160
Oh, there you are. Look.

1114
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:01,940
Oh, I know. Look,
you put your leg up like he did.

1115
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,470
-Like here?
-Up here.

1116
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:06,330
Like-- That's right. Now, you....

1117
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:11,270
Where's my foot? Where's my leg?
Where's my leg?

1118
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:13,740
No, that's not it.

1119
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:17,180
You foot's coming off,
your foot's coming off.

1120
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:19,650
Oh, I broke my leg!

1121
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:22,650
Look, this has gone far enough.
Get him on that horse.

1122
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:25,250
Here, here, here.
Here, put me down.

1123
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:28,050
Get back around the horse.
That's right. All right, now.

1124
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:30,220
Back, boy, back, back.

1125
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,920
Now, get in there and win.

1126
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,170
No, wait a minute. Betty, let me explain.

1127
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:36,330
l can't ride, l....

1128
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,490
Hey, you forgot your polo mallet!

1129
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:42,440
-That's not a polo pony, that's a jumper.
-A jumper?

1130
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:44,080
Whoa, boy, whoa!

1131
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,870
But I don't understand.

1132
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:49,780
Here, here, here.

1133
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,860
Here's a player riding onto the field.

1134
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,370
Look out!

1135
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:15,770
What a spectacular entrance.
We can't see who it is from here.

1136
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,910
lt's number three. Yes, it is!

1137
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,480
lt's José O'Rourke.

1138
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:21,310
O'Rourke?

1139
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,040
l don't get it.

1140
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,520
How can you be there
and here at the same time?

1141
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:27,420
Split personality.

1142
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:29,490
-Shut him up, Max.
-No, you don't, Lukie.

1143
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:34,890
Well, patron, a redheaded fellow--

1144
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,290
Yes, never mind.
How can I get to the polo field?

1145
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,230
Grab the squad car outside.

1146
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,960
-Come on, Julio.
-Well, Lukie...

1147
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:43,300
...kidnapping isn't a very pleasant rap.

1148
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:45,840
You won't need a television
where you're going.

1149
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:48,840
There's plenty of excitement
in the game now with O'Rourke in.

1150
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:52,740
Anything's liable to happen.
He's the sparkplug of his team.

1151
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,880
O'Rourke's been hit.
He seems to be dazed.

1152
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:59,110
He's lost control of his mount
and is bumping into all the players.

1153
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:02,310
There's the ball at the goal post.
Both teams are riding after it.

1154
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:05,360
O'Rourke's got it and he scores
with his cap...

1155
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:08,260
...making the first score
for the South Americans.

1156
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:10,890
You were just wonderful in the game.
Come on.

1157
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:13,760
Only two more minutes to play.
Ready for the next horse.

1158
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:15,730
Oh, no.

1159
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:26,910
The teams are in midfield.
O'Rourke is late for lineup again.

1160
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,140
There goes the ball. Fordman misses.
Hernandez rides over the ball.

1161
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,110
He's offside.

1162
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:34,190
Nelson comes through.
The ball is rolling.

1163
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,250
And a beautiful play by José O'Rourke.

1164
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:39,620
He rode Nelson right off the ball,
enabling Gonzales, his teammate...

1165
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:43,490
...to go through to make the score
for South America. That ties up--

1166
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,030
There's very little time left
in this last chukker.

1167
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:50,360
You can expect some real action now.
Nobody's giving an inch.

1168
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:52,270
There goes the ball down the field...

1169
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:55,570
...and there goes O'Rourke galloping
down the sideboard after it.

1170
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:58,010
Hey! Stop!

1171
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,510
That's my popcorn!

1172
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:01,850
Hey!

1173
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:05,210
There's a scramble for the ball.

1174
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,590
Looks like O'Rourke has found it.

1175
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:13,690
He's broken his mallet.

1176
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,290
But nothing is going to stop
José O'Rourke today.

1177
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:19,160
There he goes down the field,
both teams chasing him.

1178
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:22,300
Another beautilul shot.
They'll never catch him now.

1179
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,240
The ball is in the clear now.

1180
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:29,540
And there he goes again.

1181
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:38,310
It's over for the South Americans.

1182
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:42,180
before I present this trophy
to the victorious South American team...

1183
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,690
...I would like to say
that in all my experience...

1184
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,830
...l've never seen such spectacular polo.

1185
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,260
I take great pleasure
in presenting this trophy...

1186
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:53,660
...to the captain of the South American
team, José O'Rourke.

1187
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:01,940
I am proud to accept this beautiful cup
on behalf of my teammates.

1188
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:04,340
Wait a minute.
This cup belongs to José O'Rourke.

1189
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:05,980
Señorita, I am José O'Rourke.

1190
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:07,140
-You?
-Yes.

1191
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:09,580
What some people won't do to get a cup.

1192
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:12,180
Jose, tell this imposter who you are.

1193
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:16,250
-I'm Jack Spratt.
-You see, he's the real Jack Spr--

1194
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,290
What is a Jack Spratt?

1195
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:21,590
Betty, I hope you won't hate me,
but I'm the real impostor.

1196
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,600
I'm not a polo player.
I'm not even a South American. I'm--

1197
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:28,000
Well, I'm just a masseur.

1198
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:31,230
Why-- You're wonderlul.

1199
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:33,530
And I don't care if you are a masseur.

1200
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:37,440
I like the French
as well as the South Americans.

1201
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,810
And I'd be proud to change my name
from Barrett to Spratt.

1202
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,880
-Did you say Barrett?
-Yeah.

1203
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:46,320
-Do you have sister?
-Sure, Eve.

1204
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,090
Wait a minute!

1205
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:10,110
l just don't believe it. I don't know
whether to kiss you or kill you.

1206
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,010
Well, kiss me.

1207
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:15,380
I got two extra tickets on the plane.
We can make it a double wedding.

1208
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:18,420
Oh, that's wonderlul! But where's José?

1209
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:20,990
Oh, he's probably on a boat
for South America by now.

1210
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:24,250
-Oh, Betty.
-Eve! Oh, come on. Get ready. You're on.

1211
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:26,820
-I can't. You don't understand.
-Let her get dressed.

1212
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:29,120
I understand everything.
Will you get ready?

1213
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,560
-Señor.
-What happened?

1214
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:34,000
She fell for it. She thinks you're
on your way to South America by now.

1215
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:36,290
-Good, good.
-Joe? Joe.

1216
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:37,800
Hey, you kids beat it.

1217
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:41,460
Jose, hide in that cabaña right there.
I'll see what she wants.

1218
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:45,040
Come on, Eve.
The ballet goes on in a few minutes.

1219
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:48,940
Joe, you've got to hold it up for me.
I've got to find José and explain.

1220
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,880
I can't let him go away feeling that--

1221
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:54,920
Now, look, Eve, there are several hundred
people out there waiting to see you swim.

1222
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:57,450
-They're waiting to see a ballet.
-I don't care.

1223
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:58,850
I'm not gonna do it.

1224
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:02,150
Will you forget about José O'Rourke
and Eve Barrett and think of me?

1225
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:04,820
Just this once, think of me?

1226
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,630
Oh, I'm sorry, Joe. l'm terrible sorry.

1227
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,970
l didn't mean to be so selfish.

1228
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:16,440
I'll be ready in a minute.

1229
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,870
José?

1230
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:24,750
-Yes?
-It's all set.

1231
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,160
Well, I guess this is what you call
a happy ending, huh?

1232
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:37,130
After all, I got the girl I wanted,
she got the man she wanted and you....

1233
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,730
Well, you got the business.

1234
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:42,930
Yeah. Yeah, I sure did, didn't I?

1235
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,420
-HeIIo.
-Why--

1236
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:11,080
Well, fancy meeting you here.

1237
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:14,820
Why, José! Where did you come from?

1238
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,830
South America.

1239
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,300
But why?

1240
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:21,490
Shall we dance?

1241
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:19,680
Well, that's the story of a guy,
a girl and a bathing suit.

1242
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:21,950
Happy ending too.

1243
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,920
South America, take it away.

1243
01:32:25,305 --> 01:33:25,702
