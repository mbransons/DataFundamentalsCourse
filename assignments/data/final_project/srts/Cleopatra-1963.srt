1
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,056
And so it fell out
that at Pharsalia...

2
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,436
the great might and manhood of Rome
met in bloody civil war...

3
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,773
and Caesar's legions
destroyed those of the great Pompey...

4
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,527
so that now only Caesar
stood at the head of Rome.

5
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:25,365
But there was no joy for Caesar
as in his other triumphs...

6
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:30,704
for the dead which his legions
counted and buried and burned...

7
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,748
were their own countrymen.

8
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,420
The smoke of burning Roman dead
is just as black...

9
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,007
and the stink no less.

10
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,052
It was Pompey, not I,
who wanted it so.

11
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,888
Let what I have said be set down.

12
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,059
You may stand.

13
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,524
Do not try and impress me by looking
either too penitent or too proud.

14
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,236
As field officers,
you fought miserably for Pompey.

15
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,907
Men under your command will be
permitted to enlist in my legions...

16
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,534
and returned to Rome as Romans.

17
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,620
You shall have the same privilege.

18
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,207
I'm not magnanimous. Your names
are marked. You'll be watched.

19
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,834
First sign of treachery,
you'll be killed.

20
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,837
What is it, Flavius? Antony?

21
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,383
Oh, yes. Canidius.
With news of Pompey, I hope.

22
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,087
- Hail Caesar!
- Drink that in my name, Canidius.

23
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,841
To all Marc Antony's cavalry,
Caesar's left wing and right arm.

24
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,051
What news of Pompey,
or what's left of him?

25
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,054
Pompey's gone, Caesar.

26
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,641
Slipped through our fingers,
disguised as a peddler.

27
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,145
- Leaving most of his merchandise.
- Gone? Where?

28
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:22,816
He has a galley waiting at the coast.
Provision enough for Egypt, they say.

29
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:28,029
Egypt. Possibly.
They owe him a great deal.

30
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:32,117
He'll ask for sanctuary.
Borrow money, borrow time.

31
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,954
I thought it was over.
It seems it's not.

32
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,999
Rufio, consult the augurers.
I want to know.

33
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,210
In Egypt, will Pompey face me at last?

34
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,882
But surely Caesar will now
return to Rome!

35
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,842
I must go to Egypt in any case.

36
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,304
Young King Ptolemy and his sister
have a civil war of their own...

37
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:56,766
intent on destroying each other,
and in the process, Rome's wheat.

38
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,727
That cannot be so urgent.

39
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,105
Let the Romans welcome
great Caesar properly at last...

40
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,441
in this greatest of his triumphs.

41
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,861
Triumph? Over what?

42
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,198
Over whom?

43
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,283
- Canidius.
- Caesar?

44
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,912
Leave me the 10th and 12th.
Antony's to take the rest to Rome.

45
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,331
- When can he start?
- Whenever you say.

46
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,416
Then at once.

47
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,713
And in Rome,
Marc Antony is to speak for Caesar.

48
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,798
His authority is not to be questioned.

49
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,884
His word will be yours.

50
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,844
As always, Caesar's word is law.

51
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,429
Of course.

52
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,808
But remind him to keep his legions
intact. They make the law legal.

53
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,101
Caesar.

54
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,450
And even as Caesar's galleys
sailed the great sea to Egypt...

55
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,703
it was happening that,
just as the Romans...

56
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,415
so the Egyptians made war,
one upon the other...

57
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,835
for young King Ptolemy would no longer
share the throne...

58
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,171
with his sister Cleopatra...

59
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,966
but drove her
from the city of Alexandria...

60
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,302
and sought to destroy her.

61
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,281
We've arrived on their market day.

62
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,242
Once a week they're allowed
in the royal enclosure.

63
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,620
Where's the guard of honor for Caesar?

64
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,414
Some representative
of the royal or military?

65
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:16,508
We have the privilege of watching
Caesar battle through our marketplace.

66
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,054
Marcellus, a dozen front-rank men,
swords only.

67
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,640
Clear a direct line
to the palace steps.

68
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,434
Then as many more to keep it open.

69
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,814
It's precisely what they hope we'd be stupid
enough to do: manhandle their people.

70
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,442
No. This is their market day,
we will go marketing.

71
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,113
- You're not serious.
- We'll shop our way to the palace.

72
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:42,158
Have you my money?
Everything is to be paid for by coin.

73
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,203
Tell them to put away the swords
and carry moneybags.

74
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,604
Olives. Oil of olives.

75
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,023
The wine of Samos.

76
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,110
How much for your wine? Four drachma.

77
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,362
Sixty of your wine for my men.

78
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,616
Pay him.

79
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,039
You said they'd push the people
and make them angry.

80
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,084
Why aren't they doing
what you said they'd do?

81
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,045
Your king has asked a question,
Lord Chamberlain.

82
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:41,050
The Romans have degenerated minds,
Most High Majesty.

83
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,470
They do the unexpected.

84
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,473
Particularly one Roman.

85
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,017
Master of the unexpected.

86
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,103
But with so few men.

87
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,446
You all look so impressive.

88
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,573
Any one of you could be king.

89
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,117
His Divine Majesty, my Lord Ptolemy...

90
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,787
lord of the Upper
and Lower regions...

91
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,581
son of Ra, of Horus and of Thoth,
beloved of...

92
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,334
Et cetera, et cetera. You welcome me.

93
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,629
And I, Gaius Julius Caesar,
Pontifex Maximus...

94
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,173
et cetera, et cetera, thank you.

95
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,593
From the Senate and people
of Rome, hail King Ptolemy.

96
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,764
And his sister and co-ruler,
Queen Cleopatra?

97
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,518
They won't tell you so,
but Cleopatra's dead.

98
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,104
She tried to kill me,
and we chased her into the desert.

99
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,940
And there she died.

100
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,443
Whereas it is true
that His Majesty's sister...

101
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,071
repeatedly plotted
to have him killed...

102
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,573
it is not true
that Cleopatra is dead.

103
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,743
Whereas it is true that she
fled from Alexandria...

104
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,954
I seem to always interrupt you...

105
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,915
but the search for truth
can go on and on.

106
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,375
Pothinus, is it not?

107
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,170
Lord Chamberlain and chief eunuch
to King Ptolemy. An exalted rank.

108
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,925
Obtained not without certain,
shall we say, sacrifice.

109
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,927
Theodotus, am I right?

110
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:10,223
Tutor to His Majesty in history,
philosophy and ambition.

111
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,059
And Achillas.
They say you're a good soldier.

112
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,938
- As one to another, where is Cleopatra?
- With her army.

113
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,024
And how many of your men
between her and Alexandria?

114
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,069
- Enough.
- May I speak?

115
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,405
Surely you have come in peace.

116
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:30,034
And we present ourselves to you
in warm and respectful welcome.

117
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:34,372
Our only problem being an
internal one, of concern only to us...

118
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,291
why have you come, Caesar?

119
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,004
As we all know, when the father
of both Ptolemy and Cleopatra died...

120
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,799
he named the two of them
to rule jointly over Egypt.

121
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,304
Rome was appointed their guardian
and the executor of his will.

122
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,474
I have come in the name of Rome to ask
why Cleopatra has been deposed...

123
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,811
to resolve the differences
between her and King Ptolemy...

124
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:01,441
and to see that they peacefully
resume their joint rule of Egypt.

125
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,111
That will be difficult.
Cleopatra has forfeited her right.

126
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,530
I shall try to decide justly.

127
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,117
Don't you see he'll send for her?
He'll bring her back!

128
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,038
The sun which sheds its grace
upon the ruler of the two lands...

129
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,956
burns too brightly perhaps.

130
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,083
If Lord Ptolemy wishes to retire...

131
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,044
I wish nothing of the kind!

132
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,465
I won't be put out of the way
until I've watched you give him that!

133
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,261
A thousand pardons,
I had almost forgotten.

134
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:35,475
Lord Ptolemy wishes to enhance his
welcome by a gift of some importance.

135
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,186
Most generous.

136
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,314
The ring. Give him Pompey's ring.

137
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,329
And now the token of
His Majesty's affection for Rome...

138
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,040
and regard for Caesar.

139
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,930
Pompey the Great.

140
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,979
Dead men, they say, do not bite.

141
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,899
Does it please you, Caesar?

142
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,610
They said it would
please you very much.

143
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,866
The sun does shed its grace
too brightly.

144
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,829
It has become too hot here for kings.

145
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,957
My Lord Ptolemy will retire.

146
00:16:56,473 --> 00:17:00,351
For His Majesty,
a Roman guard of honor.

147
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,906
It was not by your hand, of course.

148
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,703
If, as you say, you've been told
of me, you know better, Caesar.

149
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,499
My men shall be
properly housed and fed.

150
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,044
- May I speak?
- Not until you're spoken to.

151
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,087
I'll require rooms in the palace.

152
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,299
I shall consider myself
honored to escort you.

153
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,509
Anyone but you.

154
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,389
Find the rest of Pompey.

155
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,434
Tear out a thousand tongues,
but find him.

156
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,436
Have him purified...

157
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,647
the coin in the mouth
and the rest, honorably.

158
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,941
Of course.

159
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,232
For now, this is what we must hold.

160
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,776
Moon gate and three others.
Here, here and here.

161
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,486
How are we placed?

162
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,280
The 10th slingers on the moon gate.
The rest in reserve.

163
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,534
The 12th holding all other positions.
Very thin.

164
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,285
For now, deep enough.

165
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,872
- Have we tested the wells?
- The water's brackish, but drinkable.

166
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,167
So far. Keep an eye on them.
Watch the corn and wheat.

167
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,212
With our supplies secure,
we can hold indefinitely.

168
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,883
For a week, perhaps.
For the time being, time enough.

169
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,552
What do you want?

170
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,685
Is the man to be trusted?

171
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,063
Seems someone's brought me a gift...

172
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,315
from Queen Cleopatra.

173
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,736
Apparently, a rug peddler.

174
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,405
Flavius doubts it.

175
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,740
He seems to know the palace very well.

176
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,953
He appeared through a secret passage
which none of the men knew.

177
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,790
Pothinus might send an assassin
in Cleopatra's name.

178
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,084
Have the man brought in.

179
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,687
Are you the one
who brings a gift from Cleopatra?

180
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,564
Put it down and go.

181
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,776
It is the command of my queen
I deliver her gift personally.

182
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,112
I am Caesar. Lay it here before me.

183
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,490
Forgive me, Admiral Agrippa,
but you're not Caesar.

184
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,327
Nor you, General Rufio.
Nor you, Germanicus.

185
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,246
My queen's gift is for
the eyes of Caesar...

186
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,081
alone.

187
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,709
- It seems harmless enough.
- No, Caesar!

188
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,005
You can lend me your sword, Rufio.
It may require some cutting.

189
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,933
Odd way to carry a rug.

190
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,894
Isn't it easier
to sling it over your shoulder?

191
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,605
It was less comfortable that way.

192
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,776
- For you or the rug?
- That sword, Caesar.

193
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,780
The rug is such a delicate weave.
If I may untie it for you.

194
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,574
Turn it over first.

195
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,662
- But the rug is right-side up.
- I want it the wrong side up.

196
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,873
- Should I flip it over with my sword?
- No, no, no.

197
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:00,007
I find one can tell more
about the quality of merchandise...

198
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,219
by examining the back side first.

199
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,393
All hail Cleopatra,
kindred of Horus and Ra...

200
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,729
beloved of the moon and sun,
daughter to Isis...

201
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,692
and of Upper and Lower Egypt,
queen.

202
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,787
Thank you.

203
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,497
Here.

204
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,252
Take this to the captain
of the night watch.

205
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,006
He'll see the queen's quarters
are made ready to her.

206
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,508
Stay where you are.

207
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,970
- Have I dismissed you?
- No, Your Majesty.

208
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,139
This is my palace, Caesar.

209
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,309
All of it
is available to me at my will.

210
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,438
I am not your prisoner.
If anything, you are my guest.

211
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,731
Most kind.

212
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,443
And as for having my quarters,
as you put it, made ready...

213
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,196
my chief handmaiden has, by now,
brought the others out of hiding.

214
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,198
They should almost be finished.

215
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,784
Impossible.
The doors are under guard.

216
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,162
There are doors, and doors.

217
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,581
Oh, yes. Of course.

218
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,501
You must take me on a tour someday
within the walls of your palace.

219
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,504
- What are you waiting for?
- Permission to leave.

220
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,131
Granted.

221
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,383
Apollodorus.

222
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,970
Thank you.

223
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,397
I'm pleased you received my summons
and were able to...

224
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:43,027
Summons? I'm pleased to say
I received nothing of the kind.

225
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,905
I'm surprised you thought
I would answer one.

226
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,783
Young lady, the voyage
in your non-magic carpet...

227
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,952
has apparently not tired you,
but I'm exhausted.

228
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,414
Caesar, it is essential
we understand each other.

229
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,000
Only through me
can you hope to escape...

230
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,337
the desperate situation
in which you find yourself.

231
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,923
I wouldn't bite into that.

232
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,135
Did you bring it with you?
Have you had it tasted?

233
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,346
If neither, it's probably poisoned.

234
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:15,101
At least it's another way out of the
desperate situation in which I'm found.

235
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,314
You're being tolerant of me,
aren't you?

236
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,318
Is it because you're so much older?

237
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,365
Your maps are inferior.
Out-of-date, compared to mine.

238
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,034
They and I have aged together.

239
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,703
The lakes to the west
are poorly marked...

240
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,748
certain important hill positions
not even noted.

241
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,211
I must arrange for you to address
my mapmakers and general staff.

242
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,299
We've gotten off to a bad start,
haven't we?

243
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,844
I've rubbed you the wrong way.

244
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,306
I'm not sure I want to be
rubbed by you at all, young lady.

245
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,020
It is permissible
for me to sit, is it not?

246
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:08,279
As quickly as possible you must
set me alone on the throne of Egypt.

247
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,199
My mission is to put to an end the tiresome
squabbling between your brother and you.

248
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,743
You're not a fool. Or are you?

249
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,246
Immodestly, perhaps, no.

250
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,999
You've seen my brother
and listened to him?

251
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,918
And that truly evil man
to whom he belongs?

252
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,421
Yes.

253
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,550
Shall we agree upon what Rome
really wants...

254
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,552
has always wanted of Egypt?

255
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:36,056
Corn, grain, treasure.
It's the old story.

256
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,643
Roman greatness built
upon Egyptian riches.

257
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,606
You shall have them.
You shall have them all and in peace.

258
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,233
But there is only one way.

259
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,445
My way. Make me queen.

260
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,531
That sounds very much
like an ultimatum.

261
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,283
There is no other way.

262
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,495
For one whose assets,
up to a few moments ago...

263
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,414
was a devoted slave
and a rolled-up carpet...

264
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,708
But I have you now, Caesar.

265
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,710
Besides, there are my armies...

266
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,339
and the simple fact that
no mortal hand can destroy me.

267
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,467
Yes, I recall some
mention of an obsession...

268
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,761
you have about your divinity.

269
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,013
Isis, is it not?

270
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,352
I shall have to insist
that you mind what you say.

271
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:26,023
I am Isis. I am worshiped
by millions who believe it.

272
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,567
Do not confuse what I am...

273
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,195
with the so-called divine origin...

274
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:35,157
that every Roman general acquires
together with his shield.

275
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:40,829
It was Venus you chose to be
descended from, wasn't it?

276
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,208
I must now do a little
insisting of my own.

277
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,253
First, your journey has tired you
and you wish to retire.

278
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,297
I am not your servant, Caesar.
Do not dismiss me.

279
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,925
Secondly, you have no armies,
young lady.

280
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,928
They are gone because
you could not pay them.

281
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,056
Egypt's riches are not
available for your own use...

282
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,059
much less to give away.
Perhaps in a day or two...

283
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,645
- ...we can speak again.
- That may be too late...

284
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,021
for both of us.

285
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,941
Your safety will be
my responsibility.

286
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,194
And what about your own?

287
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,155
I am prepared, I believe,
for the time being.

288
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,408
I hope so.

289
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,203
I hope you are as wise,
as brilliant...

290
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,414
the god they say you are.

291
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,167
You Roman generals
become divine so quickly.

292
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,838
A few victories, a few massacres.

293
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,049
Only yesterday, Pompey was a god.

294
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,094
- They murdered him, didn't they?
- Yes.

295
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,097
Because they thought
it would please you.

296
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,434
- It didn't, did it?
- No.

297
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:49,607
Today I found myself remembering
how much my daughter loved him.

298
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,610
She died trying
to bear him a son.

299
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,987
She gave him this ring.

300
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,491
Sleep well tonight, Caesar.

301
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,286
These next days may
be difficult for you.

302
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,580
Good night.

303
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,920
Germanicus, a guard to escort
Queen Cleopatra to her apartments.

304
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,297
Guards!

305
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,810
The corridors are dark, gentlemen.

306
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,730
But you mustn't be afraid.
I am with you.

307
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,829
Haven't we covered everything
we can tonight, sir?

308
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,541
- Perhaps a fresh start in the morning.
- No, a few more matters.

309
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,087
Rufio, has it occurred to you
that our maps of this area...

310
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,547
are not quite what they should be?

311
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,342
Why, no. What makes you
think they're not?

312
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,761
I have an instinct about these things.

313
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,689
Actually of Macedonian descent.

314
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,233
No officially-admitted Egyptian blood.

315
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,736
"Reputed to be extremely intelligent
and sharp of wit."

316
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,448
Queen Cleopatra is widely read.
Well-versed in the sciences...

317
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
and mathematics.

318
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,661
She speaks seven languages
proficiently.

319
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:29,289
"Were she not a woman, she'd be
considered an intellectual."

320
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,751
Nothing bores me so much
as an intellectual.

321
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,337
Makes a better admiral of you,
Agrippa.

322
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,049
Here's something
of more interest to the navy:

323
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:44,096
"ln obtaining her objectives, she has
been known to use torture, poison..."

324
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,308
and even her own sexual talents,
which are said to be considerable.

325
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:53,021
Her lovers, I am told, are listed
more easily by number than by name.

326
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,275
It is said that she chooses
in the manner of a man...

327
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,319
"...rather than wait to be chosen
after womanly fashion."

328
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,072
Well, there's more reason
than we thought...

329
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,242
for not wanting to leave
you two alone, eh, sir?

330
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,244
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

331
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,663
Are you inclined to trust Cleopatra?

332
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,499
Trust? Not for a minute.

333
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:17,254
"Trust." The word has always
made me apprehensive.

334
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:21,633
Like wine, whenever I've tried it,
the aftereffects have not been good.

335
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,177
So I've given up wine...

336
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,137
and trusting.

337
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,891
Oh, it's been a long
and difficult day, gentlemen.

338
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,519
The next few may be even longer
and more difficult.

339
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,189
- Good night.
- Good night.

340
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,895
Flavius!

341
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,898
It is autumn again, my best-loved Lesbia

342
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:28,195
Look, the torrents of Roman leaves
Are falling, falling

343
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,865
And lovers revive in kisses
The promise of spring

344
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,453
Which will end the winter world
With new nightingales calling

345
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,914
I taste your food, daughter of Isis...

346
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,876
and if there be harm in it,
let the harm fall upon me.

347
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,587
But love must bring
Despair one day

348
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,340
As beauty, sorrow

349
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:57,474
- Why do you stop, Phoebus?
- In the corridor, there is movement.

350
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,978
That's how the Romans
frighten the enemy...

351
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:05,148
- ...by stamping their elephant feet.
- No, this is one man...

352
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,150
followed by others.

353
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,821
- Caesar, I would say.
- Would you?

354
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,494
We must not disappoint
the mighty Caesar.

355
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,956
The Romans tell fabulous tales
of my bath...

356
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,333
and handmaidens...

357
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,919
and my morals.

358
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,341
Cleopatra's requested an audience
with me.

359
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,720
- That was yesterday, Caesar.
- I've been occupied.

360
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,182
The queen is occupied with her bath.
Perhaps Caesar could return later...

361
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,394
- ...or tomorrow.
- I'm afraid not. Hold him.

362
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,521
No, don't hurt him.

363
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,523
You're a good man, Apollodorus.

364
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,442
I hope you're appreciated.

365
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,361
Wait here for me.

366
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,423
Then let us live and love
Without one thought

367
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:16,178
For the gossip of virgins
Now grown old and stale

368
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,180
Suns go down and may return

369
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,515
But once put out
Our own brief light

370
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,143
We sleep through
One eternal night

371
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,188
An intruder! A man!

372
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,318
Oh, it's you.

373
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,321
You wanted to see me?

374
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,617
I summoned you yesterday...

375
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,161
to an audience in my throne room.

376
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,206
I was told I was not
permitted to go there.

377
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,794
It's too close to the quarters
occupied by your brother and the rest.

378
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,756
I will not be told where
I can go and where I cannot go!

379
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,383
Since there's nothing you want...

380
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,136
Except my throne!

381
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,309
At least you've dressed
properly for my presence.

382
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,229
Your best armor?

383
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,649
Almost, but I'm afraid
it's not being worn in your honor.

384
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,735
I know.

385
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:18,865
This morning, you paid a formal
visit to the tomb of Alexander.

386
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,744
You remained alone beside
the sarcophagus for some time.

387
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,497
I'd like to know how you know.

388
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,916
Just staring down at him.

389
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,253
And then you cried.

390
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,923
Why did you cry, Caesar?

391
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,386
That man recites beautifully.

392
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,346
- Is he blind?
- Don't you hurt him.

393
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,016
I won't. Not anyone
who speaks Catullus so well.

394
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,854
Catullus doesn't approve of you.
Why haven't you had him killed?

395
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,273
Because I approve of him.

396
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,943
My desire to please you, Caesar
Is very slight

397
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,196
Nor do I greatly care to know
If you are black or white

398
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,658
Achillas is moving
his entire army to Alexandria.

399
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,996
By tonight, he'll outnumber you
20-to-1, 30-to-1.

400
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,833
He'll have the royal enclosure
entirely surrounded.

401
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,042
Except to the sea.

402
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,462
Do you plan to sail away,
great Caesar?

403
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,591
Not for the time being.

404
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,094
Achillas may attack tomorrow,
the next day...

405
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,847
- ...whenever it suits him!
- Very probable.

406
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,310
In your wildest dreams, Caesar,
how can you possibly hope to hold...

407
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,605
the gates of this enclosure
against such odds?

408
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,649
And if you say once more,
"For the time being"...

409
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,403
My officers say anything
from a week to indefinitely.

410
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,405
What would you estimate?

411
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,825
Before you're without water...

412
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,327
without food...

413
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,622
your troops slaughtered,
picked off from the rooftops...

414
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,916
poisoned in the brothels?

415
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,295
A few days, Caesar.
At the most, a few days.

416
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,215
I'm inclined to agree with you.

417
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,968
Young man, do you know this
of Catullus?

418
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,222
Give me a thousand
And a thousand kisses

419
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,016
When we have many thousand more
We'll scramble them

420
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,809
And forget the score

421
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,812
So evil envy will not know
How high the count

422
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,941
And cast its evil eye

423
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,281
It couldn't have been
as pleasant in the throne room.

424
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,038
"My desire to please you, Caesar,
Is very slight..."

425
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,373
Be still!

426
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,126
Caesar, a word. It's important.

427
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:41,132
The Egyptian galleys in the harbor
have been taking on men and armaments.

428
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:45,345
- When will they be prepared?
- Tomorrow, with the morning wind.

429
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,056
Burn them tonight.

430
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,141
Their ships lie close to shore.

431
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,478
- The fire may spread to the city.
- Let's hope it doesn't.

432
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,146
I can't risk a blockade.

433
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,900
Remember, not before tonight.
Prepare as secretly as possible.

434
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,069
I need this day.

435
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,654
Good luck.

436
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,953
Why not before tonight, my lord?
Why does Caesar need this day?

437
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,707
I can't give you that information,
for the time being.

438
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,300
Flavius.

439
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,594
Here it is, Caesar. Just arrived.

440
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,264
The gods shouldn't
tantalize us so, Rufio.

441
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,436
It's even better than I'd hoped.

442
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:38,565
- Be on your way, you haven't much time.
- Hail Caesar.

443
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:05,258
It's called an epilepse because of the
arching caused by muscular spasms...

444
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,428
the contortions.
The early Greeks considered...

445
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,015
those who suffered from it
to be favored by the gods.

446
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,934
The great Alexander, they say...

447
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,520
had this falling sickness.

448
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,483
And, so they say,
the mighty Caesar too.

449
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,071
Your Majesty, forgive me.
Sosigenes, the library.

450
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,823
- What are you saying?
- The Romans set fire...

451
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,576
- ...to the Egyptian fleet.
- It's about time.

452
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,829
Come see for yourself.
The fire's spread to the city.

453
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,415
- The city?
- Just a few buildings...

454
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,626
but the library is burning.

455
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,216
The great library.

456
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,900
Aristotle's manuscripts.

457
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:10,407
The Platonic commentaries,
the plays, the histories.

458
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,992
The Testament of the Hebrew god.

459
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,287
The Book of Books.

460
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:25,213
- Wind blew into the merchant shipping.
- Four or five burned and sank right here.

461
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,173
- And our ships?
- Safe and dry.

462
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,135
Prisoners are surrendering in droves.
I need help.

463
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,097
- Not one man. I may need your sailors.
- Halt!

464
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,600
Take your hands off me!

465
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,695
You should attack my guards more
often. Battle seems to become you.

466
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,990
You grow more beautiful
each time I see you.

467
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,243
And you grow bolder.

468
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,411
And busier.

469
00:40:56,662 --> 00:41:00,331
- Actually, we're extremely busy...
- Do you smell smoke?

470
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,586
We found it necessary
to burn the Egyptian fleet.

471
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,629
The ships were in the water.

472
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,966
Did you find it necessary
to burn them in the streets?

473
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,926
Merchant ships caught fire.

474
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,179
The burning masts fell.
Some houses...

475
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,266
One of them, the great
Library of Alexandria.

476
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,060
Yes, I've been told.
I'm extremely sorry.

477
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,105
- Now, if you don't mind, I must ask...
- I do mind.

478
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,274
Are you putting the fire out?

479
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,027
We're forming prisoners
into fire brigades.

480
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,198
Oh, I see. Romans only start fires,
is that it?

481
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,576
Have you broken out of your nursery
to come irritate the adults?

482
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,328
Another time, we're working.

483
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,583
- Shall we remove her for you, Caesar?
- Use that Roman genius for destruction.

484
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,461
Tear down pyramids, wipe out cities!

485
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:52,133
How dare you and the rest of your
barbarians set fire to my library?

486
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,553
Play conqueror all you want,
mighty Caesar.

487
00:41:56,013 --> 00:42:00,058
Rape, murder, pillage thousands,
millions of human beings.

488
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,770
But neither you nor
any other barbarian...

489
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,689
has the right to destroy
one human thought!

490
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,693
Enough!
Leave me alone with her.

491
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,616
I will send for you when I finish.
It won't be long.

492
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,374
Swords? Javelins?

493
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,668
Or are you going to set me on fire?

494
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,046
The time has come for us
to understand each other.

495
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:34,259
Whatever else I may be, in your
opinion, first of all, I am Caesar.

496
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,095
And I am Cleopatra,
queen, daughter of Isis!

497
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:41,599
If I say so and when I say so,
you are what I say you are...

498
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,393
nothing more.

499
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,853
Hail Caesar!

500
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:53,403
You, descendant of inbred generations
of incestuous mental defectives...

501
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,281
- ...how dare you call anyone barbarian.
- Barbarian!

502
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,701
Daughter of a drunkard who
bribed his way to the throne.

503
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:04,080
- Your price was too high, remember?
- I've had my fill with you pretenders...

504
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:08,167
- ...parading on ruins of your past glories.
- Only the future concerns me.

505
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,963
- Keep out of my affairs, do as I say.
- Do as you say?

506
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,256
Literally?

507
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,758
As if I were something
you had conquered?

508
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,761
If I choose to regard you as such.

509
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:24,100
Am I to understand that you're free
to do with me whatever you want...

510
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,019
whenever you want?

511
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,230
Yes, I want that understood.

512
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,279
Won't you at least wear
your laurel wreath...

513
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,867
so I can be reminded it's
the divine Caesar that honors me so?

514
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,411
You talk too much.

515
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,582
I promise you...

516
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,959
you won't like me this way.

517
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,506
Caesar! An attack on the moon gate!

518
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,468
The moon gate.
An attack in force!

519
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,037
Those ballistas need eliminating.

520
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,206
Send out a turtle.

521
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,753
Form the turtle!

522
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,623
Now is the time for us to attack!

523
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,125
- No.
- We have a full legion in reserve.

524
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,211
We hold our positions here.

525
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,810
Two hours till dawn.
We'll hold where we are.

526
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,771
- And what happens at dawn?
- I thought you knew.

527
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,981
The sun comes up.

528
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,307
Tell the men they've won.

529
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,977
Liberty and wine
for defenders of the gate.

530
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:40,022
All reserves, cavalry, every man
available, move out behind Achillas.

531
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,526
- We have him in a vise.
- What is the other half of this vise?

532
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,988
Rufio and the armies of Mithradates.
He left last night to meet them.

533
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,866
Mithradates? How could
he get here this fast?

534
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,118
I sent him when we sailed for Egypt.

535
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:57,081
No general in his right mind can
hold Alexandria with two legions...

536
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,668
as you and others have repeatedly
pointed out to me.

537
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,278
I taste your drink,
daughter of Isis...

538
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:31,157
and if there be harm in it,
let the harm fall upon me.

539
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,331
Lotus.

540
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,171
You wiped the rim of the cup
after you tasted it. Why?

541
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,799
Why? So my mouth would not soil it.

542
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,510
Lotus...

543
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,346
taste it again.

544
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,817
Pothinus said he would have me killed.
Forgive me, Majesty.

545
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,071
Forgive me. Forgive me.

546
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,073
I forgive you.

547
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,036
Now drink it.

548
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:50,861
Apollodorus!

549
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,911
Great silence
for Gaius Julius Caesar...

550
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,372
consul of the senate
of the people of Rome.

551
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,749
You will all stand.

552
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,692
Let what is said be recorded...

553
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:33,946
as the judgment and decree
of the Senate and people of Rome.

554
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,033
There is no judgment here.

555
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,785
And the decree not Rome's,
but Cleopatra's.

556
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,038
She has lied to you, Caesar.

557
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,331
She and her slaves lie to you.

558
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,502
You have not been accused, Pothinus.
Thus far.

559
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:53,466
You are now charged with inciting and
abetting war against the Roman army.

560
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,844
You are now charged with plotting
to assassinate Queen Cleopatra.

561
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,347
You are guilty of both.
You are sentenced to death.

562
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,996
It's too bright in here.
Shut out some of the sun.

563
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,262
Are you going to kill me too, Caesar?

564
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,806
What am I accused of?

565
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,977
King Ptolemy is hereby removed
from the protective custody of Rome.

566
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,146
He'll leave within the hour...

567
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,274
and be conducted safely
to the camp of Achillas.

568
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,945
Achillas! You're going to send me
back to my own troops?

569
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,324
He is to be accompanied
by his learned tutor, Theodotus.

570
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,452
Do you hear that?
You'll be saved along with me.

571
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,080
Stop grinning, you little idiot.

572
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:11,085
May I speak?
You know that Achillas is trapped...

573
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,547
between your own legions
and the armies of Mithradates.

574
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:18,050
To send His Majesty to fight
them may mean his death.

575
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,803
An occupational hazard
for those who will be king.

576
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,305
But then certainly not I, Caesar.

577
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,683
I'm no king, nor general.
What do I know of war?

578
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,935
A simple scholar.

579
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,396
A man of thoughts and words.

580
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,732
Too many words. Enough.

581
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,068
Let all be done properly as decreed.

582
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,261
Flavius.

583
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,765
Find Apollodorus.
Return his dagger to him.

584
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,811
You might clean it first.
It has Pothinus all over it.

585
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:15,191
Yes, yes, I know I'm tired.
I promise I'll sleep.

586
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:21,697
You have my apologies
for what almost happened to you.

587
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:26,035
Caesar, will you talk with me
for just a minute?

588
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,621
Yesterday was full.
Tonight was long.

589
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,123
This morning has not been uneventful.

590
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,501
Did you know that Apollodorus
would kill Pothinus?

591
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,797
He was kind enough to wait until Rome
had passed sentence of death.

592
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,467
And my brother...

593
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,135
and Theodotus?

594
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,471
They too will be killed, possibly.

595
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,514
Probably.

596
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,975
Your Majesty, I'm truly weary.

597
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:54,438
You knew all along, didn't you,
that there was no real danger.

598
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:57,858
That Mithradates was on his way
to reinforce you.

599
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,276
Why didn't you tell me?

600
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,570
I said I was prepared.
You wouldn't believe me.

601
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,615
- I really must insist...
- I would've believed you.

602
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,493
- You didn't trust me.
- Not for an instant.

603
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,329
And yet, in these last few minutes...

604
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,582
you have made me undisputed queen.

605
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,293
The sole ruler of Egypt. Why?

606
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,213
Perhaps tomorrow, later in the day,
we could talk.

607
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,548
- Why, Caesar?
- It was best for Rome. Please.

608
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,218
- Best for Egypt.
- For Egypt too.

609
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,137
Cleopatra, get out.
I beg of you, get out.

610
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,748
That will not be needed.

611
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:58,419
It wasn't necessary
for me to betray myself.

612
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,629
I could have
called out for Flavius.

613
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,799
How many new spy-holes
have you dug in the walls?

614
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,552
Are we being watched even now?

615
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,514
If you see Flavius,
you might send him to me.

616
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:14,560
- Still trying to dismiss me?
- What is it you want?

617
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:18,439
- What more do you want?
- To be of help to you.

618
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,984
There never has been help.
There never will be.

619
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,449
Now there is.

620
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,410
One day it'll happen
where I cannot hide.

621
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:34,204
Where the world will see me fall.

622
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,957
I shall tumble down before the mob...

623
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,710
and foam at the mouth
and make them laugh.

624
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,046
And they'll tear me to pieces.

625
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,424
The gods themselves had your sickness.

626
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:49,470
Hannibal, even the great Alexander.

627
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,764
And in the end, they fell.

628
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,308
Were torn to pieces by the mob.

629
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,436
Not you.

630
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,773
I will see to that.

631
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:22,169
In the name of the Senate and the
people of Rome and by their will.

632
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:57,996
Isis herself would surrender her place
in heaven to be as beautiful as you.

633
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:02,000
You're not supposed
to look at me. No one is.

634
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,212
If they aren't looking,
how do they know I am?

635
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,340
You should be kneeling.

636
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:12,636
Would that do
before all these visiting kings?

637
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,598
Making believe
they're not watching us?

638
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:23,730
You have such bony knees.

639
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:28,068
Not only bony, but unaccustomed
to this sort of thing.

640
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,327
If we're to get an early start
in the morning...

641
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,412
What will it be tomorrow?

642
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,164
More wheat?

643
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,959
What I've seen already could feed
more legions than Rome ever had.

644
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,128
There's enough to feed the world.

645
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,922
More gold then.

646
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,799
Why not buy the world?
Surely you have enough.

647
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:37,304
At least enough to pay more legions
than even Rome has ever had.

648
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,556
More granite, more marble...

649
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:43,143
more millions of slaves
to build whatever needs building.

650
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:46,313
Better routes to India,
shorter routes to the East.

651
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,441
What can there be in Egypt
that I haven't seen?

652
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,819
Egypt itself. The reason for Egypt.

653
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,864
My responsibility is Rome.

654
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,326
Alexander understood it...

655
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,746
that from Egypt
he could rule the world.

656
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,376
He was very young.
And you, even younger.

657
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:12,256
At your age, such dreams have a
reality which grows less in time.

658
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,717
Caesar no longer dreams?

659
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,512
Dangerous to a man of my calling.

660
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,140
Necessary, I would have thought.

661
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:42,327
I can't stay away from Rome too long.
There are problems.

662
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:45,581
Messages from Marc Antony
endlessly demanding my return.

663
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,876
And on my way back, wars
to be fought in the east and north.

664
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,672
Even in Rome itself
I'm not without opposition.

665
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,550
Do to them
what you did to Achillas.

666
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,052
This is opposition
of a different sort.

667
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,888
They weave it cleverly, lightly,
like a cobweb.

668
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:06,143
You know what happens when cobwebs
are not regularly swept away.

669
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,396
Do you trust this Marc Antony?

670
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,609
If anyone in the world,
I trust Antony.

671
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:18,238
Let him brush away the cobwebs
for you and stay with me.

672
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,866
You've been declared
dictator for a year.

673
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,243
You can do what you want
with your time.

674
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:27,039
Everything but make it stand still.

675
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,043
If... When you return to Rome...

676
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:35,047
these wars that have to be fought
on the way, are they important?

677
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:39,092
Well, there's no such thing
as an unimportant war.

678
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:43,472
I've been reading in your commentaries
about your campaigns in Gaul.

679
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,141
How does my writing
compare with Catullus?

680
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,561
Well, it's different.

681
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,396
Dull.

682
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,191
Perhaps a little
too much description.

683
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,903
You're being tactful.
Some of my critics, Brutus, for one...

684
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:02,074
tell me my Latin is not only
ungrammatical, but common.

685
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,994
You spared his life more than once.

686
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:09,331
People say it's because
Brutus is your son.

687
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,957
Is that true?

688
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,919
I have no son.

689
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:16,880
- Calpurnia, your third wife...
- Fourth.

690
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:21,009
Married to you how long?
12 years?

691
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,846
And still, Caesar has no son,
no child at all.

692
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,308
It is well-known that
Calpurnia is barren.

693
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,395
A woman who cannot bear children...

694
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,815
is like a river that is dry.

695
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,318
I see no purpose in discussing
the subject further.

696
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:43,657
A woman, too, must make
the barren land fruitful.

697
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:47,953
She must make life grow
where there was no life.

698
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:53,333
Just as the Mother Nile feeds
and replenishes the earth.

699
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,295
I am the Nile.

700
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,552
I will bear many sons.

701
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,263
Isis has told me.

702
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:12,310
My breasts are filled
with love and life.

703
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:16,481
My hips are rounded
and well apart.

704
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,818
Such women, they say...

705
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,154
have sons.

706
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:48,054
That first time
when you stood here alone...

707
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,933
why did you cry?
Will you tell me now?

708
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,686
Because I had lost something.

709
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,397
- What?
- A lifetime.

710
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,900
- Mine.
- Nonsense.

711
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:03,737
Having conquered the world,
he died at 32.

712
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,989
I am 52.

713
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,701
My remaining ambition is to keep
the world from conquering me.

714
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,541
Your ambitions
must always have been his.

715
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,877
They still must be.

716
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:24,007
Shall I tell you something?
When I was 32 in Spain...

717
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,219
I came upon a statue of Alexander.

718
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,513
I wept then too.

719
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,389
Even then.

720
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,393
I want you to have his sword
to take back with you.

721
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,813
- Too deeply embedded.
- It can be removed.

722
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,940
It's buried in time.

723
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,527
- And Alexander's mantle?
- Too heavy for Caesar.

724
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,240
His dream then.

725
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,410
Make his dream yours, Caesar.

726
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,330
His grand design.

727
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,792
Pick it up where he left off.

728
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,672
Out of the patchwork of conquests...

729
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,757
one world.

730
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,302
And out of one world, one nation.

731
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:13,932
One people on earth living in peace.

732
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,519
So you have told me at last
what it is you want of me.

733
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,104
Of us!

734
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:23,066
At the center, the capital of this
world, one people, one nation...

735
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,442
Alexandria?

736
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,319
- He chose it.
- I am Roman.

737
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:30,365
He was Greek! What will it matter
when we're all one people?

738
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,326
I am 52. He was 32 and failed.

739
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,370
We will succeed.

740
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:39,332
Your dreams, your ambitions.

741
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:43,712
One lifetime is not enough
for such dreams, such ambitions.

742
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,340
The cloak of Alexander
cannot be too heavy...

743
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,052
for Rome and Egypt
to carry together.

744
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:55,307
And what if his sword
is too deeply embedded?

745
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,018
Yours will replace it, Caesar.

746
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,229
You have a way of mixing
politics and passion.

747
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,940
Where does one begin
and the other leave off?

748
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:08,111
That did not start,
nor will it end with me.

749
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:12,324
Cleopatra, whatever it is,
however it comes out...

750
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,576
leave me my destiny.

751
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:19,706
Your destiny
is no longer just yours.

752
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,875
It's mine too.

753
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:27,380
Soon, there will be someone to
carry both the cloak of Alexander...

754
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,884
and the sword of Caesar...

755
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,219
and the name of Caesar.

756
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:38,016
And in that name he will rule Egypt.

757
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:42,771
And whatever part or all
of the world that we give him...

758
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:45,857
our child...

759
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:50,028
will be a son for you, Caesar.

760
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,949
By Isis, I swear it.

761
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,166
Could you put off
your return to Rome...

762
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,543
just long enough?

763
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:35,949
I came as quickly as I could.

764
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:41,329
Antony is welcome to Caesar's house
as often and as quickly as he likes.

765
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:45,083
As Caesar's wife, before truth
is distorted into vicious gossip...

766
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:49,462
- I wanted you to hear...
- That my husband has married Cleopatra.

767
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:55,301
There's some fresh wine.
One of your many favorites.

768
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:01,391
The ceremony, according to vicious
gossip, was in the Egyptian religion.

769
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:04,269
Even if true, that can't be
taken seriously.

770
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:08,023
During which he was formally
declared an Egyptian god.

771
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:10,942
Officially divine, at last.

772
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,695
That must have pleased Caesar.

773
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:17,449
Calpurnia, we know Caesar, you and I.

774
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,910
This so-called marriage
has no validity under Roman law.

775
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,163
There must be political purpose to it.

776
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,624
Perhaps a symbolic ceremony
to ratify Rome's alliance with Egypt.

777
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,170
Perhaps merely
indulging some barbaric custom.

778
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,589
You've been loyal and kind.

779
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:35,341
You came as quickly
as you could.

780
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:39,429
Unhappily, vicious gossip
travels even faster than you...

781
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:41,389
and the truth.

782
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:46,394
Have you heard, for instance, that
Cleopatra is carrying Caesar's child?

783
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,565
Yes, Antony.

784
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,650
We know him...

785
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,944
you and I.

786
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,304
There shall be...

787
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:23,389
There shall be...

788
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,517
Rome.

789
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,103
Mighty and alone and unloved.

790
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:30,271
A mistress.

791
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,983
A mistress shall raise thee again
from earth to heaven...

792
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:39,364
and all the world shall know
a golden age ofjustice and of love.

793
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:47,413
A son shall be born to Isis!

794
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,250
Rome shall know him in cloth of gold.

795
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:54,796
The East shall see him laden
with jewels and treasure.

796
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:58,258
A son of Egypt and of Rome!

797
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:07,100
Here shall he find his destiny!

798
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:42,552
Do exactly as I tell you.

799
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:45,263
When the child is born...

800
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:49,142
after he is anointed
and named royal prince...

801
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,144
take him to Caesar.

802
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:52,645
Bring Caesar here.

803
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:57,150
No. Exactly as I tell you.

804
01:09:57,401 --> 01:10:01,279
Take the child to Caesar,
in front of his men.

805
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,406
Do you understand?

806
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,326
In front of all the Romans.

807
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:11,247
Lay him at Caesar's feet.

808
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,292
At Caesar's feet.

809
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,753
I will do just as you say.

810
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,315
Fear not.
We have never lost a Caesar.

811
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:41,152
That remark was insubordinate
and in bad taste!

812
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,621
Caesar, remember Roman law.

813
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:54,749
If you pick up this child
you acknowledge it's yours...

814
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,502
and a citizen of Rome,
as your heir.

815
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,737
A son.

816
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,493
I have a son!

817
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,496
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!

818
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:41,838
He's been made king of Egypt.

819
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,757
They have named their bastard
Caesarion.

820
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,467
Prince Caesarion.

821
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,762
What better name for the heir
to the throne of Rome.

822
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,639
There is no throne of Rome.

823
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,767
Nor shall there be,
nor would Caesar tolerate one.

824
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,561
But a son!

825
01:11:56,812 --> 01:12:00,189
We know how much he's wanted one.
I am happy for Caesar.

826
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:03,526
Your happiness
is understandable enough.

827
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,529
Now that Caesar has
publicly recognized a son...

828
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,490
one need no longer
wonder about Brutus.

829
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,327
Is it a relief not to be
wondered about, Casca?

830
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,330
To be known openly
as you are for what you are:

831
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,749
Liar, swindler, bully and coward.

832
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:21,085
Brutus, you'll turn Casca's head
with your flattery.

833
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:25,006
And Casca's head, if turned,
will see Marc Antony.

834
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:29,218
A part of Caesar more to be feared
than his infant son.

835
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:34,891
But it is for the good of Rome that
Caesar has stayed so long in Egypt.

836
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:38,353
In his absence, the people
have come to worship him as a god.

837
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:41,898
Why should he return to show himself
as mortal as the rest?

838
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:45,234
There are those
who fear Caesar's ambition.

839
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,654
But what is there to fear?
That he will destroy the republic?

840
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:51,282
Yes, he will.

841
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,368
I promise you he will.

842
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,162
Your tongue is old but sharp, Cicero.

843
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,415
Be careful how you waggle it.
It may cut off your head.

844
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,001
It will more likely
be your sword, Antony.

845
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:05,046
'Tis just as sharp and quicker...

846
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:07,548
and frightened of heads.

847
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:12,804
There'll be a strong smell
of wine in the Senate today.

848
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,056
We must breathe with restraint.

849
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,649
Octavian, this what's his name,
this son of Caesar...

850
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:26,567
does it upset you?

851
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,319
No.

852
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,279
You run off at the mouth so...

853
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,449
one thinks your words
are as precious to you as your gold.

854
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:37,578
Like my gold, I use them
where they are worth most.

855
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:42,375
And your virtue?
My friend has a friend.

856
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,877
That too.

857
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:49,173
You know, it's quite possible,
Octavian, that when you die...

858
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:53,010
you will die without
ever having been alive.

859
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:31,924
I can't leave without saying
goodbye to my son and to you.

860
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:36,137
We thought, your son and I,
that if we came to you...

861
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:39,390
we would have those
few minutes more.

862
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,814
A good thing to remember, my son:

863
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:50,318
What you will not let go,
no one will take from you.

864
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,616
Hail and farewell, little Caesar.

865
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:15,801
Was it a century ago when I was dropped
at your feet, wrapped in a carpet?

866
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:20,056
Or was it last night?

867
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,070
When will you send for us? When?

868
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:37,698
- Soon.
- How soon? When?

869
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,826
So much time must go by
before even I reach Rome.

870
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,371
And then how soon?

871
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,748
Within reasonable time.

872
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,000
Time is never reasonable.

873
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,044
Time is our enemy, Caesar.

874
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:54,423
Am I to conquer it for you?
What plan of battle do you suggest?

875
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,135
I must bring your son to Rome.

876
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,681
Rome must see Caesar's son...

877
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:05,643
who will one day rule
over Caesar's world.

878
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,728
Caesar?

879
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:12,316
I'm afraid the tides
will soon be against you.

880
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:31,794
Not only time, but the tides.

881
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,673
Even as divinities, there seems
little we can do about either.

882
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,482
But only after more than two years...

883
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:57,320
and many wars
in Africa and Asia Minor...

884
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:01,866
was Caesar able to cross over
to Italy and come home at last...

885
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:06,787
to celebrate his triumphs
and see to his affairs.

886
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:31,354
"In recognition, the Senate
has bestowed upon Caesar...

887
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:36,651
the rank, privilege and title
of dictator of Rome for life."

888
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,986
Dictator for life!

889
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:42,281
At long last, he is master of Rome.

890
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:45,618
Apollodorus,
everything must be made ready at once.

891
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,329
- Ships, servants...
- We've been ready for some time.

892
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,457
Surely now nothing
can prevent his sending for us...

893
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,543
if only to attend
his coronation as he did mine.

894
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:58,005
- Your Majesty...
- Three long, wasted years!

895
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,675
Why should the Senate
have taken so long...

896
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:03,678
to recognize what the world
has already known?

897
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:07,098
That Caesar was master of Rome.

898
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,142
Rufio wishes to speak.

899
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,395
Your Majesty seems to misunderstand.

900
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:17,400
It seems quite clear. Caesar has been
declared dictator of Rome for life.

901
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:19,276
True. However, to the Roman...

902
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:22,738
there is a vast difference
between dictator and master.

903
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,282
No man can call himself
master of Rome.

904
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,284
Why not?

905
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:31,288
It has a meaning far too close
to a word no Roman will tolerate:

906
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:32,957
King.

907
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,050
And to be dictator of Rome for life?

908
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:47,680
Is to be granted the lifelong respect
and honor of the Roman people.

909
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:50,891
And the dictates of the dictator?

910
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:55,479
Must in each case, of course,
be approved by the Senate of Rome.

911
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:59,233
Thank you, Rufio.

912
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:08,701
The enemy! The enemy! The enemy!

913
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,007
Sosigenes.

914
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:30,222
You must think it odd that I propose
an invitation to Queen Cleopatra.

915
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,766
Do you?

916
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:35,728
Egypt, after all, has been
officially declared ally of Rome.

917
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:40,024
Still, I confess I was surprised
at some of those who voted in favor.

918
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,400
Were you?

919
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:46,530
May I express my gratitude for being
permitted to attend today's session?

920
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,532
It was truly inspiring...

921
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:52,870
to witness the free will
of free men so fearlessly expressed.

922
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,916
He seemed most anxious to be present.

923
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,044
- I saw no harm in granting him permission.
- Didn't you?

924
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:05,424
After today, never again shall I
doubt the extent of Egypt's wealth.

925
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:07,676
I don't like Cicero's implication.

926
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:11,639
There's not enough gold in Egypt
to buy the honor of a Roman senator.

927
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:15,768
More than enough, it seems,
to buy his vote.

928
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:20,105
How was it now?

929
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:24,735
"Rome will know him in cloth of gold."

930
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:47,466
According to reports, the reception
in the streets has been extraordinary.

931
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:51,011
The queen has instructed
the procession to move slowly...

932
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,556
for the people's enjoyment.

933
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:58,811
I might almost believe Cleopatra set
out to capture the citizens of Rome.

934
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,481
One would have every reason
for believing exactly that.

935
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:33,020
Nothing like this has come
into Rome since Romulus and Remus.

936
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:32,454
How unafraid he is.

937
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,126
Your queen has conquered
the people of Rome.

938
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,796
The people, yes.

939
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:01,019
Now then, walk like a king.
Head up.

940
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,063
Listen to them cheer.

941
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,107
Take your throne.

942
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:07,734
Bow to the right, left.

943
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:11,154
Now an angry glance at someone
who's displeased you.

944
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:15,617
Very good. I tremble.
See me tremble?

945
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,495
No, don't smile.

946
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,415
Not when they're trembling.
It makes them stop.

947
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:24,835
Now the prisoners
are dragged before you, one by one.

948
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:28,380
This one has no power anywhere,
therefore means nothing.

949
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:32,884
But you wish to be known
as a noble ruler. What do you say?

950
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:36,054
I pardon you.

951
01:30:36,305 --> 01:30:39,391
Louder, boy. You pardon somebody,
you want it known.

952
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:43,061
I pardon you!

953
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,482
Now, who comes here?

954
01:30:47,733 --> 01:30:52,154
Once your friend. You trusted him,
and he turned against you.

955
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:54,573
He has power, wealth and family.

956
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:57,951
He kneels.
He begs you to be his friend again.

957
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:00,162
To have you trust him again.

958
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,873
And then? What then, little king?

959
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:15,135
Caesar must wish
what needs commanding.

960
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:18,513
To drain the Pontine Marshes.
To free Rome from malaria.

961
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,474
To fill my belly.

962
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:23,310
To control the Tiber's floods.

963
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:27,397
To improve the harbor at Ostia.
To please my ambition.

964
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:31,276
And must I wish roads to be built,
libraries for public use?

965
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:34,446
The free men of Italy to be equal
citizens to those of Rome?

966
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:37,574
Many of these have merits
and merit our approval.

967
01:31:37,783 --> 01:31:41,995
"Merit your approval." Is Caesar
to come before the Senate each day...

968
01:31:42,246 --> 01:31:45,290
like a schoolboy with his lessons,
now passing, now failing?

969
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:49,503
Do you suggest the Senate no longer
deliberate the welfare of Rome?

970
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:51,796
To end the process of Roman law?

971
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:56,468
I must be the law! And my word
must be the welfare of Rome.

972
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,307
Else, take from me
this meaningless title of dictator.

973
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:05,227
I've carried a sword for too long.

974
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:08,772
I cannot now pretend
with an empty scabbard.

975
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:14,361
Surely Caesar recalls the symbolic
nature of the title "dictator"...

976
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:16,488
at the time it was conferred.

977
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,032
It was to honor Caesar
above all men...

978
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:22,994
and to indicate Rome's gratitude
for Caesar's triumphs in its name.

979
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:28,166
Brutus, I recall them well,
those triumphs.

980
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:29,918
Do you?

981
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:33,129
Pharsalia, for one.
You trembled in Antony's hand...

982
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:36,341
when Antony was hot
to separate you from your head...

983
01:32:36,592 --> 01:32:38,009
with just cause.

984
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:40,929
My command spared your life.

985
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:44,683
There was no deliberating body.
It was not my wish, but my command.

986
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:49,354
By my dictate that you stand here
dribbling virtue out of your mouth.

987
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,106
Sit down.

988
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:56,027
No, I want no more meaningless
privileges and considerations.

989
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:59,114
No more honors designed to pacify me.

990
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:02,492
I would rather have nothing.
Remain what I am at heart.

991
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:05,704
A humble man, anxious only to serve.

992
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,543
Why are the eyes of a statue
always without life?

993
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:16,298
Have any of you here seen the Nile?

994
01:33:16,507 --> 01:33:18,800
Spare yourselves the journey.

995
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,761
She carries it within her eyes.

996
01:33:22,888 --> 01:33:25,265
I suggest, Caesar,
that the hour is late.

997
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:27,392
Very late for Rome.

998
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:29,603
I was speaking, Cassius! I was...

999
01:33:33,357 --> 01:33:34,733
Now, where was I?

1000
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:36,901
"Anxious to serve."

1001
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:42,365
Yes, I've served.
Served for all of my life.

1002
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:45,577
I've won for Rome
more than half of the world.

1003
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:48,830
Most of you owe your honors
and fortunes to me.

1004
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,834
And now I want you to do as I say.

1005
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:55,754
You will appoint me...

1006
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:58,465
emperor of Rome.

1007
01:34:04,263 --> 01:34:06,598
There is no need to resume your seats.

1008
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:11,269
On behalf of all, thank you,
Majesty, for your hospitality.

1009
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:14,939
Good night.

1010
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:21,196
Thank you and good night.

1011
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:35,251
They resent being summoned here for
meetings properly held in the Senate.

1012
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:37,671
Resent it, do they?

1013
01:34:38,881 --> 01:34:41,132
I cannot understand...

1014
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:46,012
that the eyes of a statue
should be always without life.

1015
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,686
They resent me.

1016
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:55,522
To flaunt me like this.

1017
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:59,150
They'll use it to keep from you
that which is already yours.

1018
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:03,738
By divine right, is that not so?

1019
01:35:05,574 --> 01:35:07,867
Yes. It is.

1020
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:12,080
By divine right.

1021
01:35:12,581 --> 01:35:17,293
We shall have the Senate,
in its deliberations, deliberate that.

1022
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,805
Are you quite sure
what it is you want...

1023
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,390
so desperately?

1024
01:35:30,599 --> 01:35:33,268
I've always been sure.

1025
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:35,603
And Caesar?

1026
01:35:37,481 --> 01:35:39,357
Does anyone speak for him?

1027
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,778
No.

1028
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:46,072
Good night.

1029
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:56,416
Tell me, Brutus, is it proper
to stand before this new goddess...

1030
01:35:56,667 --> 01:36:00,295
- ...Caesar has set here in the temple?
- Or must we, as Romans, kneel?

1031
01:36:00,504 --> 01:36:04,674
Not yet. See there, where room
has been left for another deity?

1032
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:08,845
When the god Caesar stands beside
the goddess Cleopatra...

1033
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,014
then Rome will crawl before them.

1034
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:12,891
When that day comes, if it comes.

1035
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:17,103
- He demanded we make him emperor.
- Once. That one night, it was his sickness.

1036
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:20,064
His sickness grows worse.
In the end, it will kill us.

1037
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:24,360
He asked once to be made emperor,
but he's since decreed himself a god!

1038
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:29,157
Emperor and god. No longer just king,
but emperor and god!

1039
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:32,911
- Brutus, open your eyes!
- What do you want of me?

1040
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,747
When the people think
upon the honor of Rome...

1041
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:38,166
they think upon one man:
He is Brutus.

1042
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:41,252
By that honor and
by the responsibility you carry...

1043
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:44,005
Brutus, save Rome from Caesar!

1044
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,716
You cannot ask me to destroy him.

1045
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:50,094
Then let Caesar destroy Rome.

1046
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:11,783
Antony has just come from a meeting
of my friends with good news.

1047
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:16,329
Tomorrow at the Senate, Lucius Cotta
will move that I be made king.

1048
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,456
It will pass.

1049
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:21,626
But I don't understand.

1050
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,962
King and emperor.

1051
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,797
And it will pass?

1052
01:37:26,048 --> 01:37:28,550
The last few months,
I've been enjoying...

1053
01:37:28,759 --> 01:37:31,302
one of the few privileges
of being dictator.

1054
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,429
I have been appointing senators.

1055
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:37,851
Slightly more than half the Senate
has been appointed by me.

1056
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:41,688
Once again, the army of Mithradates...

1057
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:44,232
on its way all the time.

1058
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:45,775
It will pass.

1059
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:49,112
Tomorrow, the ides of March,
a day to be remembered...

1060
01:37:49,321 --> 01:37:51,948
the Senate will declare me
king of Rome.

1061
01:37:52,157 --> 01:37:54,242
King, yes, but not of Rome.

1062
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,954
Not of Rome? What are you saying?

1063
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:01,457
They'll offer you king
of the Roman Empire, outside Italy.

1064
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:06,421
They're afraid, Caesar.
Even your friends.

1065
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,298
Afraid of the people.

1066
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:12,510
- Perhaps in time...
- To be afraid of the people.

1067
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,679
To waste time on the people.

1068
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,807
King of all but Rome?

1069
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:21,311
What is there? The huts of Gaul?
The caves of Britain?

1070
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:24,647
The whole of the empire outside Italy.

1071
01:38:25,357 --> 01:38:27,191
I will not accept.

1072
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:30,570
They mean it to be an empty gesture.

1073
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:33,948
Another title to please your fancy,
flatter your ego.

1074
01:38:34,199 --> 01:38:35,617
Nothing more.

1075
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,162
And it will pass.

1076
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,582
Then accept it, Caesar.

1077
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:45,418
I have never settled
for half a victory.

1078
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:49,172
Nor will you now.
Caesar, mighty Caesar...

1079
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:52,091
all I can say
is what you've taught me:

1080
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:56,721
Take a little, then a little more
until finally you have it all.

1081
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:59,599
Let them declare you king.

1082
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:02,852
Even if it's only
of a tree in Asia Minor.

1083
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:04,812
The rest will come to you.

1084
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:08,232
To redo once more everything
I have already done?

1085
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:13,404
It's what you have never done, what
you never conquered that waits for you.

1086
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:18,493
The great legions of Rome in the outer
empire that will become your legions.

1087
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:22,747
The gold, the power of Egypt.
Your Egypt.

1088
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:27,377
Caesar, you can conquer
and hold the world as your own.

1089
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:30,213
Won't you understand?

1090
01:39:30,422 --> 01:39:34,467
Kings are not elected.
Gods are not elected.

1091
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:38,805
Why, not only Rome but all of Italy
upon which Rome stands...

1092
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:41,724
must fall in your hands
like a drop of sweat.

1093
01:39:41,934 --> 01:39:43,893
Let them make you what they choose.

1094
01:39:44,144 --> 01:39:46,562
I'll serve with you.
My legions with yours.

1095
01:39:46,772 --> 01:39:51,901
Together we'll conquer a world beyond
the wildest dreams of even Alexander.

1096
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:54,946
Rome.
What was Rome when Sulla died...

1097
01:39:55,197 --> 01:39:58,157
when Crassus lost the armies
in Parthia?

1098
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:01,160
These same men came after me
through the streets...

1099
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:05,081
howling like frightened dogs,
"Caesar, save us!"

1100
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:07,583
They would've made me king then.

1101
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:10,253
I wouldn't let them then.

1102
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:24,100
He was thrown over the wall.
It's not a pretty sight.

1103
01:40:24,476 --> 01:40:26,519
Titus, the moneylender.

1104
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:30,273
Why should he be killed savagely
and brought here?

1105
01:40:30,482 --> 01:40:33,401
Obviously, I am being warned.

1106
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:35,445
Perhaps I am next.

1107
01:40:35,654 --> 01:40:37,822
They dare to threaten you?

1108
01:40:38,073 --> 01:40:40,908
- Caesarion. Where was my son...?
- Not far away.

1109
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,077
It frightened him.

1110
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:53,421
- Lepidus, how many legions has he now?
- Fifteen. Perhaps more.

1111
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:55,423
- Where?
- Scythia.

1112
01:40:55,674 --> 01:40:58,009
You and I will dine
with Lepidus tonight.

1113
01:40:58,218 --> 01:41:02,096
We'll talk of armies and battlefields
and lists of men to die.

1114
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:06,684
Tomorrow in the Senate, let them offer
the sands of Libya as my kingdom...

1115
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:08,853
I will accept.

1116
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:51,395
This is great Caesar...

1117
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,689
beloved by Rome...

1118
01:41:54,566 --> 01:41:57,110
and at least one of us...

1119
01:41:57,319 --> 01:42:00,613
who must die so that Rome may live.

1120
01:42:00,864 --> 01:42:05,576
If it must be done, then let us do it
unashamed and unafraid.

1121
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:09,747
If the world is to know that
it is Rome that will not have a king...

1122
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:14,168
then let us make it the honorable
act of free men in the light of day.

1123
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:16,546
In the light of what day, Brutus?

1124
01:42:16,755 --> 01:42:18,506
Tomorrow?

1125
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:23,302
In the curia of the Senate?

1126
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:27,265
And shall we be armed, all of us?

1127
01:42:32,646 --> 01:42:37,275
Decimus, come to Caesar's villa early
tomorrow to escort him to the Senate.

1128
01:42:37,484 --> 01:42:41,779
Cimber, Marc Antony must not enter
the curia with Caesar.

1129
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:46,617
On a pretext, lead him aside to speak
of what you heard at Lepidus' house.

1130
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:49,328
I remember something odd.

1131
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:52,123
At one point,
Caesar asked of each of us...

1132
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:55,126
what manner of death
we would choose.

1133
01:42:55,377 --> 01:42:58,963
And Caesar, when it came to him,
looked straight at me and said:

1134
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:01,048
"Sudden."

1135
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:05,011
Odd, isn't it?

1136
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:30,494
I was afraid I'd find you
still asleep.

1137
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:34,040
Caesarion is.
He was awake most of the night.

1138
01:43:34,249 --> 01:43:36,042
Did the storm frighten him?

1139
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:40,213
He said not, but it did.
I could tell.

1140
01:43:40,422 --> 01:43:42,215
Have you time to come in?

1141
01:43:42,424 --> 01:43:47,094
Decimus awaits. He came by expressly
to accompany me to the Senate.

1142
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:49,764
Decimus? Has he done this before?

1143
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:51,599
A shrewd politician.

1144
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:55,436
He hopes to benefit
by arriving with me, this day of days.

1145
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:58,064
Keep Antony close by.

1146
01:43:59,983 --> 01:44:01,859
You too?

1147
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:05,029
The ladies of Rome seem to have caught
each other's fears this morning.

1148
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,031
Like a head cold.

1149
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:10,451
Calpurnia pleaded with me
not to go to the Senate at all.

1150
01:44:10,661 --> 01:44:14,080
Why? Why would she
not want you to go?

1151
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:16,540
Oh, the bad night. Nothing else.

1152
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:20,253
She awoke screaming in her sleep.
The thunder, the lightning.

1153
01:44:20,462 --> 01:44:24,674
She dreamed that she saw me murdered.
That she saw me...

1154
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:27,093
or a statue of me covered in blood.

1155
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:30,846
The servants told her of seeing
men of fire in the heavens...

1156
01:44:31,056 --> 01:44:33,057
odd happenings and so forth.

1157
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:35,977
Strange birds were seen in the Forum.

1158
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:41,274
One flew into the Senate carrying a
sprig of laurel which it dropped...

1159
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:44,068
at the base of Pompey's statue.

1160
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:45,945
Pompey?

1161
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:51,659
- Caesar, I'm afraid.
- You must not tell me to stay away.

1162
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:54,078
Shall I too be afraid?

1163
01:44:54,329 --> 01:44:58,541
Can it be said of Caesar, he gave up
the world because of a thunderstorm?

1164
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:02,628
That such divinity that was in him ran
before mortal superstition?

1165
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:05,548
I feel you need me now...

1166
01:45:05,757 --> 01:45:07,550
and I cannot help you.

1167
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:12,930
Then help me to live as I have lived,
always differently from the rest.

1168
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:17,476
The others, for whom life is merely
an endless fear of dying.

1169
01:45:19,062 --> 01:45:20,771
Your gods...

1170
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:23,899
and mine go with you, Caesar.

1171
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:30,281
The world, except for you,
is filled with little men.

1172
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:41,685
Fire burns.

1173
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,189
The winds of destruction blow.

1174
01:46:46,942 --> 01:46:48,901
Rome...

1175
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:53,155
mighty and alone, the winds of
destruction blow down upon thee!

1176
01:46:53,365 --> 01:46:55,574
Storms and hail
shall cut down wheat...

1177
01:46:55,784 --> 01:46:58,661
shall cut down birds
and living things of earth.

1178
01:46:58,870 --> 01:47:01,080
The heavens...

1179
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:04,041
and the gods themselves.

1180
01:49:17,008 --> 01:49:19,552
My son!

1181
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:38,445
Caesar! Caesar!

1182
01:52:23,486 --> 01:52:25,654
I would've come sooner.
There was much to do.

1183
01:52:25,822 --> 01:52:28,699
And it seems you have
done it extremely well.

1184
01:52:31,202 --> 01:52:33,328
Is that where...?

1185
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:34,955
Yes.

1186
01:52:37,959 --> 01:52:42,671
In Egypt, we build eternal monuments
to our dead heroes.

1187
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:45,883
Here, you burn them like rubbish.

1188
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:47,259
Goodbye.

1189
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:50,596
I've brought the 10th Legion
and Rufio. You have nothing to fear.

1190
01:52:51,931 --> 01:52:55,559
Nothing to fear?
That's no reason for staying.

1191
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:59,188
So much has happened so quickly.

1192
01:52:59,397 --> 01:53:02,691
Suddenly I have the pieces
of a broken world to pick up:

1193
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:05,778
Caesar, you running off
at night like this.

1194
01:53:05,987 --> 01:53:07,946
Do you suggest that I stay? Why?

1195
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:11,992
Don't ask me to be clear about
my feelings right now. I'm tired.

1196
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:15,621
And with you,
it's never easy to say my meaning.

1197
01:53:16,372 --> 01:53:19,416
But you speak so well, Antony.

1198
01:53:19,626 --> 01:53:22,878
I've been told how excitingly
you read Caesar's will...

1199
01:53:23,087 --> 01:53:27,132
to the sobbing, murdering,
free citizens of Rome.

1200
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:31,845
Naming as his heir
his great nephew, Octavian!

1201
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:34,598
I knew Caesar's will
and the reasons for it.

1202
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,725
If Octavian hadn't been named...

1203
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:40,062
how many hours or minutes
would you and your son have survived?

1204
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:44,066
And if Caesar had become truly king...

1205
01:53:44,275 --> 01:53:47,319
do you believe he would
still have named Octavian?

1206
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:51,782
In any case, it's over.

1207
01:53:51,991 --> 01:53:53,659
Caesar...

1208
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:56,912
and the dream
that was murdered with him.

1209
01:53:57,622 --> 01:54:00,040
First Alexander's...

1210
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:03,168
then Caesar's.

1211
01:54:03,378 --> 01:54:05,420
Now over. Finished.

1212
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:08,257
- First, Rome must be put in order.
- Rome again.

1213
01:54:08,466 --> 01:54:11,176
Brutus, Cassius and the others
must be found and killed.

1214
01:54:11,427 --> 01:54:12,803
- Then?
- Then in death...

1215
01:54:13,054 --> 01:54:17,099
Caesar must be granted the power
and title he was denied in life. Deified, even.

1216
01:54:17,308 --> 01:54:21,186
A dead king, a dead god.
Safe enough even for Rome.

1217
01:54:21,437 --> 01:54:26,525
Caesarion as Caesar's son could claim
both the title of king and his deification.

1218
01:54:27,193 --> 01:54:31,154
And to what court of law
would my son and I take our claim?

1219
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:34,658
I will present it
to the Roman Senate myself.

1220
01:54:37,036 --> 01:54:39,663
I believe you would.

1221
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:43,292
And after the noble senators
have stopped laughing...

1222
01:54:43,501 --> 01:54:46,753
do my son and I
then declare war on Rome?

1223
01:54:46,963 --> 01:54:51,466
No. For this,
a Caesar would be needed.

1224
01:54:51,676 --> 01:54:54,261
You have very little time.

1225
01:54:56,598 --> 01:54:58,640
Another Caesar.

1226
01:54:59,017 --> 01:55:03,478
But thank you.
I shall remember your kindness to us.

1227
01:55:03,688 --> 01:55:06,565
- You give up too easily.
- Do I?

1228
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:10,444
Let me come to Alexandria
and talk more with you.

1229
01:55:10,695 --> 01:55:14,698
- Whenever you like.
- Now. Tonight, if I could.

1230
01:55:17,076 --> 01:55:19,286
In any case, try to remember.

1231
01:59:47,513 --> 01:59:51,808
For more than two years did Antony
seek out the assassins of Caesar.

1232
01:59:52,018 --> 01:59:53,810
At last, at Philippi...

1233
01:59:54,061 --> 01:59:58,189
he was able to set against them
his legions and those of Octavian...

1234
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:00,567
who was Caesar's heir.

1235
02:00:00,776 --> 02:00:02,861
Cassius was the first to die...

1236
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:05,071
by his own hand.

1237
02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:08,283
Then Brutus and the others.

1238
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:50,927
Hail Antony!

1239
02:01:54,306 --> 02:01:57,600
Hail Antony's legion!

1240
02:02:10,072 --> 02:02:12,240
You remember Philippi.

1241
02:02:12,867 --> 02:02:14,325
He won it.

1242
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:17,287
My lord.

1243
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:21,499
- This way.
- But my tent is this way.

1244
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:28,089
Later. I'll see him later.
Octavian depresses me.

1245
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:30,592
You promised.

1246
02:02:40,853 --> 02:02:43,813
Well, the fighting's over.
We've won it all.

1247
02:02:44,065 --> 02:02:46,024
Your health should improve
quickly now.

1248
02:02:46,275 --> 02:02:49,069
Even if I die,
my place is with you on the field.

1249
02:02:49,278 --> 02:02:51,863
- You were wrong to prevent me.
- Caesar was ill.

1250
02:02:52,073 --> 02:02:55,575
Caesar? Yes. I keep forgetting.

1251
02:02:55,785 --> 02:02:58,495
I have inherited the name.
I have made it mine.

1252
02:02:58,704 --> 02:03:02,707
Why not? You'll never be confused
with the other one.

1253
02:03:03,167 --> 02:03:06,544
At least your troops
fought bravely, under my command.

1254
02:03:06,754 --> 02:03:09,506
Agrippa has kept me fully informed.

1255
02:03:09,757 --> 02:03:11,299
What were you doing there?

1256
02:03:11,509 --> 02:03:15,303
The battle was fought on land, between
men, not wood bumping on water.

1257
02:03:15,513 --> 02:03:18,765
Why did you bring Agrippa?
Were you expecting rain?

1258
02:03:18,974 --> 02:03:21,935
Shall we choose a piece of land,
just you and I?

1259
02:03:22,186 --> 02:03:24,646
Be quiet. There are matters
to talk about.

1260
02:03:24,855 --> 02:03:27,690
Have you an objection
to Agrippa remaining?

1261
02:03:28,609 --> 02:03:32,737
I object to Agrippa at all times.

1262
02:03:38,035 --> 02:03:39,953
Lying here, indisposed...

1263
02:03:40,204 --> 02:03:43,289
you must have had time
to consider the problem.

1264
02:03:43,541 --> 02:03:46,626
I think it is best
to continue the Triumvirate.

1265
02:03:46,836 --> 02:03:50,046
You and I and Lepidus.

1266
02:03:50,256 --> 02:03:51,923
Very well.

1267
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:56,136
Lepidus shall have Africa and
the islands. You, Spain and Gaul.

1268
02:03:56,345 --> 02:04:00,473
Rome and Italy to be administered
by the three of us, jointly.

1269
02:04:00,724 --> 02:04:03,268
- And you?
- All the rest.

1270
02:04:04,436 --> 02:04:07,772
Then, with Lepidus in Africa
and you in the East...

1271
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:11,109
bringing order to Rome and Italy
will be my problem.

1272
02:04:11,318 --> 02:04:13,820
- So it seems.
- Spain and Gaul aren't enough.

1273
02:04:14,071 --> 02:04:15,363
I'll need money.

1274
02:04:15,614 --> 02:04:18,616
- There have been tax riots in Rome.
- So I've heard.

1275
02:04:20,661 --> 02:04:21,703
Done.

1276
02:04:25,374 --> 02:04:26,958
And done.

1277
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:53,234
Would Caesar approve, do you think?

1278
02:04:53,444 --> 02:04:57,822
Definitely. Perhaps the veil of Isis
would have bothered him a bit.

1279
02:04:58,032 --> 02:04:59,908
Three years...

1280
02:05:00,117 --> 02:05:04,037
and Rome remembers him
only by the image on a gold coin.

1281
02:05:04,246 --> 02:05:06,831
Are they those I brought back with me?

1282
02:05:07,041 --> 02:05:09,000
When Octavian had them struck off...

1283
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:12,212
it was to commemorate
Caesar's deification.

1284
02:05:12,421 --> 02:05:17,133
So that he could inherit Caesar's
divinity together with all the rest.

1285
02:05:17,384 --> 02:05:20,178
Even a dead god
cannot rewrite his will.

1286
02:05:20,429 --> 02:05:23,389
Antony did present
Caesarion's claims to the Senate.

1287
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:26,309
He kept that much of his promise.

1288
02:05:27,019 --> 02:05:29,187
And he will keep the rest of it.

1289
02:05:29,396 --> 02:05:32,357
After almost three years
since Caesar's death...

1290
02:05:32,566 --> 02:05:34,567
more than a year
since Philippi?

1291
02:05:34,777 --> 02:05:38,154
Antony will come. He will need Egypt.

1292
02:05:38,364 --> 02:05:40,531
Egypt is you.

1293
02:05:40,741 --> 02:05:45,161
That's what I meant, of course.
Antony will need me.

1294
02:05:50,918 --> 02:05:53,378
Finances! My head hurts
when you talk of money.

1295
02:05:53,629 --> 02:05:55,171
Change the subject.

1296
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:58,925
All right. News from Rome.

1297
02:05:59,176 --> 02:06:02,887
Octavian has forced Lepidus
out of his command and into exile.

1298
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:11,646
I wish I hadn't...
I wish I had not drunk so much today.

1299
02:06:11,855 --> 02:06:13,731
So do I.

1300
02:06:14,483 --> 02:06:17,068
Do I trouble you, Rufio?

1301
02:06:17,695 --> 02:06:19,362
Yes, you do.

1302
02:06:22,032 --> 02:06:25,702
I'll wager Caesar was never befuddled
by wine. Nothing befuddled Caesar

1303
02:06:25,953 --> 02:06:28,329
The campaign against Parthia
won't be easy.

1304
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:31,541
- How many legions have we left?
- It's hard to tell.

1305
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:34,836
- So many desertions.
- Desertions?

1306
02:06:35,045 --> 02:06:37,505
They haven't been paid in months.

1307
02:06:39,591 --> 02:06:41,926
You remember when
we started into Greece?

1308
02:06:42,136 --> 02:06:45,221
I lived with them, ate with them.
I was one of them.

1309
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:48,933
They seem distant to me now,
as if they were a memory.

1310
02:06:53,105 --> 02:06:55,898
We must find the gold to pay them...

1311
02:06:56,108 --> 02:07:00,069
the wheat to feed them,
supplies, ships, armor.

1312
02:07:00,321 --> 02:07:03,573
And where do you suggest
we look for all these?

1313
02:07:03,866 --> 02:07:06,701
- I thought perhaps further to the east.
- Syria?

1314
02:07:07,745 --> 02:07:10,246
- Perhaps more to the south.
- Ethiopia?

1315
02:07:11,165 --> 02:07:12,206
To the north...

1316
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:14,208
- I forbid you to mention her!
- I didn't.

1317
02:07:14,418 --> 02:07:17,253
I won't crawl to her!
Why hasn't she offered assistance?

1318
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,922
- She may not know.
- She knows everything.

1319
02:07:20,132 --> 02:07:23,259
- If only out of gratitude...
- Perhaps she'll express it in person.

1320
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:26,262
Then let her come to me.
Am I so much less than Caesar?

1321
02:07:26,472 --> 02:07:29,807
Nor is she less than Cleopatra,
queen of Egypt, and you promised...

1322
02:07:30,017 --> 02:07:32,727
Queen. Strip them naked,
they're no longer queens.

1323
02:07:32,936 --> 02:07:36,314
It is also difficult
to tell the rank of a naked general.

1324
02:07:36,982 --> 02:07:40,276
And generals without armies
are naked, indeed.

1325
02:07:41,236 --> 02:07:44,364
All right. I'll meet her halfway.

1326
02:07:44,615 --> 02:07:46,115
I'll send you to her.

1327
02:07:46,325 --> 02:07:50,119
- You order her to come.
- If I am to order her, I need not journey.

1328
02:07:50,371 --> 02:07:51,954
- Then summon her.
- Even worse.

1329
02:07:52,164 --> 02:07:54,999
Then beg, entreat, cajole,
find the word you like...

1330
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:59,462
pour perfume, whinny like a stallion.
But see that she comes to me.

1331
02:08:00,255 --> 02:08:02,840
I understand your position, Rufio.

1332
02:08:03,092 --> 02:08:05,426
Surely you must understand mine.

1333
02:08:05,636 --> 02:08:09,180
I do not intend to join
that long list of queens...

1334
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:12,934
who have quivered happily
at being summoned by Lord Antony.

1335
02:08:13,185 --> 02:08:15,311
But surely I didn't say "summoned."

1336
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:18,731
You said "invite." He meant "summon."

1337
02:08:18,982 --> 02:08:22,193
In any case, I am the queen of Egypt.

1338
02:08:22,403 --> 02:08:25,571
And I choose to remain
on Egyptian soil.

1339
02:08:25,823 --> 02:08:29,200
Tarsus is not the other end
of the world, Your Majesty.

1340
02:08:29,451 --> 02:08:32,787
If it were one step from Egypt,
that would be too far.

1341
02:08:34,123 --> 02:08:37,625
I will meet with Lord Antony...

1342
02:08:38,752 --> 02:08:41,254
but only on Egyptian soil.

1343
02:08:42,381 --> 02:08:46,592
My lady, a way must be found,
a time, a place to satisfy you both.

1344
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:48,719
Must it, Rufio?

1345
02:10:05,255 --> 02:10:07,298
Cleopatra.

1346
02:10:31,114 --> 02:10:33,157
Cleopatra!

1347
02:10:37,788 --> 02:10:39,497
It is.

1348
02:10:39,748 --> 02:10:41,499
It must be.

1349
02:10:59,142 --> 02:11:01,435
She said never,
except on Egyptian soil.

1350
02:11:01,687 --> 02:11:04,188
"Never." Something
women say to begin with.

1351
02:11:04,439 --> 02:11:06,607
Welcome Queen Cleopatra on my behalf.

1352
02:11:06,775 --> 02:11:09,986
Extend my invitation
to a banquet in her honor.

1353
02:11:10,195 --> 02:11:12,905
- Don't you think...?
- Still not convinced Rufio?

1354
02:11:13,115 --> 02:11:16,826
Hurry back, there's much to be done.
Have the cooks sent to me.

1355
02:11:53,572 --> 02:11:57,158
Forgive me, noble Rufio.
It is you who do not understand.

1356
02:11:57,367 --> 02:12:01,996
Queen Cleopatra, at present in her
chamber, is on Egyptian territory...

1357
02:12:02,205 --> 02:12:03,956
and intends to remain on it.

1358
02:12:04,166 --> 02:12:06,751
Most learned Sosigenes, forgive me...

1359
02:12:07,002 --> 02:12:09,170
but this is Tarsus, not Alexandria.

1360
02:12:09,379 --> 02:12:13,174
You are on Tarsus, noble Rufio.
I am on Egypt.

1361
02:12:13,467 --> 02:12:17,887
Tonight and tomorrow night, if Lord
Antony desires to meet Her Majesty...

1362
02:12:18,096 --> 02:12:21,265
he will come to her, to Egypt.

1363
02:12:23,101 --> 02:12:26,687
I shall do my best, learned friend,
to prevail upon Lord Antony to attend.

1364
02:14:23,013 --> 02:14:25,806
Marc Antony, how prompt you are.

1365
02:14:26,016 --> 02:14:28,809
If I had not been,
it would be unforgivable of me.

1366
02:14:29,019 --> 02:14:32,104
I had hoped to be here to
welcome you as you came aboard.

1367
02:14:32,314 --> 02:14:34,982
If you had been, it would be
unforgivable of me.

1368
02:14:35,233 --> 02:14:38,986
Be more tolerant.
Forgive yourself now and then.

1369
02:14:41,156 --> 02:14:44,742
Almost three years. Have you
possibly become more beautiful?

1370
02:14:44,993 --> 02:14:47,661
Almost three? That long?

1371
02:14:47,871 --> 02:14:49,830
The time has passed so quickly.

1372
02:14:49,998 --> 02:14:53,918
Your necklace.
It seems to be made of gold coins.

1373
02:14:54,169 --> 02:14:56,754
Coins of Caesar.

1374
02:14:57,005 --> 02:14:59,632
- Do you find it attractive?
- Very.

1375
02:14:59,841 --> 02:15:03,010
And I find what you're wearing
most becoming.

1376
02:15:03,261 --> 02:15:04,428
Greek, isn't it?

1377
02:15:04,679 --> 02:15:07,348
I have a fondness
for almost all Greek things.

1378
02:15:07,557 --> 02:15:11,644
As an almost all-Greek thing,
I'm flattered.

1379
02:15:16,358 --> 02:15:18,442
An unusual necklace.

1380
02:15:18,693 --> 02:15:21,028
Nothing but gold coins of Caesar.

1381
02:15:21,238 --> 02:15:23,864
- How did you come by it?
- I had it made.

1382
02:15:24,157 --> 02:15:26,242
I wear it always.

1383
02:16:26,344 --> 02:16:28,220
A fabulous feast.

1384
02:16:28,930 --> 02:16:32,141
One is so limited
when one travels by ship.

1385
02:16:32,434 --> 02:16:34,143
This fabulous ship...

1386
02:16:34,436 --> 02:16:37,605
together with its queen,
the fabulous Cleopatra.

1387
02:16:39,232 --> 02:16:43,360
The name of Marc Antony
is not exactly unknown to the world.

1388
02:16:43,612 --> 02:16:47,323
- In the last year or so since we met...
- Almost three.

1389
02:16:47,824 --> 02:16:51,827
By now you have become
one-third the master of Rome.

1390
02:16:52,621 --> 02:16:55,289
You don't permit yourself
to forget him, is that it?

1391
02:16:55,957 --> 02:16:59,293
That's an odd way of putting it.
"Don't permit myself"?

1392
02:16:59,502 --> 02:17:02,129
Is it necessary
to wear him around your neck?

1393
02:17:03,048 --> 02:17:06,467
You forget, Antony,
in these almost three years...

1394
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:08,886
how full your own life has been.

1395
02:17:09,512 --> 02:17:13,474
They can't have been uneventful
for you. You rule Egypt alone.

1396
02:17:13,683 --> 02:17:16,352
Oh, they have been busy, but not full.

1397
02:17:16,645 --> 02:17:18,062
There's a difference.

1398
02:17:18,313 --> 02:17:21,982
There cannot be enough hours
in the days of a queen...

1399
02:17:22,192 --> 02:17:24,318
and her nights have too many.

1400
02:17:24,778 --> 02:17:27,696
- So I fill them with memories.
- Of Caesar?

1401
02:17:28,073 --> 02:17:29,907
And of a dream...

1402
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:31,909
that almost came true.

1403
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,494
You may remember.

1404
02:17:33,787 --> 02:17:37,915
I remember that night in Rome,
saying it could still come true.

1405
02:17:38,416 --> 02:17:42,211
You said so much that night
to so many.

1406
02:17:58,311 --> 02:17:59,728
Let me get rid of them all.

1407
02:18:00,021 --> 02:18:02,690
Why? I have arranged
an entertainment.

1408
02:18:02,899 --> 02:18:06,944
A dance in the Greek fashion
to welcome the god Bacchus.

1409
02:18:07,195 --> 02:18:10,572
If I make a great show of going,
they'll have to leave too.

1410
02:18:10,824 --> 02:18:13,325
Then I can return...

1411
02:18:13,535 --> 02:18:16,870
and we can talk alone, you and I.

1412
02:18:17,205 --> 02:18:21,375
- When would you return?
- In an hour, no more than two.

1413
02:18:21,584 --> 02:18:26,213
- How long would you stay?
- Until we had nothing more to say.

1414
02:18:27,090 --> 02:18:31,427
Are you a strong swimmer?
We sail at sunrise.

1415
02:18:33,138 --> 02:18:34,972
I don't understand.

1416
02:18:35,223 --> 02:18:38,934
Home to Alexandria, to Egypt.

1417
02:18:39,269 --> 02:18:43,230
You've come all this way for one
night. All to make a fool of me.

1418
02:18:44,399 --> 02:18:46,567
Perhaps you would feel less a fool...

1419
02:18:46,735 --> 02:18:49,403
if you stayed the night with me,
is that it?

1420
02:18:52,157 --> 02:18:54,366
I've told you before.

1421
02:18:54,576 --> 02:18:57,745
With you, words do not
come easily to me.

1422
02:18:57,954 --> 02:19:00,581
There is too much unsaid
within me that I cannot say.

1423
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:02,499
Then I cannot know it.

1424
02:19:02,751 --> 02:19:04,752
There is much unsaid within you too.

1425
02:19:04,961 --> 02:19:07,671
That is probably true of everybody.

1426
02:19:07,922 --> 02:19:10,090
Stay for a while.

1427
02:19:10,258 --> 02:19:14,803
I have known you so long
but so little. Give me time.

1428
02:19:15,013 --> 02:19:17,931
Not I. Not Egypt and Rome together.

1429
02:19:18,099 --> 02:19:22,311
Not even the gods
have time to give you.

1430
02:19:22,937 --> 02:19:25,439
But, Antony, use what you have.

1431
02:19:25,648 --> 02:19:30,444
Don't waste it by playing
at god here in Tarsus...

1432
02:19:30,695 --> 02:19:35,282
while Octavian in Rome
becomes a god.

1433
02:22:54,899 --> 02:22:57,359
The dance, I take it, is over.

1434
02:22:57,986 --> 02:22:59,528
Sit up.

1435
02:22:59,821 --> 02:23:03,365
I want to see whether you sleep
with your memories.

1436
02:23:08,830 --> 02:23:11,832
With so much left unsaid
within you...

1437
02:23:12,041 --> 02:23:15,168
it must be a relief
to break and tear things.

1438
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:19,339
- I want to say something now.
- Perhaps some other time.

1439
02:23:19,632 --> 02:23:20,674
Now!

1440
02:23:23,511 --> 02:23:25,512
Caesar.

1441
02:23:27,348 --> 02:23:29,766
Conquer and conquer.

1442
02:23:30,018 --> 02:23:32,561
Bring the world to its knees.

1443
02:23:32,854 --> 02:23:36,064
"You're not a Caesar.
Did you know that?"

1444
02:23:37,442 --> 02:23:39,026
Be braver than the bravest...

1445
02:23:39,277 --> 02:23:42,529
stronger than the strongest.
Still no Caesar.

1446
02:23:42,739 --> 02:23:46,783
Caesar's done it first and better.
Ruled better, loved better, fought better.

1447
02:23:47,035 --> 02:23:50,370
Run where you will, you can't get out.
There's no way out.

1448
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:55,083
The shadow of Caesar will cover you
and cover the universe for all of time.

1449
02:23:59,881 --> 02:24:02,049
"Whenever you like," you said in Rome.

1450
02:24:02,258 --> 02:24:04,551
"Come to Alexandria
whenever you like."

1451
02:24:04,802 --> 02:24:06,386
"Now, tonight," I said.

1452
02:24:06,679 --> 02:24:09,723
To bow to the throne
upon which Caesar put you.

1453
02:24:09,932 --> 02:24:13,393
To talk of a new treaty.
Caesar's can't be improved. Copy it.

1454
02:24:13,603 --> 02:24:17,814
Of Caesar's son. Of the dream you shared
with Caesar that still fills your life.

1455
02:24:18,066 --> 02:24:22,819
Alexander's design for a world
to be ruled by you and Caesar.

1456
02:24:23,905 --> 02:24:25,405
Where is Antony?

1457
02:24:25,698 --> 02:24:27,491
Where is Marc Antony?

1458
02:24:27,742 --> 02:24:30,911
Antony the Great! The divine Antony!

1459
02:24:31,287 --> 02:24:32,913
Here.

1460
02:24:33,206 --> 02:24:34,998
He's...

1461
02:24:35,249 --> 02:24:36,958
here.

1462
02:24:37,210 --> 02:24:40,962
One step behind Caesar.
At the right hand of Caesar.

1463
02:24:41,214 --> 02:24:44,424
In the shadow of Caesar.

1464
02:24:45,259 --> 02:24:48,345
Tell me, how many
have loved you since him?

1465
02:24:48,596 --> 02:24:51,515
One? Ten? Anyone? No one?

1466
02:24:51,766 --> 02:24:55,936
Have they kissed you with Caesar's lips?
Is it his name you cry out in the dark?

1467
02:24:56,104 --> 02:24:59,773
Afterwards, has he reproached you
and have you begged forgiveness?

1468
02:25:01,109 --> 02:25:05,278
You've come here, then, running over
with wine and self-pity...

1469
02:25:05,446 --> 02:25:07,447
to conquer Caesar.

1470
02:25:07,657 --> 02:25:11,952
For so long now,
you've filled my life...

1471
02:25:12,537 --> 02:25:17,332
like a great noise
I hear everywhere in my heart.

1472
02:25:18,126 --> 02:25:21,503
I want to be free of you,
of wanting you...

1473
02:25:21,796 --> 02:25:23,255
of being afraid.

1474
02:25:25,842 --> 02:25:28,885
Yet, Caesar would not permit it.

1475
02:25:50,032 --> 02:25:52,159
But I will never...

1476
02:25:52,994 --> 02:25:54,870
be free of you.

1477
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:12,846
From the first instant I saw you...

1478
02:26:13,097 --> 02:26:16,349
entering Rome
on that monstrous stone beast...

1479
02:26:16,559 --> 02:26:19,060
shining in the sun...

1480
02:26:19,312 --> 02:26:22,189
like a little gold toy.

1481
02:26:22,398 --> 02:26:24,357
How I envied Caesar.

1482
02:26:24,567 --> 02:26:26,443
Went suddenly sick with it.

1483
02:26:26,694 --> 02:26:28,737
Not his conquests or his triumphs.

1484
02:26:28,946 --> 02:26:31,573
Not his titles
or the roaring of the mob.

1485
02:26:32,241 --> 02:26:34,534
I envied him you.

1486
02:26:37,622 --> 02:26:41,041
When we first met in Rome,
I remembered you.

1487
02:26:41,334 --> 02:26:43,960
I wondered that I could
ever have forgotten.

1488
02:26:44,212 --> 02:26:46,087
Remembered me?

1489
02:26:46,339 --> 02:26:49,049
Years ago, when you were
a young cavalry officer...

1490
02:26:49,258 --> 02:26:53,094
stationed at the palace in
Alexandria under that fat Roman general.

1491
02:26:53,387 --> 02:26:56,056
- What was his name?
- Gabinius.

1492
02:26:56,224 --> 02:26:57,474
Gabinius.

1493
02:26:59,101 --> 02:27:02,979
I was 12 years old, and I loved you.

1494
02:27:03,231 --> 02:27:05,565
- Nonsense.
- It's true.

1495
02:27:05,775 --> 02:27:09,569
Lovers always want so much
never to have loved before.

1496
02:27:11,072 --> 02:27:12,447
It's possible, you know.

1497
02:27:12,657 --> 02:27:15,283
It becomes a game.
Who loved whom first?

1498
02:27:15,493 --> 02:27:17,077
I did.

1499
02:27:18,412 --> 02:27:22,958
If you noticed me at all then,
you were probably terrified of me.

1500
02:27:23,417 --> 02:27:27,087
With good reason. Everybody knows
Romans cut up little children...

1501
02:27:27,296 --> 02:27:29,589
and feed them to their horses.

1502
02:27:34,428 --> 02:27:37,180
We'll make this our beginning.

1503
02:27:37,431 --> 02:27:39,432
Beginning with tonight...

1504
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:42,143
you must never envy Caesar...

1505
02:27:42,395 --> 02:27:46,273
or anyone, anything again.

1506
02:27:55,283 --> 02:27:57,158
After all...

1507
02:27:57,451 --> 02:27:59,703
this is nothing new.

1508
02:27:59,954 --> 02:28:01,788
For so many years...

1509
02:28:01,998 --> 02:28:04,124
Antony has fed upon the crumbs...

1510
02:28:04,292 --> 02:28:07,794
that fell from
Julius Caesar's table.

1511
02:28:09,171 --> 02:28:10,964
I say...

1512
02:28:11,299 --> 02:28:13,800
they are deserving of each other.

1513
02:28:14,051 --> 02:28:16,011
Let him stay in Egypt.

1514
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:18,305
Let him fritter away
his life as he chooses...

1515
02:28:18,472 --> 02:28:22,142
but not the possessions
and the empire of the Roman people!

1516
02:28:22,435 --> 02:28:24,936
The Roman people!

1517
02:28:25,313 --> 02:28:28,857
The Roman people. What are
glory and possessions to them?

1518
02:28:29,066 --> 02:28:32,068
Is their Antony content?

1519
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:35,322
Then so are they.

1520
02:28:36,157 --> 02:28:39,075
Does their Antony sweep
their empire...

1521
02:28:39,327 --> 02:28:42,162
under Cleopatra's bed?

1522
02:28:42,538 --> 02:28:47,667
His adoring Romans sigh
and remain content.

1523
02:28:48,210 --> 02:28:51,671
Let him stay however distant
for however long...

1524
02:28:51,881 --> 02:28:54,007
with never a thought of them.

1525
02:28:54,216 --> 02:28:57,344
The Roman people hold him
close to their hearts.

1526
02:28:57,511 --> 02:28:59,346
Distant?

1527
02:28:59,597 --> 02:29:02,557
Perhaps from Rome
but not from Caesar, I think.

1528
02:29:02,767 --> 02:29:04,184
Nor from Caesar's son.

1529
02:29:04,393 --> 02:29:07,187
Germanicus, do you speak of me?

1530
02:29:07,396 --> 02:29:09,189
No, Octavian, I speak of Caesar.

1531
02:29:10,232 --> 02:29:12,275
I am Caesar.

1532
02:29:13,027 --> 02:29:15,195
Only while Antony remains...

1533
02:29:15,488 --> 02:29:17,489
distant from Rome.

1534
02:29:20,284 --> 02:29:22,077
Antony!

1535
02:29:22,286 --> 02:29:25,705
Stay not too long in Alexandria!

1536
02:29:28,542 --> 02:29:30,543
Germanicus...

1537
02:29:31,087 --> 02:29:34,047
stay not too long in Rome.

1538
02:29:55,069 --> 02:29:58,279
- How much of this is known to Antony?
- All of it and more.

1539
02:29:58,572 --> 02:30:02,951
I've written him regularly. Letters,
dispatches by personal messenger.

1540
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:05,161
And what has he answered?

1541
02:30:05,413 --> 02:30:09,124
He wrote he was no longer interested
in the matters I described.

1542
02:30:09,333 --> 02:30:11,418
That he would not return to Rome.

1543
02:30:11,585 --> 02:30:15,630
That he understood quite clearly
what was at stake, what he would lose.

1544
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:17,966
But that he would not leave you.

1545
02:30:38,070 --> 02:30:39,612
Let's try the goat.

1546
02:30:44,452 --> 02:30:47,996
Let's have that goat again.
There. Not too much.

1547
02:30:48,289 --> 02:30:49,581
There.

1548
02:30:51,333 --> 02:30:53,710
The milk of a cow...

1549
02:30:53,961 --> 02:30:57,839
of a goat and of an ass.
Which is best for softening the beard?

1550
02:30:58,591 --> 02:31:01,801
Is it true Octavian shaves
but once a week?

1551
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:06,389
Even then, he has merely to face
the wind and let the fuzz blow away.

1552
02:31:06,724 --> 02:31:10,185
You knew, didn't you,
Germanicus was here from Rome?

1553
02:31:10,478 --> 02:31:11,978
Yes.

1554
02:31:12,229 --> 02:31:15,982
Have you strong feelings about beards?
I had one. Bright red.

1555
02:31:16,192 --> 02:31:17,984
Why haven't you seen him?

1556
02:31:25,618 --> 02:31:27,911
When you go...

1557
02:31:28,537 --> 02:31:30,371
must it be for very long?

1558
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:34,209
I must take some of these with me.
They don't have them.

1559
02:31:34,418 --> 02:31:36,669
At least, they didn't
when I was last...

1560
02:31:37,171 --> 02:31:38,838
in Rome.

1561
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:50,433
While they were digging
the foundation of my tomb...

1562
02:31:50,684 --> 02:31:53,353
the workers found an old wall.

1563
02:31:53,562 --> 02:31:58,191
Someone had scratched on it
hundreds of years ago:

1564
02:31:58,526 --> 02:32:02,779
"You were not here last night,
and I could not sleep.

1565
02:32:03,197 --> 02:32:05,657
Will you be here tonight?"

1566
02:32:07,535 --> 02:32:10,912
Do you suppose they ever met again?

1567
02:32:12,248 --> 02:32:16,209
Everything that I shall ever want to hold
or look upon or have or be...

1568
02:32:16,377 --> 02:32:19,045
is here now with you.

1569
02:32:19,713 --> 02:32:22,173
I must not be sorry for myself.

1570
02:32:22,383 --> 02:32:26,928
Queens are sometimes no better at that
than kings, or even princes.

1571
02:32:29,431 --> 02:32:31,724
It doesn't seem fair.

1572
02:32:32,935 --> 02:32:38,064
What I feel I should have felt
long ago when I was very young.

1573
02:32:38,274 --> 02:32:41,734
When I could say to myself
that this was how love was...

1574
02:32:41,944 --> 02:32:44,195
and how it would be.

1575
02:32:44,405 --> 02:32:49,409
But to have waited so long,
to know so suddenly...

1576
02:32:49,577 --> 02:32:51,327
this late...

1577
02:32:51,579 --> 02:32:56,124
how it hurts.
How love can stab the heart.

1578
02:33:05,426 --> 02:33:08,428
Be careful with Octavian.

1579
02:33:08,721 --> 02:33:10,763
Let him be careful with me.

1580
02:33:10,973 --> 02:33:14,142
The Romans want no war
between the two of you.

1581
02:33:14,351 --> 02:33:16,978
In any case, you are not ready yet.

1582
02:33:17,229 --> 02:33:20,773
War? The world is filled with love.
There'll be no more wars.

1583
02:33:20,941 --> 02:33:22,984
You must have your share.

1584
02:33:23,235 --> 02:33:26,988
Your titles and powers
must be spelled out exactly.

1585
02:33:27,239 --> 02:33:30,950
There can be no question of your
complete authority in the East.

1586
02:33:33,746 --> 02:33:35,872
Antony, how will I live?

1587
02:33:36,832 --> 02:33:38,666
The same as I.

1588
02:33:39,793 --> 02:33:42,170
One breath upon the other.

1589
02:33:42,379 --> 02:33:44,130
Each bringing us...

1590
02:33:44,381 --> 02:33:47,800
one breath closer.

1591
02:33:47,968 --> 02:33:51,888
You take so much of me
with you so far.

1592
02:33:52,139 --> 02:33:54,974
Remember, remember.
They'll want you to forget.

1593
02:33:55,142 --> 02:33:58,770
- Please...
- Forget? How?

1594
02:33:59,647 --> 02:34:02,315
I can never be more
far away from you...

1595
02:34:03,651 --> 02:34:05,360
than this.

1596
02:34:16,830 --> 02:34:18,790
He will come first to Brindisium.

1597
02:34:18,999 --> 02:34:23,920
Agrippa and I plan to welcome
his arrival with a great ceremony.

1598
02:34:24,171 --> 02:34:28,675
Antony must see how dear to the hearts
of the Romans, of us all...

1599
02:34:28,842 --> 02:34:30,593
he is and has been.

1600
02:34:30,844 --> 02:34:34,305
He has been away for a very long time.

1601
02:34:34,515 --> 02:34:38,351
Perhaps we can persuade him
to stay with us even longer.

1602
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:42,939
Perhaps, Octavia, if you came
to Brindisium, you could help.

1603
02:34:43,190 --> 02:34:46,359
You may have forgotten.
It is only six months since...

1604
02:34:46,568 --> 02:34:49,696
Begging the pardon
of Agrippa and our ancestors...

1605
02:34:49,863 --> 02:34:53,366
I do not agree that a young widow
must retire from life.

1606
02:34:53,701 --> 02:34:56,953
You haven't left my house
since your husband died.

1607
02:34:57,204 --> 02:35:01,874
If only for the sake of your health,
the change alone...

1608
02:35:04,253 --> 02:35:08,339
Then, begging the pardon of
Lord Agrippa and our ancestors...

1609
02:35:08,549 --> 02:35:11,884
I would look forward
very much to the change.

1610
02:35:14,138 --> 02:35:18,558
Nothing, no one, could possibly
shine more brightly in the sun.

1611
02:35:18,851 --> 02:35:20,435
Not only Antony.

1612
02:35:20,644 --> 02:35:24,230
I know of no man who would not
hold out his greedy fists for Octavia.

1613
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:27,650
After all, what greater pledge
could I offer...

1614
02:35:27,901 --> 02:35:30,069
of my goodwill toward him?

1615
02:35:30,362 --> 02:35:33,906
And how could Antony better show
his love of peace and Rome...

1616
02:35:34,158 --> 02:35:35,742
than by accepting?

1617
02:35:35,909 --> 02:35:37,744
And Cleopatra?

1618
02:35:39,121 --> 02:35:42,415
Are you suggesting
we invite her to the wedding?

1619
02:35:42,624 --> 02:35:45,126
You remember when
Julius Caesar returned...

1620
02:35:45,419 --> 02:35:47,920
and those months
while she was in Rome?

1621
02:35:48,088 --> 02:35:51,132
There was a poison
in his heart, in his brain.

1622
02:35:51,383 --> 02:35:54,761
Yes, the falling sickness.
But more than that.

1623
02:35:54,970 --> 02:35:57,764
- Cleopatra.
- I remember well.

1624
02:35:58,015 --> 02:36:01,934
- Antony is no Caesar.
- I am grateful for that.

1625
02:36:02,603 --> 02:36:06,689
Granted that he marries Octavia,
will he forget Cleopatra?

1626
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:11,277
- Will she permit him to forget?
- Most probably not.

1627
02:36:57,366 --> 02:36:59,951
- Have I permission to speak?
- Tell me, quickly.

1628
02:37:00,786 --> 02:37:03,538
A galley came to Pelusium
with news from Rome.

1629
02:37:03,747 --> 02:37:06,624
Antony and Octavian
have sealed a great pact.

1630
02:37:06,834 --> 02:37:10,419
Antony has 10 more legions
and all of the East for his domain.

1631
02:37:10,629 --> 02:37:12,672
Egypt will be declared ally of Rome.

1632
02:37:12,881 --> 02:37:14,549
It is done.

1633
02:37:16,468 --> 02:37:19,512
- There is more.
- No. No more, my lord.

1634
02:37:19,721 --> 02:37:22,557
- He's afraid.
- Is there anything more?

1635
02:37:24,101 --> 02:37:27,937
Forgive me, Divine Majesty.
There has been a marriage.

1636
02:37:28,939 --> 02:37:30,648
A marriage of state.

1637
02:37:31,817 --> 02:37:34,986
Between Octavia,
the sister of Caesar...

1638
02:37:35,821 --> 02:37:37,530
and Lord Antony.

1639
02:37:42,578 --> 02:37:44,453
Anything more?

1640
02:37:44,997 --> 02:37:46,455
They're presently in Athens.

1641
02:37:46,665 --> 02:37:50,376
Sometime within the year,
Lady Octavia is to return to Rome.

1642
02:37:50,586 --> 02:37:55,006
Antony will come Alexandria to negotiate
the alliance of Rome and Egypt.

1643
02:38:09,771 --> 02:38:11,689
Leave me.

1644
02:38:15,027 --> 02:38:16,485
No.

1645
02:38:18,530 --> 02:38:20,865
Completely alone.

1646
02:38:54,816 --> 02:38:57,818
Antony!

1647
02:41:36,269 --> 02:41:38,145
Do you find it pleasing, my lord?

1648
02:41:40,899 --> 02:41:42,566
Oh, yes. Very.

1649
02:41:42,776 --> 02:41:44,819
It was made here in Athens.

1650
02:41:45,070 --> 02:41:48,239
Not as practical
as our Roman ones, of course.

1651
02:41:48,448 --> 02:41:51,492
The Greeks have such
a weakness for beauty.

1652
02:42:04,381 --> 02:42:07,174
Does the dinner
not please you, my lord?

1653
02:42:07,426 --> 02:42:09,760
Very much.
I'm not particularly hungry.

1654
02:42:10,011 --> 02:42:12,596
If anything would please you more...

1655
02:42:13,140 --> 02:42:15,099
Believe me, I am pleased.

1656
02:42:17,269 --> 02:42:20,896
The gods know you do
nothing but please me...

1657
02:42:21,106 --> 02:42:23,399
in every way.

1658
02:42:29,823 --> 02:42:31,490
Word from Domitius?

1659
02:42:31,741 --> 02:42:33,701
He never even reached the palace.

1660
02:42:33,910 --> 02:42:36,954
He was not permitted
through the city gate.

1661
02:42:41,668 --> 02:42:44,044
If I may be excused.

1662
02:42:44,796 --> 02:42:46,547
There's no need for you to go.

1663
02:42:46,798 --> 02:42:49,884
When I hear matters of state
discussed by men...

1664
02:42:50,093 --> 02:42:52,720
invariably I find myself
wondering about...

1665
02:42:52,929 --> 02:42:55,556
why the wine has gone sour.

1666
02:42:55,765 --> 02:42:57,600
Good night, Rufio.

1667
02:42:58,310 --> 02:43:00,102
Good night, my lord.

1668
02:43:08,403 --> 02:43:11,113
Domitius turned away at the gate.

1669
02:43:11,323 --> 02:43:13,491
That makes how many?

1670
02:43:13,742 --> 02:43:17,203
Five of your ambassadors
turned away within this year.

1671
02:43:17,454 --> 02:43:21,248
- If you'd gone when...
- It was the only favor I ever asked of you.

1672
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:22,833
You granted it.

1673
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:27,671
The treaty with Egypt must be made.
We've received no wheat, no gold...

1674
02:43:27,881 --> 02:43:30,633
I cannot go to her
to negotiate a treaty!

1675
02:43:30,884 --> 02:43:33,052
She'll have no one else.

1676
02:43:33,970 --> 02:43:35,888
And what if she should...

1677
02:43:36,139 --> 02:43:37,598
turn me away?

1678
02:43:39,267 --> 02:43:41,227
That would be quite impossible.

1679
02:43:44,940 --> 02:43:46,732
Have you ever really left her?

1680
02:43:49,402 --> 02:43:50,986
No.

1681
02:44:05,877 --> 02:44:08,796
Three days I've waited
for an audience with you alone.

1682
02:44:09,047 --> 02:44:10,589
What is the purpose?

1683
02:44:10,799 --> 02:44:12,883
Get out, all of you.
I'll see her privately.

1684
02:44:13,134 --> 02:44:15,803
- You're before the throne of Egypt.
- I know where I am!

1685
02:44:16,012 --> 02:44:17,471
State your purpose!

1686
02:44:17,681 --> 02:44:19,807
Matters I won't discuss publicly.

1687
02:44:20,058 --> 02:44:24,228
I do not grant private audiences
to unidentified persons.

1688
02:44:26,106 --> 02:44:28,732
I am Marcus Antonius.

1689
02:44:28,942 --> 02:44:32,903
I know who you are.
What are you, at the moment?

1690
02:44:33,113 --> 02:44:37,950
Envoy of Rome, proconsul of all
the Roman Empire to the east of Italy.

1691
02:44:38,201 --> 02:44:39,868
An impressive title.

1692
02:44:40,078 --> 02:44:42,454
Worthy, perhaps,
of a private audience?

1693
02:44:42,664 --> 02:44:44,999
Without a treaty of alliance
with Egypt...

1694
02:44:45,208 --> 02:44:49,920
you could not hold the territories
under your command. True?

1695
02:44:50,505 --> 02:44:51,755
Possibly.

1696
02:44:52,007 --> 02:44:55,426
Then, Lord Antony, you come before me
as a suppliant.

1697
02:44:55,677 --> 02:44:58,512
- If you choose to regard me as such.
- I do.

1698
02:44:59,431 --> 02:45:04,184
You will therefore assume the position
of a suppliant before this throne.

1699
02:45:04,436 --> 02:45:06,020
You will kneel.

1700
02:45:07,939 --> 02:45:12,192
- I will what?
- On your knees.

1701
02:45:13,403 --> 02:45:16,697
You dare ask the proconsul
of the Roman Empire...

1702
02:45:16,906 --> 02:45:19,241
I asked it of Julius Caesar.

1703
02:45:19,492 --> 02:45:22,536
I demand it of you!

1704
02:45:33,798 --> 02:45:35,049
Now...

1705
02:45:35,425 --> 02:45:38,427
you may have the treaty
you asked for...

1706
02:45:38,678 --> 02:45:40,804
on the following conditions:

1707
02:45:41,056 --> 02:45:43,891
By your authority
as proconsul of Rome...

1708
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:47,728
you will cede to Egypt immediately
the following territories:

1709
02:45:47,937 --> 02:45:52,232
Judea, Jordan, Armenia, Phoenicia,
the provinces of Sinai and Arabia...

1710
02:45:52,484 --> 02:45:55,778
the islands of Cyprus and Crete.

1711
02:45:57,864 --> 02:46:00,616
You ask for one-third
of the Roman Empire!

1712
02:46:00,992 --> 02:46:02,785
Put it another way.

1713
02:46:03,036 --> 02:46:05,829
I give to you two-thirds.

1714
02:46:08,041 --> 02:46:09,667
Most generous.

1715
02:46:09,876 --> 02:46:11,877
I cannot accept.

1716
02:46:12,462 --> 02:46:15,506
I suggest you deliberate further.

1717
02:46:15,757 --> 02:46:20,177
Perhaps consult with your superior
in Rome.

1718
02:46:20,387 --> 02:46:21,637
My superior?

1719
02:46:21,846 --> 02:46:23,847
Octavian.

1720
02:46:24,057 --> 02:46:26,100
Caesar Octavian?

1721
02:46:33,066 --> 02:46:35,067
You have not been dismissed!

1722
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:42,282
You are now dismissed.

1723
02:47:33,835 --> 02:47:38,297
Outside, all of you. Her Majesty
and I will speak in private.

1724
02:47:38,673 --> 02:47:41,800
Out! Before I chop you up
and feed you to my horses.

1725
02:47:42,302 --> 02:47:45,053
That's how Romans
frighten little girls.

1726
02:47:45,305 --> 02:47:48,724
They like to frighten little girls.
Wait outside.

1727
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:02,905
I married Octavia
at her brother's insistence...

1728
02:48:03,114 --> 02:48:06,116
as a gesture of faith, of peace.
A bargain sealed.

1729
02:48:06,367 --> 02:48:10,662
With a kiss? Or did you simply
shake hands on your wedding night?

1730
02:48:10,872 --> 02:48:15,250
Rome was celebrating the marriage even
before I arrived. How could I refuse?

1731
02:48:15,502 --> 02:48:17,211
By saying no.

1732
02:48:17,420 --> 02:48:20,130
As you have said no to all my demands.

1733
02:48:20,340 --> 02:48:24,051
They're unreasonable! The kind
laid down for a helpless enemy!

1734
02:48:24,302 --> 02:48:26,428
You're not helpless... yet.

1735
02:48:26,638 --> 02:48:31,517
I can't cede the territories. It would
lead to a break between Rome and me.

1736
02:48:32,310 --> 02:48:34,311
Why do you think
I asked for them?

1737
02:48:34,521 --> 02:48:37,397
It would be playing into
Octavian's hands, what he hopes for.

1738
02:48:37,649 --> 02:48:39,191
It would not be wise!

1739
02:48:39,442 --> 02:48:41,276
What is wise?

1740
02:48:41,486 --> 02:48:44,822
To hand over Rome, Italy,
the world to Octavian?

1741
02:48:45,073 --> 02:48:47,866
To grovel publicly
before his authority?

1742
02:48:48,117 --> 02:48:50,994
Take his sister to wed and to bed.

1743
02:48:51,204 --> 02:48:52,996
As if to beg forgiveness...

1744
02:48:53,206 --> 02:48:57,543
for having stayed so long
with your Egyptian harlot.

1745
02:49:03,049 --> 02:49:06,093
What has angered you?
That I dealt with Octavian how I could...

1746
02:49:06,344 --> 02:49:09,763
or that I married his sister to do it?
Jealousy or politics? Which?

1747
02:49:10,014 --> 02:49:13,475
Both! And damn you for not
understanding either.

1748
02:49:13,726 --> 02:49:15,727
I wouldn't look to you
for instruction.

1749
02:49:15,937 --> 02:49:19,398
Which is why you have come back
chained to Octavian like a slave.

1750
02:49:19,607 --> 02:49:23,068
- Slave!
- And with such exquisite chains.

1751
02:49:23,319 --> 02:49:26,947
So softly spoken, so virtuous.

1752
02:49:27,156 --> 02:49:31,118
She sleeps, I hear, fully clothed.

1753
02:49:33,746 --> 02:49:36,331
I come back.
That's all that should concern you.

1754
02:49:36,583 --> 02:49:37,624
Should it?

1755
02:49:37,834 --> 02:49:42,963
How long before your master snaps his
finger and you run back to him, or her?

1756
02:49:45,925 --> 02:49:48,010
I have only one master.

1757
02:49:48,595 --> 02:49:50,637
My love for you.

1758
02:49:50,889 --> 02:49:52,598
No.

1759
02:49:52,849 --> 02:49:55,517
Your master must not be love.

1760
02:49:55,977 --> 02:49:58,478
Never love.

1761
02:49:58,688 --> 02:50:02,399
Give yourself to love and you
give yourself to forgetfulness...

1762
02:50:02,609 --> 02:50:06,486
of what you are and who you are
and what you want.

1763
02:50:06,696 --> 02:50:09,948
And what you want
is worth so much more?

1764
02:50:10,909 --> 02:50:13,702
I will not have love as my master.

1765
02:50:13,953 --> 02:50:17,122
- Then you will not have love.
- Nor will I have Octavian.

1766
02:50:19,125 --> 02:50:22,961
- Never fear.
- How confident you are.

1767
02:50:23,171 --> 02:50:25,547
And has Octavian a master?

1768
02:50:25,757 --> 02:50:29,217
His ambition: to rule the Roman world
as emperor and god.

1769
02:50:29,469 --> 02:50:32,137
The Roman world, to begin with.

1770
02:50:32,388 --> 02:50:34,932
And what stands in his way?

1771
02:50:35,433 --> 02:50:38,268
- You and I.
- And my son!

1772
02:50:38,519 --> 02:50:42,314
The rightful heir to the name
and glory of great Caesar.

1773
02:50:42,523 --> 02:50:47,653
Octavian has already stolen those
and he will now destroy...

1774
02:50:47,946 --> 02:50:50,781
in the name of his sister,
the love Rome has for you.

1775
02:50:51,032 --> 02:50:53,367
And by your marriage to her...

1776
02:50:53,618 --> 02:50:57,579
he has made of me, unmistakably,
your whore.

1777
02:50:57,830 --> 02:51:00,874
Never fear Octavian?

1778
02:51:01,167 --> 02:51:06,296
It is he, now, who I think
must be unafraid.

1779
02:51:10,385 --> 02:51:12,719
Show me a city
and I'll tell you how to take it.

1780
02:51:12,971 --> 02:51:16,223
I'll find an army's weak points
and hit them hard where they are.

1781
02:51:16,557 --> 02:51:20,560
But make me to sit down and talk
in whispers of this and that...

1782
02:51:20,770 --> 02:51:25,607
with an emphasis here and a shrug there,
and I'm soon confounded and defeated.

1783
02:51:26,985 --> 02:51:29,569
Meaning to do the best...

1784
02:51:30,071 --> 02:51:32,948
I suppose I could not
have done worse.

1785
02:51:37,954 --> 02:51:40,205
There is still time.

1786
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:44,251
Let someone ask me what I want:

1787
02:51:44,502 --> 02:51:47,713
To live with you in peace and love.

1788
02:51:48,089 --> 02:51:50,007
Do you have...

1789
02:51:50,258 --> 02:51:53,135
conditions for total surrender?

1790
02:51:53,386 --> 02:51:56,054
First, as did Caesar...

1791
02:51:56,347 --> 02:51:59,808
you will marry me
according to Egyptian ritual.

1792
02:52:00,143 --> 02:52:02,394
That's not a condition,
that's a reward.

1793
02:52:02,645 --> 02:52:05,022
You'll declare, by your authority...

1794
02:52:05,231 --> 02:52:07,607
Caesarion to be king of Egypt...

1795
02:52:07,859 --> 02:52:10,569
and we will rule together
in his name.

1796
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:12,738
Happily granted.

1797
02:52:12,989 --> 02:52:17,743
You will cede to Egypt
all the territories I have demanded.

1798
02:52:20,371 --> 02:52:22,247
You must.

1799
02:52:22,498 --> 02:52:26,001
If only to assert
your own authority and power.

1800
02:52:26,252 --> 02:52:30,255
Otherwise, inevitably,
in time we will lose everything.

1801
02:52:30,631 --> 02:52:32,966
Can't you see that?

1802
02:52:34,677 --> 02:52:36,720
I can see nothing...

1803
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:38,805
but you.

1804
02:52:44,979 --> 02:52:47,564
I am no longer content
to forgive Antony!

1805
02:52:47,774 --> 02:52:50,859
To marry this Egyptian
according to their barbaric rites!

1806
02:52:51,069 --> 02:52:54,029
Meaningless under Roman law!
Great Caesar himself...

1807
02:52:54,238 --> 02:52:57,991
Yes. Bit by bit,
Antony crawls behind his memory.

1808
02:52:58,201 --> 02:52:59,910
But tell us this, Germanicus:

1809
02:53:00,119 --> 02:53:03,914
Did great Caesar also toss one-third
of the Roman Empire...

1810
02:53:04,165 --> 02:53:07,542
into Cleopatra's
undoubtedly deserving lap?

1811
02:53:07,794 --> 02:53:11,713
The territories in dispute
were subjugated by Julius Caesar.

1812
02:53:11,923 --> 02:53:15,967
The right to rule over them
is the heritage of his son.

1813
02:53:16,219 --> 02:53:20,305
And in the name of the mighty Caesar
I grant to King Ptolemy Caesarion...

1814
02:53:20,556 --> 02:53:22,349
that right.

1815
02:53:24,310 --> 02:53:28,188
Let it be known the greatness of Rome
lies not in what she takes...

1816
02:53:28,439 --> 02:53:30,482
but in what she gives.

1817
02:53:34,654 --> 02:53:38,448
"Rome's greatness lies
in what she gives," he says.

1818
02:53:38,699 --> 02:53:41,576
Then calmly gives what is not his.

1819
02:53:41,786 --> 02:53:44,788
And Cleopatra takes...

1820
02:53:45,039 --> 02:53:46,706
and will take more.

1821
02:53:46,916 --> 02:53:49,251
And war will come.

1822
02:53:49,961 --> 02:53:52,254
She knows and I know...

1823
02:53:52,505 --> 02:53:54,714
that war will come.

1824
02:53:55,091 --> 02:53:57,425
But I will not speak for it...

1825
02:53:57,635 --> 02:54:00,929
nor will I speak against Antony.

1826
02:54:02,265 --> 02:54:05,100
I must be forced into war.

1827
02:54:05,351 --> 02:54:08,728
The people of Rome
must force this war upon me.

1828
02:54:08,938 --> 02:54:13,525
They must storm the doors
of the Senate, crying for it.

1829
02:54:13,776 --> 02:54:17,404
If we move quickly, the Romans won't know
we've crossed the Mediterranean...

1830
02:54:17,655 --> 02:54:19,239
until we land in Greece.

1831
02:54:19,448 --> 02:54:22,284
You and General Rufio will start
embarking the troops at once.

1832
02:54:22,493 --> 02:54:24,286
Yes, Your Majesty.

1833
02:54:25,788 --> 02:54:28,456
If it is decided
to move our armies into Greece.

1834
02:54:28,666 --> 02:54:30,458
It has been decided.

1835
02:54:30,668 --> 02:54:32,419
My men do not...

1836
02:54:32,628 --> 02:54:33,879
travel well by sea.

1837
02:54:34,088 --> 02:54:36,798
They fight on land.
They move on land.

1838
02:54:37,008 --> 02:54:39,801
Your men will do
as they are told, as mine will.

1839
02:54:40,011 --> 02:54:43,680
My men will do as they're told by me.
They have not yet become...

1840
02:54:46,893 --> 02:54:48,894
They are still Roman.

1841
02:54:50,104 --> 02:54:52,063
However...

1842
02:54:52,315 --> 02:54:54,733
since I do as I'm told...

1843
02:54:55,568 --> 02:54:58,737
The final decision will,
of course, be Lord Antony's.

1844
02:54:58,946 --> 02:55:02,741
And I'm sure that in time
he will make it.

1845
02:55:02,992 --> 02:55:04,409
That is all.

1846
02:55:11,751 --> 02:55:16,838
It would be wiser not to disagree
in the presence of our officers.

1847
02:55:17,048 --> 02:55:19,132
Your officers.

1848
02:55:19,508 --> 02:55:22,552
What final decision
have you decided I am to make?

1849
02:55:22,803 --> 02:55:26,056
Why do you oppose transporting
our armies to Greece?

1850
02:55:26,265 --> 02:55:28,725
Because I do not want war
against Rome.

1851
02:55:28,935 --> 02:55:32,103
One hundred thousand men
led by Marc Antony.

1852
02:55:32,313 --> 02:55:35,106
Octavian is no fool. He won't fight.

1853
02:55:35,358 --> 02:55:38,526
He'll have to, instantly,
on the spot where they land.

1854
02:55:38,778 --> 02:55:41,738
Rome will not declare war against you.

1855
02:55:42,031 --> 02:55:43,698
I do not agree.

1856
02:55:44,825 --> 02:55:47,035
I have not asked for your opinion.

1857
02:55:47,411 --> 02:55:48,828
Not for some time.

1858
02:55:49,080 --> 02:55:52,791
Not since I doubted the necessity
of building 300 ships.

1859
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:56,419
The way to prevent war
is to be ready for it.

1860
02:55:56,629 --> 02:56:00,257
Have 300 warships ever been
built for war without war?

1861
02:56:00,508 --> 02:56:03,802
We shall have what we want
without it.

1862
02:56:04,011 --> 02:56:06,680
Your Majesty, please hear me.

1863
02:56:06,931 --> 02:56:10,225
I think we are very near the edge.

1864
02:56:10,434 --> 02:56:12,936
Strings are being pulled,
and not by us.

1865
02:56:13,771 --> 02:56:17,023
We are being managed and maneuvered
without our choosing.

1866
02:56:17,275 --> 02:56:20,277
The deputation sent on behalf
of Lady Octavia...

1867
02:56:20,528 --> 02:56:23,863
chosen from the most
highly revered men of Rome.

1868
02:56:24,115 --> 02:56:29,202
Why? They can take back to their
people nothing but Lord Antony's...

1869
02:56:29,537 --> 02:56:34,207
forgive me, insulting and
unnecessary divorce of her...

1870
02:56:34,417 --> 02:56:36,668
and his rejection of them.

1871
02:56:38,671 --> 02:56:42,841
It was done at my bidding.
The responsibility is mine.

1872
02:56:45,136 --> 02:56:46,678
The doing was mine.

1873
02:56:50,057 --> 02:56:51,308
What do you propose?

1874
02:56:51,517 --> 02:56:55,562
Let me go to Rome and approach
Octavian, possibly the Roman people...

1875
02:56:55,813 --> 02:56:58,565
and assure them that we want peace.

1876
02:57:00,901 --> 02:57:02,569
Go then.

1877
02:57:03,070 --> 02:57:04,487
Go to Rome.

1878
02:57:17,376 --> 02:57:19,461
Sosigenes!

1879
02:57:21,756 --> 02:57:23,631
Take care.

1880
02:57:28,471 --> 02:57:30,096
He's very dear to you,
that old man.

1881
02:57:30,306 --> 02:57:33,099
Your concern and worry
are written all over you.

1882
02:57:33,309 --> 02:57:36,895
Forgive me, but it's a kind of love
that you're showing.

1883
02:57:37,104 --> 02:57:40,732
Let them talk. Let them
negotiate all they want.

1884
02:57:40,941 --> 02:57:44,361
Time is on our side.
We can only grow stronger.

1885
02:57:59,210 --> 02:58:02,087
These walls must not
believe their ears...

1886
02:58:02,296 --> 02:58:05,757
to hear such silence...

1887
02:58:06,675 --> 02:58:08,885
from the right...

1888
02:58:09,970 --> 02:58:12,430
from the left.

1889
02:58:12,681 --> 02:58:15,934
The call of the Roman people
can be clearly heard...

1890
02:58:16,143 --> 02:58:18,603
yet the Roman Senate...

1891
02:58:18,813 --> 02:58:21,606
has no answer.

1892
02:58:22,441 --> 02:58:26,403
Shall we then just sit...

1893
02:58:26,695 --> 02:58:28,696
and listen?

1894
02:58:29,698 --> 02:58:34,577
There is not one of us that would not
willingly make war upon Cleopatra.

1895
02:58:35,538 --> 02:58:37,038
But how...

1896
02:58:37,248 --> 02:58:39,874
without also making war
upon Marc Antony...

1897
02:58:40,084 --> 02:58:42,961
loved by Rome and loving Rome?

1898
02:58:43,170 --> 02:58:47,048
"Loved by Rome and loving Rome."

1899
02:58:48,134 --> 02:58:52,053
I have here the last will
and testament...

1900
02:58:52,263 --> 02:58:55,598
of Antony, who so loves Rome.

1901
02:58:58,644 --> 02:59:00,562
Read for yourselves...

1902
02:59:00,771 --> 02:59:04,482
how dearly Antony loves you,
loves Rome...

1903
02:59:04,692 --> 02:59:08,903
in this, his last will
under his seal.

1904
02:59:10,948 --> 02:59:13,241
Only lately brought from Egypt...

1905
02:59:13,451 --> 02:59:17,495
and deposited in our holy temple
at Antony's request...

1906
02:59:17,705 --> 02:59:20,081
by the distinguished Sosigenes.

1907
02:59:20,291 --> 02:59:23,668
An extraordinary mission
for an extraordinary man.

1908
02:59:23,878 --> 02:59:28,131
So wise, so close to Cleopatra,
so trusted by her.

1909
02:59:29,008 --> 02:59:31,718
Read in Antony's will...

1910
02:59:31,927 --> 02:59:33,761
at the end.

1911
02:59:33,971 --> 02:59:38,308
Commit to memory the last request
of your beloved Antony.

1912
02:59:38,517 --> 02:59:42,353
It bears witness to his love for Rome.

1913
02:59:48,611 --> 02:59:52,864
When he is dead, it says...

1914
02:59:53,073 --> 02:59:56,618
when Marc Antony has died...

1915
02:59:56,827 --> 03:00:00,163
it is his wish to be buried...

1916
03:00:00,372 --> 03:00:04,417
in his beloved Alexandria!

1917
03:00:05,794 --> 03:00:07,337
In Egypt!

1918
03:00:07,546 --> 03:00:09,881
Among Egyptians.

1919
03:00:10,132 --> 03:00:13,468
Beside his Egyptian whore!

1920
03:00:16,555 --> 03:00:19,224
Is what I say the truth?

1921
03:00:19,433 --> 03:00:22,602
Do I speak the truth?

1922
03:00:30,277 --> 03:00:32,028
- War!
- War!

1923
03:00:32,196 --> 03:00:35,406
War! War! War!

1924
03:01:10,943 --> 03:01:15,071
I hold before you
the Golden Spear of War.

1925
03:01:15,364 --> 03:01:18,241
Placed into my hands
without dissent...

1926
03:01:18,492 --> 03:01:22,078
by the command and will
of the Senate of Rome.

1927
03:01:22,288 --> 03:01:27,417
And now it is you,
the people of Rome, who must direct me.

1928
03:01:27,626 --> 03:01:30,044
Where is the enemy?

1929
03:01:30,254 --> 03:01:33,548
Where is Egypt? Show me the way!

1930
03:01:41,807 --> 03:01:45,018
No!

1931
03:01:46,228 --> 03:01:47,979
There!

1932
03:01:48,230 --> 03:01:50,356
There is Egypt.

1933
03:02:08,917 --> 03:02:12,879
And so once more,
the Romans warred upon each other.

1934
03:02:13,088 --> 03:02:15,465
And just as Antony had foretold...

1935
03:02:15,716 --> 03:02:18,384
the forces of Octavian
came to meet them...

1936
03:02:18,594 --> 03:02:20,928
on the spot where they landed...

1937
03:02:21,138 --> 03:02:24,974
which was at Actium, in Greece.

1938
03:02:25,809 --> 03:02:27,977
Action begins
with the rise of the sun.

1939
03:02:28,228 --> 03:02:31,230
Your plan is brave and simple.
It's possible on land...

1940
03:02:31,482 --> 03:02:33,983
but we debate
its wisdom upon the sea.

1941
03:02:34,193 --> 03:02:38,112
I have an enemy on land with fewer
troops, on sea with fewer ships.

1942
03:02:38,322 --> 03:02:40,448
Let him debate the wisdom
of his position.

1943
03:02:40,658 --> 03:02:45,036
I have a happy choice. To destroy him
wet or dry. I have chosen wet.

1944
03:02:47,956 --> 03:02:52,460
I think it best, Euphranor, you report
to Cleopatra aboard her vessel in the harbor.

1945
03:02:52,670 --> 03:02:54,587
There you may point out to her...

1946
03:02:54,797 --> 03:02:59,175
the reasons why my brave simplicity
has failed.

1947
03:02:59,385 --> 03:03:02,679
In any case, you are relieved
of your battle command.

1948
03:03:14,024 --> 03:03:17,985
This final commitment of yourself,
your ships, of all of us...

1949
03:03:18,237 --> 03:03:20,655
to fight at sea,
when did you decide?

1950
03:03:21,865 --> 03:03:24,951
- Forgive me. I had...
- We've worked hard for many months.

1951
03:03:25,202 --> 03:03:29,330
We've trained an army
of 200,000 men from 20 countries.

1952
03:03:29,581 --> 03:03:32,959
- They won't be wasted...
- Of which, tonight, 20,000 of them...

1953
03:03:33,210 --> 03:03:37,755
will be herded onto those ships and
dragged out to sea, puking and afraid.

1954
03:03:37,965 --> 03:03:41,801
- Why, my lord? Why?
- Because I have decided it will be so!

1955
03:03:42,928 --> 03:03:44,303
I consider it an honor...

1956
03:03:44,513 --> 03:03:48,391
to fight beside Lord Antony
at any time, anywhere.

1957
03:03:49,184 --> 03:03:51,144
Spoken like a Roman, Ramos.

1958
03:03:53,105 --> 03:03:56,566
And you shall fight at my side,
in Rufio's place.

1959
03:03:57,818 --> 03:04:01,112
Rufio, you will remain with
Her Majesty aboard her vessel.

1960
03:04:02,698 --> 03:04:03,948
As you command.

1961
03:04:04,241 --> 03:04:06,951
Canidius, you will remain
with the land forces...

1962
03:04:07,202 --> 03:04:09,579
cheering from the hilltop,
if you like.

1963
03:04:11,123 --> 03:04:14,125
- As you command.
- Exactly.

1964
03:04:14,334 --> 03:04:16,961
As I command.

1965
03:04:19,465 --> 03:04:21,340
You're all dismissed.

1966
03:04:39,860 --> 03:04:40,943
Antony.

1967
03:04:44,490 --> 03:04:46,199
What has happened?

1968
03:04:46,658 --> 03:04:48,242
To me?

1969
03:04:49,411 --> 03:04:51,579
You have happened to me.

1970
03:05:36,124 --> 03:05:38,167
Do the lookouts have
Octavian's insignia?

1971
03:05:38,377 --> 03:05:42,880
- A golden eagle. Sighted at sunrise.
- By sunset we'll have those gold feathers.

1972
03:05:45,551 --> 03:05:47,593
Let Octavian know we're coming!

1973
03:05:48,345 --> 03:05:53,099
Let the enemy hear the voice
of Antony's legions!

1974
03:06:17,332 --> 03:06:19,834
He's on his way.
Signal my lord Caesar's ship.

1975
03:06:20,085 --> 03:06:21,794
Does it fly his insignia?

1976
03:06:22,045 --> 03:06:25,006
My orders are to be followed
exactly as issued.

1977
03:06:29,845 --> 03:06:34,181
And may the gods grant that Antony
has not changed his plan of battle.

1978
03:06:41,148 --> 03:06:42,899
There he goes...

1979
03:06:43,108 --> 03:06:46,903
as he's done 100 times on land.
Straight for the center.

1980
03:06:47,237 --> 03:06:51,073
If only it were on land, and we
were there to protect his flanks.

1981
03:06:51,283 --> 03:06:52,533
But we're not.

1982
03:06:57,497 --> 03:06:59,624
This and all dispositions are
to be signaled...

1983
03:06:59,791 --> 03:07:02,001
to Admiral Euphranor
aboard Cleopatra's barge.

1984
03:07:02,252 --> 03:07:04,045
But Euphranor's in command of...

1985
03:07:04,296 --> 03:07:07,965
In command of moving toy ships
on a painted ocean...

1986
03:07:09,176 --> 03:07:13,220
so that Egypt's queen can more
clearly follow her war upon water...

1987
03:07:13,430 --> 03:07:17,350
to which she has committed
Marc Antony and 20,000 Romans.

1988
03:07:27,402 --> 03:07:29,028
Just as he said he would.

1989
03:07:29,279 --> 03:07:32,698
Antony and his escorts,
by themselves, are after Octavian.

1990
03:07:32,950 --> 03:07:35,993
- He's already broken through their center.
- They let him through.

1991
03:07:36,244 --> 03:07:38,079
They Roman line will close behind him.

1992
03:07:38,246 --> 03:07:39,997
Not if we engage, as Antony said.

1993
03:07:40,248 --> 03:07:45,086
They won't engage. Agrippa will pull
them back and back, behind Antony...

1994
03:07:45,337 --> 03:07:47,254
as Antony chases Octavian.

1995
03:07:50,050 --> 03:07:51,342
What report?

1996
03:07:51,551 --> 03:07:55,721
Lord Antony is already through
the center of the Roman line.

1997
03:07:58,016 --> 03:08:03,020
He is now deep within the Roman fleet,
in pursuit of Octavian.

1998
03:08:14,616 --> 03:08:16,993
Faster! Faster!

1999
03:08:28,547 --> 03:08:32,174
They've increased their own speed.
We're too heavy to catch them.

2000
03:08:32,384 --> 03:08:34,927
Then we'll slow them down.

2001
03:08:35,137 --> 03:08:38,139
Start the ballistas.
Javelin throwers.

2002
03:08:38,348 --> 03:08:41,392
Aim high.
Overshoot rather than under.

2003
03:08:45,564 --> 03:08:47,648
Ballistas. Javelins.

2004
03:08:52,487 --> 03:08:55,156
Ballistas!

2005
03:09:05,834 --> 03:09:09,754
Octavian's ships are so much faster
than our Egyptian tubs.

2006
03:09:10,005 --> 03:09:13,299
Why doesn't Agrippa keep him away
from Antony's ballistas?

2007
03:09:28,440 --> 03:09:29,774
Ballistas!

2008
03:09:49,377 --> 03:09:51,377
Ballista!

2009
03:10:02,808 --> 03:10:05,059
My lord! My lord!

2010
03:10:05,310 --> 03:10:08,479
A direct hit on the enemy!
A bank of oars has been destroyed!

2011
03:10:12,109 --> 03:10:14,693
He's coming around broadside.

2012
03:10:14,945 --> 03:10:16,278
We've got him!

2013
03:10:16,488 --> 03:10:20,241
Collision course.
We'll ram him, board and destroy him.

2014
03:11:16,006 --> 03:11:17,715
Octavian!

2015
03:11:20,552 --> 03:11:24,013
Octavian!
Now is your time to be a Caesar!

2016
03:11:49,748 --> 03:11:53,876
- Where is he hiding?
- My Lord Octavian is not on board.

2017
03:11:57,505 --> 03:11:59,715
And now we close the trap.

2018
03:11:59,925 --> 03:12:03,302
Now we hit my Lord Antony
with everything we have.

2019
03:12:25,575 --> 03:12:27,493
No word of Lord Antony?

2020
03:12:27,744 --> 03:12:31,247
By now he must have Octavian.
You said he rammed Octavian's ship.

2021
03:12:31,456 --> 03:12:35,334
It may be Lord Antony rammed a ship
flying Octavian's insignia.

2022
03:12:35,543 --> 03:12:38,754
But if it is Octavian's ship,
if Octavian is on board...

2023
03:12:38,964 --> 03:12:43,550
If he finds and kills Octavian, he's
still surrounded by the Roman fleet.

2024
03:12:43,802 --> 03:12:46,470
- Then send him help.
- I've none to send.

2025
03:12:50,308 --> 03:12:52,685
They're pulling our ships apart now.

2026
03:12:52,936 --> 03:12:55,187
They've got Antony
alone and cut off...

2027
03:12:55,438 --> 03:12:59,525
closing in on him
like a pack of dogs on a wounded bear.

2028
03:14:21,066 --> 03:14:23,901
- Lord Antony's ship?
- Gone.

2029
03:14:25,653 --> 03:14:28,947
- And Octavian's ship?
- Burning, helpless.

2030
03:14:37,874 --> 03:14:40,084
Would you say, admiral...

2031
03:14:41,628 --> 03:14:44,046
that Lord Antony is dead?

2032
03:14:56,017 --> 03:14:57,851
How is the wind for Egypt?

2033
03:14:58,269 --> 03:14:59,812
Fair.

2034
03:15:04,609 --> 03:15:05,984
We'll sail at once.

2035
03:15:15,203 --> 03:15:19,498
Man the oar banks. Hoist anchor.
We sail for Egypt!

2036
03:15:51,948 --> 03:15:53,824
My Lord Canidius!

2037
03:16:08,840 --> 03:16:13,093
Remember always,
that after the battle of Actium...

2038
03:16:13,303 --> 03:16:18,056
with Octavian dead
and Antony dead...

2039
03:16:18,266 --> 03:16:20,309
you saw the victor...

2040
03:16:20,518 --> 03:16:23,854
sail away on her golden barge.

2041
03:16:32,989 --> 03:16:34,698
She's going.

2042
03:16:35,533 --> 03:16:36,783
Cleopatra's going!

2043
03:16:41,956 --> 03:16:43,332
Leaving me!

2044
03:16:43,666 --> 03:16:45,209
My lord.

2045
03:16:45,460 --> 03:16:48,879
My lord, our casualties are heavy.
We have little armor left.

2046
03:16:49,088 --> 03:16:52,007
Our men need regrouping,
someone to give them courage.

2047
03:16:52,217 --> 03:16:55,677
The dying are calling for you.
The living need your help.

2048
03:16:55,929 --> 03:16:57,846
You can't leave them.

2049
03:16:58,264 --> 03:17:00,557
Listen to me!

2050
03:17:31,297 --> 03:17:32,897
Help!

2051
03:17:56,531 --> 03:17:58,115
Caesar, news!

2052
03:17:58,366 --> 03:18:01,952
Great news! Cleopatra is leaving
the battle. Antony is following her.

2053
03:18:02,161 --> 03:18:04,580
We have won a great victory.

2054
03:18:14,549 --> 03:18:18,051
Weigh oars!

2055
03:19:48,893 --> 03:19:52,813
Her Majesty is most anxious
to see you. Will you come below?

2056
03:19:55,400 --> 03:19:58,068
Perhaps if you wish to remain here,
she will come to you.

2057
03:20:00,530 --> 03:20:03,448
Shall I send you food? Wine?

2058
03:20:09,080 --> 03:20:11,415
Her Majesty's orders.

2059
03:20:11,749 --> 03:20:13,667
She's afraid you might...

2060
03:20:13,918 --> 03:20:15,961
harm yourself.

2061
03:21:59,607 --> 03:22:01,274
Please.

2062
03:22:03,861 --> 03:22:08,573
Octavian has crossed
from Syria into Egypt.

2063
03:22:09,075 --> 03:22:11,326
He can be here in a matter of weeks.

2064
03:22:11,702 --> 03:22:14,621
There are two full legions
here in Alexandria...

2065
03:22:14,872 --> 03:22:16,957
who have remained loyal to you.

2066
03:22:17,834 --> 03:22:20,585
They and their officers...

2067
03:22:20,795 --> 03:22:23,713
are waiting for you
to command them.

2068
03:22:24,882 --> 03:22:29,010
If not to me, won't you speak
to Rufio at least...

2069
03:22:29,220 --> 03:22:32,764
or to anyone you choose?

2070
03:22:33,391 --> 03:22:37,686
Antony, just say what you want done
and it will be.

2071
03:22:40,773 --> 03:22:44,901
It's been so long since you've
looked at me. Don't turn away...

2072
03:22:45,152 --> 03:22:47,654
even like this...

2073
03:22:47,905 --> 03:22:50,907
with your eyes filled with hate.

2074
03:22:51,617 --> 03:22:54,035
How they burn with hate.

2075
03:22:57,081 --> 03:22:59,124
Why, Antony? Why?

2076
03:23:00,084 --> 03:23:02,085
Because I ran away?

2077
03:23:02,295 --> 03:23:05,088
They told me you were dead!

2078
03:23:08,301 --> 03:23:09,551
What...

2079
03:23:09,802 --> 03:23:11,761
could I do?

2080
03:23:13,306 --> 03:23:15,515
Where could I go...

2081
03:23:15,766 --> 03:23:19,060
in a world suddenly without you...

2082
03:23:20,104 --> 03:23:23,398
except to my son and my country...

2083
03:23:23,608 --> 03:23:26,151
Caesarion and Egypt?

2084
03:23:26,611 --> 03:23:29,696
I wanted to save them from Octavian.

2085
03:23:30,364 --> 03:23:32,824
You would have wanted me to go.

2086
03:23:33,200 --> 03:23:35,368
You would have commanded me to go.

2087
03:23:36,662 --> 03:23:39,080
Tell me you would have!

2088
03:23:43,836 --> 03:23:51,426
They told me you were dead.

2089
03:23:59,727 --> 03:24:01,811
You were quite right.

2090
03:24:02,438 --> 03:24:04,105
I am dead.

2091
03:24:35,554 --> 03:24:37,472
The armies of Gaius Julius Caesar...

2092
03:24:37,723 --> 03:24:40,809
are advancing without opposition
upon Alexandria.

2093
03:24:41,060 --> 03:24:43,979
Gaius Julius Caesar?

2094
03:24:44,188 --> 03:24:47,232
So now Octavian has
stolen all of the name.

2095
03:24:47,441 --> 03:24:52,153
Caesar wishes it known he has
no quarrel with Cleopatra of Egypt.

2096
03:24:52,363 --> 03:24:55,699
Then let him take his armies
out of here and go home.

2097
03:24:55,950 --> 03:24:59,619
He has charged me to say
that the choice of war or peace...

2098
03:24:59,829 --> 03:25:01,121
now rests with Egypt.

2099
03:25:01,372 --> 03:25:04,708
And that for himself,
he desires only peace.

2100
03:25:05,418 --> 03:25:09,713
And what are his terms
for this unconditional peace?

2101
03:25:09,964 --> 03:25:12,382
A small token.

2102
03:25:12,633 --> 03:25:15,719
A demonstration. A gesture.

2103
03:25:15,970 --> 03:25:19,389
An indication of Queen Cleopatra's
goodwill and good faith.

2104
03:25:19,598 --> 03:25:21,933
What does Octavian want?

2105
03:25:23,185 --> 03:25:24,811
Marc Antony.

2106
03:25:27,982 --> 03:25:29,399
The...

2107
03:25:29,984 --> 03:25:31,860
head of Marc Antony?

2108
03:25:49,503 --> 03:25:52,881
Take this to him as my answer.

2109
03:25:54,592 --> 03:25:56,843
Egyptian generosity.

2110
03:25:57,094 --> 03:26:00,972
Octavian may have two heads
for the price of one.

2111
03:26:01,182 --> 03:26:03,266
Either two...

2112
03:26:03,517 --> 03:26:04,934
or none.

2113
03:26:53,692 --> 03:26:55,527
I'm told you come here to sleep.

2114
03:26:57,279 --> 03:26:58,863
Not to sleep.

2115
03:26:59,532 --> 03:27:01,199
To pass the night then.

2116
03:27:01,534 --> 03:27:03,076
I'm not alone.

2117
03:27:05,037 --> 03:27:08,164
The old boy and I
exchange memories of life.

2118
03:27:08,415 --> 03:27:12,127
It's like having a roommate,
or should I say, "tomb-mate"?

2119
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:16,089
If he were in your place,
would I find Caesar here?

2120
03:27:16,340 --> 03:27:20,218
Hidden away, wrapped in moonlight
and endless self-pity?

2121
03:27:20,469 --> 03:27:23,388
Self-pity again! You repeat yourself!
Find new reproaches!

2122
03:27:23,597 --> 03:27:26,724
Until now it has just been
a part of your being drunk.

2123
03:27:26,976 --> 03:27:29,102
Singing sad songs for Antony.

2124
03:27:29,353 --> 03:27:33,690
Your time would be better spent
negotiating with Octavian.

2125
03:27:35,234 --> 03:27:38,403
Why did you not give my head to Agrippa?
It's no great loss to me.

2126
03:27:38,612 --> 03:27:42,532
Dying the second time is painless
and possibly an advantage to you.

2127
03:27:42,741 --> 03:27:45,368
The basis, perhaps,
of a great new alliance with Rome.

2128
03:27:45,578 --> 03:27:48,371
I do not want a great
new alliance with Rome.

2129
03:27:48,831 --> 03:27:50,582
What do you want?

2130
03:27:51,876 --> 03:27:54,085
I have come for Marc Antony.

2131
03:27:54,295 --> 03:27:57,088
What is left of his army,
Rufio, my son and I...

2132
03:27:57,298 --> 03:28:00,508
all of Egypt are waiting for him.

2133
03:28:00,718 --> 03:28:03,094
There is little time.

2134
03:28:03,554 --> 03:28:05,221
Marc Antony?

2135
03:28:06,473 --> 03:28:08,933
There is no one here by that name...

2136
03:28:09,768 --> 03:28:11,436
alive.

2137
03:28:30,623 --> 03:28:32,624
Time for what?

2138
03:28:33,918 --> 03:28:36,669
For Marc Antony
to appear in shiny armor...

2139
03:28:36,921 --> 03:28:39,047
swords flashing in both hands?

2140
03:28:39,298 --> 03:28:41,049
Agrippa. Octavian.

2141
03:28:41,258 --> 03:28:45,803
Stand back! Rejoice!
Marc Antony will save the day!

2142
03:28:52,311 --> 03:28:54,187
Antony, you say?

2143
03:28:54,438 --> 03:28:56,731
He died at Actium...

2144
03:28:56,982 --> 03:28:58,775
running away.

2145
03:28:59,401 --> 03:29:01,945
He tried to run on the water,
the story goes...

2146
03:29:02,112 --> 03:29:04,405
but you weren't there to hold his hand!

2147
03:29:10,120 --> 03:29:13,581
Rufio, my legions, waiting.

2148
03:29:13,832 --> 03:29:15,458
For what?

2149
03:29:16,252 --> 03:29:18,586
To ask me
what they carry in their eyes...

2150
03:29:18,837 --> 03:29:21,339
in their hearts, in their sleep,
as I have in mine.

2151
03:29:21,590 --> 03:29:24,425
Why are you not dead?

2152
03:29:24,677 --> 03:29:26,719
Why do you live? How can you live?

2153
03:29:26,929 --> 03:29:30,014
Why do you not lie
in the deepest hole of the sea...

2154
03:29:30,224 --> 03:29:34,185
bloodless and bloated and
at peace with honorable death?

2155
03:29:42,361 --> 03:29:46,406
You begged forgiveness from me
for running away.

2156
03:29:46,657 --> 03:29:50,743
You wept and gave your reason. A mother
to her child, a queen to her country.

2157
03:29:50,953 --> 03:29:53,830
Where and how can I weep and beg?
From whom?

2158
03:29:54,039 --> 03:29:57,583
The thousands and thousands
who can no longer hear me?

2159
03:30:00,170 --> 03:30:01,963
Shall I give my reason?

2160
03:30:02,881 --> 03:30:05,800
Shall I say simply, I loved?

2161
03:30:07,219 --> 03:30:09,095
When I saw you go, I saw nothing.

2162
03:30:09,305 --> 03:30:12,140
Felt, heard, thought nothing
except your going.

2163
03:30:12,349 --> 03:30:15,059
Not the dying and dead,
not Rome, not Egypt...

2164
03:30:15,269 --> 03:30:18,021
not victory or defeat,
honor or disgrace...

2165
03:30:18,272 --> 03:30:21,524
only that my love was going
and I must be with her.

2166
03:30:21,734 --> 03:30:24,319
That my love, my master, called.

2167
03:30:25,070 --> 03:30:26,612
And I followed.

2168
03:30:26,989 --> 03:30:29,198
And that only then...

2169
03:30:29,408 --> 03:30:32,243
I looked back...

2170
03:30:32,578 --> 03:30:34,912
and I saw.

2171
03:30:46,467 --> 03:30:48,551
How right you were.

2172
03:30:49,511 --> 03:30:53,598
"Have as your master
anyone, anything...

2173
03:30:54,850 --> 03:30:56,601
but never love."

2174
03:30:57,978 --> 03:30:59,771
How wrong.

2175
03:31:00,022 --> 03:31:02,440
How wrong I was.

2176
03:31:03,317 --> 03:31:07,111
Antony, the love you followed is here.

2177
03:31:08,030 --> 03:31:10,365
To be had upon payment of an empire.

2178
03:31:10,574 --> 03:31:13,076
Without you, Antony...

2179
03:31:13,327 --> 03:31:15,953
this is not a world
I want to live in...

2180
03:31:16,580 --> 03:31:19,123
much less conquer.

2181
03:31:20,834 --> 03:31:23,211
Because for me...

2182
03:31:23,462 --> 03:31:26,839
there would be no love anywhere.

2183
03:31:28,675 --> 03:31:32,136
Do you want me to die with you?
I will.

2184
03:31:33,680 --> 03:31:36,307
Or do you want me to live with you?

2185
03:31:38,519 --> 03:31:40,395
Whatever you choose.

2186
03:31:54,451 --> 03:31:58,329
Are we too late, do you think,
if we choose to live?

2187
03:31:58,914 --> 03:32:00,832
Better too late...

2188
03:32:01,291 --> 03:32:03,126
than never.

2189
03:33:03,520 --> 03:33:06,314
My lady, there is disturbing news
from the city.

2190
03:33:06,523 --> 03:33:10,818
The people are frightened. Some are
beginning to leave their homes.

2191
03:33:11,069 --> 03:33:14,697
During the night, hundreds of notices
were secretly posted everywhere.

2192
03:33:14,907 --> 03:33:17,575
They were found
stuck up in the marketplace.

2193
03:33:17,784 --> 03:33:20,411
Even painted on temples
and other holy places.

2194
03:33:20,662 --> 03:33:25,791
Signed by Octavian Gaius
Julius Caesar Augustus...

2195
03:33:26,376 --> 03:33:30,171
promising the Egyptian people
peace if they surrender to him...

2196
03:33:30,422 --> 03:33:32,423
and destruction if they do not.

2197
03:33:32,633 --> 03:33:36,135
I've had all of the notices removed
and I've ordered the death penalty...

2198
03:33:36,345 --> 03:33:40,765
for anyone who spreads the false rumors
that Antony's men might desert him.

2199
03:33:41,683 --> 03:33:45,728
And what penalty
if the rumors might come true?

2200
03:33:47,356 --> 03:33:49,273
How do you know?

2201
03:33:49,525 --> 03:33:51,567
I know the Romans.

2202
03:33:51,818 --> 03:33:54,904
There is only one commander
they will never desert.

2203
03:33:55,113 --> 03:33:57,573
His name is "Victory."

2204
03:33:58,283 --> 03:34:02,203
But yet, just now,
you let Lord Antony go as if...

2205
03:34:06,750 --> 03:34:10,878
If you could have seen him,
how proud he was...

2206
03:34:11,129 --> 03:34:13,047
unafraid...

2207
03:34:14,299 --> 03:34:16,175
as he used to be.

2208
03:34:17,678 --> 03:34:21,806
All of my attendants, have they been
given their freedom? Have they gone?

2209
03:34:22,057 --> 03:34:24,934
Yes. They wanted once more
to tidy up.

2210
03:34:25,143 --> 03:34:27,853
Octavian can do his own housecleaning.

2211
03:34:28,063 --> 03:34:32,358
The captain of the guards and three
of his best men are to report to me...

2212
03:34:32,568 --> 03:34:34,360
disguised as merchants.

2213
03:34:34,611 --> 03:34:38,072
They are to escort
Caesarion out of Egypt...

2214
03:34:39,032 --> 03:34:40,783
for the time being.

2215
03:34:41,326 --> 03:34:42,868
And you?

2216
03:34:43,287 --> 03:34:45,580
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

2217
03:34:45,789 --> 03:34:49,000
There are two of Euphranor's ships,
very fast, in the east harbor.

2218
03:34:49,209 --> 03:34:52,253
And would you roll me
on board in a carpet?

2219
03:34:52,879 --> 03:34:54,338
No.

2220
03:34:54,923 --> 03:34:59,677
There are no more Caesars to go to,
at least not for me.

2221
03:35:00,220 --> 03:35:04,390
- Then it is still your intention...
- To remain in Alexandria.

2222
03:35:04,641 --> 03:35:07,685
In the last possible place
anyone would look.

2223
03:35:08,604 --> 03:35:12,481
Literally, the last possible place.

2224
03:35:12,691 --> 03:35:15,943
Your Majesty, I have never
questioned your decisions.

2225
03:35:16,194 --> 03:35:18,029
This is not the time to begin.

2226
03:35:18,238 --> 03:35:19,822
Let me stay with you.

2227
03:35:20,032 --> 03:35:22,491
Charmian and Eiras will look after me.

2228
03:35:22,743 --> 03:35:24,577
If Lord Antony should...

2229
03:35:26,913 --> 03:35:30,124
When Lord Antony returns...

2230
03:35:30,375 --> 03:35:33,336
you will be here to tell him
where to find me...

2231
03:35:33,629 --> 03:35:35,630
waiting for him.

2232
03:35:36,798 --> 03:35:39,008
Together, we will then do...

2233
03:35:39,259 --> 03:35:41,260
what he thinks best.

2234
03:35:41,511 --> 03:35:42,762
Is that clear?

2235
03:35:45,891 --> 03:35:50,019
- Yes, my lady.
- Was there anything more?

2236
03:35:51,438 --> 03:35:53,773
I have always loved you.

2237
03:35:55,108 --> 03:35:57,318
And I have always known.

2238
03:36:09,831 --> 03:36:14,251
Rome has never known such an army.
We should be taking on all of Asia.

2239
03:36:14,503 --> 03:36:18,839
It seems a waste to slaughter what's
left of Antony's army and Antony.

2240
03:36:19,091 --> 03:36:22,927
There will be no slaughter.
I doubt there will be even bloodshed.

2241
03:36:23,136 --> 03:36:27,973
Has a battle ever been won without
a blow being struck? I wonder.

2242
03:36:28,225 --> 03:36:31,310
At any rate, let me
make it clear once more.

2243
03:36:31,561 --> 03:36:35,564
I want Antony alive,
and I want her alive.

2244
03:36:35,774 --> 03:36:38,401
She must be taken alive.

2245
03:36:41,196 --> 03:36:44,156
Queen Cleopatra's second procession
into Rome...

2246
03:36:44,408 --> 03:36:46,742
will surpass her first.

2247
03:36:59,464 --> 03:37:01,966
The ring your father gave you.

2248
03:37:03,385 --> 03:37:05,302
It is yours now...

2249
03:37:05,512 --> 03:37:07,263
to keep.

2250
03:37:07,472 --> 03:37:11,142
Wear it with pride and with honor.

2251
03:37:11,768 --> 03:37:13,352
I'm afraid.

2252
03:37:13,603 --> 03:37:15,730
I know I shouldn't be.

2253
03:37:16,314 --> 03:37:18,023
Who told you that?

2254
03:37:18,275 --> 03:37:20,192
All kings...

2255
03:37:20,444 --> 03:37:23,446
and especially queens, are afraid.

2256
03:37:23,655 --> 03:37:26,699
They just manage not to show it.

2257
03:37:26,908 --> 03:37:30,327
Something ordinary people cannot do.

2258
03:38:28,470 --> 03:38:32,056
Hail Antony!

2259
03:38:53,703 --> 03:38:56,997
- How near is Octavian?
- Very near. Over that low ridge.

2260
03:38:57,249 --> 03:39:01,252
As it grows darker, the glow from
his campfires will light up the sky.

2261
03:39:06,633 --> 03:39:09,802
Our troops must find it
attractive to watch.

2262
03:39:11,012 --> 03:39:12,513
Inviting, even.

2263
03:39:12,722 --> 03:39:15,683
Antony's legions warm themselves
at their own fires.

2264
03:39:15,934 --> 03:39:17,643
Yes.

2265
03:39:17,894 --> 03:39:21,063
I could feel the warmth as I rode by.

2266
03:39:22,357 --> 03:39:24,400
- How many legions has he?
- Twenty.

2267
03:39:24,609 --> 03:39:27,319
- And we?
- Two. The 12th and one made up...

2268
03:39:27,571 --> 03:39:30,030
Made up from what was left
of the others.

2269
03:39:30,240 --> 03:39:35,244
As I remember it, Caesar
held Alexandria with two.

2270
03:39:38,707 --> 03:39:41,292
How are they deployed? Rufio.

2271
03:39:44,588 --> 03:39:48,841
Cavalry to the left, cavalry
to the right, infantry to the center.

2272
03:39:49,092 --> 03:39:53,888
Three elephants deployed
to stamp out a fly.

2273
03:39:54,556 --> 03:39:58,601
My lords Octavian and Agrippa have
all the strategic brilliance...

2274
03:39:58,852 --> 03:40:00,895
of two vestal virgins.

2275
03:40:01,396 --> 03:40:03,564
We can draw back here
to softer ground...

2276
03:40:03,732 --> 03:40:06,358
too soft for cavalry
and make our stand against their infantry.

2277
03:40:06,568 --> 03:40:10,613
Stand? And let them stamp on us?
No. Let the elephants stand.

2278
03:40:10,864 --> 03:40:14,199
We flies will bite
and buzz and tickle.

2279
03:40:14,659 --> 03:40:16,660
At the first light of day...

2280
03:40:16,912 --> 03:40:20,706
while Octavian's glow
still lights up the sky...

2281
03:40:21,124 --> 03:40:22,499
we will attack.

2282
03:40:25,629 --> 03:40:28,881
By sunset, both our loyal legions
will have grown larger...

2283
03:40:29,132 --> 03:40:31,342
and even more loyal, I promise you.

2284
03:40:32,969 --> 03:40:34,261
Good night.

2285
03:40:43,772 --> 03:40:46,690
Rufio, tell the guards, please...

2286
03:40:46,942 --> 03:40:49,276
I am to be awakened
just before dawn.

2287
03:40:49,486 --> 03:40:50,653
Of course.

2288
03:40:50,904 --> 03:40:52,404
And, Rufio...

2289
03:40:53,657 --> 03:40:58,786
if, for whatever reason, the guards
should forget or misjudge the time...

2290
03:40:59,037 --> 03:41:00,788
will you, yourself, wake me?

2291
03:41:01,164 --> 03:41:02,665
The guards will wake you.

2292
03:41:05,710 --> 03:41:08,587
- But if they don't?
- Then I will. Never fear.

2293
03:41:09,339 --> 03:41:11,048
I never fear.

2294
03:41:16,638 --> 03:41:18,472
Not anymore.

2295
03:42:18,241 --> 03:42:19,616
Rufio!

2296
03:43:33,775 --> 03:43:35,484
Rufio.

2297
03:45:58,711 --> 03:46:00,311
Fight!

2298
03:46:16,437 --> 03:46:18,563
Why don't you fight?

2299
03:46:43,298 --> 03:46:46,133
Is there no one
who would grant Antony...

2300
03:46:46,384 --> 03:46:49,136
an honorable way to die?

2301
03:47:11,492 --> 03:47:13,410
Before me...

2302
03:47:13,953 --> 03:47:18,623
this was carried by another Roman
killed by Rome.

2303
03:47:18,833 --> 03:47:20,500
Another...

2304
03:47:21,127 --> 03:47:23,003
Caesar.

2305
03:47:32,347 --> 03:47:33,638
No.

2306
03:47:34,640 --> 03:47:36,975
We will have him.

2307
03:47:37,685 --> 03:47:40,520
We will have them both together.

2308
03:49:21,539 --> 03:49:26,334
Where is she?

2309
03:49:27,879 --> 03:49:30,046
Her Majesty said to tell you...

2310
03:49:30,256 --> 03:49:34,801
she can be found in the last
possible place anyone would look.

2311
03:49:36,971 --> 03:49:40,432
Literally, the last possible place.

2312
03:49:46,189 --> 03:49:47,731
She might have waited.

2313
03:49:48,316 --> 03:49:50,650
Once more, it seems...

2314
03:49:51,152 --> 03:49:54,821
Cleopatra is out of reach...

2315
03:49:55,281 --> 03:49:57,866
and I must hurry after.

2316
03:49:58,117 --> 03:50:00,118
Throughout life...

2317
03:50:00,369 --> 03:50:02,162
and now beyond.

2318
03:50:02,413 --> 03:50:06,625
One woman, one love!

2319
03:50:09,795 --> 03:50:11,922
Nothing changes...

2320
03:50:12,590 --> 03:50:14,841
except life into death.

2321
03:50:24,143 --> 03:50:25,810
Will you help me?

2322
03:50:31,484 --> 03:50:33,235
Help me to die, Apollodorus!

2323
03:50:33,486 --> 03:50:35,237
I want to!

2324
03:50:36,197 --> 03:50:37,781
But I can't.

2325
03:50:52,880 --> 03:50:56,132
I've always envied Rufio...

2326
03:50:56,384 --> 03:50:59,052
his long arms.

2327
03:51:17,238 --> 03:51:19,781
The ultimate desertion:

2328
03:51:20,032 --> 03:51:22,325
I from myself.

2329
03:51:22,577 --> 03:51:27,497
Else, how could I have missed what
I must have aimed for all my life?

2330
03:51:28,708 --> 03:51:30,709
Will you finish me now?

2331
03:51:32,128 --> 03:51:35,880
Where is my sword?
I beg you to finish me.

2332
03:51:36,132 --> 03:51:39,050
I lied to you.
I let you think the queen is dead.

2333
03:51:39,260 --> 03:51:42,012
But she's alive in her tomb,
waiting for you.

2334
03:51:44,181 --> 03:51:46,391
Cleopatra waiting?

2335
03:51:47,852 --> 03:51:51,813
There will be just enough time...

2336
03:51:52,023 --> 03:51:53,898
if you'll help me.

2337
03:52:53,417 --> 03:52:56,836
Perhaps, my lady, if we were
to bind his wounds tightly...

2338
03:52:57,046 --> 03:53:01,883
It would only give him pain.
Let him sleep.

2339
03:53:13,646 --> 03:53:15,522
Sleep.

2340
03:53:16,440 --> 03:53:18,775
Will you come tonight...

2341
03:53:19,735 --> 03:53:21,695
so that I can sleep?

2342
03:53:22,988 --> 03:53:25,448
The dark sleep.

2343
03:53:28,160 --> 03:53:30,995
They did meet after all...

2344
03:53:31,205 --> 03:53:33,373
the lovers.

2345
03:53:33,791 --> 03:53:35,792
They will always meet.

2346
03:53:37,378 --> 03:53:39,671
Be lonely for me.

2347
03:53:40,214 --> 03:53:42,549
But not for very long.

2348
03:53:42,800 --> 03:53:44,843
I promise.

2349
03:53:47,221 --> 03:53:49,723
I thought always I would die...

2350
03:53:49,932 --> 03:53:52,726
so well...

2351
03:53:53,436 --> 03:53:55,437
as becomes a soldier.

2352
03:53:57,773 --> 03:54:00,150
A soldier's death.

2353
03:54:01,861 --> 03:54:04,863
I lived always as I saw fit.

2354
03:54:07,742 --> 03:54:09,743
Unfittingly.

2355
03:54:09,952 --> 03:54:13,621
I would make it up, I thought,
in death.

2356
03:54:14,165 --> 03:54:16,166
I expected...

2357
03:54:16,959 --> 03:54:19,627
I expected too much of me in death...

2358
03:54:20,504 --> 03:54:22,589
as in life.

2359
03:54:23,007 --> 03:54:25,175
Are you holding me?

2360
03:54:25,384 --> 03:54:27,761
Never so closely.

2361
03:54:27,970 --> 03:54:30,096
Even closer.

2362
03:54:32,558 --> 03:54:35,310
You and I will prove death...

2363
03:54:35,519 --> 03:54:38,438
so much less than love.

2364
03:54:40,524 --> 03:54:42,525
You and I, we will...

2365
03:54:43,235 --> 03:54:45,278
We'll make of dying...

2366
03:54:45,863 --> 03:54:48,573
nothing more than one...

2367
03:54:49,325 --> 03:54:51,326
last...

2368
03:54:51,994 --> 03:54:53,870
embrace.

2369
03:54:59,210 --> 03:55:00,543
A kiss...

2370
03:55:02,963 --> 03:55:05,548
to take my breath away.

2371
03:55:25,444 --> 03:55:28,196
There has never been...

2372
03:55:28,739 --> 03:55:31,199
such a silence.

2373
03:56:15,703 --> 03:56:17,495
Turn him over.

2374
03:56:23,878 --> 03:56:27,922
Strange people.
Poisons that smell like perfume.

2375
03:56:28,132 --> 03:56:32,510
Find more. Have it analyzed.
Test it on one of the badly wounded.

2376
03:56:38,267 --> 03:56:41,311
My lord, they have
found Queen Cleopatra.

2377
03:56:41,520 --> 03:56:44,105
She is locked in a building,
that is to say, a tomb.

2378
03:56:44,315 --> 03:56:45,857
Hurry.

2379
03:56:51,655 --> 03:56:56,075
Oh, Marc Antony is with her,
they say. He's dead.

2380
03:56:58,287 --> 03:57:01,289
- What?
- Lord Antony is dead.

2381
03:57:03,542 --> 03:57:06,085
Is that how one says it?

2382
03:57:07,171 --> 03:57:09,422
As simply as that.

2383
03:57:10,758 --> 03:57:12,926
Marc Antony is dead.

2384
03:57:14,428 --> 03:57:16,721
Lord Antony is dead.

2385
03:57:18,891 --> 03:57:22,477
The soup is hot. The soup is cold.

2386
03:57:22,686 --> 03:57:26,522
Antony is living. Antony is dead.

2387
03:57:28,567 --> 03:57:32,111
Shake with terror when
such words pass your lips...

2388
03:57:32,321 --> 03:57:36,491
for fear they be untrue and Antony
cut out your tongue for the lie!

2389
03:57:36,700 --> 03:57:38,409
And if true...

2390
03:57:38,786 --> 03:57:41,079
for your lifetime boast...

2391
03:57:41,288 --> 03:57:45,500
that you were honored
to speak his name even in death.

2392
03:57:45,876 --> 03:57:48,628
The dying of such a man...

2393
03:57:48,837 --> 03:57:51,339
must be shouted.

2394
03:57:51,548 --> 03:57:53,341
Screamed.

2395
03:57:53,592 --> 03:57:58,012
It must echo back
from the corners of the universe.

2396
03:57:59,014 --> 03:58:01,766
Antony is dead!

2397
03:58:02,393 --> 03:58:07,397
Marc Antony of Rome lives no more!

2398
03:58:28,627 --> 03:58:31,546
You needn't lower
your head before Caesar.

2399
03:58:32,047 --> 03:58:34,090
I never did.

2400
03:58:34,299 --> 03:58:36,801
But if he were here, I'd be happy to.

2401
03:58:37,011 --> 03:58:39,470
I am Caesar.

2402
03:58:39,680 --> 03:58:41,889
If it pleases you, Octavian.

2403
03:58:43,475 --> 03:58:45,268
Look at me.

2404
03:58:45,477 --> 03:58:47,020
If it pleases you.

2405
03:58:50,190 --> 03:58:53,693
After all this time
and all that has happened...

2406
03:58:53,944 --> 03:58:57,822
I suppose you are still beautiful,
in a way.

2407
03:58:58,282 --> 03:58:59,741
You flatter me.

2408
03:58:59,950 --> 03:59:03,411
My interest is impersonal.
Should you have any intention...

2409
03:59:03,662 --> 03:59:05,580
Now you flatter yourself.

2410
03:59:05,789 --> 03:59:08,374
The fighting is over.

2411
03:59:08,584 --> 03:59:12,587
Your country, your possessions
and you are mine by right of conquest.

2412
03:59:12,838 --> 03:59:17,383
I will permit you to rule Egypt as a Roman
province and return your possessions.

2413
03:59:17,634 --> 03:59:21,846
There is one condition.
You will first accompany me to Rome.

2414
03:59:22,681 --> 03:59:24,515
Behind your chariot?

2415
03:59:24,725 --> 03:59:26,225
Look at me!

2416
03:59:32,900 --> 03:59:36,778
Would the proud citizens of Rome
wait for hours in the hot sun...

2417
03:59:36,987 --> 03:59:40,281
to see my dead body
dragged through the Forum?

2418
03:59:40,532 --> 03:59:42,450
I'll have you closely watched.

2419
03:59:44,411 --> 03:59:46,245
Octavian...

2420
03:59:46,455 --> 03:59:49,373
when I am ready to die...

2421
03:59:50,250 --> 03:59:52,919
I will die.

2422
04:00:05,682 --> 04:00:08,184
What if I promise
no harm will come to you...

2423
04:00:08,393 --> 04:00:10,645
that you will be returned
safely to Alexandria?

2424
04:00:11,146 --> 04:00:13,147
Look at me!

2425
04:00:15,567 --> 04:00:17,568
What more could you ask?

2426
04:00:21,824 --> 04:00:23,574
You have not spoken...

2427
04:00:23,784 --> 04:00:25,034
of my son.

2428
04:00:25,994 --> 04:00:29,247
Your son. I'd forgotten him.

2429
04:00:29,498 --> 04:00:30,873
Where is he?

2430
04:00:31,083 --> 04:00:32,959
Safe.

2431
04:00:35,420 --> 04:00:38,589
If I go with you to Rome...

2432
04:00:39,591 --> 04:00:42,468
would you permit my son
to rule Egypt?

2433
04:00:42,970 --> 04:00:44,679
And his sons?

2434
04:00:44,930 --> 04:00:46,597
And theirs?

2435
04:00:46,807 --> 04:00:48,766
I'll do everything I can.

2436
04:00:49,351 --> 04:00:51,602
Do I have your word...

2437
04:00:51,854 --> 04:00:54,105
as a Roman emperor and god?

2438
04:00:57,109 --> 04:00:58,693
Yes.

2439
04:01:00,821 --> 04:01:02,864
When will you require me to go?

2440
04:01:03,073 --> 04:01:04,615
As soon as possible.

2441
04:01:06,952 --> 04:01:10,580
At the moment, I am very tired
and would like to rest.

2442
04:01:10,831 --> 04:01:12,165
If you'll leave me now.

2443
04:01:12,624 --> 04:01:15,293
Do I have your word...

2444
04:01:15,502 --> 04:01:18,254
that you will not harm yourself
in any way?

2445
04:01:19,298 --> 04:01:21,549
I swear it.

2446
04:01:23,177 --> 04:01:25,344
On the life of my son.

2447
04:01:35,480 --> 04:01:37,982
Must the guards remain inside?

2448
04:01:38,192 --> 04:01:40,109
I have sworn...

2449
04:01:40,360 --> 04:01:41,986
after all...

2450
04:01:43,113 --> 04:01:46,407
on the life of my son.

2451
04:01:56,877 --> 04:01:59,921
And now I must make ready to go.

2452
04:02:00,130 --> 04:02:01,589
There's little to do.

2453
04:02:02,925 --> 04:02:05,760
First, I shall want something to eat.

2454
04:02:07,179 --> 04:02:10,640
Something to sustain me on my way.

2455
04:02:10,849 --> 04:02:12,558
Some fruit, perhaps?

2456
04:02:12,768 --> 04:02:14,101
Bring it to me.

2457
04:02:16,688 --> 04:02:18,481
Charmian.

2458
04:02:21,526 --> 04:02:23,486
You then, Eiras.

2459
04:02:24,613 --> 04:02:27,240
You have never been without us.

2460
04:02:28,200 --> 04:02:29,784
You cannot leave us behind.

2461
04:02:31,036 --> 04:02:33,079
Perhaps...

2462
04:02:33,622 --> 04:02:36,207
there may be enough for us all.

2463
04:02:36,917 --> 04:02:39,252
Bring me a tablet to write on.

2464
04:02:39,503 --> 04:02:41,629
I want a message
brought to Octavian.

2465
04:02:41,838 --> 04:02:44,382
Words are wasted on such a man.

2466
04:02:44,633 --> 04:02:48,511
I have wasted so many on so many men.

2467
04:02:48,804 --> 04:02:51,555
A few more. One last request.

2468
04:02:51,807 --> 04:02:54,350
Will he grant it, do you think?

2469
04:02:54,685 --> 04:02:56,477
I may never know.

2470
04:02:59,564 --> 04:03:01,857
In this case...

2471
04:03:02,818 --> 04:03:04,777
I think I shall.

2472
04:03:12,828 --> 04:03:15,621
I will serve Her Majesty as always.

2473
04:03:15,872 --> 04:03:17,707
I have always served her.

2474
04:03:17,916 --> 04:03:20,209
You will both wait...

2475
04:03:20,419 --> 04:03:22,920
to dress me for my travels.

2476
04:03:23,547 --> 04:03:25,214
I will wear...

2477
04:03:27,175 --> 04:03:30,011
I want to be as Antony first saw me.

2478
04:03:30,387 --> 04:03:32,513
The dress of gold?

2479
04:03:33,056 --> 04:03:34,557
He must know at once...

2480
04:03:35,309 --> 04:03:37,727
even from a great distance...

2481
04:03:37,978 --> 04:03:39,812
that it is I.

2482
04:03:41,273 --> 04:03:43,691
This will be the last thing you do.

2483
04:03:43,942 --> 04:03:47,320
Drop this to one of the guards outside
for Octavian.

2484
04:03:48,697 --> 04:03:51,073
But be sure to wait.

2485
04:04:10,260 --> 04:04:14,388
And now let me see if the figs
are as they should be.

2486
04:04:41,833 --> 04:04:44,668
The taste of these, they say,
is sharp...

2487
04:04:44,878 --> 04:04:47,171
and swiftly over.

2488
04:04:52,677 --> 04:04:55,721
How strangely awake I feel.

2489
04:04:56,515 --> 04:05:00,101
As if living
had been just a long dream.

2490
04:05:01,770 --> 04:05:04,063
Someone else's dream.

2491
04:05:04,898 --> 04:05:07,817
Now finished at last.

2492
04:05:13,281 --> 04:05:15,533
But then now...

2493
04:05:15,742 --> 04:05:17,827
will begin...

2494
04:05:18,829 --> 04:05:21,163
a dream of my own...

2495
04:05:23,291 --> 04:05:25,334
which will never end.

2496
04:05:28,505 --> 04:05:30,131
Antony?

2497
04:05:33,593 --> 04:05:35,761
Antony, wait.

2498
04:05:49,317 --> 04:05:52,069
From the Egyptian queen,
a message for Caesar.

2499
04:05:52,320 --> 04:05:56,615
Read it. Whatever she wants will be
granted upon her arrival in Rome.

2500
04:05:56,825 --> 04:06:00,369
We will discuss it
as she walks beside my chariot.

2501
04:06:01,496 --> 04:06:02,872
What is it?

2502
04:06:03,081 --> 04:06:06,125
"My one wish,
which I implore you to grant..."

2503
04:06:06,376 --> 04:06:09,795
is to be buried at the site of
Antony and to remain there...

2504
04:06:10,046 --> 04:06:12,047
"...until all things end."

2505
04:07:05,810 --> 04:07:08,562
Was this well done of your lady?

2506
04:07:10,857 --> 04:07:13,150
Extremely well.

2507
04:07:13,527 --> 04:07:15,236
As befitting...

2508
04:07:15,445 --> 04:07:18,155
the last of so many noble...

2509
04:07:19,282 --> 04:07:21,283
rulers.

2510
04:07:27,415 --> 04:07:29,625
And the Roman asked:

2511
04:07:29,834 --> 04:07:32,753
"Was this well done of your lady?"

2512
04:07:33,588 --> 04:07:35,881
And the servant answered:

2513
04:07:36,341 --> 04:07:39,009
"Extremely well."

2514
04:07:39,219 --> 04:07:41,387
As befitting the last...

2515
04:07:41,638 --> 04:07:45,891
"...of so many noble rulers."
