1
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,411
Holŕ!

2
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,457
Don't tell me.
Ya didn't know it was loaded.

3
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,752
- Sylvie!
- Oh.

4
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,130
Can't he do something constructive,
like start an avalanche or something?

5
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,299
Va jouer, mon chéri.

6
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,887
When you start to eat like this,
something is the matter.

7
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,808
Sylvie, I'm getting a divorce.

8
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:32,104
- What? From Charles?
- He's the only husband I have.

9
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:37,068
- I've tried to make it work, really I have, but -
- But what?

10
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,696
I can't explain. It's just that I'm too miserable
to go on any longer like this.

11
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,869
It is infuriating that your unhappiness
does not turn to fat.

12
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,167
But I don't understand.
Why do you want a divorce?

13
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,128
Because I don't love him.
And he obviously doesn't love me.

14
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,714
That's no reason to get a divorce.

15
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,841
With a rich husband
and this year's clothes...

16
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,719
you won't find it difficult
to make some new friends.

17
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,389
I admit I came to Paris
to escape American provincial...

18
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,475
but that doesn't mean I'm ready
for French traditional.

19
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,186
I loathe the whole idea
of divorce, Sylvie.

20
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,438
But if only Charles had
been honest with me.

21
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,774
That's all I ask of anybody:
the simple truth.

22
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:21,570
But with Charles,
everything is secrecy and lies.

23
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,282
He's hiding something
from me, Sylvie -

24
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,869
something terrible -
and it frightens me.

25
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,871
Does he belong to you?

26
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,666
It's hers. Where'd you find him?
Robbing a bank?

27
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,876
He was throwing snowballs
at Baron Rothschild.

28
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,171
- Oh, thank you.
- Do we know each other?

29
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,675
- Why? Do you think we're going to?
- I don't know. How would I know?

30
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,927
Because I already know
an awful lot of people.

31
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,888
Until one of them dies
I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

32
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:52,143
Hmm. Well, if anyone goes
on the critical list, let me know.

33
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,186
- Quitter.
- Uh, what?

34
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,314
You give up awfully easily, don't you?

35
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,152
Viens, Jean-Louis. Let us make a walk.
I've never seen a Rothschild before.

36
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,661
Clever fellow. Almost missed me.

37
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,663
Thank you.

38
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:17,293
- You're blocking my view.
- Oh.

39
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,421
- Which view would you prefer?
- The one you're blocking.

40
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,174
It's my last chance.
I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon.

41
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,676
- What's your name?
- Peter Joshua.

42
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,429
- Mine's Regina Lampert.
- Is there a Mr. Lampert?

43
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,680
- Yes.
- Good for you.

44
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,348
No, it isn't.
I'm getting a divorce.

45
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,560
- Please, not on my account.
- No. I don't really love him.

46
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,189
- At least you're honest.
- Hmm. Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

47
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,566
Yes, but we're divorced.

48
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,943
That wasn't a proposal.
I'm just curious.

49
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,404
Is your husband with you?

50
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,948
Oh, no, Charles is never with me.
What do people call you? Pete?

51
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,451
Mr. Joshua.

52
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,871
- I've enjoyed talking with you.
- Now you're angry.

53
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,291
No, I just have a lot of packing to do.
I'm going back to Paris, too.

54
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,336
Wasn't it Shakespeare who said
when strangers do meet in far-off lands...

55
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,379
they should ere long
see each other again?

56
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,591
- Shakespeare never said that.
- How do you know?

57
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,635
It's terrible.
You just made it up.

58
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,637
Well, it sounds right.
You going to call me?

59
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,014
- Are you in the book?
- Well, Charles is.

60
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,225
- Is there only one Charles Lampert?
- Mmm.

61
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,729
Lord, I hope so.

62
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,326
Good-bye, Sylvie, and thanks.

63
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,829
When you get your divorce,
are you going back to America?

64
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:39,750
- Don't you want me to stay?
- Of course, but if you went
back and wrote me a letter -

65
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,503
You could have the stamps.
I'll get you some here, okay?

66
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,548
- Okay.
- Good-bye.

67
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,142
Merci.

68
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,783
Honorine?

69
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,205
Honorine.

70
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,835
- Madame Charles Lampert?
- Yes.

71
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,547
I'm Inspector Edouard Grandpierre
of the police judiciaire.

72
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,175
Would you be so kind
as to come with me, please?

73
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,075
Well, madame?

74
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,079
You are positive?

75
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,750
You loved him?

76
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,087
I'm very cold.

77
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,643
We discovered your husband's body...

78
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,313
lying next to the tracks
of the Paris-Bordeaux railroad line.

79
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,650
He was dressed only in his pajamas.

80
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:14,363
Do you know of any reason
why he might have wanted to leave France?

81
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,782
Leave? No.

82
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:21,662
Your husband possessed
a ticket of passage on the Maranguape.

83
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,915
It sailed for Venezuela
this morning at 7:00.

84
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,917
I'm very confused.

85
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,504
- He was American, your husband?
- Swiss.

86
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,382
Ah, Swiss.
His profession?

87
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,302
- He didn't have one.
- He was a wealthy man?

88
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,304
I suppose so.
I don't know.

89
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,640
- About how wealthy, would you say?
- I don't know.

90
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,851
Where did he keep his money?

91
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,853
I don't know.

92
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,356
Besides yourself,
who is his nearest relative?

93
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:54,194
- I don't know.
- That's absurd, madame. Totalement absurde.

94
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,488
I know. I'm sorry.

95
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:00,075
- It is all right?
- I wish you wouldn't.

96
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,291
- Les effets de Lampert.
- D'accord.

97
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,213
On Wednesday last, your husband sold the entire
contents of the apartment at public auction.

98
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,215
Everything.

99
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,510
The gallery paid him
1,250,000 new francs -

100
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,388
in dollars,
a quarter of a million.

101
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,808
The authorities in Bordeaux searched
his compartment on the train.

102
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,810
They searched it thoroughly.

103
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,772
They did not find $250,000.

104
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,404
These few things are all that was found
in the train compartment.

105
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:41,575
There was no other baggage.
Your husband must have been in a great hurry.

106
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,913
One wallet containing 4,000 francs.

107
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,875
One agenda. His last notation was
made yesterday, Thursday -

108
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,753
5:00 p.m., Jardins des Champs-Ă‰lysĂ©es.

109
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,755
- Why there?
- I don't know.

110
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,426
- Perhaps he met somebody.
- Obviously.

111
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,054
One ticket of passage to South America.

112
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:06,934
One letter, stamped but unsealed,
addressed to you.

113
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,312
May I see it, please?

114
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,360
"My dear Regina,
I hope you are enjoying your holiday.

115
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,612
"MegĂ¨ve can be so lovely
at this time of year.

116
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,115
"The days pass very slowly,
and I hope to see you soon.

117
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,117
"As always, Charles.

118
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:27,579
P.S. Your dentist called yesterday.
Your appointment has been changed."

119
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,581
Not much, is it?

120
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,042
We took the liberty
of calling your dentist.

121
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,044
We thought perhaps
we would learn something.

122
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,463
- Did you?
- Yes.

123
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,882
Your appointment has been changed.

124
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,143
One key to your apartment.

125
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,187
One comb.

126
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,273
One fountain pen.

127
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,650
One toothbrush.

128
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,862
One tin of tooth powder.
That is all.

129
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,201
If you will sign this list,
you may take the things with you.

130
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,746
Is that all?
May I leave now?

131
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,416
One more question.

132
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,419
Is this your husband's passport?

133
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,089
Yes.

134
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,175
And this?

135
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,137
I don't understand.

136
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:34,104
And this?

137
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,888
Oh, I telephoned but nobody answered.

138
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,725
- Hello.
- Hello.

139
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:16,146
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am
and see if there's anything I can do.

140
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,232
How did you find out?

141
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,651
It's in the afternoon papers.

142
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:24,571
- I'm very sorry.
- Thank you.

143
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,574
Uh-- Uh, I pressed the bell,
but it isn't ringing, I guess.

144
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,535
I know.
There's no electricity.

145
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,956
Well, where did everything go?

146
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,167
Charles sold it all at auction.
This is all I have left.

147
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,006
I love this room, but Charles never really
saw it - only the things in it.

148
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,927
I think I prefer it this way.

149
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,097
What are you going to do?

150
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,684
Try and get my old job back
at EURESCO, I suppose.

151
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:57,563
- Doing what?
- I'm a simultaneous translator, like Sylvie.

152
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,274
Only she's English into French,
and I'm French into English.

153
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,735
That's what I was doing
before I married Charles.

154
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,196
The police probably think I killed him.

155
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,532
Instant divorce, you mean?

156
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,618
Something like that.

157
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,538
It's terrible it ended this way, though -

158
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,041
tossed off a train
like a sack of third-class mail.

159
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,420
- Well, come on. You can't stay here.
- I don't know where to go.

160
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,880
We'll find you a hotel.

161
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,634
Nothing too expensive.

162
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,803
I'm not a lady of leisure
anymore, you know.

163
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,306
Something clean and modest
and near enough to EURESCO...

164
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,474
so you can take a cab when it rains.

165
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,768
- Okay?
- Okay.

166
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,497
Not a very large turnout, is it?

167
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,833
Didn't Charles have any friends?

168
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,836
Don't ask me.
I'm only the widow.

169
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,548
If Charles had died in bed,
we wouldn't even have him.

170
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,471
At least he knows
how to behave at funerals.

171
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,398
Have you no idea
who could have done it?

172
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,736
Until two days ago the only thing
I really knew about Charles was his name.

173
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,447
Now it seems I didn't even know that.

174
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,220
- He must have known Charles pretty well.
- How can you tell?

175
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,305
He's allergic to him.

176
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,020
Bless you.

177
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,232
- Do you know him?
- Never seen him before.

178
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,856
Arrivederci, Charlie.

179
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,698
Miz Lampert, ma'am -

180
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,868
Uh, Miz Lampert, ma'am...

181
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,705
Charlie had no call
of doin' it thataway.

182
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,207
No sirree.

183
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,246
What next?

184
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,212
Mille pardons, madame.

185
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:55,342
- Merci.
- Pardon. Pardon.

186
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,804
Pardon. Pardon.

187
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,015
- Who's it from?
- The American Embassy.

188
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,823
I bluffed the old man out of the last pot
with a pair of deuces.

189
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,825
What's so depressing about that?

190
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,119
Well, if I can do it,
what are the Russians doing to him?

191
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,051
Hello?

192
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,929
Is there anything wrong, Miss Tompkins?

193
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,723
Uh, Miss Tompkins isn't here.

194
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,896
Oh, I'm sorry.
My secretary must have gone to lunch.

195
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,567
- Uh, you are -
- Mrs. Lampert. Mrs. Charles Lampert.

196
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:58,446
Oh, yes. Please, uh,
come in, Mrs. Lampert.

197
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,993
Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert.

198
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,829
It's a stubborn little devil.

199
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,208
Dry cleaning-wise,
things are all fouled up.

200
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:15,630
I had a good man -
a really excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu...

201
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:20,927
but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here
in the building to ease the gold outflow.

202
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,680
Mr. Bartholomew,
are you quite sure you know who I am?

203
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,849
You're Charles Lampert's widow, yes?

204
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,060
I'm very sorry.

205
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,148
Last time I sent out a tie,
only the spot came back.

206
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,444
VoilĂ , as they say.

207
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,654
Won't you sit down, Mrs. Lampert?

208
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,992
I've got something here.

209
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,788
I've got liverwurst, liverwurst,
chicken and liverwurst.

210
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,957
No, thank you.

211
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,753
Mrs. Lampert,
do you know what C.I.A. is?

212
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,172
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?

213
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,968
Central Intelligence Agency. C.I.A.

214
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,054
You mean spies and all of that?

215
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:07,474
- Only we call them agents.
- "We"? You mean you -

216
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,559
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert.

217
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,646
I didn't think people like you
were supposed to admit -

218
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,318
Oh, I'm not an agent.
I'm an administrator, a desk jockey...

219
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,864
trying to run a bureau
of overworked men with underallocated...

220
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,824
funds.

221
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,327
Congress seems to think
that all a spy needs -

222
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:31,122
- Agent.
- Yes.

223
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:36,294
That all he needs is a codebook,
a cyanide pill and he's in business.

224
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,298
What's all this got to do
with me, Mr. Bartholomew?

225
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,468
Your husband was wanted
by the United States government.

226
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,473
May I have a sandwich, please?

227
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,768
- Chicken or liverwurst?
- Chicken.

228
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:57,107
To be more specific, Mrs. Lampert,
your husband was wanted by this agency.

229
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,109
- So that was it.
- Yes.

230
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,361
We, of course, knew him
by his real name -

231
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,698
Voss. Charles Voss.

232
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,994
All right, Mrs. Voss.

233
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,790
I'd like you to look at this photograph
for a moment, please.

234
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,626
Tell us if you recogni - Oh.

235
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,546
By the way,
have you seen this one?

236
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,924
Scott, Cathy and Ham, Jr.

237
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,719
- Very sweet.
- Aren't they?

238
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,638
- All right, Mrs. Voss -
- Please stop calling me that.

239
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:32,726
- Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
- I'm terribly sorry.

240
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,980
Mrs. Lampert, would you look at that photograph
and tell me if you recognize anyone?

241
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,816
Just a moment.
Have a good look.

242
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,321
- It's Charles.
- Very good.

243
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:50,702
- He looks so young. When was this taken?
- 1944. Next, please.

244
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,997
The man who was
at the funeral yesterday.

245
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,249
A tall man in a corduroy suit.

246
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:01,004
- Does the name Tex Penthollow
mean anything to you?
- No.

247
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,006
- You like some wine?
- No, thank you.

248
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,508
Next, please.

249
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,387
He was there, too.
A little less hair, but it's the same one.

250
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,515
Do you know him, Mrs. Lampert?
Leopold W. Gideon?

251
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,851
- No.
- The last one, please.

252
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,688
That's a face you don't forget.

253
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,649
- He was there, too.
- Herman Scobie.

254
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,361
- You've never seen him before either?
- No, thank heaven.

255
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:30,950
Mrs. Lampert, I'm very much afraid
that you are in a great deal of danger.

256
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,203
Why should I be in any danger?

257
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,122
You're Charles Voss's wife.

258
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,374
Now that he's dead,
you're their only lead.

259
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:42,128
Mr. Bartholomew,
if you're trying to frighten me...

260
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,464
you're doing a first-rate job.

261
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,050
Please do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert.
It's your only chance.

262
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,929
Gladly. But I don't know what you want.
You haven't told me.

263
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,890
Oh? I haven't?

264
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,478
Well, it's the money,
Mrs. Lampert, the money.

265
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:02,649
The $250,000 Charles Voss
received from the auction.

266
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,610
Those three men want it, too.
They want it very badly.

267
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,321
But that's Charles's money, not theirs.

268
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,699
Oh, Mrs. Lampert, I'd love to see you try
and convince them of that.

269
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,453
- Oh, boy.
- But then whose is it? His or theirs?

270
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,331
Ours.

271
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,667
Oh.

272
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,754
Charles Voss stole $250,000
from the United States government.

273
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,675
- I'm afraid we want it back.
- But I don't have it.

274
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,512
That's impossible, Mrs. Lampert.

275
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,514
You're the only one who could have it.

276
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,725
Mr. Bartholomew,
if I had a quarter of a million dollars...

277
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,769
believe me, I'd know it.

278
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,689
Nevertheless, Mrs. Lampert, you've got it.

279
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,692
You mean it's just lying around somewhere,
all that cash?

280
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:50,572
Or a certified check,
safe-deposit key, baggage claim.

281
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,949
- Look for it. I'm quite sure you'll find it.
- But -

282
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:57,537
Look for it.
Look just as hard and as fast as you can.

283
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,956
You may not have a great deal of time.

284
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,085
Those three men know you've got
the money just as surely as we do.

285
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,462
You won't be safe until
the money's in our hands.

286
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,673
Is that clear?

287
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,719
Here's where you're
to call me, day or night.

288
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,180
It's a direct line to both my office -

289
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,182
and my apartment.

290
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,642
And please don't tell anyone
about coming to see us today.

291
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,020
It could prove fatal
for them as well as yourself.

292
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,356
As I said, Mrs. Lampert,
I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.

293
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,901
I regret very much
having to say this, but...

294
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,237
please remember what happened
to your husband.

295
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,547
- Hello.
- Hello, Peter.

296
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:53,468
Didn't you telephone me
to meet you on that corner over there?

297
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,720
I'm sorry.
I heard the children laughing.

298
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:01,017
- Do you understand French?
- Not a word.

299
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,603
I'm still having trouble with English.

300
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,105
The man and the woman are married.

301
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,234
Oh, I can see that.
They're batting each other over the head.

302
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,277
Ay, ay, ay!

303
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:15,240
Oh lĂ  lĂ  IĂ ! Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

304
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,534
- Who's that with the hat?
- That's the policeman.

305
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,120
He wants to arrest Judy
for killing Punch.

306
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:26,918
- What's she saying now?
- That she's innocent.

307
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,921
She didn't do it.

308
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,466
- Oh, she did it, all right.
- I believe her.

309
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,721
- Well, who was that?
- That's Punch, of course.

310
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,349
"Punch, of course"?
I thought he was dead.

311
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,477
He's only pretending,
to teach her a lesson.

312
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:50,066
Only he is dead, Peter.
I saw him. He's not pretending.

313
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,860
Somebody threw him off a train.

314
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:57,282
Charles was mixed up in something terrible.
What am I going to do?

315
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,409
I wish you'd let me help you.

316
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,328
It doesn't sound like the sort of thing
a young woman can handle by herself.

317
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,877
How about making me vice president
in charge of cheering you up?

318
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,090
Starting tonight?

319
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,473
Bonsoir, messieurs, dames.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

320
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,434
Buona sera, signore e signori.

321
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:28,730
Ce soir, comme tous les autres soirs
d'ailleurs, vous savez trĂ¨s bien...

322
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:32,692
qui ici au Black Sheep Club,
I'attraction, c'est vous!

323
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,362
Alors, approchez-vous, messieurs, dames.

324
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,614
Venez ici, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

325
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,409
- What's going on?
- Fun and games.

326
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,203
- Evidently we're the floor show. Come on.
- You and me?

327
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,873
Everyone.

328
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,875
Avanti, avanti,
signore e signori.

329
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,336
Ecoutez-moi bien.
Les rĂ¨gles du jeu sont trĂ¨s simple.

330
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,796
Ah, ecoutez-moi.
Alors, il y a deux Ă©quipes.

331
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,550
There are two teams,
et pour chaque Ă©quipe, il y a une orange.

332
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,471
For every team, there is one orange.
Una arancia.

333
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,891
Eine Apfelsine. Vous mettez I'orange
sur le menton comme Ă§a -

334
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,559
put the orange in like so.

335
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,394
Vous passez cette orange
a la personne derriĂ¨re vous -

336
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,396
You pass the orange
to the person behind you...

337
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,607
mais sans servir les mains.

338
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,651
Without the use of your hands.
Are you ready?

339
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:19,072
Uno, due, tre -

340
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,176
Whoop.

341
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,671
- Mrs. Lampert.
- Who are you?

342
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,674
- Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
- Tell me what?

343
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,302
It doesn't belong to you.
You do know that, don't you?

344
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,263
- I don't know anyth -
- Mrs. Lampert.

345
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,933
Any morning now you could
wake up dead, Mrs. Lampert.

346
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,019
- Leave me alone.
- Dead, Mrs. Lampert.

347
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,354
Like last week's news.
Like Charles, Mrs. Lampert.

348
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,523
Stop it!

349
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,861
- What's the trouble?
- He stepped on my foot.

350
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,155
- Forgive me.
- Wait here. I won't be long.

351
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,491
It was quite unintentional, I'm sure.

352
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,762
Mr. Bartholomew, this is Regina Lampert.

353
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:53,059
Mr. Bartholomew, I just saw one of those m -
Mr. Bartholomew, can you hear me?

354
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,980
Mr. Bartholomew,
this is Regina Lampert. I just -

355
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,072
- Howdy.
- What do you want?

356
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,784
- You must be kiddin'.
- No, I'm not.

357
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,203
Come on now, Miz Lampert.

358
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,540
You know what it is,
and you're gonna get it for me, too.

359
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,751
'Cause you know
I ain't foolin' around here.

360
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,216
No sirree, Bob.

361
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,096
- Stop that, please!
- Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert.

362
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,350
It could get a whole lot worse, you know.

363
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,231
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert,
and you're gonna get it for me...

364
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,360
or your life ain't gonna be worth
the paper it's printed on.

365
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,905
- You "savez" what I'm sayin' to you?
- Stop! Stop! Please stop!

366
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,951
- You go home and think it over
real careful like, you hear?
- You're absolutely insane!

367
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,297
What's the matter?

368
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,716
What are you doing in here?

369
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,344
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

370
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,901
Now hold it. I've waited long enough.
What happened back there?

371
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:30,573
- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
- What does that mean?

372
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:35,411
He said if I told anybody
it could prove fatal for them as well as for me.

373
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,164
- Who said?
- That's what I'm not supposed to say.

374
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,916
Eh -

375
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:45,379
- Now stop that nonsense.
- Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.

376
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,674
- I'm not bullying you.
- Yes, you were. You said it was nonsense.

377
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,886
Being murdered in cold blood
is not nonsense.

378
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,430
Why don't you try it sometime?

379
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,685
- Would you mind seeing me to the door?
- Of course not.

380
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,689
It's a good place for making friends.

381
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:10,446
You said this afternoon your husband
was mixed up in something.

382
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,531
How do you shave in there?

383
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,533
What was it?

384
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,787
- What was what?
- What your husband was mixed up in.

385
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,623
Look, I know it's asking you
to stretch your imagination, but...

386
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,709
don't you think you could pretend
just for a moment that I'm a woman?

387
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:27,838
I could already be arrested for transporting
a minor above the first floor.

388
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,551
- Here you are.
- Where?

389
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,888
- On the street where you live.
- How about once more around the park?

390
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,641
How about getting out of here?
Come on, child. Out.

391
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,979
- Won't you come in for a minute?
- No, I won't.

392
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:49,694
I don't bite, you know,
unless it's called for.

393
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,739
- How would you like a spanking?
- How'd you like a punch in the nose?

394
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:58,744
- Stop treating me like a child.
- Well then, stop behaving like one.

395
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,871
If you want to tell me
what's troubling you, fine.

396
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,499
If not, I'm tired,
it's late and I want to go home to bed.

397
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,502
Oh -

398
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,796
Do you know what's wrong with you?

399
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,340
No. What?

400
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,342
Nothing.

401
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,772
Where is it, lady?

402
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,774
I don't know.

403
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,034
I want it.

404
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,704
You give it to me.

405
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,623
It's mine!

406
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,878
Peter! Peter!

407
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,672
- A man tried to kill me!
- What?

408
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,576
Peter?

409
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,829
Peter, are you all right?

410
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:27,458
Oh, Peter. Are you hurt?

411
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,835
Mm-hmm.
I sprained my pride.

412
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,087
How are you?

413
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,174
- Scared.
- You'll be all right.

414
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,761
- Where did he go?
- Out the window, I guess.

415
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,806
Lock the door,
and don't let anyone in except me.

416
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,476
- And close these windows after me.
- Be careful.

417
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,728
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

418
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,754
Alistair!

419
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,466
- What is it now, Pamela?
- It happened again.

420
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:22,012
Another strange man peered
in the window at me but then went away.

421
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,181
Bad luck, Pamela.

422
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,746
- That was a dumb move, Herman.
- Oh, man. And then some.

423
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,207
If you'd let us known
you was goin' to her room...

424
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,209
we could have done somethin'
to keep him busy.

425
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:55,754
But sneakin' up thataway by yourself.

426
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,215
What did you expect him to do?

427
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:03,262
- Walk up and shake you by that hand of yours?
- A dumb move, Herman. A dumb move.

428
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,932
Yes, it was a dumb move, Herman.
What is the matter with you?

429
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:11,186
- You want some more?
- Never mind that. Did you get the money?

430
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:15,524
How could I with the three Marx Brothers
breathing down my neck?

431
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,193
I thought we had an agreement.

432
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,739
Now, the girl trusts me.

433
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:25,117
If she's got the money, I'll find out about it.
But you just leave me alone.

434
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:30,289
We took all the chances.
The money belongs to us, not to him.

435
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,626
Now, don't be piggy, Herman.

436
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,463
A third of nothing is nothing.
Just think about that.

437
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,925
But make up your mind.
She's waiting for me.

438
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,053
I don't see how another 24 hours
could hurt anything.

439
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,305
Shoot, no.
Not after all these years.

440
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,184
Then he gets it out of your share.

441
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:57,024
Not mine.

442
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,736
Either one of you
got the room next to her?

443
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,738
Yeah, I have. Why?

444
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,616
Give me the key.
Get another room. I want to use it.

445
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,701
Hmm.

446
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,085
If you do find that money...

447
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,171
you ain't gonna forget
to tell your buddies about it, are ya?

448
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:23,550
- Don't worry.
- Oh, no, I ain't worryin'.

449
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,053
You see this little fella here?

450
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,806
Oh, he worries.

451
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,100
And he's even meaner than I am.

452
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,625
- Who is it?
- It's me, Peter.

453
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,437
There was no trace of him.

454
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:21,692
Why don't you confide in me
and tell me what this is all about?

455
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,238
There are three men.
He's one of them.

456
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,825
They think I have a quarter of a million
dollars that belongs to them.

457
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,414
- Go on.
- That's all.

458
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:39,084
- No, it isn't. Where's the money?
- I don't know.

459
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:43,422
They killed Charles to get it,
but he must not have had it with him on the train.

460
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,924
- So they think he left it with you.
- But he didn't.

461
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,261
I've looked everywhere,
and if I don't find it they're going to kill me.

462
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,265
No, they won't.
I won't let them.

463
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,478
Peter, help me.
You're the only one I can trust.

464
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,482
I'll help you.

465
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,609
I told you I would. Come on.

466
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:07,071
Oh, I'm so hungry I could faint.

467
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,698
And I've gotten your suit all wet.

468
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:13,786
That's all right. It's a drip-dry.

469
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,288
Wipe your eyes.

470
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,292
Promise me you'll never lie to me
the way Charles did.

471
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,170
Why do people have to tell lies?

472
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:27,925
Usually it's because they want something.
They're afraid the truth won't get it.

473
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:31,220
Do you tell lies?

474
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,314
- Hello?
- Mrs. Lampert, it's me...

475
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,234
the man who was in your room
a few minutes ago.

476
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,821
- What do you want?
- Who is it?

477
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,115
It's the man you had the fight with.

478
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,284
- Is Dyle with you?
- Who?

479
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,831
The man I had the fight with, lady.
Dyle. That's his name.

480
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,542
What's wrong?
Is he still there?

481
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:10,676
- Yes, that's right.
- What's he saying?

482
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,847
Don't trust him.
Don't tell him anything.

483
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,141
He's after the money.

484
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,276
What was all that about?

485
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,696
He -

486
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,825
- He said if I don't give him the money he'll kill me.
- Oh, don't take it seriously.

487
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,912
He's just trying to frighten you.

488
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:42,332
- I believe what he said.
- No, no. It's just a lot of words.

489
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,751
Words can hurt.

490
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,712
I know.

491
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,756
Try to get some sleep.
You'll feel better.

492
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:54,386
Don't worry. I've arranged
to take the room next door to you.

493
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:58,640
So you'll be all right.

494
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,059
If you want anything,
just bang on the wall.

495
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,729
Better lock the door after me.

496
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,565
Good night.

497
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:38,263
But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew.
What I'm trying to say is that -

498
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:40,224
is that there's someone else.

499
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,352
- What?
- Someone who wasn't in that photograph
you showed me today.

500
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,855
He says his name is Peter Joshua,
but it isn't. It's Dyle.

501
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,194
- Are you still there, Mr. Bartholomew?
- Yes, yes, Mrs. Lampert.

502
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,155
Uh, I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is...

503
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,283
but it's possible we were wrong
about who killed your husband.

504
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:01,578
You mean... he might have?

505
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,123
Mr. Bartholomew,
I'm catching the next plane out of here.

506
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,293
I'm not going to sit around for somebody
to make chopped liver out of me.

507
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:11,672
Now, take it easy, Mrs. Lampert.
Take it easy.

508
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,675
Uh, where are you now?
Can you meet me at the market?

509
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,761
- At Les Halles?
- Yes. Opposite Saint-Eustache.

510
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,556
- I'll meet you there in 15 minutes.
- All right. I'll be there in 15 minutes.

511
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,773
Allez vite, n'importe oĂą.
N'importe oĂą! Vite!

512
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,617
Suivez ce taxi.

513
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:32,169
- Were you followed?
- Yes, by Dyle. But I lost him.

514
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,713
I'm beginning to think
women make the best spies.

515
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,715
Agents.

516
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,926
- He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew.
- No.

517
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,221
- But I saw it.
- No, that's not Carson Dyle.

518
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:46,892
- Carson?
- There's only one Dyle connected
with this affair, Mrs. Lampert.

519
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,894
That's Carson Dyle.

520
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,146
You mean you've known
about him all along?

521
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,858
It's enough to make you
a vegetarian, isn't it?

522
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:59,780
It's just lucky I'm not hanging
next to one of those things right now.

523
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,742
Why didn't you tell me
you knew about Dyle?

524
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,994
I didn't see any point.
Dyle's dead.

525
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,499
Mr. Bartholomew,
what is all this about?

526
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:15,545
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -

527
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,923
the military espionage unit -

528
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,175
were ordered behind the German lines...

529
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:25,680
for the purpose of delivering
$250,000 in gold...

530
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,225
to the French underground.

531
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,685
The five men were, of course,
your husband Charles...

532
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,438
the three men who showed up
at his funeral yesterday...

533
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:35,816
and Carson Dyle.

534
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,153
- Oh.
- But instead of delivering the gold, they stole it.

535
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,697
- How?
- By burying it...

536
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:45,575
then reporting
the Germans had captured it.

537
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,953
All they had to do was
come back after the war...

538
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,622
dig it up and split it five ways.

539
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:55,085
Quarter of a million dollars
with no questions asked.

540
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,462
May I have a cigarette, please?

541
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,632
I can't stand those things.

542
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,635
It's like drinking coffee through a veil.

543
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,931
Everything went smoothly enough
until after the gold was buried.

544
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:12,227
Before they could get out,
they were ambushed by a German patrol.

545
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,730
A machine gun separated
Scobie from his right hand...

546
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,817
and caught Carson Dyle
full in the stomach.

547
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,656
What was wrong with that one?

548
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,576
Nothing, I guess.
What happened then?

549
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,705
- Have you any idea what these
things cost over here?
- Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew.

550
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,748
What happened then?

551
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:41,339
Carson Dyle was dead,
but Scobie was able to travel. So -

552
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:44,384
- La soupe, c'est pour qui?
- Pour moi.

553
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,854
Where was I?

554
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,356
- Carson Dyle was dead.
- Yes. Carson Dyle was dead.

555
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,568
The others finally got back to the base
and waited for the war to end...

556
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,488
only Charles couldn't wait
quite as long as the others.

557
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:08,325
He beat them back to the gold,
took everything for himself and disappeared.

558
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,204
It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time
to catch up with him again.

559
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:16,208
But if they stole all that money,
why can't you arrest them?

560
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,668
Shh.

561
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:22,797
We know what happened from the bits and pieces
we were able to paste together...

562
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,091
but we still have no proof.

563
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,802
What's this got to do with the C.I.O.?

564
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,768
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert.

565
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,230
It's an extension of the wartime O.S.S.

566
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,357
It's our money, and we want it back.

567
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:44,236
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew,
but nothing you've said has changed my mind.

568
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,446
I'm leaving Paris tonight.

569
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,158
Wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.

570
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:53,578
Better consider what happened
to your husband when he tried to leave.

571
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:56,331
Those men won't be very far away
no matter where you go.

572
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,292
In fact, I don't even see any point
in your changing hotels.

573
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,087
Now, please help us, Mrs. Lampert.

574
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,756
Your government is counting on you.

575
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,262
Well, if I'm going to die,
I might as well do it for my country.

576
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:13,598
That's the spirit.
Here's what I want you to do.

577
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:17,269
We're anxious to know who this man is -
the one calling himself Dyle.

578
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,229
I want you to find out.

579
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,606
Why me?

580
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:24,359
You're in an ideal position.
He trusts you.

581
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:29,906
Besides, you yourself said
women make the best spies.

582
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,617
Agents.

583
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,381
Oh, pardon.

584
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:13,158
- FrĂ¤ulein. FrĂ¤ulein.
- What are you doing following me?

585
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:17,245
It's gonna look like a parade. Stop it.

586
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,920
How are you? Nice to see you.
When did you arrive?

587
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,174
It's a lovely town. Are you having a good time?
So many things to see.

588
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,973
FrĂ¤ulein.

589
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,975
FrĂ¤ulein!

590
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,770
If you don't stop following me,
I'll call the police.

591
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,690
Taxi!

592
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,924
Dyle, pIease. D-Y-L-E.

593
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,009
Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

594
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,893
- No, I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle. Nothing today.
- Thank you.

595
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,230
Mr. Dyle, pIease.
You're wanted on the telephone.

596
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,357
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four.

597
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,776
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four, pIease.

598
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:41,246
- Yes?
- Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

599
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,750
- Reggie?
- It's the only name I've got. How about you?

600
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:48,336
No cat and mouse. You've got me.
What do you want to know?

601
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:50,588
Why you lied to me.

602
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,675
I had to. For all I knew,
you were in on the whole thing.

603
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,429
- I'm trying to find out who you are.
- You know my name. It's Dyle.

604
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,431
Carson Dyle is dead.

605
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,891
Yes, he is.
He was my brother.

606
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,270
Your brother?

607
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:08,440
The army thinks he was
killed in action by the Germans...

608
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:12,610
but I think they did it -
Tex, Gideon, Scobie and your husband -

609
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:16,114
because my brother wouldn't
go along with their scheme to steal the gold.

610
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,450
I think he threatened
to turn them in and they killed him.

611
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:23,580
I'm trying to prove it. They think
I'm working with them, but I'm not, Reggie.

612
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,790
I'm on your side.
Just believe that.

613
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,835
How can I? You lied to me
just the way Charles did.

614
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,837
After promising you wouldn't.

615
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,465
Oh, I want to believe you, Peter -

616
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:35,467
I can't call you that anymore, can I?

617
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,512
Take me a while to get used to
your new name. What is it?

618
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,557
Hmm? Hello?

619
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,060
Hello?

620
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,993
Do anything funny or try to
talk to anyone and I'll kill you, Dyle.

621
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,287
You'll wreck your raincoat.

622
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,290
Take the next car, please.

623
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,228
Look out.
Didn't want you to bump your head.

624
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,774
All right, get in there.

625
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,452
All right, turn around.

626
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,797
Now sit down.

627
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:10,603
- Now what?
- We wait. With our mouth shut.

628
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,489
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

629
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:35,461
Okay. Up there.

630
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,432
- Do I knock or something?
- No, open it...

631
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,976
and keep right on goin'.

632
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,604
The view had better be worth it.

633
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,745
Very pretty. Now what?

634
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,875
I was afraid of that.

635
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:22,717
I'll give you a chance, Dyle,
which is more than you'd give me.

636
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,762
Where's the money?

637
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:31,100
Is that why you dragged me all the way
up here? To ask me that?

638
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:35,313
- She has it.
- And I say maybe you both have it.

639
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:39,859
One more time, Dyle.
Where is it?

640
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:44,322
Supposing I had it -
which I don't -

641
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,742
do you really think
I'd just hand it over to you?

642
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,622
Step back.

643
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,502
Back where?

644
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:00,296
That's the idea.

645
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:05,259
Hmm. Now - Now, just a minute.
Take it easy.

646
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:54,494
- Herman?
- What?

647
00:56:56,872 --> 00:57:00,291
- How you doing?
- How do you think?

648
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:05,338
If you get bored, try writing "Love thy neighbor"
100 times on the side of the building.

649
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:21,145
Monsieur, next time, please,
use the keyhole, hmm?

650
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,243
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

651
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:40,039
- You gonna open up?
- Sure. Wait a minute.

652
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:44,377
Don't you know it's impolite
to leave someone holding... the phone?

653
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,379
What happened?

654
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,881
Oh, I met a man with sharp nails.

655
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,052
- Scobie?
- Mm-hmm.

656
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:56,848
I left him hanging around
the American Express.

657
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:59,851
Come in. I've got something
that stings like crazy.

658
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,854
You're the kind of girl
that'd have something like that.

659
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,856
Sit down.

660
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,858
Uh, w-w-wait a minute.

661
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,860
- W-W-What is that stuff?
- Marvelous stuff.

662
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:11,863
- Gonna hurt you much more
than it's gonna hurt me.
- I'll bet -

663
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,365
Oh! Did you hear something rip?

664
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,993
- No.
- Oh. That's odd.

665
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,998
Listen, I-I only came in for an estimate.

666
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,500
Sit still. It's not too bad.

667
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,420
You won't be able to
lie on your back for a few days.

668
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,423
- But then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
- Oh-ho-ho -

669
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,425
- Ooh!
- Does it hurt?

670
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,427
- What?
- Does it hurt?

671
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,429
Oh. Are you kidding?

672
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,390
Have you got a bullet I could bite,
like they do in the movies?

673
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,351
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

674
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,812
Would you like to see my passport?

675
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:47,440
Passport?
What kind of a proof is that?

676
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,693
- Well, would you like to see where I was tattooed?
- Yes.

677
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,196
All right.
We'll drive around that way.

678
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:59,202
You could at least tell me
what your first name is these days.

679
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:02,038
Alexander.

680
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,040
Okay, Alexander.

681
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,042
- You're done.
- Good.

682
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,544
You're a new man.

683
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:11,547
I'm sorry the old one
couldn't tell you the truth...

684
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:15,092
but I had to find out
your part in all this.

685
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,094
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

686
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,096
Yes.

687
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,557
But we're divorced.

688
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:23,768
I thought that was Peter Joshua.

689
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:26,729
I'm just as difficult
to Iive with as he was.

690
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,983
Alex, how can you tell
if anyone's lying or not?

691
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,528
- You can't.
- There must be some way.

692
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,531
There's an old riddle about
two tribes of Indians.

693
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:40,660
The Whitefeet always tell the truth,
and the Blackfeet always lie.

694
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,662
One day you meet an Indian.
You say...

695
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:46,666
"Hey, Indian, what are you,
a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot?"

696
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,835
He says, "I'm a truthful Whitefoot."
But which is he?

697
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,715
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?

698
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,592
Because he's wearing moccasins.

699
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:59,095
Well, then, he's a truthful Whitefoot,
of course.

700
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,846
Why not a lying Blackfoot?

701
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:06,018
- Which one are you?
- A truthful Whitefoot.

702
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,814
Come in.

703
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:12,316
- Sit down.
- Why? Do you wanna look at my feet?

704
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,610
Yes.

705
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:19,615
Uh-oh. Ohh. Hey, knock it off.
Come on, Reggie. Listen to me.

706
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,617
Here it comes, the fatherly talk.

707
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:24,829
- You forget I'm already a widow.
- So was Juliet, at 15.

708
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:28,165
- But I'm not 15.
- Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me.

709
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,502
- Can't you be serious?
- Oh! You just said an horrible word.

710
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,005
- What did I say?
- Serious.

711
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:37,550
When I man gets to be my age,
that's the last word he ever wants to hear.

712
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,595
I don't want to be serious,
and I especially don't want you to be.

713
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,100
Okay, we'll just sit around all day long
being frivolous. How about that, hmm?

714
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,644
Reggie, cut it out.

715
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,647
Okay.

716
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,191
- Now what are you doing?
- Cutting it out.

717
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,610
- Who told you to do that?
- You did.

718
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,779
I'm not through complaining yet.

719
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,781
Oh.

720
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:06,954
- Now cut it out.
- Alex, I think I love you.

721
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,544
Hey, the telephone's ringing.

722
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,546
Never mind.

723
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,549
Whoever it is won't give up,
and neither will I.

724
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,551
Just a minute.
Go on, take it.

725
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:25,097
Hello.

726
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:28,351
I'm sorry, uh -
I was just, uh -

727
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,353
nibbling on something.

728
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,355
Say, I'd appreciate it mighty highly...

729
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:36,359
if you'd, uh, wiggle on over to Room 46
and chew the fat for a spell.

730
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,694
Could you give me
one good reason why I should?

731
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:43,366
Yeah. A little one, about six or seven.

732
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,659
Keeps callin' for Aunt Reggie.

733
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:48,371
Ain't that cute?

734
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,831
They've got Jean-Louis.

735
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,668
I'll be right there.

736
01:01:57,089 --> 01:02:01,008
Hey, Tex, do somethin' with this kid, will ya?
My leg's goin' to sleep.

737
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:03,677
Upsy-daisy.

738
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,679
Are you a real cowboy?

739
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,681
Yeah, sure I am, kid.

740
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:09,683
So where's your gun?

741
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,773
Will you put that thing away!

742
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,775
Jean-Louis.

743
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,860
Howdy, Miz Lampert.

744
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,863
Who invited him?

745
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:25,282
Well, Herman, I see
you had a happy landing.

746
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,284
I must call Sylvie right away.

747
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:30,287
- I'm afraid that'll have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
- It's his mother.

748
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:33,541
She won't be anybody's mother
unless you answer some questions.

749
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,710
- This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
- We want that money now.

750
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:40,131
Why don't you keep quiet and
stop threatening the child.

751
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:43,843
He hasn't got the money,
and neither has Mrs. Lampert.

752
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,219
Then who does?

753
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,305
I don't know, Herman.
Maybe you do.

754
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,099
Me?

755
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:53,018
- Or you.
- Ohh.

756
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:56,313
- Or him.
- Why, that's the most ridiculous thing I ever -

757
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,316
- Listen to this man.
- Man's gone loco.

758
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:04,113
Now hoId it. Suppose one of you
found Charles here in Paris.

759
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,115
Even bumped into him by accident...

760
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,743
followed him when he tried to run out again,
cornered him on the train...

761
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:12,705
threw him out the window and,
without bothering to tell the other two...

762
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,748
took all the money for yourself.

763
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:18,294
If one of us did that, he wouldn't hang around
waiting for the other two to figure it out.

764
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:22,256
But he'd have to. Don't you see?
If he left, he'd be admitting his guilt.

765
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,301
Whoever it is has to wait here
pretending to look for the money...

766
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,512
waiting for the rest of us
to give up and go home.

767
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:31,849
He's just tryin' to throw us off.
They got it, I tell ya.

768
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,351
Why don't we search their rooms?

769
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,354
That's all right with us.

770
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:40,858
Then what are we wastin' time for?
Let's go.

771
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,777
- While we're waiting, we'll search yours.
- Not my room.

772
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:47,823
Well, Herman.
You have something to hide?

773
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,203
Then there are no objections.

774
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:54,205
All right, here's my key.

775
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,957
- I'll take that.
- My room's open.

776
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:58,959
Everyone. Whoa.
Come on.

777
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:04,131
Now, you two
just make yourselves to home here.

778
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,885
Well, let's get busy.

779
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,388
Come on, Jean-Louis.
Come along. Oh, that's fine.

780
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:14,391
- Who gets your vote?
- Scobie. He's the one who objected.

781
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:17,394
All right,
I'll take Tex's room here and Gideon's.

782
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,564
You take Jean-Louis with you,
and bolt the door from inside.

783
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:23,317
Come on, Jean-Louis.
We'll have a treasure hunt.

784
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:27,863
Tex?

785
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:32,409
Man, that's Charlie's stuff.

786
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,411
Looks like it.

787
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,914
- Think we ought to call Herman?
- What for?

788
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,917
If it's not here,
why bother him?

789
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,044
And if it is?

790
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,171
Why bother him?

791
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:50,094
Oh.

792
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:53,097
- What?
- Sure there's nothing missing here?

793
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:57,309
No, everything's here.
The police have kindly provided us with a list.

794
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,772
Sure ain't nothin' here
worth no quarter of a million dollars.

795
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,774
Not unless we're blind.

796
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:07,111
I keep telling myself
we've stolen a great deal of money...

797
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:10,114
but up to now I've yet
to see a penny of it.

798
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:13,200
You think maybe we're fishin'
up the wrong stream?

799
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,453
Meaning what?

800
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:20,332
Suppose one of us has it.
You know, like the man says.

801
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,626
Now, that'd be mighty distasteful...

802
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:25,629
us bein' veterans
of the same war and all.

803
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:30,467
Well, you know I'd tell you if I had it.

804
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:33,679
Oh, naturally.
Just like I'd tell you if I had it.

805
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,681
Naturally.

806
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,017
And that goes for Herman, too.

807
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,227
Naturally.

808
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:46,567
He's all right, Sylvie. Honestly.

809
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,737
Just hurry over as soon as you can.
Okay. Good-bye.

810
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:55,159
Now, if you had a treasure,
where would you hide it?

811
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,329
I would bury it in the garden.

812
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,332
Swell, but this man
doesn't have a garden.

813
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,834
- Oh, neither do I.
- You don't?

814
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:08,005
Well, if you had to hide it in this room,
where would you put it?

815
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,841
- Up there.
- On top of that cupboard?

816
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:14,428
You know something?
You may be right.

817
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:22,144
Oh, I hope I don't find
any hairy little things living up here.

818
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,898
Hey, there is something.
And it's heavy.

819
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,359
I found it!
I found it! I found it!

820
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:31,695
If you think you're getting credit for this,
you're crazy.

821
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,864
We won!
We won! We won!

822
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:37,076
We won! We won!
We won! We won!

823
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,537
We found it!
We found it!

824
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:42,539
- Did you find it?
- No.

825
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:45,542
- What do you mean, no?
- The kid was yellin'.

826
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:48,003
Up there.
It's up there.

827
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:50,798
Believe me,
there's nothing up there.

828
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,800
Yeah?

829
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,179
Oh!

830
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:12,152
Oh! Jumpin' frijoles.

831
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,987
It's Herman's spare.

832
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:20,119
- Where is he?
- He's over in my room.

833
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:40,681
You'd better take the boy
out in the hall.

834
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:52,735
Oh, now, who would've done
a mean thing like that?

835
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,238
I'm not quite sure.

836
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,449
Well, this ain't my room.

837
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,492
Mine neither.

838
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,787
Oh, the police aren't going to like this a bit.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

839
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:07,875
We could dry him off and take him
down the hall to his own room.

840
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,335
He really doesn't look too bad.

841
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,463
Oh, poor old Herman.

842
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:16,717
Seems like him and good luck
always was strangers.

843
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:20,721
Well, maybe now he'll meet up with
his other hand someplace.

844
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:31,565
A man drowned in his bed?

845
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,567
Impossible.

846
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,195
And in his pajamas -
the second one in his pajamas.

847
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,238
C'est trop stupide.

848
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,199
Stop lying to me.

849
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,243
This nose tells me when you are lying.

850
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:46,538
It is never mistaken,
not in 23 years.

851
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:49,666
This nose will make me
commissaire of police.

852
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:53,796
Mr. Dyle, or Mr. Joshua -
Which is it?

853
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,798
Dyle.

854
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:59,092
And yet you registered
in MegĂ¨ve as Mr. Joshua.

855
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:03,096
Didn't you know it was against the law
to register under an assumed name?

856
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:07,142
- No, I didn't.
- It's done in America all the time.

857
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,479
None of you will be
permitted to leave Paris...

858
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,648
until this matter is cleared up.

859
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,235
Only I warn you,
I will be watching.

860
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,364
We use the guillotine in this country.

861
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:23,909
I have always suspected
that the blade coming down...

862
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:27,454
causes no more than
a slight tickling sensation...

863
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,957
on the back of the neck.

864
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,959
It is only a guess, of course.

865
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:35,295
I hope none of you ever
finds out for certain.

866
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,179
Who do you think did it?

867
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:47,391
- Gideon?
- Possibly.

868
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:50,060
- Or Tex?
- Possibly.

869
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,062
- You're a fat lot of help.
- That's right.

870
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,064
- Can I have one of those?
- One of what?

871
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,066
- I think Tex did it.
- Oh.

872
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,069
- Vanille et chocolat, s'il vous plait.
- Why do you think Tex did it?

873
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,071
Because I really suspect Gideon...

874
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,615
and it's always the person
you don't suspect.

875
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,160
Do women think it feminine to be so illogical,
or can't they help it?

876
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:09,162
What's so illogical about that?

877
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,165
You just said it's always
the one you don't suspect.

878
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,585
You suspect Gideon,
therefore it must be Tex.

879
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:18,797
On the other hand, if you suspect Tex
it must be the other fella, Gideon.

880
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,008
- I guess they just can't help it.
- Hmm?

881
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:23,010
- Who?
- Women.

882
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:25,012
Oh.

883
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,848
You know, I can't help
feeling rather sorry for Scobie.

884
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:31,351
Wouldn't it be nice
if we were like that?

885
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,353
- What, like Scobie?
- No. Gene Kelly.

886
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:36,356
Remember when he danced down here
by the river in An American in Paris...

887
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,358
without a care in the world?

888
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:41,278
- Hmm.
- You know, this is good. Want some?

889
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:44,239
- Uh -
- Oh!

890
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:46,241
No, thanks.

891
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:49,953
I guess you don't either. Here, give me that.

892
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:52,080
I'm sorry.

893
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:55,042
Alex, I'm scared.

894
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:57,169
Yes, I know.

895
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,088
I can't think of any reason
why he was killed.

896
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:03,383
Well, perhaps someone thought
that four shares were too many.

897
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:07,137
What makes you think that this someone
is going to be satisfied with three?

898
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:11,975
- He wants it all. That means we're in his way, too.
- That's right.

899
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:16,271
We've got to do something. I mean,
any minute now we could be assassinated.

900
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:18,273
Would you do anything like that?

901
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:21,026
What, assassinate someone?

902
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,820
No. Swing down from there
on a rope to save the woman you love.

903
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,864
Like the hunchback of Notre Dame.

904
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,824
Uh - Huh?

905
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,869
Who put that there?

906
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:38,126
- Hurry up and change. I'm starved.
- Let me know what you want to eat...

907
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,170
so I can pick out a suit that matches.

908
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:42,255
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

909
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,391
Uh-uh.

910
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,850
What do you want?

911
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:57,104
It's the house detective.
Why don't you have a girl in there?

912
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:59,106
God, you're a pest.

913
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:02,567
- Can I come in?
- No. I'm going to take a bath.

914
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,529
Wouldn't it be better
if you did it in here?

915
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:09,032
- What for?
- Well, I wouldn't want to use that tub.

916
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:12,119
Anyway, I don't want to be alone.
I'm afraid.

917
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,454
You're only next door.
If anything happens, holler.

918
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,921
Reggie?

919
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:24,840
Got you. Ha, ha.

920
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,760
Did you ever hear the story
of the boy who cried wolf?

921
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,096
The shower's in there.

922
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,725
- Oh, come on, open the door.
- This is a ludicrous situation.

923
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:38,228
I can think of a dozen men
who are just longing to use my shower.

924
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:41,690
- Why don't you call one of them?
- I dare you.

925
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,192
Oh, you're a nut.

926
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:49,740
- What are you doing?
- Taking off my shoes.

927
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:53,243
Did you ever hear of anyone
taking a shower with their shoes on?

928
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:59,249
I usually sing a medley of old favorites
when I'm in the shower.

929
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,169
- Any requests?
- Shut the door.

930
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:06,381
I'm afraid I don't know that one, miss.
Well -

931
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,508
- Shut the door.
- Why?

932
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,510
Come in and watch.

933
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:24,524
Drip-dry.

934
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:28,445
How often do you go through
this little ritual?

935
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,239
Oh, every day.
The manufacturer recommends it.

936
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:33,158
I don't believe it.

937
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,535
Oh, yes, it's -
Wait a minute.

938
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,081
Here's the label.

939
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,083
Look at the small print.

940
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,377
"Wearing this suit during washing...

941
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:46,838
helps protect its shape."

942
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,469
Whoo!

943
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:56,431
Waterproof.

944
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,896
Wait.

945
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,690
Acro-nylon.
Fibrous resistant.

946
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:09,694
Plastic. Rustproof. Fireproof. Proof-proof.

947
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,696
- You're the nut.
- Nut-proof.

948
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:20,455
- Yes?
- Mrs. Lampert? Bartholomew.

949
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,624
I spoke to Washington, Mrs. Lampert.

950
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,210
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew.
I'm listening.

951
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:29,965
Well, I told them what you said
about this man being Carson Dyle's brother.

952
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:33,218
I asked them what they knew about it,
and they told me.

953
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,470
You're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert.

954
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:38,140
Carson Dyle had no brother.

955
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,978
- Mrs. Lampert?
- Are you sure there's no mistake?

956
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:46,398
None whatsoever.
Please be careful, Mrs. Lampert.

957
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,400
Bye.

958
01:14:57,285 --> 01:15:00,328
I left all my drip-dry dripping.
Is that all right?

959
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:02,455
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

960
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,542
You're probably weak from hunger.

961
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,544
You've only eaten five times today.

962
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:11,423
I'll get someone to fix up my suit quickly
and take you out to dinner.

963
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,134
Let's go somewhere crowded.
I feel like a lot of people.

964
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,980
Hey, you know, this thing is still damp.

965
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:34,154
You haven't spoken a word for 20 minutes.

966
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,449
I was thinking about Charles and Scobie
and who's going to be next.

967
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,451
Me?

968
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,454
I don't suppose you know
who the murderer is, do you?

969
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,456
No. Not yet.

970
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,960
Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty much
have sewn up the nomination, don't you think?

971
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:52,422
What are you trying to say,
that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?

972
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,383
What do I have to do to satisfy you?
Become the next victim?

973
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:58,386
- It's a start, anyway.
- Oh.

974
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,388
I can't understand you at all.

975
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,599
One minute you're chasing me
around the shower room.

976
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,684
The next minute you're
accusing me of murder.

977
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:08,063
Carson Dyle had no brother.

978
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:15,153
Oh, I can explain that,
if you'll just listen.

979
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:18,657
Well, I can't very well leave
without a pair of water wings, can I?

980
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:22,285
- All right, get set for the story of my life.
- Fiction or nonfiction?

981
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:25,664
- Eh - Why don't you shut up?
- Well!

982
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:28,458
- Are you going to listen?
- Go on.

983
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,460
All right.

984
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:34,965
Now, when I was a young man,
my father expected me to go into his business.

985
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:37,968
Umbrella frames.
That's what he made.

986
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:42,138
A sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't
have the sense in those days to be sensible.

987
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:44,724
I suppose all this is leading somewhere.

988
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:47,978
Well, it led me away from umbrella frames,
for one thing.

989
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,981
But that left me without
any honest means of support.

990
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,983
What do you mean?

991
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,985
Well, in this highly competitive world...

992
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,321
when a man has no profession,
there isn't much choice...

993
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:01,992
so I began looking for people
who had more money than they needed...

994
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:04,202
including some they'd barely miss.

995
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:06,371
You mean you're a thief?

996
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:09,833
Well, that's not exactly
the term I'd have chosen...

997
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:13,628
but it sort of captures
the spirit of the thing.

998
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,923
I don't believe it.

999
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:19,551
I can't really blame you now.

1000
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,512
But I do believe it.
That's what I don't believe.

1001
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:25,932
So it's good-bye, Alexander Dyle,
welcome home, Peter Joshua.

1002
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,185
Sorry. The name's Adam Canfield.

1003
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:32,856
- Adam Canfield?
- Mm-hmm.

1004
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:36,901
Wonderful. Do you realize you've had
three names in the past two days?

1005
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,654
I don't even know
who I'm talking to anymore.

1006
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:42,949
- Well, the man's the same, even if the name isn't.
- No, he isn't.

1007
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:46,286
- Adam Canfield is a crook, and I want to know why.
- Well, it's simple.

1008
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,788
I like what I do. I enjoy my work.

1009
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,541
There aren't many men
who love their work as much as I do.

1010
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,044
You look around sometime.

1011
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,629
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

1012
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,383
- Yes, but we're divorced.
- "But we're divorced."

1013
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:03,887
- That's right. Now go and eat your dinner.
- Oh, I could eat a horse.

1014
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:05,889
I think that's what you ordered.

1015
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:09,392
Don't you dare be civil with me
after leading me on like this.

1016
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:12,896
- How did I lead you on?
- Oh, all that marvelous rejection.

1017
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,898
You knew I couldn't resist it.

1018
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:18,151
- Now it turns out all you're
interested in is the money.
- That's right.

1019
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,154
- Oh.
- Well, what would you like me to say?

1020
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,574
That a pretty girl with an outrageous manner
means more to an old pro like me...

1021
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:26,576
than a quarter of a million dollars?

1022
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:30,205
- I don't suppose so.
- It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.

1023
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,457
Hmm.

1024
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,918
- What?
- Hasn't it occurred to you...

1025
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:38,046
that I'm having a tough time
keeping my hands off you?

1026
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:46,054
- Oh, you should see your face.
- What's the matter with it?

1027
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,806
It's lovely.

1028
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,808
Ohh.

1029
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,520
Now what's the trouble?

1030
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:56,815
I'm not hungry anymore.
Isn't it glorious?

1031
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,819
- Adam!
- It's all right. Come and look.

1032
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:06,991
â™Ş For her Romeo came â™Ş

1033
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:10,286
â™Ş And â™Ş

1034
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:15,083
â™Ş It was closing night â™Ş

1035
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:18,711
â™Ş The ending of â™Ş

1036
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:21,714
You don't look so bad in this light.

1037
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:24,217
Why do you think I brought you here?

1038
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:26,636
Maybe you wanted me
to see the kind of work...

1039
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,638
the competition was turning out.

1040
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,640
Pretty good, huh?

1041
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:33,643
I taught them everything they do.

1042
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:37,939
Oh, did they do that kind of thing
way back in your day?

1043
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,942
Sure. How do you think I got here?

1044
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:44,154
â™Ş I hear it still â™Ş

1045
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:46,739
â™Ş I always will â™Ş

1046
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:49,159
- Not allowed to kiss back, huh?
- Oh, no.

1047
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:52,662
Doctor said it was bad
for my thermostat. Mm-hmm.

1048
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:09,637
Well, when you come on,
you come on, don't you?

1049
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,931
Well, come on.

1050
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,658
Yeah.

1051
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:33,328
Hmm?

1052
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,330
In the lobby?

1053
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:43,171
Are you out of your mind or something?
It's 3:30 in the morning.

1054
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:46,841
You mean it?

1055
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:52,805
All right. All right, I'll be right down.
Wait a minute.

1056
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:33,429
H - H-Hey, turn on the lights!

1057
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,523
Hey, how do you stop this thing?

1058
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:06,462
Three of them, all in their pajamas?
C'est ridicule.

1059
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:08,965
What is it, some new American fad?

1060
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:12,719
And now your friend who lives here,
uh, the one from Texas...

1061
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,971
he has disappeared into thin air.

1062
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:17,849
- Where is he?
- I wish I knew.

1063
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,059
Madame?

1064
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,523
Tell me, Mr. Dyle.
Where were you at 3:30 a.m.?

1065
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:27,984
In my room, asleep.

1066
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,403
- And you, Mrs. Lampert?
- I was, too.

1067
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,739
In Mr. Dyle's room?

1068
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,741
No, in my room.

1069
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:38,328
Obviously you're telling the truth...

1070
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:41,664
for why would you invent
such a ridiculous story?

1071
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:46,628
And if I were you,
I wouldn't stay in my pajamas.

1072
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,713
Good night.

1073
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:53,509
Well, that wraps it up.
Tex has the money.

1074
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:57,555
- Go to bed. I'll let you know when I've found him.
- You're gonna go looking for him now?

1075
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,392
If the police find him first, they're not going to
turn over that quarter of a million to us.

1076
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:04,270
- Oh, Adam -
- Go to bed and bolt your door.

1077
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,489
- Yeah?
- Now you listen to me, Dyle.

1078
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:17,867
I know who's got that money, man,
and I want my share.

1079
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:22,622
Seems to be growin' and growin' every day.
Well, I ain't disappearin' till I get it.

1080
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:25,041
- Where are you, Tex?
- Come on, man.

1081
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,670
Look, my mama didn't raise
no stupid children.

1082
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,672
I'll tell you what.

1083
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,674
You wanna find me...

1084
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:34,676
you just look over your shoulder...

1085
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,679
'cause from now on
I'm gonna be right behind you.

1086
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,982
Open up.

1087
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:58,658
- I think I was wrong about Tex having the money.
- Why?

1088
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,160
I just heard from him.
He's still hungry.

1089
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:04,330
That means killing Gideon
didn't get it for him.

1090
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:07,917
So he's narrowed it down to us.
You've got it.

1091
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,461
But I've looked everywhere.
You know I have.

1092
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:12,422
Where's the airlines bag?

1093
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:15,049
- In the wardrobe.
- Get it.

1094
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:17,051
Lord, you're obstinate.

1095
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:20,221
Charles must have had it with him
on the train when Tex killed him.

1096
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:22,223
Thanks.

1097
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:26,728
Everybody and his Aunt Lillian's
been through that bag...

1098
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,730
including me.

1099
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:31,733
- Okay, we'll do it again.
- I've been into it at least once a day.

1100
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:33,735
Somebody would have seen it.

1101
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:39,115
It's there, Reggie.
We're looking at it right now.

1102
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,784
Something on that bed is worth
a quarter of a million dollars.

1103
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:45,371
- But what?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1104
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:47,832
Four passports. No.

1105
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:51,878
Steamship ticket.

1106
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,673
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.

1107
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:57,592
Wallet.

1108
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:01,095
Comb? No.

1109
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:04,098
A fountain pen.

1110
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,145
What about that key?

1111
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,147
To the apartment.
Matches mine exactly.

1112
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:13,191
Oh.

1113
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:17,111
I bet you don't
really need those.

1114
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,406
You need them.

1115
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:28,247
This still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth
a quarter of a million dollars either.

1116
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:32,502
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1117
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:34,796
- The tooth powder.
- What about it?

1118
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,632
Could you recognize heroin
just by the taste of it?

1119
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,431
Heroin.

1120
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:47,642
- Peppermint-flavored heroin.
- Hmm.

1121
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:51,187
Well, I guess that's it.

1122
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,189
Dead end.

1123
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:56,692
Well, go to bed.
You've gotta go to work in the morning.

1124
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:59,153
There's nothing more we can do tonight.

1125
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:01,489
I love you, Adam.

1126
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,909
Yes, you told me.

1127
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,579
No. The last time I said,
"I love you, Alex."

1128
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:12,792
Oh.

1129
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:27,098
- Hold it. They're recognizing Great Britain.
- Oh, la vache.

1130
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,308
Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates...

1131
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:31,978
and my distinguished colleague from Italy.

1132
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:36,274
Her Majesty's delegation has listened with
great patience to the Southern European -

1133
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:38,734
- Oh, are you on?
- No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?

1134
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:40,736
Nothing. I think I've found something.

1135
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:43,739
I was snooping around Tex's room
and came across this in the wastebasket.

1136
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:45,741
I stuck it together again.

1137
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:48,244
That's the receipt Grandpierre gave me
for Charles's things.

1138
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:50,746
- I don't see how that's going to -
- You're not looking.

1139
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:54,417
When we went through the airlines bag,
something was missing - "un agenda. "

1140
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,254
That's an appointment book, isn't it?
It wasn't there.

1141
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,256
That's right.

1142
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,258
I remember Grandpierre
looking through it...

1143
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:05,136
but there was nothing in it
the police thought was very important.

1144
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,263
Can you remember anything in it at all?

1145
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:10,766
Well, it did say something
about Charles's last appointment.

1146
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,768
With whom? Where?

1147
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:15,771
- I think it only said where.
- Come on, Reggie, think.

1148
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:17,773
This may be what we're looking for.

1149
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:20,776
Adam, that money doesn't belong to us.

1150
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,779
- If we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
- Nonsense. We didn't steal it.

1151
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:26,616
- There's no law against stealing stolen money.
- Of course there is.

1152
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:27,909
- There is?
- Yes.

1153
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,202
When did they pass such a silly law?
Think, Reggie.

1154
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:34,123
- What was in that appointment book?
- Oh, it was a place or street corner or something.

1155
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:36,125
Watch it. I'm on.

1156
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:53,100
Of - Of the Western
Hemisphere conference -

1157
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,812
Of the Western Hemisphere conference...

1158
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:58,814
held on March 22 -

1159
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:01,692
No, wait!
It was last Thursday, 5:00...

1160
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:04,111
the Jardins des Champs-Ă‰lysĂ©es.

1161
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:06,113
That's it, Adam! The gardens!

1162
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:09,450
Well, it's Thursday today,
and it's almost 5:00, so come on.

1163
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,453
It's all right, gentlemen. Carry on.

1164
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,583
Now what?

1165
01:28:17,668 --> 01:28:20,503
5:00, Thursday, the gardens.

1166
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:22,505
Must be something around here.

1167
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:24,507
Charles's appointment was last week.

1168
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:27,802
- Yes, I know, but this is all we've got left.
- You're not kidding.

1169
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,304
Ten minutes ago I had a job.

1170
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:33,307
Now you've got another job,
so stop grumbling and start looking.

1171
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:36,310
I'll take that side.
You poke around over here.

1172
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:18,394
It's hopeless.
I don't even know what we're looking for.

1173
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:20,771
I don't think Tex does either.

1174
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:23,482
- Tex? Is he here?
- Look.

1175
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,741
I'm going to see what he's up to.
You stay here.

1176
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:34,785
Be careful, Adam.
He's already killed three men.

1177
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,437
Wait! Wait!

1178
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:45,439
Taxi!

1179
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,441
Look out.

1180
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:07,378
All right, where's the letter?

1181
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:12,007
The letter, huh?
It ain't worth nothin'.

1182
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:15,010
You know what I mean.
The envelope with the stamps on it.

1183
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:17,012
I want it.

1184
01:31:17,097 --> 01:31:19,974
You greenhorn.

1185
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:24,645
Why, you thick-skulled, harebrained,
half-witted greenhorn.

1186
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,565
And they was both too smart for us.

1187
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:31,402
- What are you talking about?
- First her husband, now her.

1188
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,696
She batted all of them big eyes at you...

1189
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:38,367
and you fell for it like an egg
from a tall chicken.

1190
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:40,703
You want the envelope?

1191
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:44,081
There. You take it. It's all yours.

1192
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:50,421
You killed all three of 'em for nothin'!

1193
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:54,550
You greenhorn!

1194
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:57,636
You block-headed jackass!

1195
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:00,139
You nincompoop!

1196
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,227
Sylvie!
What are you doing here?

1197
01:32:05,312 --> 01:32:07,563
I'm waiting for Jean-Louis.

1198
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,565
Oh. What's he up to?

1199
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:12,860
He was so excited when he got the stamps
you gave him this morning.

1200
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:15,821
- He said he'd never seen any like them.
- I'm glad.

1201
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:17,823
- What's all this?
- The stamp market.

1202
01:32:17,908 --> 01:32:19,867
It's there every Thursday afternoon.

1203
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:22,286
That's where Jean-Louis trades his stamps.

1204
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:26,248
- Good Lord, where is he?
- What's the matter, chĂ©rie?

1205
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,584
The stamps!
They're worth a fortune!

1206
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:31,378
- What?
- A fortune! Come on!

1207
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:41,680
- Oh, I don't see him anywhere.
- We'll separate.

1208
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:43,849
- You look over there.
- Okay.

1209
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:53,734
Jean-Louis.

1210
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:56,278
Jean-Louis!

1211
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:07,581
Jean-Louis.

1212
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:10,584
Reggie. Reggie.

1213
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:16,465
Jean-Louis, thank heaven.
Do you have the -

1214
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:21,720
- What's this?
- A man gave me all those for only three.

1215
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:25,516
A man? Oh, no, Jean-Louis.
Who? Where?

1216
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,396
Vite, mon chĂ©ri. Vite.

1217
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,232
- LĂ -bas.
- Come on.

1218
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:40,197
- Oh, but he's gone.
- I don't blame him.

1219
01:33:40,282 --> 01:33:42,700
Entrez.

1220
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:46,537
- Monsieur Felix?
- Oui.

1221
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:51,750
I was expecting you.
I knew you would come.

1222
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:53,752
Look at them, madame.

1223
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:57,548
Have you ever, in your entire life,
seen anything so beautifuI?

1224
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,551
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything about stamps.

1225
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:04,930
I know them as one knows his own face,
though I had never seen them.

1226
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:07,349
This one, a Swedish four shilling...

1227
01:34:07,434 --> 01:34:09,476
called Den Gula Fyraskillingen...

1228
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,520
printed in 1854.

1229
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:14,857
- What is it worth?
- Oh, the money is unimportant.

1230
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:17,109
I'm afraid it's very important.

1231
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:20,446
Well, in your money, perhaps $85,000.

1232
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:23,490
- May I sit down?
- Yes.

1233
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:26,702
- And the blue one?
- Oh, it's called The Hawaiian Blue.

1234
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:29,913
In 1894, the owner was murdered
by a rival collector...

1235
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:31,915
who was obsessed to own it.

1236
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,959
And what is its value today?

1237
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:36,628
65,000.

1238
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:40,257
- And the last one.
- Ah, the best for last.

1239
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:43,802
Le chef-d'Ĺ“uvre de la collection.
The masterpiece.

1240
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:46,638
The most valuable stamp
in the world.

1241
01:34:46,723 --> 01:34:48,682
It's called
the Gazette Maldave.

1242
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:53,645
It was printed by hand on colored paper
and marked with the initials of the printer.

1243
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:58,359
Today it has a value
of $100,000.

1244
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,944
I'm not a thief, madame.

1245
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:02,988
I knew there was some mistake.

1246
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:09,953
You gave the boy a great
many stamps in return.

1247
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:11,955
- Are they for sale now?
- Let me see.

1248
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,541
350 European, 200 Asian...

1249
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:17,544
175 American, 100 African...

1250
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:20,547
and 12 Princess Grace commemorative...

1251
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:22,549
which comes to 10 francs.

1252
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,179
And don't forget these.

1253
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:29,431
Thank you.

1254
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:31,392
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

1255
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:35,687
For a few minutes they were mine.
That is enough.

1256
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:43,153
Adam? Adam?

1257
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:27,990
- Hello?
- Mr. Bartholomew?

1258
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,992
Yes.

1259
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:32,161
Tex is dead. Smothered.

1260
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:38,876
And Adam did it. He killed them all.

1261
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,629
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1262
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:46,008
Tex wrote the word "Dyle"
before he died.

1263
01:36:48,595 --> 01:36:50,512
He's the murderer, I tell you.

1264
01:36:50,597 --> 01:36:54,266
Wait a minute, Mrs. Lampert.
You'd better give that to me again.

1265
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:57,561
It was the stamps on the letter
Charles had with him on the train.

1266
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:01,356
They were in plain view all the time,
but no one bothered to look at the envelope.

1267
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:04,693
Mrs. Lampert, listen to me.
You're not safe as long as you have these stamps.

1268
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:08,489
Let's see. Do you know the center garden
at the Palais Royale?

1269
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:11,074
- Yes. The colonnade?
- Yes, by the colonnade.

1270
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:16,121
- As fast as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
- I'm leaving right away. Good-bye.

1271
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:32,971
Reggie! The stamps!
Where are they? Reggie! Wait!

1272
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:36,266
So you can kill me, too? Tex is dead.
He wrote "Dyle" on the carpet.

1273
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:39,811
- I'm not Dyle. You know that.
- But Tex didn't know it. You're a murderer.

1274
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:41,813
Reggie, I want those stamps!

1275
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:44,858
- Palais Royale, vite.
- Je suis occupĂ©.

1276
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:47,110
- Mais c'est trĂ¨s urgent.
- OccupĂ©.

1277
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:25,065
Whoa!
Billet, monsieur.

1278
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:29,022
Oh!

1279
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:53,672
American Embassy.

1280
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:56,216
A-American Embassy?

1281
01:40:56,300 --> 01:41:00,262
Uh, Mr. Bartholomew's office, please.

1282
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:04,266
- Would you speak a little louder, please?
- I can't speak any louder.

1283
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:06,810
Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew.

1284
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:09,312
I'm sorry.
Mr. Bartholomew has left for the day.

1285
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:13,233
But someone's trying to kill me.

1286
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:15,736
- What?
- Kill me!

1287
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,238
You've got to get word
to him right away.

1288
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:21,950
He's - He's in the center garden
of the Palais Royale near the colonnade.

1289
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:25,287
Tell him I'm trapped in a phone booth
right below him in the metro station.

1290
01:41:25,371 --> 01:41:27,330
The name's Lampert.

1291
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,627
- Hello?
- Hello. Mr. Bartholomew?

1292
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:16,880
- Yes.
- There was a call for you
just now, Mr. Bartholomew.

1293
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:19,466
It sounded quite urgent.
A Mrs. Lampert.

1294
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:22,636
Lampert? I don't know any Mrs. Lampert.

1295
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:26,473
She says she's trapped in a metro station
and someone's trying to kill her.

1296
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:31,520
Trying to kill her?
Who does she think I am, the C.I.A.?

1297
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:34,481
All right, I guess you'd better call
the French police.

1298
01:43:26,284 --> 01:43:29,494
Mr. Bartholomew!
Mr. Bartholomew!

1299
01:43:29,579 --> 01:43:31,496
- Help me!
- Reggie, stop.

1300
01:43:32,415 --> 01:43:34,499
That man is Carson Dyle.

1301
01:43:36,586 --> 01:43:39,379
We all know Carson Dyle
is dead, Mrs. Lampert.

1302
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:42,591
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.
- Now, you're not gonna believe him.

1303
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:45,510
Bring those stamps over here.
He's trying to trick you again.

1304
01:43:45,595 --> 01:43:49,514
Tex recognized him. That's why he wrote Dyle.

1305
01:43:49,599 --> 01:43:52,893
- If you take him those stamps, he'll kill you, too.
- Mrs. Lampert...

1306
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:57,022
if I'm who he says I am,
what's preventing me from killing you right now?

1307
01:43:57,106 --> 01:44:00,775
Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps,
and he knows he'd never make it.

1308
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,778
Mrs. Lampert,
he wants the money for himself.

1309
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:05,864
That's all he's ever wanted.

1310
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:09,701
- He's with the C.I.A. I saw him at the embassy.
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.

1311
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:12,078
That's right, Mrs. Lampert.
That's right.

1312
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:14,205
I'm a dead man. Look at me.

1313
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:20,253
Oh, I don't know who anybody is.

1314
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:22,631
Reggie, I beg you.

1315
01:44:22,715 --> 01:44:24,633
Just trust me once more.

1316
01:44:24,717 --> 01:44:26,885
Why should I?

1317
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:30,221
I can't think of a reason
in the world why you should.

1318
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:38,730
Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert,
or I'll kill you.

1319
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:41,983
It won't get you the stamps, Dyle.
You'll have to come out to get them...

1320
01:44:42,068 --> 01:44:44,194
and I'm not likely to miss at this range.

1321
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:46,988
Maybe not, but it takes
a lot of bullets to kill me.

1322
01:44:47,073 --> 01:44:50,200
They left me there with five of them
in my legs and my stomach.

1323
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,994
Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was alive,
but they left me there.

1324
01:44:53,079 --> 01:44:55,956
I spent 10 months in a German prison camp
with nothing to stop the pain.

1325
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:58,667
They left me there, Mrs. Lampert.
They deserved to die.

1326
01:44:58,751 --> 01:45:02,504
- But I had nothing to do with it.
- You've got the money now. It belongs to me.

1327
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:06,299
Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was still alive,
but they left me there.

1328
01:45:06,384 --> 01:45:09,636
That's why I had to kill them,
all four of them.

1329
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,098
Please believe me. I'll kill you, too.
It won't make any difference.

1330
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:18,019
It's no use.
You're running out of time.

1331
01:45:18,104 --> 01:45:21,606
I've come too far to turn back.
I swear, I'll kill you.

1332
01:45:23,985 --> 01:45:26,528
Make up your mind, Mrs. Lampert. Now.

1333
01:45:26,612 --> 01:45:28,279
Adam!

1334
01:47:49,004 --> 01:47:52,090
All right.

1335
01:47:52,174 --> 01:47:55,260
I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert.
Come on out.

1336
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:14,863
Do you hear me? Come on out.

1337
01:48:27,168 --> 01:48:30,628
I don't want to kill you, but I will.

1338
01:48:35,467 --> 01:48:37,218
Come on out.

1339
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:16,132
The game is over, Mrs. Lampert.

1340
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:52,085
You didn't have to chase me so hard.

1341
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:55,088
- That one's done. Do this one.
- Oh.

1342
01:49:55,172 --> 01:49:58,091
I'm sorry I thought
you were the murderer...

1343
01:49:58,175 --> 01:50:01,594
but how was I to know
he was as big a liar as you are?

1344
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:04,597
Is that all the gratitude I get
for saving your hide?

1345
01:50:04,682 --> 01:50:09,269
- Rub your own blinking foot.
- The truth now. Was it my hide, or those stamps?

1346
01:50:09,353 --> 01:50:12,272
What a terrible thing to say.
How could you think that?

1347
01:50:12,356 --> 01:50:14,274
Then prove it to me.

1348
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:18,278
Tell me to go to the embassy first thing
in the morning and turn in those stamps.

1349
01:50:20,155 --> 01:50:23,992
- I said, tell me to go to the embassy first -
- I heard you, I heard you.

1350
01:50:24,076 --> 01:50:25,994
Then say it.

1351
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:29,205
Now, Reggie, listen to me.

1352
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:32,500
- There's something I'd like to explain.
- Never mind. I'll go by myself.

1353
01:50:32,584 --> 01:50:35,670
What makes you think they're even interested?
It's only a quarter million.

1354
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:39,090
It'll cost more than that for them
to fix their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer -

1355
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:41,467
Who's a taxpayer?
Crooks don't pay taxes.

1356
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:44,137
- Excuse me, soldier -
- Marine, ma'am.

1357
01:50:44,221 --> 01:50:48,474
Forgive me. Who would I see regarding
the return of stolen government money?

1358
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:50,476
You might try the Treasury Department.

1359
01:50:50,561 --> 01:50:52,687
Room 217, second floor, Mr. Cruikshank.

1360
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:55,106
217. Thank you, marine.

1361
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:04,115
Uh - Uh, do you mind
if I don't go in with you?

1362
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:08,119
The sight of all that money being given away
might make me break out.

1363
01:51:10,456 --> 01:51:13,374
Mr. Cruikshank, please.
My name is Lampert.

1364
01:51:13,459 --> 01:51:15,376
Yes.

1365
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:18,379
- Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss Lamp -
- Mrs.

1366
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:20,590
Mrs. Lampert to see you.

1367
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:22,967
- Yes, sir. Go right in.
- Thank you.

1368
01:51:33,437 --> 01:51:36,856
Of all the mean...

1369
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,858
rotten...

1370
01:51:38,942 --> 01:51:41,694
contemptible, crooked -

1371
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:45,114
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad
to find out I'm not crooked.

1372
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,575
You can't even be honest
about being dishonest.

1373
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:49,577
Why didn't you say something?

1374
01:51:49,661 --> 01:51:53,331
- We're not allowed to tell.
Come on, give me the stamps.
- Hmm.

1375
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:58,419
Wait a minute. How did Carson Dyle
get an office in this building anyway?

1376
01:51:58,504 --> 01:52:01,756
- When did you meet him?
What time of day, I mean.
- About 1:00.

1377
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,259
The lunch hour.
Probably worked it out in advance.

1378
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:08,679
Found an office usually left open
and moved in for the time you were here.

1379
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:12,392
Then how do I know this is your office?

1380
01:52:12,476 --> 01:52:17,146
Mrs. Foster, take a memo to Bartholomew
in Security recommending -

1381
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:19,482
Bartholomew.

1382
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:22,443
Recommending that embassy offices
be kept locked during the lunch hour.

1383
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:24,946
Mmm. Starting with his own.

1384
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:27,907
- Give me the stamps. Come on.
- What's your first name today?

1385
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:30,326
- Brian.
- Brian Cruikshank.

1386
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:32,912
Serves me right
if I get stuck with that one.

1387
01:52:32,996 --> 01:52:35,873
- Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
- Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

1388
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:37,875
- Yes.
- But we're divorced.

1389
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,836
No.

1390
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:42,839
Oh.

1391
01:52:44,633 --> 01:52:46,384
My mother. She lives in Detroit.

1392
01:52:46,468 --> 01:52:49,762
You'd like her. She'd like you, too.
Come on, give me those stamps.

1393
01:52:49,847 --> 01:52:53,057
Not until you prove to me
that you're really Brian Cruikshank.

1394
01:52:53,142 --> 01:52:56,477
One day next week I'll put it
on a marriage license. How about that?

1395
01:52:56,562 --> 01:52:58,479
Quit stalling.
I want some identification now.

1396
01:52:58,564 --> 01:53:02,442
- I wouldn't lie on a license.
- You can't prove it. You're still trying to -

1397
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:04,944
"Marriage license"?

1398
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:07,405
Did you say "marriage license"?

1399
01:53:07,489 --> 01:53:10,450
Don't change the subject.
Just give me the stamps.

1400
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:15,121
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian,
whatever your name is.

1401
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:17,123
Oh, I love you.

1402
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:19,125
I hope we have a lot of boys.

1403
01:53:19,209 --> 01:53:21,127
We can name them all after you.

1404
01:53:21,211 --> 01:53:24,130
Well, before we start that,
may I have the stamps?
