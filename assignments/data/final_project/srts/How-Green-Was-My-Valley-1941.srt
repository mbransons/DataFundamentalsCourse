1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:11,526
I am packing my belongings in the shawl
my mother used to wear to the market,

3
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,891
and I am going from my valley.

4
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:16,615
And this time I shall never return.

5
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:20,608
I am leaving behind me
my 50 years of memory.

6
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:23,334
Memory.

7
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,614
Strange that the mind will forget so much
of what only this moment is passed,

8
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:31,484
and yet hold clear and bright
the memory of what happened years ago,

9
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:33,965
of men and women long since dead.

10
00:01:34,856 --> 00:01:37,928
Yet who shall say
what is real and what is not?

11
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:40,811
Can I believe my friends all gone,

12
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:44,047
when their voices are still a glory in my ears?

13
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:48,290
No. And I will stand to say no and no again,

14
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:51,368
for they remain a living truth within my mind.

15
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:54,653
There is no fence nor hedge
around time that is gone.

16
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:58,012
You can go back and have what
you like of it, if you can remember.

17
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:01,725
So I can close my eyes on my valley
as it is today and it is gone,

18
00:02:01,816 --> 00:02:04,933
and I see it as it was when I was a boy.

19
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:07,849
Green it was, and possessed
of the plenty of the earth.

20
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:10,530
In all Wales, there was none so beautiful.

21
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:15,894
Everything I ever learnt as
a small boy came from my father,

22
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:20,015
and I never found anything he ever told me
to be wrong or worthless.

23
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:23,532
The simple lessons he taught me
are as sharp and clear in my mind

24
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,050
as if I had heard them only yesterday.

25
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:33,011
In those days, the black slag,
the waste of the coal pits,

26
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:36,532
had only begun to cover the side of our hill,

27
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:41,644
not yet enough to mar the countryside,
nor blacken the beauty of our village.

28
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:48,049
For the colliery had only begun to poke
its skinny black fingers through the green.

29
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:54,487
I can hear even now
the voice of my sister Angharad.

30
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:58,809
Huw!

31
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:06,049
Angharad!

32
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:16,372
Coal miners were my father
and all my brothers, and proud of their trade.

33
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:19,926
- Gwilym Morgan, three pounds seven.
- Thank you, sir.

34
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:23,053
Lanto Morgan, three pounds seven.

35
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,845
Ivor Morgan, three pounds seven.

36
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,450
Davy Morgan, two pounds five.

37
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,845
Owen Morgan, two pounds five.

38
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:40,006
Young Gwilym Morgan, one pound ten.

39
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,647
Someone would strike up a song,

40
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:47,172
and the valley would ring
with the sound of many voices.

41
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:50,851
For singing is in my people
as sight is in the eye.

42
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,328
Then came the scrubbing,
out in the back yard.

43
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:26,129
It was the duty of my sister Angharad
to bring the buckets of hot water and cold,

44
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:29,128
and I performed what little tasks I could

45
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:32,925
as my father and brothers
scrubbed the coal dust from their backs.

46
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:36,691
Most would come off them,
but some would stay for life.

47
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:39,244
It is the honourable badge of the coal miner,

48
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:42,772
and I envied it
on my father and grown-up brothers.

49
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:47,168
Scrub and scrub,
Mr Coal would lie there and laugh at you.

50
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:53,410
There was always a baron of beef or
a shoulder or leg of lamb before my father.

51
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:57,733
There was never any talk
while we were eating.

52
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:02,207
I never met anybody
whose talk was better than good food.

53
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,412
My mother was always on the run,

54
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:08,728
always the last to start her dinner,
and the first to finish.

55
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:13,412
For if my father was the head of our house,
my mother was its heart.

56
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:18,891
After the dishes had been washed,
the box was brought to the table

57
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:21,934
for the spending money to be handed out.

58
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:24,484
No one in our valley had ever seen a bank.

59
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:27,568
We kept our savings on the mantelpiece.

60
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,966
My father used to say
that money was made to be spent,

61
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:35,095
just as men spend
their strength and brains in earning it,

62
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:37,451
and as willingly.

63
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:39,925
But always with a purpose.

64
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:00,931
Thank you, Dadda.

65
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:09,926
Out of the house and across the street,
as I had run a hundred times before.

66
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:17,170
Softly now, for respect for chapel
was the first thing my father taught us.

67
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:23,255
Then straight to Mrs Tossal the Shop,

68
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:28,091
for that toffee which you could
chew for hours, it seems to me now.

69
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:31,964
And even after it had gone down,
you could swallow

70
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:35,844
and still find the taste of it
hiding behind your tongue.

71
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:40,611
It is with me now, so many years later.

72
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:45,771
It makes me think of so much
that was good that is gone.

73
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:55,728
It was on this afternoon
that I first saw Bron - Bronwyn.

74
00:08:55,816 --> 00:09:00,936
She had come over from the next valley
for her first call on my father and mother.

75
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,531
Is this Gwilym Morgan's house?

76
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:12,764
You must be Huw.

77
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:36,293
- Is that you, Bronwyn?
- Yes.

78
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,805
There's lovely you are.

79
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:44,215
I think I fell in love with Bronwyn then.

80
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:50,294
Perhaps it is foolish to think a child could
fall in love, but I am the child that was,

81
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:54,005
and nobody knows how I felt, except only me.

82
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:05,731
- I'm so proud for Ivor.
- I'm the one to be proud.

83
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:09,968
You think well of our Ivor?
It seems only a few months

84
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:13,731
since he was scratching around here
like this one, with his mouth open.

85
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,088
This is Bronwyn, Huw,
who's to be your sister.

86
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:22,565
We have met already.

87
00:10:23,576 --> 00:10:27,125
Be careful of the basket.
There's shortcake in it.

88
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:06,767
This is not for you. You will have
your time to come. Run along now.

89
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:15,895
Bronwyn and Ivor were to be married
by the new preacher, Mr Gruffydd,

90
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:18,649
who had come from the university at Cardiff.

91
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:21,125
This was my first sight of him.

92
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,888
- Good evening, Mr Morgan.
- Yes, indeed, sir.

93
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:14,251
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

94
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,210
Come now, boys. Back to work.

95
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:38,285
Ivor, find Dai Griffiths and Idris John
and bring them to Mr Evans' office.

96
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:41,493
- Will we come with you?
- No. This is a matter for the older men.

97
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:43,692
- Home to your mother.
- But...

98
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:45,926
Leave it now, Davy.

99
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:48,211
Well, come.

100
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:03,252
- Why aren't you washed?
- We were waiting for you.

101
00:17:06,136 --> 00:17:09,446
The cut is only a few shillings.
There will still be plenty for us.

102
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:11,925
A bit of supper now, is it, girl?

103
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:16,414
It is because they are not
getting the old price for coal.

104
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:19,693
- Come and wash now.
- May we speak first, sir?

105
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,968
- Yes.
- They did not give you the real reason.

106
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:27,605
We've been expecting it since
the ironworks at Dowlais closed down.

107
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,573
What have the ironworks to do with us?

108
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:34,252
The men from Dowlais will work for any
wage, so all our wages must come down.

109
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:37,214
And this is only the beginning. Watch now.

110
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:43,326
They will cut us again and still again, until
they have this as empty as their promises.

111
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:48,285
- A good worker is worth good wages.
- Not while there are three men for every job.

112
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:51,209
Why should the owners pay more
if men will work for less?

113
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:54,652
Because the owners are not savages.
They are men too, like us.

114
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,886
Men, yes, but not like us.

115
00:17:56,976 --> 00:18:00,048
Would they deal with you just now, sir,
when you went to them?

116
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:02,969
- No.
- Because they have power and we have none.

117
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:07,527
- How will we get power, then? From the air?
- No. From a union of all the men.

118
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:13,327
Union, is it? I never thought I'd hear
my own sons talking socialist nonsense.

119
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,850
- It's good sense.
- Unless we stand together...

120
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:19,724
- I've had enough of this talk.
- But, Father, it does...

121
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,251
Come and wash now.

122
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,804
Your good mother will be waiting.

123
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:53,207
Do you think I'll let them make you stand
in the rain and not raise my hands to stop it?

124
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:55,332
Hush, Davy.

125
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:59,565
- Who gave you permission to speak?
- It is too important for silence.

126
00:18:59,656 --> 00:19:05,049
- They're trying to punish you because...
- It is not more important than good manners.

127
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:09,170
But what are we going to do about it?
You'll die of cold when it comes to snow.

128
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:11,724
Let us stand together
and see how they act then.

129
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,933
Right. The men will come out
if we say the word.

130
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:17,655
All the pits are ready.

131
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:22,048
You'll not make me a plank for your politics.
I will not be the excuse for any strike.

132
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:26,454
But if they do that to the spokesman,
what will they try and do to the men?

133
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:28,925
We will see.
Be silent now. Finish your supper.

134
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,768
- Father...
- Enough now.

135
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:33,324
- But...
- On with your work.

136
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:38,370
- It is not enough.
- Wait until you have permission to speak.

137
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:42,574
I will speak against injustice anywhere,
with permission or without it.

138
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:45,966
- Not in this house.
- In this house and outside, sir.

139
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:50,208
- Leave the table.
- I will leave the house.

140
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:53,288
- Tell your father you're sorry.
- I'm not sorry.

141
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:56,448
I'm with you. We can find
lodgings in the village.

142
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:58,527
Gwilym.

143
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:06,446
All of you, then?

144
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:14,171
For the last time, sit down,
finish your supper. I will say no more.

145
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,134
We are not questioning your authority, sir.

146
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:22,210
But if manners prevent our speaking
the truth, we will be without manners.

147
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:25,576
Get your clothes and go.

148
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:45,170
- I'm going with them to look after them.
- Hold your tongue. Get on with your dishes.

149
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,488
Yes, my son, I know you are there.

150
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,165
The men have struck.

151
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,324
What does it mean, Mr Gruffydd?

152
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:27,011
It means that...

153
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:32,968
something has gone out of this valley
that may never be replaced.

154
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:36,969
Home to your father and mother, boy.
They'll need you today.

155
00:22:56,976 --> 00:23:01,845
Twenty-two weeks the men were out
as the strike moved into winter.

156
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:07,056
It was strange to go out into the street
and find the men there in the daytime.

157
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,525
It had a feeling of fright in it.

158
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:13,128
And always the mood of the men grew uglier,

159
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:17,414
as empty bellies and desperation
began to conquer reason.

160
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:23,694
Any man who was not their friend
became their enemy.

161
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:27,447
They knew that my father
had opposed the strike,

162
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:30,334
and now it was they who opposed him.

163
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:20,932
Huw, there's a meeting of the men
in the hills tonight, is it?

164
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:22,847
- Yes, Momma.
- You will take me.

165
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:24,927
No, Momma. It is no place for women.

166
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:29,646
There is a place for this woman
there tonight... upon my soul.

167
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,850
Wait. Wait till you hear me.

168
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:35,814
I am Beth Morgan, as you damn well know.

169
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:41,051
I have come to tell you what I think of you,
because you are talking against my husband.

170
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:44,048
You're a lot of cowards to go against him.

171
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:47,651
He would do nothing against you
and he never has, and you know him well.

172
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:54,414
How you smug-faced hypocrites can sit
in the same chapel with him, I cannot tell.

173
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:58,649
To say he is with the owners is not
only nonsense, but downright wickedness.

174
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:02,088
There's one thing more
I've got to say, and it is this.

175
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:04,895
If harm comes to my Gwilym,

176
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:10,050
I'll find out the men
and I will kill them with my two hands.

177
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:13,287
And this I will swear by God Almighty.

178
00:25:48,336 --> 00:25:50,645
Lanto! Help!

179
00:25:58,376 --> 00:26:01,334
Hold on, Momma.
They've heard us. They're coming.

180
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:45,245
He was awake just now.

181
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:53,008
He'll do, then. But it's beyond me to say why.

182
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:57,412
You're breeding horses
in this family, Mr Morgan.

183
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:02,046
This boy should be in his coffin, for my part.

184
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:04,331
He's a Morgan then, is it, sir?

185
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:09,091
He should be fed now, Mrs Ivor.
A little soup...

186
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,365
and some warm smiles.

187
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:26,004
Horse.

188
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:30,130
- Good day. Wait, wait, wait.
- Huw was awake just now. He spoke to Bron.

189
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:33,367
- How long then for the little one?
- It's hard to tell.

190
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:37,290
His legs were frozen to the bone.
A year, two years, quiet like that.

191
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:42,404
But I can't promise that he'll ever walk again.
Nature must take her course. Gee up.

192
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:46,374
Mind your tongue. I think he heard you.

193
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:08,532
Where is the light
I thought to see in your eye?

194
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:12,931
Are you afraid, boy?

195
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:22,328
- You heard what the doctor said?
- Yes, sir.

196
00:28:22,936 --> 00:28:25,325
And you believed it?

197
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:27,887
Yes, sir.

198
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:31,365
You want to walk again, don't you?

199
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:33,651
Yes, sir.

200
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:36,806
Then you must have faith.

201
00:28:36,896 --> 00:28:41,606
And if you have, you will walk again,
no matter what all the doctors say.

202
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:46,445
But he said nature must take her course.

203
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:51,815
Nature is the handmaiden of the Lord.

204
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:58,126
I remember one or two occasions when
she was given orders to change her course.

205
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:01,686
- You know your scriptures, boy.
- Yes, sir.

206
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:06,213
Then you know that what's been
done before can be done again, for you.

207
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:10,011
Do you believe me, Huw?

208
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,050
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

209
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:16,492
You will see the first daffodil,
out on the mountain.

210
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:19,932
- Will you?
- Indeed I will, sir.

211
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:22,805
Then you will.

212
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:28,365
I could almost wish

213
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:31,528
that I were lying there in your place

214
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:35,404
if it meant reading
this book again for the first time.

215
00:29:36,336 --> 00:29:39,931
Treasure Island.

216
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,732
Mr Gruffydd?

217
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:14,968
- I couldn't let you go without thanking you.
- It was only my duty, girl.

218
00:30:15,056 --> 00:30:17,286
No. It was more than duty.

219
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:20,691
Yes. Huw's a fine boy.

220
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:23,574
And you're a fine family.

221
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:27,331
You'd better be going in now.
You'll catch your death.

222
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:31,446
Will you be coming to supper soon?

223
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:35,051
Yes. Later, when you're finished
with doctors and such.

224
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:38,650
- I will hurry them away, then.
- Good.

225
00:30:44,336 --> 00:30:48,045
"Squire Trelawney, Dr Livesey,
and the rest of these gentlemen

226
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:53,130
having asked me to write down the
whole particulars about Treasure Island

227
00:30:56,376 --> 00:31:00,688
from the beginning to the end, keeping
nothing back but the bearings of the island,

228
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,813
and only because there is
still treasure not yet lifted,

229
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:08,572
I take up my pen in the year of grace 1785,

230
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:18,089
and go back to the time when
my father kept the 'Admiral Benbow' inn."

231
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,649
All the noble books which have
lived in my mind ever since,

232
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,484
and always I hoped, and kept my faith.

233
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:31,886
For the first months
my mother was still upstairs,

234
00:31:31,976 --> 00:31:35,366
and we could talk to each other with tappings.

235
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,892
Spring?

236
00:32:52,696 --> 00:32:54,891
There you are, girl.

237
00:32:56,736 --> 00:32:58,886
Easy.

238
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,967
There.

239
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,847
Wait.

240
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:19,011
It's the old snow got into it.

241
00:34:21,216 --> 00:34:23,207
Gwilym.

242
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:29,448
There is a wife you have, resting in her bed
and letting strangers care for her family.

243
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:31,925
There is a wife I have, then.

244
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:34,371
Go along with you, boy.

245
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:45,010
Will you say something, Mother?

246
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:49,530
Go on, say something.

247
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:51,811
What can I say?

248
00:35:52,856 --> 00:35:57,930
You found plenty to say last time you spoke.
It should be easier now, with friends.

249
00:36:00,736 --> 00:36:02,806
Well...

250
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:06,047
Well... Come and eat, everyone.

251
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:15,047
More, is it, boys?

252
00:36:24,376 --> 00:36:26,367
Lanto.

253
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:29,095
I haven't seen you in chapel lately.

254
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:32,771
- I have been too busy.
- What business, may I ask?

255
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:36,849
- Mine.
- Only asking a civil question, I was.

256
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:40,724
And having a civil answer.
I have been busy with the union.

257
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:45,807
Unions are the work of the Devil.
You will come to no good end.

258
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:49,047
At least I am not sitting on it,
talking rubbish in chapel.

259
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:53,095
- Look here...
- Leave it, or I'll say something to be sorry.

260
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:55,736
This is a matter that requires airing.

261
00:36:56,736 --> 00:37:00,695
Lanto, why do you think
we at the chapel talk rubbish?

262
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:03,935
My remark was not aimed at you.

263
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:06,211
Then aim it.

264
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:09,487
Very well.

265
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:15,247
Because you make yourselves out
to be shepherds of the flock,

266
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:19,568
and yet you allow your sheep
to live in filth and poverty.

267
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,773
And if they try and raise
their voices against it,

268
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:27,327
you calm them by telling them
their suffering is the will of God.

269
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:33,888
Sheep, indeed. Are we sheep to be herded
and sheared by a handful of owners?

270
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:39,854
I was taught man was made
in the image of God, not a sheep.

271
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:42,928
- Lanto.
- I haven't expressed my views

272
00:37:43,016 --> 00:37:47,692
because I haven't had any wish
to interfere in a family disagreement.

273
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:50,609
You have my permission to speak.

274
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:53,893
Very well, then. Here is what I think.

275
00:37:53,976 --> 00:37:56,934
First, have your union.

276
00:37:57,016 --> 00:38:01,726
You need it. Alone, you are weak.
Together, you are strong.

277
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:06,890
But remember that with strength goes
responsibility, to others and yourselves.

278
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:10,605
For you cannot conquer injustice
with more injustice,

279
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:12,926
only with justice, and the help of God.

280
00:38:13,016 --> 00:38:16,645
Are you coming outside
your position in life, Mr Gruffydd?

281
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:18,966
Your business is spiritual.

282
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:22,128
My business is anything
between man and the spirit of God.

283
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,891
The deacons shall hear that
you have been preaching socialism.

284
00:38:25,976 --> 00:38:28,331
- Mr Parry...
- Loose the old devil.

285
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:30,407
- Mr Parry...
- Stop now. He is our guest.

286
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:35,490
- Beth, a pint of home-brew for Mr Parry.
- I'll give him a clout with the frying pan.

287
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:40,849
Miss Jenkins. A sweet song. The harp, is it?
Come on, men. Get in here.

288
00:38:40,936 --> 00:38:43,131
Now look, a little song...

289
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:01,887
Angharad.

290
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:06,811
Mr Gruffydd, will we always be in your debt?
Now you have made us a family again.

291
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,691
Here. Let me.

292
00:39:21,616 --> 00:39:24,335
Your hands. There's a pity.

293
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,611
No matter.

294
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:31,926
Have you ever been down the collieries?

295
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:34,484
- Ten years.
- Ten years?

296
00:39:34,576 --> 00:39:36,965
While I was studying.

297
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:41,728
- A bit of soap now.
- Don't bother, please.

298
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:48,765
There's a man for you,
spoiling his good handkerchief.

299
00:39:49,736 --> 00:39:54,651
Look now, you are king in the chapel,
but I will be queen in my own kitchen.

300
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:57,330
You will be queen wherever you walk.

301
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:02,609
What does that mean?

302
00:40:02,696 --> 00:40:04,812
I should not have said it.

303
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:07,091
Why?

304
00:40:08,776 --> 00:40:11,370
I have no right to speak to you so.

305
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:18,931
Mr Gruffydd?

306
00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:23,005
If the right is mine to give,

307
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:26,765
you have it.

308
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:48,011
Then the strike was settled,
with the help of Mr Gruffydd and my father.

309
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:53,250
Work again, work to wipe out
the memory of idleness and hardship.

310
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:56,408
The men were happy
going up the hill that morning.

311
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,487
- One and nine.
- One and ten.

312
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:08,415
But not all of them, for there were
too many now for the jobs open,

313
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:13,934
and some learned that never again would
there be work for them in their own valley.

314
00:41:29,496 --> 00:41:32,010
It is the same all over South Wales, it is.

315
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:38,534
Father, in Cardiff the men are standing
in line to have bread from the government.

316
00:41:38,616 --> 00:41:40,732
Not for us, eh, lad?

317
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:48,893
We will have our share of the box
and go, if you please, sir.

318
00:41:49,536 --> 00:41:52,334
- Where will you go?
- America.

319
00:42:06,736 --> 00:42:09,091
- My share too, Owen.
- And mine.

320
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:12,054
No. Our own.

321
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:15,765
- We will take no charity.
- Not charity, man. Sense.

322
00:42:15,856 --> 00:42:18,131
No, only our own.

323
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:27,170
Say nothing of this to your mother.
Let this day be over first.

324
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:29,770
Never mind saying nothing.

325
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:32,051
I heard.

326
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:38,564
America.

327
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,045
My babies.

328
00:42:53,376 --> 00:42:55,765
Shall we have a chapter, my sons?

329
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:04,009
What shall we have, sir?

330
00:43:04,096 --> 00:43:06,246
Isaiah 55.

331
00:43:07,816 --> 00:43:10,250
Those two gone. This is only the beginning.

332
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:13,487
Then all of you will go,
one after the other. All of you.

333
00:43:13,576 --> 00:43:15,646
I will never leave you, Momma.

334
00:43:15,736 --> 00:43:20,127
Huw, boy, if you should ever leave me,
I'll be sorry I ever had babies.

335
00:43:21,136 --> 00:43:23,525
Why did you have them?

336
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,252
Indeed to goodness, boy, why?

337
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:31,045
To keep my hands in water
and my face to the fire, perhaps.

338
00:43:50,736 --> 00:43:53,125
For Mr Ivor Morgan.

339
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:57,376
From Windsor Castle it is.

340
00:44:30,296 --> 00:44:34,289
"Mr Ivor Morgan is commanded
to appear before Her Maj..."

341
00:44:35,696 --> 00:44:40,292
"Mr Ivor Morgan is commanded to appear
before Her Majesty at Windsor Castle,

342
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:45,370
with chosen members of his choir, on 14
May between the hours of three and five."

343
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,251
To sing before the Queen.

344
00:44:53,336 --> 00:44:56,567
My son, I never thought
to see this beautiful day.

345
00:44:56,656 --> 00:45:01,411
Idris, Owen, all of you.
Fetch everyone from all the valleys round.

346
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:04,966
Davy, over to the other collieries.
Invite everyone.

347
00:45:05,056 --> 00:45:10,050
Lanto, down to the Three Bells for beer.
Open house tonight for all who will come.

348
00:45:15,936 --> 00:45:19,770
My sons, you shall have
a sendoff worthy of the Morgans.

349
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:54,726
Our Heavenly Father, I give thanks
from the heart to live this day.

350
00:45:55,256 --> 00:45:59,647
I give thanks for all I have,
and I do give thanks for this new blessing.

351
00:46:00,456 --> 00:46:04,734
For you are our Father,
but we look to our Queen as our mother.

352
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:07,974
Comfort her in her troubles, O God,

353
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:12,413
and let her worries be
not more than she shall bear at her age.

354
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:17,292
And grant that sweetness
and power and spirit

355
00:46:17,376 --> 00:46:20,812
may be given to these voices
that shall sing at her command.

356
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:23,171
- Amen.
- Amen.

357
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,247
Gwilym. Owen.

358
00:47:20,016 --> 00:47:23,088
Good morning, Mr Gruffydd.
Angharad is down to the market.

359
00:47:23,176 --> 00:47:25,292
Angharad? I've come for Huw.

360
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:27,571
For Huw?

361
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:31,128
- The daffodils are out, Momma.
- Where are your clothes?

362
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:35,095
Under my pillow.
For these months, ready for today.

363
00:47:35,176 --> 00:47:39,055
Come you, then, and you shall
bring back a posy fit for a queen

364
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:41,727
for your brave mother.

365
00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:44,205
Indeed I will, sir.

366
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:53,251
- Almost there, Huw.
- Yes, sir.

367
00:47:53,656 --> 00:47:56,614
- Low bridge there. Watch out.
- It's fun.

368
00:47:56,696 --> 00:47:59,085
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

369
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:11,645
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

370
00:48:22,096 --> 00:48:24,485
Easy it is, now.

371
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:26,567
There.

372
00:48:33,216 --> 00:48:35,411
Cwm Rhondda.

373
00:48:42,176 --> 00:48:44,565
You can walk, Huw, if you try.

374
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:49,374
Come, lad. You can walk.

375
00:48:52,736 --> 00:48:55,125
Huw. Walk.

376
00:49:02,696 --> 00:49:05,494
There's a good lad. Come on.

377
00:49:10,496 --> 00:49:12,452
See?

378
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:14,845
There's a good old man.

379
00:49:19,216 --> 00:49:21,525
You've been lucky, Huw.

380
00:49:21,616 --> 00:49:26,815
Lucky to suffer, and lucky to
spend these weary months in bed.

381
00:49:28,016 --> 00:49:33,295
For so God has given you a chance
to make spirit within yourself.

382
00:49:33,376 --> 00:49:37,733
And as your father cleans
his lamp to have good light,

383
00:49:37,816 --> 00:49:40,091
so keep clean your spirit, huh?

384
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:42,212
How, sir?

385
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:48,256
By prayer, Huw.

386
00:49:48,336 --> 00:49:51,408
And by prayer I don't mean
shouting and mumbling,

387
00:49:51,496 --> 00:49:55,250
and wallowing like a hog
in religious sentiment.

388
00:49:55,336 --> 00:50:00,126
Prayer is only another name
for good, clean, direct thinking.

389
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:04,694
When you pray, think.

390
00:50:04,776 --> 00:50:06,767
Think well what you're saying.

391
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:09,768
Make your thoughts into things that are solid,

392
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:13,053
and in that way
your prayer will have strength.

393
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:17,926
And that strength will become
a part of you, body, mind and spirit.

394
00:50:19,296 --> 00:50:23,892
And the first duty of these new legs
is to get you to chapel on Sunday.

395
00:50:25,096 --> 00:50:29,294
- Indeed they will, sir.
- There's a good old man again.

396
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:34,251
Give me your hand.

397
00:50:40,736 --> 00:50:42,931
Come on, now.

398
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:47,566
Will you please remain in your places?
There's to be a meeting of the deacons.

399
00:52:05,016 --> 00:52:07,007
Meillyn Lewis.

400
00:52:08,856 --> 00:52:11,245
Step forward.

401
00:52:41,936 --> 00:52:44,370
Your sins have found you out.

402
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:48,213
And now you must pay the price
of all women like you.

403
00:52:48,616 --> 00:52:53,212
You have brought a child into the world
against the commandment.

404
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:55,446
Prayer is wasted on your sort.

405
00:52:55,816 --> 00:53:00,253
You shall be cast out into the utter darkness
till you have learned your lesson.

406
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:05,091
Meillyn Lewis, do you admit your sin?

407
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:13,687
Yes.

408
00:53:15,096 --> 00:53:17,485
Then prepare to suffer your punishment.

409
00:53:17,576 --> 00:53:20,295
Stop it. Leave her alone, you hypocrite.

410
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:22,412
- Leave it now, Mr Morgan.
- Sit down.

411
00:53:22,496 --> 00:53:24,487
Angharad.

412
00:53:29,696 --> 00:53:34,406
How could you watch them? Cruel old men,
groaning and nodding to hurt her more.

413
00:53:34,496 --> 00:53:39,012
That is not the word of God.
"Go thou and sin no more," Jesus said.

414
00:53:41,576 --> 00:53:43,567
Angharad.

415
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:58,246
- You know your Bible too well, life too little.
- I know Meillyn Lewis is no worse than I am.

416
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:01,965
- Angharad.
- What do the deacons know about it?

417
00:54:02,056 --> 00:54:05,731
What do you know about what
could happen to a poor girl when...

418
00:54:05,816 --> 00:54:10,685
when she loves a man so much that even to
lose sight of him for a moment is torture?

419
00:54:27,896 --> 00:54:30,410
- Does it hurt you, Huw?
- Easy, now.

420
00:54:31,136 --> 00:54:33,127
Huw?

421
00:54:39,616 --> 00:54:41,811
Angharad.

422
00:54:41,896 --> 00:54:45,127
I am a man now. Kindly leave the kitchen.

423
00:54:45,216 --> 00:54:47,605
So you're a man now, is it?

424
00:54:52,576 --> 00:54:56,694
Beth. Blasphemy, sacrilege and hypocrisy.

425
00:54:56,776 --> 00:54:59,574
Can't a man smoke
and read a paper on the Sabbath?

426
00:54:59,656 --> 00:55:01,851
Go and blow your nose.

427
00:55:05,216 --> 00:55:07,013
Come in.

428
00:55:07,736 --> 00:55:09,727
Come in.

429
00:55:16,376 --> 00:55:18,173
What under the blazes...

430
00:55:18,256 --> 00:55:21,931
- Good morning, Morgan.
- Good morning, Mr Evans.

431
00:55:22,016 --> 00:55:25,452
- Sit down, sir. Sit down, sir.
- Thank you.

432
00:55:27,936 --> 00:55:30,450
Mr Evans.

433
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:33,209
The mine owner himself.

434
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,207
Angharad.

435
00:55:41,136 --> 00:55:43,525
- Now to business.
- Yes, sir.

436
00:55:47,856 --> 00:55:52,088
I've come here on
a very delicate mission, Morgan.

437
00:55:52,176 --> 00:55:55,009
- No trouble, sir?
- No. No trouble.

438
00:55:55,096 --> 00:55:58,691
- But it worries me.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:56:00,096 --> 00:56:03,213
I'm here to get your permission

440
00:56:05,016 --> 00:56:07,610
that my son lestyn

441
00:56:08,536 --> 00:56:10,527
may have permission...

442
00:56:12,376 --> 00:56:14,367
- Bless you, Morgan.
- Thank you, sir.

443
00:56:16,736 --> 00:56:19,569
- Now where was I?
- "Permission"?

444
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:22,728
Yes. That my son lestyn

445
00:56:22,816 --> 00:56:26,775
may have permission,
with your daughter's permission,

446
00:56:26,856 --> 00:56:29,450
to call upon her. There we are.

447
00:56:36,856 --> 00:56:39,768
We are a very proud family, Mr Evans.

448
00:56:39,856 --> 00:56:42,324
Yes, I know. I know, Morgan.

449
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:46,125
But this is not my doing, Morgan.
It's that young whelp of a...

450
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:50,209
Mr Evans. Your son has
my permission to speak to me.

451
00:56:51,216 --> 00:56:54,413
Thank you, Morgan.
I'm very much obliged to you.

452
00:56:54,496 --> 00:56:56,487
Yes, sir.

453
00:56:56,936 --> 00:57:00,451
Good old Welsh blood, you know,
and all that sort of thing.

454
00:57:00,536 --> 00:57:04,245
- I'm very much obliged, Morgan.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:06,933
Beth.

456
00:57:07,016 --> 00:57:10,008
Come, come, come. My shoes. Get my shoes.

457
00:57:10,096 --> 00:57:14,726
You, girl. Get up to your room. Have you
no modesty left in you? Get up there.

458
00:57:14,816 --> 00:57:17,614
Get your hands out...
My shoes. Find the shoes.

459
00:57:17,696 --> 00:57:20,085
Why don't you get yourjackets on?

460
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:28,647
Mr Morgan?

461
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,931
Sit down.

462
00:57:40,336 --> 00:57:42,531
This is my wife, Mrs Morgan.

463
00:57:43,656 --> 00:57:45,647
How do you do?

464
00:57:46,816 --> 00:57:51,765
Mr Morgan, I've come to ask your permission
to speak to your daughter, Angharad.

465
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:05,211
These are my sons.

466
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,886
Yes. I know them.

467
00:58:15,376 --> 00:58:17,651
God bless you.

468
00:59:16,896 --> 00:59:18,887
You shouldn't be here.

469
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:22,173
I couldn't spend
another night without knowing.

470
00:59:22,256 --> 00:59:25,009
What has happened? Is anything wrong?

471
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:28,406
- Wrong?
- You know what I mean.

472
00:59:28,496 --> 00:59:32,614
Why have you changed towards me?
Why am I a stranger now?

473
00:59:32,696 --> 00:59:35,085
Have I done anything?

474
00:59:36,816 --> 00:59:38,807
No.

475
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:42,407
The blame is mine.

476
00:59:43,736 --> 00:59:45,886
Your mother spoke to me after chapel.

477
00:59:45,976 --> 00:59:49,491
She's happy to think
you'll be having plenty all of your days.

478
00:59:49,576 --> 00:59:51,771
With lestyn Evans.

479
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:57,128
- You could do no better.
- I don't want him.

480
00:59:57,216 --> 00:59:59,047
I want you.

481
00:59:59,136 --> 01:00:01,013
Angharad?

482
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:09,726
I have spent nights too,
trying to think this out.

483
01:00:11,456 --> 01:00:15,051
When I took up this work,
I knew what it meant.

484
01:00:15,136 --> 01:00:18,048
It meant sacrifice and devotion.

485
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:24,450
It meant making it my whole life to the...
to the exclusion of everything else.

486
01:00:25,336 --> 01:00:27,930
That I was perfectly willing to do.

487
01:00:30,536 --> 01:00:33,004
But to share it with another...

488
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,415
Do you think I will
have you going threadbare,

489
01:00:36,496 --> 01:00:39,408
depending on the charity
of others for your good meals?

490
01:00:39,496 --> 01:00:42,249
Our children growing up in cast-off clothing,

491
01:00:42,336 --> 01:00:45,772
and ourselves thanking God for
parenthood in a house full of bits?

492
01:00:45,856 --> 01:00:50,293
No. I can bear with such a life
for the sake of my work,

493
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:53,690
but I think I'd start to kill if...

494
01:00:55,056 --> 01:00:59,732
if I saw the white come to your hair
20 years before its time.

495
01:01:01,056 --> 01:01:03,047
Why?

496
01:01:06,016 --> 01:01:08,246
Why would you start to kill?

497
01:01:08,896 --> 01:01:11,569
Are you a man or a saint?

498
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:16,045
I am no saint. But I have a duty towards you.

499
01:01:16,136 --> 01:01:18,445
Let me do it.

500
01:02:56,336 --> 01:03:00,534
Is there to be no singing for
my daughter's wedding, Dai Bando?

501
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:51,988
Now then. The bathtub holds 100 gallons.

502
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:58,620
"A" fills it at the rate of 20 gallons a minute,

503
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:02,582
and "B" at the rate of ten gallons a minute.

504
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:06,825
- Got that, Mr Morgan?
- Twenty and ten gallons. Yes, sir.

505
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:12,143
Now then. "C" is a hole that empties it
at the rate of five gallons a minute.

506
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:16,066
How long to fill the tub?

507
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:25,103
There is silly. Trying to fill
a bathtub full of holes, indeed.

508
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:28,940
A sum it is, girl. A sum.
A problem for the mind.

509
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:32,341
- For his examination into school.
- That old national school.

510
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:36,708
'Tis silly they are with their sums. Who
would pour water in a bathtub full of holes?

511
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:40,499
- Who would think of it? Only a madman.
- It is to see if the boy can calculate.

512
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:44,219
Figures, nothing else.
How many gallons, and how long.

513
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,019
In a bathtub full of holes.

514
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,388
Now I know why I have such a tribe of sons.

515
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:54,700
It is you, Beth Morgan, is the cause.

516
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:58,463
Look you, Mr Gruffydd.
Have you something else?

517
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:00,745
The decimal point.

518
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,499
The decimal...

519
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:07,866
The decimal point, then,
and peace to my house.

520
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:10,418
- Go and scratch.
- Well, it's getting late.

521
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:14,822
I've got to get along. We'll follow
the decimal point tomorrow night.

522
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:17,299
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs Morgan.

523
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:24,780
Who is there that cannot look back
and remember his first day at a new school?

524
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:28,988
To go alone the long walk
over the hills to the next valley,

525
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:33,905
the first of my family to have
the privilege of attending a national school.

526
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,824
So you're the new boy?

527
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,979
- Yes, sir.
- You're late.

528
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:18,461
Yes, sir.

529
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,901
What a dirty little sweep it is.

530
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,781
Who are your people?

531
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:27,179
- Where are you from?
- Cwm Rhondda.

532
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:29,861
Cwm Rhondda?

533
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:34,270
A little genius from the coal pits.

534
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:38,138
And they expect me to make
a scholar of it. All right, come in.

535
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,224
Were you brought up in stables?

536
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,778
Well, shut the door.

537
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:22,819
Your boots are muddy.

538
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:27,988
They were clean when I left home.

539
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:31,380
You will address me as "sir",
or I'll put a stick about your back.

540
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:34,064
- Now sit down here.
- Yes, sir.

541
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:06,508
Come here, you dirty little sweep.

542
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:10,179
What have we here?

543
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,738
A pencil box.

544
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:15,025
Pretty, too.

545
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:21,419
You broke my pencil box.

546
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,938
Mervyn, stop it. You'll hurt him.

547
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,741
I fell on the mountain.

548
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:14,105
Did you win, Huw?

549
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:16,821
No.

550
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:20,661
Lanto.

551
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:35,142
- Fetch Dai Bando.
- Dai Bando, is it?

552
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:04,302
- Are you willing to go to school tomorrow?
- Yes, sir.

553
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:09,748
Good. You shall get a penny for every mark
on your face, sixpence for a bloody nose,

554
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,902
a shilling for a black eye,
two shillings for a broken nose.

555
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:15,823
Gwilym. Stop it. Fight again,

556
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:19,619
and when you come home, not a look
will you get from me, not a word.

557
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:23,703
Break your own nose, then. Break my heart
every time you go out of the house.

558
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:26,748
- A boy must fight, Beth.
- Fight?

559
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:29,708
Fight? Another beating like that,
he will walk home dead.

560
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,940
Beating? He's had no beating.

561
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:34,021
A hiding, yes, but no beating.

562
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:38,103
Give the boy time, it will be he
that's giving the beating, is it?

563
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,181
Dai Bando. Come into the house.

564
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:44,582
- Good evening, Mrs Morgan.
- Leave off your hat.

565
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,310
Dai Bando is going to teach you to box, Huw.

566
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:04,542
To fight first. Too many call themselves
boxers who are not even fighters.

567
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,303
- Boxing is an art, is it?
- It is, it is.

568
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,898
Go along with you, girl.
A cup of tea for the men.

569
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,981
- Tea?
- Tea?

570
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,630
No tea, Mrs Morgan.

571
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:18,305
In training, he is.

572
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:21,862
A glass of beer, if you please.

573
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:26,899
Baths full of holes.

574
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:29,585
And now prizefighters.

575
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:04,944
So our little coal miner has been
indulging in his favourite sport again?

576
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:08,739
- Mr Phillips, make a back. Make a back.
- I refuse, sir.

577
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:11,219
Mr Wells, make a back.

578
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:16,709
Here. Put this in between your teeth.

579
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,585
Bite it hard.

580
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:41,305
Well, the scholar.

581
01:12:56,870 --> 01:13:00,067
- Huw, lad.
- Well, I will go to my death.

582
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:04,300
- Did you get that in school?
- He has cut you to the bone. Who was it?

583
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:06,858
- Mr Jonas, is it?
- We'll have a word with Mr Jonas.

584
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:08,861
- No.
- And why not?

585
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:12,465
- I broke the rule when I fought.
- There is no rule for that.

586
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:14,780
- But he warned me.
- Rubbish, boy. I'll...

587
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,906
Hush, Davy.

588
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:20,380
This is Huw's affair. He shall decide.

589
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:23,940
Say the word, lad, and we will
have the bones hot from his flesh.

590
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:26,385
No. Leave him alone.

591
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:33,260
I think our baby brother
is becoming quite a man.

592
01:13:56,990 --> 01:14:01,347
These denominations are used
in measuring distances and...

593
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:05,945
- Yes?
- Right.

594
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:10,900
- Good morning, Mr...
- Jonas.

595
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:15,222
Mr Jonas. We have come
to the right place indeed.

596
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:18,749
What can I do for you?

597
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:22,618
A man is never too old to learn,
is it, Mr Jonas?

598
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:26,069
- No.
- I was in school myself once.

599
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:30,063
- But no great one for knowledge.
- Look here, what do you want?

600
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:32,141
Knowledge.

601
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:38,419
How would you go about taking
the measurement of a stick, Mr Jonas?

602
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:41,866
- By its length, of course.
- And how would you measure a man

603
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:44,703
who would use a stick on a boy
one third his size?

604
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:48,578
- Tell us.
- Now, you are good in the use of a stick.

605
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:53,300
But boxing is my subject, to the rules laid
down by the good Marquess of Queensberry.

606
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:55,699
God rest his soul.

607
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:59,627
And happy I am to pass on
my knowledge to you.

608
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:05,542
Mr Mottshill. Mr Mottshill.

609
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:07,905
All right, get him into position, now.

610
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:12,939
Look, to make a good boxer,
you must have a good right hand.

611
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:15,021
You see?

612
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:19,385
Now, that is how you will punish your man,
with a right and a left.

613
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,506
And put your soul into it, with...

614
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:24,184
The gentleman is talking to you.

615
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:28,223
- Raise him up.
- Come, come, come. Up, up, up.

616
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:30,699
Position again.

617
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:33,982
Could I have your attention, boys and girls?

618
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:38,618
I am not accustomed to speaking in public...

619
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:41,144
- Only public houses.
- But this...

620
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:46,741
Never use. It's against the rules.
Break a man's nose. Now the...

621
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:55,506
- I'm afraid he will never make a boxer.
- No aptitude for knowledge.

622
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:32,265
Mr Gruffydd.

623
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:12,699
Ivor... fell under a tram, lower level.

624
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:19,021
Ivor!

625
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:05,788
- We have our first grandson, Gwil.
- Well, give one and take the other.

626
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:08,543
Tell that to that girl up there.
She will answer you.

627
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:11,906
- Hist now, Beth. Do not kindle the wrath.
- To hell with the wrath.

628
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:14,550
And I'm saying it plain to be heard.

629
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:23,028
'Tis good. With honours, then.

630
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:25,499
Our son is a scholar.

631
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:29,547
What is it, Huw? I can't make sense with it.

632
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:32,190
- Latin, it is.
- Latin, is it?

633
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:35,148
Why not good Welsh, or even English?

634
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:38,259
- It is the fashion.
- Fashion.

635
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:41,626
Frenchies, decimal points,
and bathtubs full of holes.

636
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,827
My poor Huw. They've stuffed
your head with Latin, then?

637
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:50,348
- Beth, my old beauty, you. A black eye, is it?
- Go ahead, shout. Wake up the baby, then.

638
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:54,343
There is beautiful.
The image of my father, he is.

639
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,025
What bloody nonsense.

640
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:04,147
Now then, Huw. What will it be?

641
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:09,224
To Cardiff to school, then the university
to be a lawyer, is it, or a doctor?

642
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:15,502
Dr Huw Morgan. Well, Uncle Huw,
that will be something special.

643
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:20,539
Yes, indeed, with a lovely horse and trap,
and a good black suit and a shirt with starch.

644
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:24,020
There is good, my little one.
Now, a glass of buttermilk for you,

645
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:26,499
with all your knowledge.

646
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:30,546
Yes, Mother. And some of Bron's shortcake.

647
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:33,064
And my shortcake is
to be fed to the pigs, is it?

648
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:37,860
No. Only I finished yours yesterday,
and today is shortcake day with Bron.

649
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:41,347
I'm sorry, Huw.
Only currant bread I made today.

650
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:45,103
Nobody to eat it now.

651
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:57,988
Mother. I am lonely without him.

652
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:02,220
I put his boots and clothes ready every night,

653
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:06,468
but they are there still in the morning.

654
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:10,979
There is lonely I am.

655
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:23,546
Gwil, I will have Bron
here to live if she will come.

656
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:27,104
Not Bron.

657
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:29,579
One mistress in the house.

658
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:34,065
Now, Huw, what will it be?

659
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,664
I will go down the colliery with you, sir.

660
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:41,345
Have sense, boy.
The colliery is no place for you.

661
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:43,580
Why not try for a respectable job?

662
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:47,663
Respectable? Are you and his brothers
a lot of old jailbirds, then?

663
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:51,265
Leave it now, Beth.
I only want the best for the boy.

664
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:54,740
If he is as good a man as you
and his brothers, I will rest happy.

665
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:58,186
I am thinking of the boy's future.
It was different in our day.

666
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:01,899
There was good money and fair play
for all. But Huw is a scholar.

667
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:04,504
Why take brains down a coal mine?

668
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,979
I would rather, sir.

669
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:16,426
All right.

670
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:18,819
Decide for yourself.

671
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:22,064
But blame yourself if you are wrong.

672
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:25,579
The colliery, sir.

673
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:29,738
- All right, the colliery it is.
- Good.

674
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:38,270
- Where are you going?
- To get drunk.

675
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,741
Bron?

676
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:50,629
- I am going down the colliery.
- The colliery, is it?

677
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:55,029
The old coal will be shaking in its seam.

678
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:02,661
Bron...

679
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:07,628
Bron.

680
01:23:07,710 --> 01:23:11,828
Would you have me to live
in this house, and have my wages?

681
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:15,580
- Your home is with your mother.
- It was she who sent me.

682
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:19,388
- From pity.
- No, from sense.

683
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:23,383
If you put clothes night and morning,
let them be my clothes.

684
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:28,259
- Good old man.
- Yes or no, Bron?

685
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:32,789
- Yes.
- Good.

686
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:36,184
Good. I will get my bed.

687
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:09,986
- So it is a man now, is it?
- And could I carry such a man?

688
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:12,300
Lanto! No.

689
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,625
Five shillings.

690
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,779
Seven and tuppence.

691
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:34,828
- Move along.
- Thank you, sir.

692
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:37,505
Three shillings.

693
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:41,065
Two and nine.

694
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,779
One pound two.

695
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:47,501
Two pounds ten.

696
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:49,979
Discharged, Morgan.

697
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:53,101
Move along.

698
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:56,341
Two pound ten.

699
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:58,819
Discharged, Morgan.

700
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:04,661
One pound ten.

701
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:21,379
And so it came to lanto and Davy,
the best workers in the colliery,

702
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:25,861
but too highly paid to compete
with poorer, more desperate men.

703
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:06,860
- Will you read us a chapter, Father?
- Yes, my son.

704
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:13,342
"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."

705
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,342
"He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures:

706
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:19,149
He leadeth me beside the still waters."

707
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:21,425
"He restoreth my soul:

708
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:25,549
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake."

709
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:28,986
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

710
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:32,779
I will fear no evil: For thou art with me."

711
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:36,260
"Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."

712
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:40,662
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies:

713
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:43,344
Thou anointest my head with oil."

714
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:55,703
"My cup runneth over."

715
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:14,581
One line to Owen and Gwil,
down to Cape Town to Angharad.

716
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:18,942
Over here to Canada to lanto,

717
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:22,261
and down here to Davy in New Zealand.

718
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:26,909
And you are the star,
shining on them from this house,

719
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:29,504
all the way across the continents and oceans.

720
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:31,501
All the way?

721
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:36,380
How far am I shining then, if you can
put it all on a little piece of paper?

722
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:40,941
Now, a map it is, my old beauty. A picture
of the world to show you where they are.

723
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:46,104
I know where they are, without any old maps,
or scratches, or spiders, or pencils.

724
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:51,219
They are in the house.

725
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:15,383
Then Angharad came back
from Cape Town without her husband.

726
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:19,588
She did not come to us,
but stayed at the big Evans house.

727
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:22,059
Her house, on top of the hill.

728
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:40,824
- To see Mrs Evans, please.
- Who is it?

729
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,901
Huw Morgan.

730
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:49,499
Her brother, is it?

731
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:52,425
Come in.

732
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:03,145
Huw.

733
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:10,945
Mrs Nicholas,
will you bring some tea, please?

734
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:19,221
Sit down, Huw.

735
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:23,505
There is grown you are.

736
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:25,979
- And changed.
- You too.

737
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:31,461
I look ill and ought to take care of myself.

738
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:37,625
Everyone coming in the house says so,
so you say it too, and let us finish with it.

739
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:39,905
But tell me all the news.

740
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:42,185
How is...

741
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:47,022
How are all the boys
and girls we used to know?

742
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:51,461
Well...

743
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:54,779
The Jenkins girls are married.

744
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:58,464
Maldwyn Hughes has gone to be a doctor.

745
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:04,910
Rhys Howell is in a solicitor's office,
and is sending home ten shillings a week.

746
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:08,825
And Mr Gruffydd...

747
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:11,504
is still first up and last to bed.

748
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:15,660
How is he, Huw?

749
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:18,059
Not as he was.

750
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:21,460
Is he ill?

751
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:23,700
Inside.

752
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:27,021
In his eyes and in his voice.

753
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:32,545
Like you.

754
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:36,786
Please go home, Huw.

755
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:47,342
- I'm sorry.
- Now then, Mrs Evans. Tea, is it?

756
01:31:57,990 --> 01:32:00,948
Leave it, Mrs Nicholas. I will pour.

757
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,861
Well.

758
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:06,545
I always did the pouring
for Mr lestyn's poor mother.

759
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:11,219
- I will pour.
- Yes, Mrs Evans.

760
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:17,105
A new mistress is like new sheets.

761
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:20,182
Yes. A little bit stiff,

762
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:23,859
but washing's to come.

763
01:32:26,190 --> 01:32:28,385
Why do you have her here?

764
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:32,020
37 years with the family.

765
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:34,180
Or so she tells me 60 times a day.

766
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:37,622
- Have some tea, Huw.
- You don't want me to go?

767
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:41,820
No. No, Huw.

768
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:44,665
I'm sorry for being nasty.

769
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:46,980
Please stay.

770
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:50,908
Huw. I tried to tell Mother, but...

771
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:59,145
Not for me to say.

772
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:01,983
Only the housekeeper I am.

773
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:04,504
37 years in the family,

774
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:06,979
and living to curse the day.

775
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:14,304
It will not surprise me any day to see
the old master rise from his grave.

776
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:19,262
'Tis only the gravestone
holding him down, I will swear.

777
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:21,659
Then what is it, Mrs Nicholas?

778
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,341
Divorce.

779
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:39,785
Divorce.

780
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:46,227
Saying nothing, I am.
But that is what is in her mind.

781
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:49,459
She is here without her husband, is it?

782
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:53,623
And why? It is because
she is in love with this preacher.

783
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:58,184
Preacher, I said. Mr Gruffydd, it is.

784
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:01,068
But Mr Gruffydd has not been near the house.

785
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:03,664
What difference is that, girl?

786
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:06,139
Get on with your work.

787
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:09,945
We will not say a word, Mrs Nicholas.

788
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:12,021
No.

789
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:22,179
You're a filthy liar!

790
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:34,228
- Let up!
- Let me at him!

791
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,621
Liar!

792
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:04,544
As the slag had spread over my valley,

793
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:08,828
so now a blackness spread
over the minds of its people.

794
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:14,143
For the first time in my memory,
our front door was shut tight in the daytime.

795
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:33,101
Dadda?

796
01:35:35,550 --> 01:35:37,620
Well, Huw?

797
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:40,508
Trouble with the Philistines, is it?

798
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:43,468
Huw, what is it now? Look at your hands.

799
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:48,345
Evan John.

800
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:53,022
He... he said things
about Angharad and Mr Gruffydd.

801
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:57,185
Children too.

802
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:03,219
You were right, my son.

803
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:17,620
- I will be back for breakfast.
- You will not go to chapel?

804
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:19,701
No.

805
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:31,628
And if they do this thing,

806
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:35,498
I will never set foot
in the chapel again as long as I live.

807
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:39,064
I will have the sheets warm on your bed.

808
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:44,460
- There is an old beauty you are.
- Go and scratch, boy.

809
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:58,704
What is this about the chapel, Mother?

810
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:02,378
Tonight, after the service.

811
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:05,143
A deacons' meeting over Angharad.

812
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:08,461
Angharad? But she has done nothing.

813
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:12,543
Nothing is enough for people
who have minds like cesspools.

814
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:17,228
Huw, my little one.

815
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:21,508
I hope when you're grown,
their tongues will be slower to hurt.

816
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:27,780
- Will Angharad have to be at the meeting?
- No. None of us will be there.

817
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:30,384
But the disgrace will not stay away.

818
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:33,385
I will go, Mother.

819
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:18,618
This is the last time I will talk in this chapel.

820
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:26,067
I am leaving the valley with regret

821
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:30,582
toward those who have helped me here,

822
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:34,740
and who have let me help them.

823
01:38:38,230 --> 01:38:40,221
But...

824
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:44,219
for the rest of you,

825
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:50,379
those of you who have only proved
that I have wasted my time among you,

826
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:53,109
I have only this to say.

827
01:38:53,190 --> 01:38:56,102
There is not one among you
who has had the courage

828
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:59,387
to come to me and accuse me of wrongdoing.

829
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:02,064
And yet, by any standard,
if there has been a sin,

830
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:05,347
I am the one who
should be branded the sinner.

831
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:10,106
Will anyone raise his voice
here now to accuse me?

832
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:15,701
No.

833
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,542
You're cowards, too, as well as hypocrites.

834
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:23,783
But I don't blame you.

835
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:26,942
The fault is mine as much as yours.

836
01:39:28,910 --> 01:39:31,026
The idle tongues,

837
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:35,863
the poverty of mind which you have shown,

838
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:42,069
mean that I have failed to reach most
of you with the lesson I was given to teach.

839
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:45,341
Huw?

840
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:52,382
I thought when I was a young man
that I would conquer the world, with truth.

841
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:58,907
I thought I would lead an army
greater than Alexander ever dreamed of.

842
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:05,980
Not to conquer nations,
but to liberate mankind.

843
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:09,059
- Yes, sir.
- With truth.

844
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:12,985
With the golden sound of the Word.

845
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:17,139
But only a few of them heard.

846
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:21,303
Only a few of you understood.

847
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:25,427
The rest of you
put on black and sat in chapel.

848
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:28,940
Why do you come here?

849
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:35,024
Why do you dress your hypocrisy in black
and parade before your God on Sunday?

850
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:40,909
From love? No. For you've shown
that your hearts are too withered

851
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:43,663
to receive the love of your divine Father.

852
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:46,748
I know why you've come.

853
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:51,426
I've seen it in your faces Sunday after
Sunday as I've stood here before you.

854
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:55,822
Fear has brought you here.
Horrible, superstitious fear.

855
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:58,583
Fear of divine retribution.

856
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:01,990
A bolt of fire from the skies,

857
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:05,665
the vengeance of the Lord,
and the justice of God.

858
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:11,348
But you have forgotten the love of Jesus.

859
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:15,659
You disregard his sacrifice.

860
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:19,380
Death. Fear.

861
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:24,669
Flames, horror, and black clothes.
Hold your meeting, then.

862
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:28,425
But know if you do this in the name
of God, and in the house of God,

863
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:31,308
you blaspheme against him and his Word.

864
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:41,381
Wait. There is a meeting, Master Morgan.

865
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:58,940
Well, Huw.

866
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:02,223
- I'm glad you've come.
- Thank you, sir.

867
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:06,018
Is there anything I can do?

868
01:42:06,110 --> 01:42:08,465
Indeed there is.

869
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:10,939
You can do me a great service.

870
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:14,858
This watch.

871
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:18,147
My father gave it to me
when I entered the ministry.

872
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:21,459
It's marked time we've both loved.

873
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:25,590
- Take it.
- No, sir.

874
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:29,470
A service, I said you'd be doing me.

875
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:34,422
No need for us to shake hands.

876
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:37,104
We will live in the minds of each other.

877
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:44,949
Mr Gruffydd, won't you
see Angharad before you go?

878
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:48,579
She wants you to.

879
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:54,701
No.

880
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:58,219
If I were to see her again,

881
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:03,188
I couldn't find the strength to leave her.

882
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:08,981
Goodbye, Huw.

883
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:11,584
And there's a good old man you are.

884
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:39,298
What is it now? Fire, or flood, or what?

885
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:41,460
A cave-in, they are saying.

886
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:45,668
- Take me up there.
- What good in the darkness of a mine?

887
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:49,345
Your eyes are no good in daylight
from the blows you've taken in the ring.

888
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:54,185
I can still swing a pick deeper than any man.
Take me up there.

889
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:34,866
Men. Men. Women.
Those of you with relatives.

890
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:37,339
Let them to the pit.

891
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:43,900
- Gwilym Morgan?
- Not yet, sir.

892
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:46,629
Mr Gruffydd? On the lower level, he was.

893
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:21,499
- My father?
- Not yet, Mrs Evans.

894
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:34,060
Angharad...

895
01:46:44,110 --> 01:46:46,578
Who is for Gwilym Morgan and the others?

896
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:50,546
I for one. He is the blood of my heart.

897
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:54,620
Come, Cyfartha.

898
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:57,270
'Tis a coward I am.

899
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:59,739
But I will hold your coat.

900
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:21,869
Dadda!

901
01:48:56,790 --> 01:48:59,179
Dadda!

902
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:15,419
Dadda!

903
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:23,940
Huw, lad.

904
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:39,941
Dadda!

905
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:10,500
- Dadda!
- Huw.

906
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:16,581
Mr Gruffydd!

907
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:26,019
There's a good old man you are.

908
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:37,179
He came to me just now.

909
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:40,019
Ivor was with him.

910
01:50:41,190 --> 01:50:43,385
He spoke to me,

911
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:46,189
and told me of the glory he had seen.

912
01:51:01,190 --> 01:51:03,181
Look.

913
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:53,987
Men like my father cannot die.

914
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:58,985
They are with me still,
real in memory as they were in flesh,

915
01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:01,743
loving and beloved for ever.

916
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:03,786
How green was my valley then.

917
01:52:04,305 --> 01:53:04,586
