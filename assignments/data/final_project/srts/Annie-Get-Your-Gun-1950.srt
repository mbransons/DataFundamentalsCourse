some of the atmosphere"

00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:14,608
Introducing the world's
greatest sharpshooter, Mr. Frank Butler!

18

00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,930
Good afternoon.

42
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,169
What's going on here? Indians!

43
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,285
What do you think you're doing?

44
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:40,046
I'm busy now.
You'll have to make an appointment.

45
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:42,168
Stop that!

46
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:43,692
My good man....

47
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,131
Do you suggest we keep the people
of this town in ignorance...

48
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,726
...about the grandest show on earth?

49
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:52,408
I suggest you clear out. This is my hotel
and I'll have no signs tacked up.

50
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,767
You must be....

51
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:55,247
Don't tell me.

52
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:56,483
Mr. Wilson.

53
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:58,843
How do you do, sir?
This is a great pleasure.

54
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,412
Allow me to introduce myself.

55
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:03,371
I'm Charles Davenport,
personal manager for Buffalo Bill Cody.

56
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:04,522
Glad to know you, but--

57
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:07,730
When we hold our shooting match,
everybody will be here watching.

58
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:09,405
It's the greatest advertising.

59
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:10,323
What match?

60
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:13,086
Frank Butler against your local shot.
We do it in every town.

61
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:16,768
Not here you don't. This is my lawn
and you're not holding any match on it.

62
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:20,482
-We're taking 10 of your rooms.
-For a lot of cowboys and Indians?

63
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:22,643
For the headliners.
Indians sleep in the lobby.

64
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:23,927
Indians! Oh, boy!

65
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:26,163
I don't want any actors.
I just had Pawnee Bill...

66
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:30,007
...and his Far East Show. Some of them
chased my guests on horseback.

67
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:31,446
Now, take your stuff and get.

68
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:33,524
Nice lawn you got here.
I'll rent it from you.

69
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,126
-$25 for the afternoon.
-No.

70
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,322
-$50.
-No.

71
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:39,212
-How about $50 in cash and two squaws?
-No, no.

72
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:41,529
-How about 50 squaws and $2 in cash?
-No!

73
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:42,842
-No?
-No!

74
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:44,889
No, kid. I'll feed you to the Indians.

75
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,565
Indians. Oh, boy.

76
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:52,771
Looks a little small for a contest.

77
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,366
-You don't like it?
-Not much.

78
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:55,852
Good, because you haven't got it.

79
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,764
-Who says so?
-He does.

80
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,842
Get that horse out of here.

81
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,605
He seems to think it's his hotel.

82
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:06,082
-Did you mention my name?
-He stood up under it.

83
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,971
-Here's some passes for the show.
-Thanks, Frank.

84
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:13,327
Don't miss my entrance.

85
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:15,643
All right, Frank. Don't forget dinner now.

86
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,963
-I'll be there.
-I'll send the carriage.

87
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,527
Goodbye.

88
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:25,246
-I'm Frank Butler.
-You've got nowhere to sleep

89
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,370
Wait a minute. I'm here to do you a favor.

90
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:30,564
I'll give you a chance to win $100.

91
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:31,809
Yeah, how?

92
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:35,169
Just get the local champion up
and I'll give you a side bet of $100...

93
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:36,845
...against 10 rooms for our actors.

94
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:37,843
No, sir.

95
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,252
Clear all this off the porch
before I call the marshal.

96
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,166
-You sure charmed him.
-We don't need him.

97
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:46,811
Tell the boys to start packing.

98
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:49,532
-We'll do the match at the fairground.
-Yes, your majesty.

99
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:52,047
-See you later.
-Yes, your majesty.

100
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,253
All right, start loading up.
We're moving back to town.

101
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,567
I'll go back and break the good news
to Buffalo Bill.

102
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:04,207
Hey, Dolly! Dolly!

103
00:07:04,653 --> 00:07:05,972
Dolly, come on. We're moving.

104
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:09,443
Moving?
I'm not moving again for anybody!

105
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:12,206
All right. You stay here
and come back in with the boys.

106
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:25,965
I've been shot!

107
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:28,008
Indians!

108
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:30,608
Indians!

109
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:35,201
That's my bird.

110
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,812
Did you fire that shot?

111
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:39,482
It wasn't nothing.

112
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:42,167
It wasn't nothing?
You could have killed me!

113
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,562
-Give me that bird.
-It's mine. I shot it.

114
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:46,564
You shot it right off my hat.

115
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,366
How did it get up there?

116
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:51,045
I sewed it up there.

117
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,852
What for? It ain't no good.
Ain't got no meat on it.

118
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,047
It's not an eating bird. It's a wearing bird.

119
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:01,644
All right. But around these parts,
you'll have to keep sewing it on...

120
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,610
...because folks will keep shooting it off.

121
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,092
You've ruined it!

122
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:07,643
Yeah, it sure looks beat, ma'am.

123
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,732
Here, have one of mine.

124
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:11,769
Get that filthy thing away from me!

125
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:16,485
She ain't filthy. She looks better than you,
and she's got a bullet in her head.

126
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,647
-I heard shooting.
-This creature tried to murder me.

127
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,371
-Is that gun loaded?
-Sure.

128
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:22,806
But I can empty it quick.

129
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,282
Wait for me!

130
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:28,488
I wouldn't have really shot her.

131
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,251
That's mighty civilized of you.

132
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:34,329
A fellow down the road tells me
this here's a boarding hotel.

133
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,482
What if it is?

134
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:37,604
Maybe you and me can do some trading.

135
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:41,209
-What have you got to trade?
-I got quails, wild ducks, some grouses--

136
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:43,011
No, I can get all the game I want.

137
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:46,881
When folks eat the kind of game you get,
they keep spitting out buckshot.

138
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:48,452
Teeth, sometimes, too.

139
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,042
Mine's different.

140
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:56,012
Come on out, now.
The man won't chase you.

141
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:59,682
Come on. It's all right. Honest.

142
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:05,049
Kid sisters and little brother
ain't used to people yet.

143
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:07,522
They never been out of Dark County before.

144
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:09,604
Come on.

145
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:12,127
Shake your tails!
The man's waiting on you.

146
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:18,092
Hurry up! He can't wait all day.

147
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,881
They look a little dusty, don't they?

148
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:31,212
We're in business together.

149
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:34,330
I pop them, she plucks them,
she picks them, and she pulls them.

150
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:35,243
Who is he?

151
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,449
Little Jake? He's my bird dog.

152
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:41,369
Jake, stop your sniffing.
What you got a sleeve for?

153
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:45,044
Here you are, mister. Look it over.

154
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:46,727
Lift up its wings.

155
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:50,562
No buckshot in that bird,
just one little tiny hole in its head.

156
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:52,565
Mighty pretty shooting.

157
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,285
It's mighty pretty eating, too.

158

312
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:36,973
Now, without further ado,
it gives me great pleasure...

313
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,487
...and it is a great privilege
to introduce to you...

314
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,052
...Colonel William F. Cody...

315
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,727
...loved by you all
and known to you all as:

316
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:45,212
Buffalo Bill!

317
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:54,088
My young friends,
it always gives me great pleasure...

318
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,211
...to return to my favorite state, Ohio.

319
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:01,282
I am here today to referee a contest
of fancy shooting...

320
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,007
...between the best marksman
your county offers...

321
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:08,890
...and one of the greatest sharpshooters
the world has ever known.

322
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,132
Frank Butler!

323
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,243
Aided and abetted by his...

324
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:25,525
...charming assistant, Miss Dolly Tate.

325
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,842
Is Mr. Butler's opponent here?

326
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:34,204
-Is the contestant ready?
-Yes, sir.

327
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,009
Good.

328
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,924
Ladies and gentlemen...

329
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:40,528
...prepare yourselves
for the thrill of a lifetime.

330
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,887
Two men of steel pitted against each other
in a savage struggle...

331
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:47,203
...of skill and stamina.

332
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:50,567
What's his name?

333
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,286
-What's his name?
-Annie.

334
00:21:53,893 --> 00:21:55,008
Annie!

335
00:21:58,093 --> 00:21:59,606
What's so funny?

336
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:04,087
Are you trying to make a fool of us?
Frank Butler can't shoot against a girl.

337
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:06,482
-You said anyone, didn't you?
-Yes, I know I did.

338
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:09,246
-Are you afraid of a little girl?
-No, it isn't that, but--

339
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,561
She might fool you.

340
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:13,849
-What will we do, B.B.?
-Nothing.

341
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:17,289
The little lady accepted the challenge.
She is entitled to her chance.

342
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,731
Are you really Buffalo Bill?

343
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:23,246
Why, yes, little lady.

344
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:24,602
I'm Annie Oakley.

345
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:27,765
Miss Oakley, I am honored.

346
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,367
You are?

347
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:33,882
Frank, your opponent is ready.

348
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:36,648
Howdy.

349
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,971
I told you I'd see you here.

350
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:46,286
You didn't tell me you were
the big swollen-headed stiff.

351
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:58,089
Ain't we got a tablecloth somewhere?

352
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:07,125
-Are you ready, Mr. Butler?
-Ready!

353
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:08,487
Are you ready, my dear?

354
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:10,643
-Yeah, but what're we shooting at?
-Birds.

355
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:11,529
Birds?

356
00:23:12,053 --> 00:23:14,009
Where are they? I don't see any birds.

357
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:17,285
These are clay birds, my dear.
They come out of a trap, in front.

358
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:20,405
The contest will continue
until the first miss.

359
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:23,128
When you are ready, my dear,
just say "pull."

360
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:24,163
Pull?

361
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:25,009
Pull!

362
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:32,682
Hit!

363
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:35,683
Pull.

364
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:43,203
It's wonderful!
They got a gadget out there.

365
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,130
All you have to do is holler "pull."

366
00:23:50,693 --> 00:23:51,364
Hit!

367
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:56,372
I don't want any advantage.
Here, honey. Try this one.

368
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:00,647
Dolly, the mirror.

369
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:09,530
Pull!

370
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:10,722
Watch this.

371
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:13,208
Hit!

372
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:20,604
Pull.

373
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,009
Hit!

374
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:32,844
Pull.

375
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:35,208
Hit!

376
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:40,762
Pull!

377
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:42,888
Hit!

378
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:48,888
Pull!

379
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,206
-Hit!
-Pull!

380
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:52,850
Hit!

381
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:53,843
Pull!

382
00:24:54,613 --> 00:24:55,841
-Hit!
-Pull!

383
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,008
-Hit!
-Pull!

384
00:24:59,093 --> 00:25:00,128
-Hit!
-Pull!

385
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:01,609
Hit!

386
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:07,932
Double. Pull.

387
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:10,763
Hit!

388
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:14,923
Pull.

389
00:25:16,653 --> 00:25:17,483
Hit!

390
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:22,648
Quadruple.

391
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:24,963
Pull.

392
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:30,169
Hit.

393
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:34,928
Quindruple!

394
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:37,563
Five!

395
00:25:39,293 --> 00:25:39,964
Pull!

396
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:48,963
Five.

397
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:50,764
Pull!

398
00:25:56,053 --> 00:26:00,569
I declare Miss Annie Oakley
winner of this contest!

399
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,924
Where's my money? Where's my money?

400
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,362
Nice work.

401
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:19,207
Thanks. It wasn't nothing.
It was easy as pie.

402
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:21,689
I'm sorry.

403
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:24,287
What are you sorry about?
You're just good, that's all.

404
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:25,852
You ain't mad at me, are you?

405
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:28,163
Why, of course not.
Anybody can miss a shot.

406
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:29,607
I can't.

407
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:33,123
Excuse me.

408
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,929
Here's your $5, Annie. I'm proud of you.

409
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,128
Thanks, Mr. Wilson.

410
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:38,612
Where you going now, Annie?

411
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:41,366
I don't know.
Back to Dark County, I guess.

412
00:26:42,293 --> 00:26:44,011
He sure is pretty.

413
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:47,204
-Goodbye, Annie.
-Goodbye, Mr. Wilson.

414
00:26:47,413 --> 00:26:48,892
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

415
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:52,090
You kids get on and get the supplies now.
Hurry on.

416
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,803
I tell you, my boy. She'd be a sensation.

417
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:57,202
They've never seen a girl
who could shoot like that.

418
00:26:57,293 --> 00:27:01,081
What makes you think she's so great?
She couldn't do it again in a million years.

419
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:02,970
We haven't got a million years!

420
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:05,328
If business keeps like this,
we'll have to fold up.

421
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:06,971
Pawnee Bill's beating us everywhere.

422
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:09,169
-She'd be a novelty.
-I don't want any partners.

423
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,766
We'll make her your assistant.

424
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,844
Once in a while,
you'll let her take a potshot.

425
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,367
You could break her in. And you know...

426
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:17,404
...she's quite a pretty girl.

427
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:21,245
She's all right. Of course,
she looks terrible now...

428
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:24,571
...but we could dress her up.
She couldn't look worse than Dolly.

429
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:27,451
She wouldn't be willing to join us
just to hand me things.

430
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,402
-Yes, I would, Mr. Butler!
-Well, look at here.

431
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:34,885
I'd be willing to hand you anything,
just so I could be near you.

432
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,604
You ever been away from home before?

433
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:44,007
Do I got to leave home?

434
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:47,529
I think you'd find that quite fascinating.
We travel all over the country.

435
00:27:47,613 --> 00:27:49,968
Certainly. Have you ever been
on a railroad train?

436
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:53,686
-You know anything about show business?
-Show business?

437
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:54,922
What's that?

438
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:56,492
What's show business?

439
00:27:57,013 --> 00:28:00,244
"The cowboys, the wrestlers,
the tumblers, the clowns

440
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,332
"The roustabouts
that move the show at dawn

441
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:07,209
"The music, the spotlights,
the people, the towns

442
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:09,887
"Your baggage with the labels pasted on

443
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:14,646
"The sawdust, the horses and the smell

444
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:19,849
"The towel you've taken from the last hotel

445

"There's no business

446
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:26,969
"Like no business I know

447
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:30,090
"Everything about it is appealing

00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,648
"Everything the traffic will allow

00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,043
"Nowhere could you have
that happy feeling

457

"You may be stranded out in the cold

473
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:05,771
"Still you wouldn't change it
for a sack of gold

474
00:30:05,893 --> 00:30:08,930
"Let's go on with the show

475
00:30:09,093 --> 00:30:14,690
"Let's go on with the show"

476
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:11,846
Who gave you Indians permission
to use this car?

477
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:12,922
Annie Oke.

478
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:15,163
I might have known it.

479
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:20,326
Mrs. Little Horse, this is our car
and this is my section.

480
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:22,888
And I'll thank you
not to do your laundry in it.

481
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:26,164
Look at this place. It's a disgrace!

482
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:27,883
Sharp.

483
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:33,044
This is what I mean, Mr. Davenport.
Look at this car. The woodwork!

484
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:35,601
Hey, you Indians,
stop that cutting that thing up.

485
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:37,763
Look what they've done
to our curtains here!

486
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:42,162
-Looks like the Battle of Bull Run, don't it?
-They've done $100 worth of damage.

487
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:45,007
Who told you Indians
you could pitch a village in here?

488
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:47,766
I did. They're only sitting
till the smoke clears.

489
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:49,525
-What smoke?
-Back in their coach.

490
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:52,605
They was cooking a little supper
and they had a small fire.

491
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:53,967
A small fire!

492
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:59,007
All right, you Indians break up camp
and get back to your car. Hurry up. Go on.

493
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,851
Come on now. Get.

494
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:04,328
What gets into you?

495
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:06,973
I'm sorry, Charlie. I don't mean anything.

496
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,602
And I want to apologize for Little Jake
and the girls unhitching the caboose.

497
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:13,123
If they only hadn't done it on a hill.

498
00:33:14,053 --> 00:33:17,125
I cut this out of the paper. It's about you.

499
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:19,204
About me? Thanks.

500
00:33:20,493 --> 00:33:23,565
First call for supper.

501
00:33:35,573 --> 00:33:37,643
That was a close call. Are you all right?

502
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:38,529
Yeah.

503
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:43,371
Come back. While they're eating,
we'll have our reading lesson.

504
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:44,283
Now?

505
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,529
Yes, now. Have you got your book?

506
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:51,687
Let's see, now.

507
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:56,647
What's that word?

508
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:00,651
Are you sure that's a word?

509
00:34:00,733 --> 00:34:04,248
How can I learn you
if you don't do no homework?

510
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,086
You've got to learn me,
and you've got to learn me fast.

511
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:09,892
What would Frank think
if he knew I couldn't read?

512
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,728
I know what it is. It's "the."

513
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:15,047
Keep going.

514
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:23,168
The boy had a dog.

515
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:24,807
Go on.

516
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:31,486
The dog's name were, was....

517
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:33,772
What's that, Jake?

518
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:35,367
Sound it out.

519
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:45,085
Now that I did it, what is it?

520
00:34:45,173 --> 00:34:46,083
Frank.

521
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:50,089
Frank. That's a pretty name.

522
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:56,171
The boy's name was...

523
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:05,444
...S-T-E-P-H-E-N.

524
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:07,372
What's that, Jake?

525
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:12,843
Joe.

526
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:15,963
That seems an awful lot for just Joe.

527
00:35:16,173 --> 00:35:19,688
Reading's kind of funny sometimes.
Come on.

528
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:25,569
The dog was....

529
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:37,165
Bless you. Not catching cold, are you?

530
00:35:37,253 --> 00:35:40,131
No, I'm just trying to learn Little Jake
his reading lesson.

531
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:42,648
I sure am thick-headed, ain't I, Annie?

532
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:45,293
You get along into the eating car
and have your supper.

533
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:47,807
Annie reads good. Show him, Annie.
Start here.

534
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:50,407
You get along now. Get. Get.

535
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:58,043
Charlie gave me this newspaper clipping.
Would you like to read it?

536
00:35:58,133 --> 00:35:59,646
No, you read it to me.

537
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:03,849
You read it. I want to hear
how it sounds when you speak it.

538
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:08,373
"Butler's assistant,
whose name isn't on the program...

539
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:12,162
"...performed only one trick, but
she promises to become a fine marksman."

540
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:15,406
That's nice of that paper man.

541
00:36:15,493 --> 00:36:17,529
People are beginning to notice you, Annie.

542
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:19,444
I told Charlie to put you on the billboard.

543
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:20,568
-You did?
-Yes.

544
00:36:20,653 --> 00:36:23,725
I got a real fancy trick I've been practicing
to surprise you with.

545
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:24,643
What is it?

546
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:27,884
I can't tell you. It's a surprise.

547
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:33,008
That's fine. I like you to be ambitious.
I want you to improve.

548
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:35,132
But it'll take some time.

549
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:39,571
All I want to be is a pink and white lady
like the kind you said you liked.

550
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:42,168
You're getting pinker and whiter every day.

551
00:36:42,253 --> 00:36:43,971
That ain't pig-wash, is it?

552
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:46,733
What would you say
if someday I make you my partner?

553
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,052
Oh, Frank!

554
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:50,967
Butler and Oakley.

555
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:54,403
I never thought I'd ask a girl
to be my partner.

556
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:55,926
Oakley and Butler.

557
00:36:57,693 --> 00:36:59,012
Butler and Oakley.

558
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:01,092
What's the difference?

559
00:37:01,213 --> 00:37:03,727
You've got to do it in alphabetical order.

560
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:09,690
You know, there's gonna be
a wishing moon out tonight.

561
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:14,326
Back home,
I used to wish for a lot of things...

562
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:17,086
...but lately, they sure have been
catching up to me.

563
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:21,286
You ever love anybody?

564
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:24,166
-You mean, somebody who loved me back?
-Yeah.

565
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:27,531
That I ain't. But I hear tell about it.

566
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:37,290
"They say that falling in love is wonderful

567
00:37:38,813 --> 00:37:42,806
"It's wonderful

568
00:37:44,173 --> 00:37:47,051
"So they say

569
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:55,049
"And with a moon up above it's wonderful

570
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:59,850
"It's wonderful

571
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:03,885
"So they tell me

572
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:08,164
"I can't recall who said it

573
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:12,083
"I know I never read it

574
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:20,413
"I only know they tell me that love is grand

575
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:22,565
"And

576
00:38:24,653 --> 00:38:31,047
"the thing that's known as romance
is wonderful

577
00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:36,131
"Wonderful

578
00:38:39,573 --> 00:38:42,929
"In every way

579
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:49,011
"So they say

580
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:57,723
"Rumors fly and they often leave a doubt

581
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:04,052
"But you've come to the right place
to find out

582
00:39:04,973 --> 00:39:11,765
"Everything that you've heard is really so

583
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:16,884
"I've been there once or twice

584
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:21,808
"And I should know

585
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:29,605
"You'll find that falling in love is wonderful

586
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:36,570
"It's wonderful as they say

587
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:44,930
"And with a moon up above it's wonderful

588
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:51,690
"It's wonderful as they tell you

589
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,692
"You leave your house some morning

590
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:58,566
"And without any warning

591
00:39:58,653 --> 00:40:05,445
"You're stopping people shouting
that love is grand

592
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,725
"And

593
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:17,968
"To hold a man in your arms is wonderful

594
00:40:19,893 --> 00:40:23,090
"Wonderful

00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:29,803
"In every way

596
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:36,683
"I should say"

597
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:11,685
Well, it's getting on to bedtime.

598
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:25,287
Well, I better mosey on back to my car.

599
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:27,250
Do you mind if I walk you home?

600
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,846
You better go on to bed.

601
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,725
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

602
00:41:34,373 --> 00:41:36,364
Hurry, ladies and gentleman.

603
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:41,205
Charlie, my boy. Something is wrong.

604
00:41:41,493 --> 00:41:44,132
Here we've been parading around
all morning and....

605
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:47,571
How do you do, my dear?
And still the customers don't come.

606
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:49,803
-Maybe you need some new attractions.
-No.

607
00:41:49,933 --> 00:41:54,051
What we need is just one good attraction.
Something that'll make them sit up and...

608
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:56,972
...take notice.

609
00:41:57,573 --> 00:41:59,962
Pawnee Bill! The two-timing,
double-crossing--

610
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:01,566
That's where all your business is.

611
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:03,484
St. Paul! That's just next door!

612
00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:05,484
He's been doing it to us across the country.

613
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:07,529
But this time he won't get away with it!

614
00:42:07,613 --> 00:42:09,046
-Who's gonna stop him?
-I am.

615
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:11,886
I've got an idea. Come on.
Let's see Annie.

616
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:16,203
Remember that stunt
you've been practicing?

617
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:20,569
Charlie and I thought that
this afternoon you might....

618
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,689
Well, that's a very good stunt.

619
00:42:25,453 --> 00:42:28,729
What he means is he wants you to do it
in the show this afternoon.

620
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,725
I couldn't do that. Frank might not like it.

621
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:35,601
Of course he would. lt'll surprise him.
You like him, don't you?

622
00:42:35,693 --> 00:42:37,012
I like him a heap.

623
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:38,606
Has he asked you to marry him?

624
00:42:38,693 --> 00:42:41,651
Not yet. He ain't broke out
in a cold sweat enough for that.

625
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:45,567
That's why we're doing this for you.
This is your big chance. You'll dazzle him.

626
00:42:45,653 --> 00:42:47,723
When you walk in front of that audience...

627
00:42:47,813 --> 00:42:50,532
...in that beautiful new costume
with the music under you...

628
00:42:50,613 --> 00:42:53,525
...and you try that new trick
that you've been saving for him--

629
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,332
He'll be so proud of me,
he'll bust out in that cold sweat!

630
00:42:56,693 --> 00:42:59,765
-Charlie, Buffalo! Wait till I tell him!
-Wait. Now, look!

631
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:01,252
We want to surprise him.

632
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:05,121
He'll expect you to do that old trick where
you shoot the egg off the poodle's head.

633
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:08,523
Instead, you come on...

634
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:10,492
...you do the new trick...

635
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:14,088
...you save the show, and you marry Frank!

636
00:43:14,253 --> 00:43:15,971
Just like in a fairytale!

637
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:17,805
Are you sure he'll like it?

638
00:43:18,493 --> 00:43:20,802
Yes. I think he will.

639
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:23,886
Mr. Frank Butler is in for a real surprise.

640
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:34,013
Look at that business.
This'll fix that Pawnee Bill.

641
00:43:34,093 --> 00:43:36,687
When word spreads about Annie,
he won't have customers...

642
00:43:36,773 --> 00:43:38,286
...to play a two-handed poker game.

643
00:43:38,373 --> 00:43:39,692
You're right, B.B.

644
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:43,289
The dirty, two-timing, double-crossing...

645
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,489
...treacherous, thieving, stealing--

646
00:43:45,573 --> 00:43:46,801
Well, Buffalo Bill.

647
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:50,124
Well, Pawnee Bill, my old pal.

648
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:52,284
You are a sight for sore eyes.

649
00:43:52,373 --> 00:43:55,410
We were just talking about you,
weren't we? Just this minute.

650
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:57,085
We don't see enough of you.

651
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:59,050
I've been a little bit lonely, too.

652
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:01,323
In the past six months,
if you wanted to see us...

653
00:44:01,413 --> 00:44:03,563
...all you had to do was
turn around and spit.

654
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:07,489
Same old Charlie. Haven't changed a bit.

655
00:44:08,573 --> 00:44:10,882
You haven't met Big Chief Sitting Bull,
have you?

656
00:44:11,413 --> 00:44:12,812
No, I haven't.

657
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:19,204
Sure. Everybody knows
Big Chief Sitting Bull...

658
00:44:19,413 --> 00:44:22,644
...who defeated General Custer
at the Battle of the Little Big Horn...

659
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:24,212
...and the man who tonight...

660
00:44:24,293 --> 00:44:27,205
...will be the guest of honor in St. Paul
of none other than...

661
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,522
...Pawnee Bill.

662
00:44:28,653 --> 00:44:31,963
All right, folks.
Now, don't lose your place in line.

663
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,323
The great Annie Oakley's on the inside.

664
00:44:34,413 --> 00:44:37,769
Annie Oakley. I'm anxious to see her.
I'll get some tickets.

665
00:44:37,853 --> 00:44:39,332
Hold on. I wouldn't have it.

666
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:42,371
Here are two passes
to my own private box.

667
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:45,565
Well, punched right through the center.

668
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:47,252
Annie Oakley shot them out.

669
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:51,286
We've got Annie Oakleys.
Well, I'll see you inside.

670
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:53,170
There you are, Chief. Come along.

671
00:44:55,013 --> 00:44:57,846
I better follow him.
He's likely to steal the benches.

672
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,047
How's business, Chief?
Going back on the warpath soon?

673
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:08,045
No. On way home from Washington.

674
00:45:08,493 --> 00:45:12,008
Go see Great White Father
about Indian territory.

675
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:15,370
They gave you a bad shuffle on that land.
Maybe you can farm it.

676
00:45:15,933 --> 00:45:19,448
Nothing will grow. Too much oil.

677
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:22,728
Fifty thousand barrel a day.

678
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,241
That's too bad, Chief.

679
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:28,289
How you gonna live? You can't eat oil.

680
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:31,930
-Tell you what I'm gonna do.
-No put money in show business.

681
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:33,571
-You can have a lot of fun.
-No.

682
00:45:33,653 --> 00:45:35,086
$20,000, Chief. We could--

683
00:45:35,173 --> 00:45:37,607
Sitting Bull live by three rules:

684
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,046
Keep bow tight.

685
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,812
Keep arrow sharp.

686
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:44,006
No put money in show business.

687
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,364
How'd we ever get the country
away from them?

688
00:45:50,093 --> 00:45:52,368
Hi, Charlie. Business looks....

689
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,091
-Who put that up there?
-It looks great, don't it?

690
00:45:57,653 --> 00:46:00,850
I told you to put her name someplace,
not to make a star out of her.

691
00:46:00,933 --> 00:46:04,005
That's ridiculous. She's only doing
a few little tricks, isn't she?

692
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:05,446
-Yes, Frank.
-Isn't she?

693
00:46:05,853 --> 00:46:06,649
Sure.

694
00:46:08,693 --> 00:46:10,968
I don't understand you.
You like her, don't you?

695
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:13,487
Sure I like her,
and I want to keep liking her.

696
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:15,564
-Where's Buffalo Bill?
-Inside.

697
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:28,723
Jumping buffalo!

698
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,052
It's me.

699
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:36,570
Have I been up there all the time?

700
00:46:36,813 --> 00:46:38,087
Do you like it?

701
00:46:39,373 --> 00:46:40,522
Like it?

702
00:46:41,213 --> 00:46:43,488
Oh, Charlie! I can't believe it.

703
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:46,252
Wait till Frank sees it!

704
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:49,162
-Yeah.
-Will you go get him, Charlie? Please.

705
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:07,807
"There's no business

706
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,968
"Like show business

707
00:47:13,773 --> 00:47:19,564

"All made up and soon you'll be appearing

709
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:30,762
"Every bit of nervousness is gone

710
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:34,051
"Then the sound that's music
to your hearing

711
00:47:34,213 --> 00:47:37,967
"To hear them cheering when you come on

712

how proud they'd be

what comes naturally

717

"Let's go on with the show"

718
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:08,268
What are you doing to me?
I've been here for four years...

719
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:09,834
...and you finally give me a spot.

720
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:11,667
Well, that's what we always had.

721
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:12,944
How about this?

722
00:48:13,035 --> 00:48:16,072
Frank, look up there.
Ain't I growed in the last few days?

723
00:48:16,155 --> 00:48:17,634
Yeah, shot up like a ragweed.

724
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,467
You know, I still can't believe it.

725
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:22,513
Don't try too hard,
because it ain't gonna be there next week.

726
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:24,392
-Why ain't it?
-That's show business.

727
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:26,830
The few tricks I gave you
don't rate a star billing.

728
00:48:26,915 --> 00:48:28,268
Even I don't get that.

729
00:48:28,835 --> 00:48:30,905
Someday, maybe,
but it's got to be gradual.

730
00:48:31,195 --> 00:48:33,914
-If that's the way you want it.
-That's the way I want it!

731
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:38,187
You ain't sore, are you?

732
00:48:42,955 --> 00:48:44,593
No, I'm not sore, honey.

733
00:48:45,395 --> 00:48:47,192
Be sure and watch me this afternoon.

734
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:49,994
Don't be nervous. You've done
the poodle trick many times.

735
00:48:50,075 --> 00:48:51,952
I know, but today I'm not gonna....

736
00:48:52,435 --> 00:48:53,868
I mean, I'm gonna....

737
00:48:55,955 --> 00:48:59,027
Wait until you see me out there
with the music and everything.

738
00:48:59,475 --> 00:49:00,908
Well, you'll....

739
00:49:01,195 --> 00:49:02,310
What will I do?

740
00:49:03,475 --> 00:49:05,750
You'll start to bust out in a cold sweat...

741
00:49:05,995 --> 00:49:09,192
...and then just like in a fairytale,
you'll be so proud of me...

742
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:12,267
...that you're gonna ask me
to do something and be somebody...

743
00:49:12,755 --> 00:49:14,507
...and I'm gonna do it and be it.

744
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:18,431
Honey, I could ask you that right now.
You sure look elegant.

745
00:49:18,675 --> 00:49:21,269
Not now, Frank.
That ain't the way I planned it.

746
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:23,947
Besides, you can't kneel down here.

747
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:26,595
Then I'll come back to your tent
after I come off.

748
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:29,951
And then you can take your time
and ask me real slow-like.

749
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:35,184
I better get. Would you
like to touch me for luck?

750
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:44,429
There ain't nothing like that
in Dark County.

00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:35,349
"But I must confess

786
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:38,112
"That I like it

787
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:42,074
"So there's nothing to be done

788
00:52:42,395 --> 00:52:49,426
"Yes, you must confess that you like it

789
00:52:50,195 --> 00:52:54,507
"Being miserable

790
00:52:58,555 --> 00:53:02,867
"Is gonna be fun"

791
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:55,313
And now, ladies and gentleman,
for the surprise feature...

792
00:53:55,395 --> 00:53:58,228
...of the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show.

793
00:53:58,675 --> 00:54:00,950
For the first time in any arena...

794
00:54:01,235 --> 00:54:06,593
...we will witness this afternoon a feat
of marksmanship, daring and bravery...

795
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:10,743
...never before attempted in all the world.

796
00:54:14,955 --> 00:54:19,631
Ladies and gentleman,
we proudly present Miss Annie Oakley.

797
00:55:32,355 --> 00:55:35,552
I don't want you to blame Annie.
She was only trying to surprise you.

798
00:55:35,635 --> 00:55:37,034
She wouldn't cross anybody.

799
00:55:37,115 --> 00:55:40,903
That's what I thought! I thought
she was such a sweet, simple little girl.

800
00:55:41,275 --> 00:55:44,472
Simple. In two weeks,
I wind up being her assistant.

801
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:48,508
Look who's talking. I've watched you
push her around for months now.

802
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:50,673
Handing you your guns.

803
00:55:51,235 --> 00:55:54,625
Grateful for any crumb the great
Frank Butler would deign to drop.

804
00:55:55,115 --> 00:55:58,903
You're so conceited, if you fell in love
with anybody else, it'd be a triangle!

805
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:05,103
Maybe you'd like to hit me, too?
Charlie was talking for both of us.

806
00:56:08,515 --> 00:56:12,986
Frank! I've been looking all over for you.
Did you see me? Were you surprised?

807
00:56:13,075 --> 00:56:15,873
-It was the surprise of my life.
-I knew you'd like it.

808
00:56:16,115 --> 00:56:18,834
Now, if you two will get,
we want to be alone.

809
00:56:22,715 --> 00:56:26,230
Get away! You've been chasing me
all the way from the big tent.

810
00:56:26,915 --> 00:56:29,713
Make him stop saying that!
What does it mean?

811
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,103
It's all right, honey.

812
00:56:31,195 --> 00:56:35,268
It's a compliment. In the Sioux language,
'Watanya Cicilia' means "Little Sure Shot."

813
00:56:35,355 --> 00:56:37,107
Of course, he wants to meet you.

814
00:56:37,235 --> 00:56:40,113
Miss Annie Oakley,
may I present Chief Sitting Bull.

815
00:56:40,955 --> 00:56:43,150
I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Bull.

816
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:46,584
Thank you kindly.

817
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:50,465
I want you to meet my best friend,
Mr. Frank Butler.

818
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:52,787
You in show, too?

819
00:56:53,115 --> 00:56:55,629
In the show? He's the star!

820
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:56,990
Star?

821
00:56:57,155 --> 00:56:59,066
That means he's the best.

822
00:57:02,275 --> 00:57:04,584
No, you best.

823
00:57:05,595 --> 00:57:06,550
Good girl.

824
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:08,865
That's all right.
He wants you to be his friend.

825
00:57:08,955 --> 00:57:11,310
Not friend. I make her my daughter.

826
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:13,393
-What?
-That's a great honor.

827
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:14,703
He wants to adopt you.

828
00:57:14,795 --> 00:57:18,868
I've called Sioux tribe together.
We have big ceremony.

829
00:57:18,995 --> 00:57:20,110
-When, Chief?
-Now.

830
00:57:20,275 --> 00:57:23,153
Not now. I have to contact
the newspapers, send some wires.

831
00:57:23,355 --> 00:57:25,107
-That'll take a little time.
-Now!

832
00:57:25,595 --> 00:57:27,028
That's what I said. Now.

833
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,112
To be near daughter...

834
00:57:30,675 --> 00:57:32,506
...Sitting Bull break rule.

835
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:34,586
Put money in show business.

836
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:37,793
You hear that? Now we can go
to New York, Madison Square Garden!

837
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,672
We'll tour Europe, the whole world!

838
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:42,827
Everything's happening so fast.
First, I get me a new papa...

839
00:57:42,915 --> 00:57:46,510
...and now if you two will get, I could
get me a husband. Couldn't I, Frank?

840
00:57:50,195 --> 00:57:52,755
-Where did he go?
-He probably went out to change.

841
00:57:54,115 --> 00:57:56,026
Wait a minute.

842
00:57:56,115 --> 00:57:58,504
Buffalo! Charlie! Help!

843
00:58:37,475 --> 00:58:38,112
Come!

844
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:48,591
You...

845
00:58:50,115 --> 00:58:51,548
...say after me.

846
00:59:28,115 --> 00:59:29,673
Teeth of many bear.

847
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:40,754
Am I an Indian yet?

848
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:42,070
Not yet.

849
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:00,507
Am I an Indian yet?

850
01:01:00,835 --> 01:01:01,870
Not yet.

851
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:25,547
Am I an Indian yet?

852
01:01:26,675 --> 01:01:27,471
Come.

853
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:33,707
Watanya Cicilia.

854
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:35,432
Now!

855
01:01:49,635 --> 01:01:54,425
"Like the Seminole, Navajo, Kickapoo

856
01:01:54,555 --> 01:01:58,992
"Like those Indians, I'm an Indian, too

857
01:01:59,075 --> 01:02:03,671
"A Sioux, a Sioux

858
01:02:04,155 --> 01:02:08,990

Falling Pants, Running Nose

859
01:02:09,075 --> 01:02:13,546
"Like those Indians, I'm an Indian, too

860
01:02:13,675 --> 01:02:18,305
"A Sioux, a Sioux

861
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,669
"Some Indian summer's day,
without a care

862
01:02:23,595 --> 01:02:28,225
"I may run away
with Big Chief Son of a Bear

863
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:33,105
"And I'll have totem poles,
tomahawks, small papoose

864
01:02:33,235 --> 01:02:37,433
"Which will go to prove
I'm an Indian too

865
01:02:37,715 --> 01:02:41,105
"A Sioux, a Sioux

866
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:45,985

868
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:53,390
"How! "

869
01:03:04,235 --> 01:03:06,829
Well, now I'm an Indian.

870
01:03:07,995 --> 01:03:11,465
Do we carry on that way
every time we take in a new member?

871
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:15,623
I'm beat.

872
01:03:17,915 --> 01:03:19,826
Here's a letter for you, Annie.

873
01:03:20,435 --> 01:03:21,470
For me?

874
01:03:22,995 --> 01:03:24,110
Thanks.

875
01:03:25,475 --> 01:03:27,466
I ain't never had a letter before.

876
01:03:35,595 --> 01:03:36,630
Frank!

877
01:03:37,075 --> 01:03:38,827
Frank. Your best friend.

878
01:03:39,355 --> 01:03:41,346
Papa Bull, can you read writing?

879
01:03:42,515 --> 01:03:44,392
Papa Bull writing book.

880
01:03:45,235 --> 01:03:46,793
Can you make this out?

881
01:03:49,515 --> 01:03:51,824
"Dear Annie. I'm leav--"

882
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:54,824
What's the matter?

883
01:03:56,675 --> 01:04:00,429
"I'm leaving tonight
to join Pawnee Bill's show.

884
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:04,947
"I'm going to do my old act with Dolly."

885
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,069
Why?

886
01:04:07,955 --> 01:04:11,231
"You put over greatest trick I ever saw.

887
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:16,232
"You are a smart girl, Annie,
too smart for me.

888
01:04:17,555 --> 01:04:21,343
"Good luck to you and goodbye. Frank."

889
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:25,145
What does he mean? Too smart for....

890
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:28,664
It must be some sort of joke.

891
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:32,507
It was gonna be Butler and Oakley.

892
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:33,950
I was gonna....

893
01:04:34,795 --> 01:04:36,467
Are you sure you can read?

894
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:38,633
You want him killed?

895
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:43,627
Papa Bull, we was gonna be married
tonight. Me and Frank.

896
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,343
I was gonna be a lady for him
and everything.

897
01:04:48,195 --> 01:04:50,345
I was trying so hard!

898
01:04:52,435 --> 01:04:57,031
You great lady, Annie.
You best shot in whole world.

899
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,825
Oh, Papa Bull! I wish I'd never seen a gun.

900
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:32,150
You kids be good and do everything
that Miss Willoughby tells you to do.

901
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,187
Where's Little Jake?

902
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:36,433
Jake?

903
01:05:58,035 --> 01:05:58,990
Little Jake.

904
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:04,386
Annie, it's awful important
that I go with you. Honest, it is.

905
01:06:04,475 --> 01:06:08,548
I wish you could, Little Jake,
but you've got to take Jessie and Minnie...

906
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,068
...and Nellie back to Ohio.

907
01:06:10,395 --> 01:06:12,431
But who's going to teach you to read?

908
01:06:12,915 --> 01:06:14,826
I guess I'll have to learn myself.

909
01:06:18,595 --> 01:06:19,550
Goodbye, kids.

910
01:06:19,635 --> 01:06:22,024
-Take good care of them, Miss Willoughby.
-I will.

911
01:06:22,115 --> 01:06:24,470
-Goodbye, Annie.
-And hurry up back, Annie.

912
01:06:24,555 --> 01:06:26,193
I will.

913
01:06:26,395 --> 01:06:27,305
Goodbye.

914
01:06:30,355 --> 01:06:32,915
Take good care of your shooting arm,
Annie.

915
01:06:33,755 --> 01:06:35,791
I will, Jake. 'Bye.

916
01:06:40,315 --> 01:06:42,624
-There it is. Time to get aboard.
-Not yet.

917
01:06:42,795 --> 01:06:44,626
-Something wrong?
-Maybe.

918
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:45,830
Maybe what?

919
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:48,868
Don't you think people would come
and say goodbye to people...

920
01:06:48,955 --> 01:06:50,752
...when people are going to Europe?

921
01:06:50,835 --> 01:06:52,826
Annie, maybe he couldn't make it.

922
01:06:53,115 --> 01:06:55,993
You mean, maybe he didn't want to.

923
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:00,514
I don't care. Don't mean nothing to me.

924
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:04,066
Come on. I'm gonna be the biggest hit
in the whole world.

925
01:07:04,235 --> 01:07:06,669
I'm going to win every shooting medal
ever invented.

926
01:07:06,795 --> 01:07:10,344
Then Mr. Frank Butler won't be so proud
and mighty. I'll show him.

927
01:07:10,715 --> 01:07:11,989
Yes, now. Come on.

928
01:09:50,995 --> 01:09:54,112
Miss Oakley,
you're a very remarkable young lady.

929
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:02,751
Sit down.

930
01:10:04,755 --> 01:10:06,950
My daughter, Annie, many fine medals.

931
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:09,026
Hello, Charlie. Great success, wasn't it?

932
01:10:09,115 --> 01:10:11,390
Another success like that
and we'll go broke.

933
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:12,590
What are you saying?

934
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,109
These command performances
are costing us our shirts.

935
01:10:15,195 --> 01:10:17,868
They command, we perform, no one pays.

936
01:10:18,115 --> 01:10:21,187
We got enough money
to meet our payroll this week?

937
01:10:21,275 --> 01:10:23,789
Meet it? We're not close enough
to even wave at it.

938
01:10:24,635 --> 01:10:26,307
Maybe we'll break even in Sweden.

939
01:10:26,395 --> 01:10:28,625
They only have one king
and he's on a vacation.

940
01:10:28,715 --> 01:10:32,503
Look, Charlie, what would you think about
pulling up stakes here and heading home?

941
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:36,190
We've got a whole tour ahead of us.
Now is our chance to make a little money.

942
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:39,745
-This has all just been a buildup.
-I wasn't thinking about the money.

943
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,388
I didn't hear you.

944
01:10:41,635 --> 01:10:43,990
Have you been watching Annie lately?

945
01:10:44,595 --> 01:10:46,506
I watch her every show.

946
01:10:47,595 --> 01:10:50,905
-She's a great little sharpshooter.
-I don't think that's enough for her.

947
01:10:50,995 --> 01:10:53,555
-We'll build up her act a little.
-Charlie, talk sense.

948
01:10:53,635 --> 01:10:55,114
What do you expect me to say?

949
01:10:55,195 --> 01:10:57,914
That she'd be happier
back with the great Frank Butler?

950
01:10:58,795 --> 01:11:00,911
I'd rather see her elope with Sitting Bull.

951
01:11:01,115 --> 01:11:03,390
At least she'd always have
a tent over her head.

952
01:11:03,475 --> 01:11:05,147
Listen to me. Frank is all right.

953
01:11:05,235 --> 01:11:08,113
The only important thing is
Annie's in love with him.

954
01:11:08,235 --> 01:11:11,989
That's where you're wrong.
Annie is as happy as a little lark.

955
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:15,510
Here comes your happy little lark now.

956
01:11:27,595 --> 01:11:30,712
-The show went swell, didn't it?
-You were superb, my dear.

957
01:11:30,795 --> 01:11:32,865
You knocked them right out of their seats.

958
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,105
Do you think that I thanked
the queen enough?

959
01:11:35,195 --> 01:11:36,310
You certainly did.

960
01:11:36,395 --> 01:11:38,067
You gave a great show.

961
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:41,912
It's fun traveling around Europe
like this, isn't it?

962
01:11:43,315 --> 01:11:44,304
Isn't it?

963
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:49,590
Sure. You get to travel all around,
meet a lot of interesting people.

964
01:11:49,715 --> 01:11:50,670
I love it.

965
01:11:51,435 --> 01:11:54,188
Well, I'm all packed.
Where we heading now?

966
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:55,589
North? South?

967
01:11:56,075 --> 01:11:57,303
We haven't decided.

968
01:11:57,395 --> 01:11:59,465
We were talking about Sweden.

969
01:12:00,915 --> 01:12:01,904
That's nice.

970
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:05,029
And then of course,
we could go back to America.

971
01:12:05,395 --> 01:12:06,464
We could?

972
01:12:10,275 --> 01:12:12,743
-Do you really mean it?
-Would you like that, honey?

973
01:12:13,475 --> 01:12:16,751
I love Europe,
but I've been dying to go home.

974
01:12:17,075 --> 01:12:18,508
That's what we figured.

975
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:20,426
I'd get to see the kids again.

976
01:12:20,955 --> 01:12:23,469
Yes. Wouldn't that be nice?

977
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:29,994
Of course, I can't wait
till a certain Mr. Somebody sees this.

978
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:40,274
Aren't they cute?

979
01:12:40,435 --> 01:12:44,064
Yeah, but if we're so rich,
what are we doing on a cattle boat?

980
01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:46,824
We thought it'd be nice
to keep the animals company.

981
01:12:47,475 --> 01:12:50,433
Our European tour was an artistic success.

982
01:12:50,515 --> 01:12:51,709
He means we're broke.

983
01:12:51,795 --> 01:12:55,390
You don't mean the king of ltaly
and the Kaiser couldn't dig up $1 .50?

984
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:57,784
My dear child, kings don't handle money.

985
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,354
Same as us.

986
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:03,548
In brief, we had a choice of traveling
on this boat or getting our feet very wet.

987
01:13:03,635 --> 01:13:04,465
Shut up!

988
01:13:04,555 --> 01:13:07,547
It costs a lot of money to travel
a big troupe up and down Europe.

989
01:13:07,635 --> 01:13:11,514
Remember what happened in Paris when
the Indians discovered French pastry?

990
01:13:11,915 --> 01:13:14,509
Sixty-two thousand chocolate éclairs.

991
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:17,587
Sixty-two thousand, five hundred.

992
01:13:17,835 --> 01:13:19,666
You see? That cost a heap of money.

993
01:13:19,755 --> 01:13:22,030
But, Papa Bull,
what happened to your heap?

994
01:13:22,355 --> 01:13:25,552
Government put Papa Bull
on small allowance.

995
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,911
$32.50 a week.

996
01:13:28,155 --> 01:13:28,951
But why?

997
01:13:29,035 --> 01:13:32,505
Because in the eight months he's been
with us, he's drawn $300,000...

998
01:13:32,595 --> 01:13:35,268
...and he has nothing to show for it
except an opera hat...

999
01:13:35,355 --> 01:13:37,391
...and a shoebox full of our lOUs.

1000
01:13:37,475 --> 01:13:39,466
That's show business.

1001
01:13:39,755 --> 01:13:42,269
I'll give it to you straight.
We can't keep the show open.

1002
01:13:42,355 --> 01:13:43,708
It costs too much money!

1003
01:13:43,915 --> 01:13:45,712
But you can't break up the show.

1004
01:13:45,835 --> 01:13:48,668
I go back to reservation.

1005
01:13:49,195 --> 01:13:53,473
Reservation very quiet
after show business.

1006
01:13:53,835 --> 01:13:55,587
What will happen to you, Buffalo Bill?

1007
01:13:55,675 --> 01:14:00,112
I'll be fine. Dime museums, side shows.
Everything is going to be all right, honey.

1008
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:03,148
Only just now we've got to raise
a little bit of cash.

1009
01:14:03,555 --> 01:14:05,944
Let's turn this into a pirate ship.

1010
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,106
Sitting Bull, hungry.

1011
01:14:08,395 --> 01:14:11,307
Buffalo Bill's hungry, too.
I'd settle right now for....

1012
01:14:12,275 --> 01:14:13,708
I'd settle right....

1013
01:14:16,595 --> 01:14:19,063
Annie, do you think you could shoot
one of those?

1014
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,305
Which one do you want
and where do you want him?

1015
01:14:21,395 --> 01:14:23,113
Get the one with the meat on him.

1016
01:14:26,515 --> 01:14:29,632
There, you see?
Everything finally turns out all right.

1017
01:14:29,795 --> 01:14:31,228
Take this down to the chef.

1018
01:14:31,315 --> 01:14:33,704
-What for?
-A seagull sandwich.

1019
01:14:35,115 --> 01:14:39,188
I guess I'll mosey on back to my stall.
It's time to milk my roommate.

1020
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:49,787
Annie, come down to me.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

1021
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:54,983
There she is.

1022
01:15:01,115 --> 01:15:03,504
Heaving to boarding instructions.

1023
01:15:04,275 --> 01:15:05,867
Come aboard by port bow.

1024
01:15:12,315 --> 01:15:13,543
We got a visitor.

1025
01:15:13,635 --> 01:15:14,750
Who is it?

1026
01:15:14,835 --> 01:15:17,508
It looks like Frank Butler.

1027
01:15:18,195 --> 01:15:19,389
Well, so it does.

1028
01:15:19,475 --> 01:15:21,147
Come on, Annie. Take a look.

1029
01:15:21,235 --> 01:15:24,625
I don't want to look! And if he's coming
on this boat, I'm leaving.

1030
01:15:24,715 --> 01:15:25,511
No, Annie!

1031
01:15:25,595 --> 01:15:27,108
Stay. Talk.

1032
01:15:28,595 --> 01:15:29,664
Maybe I will.

1033
01:15:31,275 --> 01:15:33,027
Sure, I'll talk to him.

1034
01:15:33,555 --> 01:15:34,590
I'll say:

1035
01:15:34,835 --> 01:15:38,464
"What are you doing here,
you big swollen-headed stiff? Get! "

1036
01:15:39,515 --> 01:15:41,551
Then he'll say:

1037
01:15:41,635 --> 01:15:44,149
"I just came down to meet you, honey."

1038
01:15:44,475 --> 01:15:45,954
Then I'll say:

1039
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:49,189
"I don't want to get met by you.
Get away from me.

1040
01:15:49,275 --> 01:15:51,391
"Take your hands off me. I hate you."

1041
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,546
Then he'll say:

1042
01:15:56,235 --> 01:15:58,066
"Now, honey."

1043
01:15:59,035 --> 01:16:00,354
Then I'll say:

1044
01:16:00,795 --> 01:16:01,910
"Don't honey me.

1045
01:16:01,995 --> 01:16:05,351
"You thought I'd double-crossed you.
You thought I tried to show you up.

1046
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:08,871
"When you did find out I only done
the trick just so you'd love me...

1047
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:11,025
"...why didn't you love me?
Why did you leave?

1048
01:16:11,115 --> 01:16:12,628
"Why didn't you write?"

1049
01:16:14,635 --> 01:16:16,785
Then he'll say:

1050
01:16:19,915 --> 01:16:21,712
"'Cause I was ashamed.

1051
01:16:23,155 --> 01:16:28,673
"Besides, not writing don't mean
that somebody don't love somebody."

1052
01:16:30,035 --> 01:16:31,946
Then I'll say:

1053
01:16:33,035 --> 01:16:36,232
"Well anyway, you could have written."

1054
01:16:37,075 --> 01:16:39,066
Then he'll say:

1055
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:44,114
"Annie, I've been eating my heart out
for you. I can't work. I can't sleep."

1056
01:16:45,555 --> 01:16:48,672
Then, of course, if he says that...

1057
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:51,471
...l guess I'll just have to say:

1058
01:16:53,235 --> 01:16:55,305
"I ain't slept much, too."

1059
01:16:56,595 --> 01:16:58,426
Then by rights...

1060
01:16:58,995 --> 01:17:03,511
...he ought to say, "Annie,
we both just got to get some sleep!

1061
01:17:05,275 --> 01:17:07,027
"I love you so."

1062
01:17:09,275 --> 01:17:13,029
Then I don't know how
I'll stop myself from saying:

1063
01:17:16,515 --> 01:17:17,914
"I love you, too."

1064
01:17:21,195 --> 01:17:21,786
Frank!

1065
01:17:26,795 --> 01:17:28,069
You ain't Frank!

1066
01:17:28,155 --> 01:17:29,270
Nobody said I was.

1067
01:17:29,355 --> 01:17:31,869
Why did you come here pretending,
getting me to kiss you.

1068
01:17:31,955 --> 01:17:33,786
-He didn't do anything.
-Yes, he did.

1069
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:35,945
He give me an appetite
I didn't want to get.

1070
01:17:37,395 --> 01:17:38,384
Who are you, son?

1071
01:17:38,475 --> 01:17:41,512
I'm working at Madison Square Garden.
I'm in the Pawnee Billy Show.

1072
01:17:41,595 --> 01:17:42,823
-How?
-How!

1073
01:17:43,035 --> 01:17:44,627
No. How's business?

1074
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:46,991
We're packing them in.
Mostly society ladies.

1075
01:17:47,075 --> 01:17:48,064
Society ladies?

1076
01:17:48,155 --> 01:17:50,988
Sure. That Frank Butler,
he's catnip for those debutantes.

1077
01:17:51,155 --> 01:17:53,191
Debutantes? What's that?

1078
01:17:53,275 --> 01:17:54,947
Ladies with long, white gloves.

1079
01:17:55,635 --> 01:17:58,024
Them long white gloves
you're talking about...

1080
01:17:58,515 --> 01:18:00,426
...is there any special pair he likes?

1081
01:18:00,515 --> 01:18:02,585
We can't keep track of him. Colonel, sir...

1082
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:05,109
-...I have a letter from Pawnee Bill to you.
-Thank you.

1083
01:18:05,195 --> 01:18:08,073
We were expecting you in
on the Great Eastern.

1084
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:11,943
Of course, I don't like to be separated
from my cattle.

1085
01:18:12,715 --> 01:18:14,467
Charlie, show these gentlemen below.

1086
01:18:14,555 --> 01:18:16,864
Could I interest you in a tub
of nice fresh milk?

1087
01:18:16,955 --> 01:18:18,354
-Let me read it.
-Certainly.

1088
01:18:19,515 --> 01:18:21,471
"Dear old pal.

1089
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:25,390
"Welcome home, you millionaires.

1090
01:18:27,115 --> 01:18:31,825
"We want to give you all a big reception...

1091
01:18:32,235 --> 01:18:34,066
"...at the Hotel...."

1092
01:18:38,435 --> 01:18:40,153
No, honey. Brevoort.

1093
01:18:40,755 --> 01:18:43,064
I can read, lately.

1094
01:18:43,915 --> 01:18:47,385
"The Hotel Brevoort.

1095
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:49,990
"Tomorrow night.

1096
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:52,994
"The town's dying to meet you.

1097
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:57,463
"Frank's bringing all his society friends."

1098
01:18:58,035 --> 01:18:59,354
All right. Turn over.

1099
01:19:00,275 --> 01:19:05,110
"Please tell my messenger
that you will come...

1100
01:19:05,555 --> 01:19:10,185
"...so we can start
to ice the champ-a-ginny."

1101
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:12,310
Champagne.

1102
01:19:12,795 --> 01:19:14,672
"Ice the champagne.

1103
01:19:15,035 --> 01:19:17,629
"Your old pal, Pawnee Bill."

1104
01:19:17,715 --> 01:19:21,424
Champagne at the Brevoort.
That old tenderfoot must be filthy rich.

1105
01:19:21,835 --> 01:19:24,986
Good! Pawnee Bill possible sucker.

1106
01:19:25,075 --> 01:19:26,349
What are you talking about?

1107
01:19:26,435 --> 01:19:29,108
Buffalo Bill poor, but good.

1108
01:19:29,435 --> 01:19:31,710
Pawnee Bill bad, but rich.

1109
01:19:32,035 --> 01:19:34,674
Put together, make good and rich.

1110
01:19:34,835 --> 01:19:37,508
He may have something there.
We could merge, you know.

1111
01:19:37,715 --> 01:19:40,183
We've got the prestige
and he's got the money.

1112
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,027
We could combine our shows.

1113
01:19:42,395 --> 01:19:44,033
Annie, how would you like that?

1114
01:19:46,315 --> 01:19:50,991
If the shows could merge, me and Frank
would just have to work together...

1115
01:19:51,075 --> 01:19:54,306
...and then pretty soon, maybe
him and me could do some merging.

1116
01:19:54,475 --> 01:19:56,625
Yes. I'd better go find that messenger.

1117
01:19:59,515 --> 01:20:02,234
Now, you'll be with your friend, Frank.

1118
01:20:02,355 --> 01:20:06,268
Papa Bull, he'll make you
a wonderful son-in-law.

1119
01:20:07,635 --> 01:20:12,390
Maybe he's fallen in love with
one of those pink and white ladies...

1120
01:20:12,515 --> 01:20:14,187
...he's always talking about.

1121
01:20:15,235 --> 01:20:18,147
When you fall in love with Frank?

1122
01:20:19,795 --> 01:20:21,274
The first time I seen him.

1123
01:20:22,355 --> 01:20:23,913
He took to me right away.

1124
01:20:24,915 --> 01:20:26,234
He sung me a love song.

1125
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,110
He just spit his heart right out at me.

1126
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:35,268
"The girl that I marry will have to be

1127
01:20:35,635 --> 01:20:40,914
"As soft and as pink as a nursery

1128
01:20:41,355 --> 01:20:46,349
"The girl I'll call my own

1129
01:20:46,835 --> 01:20:50,908
"Will wear satins and laces

1130
01:20:52,835 --> 01:20:56,589
"And smell of cologne

1131
01:20:58,675 --> 01:21:02,384
"Her nails will be polished

1132
01:21:03,955 --> 01:21:06,344
"And in her hair

1133
01:21:08,475 --> 01:21:11,148
"She'll wear a gardenia

1134
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:15,872
"He'll be there

1135
01:21:18,195 --> 01:21:20,425
"lnstead of flitting

1136
01:21:22,435 --> 01:21:24,232
"He'll be sitting

1137
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:28,026
"Next to her

1138
01:21:29,715 --> 01:21:34,186
"And she'll purr like a kitten

1139
01:21:39,955 --> 01:21:43,948
"A doll he can carry

1140
01:21:46,315 --> 01:21:50,228
"The girl that he marries"

1141
01:22:21,195 --> 01:22:24,505
-I'm giving a weekend party at my estate.
-That's fine.

1142
01:22:24,595 --> 01:22:25,948
I'll be expecting you.

1143
01:22:26,035 --> 01:22:28,833
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I could leave my horses.

1144
01:22:28,915 --> 01:22:31,110
-Horses?
-Excuse me.

1145
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:34,385
-Frank, don't forget our dance.
-I won't.

1146
01:22:35,435 --> 01:22:36,834
Isn't this our dance?

1147
01:22:36,915 --> 01:22:39,349
I'm sorry, but I promised this one
to Pawnee Bill.

1148
01:22:39,515 --> 01:22:41,153
-Excuse me.
-Will you excuse us?

1149
01:22:41,235 --> 01:22:43,908
-Frank, isn't it a lovely party?
-Yeah.

1150
01:22:45,515 --> 01:22:48,029
-It is a nice party, isn't it?
-If you like witches.

1151
01:22:48,115 --> 01:22:50,424
Why did you send
that faded Gibson girl to fetch me?

1152
01:22:50,515 --> 01:22:53,427
I'm out of my mind worrying
if Annie will even talk to me.

1153
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:57,110
Well, I'll have to tell you. We're at the end
of our line. We owe everybody.

1154
01:22:57,195 --> 01:22:59,504
I don't get it.
We're making a fortune at the Garden.

1155
01:22:59,595 --> 01:23:02,268
Yeah. With the sheriff at the door
pulling it out again.

1156
01:23:02,355 --> 01:23:04,744
Why are you giving this party
for Buffalo Bill, then?

1157
01:23:04,835 --> 01:23:07,588
It's an investment.
I'm trying to promote a partnership.

1158
01:23:08,075 --> 01:23:10,350
-You mean, put the two shows together?
-Yes.

1159
01:23:11,795 --> 01:23:14,673
Hey, that's wonderful.
Then she'd have to talk to me.

1160
01:23:14,755 --> 01:23:16,632
I knew I could count on you.

1161
01:23:16,835 --> 01:23:19,224
Colonel William F. Cody.

1162
01:23:20,915 --> 01:23:24,271
-Where are you going?
-I got a surprise for her. I'll be right back.

1163
01:23:26,235 --> 01:23:29,193
Mr. Charles Davenport and their company.

1164
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:36,628
Well, well. My old pal, Bill.

1165
01:23:36,715 --> 01:23:39,388
Pawnee Bill, my old pal. What a reunion!

1166
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:41,831
You're a sight for sore eyes.

1167
01:23:41,995 --> 01:23:43,713
You know, you look wonderful?

1168
01:23:43,955 --> 01:23:45,183
-I look wonderful?
-Yes!

1169
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:47,630
I look terrible. You look wonderful.
Doesn't he?

1170
01:23:47,715 --> 01:23:49,307
He never looked this good to me.

1171
01:23:49,395 --> 01:23:51,067
-Where's Annie?
-She's on her way.

1172
01:23:51,155 --> 01:23:53,544
I'm anxious to see her. Let's have a drink.

1173
01:23:55,675 --> 01:23:58,143
-Well, Bill, here's to you.
-No. Here's to you.

1174
01:23:58,235 --> 01:24:01,307
-No. To you.
-No, I insist. Here's to you.

1175
01:24:01,395 --> 01:24:02,828
Let's drink to me.

1176
01:24:06,035 --> 01:24:07,263
No. Later.

1177
01:24:08,115 --> 01:24:10,265
I read about your European tour.

1178
01:24:11,035 --> 01:24:13,868
-Biggest show they've seen over there.
-We got by.

1179
01:24:14,915 --> 01:24:18,828
-I hear you're doing fine at the Garden.
-Well, you know, making a living.

1180
01:24:22,195 --> 01:24:24,789
Let's have another drink.
The real stuff is in there.

1181
01:24:27,795 --> 01:24:30,263
Mighty nice of you
to give us this fine party.

1182
01:24:30,355 --> 01:24:32,789
Nothing at all. We are buddies, aren't we?

1183
01:24:33,395 --> 01:24:35,829
As a matter of fact,
we cut off our European tour...

1184
01:24:35,915 --> 01:24:37,507
...so Annie could be with Frank.

1185
01:24:37,595 --> 01:24:38,789
Is that so?

1186
01:24:38,915 --> 01:24:40,633
I wonder how we could manage that?

1187
01:24:40,715 --> 01:24:42,512
I've been wondering the same thing.

1188
01:24:43,115 --> 01:24:46,391
Let me propose a toast.
To the two greatest showmen in America.

1189
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:49,545
Pawnee Bill and Buffalo Bill.

1190
01:24:50,635 --> 01:24:53,069
-What a combination.
-Yes.

1191
01:24:57,795 --> 01:25:00,867
We could merge the shows and then
Annie and Frank could be together.

1192
01:25:00,955 --> 01:25:03,515
Why didn't I think of that?

1193
01:25:03,635 --> 01:25:07,264
This calls for a real celebration.
Let me fill them up again for you.

1194
01:25:07,755 --> 01:25:09,188
-Darling--
-Beat it.

1195
01:25:12,115 --> 01:25:13,184
There we are.

1196
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:16,506
Here's to the new
Buffalo Bill-Pawnee Bill Wild West Show.

1197
01:25:16,595 --> 01:25:20,304
Hold on. No, sir. Here's to the new
Pawnee Bill-Buffalo Bill Wild West Show.

1198
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:22,067
No, you come first.

1199
01:25:22,235 --> 01:25:24,544
I'll bet they're going to serve dove
for dinner.

1200
01:25:24,635 --> 01:25:26,990
This is a night I will always remember.

1201
01:25:27,195 --> 01:25:28,594
Me too, B.B.

1202
01:25:28,995 --> 01:25:31,304
Now, if we had $100,000--

1203
01:25:32,555 --> 01:25:33,874
A hundred thousand what?

1204
01:25:34,115 --> 01:25:37,187
I was going to say, if we had $100,000,
we could pay off our debts.

1205
01:25:38,115 --> 01:25:40,345
-What were you going to say?
-The same thing.

1206
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,665
Why, you dirty crook!

1207
01:25:43,915 --> 01:25:45,394
Miss Annie Oakley.

1208
01:25:45,635 --> 01:25:47,512
Chief Sitting Bull.

1209
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:49,631
-Do you see him yet?
-He'll be here.

1210
01:25:59,315 --> 01:26:01,431
Miss Oakley. Enchanted.

1211
01:26:01,715 --> 01:26:03,467
You're a friend of Frank Butler's.

1212
01:26:03,555 --> 01:26:05,546
-How'd you know?
-White gloves.

1213
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:07,905
Charmed.

1214
01:26:07,995 --> 01:26:08,825
'Chanted.

1215
01:26:08,915 --> 01:26:09,870
Enchanted.

1216
01:26:09,955 --> 01:26:10,626
Charmed.

1217
01:26:10,715 --> 01:26:11,545
Oh, charmed.

1218
01:26:11,635 --> 01:26:12,590
Oh, 'chanted.

1219
01:26:12,675 --> 01:26:13,630
Enchanted.

1220
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:14,830
Oh, charmed.

1221
01:26:15,075 --> 01:26:15,951
Delighted.

1222
01:26:16,115 --> 01:26:18,504
No. You either got to be charmed
or 'chanted.

1223
01:26:19,595 --> 01:26:22,189
-May I get you some chicken salad?
-You sure can.

1224
01:26:22,315 --> 01:26:25,068
I don't know what's ailing me lately
but I'm always hungry.

1225
01:26:25,835 --> 01:26:28,269
-I wonder what that's from.
-From not eating.

1226
01:26:28,915 --> 01:26:32,112
All those medals,
I read they were worth $100,000.

1227
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:34,067
What is that big one for?

1228
01:26:34,275 --> 01:26:36,664
For shooting the apple
off the Crown Prince's head.

1229
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:38,463
And this little one?

1230
01:26:38,755 --> 01:26:40,905
For shooting the worm out of the apple.

1231
01:26:41,115 --> 01:26:42,787
Isn't she heavenly?

1232
01:26:42,955 --> 01:26:45,185
Miss Oakley,
won't you shoot something for us?

1233
01:26:45,275 --> 01:26:46,344
Yes. Please do.

1234
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:48,630
If I'd brought my gun, I'd love to.

1235
01:26:48,715 --> 01:26:50,751
I'd love to shoot all of you.

1236
01:26:53,075 --> 01:26:53,871
Pawnee Bill!

1237
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:56,914
Waiter, drop the tray
and throw the guests of honor out.

1238
01:26:56,995 --> 01:26:59,190
-Ain't we merging?
-The merger's off.

1239
01:26:59,275 --> 01:27:00,344
Come on, everybody.

1240
01:27:00,435 --> 01:27:01,788
-Out!
-Why?

1241
01:27:01,995 --> 01:27:04,304
They haven't got as much money
as we haven't got.

1242
01:27:04,395 --> 01:27:05,874
You've got to do something!

1243
01:27:05,955 --> 01:27:06,910
Wait!

1244
01:27:08,435 --> 01:27:10,346
Two shows must go together.

1245
01:27:10,675 --> 01:27:12,825
Annie want Frank. Annie get Frank.

1246
01:27:13,115 --> 01:27:14,434
Papa Bull find money.

1247
01:27:14,515 --> 01:27:15,231
Where?

1248
01:27:15,315 --> 01:27:18,352
Me know paleface with many diamonds,
much gold.

1249
01:27:18,555 --> 01:27:19,590
Who?

1250
01:27:19,995 --> 01:27:20,586
You.

1251
01:27:20,675 --> 01:27:21,664
Me?

1252
01:27:22,395 --> 01:27:24,545
But I can't sell my medals.

1253
01:27:24,755 --> 01:27:27,144
No sell medals, no money for merger.

1254
01:27:27,635 --> 01:27:29,512
No merger, nobody merge.

1255
01:27:29,595 --> 01:27:31,153
But we've got to merge.

1256
01:27:31,515 --> 01:27:33,551
There's too many white gloves
around here.

1257
01:27:33,635 --> 01:27:35,034
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1258
01:27:35,115 --> 01:27:38,346
If I can keep them until Frank sees them,
you can have them.

1259
01:27:40,235 --> 01:27:41,668
Well, my old partner.

1260
01:27:41,755 --> 01:27:44,315
It'll be great to be working together again.

1261
01:27:44,475 --> 01:27:47,148
Waiter, champagne
for all the guests of honor.

1262
01:27:47,355 --> 01:27:48,708
Come on, everybody.

1263
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:51,025
You realize you just gave up
your whole bankroll.

1264
01:27:51,115 --> 01:27:53,834
I don't care.
I've got what I had when I started.

1265
01:27:53,955 --> 01:27:56,230
Don't fret, Charlie. I'm doing fine.

It's powerful, ain't it?

1306
01:30:59,595 --> 01:31:02,553
Frank, look.

1307
01:31:02,635 --> 01:31:03,624
Polish.

1308
01:31:03,835 --> 01:31:05,791
-You look wonderful.
-Do I?

1309
01:31:10,795 --> 01:31:13,548
-Do I dazzle you?
-I couldn't have stood it much longer.

-Am I driving you crazy?
-Plumb.

01:31:18,835 --> 01:31:21,030
-I love you, Annie.
-I love you back.

1312
01:31:26,715 --> 01:31:28,194
Why didn't you write to me?

1313
01:31:28,275 --> 01:31:31,950
Well, I figured you'd be tied up
with them European counts and dukes.

1314
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:35,153
I been hearing about your collection
of white gloves.

1315
01:31:36,035 --> 01:31:38,344
-I missed you every minute.
-Keep talking.

1316
01:31:38,515 --> 01:31:41,109
-I didn't like living without you.
-Keep talking.

-You are everybody in the world.
-Keep talking.

1318
01:31:43,475 --> 01:31:45,067
I don't want to talk.

1319
01:31:47,115 --> 01:31:49,185
I just want to hold you like this.

1320
01:31:57,795 --> 01:32:00,104
Annie, I want you to have something.

1321
01:32:03,955 --> 01:32:07,948
Frank, I can't take them, honest I can't.

1322
01:32:08,035 --> 01:32:11,072
Go on, honey. A little jewelry
will look good with that ring.

1323
01:32:15,195 --> 01:32:17,311
Go on. Pin them on.

1324
01:32:17,875 --> 01:32:18,864
Where?

1325
01:32:19,235 --> 01:32:22,113
I got a little piece of space left between...

1326
01:32:22,955 --> 01:32:24,468
...France and Switzerland.

1327
01:32:24,555 --> 01:32:27,911
-How come you got that vacant lot there?
-I didn't wear them all.

1328
01:32:27,995 --> 01:32:29,633
What are you waiting for?

1329
01:32:29,715 --> 01:32:32,388
You don't want these.
They haven't got any stones in them.

1330
01:32:32,475 --> 01:32:34,625
I got all the stones I want.
Go ahead, Frank.

1331
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:37,866
No, these are too plain for you.
They just got writing on the back.

1332
01:32:38,355 --> 01:32:41,188
"To Frank Butler,
The Champion Sharpshooter of the World."

1333
01:32:43,195 --> 01:32:46,187
Of what world?
The Old World or the New World?

1334
01:32:46,275 --> 01:32:48,152
-The whole world.
-These say you ain't.

1335
01:32:48,235 --> 01:32:50,430
-They don't prove anything.
-I ain't been beat yet.

1336
01:32:50,515 --> 01:32:53,507
If you mean that time in Cincinnati,
that was beginner's luck.

1337
01:32:53,595 --> 01:32:56,473
I thought maybe that nonsense
had been knocked out of you.

1338
01:32:56,555 --> 01:32:58,910
It couldn't happen again in a million years!

1339
01:32:58,995 --> 01:33:01,111
It's going to happen again tomorrow!

1340
01:33:01,515 --> 01:33:02,391
-Charlie!
-Yes?

1341
01:33:02,475 --> 01:33:04,511
Find someplace
where we can have a match.

1342
01:33:04,595 --> 01:33:06,825
-Who?
-Me and old potshot here.

1343
01:33:07,035 --> 01:33:08,104
A love match.

1344
01:33:08,195 --> 01:33:11,187
There ain't no love in a shooting woman.
What a wife she'd make!

1345
01:33:11,275 --> 01:33:13,266
Instead of tending house,
she'd tend her guns.

1346
01:33:13,355 --> 01:33:14,708
She'd be out hitting targets.

1347
01:33:14,795 --> 01:33:15,830
You'd be out missing them!

1348
01:33:15,915 --> 01:33:18,475
That's not the right spirit
to start working together.

1349
01:33:18,555 --> 01:33:20,705
-We're not working together!
-Not now or ever!

1350
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:23,150
-Cannot stop merger.
-I just did.

1351
01:33:24,115 --> 01:33:25,594
And get us a range!

1352
01:33:26,035 --> 01:33:29,311
That dress sure had me fooled.
I thought you was getting to be a lady.

1353
01:33:29,555 --> 01:33:32,433
It's gonna be a pleasure
to give you a lesson in marksmanship.

1354
01:33:32,595 --> 01:33:35,667
You couldn't give me a lesson
in long-distance spitting!

1418
01:37:08,195 --> 01:37:11,346
Ladies and gentlemen.

1419
01:37:11,675 --> 01:37:15,145
You are about to witness
a contest of marksmanship...

1420
01:37:15,595 --> 01:37:18,507
...for the championship of the world...

1421
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:23,112
...between Miss Annie Oakley...

1422
01:37:25,995 --> 01:37:27,986
...and Mr. Frank Butler!

1423
01:37:29,755 --> 01:37:32,189
Straight shooting, using clay targets...

1424
01:37:32,275 --> 01:37:34,550
...the best out of 100 shots...

1425
01:37:35,155 --> 01:37:36,747
...five shots at a time.

1426
01:37:41,435 --> 01:37:42,424
This one fixed.

1427
01:37:42,515 --> 01:37:45,746
I hope you know what you're doing.
Annie won't like losing this match.

1428
01:37:45,835 --> 01:37:48,872
She like. Annie win match, lose Frank.

1429
01:37:48,955 --> 01:37:51,025
Annie lose match, win Frank.

1430
01:37:51,475 --> 01:37:53,147
We make peace medicine.

1431
01:37:55,435 --> 01:37:56,629
Is that satisfactory?

1432
01:37:56,715 --> 01:37:58,433
Unless he'd like a handicap.

1433
01:37:58,515 --> 01:38:01,712
Let's get started.
I've got a date in town with a lady...

1434
01:38:02,035 --> 01:38:04,424
...and I've only got a half-hour to beat her.

1435
01:38:04,515 --> 01:38:07,393
Beat me! You wouldn't want
to make a bet on that, would you?

1436
01:38:07,475 --> 01:38:09,352
-Anytime!
-You got it!

1437
01:38:09,435 --> 01:38:12,825
-Give me that case with the medals.
-Wait, now. Let's not get hasty.

1438
01:38:12,915 --> 01:38:16,385
I'm betting all these medals
against those three tin badges of yours.

1439
01:38:16,675 --> 01:38:19,792
Annie, you can't bet away $100,000.
That's our whole bankroll.

1440
01:38:19,875 --> 01:38:22,435
-You don't think I'll lose, do you?
-Sure. I mean, no!

1441
01:38:22,515 --> 01:38:24,983
-Here they are.
-Here, let me hold the stakes.

1442
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:27,831
You and your peace medicine.

1443
01:38:28,515 --> 01:38:31,075
You have heard the rules of the contest.
Are you ready?

1444
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:32,110
-Ready.
-Ready?

1445
01:38:32,275 --> 01:38:33,230
Ready!

1446
01:38:38,035 --> 01:38:38,865
Pull!

1447
01:38:41,435 --> 01:38:42,265
Miss!

1448
01:38:46,395 --> 01:38:47,066
Pull!

1449
01:38:49,635 --> 01:38:50,511
Miss!

1450
01:38:52,915 --> 01:38:55,748
-Charlie, get me another gun!
-Yeah.

1451
01:38:57,355 --> 01:38:58,754
Come on. What's the matter?

1452
01:38:58,835 --> 01:39:02,032
Nothing. I was just trying to make
a little war medicine.

1453
01:39:04,595 --> 01:39:06,711
Watch this one, Mr. Frank Butler!

1454
01:39:09,555 --> 01:39:10,192
Pull!

1455
01:39:11,355 --> 01:39:12,185
Miss!

1456
01:39:14,475 --> 01:39:17,911
-I don't know what's the matter with me.
-Now, steady, Annie.

1457
01:39:18,915 --> 01:39:21,190
Charlie, give me another gun!

1458
01:39:25,235 --> 01:39:26,953
Here, honey. Try mine for luck.

1459
01:39:29,875 --> 01:39:31,911
-Did you call me "honey"?
-Sure I did.

1460
01:39:31,995 --> 01:39:33,110
Go on. Try it.

1461
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:39,186
Pull!

1462
01:39:46,995 --> 01:39:47,791
Pull!

1463
01:39:51,355 --> 01:39:53,391
Now, I'm gonna make up what I lost.

1464
01:39:53,795 --> 01:39:56,434
Of course,
you were just giving me a handicap.

1465
01:39:56,515 --> 01:39:57,470
Sure.

1466
01:40:00,075 --> 01:40:00,791
Pull!

1467
01:40:04,275 --> 01:40:05,151
Pull!

1468
01:40:05,755 --> 01:40:06,790
Hit!

1469
01:40:07,995 --> 01:40:09,064
Pull!

1470
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:10,910
Hit!

1471
01:40:11,995 --> 01:40:12,871
Pull!

1472
01:40:13,235 --> 01:40:14,065
Hit!

1473
01:40:14,355 --> 01:40:15,071
Pull!

1474
01:40:17,795 --> 01:40:19,069
The great Miss Oakley.

1475
01:40:19,195 --> 01:40:21,072
Here. I don't need any luck from you.

1476
01:40:21,155 --> 01:40:22,668
-Yes, you do!
-No, I don't.

1477
01:40:22,755 --> 01:40:24,586
Give me another gun, Charlie.

1478
01:40:26,355 --> 01:40:28,391
You have better luck with this one.

1479
01:40:28,595 --> 01:40:30,745
I don't know what's the matter with me.

1480
01:40:30,835 --> 01:40:33,395
You do fine. Keep missing, you win.

1481
01:40:33,515 --> 01:40:35,073
Be second-best, Annie.

1482
01:40:36,115 --> 01:40:39,471
You tell me, can't get a man with gun.
Remember?

1483
01:40:40,115 --> 01:40:40,911
Yeah.

1484
01:40:41,075 --> 01:40:43,350
You get man with this gun.

1485
01:40:47,755 --> 01:40:51,543
Why didn't I think of that?
Give me that gun, Papa Bull!

1486
01:40:55,915 --> 01:40:56,631
Pull!

1487
01:40:59,155 --> 01:40:59,985
Miss!

1488
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:05,225
Pull!

1489
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:06,751
Miss!

1490
01:41:07,555 --> 01:41:09,273
I can't. I quit.

1491
01:41:09,715 --> 01:41:14,470
I concede this match to Mr. Frank Butler,
the greatest sharpshooter in the world.

1492
01:41:14,995 --> 01:41:17,384
-You don't know what you're doing!
-Yes, I do.

1493
01:41:18,555 --> 01:41:21,308
It just ain't no use.
I ain't the champion anymore.

1494
01:41:21,595 --> 01:41:23,074
I'm only second-best.

1495
01:41:23,755 --> 01:41:27,145
-Ain't that right, Papa Bull?
-That's right, Little Sure Shot.

1496
01:41:27,315 --> 01:41:31,194
I don't know what will happen to me.
I guess I'll have to go back to Dark County.

1497
01:41:32,195 --> 01:41:35,073
Go on. He won the medals.
Charlie, give him the medals.

1498
01:41:35,155 --> 01:41:37,032
Charlie! Give him those medals.

1499
01:41:40,755 --> 01:41:42,666
-Annie, these belong to you.
-No.

1500
01:41:43,195 --> 01:41:44,913
You won them. You keep them.

1501
01:41:44,995 --> 01:41:46,667
We're gonna be partners.

1502
01:41:46,835 --> 01:41:47,790
Partners?

1503
01:41:49,275 --> 01:41:50,708
