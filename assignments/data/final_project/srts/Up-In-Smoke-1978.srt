Whoa!

00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,800
Put me down!

Say, uh, Daisy Lou,

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,500
would you like to hear
a tune?

7
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,700
Eh, cousin...

You're wonderful!

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,400
Sweetheart,
I'll talk to him.

12
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,900
Son, your mother and me
would like for you

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,700
to cozy up
to the Finkelstein boy.

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,200
He's a bright kid,
and, uh...

15
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,800
he's going to
military school, and--

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,100
remember, he was
an Eagle Scout.

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,600
Arnold...

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,900
Will you shut up?

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We're not going to have
a family brawl!

20
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,500
...and a retard.

21
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,800
We've put up with
a hell of a lot.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,800
Can this wait?

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,800
Build your goddamn
muscles, huh?

25
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,800
You know, you could build your
muscles picking strawberries.

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,800
You know,
bend and scoop...

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,200
like the Mexicans.

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,200
Shit, maybe I could
get you a job

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,700
with United Fruit.

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,700
I got a buddy
with United Fruit.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,200
Get you started.

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,700
Start
with strawberries,

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,800
you might work your way up
to these goddamn bananas!

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
When, boy?

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,300
When...are you going to get
your act together?

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,000
(Burp)

37

Oh, good God
Almighty me.

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,400
I think he's
the Antichrist.

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,800
Anthony, I want
to talk to you.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,300
Now, listen!

42
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,500
Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you!

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,500
You get a goddamn job
before sundown,

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,800
or we're shipping you off
to military school

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,300
with that goddamn
Finkelstein shit kid!

46

That's where my money goes

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,900
In my lungs

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,600

Begin to bother me

54
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,600
I take a toke

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
And all my cares
go up in smoke

56

Lowrider drives
a little slower

Lowrider is a real goer

62
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,200
Hey

63
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,500
Lowrider
knows every street, yeah

don't drive too fast

- No!
- No!

You sure?
I'm going that way.

No!

Yeah, I know.

That's the only way
I can get anybody to stop.

100

Hey, that's false
advertising, man.

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
I know, but listen,

102
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,900
I slept in a ditch
last night, man.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
I almost froze
my balls off.

104
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,100
I didn't think
you had any.

Wow! Hey, I really
like your car, man.

Oh, you do?

107
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,700
Wow! Did you do this
yourself?

108
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,700
Yeah, I customized
it myself.

109
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,900
Wow!
Looks fantastic, man.

110

it does, man.

In just a minute, man.

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,000
I got a few more things
I gotta get, okay?

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
I'll be right back.

going to do,

Oh!

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,100
Hey, man, how far
you going, man?

133
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,000
Right here
would be fine, man.

134
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,700
You ain't scared of a little speed,
are you, man?

135
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,700
Oh, you got some speed,
man?

136

Huh? No, I don't got
no speed, man.

137
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,900
You know what I do
got, though, man?

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600
I got a joint, man.

139
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,900
Oh, wow.
All right.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,200
Come on,
light it up.

141
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,700
Let's get
Chinese eyes, man.

142
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,700
What kind of joint
is this, man?

143
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,900
It's a heavy-duty
joint, man.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,100
It looks like
a toothpick, man.

145
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
No, it's not
a toothpick, man.

146
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,600
It is a toothpick,
man.

147
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,200
No, man,
it's just...

148
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,000
It is a toothpick.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,500
I must've got it in
the other pocket, man.

150
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,700
Hold on.
I got the bullshit right here, man.

There you go, man.

154
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Light that
sucker up, man.

155
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,300
We'll go to the moon.

156
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,400
Jeez, I hope your dick's
bigger than this, man.

to get out and walk?

to get high, man?

wooden balls, man?

for a special occasion.

162
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Fire it up.

163

I hope the drums
don't mess up

164
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,700
your upholstery, man.

165
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm in a band,
too, man.

166

I'm a lead singer,
man.

That's hip,
man.

168
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,300
We play everything from Santana
to El Chicano, man.

169
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,900
Hey, I'm just a love machine

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,400
And I don't work
for nobody but you

171
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,300
I'm just a love machine

172
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,100
And I don't work
for nobody but you

173
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,700
Woman, my temperature rise

174
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,800
And then I go
for her thighs

175
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,300
And then I say...

176
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,700
(Singing In Spanish)

177
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
(Speaking In Spanish)

178
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Is that a joint, man?

179
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,800
That there looks like
a quarter pounder, man.

180
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,900
There's a plane.

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,300
Hey, be careful
with that shit, man.

182
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,000
What, is it
heavy stuff, man?

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Will it blow me away?

184
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,800
You better put
your seat belt on, man.

185
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,200
I'll tell you that much.

186
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,200
I been smoking since
I was born, man.

187
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
I can smoke
anything, man.

188
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I smoke
that Michoacan, man,

189
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,700
Acapulco Gold, man.

190
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,700
I even smoke that tied stick,
you know?

191
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,300
Tied stick?

192
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,200
That stuff that's
tied to a stick.

193
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,700
Oh, Thai stick.

194
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,500
That didn't even
do nothing to me.

195
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
I could probably
smoke this whole joint

196
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,000
and still
walk away, man.

197
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,900
It wouldn't be
no problem at all, man.

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Toke. Toke it out,
man.

199
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,200
(Mumbling)

200
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,300
Kind of grabs you
by the boo-boo, don't it?

201
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,200
Hey, man...

202
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,700
What?

203
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,200
Oh!

204
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Hey, what's in
this shit, man?

205
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Mostly Maui-wowie,
man.

206
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,800
Yeah?

207
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
But it's got
some Labrador in it.

208
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,300
What's Labrador?

209
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,800
It's dog shit.

210
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,100
What?

211
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,800
Yeah, my dog ate
my stash, man.

212
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,200
Had it on the table,

213
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,500
and the little
motherfucker ate it, man.

214
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,700
Yeah?

215
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,700
I had to follow him around
with a little baggie

216
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,700
for three days
before I got it back.

217
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,700
Really blew
the dog's mind.

218
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,500
You mean we're smoking
dog shit, man?

219
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Gets you high,
don't it?

220
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
(Radio)
...hoppin'an'a-boppin'

221
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,400
And a-singin'his song

222
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,100
All the little birds
on Jaybird Street

223
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,700
Love to hear the robin
go tweet, tweet, tweet

224
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,700
Rockin'robin

225
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,200
Tweet, tweet, tweet

226
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,500
Rock, rock,
rockin'robin

227
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,700
Tweet...

228
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,200
I think it's even
better than before, you know?

229
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,200
I wonder what Great Dane
tastes like, man.

230
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,700
Ah, man.

231
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,200
That's some
heavy shit, man.

232
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,200
Yeah.

233
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,200
Hey, man...

234
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,700
am I driving okay?

235
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,200
I think
we're parked, man.

236
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
Oh, shit.

237
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,200
Goddamn, what was
in that shit, man?

238
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,700
I never had no dope
like that in my life.

239
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,200
I smoked a lot
of shit before, man,

240
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
but goddamn, man,
that's heavy shit.

241
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,700
You okay?

242
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,700
I can't breathe.

243
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,300
What's the matter?

244
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,000
I can't breathe,
man.

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,700
Well, just...

246
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,200
Well, here.

247
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,200
Here, I got something
that will mellow you out, man.

248
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,700
You're just
freaking out.

249
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,700
I never smoked no shit
like that before.

250
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Take these, man.

251
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
This will
mellow you out, man.

252
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,200
What is this, man?

253
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,200
Just take them.

254
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,500
Hey, don't take
those, man.

255
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,300
What?

256
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,300
I almost gave you
the wrong shit, man.

257
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,100
I already took them,
man.

258
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,100
Ho ho ho ho!

259
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,100
What do you mean
ho ho ho ho?

260
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,600
Wow, man!

261
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,200
What was that shit,
man?

262
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,700
You just ate
the most acid

263
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,700
I've ever seen
anybody eat in my life.

264
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
I never had
no acid before, man.

265
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,700
I hope you're not busy
for about a month.

266
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Shit, I'm going
to die, man.

267
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,900
That stuff's going
to make me die, man.

268
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,400
No, that's
good acid, man.

269
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,200
It's going to make
me freak out, man.

270
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,200
I've seen those guys
that had too many acid.

271
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,500
Their heads look like
a pumpkin, man.

272
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,200
Relax, man.

273
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,100
Hey, mellow out, man!

274
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Now just go, ommmmm...

275
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,700
What?

276
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
Do it, man.

277
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,200
Ohhhhh.

278
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,400
Ommmmm.

279
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Oh, shit.

280
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,700
Mellowwwww.

281
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,100
Mel...

282
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
Mellow.

283
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,700
Mellowwwww.

284
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,200
Yeah.

285
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,700
You better now, man?

286
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,200
Yeah.

287
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,800
You mellow?

288
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,200
Yeah.

289
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,700
You feel all right,
huh?

290
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,300
Yeah.

291
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,700
Aaaaah!

292
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,200
What are you doing,
man?

293
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,700
Sometimes that helps,
man.

294
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,200
Can we get off
this street, man?

295
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
We're parked
in a bad spot.

296
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,700
That's heavy, man.

297
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
The cops
just went by, man.

298
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,200
They're right there.

299
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,700
We're being
pulled over, man.

300
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,200
That's heavy, man.

301
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,700
Aahhhh!

302
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,200
They're coming, man!

303
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,500
Ha ha ha!

304
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,200
This is cool, man!

305
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,200
I never had it before.

306
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,600
I didn't think it was going
to be like this, man.

307
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,200
Ha ha ha!

308
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,700
What's
the problem, son?

309
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,500
Ha ha ha!

310
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,100
Aahhhh!

311
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,600
Roll down
your window.

312
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,100
(Knocking On Window)

313
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,100
Keep on knocking,
but you can't come in

314
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,100
Don't, man.
It's the cops.

315
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,500
Ha ha ha!

316
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,100
Wait, I gotta roll down
the window, man.

317
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,700
Weigh the anchor!

318
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
How much does it weigh?

319
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,200
I don't know.
I forgot.

320
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,700
You forgot?

321
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
I saw that

322
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,200
Can I see
your license, sir?

323
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,700
What?

324
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,200
Your license.
Where's your license?

325
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,300
It's on the bumper.
Back there, man.

326
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,700
No. I mean your
driver's license.

327
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,200
Oh. Oh, yeah!

328
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,800
Yeah, I got
my driver's license, man.

329
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,400
Hee hee hee!

330
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,700
I just thought of
something real funny, man.

331
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,200
Here's your mama.

332
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,200
Ha ha ha!

333
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,000
Sir, what is
your name?

334
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,500
Wh-What?

335
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,900
What's your name?

336
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,200
Isn't it on there
on the license, man?

337
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,200
Yeah, that's it.
Pedro de Pacas.

338
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,700
Just wait here
a minute, huh?

339
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
Hey, hurry back!

340
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,100
I miss you already,
darling.

341
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,300
I gotta get rid
of this dope, man.

342
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,100
Don't act the fool.

343
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
Oh, okay.

344
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,100
We're gonna
get busted.

345
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Hee hee hee!

346
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm blind!

347
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,100
Oh, shit!
I'm blind!

348
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,700
(Babbling)

349
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,200
Ha ha ha!

350
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,700
Hey, hey...

351
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,700
I can see clearly now,
the rain...

352
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,200
Hee hee hee!

353
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Hey, how long does
this shit last, man?

354
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,700
And what is
your name, sir?

355
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,200
You scared me, man.

356
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
I told you my name.

357
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,700
Sir, what's
your name?

358
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,200
(Coughing)

359
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,500
The dude wants to know
your name, man.

360
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
(Vomiting)

361
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,000
Uh, his name is
Raaalph, man.

362
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,900
I was sitting in
the coffee shop

363
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
Just minding my own affair

364
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,900
When all of a sudden

365
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,800
This policeman
caught me unaware, man

366
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,400
He said,
''Is your name Pedro?''

367
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,800
I says,
''Uh, yeah, I guess so''

368
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
He said, ''Then come with me''

369
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,100
'''Cause you're the man
we've been looking for''

370
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,200
I said, ''Hey, man,
I've been framed!''

371
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,000
''Hey, no, really, man,
I was framed!''

372
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,600
''Aw, I never
do nothin' wrong, man''

373
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,200
''But every time,
I get the blame''

374
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,900
''I been framed!''

375
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,700
They put me in the line-up

376
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,600
And let
the bright lights shine

377
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,000
There was
1 0 poor dudes like me

378
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Standing in that line

379
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,700
I knew I was a victim
of somebody's evil plan

380
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,300
When this
scroungy-looking dude

381
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,300
Came up and said,
''Yeah, that's him, man''

382
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,100
Hey, wait a minute, man,
I've been framed, man!

383
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Oh, listen to me,Judge,
I was framed!

384
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,700
I never do nothin' wrong

385
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, but every time,
I get the blame

386
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,500
Hey, I've been framed!

387
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
You boys are in
a lot of trouble.

388
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,200
That dude gave me the first,
second, and third degree

389
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,400
He said, ''Where were you
on the night of July 29?''

390
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,600
I said, ''Man,
I was home in bed''

391
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,300
He said,
''Judge, that man's lying''

392
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,800
I said, ''Wait a minute, man,
I was framed, man!''

393
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Hey, don't do this to me,
man, really

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,300
Because I think
I've been framed, man!

395
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,100
I never do nothin' wrong

396
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,000
Aw, but every time,
I get the blame

397
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,300
Aw, I was framed!

398
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,800
Fucking vodka, man!

399
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,200
(Laughter)

400
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,200
Oh, shit.

401
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,700
Hey, I'm down here.

402
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,200
I didn't see you.

403
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,700
You can sleep in that bedroom
right there, man.

404
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,200
Oh, okay.

405
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,700
Yeah, it's cool there.

406
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,200
Check you
in the morning.

407
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,700
Listen, where's
the bathroom?

408
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,700
It's right there.
See that door?

409
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,200
See you tomorrow.

410
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,700
We got rehearsal.

411
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,200
Okay.

412
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Listen, if you hear some noise
in the bedroom,

413
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,700
it's just me
and my old lady.

414
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,200
Next tune you hear will be
dueling bedsprings.

415
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,700
Check you
in the morning.

416
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,200
(Drums Playing)

417
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,300
(Man) Amigos, presenting
y'all's new uniforms.

418
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,700
All right!

419
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,200
Lookit here!

420
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,700
Check it out!

421
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,500
Hey, man, I can't
wear this stuff, man.

422
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,000
This is terrible, man.

423
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,000
Look, it don't even fit.

424
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,000
No, baby, you clean
as Skeeter's peter.

425
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,900
You just don't understand
the new style.

426
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,400
It's too short, man.

427
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,200
We'll just make a few minor
adjustments, homes.

428
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,900
Hold it, man.

429
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,400
I can't wear this.

430
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,200
Aw, Curtis, man!

431
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,700
My man!

432
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,200
Look at
these uniforms!

433
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,600
Didn't I put them
in the pocket?

434
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,600
These are
outta sight!

435
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,200
I hope mine is
as bad as this!

436
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,200
You see the new cuts
on them?

437
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,800
All we need is rhinestones
and pointed shoes!

438
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,500
Hey, these uniforms
are lame, man.

439
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,500
What you mean lame,
sucker?

440
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,100
Pedro, where's
the white dude

441
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,100
you said was
playing drums?

442
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,600
That's him, man.

443
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,800
That's James,
the bass player, man.

444
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,100
What's happening?

445
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,900
Seriously, man,
these look like waiter uniforms.

446
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,100
- You don't like them, man?
- No.

447
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,100
I'll be in the kitchen.

448
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,900
He's right, man.
These are lame.

449
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,300
This is the new cut.
Y'all be bad.

450
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,200
If we're going
to wear uniforms, man,

451
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
let's everybody wear
something different.

452
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,700
Yeah, that's it.

453
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,000
Everybody wears
something different

454
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,600
but the same, you know?

455
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I gotta get
out of this stuff.

456
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,200
Hey...

457
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,200
Get us something else,
man.

458
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,200
Pedro,
this is Curtis, baby.

459
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,700
Yeah, I know Curtis,
man.

460
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm on top of it.
Rest easy.

461
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,200
Curtis is
on the case.

462
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,800
Hurry up, man.
We gotta go score a lid.

463
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,200
(Starts Car)

464
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,200
(Radio) ...and we'd like
to rock-'n'- roll

465
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,700
and play some great music.

466
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,700
I have a song by
the Search Boys.

467
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,200
The Search Boys are going
to go searching.

468
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,700
Don't ask me what they're
going to go searching for,

469
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
but they're gonna go searching.

470
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,900
So, let's do it.

471
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,700
I searching

472
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:15,400
I searching
every which a-way

473
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,400
I searching, brother

474
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,700
I searching

475
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,500
I'm a-searching
every which-away-ay-ay

476
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,500
But I'd like to go
to the mountain

477
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,000
You know I dream
these things someday

478
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,200
Oh, hear what I say

479
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,600
I hear what you say

480
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,000
Where the Kona Gold
or Maui-wowie

481
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,500
We sold each other and need

482
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,000
We need...

483
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,400
(Pedro) I can't believe we can't
find no grass nowhere, man.

484
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,400
(Man Stoner)
Too many people are smoking it now.

485
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,300
It really makes it tough
on the rest of us.

486
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah.

487
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,100
The prices have
gone crazy, man.

488
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,700
Some people pay
1 00 bucks a lid, man.

489
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,100
Wow!

490
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,600
Who lives here, man?

491
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,100
That's
my cousin Strawberry.

492
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
He's probably got
some dope.

493
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
He's always got
the best smoke.

494
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,200
I hope so, man.

495
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,700
Yeah, well, he's cool.

496
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,200
He's a little weird.

497
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
He went over
to Vietnam, man,

498
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,200
and he came back
all weirded out, you know.

499
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,200
That Nam grass
will do it to you, man.

500
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,200
That stuff will
lay you out, man.

501
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
That's what lost the war.

502
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Whatever you do,
don't say nothing

503
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,700
about his birthmark,
because he flips out.

504
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,200
I ain't going to talk about
nobody's birthmark.

505
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Don't look at it,
either.

506
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,700
Come on.

507
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,700
You sure it's
a birthmark, man?

508
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,200
Sometimes that Nam grass
will do weird things

509
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,700
to your face, too,
you know.

510
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,200
(Knock Knock)

511
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,700
Who is it?

512
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,200
It's me--Pedro, man.

513
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,000
Pedro's not here.

514
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,100
No, I'm Pedro, man.
Open up.

515
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,500
What's the matter, man?

516
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,500
Somebody's messing
around, man.

517
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Come on.
It's open, man.

518
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,400
Hey, Strawberry!

519
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,000
Strawberry's not here.

(Whistles)

521
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,100
Hey, it's a bird.

522
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,100
A bird is
answering the door.

523
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,600
Aw, wow!

524
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,200
What a trip.

525
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,700
Hey, fella.

526
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,900
Hey, Strawberry?

527
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Wanna get high?
Wanna get high?

528
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,600
Must've had
a party here, man.

529
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,200
Wanna get high?

530
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,400
Wanna get high?
Wanna get high?

531
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,700
Hey, want something
to eat, man?

532
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,200
They got some pizza.

533
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Strawberry?

534
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
(Record Skipping)

535
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Hey, Strawberry?

536
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,600
(Crash)

537
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
Oh, Strawberry.

538
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,200
Hey, what's
happening, man?

539
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,200
How you doing?

540
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,600
(Bird)
Starbuck! Starbuck!

541
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,600
Pedro?

542
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
Yeah, yeah, right.
Pedro, man.

543
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,100
This is my friend...

544
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,600
uh...

545
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,800
Strawberry.

546
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,100
(Man Stoner)
Hey, how you doing, man?

547
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,100
I'm doing, friend.

548
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,600
Um, oh, yeah!

549
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,100
Well, we were stopping by

550
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,300
to see if we could score
some smoke, man.

551
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,300
Nobody's got none,
you know?

552
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,800
So, like,
we was wondering

553
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,100
if we could score
some smoke from you.

554
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,700
Smoke?
You want some smoke?

555
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,200
I'll get you
some smoke, man.

556
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,700
All right. Yeah.

557
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,100
I told you we could
score some from him.

558
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,100
What you looking at,
man?

559
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,600
Oh, nothing!

560
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,000
I wasn't looking.
I was just...

561
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,800
I wasn't looking
at his neck, man.

562
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,800
Your friend
better stay here.

563
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,200
We're going to go see
some people of mine,

564
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
and they don't like
strange dudes.

565
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,700
They don't fuck around.

566
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,500
- Well, I'll stay here.
- Yeah.

567
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,100
Ah, look at that, man.
The great outdoors, huh?

568
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,700
Yeah, great outdoors.

569
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,100
(Whistling)

570
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,400

Huh.

573

God, it sure looks real.

574
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,000
Ooh...

575
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,500
Who are you?

576

Hey, how you doing?

577
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,600
I spilled--
I made a mess.

578
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,100
I was just trying...

579
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
Oh, where have you been
all my life?

580
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,000
- We just come in...
- If you don't mind...

581
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,300
It's not really...

Oh, is that great?

590
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,600
What a rush, huh?
What's that stuff like?

591
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,600
Good shit.

592
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,100
The freak
with the top hat

593
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,600
is leaving
with the basketball.

594
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,800
Cover the freak.

595
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,300
He's covered.

596
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,300
Have the rest of the men
stand by.

597
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,500
Stand by.

598
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,000
I think we're onto something
really big, Harry.

599
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This could be the bust
we've been waiting for.

600
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,500
Right, Sarge.

608
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,100
Get me up past
that last hutch

609
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,100
and jettison me
into the paddies.

What are you
talking about paddies?

Ain't no paddies,
just Chicanos, man.

talking about?

they're around your pad, man.

bust your pad!

659
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,400
it's time to
shoot the moon.

660
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,200
Shoot the moon!

661
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
No, you idiot!
Not out there!

662
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,700
On the microphone!
On the microphone.

663
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,300
Shoot the moon.
Shoot the moon.

664
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,700
Hello? Can't hear you, man.
Just a minute.

665
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,500
Hello.

666
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,000
Hey, Pedro?
We get cut off?

667
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,000
We really did get cut off.

668
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,700
(Rattles Door)

669
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,200
(Clicking Receiver)

670
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,500
Hey. Hey. Hello?

671
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Shit, man. How am I going to
get him out of there?

672
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,300
Hey! Hey!

673
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,200
All right! Freeze!
This is a bust!

674
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,700
The party's over, folks.
You, out.

675
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,800
You, freak there
with the red coat--no, no.

676
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,600
Don't swallow the dope.
We know you're holding.

677
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,300
Just how well do you know
that freak with the basketball?

678
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,700
Which basketball?

679
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Sergeant,
get a load of these two.

680
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,300
(Sergeant)
What's her problem?

681
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,300
(Woman)
Can't you see she's sick?

682
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,700
She's sick, all right.

683
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,700
It's turning
blue.

684
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,700
Yeah?
That's high-grade stuff.

685
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,200
Could be Peruvian flake.

686
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,200
That's right.
Keep laughing, miss.

687
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,700
Just keep on laughing,

688
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,500
but this is not
a laughing matter.

689
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,000
This is serious!

690
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,000
This stuff
destroys your mind!

691
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,200
Can't you see she's sick?
She's been through a lot.

692
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,800
She's all fucked up.

693
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,200
You watch
your language, miss.

694
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,100
Harry, remember to get
a lab sample of this stuff.

695
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,100
You have the right
to remain silent.

696
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,400
If you refuse that right,

697
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,400
anything you say
may be used against you.

698
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,000
Have you got
the book?

699
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
No, sir.

700
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,000
Used against you in a...
in a court of law.

701
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,500
Read the book!

702
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,100
Thank you.

703
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,100
Jesus!

704
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,600
You have the right
to remain silent.

705
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,100
If you
give that right up....

706
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,600
What's going on here?
Hey, who are you?

707
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,600
We're from
the finance company.

708
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,600
We came to reprocess
the furniture, man.

709
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,100
That?

710
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,600
Yeah. We gave them
a lot of chances to pay up,

711
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,600
but they didn't
pay up.

712
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,600
Boss says
it's got to go, man.

713
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,600
I'm just
doing my job.

714
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,100
All right! Everybody out!
Move everybody out!

715
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,600
That means you,
buddy.

716
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,900
What the hell
are you doing, Murphy?

717
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,400
All of you, come on.
Let's go. Get out.

718
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,600
Everybody.

719
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,100
- It's locked, man.
- Oh, yeah.

720
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,700
Let go.

721
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,300
Let go, man.

722
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,500
What's going on, man?

723
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,000
It's a bust.

724
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,900
We got to figure out some way
to get you out of here. Shit.

725
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,700
(Bird) All right, freeze.
This is a bust. Strawberry.

726
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,900
Ha ha ha ha!

727
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,900
Single file.

728
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,700
I wasn't looking
at his neck.

729
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,700
I wasn't looking--

730
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
(Gunshot)

731
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,800
No, man.
The town's dry.

732
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,600
There ain't no dope
nowhere, man.

733
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,600
I got to pee.

734
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,100
Hey, Pedro.

735
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,600
Hey, Pedro, my man.

736
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,100
What's happening,
Curtis?

737
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,600
What's going on?

738
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,100
How you doing, man?

739
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,100
Oh, I don't know.
Hey, this your ride?

740
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,100
Yeah.

741
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,300
Wow.

742
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,100
I got it off
my cousin Johnny.

743
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,600

744
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,200
I mean, this bad
low machine is yours?

745
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Yeah.

746
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,600
Oh, Pedro.
You got a taste of soul.

747
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,100
And style, too.

748
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,600
Yeah, I hear you.

749
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,200
You know
what you need

750
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,600
to go with
this bad ride?

751
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,100
A chick?

752
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,400
No, baby.
Check these out.

753
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,400
Knuckles?

754
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Genuine diamonds,
baby.

755
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,000
Those ain't
for-real diamonds, man.

756
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,000
What you--Hey, man!
Check this out. Step back.

757
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,400
Ain't for real?
Check this.

758
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
(Scratching)

759
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,100
What are you doing?
You scratched my window.

760
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
You know, it's cool.
It's cool.

761
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,600
You know
what I do need?

762
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,100
We been looking
for some smoke.

763
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
You got some?

764
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,100
Hey, man, I got some weed
straight from Turkey.

765
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,600
It's what
set them Arabs off.

766
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,100
Arabs from Turkey?

767
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,800
Yeah, man.
They was from Turkey.

768
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,000
This stuff will put a hump
in a camel's back.

769
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
No shit?

770
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,100
I wouldn't shit you, baby.
This is some bad weed.

771
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,600
You got it

772
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,600
It'll boogie-woogie
on your brain.

773
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,600
All right.

774

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,600
(Fly Buzzing)

777
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,600
(Man Stoner)
Man, this shit ain't shit, man.

778
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,600
(Pedro)

779
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,100

780
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,600

00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,600
You mean

782
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,600
I ain't high.

783
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,100

00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,900
You must get high

793
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,400

798
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,600
If he sold you that,

799
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Hey. Hey, man, hide.

I'll check the rooms

00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,000
Hey, man.

Yeah.

809
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,000
Why, man? They can't

810
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,600
Then just

812
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,600
It's a bust, man.

813
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,300
We're clean.
There's no weed.

814
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,300
Shh...

815
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,800
What's going on?

816
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
Oh, man.

817
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,300

818
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,800
Oh, I forgot.

820
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,800
They're looking
for illegal aliens.

821
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,800
I forgot
it's the wedding.

822
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,800
The wedding?

823
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah.

824
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,600
So, who are these guys?

825
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
They're the immigration.
You know, the migra.

826
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,200
They're going to
deport these dudes.

827
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,500
Deport them?

828
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,900
Yeah.
See, my cousin

829
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,100
is getting married
down at TJ, man,

830
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,600
so he calls the immigration
on himself.

831
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
But why?

832
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
So he can get
a free ride, man.

833
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,800
They take the whole
wedding party,

834
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,100
plus they even
get fed lunch, man.

835
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,600
So we're cool?

836
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,100
Yeah. We got nothin'
to worry about, man,

837
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
unless you don't got
a green card.

838
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,000
(Honking)

839
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,000
Hello, Uncle Chuey.
This is Pedro.

840
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,000
Hey, man, we got deported.
We're in Tijuana right now.

841
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,000
We need a way to get back.

842
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,500
You got anything
needs to be picked up here?

843
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,000
Oh, yeah?

844
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
Yeah. Yeah. Oh--
Hold on.

845
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,100
No. No. Gracias.

846
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,700
Okay, what's the address?

847
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,400
1 -8-1 -1 .

848
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,100
(Honking)

849
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
Hey, toro.

850
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,100
Hey. Hey, man.
We got a ride.

851
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,600
Far out, man.

852
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
My Uncle Chuey's
got a van

853
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
we gotta smuggle
across the border.

854
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,100
What are we
smuggling?

855
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,200
Upholstery, man.

856
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,600
He's got an upholstery shop
in Beverly Hills,

857
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,100
but he gets cheaper work
done here, man.

858
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,600
(Sergeant Stedenko)
The smuggling of marijuana

859
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,100
from Mexico
into the United States

860
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,100
has reached
a dangerous high.

861
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,100
The methods have become
unbelievably devious,

862
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,700
and these seeds

863
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,100
may sow the destruction
of the human race.

864
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,100
Gentlemen, I don't think
we need to comment

865
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,600
on the seriousness
of the situation.

866
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,500
Harry, will you cool that?
Stop that, Harry.

867
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,600
Gentlemen,
we are on the threshold

868
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,100
of copping one of the largest
shipments of marijuana

869
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,900
ever to cross the Mexican border
into the United States.

870
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
The question is,

871
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,500
how are they going to
transport it across the border?

872
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
- By boat.
- Carrier pigeon.

873
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Freight.

874
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Piggyback.

875
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Plaster casts.

876
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,000
Long trucks.
Long trucks.

877
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,600
Let me show you.

878
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,400
Inside TV sets.

879
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,900
No, Harry. No, no, no.
Not inside TV sets.

880
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,900
The TV set itself
is the marijuana--

881
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,400
the tube, the picture,
the aerial, the whole works.

882
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,400
How can you make a TV set
out of marijuana?

883
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,400
That's a good question, Harry.
I'll show you.

884
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,400
Now, the weed
is separated from seed.

885
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,400
The weed is then transformed
into liquid.

886
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,000
The liquid is then acted upon

887
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,000
by a chemical
which makes it hard

888
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,500
like a plastic.

889
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,100
The plastic is then
transformed into a spray.

890
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,100
This spray, gentlemen,
is called fiberweed,

891
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,900
and it's pure marijuana.

892
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,200
Thanks to the efforts
of our undercover man

893
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,700
inside the dope factory,

894
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,100
we have some
very interesting facts.

895
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,600
That is quite a quantity
of marijuana, gentlemen.

896
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,300
It is not a lid
or kilo or gram.

897
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,100
How much do you think
is here?

898
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,900
A million
pounds.

899
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Harry?

900
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,500
A shit-load.

901
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,000
Harry!

902
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,800
We do know that
the dope factory's disguised

903
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,300
as an upholstery warehouse.

904
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,600
Hey, this is
the street, man. Come on.

905
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,600
How can you
eat this stuff?

906
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,600
I love them.
Don't you like these?

907
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,600
I told you not to
buy it, Man. God.

908
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
What did you
do that for, man?

909
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,100
I would have ate it.

910
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,100
A dog could be
in that stuff.

911
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,000
You got
the address?

912
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,500
Good dog, man.

913
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,100
Hey!

914
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,100
Son of a...

915
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,800
1 -8-1 --

916
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,900
Is that 7 or 1 ?
Ah, it's 7. Come on.

917
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,000
Let's go check
this place out.

918
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,600
Hey, we're here
to pick up the van, man.

919
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,800
Shh!

920
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,600
(Whispering)
We're here to pick up the van.

921
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,100
Have a seat.

922
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,600
The boss will be
right back.

923
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,200
Okay, the boss
will be right back, man.

924
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,200
Those burritos, man.

925
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Hey, man,
where's the bathroom?

926
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,700
Straight
in the back.

927
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,500
Yeah. Thanks.

928
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,400
Come on, cheeks.
Come on. Tighten up.

929
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
(Machines Make
Farting Sounds)

930
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Come on, cheeks.
Stay together.

931
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,100
Let's stay together.

932
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,100
(Loud Machinery Noise)

933
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,300
Come on, cheeks.
Stay together. Oh.

934
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,300
(Sizzle)

935
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Oh, God.
I hope that was a fart.

936
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,600
Oh, shit. Ah...

937
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,100
excuse me, sir.

938
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,600
(Machinery Noise)

939
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,600
What?

940
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,600
Where's
the toilet?

941
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,400
Over there.

942
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,600
Hey, excuse me.
Where's the toilet?

943
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,100
Oh, thank you very much.

944
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,600
Oh, shit.

945
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,800
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

946
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,200
(Muffled Voice)

947
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,600
Man, did you eat
one of them burritos, too, man?

948
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,100
Supposed to be eating

949
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,600
a little bit
of ice cream with it.

950
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,100
Come on, ice cream!

951
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,600
Even though we do not know
what we are looking for,

952
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,600
we do know the approximate value
of the weed itself.

953
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,900
Gentlemen, I would like
to hear your opinions.

954
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,600
A million?

955
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,200
The television set alone
is worth close to a million.

956
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,600
- A billion dollars.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

957
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,600
I'm freezing
at 200 million.

958
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,800
- Sarge, I think it's four billion.
- You're all wrong.

959
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,300
Nine billion big ones, boys.

960
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,200
And you know
what that means.

961
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,700
The better the bust...

962
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,700
- the bigger the boost.
- the bigger the boost.

963
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,300
Excellent.

964
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,600
Well, I guess
that about wraps it up.

965
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,400
Any questions?

966
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,000
(Flies Buzzing)

967
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,500
(Pedro) Where'd you learn how
to roll them big joints, man?

968
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,500
You like that, man?

969
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,000
Whoa. They're heavy.

970
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:11,000
I used to be a roadie
for the Doobie Brothers.

971
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,000
What a groovy gig.

972
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,500
Yeah. That's how I learned
to play drums.

973
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,500
Oh, yeah?

974
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,000
Beating
on the drums.

975
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,000
Hey, I dig Mexico,
man.

976
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,500
I'd like to
come back here

977
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,500
When
we got more time.

978
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,500
Are we at
the border already?

979
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,000
Looks that way, man.

980
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,800
Shit. Hey, man,
get rid of the stuff.

981
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, yeah.

982
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,500
Better get rid
of this shit.

983
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,500
(Inhales Deeply)

984
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,500
Man, put it down.
Get rid of it.

985
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,300
We're at the border,
man.

986
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,200
Shit.

987
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,500
Oh, lookit.

988
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,000
(Puffing)

989
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,900
Hey, get rid of it!
Not that way, man.

990
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,400
Throw it out!

991
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,900
Throw it out.

992
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,200
(Honking)

993
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,000
This is Toyota Kawasaki

994
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,000
here at the Mexican-
United States border

995
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,000
where a huge task force
of narcotic and customs agents

996
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,000
is preparing a surprise welcome
for a vehicle

997
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,200
which they
say is constructed

998
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,500
entirely of
high-grade marijuana.

999
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,900
Don't make that face,
man.

1000
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,400
You make me laugh.

1001
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,400
Okay, just let me
do all the talking.

1002
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,900
Good afternoon,
sisters.

1003
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Good afternoon,
officer.

1004
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,300
How long have you
been in Mexico?

1005
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,800
Okay, just be cool.

1006
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,800
How long have you guys
been in Mexico?

1007
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,300
A week--
I mean, a day.

1008
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,800
Which one is it,

1009
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,700
a week or a day?

1010
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,700
A weekday.

1011
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,500
You got
any narcotics

1012
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,000
or marijuana
in here?

1013
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,000
(Coughs)

1014
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,500
Uh, not anymore.

1015
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,200
You guys better step out
of that van.

1016
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,900
Aah! I'm on fire!

1017
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,700
Oh, Sister
is on fire!

1018
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,800
(Dog Barking)

1019
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,300
Hey, this looks
like a bust.

1020
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,500
Get Stedenko on the phone.
This may be it.

1021
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,800
Hey, come on.
What have we got here, Sister?

1022
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,900
Hey, they're busting
nuns, man.

1023
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Wow.
That's cold-blooded.

1024
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,500
Hey, let's watch.

1025
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,000
Okay, up against the wall.
All of you.

1026
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,500
Spread them.

1027
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,100
Let's get up
against the wall.

1028
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,000
(Kawasaki)
Sergeant Stedenko,

1029
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,000
exactly what
are you looking for?

1030
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,500
Dope, drugs,
weed, grass,

1031
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,000
toot, smack,
quackers,

1032
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,000
uppers, downers,
all-arounders.

1033
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,500
You name it,
we want it.

1034
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,500
And how important
is it to you

1035
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,000
to apprehend
the suspects?

1036
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,200
Critical-- The buying and selling
of dope in this country

1037
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,700
may be the last vestige
of free enterprise left.

1038
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,200
There's rumor,
Sergeant,

1039
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,700
that the suspects
might be armed and dangerous.

1040
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,500
Do you expect
to see any violence here today?

1041
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,000
I certainly
hope so.

1042
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,900
Sergeant, have you yourself
smoked marijuana?

1043
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,000
Only once.

1044
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,500
Hey, look,
we're on TV, man.

1045
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,500
Sergeant, telephone.

1046
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,500
Hi, Mom.

1047
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,000
This could be it.

1048
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,400
(Man Stoner)
Why are there so many cops?

1049
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,900
Let's find out.

1050
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,300
Listen, I got to
go pee first.

1051
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,000
Okay, don't go
scuba diving.

1052
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,300
So it was a station wagon,
huh, Harry?

1053
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,800
Very devious.

1054
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,800
And they almost
look like real nuns,

1055
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,300
don't they, Harry?

1056
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,800
Down to
the stockings.

1057
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,600
Very clever.
Very clever.

1058
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,000
Not bad.

1059
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,000
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself,

1060
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,500
you know that?

1061
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,000
Reminds me of a funny story
my dad told me.

1062
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,000
The only kind of meat

1063
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,000
a priest could eat
on Friday was nun.

1064
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,500
Inside!

1065
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,500
Harry, get a sample
of that car.

1066
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,000
Yes, Sergeant.

1067
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,500
(Whimpering)

1068
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,000
Start the interrogation,
Murphy.

1069
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,500
I'll be right back.

1070
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,500
(Sniffing)

1071
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,000
(Barking)

1072
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,600
Hey, what's going on
out there, man?

1073
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,600
Huh? Excuse me.
What's going on out there?

1074
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,100
Don't worry about it, buddy.
It's nothing.

1075
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,600
Just some people doing
what they're not supposed to do.

1076
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,100
Son of a bitch.
Look at the--

1077
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,100
Some asshole
pissed on my leg!

1078
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,600
Listen, our agent
just phoned from Mexico.

1079
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,100
It's not a bunch of nuns
in a station wagon.

1080
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,600
It's two hippies
in a green van.

1081
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,900
Must be
some heavy shit.

1082
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,400
Let's go!
Come on!

1083
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,900
Get that
siren up!

1084
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,500
Where would these
two creeps hang out?

1085
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,500
Where do hippies
hang out today?

1086
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Sunset Strip--
That's where they hang out.

1087
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Yeah, we could
try there.

1088
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,100
If they're not there,

1089
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,200
we could go up
to San Francisco.

1090
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,700
Imagine the field day

1091
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,600
those two creeps
are gonna have

1092
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,600
when they find out
that van is made of grass.

1093
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
(Siren)

1094
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,800
Huh?

1095
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,400
(Stedenko)
I don't believe it. I really don't.

1096
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,900
You guys
are supreme idiots.

1097
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,400
How could you let
a big green van

1098
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,100
slip right through
your fingers?

1099
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,600
Spend one week
at the border,

1100
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,100
and what do we
end up with?

1101
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,600
Busting
a bevy of nuns,

1102
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,400
a guy
pisses on my leg,

1103
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,800
and I lose my special canine
sentry dog--

1104
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,600
Best cop
I ever knew.

1105
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,300
See anything?

1106
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,400
Negative.

1107
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,100
Well, use mine.
They're on the floor.

1108
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,100
Oh, yeah.
These are great, Sergeant.

1109
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,500
You can see everything.

1110
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,000
What do you see?

1111
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,500
You know, there's a great
donut shop up there.

1112
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,000
Do we have time--

1113
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,000
No! No!
I mean on the road!

1114
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,100
Wait a minute.
There's the van.

1115
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,400
There's the van!

1116
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,700
Yeah, that's it.

1117
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,000
(Man Stoner)
Hey, listen, man.

1118
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,500
When we get back to town,

1119
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,700
let's get serious
about this group, okay?

1120
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,200
Yeah, really, man.

1121
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,400
Like, if we practice
all the time,

1122
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,000
we could have
a heavy band.

1123
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,600
Let's not let anything
interfere with our music.

1124
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,600
Yeah, that's right.

1125
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,900
Hey, you see
what I see, man?

1126
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,600
Yeah...

1127
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,100
Hey, they're
hitchhiking, man.

1128
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,100
(Honking)

1129
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,100
(Siren)

1130
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,900
(Stedenko)
There they go, Harry.

1131
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,400
Keep your eye
on them.

1132
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,900
(Man Stoner) Wonder
what they're doing way out here.

1133
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,400
I don't know,

1134
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,400
but here comes
the Mounties to the rescue.

1135
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,400
Holy...

1136
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,500
Wow.

1137
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,900
Turn around, Harry.
They're over there.

1138
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,300
Keep your eye
on them, Harry!

1139
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,500
Hey, man, you know
how to drive, man?

1140
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,800
Sort of. Why?

1141
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,200
Take over, man.

1142
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,900
Hey, what are you
doing, man?

1143
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,900
Hi, ladies.

1144
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,900
Hi.

1145
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,400
Hey, entrez vous,
alla yous.

1146
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,400
Thanks.

1147
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,000
There you go.
Watch your step.

1148
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,500
I'll watch
everything else.

1149
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,500
(Mumbling)

1150
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,000
Hey,
what's happening?

1151
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,500
How far are you
going, man?

1152
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,200
All the way.

1153
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,500
All right.

1154
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,500
We're going there
ourselves.

1155
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,000
Come on over.

1156
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,500
(Stedenko)
There they go, Harry!

1157
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,000
I see them.

1158
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,500
Shoot
their tires out!

1159
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,000
Got it.

1160
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,100
No, not yours.
Use my gun.

1161
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,500
(Gunshot)

1162
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,700
Oh, my God!

1163
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,700
Damn it!
You stupid idiot!

1164
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,200
Look, you idiot!

1165
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,700
You are a stupid,
stupid man!

1166
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,200
Get over here, Harry!

1167
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,700
Get over here.
Give me that gun.

1168
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,000
When I think of
the time and money

1169
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,500
I've wasted
on your training,

1170
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,500
and you still turn out to be
a blithering idiot!

1171
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,800
You're
an utter failure!

1172
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,200
You make me sick!

1173
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,100
Have you anything
to say for yourself?

1174
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,400
In the car!

1175
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,900
God, I will never,
ever, never

1176
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,600
take a baldheaded man
in the department again.

1177
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,100
Wow.
This is a neat van.

1178
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,100
Yeah. Want to see
the rest of it?

1179
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,500
Sure.

1180
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,800
Okay, we'll go
right back there.

1181
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,500
The rest of it
is right back there.

1182
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,300
Go ahead.
Watch your step.

1183
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,800
Yeah. There you go.

1184
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,900
Yeah,
right back there.

1185
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,500
Hey, have fun at
Magic Mountains.

1186
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,200
Oh, yeah. I see London.
I see France.

1187
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,200
If I ain't out
in three weeks, man,

1188
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,700
send a search party.

1189
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,800
Hey, hold on.
Don't start without me.

1190
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,400
Want to do a lude?

1191
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,900
(Loudly)
You got ludes?

1192
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,800
No, I don't have
any ludes!

1193
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,300
I wish I had ludes.

1194
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,500
I thought you said
you had some.

1195
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,300
(Loudly)
No, I don't have some.

1196
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,900
(Whispering)
I don't have enough.

1197
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,300
Oh, right.
All right.

1198
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,500
I wish I had some,
you know.

1199
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,000
I love a manly chest.

1200
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,500
Yeah. So do I...

1201
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,300
I mean, on a girl.

1202
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,800
Attention,
all units.

1203
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,300
This is Sergeant
Stedenko.

1204
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,800
Attention,
all units.

1205
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,300
This is Sergeant
Stedenko.

1206
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,900
We are changing
from a code 3 direct pursuit

1207
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,400
to a code 34 7--
completely lost

1208
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,100
due to
incompetence.

1209
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,500
These chicks are going
to the Roxy, man.

1210
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,000
They're having a battle
of the bands there, man.

1211
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Debbie was telling me
all about it.

1212
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,100
The winner
gets a record contract.

1213
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,600
A battle
of the bands?

1214
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,000
It's like the best thing
in the world.

1215
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,500
Everyone's going to be there
and everything.

1216
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
The winner gets
a record contract, man.

1217
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,000
That's not
going to mean dick

1218
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,500
unless they promote you,
you know.

1219
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,300
We could enter our band.
We could win.

1220
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,300
It's $ 1 00, too.

1221
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,100
We couldn't enter.
We don't even know any tunes yet.

1222
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,300
What do you mean?
We had two rehearsals.

1223
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,000
Besides,
it's just punk rock.

1224
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,000
You don't have to
know how to play.

1225
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,500
You just got to be a punk.
We could do that.

1226
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,000
We got to get loaded
first, though.

1227
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,500
Yeah, we should
get loaded.

1228
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,000
We need
some smoke, man.

1229
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,500
Jeez, we need to
score a lid.

1230
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,000
Stop,
and I'll call Gloria.

1231
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,000
Who's Gloria?

1232
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,800
Hi. You're looking good.

1233
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,700
You want to go,
like, powder our noses?

1234
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,700
Anyway, I want to
talk some business, okay?

1235
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,700
Yeah.
I got the powder.

1236
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,500
She's got the best stuff,
I'm telling you.

1237
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Boy, she can
bust me anytime.

1238
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,200
You should see
her summer whites.

1239
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,500
In here.

1240
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,100
Wow. That's heavy.

1241
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,100
Yeah, man, but I bet
a lot of cops

1242
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,100
smoke dope now,
you know.

1243
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,600
No, I mean,
look at that, man.

1244
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,800
Looks like a radio station.

1245
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,100
The request lines
are now open!

1246
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,600
KGFJ soul
radio-o-o-o-o-o!

1247
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,000
Do it now, man.

1248
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,100
Request lines are now--

1249
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,600
(Echoing)

1250
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,600
It's open, man.

1251
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,900
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1252
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,100
All right, Officer Clyde,
contact headquarters

1253
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,200
and give them
our present location.

1254
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,400
And then I'm going
to take off your dress...

1255
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,900
(Panting)

1256
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,900
and then I'm going
to take off your bra...

1257
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,400
Ha ha ha!

1258
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,900
and then I'm going
to take off your shoes.

1259
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,500
Whew. Whew.

1260
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,000
Hello, hello,
hello, hello, hello.

1261
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,500
Can you hear me?

1262
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,100
Hello, headquarters?
Hello, headquarters?

1263
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,600
Come in, headquarters.

1264
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,900
This is Officer Clyde.

1265
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,900
Use the code name.
The code name.

1266
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,900
Headquarters.
Headquarters, come in, please.

1267
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,300
This is code name
Hardhead.

1268
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,800
Hat! Hard Hat.
Give me that.

1269
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,300
Hello,
radio dispatch?

1270
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,300
This is code name
Hard Hat.

1271
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,000
Do you read me?
Over.

1272
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,800
Was that Lard Ass?

1273
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,400
Ha!

1274
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,800
Hard Hat.
Code name Hard Hat.

1275
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,200
Do you read,
radio dispatch?

1276
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,200
Hey, got something
for you, Lard Ass.

1277
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,300
Hard Hat!

1278
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,400
Hard Hat!
Do you understand?

1279
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,300
Lard Ass! Lard Ass!

1280
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,400
Hard Hat!

1281
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,800
Radio dispatch,
do you know who this is?

1282
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,900
No. Who is ''this is''?

1283
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,400
This is
Sergeant Stedenko.

1284
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,000
Oh, yeah?
You know who this is?

1285
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,600
No.

1286
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,500
Bye-bye, Lard Ass.

1287
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,400
(Tires Screeching)

1288
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,400
(Horn Honking)

1289
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,400
(Stedenko)
Attention, headquarters.

1290
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,300
Attention, headquarters.
This is code name Lard--

1291
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,800
This is code name
Hard Hat.

1292
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,900
Any sighting of them
in the last half-hour?

1293
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,300
They burnt the stash
they had.

1294
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,800
Oh, no.

1295
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,800
Yeah. Can you
believe it?

1296
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,800
They burned the whole thing
yesterday.

1297
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,000
Oh, no.

1298
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,300
They're expecting
a new one from Tijuana...

1299
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,800
I was
in Tijuana once.

1300
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,300
...worth millions
and millions of dollars.

1301
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,300
Ohh.

1302
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,900
The cops are out
looking for it now.

1303
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,900
Jesus, I hope
they find it.

1304
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,900
If they find it,
set aside some lids for me.

1305
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,800
Well, you can believe
we'll have a party.

1306
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,000
Why don't we just,
like, split, okay?

1307
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,400
Glo, see you.

1308
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,900
You want me to give your number
to that guy, let me know.

1309
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,000
What's that?

1310
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,900
I can't believe
they burned all this.

1311
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,400
Hey, I got to
go to the bathroom.

1312
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,900
I'll meet you guys
outside, okay?

1313
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,800
(Whistling)

1314
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,300
Hey, homes.

1315
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,300
Come on, man.

1316
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,300
(Whistling)

1317
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:46,300
Sometimes when you got to go
really bad, you can't, you know?

1318
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,300
Come on, man.

1319
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,300
You wanted to go
out there.

1320
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,300
I'll put you
back in the closet.

1321
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,400
I think he's got
stage fright, man.

1322
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,900
Come on, man.

1323
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,400
Ohh.

1324
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,900
Ahh, yeah.
That's the one.

1325
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,400
Oh, hey, man.

1326
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,400
Thanks
an awful lot, man.

1327
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,900
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1328
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,400
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1329
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,900
Come on! Look at--Hey!

1330
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,900
I'm sorry.

1331
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,600
Hey, come ba--

1332
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,900
Jesus!

1333
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,800
(Telephone Ringing)

1334
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,900
(Pedro) Hey, everybody be quiet.
I'm calling home.

1335
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,700
Hello. Who's this?

1336
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,200
James! Man, hey, listen.

1337
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,300
We got a gig
at the Roxy, man.

1338
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,900
So get the guys, okay?

1339
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,300
All right, man.
Be sure to be there.

1340
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,800
See you later.

1341
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,800
All right.
It's together, man.

1342
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,300
We're going to be there.

1343
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,300
We're going to take
this battle of the bands.

1344
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,800
(Engine Starts)

1345
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,300
Does this show?

1346
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,300
Uh, yeah, they sure do.

1347
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,300
No. I mean this,
this spot.

1348
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,800
Let's see.

1349
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,300
Yeah, a little bit.

1350
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,900
I'll take it out
for you.

1351
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,900
Will you?

1352
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,900
Sure.Just take it off.

1353
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,800
(Siren)

1354
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,300
(Jade)
I can stay here.

1355
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,800
I'll just
do it here, okay?

1356
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,300
Oh, hey, hey, no, man.
Get in the back.

1357
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,800
Get in the back.
Get in the back.

1358
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,800
Okay.

1359
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,400
Get in the back.

1360
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,200
Whoa!

1361
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,300
Okay.Jesus.

1362
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,200
Hey, Pedro?

1363
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,300
Pedro?

1364
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,800
What's the matter?

1365
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,300
Pedro!

1366
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,200
You still like me,
don't you?

1367
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,700
Pedro, come here, man.

1368
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,800
He is so sweet,
you know?

1369
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,100
Pedro, get out here.

1370
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,300
Man, where'd you learn
how to drive?

1371
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,300
We got stopped
by the cops.

1372
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,800
I don't have a license.

1373
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,800
Why didn't
you tell me that?

1374
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,900
What are we going to do?

1375
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,300
Oh, shit.

1376
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,800
Change places
with me.

1377
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,500
I don't think
he's seen us.

1378
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,000
No, no. Sit down.

1379
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,000
I've got my leg caught.

1380
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,800
Man, like,
get over, man.

1381
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,300
What do you guys want?

1382
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,800
(Chuckling)

1383
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,300
Nothing.

1384
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:57,400
You mind if I have
a bite of your hot dog?

1385
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,800
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, man.

1386
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,600
You can have
the whole thing.

1387
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,800
Thanks.

1388
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,700
Want some Fritos?

1389
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,300
No. This is fine.

1390
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,900
Thank you.

1391
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,800
Hey, you guys have
a nice day.

1392
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,300
Thank you.

1393
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,000
Hey, man.

1394
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,200
What?

1395
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,300
You're squashing
my nuts.

1396
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,600
Oh.

1397
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,300
Hey, did that
really happen?

1398
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,700
What was that dude's
trip, man?

1399
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,300
I thought we were
going to get busted.

1400
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,300
Shh. It might be
a trick.

1401
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,400
Okay, sit there
and be cool.

1402
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,800
Oh, shit.

1403
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,300
Look at him, man.

1404
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,900
I wonder what
he's been smoking.

1405
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,200
Whatever it is,
I wish we had some, man.

1406
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,300
No kidding.

1407
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,300
We got to score some.

1408
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,800
Yeah, but where, man?

1409
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,800
There's got to be
somebody in this town

1410
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,700
that's got
a lot of smoke.

1411
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,300
(Siren)

1412
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,800
Ha ha ha!

1413
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,200
I want all you mothers
off the street

1414
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:19,000
All you lambs
off this bloody beat

1415
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,800
Well, my freedom's
just begun

1416
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,000
So if you can't rock,
you'd better run

1417
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,400
A new age is on the rise

1418
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,700
With safety pins
stuck in their eyes

1419
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,300
The time has come,
let's get it down

1420
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,700
Let's find
the weirdest band in town

1421
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,400
At the rock fight

1422
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,900
Tonight there's gonna be
a rock fight

1423
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,300
A highfalutin,
tootin' rock fight

1424
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,200
There might even be
a fistfight

1425
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,000
At the rock fight

1426
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:56,000
We'll be
rock-'n'-rollin' all night

1427
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,900
Long-haired music
is what it's all about

1428
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,200
Rock-'n'-roll
turned inside out

1429
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,300
Who's that lady
that's lying on the floor?

1430
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,500
Need some speed
to dance some more

1431
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,700
Guitars wailin' out
a tune

1432
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,400
Groovin',
howling at the moon

1433
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,300
Oh, baby,
those purple eyes

1434
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,400
Dimpled cheeks
and satin thighs

1435
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,700
Don't take the kiddies
to the zoo

1436
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,900
Wait awhile,
I'm going to take you

1437
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,600
To the rock fight

1438
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,200
Tonight there's gonna be
a rock fight

1439
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,100
A highfalutin,
tootin' rock fight

1440
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,800
There might even be
a fistfight

1441
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,100
At the rock fight

1442
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,500
They'll be
rock-'n'-rollin' all night

1443
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,300
She was, like, nuts.

1444
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,800
You could always tell
if she was balling her old man.

1445
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,800
Everyone would be
dozing off,

1446
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,300
and all of a sudden
she'd start up.

1447
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,300
First it would start like--

1448
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,600
Ohh. Ohh. Ohh. Ohh.

1449
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,600
But then she'd
really get going,

1450
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,900
and she'd be more like--

1451
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,500
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1452
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:13,100
And she'd start going
like a motorboat, you know?

1453
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,800
Fu-u-uck me, Alex!

1454
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,800
Her boyfriend's name
was Alex.

1455
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:24,900
Fu-u-uck me-e-e-e!

1456
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,400
Fuck me, Alex!

1457
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,100
Fuck me, Alex!
Fuck me, Alex!

1458
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,100
Oh, I got a cramp!

1459
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,800
Oh! Got a cramp!

1460
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,100
Yeah! Yeah!

1461
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,600
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Oh, God!

1462
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,300
Yeah. That's just like it.
You're doing good.

1463
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,800
Ow! Ow!

1464
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,900
Oh, yeah! Oh!

1465
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,600
Ow! Ow!

1466
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,300
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

1467
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,900
Ow! Ow!

1468
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,400
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1469
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,900
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

1470
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:55,900
There.

1471
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,400
Oh, yeah!
That's just like it.

1472
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,900
Then she'd have,
like, two tears.

1473
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,800
Oh, it's better.
It's out. It's out.

1474
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,400
Ahh, it's better.

1475
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,800
Oh, that feels
better. Oh, God.

1476
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,400
Shit.
I need some air.

1477
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,400
(Cheering)

1478
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,900
Right on, man.

1479
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,400
I didn't know
your name was Alex, man.

1480
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,900
Oh, I got a cramp.

1481
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,800
Shit, I'd have
a cramp there, too.

1482
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,100
What's going on
out here?

1483
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,300
Hey! Hey! You don't even know
where you're going.

1484
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,000
Wait for me.

1485
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,300
Make way
for the new king.

1486
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,300
Goddamn.
You're a star, man.

1487
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,200
Go ahead.
After you, King Salami.

1488
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,300
They're going to be sorry.

1489
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,000
Like, I know where
the best dressing room is.

1490
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,100
Ooh, yeah, yeah!

1491
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,800
Ba-ba-ba-ba,
ooh, yeah, yeah

1492
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,200
Well, I'm living so fast

1493
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,100
So you better
feel it, baby

1494
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,100
I got no place to go

1495
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,700
I mean, it's so socko,
so socko

1496
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,000
So very socko

1497
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,900
So socko

1498
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So very socko

1499
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,100
So socko

1500
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,200
So very socko

1501
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,000
Baby, I'm just so socko

1502
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,300
So socko...

1503
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,400
Acting like a bum...

1504
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,300
The next day, he comes
up to me, and he says,

1505
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,300
''Thanks for being there.
like, you saved my life.''

1506
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,700
Just like Cher.

1507
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,100
(Humming)

1508
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,400
Hey, man,
what are you doing?

1509
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,300
Come on, man.
Get it together.

1510
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,000
We're on
in two more bands.

1511
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,400
You ought to hear what
these other groups are into.

1512
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,800
These kids
are into something heavy.

1513
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,300
I've been writing
this new song.

1514
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,300
Mama talkin' to me,
tryin' to tell me how to live

1515
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,400
(Humming)

1516
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,900
'Cause I don't
listen to her

1517
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:14,300
'Cause my head
is like a sieve

1518
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,900
Hey, man, are you awake?

1519
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,100
I don't feel
so good, man.

1520
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,800
Did you try
to give him some pills?

1521
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,300
Yeah, I tried,
but I gave him ups.

1522
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,300
Shit, man. Come on.

1523
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,600
Hey, how many
fingers you see?

1524
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,700
Uh...

1525
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,700
I think I fucked up.

1526
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,500
Oh, shit. Anybody got
any coffee or anything?

1527
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,900
I got a popper.

1528
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,300
We could either party later
or try to start his heart.

1529
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,800
Get on the level.
Get up.

1530
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,300
Huh?

1531
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,800
Okay, come on. Up.

1532
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,300
Oh, shit.
Watch where you're going.

1533
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,800
You're not dying.

1534
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,800
You know
what I'm saying?

1535
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:10,800
While I got you here,
I was thinking

1536
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,800
maybe we should have
some paper between us,

1537
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,300
because in this business

1538
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,300
a handshake
doesn't mean dick.

1539
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,200
Everybody into the van.
Hurry! Hurry!

1540
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,200
Come on. Come on.

1541
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,700
All right.
Harry, come on.

1542
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
Look at all these freaks.

1543
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,300
(Horn Honking)

1544
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,300
Zipping down.

1545
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,600
Aha! There's one of them.

1546
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,300
(Tambourines Playing)

1547
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,800
You know, I would
totally die for you.

1548
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,300
You know what I mean?

1549
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,800
(Unintelligible)

1550
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,400
Well, you dance
and rock all wrong

1551
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,800
Summer of love
is 1 0 years gone

1552
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,600
You know in 1 0 years, baby,
I'll be gone

1553
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,100
But I'm now

1554
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,500
Flowers in your hair

1555
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,600
'Cause there's nothing
under there

1556
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,700
Peace and love
for free

1557
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,200
They don't mean
a thing to me

1558
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,000
Join our band

1559
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,100
Baby, we're through

1560
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,800
I want to be like me.

1561
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,800
Like, I have my own special
way of looking and dressing.

1562
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,300
That's me.

1563
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

1564
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,700
Taurus.

1565
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,800
Piss off!

1566
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,900
Mother's nice,
and Daddy's nice

1567
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,500
Say it again,
and you say it twice

1568
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:08,400
I'd be telling you
a pack of lies

1569
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,100
And you'd be burying me
through moonlit eyes

1570
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,800
But you are rocking out
in bi-school

1571
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,700
I want to go
to your school

1572
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,800
I don't want to go
to my school

1573
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,300
'Cause I want to go
to bi-school

1574
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,200
(Chanting)

1575
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,200
Everybody in, boys.
All the way down.

1576
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,700
That's right, boys.

1577
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,200
We want to
talk to you boys

1578
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,700
about joining
your order.

1579
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,600
What size sheet
do you wear?

1580
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,200
(Horn Honking)

1581
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:49,700
Mmm ba-ba,
mmm ba-ba

1582
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,300
Hey! Hold on.

1583
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,300
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1584
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,800
Can I see
some tickets, guys?

1585
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,300
We don't need tickets.

1586
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,300
We are brothers
of the faith.

1587
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,800
We don't need tickets
to walk with love.

1588
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,300
We got to
see tickets.

1589
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,000
All right. We are not
brothers of the faith.

1590
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,400
We are police officers.

1591
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,100
Sorry, man.
You got to have tickets.

1592
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,300
Let's have some tickets.

1593
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,800
No. That is a gun.
That is not a ticket.

1594
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,600
Did you bring the I.D.?

1595
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,700
No. Uh-uh.

1596
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,900
We have got to
get in here right now.

1597
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,200
This is very important.

1598
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,700
Hey, Sarge.
The van.

1599
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,400
Huh? The van!

1600
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,000
Jeez, no wonder
Anita Bryant's pissed off.

1601
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,200
(Horn Honking)

1602
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,700
Hey! Hey! Wait a minute.

1603
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,700
Hey, you!

1604
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,700
Hey, where are you taking
this tow truck?

1605
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,200
Where are you going
with our van?

1606
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,200
Take a walk.

1607
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,200
What do you mean,
take a walk? Who are you?

1608
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,600
Who owns this van?

1609
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,900
Who are you, anyway?

1610
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,300
Sergeant Stedenko.

1611
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,800
Sergeant Stedenko.
What van?

1612
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,300
What do you mean?
This van right here.

1613
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,300
(Driver)
Let's see some I.D.

1614
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,800
Hold it right there.

1615
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,300
Hold it right there.
Come back here.

1616
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,300
Tell him
we didn't do nothing.

1617
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,800
You didn't do
a damn thing.

1618
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,800
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

1619
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,300
Hey, you know
who he is?

1620
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,800
Tell him, boss.

1621
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,300
Benny, shut up.

1622
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,200
We got to call
the paddy wagon.

1623
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,200
Moving right along,

1624
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,700
we don't know
who they are,

1625
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,200
but here's Alice Bowie.

1626
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,200
Don't worry about it.

1627
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,900
If you die,
I'm the manager.

1628
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,700
(Band Warming Up)

1629
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,200
(Cheering)

1630
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,700
You'd better be good.

1631
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,200
Look, I'm not just in it
for the money.

1632
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,700
I really like it.

1633
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,900
Hi. Hi.

1634
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,200
Jade East.

1635
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,700
(Cheering)

1636
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,200
(Booing)

1637
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,700
You're the worst!

1638
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,400
You guys really
had a scheme going, didn't you?

1639
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,700
Thought you'd
get away with it?

1640
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,100
Almost $9 billion.

1641
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,200
Nine billion big ones
to help disease young minds

1642
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,700
with marijuana, smack,
toot, crackers, you name it.

1643
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,200
Sarge, the wagons
are on their way.

1644
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,700
Do you realize
that this is the bust?

1645
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,700
This is the one that will
send me to the top.

1646
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,100
Nail it down, man.

1647
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,800
(Stedenko)
Harry?

1648
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,200
What?

1649
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,700
Are you sure
you talked to headquarters?

1650
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,700
They said
they're on their way.

1651
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,200
How about a cheeseburger?

1652
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,700
No. A sundae.

1653
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,700
Hot fudge?

1654
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,200
With some whipped
cream on top, nuts.

1655
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,200
What's this?

1656
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,700
They're anchovies.

1657
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,400
Ah, good. Thanks.

1658
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,600
I'll buy you
something to eat.

1659
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,700
I'm stoned.

1660
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,200
Yes, you are
very, very stoned.

1661
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,200
Look at this.

1662
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,400
(Giggling)

1663
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,700
Sick! You've got food
all over your uniform.

1664
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,600
You've got no self-control
whatsoever.

1665
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,700
Come on, man!
Let's do it!

1666
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,900
(Booing)

1667
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,300
Do something!

1668
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,400
(Cheering)

1669
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,200
All right!
You guys ready?

1670
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,900
(Cheering)

1671
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,800
1 , 2, 3!

1672
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,200
Yeah!

1673
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,200
My mama talkin' to me,
trying to tell me how to live

1674
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,200
But I won't
listen to her

1675
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,200
Because my head
is like a sieve

1676
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,300
My daddy,
he disowned me

1677
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,000
Because I wear
my sister's clothes

1678
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,400
He caught me in the bathroom
with a pair of panty hose

1679
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,600
My basketball coach,
he done kicked me off the team

1680
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,700
For wearing
high-heeled sneakers

1681
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:41,200
And acting like a queen

1682
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,200
Why don't you guys
admit it?

1683
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,700
You got the munchies,
right?

1684
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,100
I've never seen anything
so disgusting in all my life.

1685
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,600
You've let me down, boys.

1686
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,600
Harry, are you
understanding me?

1687
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,600
I am stoned!
I am stoned!

1688
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,100
So go with it.

1689
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,700
Put it
in your sundae.

1690
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,200
Go with it?
Get away from...

1691
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,700
You almost botch up
the entire operation,

1692
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,200
you lose my best dog,

1693
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,200
two guys piss on my leg,

1694
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,200
and you tell me
to go with it?

1695
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,700
I'll go with it!

1696
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,800
Go with it.
G-go with it.

1697
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:21,800
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1698
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,200
I'm so bloody rich!

1699
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,400
I only know
three chords!

1700
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,900
You fools!

1701
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,700
(Yelling Unintelligibly)

1702
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:32,100
(Audience Chanting)
More! More! More!

1703
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:42,000
More! More! More!

1704
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,800
(Humming)

1705
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,400
My mama talkin' to me,
trying to tell me how to live

1706
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,200
(Humming)

1707
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,200
Wow. Did you hear
that crowd?

1708
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,300
They gave us
a standing ovation.

1709
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,200
We're going to have
a bad band.

1710
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:59,200
We had them eating right
out of their hands.

1711
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,700
We're going to be
big, man, really big.

1712
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,200
We'll be bigger
than Ruben and the Jets.

1713
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,700
All we got to do
is keep practicing,

1714
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,700
just keep it together.

1715
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,200
I feel good, man.

1716
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,700
I wish we had something
to celebrate.

1717
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,900
You got a joint
or anything?

1718
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,100
Hey.

1719
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,300
What? We getting
pulled over?

1720
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,200
I just remembered.
I got some hash.

1721
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,200
Oh, yeah?
Fire it up, homes.

1722
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,100
I need a pin or something.

1723
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:27,200
There's a pin right here
on my tutu, man.

1724
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,200
Be brave and remind me
to take those back.

1725
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,700
We'll get charged
for an extra day.

1726
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,200
I forgot all about this.

1727
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,700
We're going to have
a limo, man,

1728
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,600
and food backstage,
man, everything.

1729
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,700
We need a manager.
That's the only thing.

1730
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,800
My cousin.

1731
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,700
He doesn't have a job.

1732
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,700
We'll make him
the manager.

1733
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,200
He's got a van.
It'll be heavy.

1734
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,300
We'll be the heaviest
dudes, man,

1735
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,000
Get all-new instruments,
man, everything.

1736
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,200
All right.

1737
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,700
What's this?

1738
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,200
I think it's hash.

1739
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,000
It doesn't
look like much.

1740
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,700
Where'd it go?

1741
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,200
I don't know.

1742
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,200
Oh! Aah!

1743
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,700
Hey, watch the road, man.

1744
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:09,900
Aah! Aah!

1745
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,200
Oh, shit!

1746
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,600
Hey! Hey!
Watch the road!

1747
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,000
Aah! Ow!

1748
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,200
Oh, shit!

1749
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,700
Hey, man,
you dropped it in my lap!

1750
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,200
Well, stop the car.

1751
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,100
Reach your hand
down there.

1752
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,300
Stop the car. Here.

1753
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,300
Cabron,
my huevos is too hot.

1754
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,100
Ydespues I choke

1755
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,300
Oh, shit!

1756
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:31,700
Ytodo mis care

1757
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,700
Go up in smoke

1758
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,400
Come on,
let's go get high

1759
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,600
Up in smoke

1760
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:44,100
That's where
I want to be

1761
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,900
'Cause when I'm high

1762
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,100
The world below
don't bother me

1763
01:23:55,700 --> 01:24:05,200
When life begins to be
one long and dangerous road

1764
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:08,300
I take a toke

1765
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:12,900
And all my cares
go up in smoke

1766
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:22,300
Hay gente que se mortifica
all the time

1767
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:32,600
Se hacen viejos
antes de su tiempo

1768
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:42,100
But I say arabata
all the gusto you can find

1769
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Porque all of the time
get high, high

1770
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,900
Come on,
let's go get high

1771
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,200
Up in smoke

1772
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:03,100
That's where
I want to be

1773
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,900
'Cause when I'm high

1774
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:11,300
The world below
don't bother me

1775
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:22,500
When life begins to be
one long and dangerous road

1776
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,500
I take a toke

1777
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:31,200
And all my cares
go up in smoke...

1778
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,500
I take a toke

1779
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,100
And all my cares

1780
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:41,100
Go up in smoke
