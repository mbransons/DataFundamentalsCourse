00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:20,220
<i>When you see a guy</i>
<i>reach for stars in the sky</i>

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,213
<i>You can bet that he's doing it</i>
<i>for some doll</i>

3
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:28,417
<i>When you spot a John</i>
<i>waiting out in the rain</i>

4
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:32,488
<i>Chances are he's insane</i>
<i>as only a John can be for a Jane</i>

5
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:36,725
<i>When you meet a gent</i>
<i>paying all kinds of rent</i>

6
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,030
<i>For a flat that could flatten</i>
<i>the Taj Mahal</i>

7
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,309
<i>Call it sad</i>
<i>Call it funny</i>

8
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,311
<i>But it's better than even money</i>

9
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:49,304
<i>That the guy's only doin' it</i>
<i>for some doll</i>

10
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,756
<i>Your eyes are the eyes</i>

11
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:00,427
<i>Of a woman in love</i>

12
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,262
<i>And, oh</i>

13
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:06,255
<i>How they give you away</i>

14
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,503
<i>Why try to deny</i>

15
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:14,307
<i>You're a woman in love</i>

16
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,744
<i>When I know very well</i>

17
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,737
<i>What I say</i>

18
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,713
<i>I got the horse right here</i>
<i>The name is Paul Revere</i>

19
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,849
<i>And here's a guy that says</i>
<i>if the weather's clear</i>

20
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,785
<i>Can do, can do</i>

21
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,922
<i>This guy says the horse can do</i>

22
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,915
<i>If he says the horse can do</i>

23
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,931
<i>I'm pickin' Valentine</i>
<i>'cause on the mornin' line</i>

24
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,934
<i>The guy has got him figured</i>
<i>at five to nine</i>

25
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,937
<i>But look at Epitaph</i>
<i>He wins it by a half</i>

26
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,040
<i>According to this here</i>
<i>in the</i> Telegraph

27
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,009
<i>For Paul Revere I'll bite</i>
<i>I hear his foot's all right</i>

28
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,012
<i>Of course it all depends</i>
<i>if it rained last night</i>

29
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,082
<i>I know it's Valentine</i>
<i>The morning works look fine</i>

30
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,419
<i>You know, the jockeyâ€™s brother's</i>
<i>a friend of mine</i>

31
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,155
<i>Just a minute, boys</i>
<i>I got the feed box noise</i>

32
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,091
<i>It says the great grandfather</i>
<i>was Equipois</i>

33
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,094
<i>I tell you Paul Revere</i>
<i>Now this is no bum steer</i>

34
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,164
<i>It's from a handicapper</i>
<i>that's real sincere</i>

35
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,100
<i>I give you Valentine</i>
<i>'cause on the mornin' line</i>

36
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,170
<i>The guy has got him figured</i>
<i>at five to nine</i>

37
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,173
<i>So make it Epitaph</i>
<i>He wins it by a half</i>

38
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,676
<i>According to this here</i>
<i>in the</i> Telegraph

39
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,178

<i>Right here</i>

<i>Follow the fold</i>
<i>and stray no more</i>

44
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,029
<i>Stray no more</i>

45
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,812
<i>Put down the bottle</i>

00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,016

48
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:34,009
<i>Follow the fold</i>
<i>and stray no more</i>

49
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,726
<i>Tear up your poker deck</i>

50
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,962
<i>And play no more</i>

51
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,955
<i>Follow, follow the fold</i>

52
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,139
Friends, my name is Sarah Brown.

53
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,108
This is no place to make a speech,
and I'm not going to try.

54
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,912
You don't want to be told
how unhappy you are.

55
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,905
You don't want to be told
about the emptiness of your lives.

56
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,818
You who drink too much...

57
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,811
you who gamble at cards,
dice and horse racing...

58
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,692
let us help you not to lose
your hard-earned money...

59
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,727
in gambling dens
and bookie joints.

60
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,729
This doll has captured
my attention.

61
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,266
Let us give you the strength
to stop your drinking and gambling.

62
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,068
She has lost me.

63
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,804
Let us welcome you
to the Save-A-Soul Mission.

64
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,806
- Just around the corner.
- Come to me!

65
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,075
- Open all day and night.
- You'll call me a liar.

66
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,277
- A special meeting this Thursday.
- You'll think I ain't telling the truth.

67
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,214
Today I'm giving away solid gold watches
for one dollar each.

68
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,751
That's right, my friends.
A solid gold watch for one buck.

69
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,220
Remember, all that glitters
is not gold.

70
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,091
More to be desired are the judgments
of Heaven. Gold is not enough.

71
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,026
You say it's not enough?

72
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,930
Today only, I include a nail brush
with a solid ivory top.

73
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,923
Then, my friends, a built-in,
genuine magnetic compass.

74
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,905
How often, when you're brushing your
nails, do you wonder where you're going?

75
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,040
Which way is north,
east, south or west?

76
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,011
Which way are you going?
Down, down, down, or up to salvation?

77
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,114
Come to the mission and find out
absolutely free!

78
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,716
Absolutely free!
The nail brush is absolutely free!

79
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,687
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There's plenty of room for everybody.

80
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,680
There's room for everybody
in the kingdom of Heaven too.

81
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:25,687
Let's pack up.

82
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,891
Did you notice a lot of them stayed
till you were halfway through your talk?

83
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,772
If we could only sell them
salvation for a buck...

84
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,075
solid gold with an ivory top
and a built-in compass.

85
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:40,068
You don't suppose by any chance those
watches could really be solid gold?

86
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,848
Uncle Arvide, don't you dare!

87
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:46,841
That's right, my friends,
a solid gold watch for one buck!

88
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,717
Harry the Horse!

89
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,132
Benny Southstreet!

90
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,735
Since when do you yell out
a person's name...

91
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,770
in the open air
which is full of police?

92
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,139
It was a friendly impulse.
I lost my head.

93
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,209
If I do not like you so much,
this would now be a fact.

94
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,211
You know Nicely-Nicely Johnson,
of course.

95
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:16,204
- Of course. How goes everything?
- Nicely-nicely, thank you.

96
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,620
I have been waiting to hear
from Nathan Detroit.

97
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,888
What will be the location
of his crap game?

98
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,881
We don't know yet. Nathan's been
lookin' around, but he's hard to please.

99
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:31,086
The heat is on very hot around here,
and it is making Nathan sweat.

100
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,800
That's too bad, because I would dislike
to take my trade elsewhere...

101
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,737
but I am loaded
and lookin' for action.

102
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,373
I've just acquired 5,000 fish.

103
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,808
Five thousand?

104
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,779
If it can be told, where did you
take on this fine bundle of lettuce?

105
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,815
I have nothin' to hide.

106
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,808
I collected the reward
on my father.

107
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,329
It is an advantage
to have a successful father.

108
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,766
Nobody ever wanted my old man
for as much as 500.

109
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,069
I've worried about Nathan.
Harry the Horse is not the only one.

110
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:14,073
There's a lot of loose money around,
and everybody's lookin' for some action.

111
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:18,066
If Nathan doesn't find a place-

112
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,448
Why, Lieutenant Brannigan.

113
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,751
Mr. Southstreet,
it is Lieutenant Brannigan...

114
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,744
of the New York City
Police Department.

115
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,862
Have either of you seen
Nathan Detroit?

116
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,332
- Which Nathan Detroit is that?
- Your boss, Nathan Detroit!

117
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,135
The Nathan Detroit
who runs a floating crap game.

118
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,904
- Floating crap game?
- On a boat?

119
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,206
A crap game that moves
to a different spot every night...

120
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,975
so the police can't find it
and break it up.

121
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,378
Sounds like
a very difficult thing to do.

122
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,380
You should know,
since it's your job...

123
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,849
to rustle up the customers
and tell them where it is.

124
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,719
Especially with a famous detective
like you putting on the heat.

125
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,221
You can give just that message
to Detroit.

126
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,858
Tell him Brannigan says he's not gonna
find a spot for his crap game...

127
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,461
because everybody knows
Brannigan's put on the heat...

128
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,454
and Brannigan's breathing
down everybody's neck.

129
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,509
Nathan, you're lucky.
You just missed Brannigan.

130
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,511
I'm lucky.
I just missed Brannigan.

131
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,379
He left a message for you.
He said-

132
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,182
I am not going to find a place
for my crap game...

133
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,753
because everybody in town knows
that Brannigan has turned on the heat...

134
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,188
and that Brannigan is breathing
down everybody's neck.

135
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:40,181
That's what he said.

136
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,343
Have you tried
all the regular places?

137
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,545
Won't any of them take a chance,
seeing it's you?

138
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,313
Seeing it's me, no...

139
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,816
except one-
Joey Biltmore's garage.

140
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,119
Joey said he might take a chance
for 1,000 bucks.

141
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,156
- A thousand?
- In advance, and in cash.

142
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,358
He would not even take my marker.

143
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,961
This I do not believe-
that Joey will not take your marker.

144
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,064
You got no idea what a breath
this Brannigan has got.

145
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,801
After all, a marker's not just
a piece of paper saying...

146
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,370
"I owe you 1,000.
Signed, Nathan Detroit."

147
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,174
A marker is the one pledge
which a guy cannot welch on.

148
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,167
Never. It's like
not saluting the flag.

149
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,247
It does not seem possible-

150
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,184
me without a livelihood.

151
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:42,177
Why, I've been running the crap game
since I was a juvenile delinquent.

152
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,817
But the situation is desperate.
You have got to think of something.

153
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,430
My only thought
costs 1,000 bucks.

154
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,000
I cannot even afford to think.
I'm broke.

155
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,103
I'm so broke, I couldn't even buy
a present for Adelaide today.

156
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,472
Is it her birthday?

157
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,043
It is mine and Adelaide's
14th anniversary.

158
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,146
We are engaged 14 years today.

159
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,648
Nathan, you must concentrate
on a game.

160
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,952
The town is up to here with
high players. The Greek's in town.

161
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,553
- Brandy Bottle Bates.
- Scranton Slim.

162
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,356
I know, I know!
I could make a fortune...

163
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,349
but to make a fortune I need
a fortune- a thousand bucks!

164
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:26,254
Where do I get it?

165
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,036
<i>The Biltmore garage wants a grand</i>

166
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,440
<i>But we ain't got a grand on hand</i>

167
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,443
<i>And they now have</i>
<i>a lock on the door</i>

168
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,213
<i>To the gym at Public School 84</i>

169
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,250
<i>There's the stock room</i>
<i>behind McCloskey's Bar</i>

170
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,386
<i>But Mrs. McCloskey</i>
<i>ain't a good scout</i>

171
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,456
<i>And things being how they are</i>

172
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:54,026
<i>The back of</i>
<i>the police station is out</i>

173
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,396
<i>So the Biltmore garage</i>
<i>is the spot</i>

174
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,100
<i>But the 1,000 bucks</i>
<i>we ain't got</i>

175
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,570
<i>Why, it's good</i>
<i>old reliable Nathan</i>

176
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,440
<i>Nathan, Nathan, Nathan Detroit</i>

177
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,211
<i>If you're lookin' for action</i>
<i>he'll furnish the spot</i>

178
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,447
<i>Even when the heat is on</i>
<i>it's never too hot</i>

179
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:19,084
<i>Not for good old reliable Nathan</i>

180
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,922
<i>For it's always just a short walk</i>

181
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,090
<i>To the oldest established</i>

182
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,927
<i>Permanent floating crap game</i>

183
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,920
<i>In New York</i>

184
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,990
<i>There are well-heeled shooters</i>
<i>everywhere, everywhere</i>

185
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,040
<i>And an awful lot of lettuce</i>

186
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,575
<i>For the fella</i>
<i>who can get us there</i>

187
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,211
<i>If we only had</i>
<i>a lousy little grand</i>

188
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:50,204
<i>We could be a millionaire</i>

189
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:59,080
<i>If the size of your bundle</i>
<i>you want to increase</i>

190
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,294
<i>I'll arrange that you go broke</i>
<i>in quiet and peace</i>

191
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,564
<i>In a hideout provided by Nathan</i>

192
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:09,234
<i>Where there are</i>
<i>no neighbors to squawk</i>

193
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:13,238
<i>It's the oldest established</i>
<i>permanent, floating</i>

194
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,176
<i>Crap game in New York</i>

195
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,169
<i>Where's the action</i>
<i>Where's the game</i>

196
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:25,406
<i>Gotta have the game</i>
<i>or we'll die from shame</i>

197
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,668
Gentlemen, I am deeply touched
by your faith and loyalty.

198
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,781
Gentlemen, do not worry.

199
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,774
Nathan Detroit's crap game
will float again.

200
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,097
Guess who's sittin' in Mindy's
right now eatin' a steak breakfast.

201
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,833
- Hitler.
- Wrong! Sky Masterson.

202
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,702
Sky Masterson's in town.

203
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,105
This should be the greatest crap game
of your career.

204
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,041
Where's it gonna be?

205
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,511
City Hall, the Mayor's office.

206
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,504
- What time?
- We will leave you know, Angie.

207
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,120
Sky Masterson,
the highest player of'em all.

208
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,323
- What a spot I'm in.
- Does he bet higher than the Greek?

209
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,459
Why do you think
they call him Sky?

210
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,462
Once with my own eyes
I saw him bet 5,000 bucks...

211
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:47,455
that one raindrop would beat
another raindrop down the window.

212
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,573
Another time, he was sick
and would not take penicillin...

213
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,209
because he bet his fever
would go to 104.

214
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,379
- Always makes crazy bets like that.
- Did he win?

215
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,372
Him and his crazy bets.
He got lucky. It went to 106.

216
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,686
So? So why don't I bet him?

217
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:11,679
Why don't I bet him
1,000 bucks on something?

218
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,628
Max, what's the matter?
No Danish today?

219
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,465
It's a holiday in Denmark.
How do I know?

220
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,533
All these years
you've been bringing me Danish.

221
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,837
So we ain't got Danish today.
Today I'm bringing you cheesecake.

222
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,905
You want strudel instead,
I'll bring you strudel.

223
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:30,209
- I don't like strudel.
- So eat the cheesecake.

224
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,579
Live it up a little.

225
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,414
I do not understand you.

226
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,850
Everybody's crazy about Mindy's
cheesecake and strudel.

227
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,486
They must sell thousands
of portions every day.

228
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,122
That's just it.
Everybody's on cheesecake and strudel.

229
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,115
It makes me feel like
I'm playing the favorite.

230
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,429
Playing the favorite.

231
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,265
Nicely, Benny, I want you
to go into the kitchen...

232
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,702
and find out exactly how many pieces
of cheesecake they sold yesterday.

233
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,438
Also, how many pieces of strudel.

234
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,274
How much cheesecake?
How much strudel?

235
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,309
What do you want to know for?

236
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,302
I'm investigatin' for the FBI. Go!

237
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,798
Barrigan!
Stop breathin' down my neck!

238
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,468
- Why, Nathan!
- Adelaide! Doll!

239
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,337
Now, how could you think
I was Lieutenant Brannigan?

240
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,340
We don't even use
the same perfume.

241
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,210
I was kinda daydreamin', I guess.

242
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,203
I don't dream about detectives,
even in the daytime.

243
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,217
Do you know what I dream about?

244
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:49,210
You, and your career as a businessman
in a normal business.

245
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,581
And our career together
as a normal husband and wife.

246
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,362
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

247
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,364
Your cold's not getting any better.

248
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,357
It comes and goes, comes and goes.
It's just a chronic condition.

249
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,939
Even if it is, it sure hangs on.

250
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,932
Nathan, speaking
of chronic conditions...

251
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,571
happy anniversary.

252
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,419
Guess what's inside.

253
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,455
- A thousand bucks?
- I only wish it was.

254
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,448
Go on. Open it up.

255
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,467
"Mr. Nathan Detroit,
General Manager."

256
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,371
- General manager of what?
- Whatever you set your mind on.

257
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,374
I have faith.

258
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:46,367
Adelaide, I do not have
a present for you.

259
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,349
I don't mind if you
don't give me a present.

260
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,418
It makes me feel
like we were married.

261
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,389
Nathan, darling, there isn't anything
I couldn't do without...

262
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,382
just as long as you don't start
running that crap game again.

263
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,553
Crap game?
Adelaide, didn't I promise you?

264
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,734
- 1,200 cheesecake and 1,500 strudel.
- What?

265
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,803
Yesterday Mindy sold
1,200 cheesecake and 1,500 strudel.

266
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,673
More strudel than cheesecake.
Are you sure of this?

267
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,376
- Straight from the baker's mouth.
- What is this all about?

268
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,445
Statistics- things a businessman
has to have at his fingertips.

269
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,649
- Any news yet?
- Not yet. I will leave you know.

270
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,642
I'm gettin' impatient, Detroit.

271
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,812
- And what was that about?
- His wife's having a baby.

272
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,060
But why is he asking you?

273
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,053
He's nervous.
It's his first wife.

274
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,105
Look, I'm expecting a fellow
on an important business conference.

275
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,975
Suddenly I get a suspicion
you are trying to get rid of me.

276
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,778
No, doll. It's just that
this fellow does big business.

277
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,579
- Supermarket.
- Super, super.

278
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,916
With him business is business,
and dolls make him nervous.

279
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,918
Besides, you're late
for your rehearsal.

280
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,788
Nicely, you and Benny take Adelaide
to the Hot Box in a cab.

281
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,790
But it's only a couple of blocks.

282
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,593
The streets are covered with tourists,
and I do not want you molested.

283
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,586
Nathan, darling, you are the most
thoughtful man that ever lived.

284
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:18,426
- But who's gonna pay for the cab?
- I am, of course.

285
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,991
- Sky Masterson!
- Detroit!

286
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,060
Can I believe my eyes?
Is it really you?

287
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,863
- How goes your percentage of life?
- Not bad.

288
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,865
- And you?
- Healthy at the moment.

289
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,402
Sit for a minute. Relax. Talk.
Or maybe you're in a hurry.

290
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:54,005
My daddy always said there's only
one time a man should be in a hurry-

291
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,608
when the cops
are comin' up the stairs.

292
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,511
How about a cup of coffee?
Maybe a piece of cheesecake?

293
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,848
Thanks. I'm pleased to hear
things go well with you.

294
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,183
From communiquÃ©s
received in Las Vegas...

295
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,687
we understood that Lieutenant Brannigan
was corking up the town.

296
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,790
Who worries about Brannigan?

297
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,692
How was Vegas?

298
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,794
Paradise for two weeks.

299
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,997
For two weeks, I gambled in green
pastures, the dice were my cousins...

300
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,167
and the dolls were agreeable,
with nice teeth and no last names.

301
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,871
You are sure I cannot offer you
a piece of cheesecake or strudel?

302
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,107
No, thanks. I just ate.

303
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,109
How long are you in town?

304
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,780
Only for tonight.
Tomorrow I fly to Havana.

305
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,717
Sky, don't think I am a pest,
but do yourself a favor.

306
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,887
Eat this last little bite of cheesecake.
You will thank me.

307
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:45,223
Honestly, I couldn't swallow
a mouthful.

308
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,192
How is Adelaide?

309
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,194
Fine, fine.

310
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,531
I suppose one of these days
you'll be getting married.

311
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,867
- We all gotta go sometime.
- But we can fight it.

312
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,437
The companionship of a doll
is a pleasant thing...

313
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,206
even for a period of time
running into months...

314
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,709
but for a relationship that can last
through all the years of our life...

315
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,479
no doll can take the place
of aces back to back.

316
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:11,472
Still, you will admit that Mindy's
is the greatest cheesecake alive.

317
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,920
Gladly.

318
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,622
Furthermore, I am quite partial
to Mindy's cheesecake.

319
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,624
And yet, although
you might disagree...

320
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,494
many people prefer
Mindy's strudel to cheesecake.

321
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,262
Do you disagree?

322
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,265
It is my understanding that
the Constitution of the United States...

323
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:31,258
allows everybody the free choice
between cheesecake and strudel.

324
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,806
I would be interested to hear.

325
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,243
Offhand, would you say
that Mindy sells more cheesecake...

326
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,679
or more strudel?

327
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,114
Going strictly
by my own personal preference...

328
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,684
I'd say more cheesecake
than strudel.

329
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,853
For how much?

330
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:51,846
- What?
- For how much?

331
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,983
Why, Nathan, I never knew you
to lay money on the line.

332
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,030
You always take your bite
off the top.

333
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:03,023
A thousand bucks says that yesterday
Mindy sold more strudel than cheesecake.

334
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:07,272
- Let me tell you a story.
- Have we got a bet?

335
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,141
On the day I left home
to make my way in the world...

336
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,777
my daddy took me to one side.

337
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,213
"Son," my daddy says to me...

338
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,617
"I am sorry I'm not able to bankroll you
to a very large start...

339
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,887
but not having the necessary letters
to get you rolling...

340
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:25,790
instead I'm going to stake you
to some very valuable advice.

341
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,159
One of these days in your travels...

342
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,263
a guy is going to show you
a brand-new deck of cards...

343
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,832
on which the seal
is not yet broken.

344
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,835
Then this guy is going
to offer to bet you...

345
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,038
that he can make the jack of spades
jump out of this new deck of cards...

346
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,641
and squirt cider in your ear.

347
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,777
But, son,
you do not accept this bet...

348
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,913
because as sure
as you stand there...

349
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:51,683
you're going to wind up
with an ear full of cider."

350
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:55,676
Now, I do not suggest that you
have been clocking Mindy's cheesecake.

351
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,722
Would I do such a thing?

352
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,292
However, if you are
really looking for some action...

353
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:04,285
I will bet you the same 1,000 that you
cannot name the color tie you have on.

354
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:12,092
Have we got a bet?

355
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,941
No bet.

356
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,876
Polka dots!

357
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,845
In the whole world,
nobody but Nathan Detroit...

358
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,838
could blow 1,000 bucks
on polka dots!

359
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,688
- Hi, Sky.
- Nice to see you, Benny.

360
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,690
- How goes it, Sky?
- Healthy at the moment.

361
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,293
- With you, Nicely?
- Nicely-nicely, thanks.

362
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,830
What's the matter?
You look sick.

363
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,700
A temporary disorder.
The cheesecake backed up on him.

364
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,693
Maybe that's why they told us
they sell more strudel than cheesecake.

365
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,906
Adelaide gave us
a message for you.

366
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,676
Pick her up at the Hot Box
after the show, and don't be late.

367
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,712
Yes, dear. I mean, okay.

368
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:57,716
"Yes, dear"? This is husband talk
if I ever heard it.

369
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,218
You are trapped, because Adelaide is
the kind of a doll...

370
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,287
that is most difficult to unload.

371
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,023
I don't want to unload her.
I love her.

372
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:08,893
Well, if a guy does not have a doll,
who would holler on him?

373
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,795
A doll is a necessity.

374
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,164
I am not putting
the knock on dolls.

375
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:17,068
They are just something to have around
only when they come in handy.

376
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:20,805
The proof that I am right is that dolls
are available all over the place...

377
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,074
as far as the eye can see.

378
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,243
Not dolls like Adelaide.

379
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,245
Nothing personal,
and no offense...

380
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:31,082
but figuring weight for age
all dolls are the same.

381
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:35,075
- All dolls are the same, huh?
- As far as the eye can see.

382
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,156
Then it seems the one place
a doll would come in handy...

383
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,158
would be on a trip to Havana.

384
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,360
This being the case,
how come you ain't got one?

385
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,730
- How come you are going alone?
- A matter of choice.

386
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,000
I choose to travel alone, but if I
wish to take a doll to Havana...

387
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,336
the supply is more
than Woolworth has got beads.

388
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,438
- Not high-class dolls.
- There's only one class.

389
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,140
Indivisible and interchangeable.

390
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,209
A doll is a doll-
all dolls, any doll, you name her.

391
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,012
Any doll?
Will you bet on that?

392
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,148
Would you bet a thousand bucks
that if I name a doll...

393
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,850
you can take the same doll
to Havana with you tomorrow?

394
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,843
You've got yourself a bet.

395
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,699
I name her.

396
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,692
- Her?
- Sergeant Sarah Brown.

397
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:41,408
Daddy, I got cider in my ear.

398
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,491
It is my fault, you know.

399
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,494
It's not the mission.
It's me.

400
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:53,487
I can't do the job that has to be done.
I'm a failure.

401
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,826
I'd be doing the right thing
if I resigned and went back to Boston.

402
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:05,799
Sarah, should you be able to bend
a solid gold watch?

403
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,404
- Of course not.
- That's what I thought.

404
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,324
Why do you want to go home? Because
there aren't any sinners in Boston?

405
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,459
What have I accomplished here?

406
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,828
Surrounded by thousands
of depraved characters...

407
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,831
and after months of hard work,
an empty mission.

408
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,466
I'm ashamed of you.

409
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,836
Just because the riffraff of Broadway
didn't break down that door...

410
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,839
the minute they heard
you were in charge of this mission.

411
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,576
These aren't small-town delinquents
who drink too much on Saturday night.

412
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,546
You're up against the devil's
first-string troops...

413
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,539
a whole army of devil's disciples!

414
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,585
Do you take sinners here?

415
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,578
At any time of the day or night, son.
Come right in and sit down.

416
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:55,226
- Cup of coffee and a donut?
- Just coffee, thanks.

417
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,796
I am not here
because I am poor and hungry.

418
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,597
Not for food, that is.

419
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,867
"Blessed are they which do hunger
after righteousness." Is that it?

420
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,860
"Hunger and thirst after righteousness."
Yes, sir, that's it.

421
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,207
My name's Arvide Abernathy.

422
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,943
The young lady at the desk
is Sergeant Sarah Brown.

423
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,512
To you, we're Brother Arvide
and Sister Sarah.

424
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:17,315
- Sit down, son.
- How do you do?

425
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,417
Brother Sky.
Hello, Sister Sarah.

426
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,519
Is that your name? Sky?

427
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,288
Sky Masterson.

428
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,224
What is it that troubles you,
Mr. Masterson?

429
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,926
- Brother Sky.
- Brother Sky.

430
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,461
I gather you are not
in need of money.

431
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,064
I'm healthy at the moment.
It can change.

432
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,466
Are only the unhappy poor
welcome here?

433
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:39,037
What are you unhappy about, son?

434
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,438
Gambling.

435
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:44,431
Apparently, you're a successful gambler.

436
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,947
Is it wrong to gamble
or only to lose?

437
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,382
I better come back for help
when I'm broke.

438
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,117
Please don't misunderstand.

439
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:57,110
It's just so unusual for a successful
sinner to be unhappy about sin.

440
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,559
My unhappiness came up very suddenly.
Maybe it'll go away again.

441
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,196
We can keep you unhappy, son.
Give us a chance.

442
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,189
You don't look like a gambler at heart.
What made you take it up?

443
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,336
Evil companions.

444
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,639
Evil companions who are always
offering me sucker bets.

445
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,641
Just what is a sucker bet?

446
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,310
A bet that is reserved for suckers.

447
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,014
For a gambler to get sucked in
on such a bet is most humiliating.

448
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:27,018
But to lose it means you are marked
for a very long time as a chump.

449
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,454
So you must go all out
to win such a bet.

450
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,657
Is that so terrible,
to be marked as a chump?

451
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:36,327
Among my people, being a chump
is like losing your citizenship...

452
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,429
because a chump is an outsider...

453
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,165
a yokel who will buy
anything with varnish on it.

454
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:45,158
- Like a solid gold watch for a dollar?
- This is a real chump.

455
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:49,073
I think I'll get some rest
before we go out again.

456
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,175
Brother Sky,
I'm glad you found us.

457
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,544
Just stay and talk
to Sister Sarah.

458
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,281
Whatever your problems are,
she'll have the answers.

459
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,417
- I hope so.
- I know so.

460
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,954
If there's one thing
Sister Sarah never fails in...

461
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:06,947
it's solving
other people's problems.

462
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,665
What did he mean by that?

463
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:17,368
The way he said it- how you never fail
in solving other people's problems.

464
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,437
Haven't we changed places,
Mr. Masterson-

465
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,706
- Brother Sky.
- Brother Sky, aren't we-

466
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:25,043
Why do you have trouble
calling me Brother Sky?

467
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,578
Aren't we supposed
to be discussing your problems?

468
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,315
It just struck me that maybe
non-sinners also have problems.

469
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,318
If you are sincerely interested
in giving up gambling...

470
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,320
Mister- Brother Sky...

471
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,056
reading these pamphlets
will help you.

472
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:42,049
My daddy always said reading pamphlets
never made anybody give up anything.

473
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,762
Now, I had
a more personal help in mind.

474
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,365
We're having a midnight
prayer meeting on Thursday-

475
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,668
Thursday's the day after tomorrow.
Who's going to help me till then?

476
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,204
Well, our doors are always open.

477
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:57,008
Come in anytime.

478
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,644
You know what I think,
Sister Sarah?

479
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,514
You not only don't want to help me,
but for some reason you're against me.

480
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:07,385
I'm afraid that is true.
I don't trust you, Mr. Masterson.

481
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,521
- Brother Sky.
- Mr. Masterson.

482
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,790
You don't believe
I'm a sinner, do you?

483
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,783
I'm prepared to believe that you're
the biggest sinner I've ever met.

484
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:21,021
But you don't believe
I want to repent.

485
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,159
Is that it?

486
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,032
All of a sudden
you want a cup of coffee.

487
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,337
Did it ever occur to you some people
could be all repentance and no sin?

488
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,819
I may start a chain of missions
to help your kind.

489
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:45,812
Come, all ye repenters, and let us
bring a little sin into your life.

490
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,684
"There is no peace under the wicked.
Proverbs." This is wrong.

491
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,199
Let's say it's
a matter of opinion.

492
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,703
I made a statement of fact.
It's wrong.

493
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,772
How dare you!

494
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:04,442
Even if this is not a church,
it is a mission! How dare you blaspheme!

495
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,444
How dare you misquote the Bible!

496
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,579
"No peace under the wicked"
is not Proverbs. It's Isaiah.

497
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:12,316
- Of course it's Proverbs.
- Isaiah.

498
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:16,309
Chapter 57, verse 20 or 21.

499
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:21,415
Would you like to bet on it?
Not money. Just a nice sociable bet.

500
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:28,466
Isaiah?

501
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:32,136
There's only one thing that's been
in as many hotel rooms as I have-

502
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,604
the Gideon Bible.

503
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:37,408
Never tangle with me on the Good Book.
I must've read it a dozen times.

504
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,478
- If all that was no help to you-
- Who says it wasn't?

505
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,881
Once, in one of my blackest moments,
I came up with a three-horse parlay-

506
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,684
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

507
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,821
Mr. Masterson,
why did you come in here?

508
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,157
- I told you I'm an unhappy sinner.
- Excuse me, but you're a liar.

509
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,560
Excuse me, but lying's
not one of my sins.

510
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,197
I am not in the market
for a one-dollar solid gold watch.

511
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,633
All right. We'll lay it on the line.
From now on, we'll deal the hand open.

512
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,635
Could you say that in English?

513
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,772
I'm sure you've earned your stripes
courageously, combatting the devil-

514
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,707
There's no need to be sarcastic!

515
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:13,700
But not on this battlefield
against the devil's first-line troops...

516
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,380
because you can't get
at the enemy.

517
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,250
- This mission is laying an egg.
- You have no way of knowing.

518
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,252
I've got lots of ways of knowing.

519
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,122
You are stuck with a store
full of repentance and no customers.

520
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,824
Without sinners to repent,
what is repentance? It doesn't exist.

521
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,527
So you're stuck with
a store full of nothing.

522
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,130
- Now do I give you a fair rundown?
- I wouldn't know.

523
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,699
I've never had a rundown.

524
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,401
Would you be open to a proposition?

525
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,470
I've had those. No.

526
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,273
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm talking business.

527
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,275
I am in a position
to supply you...

528
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,545
with the raw material you need
for your work- namely, sinners.

529
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,714
- How?
- That's my work.

530
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:53,707
When is this big midnight meeting?
Thursday, day after tomorrow.

531
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:57,788
I guarantee to supply that meeting
with at least one dozen genuine sinners.

532
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,224
Whether they repent or not
is up to you.

533
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,227
Thank you very much.
That seems to be a fair rundown.

534
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,496
Now, if you will excuse me.

535
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,633
Just a minute, Sister Sarah.

536
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:12,626
This is not a charity contribution.
This is a business transaction.

537
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,672
Something you want
for something I want.

538
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,665
And what is that?

539
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,803
Have dinner with me tomorrow night.

540
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,254
Why should that be
something you want?

541
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:33,424
Well, maybe because I think
I'll be hungry tomorrow night.

542
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,493
- Keep this. It's my marker.
- Your what?

543
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:39,486
My marker, my IOU for at least one
dozen sinners delivered as described.

544
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,433
I will pick you up here
tomorrow at noon.

545
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,936
- At noon to go to dinner?
- It takes time to get there.

546
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,272
We're going to eat at my favorite
restaurant, El Cafe Cubano.

547
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,641
El Cafe Cubano?
Where's that?

548
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,344
- Havana.
- Havana, Cuba?

549
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:57,337
- What other Havanas are there?
- You want to take me to dinner in Cuba?

550
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,850
They eat in Cuba, same as we do.

551
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,287
What do you take me for,
Mr. Masterson? A chump?

552
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,623
- Isaiah's on the other side.
- You get out of here!

553
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:09,616
What are they worth to you?
One dozen sinners ready for salvation.

554
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,464
What are they worth to you?
A chicken salad in the tea room?

555
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,967
One last word, Sergeant.

556
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,270
I don't want you to walk out of this
room thinking the reason you're upset...

557
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,872
is because some blackhearted sinner
made improper advances-

558
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,874
It's none of your business
what I think.

559
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:27,411
To a virtuous young lady
with a shining white soul.

560
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,281
Any sinful thoughts that may be present
in this room at this time...

561
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,751
come out of you, doll, not me.

562
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,521
You're quite right. I'm nothing
but a repressed, neurotic girl.

563
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,657
I've read two books on the subject-

564
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,960
who is abnormally attracted to sin
and therefore abnormally afraid of it.

565
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,530
You're not the first man
to try that approach, Mr. Masterson.

566
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,534
I am happy to know I'm not the first man
who tried to approach in any way at all.

567
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,503
You're not even close.

568
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:55,973
I imagine by now you've succeeded
in blocking all possible approaches.

569
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:59,010
Except for a few that you
wouldn't know about, I'm afraid.

570
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,003
Well, of course, I only know the ones
on the outskirts of society.

571
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,916
What are the approaches like
on the inskirts?

572
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,953
All paved with
honorable intentions?

573
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,946
- I wonder what he'll be like?
- Who?

574
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,693
That upright, downright,
forthright square...

575
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,828
with his close-shaved chin up...

576
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:21,821
who right now somewhere is marching
along the proper approach to proper you.

577
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:26,760
- What'll he be like?
- He will not be a gambler for one thing.

578
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,042
I can name better than you can the
things he won't be, but what will he be?

579
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:35,035
- How will you know when he gets to you?
- Don't worry. I'll know.

580
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,973
<i>For I've imagined</i>
<i>every bit of him</i>

581
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,487
<i>From his strong moral fiber</i>

582
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,057
<i>To the wisdom in his head</i>

583
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,393
<i>To the homey aroma</i>

584
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,829
<i>Of his pipe</i>

585
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,399
<i>You have wished yourself</i>
<i>a small town Galahad</i>

586
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:58,703
<i>The breakfast-eating</i>
<i>four-button type</i>

587
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,572
<i>And I shall meet him</i>

588
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,975
<i>When the time is right</i>

589
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,412
<i>I'll know</i>

590
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:11,882
<i>When my love comes along</i>

591
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,151
<i>I won't</i>

592
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,388
<i>Take a chance</i>

593
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,591
<i>For, oh</i>

594
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,428
<i>He'll be just what I need</i>

595
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:28,421
<i>Not some fly-by-night</i>
<i>Broadway romance</i>

596
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,102
<i>And you'll know at a glance</i>

597
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,671
<i>By the two pair of pants</i>

598
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,807
<i>I'll know</i>

599
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:40,111
<i>By his calm, steady voice</i>

600
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:44,104
<i>Those feet on the ground</i>

601
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,853
<i>I'll know</i>

602
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:52,846
<i>As I run to his arms</i>

603
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,792
<i>That at last</i>

604
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,927
<i>I've come home</i>

605
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,798
<i>Safe and sound</i>

606
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,033
<i>And till then</i>

607
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,436
<i>I shall wait</i>

608
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,838
<i>And till then</i>

609
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,831
<i>I'll be strong</i>

610
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,070
<i>For I'll know</i>

611
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,574
<i>When my love</i>

612
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:26,146
<i>Comes along</i>

613
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,059
<i>Mine will come</i>

614
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,763
<i>As a surprise to me</i>

615
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,534
<i>Mine, I'll leave to chance</i>

616
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,803
<i>And chemistry</i>

617
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:42,540
- Chemistry?
- Yeah, chemistry.

618
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,975
<i>Suddenly I'll</i>

619
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,044
<i>Know</i>

620
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:50,548
<i>When my love comes along</i>

621
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:54,541
<i>I'll know then and there</i>

622
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,755
<i>I'll know</i>

623
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:01,125
<i>At the sight of her face</i>

624
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:05,118
<i>How I care, how I care</i>

625
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,266
<i>And I'll stop</i>

626
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,203
<i>And I'll stare</i>

627
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:16,207
<i>And I'll know</i>

628
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,009
<i>Long before we can speak</i>

629
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,579
<i>I'll know</i>

630
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,582
<i>In my heart</i>

631
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,051
<i>I'll know</i>

632
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,987
<i>And I won't ever ask</i>

633
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,256
<i>Am I right</i>
<i>Am I wise</i>

634
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,558
<i>Am I smart</i>

635
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,861
<i>But I'll stop</i>

636
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,029
<i>And I'll stare</i>

637
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,132
<i>At that face</i>

638
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:46,125
<i>In the throng</i>

639
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,866
<i>Yes, I'll know</i>

640
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:56,981
<i>When my love</i>

641
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,550
<i>Comes</i>

642
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:03,543
<i>Along</i>

643
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,194
Mm-hmm.

644
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:48,098
Well, that makes it necessary
for me to drop back again.

645
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,701
Matthew 5:39.

646
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:54,694
Don't bother looking it up.
It's the bit about the other cheek.

647
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,371
I know, Joey.

648
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,974
But the thousand bucks
is guaranteed.

649
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,043
What? It's a bet I cannot lose.

650
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:37,036
I bet Sky Masterson he could not take
a certain doll to Havana with him.

651
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:42,108
Not this doll.
Not this doll!

652
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,690
And now for the grand finale
of our "Round the World" revue...

653
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,993
the Hot Box takes you
out to the alley...

654
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,986
with Miss Adelaide
and her Alley Kittens.

655
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:32,425
<i>Hello!</i>

656
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,913
<i>One meow, two meow,</i>
<i>three meow, scat.</i>

657
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,048
<i>What's the initial</i>
<i>of my pet tomcat?</i>

658
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,284
<i>Is it A, B, C, D, E, F, G?</i>

659
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,886
<i>Is it H or J or L, M, N, O, P?</i>

660
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,255
<i>Is it L, M, N, O, P,</i>
<i>Q, R, S, T?</i>

661
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:29,248
<i>No, it's you!</i>
<i>You're the cat for me!</i>

662
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:04,094
<i>You know you've been mean to me</i>

663
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:08,098
<i>And you know</i>
<i>when you're mean to me</i>

664
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,535
<i>How it always makes me want to</i>

665
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,271
<i>Roam</i>

666
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,341
<i>And you know there's a danger</i>

667
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:21,334
<i>That some gentle stranger</i>

668
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,382
<i>Might pick me up</i>

669
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,851
<i>And make me feel</i>

670
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,988
<i>At home</i>

671
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:34,981
<i>So pet me, Papa</i>
<i>Papa, pet me nice</i>

672
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,429
<i>Pet me, Papa</i>
<i>Papa, melt the ice</i>

673
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,298
<i>And you know how</i>

674
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,168
<i>If you don't want me</i>
<i>out roaming the city</i>

675
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,570
<i>Talk to me pretty</i>
<i>Here, kitty, kitty</i>

676
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,563
<i>And pet me, Papa</i>
<i>Papa, pet me nice</i>

677
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,103
<i>Papa, pet me good</i>

678
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,950
<i>Pet me, Papa, proper</i>
<i>like you should</i>

679
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,585
<i>And you know how</i>

680
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:04,521
<i>If you care to keep me home</i>
<i>by the fire</i>

681
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,957
<i>Especially when</i>
<i>it's time to retire</i>

682
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:10,950
<i>Then pet me, Papa</i>
<i>Papa, pet me good</i>

683
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,964
<i>Warm up my saucer of milk</i>

684
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,333
<i>And maybe I'll purr</i>

685
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,836
<i>Lay out my cushion of silk</i>

686
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,472
<i>Don't rumple my fur</i>

687
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,242
<i>Just reach over</i>
<i>and pet me, Papa</i>

688
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,478
- <i>Papa, melt the ice</i>
- <i>Tasty as a mouse</i>

689
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,348
<i>If you don't want me</i>
<i>out roaming the city</i>

690
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,917
<i>Talk to me pretty</i>
<i>Here, kitty, kitty</i>

691
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:37,910
<i>Pet me, Papa</i>
<i>That's my good advice</i>

692
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:44,984
<i>Yeah, pet me, Papa</i>

693
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,567
<i>That'll get me</i>
<i>Pet me, Papa</i>

694
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:54,560
<i>Papa, pet me nice</i>

695
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,944
Look, Joey, I gotta hang up.

696
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:04,937
Can I at least tell the guys that the
game will be at your garage tomorrow?

697
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:09,508
I would gladly pay you in advance, but
I won't get the money until tomorrow.

698
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,313
I've got to have time
to spread the word around.

699
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,526
Joey, listen to me.

700
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:20,063
Yes, Joey.

701
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:24,056
Drop dead, Joey.

702
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,974
Nathan, darling!

703
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:34,177
You got here early.

704
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,914
It's so thrilling
to find you waiting for me...

705
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,918
just like we were married
and I was coming home from work.

706
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,921
You wouldn't make me
stop working, would you?

707
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,589
That would be cruel.

708
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:49,092
A doll like you could earn good money
for another ten years easy.

709
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,095
Sweet. And you
were reading my book too.

710
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,933
See? I told you reading
don't make people go blind.

711
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,969
It's very interesting, isn't it?

712
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,438
What is? Oh, the book. Yeah.

713
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,507
The doctor gave it to me.

714
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:06,543
He said he thought it might help me
get rid of my cold.

715
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,111
With a book?

716
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:12,104
The doctor thinks my cold might
possibly be caused by psychology.

717
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,620
How does he know
you got psychology?

718
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,623
Nathan, everybody has got it.

719
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,392
And female psychology
explains why...

720
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:26,029
certain girls do
certain kinds of things.

721
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:30,022
It's all in the book.

722
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:34,060
Must be some book.

723
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:38,475
Would it, for instance,
tell you what kind of a doll...

724
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,468
would go for a certain kind of guy
which you wouldn't think would do so?

725
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:47,050
No matter how terrible
a fella seems...

726
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,087
you can never be sure
that some girl won't go for him.

727
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:53,023
Take us.

728
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:57,016
Get dressed.
We'll go eat.

729
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,731
Starting with next week...

730
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,600
I will be getting
a raise in salary.

731
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,036
Where does it say
what different kinds of dolls will do?

732
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:10,029
You're not even listening to me!

733
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:14,344
I will be making enough
so that we can finally get married.

734
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,514
What do you think?

735
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,250
Of course we'll get married
sooner or later.

736
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,054
After 14 years, it is already
too late to be sooner.

737
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:28,047
If it gets much later, sooner
will be too late even to be later.

738
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:34,387
Besides, I don't know
what to do anymore about Mother.

739
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,633
Mother?
What about your mother?

740
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:40,070
Well, this is something
that I haven't told you before...

741
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,373
but my mother
back in Rhode Island...

742
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:47,366
well, she thinks
that we are already married.

743
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,080
How could she think such a thing?

744
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,073
Maybe because I wrote her
that we were already married.

745
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,620
That would make her think so.

746
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,613
In Rhode Island, people do not
remain engaged for 14 years.

747
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,626
They get married!

748
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,495
So how come
it's such a small state?

749
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,799
Furthermore,
after about two years-

750
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,334
After about two years, we-

751
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,737
We got a divorce?

752
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,106
We had a baby.

753
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:19,443
- You wrote your mother we had a baby?
- I had to.

754
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:23,436
Mother kept after me, and finally
I just ran out of excuses.

755
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,750
And what type baby was it?

756
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,752
It was a boy.

757
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,754
I named it after you, Nathan.

758
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,856
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

759
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:36,849
Tell me, what has Nathan, Jr.
Been doing all these years?

760
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,363
Well, right now
he's in boarding school.

761
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,632
As a matter of fact,
I wrote Mother...

762
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:46,269
that he won the football game
last Saturday.

763
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,605
I wish I had a bet on it.

764
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,242
But, Nathan, I-

765
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,479
That isn't all.

766
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,582
You're not going to tell me
we also have got an Adelaide, Jr?

767
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,584
All these years, Nathan!

768
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,853
Mother believes
in big families...

769
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,789
and we had such an early start.

770
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,782
Just give me the grand total.

771
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:14,831
Five.

772
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:18,824
How could you do such a thing
to a nice, old broad like your mother?

773
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,338
Nathan, darling...

774
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:25,331
let's just us get married,
and I'll handle everything else.

775
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,845
Okay, doll, when we're ready.

776
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,847
Nathan, we are ready now.

777
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,483
We have been ready for 14 years.

778
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:37,420
All we need now is a license
and a blood test.

779
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,413
- Blood test?
- Don't worry. You've got blood.

780
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:43,560
What a city.

781
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,930
First I close my crap game,
and then they open my veins.

782
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,599
Nathan, you gave up the crap game.

783
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,501
Of course I did, doll.

784
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,494
And you know why? For you.
Because I love you.

785
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,608
Can I borrow some earrings?

786
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:01,311
It is customary, Laverne,
to knock...

787
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,304
when entering the private dressing room
of an engaged person.

788
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:09,642
As far as I'm concerned,
you are in here by yourself.

789
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,756
May I borrow some earrings?

790
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,691
- Diamonds or pearls?
- Diamonds.

791
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:18,684
In the top drawer of the trunk.
The big box.

792
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:29,406
Aren't they a little long, dear?
Remember, you've got a short neck.

793
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,474
He's a tall man.

794
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:35,345
You! I'm all dated up
with Society Max tomorrow night...

795
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:39,338
and he breaks it on account
of your silly crap game!

796
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,866
Adelaide, look at me.
I'm on my knees.

797
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:00,859
Oh, get up!
It reminds me of your crap game.

798
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,607
Adelaide, doll!

799
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:06,743
You're getting yourself upset
about nothin'.

800
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,680
It's a game I set up a long time ago.
I couldn't get out of it.

801
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,750
Understand?

802
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,620
Look, we love each other.
We're gonna get married.

803
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,755
We'll be happy.

804
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,748
Get out of my life,
Nathan Detroit!

805
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:35,060
I knew you'd understand.

806
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,866
It says here:

807

<i>Where the trouble is</i>

844
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,216

<i>With the wheezes</i>

<i>And a sinus</i>
<i>that's really a pip</i>

865
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:02,245
<i>From a lack of community property</i>

866
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,715
<i>And a feeling</i>

867
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:07,650
<i>A person</i>

<i>Cold</i>

870
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:42,307
<i>Follow the fold</i>

871
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,712
<i>Stray no more</i>

872
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:50,849

874
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,181
Nathan, if you had arrived
one minute earlier...

875
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:16,119
you would have witnessed Miss Sarah
give Sky Masterson a 100% brush-off.

876
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:19,055
So the thousand for Joey Biltmore
is practically in your pocket.

877
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,292
- You should be jumping for joy.
- I'm jumping.

878
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,028
You got work to do,
arrangements to make.

879
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,363
A shave and a hot towel
will fix you up.

880
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:30,867
For who should I have a shave?
For who should I have a hot towel?

881
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:34,370
Do you know what is at stake here?
Nathan Detroit's crap game.

882
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,172
Because of a doll.

883
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,108
I cannot believe that
a number-one businessman like you...

884
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:42,078
could let himself go and fall in love
with his own fiancÃ©e.

885
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:45,081
All right!
So Adelaide is my weakness.

886
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,750
Can you not be tolerant
that I have got a weakness?

887
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,743
Especially since this weakness is a sad
condition that guys are in everywhere?

888
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:55,825

<i>Call it funny</i>

911
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,100
<i>But it's better than even money</i>

912
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:15,093
<i>That the guy's only doin' it</i>
<i>for some doll</i>

913
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:34,479
<i>When you see a Joe</i>
<i>savin' half of his dough</i>

914
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:39,017
<i>You can bet there'll be mink in it</i>
<i>for some doll</i>

915
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:43,355
<i>When a bum buys wine</i>
<i>like a bum can't afford</i>

916
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,269
<i>It's a cinch that the bum</i>
<i>is under the thumb</i>

917
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,271
<i>Of some little broad</i>

918
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:52,264
<i>When you meet a mug</i>
<i>lately out of the jug</i>

919
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:56,468
<i>And he's still lifting</i>
<i>platinum folderol</i>

920
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,248
<i>Call it hell</i>
<i>Call it heaven</i>

921
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,284
<i>It's a probable 12 to 7

922
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:05,277
<i>That the guy's only doin' it</i>
<i>for some doll</i>

923
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:27,466
<i>When you see a sport</i>
<i>and his cash has run short</i>

924
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:31,970
<i>You can bet he's been blowin' it</i>
<i>on some doll</i>

925
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:36,374
<i>When a guy wears tails</i>
<i>with the front gleaming white</i>

926
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,322
<i>Who the heck do you think</i>
<i>he's tickling pink</i>

927
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,324
<i>On Saturday night</i>

928
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:45,317
<i>When some lazy slob</i>
<i>gets a good, steady job</i>

929
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,755
<i>And he smells</i>
<i>from Vitalis and Barbasol</i>

930
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,535
<i>Call it dumb</i>
<i>Call it clever</i>

931
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:54,570
<i>Ah, but you can give odds forever</i>

932
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,874
<i>That the guy's only doin' it</i>
<i>for some doll</i>

933
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,575
<i>Some doll, some doll</i>

934
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:03,568
<i>That guy's only doin' it</i>
<i>for some doll</i>

935
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:12,410
Well, I think we finally managed
to shake off the Prince of Darkness.

936
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,291
You certainly did your best
to discourage him.

937
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:19,284
I certainly did.

938
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:22,265
Arvide.

939
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:24,967
General Cartwright,
what a pleasant surprise.

940
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,904
- We didn't even know you were in town.
- A flying visit.

941
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:31,541
Flew in from Boston early this morning.
Important luncheon meeting.

942
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:35,534
While waiting, thought I'd check
a few of our outposts informally.

943
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:38,848
I must say, Sarah, I was surprised
to find the mission unattended...

944
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,850
in a neighborhood
as unsavory as this.

945
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,553
Why should you be surprised, General?
You've seen our records.

946
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:47,223
We don't seem to get anyone in here,
even to rob the place.

947
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,492
Yes.

948
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,495
Well, now that you've
brought it up...

949
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,131
I must confess
I have come for a purpose.

950
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,399
An unhappy one.

951
01:03:56,399 --> 01:04:00,002
I know it doesn't look as if we're
accomplishing anything, but in time-

952
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:03,906
Time, I'm afraid,
is what we can no longer afford.

953
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,942
My good friends...

954
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,611
after careful deliberation,
National Headquarters has decided...

955
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,080
to close this branch of the mission.

956
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,950
- Close the mission?
- Oh, no, General, please.

957
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,620
Even if I haven't made a success of it,
there must be someone who will.

958
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:21,624
Sarah Brown, if you can't
attract sinners, nobody can.

959
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,593
There are so many calls on us...

960
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:27,586
so many other places
where our work is needed.

961
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,366
How do you do?

962
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:33,035
I don't believe we've met,
Brother-

963
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,371
Brother Sky Masterson,
former sinner.

964
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:39,308
I am General Cartwright,
Regional Director of Save-A-Soul.

965
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:43,112
- Why isn't his name on the report?
- What were you doing in there?

966
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:45,681
I was resting, Sister Sarah.

967
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:49,318
I was going to ask Brother Arvide
if he might let me carry the drum...

968
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,687
when we go out again
this afternoon.

969
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,923
On behalf of the former sinners
of the future...

970
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,025
I protest the closing
of this mission.

971
01:04:56,025 --> 01:05:00,018
- I think I should explain to you-
- This man has a right to be heard.

972
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:05,123
Continue, Brother Sky.

973
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:09,272
General, would you be open
to a proposition?

974
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,074
The general is flying back
to Boston this afternoon.

975
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,477
She will not be available
for dinner tonight.

976
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:18,447
Sarah, what are you talking about?

977
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,951
- What have you got in mind, young man?
- Faith in Sister Sarah.

978
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:25,221
I ask you to give her 36 hours
to show you that she...

979
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,223
can make this mission pay off.

980
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:30,927
Saving souls should not
be referred to as "paying off."

981
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,695
Why 36 hours?

982
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:36,198
Because he knows that our big meeting
36 hours from now...

983
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:39,335
- will be a great success.
- Uncle Arvide!

984
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:43,328
How can you guarantee that,
Brother Sky?

985
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,310
Well, let's just say
I have a feeling about it.

986
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,012
"If sinners entice thee,
consent thou not."

987
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:54,005
That's the wrong thought.
Where is yesterday's Thought for Today?

988
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:58,076
Top right-hand drawer.

989
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,389
Excuse me, General.

990
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,558
Before going to the expense
of a big meeting...

991
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:06,551
I should think it'd require more than
just a feeling that it'll be successful.

992
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:10,722
Oh, it's a very strong feeling,
General.

993
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,737
"There is no peace to the wicked."
Isaiah 57:21.

994
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,272
That is correct.

995
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:18,574
General,
my proposition is this:

996
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:21,310
Why don't you come to the midnight
meeting tomorrow night...

997
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,446
and find out for yourself?

998
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:27,283
Well, if I thought there was a chance
of finding definite progress...

999
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:31,276
any sizable turnout.

1000
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,698
What do you think, Sister Sarah?

1001
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,568
Don't you honestly believe
that this mission could be saved...

1002
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:49,561
within the next 36 hours?

1003
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,313
General Cartwright...

1004
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,516
I'm in a position
to guarantee you personally...

1005
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,452
at least one dozen
genuine sinners.

1006
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:04,687
Hallelujah!

1007
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,680
Hallelujah.

1008
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:15,020
Be sure you're wearing
your carnation.

1009
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:22,038
Remember, nobody gets
in a crap game...

1010
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,106
without they got a red carnation.

1011
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,275
It's like a password.
Nathan's orders.

1012
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,277
We got the flowers.
Where is the action?

1013
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:32,270
The minute Nathan arrives,
we're gonna-

1014
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,317
He has arrived.
Is it all set?

1015
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:38,721
Can I tell the customers
it's Joey Biltmore's-

1016
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:42,491
Not till I put the thousand in Joey's
hands, and I haven't got it yet.

1017
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:44,827
I sent Nicely to wait
for Sky at his hotel.

1018
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:47,563
The minute Sky gives him the money,
Nicely's gonna bring it to me.

1019
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,399
But they won't stick around much longer.
They're gettin' nervous.

1020
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:54,070
I'm not nervous?

1021
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,839
Well, Harry the Horse.
How is everything in Brooklyn? The same?

1022
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:59,842
I hope, Detroit, you will not
spoil our evening...

1023
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:03,345
inasmuch as I happen to be entertaining
a very prominent guest tonight.

1024
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:07,338
I would like you to meet
Big Jule from Chicago.

1025
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:11,576
I would like you to meet
Big Jule from Chicago.

1026
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,657
Big Jule,
welcome to our fair city...

1027
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,859
in which, as you know,
the heat is on.

1028
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:20,852
However, if you will be patient,
you will be provided with action.

1029
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:30,673
What do you say? Should we
stick around, or should we blow?

1030
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:33,375
I come here to shoot crap.
Let's shoot crap.

1031
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:37,368
Order another milkshake
and relax.

1032
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:43,274
Do not let the fact that Big Jule
drinks milk give you any wrong ideas.

1033
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,888
Big Jule does not like
to be displeased.

1034
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:49,758
Why, Harry, did I give the impression
that I was being rude to a guest...

1035
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:53,751
who has such a well-deserved
reputation as Big Jule?

1036
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:59,235
I'm sure that you did not
misunderstand my kidding remarks.

1037
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,470
It's just that one look
at your kindly face...

1038
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,839
which is so full of fun...

1039
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,842
good fellowship-

1040
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,245
Could I have a swallow
of your milk?

1041
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:13,238
Well, well, well.

1042
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:17,375
What have we here?

1043
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,789
The jails must be empty tonight.

1044
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:23,559
Can anybody be missing?

1045
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,728
Harry the Horse...

1046
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,531
Liver Lips Louie...

1047
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:32,524
Angie the Ox, Society Max.

1048
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:37,195
And here is a face for which
I cannot supply a name.

1049
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,942
May I ask where you come from?

1050
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,944
East Cicero, Illinois.

1051
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:45,937
And what is
your occupation there?

1052
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:50,686
I'm a scout master.

1053
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:54,679
Don't ever help my mother
across the street.

1054
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,883
Such lovely red carnations.

1055
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,697
Is it a funeral?

1056
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:05,301
Did somebody die suddenly
that I don't know about...

1057
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:09,294
yet?

1058
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:20,238
What's on, Nathan? What brings
all these senior delinquents together?

1059
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:22,651
They got lonely.
How do I know?

1060
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:24,954
And why are they all
wearing red carnations?

1061
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:26,956
They are also all wearing pants.

1062
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:29,258
You are up to no good, Detroit!

1063
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:33,251
Is it now a crime to wear flowers?
Is Mindy's a hideout for gangsters?

1064
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,965
Lieutenant, I'll confess.

1065
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:39,958
We're smuggling hot cheesecake
into Canada.

1066
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:47,999
This is all I need.
It's complete.

1067
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,046
Everybody in the whole world
who hates me...

1068
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:55,039
is now here.

1069
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:07,263
What's the use, Nathan?
Why try to keep it a secret?

1070
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,531
- Bite your tongue, Benny!
- All right, Southstreet.

1071
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,835
- Let's have it. What's this all about?
- It's a party.

1072
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,837
- What kind of a party?
- A dinner.

1073
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:18,830
A bachelor dinner for Nathan Detroit.
He's gettin' married.

1074
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:23,067
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1075
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:29,874
<i>Which nobody cannot deny</i>

1076
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:34,290
Oh, Nathan, darling.
I'm so thrilled.

1077
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,960
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It was gonna be a surprise wedding.

1078
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,562
You certainly had me fooled,
Detroit.

1079
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,698
When is the happy occasion?

1080
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:46,502
It's gonna take a little time
to get the blood tests, the license.

1081
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:50,072
Gee, wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could get married tomorrow night?

1082
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:53,042
I mean, right after the opening
of the new show at the Hot Box.

1083
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:57,035
According to the laws under which
we live, it's gonna take a little time.

1084
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,748
You could elope.

1085
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:01,984
You are telling me
to violate the law?

1086
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,119
It's legal to elope at your age.

1087
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,956
And the great state of Maryland will
marry you right away, no blood test.

1088
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,958
Ain't that unhealthy?

1089
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:13,951
The lieutenant has come up with a
romantic suggestion of which I approve.

1090
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:18,022
Elope, and for the trip,
I will loan you my getaway car...

1091
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:21,870
that is, my station wagon.

1092
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,039
Oh, Nathan, darling.

1093
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:28,032
Let's do it. Please?
