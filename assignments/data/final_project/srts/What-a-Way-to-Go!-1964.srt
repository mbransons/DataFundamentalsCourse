306
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,959
Get out of here before
I twist your head off like a turnip.

307
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,873
Well, is this the voice
of passive resistance speaking?

308
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,393
No. Just get out of here.

309
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,039
[SCREAMING]

310
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,229
Oh, Louisa. You all right?

311
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,675
LENNY: Well, another innovation
for modern living, huh?

312
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,956
Instant shower for milady.

313
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,839
- There. Well...
- I'm afraid I'm not a bit handy, Edgar.

314
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,319
LENNY:
Oh, no, but you are handy.

315
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,755
I could use you down at the store
doing odd jobs.

316
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,717
I'd pay you. You could earn a living.

317
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,156
My wife doesn't have to work.
I'm sorry.

318
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,916
Ed, seriously, Ed,
why don't you come down...

319
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,311
...and see me this afternoon,
sell me that piece of property of yours?

320
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,916
Someone could do something with it.
Not you, of course, but someone.

321
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,718
- I said, get out of here.
- LENNY: All right.

322
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,791
- Get out of here.
- All right, I will.

323
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,351
Sorry to have barged in on you kids,
but I'll send a Christmas basket.

324
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,634
- What's the matter, darling?
- Oh, nothing.

325
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,958
I think I'll go down to the store
for a while this afternoon.

326
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,395
But you were there
just 10 days ago.

327
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,998
Well, it's got that chicken wire
I want and some nails.

328
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,673
You know...

329
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,155
...it's the end of summer.
People are coming home.

330
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,038
Somebody might want something.

331
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,795
Well, I'll be back.

332
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,034
LOUISA:
<i>But he never really did come back</i>.

333
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,270
<i>Not the Edgar Hopper I knew</i>.

334
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,592
<i>When he hadn't returned</i>
<i>by the next day, I hurried into town</i>.

335
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,797
EDGAR: Hop to Hopper's! The lowest
prices in town. Unlimited credit.

336
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,594
This is the biggest sale
in the history of our county.

337
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,320
Don't crawl to Crawley's, folks.
Hop, hop to Hopper's.

338
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,552
I guarantee you 10 percent off
because there's no air conditioning.

339
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,472
This is it.
Right here on Main Street.

340
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,154
Hop, hop to Hopper's.
We undersell everybody.

341
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,232
Come right in, folks. Instant credit.
If we haven't got it...

342
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,834
...we'll get it for you.
Don't crawl to Crawley's.

343
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,634
Hop, hop to Hopper's.
So all you shoppers...

344
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,597
Louisa.

345
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,080
- What is all this?
- Hopper's Taj Mahal, honey.

346
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,708
And it's all for you.
Listen, Louisa, when that...

347
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,394
...snake rattled into our house,
something snapped.

348
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,756
Where have you been?
Why didn't you come home?

349
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,151
There you were, mending the roof.
My wife.

350
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,278
Hop, hop, hop, you shoppers.
Hop to Hopper's.

351
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,998
Honey, I wanna get you things.

352
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,799
Dresses and things for the house.
A house.

353
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,639
- But I like our house.
- What is it that makes a family...

354
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,156
...go to the same store over and over
and no place else?

355
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,876
I don't know. Free eats.
Free toys for the kiddies?

356
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,715
That's it. We'll stuff them
and then we'll sell them.

357
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,190
Hop, hop, hop, you shoppers.
Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's.

358
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,157
Come on, honey.
Let me show you around.

359
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,552
Hey, you kids.
Get up on top there.

360
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,631
Keep with the,
"Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's".

361
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,279
- This is wonderful.
- Oh, thanks.

362
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,839
- Terrific.
- Thanks for coming.

363
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,513
There's a lot more bargains here.

364
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,319
MAN 1: We'll be back, Eddie.
MAN 2: Some bargains, Eddie.

365
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,879
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

366
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,709
Prices are low, the goods are right,
come to Hopper's from morn till night.

367
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,677
We're open till 10:00 every night.

368
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,068
- How's it going?
- MAN 3: Oh, great.

369
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,435
- Good to hear it. Those are on sale.
- Edgar.

370
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,556
When will we ever see each other?

371
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,429
As soon as this thing gets going,
we'll have more time together than ever.

372
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,670
But we had all our time
together before.

373
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,751
- What about Thoreau?
- Thoreau?

374
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,115
But you don't want to keep pace
like the others.

375
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,952
You heard a different drummer.

376
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,912
Oh, yeah.
I hear a different drummer.

377
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,710
And the music I hear says,
"Hop, hop, Eddie. Hop, hop".

378
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,674
Well, looks like we've got him
at last, Driscoll.

379
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,229
Have we?
The people seem to be eating it up.

380
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,351
LENNY:
Anybody will run to look at a freak.

381
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,639
I figure I'll give him three months, and
he'll hop himself right into oblivion.

382
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,314
BO Y:
Hop, hop, hop to Hoppers!

383
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,038
Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's!

384
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,714
Hop, hop, hop to Hopper's. Hop...

385
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,551
Forgive me, sir.
But we really must advertise.

386
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,593
We must, huh? You're fired.

387
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,948
HOPPER: Merry Christmas.
And a hop, hop, hoppy New Year.

388
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,591
Merry Christmas.
And a hop, hop, hoppy New Year.

389
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,874
MRS. FREEMAN: I bought a lot.
HOPPER: You bought out the store.

390
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,429
And it's no trouble at all,
Mrs. Freeman. No trouble.

391
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,352
You can't leave, we leave with you.

392
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,274
Hey, Ned, you drop Mrs. Freeman off
on her way home, okay?

393
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,076
Oh, thank you, Edgar.
And merry Christmas.

394
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,753
- LOUISA: Edgar.
- Be right with you, lady.

395
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,151
- Merry Christmas to you, Mrs. Freeman.
- Edgar.

396
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,675
Oh, hi, honey. Excuse me,
I gotta get back.

397
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,149
But, Edgar,
aren't you coming home soon?

398
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,595
I'm sorry, we're staying open
till midnight.

399
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,239
What's the matter?

400
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,119
Nothing. I'm just a little lonely,
that's all.

401
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,396
What? In that big, beautiful new house?
Lonely?

402
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,679
I'm the only one who's ever in it.

403
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,115
Edgar, it's Christmas.

404
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,834
But, yes, and Christmas is business.
Big business.

405
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,875
You're working entirely too hard,
darling.

406
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,635
By this time next year, we'll be so rich
we can take a real vacation.

407
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,438
- Italy?
- Italy.

408
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,874
MAN:
Merry Christmas.

409
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,759
What's the matter with work?
Hard work never killed anybody.

410
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,592
- MAN: Merry Christmas.
- Hi there.

411
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,069
MAN:
And a hop, hop, hoppy New Year.

412
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,316
LOUISA: <i>Edgar's hard work</i>
<i>included hitting out</i>...

413
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,318
...<i>with every modern sales device</i>
<i>known to man</i>.

414
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,550
<i>And Crawleyville</i>
<i>was his captive audience</i>.

415
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,239
<i>We were millionaires overnight</i>.

416
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,995
Darling, I've checked
the hotels in Rome...

417
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,390
...and I have the reservations
for our vacation.

418
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,915
I'm sorry, that'll have to wait
till next year.

419
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,036
- Next year?
- Yes, next year.

420
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,113
In the meantime, get a couple
of art books and a box of spaghetti.

421
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,075
You liar. You cheat!

422
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,549
- You deceived me.
- Deceived you?

423
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,234
You think I've got a blond tootsie
on the side?

424
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,152
Oh, I just wish you had!

425
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,471
At least then
I'd know you were relaxing!

426
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,557
You don't even have any feelings
anymore.

427
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,314
When we got married,
you promised for better or worse...

428
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,199
...that you'd never make good.
That you'd always be nothing.

429
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,750
Well, look at us. We're so rich we
never even see each other anymore.

430
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,514
Edgar, you're " frittering away
your life in detail.

431
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,591
Simplify. Simplify".

432
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,311
Simplify, "schmimplify".
A little hard work never killed anybody.

433
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,712
LOUISA:
<i>Edgar was like someone bewitched</i>.

434
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,474
<i>Like the Sorcerer's Apprentice,</i>
<i>he couldn't stop</i>.

435
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,835
Get me 300,000 feet
of rust-proof chicken wire.

436
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,198
What is with our order on the
Mother Goose Atomic Disintegrator Kit?

437
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,837
Make them think they can't live
without door knobs that light up.

438
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,035
Think big.

439
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,919
Our musical mop, which plays
"Let Me Call You Sweetheart"...

440
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,196
...is a failure.
Get something happier...

441
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,352
...like "Stars and Stripes Forever"
to guarantee musical mop-up.

442
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,551
So it is just a simple equation:

443
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,474
Service quotient X plus
condensation-atmosphere quotient Y...

444
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,710
...plus smile-and-affability
quotient X...

445
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,269
...show in the last three months
a sales gain line...

446
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,715
...that has hop, hopped right off
the lousy board.

447
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,269
In short, boys, we are becoming,
by the figures...

448
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,398
...the big, bigger, biggest.

449
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,756
In re yours of the 23rd,
I am impatiently awaiting your order.

450
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,353
Hastily yours, Edgar Hopper.

451
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,909
There can be no delays.
If you insist on delaying...

452
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,674
...you can be replaced.

That's just part of my act,
you know.

1059
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,999
I get a list of the customers' names
before the show...

1060
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,879
...and then I make up little rhymes
using all their names.

1061
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,508
It's one of my specialties.
That ad-lib stuff.

1062
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,312
Coffee.

1063
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,238
Sugar.

1064
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,234
Danish? Serve the Danish.

1065
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,194
And for a big finale, a napkin.

1066
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,755
There's our Pinky, always at it.

1067
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,751
Pinky, ain't you ever off the floor?

1068
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,070
Why, it's Herman Bodkin,
I do declare...

1069
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,350
...and Ernie Wilkens
who's with him there.

1070
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,592
I said with a grin,
Ernie, your hair is getting thin.

1071
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,832
And Ernie answered,
"Who wants fat hair?"

1072
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,037
Oh, it's true.
I never seem to stop being on.

1073
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,151
Oh, I liked it.

1074
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,116
Are you performing around here?

1075
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,676
Am I performing around here?

1076
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,193
Look.

1077
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,076
That's me, Pinky Benson.

1078
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,551
Can I get you anything else?
It's on me.

1079
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,512
No, thank you.

1080
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,555
- What's doing?
- I got it, Clance.

1081
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,153
LOUISA:
Thank you.

1082
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,952
Say...

1083
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,112
...if you're not busy later,
would you like to watch my act?

1084
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,550
LOUISA:
<i>I hadn't decided what to do later</i>.

1085
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,280
<i>I even thought of staying</i>
<i>in this town for a few days</i>...

1086
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,158
...<i>till I made up my mind</i>.

1087
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,594
Well?

1088
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,592
Well, uh...

1089
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,870
- Well, sure. I'll come.
- Good.

1090
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,351
I gotta rush over there right now.

1091
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,796
It takes me two hours to put
on my costume and makeup.

1092
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,949
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1093
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,394
How's it going?

1094
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:12,076
Well, the management must love me.
I've been playing there for 14 years.

1095
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,192
See you later.

1096
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,076
Who ordered the well-done,
green-pea succotash?

1097
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,231
- Here, over here.
- MAN 1: Medium-well.

1098
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,119
- WAITER: Side of spinach.
- I ordered the creamed spinach.

1099
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,751
That's better for you. No cholesterol.
Mashed potatoes, well-done.

1100
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:38,351
- One rare hash brown.
- I ordered french fries. Take it back.

1101
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,630
- You always make such a fuss.
- Shut up!

1102
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:46,033
I agree. But stuff yourself, honey.
No man wants a fistful of bones.

1103
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,276
TRENTINO:
Okay. Okay.

1104
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,432
Here he is for your dinner pleasure.

1105
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,072
Jersey City's own Pinky Benson!

1106
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,474
Well, good evening,
friends and neighbors.

1107
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,796
Hey, who do we have here
with us tonight?

1108
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,353
The Shimkins!

1109
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,956
Rosie Shimkin was able
to get a ringside table.

1110
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,157
She's wearing a rose in her hat.
And with her is her husband Matt.

1111
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,912
And that is that.

1112
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,429
Dennis Horner is sitting
over there in the corner.

1113
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,275
Hiya, Dennis. And Peggy Norton.
Peggy Norton and her sister Min.

1114
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,398
Chewing on those bones
like Rin Tin Tin.

1115
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,279
So welcome all, welcome one.

1116
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,352
Lend an ear and have some fun.

1117
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,634
SINGING: <i>I think that you and I</i>
<i>Should get acquainted</i>

1118
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,075
<i>I'll just come up to you</i>
<i>And ask your name</i>

1119
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:43,152
What I say is, live
and leave me alone.

1120
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,276
<i>I'll say, "Isn't the weather fine?</i>

1121
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,399
<i>And aren't you really glad</i>
<i>So glad that you came?"</i>

1122
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,269
<i>Then after you</i>
<i>And I become acquainted</i>

1123
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,194
<i>I'll ask you if you'd like</i>
<i>To stay a while</i>

1124
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,197
<i>You'll say you would</i>

1125
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,551
<i>You'll give me a smile</i>
<i>Oh, goody-good</i>

1126
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,716
<i>You'll make my evening worthwhile</i>
<i>Before our little rendezvous ends</i>

1127
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,913
<i>We won't just be acquainted</i>

1128
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:17,350
<i>We'll be the very</i>
<i>Very best of friends</i>

1129
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,951
LOUISA: <i>I could see why</i>
<i>the management loved him</i>.

1130
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,399
<i>He didn't interfere one bit</i>
<i>with the sale of food and liquor</i>.

1131
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,550
<i>It was the worst act I'd ever seen</i>.

1132
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,194
<i>Just looking at Pinky</i>
<i>made me want to cry</i>...

1133
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,391
...<i>but he was so happy</i>
<i>and untroubled</i>.

1134
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,949
And I feel at home here,
as you can see.

1135
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,874
And in all the 14 years, you've never
wanted to play anywhere else?

1136
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,548
Oh, you mean the big time?

1137
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,878
Boy, why does everybody seem to think
you have to want to play the big time?

1138
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,474
Why? You get to the top
of the ladder...

1139
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,949
...you're a slave to your fans,
you've got no life.

1140
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,998
Then you gotta start worrying
about staying up there. Oh, no.

1141
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,072
Not for me. I'm happy
doing what I'm doing.

1142
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,198
And you know what? I teach
dancing to kids in the daytime.

1143
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,679
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

1144
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,916
My wife wanted me to get ahead.

1145
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,197
She wanted me to get an agent,
a press agent, publicity, audition.

1146
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,839
- Push, push, push.
- Your wife?

1147
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,230
Yeah, I was married once.
We were a team.

1148
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,914
She always wanted to be way up there.
So I let her go.

1149
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,311
And today that woman
is Greta Garbo.

1150
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,312
No. She married a guy with a lot
of dough and she left the business.

1151
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,352
I don't blame her.

1152
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,031
I don't blame her at all.

1153
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,029
I was just a guy who wanted
the simple kind of life.

1154
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,757
SINGS:
<i>And that's the story of my life</i>

1155
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:31,432
<i>As told to Louisa May</i>
<i>Hop Hop Hop Fli Anderson</i>

LOUISA: <i>Louisa May Hop Fli</i>
<i>Anderson Benson</i>.

1157

<i>Yes, we were married,</i>

1158
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,997
...<i>and we lived on our lovely houseboat</i>
<i>on the Hudson</i>.

1159
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,709
<i>I told him I had a great deal</i>

1160
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,632
...<i>but both of us forgot all about it</i>.

<i>Good morning, Mrs. Benson</i>
<i>How do you do?</i>

1163
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,233
<i>I'll give you just one kiss</i>
<i>Then I'll stop</i>

1164
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,710
<i>Because I gotta give</i>
<i>Our little boat a mop, mop, mop</i>

LOUISA:

You'll be late for your party.
Couldn't you just skip it?

Forever.

He was such a sweet man
when I met him.

...and I flew right here to Washington,
and that brings us up to date.

Well, you haven't said anything
for the last two husbands.

Now, let me see, you got married
to four men for love.

All of them were doomed
to success and extinction.

There was Hopper, Flint, Anderson

And one man, one man you hated.
That was Leonard Crawley.

Well, that's a very strong emotion,

Maybe you helped me after all.

1389
