1
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,659
Where are you headed, little lady?

2
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,897
Nowhere with you, numb-nuts. Buzz off!

3
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,045
See you Thursday, you gorgeous thing.

4
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:47,853
You picked a beautiful day to hitchhike.

5
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:52,019
Well, I've got a nice little VW back
at Stenson's Beach with a cracked block.

6
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:57,260
You guys wouldn't be going up
to Mill Valley, would you?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,093
Andy, aren't we going up to Mill Valley?

8
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:04,401
I got a couple of bottles of ice-cold beer
up there, if you're interested.

9
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:10,377
You son of a bitch.

10
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:14,277
Okay, pile in.

11
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,473
How long you been in the Western Gas
and Electric Company business?

12
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:48,982
I can't remember how long I've been in it.
How long have I been in it?

13
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,216
Turn in, right here.

14
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,291
Climb up this road here.

15
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,882
Yeah, I'll be right with you.

16
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:05,031
Better hang a left here, Harry.
There's a jam up on Bay.

17
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,690
What's with the citizen?

18
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,941
Police officer, what's the problem?

19
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,640
Thank God. He's inside.

20
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:50,651
Come on, it's a heart attack.

21
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,581
Wait here.

22
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,319
Make some room, please.
Please, move aside.

23
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,859
Please, move aside. This is an emergency.

24
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,955
Excuse us. Would you please move over.

25
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,229
Would you please give us room.
He's a police officer.

26
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:10,768
- Police? Where's the ambulance?
- This poor man's had a heart attack.

27
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,034
I think he's still breathing, though.

28
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,408
Come on, get up.

29
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,747
- Get up. Come on.
- What are you doing?

30
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,883
I say.

31
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,461
- Party's over.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.

32
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:37,655
What are you squawking about?

33
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:39,529
You got the free meal, didn't you?

34
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:42,866
Yeah, but I always enjoy the ride
in the ambulance.

35
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,365
Get out of here.

36
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,231
<i>All units, be advised that this is a 406.</i>

37
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:50,511
Harry, it's an '<i>'</i>all units.'<i>'</i>

38
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,339
Marvelous.

39
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,914
My old lady's gonna kill me.

40
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:03,924
She's doing a nine-church novena tonight
and I told her I'd be home early for supper.

41
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,624
<i>Suspects are armed.</i>

42
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,164
<i>Code 33. Code 33.</i>

43
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:18,102
Inspector 71 responding to your 406.

44
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,016
What's going on?

45
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:35,113
A couple of bastards
held up that liquor store.

46
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,691
One of our guys stumbled in on it
and they shot him up.

47
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:40,385
They grabbed four hostages.

48
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:44,262
They said they'll start shooting them
one by one unless we give them a car.

49
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:45,799
Then what are you waiting on?

50
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,835
Lieutenant Brannigan of Robbery.

51
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,370
He said to stall them until he gets here.

52
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,939
- God, don't let him kill me.
- We want the goddamn car, right now.

53
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:06,085
<i>All right. But you don't get anything</i>
<i>till I come in and talk.</i>

54
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:09,180
All right, you bastard,
lay your piece on the hood of that car.

55
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,930
What about me? I'm your partner.

56
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:22,026
I may have to move fast and I don't need
too much <i>linguini</i> to hold me back.

57
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,333
You got a lot of class, Harry.

58
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,861
You get cute,
I blow this nice lady all over you. Let's go.

59
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:05,278
On the floor, motherfucker.

60
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:08,076
For God's sakes, mister, do like he says!

61
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,409
This is my best sports jacket.

62
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,352
I said, get your ass on the floor,
you dirty son of a bitch!

63
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:15,321
Spread eagle. Move it!

64
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,492
Get down there.

65
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:24,057
San Francisco's finest.

66
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:28,732
Mitch.

67
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:32,903
Roll him over.

68
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:38,777
He's clean.

69
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,075
Here's the story.

70
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,621
First, we want all the pigs out of here.

71
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:51,421
Second, we want a car...

72
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:53,920
...with a police radio.

73
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,857
Deliver it right out there in front.

74
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:58,831
We're taking two hostages:

75
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,929
Both the women.

76
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,536
If you don't do exactly what I tell you,
we blow their fucking heads off!

77
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:10,307
- You got the picture?
- Yeah.

78
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,013
What are you waiting for?

79
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:23,882
Run, you jive-ass bastard.

80
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:38,163
- What do they want?
- They want a car.

81
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:42,670
What are you going to do?

82
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:45,345
Give them one.

83
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,927
You son of a bitch!

84
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:43,963
Tell me, what makes a man
crazy enough to join the cops?

85
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:46,866
If you find out, you let me know, huh?

86
00:12:51,412 --> 00:12:55,348
$14,379.

87
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:59,653
- How can that be?
- You want an itemized account?

88
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:03,748
You took out two front doors,
one front window, 12 feet of counter.

89
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:08,522
Plus damages to the stock.
Plus one city vehicle totaled.

90
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:13,497
As well as three hostages in the hospital,
all of whom will probably sue the city.

91
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:15,933
- For what?
- Excessive use of force.

92
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,938
For your information, Callahan...

93
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,772
...the minority community has just about
had it with this kind of police work.

94
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,835
By the '<i>'</i>minority community,'<i>'</i>
you're talking about the hoods?

95
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:27,848
It so happens that they are
American citizens, too.

96
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:30,315
What about the lady with the shotgun
in her ear?

97
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,353
I'm not going to debate this with you.

98
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,082
I've been on the phone
to the Mayor twice this morning.

99
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:37,454
He went right through the ceiling over this.

100
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,390
Did you tell him about the meeting?

101
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,429
- What meeting?
- The meeting right here, two months ago...

102
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:45,625
...when you said high priority was:
'<i>'</i>Run these hoods out of here.'<i>'</i>

103
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,258
I never said to use violence.

104
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:49,701
What should I do,
yell '<i>'</i>trick-or-treat'<i>'</i> at them?

105
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:50,931
Come on, Harry.

106
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:53,906
I expect you,
and every other man on this force...

107
00:13:53,975 --> 00:13:57,433
...to behave with restraint
or turn in his resignation.

108
00:13:58,112 --> 00:13:59,943
You're on notice, Callahan.

109
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:03,575
This little show of yours yesterday
is exactly the kind of thing...

110
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:06,586
...this department
is no longer prepared to tolerate!

111
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:08,344
Is that clear?

112
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,852
Yes, sir.

113
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,955
- If that's all, Captain, I've got work to do.
- But not in Homicide.

114
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:20,762
What?

115
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,464
You've been transferred to Personnel.

116
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:25,366
To Personnel?

117
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,237
That's for assholes.

118
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,882
I was in Personnel for 10 years.

119
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,778
Yeah.

120
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,111
That's it.

121
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:44,181
You report tomorrow to the Oral
Examining Board. 9:00, on the dot.

122
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:51,024
No, you haven't got the picture.

123
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:54,759
I'm the robber, you're the cop.

124
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,632
Now, I'm in a market, see?

125
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:00,936
And you've just caught me, dead bang.
A 211 in the act.

126
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,170
But I'm coming out, and I've got a hostage.

127
00:15:03,244 --> 00:15:05,678
A kid with a gun at his head.

128
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:07,977
There's no way you're gonna take me alive.

129
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:10,745
You've 10 seconds to make up your mind,
'<i>'</i>Here I come.'<i>'</i>

130
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:12,183
What are you gonna do?

131
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:13,379
One...

132
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,615
...two, three...
- You're under arrest.

133
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,250
...four, five...
- Do something!

134
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:20,226
...six, seven<i>...</i>
- How tall is he?

135
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,728
Don't just stand there, goddamn it,
do something!

136
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,560
Bang, you're dead.

137
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:28,233
- You're late, Callahan.
- Sorry about that.

138
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,031
- Hello, Krause.
- Hi.

139
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,769
All right, Bustanoby,
you'll be notified of your grade.

140
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,306
You were told to be here at 9:00.

141
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:39,846
We have 50 officers out there to test.

142
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,446
- For how many vacancies?
- Eight.

143
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:47,120
There will be five men and three women
promoted to inspector out of this group.

144
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:49,884
- Three women?
- Do you object, Inspector?

145
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:53,323
Now, who might you be?

146
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:56,154
This is Mrs. Grey of the Mayor's staff.

147
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,357
She's here to monitor these examinations.

148
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,900
This is Inspector Callahan.

149
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:02,435
Yes, I know something
of Inspector Callahan.

150
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:05,196
And I'd like to tell you...

151
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:09,107
...it's the Mayor's plan that the department
be brought more into line with...

152
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,704
...the mainstream of 20th century thought.

153
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:17,775
How does he figure to do that?

154
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:21,915
For one thing...

155
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:23,422
...his Honor intends...

156
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,517
...to broaden the areas of participation
for women in the police force.

157
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,661
Well, that sounds very stylish.

158
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,196
I think he also said something about:

159
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:38,963
'<i>'</i>Winnowing the Neanderthals
out of the department.'<i>'</i>

160
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:47,071
Well, I guess we better get on with it.
Next applicant.

161
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,982
- Officer Moore?
- Yes, sir.

162
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,046
As you know, this is the final stage
in your examination.

163
00:16:56,124 --> 00:17:00,891
It's an informal test to try and get an idea
of your ability to think on your feet.

164
00:17:00,962 --> 00:17:03,556
Your reaction to stress and pressure.

165
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:08,165
Your ability to apply the law
in a hypothetical situation and so on, okay?

166
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:09,731
Yes, sir.

167
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,370
How long have you been on the force?

168
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,305
- Nine years.
- What department?

169
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:17,344
Mainly Personnel and Records.

170
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,676
- Personnel and Records?
- Yes, sir.

171
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:30,185
Have you any questions for the applicant?

172
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,060
Questions? How fast do you run the 100?

173
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:40,698
Come on, Callahan,
you know how this board functions.

174
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,336
All right, I'm sorry.

175
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:51,008
You know that...

176
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,581
...if you make inspector
under the Mayor's new guidelines...

177
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:59,384
...you might just be out riding
in a police car?

178
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,784
Yes, sir, that's what I'm hoping for.

179
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:04,024
Officer Moore, maybe you'll tell us...

180
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:06,525
...about your most important felony arrest.

181
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:10,895
I've never made a felony arrest.

182
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:17,098
Well, maybe you'll tell us about
your best misdemeanor arrest, then.

183
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:20,906
I've never made
a misdemeanor arrest either.

184
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:24,169
Then what the hell gives you the right
to become an inspector...

185
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:27,043
...when some men have been
on the street for 10 or 15 years?

186
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:30,515
'<i>'</i>The woman's place is in the home.'<i>'</i>
Is that what you're trying to say?

187
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,644
Do you think this is an encounter group?

188
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,917
I want to know what she'll do
when someone points a gun at her...

189
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,480
...and says, '<i>'</i>Hit the deck! '<i>'</i>

190
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:40,891
You're just deliberately trying
to fail this candidate, aren't you?

191
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:43,931
Well, if she fails out there,
she gets her ass blown off.

192
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,898
It's my ass!

193
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,863
And my hard luck.

194
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:52,636
Except, out there you'll have a partner.

195
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:55,175
If you get blown away,
he gets blown away with you.

196
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:58,542
And that's a hell of a price to pay
for being stylish.

197
00:19:04,785 --> 00:19:07,549
Are you finished with the questioning?

198
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,518
Hypothetical situation, huh?

199
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:16,927
I'm standing on the street corner...

200
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:19,728
...and Mrs. Grey there comes up
and propositions me.

201
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,167
She says, if I come home with her for $5,
she'll put on a show...

202
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:27,230
...with a Shetland pony.
- If this is your idea of humor, Inspector<i>...</i>

203
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:33,545
All right, what are you trying
to do here, Callahan?

204
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:37,277
I'm trying to find out if anybody here
knows what law is being broken...

205
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:39,319
...besides cruelty to animals.

206
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:42,552
That's a conspiracy,
under Title 7, Section 182...

207
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:45,091
...Paragraph 1
of the California State Penal Code.

208
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,627
A conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor
is a felony...

209
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:51,597
...and according to People vs. Bashor in...
- Yes, that's right, good answer.

210
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,965
Thank you, Officer Moore,
you'll be notified of your grade.

211
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:19,752
After I take care of the guard
and get his keys...

212
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:23,024
...we drive to the far end
of warehouse 50A. Lalo?

213
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,824
All right, now that's<i>...</i>

214
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,528
I drop you off at that end,
at that small door, then I drive around...

215
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,165
...to the wharf side of the warehouse.
You open up that first big door...

216
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:38,542
...I drive it in and back up
to the first compound on the right.

217
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,040
Karl and Tex?

218
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,174
Hey, man,
we grab the M-16 automatic rifles, right?

219
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,410
Wanda?

220
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,787
Locate and take any explosives.

221
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,784
Dynamite, detonators, and any plastics.

222
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,792
Right. Henry Lee?

223
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:56,827
I tote and I load all the ammo
for the M-16s, okay, man?

224
00:20:57,031 --> 00:20:58,123
Miki?

225
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:02,067
Locate the Law rockets. They should be
somewhere in the back of the compound.

226
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,663
That's the most important item.
Tex, are you sure of their location?

227
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,470
Hey, I sweated in that place for five years.

228
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,533
They're there, I promise.

229
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,775
All right, you guys.

230
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,940
- This is for the people.
- Right on, '<i>'</i>for the people.'<i>'</i>

231
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:19,345
Jesus, spare me.

232
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:57,323
- What is it?
- Gas Company.

233
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:59,985
- What's the trouble?
- We've a gas leak in the area.

234
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,221
We got to check out
your underground pipes.

235
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:05,129
For pete's sake,
don't smoke until we tell you it's okay.

236
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,996
I won't.

237
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:20,470
It's seeping down into your sewer system.
This whole damn block could go!

238
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,483
- You got a phone I could use?
- Yeah, right this way.

239
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:41,501
Let's go.

240
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:02,678
Charlie left the gate open.

241
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,549
Better check it.

242
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,607
Tony, call a backup.

243
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:38,417
- I'm going to check around.
- Frank, watch yourself.

244
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,328
Law's rocket!

245
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,035
- Beautiful.
- Yes.

246
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:07,005
Lalo, get the rest of these loaded.

247
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,358
You'll blow us out of here.
Be quiet. Are you all right?

248
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,285
Let us get these.

249
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:27,225
Freeze.

250
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:47,883
All of you, hold it right there!
Put those boxes down.

251
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:54,127
You, back there,
stand up where I can see you.

252
00:25:54,194 --> 00:25:58,426
And drop that gun.
Put your hands over your head and freeze!

253
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:08,372
- Now, just wait a second, mister.
- Now you shut up and listen.

254
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:12,809
You just blink an eyelid
and I'll mail you home to Mama in a box.

255
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:15,174
Now, all of you, against the fence!

256
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:17,350
Now!

257
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:25,324
You, too, honey!

258
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:31,860
Oh, Jesus!

259
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:35,631
Oh, my God. Jesus!

260
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:40,769
Oh, baby, it's all right,
I'll get you out. I'll get you home.

261
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:42,706
Bobby, help me. Help me get her up.

262
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:45,768
- You're going to get us caught.
- No, we'll make it.

263
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:48,144
- She's dead.
- She's not dead!

264
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:49,944
The hell she isn't!

265
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:56,450
Come on, it's over.

266
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:17,935
Get it on there.

267
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:22,746
Lalo, get up in there. Come on.

268
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:47,596
Halt, police! Halt or I'll fire!

269
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,337
I'm gonna get this son of a bitch.

270
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:53,911
Goddamn it!

271
00:28:03,657 --> 00:28:06,854
Well, he said it looked like
a regular Gas Company truck.

272
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,625
I'm checking with the Marin County
Sheriff's Department.

273
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:14,531
Might tie in with those two bodies
they found up there last week.

274
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,133
Yes, sir.

275
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,332
How's DiGeorgio?

276
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,873
Well, Irene is in there with him now.

277
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:26,502
Is that supposed to be
some kind of answer?

278
00:28:27,014 --> 00:28:29,539
Harry, he's just been given the last rites.

279
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,841
- Get what you can, huh?
- I will.

280
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,784
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- I know.

281
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,027
Hello, Harry.

282
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:43,224
He's been asking for you.

283
00:28:43,463 --> 00:28:44,794
How is he?

284
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:46,957
He's in and out.

285
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,440
I'll smoke a cigarette.

286
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,075
It's a war, isn't it?

287
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:04,310
I guess I never really understood that.

288
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:21,833
Frank, what happened?

289
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,404
I had them dead bang. And then I<i>...</i>

290
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,574
Sorry.

291
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:42,177
There's something
you wanted to tell Harry.

292
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,917
Harry, listen, the punk who cut me...

293
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:49,555
...l've seen him before.

294
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,157
Where?

295
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:54,158
I just can't make the name.

296
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:57,669
Well, where do you know him from, Frank?

297
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,836
That homicide, remember?

298
00:30:00,474 --> 00:30:01,941
The old hooker...

299
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,840
...up on Filmore district.

300
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:05,945
The summer of '71?

301
00:30:07,281 --> 00:30:08,373
What about it?

302
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:11,781
Well, he was one of the pimps
we questioned.

303
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,987
We liked him for it, Harry.

304
00:30:15,455 --> 00:30:17,650
We liked him real good.

305
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:21,385
As I recall, we liked everybody
north of Market Street on that one.

306
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:26,455
He had one of those cutesy-pie
little boy names:

307
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,427
Charlie or something, or Bobby.

308
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:34,665
I'll check Records,
they should have your notes.

309
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:39,802
Ten-to-one they blow it.

310
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,148
Not this time, Frank.

311
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,280
Maybe you better get some rest, huh?

312
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:50,556
Do you have to go just yet?

313
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:52,884
Not if you don't want me to.

314
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:54,885
Thanks, Harry.

315
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:04,569
Get Irene.

316
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:15,944
- Did you talk to Records?
- No, not yet. That was McKay.

317
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,084
We just got a tape from those bastards.
I'll see you in my office in 30 minutes.

318
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,190
Code Blue, intensive care.

319
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:30,794
Thirty minutes.

320
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:34,566
<i>We want $1 million</i>
<i>or we start blowing things up.</i>

321
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:37,034
<i>The People's Revolutionary Strike Force.</i>

322
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,933
<i>Remember Fessenheim.</i>

323
00:31:39,906 --> 00:31:41,168
Fessenheim?

324
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:43,107
It's being checked.

325
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:46,202
This Revolutionary Strike Force,
are they on your list?

326
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:51,007
Nothing.

327
00:31:51,184 --> 00:31:53,675
- Think it's legitimate?
- Probably not.

328
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:58,080
This is Lieutenant Bressler in Homicide.

329
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:02,183
Well, what are you doing
about those records? What's happening?

330
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,259
What do you mean, '<i>'</i>what records'<i>'</i>?

331
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:06,959
I talked to you about them
half an hour ago.

332
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,901
Homicide. Filmore district.
Inspectors Callahan and DiGeorgio.

333
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:17,136
What are you talking about,
a written request?

334
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:19,369
Well, who's got the keys?

335
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,680
Look. I'm coming down there
in five minutes...

336
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:27,311
...and you better have those files open,
you pencil-pushing son of a bitch!

337
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,590
You don't have to make threats.

338
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,850
I'm telling you, I'm going to nail the guy...

339
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:36,828
...who carved DiGeorgio
if I have to do it on my own time.

340
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:38,296
That won't be necessary.

341
00:32:38,365 --> 00:32:41,960
You've been back in Homicide
since 9:00 this morning, didn't you know?

342
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:46,838
No. I've been down in Records
looking up an old homicide.

343
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:48,067
Any luck?

344
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:51,372
Well, I've got 11 names here
of known pimps.

345
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:56,305
- I think our man is one of them.
- Judson, Maddox, Skidmore.

346
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:59,747
Shall I tell you my instinct on this?

347
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,880
- Black militants.
- No, it keeps coming up hookers.

348
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:05,720
The girl who was shot in the warehouse
is Miki Waleska.

349
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,487
She was a known prostitute.

350
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:11,463
What we've got here is
a well-organized group of militants...

351
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:15,365
...with enough explosives to blow half
of San Francisco away, including...

352
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:17,369
...Law's rockets!

353
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:18,665
- Law's rockets?
- Yeah.

354
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:21,571
The Army's giving us a demonstration
at the firing range...

355
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:23,632
...in exactly 35 minutes.

356
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,372
I'd like everyone connected
with the case to be there.

357
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:28,607
I want you to know what you're up against.

358
00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:32,584
I've too much to do. Besides, I've already
been checked out on a Law's rocket.

359
00:33:32,652 --> 00:33:33,983
Your partner hasn't.

360
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,514
My partner?

361
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:45,826
Shit!

362
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:48,359
You know Inspector Moore?

363
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,734
Inspector.

364
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:54,930
I'll see you both out at the firing range.

365
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:57,942
Inspector?

366
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:06,643
Listen, Inspector, I realize that you are not
particularly happy by this assignment.

367
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,985
- You don't think I'm up to it, do you?
- Right.

368
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,121
All right...

369
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:15,821
...I would like to get one thing straight,
and that is the fact I'm a woman.

370
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:18,592
I consider that fact absolutely irrelevant
from now on...

371
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:22,431
...because I will not accept,
nor do I expect, any special consideration.

372
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:24,035
Marvelous.

373
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,830
The Law's rocket,
for all intents and purposes...

374
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:30,974
...a one-shot, throwaway,
disposable bazooka.

375
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,347
It is a fiberglass tube, 45 inches long...

376
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:38,578
...3 inches in diameter,
which fires a single projectile...

377
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:43,089
...designed to penetrate armor plating
up to the thickness 3<i>/</i>4 of an inch.

378
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,351
If you've all had a good look at the rocket,
I'll demonstrate how it works.

379
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:50,997
To fire the rocket, you first pull this pin...

380
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:53,231
...dropping the rear cover...

381
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,431
...then pull.

382
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:58,135
Your front sight,
your rear sight spring up<i>...</i>

383
00:34:58,205 --> 00:35:00,503
I got word from Pathology...

384
00:35:00,574 --> 00:35:04,010
...at noon they're posting that guard
that was killed last night.

385
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:06,375
- Check on it.
- I'll be there.

386
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:08,238
Captain?

387
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:09,777
Go ahead.

388
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:12,749
Gentlemen, if you'll keep your eyes
on that half-track...

389
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,016
...l'll demonstrate how effective
this weapon can be.

390
00:35:35,942 --> 00:35:38,877
Coming, Inspector?

391
00:36:11,678 --> 00:36:13,339
- Inspector?
- Yeah?

392
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:15,914
- 13.5 in my gym shorts.
- What?

393
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:19,480
My time in the 100.
You asked me at the Orals Board.

394
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:22,087
- You think I was picking on you?
- Yes.

395
00:36:22,922 --> 00:36:24,617
It was nothing personal.

396
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,713
Right.

397
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,725
I don't think you know
what we do for a living in Homicide.

398
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:29,784
I'll find out.

399
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:31,990
I hope you don't find out the hard way.

400
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,226
How fast do you run the 100, Inspector?

401
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:35,734
Beats me.

402
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:39,100
I meant to tell you how sorry I am
about your partner.

403
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:40,935
He's not the first one I've lost.

404
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:45,603
I know, Fanducci in '68 and Smith in '72,
but it wasn't your fault.

405
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:48,440
- How'd you know that?
- I checked on your records.

406
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:51,147
I don't want to get killed
anymore than you do.

407
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:52,479
What's the matter?

408
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:55,519
The Black guy with the briefcase.
I know him from somewhere.

409
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,078
- Tan suit?
- Yeah.

410
00:36:58,191 --> 00:36:59,988
What did he do?

411
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,987
Can't remember. It's not important.

412
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:08,562
- Tell me, ever been to one of these before?
- No.

413
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:12,297
In that case,
I'd like to suggest that you sit out here.

414
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:15,604
Please don't concern yourself, Inspector.

415
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:22,579
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi.

416
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:24,514
Who's the pretty lady?

417
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:27,182
That's my partner, Inspector Moore.

418
00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:29,212
You've missed most of it.

419
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,120
We got hung up on a firing range.

420
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:34,820
I've got it on tape for you.
We've just finished the abdominal cavity.

421
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,657
I'm interested in the wound.

422
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,927
The entry wound
was above the right renal area...

423
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:43,594
...between the ninth and tenth rib,
penetrating up into the chest cavity...

424
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,433
...perforating the right lung.

425
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:48,668
There was also damage
to some of the other vital organs...

426
00:37:48,742 --> 00:37:50,869
...pancreas, kidneys, etcetera.

427
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:54,277
- What kind of a knife was it?
- A long heavy blade.

428
00:37:54,914 --> 00:37:56,905
We're going into the skull now.

429
00:37:58,551 --> 00:38:02,112
I'd say, an educated guess,
it was one of those killing knives:

430
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:05,624
A Marine Corps Boy,
or one of those Special Forces' Randalls.

431
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:07,326
Any bruises about the face?

432
00:38:07,394 --> 00:38:11,160
Indications that the killer clamped
his left hand over the mouth, from behind.

433
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:12,926
- Professional?
- Textbook.

434
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:18,101
On first examination,
no exterior damage to the skull.

435
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:00,672
Subject brain shows no <i>contrecoup</i>- type
damage or blood clotting.

436
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:03,778
Jesus H. Christ, Harry,
come here and look at this!

437
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:07,047
- It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
- What's that?

438
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,552
What it says: '<i>'</i>Eat at Luigi's! '<i>'</i>

439
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,169
Welcome to Homicide.

440
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,950
What are you doing? Come here.

441
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:54,561
Excuse me, I'm with him.

442
00:39:57,303 --> 00:40:01,569
I was coming down the hall to take a leak
when this whole thing blew.

443
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:03,635
Anybody in there?

444
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:08,273
- No, I don't think so.
- Where are you going?

445
00:40:08,348 --> 00:40:10,612
I got a group of kids,
some of them are missing.

446
00:40:10,717 --> 00:40:12,742
- Help him out.
- Me?

447
00:40:12,852 --> 00:40:15,514
Great. Just step out here, will you?

448
00:40:15,688 --> 00:40:17,918
Well, we were lucky this time.

449
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,758
It's getting so that you can't even go
to the can in peace.

450
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,899
- We've got them all, they're okay.
- Good.

451
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:34,601
You didn't see anybody go in there
before the explosion, did you?

452
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:35,436
No.

453
00:40:35,508 --> 00:40:38,966
You sure? Black guy with a tan hat
and suit, briefcase.

454
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,369
I did see a guy like that.

455
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:43,312
Was he a short guy, about 5-foot-1?

456
00:40:43,383 --> 00:40:45,374
No, this dude was 6 foot.

457
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,850
That's him.

458
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,717
It was a bomb, I think I saw who did it.

459
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:55,761
- Any idea who it was?
- He looked familiar...

460
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,420
- Inspector?
- Just a minute.

461
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,060
- You better check the mug shots.
- Inspector?

462
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:03,500
Honey, do you mind, we're talking.
This is very important.

463
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,937
Now, you better check the mug shots,
we just got another message.

464
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,837
They're asking for $2 million now.

465
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:10,398
- $2 million?
- I just saw him.

466
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:13,172
- Who?
- Tan suit and a hat and a briefcase.

467
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,310
- Where?
- Right down here.

468
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:19,943
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- Why the hell didn't you ask me?

469
00:41:31,397 --> 00:41:33,058
There he is, look!

470
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:51,058
Jesus!

471
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,169
Damn it.

472
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:14,619
What the hell's going on here?

473
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,951
What are you doing here?

474
00:45:30,403 --> 00:45:32,871
- Who are you?
- Police officer.

475
00:46:25,258 --> 00:46:27,419
All right, speedy, you're under arrest.

476
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,485
In the name of God, man, this is a church.
What are you doing?

477
00:46:30,563 --> 00:46:32,895
I'm a police officer, this man's under arrest.

478
00:46:32,965 --> 00:46:36,423
Father, help me, I wasn't doing a thing.
This guy is just rousting me.

479
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,665
Would it be asking too much
to see some credentials, Officer?

480
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:42,572
This guy runs like a rabbit.
I'm not about to let him go.

481
00:46:42,642 --> 00:46:45,133
I'd like to see the credentials, right now.

482
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,073
If you insist.

483
00:46:51,884 --> 00:46:54,876
- Callahan, Inspector.
- Well, Callahan...

484
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:59,087
...I think you're a disgrace to this city.

485
00:46:59,158 --> 00:47:01,251
Okay. Nobody move!

486
00:47:10,136 --> 00:47:11,467
Marvelous.

487
00:47:13,406 --> 00:47:14,532
Yes, I think so.

488
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:16,802
Harry, wait a minute, I'm just talking to...

489
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,343
Jesus Christ!

490
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:20,308
Give him my best.

491
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,812
I'll call you back.

492
00:47:21,948 --> 00:47:24,508
Don't worry,
it's been disarmed by the bomb squad.

493
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:28,417
But it's definitely the explosive
out of the Hamilton Firearms works.

494
00:47:29,021 --> 00:47:32,047
There are times when I can only stand you
as a human being.

495
00:47:32,792 --> 00:47:34,453
What about the punk?

496
00:47:34,827 --> 00:47:37,295
- You mean the suspect.
- Suspect, my ass.

497
00:47:37,363 --> 00:47:39,888
He isn't talking,
but we've got a make on him.

498
00:47:39,966 --> 00:47:41,627
His name is Henry Lee Caldwell.

499
00:47:41,701 --> 00:47:44,898
And he is a member
of a Black militant group called Uhuru.

500
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,271
- Pusseau, shelve that.
- Uhuru?

501
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,976
It's run by a guy called Big Ed Mustapha.

502
00:47:52,044 --> 00:47:55,241
Mustapha, down the Mission district.

503
00:47:55,314 --> 00:47:57,282
I thought that guy looked familiar.

504
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,647
Where's my partner?

505
00:47:58,718 --> 00:48:00,686
She's in the can.

506
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:03,152
She's been in there
ever since she found out...

507
00:48:03,222 --> 00:48:07,056
...that she was packing this thing,
in that briefcase, all over San Francisco.

508
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:09,458
Harry, do me a favor. Go easy on her, huh?

509
00:48:09,528 --> 00:48:12,691
It's her first day
and it's been a damn long one.

510
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:17,733
If she wants to play lumberjack, she's got
to learn to handle her end of the log.

511
00:48:37,423 --> 00:48:39,323
Okay, I give up, what's this?

512
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:43,291
This is the Filmore chapter
of the VFW: Very Few Whites.

513
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:47,660
I don't suppose it would do any good
to suggest you wait in the car?

514
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:49,860
Don't concern yourself, Inspector.

515
00:48:55,107 --> 00:48:58,474
Well, if it ain't the mighty whitey
and friend.

516
00:48:59,578 --> 00:49:01,910
I'm looking for Big Ed Mustapha.

517
00:49:02,248 --> 00:49:05,979
Sorry, honkie, she can stay,
but you've got to go.

518
00:49:06,452 --> 00:49:10,411
Yeah, baby, we're trying to keep up
the standards, you understand.

519
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:13,456
- You're not making us feel too welcome.
- You're welcome.

520
00:49:13,526 --> 00:49:16,495
You're about as welcome as a turd
in a swimming pool.

521
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:29,902
Well, lookie here, if it ain't the fuzz.

522
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:31,872
I'm looking for Ed Mustapha.

523
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:36,278
- You hold some kind of warrant, honkie?
- What I'm holding is Henry Lee Caldwell.

524
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,541
I've never heard of him.

525
00:49:38,617 --> 00:49:42,849
Let's see how fast you and the lady fuzz
can get your white asses out of here.

526
00:49:43,722 --> 00:49:45,519
What is Henry Lee into now?

527
00:49:50,629 --> 00:49:53,621
He's been playing with dynamite.
Are you Mustapha?

528
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,031
Yeah, that's right.

529
00:49:56,836 --> 00:49:59,361
Why don't you just come
into my office here.

530
00:50:01,407 --> 00:50:02,704
Just you.

531
00:50:04,276 --> 00:50:07,143
Don't worry, pig,
we'll see she don't get lonesome.

532
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:12,509
Well, that's mighty white of you.

533
00:50:15,421 --> 00:50:18,288
Now, gentlemen, before anybody
does anything uncalled for...

534
00:50:18,357 --> 00:50:21,758
...l'd like to take this chance
to point out I am a police officer...

535
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:24,921
...and if you touch me
with intent to do bodily harm<i>...</i>

536
00:50:31,036 --> 00:50:32,435
Sit down, Callahan.

537
00:50:32,972 --> 00:50:34,701
Where do I know you from?

538
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,502
You don't.

539
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:42,746
I just know you.

540
00:50:48,387 --> 00:50:51,788
Now, what's Henry Lee been up to?

541
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,820
You telling me you don't know?

542
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:57,624
He don't come around here,
not for a long time.

543
00:50:57,997 --> 00:50:59,396
Where is he?

544
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:04,061
He went white.
Why, did he do something else foolish?

545
00:51:05,971 --> 00:51:10,237
He and his friends were involved
in a ripoff at the Hamilton Firearms.

546
00:51:10,342 --> 00:51:12,139
I heard about that.

547
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,943
Would you like to buy into that?

548
00:51:15,014 --> 00:51:17,482
Four counts of murder, aiding and abetting.

549
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:21,987
You got the wrong number, boy.
We don't deal in violence.

550
00:51:22,154 --> 00:51:23,712
What do you deal in?

551
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,017
Waiting.

552
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,886
For what?

553
00:51:29,595 --> 00:51:31,825
Waiting for all you white honkies...

554
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:35,492
...to blow each other up
so we can move right on in.

555
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:41,005
Tell me about Henry Lee
and these friends of his.

556
00:51:41,073 --> 00:51:45,134
Some paddy-dudes he met in Vietnam.
Why?

557
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,171
Anybody on this list here grab you?

558
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:53,617
Hey, man, why should I want to help you?

559
00:51:54,687 --> 00:51:58,020
If you don't, I have to talk to Robbery.
They might be interested...

560
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,024
...in these elaborate furnishings.

561
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,456
What are you talking about?

562
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,327
Room 401, Fairmont.

563
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,998
'<i>'</i>Rest easy at the Holiday Inn.'<i>'</i>

564
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:12,700
Okay, so?

565
00:52:13,472 --> 00:52:15,406
Maybe they're a little warm.

566
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:17,207
I'll tell you what:

567
00:52:18,043 --> 00:52:21,376
One of my boys got busted
on a possession charge.

568
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:25,414
Now, you get him off and forget about
my interior decorator...

569
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:28,048
...and I'll see what I can do.

570
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,517
That's asking a lot.

571
00:52:29,493 --> 00:52:30,790
You want a lot.

572
00:52:32,696 --> 00:52:35,597
A thing like this can ruin my image.

573
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,962
I'll see what I can do.

574
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:43,702
What about the list?

575
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,978
Bobby Maxwell.

576
00:52:57,555 --> 00:52:58,954
He's the main man.

577
00:52:59,356 --> 00:53:00,618
You know him?

578
00:53:01,058 --> 00:53:03,117
Stone waste of white.

579
00:53:03,394 --> 00:53:04,918
Where can I find him?

580
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:08,358
I'll check around.

581
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,131
You do that. Much obliged.

582
00:53:13,304 --> 00:53:16,933
Callahan, you're on the wrong side.

583
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:19,101
How do you figure that?

584
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,401
You go and put your ass on the line...

585
00:53:21,478 --> 00:53:25,312
...for a bunch of dudes who wouldn't even
let you in the front door anymore...

586
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:27,975
...than they would me.

587
00:53:28,052 --> 00:53:30,418
- I'm not doing it for them.
- Who, then?

588
00:53:34,325 --> 00:53:36,623
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

589
00:53:40,598 --> 00:53:44,261
- If it becomes necessary to pull this piece...
- Having fun, Inspector?

590
00:53:44,335 --> 00:53:47,304
If you're through socializing,
we do have work to do.

591
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:50,032
Son of a bitch.

592
00:53:53,677 --> 00:53:57,408
If you have some sort of objection
to the way I handled myself...

593
00:53:57,481 --> 00:53:59,210
...I wish you'd just say so.

594
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:02,042
I thought I was doing all right.

595
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:10,458
Marvelous.

596
00:55:04,148 --> 00:55:06,309
<i>All right</i>, <i>Mustapha...</i>

597
00:55:07,217 --> 00:55:10,880
<i>... this is Captain McKay</i>
<i>of the San Francisco Police Department.</i>

598
00:55:12,189 --> 00:55:16,353
<i>I'm ordering you to throw down</i>
<i>your weapons and come out peacefully.</i>

599
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:25,326
<i>You are totally surrounded.</i>

600
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,067
<i>Mustapha</i>, <i>do you hear me?</i>

601
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:31,903
<i>Come out with your hands</i>
<i>raised over your heads.</i>

602
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,510
I don't want to seem ungrateful,
Your Honor...

603
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:11,173
...I just feel that it might be a better idea.

604
00:56:11,248 --> 00:56:14,046
Well, I'm still a little confused.

605
00:56:14,952 --> 00:56:17,546
Now, you and the SWAT team
made the arrest...

606
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:20,886
...but you want the credit to go
to Inspectors Moore and Callahan?

607
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,756
Your Honor,
I just felt it might be a better tactic...

608
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:27,024
...politically,
what with the election coming up soon.

609
00:56:27,164 --> 00:56:31,328
To show how your new guidelines
for women in the police have worked.

610
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:34,836
Sort of an I-told-you-so situation,
if you know what I mean, sir.

611
00:56:34,905 --> 00:56:39,399
Yes, I see. It's an excellent idea.
What do you think, Jimmy?

612
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,101
Yes, sir, I couldn't agree more.

613
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:45,813
You have proved to be quite an asset...

614
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:48,644
...to the department
and to this administration.

615
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:49,777
Thank you, sir.

616
00:56:49,853 --> 00:56:53,914
Mr. Mayor, the presentation of
the commendation starts in five minutes.

617
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:56,960
- I think we'd better get going, sir.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

618
00:56:57,094 --> 00:57:00,063
Captain, off the record,
there are going to be changes...

619
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,567
...in the department after the election,
and you'll figure greatly in my plans.

620
00:57:04,902 --> 00:57:07,769
I'm sure you'll make the right decision, sir.

621
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:15,201
Do you have any comments on the arrest
of the Black militants yesterday?

622
00:57:15,646 --> 00:57:17,511
Later, Jim, later.

623
00:57:18,615 --> 00:57:22,779
Now, as Mayor of San Francisco,
I want to make it official.

624
00:57:23,187 --> 00:57:27,351
This is one hell of a cop.
And here come a couple more.

625
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:29,187
Good morning, right this way.

626
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:32,660
Lieutenant Bressler, Inspector Moore,
would you move toward the stairs.

627
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:35,197
Mr. Mayor, would you join them.

628
00:57:35,265 --> 00:57:37,699
We're gonna have
some photographs taken here.

629
00:57:42,105 --> 00:57:43,936
- Is this all right, Mayor?
- Yes.

630
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:46,703
Would you kindly move in
just a little tighter.

631
00:57:48,345 --> 00:57:52,213
Here we are, gentlemen, the two
inspectors who made the Mustapha arrest.

632
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:55,046
This is Inspector Moore and Callahan.

633
00:57:56,386 --> 00:58:00,015
How about one with the Mayor
and Inspector Moore?

634
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:03,949
Captain McKay, can you switch places
with Inspector Moore?

635
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:07,386
Move in, nice and close.

636
00:58:07,464 --> 00:58:09,659
And, Callahan, you get in there, too!

637
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:12,361
We're ready.

638
00:58:12,436 --> 00:58:16,202
Inspector Moore is one of the first
of her sex in the whole country...

639
00:58:16,273 --> 00:58:19,140
...to become
a full-time homicide investigator.

640
00:58:19,343 --> 00:58:23,279
And we're very proud
of her stunning professionalism.

641
00:58:24,715 --> 00:58:26,683
Thank you very much.

642
00:58:27,184 --> 00:58:31,052
Jimmy, do you want to...
Let me have some time with these people.

643
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:31,951
Certainly.

644
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:34,013
Could we move off to the right.

645
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:36,389
We'll see each other at the conference.

646
00:58:37,694 --> 00:58:40,561
Now, anybody here have
the letters of commendation?

647
00:58:41,365 --> 00:58:43,060
- Jimmy?
- Yes, sir?

648
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,727
- Who's got the letters?
- Right here, sir.

649
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,839
- Wait a minute, what's this?
- These are some form letters.

650
00:58:50,307 --> 00:58:53,538
They'll do, just so you hand them
something for the cameras.

651
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:54,975
Well, all right.

652
00:58:55,045 --> 00:58:56,637
Thank you, Jimmy.

653
00:58:56,713 --> 00:59:01,446
The Mayor will introduce you,
hand you your letters of commendation...

654
00:59:01,552 --> 00:59:04,350
...and then you'll each move off to the left,
out of camera.

655
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:06,685
And then I'm going to take
this opportunity...

656
00:59:06,757 --> 00:59:08,952
...to deliver a few boots in the rear...

657
00:59:09,026 --> 00:59:12,792
...to those people who think
the police department has gone to hell...

658
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:15,096
...under this administration.

659
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:17,190
Two minutes, Mr. Mayor.

660
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:19,098
Well, ready? Let's go.

661
00:59:22,573 --> 00:59:25,235
- Just one minute, Mr. Mayor.
- Harry!

662
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:28,603
Would you mind telling me
what these commendations are for?

663
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:31,443
- This can wait until after the broadcast.
- No, it can't.

664
00:59:31,515 --> 00:59:33,506
All right, just watch it, Callahan.

665
00:59:33,584 --> 00:59:37,748
The Inspector has a right to know
what he's being commended for.

666
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:43,691
Specifically, it's for your part
in smashing the group of terrorists...

667
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,561
...who were trying to blackmail
San Francisco out of $2 million.

668
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:49,997
Let's look at the...

669
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:53,264
If you're talking about the Mustapha bust,
nobody smashed anything.

670
00:59:53,337 --> 00:59:53,996
What?

671
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:57,598
I made a deal with him. He was to help me
find out who the people were.

672
00:59:57,674 --> 01:00:01,075
- Inspector Moore and I weren't even there.
- What is he talking about?

673
01:00:01,144 --> 01:00:05,547
- No weapons or explosives were found.
- We'll find them.

674
01:00:05,616 --> 01:00:09,108
The people are still out there.
They'll blow hell out of half this city.

675
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:11,552
Meanwhile, you're telling everyone
how great we are.

676
01:00:11,622 --> 01:00:13,487
Button your lip. That's an order.

677
01:00:13,557 --> 01:00:17,049
If you want to jerk these people off
you can, but don't do it with me.

678
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:19,891
Callahan, you just got yourself
a 60-day suspension.

679
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,123
Make it 90.

680
01:00:21,198 --> 01:00:23,564
180. Give me your star.

681
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:29,002
Here's a seven-point suppository, Captain.

682
01:00:29,373 --> 01:00:31,000
What did you say?

683
01:00:31,108 --> 01:00:33,235
I said stick it in your ass.

684
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:49,659
- Mr. Mayor, you're on.
- I know, Jimmy, I know.

685
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:56,758
I'll have to go down there and...

686
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:01,994
Go down there and jerk them off.

687
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,613
Inspector Callahan.

688
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:17,376
Damn it, Harry, slow down.

689
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:24,358
What's the matter?

690
01:01:24,695 --> 01:01:25,923
Nothing.

691
01:01:26,029 --> 01:01:28,862
Why aren't you up there
getting your commendation?

692
01:01:29,766 --> 01:01:31,427
You don't give up, do you?

693
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:32,832
Sometimes.

694
01:01:33,704 --> 01:01:34,932
Not you.

695
01:01:36,006 --> 01:01:37,701
What makes you think so?

696
01:01:38,508 --> 01:01:40,169
A woman's intuition.

697
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:49,645
Listen. Harry, if you need anything
or if there's anything I can do...

698
01:01:50,454 --> 01:01:52,319
...access to records or files...

699
01:01:52,823 --> 01:01:55,223
...anything, call me up.

700
01:01:56,893 --> 01:01:58,417
I might just do that.

701
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:00,020
Fine.

702
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:04,591
Anytime.

703
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:07,399
Come on, take a walk.

704
01:02:07,704 --> 01:02:08,966
All right.

705
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:19,837
I was wondering if I'll still have a job
when I get back there.

706
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,983
What difference does it make?

707
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,820
What do you want to be a cop for, anyway?

708
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:29,686
Why aren't you married
and having kids like everybody else?

709
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,057
Why aren't you?

710
01:02:32,362 --> 01:02:34,728
Nobody in their right mind's asking.

711
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:38,896
<i>Coitis interruptus.</i>

712
01:02:39,136 --> 01:02:40,569
I beg your pardon?

713
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:43,731
Coit Tower, it's vaguely phallic,
don't you think?

714
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:48,769
I never thought of it that way.

715
01:02:50,013 --> 01:02:52,004
I make up names for things.

716
01:02:52,082 --> 01:02:56,985
For instance, you're "Cold, bold Callahan
with his great big.44."

717
01:02:59,656 --> 01:03:03,592
Every other cop in this city
is satisfied with a.38 or a 357.

718
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,254
What do you have to carry that cannon for?

719
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,196
So I can hit what I aim at, that's why.

720
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:11,663
A 357 is a good weapon,
but I've seen.38s...

721
01:03:11,735 --> 01:03:14,761
...careen off windshields.
No good in a city like this.

722
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:18,899
I see, so it's for the penetration?

723
01:03:20,644 --> 01:03:23,511
Does everything have
a sexual connotation with you?

724
01:03:25,248 --> 01:03:26,772
Only sometimes.

725
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:30,444
Want to go have a few beers?

726
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:39,391
You've got a lot of nerve
the way you talk to the Mayor.

727
01:03:39,462 --> 01:03:40,520
And McKay.

728
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:43,758
Besides being wrong, they're stupid.

729
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:48,135
They arrested the wrong guy,
but their egos won't let them admit it.

730
01:03:48,638 --> 01:03:50,697
- You mean Mustapha?
- Yeah.

731
01:03:52,108 --> 01:03:54,235
I had a deal with Mustapha.

732
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:58,541
He put me on to Bobby Maxwell, the guy
who knifed DiGeorgio, I'm sure of it.

733
01:03:58,615 --> 01:04:00,344
Where can we find Maxwell?

734
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:02,977
We can't, now with Mustapha busted,
can we?

735
01:04:04,187 --> 01:04:07,213
Maxwell's a prime candidate,
he's a real tough cookie.

736
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,349
He was in Vietnam, likes combat.

737
01:04:09,426 --> 01:04:12,486
He was finally busted out
of the service on a Section 8.

738
01:04:12,562 --> 01:04:15,793
Well, we're good citizens,
why don't we post Mustapha's bail?

739
01:04:15,866 --> 01:04:17,390
Not a bad idea.

740
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:20,899
Big question is: Will he work with us now?

741
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:25,197
Want to have a couple of beers?

742
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:28,573
Why didn't I think of that?

743
01:04:35,585 --> 01:04:38,053
Only thing they had worth drinking
was apple juice.

744
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:39,884
- Anything's okay.
- Here.

745
01:04:39,956 --> 01:04:41,321
I'm sorry.

746
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,887
You like fishing?

747
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:49,094
I have an Auntie Kate, I'm called after her.

748
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,597
When I was a little girl,
she had a ranch up in Oroville.

749
01:04:54,404 --> 01:04:57,896
We used to fish together,
I'd even bait my own hooks.

750
01:04:59,576 --> 01:05:01,669
Is that what they call you, Kate?

751
01:05:02,846 --> 01:05:04,541
That or Inspector Moore.

752
01:05:07,117 --> 01:05:10,985
Well, Inspector Moore, I don't like
to get too friendly with partners.

753
01:05:11,054 --> 01:05:13,921
I know. I mean I understand.

754
01:05:14,624 --> 01:05:15,613
Kate...

755
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:21,256
...you know whoever draws you
as a partner could do a lot worse.

756
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:51,920
Mr. Mayor, I think if we want to beat
the crowd, we should leave now.

757
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:55,726
You think so? You may be right.

758
01:05:55,899 --> 01:05:57,867
I'll see you, Karl.

759
01:05:57,934 --> 01:05:59,902
You don't have to come back to the office.

760
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:01,904
- Take over, fellas.
- Take it easy.

761
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:04,406
- You hold onto this.
- Sure thing.

762
01:06:07,477 --> 01:06:10,412
- Nice to see you.
- We are running a little late, sir.

763
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:15,417
- Please, come on, sir.
- How you doing?

764
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:32,664
All right, talk to me.

765
01:06:32,736 --> 01:06:33,828
He's on his way.

766
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:34,927
Beautiful.

767
01:06:35,805 --> 01:06:38,239
- Everything set?
- I'm ready.

768
01:07:27,457 --> 01:07:28,583
Hi there.

769
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:32,292
Well, hello there, young lady.
What can I do for you?

770
01:07:33,096 --> 01:07:34,723
Raise the bridge.

771
01:07:36,466 --> 01:07:37,831
Raise the bridge?

772
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,500
Are you kidding?

773
01:07:41,237 --> 01:07:42,568
When I tell you to.

774
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:52,844
I wish we could've stayed.

775
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:56,842
I think the Giants
are gonna finally win one.

776
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,380
I don't know, Mr. Mayor,
looks like it could end up as a no-hitter.

777
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:04,585
Besides, you do have
a testimonial this evening.

778
01:08:04,661 --> 01:08:09,155
God, testimonials.
They never end, do they?

779
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:15,061
Give me the Taser gun.

780
01:08:15,605 --> 01:08:16,799
Karl.

781
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:27,274
Man, this thing looks like something
from a <i>James Bond</i> movie.

782
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,942
Sure it'll work?

783
01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:32,687
Karl, there's 25,000 volts in this thing.

784
01:08:32,755 --> 01:08:36,418
Even the fat boy's gonna do what we want
once we hook him up to it.

785
01:08:45,502 --> 01:08:46,594
Okay, Tex.

786
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,242
Raise it.

787
01:09:24,908 --> 01:09:27,138
What the hell! Dave, get me out of this.

788
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:35,608
Don't hit the Mayor, goddamn it!

789
01:09:58,341 --> 01:10:00,468
Who the hell are you? What do you want?

790
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:01,601
You.

791
01:10:02,545 --> 01:10:05,946
Get away from me, you son of a bitch!
I'm not going anywhere with you.

792
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:08,006
The hell you aren't!

793
01:11:08,077 --> 01:11:12,605
<i>We're still trying to get details and</i>
<i>as they come in we'll get them to you.</i>

794
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:15,879
- <i>Somebody said the Mayor was killed.</i>
- <i>That was the first report.</i>

795
01:11:15,952 --> 01:11:17,749
<i>Then we heard he was kidnapped.</i>

796
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,415
<i>There's something heavy going on</i>
<i>in China Basin</i>, <i>that's for sure.</i>

797
01:11:21,491 --> 01:11:24,085
<i>Okay</i>, <i>listen</i>, <i>I've got to go.</i>
<i>Thanks for calling.</i>

798
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,128
<i>You're rapping with Bubba</i>, <i>go ahead.</i>

799
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:29,289
The Mayor of this pig city
has been taken prisoner of war...

800
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:31,890
...by the People's Revolutionary
Strike Force.

801
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,435
<i>Everybody's a comedian tonight.</i>
<i>Look</i>, <i>this is very serious.</i>

802
01:11:38,308 --> 01:11:39,707
Hey, man, look...

803
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:43,007
...l'm leaving a tape of our demands
in the booth across the street.

804
01:11:43,813 --> 01:11:45,576
<i>Power to the people!</i>

805
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:49,747
<i>Okay</i>, <i>we're gonna do a little music</i>
<i>and I'll be right back.</i>

806
01:12:09,706 --> 01:12:10,866
Harry?

807
01:12:12,608 --> 01:12:15,543
- What can I do for you?
- We've got to talk.

808
01:12:15,878 --> 01:12:17,402
Go right ahead.

809
01:12:19,182 --> 01:12:22,640
I want all the information
that you have on this case, Callahan.

810
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:27,415
- Black militants, remember?
- Come on, Harry, so we were wrong.

811
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:32,423
- I'll handle this one.
- No. We play as a team.

812
01:12:34,597 --> 01:12:38,863
As I remember, the last time we played
as a team I got the cue stuck in my ass.

813
01:12:38,935 --> 01:12:42,769
Harry, we just got a tape,
this time they're asking for $5 million.

814
01:12:42,839 --> 01:12:45,808
Or they send back the Mayor,
one piece at a time.

815
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:48,503
The negotiations
are at a crucial point right now.

816
01:12:48,578 --> 01:12:51,206
What are you going to do,
pay the bastards?

817
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:56,151
Well, the Mayor's family is loaded,
they can afford it.

818
01:12:57,453 --> 01:13:01,116
What about the people who were killed?
Or isn't it against the law anymore?

819
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:04,353
We're not debating the point,
I'm simply saying you're out of it.

820
01:13:04,427 --> 01:13:05,485
What you're saying is:

821
01:13:05,561 --> 01:13:09,759
Whoever's got balls to grab a hostage,
will do it. And can walk away from it.

822
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:12,394
I'm saying, you're out of it.

823
01:13:12,468 --> 01:13:16,165
If I hear otherwise,
you're finished as a cop in San Francisco.

824
01:13:16,372 --> 01:13:22,106
I want every bit of information you have
on this case, every lead. Is that clear?

825
01:13:22,311 --> 01:13:24,779
- May I make a statement, McKay?
- Go ahead!

826
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:27,205
Your mouthwash ain't making it!

827
01:13:45,835 --> 01:13:48,269
You got any more surprises for me today?

828
01:13:48,971 --> 01:13:50,563
What do you mean?

829
01:13:50,907 --> 01:13:53,137
I mean, are you and McKay
going to throw...

830
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:56,201
...another one
of those paddy-wagon parties for me?

831
01:13:58,181 --> 01:14:01,116
That frigging McKay,
he's something, isn't he?

832
01:14:02,018 --> 01:14:05,385
Now, I want a line
on this Revolutionary Strike Force.

833
01:14:06,722 --> 01:14:08,622
You got to be kidding.

834
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:10,482
No, I'm not kidding.

835
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,586
If you don't give it to me,
I'll let it out that you're an ear.

836
01:14:13,663 --> 01:14:17,064
Don't say that, not even joking.

837
01:14:20,503 --> 01:14:21,970
Who's joking?

838
01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:27,303
You really are a dirty bastard,
ain't you, Harry?

839
01:14:27,977 --> 01:14:29,205
The dirtiest.

840
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,910
Word has it that Bobby Maxwell and this...

841
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,151
...chick, Wanda...

842
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:42,850
...they're running around
with these dudes who call themselves...

843
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:46,156
...the People's Revolutionary Strike Force.

844
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:47,355
"Call themselves."

845
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:50,228
They don't believe in that shit.

846
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:54,500
They're just interested in the bread,
that's where their head's at.

847
01:14:54,871 --> 01:14:56,964
Where do I find this Wanda?

848
01:14:57,139 --> 01:15:01,803
She's a tall brunette,
works at Tiffany's on Broadway.

849
01:15:04,514 --> 01:15:05,708
Thanks.

850
01:15:10,386 --> 01:15:12,081
Do them in.

851
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:15,214
You can count on that.

852
01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:46,780
Hi there.

853
01:15:46,856 --> 01:15:49,620
- Is this Tiffany's?
- Like the sign says.

854
01:15:49,692 --> 01:15:51,319
My name is Larry Dickman...

855
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:54,192
...my brother was here last week.
Tall fella, balding.

856
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:55,628
Remember him well.

857
01:15:55,698 --> 01:15:57,723
Has a gold tooth right in front.

858
01:15:57,867 --> 01:15:59,198
That's him.

859
01:16:01,404 --> 01:16:03,668
You know what I bet you'd like.

860
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,941
I bet you'd like to learn the love tussle.

861
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:11,007
That sounds swell,
but I was looking for a certain girl.

862
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,605
We've got a whole bunch of them,
warm and willing.

863
01:16:13,683 --> 01:16:15,878
- Her name's Wanda.
- Anybody you want.

864
01:16:15,952 --> 01:16:18,250
My brother says she's terrific.

865
01:16:18,387 --> 01:16:19,581
Can I trust you?

866
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:20,747
Yeah.

867
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,324
What it is, is $75.

868
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,084
$75?

869
01:16:25,161 --> 01:16:27,493
Of course, that includes...

870
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:33,166
We're not supposed to do this,
you understand, because the heat is on...

871
01:16:33,235 --> 01:16:35,430
...but seeing your brother was here...

872
01:16:36,806 --> 01:16:40,173
...the $75 includes personal instructions...

873
01:16:40,242 --> 01:16:43,211
...in 32 positions of lovemaking.

874
01:16:43,746 --> 01:16:45,111
That many?

875
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:49,916
$75, you pay me first.

876
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,285
Oh, yeah.

877
01:16:59,428 --> 01:17:00,918
Right this way.

878
01:17:11,774 --> 01:17:12,798
What's this?

879
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:16,333
You've heard of a tackling dummy,
well, it's the same principle.

880
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:21,007
I see, for $75 you get to make it
with a rubber dolly.

881
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,675
Thirty-two ways!

882
01:17:22,918 --> 01:17:24,408
Any objections?

883
01:17:24,487 --> 01:17:27,422
No, is there one
where the man gets on top?

884
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:28,590
Thirty-three!

885
01:17:29,492 --> 01:17:32,757
Just take your duds off, honey.
I'll send your teacher in.

886
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,095
Hi there.

887
01:17:39,268 --> 01:17:40,599
You're not Wanda.

888
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:43,571
Well, these are the breaks. Needs air.

889
01:17:43,973 --> 01:17:46,567
Can't hump a limp dummy, I always say.

890
01:17:49,578 --> 01:17:52,308
Speaking of limp dummies,
hadn't you better strip?

891
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:53,678
Where's Wanda?

892
01:17:53,749 --> 01:17:56,274
Beats the hell out of me, Tom.

893
01:18:02,658 --> 01:18:04,956
Now, I'm gonna ask you just one last time.

894
01:18:05,027 --> 01:18:08,087
- Where's Wanda?
- I don't know.

895
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:10,764
She left here a couple of weeks ago.

896
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:13,802
Ask Buchinsky.
He runs the whole damn street.

897
01:18:13,903 --> 01:18:17,532
- Where do I find this Buchinsky?
- Down the hall, to the right.

898
01:19:03,686 --> 01:19:05,984
<i>That's right</i>, <i>my friends</i>,
<i>nearer my God to thee.</i>

899
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:07,955
<i>That's why brother Bob is here.</i>

900
01:19:08,023 --> 01:19:10,617
<i>Brother Bob is here</i>
<i>to bring you nearer to the Lord.</i>

901
01:19:10,693 --> 01:19:13,685
<i>To bring you nearer to the man.</i>
<i>To save your soul.</i>

902
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:15,990
<i>Salvation is where it is at</i>, <i>brother.</i>

903
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:20,329
You're trespassing.
This is private property.

904
01:19:20,603 --> 01:19:23,538
- You a lawyer?
- Seeing as you ask, yes, I am.

905
01:19:23,606 --> 01:19:26,097
I'm looking for a tall brunette,
named Wanda.

906
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:30,668
I want to tell you something, punk.
This is a protected operation.

907
01:19:30,913 --> 01:19:34,076
Now, you can end up with your balls
in spaghetti sauce.

908
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,244
Are you trying to say you've a lot of clout
with the syndicate?

909
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:41,380
Enough to blow you away with one call.
Now get the hell out of here!

910
01:19:41,457 --> 01:19:46,053
I'll tell you what you are to me.
Just a maggot who sells dirty pictures.

911
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:09,841
- Wanda, where is she?
- Go to hell.

912
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:13,410
- One more time, Wanda.
- All right, all right.

913
01:20:15,758 --> 01:20:18,693
She quit a couple of weeks ago,
that's all I know.

914
01:20:20,396 --> 01:20:21,795
She got religious.

915
01:20:22,932 --> 01:20:26,368
- What do you mean?
- Hanging around the church on Garvey.

916
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,874
<i>Captain</i>, <i>is it true</i>
<i>you received another ransom tape...</i>

917
01:20:33,943 --> 01:20:36,173
<i>... from the People's Revolutionary</i>
<i>Strike Force?</i>

918
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:38,406
- <i>Yes</i>, <i>we have.</i>
- <i>Is the Mayor all right?</i>

919
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,780
<i>We have been assured that he's okay</i>
<i>but</i>, <i>of course</i>, <i>there won't be...</i>

920
01:20:43,085 --> 01:20:46,816
<i>... any payment or arrangement</i>
<i>for transportation until we have...</i>

921
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:48,754
<i>... seen the Mayor with our own eyes.</i>

922
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:52,419
- <i>Then you're letting the kidnappers go?</i>
- <i>That is the agreement.</i>

923
01:20:52,494 --> 01:20:55,759
- <i>Any idea where they are holed up?</i>
- <i>Not yet...</i>

924
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:59,631
<i>... but we should get one more message</i>
<i>this evening. If you'll excuse me.</i>

925
01:20:59,802 --> 01:21:02,999
<i>Is it true that Inspector Callahan</i>
<i>has been taken off this case?</i>

926
01:21:03,072 --> 01:21:04,903
<i>I'm sorry</i>, <i>no more questions.</i>

927
01:21:13,949 --> 01:21:15,041
What do you have?

928
01:21:15,117 --> 01:21:19,315
I got the priest, John Voss, Father John,
very militant, very big in prison reform.

929
01:21:19,388 --> 01:21:24,223
He runs rehabilitation seminars
in all the prisons in this area.

930
01:21:24,293 --> 01:21:27,592
This is a list of the prisoners
that took the seminar in San Quentin.

931
01:21:27,663 --> 01:21:30,291
Bobby Maxwell never missed a session.

932
01:21:31,867 --> 01:21:33,494
- You wait here.
- Wait, wait.

933
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:36,800
Fessenheim. The latest ransom tape
mentioned Fessenheim again.

934
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:38,567
And what does that mean?

935
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:42,805
Last year, two bombs were exploded
at a nuclear plant near Fessenheim, France.

936
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:46,471
How about that.

937
01:21:55,758 --> 01:21:57,282
The body of Christ.

938
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,293
The body of Christ.

939
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:09,064
The body...

940
01:22:10,339 --> 01:22:12,102
Remember me, Father?

941
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:13,697
Yes.

942
01:22:14,243 --> 01:22:16,006
What is it you want, Callahan?

943
01:22:16,078 --> 01:22:18,603
I'd like to talk to you
about Bobby Maxwell.

944
01:22:19,581 --> 01:22:21,139
Then get a warrant.

945
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:43,960
- Just a minute.
- I thought I made it clear to you, Officer.

946
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:46,371
I have nothing whatsoever to say to you.

947
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:51,636
And what right do you have to come
in here and harass me in my church?

948
01:22:52,581 --> 01:22:55,880
- Is that a confessional over there?
- You want to make a confession?

949
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:58,647
You first!

950
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:02,418
Where the hell's Maxwell?

951
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:04,785
God just might forgive you, but I won't.

952
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:08,159
Why do you protect these people?
Do you know how many they've killed?

953
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:11,791
Sacrifices have to be made, mister.

954
01:23:12,067 --> 01:23:13,864
These people are at war!

955
01:23:13,936 --> 01:23:15,164
So am I.

956
01:23:15,738 --> 01:23:18,798
How dare you pull a gun
in the house of God.

957
01:23:18,874 --> 01:23:21,035
If you don't believe in the sanctity...

958
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:24,307
I don't have time
to argue religion with you, boy.

959
01:23:32,454 --> 01:23:34,945
Look at her hands!

960
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:48,261
- There wasn't supposed to be any killing.
- Is she dead?

961
01:23:54,877 --> 01:23:56,572
I close my eyes to this.

962
01:23:59,982 --> 01:24:01,779
Father in heaven, help me.

963
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:03,977
You can't close your eyes anymore.

964
01:24:06,455 --> 01:24:08,184
Now, where's Maxwell?

965
01:24:20,702 --> 01:24:21,964
Alcatraz.

966
01:24:22,871 --> 01:24:24,361
A place to hole up.

967
01:24:26,175 --> 01:24:29,042
I don't suppose
it would do any good to suggest...

968
01:24:30,813 --> 01:24:32,303
Forget it.

969
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:38,552
<i>No further communications</i>
<i>have been received since the last</i>...

970
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,784
Nothing. You sure Wanda
got those tapes to the cops?

971
01:24:43,258 --> 01:24:45,749
Bobby, I don't know.

972
01:24:46,728 --> 01:24:49,492
I don't know, I don't... I wasn't with her.

973
01:24:55,404 --> 01:24:58,066
- If you didn't think she could do it...
- Shut up!

974
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,802
- What are you doing here?
- A lousy cup of coffee, okay?

975
01:25:10,686 --> 01:25:13,154
Hey, can't you see it says no trespassing?

976
01:25:15,124 --> 01:25:16,989
Get the hell out of here.

977
01:25:20,496 --> 01:25:23,522
Jesus Christ, man, get your ass out there!

978
01:26:22,357 --> 01:26:23,551
Lalo.

979
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:26,560
Let's get the Mayor.
We'll bring him in here and hold out.

980
01:28:40,595 --> 01:28:43,689
I'll get the bar.
You get that son of a bitch out of there.

981
01:28:58,246 --> 01:28:59,372
Freeze!

982
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:03,916
All right, let him go.

983
01:29:05,921 --> 01:29:09,687
Move over there, Your Honor. That's fine.

984
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:15,686
Okay, now, I want you very slowly...

985
01:29:16,765 --> 01:29:18,733
...to put down that weapon...

986
01:29:19,167 --> 01:29:21,761
...and then on the deck,
and spread your legs.

987
01:29:23,972 --> 01:29:25,701
Are you kidding me?

988
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:29,802
You laugh at me, you bastard,
and I'll shoot you where you stand.

989
01:29:41,957 --> 01:29:45,415
Let's go, Your Honor. Let's go!

990
01:29:45,694 --> 01:29:48,788
Let's get out of here. Now speed it up!

991
01:29:50,298 --> 01:29:51,822
Stay with me.

992
01:29:52,334 --> 01:29:53,665
Hold it.

993
01:29:53,735 --> 01:29:56,602
Just take it very easy.

994
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:02,506
You relax, do just as I say,
and I'll get you home, all right?

995
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:03,475
Yes.

996
01:30:03,545 --> 01:30:07,140
All right, take it slow. Wait a minute.

997
01:30:08,884 --> 01:30:10,249
Here we go.

998
01:30:43,452 --> 01:30:44,885
Harry, look out!

999
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:09,268
Oh, Harry, I messed up.

1000
01:31:09,478 --> 01:31:11,207
You're doing just fine, Kate.

1001
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:12,974
Let me get you out of here.

1002
01:31:16,785 --> 01:31:19,879
Don't concern yourself, Harry.

1003
01:31:27,262 --> 01:31:28,524
Get him.

1004
01:31:35,237 --> 01:31:36,864
You can count on it.

1005
01:32:09,771 --> 01:32:11,636
You fucking fruit!

1006
01:32:20,048 --> 01:32:21,538
Get up there!

1007
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:27,081
Go on, move!

1008
01:32:49,077 --> 01:32:50,874
Oh, God!

1009
01:33:30,585 --> 01:33:34,021
Callahan, you saved my life.

1010
01:33:35,357 --> 01:33:39,487
I'll never be able to thank you.
I'll never be able to tell you.

1011
01:33:39,561 --> 01:33:43,554
There will be a letter of commendation
there for you.

1012
01:34:03,284 --> 01:34:05,013
The chopper's here.

1013
01:34:05,787 --> 01:34:08,654
Don't you want to ride...

1014
01:34:43,525 --> 01:34:44,753
<i>Maxwell.</i>

1015
01:34:45,226 --> 01:34:49,322
<i>Bobby Maxwell</i>,
<i>this is Captain McKay speaking.</i>

1016
01:34:50,131 --> 01:34:51,894
<i>We have your money.</i>

1017
01:34:52,901 --> 01:34:55,893
<i>A plane is waiting for you at the airport.</i>

1018
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:59,934
<i>We have acceded to all your demands...</i>

1019
01:35:00,575 --> 01:35:02,509
<i>... so release the Mayor.</i>

1020
01:35:03,311 --> 01:35:07,304
<i>The pilot of this helicopter</i>
<i>will fly you and your men to safety.</i>
