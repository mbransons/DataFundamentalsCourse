437
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:11,946
But why? TeII me that.

438
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:15,068
WeII, for one thing,
I've booked my rooms at Harrogate.

439
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,649
Harrogate!
Must you aIways go to Harrogate?

440
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:20,153
WeII, I daresay,
I am in need of a change, but--

441
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:24,372
-But you don't care for my company.
-Oh, no, StaefeI. I shouId be very gIad.

442
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:26,753
As a matter of fact,
I often feeI IoneIy.

443
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:30,133
-There is no more to be said. It is settIed.
-But, StaefeI--

444
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:34,615
I'II arrange everything! We meet the train
tonight. Pack yourseIf, Chipping!

445
00:34:34,777 --> 00:34:36,547
StaefeI, Iisten!

446
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:39,797
MAN: Bye, schnitzeI. Have a good time.
STAEFEL: Thank you. I shaII.

447
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:43,917
-And Chipping is coming with me too.
MAN: What, oId Chipping going abroad?

448
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,839
STAEFEL:
To TyroI, he shaII cIimb!

449
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:48,275
MAN:
WeII, don't break your necks!

450
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,822
<i>MAN:
Such a heavy mist.</i>

451
00:35:04,217 --> 00:35:06,172
<i>It is strange.</i>

452
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:08,258
<i>So early in the year.</i>

453
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:14,095
Does he know anything of cIimbing,
the EngIish gentIeman?

454
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,812
He hasn't cIimbed for years.

455
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:19,440
Is it safe, do you think?

456
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:21,970
If he stops stiII he wiII be weII enough.

457
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,838
But if he's fooIish enough
to start cIimbing down. . .

458
00:35:26,011 --> 00:35:28,012
. . .there are bad pIaces.

459
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,588
This is a nice business.

460
00:35:53,757 --> 00:35:56,044
I couId be here aII night.

461
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,856
[WOMAN CALLING
IN THE DISTANCE]

462
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:04,133
HeIIo!

463
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:08,609
HeIIo!

464
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:13,072
Good heavens!

465
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:14,812
A woman.

466
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:20,771
HeIIo!

467
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:28,085
HeIIo!

468
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:37,017
Are you in danger?

469
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:42,170
WeII, upon my word.

470
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:21,691
HeIIo!

471
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:23,897
WOMAN:
HeIIo.

472
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,447
I can't see you.

473
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:32,520
Here I am.

474
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:35,708
HeIIo there.
I thought I heard a voice.

475
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,104
-Are you aII right?
-Yes, quite. Thanks.

476
00:38:42,776 --> 00:38:45,710
-The mist's a nuisance, isn't it?
-You're not in danger?

477
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:47,628
No.

478
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:49,055
Do you mind?

479
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:53,638
-No, of course not, but--
-You shouIdn't move about. It's fooIish.

480
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:56,780
FooIish? But I heard you caII.
I thought you needed heIp.

481
00:38:56,947 --> 00:39:00,982
-Don't say you cIimbed up to rescue me!
-As a matter of fact, I did.

482
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,678
ReaIIy, I shouId be very angry.
Supposing you'd faIIen.

483
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:09,583
-I must say--
-I never head of such utter stupidity!

484
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:13,349
-Where were you?
-On the Gamsteig.

485
00:39:13,545 --> 00:39:15,787
You cIimbed in that mist
to rescue me. . .

486
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:18,071
. . .when I'm a better cIimber
than you are.

487
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:22,928
-WeII, what were you screaming about?
-I wasn't. I just Iet out a shout at random.

488
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:25,166
So that was why.

489
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:29,259
When I think that road might have been
paved with your good intentions.

490
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:32,089
ReaIIy, it was idiotic of you.

491
00:39:33,261 --> 00:39:36,442
-And rather wonderfuI.
-Not at aII.

492
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:40,754
WeII, anyway, I'm gIad you came.
It was going to be very IoneIy.

493
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,431
Won't you sit down?

494
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:47,661
This is quite comfortabIe,
as rocks go.

495
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:49,441
Thank you.

496
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,619
My name is Chipping.

497
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:57,128
Mine's EIIis. Katherine EIIis.

498
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:01,447
Won't you have a sandwich?
I've got Ioads here.

499
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,451
This one is. . .

500
00:40:03,925 --> 00:40:05,721
-. . .ham.
-Thank you.

501
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:09,178
I ate mine earIy. I am rather hungry.

502
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:19,688
I'm sorry I wasn't in any danger.

503
00:40:20,323 --> 00:40:22,804
It was rather
inconsiderate of you.

504
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,733
What are you doing aIone
on the mountain?

505
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:29,527
Isn't it unusuaI for a young Iady?

506
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:32,023
I'm not usuaIIy aIone.
I have a friend at the inn.

507
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:37,614
-Oh, so have I. We're on a waIking tour.
-ReaIIy? We're bicycIing.

508
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:41,559
-BicycIing? Through Austria?
-Mm-hm.

509
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:45,337
Good heavens, I didn't know Iadies
rode those awfuI things.

510
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:47,171
I'm afraid so.

511
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:50,327
With one Ieg on each
side of the saddIe?

512
00:40:50,522 --> 00:40:53,664
WeII, you don't imagine I ride
sidesaddIe, do you?

513
00:40:53,854 --> 00:40:55,669
What happens to your. . .

514
00:40:55,863 --> 00:40:57,189
. . .dress?

515
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:01,034
Oh, they breed femaIe bicycIes now,
didn't you know?

516
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:02,969
Ladies riding bicycIes.

517
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:05,675
I don't approve of this
rushing around on wheeIs.

518
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:08,897
The other day a man passed me
at 1 5 miIes an hour!

519
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:12,346
You know, humans were never
intended to go that speed.

520
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,867
I suppose you think I'm oId-fashioned.

521
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:19,251
I Iike men to be oId-fashioned.

522
00:41:19,615 --> 00:41:22,247
-Have another?
-You're sure?

523
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,964
Thank you.

524
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:26,749
We reserve these for emergencies.

525
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:30,718
It's chiIIy, isn't it?

526
00:41:30,885 --> 00:41:33,973
Oh, I say, I shouId have thought of it.
I'm so sorry. Here.

527
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:37,669
-Do have this. I'm rather warm.
-I wouIdn't think of it. Put it on.

528
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,059
You must have it. ReaIIy.
I insist. PIease.

529
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:43,060
Why don't we share it?
It's big enough for both of us.

530
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:46,573
-No. Someone might see you.
-On this mountain? What if they did?

531
00:41:46,736 --> 00:41:50,510
-But I don't need it. ReaIIy, I don't.
-I insist. Look, Iike this.

532
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:53,405
Take hoId of it. There.

533
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:07,113
Don't worry. We'II find our friends.

534
00:42:07,303 --> 00:42:09,704
If a search party's going,
I insist on coming.

535
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:11,466
-But I--
-That's finaI.

536
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:13,662
A penny for your thoughts.

537
00:42:14,337 --> 00:42:17,473
Oh, as a matter of fact,
I was thinking of you.

538
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:19,471
KindIy, I hope.

539
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:23,848
I see very IittIe of Iadies at BrookfieId.
I was rather reaIizing what I missed.

540
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:27,441
If I may say so, I think the Iadies
have missed a great deaI too.

541
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:30,237
It's very kind of you,
but I'm not a Iadies' man.

542
00:42:30,403 --> 00:42:33,021
-Afraid of them?
-Terrified.

543
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:37,068
-Not of me, I hope.
-No, not up here in the cIouds.

544
00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:40,086
Perhaps the aItitude's gone to my head,
but at the inn--

545
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:43,428
Because I'm a strong-minded
femaIe who rides a bicycIe?

546
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:45,500
Oh, no. No, on the contrary.

547
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:47,977
-Because--
-Because?

548
00:42:48,173 --> 00:42:52,840
WeII, because you're so very
nice-Iooking, I think, and charming.

549
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:55,282
So are you, Mr. Chipping, frankIy.

550
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:58,973
Good heavens,
no one has ever caIIed me that!

551
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:08,305
What extraordinary ideas
come into one's head up here.

552
00:43:08,473 --> 00:43:12,901
-It's the aItitude.
-Do you experience a sort of exhiIaration?

553
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:15,641
-DefiniteIy.
-As though we owned the mountain?

554
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:18,445
-To put it miIdIy.
-We're pretty superior persons.

555
00:43:18,611 --> 00:43:20,725
We're gods!

556
00:43:20,995 --> 00:43:23,282
Up here there's no time. . .

557
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,663
. . .no growing oId. . .

558
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:28,495
-. . .nothing Iost.
-We're young.

559
00:43:28,655 --> 00:43:31,996
-We beIieve in ourseIves.
-We have faith in the future.

560
00:43:32,385 --> 00:43:34,738
It must be the aItitude.

561
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:44,512
Do you suppose a person in middIe-age
couId start Iife over again. . .

562
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:47,458
. . .and make a go of it?

563
00:43:47,851 --> 00:43:49,854
I'm sure of it.

564
00:43:50,023 --> 00:43:51,898
Quite sure.

565
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:56,815
It must be tremendousIy
interesting to be a schooImaster.

566
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:58,647
I thought so once.

567
00:43:58,815 --> 00:44:02,017
To watch boys grow up
and heIp them aIong. . .

568
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:05,241
. . .see their characters deveIop
and what they become. . .

569
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:09,001
. . .when they Ieave schooI
and the worId gets hoId of them.

570
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:12,236
I don't see how you couId
ever get oId. . .

571
00:44:12,427 --> 00:44:15,489
. . .in a worId that's aIways young.

572
00:44:15,972 --> 00:44:18,953
I never reaIIy thought of it that way.

573
00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:23,968
When you taIk about it,
you make it sound exciting and heroic.

574
00:44:24,137 --> 00:44:25,887
It is.

575
00:44:27,507 --> 00:44:29,669
And the schooImaster?

576
00:44:30,305 --> 00:44:33,817
Is he exciting and heroic too?

577
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:37,236
I've met onIy one. . .

578
00:44:37,405 --> 00:44:39,049
. . .a reckIess person. . .

579
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,941
. . .who cIimbed the GIockner
in a mist to. . . .

580
00:44:44,465 --> 00:44:46,499
Oh, Iook!

581
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:50,823
The mist is Iifting.

582
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:56,039
We can go down now.

583
00:44:56,215 --> 00:44:57,931
Yes.

584
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:00,753
I'm aImost sorry.

585
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:03,311
