1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:40,686
Conway!

3
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:43,361
We can't take more than seven.

4
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:46,744
All right. I'm sorry.
Another plane in a minute.

5
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,652
All right.

6
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,135
Wait, everybody.

7
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:12,346
Plenty of planes are coming.
Have patience, we'll be all right.

8
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,181
- It won't be long!
- Don't worry.

9
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:15,933
Leave everything to my brother.

10
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:18,942
- Yes, sir, 10 passengers aboard.
-10 passengers. Good.

11
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:20,687
Say, get me Shanghai.

12
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,074
- Is Colonel Marsh there?
- Right here, Conway. Go ahead.

13
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:29,077
I need more planes.
I've still about 30 people to get out.

14
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:32,247
- Where are the planes you promised?
- We sent all we could find.

15
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:34,788
They better get here,
or I can't be responsible...

16
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:38,328
- I think I hear motors.
- Wait a minute, they may be here now.

17
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:41,257
George, get down on the field
and guide those planes in.

18
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:43,215
Be sure none of the natives get in.

19
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:44,962
- Hello, Colonel?
- Hello, Conway.

20
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:47,888
- Thanks, and take care of your liver.
- My word!

21
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:55,428
Get ready, everyone. Planes are here.
One at a time. Children first.

22
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:58,357
Where are they? Come stand over here.
Where's the mother?

23
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:01,775
- They're orphans.
- I see. You come here, and you...

24
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:05,563
- What about us, Mr. Conway?
- Wait your turn. Come on, you.

25
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:08,113
Take some of those squealing men
with you first.

26
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,443
They might faint on you. I'll wait.

27
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:15,951
Just as you say. You, madam.
Come through here. Wait on one side.

28
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:22,213
- Don't lose your heads!
- What was that explosion?

29
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:30,088
They've blown up the powerhouse!
The planes can't land without lights.

30
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:34,886
We'll burn the hangar.
That will make light for them.

31
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:52,700
There's going to be a big fire.

32
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:28,732
All right. Go ahead!

33
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:36,071
We go on the next plane.
Bring out any people that are left.

34
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,959
- Hello, Fenner.
- Hello, Conway. Having a little trouble?

35
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,339
Never mind me.
Get this gadget off the ground.

36
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:51,919
- Bob, these are all that are left.
- Quick.

37
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:07,936
You can't leave me here, you blighter!
I'm a British subject.

38
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:12,944
Look out, Bob!

39
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,912
All right, Fenner. Go ahead!

40
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,540
Down on the floor!

41
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:32,297
Go ahead, Fenner!

42
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:38,138
Let's go!

43
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:57,321
I guess we're out of range.

44
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,739
- Everybody all right?
- That was close.

45
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:02,911
I've never been in a situation like this
in my life.

46
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:05,836
- Where do you come from?
- I'm Alexander P. Lovett.

47
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:09,254
- Why aren't you registered?
- It'd serve you right to be left behind.

48
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:12,295
How could I know a war
was going to break out over my head?

49
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:16,051
Right over my head. My word!
Those Chinese were pouncing on me.

50
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,224
I had to get into these ridiculous clothes
in order to escape.

51
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,385
- Where were you hiding?
- Hiding? No.

52
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:24,016
Hunting. I was in the interior
hunting fossils.

53
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:28,055
- This morning I looked up suddenly...
- And a war broke out right over your head!

54
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:32,149
Next time you're in wild country like this,
keep in touch with the British consul.

55
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,733
Very good, Freshie.

56
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:37,076
Put his name on the list
and make out a report later.

57
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,703
I beg your pardon, brother.

58
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:41,741
- What did you say you were hunting?
- Fossils.

59
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,995
- Fossils?
- I'm a palaeontologist.

60
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:47,494
- A what?
- A palaeontologist.

61
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:52,040
I see.

62
00:08:55,512 --> 00:08:58,548
I have here a discovery
that will startle the world.

63
00:08:58,682 --> 00:09:02,596
It's the vertebra from the lumbar
of a Megatherium, found in Asia.

64
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:06,061
- What do you know about that?
- Found in Asia.

65
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,562
When I get home,
I'll probably be knighted for it.

66
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,358
You don't say!

67
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:13,571
- Do you mind if I take a look at it?
- Not at all.

68
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:18,155
Sorry.

69
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:22,788
This is the only thing I was able to save
when those heathens surrounded me.

70
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,748
From this vertebra,
I'll be able to reconstruct...

71
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:32,376
...the entire skeleton...

72
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:35,877
You expect to be knighted
for finding that soup bone?

73
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:41,305
This is the vertebra of a Megatherium
found in Asia.

74
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,391
I remember. You said that before.

75
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:46,976
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted.
He never got beyond the Mesozoic era.

76
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:49,305
- Poor fellow!
- Yes, it just shows...

77
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:52,605
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
Who are you?

78
00:09:52,694 --> 00:09:55,102
- Okay, brother.
- Don't call me "brother. "

79
00:09:55,197 --> 00:09:56,656
Okay, sister.

80
00:09:57,783 --> 00:10:00,238
No offence.

81
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,621
Cigarette?

82
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:12,000
- I say, will you have a cigarette?
- No.

83
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:18,588
You're an American, aren't you?

84
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,798
Go and annoy the rest of your playmates.
Let me alone.

85
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:25,844
Look what I found.
Just what I needed, too.

86
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,100
You.

87
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,559
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating.

88
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,695
Think of it. A cruiser sent to Shanghai
just to take you back to England.

89
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:38,651
You know what it means? Here you are.

90
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:45,321
Don't bother about those cables now.
I want you to drink with me.

91
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:50,492
Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway,
England's new Foreign Secretary.

92
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:52,327
Hooray!

93
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:59,843
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory.
People will point to me and say:

94
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:03,013
"There goes George Conway,
brother of the Foreign Secretary. "

95
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:07,012
- Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
- That's why they're sending for you.

96
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:10,553
With all these foreign entanglements,
it was bound to happen.

97
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:13,399
You can laugh if you want to.
But whom else can they get?

98
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:16,568
Who else in England
is half the fighter and half the diplomat...

99
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:19,400
...who has half your knowledge
of the foreign situation?

100
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,529
They can't stop you now.

101
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:33,788
Hello, Freshie.

102
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:37,966
- Did you make that report out yet?
- Yes, Bob.

103
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:41,511
- Did you say we saved 90 white people?
- Yes.

104
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:45,045
Hooray for us.

105
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:50,935
Did you say that we left 10,000 natives
down there to be annihilated?

106
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:57,523
No, you wouldn't say that.
They don't count.

107
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,895
You'd better try to get some sleep.

108
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:06,614
Just you wait until I'm foreign secretary.

109
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:14,000
Can't you just see me with all those
other shrewd little foreign secretaries?

110
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:18,666
The trick is to see
who can outtalk the other.

111
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:21,379
Everybody wants something for nothing.

112
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:27,384
If you can't get it with smooth talk,
you send your army in.

113
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,184
I'm going to fool them.
I'm not going to have an army.

114
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:36,815
I am going to disband mine.
I'm going to sink my battleships.

115
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:40,688
I'm going to destroy
every piece of warcraft.

116
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:44,313
When the enemy approaches, we'll say:

117
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:47,077
"Come in, gentlemen.
What can we do for you?"

118
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:50,781
So then the poor enemy soldiers
will stop and think.

119
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:54,282
And what will they think?

120
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:58,624
They'll say, "Something's wrong here,
we've been duped!

121
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:00,915
"This is not according to form.

122
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:04,507
"These people seem quite friendly.
Why should we shoot them?"

123
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:07,760
Then they'll lay down their arms.

124
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:11,680
You see how simple the whole thing is?

125
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:17,137
Centuries of tradition
kicked right in the pants.

126
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:24,479
And I'll be slapped straight
into the nearest insane asylum.

127
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:28,240
You'd better not drink anymore.
You're not talking sense.

128
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:32,032
Don't worry, George,
nothing's going to happen.

129
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:34,449
I'll fall right into line.

130
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll be the good little boy
that everybody wants me to be.

131
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,713
I'll be the best little foreign secretary
we've ever had.

132
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,673
Just because I haven't the nerve
to be anything else.

133
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:56,016
- Do try to sleep, Bob.
- Yes. Good thing, sleep.

134
00:13:57,856 --> 00:14:00,394
Ever notice the sunrise in China?

135
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:03,858
You should. It's beautiful.

136
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:57,373
Good morning, Lovey.

137
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:01,996
- I beg your pardon?
- I say, "Good morning, Lovey. "

138
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:04,376
Good morning. Look here, young man.

139
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:08,374
I didn't care for "sister" last night,
and I don't like "Lovey" this morning.

140
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:10,959
- My name is Lovett, Alexander P.
- I see.

141
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,678
- It's a good morning, anyway.
- I'm never conversational before coffee.

142
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:17,174
Wait a minute.

143
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,511
Is it a good morning?

144
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:23,059
We're supposed to be travelling east,
aren't we?

145
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:27,103
- Of course.
- It looks to me as if we're travelling west.

146
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:28,606
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

147
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:30,025
It certainly is.

148
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:32,732
Any child knows how to tell direction.

149
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:36,361
I don't care where the child is,
in the air, on the earth, or in the sea.

150
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:40,369
If you face the rising sun, your right hand
is north, your left hand is south.

151
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:42,535
I get it twisted because I'm left-handed.

152
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:43,873
- Really?
- Yes.

153
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:46,334
Just reverse it. Your left hand is...

154
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:51,009
What difference does it make?
The north is the north.

155
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:55,258
All I know is the sun rises in the east,
and we're going away from it.

156
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,507
Now you're irritating and absurd.

157
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,862
Of course. Boy!
We're travelling in the wrong direction.

158
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,484
- We're going in the wrong direction.
- Couldn't you make less noise?

159
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:19,200
We're going west,
and Shanghai is way east of here.

160
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,697
Quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China.

161
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,784
- It's Fenner.
- He may have lost his way.

162
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:27,044
That's what I told him.
You can't expect him to sail in the dark.

163
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,419
Calm yourself. I'll speak to Fenner.

164
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:34,587
Fenner! I say...

165
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:42,474
- Bob, it isn't Fenner in the cockpit!
- Stop it.

166
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:44,851
The bloke up there looks Chinese
or Mongolian.

167
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,688
We're nowhere near Shanghai.
We're going in the opposite direction.

168
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:52,520
We're over the desert. That's funny.

169
00:17:15,846 --> 00:17:16,877
Charming chap.

170
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:19,130
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.

171
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:23,300
- That's that.
- I wonder what happened to Fenner.

172
00:17:23,395 --> 00:17:25,055
Who is he? How'd he get there?

173
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:27,816
Do you think we stopped last night
and changed pilots?

174
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,936
That's not possible.
If we'd landed, we would've awakened.

175
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:34,231
We never left the air.
I didn't sleep the whole night long.

176
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:37,158
- That fellow got on at Baskul.
- Where's he taking us?

177
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:39,401
He may be a maniac for all we know.

178
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:41,197
What are you going to do?

179
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:44,123
- I'll make him tell us his game.
- What if he refuses?

180
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:46,165
- We'll smash his face in.
- Brilliant!

181
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:49,834
Can anyone here fly a plane?
That's no good.

182
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,580
- I guess we're in for it.
- In for what?

183
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:56,506
I don't know. He must have had
some purpose in taking the plane.

184
00:17:56,595 --> 00:18:00,094
- When he lands, we'll find out.
- You won't do anything till we land?

185
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:02,755
- What do you suggest?
- Why, you...

186
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,010
- He may dash us to pieces.
- It might afford you a great deal of relief.

187
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:10,854
I am going back to sleep.
I was having such a peaceful dream.

188
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,151
As soon as he lands, let me know.

189
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:25,161
We're heading down! We're going to land.

190
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:31,793
We're coming to a village.

191
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:15,085
- What are these people?
- I don't know. I can't get their dialect.

192
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:29,395
They're loading up with gasoline.

193
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:16,651
Imagine having that fuel there,
waiting for us!

194
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:21,570
Something tells me our journey
is just beginning.

195
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:23,651
Where are we going?

196
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:29,328
If you ask me, we're heading straight
for those mountains.

197
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:42,295
Douglas plane from Baskul with Conway
and four others aboard still missing.

198
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:44,177
Unreported between here and Baskul.

199
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:03,983
Make it very emphatic
that His Majesty's government...

200
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:08,238
...will hold the Chinese government
and all governors of Chinese provinces...

201
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:11,246
...responsible for the complete safety
of Robert Conway.

202
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:12,873
Good morning, gentlemen.

203
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,951
- No news yet, sir?
- It's fantastic.

204
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:19,789
The plane couldn't disappear into thin air.
Cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai.

205
00:21:20,257 --> 00:21:22,664
Leave no stone unturned to find Conway.

206
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:24,046
- Robertson?
- Yes, sir.

207
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:27,587
Postpone the Far East conference.
We can't meet those nations...

208
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:29,140
...without Conway.

209
00:21:50,996 --> 00:21:52,656
This can't be kidnapping.

210
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:56,532
They wouldn't be taking us so far
on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it.

211
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:59,296
What do you make of it, Bob?
You must have some idea.

212
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:00,577
I give it up.

213
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:04,424
Not knowing where you're going
is exciting anyway.

214
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:07,596
Mr. Conway, for a man who's supposed
to be a leader...

215
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,349
...your do-nothing attitude
is very disappointing.

216
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,590
- What do you want him to do?
- I don't know.

217
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:15,389
I'm a palaeontologist,
not a foreign secretary.

218
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:05,315
- George, come on.
- It's not knowing that's so awful.

219
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:10,354
Not knowing where you're going, why,
or what's waiting when you get there.

220
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:24,581
We got above that storm.

221
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,054
I can't stand it any longer! Take us down!

222
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,361
I can't stand the pain any longer.

223
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:50,105
Let me out of here!

224
00:23:50,198 --> 00:23:55,110
I can't stand it any longer!
Let me out of here!

225
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:12,376
It's oxygen.

226
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:23,184
- Take this in your teeth.
- Let me alone.

227
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:26,974
Come on. That's right. Bite on that.

228
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:01,682
What's that?

229
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:08,146
- What's happening?
- He must have run out of fuel.

230
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:14,487
Look! Look down there!

231
00:25:22,624 --> 00:25:25,115
George! Everybody!
Better get back towards the tail.

232
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,417
He may nose her over. Into the corner!

233
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,086
Quick, George! Cushions! Blankets!
Take that behind you.

234
00:26:03,624 --> 00:26:05,450
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

235
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,040
- He's fainted?
- Looks like it. You smell those fumes?

236
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,458
Here, George, take the gun.

237
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:02,712
Hold the light.
I'll search him before he comes to.

238
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:05,050
We might find something interesting.

239
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:09,349
There's a map.

240
00:27:16,822 --> 00:27:19,527
- He's dead.
- Dead?

241
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:22,864
It must have happened
when he hit the ground.

242
00:27:22,953 --> 00:27:24,945
Let's take a look at this map.

243
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:30,914
What is it?

244
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:32,461
- See that spot?
- Yes.

245
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:35,335
That's where we were this morning.
He had it marked.

246
00:27:35,424 --> 00:27:37,333
Right on the border of Tibet.

247
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:40,754
Here's where civilisation ends.
We must be 1,000 miles beyond it.

248
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:42,554
Just a blank on the map.

249
00:27:44,391 --> 00:27:47,974
- What does it mean?
- It means we're in unexplored country.

250
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:49,971
Country nobody ever reached.

251
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:52,812
Conway! What's happening?

252
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:56,986
Our chances of getting out of this are slim,
but it's up to us.

253
00:27:57,112 --> 00:28:00,066
We can't have three hysterical people
on our hands.

254
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,454
- What do you say?
- Everything's all right.

255
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:09,326
The pilot won't trouble us anymore.
He's dead.

256
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,788
- Dead?
- Probably a heart attack.

257
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:16,129
What are we going to do?

258
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:21,257
Nothing until the morning. The storm
will probably die down before then.

259
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,880
My suggestion is that we better all try
and get a good night's rest.

260
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:30,676
Why not tell them the truth.
We're a million miles from civilisation...

261
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:33,096
...without a chance
of getting out of here alive?

262
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,060
It's slow starvation.
It's slow horrible death.

263
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:50,241
That's perfect. Just perfect.

264
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,704
What a kick I'm going to get out of this.

265
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:57,828
A year ago, a doctor gave me six months
to live. That was a year ago.

266
00:28:57,923 --> 00:29:02,466
I'm already six months to the good.
I'm on velvet. I haven't got a thing to lose.

267
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:06,421
But, you, the noble animals
of the human race...

268
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:10,223
...what a kick I'll get out of watching you
squirm for a change.

269
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,508
What a kick!

270
00:29:26,743 --> 00:29:28,653
They've been gone for hours.

271
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:32,362
Left us here to rot.
That's what they've done.

272
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:37,119
- Heroes of the newspapers.
- All right. Keep quiet.

273
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:41,126
Here they come.

274
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:52,926
Hello, everybody. We found some food.
No chance of starving now.

275
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,771
- What is that?
- Mountain grass. It's good. Have some.

276
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:58,810
I've read of people lasting 30 days
on this stuff.

277
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:03,191
My brother and I have worked out a plan.

278
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,565
If we use our heads we'll keep alive
for weeks, till he gets back.

279
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:08,236
- Gets back?
- Where's he gone?

280
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:11,031
He's starting out right away
in the direction of India.

281
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:14,620
Sooner or later, he's bound
to run into a tribe or something.

282
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,501
Here's the idea.
We found a cave over that small hill.

283
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:20,753
As soon as we bury the pilot,
we'll move in. We can have a fire.

284
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,544
I shouldn't be surprised
to see Bob back within a week.

285
00:30:23,634 --> 00:30:27,797
You haven't a Chinaman's chance
of getting out of here alive. You know it.

286
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:30,842
- Cave? Where?
- Over by that hill.

287
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:38,727
Hey, look! Look, Bob!

288
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:49,523
- Where are they? Do you see them?
- Yes.

289
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:51,657
Do you think they're cannibals?

290
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:19,511
I am from the nearby lamasery.
My name is Chang.

291
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:21,516
He's speaking English.

292
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:25,315
- And mine's Conway.
- How do you do?

293
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:28,155
You've no idea how unexpected
and very welcome you are.

294
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,027
My friends and l,
and the lady in the plane...

295
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:33,609
...left Baskul the night before last
for Shanghai.

296
00:31:33,704 --> 00:31:36,159
But we were travelling
in the opposite direction.

297
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:38,157
At the mercy of a mad pilot.

298
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:42,539
- We'd be eternally grateful if you...
- Where is your "mad" pilot?

299
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:45,500
He must have had a heart attack,
or perhaps the fumes.

300
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:47,382
When the plane landed he was dead.

301
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,793
We were going to bury him
when you came along.

302
00:31:49,886 --> 00:31:51,001
Pardon me.

303
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:57,261
If you will be good enough
to direct us to your lamasery...

304
00:31:57,352 --> 00:32:00,270
It is an honour to accompany you
and your friends.

305
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:08,655
You'll need suitable clothes for the journey.

306
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:14,066
- It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
- Thank you.

307
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:46,436
Welcome to Shangri-La.

308
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:50,815
You see we are sheltered
by mountains on every side.

309
00:34:50,984 --> 00:34:53,985
A strange phenomenon
for which we are very grateful.

310
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:09,371
It's magical.

311
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,170
- I definitely do not like this place.
- Will you quit squawking?

312
00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:30,717
- Look at what they gave me to wear.
- You never looked better.

313
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:34,855
As soon as our clothes are cleaned,
they'll give them back to us, Lovey.

314
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:41,901
Something tells me this means food.
Come on.

315
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:55,790
I just feel as though I'm being made ready
for the executioner.

316
00:37:56,044 --> 00:37:59,378
If this be execution, lead me to it.

317
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:05,376
That's what they do with cattle
just before the slaughter. Fatten them.

318
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:09,717
- You're a scream, Lovey.
- Please don't call me "Lovey. "

319
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:11,434
That was refreshing.

320
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:16,388
The food looks good.
Some layout they got here.

321
00:38:16,481 --> 00:38:19,055
You see the rooms?
Couldn't do better at the Ritz.

322
00:38:19,151 --> 00:38:21,393
All the conveniences for the condemned.

323
00:38:21,486 --> 00:38:26,314
- Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
- I don't like this place. It's too mysterious.

324
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,153
It's better than freezing to death
down below, isn't it?

325
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,375
Is there something I can do for you?

326
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:48,423
- What do you want?
- I've ordered you some warm broth.

327
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:50,423
- I thought perhaps...
- Get out of here!

328
00:38:50,515 --> 00:38:53,185
If any of you men think
you can come busting in here...

329
00:38:53,268 --> 00:38:54,264
Please.

330
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:59,016
Please calm yourself.
You'll soon be well if you do.

331
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,937
I don't need any advice from you.
Get me a doctor.

332
00:39:02,027 --> 00:39:04,981
- I'm sorry, we have no doctors here.
- No doctors.

333
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:07,479
Well, that's just fine.

334
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:11,069
- Please let me help you.
- You can help me jump over that cliff.

335
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:13,734
I've been looking at the bottom
of that mountain...

336
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,906
...but I haven't got the nerve to jump.

337
00:39:16,124 --> 00:39:19,328
You shouldn't be looking
at the bottom of the mountain.

338
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:22,462
Why don't you try looking up
at the top sometime?

339
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:29,053
Don't preach that cheap, second-hand stuff
to me.

340
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:30,460
Go on, beat it!

341
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:33,297
Beat it!

342
00:39:35,143 --> 00:39:37,053
Peace be with you, my child.

343
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:51,154
Good evening, my friends.

344
00:39:51,243 --> 00:39:53,366
Please sit down.

345
00:39:54,204 --> 00:39:57,075
- I hope you found everything satisfactory.
- Swell.

346
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:58,280
Excellent.

347
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:03,042
- You shouldn't have waited for me.
- Where's the girl? Miss Stone.

348
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:06,084
She's remaining in her room.
She isn't feeling very well.

349
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:08,962
Please go on without me. I eat very little.

350
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:29,686
There's certainly nothing wrong
with that meal.

351
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:30,896
Thank you.

352
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:34,117
- And the wine is excellent.
- I'm glad you like it.

353
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:36,451
It's made right here in the valley.

354
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:39,290
Now that dinner is over,
we're very anxious...

355
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:42,494
...to discuss ways and means
of getting back home.

356
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:47,082
First, we want to cable the Foreign Office.
England's waiting for news of my brother.

357
00:40:47,174 --> 00:40:49,925
There's a cruiser at Shanghai
to take him back.

358
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:52,173
Really?

359
00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:56,261
As regards cabling, I'm afraid I can't help.

360
00:40:57,184 --> 00:40:59,591
Unfortunately we have no wireless here.

361
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:04,189
As a matter of fact, we have no means
of communication with the outside world.

362
00:41:04,316 --> 00:41:07,767
- Not even a radio?
- It's been a source of deep regret...

363
00:41:07,986 --> 00:41:11,936
...but the mountains surrounding us
have made reception almost impossible.

364
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:15,068
We'd better make arrangements
to get some porters immediately.

365
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,318
Some means to get us back to civilisation.

366
00:41:17,412 --> 00:41:21,659
- Are you so certain you are away from it?
- As far away as I ever want to be.

367
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:26,785
The porters will be very well paid.
That is, within reason.

368
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,047
I'm afraid that wouldn't help.
We have no porters here.

369
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:31,290
No porters here?

370
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:33,543
What about those men
we met this morning?

371
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:35,428
Those are our own people.

372
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,890
They never venture beyond
where you were met this morning.

373
00:41:38,976 --> 00:41:40,553
It's much too hazardous.

374
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:44,179
How do you account for all this?
Who brought it in?

375
00:41:46,024 --> 00:41:50,520
There is a tribe of porters
some 500 miles from here.

376
00:41:50,862 --> 00:41:53,863
That is our only contact
with the outside world.

377
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:59,741
Every now and again, depending upon
favourable weather, they make the journey.

378
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:04,909
- How can we get in touch with them?
- In that respect you are very fortunate.

379
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:08,750
We are expecting a shipment from them
almost any time now.

380
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,336
What do you mean
by "almost any time now"?

381
00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:17,847
We've been expecting this particular
shipment for the past two years.

382
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:19,807
- Two years?
- Yes.

383
00:42:23,145 --> 00:42:24,176
Well...

384
00:42:28,066 --> 00:42:31,731
But I assure you, gentlemen,
if there is a prolonged delay...

385
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:36,277
...Shangri-La will endeavour
to make your stay as pleasant as possible.

386
00:42:39,244 --> 00:42:42,660
And now, if you will excuse me,
it is getting late.

387
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:45,700
I do hope you all sleep well.

388
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:47,950
Good night.

389
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:55,759
Good night, Mr. Conway.

390
00:42:58,347 --> 00:42:59,722
Good night, sir.

391
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:09,272
That's what I mean, mysterious.
I don't like that man. He's too vague.

392
00:43:09,816 --> 00:43:12,770
We didn't get much information
out of him, did we?

393
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:16,859
It seems we should be grateful.
We were in a bad mess this morning.

394
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:19,025
After all, this is quite pleasant.

395
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:22,284
Why not make ourselves comfortable
until the porters do arrive?

396
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:23,651
That's what I say.

397
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:25,538
What do you say to a rubber of bridge?

398
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:29,159
- I saw some cards in the other room.
- Not for me, thanks. I'm too weary.

399
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:31,375
How about you, Lovey? Come on.

400
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:35,505
Let's you and I play a game
of honeymoon bridge.

401
00:43:37,386 --> 00:43:39,010
- I'm thinking.
- Thinking?

402
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:42,678
- What about some double solitaire?
- In fact, I'm very good at it.

403
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:44,046
- No kidding?
- Yes.

404
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:46,349
Then I'm your man. Come on, Toots.

405
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:13,331
- Hello, George. Cigarette?
- Thanks.

406
00:44:16,216 --> 00:44:19,419
I suppose all this comes
under the heading of adventure.

407
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,722
There's been plenty of it
in the last few days.

408
00:44:26,226 --> 00:44:28,634
It's far from over from what I can see.

409
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:31,561
This place gives me the creeps.

410
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:34,649
Hidden away like this,
no contact with civilisation.

411
00:44:35,777 --> 00:44:38,103
You don't seem concerned at all.

412
00:44:38,488 --> 00:44:41,940
I'm feeling far too peaceful
to be concerned about anything.

413
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:44,651
I think I'm going to like it here.

414
00:44:45,746 --> 00:44:47,904
You talk as if you intend on staying.

415
00:44:48,457 --> 00:44:51,162
Something happened to me
when we arrived here that...

416
00:44:53,962 --> 00:44:57,960
Did you ever go to a strange place
and feel sure you'd been there before?

417
00:44:58,216 --> 00:45:01,383
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

418
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:04,012
You're a strange bird.

419
00:45:04,848 --> 00:45:06,473
No wonder Gainsford calls you:

420
00:45:06,558 --> 00:45:09,595
"The man who always wanted to see
the other side of the hill. "

421
00:45:09,686 --> 00:45:12,224
Do you ever want to see
what's on the other side?

422
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:14,764
What else could there be,
except another hill?

423
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:16,851
In any event, I'm not curious.

424
00:45:18,236 --> 00:45:21,570
It seems to me we should be concerned
about getting home.

425
00:45:22,824 --> 00:45:26,656
- I'd give anything to be in London now.
- Of course you would.

426
00:45:27,454 --> 00:45:31,701
If ever we get out of this place, you should
take that job with Helen's father.

427
00:45:31,792 --> 00:45:33,167
What do you mean, "lf"?

428
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:35,410
- Did I say, "lf"?
- That's what you said.

429
00:45:35,504 --> 00:45:36,535
Well, I mean...

430
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:40,544
You talk as though we're going
to have trouble getting out of here.

431
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:42,753
I've been putting things together.

432
00:45:42,844 --> 00:45:46,759
Do you notice the resemblance
between those natives and the pilot?

433
00:45:46,932 --> 00:45:50,597
Why did those clothes materialise
so conveniently when they met us?

434
00:45:50,686 --> 00:45:54,386
Chang himself just said
that they never venture beyond that point.

435
00:45:54,606 --> 00:45:57,097
What brought them there,
unless it was to meet us?

436
00:45:57,192 --> 00:45:59,813
Chang's first question was about the pilot.

437
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,856
There must be some connection
between the plane and this place.

438
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:06,487
They must have deliberately
brought us here.

439
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:10,277
What reason could they have
for doing a thing like that?

440
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:13,041
That's what's on the other side of the hill.

441
00:46:23,051 --> 00:46:27,001
It's 3,000 feet practically straight down
to the floor of the valley.

442
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:30,887
The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it.

443
00:46:30,976 --> 00:46:35,104
There are over 2,000 people in the valley
besides those here in Shangri-La.

444
00:46:35,188 --> 00:46:37,858
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?

445
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:39,812
Goodness, no.

446
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:41,312
- So there are others?
- Yes.

447
00:46:41,403 --> 00:46:44,439
- Who, for instance?
- In time you will meet them all.

448
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:49,316
For a man who talks a lot, it's amazing
how unenlightening you can be.

449
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:53,361
There are some things, my dear Conway,
I deeply regret I may not discuss.

450
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:56,623
That's the fourth time you've said that.
You should record it.

451
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:59,711
Let's go inside.
I'd like to show you our rare treasures.

452
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:28,398
- Good afternoon.
- Excuse me, l...

453
00:47:28,617 --> 00:47:30,823
Please, don't go.

454
00:47:32,454 --> 00:47:34,411
Tea will be served any moment.

455
00:47:34,873 --> 00:47:36,367
Won't you come in?

456
00:47:40,587 --> 00:47:42,247
My name is Maria.

457
00:47:43,674 --> 00:47:45,132
Won't you sit down?

458
00:48:00,816 --> 00:48:03,485
By the way,
what religion do you follow here?

459
00:48:03,652 --> 00:48:07,697
To put it simply, I should say
that our general belief was in moderation.

460
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:11,947
We preach the virtue
of avoiding excesses of every kind.

461
00:48:12,995 --> 00:48:15,865
Even including excess of virtue itself.

462
00:48:15,956 --> 00:48:17,119
That's intelligent.

463
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:20,327
In the valley, it makes for better happiness
among the natives.

464
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:22,992
We rule with moderate strictness...

465
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,296
...and in return, we are satisfied
with moderate obedience.

466
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:31,551
As a result, our people are
moderately honest, moderately chaste...

467
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,932
...and somewhat more
than moderately happy.

468
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:39,510
How about law and order?
You have no soldiers or police?

469
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:41,184
Good heavens, no!

470
00:48:41,273 --> 00:48:44,025
How do you deal
with incorrigibles, criminals?

471
00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:45,852
We have no crime here.

472
00:48:46,862 --> 00:48:48,486
What makes a criminal?

473
00:48:48,947 --> 00:48:52,945
Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy.

474
00:48:53,744 --> 00:48:57,528
The desire to possess
something owned by another.

475
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:02,200
There can be no crime
when there is a sufficiency of everything.

476
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:05,121
You have no disputes over women?

477
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,042
Only very rarely.

478
00:49:09,051 --> 00:49:13,547
It wouldn't be considered good manners
to take a woman that another man wanted.

479
00:49:14,097 --> 00:49:17,383
Suppose he wanted her so badly
that he didn't give a hang...

480
00:49:17,476 --> 00:49:19,634
...if it was good manners or not.

481
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:24,179
In that event, it would be good manners
on the part of the other man...

482
00:49:24,274 --> 00:49:25,982
...to let him have her.

483
00:49:27,402 --> 00:49:29,940
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.

484
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:33,031
You'd be surprised
how a little courtesy all around...

485
00:49:33,116 --> 00:49:36,201
...helps to smooth out
the most complicated problems.

486
00:49:56,181 --> 00:50:00,095
At some time in the future
you will have the pleasure of meeting her.

487
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:08,017
Some man had better get ready
to be very courteous to me.

488
00:50:17,286 --> 00:50:20,737
Mr. Chang, all these things,
books, instruments, sculpture...

489
00:50:20,956 --> 00:50:24,325
...were they all brought in
over those mountains by porters?

490
00:50:24,418 --> 00:50:25,497
They were.

491
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:27,662
- That must have taken...
- Centuries.

492
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:29,953
Centuries.

493
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:34,299
Where did you get the money
to pay for all these treasures?

494
00:50:34,803 --> 00:50:37,424
We have no money as you know it.

495
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:41,464
We do not buy or sell
or seek personal fortunes...

496
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:45,730
...because there is no uncertain future here
for which to accumulate it.

497
00:50:46,565 --> 00:50:49,317
That would suit me perfectly.
I'm always broke.

498
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,353
How did you pay for them?

499
00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:55,695
Our valley is very rich
in a metal called gold...

500
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:00,115
...which, fortunately for us,
is valued very highly in the outside world.

501
00:51:00,412 --> 00:51:03,863
- So, we merely...
- Buy and sell.

502
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,321
Buy and sell...

503
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,252
Pardon me. Exchange.

504
00:51:10,213 --> 00:51:11,957
I see. Gold for ideas.

505
00:51:13,258 --> 00:51:16,923
There's something so simple
and naive about all this...

506
00:51:17,012 --> 00:51:20,547
...that I suspect there's been
a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere.

507
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:23,558
Whose idea was it? How did it all start?

508
00:51:25,938 --> 00:51:29,104
That, my dear Conway,
is the story of a remarkable man.

509
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,896
Who?

510
00:51:33,153 --> 00:51:36,356
A Belgian priest
by the name of Father Perrault.

511
00:51:38,408 --> 00:51:42,655
The first European to find this place
and a very great man indeed.

512
00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:45,530
He is responsible
for everything you see here.

513
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:48,376
He built Shangri-La, taught the natives...

514
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:51,248
...and began our collection of art.

515
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:54,877
In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.

516
00:51:56,718 --> 00:51:58,296
When was all this?

517
00:51:59,805 --> 00:52:03,933
Way back in 1713, I think it was...

518
00:52:04,685 --> 00:52:08,634
...that Father Perrault stumbled
into the valley, half-frozen to death.

519
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:12,728
It was typical of the man
that one leg being frozen...

520
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:16,483
...and there being no doctors here,
he amputated the leg himself.

521
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:20,274
He amputated his own leg?

522
00:52:21,577 --> 00:52:25,076
Oddly enough, when he had learned
to understand their language...

523
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:28,081
...the natives told him
he could have saved his leg.

524
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:30,242
It would've healed without amputation.

525
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:34,962
- They didn't actually mean that?
- Yes. They were very sincere about it, too.

526
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,091
You see, a perfect body in perfect health
was the rule here.

527
00:52:38,176 --> 00:52:40,169
They've never known anything different.

528
00:52:40,262 --> 00:52:44,390
What was true for them, they thought
would be true for anyone else living here.

529
00:52:44,474 --> 00:52:45,933
Well, is it?

530
00:52:46,935 --> 00:52:49,094
Rather astonishingly so, yes.

531
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:52,640
Particularly in the case
of Father Perrault himself.

532
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:55,687
When he and the natives
had finished building Shangri-La...

533
00:52:55,777 --> 00:52:58,185
...he was 108 years old
and still very active...

534
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,356
...in spite of having only one leg.

535
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:02,864
108 and still active?

536
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:05,114
You're startled.

537
00:53:05,203 --> 00:53:08,323
No, I'm just a little bowled over, that's all.

538
00:53:08,415 --> 00:53:09,578
Forgive me.

539
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:14,328
I should've told you it's quite common here
to live to a very ripe old age.

540
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:17,588
Climate, diet, mountain water,
you might say.

541
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:22,927
But we like to believe it is
the absence of struggle in the way we live.

542
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:27,886
In your countries, on the other hand,
how often do you hear the expression:

543
00:53:28,268 --> 00:53:31,720
"He worried himself to death,"
or, "This thing or that killed him"?

544
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:33,806
- Very often.
- And very true.

545
00:53:34,066 --> 00:53:36,604
Your lives are, therefore, as a rule, shorter.

546
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:41,023
Not so much by natural death,
as by indirect suicide.

547
00:53:41,907 --> 00:53:44,196
That's all very fine if it works out.

548
00:53:44,284 --> 00:53:45,944
A little amazing, of course.

549
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:48,159
You surprise me.

550
00:53:48,538 --> 00:53:50,946
I surprise you! Now, that's news.

551
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,580
I mean your amazement.

552
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:56,753
I could've understood it
in any of your companions, but you...

553
00:53:56,838 --> 00:54:00,539
...who have dreamed
and written so much about better worlds.

554
00:54:00,842 --> 00:54:05,006
Or is it that you fail to recognise
one of your own dreams when you see it?

555
00:54:07,516 --> 00:54:11,383
If you don't mind,
I think I'll go on being amazed...

556
00:54:11,812 --> 00:54:15,477
- ... in moderation, of course.
- Then everything's quite all right?

557
00:54:23,323 --> 00:54:24,568
It's terrific!

558
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:28,244
I just saw something
that'd make your hair stand on end.

559
00:54:28,328 --> 00:54:33,204
You see those hills over there? Gold.
Popping right out of them. Tons of it.

560
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:35,370
You keep this under your hat.

561
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,545
If the others hear about it,
they'll declare themselves in.

562
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:42,414
But if I can mine that stuff,
I'll throw a bombshell into Wall Street.

563
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:45,083
Now look, I've got a plan and if l...

564
00:54:47,306 --> 00:54:48,930
Say, honey...

565
00:54:49,975 --> 00:54:52,300
...you ain't feeling so well, are you?

566
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:57,356
Don't pay attention
to what those doctors tell you.

567
00:54:57,441 --> 00:54:59,433
I've seen a lot of people fool 'em.

568
00:54:59,526 --> 00:55:03,606
And I've got a hunch this place
is gonna be good for you. Honest I have.

569
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:06,945
Come on, you be a good kid
and snap out of it.

570
00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:08,943
And I'll cut you in on the gold deal.

571
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:12,072
I'm going up and make a deal
with Chang right now.

572
00:56:12,891 --> 00:56:14,516
Oh, my!

573
00:56:31,785 --> 00:56:34,241
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Conway.

574
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:36,951
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.

575
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:41,836
- Would you like to take a ride?
- No, thanks. Not just now.

576
00:57:09,531 --> 00:57:11,690
Well, I think I'll take that ride.

577
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:01,717
Fossils! Why? What for?

578
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:04,130
Running around digging up
a lot of old bones.

579
01:01:04,224 --> 01:01:07,510
You didn't dig yourself
out of one of those holes by any chance?

580
01:01:14,568 --> 01:01:16,560
You seem gay. Did you find out anything?

581
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:20,485
I heard that if you want a man's wife,
she's yours if he's got any manners.

582
01:01:20,574 --> 01:01:22,697
- Nothing about the porters yet?
- Porters?

583
01:01:22,784 --> 01:01:25,785
We've been here two weeks
and we haven't found out a thing.

584
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:28,907
Well, we haven't been murdered
in our beds yet, have we?

585
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:31,324
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.

586
01:01:31,418 --> 01:01:35,036
Guess we'll never know why we're here
or how long we'll be held prisoners.

587
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:37,913
Hurry up, you slowpokes. I'm starved.

588
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:40,713
"Please, do not wait for me.

589
01:01:41,178 --> 01:01:42,886
"I eat so very little. "

590
01:01:47,142 --> 01:01:48,969
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

591
01:01:49,061 --> 01:01:51,516
I'm glad to see us all finally organised.

592
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:54,440
Okay, handsome.
Dish it out and make it snappy.

593
01:01:55,984 --> 01:01:58,356
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing. Why?

594
01:01:58,570 --> 01:01:59,733
You look beautiful.

595
01:01:59,821 --> 01:02:02,312
That's unkind.
Miss Stone always looks beautiful.

596
01:02:02,407 --> 01:02:05,112
I got it. It's your make-up.
You've got none on.

597
01:02:05,202 --> 01:02:08,238
Honey, you look a million percent better.

598
01:02:08,413 --> 01:02:10,073
Wholesome, kind of, and clean.

599
01:02:10,165 --> 01:02:13,451
Take a tip from me,
don't ever put that stuff on your face again.

600
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:15,785
It's like hiding behind a mask.

601
01:02:16,213 --> 01:02:18,538
Who're you to talk about a mask?
What do you mean?

602
01:02:18,632 --> 01:02:21,087
You've been wearing a mask
ever since we met you.

603
01:02:21,343 --> 01:02:22,292
Have I?

604
01:02:22,386 --> 01:02:25,055
Strange, you've never told us anything
about yourself.

605
01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:28,092
Who are you, anyway?
Why not take your mask off for once?

606
01:02:28,183 --> 01:02:30,259
Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.

607
01:02:31,103 --> 01:02:32,645
All right, I will.

608
01:02:34,398 --> 01:02:36,022
I'll let my hair down.

609
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:37,646
Why not?

610
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:40,106
It can't make any real difference now.

611
01:02:40,696 --> 01:02:41,691
Lovey...

612
01:02:43,198 --> 01:02:46,116
- ... were you ever chased by the police?
- Certainly not!

613
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:47,660
Believe me, it's no fun.

614
01:02:47,744 --> 01:02:50,911
When you picked me up at Baskul,
they were on my tail for a year.

615
01:02:50,998 --> 01:02:52,112
The police?

616
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:57,746
Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?

617
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,912
Chalmers Bryant?

618
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:03,458
Bryant Utilities. That's me.

619
01:03:03,677 --> 01:03:05,052
I knew it.

620
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:09,012
I knew I had a reason for hating you.
Sir, you're a thief!

621
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:10,973
He never stole from you, did he?

622
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:14,096
I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities
I bought with money...

623
01:03:14,187 --> 01:03:18,731
...l'd saved for 20 years, teaching school.
Now, I couldn't sell it for postage stamps.

624
01:03:18,817 --> 01:03:21,106
That's too bad. I got a half million shares.

625
01:03:21,194 --> 01:03:23,567
My whole foundation. Now look at me.

626
01:03:23,655 --> 01:03:26,740
The nerve you have sitting there,
talking about it so calmly.

627
01:03:26,825 --> 01:03:29,150
The swindler of thousands of people.

628
01:03:29,536 --> 01:03:32,110
That's what makes
the whole thing so funny.

629
01:03:32,372 --> 01:03:35,326
A guy like me,
starts out in life as a plumber.

630
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:38,033
An ordinary, everyday
slew-footed plumber.

631
01:03:38,128 --> 01:03:41,627
And by the use of a little brains,
he builds up a gigantic institution.

632
01:03:41,715 --> 01:03:45,049
Employs thousands of people.
Becomes a great civic leader.

633
01:03:45,344 --> 01:03:46,754
Then the crash comes.

634
01:03:46,845 --> 01:03:49,881
Overnight, he's the biggest crook
the country ever had.

635
01:03:49,973 --> 01:03:51,717
You're a thief and a swindler...

636
01:03:51,808 --> 01:03:55,260
...and I'll be glad to turn you over
to the police when we get back.

637
01:03:55,354 --> 01:03:56,516
"When we get back! "

638
01:03:56,605 --> 01:03:58,763
What makes you think we'll ever get back?

639
01:03:58,857 --> 01:04:00,232
You're all prisoners here.

640
01:04:00,317 --> 01:04:03,234
We were kidnapped and brought here
and nobody knows why.

641
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,903
I don't want to be a prisoner.
I'm finding out when we're leaving here.

642
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:09,825
I'll make that Chinese talk
if it's the last thing I do.

643
01:04:14,248 --> 01:04:15,991
Where's Chang?

644
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:18,289
Where's Chang or I'll blow your brains out?

645
01:04:18,377 --> 01:04:21,164
- What do you think you're doing?
- Let me go.

646
01:04:21,255 --> 01:04:22,713
Come here!

647
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:27,876
Come here, you!

648
01:04:30,889 --> 01:04:32,514
You idiot!

649
01:04:39,022 --> 01:04:40,600
Had to sock him?

650
01:04:55,914 --> 01:04:57,658
- Let me up.
- You all right?

651
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,792
Sorry.

652
01:05:01,128 --> 01:05:04,082
Is it true about us being kidnapped?

653
01:05:06,216 --> 01:05:09,217
I say, is it true about us being kidnapped?

654
01:05:15,058 --> 01:05:16,303
Mr. Chang!

655
01:05:18,145 --> 01:05:20,683
Do you mind stepping in here
for a moment?

656
01:05:30,157 --> 01:05:31,900
Won't you sit down?

657
01:05:37,372 --> 01:05:40,658
You have been very kind to us
and we appreciate it.

658
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:43,420
But for some reason
we're being held prisoners here...

659
01:05:43,503 --> 01:05:45,128
...and we want to know why.

660
01:05:45,213 --> 01:05:48,665
Personally, I don't mind at all.
I'm enjoying every minute of it.

661
01:05:48,759 --> 01:05:52,293
But my brother is not of the same opinion,
nor are the others.

662
01:05:52,638 --> 01:05:55,211
It's time we were told what it's all about.

663
01:05:55,474 --> 01:05:59,009
We want to know why we were kidnapped,
why we're being kept here...

664
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:02,721
...but most important of all,
do we get the porters and when?

665
01:06:05,025 --> 01:06:07,646
Until we get this information...

666
01:06:08,195 --> 01:06:11,860
...l'm very much afraid
we cannot permit you to leave this room.

667
01:06:12,282 --> 01:06:15,236
You know, it's very strange...

668
01:06:15,535 --> 01:06:20,363
...but when you saw me in the corridor,
I was actually on my way to you.

669
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:23,324
I bring the most amazing news.

670
01:06:29,424 --> 01:06:32,094
The High Lama wishes to see you.

671
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:35,879
- The High Lama? Who in blazes is he?
- I thought you ran this joint.

672
01:06:35,973 --> 01:06:39,176
High lamas or low lamas,
do we get the porters?

673
01:06:39,268 --> 01:06:42,968
The High Lama is the only one
from whom any information can come.

674
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:46,147
- Don't believe him.
- Sounds like a stall to me.

675
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:48,024
- Better have him talk...
- One moment.

676
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:51,479
You say the High Lama's the only one
who can give us information?

677
01:06:51,571 --> 01:06:52,816
The only one.

678
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,992
And he can arrange
for the porters to take us back?

679
01:06:56,076 --> 01:06:58,781
The High Lama arranges everything.

680
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:02,037
Then he's the man I want to see.
Will you come along?

681
01:07:07,671 --> 01:07:11,419
Better wait here until I get back.
We'll soon know where we stand.

682
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:45,574
Good evening.

683
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,252
Please, come in.

684
01:08:05,187 --> 01:08:06,930
Sit here, near me.

685
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:11,107
I'm an old man
and can do no one any harm.

686
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:13,360
Are you the High Lama?

687
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:14,685
Yes.

688
01:08:15,405 --> 01:08:19,237
I trust you've been comfortable
at Shangri-La, since your arrival.

689
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:22,327
Personally, I've enjoyed
your community very much.

690
01:08:22,579 --> 01:08:25,070
But my friends do not care
for this mystery.

691
01:08:25,165 --> 01:08:27,952
They are determined to leave as soon as...

692
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:41,717
It's astonishing and incredible, but...

693
01:08:42,057 --> 01:08:43,800
What is it, my son?

694
01:08:44,059 --> 01:08:45,387
You're the man.

695
01:08:45,936 --> 01:08:48,427
Chang told me. You're the first who...

696
01:08:49,398 --> 01:08:51,639
Two hundred years ago.

697
01:08:53,986 --> 01:08:56,607
You're still alive, Father Perrault.

698
01:09:05,956 --> 01:09:08,162
Sit down, my son.

699
01:09:16,717 --> 01:09:20,666
You may not know it,
but I've been an admirer of yours...

700
01:09:21,346 --> 01:09:23,505
...for a great many years.

701
01:09:24,141 --> 01:09:27,557
Not of Conway,
the empire builder and public hero.

702
01:09:28,437 --> 01:09:33,478
I wanted to meet the Conway
who in one of his books said:

703
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:40,777
"There are moments in every man's life
when he glimpses the eternal. "

704
01:09:43,744 --> 01:09:47,160
That Conway seemed to belong here.

705
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:52,456
In fact, it was suggested
that someone be sent to bring him here.

706
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:56,171
That I be brought here?
Who had that brilliant idea?

707
01:09:56,465 --> 01:09:57,959
Sondra Bizet.

708
01:09:59,009 --> 01:10:00,883
The girl at the piano?

709
01:10:01,386 --> 01:10:07,389
Yes. She has read your books
and has a profound admiration for you.

710
01:10:08,602 --> 01:10:10,179
As have we all.

711
01:10:10,646 --> 01:10:14,145
Of course, I've suspected
that our being here was no accident.

712
01:10:14,983 --> 01:10:17,901
Furthermore, I have a feeling
we're never supposed to leave.

713
01:10:17,986 --> 01:10:20,560
But that, for the moment,
doesn't concern me greatly.

714
01:10:20,656 --> 01:10:22,613
I'll meet that when it comes.

715
01:10:23,116 --> 01:10:26,865
What particularly interests me at present
is why was I brought here?

716
01:10:26,954 --> 01:10:30,786
What possible use can I be
to an already thriving community?

717
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,248
We need men like you here...

718
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:36,834
...to be sure that our community
will continue to thrive.

719
01:10:37,714 --> 01:10:42,293
In return for which
Shangri-La has much to give you.

720
01:10:43,095 --> 01:10:47,424
You are still, by the world's standards,
a youngish man.

721
01:10:48,392 --> 01:10:50,883
Yet in the normal course of existence...

722
01:10:51,186 --> 01:10:55,563
...you can expect 20 or 30 years...

723
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:59,850
...of gradually diminishing activity.

724
01:11:02,072 --> 01:11:04,824
Here, however, in Shangri-La...

725
01:11:05,534 --> 01:11:11,239
...by our standards,
your life has just begun.

726
01:11:12,082 --> 01:11:15,416
And may go on and on.

727
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:25,133
To be candid, Father,
a prolonged future doesn't excite me.

728
01:11:25,762 --> 01:11:27,387
It would have to have a point.

729
01:11:27,472 --> 01:11:30,260
I sometimes doubted
whether life itself has any.

730
01:11:30,809 --> 01:11:34,641
If that is so,
then long life must be even more pointless.

731
01:11:34,938 --> 01:11:39,730
I'd need a much more definite reason
for going on and on.

732
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:42,313
We have reason.

733
01:11:42,946 --> 01:11:47,525
It is the entire meaning
and purpose of Shangri-La.

734
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,781
It came to me in a vision...

735
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,038
...long ago.

736
01:11:56,126 --> 01:11:59,293
I saw all the nations strengthening...

737
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:04,790
...not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions
and the will to destroy.

738
01:12:06,094 --> 01:12:08,550
I saw their machine power multiplying...

739
01:12:09,014 --> 01:12:14,637
...until a single-weaponed man
might match a whole army.

740
01:12:16,855 --> 01:12:21,647
I foresaw a time when man,
exulting in the technique of murder...

741
01:12:22,194 --> 01:12:24,863
...would rage so hotly over the world...

742
01:12:25,572 --> 01:12:32,535
...that every book, every treasure
would be doomed to destruction.

743
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:38,292
This vision was so vivid and so moving...

744
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:44,082
...that I determined to gather together
all things of beauty...

745
01:12:44,383 --> 01:12:49,009
...and culture that I could
and preserve them here...

746
01:12:50,138 --> 01:12:54,302
...against the doom
toward which the world is rushing.

747
01:12:55,477 --> 01:12:57,517
Look at the world today.

748
01:12:58,438 --> 01:13:00,811
Is there anything more pitiful?

749
01:13:02,025 --> 01:13:07,364
What madness there is, what blindness,
what unintelligent leadership.

750
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:13,984
A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity
crashing headlong against each other...

751
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:20,702
...compelled by an orgy
of greed and brutality.

752
01:13:25,048 --> 01:13:27,586
The time must come, my friend...

753
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,631
...when this orgy will spend itself.

754
01:13:32,222 --> 01:13:35,223
When brutality and the lust for power...

755
01:13:36,643 --> 01:13:40,095
...must perish by its own sword.

756
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:49,654
Against that time is why I avoided death
and am here...

757
01:13:51,575 --> 01:13:53,900
...and why you were brought here.

758
01:13:55,996 --> 01:14:03,126
For when that day comes,
the world must begin to look for a new life.

759
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:09,342
And it is our hope
that they may find it here.

760
01:14:10,552 --> 01:14:14,420
For here, we shall be with their books...

761
01:14:15,515 --> 01:14:20,012
...and their music and the way of life...

762
01:14:21,104 --> 01:14:25,897
...based on one simple rule:

763
01:14:27,653 --> 01:14:29,313
Be kind.

764
01:14:32,824 --> 01:14:34,651
When that day comes...

765
01:14:35,244 --> 01:14:39,952
...it is our hope
that the brotherly love of Shangri-La...

766
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:44,539
...will spread throughout the world.

767
01:14:50,342 --> 01:14:56,297
Yes, my son, when the strong
have devoured each other...

768
01:14:57,808 --> 01:15:02,553
...the Christian ethic
may at last be fulfilled...

769
01:15:03,981 --> 01:15:08,559
...and the meek shall inherit the earth.

770
01:15:11,822 --> 01:15:13,898
I understand you, Father.

771
01:15:22,874 --> 01:15:25,116
You must come again, my son.

772
01:15:30,007 --> 01:15:31,417
Good night.

773
01:15:59,036 --> 01:15:59,901
Well?

774
01:16:17,596 --> 01:16:20,716
- What did you find out?
- We thought you were never coming back.

775
01:16:20,807 --> 01:16:22,966
- When do we leave?
- What about the porters?

776
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:23,842
Porters?

777
01:16:23,936 --> 01:16:27,684
- Didn't you find out about the porters?
- Why, I'm sorry, but l...

778
01:16:27,773 --> 01:16:29,931
What were you doing all this time?

779
01:16:30,025 --> 01:16:32,267
What's the matter with you?
You went there...

780
01:16:32,402 --> 01:16:36,067
Do you mind?
I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.

781
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:15,893
Hello.

782
01:17:47,686 --> 01:17:48,931
Good morning.

783
01:17:51,607 --> 01:17:55,022
"Lay thee down now, and rest

784
01:17:56,236 --> 01:17:59,403
"May thy slumber be blessed

785
01:18:00,073 --> 01:18:03,905
"Lullaby, and good night

786
01:18:04,578 --> 01:18:08,741
"Thy mother's delight

787
01:18:08,832 --> 01:18:12,450
"Bright angels around

788
01:18:12,544 --> 01:18:16,162
"My darling shall sound

789
01:18:16,256 --> 01:18:19,874
"They will guard thee from harm"

790
01:18:20,886 --> 01:18:21,965
Do you mind?

791
01:18:25,223 --> 01:18:28,842
"They will guard thee from harm

792
01:18:28,936 --> 01:18:32,767
"Thou shall wake in my arms"

793
01:18:36,318 --> 01:18:37,942
This is Mr. Conway, children.

794
01:18:38,028 --> 01:18:40,104
Good morning, Mr. Conway.

795
01:18:42,741 --> 01:18:45,410
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.

796
01:19:27,828 --> 01:19:30,864
Children, Teacher is going to be very busy
this afternoon.

797
01:19:30,956 --> 01:19:32,830
So, school's dismissed.

798
01:20:05,115 --> 01:20:06,230
Please.

799
01:20:06,325 --> 01:20:08,780
I hope you're not going
to run away this time.

800
01:20:10,704 --> 01:20:12,079
My name's Sondra.

801
01:20:12,247 --> 01:20:14,074
I hope you'll forgive me for...

802
01:20:15,918 --> 01:20:19,037
You know, each time I see you,
I hear that music.

803
01:20:19,129 --> 01:20:20,292
What is it?

804
01:20:20,422 --> 01:20:22,249
You mean my pigeons.

805
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:35,761
It's these little flutes
that I attached to their tails. See?

806
01:20:37,856 --> 01:20:40,940
Come along with me
and I'll show you how I put them on.

807
01:20:53,872 --> 01:20:55,781
This is how we tie them on.

808
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,750
By varying the size of the flutes,
I can get any notes I wish.

809
01:20:59,836 --> 01:21:01,414
The wind does the rest.

810
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:05,293
Here's a little fellow who has lost his.

811
01:21:06,885 --> 01:21:09,174
- Was this your idea?
- Yes.

812
01:21:09,304 --> 01:21:11,012
Hold this pigeon.

813
01:21:13,308 --> 01:21:15,716
You suggested my being brought here,
didn't you?

814
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:17,934
What gave you the idea I'd fit in?

815
01:21:18,021 --> 01:21:21,556
- That was easy. I'd read your books.
- You've read my books?

816
01:21:22,693 --> 01:21:24,151
You do more things.

817
01:21:24,236 --> 01:21:26,312
What have my books got to do with it?

818
01:21:26,405 --> 01:21:28,481
I saw a man whose life was empty.

819
01:21:28,657 --> 01:21:30,484
"A man whose life was empty. "

820
01:21:30,576 --> 01:21:35,368
I know, it was full of this and full of that.
But you were accomplishing nothing.

821
01:21:35,455 --> 01:21:37,495
You were going nowhere and you knew it.

822
01:21:37,624 --> 01:21:41,076
As a matter of fact, all I saw
was a little boy whistling in the dark.

823
01:21:41,295 --> 01:21:43,371
"A little boy whistling... "

824
01:21:45,882 --> 01:21:49,417
Do you realise that there was
a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai...

825
01:21:49,511 --> 01:21:52,714
...smoke pouring out of its funnels,
tugging at its moorings...

826
01:21:52,806 --> 01:21:55,262
...waiting to take Mr. Conway
back to London.

827
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:58,470
Do you know right now
there are headlines shrieking the news...

828
01:21:58,562 --> 01:22:02,476
...that Conway's missing? Does that look
like a man who's life was empty?

829
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:04,431
Yes.

830
01:22:05,402 --> 01:22:06,980
You're absolutely right.

831
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:11,188
I had to come to a pigeon house in
Shangri-La to find the only other person...

832
01:22:11,283 --> 01:22:14,403
...who knew it. May I congratulate you?

833
01:22:15,746 --> 01:22:18,071
I only brought you here
to show you my pigeons.

834
01:22:18,165 --> 01:22:19,540
Don't worry about them.

835
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:22,709
Now you can put flutes on my tail
and bells on my feet.

836
01:22:23,629 --> 01:22:27,044
I've so many questions I'd like to ask,
I don't know where to begin.

837
01:22:27,132 --> 01:22:31,082
I'll help you. To begin with,
you'd like to know what I'm doing here.

838
01:22:31,178 --> 01:22:33,384
- That I was born here.
- Thank you.

839
01:22:33,764 --> 01:22:35,507
Well, I was almost born here.

840
01:22:35,849 --> 01:22:38,554
It took place in that wild country
beyond the pass.

841
01:22:38,852 --> 01:22:43,644
My parents were in a party of explorers
who got lost and wandered for a year.

842
01:22:43,899 --> 01:22:46,568
When Chang found us
only father and I were alive.

843
01:22:47,027 --> 01:22:49,814
He was too weak to climb the pass.
He died on the way.

844
01:22:51,073 --> 01:22:53,030
I was brought up by Father Perrault.

845
01:22:53,116 --> 01:22:55,690
I envy you.

846
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,742
- I talked to him last night.
- I know.

847
01:23:01,208 --> 01:23:03,995
I can't quite get used to this age thing.

848
01:23:08,006 --> 01:23:09,417
I'm 30.

849
01:23:11,301 --> 01:23:13,626
You're going to make life very simple.

850
01:23:18,016 --> 01:23:19,392
It's inconceivable.

851
01:23:19,851 --> 01:23:21,559
- What?
- All of it.

852
01:23:21,895 --> 01:23:24,351
Father Perrault and his magnificent history.

853
01:23:24,773 --> 01:23:27,644
This place, hidden away
from the rest of the world...

854
01:23:28,485 --> 01:23:30,643
...with its glorious concepts.

855
01:23:31,989 --> 01:23:34,906
And now you come along
and confuse me entirely.

856
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:38,034
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light.

857
01:23:39,538 --> 01:23:42,823
Why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?

858
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:46,624
On the contrary, you're not strange.
And that in itself is confusing.

859
01:23:46,712 --> 01:23:49,416
I had the same idea about Shangri-La.

860
01:23:49,506 --> 01:23:52,293
The sense I've been here before,
that I belonged here.

861
01:23:52,384 --> 01:23:53,629
I'm so glad.

862
01:23:54,177 --> 01:23:57,712
I can't quite explain it,
but everything is somehow...

863
01:23:58,348 --> 01:23:59,380
...familiar.

864
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,051
The very air that I breathe. The lamasery...

865
01:24:03,854 --> 01:24:07,305
...with its feet rooted in the good earth
of this fertile valley...

866
01:24:08,442 --> 01:24:10,730
...while its head explores the eternal.

867
01:24:11,528 --> 01:24:15,608
All the beautiful things I see,
these cherry blossoms, you...

868
01:24:16,408 --> 01:24:18,068
...all somehow are familiar.

869
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:22,032
I've been kidnapped
and brought here against my will.

870
01:24:22,122 --> 01:24:25,573
A crime, a great crime,
yet I accept it amiably.

871
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:30,706
With the same amiability one tolerates
only from a very dear and close friend.

872
01:24:31,548 --> 01:24:33,588
Why? Can you tell me why?

873
01:24:34,968 --> 01:24:38,420
Maybe 'cause you've always been part
of Shangri-La without knowing it.

874
01:24:38,764 --> 01:24:41,599
- I wonder.
- I'm sure of it.

875
01:24:41,934 --> 01:24:45,349
Just as I am sure there's a wish
for Shangri-La in everyone's heart.

876
01:24:45,812 --> 01:24:49,596
I've never seen the outside world,
but I understand there are many people...

877
01:24:49,691 --> 01:24:52,099
...who are supposed
to be mean and greedy.

878
01:24:52,277 --> 01:24:55,777
I just know that secretly
they are all hoping to find a garden spot...

879
01:24:56,114 --> 01:24:58,985
...where there is peace and security.

880
01:24:59,201 --> 01:25:01,028
Where there's beauty and comfort.

881
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:03,741
Where they wouldn't have
to be mean and greedy.

882
01:25:04,414 --> 01:25:07,415
I just wish the whole world
might come to this valley.

883
01:25:08,168 --> 01:25:11,169
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.

884
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:20,257
I don't know why I associate with you,
Mr. Barnard or Mr. Chalmers Bryant...

885
01:25:20,347 --> 01:25:23,052
...or Mr. Embezzler,
or whatever your name may be.

886
01:25:23,767 --> 01:25:26,768
- Just call me Barney.
- Barney? Why should I?

887
01:25:26,895 --> 01:25:28,769
Never, we have nothing in common.

888
01:25:29,398 --> 01:25:30,773
What effrontery!

889
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,858
Okay, Lovey.

890
01:25:34,486 --> 01:25:37,985
And this trip to the valley.
Why did I allow you to drag me here?

891
01:25:38,073 --> 01:25:40,611
You don't know anything
about these people.

892
01:25:41,368 --> 01:25:42,910
We're not even armed.

893
01:25:43,328 --> 01:25:46,282
They're very nice people,
except that they've got horns.

894
01:25:46,582 --> 01:25:48,621
- Horns?
- You know.

895
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:50,240
Horns.

896
01:25:51,503 --> 01:25:52,997
What kind of horns?

897
01:26:00,137 --> 01:26:02,710
Come on. They won't hurt you.

898
01:26:03,807 --> 01:26:05,432
All I want is a glass of wine.

899
01:26:05,517 --> 01:26:06,715
- Thanks.
- Sit down.

900
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:08,968
Now this is fine. This is swell.

901
01:26:09,062 --> 01:26:13,190
No, thanks, just a drink.
I've been walking and I'm a little thirsty.

902
01:26:13,275 --> 01:26:16,975
That's all right.
I just don't happen to be very hungry.

903
01:26:18,864 --> 01:26:22,315
All I asked for was a glass of wine.

904
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,615
Look here, I've got
to have some help with this.

905
01:26:26,955 --> 01:26:28,497
Where is Lovey?

906
01:26:29,291 --> 01:26:30,406
Look!

907
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:32,043
Mr. Barnard!

908
01:26:35,881 --> 01:26:36,960
Come here!

909
01:26:49,269 --> 01:26:51,641
I asked for a glass of wine, look what I got.

910
01:26:51,813 --> 01:26:53,473
Come on, sit down.

911
01:26:54,524 --> 01:26:56,731
This is where you are.
I might have known.

912
01:26:56,818 --> 01:27:00,069
- No wonder you couldn't hear me.
- Relax and have a glass of wine.

913
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:03,151
- Sit down!
- And be poisoned out here in the open?

914
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:17,037
- Won't you please have a glass of wine?
- I never drink wine, in the daytime.

915
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:23,715
- There you are.
- This doesn't obligate me in any way.

916
01:27:23,845 --> 01:27:25,008
No.

917
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:34,602
The bears came right into the bedroom
and the little baby bear said:

918
01:27:34,898 --> 01:27:37,685
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "

919
01:27:38,777 --> 01:27:42,146
And then the mama bear said:
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "

920
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,362
And then the big papa bear, he roared:

921
01:27:44,449 --> 01:27:46,987
"And somebody's been sleeping
in my bed. "

922
01:27:48,954 --> 01:27:52,405
You have to admit,
the poor little bears were in a quandary.

923
01:27:52,499 --> 01:27:55,072
Well, I'm going to sleep in my bed.
Come on, Lovey.

924
01:27:55,168 --> 01:27:57,291
- They were in a quandary.
- Come on, Lovey.

925
01:27:57,379 --> 01:27:59,122
Why, "Come on" all the time?

926
01:27:59,214 --> 01:28:02,500
What's the matter,
you going to be a fuss-budget all your life?

927
01:28:02,593 --> 01:28:05,166
Drink it up. Aren't you having any fun?

928
01:28:06,263 --> 01:28:08,469
- Where was I?
- In a quandary.

929
01:28:12,936 --> 01:28:14,929
I'm telling this story.

930
01:28:15,063 --> 01:28:17,637
The poor little bears...

931
01:28:18,025 --> 01:28:22,770
...they didn't know what to do.
Somebody had been sleeping in their beds.

932
01:28:23,155 --> 01:28:26,358
Who slept in their beds?
Who was it, Lovey?

933
01:28:28,118 --> 01:28:29,778
You called me "Lovey"?

934
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:34,321
Look at those eyes.
There's the devil in those eyes.

935
01:28:37,127 --> 01:28:41,588
"Here we go gathering nuts in May

936
01:28:41,715 --> 01:28:46,211
"Here we go gathering nuts in May
Early on Tuesday morning

937
01:28:49,014 --> 01:28:53,094
"Here we go, Shangri-La, Shangri-La

938
01:28:55,187 --> 01:28:57,226
"Here you are in Shangri-La"

939
01:29:51,243 --> 01:29:52,488
Hello, Maria.

940
01:29:57,374 --> 01:29:59,782
You promised to come for tea yesterday.

941
01:30:01,837 --> 01:30:03,414
I waited for so long.

942
01:30:04,506 --> 01:30:05,965
Sorry.

943
01:30:09,761 --> 01:30:13,344
- I haven't got any cigarettes left.
- I'll make some for you.

944
01:30:14,558 --> 01:30:16,052
You will come today?

945
01:30:17,144 --> 01:30:18,140
Perhaps.

946
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,930
Please say you will.

947
01:30:20,731 --> 01:30:23,934
The days are very long and lonely
without you.

948
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,266
Please.

949
01:30:27,904 --> 01:30:29,529
All right, I'll be there.

950
01:30:30,073 --> 01:30:31,532
Thank you.

951
01:30:33,243 --> 01:30:35,651
You'll tell me the things
I want to know, right?

952
01:30:35,746 --> 01:30:39,280
Who's in charge? Why we were kidnapped
and what will happen to us?

953
01:30:39,374 --> 01:30:42,044
Chang's been lying about those porters,
hasn't he?

954
01:31:14,868 --> 01:31:16,149
Beautiful.

955
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:19,570
- I'm waiting for the bump.
- "Bump"?

956
01:31:20,749 --> 01:31:23,952
When the plane lands at Shanghai
and wakes us all up.

957
01:31:25,921 --> 01:31:28,044
You see. It's not a dream.

958
01:31:28,298 --> 01:31:31,465
I sometimes think
that the other is the dream.

959
01:31:31,677 --> 01:31:33,087
The outside world.

960
01:31:33,929 --> 01:31:37,049
- Have you never wanted to go there?
- Goodness, no!

961
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,892
From what you tell me,
it doesn't sound very attractive.

962
01:31:40,018 --> 01:31:41,892
It's not so bad really.

963
01:31:42,688 --> 01:31:46,187
Some phases of it are sordid, of course.
That's only to be expected.

964
01:31:46,483 --> 01:31:47,598
Why?

965
01:31:48,068 --> 01:31:49,348
Usual reasons.

966
01:31:49,486 --> 01:31:53,863
- A world of people struggling for existence.
- Struggling? Why?

967
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:57,941
Everyone naturally wants
to make a place for himself.

968
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,955
- Accumulate a nest egg and so on.
- Why?

969
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:06,292
If you keep on asking that,
we're not going to get anywhere.

970
01:32:06,378 --> 01:32:09,829
- And don't ask me why.
- I was just going to.

971
01:32:10,048 --> 01:32:12,670
It's the most annoying word
in the English language.

972
01:32:12,759 --> 01:32:15,297
Ever hear a child torture his parent with it?

973
01:32:15,387 --> 01:32:18,471
"Mother's darling mustn't stuff her fingers
in the salad bowl. "

974
01:32:18,557 --> 01:32:19,968
"Why?"

975
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,509
"Because it isn't ladylike to do that. "

976
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:24,061
"Why?"

977
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:26,685
"That's what forks are made for, darling. "

978
01:32:26,773 --> 01:32:29,977
- "Why, Mother?"
- "Mother read it in a book somewhere.

979
01:32:30,068 --> 01:32:32,820
"If Mother's little darling
doesn't take her fingers...

980
01:32:32,904 --> 01:32:37,981
"... out of the salad bowl this instant,
Mother's going to wring her little neck. "

981
01:32:40,704 --> 01:32:43,788
- Would you like to wring my little neck?
- I'd love it.

982
01:32:44,124 --> 01:32:45,784
Why?

983
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:54,798
I'm sorry.

984
01:33:13,779 --> 01:33:15,652
I've thought about it for years.

985
01:33:16,865 --> 01:33:18,525
I knew you'd come.

986
01:33:19,201 --> 01:33:21,692
And I knew when you did,
you'd never leave.

987
01:33:23,288 --> 01:33:25,613
Am I forgiven for sending for you?

988
01:33:25,874 --> 01:33:27,155
Forgiven.

989
01:33:31,505 --> 01:33:33,544
When we were on that plane...

990
01:33:33,632 --> 01:33:36,337
...I was fascinated by the way
its shadow followed it.

991
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:38,087
That silly shadow...

992
01:33:38,178 --> 01:33:40,467
...racing along over mountains
and valleys...

993
01:33:40,597 --> 01:33:42,969
...covering 10 times the distance
of the plane.

994
01:33:43,892 --> 01:33:48,056
Yet always there to greet us
with outstretched arms when we landed.

995
01:33:49,064 --> 01:33:53,477
I've been thinking
that somehow you're that plane...

996
01:33:54,236 --> 01:33:56,525
...and I'm that silly shadow.

997
01:33:57,447 --> 01:34:00,199
That all my life,
I've been rushing up and down hills...

998
01:34:00,492 --> 01:34:03,826
...leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles...

999
01:34:04,830 --> 01:34:08,495
...never dreaming that one day,
that beautiful thing in flight...

1000
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:11,829
...could land on this earth
and into my arms.

1001
01:34:26,768 --> 01:34:29,259
This place is amazing.

1002
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:32,315
That marble quarry in the valley
is simply magnificent.

1003
01:34:32,441 --> 01:34:34,599
I've looked around. I've seen everything.

1004
01:34:34,693 --> 01:34:37,896
Your woodworkers and your cloth weavers
are all so happy.

1005
01:34:38,488 --> 01:34:41,110
You may not know it,
but right here you have Utopia.

1006
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:44,366
- You're very kind.
- I don't mean it in that sense.

1007
01:34:44,453 --> 01:34:46,576
I only give credit where credit is due.

1008
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:53,701
I'm very anxious to have you realise
that I never for a moment believed...

1009
01:34:53,795 --> 01:34:55,622
...that ridiculous kidnapping story.

1010
01:34:55,714 --> 01:34:57,623
- I'm so glad.
- Simply preposterous.

1011
01:34:57,716 --> 01:35:02,757
Do you know what I did last night?
I held a sort of a self inventory.

1012
01:35:03,055 --> 01:35:07,800
I said to myself last night,
"Lovey, Mr. Lovett... "

1013
01:35:09,102 --> 01:35:12,436
- I said, "You are an ungrateful fool. "
- No.

1014
01:35:12,522 --> 01:35:15,096
Those are my very words
to myself last night.

1015
01:35:15,233 --> 01:35:19,646
"These people here are doing everything
to make your stay comfortable...

1016
01:35:19,738 --> 01:35:23,605
"... and I haven't done one single thing
to show my appreciation. "

1017
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:25,742
What would you like to do?

1018
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:29,653
I thought with your permission
and while I'm waiting for these porters...

1019
01:35:29,831 --> 01:35:32,998
...l'd like to organise classes
for the children in the valley...

1020
01:35:33,085 --> 01:35:36,536
...and teach them something practical
and something useful. Geology.

1021
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:38,707
- Splendid.
- Isn't it?

1022
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:40,838
I was a professor for 20 years.

1023
01:35:40,968 --> 01:35:43,423
- And a very good one.
- I'm sure you were.

1024
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:46,211
- When would you like to start?
- Immediately.

1025
01:35:46,306 --> 01:35:48,133
Then it's done.

1026
01:35:48,225 --> 01:35:49,304
Thank you.

1027
01:35:49,851 --> 01:35:51,511
You get the idea?

1028
01:35:51,603 --> 01:35:54,308
From this reservoir here,
I can pipe the whole works.

1029
01:35:54,648 --> 01:35:56,475
I'm going to get a kick out of this.

1030
01:35:56,566 --> 01:35:59,900
It's just to keep my hand in.
With the equipment we have here...

1031
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:03,854
...I can put a plumbing system
in the whole village. Rig it up in no time.

1032
01:36:03,949 --> 01:36:07,282
Do you realise those people
are still going to the well for water?

1033
01:36:07,369 --> 01:36:10,121
- It's unbelievable.
- Think of it! In times like these!

1034
01:36:10,872 --> 01:36:12,782
What about that gold deal?

1035
01:36:13,375 --> 01:36:15,700
- Gold, you know...
- Oh, that.

1036
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:19,124
That can wait.
Nobody's going to run off with it.

1037
01:36:19,214 --> 01:36:22,132
I've got to get busy.
I want to show this layout to Chang.

1038
01:36:22,217 --> 01:36:25,088
- Don't you take any wooden nickels.
- All right.

1039
01:36:35,355 --> 01:36:38,440
You're acting like a child.
You haven't talked for two weeks.

1040
01:36:38,525 --> 01:36:40,269
There's nothing to say.

1041
01:36:57,127 --> 01:36:59,583
- I'm afraid that does it.
- I'm afraid it does.

1042
01:36:59,671 --> 01:37:01,047
Shall we have another?

1043
01:37:01,173 --> 01:37:03,047
Not tonight, if you don't mind.

1044
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:18,391
Come in, my dear.

1045
01:37:18,565 --> 01:37:21,103
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

1046
01:37:21,985 --> 01:37:24,607
I thought Mr. Conway's brother was here.

1047
01:37:25,781 --> 01:37:27,323
Excuse me.

1048
01:37:39,544 --> 01:37:41,039
Charming, isn't she?

1049
01:37:41,505 --> 01:37:43,047
Yes. Charming.

1050
01:37:43,924 --> 01:37:46,545
Your brother seems
quite fascinated by her.

1051
01:37:46,677 --> 01:37:49,132
Why not?
She's an attractive young woman.

1052
01:37:49,221 --> 01:37:52,138
Young? She arrived here in 1888.

1053
01:37:52,683 --> 01:37:56,632
She was 20 at the time.
She was on her way to join her betrothed...

1054
01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:59,439
...when her carriers
lost their way in the mountain.

1055
01:37:59,523 --> 01:38:02,643
The party would've perished,
but for meeting some of our people.

1056
01:38:02,734 --> 01:38:05,404
Amazing. Still doesn't look over 20.

1057
01:38:06,363 --> 01:38:08,771
When is she likely to grow old
in appearance?

1058
01:38:08,865 --> 01:38:12,566
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her
youthful indefinitely.

1059
01:38:12,703 --> 01:38:14,245
Suppose she should leave?

1060
01:38:14,454 --> 01:38:15,783
Leave Shangri-La?

1061
01:38:16,665 --> 01:38:18,954
That's not likely.
You couldn't drive her out.

1062
01:38:19,042 --> 01:38:20,323
I mean her appearance.

1063
01:38:20,419 --> 01:38:23,373
If she should leave the valley,
what would happen?

1064
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:27,048
She'd quickly revert in appearance
to her actual age.

1065
01:38:30,095 --> 01:38:31,293
It's weird.

1066
01:38:35,976 --> 01:38:37,304
How old are you?

1067
01:38:38,937 --> 01:38:42,437
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves.

1068
01:38:45,485 --> 01:38:48,107
Each time you Westerners...

1069
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:53,487
...celebrate your birthday,
you build another fence around your minds.

1070
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,785
There you are! You're just the man
I'm looking for. A fine trick.

1071
01:38:58,999 --> 01:39:02,083
Smart, aren't you? What lies
you told us about those porters!

1072
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:04,920
The minute they arrive we can leave,
if they'd take us.

1073
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:07,674
- But you know you'd tell 'em not to.
- My dear boy...

1074
01:39:07,758 --> 01:39:11,043
You've been lying since we arrived.
It's worked for some people.

1075
01:39:11,136 --> 01:39:14,007
Because they lack the courage
to do something. But not me.

1076
01:39:14,097 --> 01:39:15,722
You're up against the wrong man.

1077
01:39:15,807 --> 01:39:18,892
I'll leave, even if I have to blow
this place into the valley.

1078
01:39:18,977 --> 01:39:21,184
I'll get out, porters or no porters!

1079
01:39:24,483 --> 01:39:27,188
You must prevail upon him
not to attempt the journey.

1080
01:39:27,277 --> 01:39:29,899
He could never get through
that country alive.

1081
01:39:30,447 --> 01:39:32,274
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide.

1082
01:39:34,493 --> 01:39:39,320
Yes, of course your brother is a problem.
It was to be expected.

1083
01:39:39,414 --> 01:39:42,415
I knew you'd understand.
That's why I came to you for help.

1084
01:39:43,377 --> 01:39:48,502
You must not look to me for help.
Your brother is no longer my problem.

1085
01:39:49,549 --> 01:39:53,215
He is now your problem.

1086
01:39:53,512 --> 01:39:54,674
Mine?

1087
01:39:55,681 --> 01:40:00,923
Because, my son,
I'm placing in your hands...

1088
01:40:01,019 --> 01:40:06,773
...the future and destiny of Shangri-La...

1089
01:40:08,485 --> 01:40:10,478
...for I am going to die.

1090
01:40:16,034 --> 01:40:20,364
I knew my work was done,
when I first set eyes upon you.

1091
01:40:22,124 --> 01:40:26,168
I've waited for you, my son,
for a long time.

1092
01:40:27,045 --> 01:40:31,257
I've sat in this room
and seen the faces of newcomers.

1093
01:40:31,508 --> 01:40:34,842
I've looked into their eyes
and heard their voices...

1094
01:40:35,721 --> 01:40:40,098
...always in hope that I might find you.

1095
01:40:43,478 --> 01:40:48,105
My friend, it is not an arduous task
that I bequeath...

1096
01:40:49,192 --> 01:40:52,608
...for our order knows only silken bonds.

1097
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:57,323
To be gentle and patient.

1098
01:40:58,201 --> 01:41:01,784
To care for the riches of the mind.

1099
01:41:02,664 --> 01:41:06,247
To preside in wisdom...

1100
01:41:07,502 --> 01:41:10,254
...while the storm rages without.

1101
01:41:11,173 --> 01:41:14,589
Do you think this will come in my time?

1102
01:41:19,598 --> 01:41:24,094
You, my son, will live through the storm.

1103
01:41:24,561 --> 01:41:28,725
You will preserve the fragrance
of our history...

1104
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:34,062
...and add to it a touch of your own mind.

1105
01:41:36,823 --> 01:41:40,987
Beyond that, my vision weakens.

1106
01:41:42,829 --> 01:41:46,448
But I see at a great distance...

1107
01:41:47,376 --> 01:41:50,377
...a new world stirring in the ruins...

1108
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:54,205
...stirring clumsily...

1109
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:56,800
...but in hopefulness...

1110
01:41:57,678 --> 01:42:03,052
...seeking its lost and legendary treasures...

1111
01:42:05,727 --> 01:42:09,310
...and they will all be here, my son.

1112
01:42:10,983 --> 01:42:13,224
Hidden behind the mountains...

1113
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:19,025
...in the Valley of the Blue Moon...

1114
01:42:20,659 --> 01:42:25,653
...preserved as by a miracle.

1115
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:10,538
We run the pipes through here
and connect with the main waterline here.

1116
01:43:10,626 --> 01:43:12,452
Where are you going to get pipes?

1117
01:43:12,544 --> 01:43:15,628
That's a cinch. I'll show them
how to cast pipes out of clay.

1118
01:43:15,714 --> 01:43:19,581
There you are. You'd better get
your things together. We're leaving.

1119
01:43:19,843 --> 01:43:22,844
- Leaving?
- The porters are taking us back.

1120
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:25,171
We've got clothing, food, everything.

1121
01:43:25,265 --> 01:43:26,973
When are you going to start?

1122
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:30,304
This very minute.
They're waiting for us on the plateau.

1123
01:43:30,395 --> 01:43:33,266
That Chinaman thought he could stop me.
Come along.

1124
01:43:33,482 --> 01:43:37,776
I think I'll stick around.
I'll leave with the porters on the next trip.

1125
01:43:38,403 --> 01:43:40,063
You mean you don't want to go?

1126
01:43:40,197 --> 01:43:41,110
Well, I'm...

1127
01:43:41,323 --> 01:43:43,481
You're afraid of going to jail.

1128
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:47,030
You see I've got this plumbing business.

1129
01:43:47,204 --> 01:43:50,489
If you insist being an idiot,
I won't coax you. How about you?

1130
01:43:50,582 --> 01:43:54,995
You don't want to go yet, honey.
She'll stick around, too. That right?

1131
01:43:55,087 --> 01:43:56,367
If you want me to.

1132
01:43:56,463 --> 01:43:59,215
Sure. Don't you worry.
I'll take care of you.

1133
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:03,000
All right, suit yourself,
but just remember you had your chance.

1134
01:44:03,345 --> 01:44:05,551
- How about you? Do you want to go?
- Where?

1135
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:07,797
Home. I've got porters to take us back.

1136
01:44:08,016 --> 01:44:10,686
I'm sorry. That's impossible.
I have my classes.

1137
01:44:10,769 --> 01:44:13,640
I don't care what you've started.
Do you want to go?

1138
01:44:13,939 --> 01:44:15,563
No, I think I'd better wait.

1139
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:18,401
- Yes, I'll wait.
- You'll wait until you rot!

1140
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,780
- Hello, Gloria.
- Hello.

1141
01:44:29,955 --> 01:44:32,707
I've just finished translating
an interesting old tablet.

1142
01:44:32,791 --> 01:44:35,282
It told me of the origin
of the Masonic symbols...

1143
01:44:35,377 --> 01:44:36,657
- That's swell.
- What?

1144
01:44:36,753 --> 01:44:38,793
I want to show you something.

1145
01:44:39,047 --> 01:44:40,839
Isn't that pretty. What is it?

1146
01:44:40,924 --> 01:44:42,798
Plumbing. Everything modern.

1147
01:44:42,884 --> 01:44:45,257
I'm going to run pipes
all through the village.

1148
01:46:09,846 --> 01:46:11,389
Hello, George.

1149
01:46:14,309 --> 01:46:17,809
You can stop worrying now.
I've made arrangements to leave.

1150
01:46:18,105 --> 01:46:20,774
If you let me close that window,
I can talk to you.

1151
01:46:20,857 --> 01:46:23,016
That noise is driving me crazy.

1152
01:46:26,863 --> 01:46:29,734
I said we're getting out of here.
Back to civilisation.

1153
01:46:29,825 --> 01:46:33,360
I made a deal with the porters.
They're leaving tomorrow at dawn.

1154
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:36,787
They're waiting for us outside the valley.
Get your things together.

1155
01:46:36,873 --> 01:46:38,949
- Where's your topcoat?
- You can't leave.

1156
01:46:39,126 --> 01:46:40,750
What's going to stop me?

1157
01:46:40,836 --> 01:46:43,706
- You've got to stay here now.
- Stay here?

1158
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:46,084
What's the matter with you?

1159
01:46:46,174 --> 01:46:49,709
You've acted strangely since we came.
I've never seen you like this.

1160
01:46:49,803 --> 01:46:51,961
What's stopping us from leaving?

1161
01:46:52,389 --> 01:46:54,595
Something grand and beautiful.

1162
01:46:54,891 --> 01:46:57,561
Something I've been searching for
all my life.

1163
01:46:58,061 --> 01:47:01,146
The answer to the confusion
and bewilderment of a lifetime.

1164
01:47:01,523 --> 01:47:04,228
I've found it and I can't leave it.
You mustn't either.

1165
01:47:04,318 --> 01:47:06,559
I don't know what you're talking about.

1166
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:09,323
You're carrying around a secret
that's eating you up.

1167
01:47:09,406 --> 01:47:11,862
- Tell me about it.
- I want to tell you.

1168
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:15,948
I'll burst with it if I don't.
It's weird and fantastic and unbelievable...

1169
01:47:16,038 --> 01:47:20,118
...but so beautiful. As you know,
we were kidnapped and brought here...

1170
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:22,575
And that's the whole story.

1171
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:29,209
He died, as peacefully as the passing
of a cloud's shadow. His last words were:

1172
01:47:30,344 --> 01:47:33,095
"I place in your hands, my son...

1173
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:36,467
"... the future and destiny of Shangri-La. "

1174
01:47:38,101 --> 01:47:40,094
Now you know why I can't leave.

1175
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:53,529
I really don't know what to say.

1176
01:47:54,493 --> 01:47:58,621
- Except that you must be completely mad.
- You think I'm mad?

1177
01:47:59,373 --> 01:48:01,661
What else can I think after a tale like that?

1178
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:03,992
Things like that don't happen today.

1179
01:48:04,086 --> 01:48:07,122
- We're living in the 20th century.
- You think it's nonsense?

1180
01:48:07,214 --> 01:48:11,164
You've been hypnotised by fanatics.
I wouldn't believe it in England.

1181
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:15,127
Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?
How do you know these things are true?

1182
01:48:15,222 --> 01:48:17,594
- Did they show you proof?
- I don't need proof.

1183
01:48:17,683 --> 01:48:20,138
I knew there was a reason
why I hated this place.

1184
01:48:20,227 --> 01:48:23,726
I'd love to fly over it with bombs
for what they've done to you.

1185
01:48:23,814 --> 01:48:26,684
All this talk about lamas
being hundreds of years old.

1186
01:48:26,775 --> 01:48:29,776
How do you know?
Did you see their birth certificates?

1187
01:48:29,987 --> 01:48:31,397
I can't believe it.

1188
01:48:31,488 --> 01:48:35,189
A bunch of old men sit around
and dream about reforming the world...

1189
01:48:35,284 --> 01:48:38,617
...and you, two-feet-on-the-ground Conway,
want to join them.

1190
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:40,121
It's horrible.

1191
01:48:40,914 --> 01:48:42,823
Is that all my story meant to you?

1192
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,333
What else could it mean to me?
It's obviously a lot of bunk.

1193
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:50,168
Then you'd better go.
This is no place for you.

1194
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:54,670
It's no place for you.
Think of what's waiting for you.

1195
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:56,920
Do you want to stay here
till you're half dead?

1196
01:48:57,014 --> 01:48:59,718
Till your mind starts corroding
like the rest of them?

1197
01:48:59,808 --> 01:49:02,892
- I don't want to talk about it anymore.
- You've got to talk.

1198
01:49:02,978 --> 01:49:05,303
And me?
They stole the plane to bring you here.

1199
01:49:05,397 --> 01:49:08,066
I didn't want to come.
You owe me some responsibility.

1200
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:10,023
I'm tired of owing you things.

1201
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:12,150
You're free to go. Go ahead.

1202
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:15,402
It's that girl.

1203
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:19,820
- That girl has twisted and turned...
- That's enough. Never mind the girl.

1204
01:49:22,331 --> 01:49:23,991
Why don't you go?

1205
01:49:30,923 --> 01:49:32,298
Look here.

1206
01:49:32,966 --> 01:49:35,540
Ever since I can remember
you've looked after me.

1207
01:49:35,844 --> 01:49:38,169
Now, you're the one
that needs looking after.

1208
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:42,890
I'm your brother.
If there's something wrong with you...

1209
01:49:43,101 --> 01:49:44,809
...let me help you.

1210
01:49:50,567 --> 01:49:53,438
I don't feel like making that trip alone.

1211
01:49:58,909 --> 01:50:02,325
You couldn't possibly stay here, could you?

1212
01:50:03,163 --> 01:50:04,574
I'd go mad.

1213
01:50:10,545 --> 01:50:12,953
I may be wrong. I may be a maniac...

1214
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:16,294
...but I believe in this
and I'm not going to lose it.

1215
01:50:16,385 --> 01:50:18,508
You know how much I want to help you...

1216
01:50:18,595 --> 01:50:23,008
...but this is bigger, stronger if you like,
than brotherly love.

1217
01:50:25,644 --> 01:50:28,728
I'm sorry. I'm staying.

1218
01:50:32,234 --> 01:50:34,559
I can't think of anything more to say.

1219
01:50:40,242 --> 01:50:41,404
Goodbye.

1220
01:50:50,544 --> 01:50:53,165
Are you sure the porters
will take care of you?

1221
01:50:53,672 --> 01:50:55,629
It's all set.

1222
01:50:55,757 --> 01:50:58,427
- Maria made the arrangements.
- Maria?

1223
01:50:59,386 --> 01:51:01,675
- The little Russian girl.
- How's she involved?

1224
01:51:01,763 --> 01:51:03,886
- She's going with me.
- You're crazy.

1225
01:51:05,809 --> 01:51:08,051
- You can't take her away from here.
- Why not?

1226
01:51:08,145 --> 01:51:11,561
You can't. Do you know what will happen
if she leaves Shangri-La?

1227
01:51:11,648 --> 01:51:14,733
She's fragile and can only live
where fragile things are loved.

1228
01:51:14,818 --> 01:51:17,985
Take her out of this valley
and she'll fade away like an echo.

1229
01:51:18,155 --> 01:51:20,313
What do you mean,
"Fade away like an echo"?

1230
01:51:20,407 --> 01:51:22,115
She came here in 1888.

1231
01:51:23,535 --> 01:51:27,284
This'd be funny, if it weren't so pathetic.
She isn't a day over 20.

1232
01:51:27,915 --> 01:51:30,240
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong. She told me so.

1233
01:51:30,334 --> 01:51:33,121
Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me.
I'd know anyway.

1234
01:51:33,211 --> 01:51:35,204
I found out a lot of things last night.

1235
01:51:35,297 --> 01:51:38,214
I'm not ashamed of it.
It's one of the few decent things...

1236
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:42,250
...that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Everyone is happy in Shangri-La.

1237
01:51:42,387 --> 01:51:45,341
Nobody would ever think of leaving.
It's all just rot!

1238
01:51:45,432 --> 01:51:48,883
She's pleaded with me since I came
to take her away from this place.

1239
01:51:49,019 --> 01:51:51,771
She's cried in my arms,
for fear I'd leave her here.

1240
01:51:51,855 --> 01:51:55,141
She's made two trips to the plateau
to bribe the porters. For me!

1241
01:51:55,275 --> 01:51:57,315
I don't believe a word of it.

1242
01:51:57,402 --> 01:51:59,146
All right, I'll prove it to you.

1243
01:51:59,237 --> 01:52:03,484
You've believed everything they're told you
without proof. I'll prove my story.

1244
01:52:06,203 --> 01:52:07,827
Come in a minute.

1245
01:52:18,966 --> 01:52:21,089
I've got some bad news for you.

1246
01:52:21,677 --> 01:52:25,128
My brother and I've decided
we can't take you along.

1247
01:52:26,348 --> 01:52:32,102
You can't take me?
You promised to take me with you!

1248
01:52:34,398 --> 01:52:37,601
It's all your fault.
It was all arranged until he spoke to you.

1249
01:52:37,693 --> 01:52:39,602
Why can't you leave us alone?

1250
01:52:39,945 --> 01:52:43,990
- You want to leave Shangri-La?
- I'll die if I have to stay another minute.

1251
01:52:44,574 --> 01:52:48,275
I've waited a long time for this chance
and you're not going to stop me now.

1252
01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:49,912
If I have to, I'll go alone.

1253
01:52:49,997 --> 01:52:53,200
I brought the porters.
If it weren't for me, you'd never get out.

1254
01:52:53,292 --> 01:52:55,996
The High Lama told them
not to take anyone.

1255
01:52:56,128 --> 01:52:59,627
The High Lama!
Who pays any attention to him?

1256
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,916
The porters laugh at the High Lama.

1257
01:53:02,009 --> 01:53:04,250
They only want to know
how much gold he'll give.

1258
01:53:04,344 --> 01:53:07,713
I gave them more gold.
I've been stealing it for a year.

1259
01:53:07,973 --> 01:53:09,930
I'd do anything to leave this place.

1260
01:53:10,017 --> 01:53:12,934
To leave the High Lama,
who calls himself Father Perrault.

1261
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:14,893
He's been insane for years.

1262
01:53:15,022 --> 01:53:18,770
- Father Perrault is dead.
- He's dead! That's fine.

1263
01:53:19,318 --> 01:53:22,651
You won't see me
shedding any tears over him.

1264
01:53:24,323 --> 01:53:26,149
You must take me with you.

1265
01:53:26,742 --> 01:53:28,533
Aren't you afraid to leave?

1266
01:53:28,827 --> 01:53:31,781
You don't want to look
like an old woman, do you?

1267
01:53:33,248 --> 01:53:34,707
Old woman?

1268
01:53:37,002 --> 01:53:40,003
- Chang told you that, didn't he?
- Yes.

1269
01:53:40,213 --> 01:53:41,589
I thought so.

1270
01:53:42,633 --> 01:53:44,376
He tells everyone I'm old.

1271
01:53:44,885 --> 01:53:48,717
He wants them to stay away from me.
He gets mad when anyone comes near me.

1272
01:53:49,556 --> 01:53:52,510
He's punished me for every minute
I've spent with George.

1273
01:53:52,768 --> 01:53:56,516
If it weren't for him, I'd have left long ago.
But he always stops me.

1274
01:53:56,605 --> 01:53:59,855
Six months ago I tried to escape
and he locked me in a dark room.

1275
01:53:59,942 --> 01:54:01,566
I nearly went crazy.

1276
01:54:02,027 --> 01:54:04,814
Look at me! Do I look like an old woman?

1277
01:54:05,197 --> 01:54:07,071
Is this the skin of an old woman?

1278
01:54:07,449 --> 01:54:10,320
Look into my eyes.
Are these the eyes of an old woman?

1279
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:14,159
She was kidnapped and brought here
two years ago just as we were.

1280
01:54:14,623 --> 01:54:17,908
I don't believe it. I can't believe it.
She's lying.

1281
01:54:18,335 --> 01:54:21,206
You're lying.
Every word you've been saying is a lie.

1282
01:54:21,296 --> 01:54:23,040
Say it! You're lying, aren't you?

1283
01:54:23,131 --> 01:54:27,840
No, I'm not lying.
What reason could I have for lying?

1284
01:54:28,011 --> 01:54:31,427
Chances are we'll never come out
of that horrible trip alive.

1285
01:54:32,307 --> 01:54:35,593
But I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm,
be buried alive...

1286
01:54:36,311 --> 01:54:38,802
...than to stay here one more minute.

1287
01:55:25,277 --> 01:55:28,194
- You say the porters are waiting for us?
- Yes.

1288
01:55:29,823 --> 01:55:31,816
- Clothes?
- Yes, everything.

1289
01:55:36,455 --> 01:55:37,735
What about the others?

1290
01:55:37,831 --> 01:55:40,287
I've asked them.
They're afraid to make the trip.

1291
01:55:40,375 --> 01:55:42,949
We'll have to send
an expedition back after them.

1292
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:44,830
Come on, we're wasting time.

1293
01:55:44,922 --> 01:55:47,876
- Are you taking me?
- Certainly. Come on.

1294
01:55:59,269 --> 01:56:01,558
It won't be long before we're in London.

1295
01:56:01,647 --> 01:56:04,564
Can't you just see everyone
when we pop in out of the blue?

1296
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:07,769
We'll have them breathless
when we tell them our story.

1297
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:11,277
You had me worried for a while.
I thought you were gone completely.

1298
01:56:12,449 --> 01:56:15,236
Lucky for me you snapped out of it.
You saved my life.

1299
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:17,948
- I never could have made it alone.
- What was that?

1300
01:56:18,038 --> 01:56:21,158
- I was saying...
- Shut up! Must you go on babbling?

1301
01:56:47,818 --> 01:56:51,317
- What's happened? Where's Bob?
- He's going, my child.

1302
01:56:51,697 --> 01:56:54,152
- Going?
- But he will return.

1303
01:56:54,324 --> 01:56:55,154
No!

1304
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:34,772
I can't stand it. I can't go on anymore.
I've got to rest.

1305
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:44,654
How long is this going to go on?
I can't stand it.

1306
01:59:45,329 --> 01:59:47,321
Can't you get them to wait for us?

1307
01:59:47,414 --> 01:59:49,656
They're leaving us
farther behind every day.

1308
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:53,534
There's nothing that would suit 'em
more than to lose us, but we must go on.

1309
01:59:53,754 --> 01:59:57,538
- Come on, darling.
- I can't. You've got to let me rest.

1310
02:00:29,206 --> 02:00:32,789
Target practice again.
One of these days they're going to hit us.

1311
02:00:33,669 --> 02:00:37,618
As long as they keep on aiming at us,
we're safe. Come now.

1312
02:03:01,108 --> 02:03:03,147
Look at her face!

1313
02:07:32,296 --> 02:07:34,787
"Dropping from nowhere after a year! "

1314
02:07:35,090 --> 02:07:36,798
- Cable from Gainsford.
- Read it!

1315
02:07:37,009 --> 02:07:40,259
"Leaving today for London
with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria.

1316
02:07:40,345 --> 02:07:42,587
"Conway can tell nothing
of his experiences.

1317
02:07:42,681 --> 02:07:45,848
"Is suffering from complete loss
of memory. " Signed, Gainsford.

1318
02:07:45,934 --> 02:07:48,604
- "Loss of memory"?
- All right, give it to the press.

1319
02:07:48,687 --> 02:07:50,845
- All of it?
- Yes. Might as well all of it.

1320
02:07:50,939 --> 02:07:52,731
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.

1321
02:08:09,875 --> 02:08:12,829
Conway's gone again.
Listen to this, from Gainsford.

1322
02:08:13,003 --> 02:08:14,034
Let me have it.

1323
02:08:14,713 --> 02:08:16,172
"Aboard S.S. Manchuria.

1324
02:08:16,256 --> 02:08:19,542
"Last night Conway recovered his memory.
Talked about Shangri-La.

1325
02:08:19,635 --> 02:08:22,090
"Telling a fantastic story
about a place in Tibet.

1326
02:08:22,179 --> 02:08:23,970
"Insisted upon returning there at once.

1327
02:08:24,056 --> 02:08:27,057
"Locked him in, but he escaped
and jumped ship at Singapore.

1328
02:08:27,142 --> 02:08:30,345
"I'm leaving ship to overtake him,
as fearful of his condition.

1329
02:08:30,437 --> 02:08:34,304
"Wrote down details of Conway's story
about Shangri-La, which I am forwarding.

1330
02:08:34,483 --> 02:08:35,645
"Lord Gainsford. "

1331
02:08:52,584 --> 02:08:54,493
Here's Gainsford now.

1332
02:08:57,339 --> 02:08:59,912
- It's good to see you back.
- Glad to see you.

1333
02:09:00,008 --> 02:09:02,795
- It's good to see you again.
- Thought you would never come.

1334
02:09:03,887 --> 02:09:06,176
- Sit down. Have a drink.
- Scotch and soda. I'm parched.

1335
02:09:06,348 --> 02:09:08,175
Here you are. Ready and waiting.

1336
02:09:08,267 --> 02:09:11,386
- Any news of Conway?
- We're eager to know what you discovered.

1337
02:09:11,478 --> 02:09:12,509
Where is he?

1338
02:09:12,729 --> 02:09:17,142
Gentlemen, you see before you
a very weary old man...

1339
02:09:17,776 --> 02:09:20,812
...who has just ended a chase
that lasted nearly 10 months.

1340
02:09:20,904 --> 02:09:22,648
You never caught up with him?

1341
02:09:22,739 --> 02:09:25,824
Since that night he jumped off the ship,
till two weeks ago...

1342
02:09:25,909 --> 02:09:28,661
- ... l've been missing him by inches.
- You don't mean it.

1343
02:09:28,745 --> 02:09:31,865
- Was he that determined to get back?
- Determined?

1344
02:09:32,666 --> 02:09:38,005
Gentlemen, in the whole course of my life,
I've never encountered anything so grim.

1345
02:09:38,672 --> 02:09:43,085
During those last 10 months, that man
has done the most astounding things.

1346
02:09:43,510 --> 02:09:47,887
He learned how to fly, stole a plane,
got caught, put in jail, escaped...

1347
02:09:47,973 --> 02:09:49,930
...in an amazingly short space of time.

1348
02:09:50,017 --> 02:09:52,093
This is only the beginning of his adventure.

1349
02:09:52,185 --> 02:09:56,432
He begged and fought,
pushing forward to the Tibetan frontier.

1350
02:09:56,690 --> 02:09:59,976
Everywhere I heard these amazing stories
of the man's adventures.

1351
02:10:00,068 --> 02:10:02,476
Positively astounding. Till eventually...

1352
02:10:02,613 --> 02:10:05,530
...I trailed him
to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.

1353
02:10:05,949 --> 02:10:07,942
Of course, he had already gone.

1354
02:10:08,035 --> 02:10:09,493
But his memory...

1355
02:10:10,454 --> 02:10:14,202
His memory will live with those natives
for the rest of their lives.

1356
02:10:14,416 --> 02:10:16,741
"The man who was not human,"
they called him.

1357
02:10:17,336 --> 02:10:20,253
They won't forget the stranger
who tried six times...

1358
02:10:20,339 --> 02:10:24,206
...to climb a mountain pass
that no other human being dared to travel.

1359
02:10:24,301 --> 02:10:27,670
And six times was forced back
by the severest storms.

1360
02:10:28,305 --> 02:10:31,674
They won't forget the madman
who stole their food and clothing.

1361
02:10:31,767 --> 02:10:35,301
Who they locked up in their barracks
and who fought six guards to escape.

1362
02:10:35,395 --> 02:10:38,978
Their soldiers are still talking
about their pursuit to overtake him...

1363
02:10:39,066 --> 02:10:40,975
...and shuddering at the memory.

1364
02:10:41,234 --> 02:10:44,235
He led them the wildest chase
through their own country.

1365
02:10:44,947 --> 02:10:49,443
Finally, he disappeared
over that very mountain pass...

1366
02:10:49,952 --> 02:10:53,036
...that they themselves dared not travel.

1367
02:10:54,164 --> 02:10:55,539
And that, gentlemen...

1368
02:10:55,791 --> 02:11:00,785
...was the last that any known
human being saw of Robert Conway.

1369
02:11:00,879 --> 02:11:02,457
That's what I call fortitude.

1370
02:11:02,547 --> 02:11:04,873
- Think of it.
- Tell me something, Gainsford.

1371
02:11:05,217 --> 02:11:09,215
What do you think of his talk
about Shangri-La? Do you believe it?

1372
02:11:12,307 --> 02:11:14,216
Yes. I believe it.

1373
02:11:14,601 --> 02:11:19,062
I believe it, because I want to believe it.

1374
02:11:21,566 --> 02:11:23,109
I give you a toast.

1375
02:11:24,569 --> 02:11:26,194
Here's my hope...

1376
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:30,569
...that Robert Conway
will find his Shangri-La.

1377
02:11:31,535 --> 02:11:33,362
Here's my hope...

1378
02:11:33,912 --> 02:11:37,246
...that we all find our Shangri-La.

1379
02:11:38,305 --> 02:12:38,603
