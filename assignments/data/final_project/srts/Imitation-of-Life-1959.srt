Didn't say anything
about a bill to me.
He was very polite.

He thought you were my maid.
Now he thinks I'm prosperous.

00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:52,259
Thank you. Only so far,
you're the only one
in New York who does.

301
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:55,327
But someday I'm going to
make them all feel that way.

302
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:59,933
Aren't you a little late
getting started?
I mean, it's...

303
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,208
Yes, five years late.
That's why every day counts.

304
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:08,843
Why the five-year lapse?
My husband was
in the theater too.

305
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,150
A director.
A good director.

306
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:14,850
Everything I know
I owe to him.

307
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:18,827
It was a small town,
a little theater,
but professional.

308
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:23,195
When he died,
I had to make a living
doing something else.

309
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,258
I never really wanted
anything but the stage.

310
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:28,395
Oh, except Susie.

311
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:31,839
So, it took me five years
to save enough money
to come to New York.

312
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:33,967
But you did it.
Mm-hmm.

313
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:37,070
And I'm going to be an
actress, an important one...
<i>[Woman] Lora? </i>

314
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:39,081
[Woman]
Lora.
Oh, excuse me.

315
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:41,447
Nothing in it for me,
honey,

316
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:44,885
but they're
beginning to cast a new
Tennessee Williams play.

317
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:47,890
Oh, what agent?
Allen Loomis... today.

318
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,791
So put on
your roller skates.
Oh, thanks, Fay.

319
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:53,862
Coffee?
I'm sorry,
but I've got to go.

320
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,864
You haven't eaten.
You go ahead.
Good-bye.

321
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:57,866
How about dinner?
Tonight?
We'll take Susie.

322
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,902
Fine.
Where?

323
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,938
Come and have
dinner with us.
All right.

324
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,939
Good luck.
Thanks, Fay.

325
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,781
But when can I have
an appointment?

326
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:20,619
[Sighing]
How about a week
from today? Thursday.

327
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,218
Put me down.
It's Iris Dawn.
Don't forget it.

328
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:27,228
Tsk.

329
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:29,696
I'm sorry to add
to your troubles, but...

330
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:32,359
I'm afraid I'm a little late
for my appointment.

331
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:35,632
Name, please.
Miss Meredith.

332
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:38,003
Mered...
Meredith.

333
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:40,042
Well, I don't seem
to have you down.

334
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:43,203
Never mind.
Just tell Mr. Loomis
that Robert Hayes sent me.

335
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,680
Robert Hayes?
<i>From International</i>
<i>Studio. </i>

336
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:50,150
It's probably just a slipup
from the coast, but, uh,

337
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:52,153
Mr. Hayes won't
like it at all.

338
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:54,883
<i>I hope you didn't</i>
<i>slip up. </i>
Me?

339
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:58,586
Well, if you say
there's no appointment,
um, good-bye.

340
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,720
Well, just a second.

341
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:05,233
Why don't you sit down
and I'll see if I can
straighten this out?

342
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:07,496
Thank you.

343
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,504
Mr. Loomis?
Yes?

344
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,665
There's a Miss Meredith here
from Hollywood.

345
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:15,268
<i>[Receptionist Whispering]</i>
<i>Yes, quite lovely. </i>

346
00:21:15,344 --> 00:21:19,747
Think we should
send her away?
No. I think
you ought to see her.

347
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:22,409
Fine.
Okay.

348
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:27,888
Miss Meredith?
You can go in now.

349
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:35,222
Um, just right in.

350
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:37,357
Robert sends
his warmest greetings.

351
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:40,800
Well, thanks.
And how is he?
Marvelous.

352
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,328
He's lost 15 pounds.
You know what an effort
that is for him.

353
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:46,875
And, uh, what can
I do for you?

354
00:21:46,943 --> 00:21:52,006
Robert thought I shouldn't
do any more pictures before
I did a show on Broadway.

355
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:54,208
Very sensible.
<i>I'm glad</i>
<i>you think so too. </i>

356
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:58,617
That's why Robert
sent me to you.
He thought I'd get more...

357
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:01,555
personal attention
from you.

358
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:04,889
He could be right there.
You mind?
<i>No. </i>

359
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:07,555
Incidentally, how's the new
Tennessee Williams play?

360
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:13,034
Bound to be a blockbuster,
but all cast.
<i>[Buzzer Buzzing]</i>

361
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:16,833
Hello? Oh, Lillian!
What?

362
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:20,069
<i>Oh, well, </i>
<i>can't you break it? </i>

363
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:22,610
<i>Oh. No, I don't mind. </i>

364
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:26,808
I don't mind you
standing me up. I'm fine.
I'll just kill myself.

365
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:28,816
Yeah.

366
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:34,151
<i>Never be a bachelor. </i>
<i>There's no security. </i>
I know how you feel.

367
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:37,659
Yeah? Say, how'd you like
to go with me tonight?

368
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:40,161
I'm afraid I can't.

369
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:42,322
Big party.
Lots of important people.

370
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:47,131
Well, I could see if I could
break a couple of engagements.

371
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:49,137
I'll call my place.

372
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:51,469
I'll call.
What's the number?

373
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,236
Montgomery,

374
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,278
76120.

375
00:22:56,345 --> 00:22:59,473
...One, two, oh.

<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

377
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:04,816
Miss Meredith's residence.

378
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:07,617
Oh, this <i>is</i>
Miss Meredith's residence?

379
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,456
That'll be Annie, my maid.
I'll talk to her.

380
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:20,493
Annie, uh, call
the Waldorf and tell, um,

381
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,800
you-know-who I cannot have
cocktails and dinner with him.

382
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:28,503
Uh, I know who?
Oh, yes, Miss Lora,
I'll do that.

383
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:31,045
Thank you.

384
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,138
Well, Mr. Loomis,
it looks like I'm free.

385
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:36,480
That'll be just fine.
Should be an interesting
evening for me.

386
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:40,488
Hollywood actress and...
Oh, that reminds me.
Excuse me.

<i>[Receptionist]</i>
<i>Yes, Mr. Loomis? </i>

Annette, get me Hollywood,
Mr. Robert Hayes.

389
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:49,130
International Studios,
right? International...
Um.

390
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:52,565
Maybe you better not
go through with that call.

391
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:55,763
You don't think so?
Why not?

392
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:57,829
[Sighing]

393
00:23:57,907 --> 00:24:00,967
Because Robert Hayes
doesn't exist.

394
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:05,537
I understand.
Annette, cancel the call.

395
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:07,548
<i>Yes, Mr. Loomis. </i>
I was desperate.

396
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:11,552
You were pretty good.
You lied. All actresses lie.
I know that.

397
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,646
But I believed you.
I'm sorry.

398
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:18,022
Don't leave.
You took me in.

399
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:21,029
For all of 20 seconds,
you took me in,
but I don't mind.

400
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:25,431
It was a good acting job,
and you're very pretty.

401
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:28,061
Now, about tonight.
Shall I pick you up?

402
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:31,698
Um, no, it'll be easier
for me to meet you here.

403
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:35,835
8:00?
You'll find me
very prompt, Mr. Loomis.

404
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:54,259
[Gate Thumping]

405
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:01,502
Come on in.

406
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,597
Sit down. I just have
a few letters to sign.

407
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:07,835
Oh, drink?
No, thank you.

408
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,210
But aren't we going
to be late to the party?
Plenty of time, plenty.

409
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:15,910
And I need a drink.
So relax.

410
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:19,079
<i>Say, you're not allergic</i>
<i>to mink, are you? </i>

Mink? No,
I don't think so.
<i>Good. </i>

But whose is it?
Mine. And I only loan it
to very special clients.

414
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:37,699
I want you to wear it
tonight.
You want me to wear...

415
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:39,707
Please. Got to think
of my reputation.

416
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:43,711
I haven't been seen
with a girl without a mink
since the heat wave of'39.

417
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:46,179
Come on.

418
00:25:46,248 --> 00:25:49,547
We should spend
a little time talking
about our future.

419
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:52,985
You can act. Well,
that's of no importance
at the moment.

420
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:55,888
The main thing is,
you're a beaut.

421
00:25:55,958 --> 00:26:00,019
Please, don't.
Oh, and you're decent too.

422

No doubt possess
some fine principles.

423
00:26:02,131 --> 00:26:04,395
Well, me, I'm a man
of very few principles,

424
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:06,900
and they're all open
to revision.

425
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:09,494
But I'm in a position
to do something for you.

426
00:26:09,572 --> 00:26:12,564
You'll get 10% of everything
I make. Isn't that enough?

427
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:15,132
No. Now,
sit down and listen.

428
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:21,883
Here it is, short and clear.
You're not a chicken.

429
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:23,942
You're no high-hearted kid
out of some drama school,

430
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,078
wanting to do or die
for dear old Thespis.

431
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:28,146
<i>And you're beginning</i>
<i>under a handicap. </i>

432
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,057
I know I'm starting late.
<i>So time isn't on your side. </i>

433
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:33,594
But you do have
some qualifications.

434
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:37,962
Your face will pass.
You've good, nice, long
silky legs. I like them.

435
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,524
You have a chest full
of quality and quantity.
I like it.

436
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:44,801
Aren't you taking
a few things for granted?
Me? I don't count.

437
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:47,808
But there are certain
people who do, and you're
going to meet all of them.

438
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:50,811
That is, if you're really
serious about your career.

439
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:54,440
I am, but...
Good, then you're going
every place with me.

440
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:57,280
Every party, opening night,
every saloon in town.

441
00:26:57,353 --> 00:27:00,322
With a complete new
wardrobe at my expense.

442
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:02,289
Oh, it's tax deductible.

443
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:04,918
This is a tough,
competitive racket.

444
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,929
Although it's a lot
more than any agent

to do with acting?
Nothing.

But I'll show you how to
realize your ambitions,
if you do as I say.

448

If the dramatists' club wants
to eat and sleep with you,
you eat and sleep with them.

449
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,138
If some producer with a hand
as cold as a toad wants to do
a painting of you in the nude,

450
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:26,147
you'll accommodate him
for a very small part.

451
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,547
It's disgusting!
It pays off.

452

You're disgusting.
Maybe I am.

453
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:34,555
But let me assure you,
once you get it made,

454
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:37,490
you can be idealistic
all of ten seconds
before you die.

But you won't. Not me.

Doing shirts

Oh, just fine. I went
to the 21 with Mr. Loomis.

471

Everybody there
was somebody exciting.

472
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,806
For the first time,
I felt that I was somebody too.

473

Is Mr. Loomis gonna
find you a job?

he wanted to represent me,

481
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:49,182
Can I help in any way?
No.

482
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:52,158
No one can.

483

No one.

00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:01,861
It was horrible.

He tried to make me

You could never
be cheap.

Yes, I do.

Not just in the theater.

I love the theater.
It's what I want.

So stale I can't believe
in them anymore.

M-Maybe I'm a fool.

and not as
I want them to be.

If I know you,
they'll have to be

Just a little experiment.

Experiment?
Sarah Jane's fault.

507
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:52,570
After class, one of the kids
said that Negro blood
was different.

508
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:56,674
So later this evenin',
Sarah Jane wanted to compare
her blood with Susie's.

509
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:59,345
Well, I spanked her good.

Why should I tell them?

00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:36,609
You're just
getting started and...

594
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:38,619
It would be foolish.

595
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:41,178
At least we'd
be foolish together.

596
00:37:41,256 --> 00:37:44,123
But marriage
is such a big step.

597
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:47,890
I want us to be together.
Well, we are,
most of the time.

598
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:50,591
Most of the time
you're out fighting
to get somewhere.

599
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,634
Breaking your heart,
trying to do for
yourself and Susie...

600
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:55,226
what I want to do for you,
what I finally
can do for you.

601
00:37:55,304 --> 00:37:58,705
Pardon me. I'm sorry.
Pardon me.
Oh!

602
00:37:58,774 --> 00:38:01,299
Well, wait a minute.

603
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:07,474
I want to give you a home,
take care of you, love you.

604
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:11,883
Oh, Steve, you
don't know me at all.

605
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:14,149
I still love the theater.

606
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:16,919
You tried it
and it's only hurt you.

607
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:18,926
Realize that
and you'll get over it.

608
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:22,725
I want to be honest
with you, darling.

609
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:25,460
I want more.

610
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:28,833
Everything.

611
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:30,838
Maybe too much.

612
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:33,500
Don't think I want any less.

613
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:37,272
So let's settle something
right now. Do you love me?

614
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:41,614
I think I do,
but...

617
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:47,985
I want to kiss you
so badly.

618
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:52,789
But if you did,
the way things are right now,

619
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:57,321
I might say something
I wouldn't really mean.

620
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:01,529
That's why
I want to kiss you.

<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:09,868
Hello?
Miss Meredith's residence.

624
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:14,846
- Who, Mr. Loomis?
- She's not in.

625
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:18,819
She isn't in, Mr. Loomis.
No, not even if it's important.

626
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:21,822
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>What? A job? </i>

627
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,326
l... I have to find out.
It could be something.

628
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:30,331
Yes, Mr. Loomis?

629
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:33,800
You look good with
a St. Bernard dog.
The St. Bernard dog?

630
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:35,803
Yes. Uh-huh.

631
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:38,806
Well, that's you
in the picture, isn't it?

632
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:41,308
Sprinkling flea powder?

633
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:43,844
All right, well, I'm here
with David Edwards.

634
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:45,777
David...
Edwards, yes.

635
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:48,180
You know,
the prize-winning playwright.

636
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,684
He saw that picture
in a magazine.

637
00:39:50,752 --> 00:39:54,688
He's looking for a girl with
that certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>
for his new play.

638
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:58,021
That certain something
you managed to get
with the dog.

639
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:01,995
It's not a big part, I know...
If this is one of
your jokes, Mr. Loomis...

640
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:04,999
Jokes? So help me,
I'm only thinking
percentage-wise.

641
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:07,501
The part calls for
about...
Two and a half.

642
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:10,003
Two-fifty a week.

643
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:13,405
I left the script with
my secretary. Can you
pick it up immediately?

644
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:15,966
Uh, yes.
Yes, Mr. Loomis.

645
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:17,978
Yes.

646
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:20,981
He wants me
to pick up a script;
I'm to audition tomorrow.

647
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:22,983
And you're going
down there?
Of course.

648
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:26,487
Even after what
happened last time?
This has
nothing to do with Loomis.

649
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:29,991
I'm to audition
for David Edwards.
How do you know that?

650
00:40:30,058 --> 00:40:31,992
I know. I just know.

651
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,996
But do you know if he's
gonna be any different
than Loomis?
No, I don't.

652
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:40,524
I don't want you to go.
Don't you realize what
this could mean to me?

653
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:44,038
I'm not asking you
not to go down there,
I'm <i>telling</i> you.

654
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:47,542
What makes you think
you have that right?
Because I love you.

655
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:50,544
Isn't that enough?
No, Steve, I'm sorry.
Good night.

656
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,812
Lora, wait.

657
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:58,319
I didn't mean
to sound dictatorial or
to try to run your life,

658
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:01,823
but you have to understand
how I feel.
And what about
the way I feel?

659
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,256
Oh, stop acting.
I'm not acting.

660
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:07,261
I want to achieve something,
something you'll never
understand.

661
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:10,821
What you're after isn't real.
At least
I'm after something!

662
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:14,335
Not the snapshot of
a disgusting old man with
a beer can on his belly.

663
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:17,839
Is that your idea
of achieving something?
Is a beer can "real"?

664
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:19,840
Going up and down,
up and down.

665
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:23,344
Well, I'm going up and up
and up, and nobody's
going to pull me down!

666
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:25,607
Lora, listen, please.

667
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:29,117
I've been trying to do
something with my pictures.
It's meant everything to me.

668
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:32,119
Every minute,
for a long time now.
No, it hasn't.

669
00:41:32,187 --> 00:41:35,315
Or you wouldn't
give it up to sell beer.

670
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:39,326
I gave it up for
something much better,
something right now: You.

671
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:42,830
But you're asking me
to give up something
I've wanted all my life,

672
00:41:42,898 --> 00:41:45,833
ever since I was a child,
and I can't do it!

673
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:47,835
If you grew up,
you could.

674
00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:51,171
What do you mean?

675
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:54,308
You're not
a child anymore,

676
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:57,311
and I might not be around
to pick up the pieces
this time.

677
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:59,313
Good.

678
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:02,111
I'd like it that way.
Forever.

679
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:21,869
Joseph and Mary couldn't
find no place at the inn,

680
00:42:21,937 --> 00:42:25,373
so they had to go to the
stable among the animals.

681
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,374
The animals?
Mm-hmm.

682
00:42:27,442 --> 00:42:30,377
And in the manger
Jesus was born.

683
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:34,040
<i>And the heavenly hosts</i>
<i>sang, "Hallelujah. "</i>

<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

687
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:51,023
Hello?
Hello, Annie.

688
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:54,262
- Oh, hello, Mr. Steve.
- Has she come in yet?

689
00:42:54,336 --> 00:42:56,463
I'm sorry.

690
00:42:56,538 --> 00:42:58,472
I see.

691
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,599
Well, Merry Christmas,
Annie.

692
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:02,802
Merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Steve.

00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:05,904
Mommy, isn't Steve
coming here tonight?

694
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:08,916
I think you'd better
go to bed, both of you.

695
00:43:08,984 --> 00:43:11,350
But Annie was
telling us a story.

696
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,355
Oh, all right,
Annie can finish it.
Where were we?

697
00:43:14,423 --> 00:43:16,687
- Jesus was almost borned.
- That's right.

698
00:43:16,758 --> 00:43:21,957
As soon as the holy infant
was born, three wise men saw
a beautiful star in the sky.

699
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,965
The star
of Bethlehem...
Was Jesus white or black?

700
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:27,968
It doesn't matter.
He's the way
you imagine him.

701
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:30,698
But Annie said
he was a real man.

702
00:43:30,772 --> 00:43:32,706
He's not a pretend man.

703
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:34,833
He was real.
He <i>is</i> real.

704
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,844
Then what color was he?

705
00:43:36,912 --> 00:43:39,346
He was like me...
White.

706
00:43:43,514 --> 00:43:46,415
Now, the closet door
is over here.

707
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:49,646
The clothes closet door
is over there.

708
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,655
The door to your bedroom
is over here.

709
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:56,159
And you trip over
the vacuum cleaner
over there.

710
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:01,053
All right,
come on, let's have
your offstage line.

711
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:08,998

713
00:44:14,511 --> 00:44:17,446
Colonel, what are you
doing in there?

714
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:22,618
Why, Mr. Obermeyer,
why aren't you in Duluth?

715
00:44:25,822 --> 00:44:27,756
Oh, Herbert, you too?

716
00:44:27,824 --> 00:44:30,486
<i>No! No, no, </i>
<i>Miss Meredith. </i>

She can do it, David.
I guarantee it.

718
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:35,855
She's just
a little nervous.
Miss Meredith.

719
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:38,026
Yes, sir?

720
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:41,764
This scene is supposed to
be played for high comedy,
with delicate reactions,

721
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:43,772
not loud,
goggle-eyed takes.

722

I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards.

But I'm an actress,
and a good one.

724
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:55,178
But I couldn't play
this part for high comedy.
Nobody could.

725
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:58,949
<i>Nobody. </i>
I think that's all,
Miss Meredith.

726
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:01,957
<i>And if you'll forgive me</i>
<i>for saying it, </i>

727
00:45:02,025 --> 00:45:04,960
you're too good a writer
to have such a scene
in your play.

728
00:45:05,028 --> 00:45:07,861
Okay, sister,
this way out.

729
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:12,425
I might as well confess...
She's not really my client.
Tell her to wait a minute.

730
00:45:16,974 --> 00:45:20,933
Lora!
Lora, wait a minute.

731
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:23,946
I think we've still
got a chance.
No, I don't...

732
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:25,948
Miss Meredith.

733
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:30,415
It's been a long time
since anyone told me off.

734
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:33,923
Tell me, what would you do
with that scene?

735
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:38,727
I'd cut it out.
Drop it entirely.

736
00:45:39,796 --> 00:45:42,924
That's not a bad idea.
Let me think.

737
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,834
Yes, but the scene
has a couple of lines
that are important.

738
00:45:46,903 --> 00:45:48,837
Give them to Amy.

739
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:52,066

honey.

1035
01:04:11,406 --> 01:04:15,342
If that headache ain't gone
in an hour's time,
you take another aspirin.

1036
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:18,504
You hear?
Yes, Mama.
Have a good time.

1037
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:21,014
Mama.
Yes, baby?

1038
01:04:21,082 --> 01:04:25,178
Tell 'em I'm... I'm sorry
I had to miss the picnic.

1039
01:04:25,253 --> 01:04:27,187
Okay. Okay.

1040
01:04:46,274 --> 01:04:49,710
But by the time I find Steve
the fire'll be just perfect.

1041
01:04:49,777 --> 01:04:52,746
You let them alone.
Maybe they got things
to talk about.

1042
01:04:52,814 --> 01:04:54,748
This is
a fine picnic.

1043
01:04:54,816 --> 01:04:59,753
Sarah Jane announces
she's getting the flu.
Mom and Steve just go off.

1044
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:04,258
Oh, well, if this is the way
it's gonna be, I might as
well get on with my list.

1045
01:05:04,325 --> 01:05:09,262
I can cross off pink sweater
for Elizabeth and yellow
sweater for Sarah Jane.

1046
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,264
Then we skip ahead
to algebra.

1047
01:05:11,332 --> 01:05:15,268
Do you think another year of
that stuff is a good idea?
I sure do.

1048
01:05:15,336 --> 01:05:18,772
It's gonna come in
mighty handy with prices
always goin' up.

1049
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,274
Which brings us
back to boys.

1050
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:24,277
What do you think
about kissing, Annie?
[Laughs]

1051
01:05:24,345 --> 01:05:28,042
Well, there's kissin'
and <i>kissin'. </i>

1052
01:05:28,116 --> 01:05:31,051
I still take pictures
every chance I get.

1053
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,553
Still trying
to get them exhibited.
Stop hedging.

1054
01:05:33,621 --> 01:05:35,555
What is your job,
really?

1055
01:05:35,623 --> 01:05:38,558
I'm Vice President
in Charge of Advertising
for P.C. Beer.

1056
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:41,561
Don't tell anybody.
Why not?
I think it's wonderful.

1057
01:05:41,629 --> 01:05:46,328
'Cause I'm quitting
just as soon as I can
wind things up.
But why?

1058
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:49,837
You ever get the feeling
that you're tired of
what you're doing,

1059
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,338
that it isn't all
you really wanted?

1060
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:56,343
Did you ever get the urge
not to do what you don't
want to do?

1061
01:05:56,411 --> 01:06:00,347
To let yourself go
and follow the wind
or a star,

1062
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,849
maybe even
a dusty old rainbow?

1063
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,851
Yes.

1064
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,853
Well, that's why
I'm going.

1065
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,855
Where to?

1066
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:12,290
I don't know.
Around the world,
I guess, for a start.

1067
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,294
You going alone?

1068
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:18,924
I'm afraid so, l...
I went through my entire
little black book.

1069
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,935
Well, you shouldn't have
skipped my name.

1070
01:06:23,037 --> 01:06:26,871
l... I don't know why
I said that, Steve,

1071
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:30,377
except that
I haven't been this happy
with anyone for years.

1072
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:35,007
You know I still have you
in my blood, don't you?
Oh, Steve, do you really?

1073
01:06:36,584 --> 01:06:39,018
I never got over you,
Lora.

1074
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:42,181
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't.

1075
01:06:45,093 --> 01:06:48,529
There's a kind of kissin'
that's not careless
and doesn't lead to harm,

1076
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:51,531
when the two people kissin'
are nice and right.

1077
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,533
Kissin' is part of
fallin' in love.

1078
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:56,035
The Lord
wants his children
to fall in love,

1079
01:06:56,104 --> 01:06:58,538
when they're old enough
and got sense enough.

1080
01:06:58,606 --> 01:07:01,541
Then kissin' is like
yeast is to bread...

1081
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:05,204
Pardon me, Annie,
but I'm starving.
Can't I please find Steve?

1082
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:07,213
Don't think
you'll have to.

1083
01:07:07,281 --> 01:07:11,149
Steve! It's time
to cook the steaks!
Even Annie says so!

1084
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:13,153
[Lora, Susie Giggling]

1085
01:07:13,221 --> 01:07:16,156
Telling them
will be wonderful,
but Loomis, ohh.

1086
01:07:16,224 --> 01:07:20,160
Why tell him at all?
He has a lot of commitments
he'll have to get me out of.

1087
01:07:20,228 --> 01:07:23,493
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>Susie, will you go see</i>
<i>how Sarah Jane is? </i>

1088
01:07:23,564 --> 01:07:26,328
Tell her
I'll be right up.
Okay.

1089
01:07:27,635 --> 01:07:31,162
Let me help you
with that.
Thank you, honey.

1090
01:07:34,242 --> 01:07:36,767
Hello, Allen?
l...

1091
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,779
You've been trying
to call me?

1092
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,281
I'm sorry.
We've been out all day.

1093
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,841
<i>When? </i>

1094
01:07:44,919 --> 01:07:49,356
Oh. Well, that sounds
simply marvelous, but...

1095
01:07:49,424 --> 01:07:52,359
Uh, no, not for dinner.
I'm having guests.

1096
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,629
Why don't you bring him
for cocktails.

1097
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:59,188
Yes. All right.

1098
01:08:00,935 --> 01:08:04,132
Steve!
Amerigo Felluci!

1099
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,673
The Italian
movie director.
<i>Yes. </i>

1100
01:08:06,741 --> 01:08:11,201
Oh, he wants me
for the part of Rena
in <i>No More Laughter. </i>

1101
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:15,613
<i>His agent is in New York</i>
<i>now to talk to me about it. </i>
I see.

1102
01:08:15,683 --> 01:08:19,119
- That means you'd
have to go to Italy.
- Mmm. Of course.

1103
01:08:20,354 --> 01:08:22,288
Oh.

1104
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:27,490
Well, I'll have to
give a two-week notice
to the play.

1105
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,826
Yes.

1106
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,058
Well,
don't be so calm.

1107
01:08:32,133 --> 01:08:34,067
They want me
for Rena!

1108
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:38,572
Well, who is she?
Only the best part
since Scarlett O'Hara.

1109
01:08:42,777 --> 01:08:45,678
Sarah Jane?

1110
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:08,968
Sarah Jane!
Where have you been?

1111
01:09:09,036 --> 01:09:12,972
I've been looking all over
for you! You're supposed
to be in bed...
Shh!

1112
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,048
Uh...

1113
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,050
Sit down.

1114
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,887
Cross your heart.

1115
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:32,358
You won't tell my mama?
No, I won't
tell Annie.

1116
01:09:32,426 --> 01:09:34,860
W-Well, what is it?

1117
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,730
I've been out.

1118
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:41,199
With my boyfriend.

1119
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:45,204
Boyfriend?
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend!

1120
01:09:45,272 --> 01:09:48,400
- Where's he from?
- The Village.

1121
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:51,912
Oh. Did you meet him
in school?
<i>School? </i>

1122
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,914
No.

1123
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,917
There's an ice cream
parlor in The Village
with a jukebox.

1124
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:01,148
Yeah?
And he used to
stand outside,

1125
01:10:01,222 --> 01:10:05,488
and every time I'd walk by,
he'd whistle!
No kidding!

1126
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:09,495
But first I pretended he
wasn't on earth.
Yeah?
[Giggles]

1127
01:10:09,563 --> 01:10:12,498
But finally I had to laugh,
and he followed me.
<music> [Orchestra]

1128
01:10:12,566 --> 01:10:15,000
And we started to talk.

1129
01:10:15,069 --> 01:10:18,402
He's cute.
<i>Really</i> cute.
[Sighs]

1130
01:10:18,472 --> 01:10:20,406
Is he a colored boy?

1131
01:10:20,474 --> 01:10:23,739
Why did you ask that?
Well, I don't know.

1132
01:10:23,811 --> 01:10:26,746
It just slipped out.
It was the first thing
you thought of.

1133
01:10:26,814 --> 01:10:29,749
I told you,
it just slipped out!
Well, he's white.

1134
01:10:29,817 --> 01:10:34,754
And if he ever finds out
about me, I'll kill myself.
But why?

1135
01:10:34,822 --> 01:10:38,553
Because I'm white too.
And if I have to be colored,
then I want to die.

1136
01:10:38,626 --> 01:10:41,595
What are you saying?
I wanna have
a chance in life.

1137
01:10:41,662 --> 01:10:45,257
I don't wanna have to
come through back doors,
feel lower than other people,

1138
01:10:45,332 --> 01:10:48,267
or apologize
for my mother's color.
Don't say that!

1139
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:51,498
She can't help her color,
but I can.

1140
01:10:51,572 --> 01:10:53,506
And I will.

1141
01:10:53,574 --> 01:10:56,008
But we've always
talked things over.

1142
01:10:56,076 --> 01:10:58,704
You never told me
this before.

1143
01:10:58,779 --> 01:11:00,713
<music> [Continues]

1144
01:11:02,783 --> 01:11:05,718
Because I've never had
a boyfriend before.

1145
01:11:07,288 --> 01:11:10,155
Because he wants to
marry me someday.

1146
01:11:11,659 --> 01:11:14,594
A white boy.
Me.

1147
01:11:14,662 --> 01:11:19,395
But how do you think
he'd feel, or his folks,
with a black in-law?

1148
01:11:19,466 --> 01:11:23,402
What do you think people
would say where we lived
if they knew my mother...

1149
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:27,668
They'd spit at me.
And my children.

1150
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,676
Sarah Jane,
you know that's not true!
It is.

1151
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:33,178
That's why
he mustn't know her.

1152
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,681
I don't want anybody
to know her.

1153
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:39,685
What if he comes here?
He doesn't even know
where I live.

1154
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:43,189
I pretend I'm a...
I'm a rich girl
with strict parents.

1155
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,885
Well, he's bound
to find out...
How?

1156
01:11:47,194 --> 01:11:50,186
I'm going to be everything
he thinks I am.

1157
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,427
I look it, and that's
all that matters.

1158
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,936
And you're not to say
anything either.
I won't. You know I won't.

1159
01:11:57,004 --> 01:11:58,938
I never did, but...

1160
01:11:59,006 --> 01:12:02,601
Sarah Jane,
if Mama ever found out
she'd never stand for it.

1161
01:12:02,676 --> 01:12:04,610
I don't care.

like good-bye.

Why couldn't
we meet in Italy?
What for?

Why do you say that?

1177
01:13:08,636 --> 01:13:12,163
I met him at the station
the other day
and he asked about you.

1178
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:15,174
No.
It's with someone else.

1179
01:13:15,242 --> 01:13:17,176
Oh.

1180
01:13:17,244 --> 01:13:20,680
All right, you run along.
I'll try to manage here.
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

1181
01:13:20,748 --> 01:13:22,682
Oh, there they are.

1182
01:13:33,627 --> 01:13:37,654
Look, honey, why don't you
go over to the party
at the church?

1183
01:13:37,731 --> 01:13:39,665
They bore me.

1184
01:13:39,733 --> 01:13:44,670
You're makin' a big mistake.
You're young. You shouldn't
be sittin' around.

1185
01:13:44,738 --> 01:13:46,672
Miss Lora
feels the same way.

1186
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:51,677
She'll lend you
her car.
Oh, she will?
How nice of her.

1187
01:13:51,745 --> 01:13:54,680
I'd be happy knowin'
you're meetin'
nice young folks.

1188
01:13:54,748 --> 01:13:57,683
Busboys, cooks,
chauffeurs!

1189
01:13:57,751 --> 01:14:00,686
Hmph.
Like Hawkins.

1190
01:14:00,754 --> 01:14:04,190
No, thank you.
I've seen your
"nice young folks."

1191
01:14:05,326 --> 01:14:08,261
I don't wanna fight
with you, honey.

1192
01:14:08,329 --> 01:14:10,194
Not tonight.

1193
01:14:10,264 --> 01:14:12,198
I don't feel too good.

1194
01:14:12,266 --> 01:14:14,700
While I get started
on the anchovies,

1195
01:14:14,768 --> 01:14:17,703
will you take this tray
into Miss Lora
and her friends?

1196
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:19,705
Why, certainly.

1197
01:14:19,773 --> 01:14:22,708
Anything at all
for Miss Lora
and her friends.

1198
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:28,915
But signor Romano, why should
she need rehearsals?
<i>Ma scusa, signor. </i>

1199
01:14:28,983 --> 01:14:30,917
You know her work.

1200
01:14:30,985 --> 01:14:33,613
Felluci always insists
on two weeks' rehearsal.

1201
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:37,350
Pictures are a different
medium than the stage.
She will need rehearsal...

1202
01:14:39,927 --> 01:14:44,091
Fetched y'all a mess
of crawdads, Miss Lora,
for you and yo' friends.

1203
01:14:44,164 --> 01:14:48,157
That's quite a trick,
Sarah Jane.
Where did you learn it?

1204
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:50,669
Oh, no trick to totin',
Miss Lora.

1205
01:14:50,738 --> 01:14:52,672
I learned it
from my mammy,

1206
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:56,676
and she learned it
from old massa 'fore
she belonged to you.

1207
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:02,515
Well...
Excuse me.

1208
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:09,455
Another drink,
Sr. Romano?

1209
01:15:11,325 --> 01:15:14,761
Sarah Jane,
why did you do that?

1210
01:15:14,828 --> 01:15:17,262
What's the matter
with you?

1211
01:15:17,331 --> 01:15:20,596
Annie, did you see
what she did?
I heard her.

1212
01:15:20,668 --> 01:15:24,104
You and my mother
are so anxious for me
to be colored.

1213
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:28,608
I was going to show you
I could be.

1214
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:35,979
You weren't being
colored.

1215
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,984
You were being
childish.

1216
01:15:38,052 --> 01:15:41,988
I don't understand why
you would want to hurt
your mother or me.

1217
01:15:42,056 --> 01:15:44,991
I told her
she has to be patient.

1218
01:15:45,059 --> 01:15:46,993
Things will work out.
How?

1219
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:52,329
Miss Lora, you don't know
what it means to be...

1220
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:54,333
different.

1221
01:15:54,401 --> 01:15:59,065
Have I ever treated you
as if you were different?
Has Susie? Has anyone here?

1222
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:03,343
No.

1223
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:05,344
You've been wonderful,
but...

1224
01:16:05,412 --> 01:16:08,347
Then don't ever do this
to us again.

1225
01:16:08,415 --> 01:16:10,280
Or to yourself.

1226
01:16:12,019 --> 01:16:14,453
It won't solve anything,
Sarah Jane.

1227
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,774
Mama?

1228
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:37,943
Oh, please.

1230
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:45,610

to hurt you.

I love you.

1232

Oh, I know, baby.

1233
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:54,487
You're just like
a puppy that's been
cooped up too much.

1234
01:16:55,662 --> 01:16:59,598
That's why I wanted you
to go to the party.

That's not a bad idea.

one thing.

It was her boyfriend.
Boyfriend?

Yes. He found out

1620
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:51,115
My plane's leaving
in a little while,
Miss Linda.

1621
01:42:53,351 --> 01:42:56,320
[Whispering]
Good-bye, honey.

1622
01:42:56,388 --> 01:42:59,846
You take good care
of yourself.

1623
01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:02,086
Good-bye.

1624
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:04,094
[Whispers]
Mama.

1625
01:43:09,601 --> 01:43:12,297
Well! Get you.

1626
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:16,204
[Southern Accent]
So, honey child,
you had a mammy.

1627
01:43:16,274 --> 01:43:18,208
Yes.

1628
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:21,378
All my life.

1629
01:43:31,451 --> 01:43:33,510
Hello, Steve.

1630
01:43:33,587 --> 01:43:35,521
Hello, Lora.

1631
01:43:37,024 --> 01:43:39,788
Some of my girlfriends
get embarrassed
when their mothers...

1632
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:42,454
wear shorts or capri pants,
things like that.

1633
01:43:42,529 --> 01:43:45,589
I really don't mind.
[Giggling]
That's very big of you.

1634
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:49,067
I mixed you a highball,
but you only get one
before lunch.

1635
01:43:49,136 --> 01:43:51,798
Yes, ma'am.
I just had a call
from Loomis.

1636
01:43:51,872 --> 01:43:55,137
Don't say a word.
He's got a new role for you.
No, no.

1637
01:43:55,208 --> 01:43:57,142
<i>Highball? </i>
Yes.

1638
01:43:57,210 --> 01:43:59,576
No, they've flown over a print
of the Italian picture.

1639
01:43:59,646 --> 01:44:03,480
He's arranged
a special showing tonight,
and a party afterwards.

1640
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:05,745
Darling, I'd like you
to see it too,

1641
01:44:05,819 --> 01:44:08,151
but I'm worried
about Annie.

1642
01:44:08,221 --> 01:44:11,315
Ever since she came
back from Los Angeles,
she's changed.

1643
01:44:11,391 --> 01:44:14,690
Dr. Miller's quite concerned
about her condition.

1644
01:44:14,761 --> 01:44:18,697
I think someone should stay
in the house with her tonight.
Do you mind?

1645
01:44:18,765 --> 01:44:21,825
No, of course not, Mama.
I'll see you tomorrow, Steve?

1646
01:44:21,902 --> 01:44:24,496
Sure.

1647
01:44:24,571 --> 01:44:27,506
What can we do
to help Annie, Steve?

1648
01:44:27,574 --> 01:44:31,101
There's no answer, Lora,
never has been.

1649
01:44:31,178 --> 01:44:33,112
Not for a broken heart.

1650
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:35,614
Mmm, and I know Mother
didn't understand.

1651
01:44:35,682 --> 01:44:38,048
Oh, it was so embarrassing.
And poor Steve.

1652
01:44:38,118 --> 01:44:41,713
I mean, what could he do?
She just swept over him
like a tidal wave.

1653
01:44:41,788 --> 01:44:45,815
Honey, it's only natural
he'd like to go out
with your mother.

1654
01:44:45,892 --> 01:44:49,555
He always enjoyed her company.
You remember that.

1655
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:51,598
But it's different now.

1656
01:44:51,665 --> 01:44:53,860
All summer long
it's been Steve and me.

1657
01:44:55,135 --> 01:44:58,730
- Annie, you know, don't you?
- Know what?

1658
01:44:58,805 --> 01:45:03,674
That I'm in love with Steve.
I've always been in love
with him and always will be.

1659
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,406
Sure, Susie,

1660
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,812
but like a little girl.

1661
01:45:08,882 --> 01:45:12,113
<i>No. I don't think</i>
<i>it even started like that. </i>

1662
01:45:12,185 --> 01:45:15,416
In a funny way,
I always knew.

1663
01:45:15,489 --> 01:45:19,425
Every time I thought
I liked a boy, it was because
he reminded me of Steve.

1664
01:45:19,493 --> 01:45:23,020
And then I'd stop
liking him because...

1665
01:45:23,096 --> 01:45:25,189
Because he wasn't Steve.

1666
01:46:41,108 --> 01:46:43,042
[Knocking]

1667
01:46:44,911 --> 01:46:47,539
Susie?
Are you up, darling?

1668
01:46:47,614 --> 01:46:49,673
<i>Yes. </i>

1669
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:53,277
I just had to tell you.
I have the most wonderful news.

1670
01:46:53,353 --> 01:46:56,220
You're going to do
another picture.
No.

1671
01:46:56,289 --> 01:47:00,453
Not a picture,
not a play,
never again.

1672
01:47:00,527 --> 01:47:04,554
Oh, I know you
don't believe me.
I can't blame you.

1673
01:47:04,631 --> 01:47:08,260
Steve didn't either.
He probably won't until
our tenth anniversary.

1674
01:47:09,836 --> 01:47:11,770
A-Anniversary?

1675
01:47:11,838 --> 01:47:15,239
Oh, Steve and I have
always been in love.

1676
01:47:15,308 --> 01:47:19,711
But it seems I've never
had time for anything
but my work.

1677
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:23,807
So I just up and proposed
that we get married.

1678
01:47:25,619 --> 01:47:29,180
<i>Well, Susie, </i>
<i>what's the matter? </i>
<i>Are you all right? </i>

1679
01:47:29,256 --> 01:47:32,919
Yes, I'm fine.
I hope you'll be very happy.

1680
01:47:32,993 --> 01:47:35,826
Oh, we will be,
all of us.

1681
01:47:37,831 --> 01:47:40,493
What is it, darling?
Tell me.

1682
01:47:40,567 --> 01:47:43,001
I'm very tired.
Good night, Mother.

1683
01:47:45,572 --> 01:47:47,506
Good night, dear.

1684
01:47:56,950 --> 01:47:58,884
[Sobs]

1685
01:48:06,226 --> 01:48:10,629
You know, Annie,
last night when I told
Susie the news,

1686
01:48:12,132 --> 01:48:14,464
she was like ice.

1687
01:48:14,534 --> 01:48:18,402
It's strange.
l... I thought she
would be ecstatic.

1688
01:48:20,907 --> 01:48:24,468
She always seemed to...
To adore Steve.

1689
01:48:28,114 --> 01:48:31,515
Something's wrong
with her, Annie.

1690
01:48:31,585 --> 01:48:33,519
Do you know what it is?

1691
01:48:35,355 --> 01:48:40,657
Miss Lora, you've got
to be very careful
the way you handle Susie.

1692
01:48:40,727 --> 01:48:43,662
She's got
a real problem.
Problem?

1693
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:47,166
Why don't I know about it?
Why didn't she come to me?

1694
01:48:47,234 --> 01:48:49,828
Maybe because
you weren't around.

1695
01:48:51,171 --> 01:48:53,867
You mean, l...

1696
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:55,874
I haven't been
a good mother.

1697
01:48:55,942 --> 01:48:58,843
I know you meant
to be a good mother,

1698
01:48:58,912 --> 01:49:01,142
the best kind of mother,

1699
01:49:01,214 --> 01:49:05,947
but look, I meant to
be a good one too,
and I failed.

1700
01:49:06,019 --> 01:49:09,386
But you couldn't have been
a better mother to Sarah Jane.

1701
01:49:09,456 --> 01:49:13,722
- Then where's
my little girl?
- But Annie, that's different.

1702
01:49:13,793 --> 01:49:16,125
Hers is
a very real problem.

1703
01:49:16,196 --> 01:49:18,221
What's complicated
Susie's life?

1704
01:49:18,298 --> 01:49:21,631
We made a home for her;
the prettiest clothes;
the best schools.

1705
01:49:21,701 --> 01:49:25,728
- Susie's in love.
- Oh, Annie.

1706
01:49:25,805 --> 01:49:28,740
Is that all?
Why didn't you say so?

1707
01:49:28,808 --> 01:49:31,936
<i>It's not unusual for a girl</i>
<i>Susie's age to be in love. </i>

1708
01:49:32,012 --> 01:49:35,504
It's who she's in love with
that's causing all the trouble.

1709
01:49:35,582 --> 01:49:39,211
Why? Who is it?

1710
01:49:40,287 --> 01:49:42,221
Mr. Steve.

1711
01:49:44,257 --> 01:49:46,748
What?

1712
01:49:46,826 --> 01:49:49,260
That's impossible.

1713
01:49:49,329 --> 01:49:52,093
How did it happen?
Why did he let it happen?

1714
01:49:52,165 --> 01:49:54,429
I don't think he knows.

1715
01:49:54,501 --> 01:49:56,901
Annie, it can't
be serious!

1716
01:49:56,970 --> 01:49:59,996
It is, Miss Lora.
Plenty serious.

1717
01:50:00,073 --> 01:50:03,008
I better have a talk
with Susie right now.

1718
01:50:03,076 --> 01:50:05,169
Wait, wait.
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

1719
01:50:05,245 --> 01:50:08,339
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

1720
01:50:08,415 --> 01:50:10,542
Susie.

1721
01:50:10,617 --> 01:50:12,744
I've just spoken
to Annie.
Have you?

1722
01:50:12,819 --> 01:50:16,152
Now I know why you were
so upset last night.
So Annie told you.

1723
01:50:16,222 --> 01:50:19,714
That's how you usually
find things out about me.
That's not true!

1724
01:50:19,793 --> 01:50:22,660
Let's face it, Mama.
Annie's always been more
like a real mother.

1725
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:26,187
You never had time for me.
By the way, is this
worded correctly?

1726
01:50:29,502 --> 01:50:32,164
An application
to college?
Uh-huh.

1727
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:34,729
But you're going
to study in New York.

1728
01:50:34,808 --> 01:50:37,106
Denver...
It's 1,500 miles away.

1729
01:50:37,177 --> 01:50:39,338
1,628, to be exact.
That's quite a distance.

1730
01:50:39,412 --> 01:50:42,609
I don't think
I'll be missed.
Don't be unfair, Susie.

1731
01:50:42,682 --> 01:50:45,515
You know I'd miss you.
I'm sure you'd be too busy
to miss anyone.

1732
01:50:45,585 --> 01:50:47,576
Much too busy.

1733
01:50:47,654 --> 01:50:49,918
You give me credit
for nothing.

1734
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:52,788
Yes, I'm ambitious,
perhaps too ambitious,

1735
01:50:52,859 --> 01:50:55,350
but it's been for your sake
as well as mine.

1736
01:50:55,428 --> 01:50:58,363
Isn't this house
just a little bit nicer
than a cold-water flat?

1737
01:50:58,431 --> 01:51:00,865
And your new horse.
Aren't you crazy about it?
Yes, but l...

1738
01:51:00,934 --> 01:51:04,131
And that closet of yours...
Has all the dresses fit for
the daughter of a famous star.

1739
01:51:04,204 --> 01:51:06,138
Now, just a moment,
young lady.

1740
01:51:06,206 --> 01:51:09,471
It's only because
of my ambition that you've
had the best of everything.

1741
01:51:09,542 --> 01:51:12,773
That's a solid achievement
that any mother can be proud of.

1742
01:51:12,846 --> 01:51:14,780
How about a mother's love?

1743
01:51:14,848 --> 01:51:18,045
Love? But you've
always had that!

1744
01:51:18,118 --> 01:51:20,814
Yes, by telephone, postcard,
magazine interviews.

1745
01:51:20,887 --> 01:51:24,050
You've given me everything
but yourself.

1746
01:51:24,124 --> 01:51:28,788
No wonder I went to Annie
last night when I told her
about Steve.

1747
01:51:28,862 --> 01:51:30,796
Oh, Susie.

1748
01:51:33,967 --> 01:51:36,401
If Steve is going
to come between us,

1749
01:51:38,705 --> 01:51:40,900
I'll give him up.

1750
01:51:40,974 --> 01:51:43,135
I'll never see him again.

1751
01:51:43,209 --> 01:51:45,905
Oh, Mama, stop acting!

1752
01:51:45,979 --> 01:51:49,346
Stop trying to shift people
around as if they were pawns
on a stage.

1753
01:51:49,416 --> 01:51:51,850
But, Susie, l...
Don't worry,
I'll get over Steve,

1754
01:51:51,918 --> 01:51:54,352
but please,
don't play the martyr.

1755
01:51:59,025 --> 01:52:03,462
Oh, Mama, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to hurt you.

1756
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:07,364
But last night
I was so unhappy!
[Sobbing]

1757
01:52:08,935 --> 01:52:10,869
Oh, darling.

1758
01:52:12,505 --> 01:52:15,338
l... I don't know.

1759
01:52:15,408 --> 01:52:18,036
Maybe it was all
to the good because...

1760
01:52:18,111 --> 01:52:22,047
this morning I felt
strangely independent and...

1761
01:52:22,115 --> 01:52:24,549
Well, I like the feeling.

1762
01:52:24,617 --> 01:52:27,609
That's why I think I'd...
I'd like to go away,

1763
01:52:27,687 --> 01:52:29,746
at least for a while.

1764
01:52:29,823 --> 01:52:32,485
Oh, Mama, please try
to understand.

1765
01:52:32,559 --> 01:52:34,493
I'm very sincere
