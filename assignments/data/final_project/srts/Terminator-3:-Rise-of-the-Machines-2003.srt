1
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,626
The future has not been written.

2
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:54,602
There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

3
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,250
I wish I could believe that.

4
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,958
My name is John Connor.

5
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,698
They tried to murder me before I was born.

6
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,161
When I was 13, they tried again.

7
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:29,432
Machines from the future.

8
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,236
Terminators.

9
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:36,938
All my life, my mother told me
the storm was coming.

10
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,379
- Judgment Day.
- Connor!

11
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:43,444
The beginning of a war
between man and machines.

12
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,125
Three billion lives
would vanish in an instant.

13
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:55,423
And I would lead what was left
of the human race to ultimate victory.

14
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,631
It hasn't happened.

15
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,198
No bombs fell.

16
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:05,901
Computers didn't take control.

17
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,270
We stopped Judgment Day.

18
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:15,545
I should feel safe...

19
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,654
...but I don't.

20
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,787
So I live off the grid.

21
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:27,490
No phone, no address.

22
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:32,330
No one and nothing can find me.

23
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:36,805
I've erased all connections to the past.

24
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,340
But as hard as I try...

25
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,705
...I can't erase my dreams...

26
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:46,750
...my nightmares.

27
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:03,491
I feel the weight of the future
bearing down on me.

28
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,156
A future I don't want.

29
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:09,926
So I keep running...

30
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,072
...as fast as I can.

31
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,702
Anywhere.

32
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:18,208
Nowhere.

33
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:03,978
Oh, my God.

34
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:06,017
Are you okay?

35
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:09,282
Do you want me to call 911?

36
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:14,459
I like this car.

37
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:17,693
What are you--?

38
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:24,055
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

39
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,565
Slow down and pull over immediately.

40
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:02,469
Lady, have you any idea
how fast you were going?

41
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:04,606
Let me see your license and registration.

42
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:09,912
I like your gun.

43
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,277
What?

44
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:17,819
This stupid thing's not working.

45
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:21,219
What's wrong with this thing?

46
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:24,554
I hate machines.

47
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,490
- Hello?
- Kate, it's your father.

48
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,996
You're blowing me off again.

49
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,364
I'm so sorry. You know how much
I wanted to see you this weekend.

50
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,500
- But we're having computer problems--
- I know, you can't talk about it.

51
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,176
It's just...

52
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:46,278
...Scott was really looking forward to this.

53
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:51,453
Katie. I wish I had more time
to get to know him. I really do.

54
00:09:51,622 --> 00:09:55,490
That's okay. You're bound
to run into him at the wedding.

55
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:58,894
Please. I'm still
in a state of denial about that.

56
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:02,494
- You're not the only one.
- Hey, kiddo.

57
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,134
You don't need me
to pass judgment on this guy.

58
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:07,633
You've done the right thing
your whole life.

59
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:10,169
You won't make a mistake. You never do.

60
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,639
I'm the luckiest father
in the world, you know?

61
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,211
I've never had to be afraid
for my daughter.

62
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:21,215
Listen, I hate this. I gotta run.
Come see me. I promise I won't cancel.

63
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:22,543
We will.

64
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,654
- Bye, Dad, I love you.
- Love you too.

65
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,231
- Okay, what have we got?
- This new computer virus is tricky.

66
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:46,102
It's infected half the civilian Internet
as well as secondary military apps.

67
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:49,075
- Payroll, inventory.
- Primary defense nets are still clean?

68
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,508
So far the firewalls are holding up.

69
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:55,446
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use
our Al to scan the infrastructure.

70
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,088
Search and destroy
for any hint of the virus.

71
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:01,587
I know, Tony, but that's like
going after a fly with a bazooka.

72
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,387
Once the connection's made,
it should only be a few minutes.

73
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:08,931
During which we've put everything under
the control of a single computer system.

74
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,898
The most intelligent system
ever conceived.

75
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,039
I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

76
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,367
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

77
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:19,432
Yes, sir.

78
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,972
Thanks.

79
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,811
You're supposed to go around
to the back.

80
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,944
Hey, I said you're supposed to go--

81
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,595
- Take off your clothes.
- Patience, honey.

82
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,537
Bitch. Wait your turn.

83
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:07,765
- Your clothes.
- Talk to the hand.

84
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,278
Now.

85
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,889
Welcome to Jim's Burgers.
Can I take your order?

86
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:37,893
- Jose Barrera?
- Yeah, that's me.

87
00:16:56,418 --> 00:17:00,081
Growing concern over widespread outages
in the global digital network...

88
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:03,688
...have prompted rumors
of a new computer super-virus.

89
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:07,420
- Wall Street analysts are confident...
- Shit! My mom's home.

90
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:10,661
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer.
Here. Take that.

91
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,735
Go, go, go.

92
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:22,369
Elizabeth and William Anderson?

93
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:27,482
I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs.
Is there something wrong?

94
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:42,123
What's going on?

95
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:45,495
I have to go to the clinic.
It's an emergency.

96
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:47,826
It's 4:30 in the morning.

97
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:51,738
Well, I'll be back before you get up.

98
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,712
Cool it, guys, it's just me.

99
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:41,289
We've got a sick cat coming in.

100
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,340
Great.

101
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:06,910
Junkies.

102
00:19:11,955 --> 00:19:14,185
Please, don't do that.

103
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:20,427
I suppose it was you who
ripped us off last week.

104
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:23,430
Put the phone down.

105
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:26,525
Sorry.

106
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:28,395
I just...

107
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:30,665
I needed some medicine.

108
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:34,436
There's an emergency clinic
half a mile away.

109
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:36,203
Can't do that.

110
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:43,686
How much did you take?

111
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:45,618
- Enough.
- Well...

112
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:49,455
...this is the stuff we use
to chemically neuter dogs.

113
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,754
Take a look.

114
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,064
Hey!

115
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:04,768
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

116
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,101
Next time bring a clue,
not a paintball gun.

117
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:11,771
- No, this isn't what you think.
- Yeah, right.

118
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:34,804
It's Hercules. I think he's got pneumonia.
He started coughing and wouldn't stop.

119
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:39,432
- Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.
- A problem? This is an emergency!

120
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,202
- It sounds like a hairball.
- I know what a hairball sounds like.

121
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:46,509
- Where's Dr.Monroe?
- It's 5:30 in the morning.

122
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:49,983
I'm sure he's home sleeping.
He'll come in if he has to.

123
00:20:50,788 --> 00:20:55,452
Just wait in here with Hercules
and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

124
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:15,443
Mike Kripke's basement.

125
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:18,978
What? What does that mean?

126
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,059
You're John Connor.

127
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:40,834
I'm Kate Brewster.

128
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:46,337
We went to
West Hills Junior High together.

129
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:54,012
- Jesus.
- What happened to you, John?

130
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:58,288
Middle of eighth grade,
you just disappeared.

131
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:01,790
And there was that thing
about your foster parents.

132
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:04,689
Yeah, they were murdered.

133
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:09,161
I didn't do it.

134
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:12,661
What the hell?

135
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:15,432
Is somebody with you?

136
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:39,330
Katherine Brewster?

137
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,580
No.

138
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:50,455
John Connor was here.
Where did he go?

139
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,928
Tell me. Where did he go?

140
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,140
Katherine Brewster?

141
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:42,416
What are you doing? Let me down!

142
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,981
Let me down! Let me down!

143
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,724
Where is John Connor?

144
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:53,759
If I tell you, will you let me go?

145
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,093
Yes.

146
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,596
He's...

147
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,929
...in the kennel, in a cage.

148
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:07,800
You said that you'd let me go.

149
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,532
I lied.

150
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:15,149
Please, please, please.
You have to let me go!

151
00:27:02,932 --> 00:27:05,992
John Connor.

152
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:10,299
It is time.

153
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:13,937
You here to kill me?

154
00:27:19,748 --> 00:27:22,842
No. You must live.

155
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:37,463
- Why are you here? Where are we going?
- Keep moving.

156
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:42,533
Get out of here.

157
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:45,369
Now!

158
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,681
- No pulse.
- See if you can get him down.

159
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:40,226
I can't.

160
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:42,422
This guy weighs a ton.

161
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:10,190
- 911.
- Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

162
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:13,888
- Where are you now?
- I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

163
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:16,563
It's a Toyota Tundra.

164
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:22,168
It says "Emery Animal Hospital"
on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

165
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,571
Hello?

166
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:27,809
Hello?

167
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:32,511
Shit! Shit!

168
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,052
Get off.

169
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:05,231
Let me out!

170
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:07,111
What are you doing here?

171
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,804
You tell me. You got me into this.

172
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:12,477
- Stop the car.
- I can't. Not yet.

173
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:16,678
- You bastard! Stop the car!
- Shut up!

174
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Son of a bitch.

175
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:33,294
Goddamn it.

176
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:35,462
Look what you did to my car.

177
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,939
This is my company car, asshole.

178
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,634
Get your ass out here.

179
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:43,007
Get your ass out of the car. Now!

180
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:45,079
What are you doing?

181
00:31:45,484 --> 00:31:48,351
If you don't have insurance,
I'm gonna rip your balls off.

182
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,785
- I don't want any problems, okay?
- Shut up!

183
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,046
Help!

184
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:54,486
Who's talking back there?
What's going on?

185
00:31:54,794 --> 00:31:55,852
- Calm down.
- Shut up!

186
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:59,794
- I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!
- Well, I'll be goddamned.

187
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:01,831
- Call 911!
- A cop when you need one.

188
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:03,832
Help, please! Please!

189
00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:06,831
Let me out of here! Help!

190
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:12,305
Get back here, asshole!

191
00:32:34,934 --> 00:32:37,198
That's the cops!
You have to pull over!

192
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,997
Yeah, first chance I get.

193
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:46,070
Hold on!

194
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,205
Stop it!

195
00:36:03,946 --> 00:36:05,277
I'll drive.

196
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,714
Get out.

197
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,339
Excuse me.

198
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:57,921
Move over.

199
00:38:27,992 --> 00:38:30,324
No sign of brain trauma.

200
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:34,389
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

201
00:38:38,802 --> 00:38:41,134
Do you even remember me?

202
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:45,799
Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?

203
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:49,376
"Hasta la vista, baby."
Ring any bells?

204
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:52,037
That was a different T-101.

205
00:38:52,516 --> 00:38:54,916
What, do you come off an assembly line
or something?

206
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:56,279
Exactly.

207
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:00,420
Oh, man. I'm gonna have
to teach you everything all over again.

208
00:39:02,192 --> 00:39:05,457
Katherine Brewster,
have you sustained injury?

209
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:08,297
Drop dead, you asshole!

210
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:12,024
I'm unable to comply.

211
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:23,041
Where are you taking me?

212
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:25,374
To a safe location.

213
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:44,560
All right, get off at the next exit.
Let her out.

214
00:39:44,736 --> 00:39:47,967
Negative.
Katherine Brewster must be protected.

215
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:51,772
- I thought I was the one they were after.
- You could not be located.

216
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:56,437
So a T-X was sent back through time
to eliminate your lieutenants.

217
00:39:57,515 --> 00:40:01,417
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

218
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:07,787
No, no.
No, you shouldn't even exist.

219
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:10,484
I mean,
we took out Cyberdyne over 10 years ago.

220
00:40:10,662 --> 00:40:14,496
- We stopped Judgment Day.
- You only postponed it.

221
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,861
Judgment Day is inevitable.

222
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:26,367
I require a cutting tool.

223
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:35,582
Here, take the wheel.

224
00:40:38,857 --> 00:40:42,418
- What are you doing?
- I am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells.

225
00:40:42,594 --> 00:40:45,893
My primary cell was damaged
by a plasma attack.

226
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:50,191
T-X is designed for extreme combat,
driven by a plasma reactor...

227
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:52,336
...and equipped with onboard weapons.

228
00:40:52,504 --> 00:40:53,835
Its arsenal includes...

229
00:40:54,005 --> 00:40:56,565
...nanotechnological transjectors.

230
00:40:56,741 --> 00:41:00,609
- Meaning?
- It can control other machines.

231
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,744
Its body chassis is heavily armored
and hardened to withstand external attack.

232
00:41:09,722 --> 00:41:12,088
- You'll find a way to destroy her.
- Unlikely.

233
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:14,492
I'm an obsolete design.

234
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,994
T-X is faster, more powerful
and more intelligent.

235
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:22,100
It's a far more effective
killing machine.

236
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,099
Oh, great.

237
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,532
That's great.

238
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:29,734
My presence in this timeline
has been anticipated.

239
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:34,337
T-X is designed to terminate
other cybernetic organisms.

240
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:39,610
So she's an anti-Terminator
Terminator?

241
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,681
You've gotta be shitting me.

242
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:46,291
No, I am not shitting you.

243
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:05,771
When ruptured,
the fuel cells become unstable.

244
00:42:06,245 --> 00:42:07,576
Relax.

245
00:42:07,746 --> 00:42:11,238
- Let me out of here!
- Relax!

246
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,672
Man, this is wack.

247
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,037
It's been like this for hours.
Every goddamn station.

248
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:00,356
Hey.

249
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,394
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

250
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:09,506
Talk to the hand.

251
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:28,724
Help! Help me!

252
00:43:29,229 --> 00:43:30,890
Help!

253
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:36,694
I think we better go.

254
00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:10,361
Jerky?

255
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:13,502
You're kidnapping me.

256
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:16,808
- Look--
- God, you were always a delinquent.

257
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:20,914
And look at you now, sitting there
like the bad boy thing still works.

258
00:44:21,082 --> 00:44:23,949
What are you,
some kind of gang member?

259
00:44:24,118 --> 00:44:26,518
How do you live with yourself?

260
00:44:28,756 --> 00:44:30,314
What?

261
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:36,387
Tell her who I am.

262
00:44:36,564 --> 00:44:42,264
John Connor is leader of the Worldwide
Resistance and last hope of humankind.

263
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:46,238
Right. And him?

264
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:49,641
He's a robot from the future.

265
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:53,473
Living tissue over a metal skeleton,
sent back in time to protect me.

266
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:55,444
Go to hell.

267
00:44:56,183 --> 00:44:58,777
He doesn't mean you any harm.

268
00:44:59,987 --> 00:45:02,080
I have a fiance.

269
00:45:02,256 --> 00:45:04,418
He's gonna be looking for me.

270
00:45:04,593 --> 00:45:06,993
What is it that you want?

271
00:45:08,797 --> 00:45:10,287
Just...

272
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:12,863
...imagine...

273
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:18,500
...if you knew you were gonna do
something important with your life.

274
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:20,971
Something amazing.

275
00:45:21,376 --> 00:45:25,005
Maybe the most important thing
anyone has ever done.

276
00:45:25,647 --> 00:45:27,274
But there's a catch.

277
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:30,912
Something terrible has to happen.

278
00:45:35,323 --> 00:45:37,723
You couldn't...

279
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:42,062
...live with yourself if you didn't try
to stop it, but...

280
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,891
What are you talking about?

281
00:45:46,468 --> 00:45:49,733
It's just-- The life you know...

282
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:53,007
...all the stuff that
you take for granted...

283
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:55,337
...it's not gonna last.

284
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:03,549
Mike Kripke.

285
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:07,377
Back there, why did you say
"Kripke's basement"?

286
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,148
Because Mike Kripke's house...

287
00:46:09,324 --> 00:46:12,657
...that's where the kids used
to go make out, right?

288
00:46:17,032 --> 00:46:20,195
So you and me--
Wait, did we...?

289
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,039
Holy shit, we did.

290
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:28,871
We made out in Kripke's basement.
I cannot believe you remembered that.

291
00:46:29,946 --> 00:46:34,246
I must have made
some kind of impression.

292
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,782
Give me a break.

293
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:39,520
I only remembered because
the next day you were in the news.

294
00:46:44,861 --> 00:46:49,730
Wait a second. You and me hooked up
the day before I first met him.

295
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,894
And now again, 10 years later.

296
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:58,266
We were supposed to meet.

297
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,535
Coincidence.

298
00:47:06,582 --> 00:47:08,243
Yeah.

299
00:47:33,776 --> 00:47:36,643
Hon? Did you just get in?

300
00:47:55,899 --> 00:47:59,164
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D.
This is Detective Bell.

301
00:47:59,903 --> 00:48:02,497
We're looking for Katherine Brewster.
Is she here?

302
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:03,867
No.

303
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:08,444
- You're her fiance, Scott Mason?
- Yes.

304
00:48:08,612 --> 00:48:12,480
There was an incident at the
veterinary hospital where she works.

305
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:15,345
We're concerned something
may have happened to her.

306
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:16,679
Where is she?

307
00:48:16,954 --> 00:48:20,321
We got a report from a gas station
attendant near Victorville...

308
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:24,392
...about a possible kidnapping
and it might be related.

309
00:48:24,561 --> 00:48:26,859
I'll help you find her.

310
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,570
Come with me.

311
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:46,638
Go.

312
00:49:14,612 --> 00:49:16,239
Your mother?

313
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,719
I never even knew
where she was buried.

314
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:27,523
I hit the road the day she died.

315
00:49:31,362 --> 00:49:33,660
Why did you bring me here?

316
00:49:37,635 --> 00:49:39,102
No! What are you doing?

317
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,794
Hey, stop!

318
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:42,370
Get away from it! Stop!

319
00:49:50,048 --> 00:49:52,608
Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.

320
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:55,082
Her friends scattered her ashes
in the sea.

321
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:58,684
They stored these weapons
in accordance with her will.

322
00:50:00,158 --> 00:50:01,648
What happened to her?

323
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:05,159
Leukemia.

324
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:09,966
I'm sorry.

325
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:15,128
We were living in Baja
when she was diagnosed.

326
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,504
They only gave her six months.

327
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:23,572
But she fought for three years.

328
00:50:26,085 --> 00:50:28,280
Long enough to make sure.

329
00:50:30,189 --> 00:50:32,316
To make sure?

330
00:50:34,827 --> 00:50:37,295
That the world didn't end.

331
00:50:43,535 --> 00:50:45,594
"Every day after this one is a gift."

332
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:48,638
She told me, "We made it. We're free."

333
00:50:51,477 --> 00:50:54,105
But I never really believed that.

334
00:50:57,149 --> 00:50:59,549
I guess she didn't either.

335
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:05,050
You know you were about
the closest thing to a father I ever had?

336
00:51:06,225 --> 00:51:08,022
How pathetic is that?

337
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:10,789
Out of my way!

338
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,157
My mission is to protect you.

339
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,297
That's enough.

340
00:51:19,905 --> 00:51:23,341
Move or I'll do it!
I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

341
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,677
Go ahead. See what happens.

342
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:43,089
Don't do that.

343
00:51:45,165 --> 00:51:47,224
Oh, my God.

344
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:56,706
This is the police.
We have the building surrounded.

345
00:51:56,876 --> 00:51:59,037
Release your hostage!

346
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:21,697
Just leave me here. I'm not the one
you want. You're wasting your time.

347
00:52:21,868 --> 00:52:25,929
Incorrect. John Connor
leads the Resistance to victory.

348
00:52:26,105 --> 00:52:27,367
How?

349
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,132
Why? Why me?

350
00:52:29,576 --> 00:52:31,544
You are John Connor.

351
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:36,209
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit
since the cradle.

352
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:39,279
Look at me.
I'm no leader, I never was!

353
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:41,545
I'm never gonna--

354
00:52:45,558 --> 00:52:46,991
Let go.

355
00:52:47,427 --> 00:52:50,294
You're right.
You're not the one I want.

356
00:52:50,563 --> 00:52:52,861
I'm wasting my time.

357
00:52:54,767 --> 00:52:59,227
Fuck you, you fucking machine!

358
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:01,563
Better.

359
00:53:03,777 --> 00:53:05,836
Oh, you were just dicking with me?

360
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:08,743
Anger is more useful than despair.

361
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:10,474
What?

362
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:14,109
Basic psychology is among
my subroutines.

363
00:53:18,392 --> 00:53:20,451
Perps still holed up?

364
00:53:21,562 --> 00:53:22,654
Gotcha.

365
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,355
Good news. Your fiancee's okay.

366
00:53:25,533 --> 00:53:26,625
Where is she?

367
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,291
Greenlawn Cemetery,
up off the 5 freeway.

368
00:53:29,503 --> 00:53:33,439
It's right by the desert.
But they're gonna bring her back to the--

369
00:53:34,408 --> 00:53:36,876
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

370
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:10,699
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

371
00:54:11,278 --> 00:54:14,441
Kate, my name is Dr.Silberman.

372
00:54:14,615 --> 00:54:17,948
I'm a post-trauma counselor
for the sheriff's department.

373
00:54:18,118 --> 00:54:20,143
How are you feeling?

374
00:54:20,921 --> 00:54:22,913
He's not human.

375
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:27,422
He's really not human.

376
00:54:29,864 --> 00:54:33,322
I know what it's like to be
in a hostage situation.

377
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:35,560
I've been there myself.

378
00:54:35,737 --> 00:54:38,865
The fear, the adrenaline.

379
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,942
You find yourself imagining things.

380
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:46,038
Impossible things.

381
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:48,943
Crazy things.

382
00:54:50,218 --> 00:54:52,448
Insane things.

383
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:57,289
Take years to get over it.

384
00:54:58,526 --> 00:55:00,960
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!

385
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:07,932
Drop your weapon!

386
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:13,731
And the coffin!

387
00:55:16,044 --> 00:55:18,569
Take him down! Take him down!

388
00:55:59,488 --> 00:56:01,547
Resume fire!

389
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:10,997
We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

390
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:14,702
Why? What makes her
so goddamn important?

391
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:19,204
Through her, you contact remnants of the
military and learn how to fight Skynet...

392
00:56:19,508 --> 00:56:21,874
...forming the core
of the Resistance.

393
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:24,672
Later,
your children will become important.

394
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:28,607
- What?
- She's your wife.

395
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,172
Get in!

396
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:30,870
Do you want to live? Come on!

397
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:56,603
- It was Scott! How could it be Scott?
- Your fiance?

398
00:57:56,773 --> 00:58:00,766
The T-X is polymimetic,
able to take the form of anything it touches.

399
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:03,604
Your fiance is dead.

400
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:29,196
Oh, my God!

401
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,005
Do something!

402
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,739
Get down.

403
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,499
We need a new vehicle.

404
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:57,945
Hey, come on.

405
01:00:58,123 --> 01:01:00,250
We gotta keep moving.

406
01:01:02,428 --> 01:01:04,988
She killed Scott because of me.

407
01:01:11,738 --> 01:01:14,070
Look, I know this won't help...

408
01:01:16,275 --> 01:01:21,838
...but sometimes things happen
that we just can't change.

409
01:01:25,818 --> 01:01:27,342
It's not your fault.

410
01:01:42,802 --> 01:01:45,032
Are you sure about this?

411
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:47,305
About her and me, I mean.

412
01:01:47,473 --> 01:01:52,103
Your confusion is not rational.
She's a healthy female of breeding age.

413
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:54,143
There's more to it than that.

414
01:01:54,313 --> 01:01:59,012
My database does not encompass
the dynamics of human pair bonding.

415
01:02:02,422 --> 01:02:06,153
So this Terminatrix, how many others
does she have on her hit list?

416
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,223
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth.
Anderson, William.

417
01:02:11,397 --> 01:02:14,161
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

418
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:15,595
My father?

419
01:02:15,768 --> 01:02:20,796
Having failed to acquire its primary target,
T-X will resume its default program.

420
01:02:20,973 --> 01:02:25,035
- She's gonna kill my father too?
- There's a high probability.

421
01:02:25,779 --> 01:02:28,145
- No.
- Who is he? What does he do?

422
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:32,809
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design,
secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

423
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:36,752
General Robert Brewster
is program director of CRS...

424
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:40,860
...Cyber Research Systems,
autonomous weapons division.

425
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:43,929
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

426
01:02:44,098 --> 01:02:48,398
Skynet is one of the digital defense systems
developed under Brewster.

427
01:02:48,569 --> 01:02:50,059
Oh, God.

428
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:53,702
Oh, my God. Of course.

429
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:55,541
It all makes sense now.

430
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,811
If you hadn't come back when I was a kid,
changed everything...

431
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:04,076
...she and I would have gotten together
then. I would have met her father.

432
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:06,885
- Don't you see?
- I don't understand.

433
01:03:07,054 --> 01:03:10,990
Your father.
This is all about your father.

434
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:15,754
He's the key. He always was. Your father
is the one who can shut Skynet down.

435
01:03:17,164 --> 01:03:19,632
He's the only one who ever could.

436
01:03:21,535 --> 01:03:23,696
We have to get to him
before the T-X does.

437
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:28,399
- Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.
- This is your mission, to save people!

438
01:03:28,575 --> 01:03:32,511
My mission is to ensure the survival
of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

439
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,578
I am giving you an order.

440
01:03:35,749 --> 01:03:38,343
I am not programmed
to follow your orders.

441
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:41,580
- After the nuclear war, you both--
- Nuclear war?!

442
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:44,816
There doesn't have to be a war!
We can stop it!

443
01:03:44,993 --> 01:03:47,188
There is insufficient time.

444
01:03:47,362 --> 01:03:51,526
The first launch sequences
will be initiated at 6:18 p.m.

445
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:53,462
- What, today?
- Affirmative.

446
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:56,331
John, what is he saying?

447
01:03:57,472 --> 01:03:59,463
Judgment Day.

448
01:04:00,842 --> 01:04:03,037
The end of the world.

449
01:04:04,412 --> 01:04:06,380
It's today, three hours from now.

450
01:04:06,848 --> 01:04:08,873
Two hours and 53 minutes.

451
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:14,113
We must continue south into Mexico
to escape the primary blast zones.

452
01:04:14,856 --> 01:04:17,654
No, we have to get to her dad.

453
01:04:19,327 --> 01:04:23,229
The Mojave area will sustain
significant nuclear fallout.

454
01:04:23,398 --> 01:04:25,025
You will not survive.

455
01:04:25,867 --> 01:04:30,201
You mean we go run and hide somewhere
in a hole while the bombs fall?

456
01:04:31,072 --> 01:04:32,505
It is your destiny.

457
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:38,008
- Fuck my destiny.
- John.

458
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:44,815
You cannot self-terminate.

459
01:04:45,353 --> 01:04:47,787
No, you can't.
I can do whatever I want.

460
01:04:47,956 --> 01:04:50,754
I'm a human being.
I'm not some goddamn robot.

461
01:04:50,925 --> 01:04:52,722
- Cybernetic organism.
- Whatever!

462
01:04:52,894 --> 01:04:55,761
Either we get her father
to shut Skynet down...

463
01:04:55,930 --> 01:05:00,663
...stop this shit from ever happening,
or so much for the great John Connor.

464
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:05,830
Because your future, my destiny,
I don't want any part of it. I never did.

465
01:05:07,376 --> 01:05:11,210
Based on your pupil dilation,
skin temperature and motor functions...

466
01:05:11,814 --> 01:05:17,616
...I calculate an 83% probability
that you will not pull the trigger.

467
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:26,090
Please do what he says.
You have to save my father!

468
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:33,826
We can reach CRS
in approximately one hour...

469
01:05:34,003 --> 01:05:36,767
...depending on traffic conditions.

470
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,791
I can't get a line.

471
01:06:05,868 --> 01:06:07,699
The whole cell network is down.

472
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:10,805
Skynet is assuming control
over global communications...

473
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:13,305
...in preparation for its attack.

474
01:06:13,475 --> 01:06:17,639
So if this war is between people
and machines...

475
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:20,176
...why are you on our side?

476
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:24,286
The Resistance captured me
and reprogrammed my CPU.

477
01:06:24,454 --> 01:06:27,946
I was originally designed
for assassination missions.

478
01:06:30,894 --> 01:06:32,418
So...

479
01:06:32,762 --> 01:06:36,630
...you don't really care
if this mission succeeds or not.

480
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,159
If we get killed,
does that mean anything to you?

481
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:44,603
If you were to die,
I will become useless.

482
01:06:44,774 --> 01:06:47,902
There will be no reason for me to exist.

483
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,609
Thank you for doing this.

484
01:06:55,785 --> 01:06:57,776
Your gratitude is not required.

485
01:06:58,488 --> 01:07:00,888
I am programmed
to follow your commands.

486
01:07:01,891 --> 01:07:03,290
Her commands?

487
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:08,830
Katherine Brewster had me reactivated and
sent through the time displacement field.

488
01:07:08,998 --> 01:07:12,627
What exactly am I in this
future of yours?

489
01:07:12,802 --> 01:07:16,499
You're John Connor's spouse
and second-in-command.

490
01:07:18,475 --> 01:07:20,340
No, I--

491
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:22,300
What?

492
01:07:24,514 --> 01:07:26,141
You're a mess.

493
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:31,551
Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.

494
01:07:32,522 --> 01:07:34,547
Why didn't I send you back?

495
01:07:34,724 --> 01:07:37,022
I am not authorized
to answer your question.

496
01:07:38,795 --> 01:07:42,288
- Why didn't he send you back?
- He was dead.

497
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:48,566
Well, that sucks.

498
01:07:49,507 --> 01:07:53,409
- Humans inevitably die.
- Yeah, I know.

499
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:56,438
So how does it--? No.

500
01:07:56,881 --> 01:07:59,679
Maybe I don't want to know.

501
01:08:01,252 --> 01:08:02,742
How does he die?

502
01:08:03,487 --> 01:08:07,253
John Connor was terminated
on July 4th, 2032.

503
01:08:07,425 --> 01:08:11,327
I was selected for the emotional attachment
he had for my model number...

504
01:08:11,495 --> 01:08:15,761
...due to his boyhood experiences.
This aided in my infiltration.

505
01:08:16,734 --> 01:08:18,361
What are you saying?

506
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:22,469
I killed you.

507
01:08:34,752 --> 01:08:39,746
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100 hours,
all primary military systems were secure.

508
01:08:39,924 --> 01:08:43,985
They were. Only the civilian sector
was affected. Internet, air traffic.

509
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,959
Minutes ago, guidance computers
at Vandenberg crashed.

510
01:08:47,131 --> 01:08:49,827
We thought it was an error.
It looks like the virus.

511
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,266
- Early warning in Alaska is down.
- Satellite signals are scrambled.

512
01:08:54,438 --> 01:08:57,305
What about the missile silos, the subs?

513
01:08:58,309 --> 01:09:00,539
We've lost contact.

514
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,448
You're saying this country
is completely open to attack.

515
01:09:04,616 --> 01:09:07,449
Theoretically, we could be
under attack already.

516
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:13,057
Who's doing this? A foreign power
or some computer hacker in his garage?

517
01:09:13,225 --> 01:09:15,352
We can't trace the virus
or pin it down.

518
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:19,657
It keeps growing and changing,
like it has a mind of its own.

519
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,961
This can't be happening.

520
01:09:22,133 --> 01:09:26,331
The Pentagon's on the secure line.
It's the chairman.

521
01:09:29,608 --> 01:09:31,508
All right.

522
01:09:45,957 --> 01:09:47,857
Look...

523
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,160
...none of this is gonna happen.

524
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:56,199
We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug
on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

525
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:01,403
He won't have to kill me someday.

526
01:10:02,173 --> 01:10:04,505
He'll never even exist.

527
01:10:06,177 --> 01:10:11,513
You and I, we can
just go our separate ways.

528
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:18,781
You know, Mike Kripke's basement...

529
01:10:21,594 --> 01:10:24,495
That was the first time
I ever kissed a guy.

530
01:10:25,765 --> 01:10:27,027
Really?

531
01:10:34,307 --> 01:10:36,434
Your levity is good.

532
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:40,567
It relieves tension and the fear of death.

533
01:11:07,707 --> 01:11:10,335
We're hoping you have a solution for us.

534
01:11:10,509 --> 01:11:14,275
I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready
for a system-wide connection.

535
01:11:14,447 --> 01:11:17,416
That's not what your civilian
counterparts there told me.

536
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:19,881
They say we can stop this damn virus.

537
01:11:20,052 --> 01:11:23,544
I understand there's a certain amount
of performance anxiety...

538
01:11:23,723 --> 01:11:27,056
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet
into all of our systems...

539
01:11:27,226 --> 01:11:31,287
...it'll squash this thing and give me back
control of my military.

540
01:11:31,464 --> 01:11:33,955
Mr.Chairman, I need
to make myself very clear.

541
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:37,569
If we uplink now, Skynet will be
in control of your military.

542
01:11:37,737 --> 01:11:41,765
But you'll be in control of Skynet, right?

543
01:11:42,109 --> 01:11:44,236
That is correct, sir.

544
01:11:44,411 --> 01:11:45,776
Then do it.

545
01:11:45,946 --> 01:11:48,710
And Brewster, if this thing works...

546
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:52,249
...you'll get all the funding
you'll ever need.

547
01:11:53,186 --> 01:11:55,120
Yes, sir.

548
01:13:03,725 --> 01:13:05,352
Sir?

549
01:13:06,594 --> 01:13:08,357
Shall I?

550
01:13:09,897 --> 01:13:11,455
No.

551
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:14,762
It's my job now.

552
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:32,276
- Skynet Defense System activated.
- We're in.

553
01:13:32,453 --> 01:13:35,684
We're past the firewalls, local
defense nets, Minutemen, subs.

554
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:39,987
Skynet's fully operational,
processing at 60 teraflops a second.

555
01:13:40,161 --> 01:13:44,029
It should take less than a minute
to find the virus and kill it.

556
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:48,000
Let's pray to God this works.

557
01:13:54,242 --> 01:13:55,402
Power failure?

558
01:13:55,576 --> 01:13:57,908
No. I don't know what it is.

559
01:14:08,956 --> 01:14:11,390
What the hell is going on?

560
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:12,583
Daddy!

561
01:14:13,127 --> 01:14:14,685
What are you doing here?

562
01:14:21,036 --> 01:14:23,834
Daddy! Get away from it!

563
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:29,167
Watch out!

564
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:48,328
Daddy, don't move.

565
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:54,430
She'll be back.

566
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,061
We have to shut down Skynet.

567
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,867
Where's the system core?
In this building?

568
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:03,842
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

569
01:15:04,012 --> 01:15:07,140
Skynet is the virus!
It's why everything's falling apart!

570
01:15:07,316 --> 01:15:09,443
Skynet has become self-aware.

571
01:15:09,618 --> 01:15:13,247
In one hour it will initiate
a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

572
01:15:13,422 --> 01:15:14,514
What enemy?

573
01:15:15,123 --> 01:15:16,522
Us!

574
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:18,023
Humans.

575
01:15:27,135 --> 01:15:30,400
Oh, God! It's the machines.
They're starting to take over.

576
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:34,030
My office, on this floor,
we have to get there.

577
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:37,474
The access codes are in my safe.

578
01:16:56,259 --> 01:17:00,356
- Why are they killing everyone?
- To destroy any possible threat to Skynet.

579
01:17:00,531 --> 01:17:02,294
Which ones are the codes?

580
01:17:02,466 --> 01:17:04,297
Red envelope.

581
01:17:08,105 --> 01:17:11,939
Crystal Peak. You have
to get to Crystal Peak.

582
01:17:12,109 --> 01:17:14,270
- What is he saying?
- Crystal Peak.

583
01:17:14,445 --> 01:17:17,107
A hardened facility
in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

584
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:21,047
Fifty-two miles northeast,
bearing 0.5 degrees.

585
01:17:21,218 --> 01:17:22,913
That's the system core?

586
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:25,614
It's your only chance.

587
01:17:25,789 --> 01:17:30,749
You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator
leads to the runway.

588
01:17:32,763 --> 01:17:34,526
Take care of my daughter.

589
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:40,335
Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

590
01:17:40,504 --> 01:17:43,803
I opened Pandora's box.

591
01:17:44,975 --> 01:17:45,964
Get down!

592
01:18:02,393 --> 01:18:04,759
There's nothing you can do. Come on.

593
01:18:04,928 --> 01:18:07,055
We must go. It is not safe here.

594
01:18:07,798 --> 01:18:10,266
Kate, we have to go.

595
01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:14,131
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

596
01:18:14,371 --> 01:18:18,501
He wanted us to shut Skynet down.
Come on.

597
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:21,711
Come on.

598
01:18:33,691 --> 01:18:35,318
Run!

599
01:20:09,955 --> 01:20:11,547
Let's go.

600
01:21:22,929 --> 01:21:25,796
That's it. We can follow it
out to the runway.

601
01:21:25,966 --> 01:21:27,695
Come on.

602
01:22:24,592 --> 01:22:25,581
What?

603
01:22:26,894 --> 01:22:28,623
Nothing.

604
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:31,860
You remind me of my mother.

605
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,684
Oh, God. She's coming.

606
01:22:55,256 --> 01:22:57,121
What are you doing?

607
01:22:58,192 --> 01:22:59,250
Powering up.

608
01:23:04,432 --> 01:23:05,558
Come on.

609
01:24:16,171 --> 01:24:17,536
It's working.

610
01:24:22,177 --> 01:24:24,737
Just die, you bitch!

611
01:24:28,483 --> 01:24:30,212
Come on.

612
01:25:46,395 --> 01:25:49,228
There's my father's plane.
I trained on it.

613
01:26:00,243 --> 01:26:02,473
Yes! He made it.

614
01:26:04,447 --> 01:26:06,438
Get away from me.

615
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:09,942
Leave!

616
01:26:11,687 --> 01:26:12,813
Now!

617
01:26:13,256 --> 01:26:14,450
Let's go!

618
01:26:19,395 --> 01:26:22,490
- The master's on. Throttle's set.
- Come on. Let's go.

619
01:26:28,505 --> 01:26:31,531
Oh, please. You can't do this.

620
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:33,335
I have no choice.

621
01:26:34,244 --> 01:26:36,610
The T-X...

622
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,246
...has corrupted my system.

623
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,946
You can't kill a human being.
You said so yourself.

624
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:47,954
Let him go!

625
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:54,426
You're fighting it right now.

626
01:26:55,299 --> 01:26:57,392
My CPU is intact.

627
01:26:57,968 --> 01:27:01,768
But I cannot control my other functions.

628
01:27:01,939 --> 01:27:05,568
You don't have to do this.
You don't want to do this!

629
01:27:06,076 --> 01:27:10,103
Desire is irrelevant.

630
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,840
I am a machine.

631
01:27:29,433 --> 01:27:31,094
What is your mission?

632
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:36,397
To ensure the survival of John Connor...

633
01:27:36,573 --> 01:27:38,598
...and Katherine Brewster.

634
01:27:43,948 --> 01:27:47,145
You are about to fail that mission!

635
01:27:54,025 --> 01:27:56,823
I can-- I cannot.

636
01:27:57,929 --> 01:28:00,056
You know what you have to do.

637
01:28:02,033 --> 01:28:04,593
You know my destiny.

638
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,400
I have to live.

639
01:28:51,115 --> 01:28:53,640
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

640
01:28:53,818 --> 01:28:56,446
He couldn't do it.
He shut himself down.

641
01:29:00,192 --> 01:29:02,786
- Can you fly?
- Yeah.

642
01:29:30,189 --> 01:29:32,384
Okay. 015 degrees...

643
01:29:32,558 --> 01:29:36,790
...52 miles, our max air speed
is about 160.

644
01:29:36,962 --> 01:29:39,362
We've got 32 minutes.

645
01:29:39,531 --> 01:29:41,362
It's just you and me now.

646
01:29:41,533 --> 01:29:44,001
What if we can't stop it?

647
01:29:44,603 --> 01:29:48,232
There's enough C-4 here
to take out 10 supercomputers.

648
01:29:48,674 --> 01:29:51,006
We're gonna make it, Kate.

649
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:54,577
The future is up to us.

650
01:30:01,019 --> 01:30:03,249
That's gotta be it.

651
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:09,479
Skynet. There may be more of them.

652
01:31:27,373 --> 01:31:29,170
Come on.

653
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:46,587
I think this is some kind of blast door.

654
01:31:49,697 --> 01:31:52,359
There's no way
we can blow through this thing.

655
01:31:53,634 --> 01:31:54,623
John, look.

656
01:31:57,605 --> 01:31:59,038
Now what?

657
01:32:01,876 --> 01:32:04,208
It's a code prompt.

658
01:32:11,352 --> 01:32:14,378
Type in "Dakota 775."

659
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,891
"Red 176."

660
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:44,248
Come on!
We gotta get this thing open.

661
01:32:44,518 --> 01:32:46,349
Here. It's "Avalon 412."

662
01:32:47,254 --> 01:32:48,585
Put it in!

663
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:24,391
Come on!

664
01:33:40,909 --> 01:33:42,399
I'm back.

665
01:33:57,826 --> 01:33:59,987
Go! Now!

666
01:34:00,595 --> 01:34:01,584
Come on!

667
01:34:24,687 --> 01:34:27,019
- Thank you.
- We'll meet again.

668
01:34:27,289 --> 01:34:28,449
Go!

669
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:30,614
Come on!

670
01:35:15,204 --> 01:35:16,728
You are terminated.

671
01:35:48,939 --> 01:35:50,270
The elevator.

672
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,280
I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

673
01:35:59,783 --> 01:36:02,217
That should give us enough time
to get back up.

674
01:36:33,583 --> 01:36:35,312
What is this place?

675
01:37:16,027 --> 01:37:18,518
These computers are 30 years old.

676
01:37:27,038 --> 01:37:28,869
This isn't Skynet.

677
01:37:33,544 --> 01:37:35,375
There's nothing here.

678
01:37:40,551 --> 01:37:43,384
This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

679
01:37:45,223 --> 01:37:47,555
Only they never got the warning.

680
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:53,891
Goddamn it!

681
01:37:56,234 --> 01:37:58,725
There's nothing here!

682
01:38:18,256 --> 01:38:20,088
Why didn't he tell us?

683
01:38:23,428 --> 01:38:25,862
Why did he lead us down here?

684
01:38:31,603 --> 01:38:33,264
To live.

685
01:38:34,439 --> 01:38:36,430
That was his mission.

686
01:38:50,289 --> 01:38:52,450
There was never any stopping it.

687
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,459
John...

688
01:38:58,797 --> 01:39:00,458
...we could just...

689
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:02,631
...let it go.

690
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:06,801
Hello?

691
01:39:07,606 --> 01:39:09,801
Hello? Can somebody hear me?

692
01:39:10,909 --> 01:39:12,740
This is Montana Civil Defense.

693
01:39:14,313 --> 01:39:16,474
Somebody please come in.

694
01:39:16,982 --> 01:39:18,643
Is there anybody there?

695
01:39:18,984 --> 01:39:21,976
Anyone reading me? Over.

696
01:39:23,155 --> 01:39:27,421
Rumors about a launch sequence.
Command and control have broken down.

697
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:31,754
Is anyone receiving me?
Somebody?

698
01:39:33,832 --> 01:39:35,823
Somebody please come in.

699
01:39:36,268 --> 01:39:37,599
Anybody out there?

700
01:39:37,836 --> 01:39:41,170
- This is SAC Nellis. We're under attack.
- CQ? CQ?

701
01:39:41,441 --> 01:39:42,999
Is anybody there?

702
01:39:45,011 --> 01:39:48,674
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

703
01:39:49,615 --> 01:39:54,348
Connor? What the hell is happening?
Who's in charge there?

704
01:40:01,194 --> 01:40:02,525
I am.

705
01:40:03,863 --> 01:40:06,195
Connor, can you help us?

706
01:40:06,532 --> 01:40:11,367
This is Montana Civil Defense.
Where did you say you were again?

707
01:40:14,707 --> 01:40:17,540
By the time Skynet
became self-aware...

708
01:40:17,877 --> 01:40:22,211
...it had spread into millions
of computer servers across the planet.

709
01:40:22,982 --> 01:40:27,885
Ordinary computers in office buildings,
dorm rooms, everywhere.

710
01:40:29,722 --> 01:40:33,385
It was software and cyberspace.

711
01:40:34,594 --> 01:40:39,395
There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.

712
01:40:40,733 --> 01:40:45,727
The attack began at 6:18 p.m.,
just as he said it would.

713
01:40:46,739 --> 01:40:48,400
Judgment Day.

714
01:40:49,242 --> 01:40:51,767
The day the human race
was nearly destroyed...

715
01:40:51,944 --> 01:40:54,674
...by weapons they'd built
to protect themselves.

716
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:02,245
I should have realized our destiny
was never to stop Judgment Day.

717
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:05,748
It was merely to survive it...

718
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,554
...together.

719
01:41:11,932 --> 01:41:13,763
The Terminator knew.

720
01:41:14,268 --> 01:41:16,759
He tried to tell us...

721
01:41:17,604 --> 01:41:20,300
...but I didn't want to hear it.

722
01:41:22,609 --> 01:41:26,602
Maybe the future has been written.
I don't know.

723
01:41:27,614 --> 01:41:30,276
All I know is what
the Terminator taught me:

724
01:41:30,951 --> 01:41:33,283
Never stop fighting.

725
01:41:33,454 --> 01:41:36,116
And I never will.

726
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:42,084
The battle has just begun.
