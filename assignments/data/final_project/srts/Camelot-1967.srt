1
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,708
(Servant) King Uther, there is a visitor.
She won't give her name.

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,719
Who are you?

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,389
Morgan.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,078
Father.

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,550
Your whore still lives.

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,393
- You will respect your mother.
- Stepmother.

7
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,470
- Why are you here?
- I've come home.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,192
I want to offer you forgiveness.

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,869
For what?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,878
For the death of my mother,
so you could install this whore.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,115
(Grunts)

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,150
And for banishing me
so I'd be silenced.

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,953
- I sent you away for an education.
- 15 years in a nunnery,

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,152
I learned more than you can imagine.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,317
Father, I'm your only child.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,278
Why wouldn't you welcome me home?

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,551
You have lived too long
without my guidance.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,272
This isn't your home.

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,992
And I no longer have a daughter.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,719
Don't turn your back on me, Father.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,512
You're not welcome, Morgan.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,675
Goodbye.

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,192
Igraine, leave her.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,432
(Drumming)

25
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,396
Uther? Uther!

26
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,114
- (Choking)
- Uther!

27
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,958
(Igraine) What's wrong?

28
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,196
Help! Somebody help him!

29
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,150
Uther!

30
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,674
Help us!

31
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,235
Out of my way!

32
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,032
Open the gates!

33
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,391
Help him! Help him!

34
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,511
(Merlin) Take the King
to his chambers. Now.

35
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,958
(Prayers in Latin)

36
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,639
Whatever powers you have,
use them now.

37
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,669
Uther.

38
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,950
You're going to die.

39
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,719
The poison was too strong.

40
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,150
Put your hand to this.

41
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,518
For Britain and the boy.

42
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,758
(Thunderclap)

43
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,069
(Groans)

44
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,668
(Rumble of thunder)

45
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,868
His time is done.

46
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,589
Merlin!

47
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,068
(Gasps)

48
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,599
(Groans)

49
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,713
(Thunderclap)

50
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,513
In principio... (Kiss)

51
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,471
...erat... (Kiss)

52
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,999
...verbum.

53
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,638
In the beginning was the word.

54
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,399
And the word was...

55
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,509
God, yes!

56
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,599
This isn't Latin study.

57
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,110
No, but it is definitely worship.

58
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,437
- Arthur!
- (Both gasp)

59
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,709
It can't be!

60
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,153
Hey!

61
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,475
- You bastard!
- Kay, listen.

62
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,431
- She said you two were over.
- Arthur!

63
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,391
- No, I did not.

- Oh, thanks a lot!

64
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,310
Stop!

65
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,875
Stop it, both of you.

66
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,797
(Groans)

67
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,790
I should kill you.

68
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,478
How did you even find us?

69
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,830
I know where you bring your girls.

70
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,552
And now mine, too.

71
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,275
Get dressed.
I was sent to find you.

72
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,879
There's a visitor.

73
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,911
What's that got to do with me?

74
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,680
It's bad, I know. I shouldn't have.

I wasn't thinking.

75
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,598
You were thinking, "lf I get caught,
I can talk my way out of this."

76
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,393
It was a mistake.
We got carried away.

77
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,636
- Twice!
- Shut up.

78
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,149
- Please, just shut up.
- Sometimes these things happen.

79
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,555
She's Cleopatra,
you're Caesar and I'm Mark Antony.

80
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,591
No, you're really not at all.

81
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,756
We can't let a woman
come between us, Brother.

82
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,677
Everything comes easy for you.

83
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,437
You don't even appreciate it.

84
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,509
What's going on?

85
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,909
Mother?

86
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,309
Father?

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,989
He's here.

88
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,799
(Merlin chuckles)

89
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,390
- So you're the boy.
- I'm Arthur. Who are you?

90
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,193
His name is Merlin
and he is not welcome here.

91
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,515
- Then he'll be on his way.
- Put down your sword.

92
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,108
- Do as you're told, boy!
- What is happening here?

93
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,954
The King is dead, murdered.

94
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,709
- So?
- Uther died with no legitimate son.

95
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,116
What's that got to do with us?

96
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,959
Not them. You...

97
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,196
...are Uther's son.

98
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,878
No.

99
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,832
My parents are standing here.

100
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,877
Tell him.

101
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,752
Tell him.

102
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,596
He's telling the truth, Arthur.

103
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,831
He can't be. How can he be?

104
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,909
Merlin brought you to us

105
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,917
when you were less than a week old.

106
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,876
We swore to look after you.

107
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,319
What?

108
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,158
The King is dead.

109
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,118
Long live the King.

110
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,032
- Take your lies and get out!
- Arthur.

111
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,355
Arthur, give me the blade.

112
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,595
Give me the blade.

113
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,149
Now...

114
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,797
You tell him how this happened.
You tell him the story of his birth.

115
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,876
The details aren't important.

116
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,194
They are to him!

117
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,595
Arthur, I should have told you before.
I'm...

118
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,832
I'm so sorry, son.

119
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,759
Rest tonight.

120
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,955
Tomorrow, we leave.

121
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,509
(Morgan) Where is she?

122
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,155
Lady lgraine remains
in mourning in her chamber.

123
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,430
- And the men?
- Most are gone.

124
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,710
- On whose authority?
- Merlin's.

125
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,956
The night after your father's death,

126
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,911
his warriors packed up and left.

127
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,959
Then we'll find our own.

128
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,957
Better and stronger.

129
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,069
We?

130
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,997
You answer to me now.

131
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,559
Thank you.

132
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,950
(Door opens)

133
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,390
Pull down those banners.

134
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,317
Confiscate all the weapons.

135
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,273
And someone find the kitchens.
I'm bloody starving.

136
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,675
The doors are open to you, my Lord.

137
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,791
There's no need for force.

138
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,478
Are you the one who summoned me?

139
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,830
I'm Uther's daughter and sole heir.

140
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,474
- Morgan Pendragon.
- Even as we speak,

141
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,751
my men are slaughtering
all those still loyal to Uther.

142
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,996
Why would you call me here?

143
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,680
- To offer an alliance.
- Who with?

144
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,836
- Me.
- (Guffaws)

145
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,189
You?

146
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,039
Who better than you, King Lot,

147
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,390
my father's strongest opponent.

148
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,438
I am immune to flattery.

149
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,073
And yet you came when asked.

150
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,953
- You've nothing to offer me.
- I hold this castle.

151
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,637
I could split you from your gut
to your throat

152
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,875
and still take it.

153
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,233
But you're cleverer than that.

154
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,032
- Am l?
- Kill me,

155
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,515
and you're just a warlord
taking yet another castle.

156
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,154
- But if we stand together...
- I stand alone.

157
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,349
If we forge a union,

158
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,631
we'd have the strength
to unite the realm.

159
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,790
As King and Queen.

160
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,948
There is already a queen
within these walls.

161
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,436
I could take her
and still sit on Uther's throne.

162
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,996
- She is to be exiled.
- Oh, is she now?

163
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,076
Yes.

164
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,760
You're very confident in your plans.

165
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,518
I am.

166
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,557
What makes you so special?

167
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,439
Come near me and I'll kill you.

168
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,992
Don't issue empty threats.

169
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,599
Who are you?

170
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,038
I knew Uther Pendragon.

171
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,955
I was at his side when he died.

172
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,359
The King's will,

173
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,516
signed by his own hand,

174
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,030
bearing his seal,
attesting to your birth.

175
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,398
This was your father's.

176
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,399
Take it.

177
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,675
When you were born,
I took you

178
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,199
and brought you here.

179
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,317
You may be of king's blood
but Uther was a barbarian.

180
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,590
Placing you here
made you so much more.

181
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,032
I told Ector
how to raise and educate you.

182
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,072
He swore to keep you safe.

183
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,236
They raised you well.

184
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,472
Perhaps too well.

185
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,515
Why? Why do you need me?

186
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,119
Everything in time.

187
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,674
I sometimes wondered
why they doted more on you.

188
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,995
You always got away with so much.

189
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,509
- It was never like that.
- It's always been like that.

190
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,835
You've just never seen it.

191
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,077
You're used to the world falling
at your feet the moment you smile.

192
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,838
But it's all right.
This makes sense of it.

193
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,951
They treated you like you were special.

194
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,277
- Because you are.
- At last you finally admit it.

195
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,712
Hey, this doesn't change anything.

196
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,469
You're still my brother.
And you're still infuriating.

197
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,869
What do I do?

198
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,833
I can't just leave. This is my home.
This is what I know, here.

199
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,996
But what you're being offered is better.

200
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,792
Going to battle, leading the land.

201
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,913
- It's what every man dreams of.
- No, it's what you dream of.

202
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,315
The rest of us dream about girls.

203
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,432
You think a leader won't get
his choice of girls?

204
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,039
Why shouldn't it be your destiny?

205
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,238
If it was me,

206
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,555
I'd go,

207
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,432
in an instant.

208
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,959
So, you're coming.

209
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,118
I'm not saying I believe you.
It's just I want to see it for myself.

210
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,239
You're ready.

211
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,439
Why didn't you tell me?

212
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,074
I was afraid of losing you.

213
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,792
Because you are my son.

214
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,911
You'll always be my mother.

215
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,872
I place him in your care.

216
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,956
- You keep him safe.
- You have my word.

217
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,913
It's what you were born for.

218
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,429
It's what we've guided you for.

219
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,154
You remember what I taught you.

220
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,669
When you make decisions,
you use...this

221
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,916
in conjunction with this.

222
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,635
- And you never use that!
- I'll try and remember that.

223
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,999
No son ever had a better father.

224
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,197
- I want you to know...
- I know, I know, I know.

225
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,717
I love you.

226
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,710
You've given me everything
my entire life

227
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,071
and I feel guilty
for asking for anything more, but...

228
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,233
I need Kay.
I want him with me.

229
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,793
Yes.

230
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,909
Yes!

231
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,996
Whatever this is,

I can't do it without you.

232
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,509
He thought you'd never ask.

233
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,279
Together, you're stronger.

234
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,549
It's time.

235
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,719
Yes!

236
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,799
- Say my name.
- Morgan.

237
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,395
- Who will I be?
- Queen of the realm.

238
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,714
Are you fit to be my king?

239
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,876
Oh, you know I am.

240
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,917
What will you give me?

241
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,917
Undying loyalty.

242
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,952
- Swear your fealty.
- Swear yours to me.

243
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,593
- Swear it!
- I swear.

244
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,312
On what?

245
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,919
- On my oath.
- Yes!

246
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,349
- My life.
- Yes!

247
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,552
- And your blood.
- My blood!

248
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,148
Where did you learn that, huh?

249
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,876
Your father dies,

250
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,399
and you banish your own mother
from her home.

251
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,397
- lmpressive.
- Stepmother.

252
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,356
I'm the only one of Uther's blood.

253
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,550
His castle and realm should be mine.

254
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,315
So you summon me,

255
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,237
Uther's worst enemy.

256
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,475
You propose an alliance

257
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,068
and then seduce me,

258
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,714
even as your father's body cools.

259
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,238
Is there no end to your ambition?

260
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,237
- Are you complaining?
- No.

261
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,032
I'm just curious.

262
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,191
- A queen still requires a king.
- Yes.

263
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,993
Together, we'll unite the realm.

264
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,109
Yes.

265
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,629
(Guard shouts)

266
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,716
I'll set her on the way myself.

267
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,879
Yes.

268
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,880
It suits you up there.

269
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,399
Where will you go?

270
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,909
Your father had plenty of allies
who will give me space.

271
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,429
Was there anything else,
or did you just come to gloat?

272
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,835
Just give thanks
you're leaving here alive.

273
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,754
I did nothing to harm you.

274
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,838
Indeed, my Lady, you did nothing

275
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,509
when my mother was murdered
so that you could take her place

276
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,790
and you did nothing
when my father banished me.

277
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,115
No queen questions her king.

278
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,913
And I thought my opinion of you
couldn't get any lower.

279
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,956
(Horse whinnies)

280
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,479
Safe travels!

281
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,832
The land is treacherous.

282
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,670
I bring a message from Merlin.

283
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,233
(Morgan) What does he want?

284
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,636
He asks that you attend Uther's son
at the ancient castle of Camelot.

285
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,309
Uther's son?

286
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,032
That's what I was told to deliver.

287
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,159
He has a son.

288
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,675
I have the only true claim to the throne.

289
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,870
This is Merlin's game.

290
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,150
So we'll play with him.

291
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,672
(Lot chuckles)

292
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,757
If you were responsible for my birth,
I deserve to know who you are.

293
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,072
Stop asking about me
and think about who you are.

294
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,838
Are you really a sorcerer?

295
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,834
I can do things
others believe impossible.

296
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,118
Is that sorcery?

297
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,559
Well, go on then.

298
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,636
Show me. Prove it to me.

299
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,431
You pull me from one coast to the other
and you tell me nothing!

300
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,632
You asked me why I need you.

301
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,556
I had a vision of what was to come.

302
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,359
What sort of vision?

303
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,159
The darkness of man.
I won't let it happen again.

304
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,396
And you had this vision
before I was conceived?

305
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,599
The past doesn't matter.

306
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,354
Define yourself in the present
and you might rule in the future.

307
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,395
(Flies buzzing)

308
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,792
(Kay) Dear God.

309
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,560
- It's already begun.
- (Arthur) What?

310
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,990
Without a king, there will be
carnage across the land.

311
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,716
What are you doing?

312
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,229
Whoever these men are,

they deserve a Christian burial.

313
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,679
They're long past saving.

314
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,596
Arthur, tell him.

315
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,553
If we stay here,
we're a target for whoever did this.

316
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,752
Stop worrying about the dead.
The living need us more.

317
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,956
Merlin's right.
We need to keep moving.

318
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,308
We can't help them now.

319
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,359
Go!

320
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,674
Let's move!

321
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,430
(Merlin) We rest here.

322
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,028
(Kay) This village? Is that wise?

323
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,752
(Merlin) We'll find out.

324
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,715
Fear spreads like plague.

325
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,239
Stay on your horses
and ride on through.

326
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,238
We are on our way to the coast.
We were hoping for shelter tonight.

327
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,998
There's no welcome here.

328
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,279
Not even for an old friend?

329
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,431
Merlin, is that you?

330
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,594
- That's more like it.
- It's been too long.

331
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,993
It's people like these
that will be next to the slaughter

332
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,071
if you don't fulfil your destiny.

333
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,792
What would you have done
if I'd said no?

334
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,434
A stranger says you're the future king.

335
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,559
Maybe it takes a night,
maybe it takes a year,

336
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,353
but in the end
you're too curious not to come.

337
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,677
- You think you know me that well?
- I watched you since you were a child.

338
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,519
Tell me about my birth.

339
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,234
Your father, Uther,

340
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,631
desired a woman named lgraine

341
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,836
who belonged to a rival warlord,

342
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,791
the Duke of Cornwall.

343
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,309
Unable to best his forces,

344
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,116
Uther...changed tactics.

345
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,073
- And summoned me.
- To do what?

346
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,716
To change Uther to resemble Cornwall

347
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,070
so he could have lgraine
for just one night.

348
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,310
Am I to believe
I'm the product of sorcery and rape?

349
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,953
You were conceived that night.

350
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,399
Merlin, I want the truth,

351
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,034
not some story
to make me believe in magic.

352
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,479
I don't care what you believe.

353
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,239
But I've sworn off those powers
a long time ago.

354
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,918
- Why?
- Because they cost.

355
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,076
- Cost how?
- Do you want me to finish or not?

356
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,192
So Uther gave me to you.

357
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,118
You...were my payment.

358
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,352
Why would you take a child
as payment?

359
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,473
This realm needs a leader, better

than any who has come before.

360
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,558
With Uther's bloodline
and Ector's guidance,

361
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,113
that can be you.

362
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,276
I know you've got questions,

363
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,639
but I will be at your side

364
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,320
and we will find
the answers together.

365
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,470
We are going to build a land
full of hope and honour

366
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,068
where fear is extinguished

367
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,909
to which people will flock
from far and wide,

368
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,550
seeking out our beacon of light.

369
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,069
Tomorrow we ride

370
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,668
to an ancient seat of power.

371
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,870
You can be the greatest of men

372
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,636
in the greatest of lands.

373
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,070
Trust me, Arthur.

374
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,791
(Sword being unsheathed)

375
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,388
(Kay) Arthur!

376
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,159
I'm coming!

377
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,559
An outrider for King Lot.

378
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,477
These are Lot's colours.

379
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,955
You're not even installed
and you're starting a war.

380
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,354
Back on the horses.

381
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,671
If we're here when they find him,

382
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,711
you won't live to be king.

383
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,309
Camelot.

384
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,475
Yah!

385
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,518
(Creaking)

386
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,916
- It's a ruin.
- The Romans built it.

387
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,792
We'll create the future here.

388
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,399
(Merlin) It has good position,

389
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,750
strong fortifications,
and no one will expect it.

390
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,599
I thought there'd be armies,
and weapons and servants.

391
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,188
- And girls?
- There has to be more than this, right?

392
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,833
- I mean, I must have money.
- No.

393
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,270
- Why didn't you say so before we left?
- You wouldn't have come.

394
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,834
- You didn't say it would be like this.
- You didn't ask.

395
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,112
We're in a fight for our lives,
for the soul of this country.

396
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,800
Now, there are people waiting.

397
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,151
(Creaking)

398
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,879
The Great Hall of Camelot.

399
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,995
Meet those who have sworn
their allegiance to you.

400
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,151
Ulfius.

401
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,315
Leontes.

402
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,475
Brastias.

403
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,794
Pelinor.

404
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,357
Your father was a great leader.
Our loyalty passes to you.

405
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,278
We stand at your bidding,
ready to defend the Pendragon line.

406
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,999
I never knew Uther.

407
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,478
But if he inspired such loyalty,
I am humbled

408
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,909
to stand before you.

409
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,794
I'll do whatever I can
to justify your allegiance.

410
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,193
We are your servants.

411
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,993
These are your allies.

412
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,917
Your enemies
are much greater in number.

413
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,871
Something else
you forgot to mention.

414
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,878
King Lot of Lothian and Orkney.

415
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,195
The new Duke of Cornwall.

416
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,913
Kings Nentes,
Scotland, and Carados.

417
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,315
- I've summoned them here.
- You've done what?

418
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,992
So they all can recognise you
as the true heir of Uther Pendragon.

419
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,712
And what if they don't?

420
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,717
They must.

421
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,998
These are your chambers.

422
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,318
I had your father's effects
brought here.

423
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,832
What was he like,

my father?

424
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,038
Unyielding.

425
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,352
And that's it?

426
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,516
The life of a man,

and you take one word.

427
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,710
- That's all you need to know.
- No, it's not.

428
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,478
I want to know everything.

429
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,068
What he ate, what he drank.

430
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,952
How he stood, who he loved.

431
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,399
What made him laugh or weep.

432
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,919
And you give me one word.

433
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,952
Anyone else can tell you
his character and contradictions.

434
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,116
I gave you the word you most require.

435
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,708
The aspect you must take from him.

436
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,074
An unyielding strength.

437
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,838
Because from now on,

438
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,631
everyone will challenge you

439
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,352
on everything.

440
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,396
You need to be certain.

441
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,589
What if I'm not?

442
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,073
(Thud)

443
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,599
You have to be.

444
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,437
- What if I'm wrong?
- You can't be.

445
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,597
Oh, one more thing.
Uther also had a daughter.

446
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,711
Your half-sister.

447
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,468
He installs a child in a ruin
and expects the kingdom to kneel?

448
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,034
I think the sorcerer's mind is addled.

449
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,357
No, he's clever.

This was a power once.

450
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,630
He believes he can awaken it.

451
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,273
Are you all right?

452
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,871
The games of men exhaust me.

453
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,239
We ride in strong.

454
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,999
If this pretender wears
my father's robes,

455
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,519
I shall gouge his eyes.

456
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,069
On!

457
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,556
(Knocking)

458
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,998
That's your sister?

459
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,549
(Sniffs)

460
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,909
No.

461
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,112
He's Uther's son. I have proof.

462
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,232
My father had no legitimate son.
I would have known.

463
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,476
Honestly, this is as strange to me
as it is to you.

464
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,431
- But when Merlin brought...
- It talks, too.

465
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,513
It's pretty, it talks,

466
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,039
but it is not an heir.

467
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,196
We can work together
to honour our father.

468
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,912
You didn't know my father.

469
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,037
(Laughs) Look at it.

470
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,594
Not even a convincing pretender.

471
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,551
You're not made of kings, boy,

472
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,113
but of common clay.

473
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,879
How much did the sorcerer
promise you?

474
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,519
He didn't promise me anything.

475
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,199
Why are you doing this to me?

476
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,880
This isn't personal.

477
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,638
This is for the country.

478
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,352
This is my birthright.

479
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,469
Is it?

480
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,473
We should ask his mother,

Queen lgraine.

481
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,473
- You were childless.
- I never spoke of this.

482
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,636
This is some other man's bastard.

483
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,478
Not my father's.

484
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,875
I would have known.

485
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,429
And yet, you didn't.

486
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,234
Is this the boy I took from you
when he was born?

487
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,117
Yes, I believe he is.

488
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,438
This is Uther's son.

489
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,959
My son.

490
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,673
Oh, fuck this.

491
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,676
You think this is the end of it?

492
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,472
Merlin told me he changed Uther's face

493
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,795
to resemble your husband,
the Duke of Cornwall.

494
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,839
That's not possible.

495
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,951
No, it's not.

496
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,599
But I believe it happened.

497
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,359
There was a moment,

when I looked at him

498
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,959
that I saw another.

499
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,953
I saw Uther.

500
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,872
I don't understand. How did you
then come to be Uther's wife?

501
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,310
That night that Uther was with me,

502
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,998
his forces killed the Duke.

503
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,998
The vanquishing warlord
can claim the victim's wife.

504
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,757
I was lucky to live.

505
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,438
But you were pregnant with me.

506
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,399
You gave me up.

507
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,998
Merlin tore you from my arms.

508
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,236
Didn't you ever think of me?

509
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,157
You were my first thought
each morning.

510
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,798
I studied every boy's face,

511
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,319
hoping for you.

512
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,591
I was forbidden to search for you.

513
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,672
I'm so sorry.

514
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,955
Arthur.

515
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,119
Are you all right?

516
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,189
Yes.

517
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,152
What was she like?

518
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,679
How was it?

519
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,109
Fine.

520
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,189
That's it?

521
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,199
Come on, let's explore.

522
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,477
Let's look up here. Come on.

523
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,516
(Birds' flying away)

524
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,756
Here, look at this.

525
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,748
"Magnus Quintus

526
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,031
"built this fort

527
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,470
"in the sixth year of the reign
of the Emperor Valentinian ll.

528
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,715
"He who has begun

529
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,115
"has the work half done."

530
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,992
He wouldn't say that
if he saw the place now.

531
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,838
Think what it must
have been like then.

532
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,520
(Leontes) Or what it can be again.

533
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,359
- Have you been following us?
- Merlin's instructions.

534
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,879
I'm to keep you safe.

535
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,996
Keep me safe
or make sure I don't leave?

536
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,718
- Bit of both.
- What if I make a run for it?

537
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,989
(Leontes) Why would you?

538
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,918
You've got everything here.
There's so much potential.

539
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,315
- You sound like Merlin.
- I believe in what he's doing.

540
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,634
Why he brought you here.

541
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,356
You followed him blindly
when you hadn't met me.

542
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,391
No, not blindly.

543
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,511
Some of us feel
it's not enough just to fight.

544
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,631
There has to be a cause
worth fighting for.

545
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,309
Merlin's told us what's possible,
what can be built here

546
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,715
with you...a new breed of king.

547
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,159
How do I become that overnight?

548
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,119
Trust your instincts.

549
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,117
What if my instincts
aren't that of a king?

550
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,118
What if they are
and you just don't know it yet?

551
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,355
(Merlin) Who is she?

552
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,112
Who is she?

553
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,714
- Who is she?
- What are you doing?

554
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,319
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

555
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,714
Arthur.

556
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,193
You'd better see this.

557
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,552
This is all for you.

558
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,352
God help me.

559
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,513
What do we do now?

560
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,838
Show no fear.

561
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,632
Speak boldly.

562
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,273
Answer them as their king.

563
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,756
Nothing to worry about, right?
I mean, you've had visions. It's fate.

564
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,233
- It's guaranteed.
- No.

565
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,113
If you die, the visions will change.
Fate can go begging.

566
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,993
Destiny has to be won.

567
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,911
(Clattering of shields)

568
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,513
Move. Stand aside.
Make way for the King's son.

569
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,552
(Jeering)

570
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,193
(Silence)

571
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,238
Nothing can ever be the same
after this moment, Arthur.

572
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,630
Leave now and salvage your life.

573
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,672
Stay, and you lose everything.

574
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,797
You're outnumbered.

575
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,638
Don't be a sorcerer's figurehead.

576
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,234
Go home.

577
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,074
Speak, you beardless bastard!

578
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,031
(Laughter)

579
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,311
You stand in my hall in my realm
and you will show me respect.

580
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,079
I am the true and legitimate heir
to Uther's throne.

581
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,158
You will pledge your allegiance to me
or suffer for it.

582
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,271
Understand that, you bearded fool!

583
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,233
I'm sorry.

584
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,039
Bring him in.

585
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,669
That's my son, my eldest son.

586
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,756
And you killed him.

587
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,715
There were two outriders
in the woods that day.

588
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,319
The other one saw it all.

589
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,637
Hm?

590
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,193
He attacked me.

591
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,709
(Screams)

592
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,638
- No! You bastard!
- (Kay) Mother!

593
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,318
- Ah!
- (Screams)

594
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,793
No!

595
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,870
This stops nothing.

596
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,639
I'm no monster.

597
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,352
Five dawns I'll give you.

598
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,994
Five dawns for him to grieve

599
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,792
and then be gone.

600
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,435
But if you don't leave,
there will be more slaughter.

601
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,233
(Arthur gasps)

602
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,992
Stop him!

603
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,270
Stop him!

604
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,118
Stop him! Stop him! Stop him!

605
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,916
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Merlin.

606
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,429
What have you done to me?

607
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,357
What have you done to me?
