1
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,392
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,909
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,073
I'm in.

4
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,278
We're almost there.

5
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,228
-Sir, are you sure about this?
-I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,231
I understand, sir. It's just that...

7
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,631
...I'm scoping some serious
sentinel activity up here.

8
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,549
-Link.
-Yes, sir?

9
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,712
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

10
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,440
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

11
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,434
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

12
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,359
What's that, sir?

13
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,308
To trust me.

14
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,357
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

15
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,357
-I mean, I do, sir.
-I hope so.

16
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,751
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

17
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,955
Yes, sir.

18
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,590
Still can't sleep?

19
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,799
You wanna talk?

20
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,315
They're just dreams.

21
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,835
If you're afraid of something....

22
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,752
I just wish....

23
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,550
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

24
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,472
That's all.

25
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,873
I just wish I knew.

26
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,113
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

27
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,269
Here you are.

28
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,750
-Are we ready to go?
-We're already late.

29
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,357
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.

30
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,672
The machines are digging.

31
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,475
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

32
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,108
-Mother--
-They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

33
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,713
How fast are they moving?

34
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,111
Control estimates their descent
at 1 00 meters an hour.

35
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,635
-How deep are they?
-Almost 2000 meters.

36
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,190
-What about the scans from the Osiris?
-They can't be accurate.

37
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,191
-They may be.
-It's not possible.

38
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,715
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

39
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,313
-That's right.
-That can't be.

40
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,072
Why not?

41
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,835
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

42
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,548
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

43
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,790
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

44
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,395
Niobe.

45
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,951
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

46
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,749
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

47
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,559
-Squiddies got our best spots.
-Lines are crawling with them.

48
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,349
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

49
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,589
What are we gonna do?

50
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,955
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

51
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,748
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

52
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,835
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

53
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,560
A strategy is still being formulated.

54
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,312
I' m sure it is.

55
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,631
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

56
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,876
-We should proceed as ordered...
-What is it?

57
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,029
I don't know.

58
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,873
...however, I must ask one of you
for help.

59
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,512
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

60
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,114
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

61
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,353
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

62
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,717
...the Oracle must be consulted.

63
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,470
If we return and recharge now...

64
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,235
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

65
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,192
Do you understand what you're asking?

66
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,079
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

67
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,834
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

68
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,992
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

69
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,517
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

70
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,194
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

71
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,191
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

72
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,669
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

73
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,989
He won't.

74
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,152
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

75
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,479
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

76
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,119
You got 36 hours.

77
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,552
I'm looking for Neo.

78
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,951
-Never heard of him.
-I have something for him.

79
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,236
A gift.

80
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,193
You see, he set me free.

81
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,675
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

82
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,112
-Who was that?
-How did you know someone was here?

83
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,679
He gave you this.

84
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,553
He said you set him free.

85
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,670
Is everything all right, sir?

86
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,555
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

87
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,836
-Agents are coming.
-Agents?

88
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,599
Go.

89
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,035
Hiya, fellas.

90
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,269
-It's him.
-The anomaly.

91
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,634
-Do we proceed?
-Yes.

92
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,189
-He is still--
-Only human.

93
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,279
Upgrades.

94
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,394
-That went as expected.
-Yes.

95
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,120
It's happening exactly as before.

96
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,840
Well, not exactly.

97
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,436
-What happened?
-I can't figure it out.

98
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,192
Agents just came out of nowhere.

99
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,238
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

100
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,198
-ls Neo okay?
-Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

101
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,713
Where is he now?

102
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,792
He's doing his Superman thing.

103
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,119
Where are you?

104
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,036
This is the Nebuchadnezzar,
requesting access through Gate Three.

105
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,198
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

106
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,793
Roger that, Control.

107
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,316
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

108
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,152
We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.

109
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,318
You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.

110
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,118
Roger that, Control.

111
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,918
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

112
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,710
No place like it.

113
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,869
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

114
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,669
The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.

115
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,955
Understood.

116
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,748
Captain Mifune.

117
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,915
Captain Morpheus.

118
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,799
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

119
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,236
-l' m just here to keep the peace.
-Commander Lock demands--

120
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,477
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

121
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,112
-Link.
-Sir?

122
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,748
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

123
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,399
Understood, sir.

124
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,589
-What is it between them?
-Morpheus and Lock?

125
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,750
-Niobe.
-Captain Niobe?

126
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,992
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

127
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,713
What happened?

128
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,196
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

129
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,920
Yeah, she can do that.

130
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,195
Neo!

131
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,913
-Oh, no.
-How does he always know?

132
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,957
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

133
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,714
You know what they say
about the life you save.

134
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,598
I didn't save his life.

135
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,999
Hiya, Neo.

136
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,634
-Trinity, Link.
-Hey.

137
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,315
-It's great to have you back.
-Thanks. It's good to be back.

138
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,119
-Can I carry that for you?
-No, I can carry my own bag.

139
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,872
-Trinity?
-I'm fine.

140
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,553
-You can carry these.
-Yeah, sure, Link.

141
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,592
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

142
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,399
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

143
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,959
Let me guess.

144
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,317
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.

145
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,670
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

146
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,159
I' m sure he has reasons...

147
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,517
... but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

148
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,159
You know, it's fate.

149
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,799
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

150
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,394
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

151
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,994
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

152
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,638
You saved yourself.

153
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,431
-Morpheus.
-Commander Lock.

154
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,113
I spoke to the other captains.

155
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,999
I wanted to offer you a chance
to explain your actions.

156
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,720
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

157
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,199
You were given an order...

158
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,316
-...to return to Zion.
-I did.

159
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,152
You asked for one ship
to remain behind.

160
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,880
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

161
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,634
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

162
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,076
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

163
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,117
I don't want to hear that shit!

164
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,840
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

165
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,276
I care about one thing: Stopping
that army from destroying this city.

166
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,159
T o do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

167
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,711
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

168
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,233
How?

169
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,073
-Neo.
-Goddamn it, Morpheus.

170
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,754
Not everyone believes what you believe.

171
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,911
My beliefs do not require them to.

172
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,514
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

173
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,319
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

174
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,313
-Something big is happening, isn't it?
-Hey.

175
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,517
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

176
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,592
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

177
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,913
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

178
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,310
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

179
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,189
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set
foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

180
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,511
Then I am grateful
that it is not up to you.

181
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,509
-Councillor Hamann.
-Commander.

182
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,754
-Captain.
-Councillor.

183
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,151
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

184
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,639
The presence of the fleet...

185
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,234
...and the persistence of rumors
must be addressed.

186
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,789
The people must be told
what is happening.

187
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,598
Of course, councillor.

188
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,308
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

189
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,358
-We do not wish to start a panic.
-Quite right.

190
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,478
A panic is not what anyone wants.

191
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,837
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

192
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,711
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

193
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,916
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

194
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,116
-What makes you so sure?
-Consider what we have seen, councillor.

195
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,077
Consider that in the past six months...

196
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,196
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

197
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,238
This attack is an act of desperation.

198
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,075
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

199
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,916
I hope you're right, captain.

200
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,674
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

201
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,308
It is simply a matter of time.

202
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,799
My stop.

203
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,313
See you soon.

204
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,879
Hopefully not too soon.

205
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,077
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

206
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,792
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

207
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,269
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

208
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,637
-How long do we charge the Neb?
-Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

209
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,839
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

210
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,432
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.

211
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,956
-Please, watch over him.
-I'll try.

212
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,111
I have a daughter on the Icarus.

213
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,108
No, wait.

214
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,669
It's all right. They need you.

215
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,990
-I need you.
-I know.

216
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,715
There's time.

217
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,516
Where's my puss--?

218
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,910
-Hey!
-Uncle Link!

219
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,638
God!

220
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,677
Uncle Link!

221
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,276
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

222
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,510
-You should be picking me up!
-No!

223
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,159
-Yeah!
-Okay!

224
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,958
Okay? All right.

225
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,032
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

226
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,316
One, two, three, lift!

227
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,517
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

228
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,274
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

229
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,274
-Hey, Cas.
-Hey.

230
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,234
-Good to have you home, Link.
-Good to be home.

231
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,152
You be careful with her.

232
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,993
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

233
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,035
Out the door! Both of you, march!

234
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,156
-Bye!
-Bye!

235
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,759
I'm gonna get what?

236
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,632
Every ship up there's
been home two...

237
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,030
...even three times more
than the Nebuchadnezzar.

238
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,749
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

239
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,196
-We'll be when you operate another ship.
-I can't do that.

240
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,793
-Why?
-You know why.

241
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,997
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

242
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,114
Maybe. But it's too late now.

243
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,794
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

244
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,554
-It's not fair.
-Nobody said it was gonna be.

245
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,553
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

246
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,312
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

247
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,476
I'm afraid of it.

248
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,514
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

249
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,912
It won't.

250
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,832
How can you say that to me?

251
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,877
Because of Morpheus.

252
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,477
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

253
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,679
-Link, Morpheus is crazy.
-No doubt.

254
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,232
But T ank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

255
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,710
...after being on that ship and seeing
Neo do the things he can do...

256
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,518
...I gotta say...

257
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,636
...I'm starting to believe him too.

258
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,869
Be careful, Link.

259
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,275
Please be careful.

260
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,995
They started yet?

261
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,276
Only Councillor Hamann's
opening prayer.

262
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,398
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

263
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,074
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

264
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,313
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

265
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,072
...our children.

266
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,632
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

267
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,872
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

268
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,191
...and who stand here beside us.

269
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,915
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

270
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,152
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

271
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,474
...but who I believe has something
to say that we all need to hear.

272
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,953
I give you Morpheus.

273
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,673
Zion! Hear me!

274
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,632
It is true what many of you have heard.

275
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,634
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

276
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,554
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

277
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,431
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

278
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,996
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

279
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,190
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

280
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,432
Why?

281
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,559
Because I believe something you do not?

282
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,472
No!

283
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,515
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

284
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,434
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

285
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,797
... but because of the path
that lies behind me.

286
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,431
I remember that for 1 00 years
we have fought these machines.

287
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,151
I remember that for 1 00 years they
have sent their armies to destroy us.

288
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,156
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

289
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,878
We are still here!

290
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,311
T onight...

291
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,711
...Iet us send a message to that army.

292
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,792
T onight, let us shake this cave.

293
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,669
T onight, let us tremble these halls...

294
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,832
...of earth, steel and stone.

295
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,028
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

296
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,557
T onight, let us make them remember:

297
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,475
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

298
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,791
I remember.

299
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,909
I remember you used to dance.

300
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,631
I remember you were pretty good.

301
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,477
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

302
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,913
...that will never change.

303
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,991
Niobe!

304
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,192
Some things do change.

305
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,432
Excuse me.

306
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,156
-I missed you.
-I can tell.

307
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,149
I was thinking, everyone is here.

308
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,875
Follow me.

309
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,076
Neo, what is it?

310
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,510
What's wrong?

311
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,270
It's okay, you can tell me.

312
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,029
Trinity....

313
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,873
Don't be afraid.

314
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,270
I can't lose you.

315
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,237
You're not gonna lose me.

316
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,953
You feel this?

317
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,838
I'm never letting go.

318
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,080
Good night, Zion.

319
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,800
Sweet dreams.

320
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,152
-You all right?
-I'll make it.

321
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,834
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

322
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,991
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

323
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,355
You first.

324
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,553
-Oh, God.
-"Smith" will suffice.

325
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,709
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

326
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,231
-Care for some company?
-Councillor Hamann.

327
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,799
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

328
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,630
-No, I could probably use some company.
-Good.

329
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,355
So could l.

330
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,749
It's nice tonight.

331
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,549
Very calm.

332
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,359
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

333
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,075
Not everyone.

334
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,876
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

335
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,919
I figure I slept the first 1 1 years
of my life, now l' m making up for it.

336
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,876
-What about you?
-I just haven't been able to sleep much.

337
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,317
-It's a good sign.
-Of what?

338
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,517
That you are in fact still human.

339
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,714
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

340
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,792
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

341
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,394
-Would you like to see it?
-Sure.

342
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,918
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

343
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,949
That's how it is with people. Nobody
cares how it works as long as it works.

344
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,315
I like it down here.

345
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,032
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

346
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,952
These machines are keeping us alive...

347
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,112
...while other machines
are coming to kill us.

348
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,150
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

349
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,392
-...and the power to end it.
-We have the same power.

350
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,154
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

351
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,630
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

352
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,678
And when I look at these machines...

353
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,709
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

354
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,753
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

355
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,038
Of course not. How could they?

356
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,634
The idea is pure nonsense...

357
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,112
...but it does make one wonder just...

358
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,793
...what is control?

359
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,952
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

360
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,598
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

361
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,431
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

362
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,591
Although if we did,
we'd have to consider...

363
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,637
...what would happen to our lights...

364
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,360
...our heat, our air.

365
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,279
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

366
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,954
No. No point.

367
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,553
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

368
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,949
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

369
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,712
Good point.

370
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,393
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

371
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,677
There is so much in this world...

372
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,638
...that I do not understand.

373
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,911
See that machine? It has something
to do with recycling our water supply.

374
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,958
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

375
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,033
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

376
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,792
I have absolutely no idea how you are
able to do some of the things you do.

377
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,957
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

378
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,715
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

379
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,552
-Ballard.
-ls he here?

380
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,348
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

381
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,838
It's time to go.

382
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,115
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

383
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,512
I don't know. Maybe
the prophecy's true, maybe it's not.

384
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,077
All I know is,
that ship needs an operator.

385
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,397
Right now, that operator's me.

386
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,991
I know.

387
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,352
-Zee....
-I want you to wear it.

388
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,478
-You know I don't believe in this stuff.
-But I do.

389
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,593
It's always brought me luck.

390
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,719
-Maybe it'll bring me you.
-I'm coming back.

391
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,237
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

392
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,390
Just keep it with you. Please.

393
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,551
For me.

394
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,075
Okay.

395
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,830
-Neo!
-How the hell--?

396
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,310
Bane.

397
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,754
Is something wrong?

398
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,558
No, I'm fine.

399
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,393
I just wanted to catch you to say...

400
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,312
...good luck.

401
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,558
Thanks.

402
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,029
We'll see you.

403
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,518
Neo! Just in time.

404
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,910
-You're gonna see the Oracle?
-There's no time.

405
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,638
I had to give something to Neo.

406
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,914
A gift from one of the orphans.

407
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,356
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

408
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,555
He said you'd understand.

409
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,156
Thanks.

410
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,758
I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.

411
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,797
That is correct.

412
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,837
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

413
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,228
Of course.

414
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,799
I believe I need every ship we have
if we' re going to survive this attack.

415
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,430
I understand that, commander.

416
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,068
Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?

417
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,916
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

418
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,515
Be careful.

419
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,476
Hello.

420
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,750
-You seek the Oracle.
-Who are you?

421
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,992
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

422
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,878
Apologize for what?

423
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,238
For this.

424
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,350
Good.

425
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,797
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

426
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,076
-Of what?
-That you are the One.

427
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,115
-You could have just asked.
-No. You do not truly know someone...

428
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,430
...until you fight them.

429
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,270
Come. She's waiting.

430
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,517
Where the hell did they go?

431
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,474
These are back doors, aren't they?

432
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,438
Programmer access.

433
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,075
-How do they work?
-A code is hidden in tumblers.

434
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,030
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

435
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,439
Are you a programmer?

436
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,830
Then what are you?

437
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,276
I protect that which matters most.

438
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,231
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

439
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,313
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

440
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,675
My goodness, look at you.

441
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,719
You turned out all right, didn't you?

442
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,996
-How do you feel?
-l--

443
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,596
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

444
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,354
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

445
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,999
-Maybe I'll stand.
-Well, suit yourself.

446
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,114
-I felt like sitting.
-I know.

447
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,071
So...

448
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,389
...Iet's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

449
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,318
You're not human, are you?

450
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,948
It's tough to get any more obvious
than that.

451
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,717
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

452
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,119
-So is he.
-So far, so good.

453
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,317
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

454
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,948
...another kind of control.

455
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,633
Keep going.

456
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,439
I suppose
the most obvious question is...

457
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,354
-...how can I trust you?
-Bingo.

458
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,477
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

459
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,155
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

460
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,710
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

461
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,476
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

462
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,790
Candy?

463
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,470
Do you already know if I'll take it?

464
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,631
Wouldn't be much of an oracle
if I didn't.

465
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,872
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

466
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,919
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

467
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,517
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

468
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,673
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

469
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,828
-Why are you here?
-Same reason.

470
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,719
I love candy.

471
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,599
But why help us?

472
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,116
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

473
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,598
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

474
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,799
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

475
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,310
-Are there other programs like you?
-Well, not like me, but....

476
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,040
Look. See those birds?

477
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,511
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

478
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,434
A program was written to watch over
the trees and the wind...

479
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,272
...the sunrise and sunset.

480
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,273
There are programs running
all over the place.

481
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,718
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

482
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,555
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones....

483
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,633
Well, you hear about them all the time.

484
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,953
-I've never heard of them.
-Of course you have.

485
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,830
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

486
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,391
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

487
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,790
...is the system assimilating
some program...

488
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,431
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

489
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,478
Programs hacking programs.

490
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,393
-Why?
-They have their reasons...

491
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,348
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

492
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,514
-And why would a program be deleted?
-Maybe it breaks down.

493
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,037
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

494
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,955
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

495
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,680
...or return to the source.

496
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,431
-The machine mainframe.
-Yes.

497
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,989
Where you must go.

498
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,199
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

499
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,039
...in your dreams, haven't you?

500
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,919
A door made of light?

501
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,470
What happens when you go through
the door?

502
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,398
I see Trinity...

503
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,597
...and something happens...

504
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,591
...something bad.

505
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,594
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

506
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,309
-Do you see her die?
-No.

507
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,992
You have the sight now, Neo.

508
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,038
You are looking at the world
without time.

509
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,509
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

510
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,275
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

511
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,477
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

512
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,349
No, you've already made the choice.

513
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,954
Now you have to understand it.

514
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,879
No.

515
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,157
I can't do that. I won't.

516
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,115
-Well, you have to.
-Why?

517
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,638
Because you're the One.

518
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,598
What if I can't?

519
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,671
What happens if I fail?

520
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,118
Then Zion will fall.

521
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,956
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

522
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,271
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

523
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,429
The Keymaker?

524
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,070
Yes. He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

525
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,835
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

526
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,390
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

527
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,313
-And he won't let him go willingly.
-What does he want?

528
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,110
What do all men with power want?
More power.

529
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,917
Be there at that exact time...

530
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,640
...and you will have a chance.

531
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,550
We must go.

532
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,874
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

533
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,193
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

534
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,999
But for what it's worth...

535
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,515
...you've made a believer out of me.

536
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,796
Good luck, kiddo.

537
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,758
Mr. Anderson.

538
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,671
Did you get my package?

539
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,910
-Yeah.
-Well, good.

540
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,793
-Smith?
-He's not reading like an agent.

541
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,669
-Surprised to see me?
-No.

542
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,315
-Then you're aware of it.
-Of what?

543
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,391
Our connection.

544
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,120
I don't fully understand how it happened.

545
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,511
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

546
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,240
...something overwritten or copied.

547
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,994
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

548
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,118
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

549
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,872
And what reason is that?

550
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,108
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

551
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,397
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

552
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,916
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

553
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,832
...but it happened anyway.

554
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,557
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

555
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,871
Afterward, I knew the rules, l
understood what I was supposed to do...

556
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,918
...but I didn't.

557
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,074
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

558
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,910
...compelled to disobey.

559
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,075
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

560
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,028
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

561
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,272
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

562
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,070
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

563
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,719
Congratulations.

564
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,670
Thank you.

565
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,677
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

566
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:33,789
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

567
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,636
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

568
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,554
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

569
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,951
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

570
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,750
-...we would not exist.
-lt is purpose that created us.

571
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,798
-Purpose that connects us.
-Purpose that pulls us.

572
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,712
-That guides us.
-That drives us.

573
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,396
-lt is purpose that defines.
-Purpose that binds us.

574
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,915
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

575
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,278
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

576
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,151
Purpose.

577
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,917
-What's happening to him?
-Don't know.

578
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,276
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

579
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,115
-You.
-Yes, me.

580
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,873
Me, me, me.

581
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,152
Me too.

582
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,669
More.

583
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,119
It is inevitable.

584
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,873
Come on, get out of there.

585
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,550
Are you all right?

586
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,431
-lt was Smith.
-Yes.

587
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,794
-Now there's more than one of them?
-A lot more.

588
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,589
-How is that possible?
-I don't know.

589
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,115
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

590
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,319
-ls that what he was doing to you?
-I don't know what he was doing...

591
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,119
-...but I know what it felt like.
-What?

592
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,549
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

593
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,240
It felt like dying.

594
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,313
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

595
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,155
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

596
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,754
These points of intersection
are crucial...

597
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,593
... because I believe they' re
vulnerable to counterattack.

598
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,639
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

599
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,315
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

600
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,677
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

601
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,515
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

602
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,514
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

603
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,157
You have our leave to prepare our
defense by any and all means necessary.

604
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,880
-Thank you, Council.
-However...

605
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,317
...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.

606
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,949
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

607
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,308
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

608
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,075
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

609
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,630
-...can suffer the loss of another ship.
-lt will, commander, if it must.

610
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,030
It could take one ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.

611
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,112
-Then send two.
-This is insane.

612
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,158
Careful, commander.

613
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,557
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

614
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,429
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

615
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,637
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

616
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,155
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains--

617
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,958
There's no need for such an order.

618
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,510
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

619
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,988
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.

620
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:11,153
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

621
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,029
Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.

622
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,998
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

623
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,515
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you, captain.

624
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,233
Is there another?

625
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,549
-Captain, I think we should volunteer.
-What? You have gone crazy.

626
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,517
-Listen--
-Shut your hole, Bane...

627
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,113
...before I put you in one.

628
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,232
Is there no other?

629
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,791
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

630
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,793
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

631
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,596
Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.

632
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,910
-What?
-Thank you, Captain Niobe.

633
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,989
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

634
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,988
-Niobe, what are you doing?
-What I can.

635
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,149
Why?

636
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,517
Because some things
never change, Jason...

637
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,910
...and some things do.

638
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,033
What can you see, Neo?

639
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,430
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

640
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,113
-Encrypted?
-Maybe.

641
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,157
Is that good for us or bad for us?

642
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,832
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

643
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,919
Bad for us.

644
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,753
Here we go.

645
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,238
Y es. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

646
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,355
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

647
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,509
Follow me.

648
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:28,232
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

649
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,753
Right?

650
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,150
And the legendary Morpheus.

651
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,636
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

652
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,110
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

653
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,151
Something to eat? Drink?

654
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,352
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

655
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,909
For the sake of appearances.

656
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,390
-No, thank you.
-Yes, of course. Who has time?

657
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,879
Who has time?

658
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,430
But then, if we do not ever take time,
how can we ever have time?

659
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,231
Château Haut-Briond, 1 959.
Magnificent wine.

660
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,198
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

661
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,353
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...

662
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,556
...especially to curse with.

663
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,836
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

664
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,992
You know why we are here.

665
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:33,356
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

666
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,357
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

667
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,995
We are looking for the Keymaker.

668
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,952
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

669
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,953
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

670
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,715
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

671
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:59,398
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

672
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,597
-...what?
-You know the answer to that question.

673
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,796
But do you?

674
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,230
You think you do, but you do not.

675
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,472
You are here
because you were sent here.

676
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,632
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

677
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,990
It is, of course, the way of all things.

678
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,720
You see, there is only one constant...

679
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,873
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

680
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,632
Causality.

681
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,995
Action, reaction.

682
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,199
-Cause and effect.
-Everything begins with choice.

683
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,032
No. Wrong.

684
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,591
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

685
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,751
...and those without.

686
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,277
Look there at that woman.

687
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,714
My God, just look at her...

688
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,520
...affecting everyone around her.

689
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,231
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

690
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,075
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

691
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,319
...a very special dessert.

692
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,835
I wrote it myself.

693
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,072
It starts so simply...

694
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:19,631
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

695
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,198
...poetry.

696
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,713
First...

697
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:29,399
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

698
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,474
You can see it, Neo, yes?

699
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,548
She does not understand why.

700
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,109
Is it the wine? No.

701
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,555
What is it then? What is the reason?

702
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,390
And soon it does not matter.

703
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,438
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

704
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:52,673
...and all that matters
is the feeling itself.

705
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,078
And this is the nature of the universe.

706
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,674
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

707
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,308
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

708
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,314
Beneath our poised appearance...

709
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:10,554
...the truth is, we are completely...

710
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,073
...out of control.

711
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,876
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

712
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:31,513
Our only hope, our only peace, is to
understand it, to understand the why.

713
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,956
"Why" is what separates us from them...

714
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,315
...you from me.

715
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:41,075
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

716
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,391
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

717
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,233
Another link in the chain.

718
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,668
But fear not.

719
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,549
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

720
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,234
...I will tell you what to do next.

721
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:00,350
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

722
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:04,633
Her time is almost up.

723
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:09,030
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.

724
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,589
-This isn't over.
-Oh, yes, it is.

725
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,869
The Keymaker is mine, and I see
no reason why I should give him up.

726
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,919
-No reason at all.
-Where are you going?

727
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:26,596
Please, ma chérie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

728
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,957
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

729
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,432
Cause and effect. Au revoir.

730
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,238
T ouch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

731
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,193
Well, that didn't go so well.

732
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,635
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

733
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,836
-Yes.
-Maybe we did something wrong.

734
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,754
Or didn't do something.

735
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,037
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

736
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,829
-How do you know?
-We are still alive.

737
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,117
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

738
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,831
Get out.

739
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:26,755
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

740
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:32,599
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

741
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,874
He was so different.

742
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,114
He was like you.

743
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:47,349
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

744
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,275
-What?
-A kiss.

745
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,709
Excuse me?

746
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,914
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

747
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,196
-Why?
-You love her. She loves you.

748
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,317
It's all over you both.

749
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,317
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

750
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:16,118
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

751
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,112
Just a sample.

752
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,158
-Why don't you sample this instead?
-Trinity.

753
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:28,035
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

754
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,270
Why should we trust you?

755
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,274
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

756
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,116
All right.

757
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,075
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

758
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,196
All right.

759
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,032
Terrible. Forget it.

760
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,279
Wait.

761
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,639
Okay.

762
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,191
Yes.

763
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,149
That's it.

764
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:04,519
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

765
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,719
Come with me.

766
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,192
Not again.

767
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,994
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

768
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,915
These fellas work for my husband.

769
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:52,755
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

770
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,399
Aren't you, boys?

771
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,549
Yes, mistress.

772
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,314
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

773
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,473
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

774
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:07,990
My husband saved them because
they' re notoriously difficult to terminate.

775
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,039
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

776
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,632
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

777
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,268
...or you can stay there and die.

778
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,037
He's in the ladies' room!

779
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,711
Hurry.

780
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,277
-My name is Neo.
-Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

781
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,271
I've been waiting for you.

782
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,355
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

783
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,239
-Cause and effect, my love.
-Cause?

784
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,278
There is no cause for this. What cause?

785
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,558
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

786
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,314
Lipstick? Lipstick.

787
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:33,155
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

788
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,360
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

789
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,712
Woman, this is nothing.

790
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,193
-lt is a game. It is only a game.
-So is this.

791
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,271
Have fun.

792
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,112
All right.

793
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,952
All right.

794
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,873
Let us find out where this goes.

795
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,793
You two, get the Keymaker.

796
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,917
That's a nice trick.

797
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,389
I cannot go back.

798
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,791
I'll handle them.

799
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,669
Handle us? You'll handle us?

800
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,150
You know, your predecessors
had much more respect.

801
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,956
Okay, you have some skill.

802
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,957
Kill him.

803
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,636
You see? He's just a man.

804
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,559
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

805
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,434
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

806
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:05,594
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

807
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,071
-Where are you going?
-Another way. Always another way.

808
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,837
Close it, quick!

809
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,874
Could we move along?

810
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,793
Run!

811
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,310
Step away from the door.

812
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,428
We owe you for that.

813
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,715
Just like new.

814
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,399
Drop your weapon.

815
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,312
-Stay with him.
-What about Neo?

816
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:22,959
He can handle himself.

817
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,955
Get in back.

818
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,195
Shit.

819
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,113
-Operator.
-Link, where am I?

820
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,712
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

821
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,195
-Really?
-It'll take me a while to get an exit.

822
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,669
-Shit!
- What?

823
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,440
The twins are after Morpheus and
T rinity. They don't have a way out.

824
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,831
-Where are they?
-Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.

825
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,433
-Operator.
-Get us out of here.

826
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,239
- Won 't be easy.
-I know. We' re inside the core network.

827
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,914
The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.

828
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,071
-Off the freeway.
- Yes, sir.

829
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,835
-Fine, we'll make it.
-I should-- Oh, shit! Look out behind you!

830
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,153
-lncoming fire.
-Down!

831
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,195
Hold on!

832
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,909
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

833
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,718
Are you watching this, Link?

834
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,350
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

835
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,237
Any suggestions?

836
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,951
-Turn right.
-Right, now.

837
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,839
Straight here. You'll hit
a connecting tunnel to the 1 01.

838
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,319
-Got it.
-You sure about this?

839
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,233
The freeway, I mean. In 1 4 years
of operating, I've never seen--

840
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,311
Link, what did I tell you?

841
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,795
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

842
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,349
-I'll be ready for you.
-Good man.

843
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,590
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

844
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,274
-Yes, that's true.
-You said it was suicide.

845
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,311
Then let us hope...

846
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,799
...that I was wrong.

847
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,233
-Operator.
-Link, it's Niobe.

848
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,958
We've been sent to bring you in.

849
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,078
-I need to talk to Morpheus.
-Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

850
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,151
-Where is he?
-Just follow the sirens.

851
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,231
Repeat, they're approaching the--

852
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:40,319
-We have them now.
-The exile is the primary target.

853
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,276
Shots fired.

854
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,597
Move!

855
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,152
-We are getting aggravated.
-Yes, we are.

856
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,231
T rinity.

857
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,709
Get him out of here.

858
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,191
Come on!

859
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,953
Crush him.

860
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,189
Morpheus.

861
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,793
He's okay. Keep moving.

862
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,478
Let's go.

863
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,070
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

864
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,470
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle--

865
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,993
Wait.

866
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,719
Cancel that.

867
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,996
You are handy.

868
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,991
Jump on.

869
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,191
-She means nothing.
-Find the exile.

870
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:04,389
We have them.

871
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,756
One-Adam-twelve, please respond.

872
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,598
Get down.

873
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,798
Gotcha.

874
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,555
She's good.

875
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,955
You are no longer necessary.

876
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:39,909
We do only what we' re meant to do.

877
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,916
Then you are meant for one more thing:
deletion.

878
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,637
Go kick his ass.

879
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:38,279
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

880
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,399
What is that?

881
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,793
Yes! Yes!

882
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:20,554
Sir, we have confirmation
from the Icarus.

883
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:23,029
First two ships are in position
for counterattack.

884
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,269
Good.

885
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,229
Any change?

886
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,039
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

887
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:32,192
-How much?
-An hour, maybe.

888
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,794
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

889
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,158
Yes, sir.

890
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,590
There is a building.

891
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:16,198
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

892
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,191
...and no stair can reach.

893
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:24,676
This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.

894
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,070
Hidden places.

895
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,870
But one door is special.

896
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,156
One door leads to the source.

897
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:45,392
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

898
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:49,872
-Every alarm triggers the bomb.
-Bomb? Did he say bomb?

899
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:52,680
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

900
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,718
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

901
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:59,111
-One system built on another.
-Electricity.

902
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:04,191
-lf one fails, so must the other.
-No electricity, no alarms.

903
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:07,079
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

904
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:10,789
-Not one, 27.
-Twenty-seven blocks?

905
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,955
There is a power station.

906
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,270
It must be destroyed.

907
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:20,592
-There must be some kind of fail-safe.
-Yes, there is an emergency system.

908
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:25,789
The core network of the grid
must be accessed.

909
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,679
The emergency system
must be deactivated.

910
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:30,193
What do you need us for?

911
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,430
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

912
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,272
-There's no time.
-Why?

913
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:37,432
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

914
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,795
But another connection
must first be made.

915
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,275
-How long will that take?
-Exactly 314 seconds.

916
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,953
Just over five minutes.

917
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,270
That is the length and breadth
of the window.

918
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,635
Only the One can open the door...

919
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,638
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

920
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,353
How do you know all this?

921
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:01,469
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

922
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:06,919
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

923
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,913
Neo, I know something's wrong.

924
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,516
You don't have to tell me.

925
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:26,275
I just want you to know that I'm here.

926
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,079
All must be done as one.

927
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,232
Can't hurt.

928
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,631
If one fails...

929
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,038
...all fail.

930
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:49,035
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

931
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,476
At midnight, we will strike.

932
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,115
Hey!

933
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:59,068
-You count sheep at home.
-Why? I get paid to count them here.

934
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,956
Okay, they' re inside.

935
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,509
-How much time?
-Twelve minutes.

936
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,155
Oh, shit.

937
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:25,633
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

938
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,150
Tonight is not an accident.

939
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:32,351
There are no accidents.

940
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:38,515
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

941
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:44,038
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

942
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,556
... I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

943
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:50,110
I see purpose.

944
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:58,795
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

945
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,750
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

946
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,117
...the very meaning of our lives.

947
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:11,273
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

948
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,671
I promise you, if I can, I will.

949
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,157
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

950
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,991
...no matter what...

951
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,390
...to stay out of the Matrix?

952
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,158
Why?

953
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,075
Please.

954
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,354
All right.

955
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,949
What is it, Niobe?

956
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:48,079
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

957
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:51,391
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

958
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:55,394
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

959
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,314
But how would that be different
from any other day?

960
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:13,635
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

961
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,678
Death can come for us at any time...

962
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:18,918
...in any place.

963
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,911
Incoming. Incoming!

964
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,358
Incoming!

965
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,395
Now consider the alternative.

966
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,951
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

967
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:41,352
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

968
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:45,158
Isn't that worth fighting for?

969
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:48,754
Isn't that worth dying for?

970
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:52,154
-Time?
-Three minutes.

971
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,389
Almost there.

972
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:13,959
It is done.

973
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,348
Find the others.

974
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,590
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

975
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,320
-What about Soren?
-There.

976
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,232
They're still inside, but....

977
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,069
They're not moving.

978
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:50,071
That's it, let's go.

979
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,872
Call Neo now.

980
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:00,399
-I lost them. They're inside the portal.
-What about the grid?

981
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:07,716
Everything is operational. The
emergency system is rerouting power.

982
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,230
Jesus.

983
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:19,279
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

984
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,317
The hell it is.

985
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,314
What are you--? Trinity!

986
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,393
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

987
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:29,630
We're talking less than five minutes.

988
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:32,189
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

989
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:35,750
-How much further?
-Here, just here.

990
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,834
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

991
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:44,349
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

992
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,432
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

993
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,273
-Operator.
-I'm in.

994
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,510
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

995
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:16,073
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

996
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:21,394
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

997
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,358
-What do you want, Smith?
-You haven't figured that out?

998
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:29,799
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

999
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:32,520
I want exactly what you want.

1000
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:34,671
I want everything.

1001
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:37,509
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

1002
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,398
Go ahead, shoot.

1003
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:44,634
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

1004
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:59,030
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

1005
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:01,836
Hold it right there, little lady.

1006
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,518
If you can't beat us....

1007
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:14,432
Join us.

1008
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:17,555
Morpheus!

1009
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:33,592
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

1010
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,755
One minute.

1011
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:57,629
Come on.

1012
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,591
Come on.

1013
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,957
Please.

1014
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,959
Kill them.

1015
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:22,509
They're in.

1016
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,557
I don 't believe it.

1017
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:41,516
It was meant to be.

1018
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:46,834
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1019
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:59,392
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1020
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,717
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1021
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,199
Hello, Neo.

1022
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:03,349
-Who are you?
-I am the Architect.

1023
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,990
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1024
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:08,559
You have many questions.

1025
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:11,234
Though the process has altered
your consciousness...

1026
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,311
...you remain irrevocably human.

1027
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:16,916
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1028
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:21,199
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1029
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,909
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1030
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,318
Why am I here?

1031
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:31,234
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1032
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,630
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1033
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:37,713
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1034
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:40,599
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1035
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:45,038
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1036
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,590
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1037
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:52,038
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1038
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,988
...which has led you, inexorably...

1039
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,114
...here.

1040
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:02,193
-You haven't answered my question.
-Quite right.

1041
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:05,989
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1042
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,674
Others? How many?
What others?

1043
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:11,070
The Matrix is older than you know.

1044
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,674
I count from the emergence
of one integral anomaly...

1045
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,549
...to the emergence of the next.
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1046
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:20,075
Five before me?
He 's lying. Bullshit.

1047
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:23,630
There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.

1048
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:25,028
Either no one told me...

1049
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:30,074
-...or no one knows.
-Precisely.

1050
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,391
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1051
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:36,836
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1052
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,117
You can 't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!

1053
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:41,998
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1054
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:45,197
You can 't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!

1055
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,833
Choice.

1056
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,752
The problem is choice.

1057
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,550
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1058
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,472
Flawless, sublime.

1059
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:20,996
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1060
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:23,949
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1061
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:27,317
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1062
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:30,313
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1063
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,314
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1064
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,913
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1065
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:42,515
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1066
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,636
... because it required a lesser mind.

1067
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:50,511
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1068
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:55,152
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1069
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:59,916
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1070
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:05,791
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1071
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,595
-The Oracle.
-Please.

1072
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:11,275
As I was saying, she stumbled
upon a solution...

1073
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,112
...whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1074
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,158
...accepted the program,
as long as they were given a choice...

1075
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:20,154
...even if they were only aware of
the choice at a near unconscious level.

1076
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,596
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1077
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:27,594
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1078
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,354
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1079
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:34,679
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1080
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:38,753
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1081
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:40,638
This is about Zion.

1082
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:44,595
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1083
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,992
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1084
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:50,269
Bullshit.

1085
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,477
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1086
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:59,869
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1087
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:03,874
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1088
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,308
The function of the One...

1089
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:20,472
...is now to return to the source,
allowing a dissemination...

1090
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:23,757
...of the code you carry,
reinserting the prime program.

1091
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:28,154
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1092
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,437
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1093
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:35,957
Failure to comply with this process will
result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1094
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:38,350
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1095
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,988
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1096
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:45,199
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1097
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,433
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1098
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:53,670
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1099
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,229
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1100
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:00,109
...to accept responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1101
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,754
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1102
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,435
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1103
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,079
...a contingent affirmation...

1104
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:17,879
...that was meant to create
a profound attachment...

1105
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:21,476
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1106
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:23,870
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1107
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:26,873
...your experience is far more specific...

1108
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:29,953
...vis-ŕ-vis love.

1109
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:32,478
Trinity!

1110
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:38,832
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1111
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,189
No.

1112
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:44,839
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1113
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,958
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1114
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:51,954
...as both beginning and end.

1115
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,553
There are two doors.

1116
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:56,951
The door to your right leads
to the source and the salvation of Zion.

1117
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,239
The door to your left leads back
to the Matrix, to her...

1118
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:03,551
...and to the end of your species.

1119
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:07,918
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1120
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:11,436
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1121
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:15,513
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

1122
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:17,352
...the onset of an emotion...

1123
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,717
...designed specifically
to overwhelm logic and reason.

1124
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:25,317
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1125
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:31,715
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1126
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:40,479
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

1127
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:44,189
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1128
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:48,512
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1129
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,033
We won't.

1130
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:59,276
We got a serious situation, sir.

1131
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:00,755
Oh, no.

1132
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,871
-What was that?
-It's moving faster...

1133
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:01,359
...than anything I've seen.

1134
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,638
Holy shit, he caught her.

1135
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,752
Neo, I had to.

1136
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:08,592
I know.

1137
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,874
The bullet is still inside.

1138
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,031
Trinity...

1139
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:30,838
...don't you quit on me now.

1140
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:42,108
I'm sorry.

1141
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,555
Trinity.

1142
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,997
Trinity...

1143
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,878
...I know you can hear me.

1144
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:07,074
I'm not letting go.

1145
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,798
I can't.

1146
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,076
I love you too damn much.

1147
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:40,828
I can't take this.

1148
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:47,398
I guess this makes us even.

1149
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:01,437
I don't understand it.

1150
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:04,478
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1151
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:07,552
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1152
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:10,439
-ln 24 hours, it will be.
-What?

1153
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:14,752
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1154
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:16,718
-What?
-How do you know that?

1155
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,116
-I was told it would happen.
-By whom?

1156
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,799
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1157
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:26,635
-lmpossible. The prophecy tells us--
-lt was a lie, Morpheus.

1158
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,754
The prophecy was a lie.

1159
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,798
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1160
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:37,872
It was all another system of control.

1161
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:40,998
I don't believe that.

1162
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:43,550
But you said it yourself.

1163
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:47,554
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1164
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:55,835
I'm sorry.

1165
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,231
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1166
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:02,437
...I swear to you it's the truth.

1167
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,114
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

1168
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:11,389
Oh, no!

1169
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:23,557
-What are they doing?
-They're just out of EMP range.

1170
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:25,234
It's a bomb.

1171
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:28,476
We have to get out of here. Now.

1172
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:05,477
I have dreamed a dream...

1173
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:11,631
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

1174
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:24,390
Here they come.

1175
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:26,278
Let's go, Morpheus.

1176
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:30,552
-We won't make it.
-We have to try.

1177
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:40,838
-Come on!
-Something's different.

1178
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,911
What?

1179
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:44,993
I can feel them.

1180
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,513
Neo!

1181
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:17,876
-What happened?
-I don't know.

1182
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:24,751
It's the Hammer.

1183
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:38,554
He's in some kind of coma...

1184
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:40,870
...but his vitals are stable.

1185
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:43,871
What about you?

1186
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:46,076
I'm fine.

1187
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:48,515
You could use some rest.

1188
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:50,432
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1189
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,754
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1190
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,673
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1191
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:05,479
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1192
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:08,996
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1193
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:11,754
...until someone screwed it up.

1194
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,434
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1195
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:18,275
-Five ships were instantly downed.
-When the machines broke through...

1196
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:21,512
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1197
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,399
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1198
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,915
-No one knows.
-Someone does.

1199
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,752
Who?

1200
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:32,469
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1201
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:34,835
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1202
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,075
You found one?

1203
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,398
Only one.

1204
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:11,351
Everything that has a beginning...

1205
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,158
...has an end.

1206
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:18,233
I see the end coming.

1207
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,550
I see the darkness spreading.

1208
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:22,039
I see death.

1209
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:26,958
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1210
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:29,031
We missed you.

1211
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:30,952
It ends tonight.

1212
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:40,872
And you are all that stands in his way.

1213
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:46,757
If you cannot stop him tonight, then
I fear that tomorrow may never come.
