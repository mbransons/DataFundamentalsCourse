This is my husband Peter
and our daughter, Amy.

- Oh, you're about the same
age as our girl, Chloe.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,834
Once you've settled in,
you should drop by.

but you get the idea.

32
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,583
- Your mother chose
the fittings.

33
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,709
- It's like a display home.

34

- Good, that's exactly what
it is, so keep it clean.

the display family?

I'll show you your room.

- You at the new place?

46
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,041
- Yeah, fuck, it's
like North Korea.

47
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,041
- How's the family?

48
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,208

smiles, like nothing happened.

49

Is Rosie driving?
- Mm-hmm.

You sure about this?

51
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,625
- Fuck, Em, they had me
locked up. Yeah, I'm sure.

52
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,000
- Okay, okay.

53
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,208
- By the time they wake up,
we'll be in SA.

54
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,583
- Yeah, sure.

55
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,125

63
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,834

64

- No, not at all.

you guys are city types...

I mean not that you're...

68

- You're the Andersons, yeah?
It's on the billboard.

69
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,625
- You must be Chloe.
We just met your parents.

70
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:32,041
- Right. Yeah. I should
apologise for them.

71
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,667
- Hey, I need new sheets.

it flew off.

00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,542
Oh, excuse us.

75
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,000
- Uh, Chloe, this is our
daughter, Amy.

76
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,333
- Hi.
- Hey.

77
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,250
- How can we help you, Chloe?

78
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,792
- Right, um, sorry.

79
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,166
- I figured you guys could use
a cleaner.

80
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,709
I do all the houses
around here, so...

81
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,667
- Give her the job.
She's display worthy.

82
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,041
- We've got it covered.

83
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,542
- Okay. Uh, well, if you
change your mind...

84
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,625
- Thanks.
- We'll let you know.

85
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,208
- Okay. Thank you.

86
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:15,333
- We need a cleaner.
- Yeah, not that one.

87
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:16,333
What? Where there's one
teenager there's a hundred

88
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:18,959
with booze and pills
and dirty shoes

89
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,083
tracking over the floors.

90
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,041
You really want a repeat of
the last house party?

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,709
Fuck's sake!

92
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,709
Well, if they want to fly
first class from Shanghai,

93
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:49,208
fly them first class.

94
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,625
Well, if we don't move
those plots soon,

95
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:53,208
you can say "sayonara"
to the whole deal!

96
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,709
Yes, I know that's not
a Chinese word.

97
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,458
Just make it happen.

98
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:04,333
There's some potential buyers
flying in in a couple of days.

99
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,542
Need to make a
good impression, yeah?

100
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,959
- You can get your hair cut
if you want.

101
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,375
Maybe hit the stores
for a new outfit?

102
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,542
- Great.

103
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,041
- Great.

104
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:31,083
- I liked her.
That, uh... that local girl.

105
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,709
- Hmm? Zoe?

106
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,083
- Chloe.

107
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,000
- Chloe. Right.

( thumping )

109
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,792
- What is that?

110
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,959
- It's just the house.

111
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,375
She's making an effort.

112

- Don't we know it.

113

I know you're there.

Em?
- No, it's Rosie.

- Oh, um, hey. Hey.

129

Hey Rosie.
Um, where are you guys?

130
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,417
- We're at Em's.
We haven't left yet.

131
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,166
- What do you mean,
you're still at Em's? Fuck.

132
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,792
- Now's not a good time.

133
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,834
- Well, can I talk to--

134
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,959
- She can't talk
to you right now.

135
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,500
- Why?

136
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,208
- I mean, you can't force
her into anything.

137
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,125
- I never forced her
into anything!

138
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,125
- Are you fucking high?
- What--

139
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,291
- You know what a
bad influence you are?

140
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,667
- Yeah, I'm the bad influence?
Hey, fuck you, Rosie!

141
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,208
- Oh, fuck you.
Enjoy your night.

Help!
- Okay, okay.

Grab onto me.
I've got you, okay?

149
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,166
Use your feet. Come on.

Okay, okay, hey,
hey look at me.

Look at me.
Look at me.

to understand why.

165
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:49,583
- I don't know.
Guess I'm just bad.

166
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,375
- What if the police found you?
You know the deal.

167
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,875
No drink, no drugs,
seven o'clock curfew.

168
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,417
- Yeah, I got the memo, thanks.

169
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,291
- They'll send you
straight back to jail.

170
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,542
- There's all kinds of jails.

171
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,583
- Oh, Amy, come on.

172
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:06,333
- Don't touch me.

173
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,542
- Hey!

174
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,875
- You're to stay
on the property!

175
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,333
- I'll get her.

176
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:12,458
- Chloe, wait!

177
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,750
- Oh, leave her.
She might listen to her.

178
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,083
- Amy, stop.

179
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,709
Amy!

180
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,125
Where are you going?
- Away.

181
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,834
- You've got no shoes on.

182
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,083
Amy look, if you uh...

183
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,917
If you want to talk about
anything,

184
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,792
you know, seriously,
if you need a friend.

185
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,208
- I've got friends.

186
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,375
They were going
to pick me up last night

187
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,291
until you stuck your nose in.

188
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:52,667
- Amy!

189
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,291
Amy, stop!

190
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,166
- Fuck!

191
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,250
- I told your folks
I'd bring you back.

192
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,250
- Well, that was dumb.

193
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,500
And they're not my folks.

194
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,208
- You're adopted?

195
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,333
- Not just a pretty face, huh?

196
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,709
- What are you doing?

197
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:38,500
- Getting the fuck
out of here.

198
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,417
( chuckles )

199
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,583
( dog barking )

200
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,250
- Hey!

201
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,083
Come here!

202
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,875
Mojo!

203
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,834
Mojo!
Come here.

204
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,208
Come on!

205
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,458
Fuck sake. Come on, boy.

206
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,917
- Don't you fuckin' dare.

207
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,417
( loud music plays )

208
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,709
- Pull over! Amy!

209
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:56,417
( screaming )

210
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,041
- Fuck!

211
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,917
Who leaves their car on empty?

212
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,709
What, are you sulking?

213
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,375
Come on, that was fun.

214
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,834
- Yeah, until we get
arrested it's great.

215
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,875
- Where are you going?

216
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:12,709
- To tell your folks.

217
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,000
- Kiss-arse.

218
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,667
So what, you're just
gonna abandon me?

219
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,375
Hey!

220
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,083
Hey!

221
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,333
Don't think I'm just gonna let
you waltz right back

222
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,375
into your cushy cleaning job.

223
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,667
Car thief.

224
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,667
- Fuck, if you wanna leave,
just leave.

225
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,583
There's a bus that goes
through town every afternoon.

226
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,583
Get on it.

227
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,208
Or are you all talk?

228
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,417
- I just stole a fucking car.

229
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,333
- Yeah, how's that
working out for you?

230
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,709
( grunts )

231
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:21,291
- What time's this bus?
- I don't know. 3:00?

232
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,709
- Fuck.

233
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,834
- Here, let me.

234
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,667
There's glass in it.

235
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,583
- No, I just can't do it.

236
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:49,375
The whole happy families
routine.

237
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,500
They're number five.

238
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,709
Been with them
since I was twelve.

239
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,792
Part of Michelle's
Catholic guilt trip.

240
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,041
- Sounds fair.

241
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,583
- Well it's true.

242
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,667
They, um...

243
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,125
They adopted out a baby girl
when they were at Uni,

244
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,166
and Michelle couldn't
have kids after that.

245
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,166
I'm her penance.

246
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,041
- You're really working
that angle, aren't you?

247
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,458
- Yeah.

248
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,125
I had this party at
the old house

249
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,875
and it all got pretty loose.

250
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:40,250
Like we trashed the place.

251
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:45,041
- Hey, it's all here.

252
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,834
- Michelle called the cops and

253
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:53,542
I glassed one of the pricks when
he crash tackled my girlfriend.

254
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,291
Ex-girlfriend.

255
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,583
Hey, um, come with me.

256
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,583
- I can't leave my folks.

257
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,709
Good luck.

258
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,667
( bus stops, door opens )

259
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,875
- Where am I gonna go?

260
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,625
- Did you ever try
to find your real folks?

261
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:51,750
- Fuck, who says folks?

262
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:55,083
Nuh, they didn't want me then.
Why would they want me now?

263
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:55,667
- Friend at school did.

264
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,083
- And?

265
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,375
- Yeah, he said it helped.

266
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,792
- I don't need help.

267
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,000
- Right.

268
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,125
( Amy laughs )

269
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,667
- When was the last time
you heard that?

270
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,709
- Can Chloe stay for dinner?

271
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,000
Her Mum said it's okay.

272
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,083
- Sure.

273
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,333
- What?

274
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,792
( water running )

275
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:53,166
- You're wearing my clothes.

276
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,542
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I hope you don't mind.

277
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,166
I can... I can change
if you want.

278
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,875
- It's cool.

279
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,041
I just wish
I looked like that.

280
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,250
- Tell us about yourself, Chloe.
What do your parents do?

281
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,000
- Oh, they're um,
they're farmers.

282
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:13,583
- Oh, what kind? I studied vet
science, then I got married.

283
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,667
- Oh, just you know,
cows and sheep and stuff.

284
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,000
- And what about you?
You going to stay on the farm?

285
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:24,000
- No, no. Um...

286
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,166
I really like fashion
and design,

287
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,333
so I'd like to study
interior design.

288
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:31,458
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

289
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,291
- What's with the
twenty questions?

290
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,834
Just let her eat.

291
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,000
( giggling )

292
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:52,041
Amy Samantha Anderson.

293
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,166
17 years old.

294
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:00,208
That's disgusting.

295
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,875
- Eating meat's disgusting.

296
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,208
- Okay, so you're a vegetarian.

297
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,417
- I eat pussy.

298
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,083
- What do you want
to say about yourself?

299
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:12,750
"I'm a high achieving
straight A student.

300
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:18,083
My hobbies are horseriding
and swimming."

301
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,709
- I'm looking for my parents,

302
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,291
not a date with
somebody called Chad.

303
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:24,250
- You gotta grab
their attention.

304
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:28,500
- Okay, "My adoptive parents
fully support me on this.

305
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,959
"If you're out there,
Mum and Dad,

306
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,375
I'd love to get
in contact with you."

307
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,959
- There's two Ps in support.

308
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,417
And why'd you capitalise
"Adoptive Parents"?

309
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,125
Move.

310
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,917
Oh, or is it better if they
think I'm dyslexic?

311
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,667
Okay.

312
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,500
- Send it.

313
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,959
- Amy?
- No!

314
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,208
- It's late.

315
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,291
- No, it's not.

316
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,834
- I should go.

317
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:29,875
Thank you so much.

318
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,166
- You're welcome.

319
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,166
- You sure you don't
need a lift?

320
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,166
- Oh no, there's
a shortcut over the hill.

321
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,709
Actually, you can
see the river.

322
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:38,959
I should show you sometime.
- It's a date.

323
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:42,000
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

324
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,709
- You think her parents'd swap?
- Don't!

325
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:47,291
You could ask.

326
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:56,083
( water running )

327
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,500
( moaning )

328
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:45,000
( phone chimes )

329
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,083
- Shit.

330
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,500
( phone dialing )

331
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,417
- Hey.
- CHLOE: Hey. Hi.

332
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,542
- I got an email.

333
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,208
- CHLOE: From who?
- My parents.

334
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:16,875
- CHLOE: Bullshit. No way.

335
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,333
- Fuck, Chloe, they...

336
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:20,875
They want to meet.

337
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,125
- Hello!

338
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:35,333
What have you done with Amy?

339
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,709
- Ah, Chloe invited me over.

340
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,959
Just for a few hours.

341
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,291
- Okay. Just so long as
you're back before dark.

342
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,125
- Hey!

343
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,417
Yeah you, princess!

344
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,875
- I told you,
this was private property!

345
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,375
- Yeah? And so is our
fuckin' car!

346
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,667
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

347
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,709
- The car.

348
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,041
- Hey.

349
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,166
- Hey, leave her alone!

350
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,458
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Good luck with that.

351
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:00,375
- One...

352
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,375
- Do something.
I dare ya. Come on.

353
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,500
- Two.
- Amy! Amy!

354
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,583
- Fuckin' stay there.
- Piss off, you dickwads!

355
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:08,125
- Fuck off!

356
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,041
- Go on!

357
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,417
- I'll see you soon.

358
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,709
- Fuck off!

359
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,542
- You're fuckin' all talk when
we're walking away, aren't ya?

360
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,417
- Fuck you, mate.
- Amy, what car?

361
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,709
- I don't know.

362
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:20,834
- So I can report this?
- Do whatever you want.

363
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:24,041
- Like I'd steal their
shitbox anyway.

364
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,959
- It wasn't Amy.

365
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,625
She was with me all day.

366
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,208
I'm sorry about them.
Are you guys okay?

367
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,375
- Yeah.

368
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,375
Michelle just went all
tiger Mum on those dickheads.

369
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,333
Sorry, dickwads.

370
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,083
- You ready?

371
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,959
- Uh, yeah.

372
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:48,250
- Say hi to your parents.
- Okay.

373
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,417
- Since when you and
Michelle friends?

374
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,250
- Why do you care?

375
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,458
- I don't.

376
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,625
- Andrea and Bob Kovack.

377
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:06,709
Jesus, they could be anyone.

378
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:09,208
- Yeah, like your real parents.

379
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:10,417
- Yeah, but how will I know?

380
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,083
- You just do.

381
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,458
There's this connection.

382
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,917
- How do I look?

383
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,917
- Better.

384
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,291
Here.
You're nervous, come on.

385
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,375
To Andrea and Bob, bless em.

386
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,125
- What if they don't like me?

387
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,417
- They can take a ticket
and get in line.

388
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,125
- What do you think?

389
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,875
- Yeah, could be.

390
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,333
( phone chimes )

391
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:26,542
- Hi.

392
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:27,542
- Hi.
- Hello.

393
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,458
- Ah, you're the Kovacks?

394
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:33,041
- Sorry?

395
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,500
- Um...

396
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,208
- Look, don't worry.
You just got here.

397
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:45,417
Okay?
- Yeah.

398
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:52,208
( gasps )

399
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,250
- What am I doing?

400
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,709
- No, come on.

401
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:15,375
- Fuck this. Let's go.

402
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,542
- Come on, let's have
another drink.

403
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:18,709
- Nuh.

404
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:23,208
- Shit.

405
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,333
Walk.

406
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,583
- Oi!

407
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,375
- Fuck!

408
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:57,250
- It's more than trespassing,
it's harassment.

409
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,583
Well, what if
it was your daughter?

410
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,750
Right.

411
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,417
Serpentine's finest are going to
give the neighbors a caution.

412
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,625
We'll see.

413
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:08,792
- Hey there. How was Chloe's?

414
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,959
- Good.
- Amy?

415
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,750
We're meeting the investors
in the city tomorrow.

416
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:16,709
I'd like you to come.
I don't want you here alone.

417
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,375
- Fine.

418
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,709
( phone rings )

419
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,250
- Everything okay?

420
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,667
Family tradition says
I should wait

421
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,250
till you get married,
but, um...

422
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,917
I guess we're not a
traditional family, are we?

423
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,917
Can I?

424
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:10,000
- Um...

425
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:22,083
- It's beautiful.

426
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,500
You can tell me anything.

427
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,000
You know that.

428
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,083
- Thanks. For the thing.

429
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:43,458
( phone rings )

430
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,834
- What?

431
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,000
- CHLOE: I saw them.
Your folks.

432
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,417
They're checking into a
room at the hotel.

433
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,542
- Bullshit.

434
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,375
- No, seriously, I'm there
right now. I'll show you.

435
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,333
- AMY: How can I trust you?

436
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:01,000
- I thought we were going to be
arrested. I freaked. I'm sorry.

437
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,208
- What room?

438
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,834
( train whistle blows )

439
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:34,375
- Room six. You're sure?

440
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:36,458
- You ready?

441
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,917
- No.

442
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,125
Is that Michelle's?
- Kiss it out, bitch.

443
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:01,041
That's pretty.

444
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,834
- Family heirloom.

445
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:04,542
- Oh.

446
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,417
- They're not here.
- Come on.

447
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:36,625
Help me jiggle this door.
- AMY: What are you doing?

448
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,667
I thought you were
a good girl.

449
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,792
- Not always.

450
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:03,417
( Chloe chuckles )

451
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,625
- Chloe.

452
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:11,291
- Fuck em! They are.

453
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,667
Send 'em a message.

454
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:20,041
Go on!

455
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,041
Feel good?

456
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:34,041
Hey.

457
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,291
To, uh, bad girls.

458
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:42,834
- Whatever.

459
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,125
- Oh shit.

460
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:59,583
- Why do you have that?

461
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,417
- Show me how to use it.

462
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,041
- No way.
What if someone comes?

463
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,875
- Come on, show me.

464
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,125
( Chloe laughs )

465
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,000
FYI, this is a penis.

466
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,375
What?

467
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,625
- It's dumb.

468
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,166
I just...

469
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:32,959
I just really wanted them
to be here, you know?

470
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:38,208
Just to say, "Hey, I'm here.

471
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,709
I exist."

472
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,917
- Hey.

473
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,959
Hey, look at me.

474
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,750
You exist.

475
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:44,834
( moaning )

476
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,208
- Ah, fuck you,
you motherless bitch!

477
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:16,125
- What?
- ( alarm beeping )

478
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,667
- Shit!

479
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,041
- It's cool, it's cool.
It's okay.

480
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,500
- Fuck, Chloe.

481
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,583
- Where are you going?
- Home.

482
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,750
Home.

483
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:37,792
- Shit.

484
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,458
( water running )

485
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:18,291
( moans )

486
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,959
( knocking on door )

487
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:41,083
- You ready?
We're leaving soon.

488
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,750
- Yeah, I'm kinda feeling
a bit crap.

489
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,417
- Really?

490
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,959
Oh, you don't have
a temperature.

491
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:52,625
- Well...

492
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:55,166
It's just everything
catching up with me.

493
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,583
- Okay.

494
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,875
Just keep the doors locked
and if those idiots

495
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:11,917
come on the property,
call the police. I mean it.

496
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,834
- Hi, this is Chloe.
I'm not here right now,

497
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:15,834
but please leave a message.

498
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:18,375
- Hey, please tell me we didn't
leave the pipe at the hotel.

499
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:20,166
My prints are all over it.

500
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,375
I'm going back now before
they open up the room.

501
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,875
Call me back.

502
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,125
Fuck.

503
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:02,291
Get the fuck off our property!

504
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,875
- Christ!

505
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:05,500
Didn't you hear me knock?

506
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,542
Amy Anderson?
- Why, are you a cop?

507
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,125
- Is that a yes?

508
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,500
- Look, I don't have
to answer anything

509
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,458
without a guardian
or a lawyer present.

510
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:17,667
- So you're alone?

511
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,625
- This is bullshit.
I didn't do anything.

512
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:27,417
- Detective Daniels.
I'm looking for her.

513
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,917
- Jessica?

514
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,792
- Or Jessie?

515
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:34,166
- No, I don't know a Jessica.

516
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,375
- Right.

517
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:38,250
What about your Mum and Dad?

518
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,667
- Nuh. We just moved in.

519
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:43,000
- Right.

520
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:50,417
- What'd she do?

521
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,917
- Hurt someone.

522
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:55,917
- She turns up...

523
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,166
Call.

524
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,417
She's trouble.
Think quick.

525
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,250
- Mr. Buchanan?

526
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,834
- You're here to see Chloe.

527
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:34,667
Hey, Chloe!
You got a visitor!

528
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,750
- Ah, sorry.

529
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,417
Hey, uh, you need to call me.

530
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:58,875
( water running )

531
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:25,083
( rustling )

532
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:32,041
- Oh God!
- Fuck!

533
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,083
- Where...what are--
what are you doing here?

534
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,583
I thought you were
in the city.

535
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,834
- Me? What are
you doing here?

536
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:41,542
- I'm cleaning.
Michelle rostered me on.

537
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,333
- Cleaning?

538
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:47,625
- Yeah. Ah, the hot water's out
at our house, so...

539
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,333
What's wrong?
My phone was dead.

540
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:54,750
- There was someone here
asking about you.

541
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:57,333
Who?

542
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,166
- A detective.

543
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,375
Some tough old bitch.

544
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,375
- What'd you tell her?

545
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:05,667
- Well, what's to tell?

546
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,208
All I know is you live
a K up the road,

547
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,792
third house on
the left, yeah?

548
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:13,250
- Okay, look, don't tell
your folks but

549
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,000
some money went missing at
this house I used to clean.

550
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,250
I mean it wasn't me but,

551
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,417
you know, try telling
the owners that.

552
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,542
- Fuck, you're good.

553
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,750
Who's Jessie Cooper?

554
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,375
- Uh...

555
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:27,291
Well, um...

556
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,750
She's...

557
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:32,583
I...

558
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,709
This is it.

559
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,500
- How long have you been here?

560
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,709
- A couple of weeks.

561
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:01,250
- Fuck.

562
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:04,166
Why didn't you say?

563
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,792
- I didn't want you to hate me.

564
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,917
Why would I hate you?

565
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,834
What's this?

566
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:32,417
You're pregnant?

567
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:37,041
- Check the name.

568
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:48,583
- Fuck off.

569
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,250
This isn't you.

570
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:52,375
- Isn't it?

571
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:54,542
- No way.

572
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,959
You're serious.

573
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:04,834
But you haven't told them.

574
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:06,333
- I didn't have to.

575
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:09,542
I mean, they know.
- How?

576
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:12,625
- There's this connection.
I mean,

577
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,291
I just felt it
the first time I saw them--

578
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:15,375
- That's bullshit.

579
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:19,417
So, what, you're adopted too?

580
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,667
Well, that's convenient.

581
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,625
- Yeah, see, we find each other,
you know. It's weird, right?

582
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:28,333
- Yeah, it's weird because you
kept it secret for so long.

583
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:29,709
- I didn't want you
to freak out, you know

584
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:31,458
and you kind of are--

585
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:32,583
- Yeah, it's because
you're full of shit.

586
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:34,542
Fuck, is...

587
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:37,792
Is anything about you real?

588
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:38,959
- Amy.

589
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,959
- How do I know
these aren't fake?

590
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,583
- Michelle had them stashed
at your house.

591
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:47,625
- Oh, cool. So now you're
going through our stuff.

592
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:50,625
So you're a thief
and a con artist.

593
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,333
- Amy!

594
00:50:54,417 --> 00:50:55,792
Amy!

595
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,625
Amy, Amy please,
I'm telling the truth.

596
00:50:58,709 --> 00:51:00,583
- Who is, Chloe or Jessie?

597
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:02,291
Maybe I'll just
ask the detective.

598
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,208
( Chloe shouts )

599
00:51:08,542 --> 00:51:09,917
- Amy?

600
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,875
( sobbing )

601
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,500
( panting )

602
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:31,917
Hey.

603
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:33,875
Hey, I'm sorry.

604
00:51:33,959 --> 00:51:36,625
- Ow--
- Shh, shh.

605
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:38,583
I'm sorry.

606
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:41,333
It's okay.

607
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:43,333
I'm going to take you
to the hospital.

608
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:00,500
( Amy groans )

609
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,000
- Just rest.

610
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:12,041
( car engine starts )

611
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:14,625
( car beeps )

612
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:17,959
- Mum?

613
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:17,333
- Perfect time of day
to show it off.

614
00:54:17,417 --> 00:54:19,000
Designed that way, of course.

615
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:21,667
- The door's open.

616
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,959
- This is very nice.

617
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:28,834
- Buy the other plots,
I'll throw it in for free.

618
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:30,834
Well, for cost at least.

619
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:33,750
Should we take the tour?

620
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,417
- What?

621
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,834
- The Beamer.

622
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:42,083
- Peter!

623
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,750
Jesus.

624
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,291
Amy!

625
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:52,834
- Holy shit!

626
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:54,875
We'll deal with it.
Just get them out of here.

627
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,041
- Amy!
- You said she was clean.

628
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:58,125
- She is. Just go, please.

629
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,125
We'll talk about it tonight.

630
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:02,500
That's it.
- This is Amy.

631
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,041
Go fuck yourself at the beep.

632
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:06,667
- You win, Amy, okay?
You want out, you're out.

633
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,166
You come back here, I will haul
your arse to the cops myself.

634
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,125
Fuck!

635
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:13,792
Hey, come on.
We have to be strong.

636
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:16,792
- If I was strong
we wouldn't have moved!

637
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18,417
- Michelle!

638
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,875
- Didn't I say
she'd hate it here?

639
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:20,834
- Don't you dare.
This is not our fault.

640
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,667
We have bent over
backwards for that girl.

641
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:23,792
- Oh, just move on, right?
Get over it.

642
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:26,083
- Fuck it. Yes.

643
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:29,041
Why should we all suffer
because you feel guilty?

644
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,000
We could have adopted a baby

645
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:32,792
but no you had to choose
the most fucked up kid

646
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,667
you could find.

647
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,583
- You're talking about
our daughter.

648
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:38,875
- She wants out, Michelle.
Let her go.

649
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,917
Where're you going?

650
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,625
- To find her.

651
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:46,583
- Michelle!

652
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:49,083
Hey, Michelle!

653
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,959
For fuck's sake!

654
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:16,083
- This is Amy.
Go fuck yourself at the beep.

655
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:19,959
- PETER: Amy, it's Dad.

656
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:23,750
I'm sorry about
what I said before.

657
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:25,291
Please come home.

658
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:29,500
We love you.

659
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:32,917
Anything?

660
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,166
- I checked with all
her old friends.

661
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,458
The ones she told us
about, anyway.

662
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:38,083
- We have to report her missing.

663
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:39,792
She's going to end up in
detention one way or another.

664
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:43,208
Better for breaking parole than
on some drug or burglary charge.

665
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,667
She turned up to see Amy.

666
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:53,417
- I don't know if it's anything,
but I found this in her room.

667
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:58,625
- Did she ever say anything
about leaving?

668
00:56:58,709 --> 00:57:00,834
- Not, uh, not leaving.

669
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,542
- What?

670
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:05,333
Chloe, if you
know something...

671
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:08,500
- The night that I, um,
found her on the bridge...

672
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:13,834
I think she was gonna jump
if I hadn't...

673
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:16,000
you know, gotten there.

674
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,542
It's not your fault.

675
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:29,083
- Amy?

676
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:38,625
- Shit.

677
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:45,333
- Peter.

678
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:46,375
Oh my God.

679
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:50,041
- Stay back.
- Hey. Amy!

680
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:51,834
Darling!

681
00:57:59,208 --> 00:57:59,917
Amy!

682
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,208
- Amy!

683
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,625
- Hello!

684
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:09,041
- Amy?

685
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,041
Amy!

686
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,709
( phone vibrating )

687
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:21,834
Amy!

688
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:24,250
- Amy, darling, please
let us know you're okay.

689
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:25,291
We're so worried.

690
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:27,000
- Amy!

691
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
( phone beeps )

692
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:32,041
Amy!

693
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:34,417
- Hey!

694
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:38,417
- What is it?

695
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:43,041
- It's Amy's.
She sent me a message.

696
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:45,583
- "Tell Mum and Dad
not to freak. I'm okay.

697
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,542
In town, trying to
get a lift."

698
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,917
- We can still catch her.

699
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,959
- What?

700
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:59,667
- "Mum and Dad"?

701
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:08,041
( groaning )

702
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:18,041
- Hey!

703
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,625
Wait!

704
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,458
( groans )

705
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:37,625
- If we can't find her,
we're going to the police.

706
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:41,166
You don't mind
giving a statement?

707
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,667
- What... What do I say?

708
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:46,250
- Just anything that
can help us find her.

709
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,375
- But I told you
everything I know.

710
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,417
- Oh, come on.

711
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,250
( phone vibrates )

712
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:59,291
Come on come on come on.

713
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:56,125
- Oh, fuck.

714
01:00:58,542 --> 01:01:00,250
Fuck!

715
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:09,083
Fuck! Fuck!

716
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,709
Fuck.

717
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,500
- Ah, can I help you?

718
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:47,125
- Yeah, I need
to use your phone.

719
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,959
- I know you.

720
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,208
You're famous, right?

721
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:57,208
You're the girl off the TV.

722
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,041
- Come here you little vandal!

723
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,208
( groans )

724
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,000
- Fuck!

725
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,291
Hey! Hey, hey are you
going down there?

726
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:18,250
Hey!

727
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:20,959
Hey! Pete!

728
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:23,709
Hey! Peter!

729
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:32,542
- I really... I don't...
I don't feel good.

730
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:34,542
I need to... I need to get out.
Please, stop.

731
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:35,500
- What about your statement?

732
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:38,000
- I really don't feel well.

733
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:39,834
We can do it
another time, right?

734
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:42,333
- Listen, it's okay,
it's okay.

735
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,542
- The police station's
just here.

736
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:49,667
- She's gonna be alright.

737
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,208
- Yeah.

738
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:58,750
- What was that?

739
01:02:58,834 --> 01:03:00,792
- I don't know. She's upset.
Amy's her friend.

740
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:03,250
( phone rings )

741
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:05,500
- Amy!

742
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:08,959
Hello?
- ( muffled crying )

743
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:10,458
- Hello?

744
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:12,917
- Hon, is that you?

745
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,375
- I'm sorry, Mum.

746
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,041
- Where are you?

747
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:22,542
- Please, I'm safe.
Don't look for me.

748
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:26,250
- No Amy, hang on.
Who are you with?

749
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:28,041
Amy--
- ( phone beeps )

750
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,625
- Call her again.

751
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,083
( phone rings )

752
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,041
- Fuck me.

753
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:56,208
Hello? Detective Daniels,
this is Amy Anderson.

754
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,417
We spoke yesterday
about Jessie.

755
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,583
Um...

756
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:02,000
You said to call if she--
- ( door opens )

757
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:08,792
- Amy, I know you're here!

758
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:12,208
Are you all right?

759
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,208
- She's here.
- Amy, I'm sorry.

760
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:19,959
Amy?

761
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
My God, we're all
freaking out.

762
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:28,208
Amy?

763
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:34,792
Amy?

764
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,208
Amy?

765
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:46,375
Amy, I'm sorry.

766
01:04:49,709 --> 01:04:51,166
Amy, please just tell me--

767
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,667
- Get the fuck out of my house.
Get out!

768
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:54,959
- But I didn't mean
any of this to happen!

769
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,959
- Now! Go! Get out of my house!
Go!

770
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:58,709
- Amy, you're not
thinking straight.

771
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,417
- Get out!
- You're not thinking straight.

772
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,166
I'll make you some food.
I'll get you some coffee.

773
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:01,875
- No, you're not
listening to me.

774
01:05:01,959 --> 01:05:04,083
I want you out of my house.

775
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,792
- It was an accident, Amy.
- Bullshit!

776
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:07,834
You've been trying to get rid
of me from the start.

777
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:11,709
The cops at the pub.
Fuck, my biological parents?

778
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:12,792
Where did you get that photo?

779
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:17,458
- Why would I do that?
- Stop lying!

780
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:19,291
- Okay fine, I got the photo
from a magazine, okay?

781
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:23,166
You were talking about leaving.
I was trying to help you.

782
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,792
- By trying to kill me,
you psycho cunt?

783
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,208
- Okay, see,
I knew you'd hate me.

784
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:30,709
- Gimme back my necklace.

785
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:33,542
- No.
- Why?

786
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,250
- I can't. Mum said it should
stay in the family.

787
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,625
- Mum?

788
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:39,041
- I'm sorry, Michelle.

789
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:40,083
That's what you call her,
isn't it?

790
01:05:47,417 --> 01:05:49,000
( grunting )

791
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:06,750
- Help!

792
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,291
Help!

793
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:14,291
Help!

794
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:33,375
( grunts )

795
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:36,208
- We don't want her charged,
just found

796
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:38,875
before she hurts herself.

797
01:06:45,542 --> 01:06:47,583
- We've checked with
all her friends.

798
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:49,250
- And what about anyone local?

799
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,583
- There's only Chloe,
but she was here this morning

800
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:52,542
helping us clean up.

801
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:54,125
- Chloe Buchanan?

802
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,417
Okay.

803
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,542
I thought I saw her working
at the supermarket.

804
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:02,834
- Amy!

805
01:07:03,709 --> 01:07:06,792
Amy!
Amy, stop!

806
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:10,375
Amy!

807
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:19,125
You'd better run, you bitch!

808
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:22,625
They don't want you!
Nobody does!

809
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:28,709
( screams )

810
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:39,166
( sobbing )

811
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,291
- I'm sorry about your house.

812
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,667
- Oh, fuck the house.
Come here.

813
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:18,583
( knocking )

814
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,792
- Chloe!

815
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:25,959
- Amy, she's out there.
She tried to kill me.

816
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,667
- Jesus, this is going
to need stitches.

817
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:28,875
- Where is she?
- Ah, she's still out there.

818
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:31,333
- Come here, come here.

819
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:33,500
- Amy!
- No, wait, no you can't...

820
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:35,709
She said she wanted to kill us.
We've gotta call the police.

821
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:38,667
- She did this? Why?

822
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,667
- I don't know.
I think she's high.

823
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,583
- Where did you get this?

824
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:48,375
- Amy. She gave it to me.

825
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,458
She said she felt
like the family pet.

826
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:55,875
That it was your
leash around her neck.

827
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:03,458
I'm so sorry, Mum.
I've wrecked everything.

828
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:19,000
- Hey! Hey!

829
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:21,000
Stop!

830
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,375
( sobbing )

831
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:38,917
( knocking )

832
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,333
- Come on, Chloe.

833
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:42,375
Chloe, open up.

834
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:44,875
Chloe!

835
01:09:44,959 --> 01:09:45,792
- This is bullshit!
She's playing us.

836
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:47,875
- Why would she?

837
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:50,417
- I don't know. Nice house,
we've got money. She wants in.

838
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,125
- Come on.
- Chloe, come on.

839
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:55,500
Open the door.
What if it's her?

840
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:58,792
Hey.

841
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:02,083
Oh God.
- I don't feel very good.

842
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,959
- Please, I need...
You have to get me home.

843
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:20,959
- Are you all right?

844
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:24,250
- I need to get home, please.

845
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,166
- No, no, no, please don't--
- Dog.

846
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,542
- That's for the fuckin' car.

847
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:42,625
- I thought
she would want a sister.

848
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:44,625
But when I showed her, she...

849
01:10:44,709 --> 01:10:46,542
She freaked out.
She said I was trying

850
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:48,166
to steal her family.

851
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,625
I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't
have gone through your things

852
01:10:52,709 --> 01:10:54,125
but I needed some proof.

853
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:58,667
- You said the Buchanans
were your parents.

854
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:02,208
- No. No, I never lied to you.
I never. I just...

855
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:05,458
I didn't know how
to tell you the truth.

856
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:06,625
- How did you find us?

857
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:09,834
- I saw you in a magazine
outside one of your houses.

858
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:10,834
I could just tell.

859
01:11:10,917 --> 01:11:13,875
- From a photo?

860
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:19,583
- Why keep all
of this a secret?

861
01:11:22,917 --> 01:11:24,875
- I didn't think
you would want me.

862
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,458
- So you don't live here.

863
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,875
And your real name's?

864
01:11:33,792 --> 01:11:35,375
- You tell me.

865
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,291
You must have given me a name.

866
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:47,583
- I know it's hard
to understand,

867
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:51,709
but we were young and broke

868
01:11:51,792 --> 01:11:54,625
and I got really sick
when you...

869
01:11:57,542 --> 01:11:57,875
When she was born.

870
01:11:57,959 --> 01:11:58,709
- Michelle!

871
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:01,208
- It's okay.

872
01:12:01,959 --> 01:12:04,208
I'm here now.

873
01:12:45,834 --> 01:12:46,917
- Oh.

874
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:55,583
- I told you she was trouble.

875
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,709
- Are they really her parents?

876
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:04,333
- Open the glovebox.

877
01:13:13,792 --> 01:13:16,208
See if you recognise
anything there.

878
01:13:24,792 --> 01:13:27,542
She fixates.

879
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,458
This is not the first family
that she's tried this with.

880
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:41,000
- Detective Daniels, huh?

881
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:45,875
- Uh-huh.

882
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:54,959
- I've always wanted to live
in a place like this.

883
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:58,125
Big house.

884
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:00,417
Big yard.

885
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,625
- What about parents
or guardians?

886
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:06,375
Surely there's
someone we can call.

887
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:09,000
- It's just me.

888
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:11,417
- Chloe, you can't
just move in with us.

889
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:17,166
- Please don't
make me go, Mum.

890
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,875
- Jess. That's enough.

891
01:14:19,959 --> 01:14:21,709
- Amy!

892
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:23,291
- Time to go home, love.

893
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,834
- No.
- Yes.

894
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:25,959
- I don't know this woman.

895
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,583
- You're a lying bitch!

896
01:14:33,959 --> 01:14:35,208
Please, I'm your sister!

897
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:36,709
- Give me it!

898
01:14:36,792 --> 01:14:39,709
- Get off her.
- Give me it!

899
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:42,834
- Please, please! I'll
do whatever you tell me to.

900
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:43,625
Please don't make me go!

901
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:45,125
- Hand her over.
She's not well.

902
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:46,792
- Yeah, no shit!

903
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,375
- She's a con artist.
What are you today?

904
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:50,709
A cop? A lawyer? She lives
in fuckin' fantasy land.

905
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:54,709
- Okay. Her name is
Jessie Cooper, okay?

906
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:56,083
She is seventeen years old.

907
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:57,041
She was born in
Castlemaine Hospital

908
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,667
on the 15th of February.

909
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,083
Here's where they
dragged her out of me.

910
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:02,792
Is that real enough for you?

911
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:03,375
Let's go.

912
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:04,417
- No.
- Come on.

913
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,208
- No, she's a drunk,
old fat loser.

914
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:09,000
You're my folks, right Mum?

915
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,834
- Fuck this! Call the cops!

916
01:15:10,917 --> 01:15:12,834
- What, and tell them
how you stole the car

917
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:14,166
and how you trashed the hotel?

918
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:16,834
And how you tried
to fucking kill me?

919
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:18,667
You're next. She hates you.

920
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,917
- Get her out of here.
- She hates you!

921
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,083
- Get in the car. In!
- No! No!

922
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:26,959
( screaming )

923
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,750
- Enough!

924
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:31,750
I said enough!

925
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:39,333
- It's them, isn't it?

926
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:42,125
- There is no them, love.

927
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:45,875
- I'm sorry, it's just you
and me, like it always was.

928
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:48,291
- You're lying to me.
It's them, I know it.

929
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,375
- Please stop, Jess.

930
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:53,250
- My name...

931
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:55,041
my name is Chloe.

932
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,458
- What's she doing?

933
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:12,667
Oh my God.

934
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:18,166
- Get inside.

935
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,834
- Peter! Wait!

936
01:16:20,917 --> 01:16:21,959
- Chloe!

937
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:26,458
Chloe!

938
01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:29,208
Chloe--

939
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:30,250
- Peter!

940
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:32,333
- Get the fuck out!

941
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:33,417
Leave him!

942
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,458
- Dad!
- Leave him!

943
01:16:35,542 --> 01:16:37,000
- Chloe!

944
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,458
Stop! Chloe!

945
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:40,000
Chloe, just get out of here.

946
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:42,333
Just go.

947
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:44,166
Go!

948
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:53,667
Get him inside.

949
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:10,792
- Michelle!

950
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:19,166
Mum, move it!

951
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:25,333
Hurry!

952
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:27,250
( thudding )

953
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,750
- We need something to
put the pressure on.

954
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:55,333
Ambulance!

955
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:57,166
My husband.
He's been stabbed.

956
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,000
In the stomach.

957
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:02,333
213 Leonard Street
in Serpentine.

958
01:18:02,417 --> 01:18:05,917
We don't have time to wait
30 minutes. Fucking hurry!

959
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:09,000
She's still here!

960
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:14,417
( Chloe screams )

961
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,041
- Fuck off!

962
01:18:19,834 --> 01:18:21,750
- Where is she?
Where is she?

963
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:30,125
- Get him to the bathroom.

964
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:41,208
- Okay.

965
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:44,375
Don't go to sleep.

966
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:49,500
( growling )

967
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,208
- CHLOE: Mum, how is he?

968
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:57,083
- He's not good, Chloe.
He's hurt.

969
01:18:57,166 --> 01:19:01,250
- CHLOE: Let me help. Let me
take him to the hospital.

970
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:03,333
- The ambulance is coming,
Chloe, and the police!

971
01:19:03,417 --> 01:19:06,083
Please just go!

972
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:08,875
- Go where?

973
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:11,959
I'm gonna slit my throat.

974
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:13,291
One.

975
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,375
Two.

976
01:19:17,417 --> 01:19:20,333
- Three!
- Chloe, no!

977
01:19:20,417 --> 01:19:22,166
( thudding )

978
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,000
( knocking )

979
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:30,959
- Fuck!

980
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:33,458
- CHLOE: Mum?

981
01:19:33,542 --> 01:19:36,166
Mum, do you love me?

982
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:39,500
- Yes.

983
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:41,333
- More than her?

984
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,834
- Yes!

985
01:19:48,417 --> 01:19:50,583
- Then let me in.

986
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,417
- I can't, Chloe!

987
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,333
- Fuck!

988
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:57,208
- Stop, please! Just go!

989
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:11,083
( electronic music plays )

990
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:19,083
We can't stay here.

991
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:20,709
We've got to get him
to a hospital.

992
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:24,542
I'll talk to her.
- Mum, he needs you here.

993
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:26,208
- You're not going out there.

994
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:28,625
- He'll die.

995
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,917
- No, I'm telling you. Don't.

996
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,458
- Just get him to the car.
- No, no, no.

997
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:37,291
- Mum, it's okay.

998
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:46,458
I love you both.

999
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:21,291
- Stop it! Please!

1000
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:24,709
- Hey!

1001
01:21:42,709 --> 01:21:45,500
( electronic music stops )

1002
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:16,208
- Don't go to sleep.

1003
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:18,542
Peter, we've gotta get
you out of here, okay?

1004
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:19,709
We've gotta get
you out of here.

1005
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,583
( screaming )

1006
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,375
- Don't go to sleep.

1007
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:47,458
( screaming )

1008
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:56,542
( groaning )

1009
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:02,041
( shrieks, grunts )

1010
01:23:32,625 --> 01:23:34,291
- Chloe?

1011
01:23:36,834 --> 01:23:38,792
Chloe, don't bullshit me.

1012
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,750
- Why you...

1013
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:06,500
but not me?

1014
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,834
It's not fair.

1015
01:24:11,917 --> 01:24:13,417
- Hey.

1016
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:13,750
Hey, Chloe.

1017
01:24:13,834 --> 01:24:15,709
Chloe.

1018
01:24:18,542 --> 01:24:19,709
Hey.

1019
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:24,417
You exist.

1020
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:02,125
- Amy!

1021
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,959
You alright?

1022
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,875
Where is she?

1023
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,208
- It's just us.
