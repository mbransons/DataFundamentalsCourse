1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,752
Cadet troop forward! Ho!

3
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,884
Fours, right about! Ho!

4
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:42,019
That is right.
Fours, right about! Ho!

5
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,772
Form fours. Ho!

6
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,067
Second section, the man on the
right, number two, close in.

7
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,319
Come on, pick it up,
pick it up.

8
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,324
At a gallop. Ho!

9
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,911
To the right. Ho!

10
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,925
Troop, dismount!
Fall out!

11
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,804
- William Pender.
- Here.

12
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,806
- Charles Sawtell.
- Here.

13
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,517
- Jeb Stuart.
- Yep.

14
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,811
- George Custer.
- Yep.

15
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,980
- George Pickett.
- Here.

16
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,483
- Robert Holliday.
- Here.

17
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,193
- James Longstreet.
- Yep.

18
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,986
- Carl Raider.
- Yep.

19
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,696
- Phillip Sheridan.
- Here.

20
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,531
John Hood.

21
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,159
Hey, Jeb, take a look
at this saddle sore.

22
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,453
You think
that's serious enough to report?

23
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,830
I don't know, George, but I've
certainly got to report mine.

24
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,541
- Ooh.
- You boys can have the cavalry.

25
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,794
Me, I'm gonna apply
for the infantry.

26
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,797
Tired of playing housemaid
to a temperamental mare.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,799
That's the first good news
your horse has ever heard.

28
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,426
Go on, Gertrude, kiss him.

29
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,397
- Stand still you devil!
- Steady, boy.

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,024
If you weren't so hot-headed
you wouldn't hurt your mouth.

31
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,275
I told you before we started

32
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,653
you had that
curb chain on too tight.

33
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,780
It's not the first time
you've cut his tongue.

34
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,824
Ever tried putting a curb
on your tongue?

35
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,326
No, nobody else every tried it.

36
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,833
I suppose it takes one of you
southerners to handle a horse.

37
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,543
Well, at least, we know
how to harness them.

38
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,296
You know how to harness Negroes
down south too I hear.

39
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,216
With a strap across their back.
Come on.

40
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,138
When are you going to take
a punch at him?

41
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,890
Unh-unh.
Too close to graduation.

42
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,225
Besides if I waited four years

43
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,810
I guess I can wait
another week.

44
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:59,030
"The breaking up of the
American Union as of now exists

45
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,117
is the basis of my plan."

46
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,786
"And that destruction must be
made upon the issue

47
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,832
of Negro slavery
and on no other."

48
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,876
"The union must then be
reorganized

49
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,880
on the great principle
of emancipation."

50
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,300
"This object is vast
in its compass."

51
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,594
"Terrifying in its prospects
but sublime

52
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,388
and beautiful in its issue."

53
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,349
"A life devoted to it
would be nobly spent

54
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,019
or sacrificed."

55
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,563
"If the federal government
in its constitution

56
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,441
"are opposed to my way
of thinking,

57
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,235
the fault is not mine,
but theirs."

58
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,238
"And I shall continue to oppose
them with every means

59
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,824
and every weapon
at my disposal."

60
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,452
Who wrote that inflammatory rot?

61
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,663
A wise man by the name
of John Brown.

62
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,081
Mm, where did you get it?

63
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,042
That's my business,
if you don't like it

64
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,002
you don't have to listen to it.

65
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,213
You meant it for me,
didn't you?

66
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,674
- Take it anyway you like.
- Sure, he meant it for you.

67
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,051
He tried that abolitionists
stuff on me

68
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,969
until he found out
I came from Kansas.

69
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,681
Never mind, Bob.
Come on, Jeb, let's turn in.

70
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,726
There is no regulation against
a cadet having his own ideas.

71
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,354
But there is one spreading
treasonable policies.

72
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,649
You find the truth hard to take,
hmm?

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,820
Listen, Rader, I know the truth
of this problem

74
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,154
far better than you do.

75
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,447
The south will settle it

76
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,407
in its own time
and in its own way.

77
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,284
But not through the propaganda
of renegades

78
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,496
like this John Brown
or any of his followers.

79
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,707
You mean that renegade line
to include me?

80
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,252
Look up your oath of allegiance
and answer that for yourself.

81
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,046
I'll answer that
right here and now.

82
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,174
I've taken a lot of you
southern snobs.

83
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,218
For 50 years now
you have been watering

84
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,638
your precious family trees
with the sweat of Negro slaves.

85
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,807
Piling up wealth
and snobbery until now

86
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,934
you think you own
the government and the army.

87
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,271
And anybody who disagrees
with you is a lying renegade.

88
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,315
A rebel rousing traitor.

89
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,235
Well, you get this from me,
Stuart.

90
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:04,489
And all you other
Mason Dixon plutocrats

91
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,200
The time is coming when the rest
of us are going to wipe you

92
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,996
and your kind
off the face of the earth.

93
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,169
- Jeb, don't be a fool.
- Stop! Let them fight it out.

94
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,796
Hold it, Rader.

95
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,425
- Jeb.
- Jeb!

96
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,069
Attention!

97
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,789
For sometime I've been aware
that the disturbing force

98
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,250
has been active among
the regiment of cadets.

99
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,377
The exact nature of this
subversive campaign

100
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,338
and the persons
responsible for it

101
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,882
have not been fully known to us
until this moment.

102
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,301
Stuart, by every rule
of the academy

103
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,345
you should be discharged
from the service.

104
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,221
And your associates are
no less guilty for their part

105
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,182
in this outrageous affair.

106
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,976
Colonel Lee, any blame in this
matter is entirely upon me.

107
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,770
It's my sole responsibility,
sir.

108
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,147
That's not quite true, sir.
It was my fault.

109
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,815
We are all equally
responsible, sir.

110
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,776
That's right, sir.
That's right, sir.

111
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,611
If I believe that
you were guilty alone, Stuart

112
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,321
I should have
sent for you alone.

113
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,032
As for you, Custer,
and the rest of you

114
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,660
you must be taught
that lying to protect a friend

115
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,955
is sometimes an extremely
dangerous practice.

116
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,749
I'm not so greatly concerned
about the fight itself

117
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,584
as I am about its cause.

118
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,962
All seven of you men
violated the first sin

119
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,546
of military conduct.

120
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,424
The traffic and violent exchange
of political ideas.

121
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,760
Which are not the affairs
of an American solider.

122
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,889
You must be punished
and punished severely.

123
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,642
I shall request of the war
department upon your graduation

124
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,352
next week that all of you
be assigned

125
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,272
to the most dangerous branch
of the United States Army.

126
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,400
The second United States
Cavalry.

127
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,193
Now stationed at
Fort Leavenworth

128
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,945
in the Kansas territory.

129
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,579
That's all, gentlemen,
you are dismissed.

130
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,215
Now send for Cadet Rader.

131
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,508
How can you read that?

132
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,260
Fort Leavenworth,
suicide station.

133
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,554
Kansas in the Santa Fe Trail,
what a piece of luck!

134
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,764
That's it, and the cavalry,
active duty, promotion.

135
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,974
Why, we'll all be generals,
while the rest

136
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,267
are still chafing..

137
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,643
Oh, that's death of the country,
Jeb.

138
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,437
Nothing grows in Kansas
but trouble.

139
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,147
What are you talking about?
I grew up out there, didn't I?

140
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,857
Well, I suppose he's not.

141
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,275
Yeah, wait till
I get you boys out there

142
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,694
man alive, that's
my stamping grounds.

143
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,368
These pamphlets were found
in your quarters.

144
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,620
Dozens of them,
together with a letter

145
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,622
written by a member
of the abolitionists party

146
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,791
instructing you to distribute
them among those cadets

147
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,919
who appear to be
sympathetic to their cause.

148
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,297
How long has this undercover
activity of yours been going on?

149
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,715
Long enough.

150
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,508
Very clear idea
of your fellow conspirators

151
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,635
to plant an agent in our midst.

152
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,638
Your dishonorable discharge
will be drawn up at once.

153
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,058
And you will be given until
sundown to remove yourself

154
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,436
and your personal belongings
from the limits of Westpoint.

155
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,729
Good.

156
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,779
And you can tell
Mr. Stuart for me

157
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,323
that he'd be smart
to stay in the army.

158
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,950
Right in the middle
of it from now on.

159
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,998
Cadet William Cue, Ohio.

160
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,961
Cadet Martin Evans, Ohio.

161
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,508
Cadet Arma Mallow, New Jersey.

162
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,637
Cadet George Custer, Ohio.

163
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,600
Cadet James Longstreet,
South Carolina.

164
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,021
Cadet Philip Sheridan,
New York.

165
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,318
Cadet J-E-B Stuart,
Virginia.

166
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,032
Cadet John Hood,
Kentucky.

167
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,995
Cadet Robert Holliday,
Kansas Territory.

168
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,248
Yippee!

169
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,463
Cadet Jason Wood,
Virginia.

170
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,802
Cadet George Pickett,
Virginia.

171
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,804
That's my sister Kit.

172
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,348
Thought two years in Boston
would make a lady out of you.

173
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,767
So did I,
it just popped out.

174
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,228
Cadet William Keel, Ohio.

175
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,732
Cadet Robert Davis,
New Jersey.

176
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,197
It is now my great honor
and privilege to introduce

177
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:00,577
the secretary of war
of the United States of America.

178
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,787
The Honorable Jefferson Davis.

179
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,462
Officers and gentlemen
of the class of 1854

180
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,842
their welcomed guests
and their very proud families,

181
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,969
I'll not keep you separated
very long

182
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,597
as I myself once
sat in your place

183
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,599
and endure an interminable
address

184
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,018
by a very tiresome general.

185
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,481
But as a secretary of war
of this nation

186
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,318
I have a serious obligation
towards each new officer

187
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,697
of the army before he enters
into active service.

188
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,283
And that obligation
is to make clear and definite

189
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,494
his responsibility
to his government.

190
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,789
We are a new nation among
the powers of the world.

191
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,291
Just 80 years ago

192
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,127
we were fighting desperately
for our freedom.

193
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,504
And we are still fighting
to keep it.

194
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,717
We are not yet a wealthy nation,
except in spirit.

195
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,470
And that unity of spirit
is our greatest strength.

196
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,639
You men now have but one duty.

197
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,767
One alone. America.

198
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,354
With your unswerving loyalty
and the grace of God

199
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,649
our nation shall have no fears
for the future.

200
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,735
And your lives will have been
spent in the noblest

201
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,781
of all causes, the defense
of the rights of man.

202
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,528
Tickets!

203
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,164
Tickets. Tickets.

204
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,416
Mr. Holliday, we're getting
close to Leavenworth.

205
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,335
Yeah, it's a shame
this tea kettle of yours

206
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,711
doesn't go any further.

207
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,255
What for?
There's nothing to go to.

208
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,174
There's half a nation out there,
cap.

209
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,384
Someday I'll build
a real railroad to open it up.

210
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,802
Clear the Santa Fe.

211
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,804
For a man who made
a fortune out of horses

212
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,141
you sure got a heap to learn.

213
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,018
Hey, cap, tell the boys to
speed it up, will you?

214
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,437
The last time I had get out and
help chop wood for the engine.

215
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,813
Well, the first time
you rode with me

216
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,065
I had to change your diapers.

217
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,528
Hey, cap, where am I going?

218
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,447
Looks like you are going
to Hades.

219
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,991
Just wanted to know.

220
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,327
Bob's been telling us about
that railroad Santa Fe so long.

221
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,912
Now, Mr. Holiday,
I'm surprised to learn

222
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,080
it hasn't even been built.

223
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,956
Well, let's not all foster it.

224
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,417
You can't build a railroad over
blood-soaked ground like Kansas.

225
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,044
Decent sellers won't use it.

226
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,546
We are losing thousands of
pioneer to Oregon Trail.

227
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,048
They circle right around us.

228
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,342
We heard about the raided
arsenal last week.

229
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,427
What is the true situation
out here, sir?

230
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,555
Well, Kansas is a territory
and not a state.

231
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,891
We are ready to join the Union,
but the big question is

232
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,519
whether we'll go in as a
slave state or as a free state.

233
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,854
On one side is most of
Kansas' pro-slavers

234
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,314
people who came from south.

235
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,774
On the other side are
the abolitionists

236
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,734
lead by John Brown
and the sons.

237
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,486
Between those two elements
they've made Kansas

238
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,655
a boiling pot of
rebellion and massacres.

239
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,031
That's why the army sent
you boys out here

240
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,491
to Fort Leavenworth.

241
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,370
Suicide station,
it's quite an honor.

242
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,540
- Excuse me, will you, sir?
- Surely.

243
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,834
You know, the first time
I saw you at the graduation

244
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,294
I thought of what Napoleon said
when he first met Josephine.

245
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,088
What was that?

246
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,465
He said, "I never knew this
savage land they call America

247
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,301
could breath such
perfect beauty in mortal form."

248
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,345
Oh. Thank you.

249
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,597
- That's a lovely line.
- Yeah, isn't it?

250
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,225
George has been using it
for years, haven't you, George?

251
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,562
I... I wish I could think of
nice things like that to say.

252
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,439
You wouldn't like
what I'm thinking now.

253
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,899
You were going to tell me
something more about Kansas.

254
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,486
Yes, what do you do on
Saturday nights for fun here?

255
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,323
Well, as I remember,
half of Leavenworth takes a bath

256
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,075
another the half gets drunk.

257
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,785
And since there are
only two bathtubs in town

258
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,662
they seem a kind of exciting
around midnight.

259
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,874
Kit! Kit! Kit.

260
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,210
By the way, how they ever came
to name you Kit Carson Holliday?

261
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,754
Well, Mr. Carson and my dad
were very good friends.

262
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,548
And they were so sure
I was going to be a boy

263
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,425
they named me
before I was born.

264
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,220
Oh, I see. Well, I'm certainly
glad they were wrong.

265
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,764
- Me too.
- Me too.

266
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,350
Me too!

267
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,977
- Hey, conductor.
- Yeah?

268
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,395
What're you going to do
about that?

269
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,149
- About what?
- I'll tend to that.

270
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,984
Hey, I thought I told you

271
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,111
them Negroes had to
ride in the last coach.

272
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,905
Their tickets gives them
the right to ride

273
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,531
wherever they please.

274
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,533
Now, I don't want any trouble
with you, mister.

275
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,452
Then you better leave us alone.

276
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,872
Well, I don't know what
this country is coming to.

277
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,208
- Tickets!
- Stop shaking, Anna.

278
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,667
There's nothing to worry about.

279
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,170
We're only half an hour
from the border.

280
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,756
If we don't hurry,
they will be across the border.

281
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,382
Alright, go ahead.

282
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,854
Where you taking the Negroes?

283
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,814
What business is that of yours?

284
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:07,109
We are asking the questions.
Are they free or bond?

285
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:11,197
Here are the papers.
You can see it for yourself.

286
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,825
Yeah, that might mean something
if we didn't know who you are.

287
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,203
Now don't you make a move.

288
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,829
We're taking
you and them off of this train

289
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,706
while they're
still in Missouri.

290
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,708
Now, come on,
get up all of you.

291
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,102
Where're they gonna take us,
Master Brown?

292
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,396
What they gonna do with us?

293
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,108
Stop him.

294
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,577
What do you know about this?

295
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,413
There is the trouble,
Negro slaves.

296
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,999
He was trying to sneak 'em
across the state line.

297
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,750
I'll get that murdering
jayhawker for this

298
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,128
if I'll have to hang for it.

299
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,046
- Who was it?
- Oliver Brown.

300
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,756
One of John Brown's
scurvy litter.

301
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,301
Better than a doornail.
Come on, you'll get by greenhorn

302
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,137
give me a hand. There ain't
no use spoiling the carpet.

303
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,555
Come on,
get him out of the way.

304
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,307
Now, don't get excited,
everybody.

305
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,434
Sit down, please.

306
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,520
This is what they mean
when call it bloody Kansas.

307
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,564
There'll never be any peace
along the Santa Fe Trail

308
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,233
while John Brown or any of his
followers are alive.

309
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,262
Now this is the present terminal.

310
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,556
I proposed to come down here
to Wichita.

311
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,975
And along here across
the Arkansas River

312
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,686
along the Cimarron River,
over here to Las Vegas.

313
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,355
Here on into Santa Fe.

314
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,981
Now that'll be
our first section of track.

315
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,442
From Leavenworth to Wichita.
Right over the trail.

316
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,069
How soon do you figure to start?

317
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,487
Well, the men back east say
they are ready

318
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,113
to put up the money as soon
as we can prove

319
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,532
that a rail route through Kansas
are safe and will pay.

320
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,743
- Dad!
- Yes, Kit.

321
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,161
Where did you put
the loading list?

322
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,122
List? Gosh, I clearly forgot
to make one out.

323
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,499
That's great!

324
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,833
Ninety eight tons
of freight ready to roll

325
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,418
and no orders for loading,

326
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,295
how'd you run this business
while I was away?

327
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,881
That's why I sent you away to
show you what a skirt was.

328
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,384
Look at your clothes,
look at the grease your nose.

329
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,636
What would your friends
in Boston think of you now?

330
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,388
Frankly, dad,
I don't much care.

331
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,181
If you are going to keep your
nose in the paper railway

332
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,392
I better keep mine
in the family affairs.

333
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,519
Tex!

334
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,479
Windy!

335
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,272
Tex!

336
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,774
Where are those ornery cousins?

337
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,984
What do they think they're
getting paid for?

338
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,277
Tex!

339
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,532
Why didn't you tell me?

340
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,242
Getting jealous, huh?

341
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,828
I didn't even see Lilly
when I said goodbye to her.

342
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,831
Oh, now don't start lying to me,
you double crossing buzzard.

343
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,457
I know that you didn't buy
that there looking glass to see

344
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,792
your own ugly mug.

345
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,127
I suppose
you're figuring on wearing

346
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,837
that female cinching belt.

347
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,797
Wait till Lilly sees
what you brung her.

348
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,132
She'll brain you.

349
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,300
If it ain't physically
impossible.

350
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,636
- Why you ignorant...
Tex.

351
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,638
Hey, you two.
Where in the name...

352
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,098
Will you come here?

353
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,144
- Hello, Ms. Kit.
- Hello nothing.

354
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,812
Are you gentlemen of leisure
by any chance

355
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,605
interested in employment?

356
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,566
Oh, we lost our watch.

357
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,484
Yeah, we didn't have
no idea of time.

358
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,278
I ought to give you both your
time and throw you out.

359
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,821
Where in thunder have you been?

360
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,032
Well, you see,
we had to buy these nick-nacks.

361
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,369
Well, we sort of got a gal
in Santa Fe, Lilly, uh...

362
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,371
Hofstadter.
And what do you mean we?

363
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,540
- I'm engaged to her.
- Well, who ain't?

364
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,002
You set up housekeeping
at Santa Fe

365
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,087
or is this just
gilding the lily?

366
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,757
Oh, she want us to fetch her
one of them

367
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,050
fancy French
looking glasses.

368
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,552
Ain't it pretty?

369
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,512
What's your answer to that, Tex?

370
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,145
What are you all laughing at,
you long eared jackasses?

371
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,191
Go on, get to work,
both of you.

372
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,485
Go on, jump to it.

373
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,696
You better hide that thing
or start wearing it.

374
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,299
I'm going to put you
new officers

375
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,675
straight from the start.

376
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,470
This is Fort Leavenworth
and not Westpoint.

377
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,431
You were sent here
to man the frontier garrison.

378
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,392
Three of the officers
you're supposed to be replacing

379
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,896
are buried back of the hill
in the little military cemetery.

380
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,232
The other four
haven't been found yet.

381
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,151
The regiment of mounted rifles
has only one job

382
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,195
to keep the peace in Kansas.

383
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,696
And we're here alone.

384
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,407
There's no other fort
between us and Santa Fe.

385
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,660
And we're proud
of that responsibility.

386
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,829
We've got a tough reputation
in the army

387
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,747
but they respect us in the west.

388
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,458
See that it stays that way.

389
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:18,045
Order of the day, Lieutenants
Longstreet and Holliday

390
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,297
take B troop and put
them through close order drill.

391
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,758
Lieutenants Stuart and Custer
will take eight men

392
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,510
as an escort
for the freight caravan

393
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,554
leaving at noon
for New Mexico.

394
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,598
Draw the usual supplies and
report to me for final orders.

395
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,105
Say, will you keep all those

396
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,815
cases of Bibles
near the tail board.

397
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,191
They're only going a short haul.

398
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,819
We sure will.

399
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,195
Let's go.

400
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,495
Convoy ready, sir,
we're ready if you are.

401
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,289
Good, I hope you have
a nice, quiet trip.

402
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,082
On any other kind,
I lose money.

403
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,876
Oh, we will try
and save you that.

404
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,128
We'll see you in six weeks, sir,
with luck.

405
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,505
Just keep your eyes open, boys,
and move fast.

406
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,924
You'll like the scenery
but don't trust it.

407
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,175
Alright. Goodbye, sir.

408
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,802
Goodbye, Stuart.
Goodbye, Custer.

409
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,312
Corporal, detail two men
to cover each wagon.

410
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,314
Yes, sir.

411
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,983
Phil, move all these barrels
over there for the next ride.

412
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,537
- Well.
- Hey.

413
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,997
Looks like we both
got the same idea.

414
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,166
Looks that way.
How're we gonna work it?

415
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,377
Here.

416
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,754
I've got an idea.

417
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,590
- Let's draw for it.
- Fair enough.

418
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,966
Right.

419
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,264
- I got the long one.
- Hey, wait a minute.

420
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,141
Where I come from
long man loses.

421
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,394
Tough luck, old man.
Here, hold my horse.

422
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,565
One hand plough, one seater,
seven eggs, 15, 12 and 14 and...

423
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,692
Why, Joe,
there is something missing.

424
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,069
Must be me. Hello.

425
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,695
Hello.
What are you doing here?

426
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,238
Oh, playing nursemaid
for those wagons.

427
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,490
Should be the other way around.

428
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,533
Oh, the convoy.
That's a silly idea.

429
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,203
Dad, he thinks that man
John Brown is behind every bush.

430
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,621
Well, it's not that
I mind so much

431
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,956
it's being away from
you for six weeks

432
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,707
just when
we're getting started.

433
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,417
Started? When?

434
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,460
Now, look, I've only got
a few minutes left.

435
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,128
So I've got to be fast.

436
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,838
You haven't been exactly slow
for a couple of days.

437
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,173
I've never seen
such a pair of whirlwinds

438
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,841
as you and George Custer.

439
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,969
George, poor old George.
Well, never mind about him.

440
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,930
Look, Kit, I might as well
tell you before I go.

441
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,848
I'm completely
crazy about you.

442
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:35,891
- What?
- No, wait a minute.

443
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,184
Let me finish.

444
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,477
I needn't warn you
about army life.

445
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,104
The pay is bad,
I'd never be home.

446
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,106
You'd probably be a widow
in two weeks.

447
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,441
I see, have you thought
of any particular names

448
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,526
for the children?

449
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,194
No, be serious, will you?

450
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,154
This might be the most
precious moment in our lives.

451
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,906
I hope not,
not in these clothes.

452
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,409
Haven't you got
any heart at all?

453
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,079
Yes, I have, and it's going to
stay right where it is.

454
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,872
I don't know
a thing about you, Jeb Stuart.

455
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,125
My brother thinks
you're wonderful.

456
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,293
But then he was dropped
on his head when he was a baby.

457
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,007
Well, at least you'll let me
kiss you goodbye, won't you?

458
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,052
Oh, well, it's quite an honor,
but no, thanks.

459
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,054
I... I don't really deserve it.

460
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,099
Well, hello.
Say, this is quite a surprise.

461
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,892
The corporal's looking for you,
says it's very urgent.

462
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,477
Mm-hmm, I'll bet.

463
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,563
Kit, we will take this up later
right where we left off.

464
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,356
Now, George,
don't be long winded.

465
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,233
Listen, Kit, we're due to
leave in a minute now.

466
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,110
There's something
I've got to tell you.

467
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,945
I'm head over heels in love
with you.

468
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,489
George, you sound just
like an echo.

469
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,700
Oh, Kit. Ah, pardon the
interruption, George old man.

470
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,035
Kit, there is something
I forgot to ask you.

471
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,828
Have I got any real competition?

472
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,663
How do you think any girl would
answer a question like this?

473
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,082
- Well, just tell me the truth.
- Then you'd both be crazy.

474
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,168
Get going, you bull whackers!

475
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,086

be choking.

not to enter Kansas unequipped.

Nor to display their weapons
to public view.

514
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,315
Let that be understood
beforehand.

515
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,151
- Warn them also...
- Not so fast, father.

516
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,069
Warn them also
that our plans must be known

517
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,238
to ourselves alone.

518
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,949
That they join me in the clear
knowledge that all traitors

519
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,160
of the cause must die

520
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,663
wherever caught
and proven to be guilty.

521
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,123
Tell them that we stand by
one another

522
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,708
while a drop of blood remains.

523
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,794
That under no threats or
pressure do we make confessions.

524
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,052
Alright, that's our camp.

525
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,804
I might as well tell you
when you get this far

526
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,222
you don't turn back.

527
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,807
You don't have to
worry about us.

528
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,642
We ain't the kind that quit.

529
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,811
That's fine.
Just see you keep it that way.

530
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,397
Save all of us
a lot of unpleasantness.

531
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,699
You've been delayed.
Was there trouble, Rader?

532
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,035
No, sir, we had to detour
when we got to the border.

533
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,245
I picked these new men
up in Palmyra.

534
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,165
Volunteers, sir.
Here are their credentials.

535
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,667
From Illinois.
You've come a long way.

536
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,712
And we'll go the rest of it.
We came here to fight slavers.

537
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,423
- The sooner the better.
- That's good.

538
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,675
We'll put you to work at once.

539
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,594
Kitzmiller,
look after these gentlemen.

540
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,262
Fine.
This way, boys.

541
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,267
We've received the news
we've been waiting for.

542
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,895
- We break camp, Rader.
- Yes, sir!

543
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,647
Let's start tearing down
these tents now.

544
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,489
Oliver! He's hurt.

545
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,866
- I'm alright. Where's father?
- Father!

546
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,788
What has happened to you?

547
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,414
Where are the Negroes
you were told to bring?

548
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,792
A couple of pro-slavers tried
to grab us on the train.

549
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,502
I shot one of 'em
and jumped off.

550
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,171
You left four helpless people
alone to save yourself?

551
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,215
I had to do it, father.
It was me or them.

552
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,883
You cowardly fool!

553
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:25,222
In future
obey my instructions.

554
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,807
We leave at once.

555
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,149
All of you,
down upon your knees.

556
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,571
As once you sent the ravens
to save Elijah

557
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,865
so how you have delivered
into my hands

558
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:47,619
the precious means
of continuing Thy holy work.

559
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,414
The Lord
our God is a great God

560
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,958
a mighty and a terrible
who regardth not persons

561
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,502
nor taketh reward.

562
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,796
The Lord is a man of war.

563
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,633
Thy right hand shall become
glorious through power.

564
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:05,220
Thy right hand, oh, God shall
dash in pieces the enemy.

565
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,147
Hey, Oscar.

566
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,149
When we cross the river
you watch out for that wagon.

567
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,026
It's got my looking glass.

568
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,527
Hey, Tex.
These horses are pretty tired.

569
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,820
When are we going to make camp?

570
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,405
Oh, as soon as
we cross the river

571
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,240
and then we'll be out of danger
from both sides.

572
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,491
You know, lieutenant,
I'm sure glad

573
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,160
we're leaving civilization.

574
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,787
It's getting too dangerous
for a peace-loving man.

575
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,998
I run into some of
them abolitionists this once.

576
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,792
But who's this fella John Brown
they talk so much about?

577
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,170
Oh, as far as I know
he's just a dirty old windbag.

578
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:42,007
- In fact, he's just your type.
- Either of you ever meet him?

579
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,134
No, but two of them fellas
he killed at Osawatomie

580
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,510
were friends of mine.

581
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,220
You mean Jim Doyle
and Allan Wilkerson?

582
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,889
Yeah, and that's the reason
I'd sure like to meet up

583
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,724
with this here Mr. John Brown.

584
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,060
He's got no quarrel
with people like you, Tex.

585
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,312
You would do much better
to leave him alone.

586
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,272
Well, you can
count me in anyhow.

587
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,399
Even if he ain't harm
no friends of mine

588
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,610
I sure would hate to miss
a good fight.

589
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,542
This is wrong, father.

590
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,878
We've never attacked
a wagon train before.

591
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,880
We aren't common highwaymen.

592
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,548
You say we have
a righteous cause

593
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,842
but this will bring the law
down on us like a storm.

594
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,762
We recognize no law
but the law of God.

595
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,430
You will do as I command.

596
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,484
Take your men back, Rader.
Wait for my signal.

597
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,431
Howdy, strangers.

598
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,266
Good morning.
Are these Holliday's wagons?

599
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,268
- That's right, sir.
- My name is Smith.

600
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,978
Jonathan Smith of Newton.

601
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,980
Ah, well,
what can we do for you?

602
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,649
I believe you're carrying
some freight consigned to me.

603
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,693
Oh, we might be, if you got
something to show for it.

604
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,821
I have this receipt
from the shipper.

605
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,073
Come a long way with an empty
wagon, haven't you, Mr. Smith?

606
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,992
Newton's about
a 100 miles from here.

607
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,327
My home is in Newton, sir,
but my place of business

608
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,246
is much closer to the trail.

609
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,831
Oh, I see.

610
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,666
I thought your horses
look pretty fresh.

611
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,085
Eight cases of Bibles.
That's right.

612
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,838
Come on, Windy, we will unpack
these Bibles for the parson.

613
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,048
Jason, bring up your wagon.

614
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:53,847
Get that cart down.

615
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,973
I got to get them Bibles
unpacked

616
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,018
for the parson.

617
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,854
That's a funny thing.
I've seen that fella somewhere.

618
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,981
It's the way it seems to me.

619
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,608
It isn't the kind of a face
you'd forget in a hurry.

620
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,110
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

621
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,821
I know. In some magazine,
"The Atlantic" I think.

622
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,365
Well, and he's either from
Boston or he's a missionary.

623
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,869
No, it was something else.

624
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,709
Been a lot of bad trouble

625
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,253
over across the river lately,
Mr. Smith.

626
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,756
That murdering skunk John Brown
is on the loose again.

627
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,299
Better keep your eye
peeled for him.

628
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,009
Thank you. We shall.

629
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,722
This stuff sure is heavy
for Bibles.

630
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,350
How would you know?
You ain't never even saw one.

631
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,684
Ah..

632
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,245
Just a minute.

633
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,416
I'd like to see
those Bibles.

634
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,793
Stay where you are.

635
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,836
Put your hands up
and keep 'em up.

636
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,083
I advise you to make
no move towards your gun.

637
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,710
Bring up the other wagon.

638
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,670
Now then, quickly
with those other crates.

639
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:55,218
Alright, get a move on there.
Only the ones marked Bibles.

640
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,804
Hey, Jeb. Look.

641
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,347
Our friend Rader.

642
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,812
Well, this is a surprise.

643
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,981
The commission
and the cavalry too, huh?

644
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,610
I see you've got the commission
you were after.

645
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,153
You know these men, Rader?

646
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,904
Yes, sir. Very well.

647
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,406
This one, Stuart,
comes from a rich

648
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,742
slave owning family
in Virginia.

649
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:23,038
He called you a lying renegade
once and I jumped him for it.

650
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,581
John Brown. Him?

651
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,082
- John Brown!
- John Brown?

652
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,834
I've nothing personal
against you men

653
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,128
but I will deal harshly
with any interference.

654
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,466
I might have known that you'd
wind up with this outfit.

655
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,051
Well, that's one of the troubles
with the army, Stuart,

656
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,927
they don't teach you
to think ahead.

657
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,387
They do one smart thing.

658
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,889
They teach never to turn
your back on an enemy

659
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,599
without first making sure
he's harm...

660
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,686
Stop this.

661
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,021
We've not saddled ourselves
with the killing

662
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,357
just to satisfy
your personal quarrels.

663
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,983
One more murder
won't mark you any deeper

664
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,193
than you are now, Mr. Brown.

665
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,737
I intend to be a marked man.

666
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,031
Back to your horse, Rader.

667
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,658
Back to your horses,
all of you.

668
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,409
I've given you fair warning.

669
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,871
You can keep your heads
or lose them as you wish.

670
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,206
Move on.

671
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,719
I saw what was
in those cases, George.

672
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,012
- What?
- Contraband.

673
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,181
- Riffles and ammunition.
- Gosh!

674
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,767
Then we've been delivering
Bibles with triggers on 'em.

675
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,268
Let's take a chance.

676
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,562
Everybody take cover
and open fire.

677
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,523
Dismount! Take cover!

678
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,537
Stop! Cover the wagons
and move back.

679
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,996
We mustn't lose anymore men.

680
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,543
Get back.

681
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,962
He's running.
They're getting away.

682
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,672
No, they are not.
We're going after them.

683
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,716
Hey, wait a minute.
They outnumber us three to one.

684
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,135
Well, if it makes you nervous,
don't count them. Come on.

685
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,305
Everybody, mount and follow me.

686
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,974
Everybody, mount!

687
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,355
Come on. I tell you,
here's where I get your medal.

688
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,606
Forward!

689
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,030
Get those wagons out of here!

690
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,491
Come on! Quickly!

691
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,629
Use your whip, Jason!
Use your whip!

692
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,470
I couldn't help it.
I didn't do anything.

693
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,514
Alright, son,
nobody's going to hurt you.

694
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,141
- Who are you?
- Jason Brown.

695
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,810
Brown? You're one of
John Brown's sons.

696
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,229
Yeah.
Yes, but I never did anything.

697
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,897
He made me go along.

698
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,358
I never killed anyone.
I swear it.

699
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,194
I'm getting out.
I'm quitting.

700
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,779
You've got to take me with you.

701
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,073
Alright.
Bring a horse up, George.

702
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,367
- Bring up the horses.
- We'll have to carry him back.

703
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,788
The boy is badly hurt.

704
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,958
It's his father's madness
really striking home now.

705
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,419
Jeb, there's a purpose
behind that madness.

706
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,754
One that can't easily
be dismissed.

707
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:47,260
George, you've seen the needle
on a compass, haven't you?

708
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,970
It's got a whole car
to swing around in

709
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,347
but it always wobbles
back to the North.

710
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,266
What are you driving at?

711
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,810
Just this. I've always known
where your sympathies lay,

712
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,730
but it never affected our
friendship and it never will.

713
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,815
But it isn't our job
to decide who's right

714
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,067
and who's wrong about slavery

715
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,861
anymore than it is John Brown's.

716
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,365
I guess you're right, Jeb.

717
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,575
I'm sorry.

718
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,828
That's the most doggone fun
I've had

719
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,788
since we got hemmed up
with them Injuns.

720
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,498
Yeah, well, the next time
we shooting at a commoner

721
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,958
you let me do the shooting.

722
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,336
Boy, my gullet is dry as
a powder horn.

723
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,634
Get up.

724
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,056
You busted Lilly's
looking glass.

725
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,432
When she looks
at herself in that

726
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,601
she'll think
she's a hundred years old.

727
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,936
Or more.

728
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,980
Of course, we're aware that

729
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,607
firearms are contraband
in Kansas.

730
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,567
Do you think we'd have
accepted those boxes as freight

731
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,235
if we'd known
what they actually contained?

732
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,321
Well, I'm just asking,
that's all.

733
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,199
Doesn't it seem strange to you
that Dr. J. Boyce Russell,

734
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,034
the most prominent
religious leader in America

735
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,579
should be sending rifles
marked as Bibles to John Brown?

736
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,790
How can I control
the marking of crates?

737
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,542
We once received three tons
of gunpowder marked bird seed.

738
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,795
Well, then you'll have to
examine every crate you haul.

739
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,879
What?

740
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,339
For all we know this contraband

741
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,216
may have been slipping
through for months.

742
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,052
Jason. Listen, son.

743
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,347
You've got nothing to be afraid
of if you'll be honest with us.

744
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,933
Now, I want you to answer
my question truthfully.

745
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,977
Did your father ever mentioned
this shipment of rifles

746
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,478
when he discussed his plans?

747
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,689
Not to me.

748
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,274
He never confided in me.

749
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,568
Just Fred and Oliver.

750
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,863
- Fred and Oliver?
- My brothers.

751
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:34,325
- Where are their headquarters?
- I don't know where they went.

752
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,954
They have a dozen places, I...

753
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,790
I don't know.
I don't know.

754
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,669
Alright, kid.

755
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,212
Don't worry about it.

756
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,057
These guns are no mistake.

757
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,559
Anyone with their best
interest of Kansas

758
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,185
at heart can tell you that.

759
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,603
No bendy-legged
bushwhacking soldier

760
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,480
can talk like that
about the Holidays.

761
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:05,857
We've got as much
interest in Kansas

762
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,066
as the United States government.

763
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,609
And a darn sight
more investment.

764
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,111
We were here before
the army came in

765
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,280
and by God we will be here
when you're gone.

766
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,282
If you think you can...

767
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,616
Sir.

768
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,410
Well, Stuart,
what did you find?

769
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,453
Very little, sir.

770
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,495
The boy is either too badly hurt

771
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,205
or too frightened to talk.

772
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,166
We leave immediately.
Have them sound to assembly.

773
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,250
Yes, sir.

774
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,172
What was that you called me?

775
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,299
A gold darn
bendy-legged bushwhacker.

776
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,759
Now, go on.

777
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,720
He says he talks
with God at night.

778
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:40,016
But God doesn't tell people to
kill one another, does He, miss?

779
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:48,149
He's a, he's a good man
in a lot of ways.

780
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,235
But he's changed
since Osawatomie.

781
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,572
Those people he killed...

782
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,616
They got down on their knees

783
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,410
and begged him for their lives.

784
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:02,163
But he struck them with a sword.

785
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,249
Him and Rader and Kitzmiller.

786
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,210
I was there.

787
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,920
I saw it done.

788
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,632
I tried to stop them
but they pushed me aside.

789
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,259
Yes, that's how it was.

790
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,803
We're starting at once.

791
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,805
I'll take the first troop
west to Tecumseh.

792
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,974
Stuart, you and Custer will take
the first platoon of B troop

793
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,518
and search thoroughly
from Clinton

794
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,311
to Dutch Henry's crossing.
Is that clear?

795
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,480
- Yes, sir.
- These are your orders.

796
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,066
Find John Brown
and bring him back here.

797
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,692
Alive if possible.

798
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,362
His force is well-armed now
and strong in numbers.

799
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,114
We also suspect
that new volunteers

800
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,241
are drifting in from the East
to join him.

801
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,659
Be on the lookout
for them as well.

802
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,537
Retire to your
respective troops.

803
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,292
What's that?

804
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,794
They've caught
some more of us.

805
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,880
No one's been caught, Jason.
Not even you.

806
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,091
You've committed no crime
to be afraid of.

807
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,218
I'm sick of being afraid.

808
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,762
I'm sick of hiding
like a hunted thing.

809
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,430
I want to walk free
like other people.

810
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,765
You will, Jason.

811
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,226
- You are safe now.
- No, I'm not.

812
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,188
Not as long as he keeps killing
and thinking that he's right.

813
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,440
He can't be right,
can he, miss?

814
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,860
I don't know.

815
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,612
His reasons may be right, Jason.

816
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,782
They may even be great
and good reasons.

817
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:23,995
But what your father is doing
is wrong, terribly wrong.

818
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:28,457
And he will keep on repeating
that wrong as long as he lives.

819
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:32,753
Then, then I'll never
be free of him

820
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:36,924
until one of us is dead.
I know that now.

821
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,802
My life don't mean anything.

822
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,138
But if he dies

823
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,599
maybe this whole scheme of his
will die with him.

824
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,185
I'd rather have it that way.

825
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,604
His life...

826
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,689
Even if he is my father

827
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,274
against many thousands.

828
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,153
I'm going to tell you
where to find him.

829
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,279
Well, Jason,
I'm not trying to...

830
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,655
I'm going to tell you anyway.

831
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,116
In the house
of Shubel Morgan, Palmyra.

832
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,618
That's where they went.

833
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,537
That's their headquarters.
Tell the soldiers!

834
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,291
It's better that way.

835
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,836
His life against many thousands.

836
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,810
Jeb.

837
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,062
Hello, darling. How is he?

838
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,146
It's very serious.

839
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,814
I left the doctor with him.

840
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,150
- Poor little devil.
- Jeb, he told me everything.

841
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,027
The whole nightmare
of his 15 years

842
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,737
even the place
where his father is now.

843
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,781
He said he wanted me
to tell the soldiers.

844
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,282
- Where?
- Palmyra.

845
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,368
At the house of
a man named Shubel Morgan.

846
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,745
Shubel Morgan, Palmyra.

847
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:53,000
- I wonder if that's the truth.
- Jeb. I'm frightened.

848
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,503
That boy is crippled for life.

849
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,423
And that man on the train,
he died for principle.

850
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:02,009
And a man killed him
for a principle.

851
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,929
One of them is wrong.
But which one?

852
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,639
Who knows the answer
to that, Kit.

853
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,683
Everybody in America
is trying to decide it.

854
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,644
Yes, by words in the East
and by guns in the West.

855
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,480
But one day the words
will turn into guns.

856
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,816
Oh, Jeb, can't it be
stopped now?

857
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,151
Can't the slaves be free
before it's too late?

858
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,280
It will be stopped
when we hang John Brown.

859
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,115
Then the South can settle
our own problem

860
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,700
without loss of pride
at being forced into it

861
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,368
by a bunch of fanatics.

862
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,288
Oh, Jeb, what has pride
got to do with human lives?

863
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:34,834
Kit, the two things kind of
come together down South.

864
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,128
We can't pry them apart.
Not even with guns.

865
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,716
I hope that's going to be
the same way with us.

866
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,515
Uh-oh, that's me all over.
Clumsy Cluster.

867
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,641
Or can I get into this too?

868
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,143
- Yes.
- Sure, sure.

869
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,395
It's like you're not.
Don't miss much, do you?

870
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,023
Ah, I've seen your work before,
son. That's where I learned.

871
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,025
That's credit one more
to my account, Kit.

872
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,444
I would like to let
the interest accumulate.

873
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,779
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye, George.

874
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,450
Hear that?

875
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,118
- Don't be long, Jeb.
- Oh, no, no, no.

876
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,495
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

877
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,457
Kit, remember this, will you?
I love you.

878
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,875
Put that in your little bonnet
and keep it there

879
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,168
until I come back.

880
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,961
- I'll remember.
- Goodbye.

881
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,885
Hey, lieutenant.

882
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,803
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Lieutenant Jeb.

883
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:28,971
Say, I want you to keep
an eye on Kit for me

884
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:30,598
while we're gone, will you?

885
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,641
No. We're going to hunting
John Brown with you.

886
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,851
- What?
- Yeah, we've come to join up.

887
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,519
Who do we see?

888
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,772
A couple of flat-footed rumpots
like you in the army?

889
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,398
Why, you would get lost.

890
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:40,900
Boys, you better go home
and sleep it off. So long.

891
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,010
Jeb. Jeb!

892
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,352
Jeb!

893
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,108
He's dead.

894
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,987
If you find John Brown,
tell him.

895
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,075
We'll try to find him.
Goodbye.

896
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:51,429
Kit, once when you were
about this high

897
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:55,015
Tex and Windy brought home
a wolf cub with a broken back.

898
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,559
You nursed it for weeks

899
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,395
but it finally died
with his head in your lap.

900
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,313
You cried for days.

901
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,232
But it was just a wolf cub.

902
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,819
It would probably have grown up
to be a killer like its father.

903
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,376
What does being flat-footed
got to do with riding a horse?

904
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,837
Calling me a rumpot
is what hurt me.

905
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,464
I ain't had a drink
since noon.

906
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,697
Alright, get the sledge.

907
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,588
It sure is expensive salt pork,
Mr. Morgan sir.

908
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,089
Not the way we get 'em.

909
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,216
Round 'em over
and stack 'em in the barn.

910
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,509
Yes, sir.

911
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,551
This looks like
the best shipment

912
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,345
we've had yet.

913
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,055
Wonder what Rader's
worked up about?

914
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,723
Him and the old man
been arguing for an hour.

915
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,768
Looks like another job for us
if Rader thought of it.

916
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,312
West born education
is a wonderful thing.

917
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,647
Yeah, if you can collect on it.

918
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,148
Yeah.

919
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,943
I signed up because
you promised to pay me.

920
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,778
Train this rabble gang of yours

921
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,031
into a solid fast moving
unit of fighters.

922
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,575
Taught 'em how to use these new
rifles, how to follow orders

923
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,078
and take a town
in army fashion.

924
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,747
But I haven't received
a red cent in three months.

925
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,124
Now, what about it?

926
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,669
Mr. Rader, I enlisted you
on the recommendation

927
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,880
of friends in the East, who said
you would work for the cause.

928
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:53,342
You've done the job well.
I've no complaint up to now.

929
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,262
But our plans are ahead
of any personal greed.

930
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,722
If you feel otherwise,
you are free to get out.

931
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,225
But you must decide
here and now.

932
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,227
I want only loyal men
around me.

933
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,569
You've no argument
with my loyalty.

934
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,945
I proved that in Osawatomie

935
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,114
and every other town
we've raided.

936
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,700
But you hired me as a
military expert at a set price

937
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,868
and I'm only asking
what's rightly due me.

938
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,496
And I say that
you'll receive it in time.

939
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,748
Only let me think in peace.

940
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,167
My son is a prisoner
in the hands of our enemies.

941
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,920
Even now he may have
a rope around his neck.

942
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:33,674
An innocent boy who never fired
a gun in anger in his life.

943
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,761
While I stand here
powerless to save him.

944
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,888
Alright, I'll wait.

945
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,640
Well, what's our next move?

946
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:51,483
The Bible has said, "An eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth."

947
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,820
Tomorrow at daybreak we will
destroy Delaware crossing.

948
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,047
Jeb!

949
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,716
Lieutenant Jeb!

950
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,134
Troop, halt.

951
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,015
Well, what the...

952
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,808
Well, the major sort of
turned us down too.

953
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,852
But here we are,
Lieutenant Jeb.

954
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,063
What do you mean trailing us
halfway across Kansas?

955
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,689
We don't want you to get lost.

956
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,483
You see, I know every wrinkle
of this here country

957
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,942
just like my own face.

958
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:35,444
Well, you're sure
that's just as dirty?

959
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,071
I've got a good mind
to get a couple of mules

960
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,406
and strap you on the back
and send you home.

961
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,159
A fine looking
pair of soldiers you make.

962
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,536
Well, we needed some of them
pants and a cap.

963
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,913
And then of course
there's some soldiers

964
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,707
just our size gets killed,
why...

965
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,126
Alright, get back
to the end of the column.

966
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,836
Go on before I get that mule.

967
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,088
We don't have to obey no orders.

968
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,423
Since we ain't in the army.

969
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,883
- But we will.
- Yeah.

970
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,807
Wait till Kit hear about this.
She'll skin 'em alive.

971
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,809
That's if they've got
any skin left.

972
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,613
Who did this?

973
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,365
John Brown.

974
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,660
How many men did he have
with him?

975
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,580
Around a hundred.
Maybe more.

976
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,042
- How long since he left?
- Three, four hours.

977
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,837
We lost count of time.

978
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,213
Oh, you're the man
that had the run in

979
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,883
with one of the Browns
on the train.

980
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,385
- Is this in revenge for that?
- Yes.

981
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,429
We're Free Staters here.

982
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,723
Brown always knew
we'd get him some day

983
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,726
if he didn't get us first.

984
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,729
Well, I'll leave you some men
to help you bury your dead.

985
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,897
Let's see you back
to Leavenworth.

986
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,440
We don't want any help.

987
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,983
This is our fight.

988
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:41,487
We don't want you
or nobody else to finish it.

989
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,198
I'm going to take care
of John Brown myself.

990
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,326
Get on your way, soldier.
We've got work to do.

991
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,162
I know how you men
must feel about this.

992
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,456
But my orders are to break up
all armed forces.

993
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,209
Yours, John Brown's,
or anyone else's.

994
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,211
I'm sorry, but if you organize
under arms

995
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,379
I won't be able to draw a line
between you.

996
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,215
That suits us.

997
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,091
If it's got to be.

998
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,738
What did you find out,
Kitzmiller?

999
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,574
A tube of cavalry from Fort
Leavenworth are headed this way.

1000
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,910
Ignorant fools!

1001
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,287
Shubel, we're moving camp.
Round up all your men.

1002
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,665
Get the wagons ready to roll.
Just food and ammunition.

1003
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,208
We're traveling light
and moving fast.

1004
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,044
What about the Negroes?
We can't take all of them.

1005
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,546
We're not taking any of 'em.

1006
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,654
My children,
the hour of deliverance

1007
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,990
I promised you has come.

1008
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:11,535
I'm leaving Kansas now
to continue God's holy work.

1009
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,374
"So Gideon took ten men
of his servants

1010
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,252
"and did as God
had said unto him.

1011
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,045
"And it was so
he did it by night

1012
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:25,382
"and when the men of the wicked
city arose early in the morning

1013
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,927
behold, the altar of Baal
was cast down."

1014
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,930
Please, Captain Brown.
What do that mean?

1015
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,683
- What you gonna do with us?
- It means that you are free.

1016
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,852
The first of many millions
to whom I shall

1017
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,854
give freedom from slavery.

1018
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,399
Does, does just saying so
make us free?

1019
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,611
How we gonna live?
Get food and shelter?

1020
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,988
There are many good people
in Kansas who will give you

1021
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,073
work and protection.

1022
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,701
From now on,
you must fend for yourselves

1023
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,703
as other free men do.

1024
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,623
My work here is done.

1025
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:01,460
- Praise the lord!
- Glory bliss! God, we's free.

1026
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,754
The captain done tip his word,
we's free!

1027
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,839
We's free! We's free!

1028
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,688
You know,
if John Brown is a 100 men

1029
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,358
we better send a runner back,
bring up the rest of the troop.

1030
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,735
Better do it tonight.

1031
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,320
I'm going into Palmyra,
George.

1032
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,864
You, alone?
Don't be crazy, Jeb.

1033
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,784
That town's full of jayhawkers,
they'd shoot you on sight.

1034
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,661
Well, I'll have to take
a chance on that.

1035
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,496
I'm gonna get some other
clothes, take a couple of men

1036
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,581
and go in
and do some scouting.

1037
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:40,749
I'll try to send you back word.

1038
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,586
Good luck.

1039
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,463
Say, do you two fellows
still want to join the army?

1040
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,006
- Huh?!
- I've got a job for you.

1041
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,633
It's no picnic,
it's pretty dangerous.

1042
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,135
But I think you're the fellows
for it. What do you say?

1043
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,471
Do you mean we're gonna have
a real cap and a uniform?

1044
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,847
Mm-hm.

1045
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:57,182
Well, we might have to be buried
in 'em.

1046
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,184
But it sure sounds like a deal.

1047
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,703
The law has got nothing
to do with it.

1048
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:20,080
We came here to join John Brown

1049
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,624
because he's a leader,
and a fighter!

1050
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:26,044
The whole thing's going to be
settled right here in Kansas.

1051
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:28,755
We came here to fight slavers,
didn't we?

1052
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:32,968
The only way to fight 'em
is with guns!

1053
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,387
Sure give a good lookin' over
in this here's man town.

1054
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,265
Yeah, I feel just like I was
takin' a bath in a bath tub

1055
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,641
without no sides on it.

1056
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:42,060
The only kind of a tub
you ever was in.

1057
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,812
Say, who could I talk to
in this kind of a town

1058
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,814
without arising suspicion?

1059
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,025
- The town barber.
- That's right.

1060
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,068
Anytime a barber can't talk
to a stranger

1061
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:52,029
he's liable to go crazy.

1062
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,489
The town barber. Hm.

1063
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:56,116
That's it.

1064
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,668
- Howdy, boys.
- Howdy.

1065
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:15,260
Pretty good looking horse
for this part of the world.

1066
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,636
Yeah.

1067
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,472
Kansas is alright
for men and dogs

1068
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,682
but it's pretty hard
on women and horses.

1069
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,853
Say, look at that brand.

1070
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,443
That's an army horse.

1071
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,698
Maybe just bought him
from someone.

1072
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:38,992
No, they don't sell 'em.

1073
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,036
Nobody rides that brand
but a soldier.

1074
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,915
You keep your eye on him
till I get back.

1075
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,838
You still got that creepy
feeling about this place?

1076
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,965
I don't know whether it's that
or here chiggers.

1077
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,134
But something's creeping
over me.

1078
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,136
Why don't you scratch
and see if it goes away.

1079
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:07,312
Yeah, I reckon
that is all it was.

1080
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,980
Say, I got it now.

1081
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,857
We was on the same train
a couple of months ago

1082
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,609
when that fellow got killed.

1083
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,778
Uh-huh. You probably got me
mixed up with somebody else.

1084
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,280
No siree.
I never forget a face.

1085
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:18,824
Although,
I was little drunk at the time.

1086
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,283
Well, there you are.

1087
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,619
The fellow you saw
probably had two faces.

1088
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,038
- Been in Palmyra long?
- Oh, just a couple of weeks.

1089
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,581
This ain't no town for barbers.

1090
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,208
The fellows that ain't trying to
hide their faces

1091
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,336
for some reason or other
are too mean to spend the money.

1092
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,588
Yes, I've heard you got some
pretty tough customers here.

1093
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:36,174
Tough? Say! I'm afraid
to shave half of them.

1094
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,009
Afraid they'll get up
and cut my throat.

1095
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,929
Say, do you ever run
across this famous...

1096
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,307
- What's his name, John Brown?
- Sure, he came in here once.

1097
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,393
Strange looking man,
with a hit mark on his throat.

1098
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,727
Hit mark? What's that?

1099
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,938
Oh, it's an old barber
superstition.

1100
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,691
A little red line that runs
all the way around here.

1101
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,360
Anybody born with that mark
is bound to be hung.

1102
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,820
That so?

1103
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,156
Say, I haven't got one, have I?

1104
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,449
Not yet. Maybe.

1105
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:09,040
Well, well.

1106
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:10,876
Keep your hand away.

1107
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,211
Get it.

1108
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,386
This was quite an idea, Stuart.

1109
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,638
You coming in alone first
to look around.

1110
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,225
Is this one of your agents?

1111
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:28,810
I ain't never laid eyes
on him before.

1112
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:31,438
I swear it.
I-I don't know him from Adam.

1113
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,982
What were you up to?

1114
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,067
Well, it's your move.
You figure it out.

1115
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:39,029
My next move is plain enough.

1116
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,697
Didn't they teach us
how to handle spies

1117
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,324
when we caught 'em red-handed?

1118
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,117
Same treatment for renegades,
wasn't it?

1119
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,536
When you catch 'em.

1120
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,371
This will make you quite a hero,
Stuart.

1121
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:52,250
The class of '54 will turn out
in a body for your funeral.

1122
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,711
They may even hang your picture
in the West Point Library.

1123
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,588
There's worst places to hang.

1124
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,174
Get him out of here, Rader.
We're wasting time.

1125
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:03,053
Just having a last few words
with an old classmate of mine.

1126
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,180
And I had them coming to me.

1127
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,894
Come on, get up.

1128
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,772
We're gonna give you a good look
at what you came to see.

1129
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,246
We can't afford
to take chances, sir.

1130
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,957
He was sent here as a spy. It's
my advice to get rid of him.

1131
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,584
- Let's string him up.
- Goddamn right.

1132
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:38,213
What did you hope to achieve
by coming alone to Palmyra?

1133
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,756
The army has orders
from Washington

1134
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,383
to bring you to trial.

1135
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,510
I hoped that if I came
face to face with you first

1136
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,595
a lot of unnecessary bloodshed
might be avoided

1137
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,097
for your men and mine.

1138
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,723
Were you innocent enough
to think that I would

1139
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:51,351
surrender myself to you
without a fight?

1140
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,019
I hope that you might
consider yourself

1141
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,896
innocent enough to do that.

1142
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,357
Half of the people in America
believe in your theory.

1143
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,234
A lot of them even condone
your methods.

1144
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,111
That'll guarantee you
a public trial.

1145
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,113
Fool.

1146
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,491
I'm not on trial,
but the nation itself.

1147
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:10,787
Are you too stupid and blinded
by a uniform to see what I see?

1148
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,624
A dark and evil curse
laying all over this land.

1149
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:17,711
A carnal sin against God.

1150
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,296
It can only be wiped out
in blood.

1151
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,089
But why in blood?

1152
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,049
The people of the Virginia
have considered a resolution

1153
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,302
to abolish slavery
for a long time.

1154
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,721
They sense that it's
a moral wrong.

1155
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,640
And the rest of the South
will follow Virginia's example.

1156
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,852
- All I ask is time.
- Time?

1157
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:35,312
Time?

1158
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,314
For 30 years,
I waited for the South

1159
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,357
to cleanse it's soul
of this crime.

1160
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,026
Since childhood
I've been possessed

1161
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:44,279
with the fire of correcting
this wrong.

1162
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,781
I tried peaceful agitation.

1163
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,908
As God as my witness, I tried.

1164
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,579
Peaceful means failed
long ago.

1165
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,331
Now I shall force a decision

1166
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:57,334
by bringing both side
into armed conflict.

1167
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:00,337
Letters, words, talk,
the time has ended for that.

1168
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,213
Strength and action
are wanted now.

1169
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:03,882
Not a voice crying
in the wilderness

1170
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:07,510
but a David armed
with the power and the glory.

1171
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:10,680
- David had a son, hadn't he?
- A son?

1172
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,640
Yes, Absalom,
who deserted his father

1173
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,559
and went over to the enemy.

1174
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,066
What're you trying to tell me,
Stuart?

1175
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:23,401
And Absalom died
because he feared his father.

1176
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,406
Jason is dead!

1177
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,659
So be it.

1178
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:35,080
My son has paid for the sins
of this world with his life

1179
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,332
as once did the son of God.

1180
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,377
It shall not be in vain.

1181
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:43,755
Whether you kill me or not
my army will

1182
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,924
crush you all in the end.

1183
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,718
My advice to you is to find
peace with your maker.

1184
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,185
Now the big one.
Sit down.

1185
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,270
I never liked barber's know-how.

1186
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,272
Now spill out,
you little, pitirim weasel.

1187
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,774
I'll cut your throat!
Where'd he go?

1188
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,734
I swear, I don't know, boys,
uh, well,

1189
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,069
th... th... they've took him out
that way.

1190
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,654
- Who took him?
- T... three fellas.

1191
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,656
One of them was Oliver Brown.

1192
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,995
Do you see this razor?
Well, I'm keepin' it.

1193
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,956
If you moved a hair when we get
back, I'm gonna strop it

1194
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,250
on your liver
and barbecue your carcass.

1195
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,252
Now you stay where you are.

1196
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,676
Back East for me!

1197
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,774
I called you all together
as witnesses

1198
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,860
to hear my words.

1199
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,070
An enemy to the cause
has entered our midst

1200
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,697
stealthily, and by night.

1201
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,741
With the purpose of planning our
destruction.

1202
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,243
The hand that has never
failed us

1203
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,203
has come once again
to our protection.

1204
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,999
It's not with malice or revenge
that we take this man's life

1205
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,417
but in just retribution.

1206
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,628
As befits all enemies
of mankind.

1207
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,755
All enemies of God.

1208
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,633
Ready, sir.

1209
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,704
Get back! Get back!
Move away from that door.

1210
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:43,041
Cover those windows!
Surround the barn!

1211
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,964
Get to the back door!

1212
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:44,102
Hold on there, captain!

1213
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,020
Get down from there
if you don't wanna get killed.

1214
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:47,522
We's coming, boss.

1215
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,524
That white man
talk like he's a friend.

1216
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,957
Lord all mercy, boss!
Looky here!

1217
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,792
Get the bags, quick.

1218
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,537
Alright, get away
from the barn, men.

1219
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,998
- Move on! Hurry it up!
- Let him burn!

1220
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,500
Move on the wagons!

1221
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:51,669
Go! Get away from the barn.

1222
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,213
Get those wagons rolling.

1223
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,017
Take cover! Behind the wagons!

1224
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,537
It's Oliver!
First Jason, now him.

1225
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,749
- You wanna fight on, John?
- As long as breath is in me!

1226
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,169
Surround the church!

1227
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,861
- You alright, sir?
- Jeb!

1228
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,825
After them, George.
Don't let them get away.

1229
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,034
Load up!

1230
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:07,722
Ouch! That's too tight, Mammy.

1231
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,807
Don't tell me how to do this,
boy.

1232
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:12,435
I've been wrapping
white folks all my life.

1233
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,771
When they was babies
I wrapped one end

1234
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,231
and when they'd growed up
and took on too much corn liquor

1235
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,233
then I wrapped the other end.

1236
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,985
Huh. Is that what made you
leave home?

1237
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:25,490
Well, old John Brown said
he is gonna give us freedom

1238
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:28,159
but shook-in's, if this here
Kansas is freedom

1239
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,702
then I ain't got no use for it.

1240
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,621
- No, sir.
- Me neither.

1241
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,664
I just wants to get back home
to Texas

1242
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,958
and sit till kingdom come.

1243
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,509
Dismount and fall out.

1244
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:54,310
Well, we had a nice ride.

1245
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,479
- Both ways.
- Lost him, huh?

1246
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,481
He and a few others got away
in the hills.

1247
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:01,400
I think I hit one, Jeb.
You oughta heard him holler.

1248
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:03,778
Heard him holler?
You jug head, that was me.

1249
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,114
- You shot my hat off.
- Well, it won't matter much.

1250
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:08,991
He's broken for good.

1251
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,869
From now on, he'll find
every man's hand against him.

1252
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:14,789
Nothing will ever break
the force of John Brown, Jeb.

1253
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:17,542
- Not even death.
- Oh, you are wrong, George.

1254
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,545
He's finished.
His force is broken forever.

1255
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,601
Why has thou afflicted
thy servant, oh, lord?

1256
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,687
Were for do I not find favor
with thee?

1257
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,525
Why has thou laid the weight
of all his people upon me?

1258
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,614
Yes.

1259
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,950
This is a sign for which
I have waited, oh, lord.

1260
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,786
This is your command.
The burning bush!

1261
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,959
Let there be no peace
in all this land

1262
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,671
until we have revenged ourselves
upon thine enemies.

1263
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:06,090
As once you smote
the Philistines

1264
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:08,593
smite now the fury of thy wrath

1265
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:12,346
upon these blind misbegotten
fools.

1266
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,640
I shall be thy right hand.

1267
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:18,394
I, John Brown,
shall be the sword of Jehovah.

1268
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,080
Take a good look, gentlemen.

1269
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,374
The beginning of the railroad
to Santa Fe.

1270
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,127
These rails are gonna stretch
their way right across old trail

1271
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:46,380
right over Kansas down into
the territory of New Mexico.

1272
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,549
Someday we can tell our
grandchildren that we opened

1273
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,635
the doors of America
to the great Southwest.

1274
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:53,054
- Won't we, Kit?
- You just build your railroad.

1275
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,473
I'm not guaranteeing
anything.

1276
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,643
Yep! The end of John Brown
was our beginning.

1277
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:00,311
Maybe it'll cost a lot more
blood and grief

1278
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:01,729
but it's gonna be worth it.

1279
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,607
Dad, can I ring the bell
on the first train?

1280
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,567
Yep, and blow the whistle.

1281
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,152
That'll be a day
you can live for, Kit.

1282
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,737

01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,136
Congratulations, boys.

1296
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,388
- Thanks, sir.
- That was excellent.

1297
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,557
I didn't recognize the song.
Where does it come from?

1298
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,726
It's an old army song,
a farewell.

1299
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,227
These young men
have all been promoted

1300
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,770
and are ordered back
to Washington.

1301
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,480
- That's splendid.
- You, lucky devils!

1302
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,899
I had to wait ten years
for my captaincy.

1303
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,693
And I also followed tradition
by proposing

1304
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,820
to my wife the same night.

1305
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:33,904
Would you like some
refreshments?

1306
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,781
- Yes, I would.
- Splendid idea.

1307
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:40,494
Well, I think I'll run down
to the stable.

1308
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,580
Horse threw a shoe this morning.
Ah. See you later.

1309
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,665
I'll go with you,
maybe I can find it.

1310
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,256
Why did you have to go
and lie for

1311
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:53,924
tellin' the major
we is the best barbeque

1312
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,342
along the Santa Fe trail?

1313
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,636
Oh, I just mentioned it
sort of casual.

1314
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,430
How'd I know he was gonna
take us up on it?

1315
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,098
Wait till he starts eating this.

1316
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,893
He won't take us up,
he'd take us up and out.

1317
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,395
Do you think it's gonna be hard
chewing, Tex?

1318
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,732
Well, I don't know,
I still got a hunch

1319
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,276
we should've skinned it first.

1320
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,278
We took the horns off of it,
didn't we?

1321
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,866
What is a captain's pay, Jeb,
$38?

1322
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,993
- Uh-uh, $40.
- Forty a month.

1323
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:24,371
Say, that's enough to get..

1324
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:26,207
- Go on, get what?
- Well, you know, this and that.

1325
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,209
What're you planning to do
with your extra pay?

1326
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:35,132
Exactly the same thing
as you are, son.

1327
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:36,842
- Want to draw straws?
- Not this time.

1328
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,469
This means too much.

1329
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,513
Well, how're we gonna
handle it then? Take turns?

1330
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:44,225
I don't trust you Southern boys
in the moon light.

1331
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,560
Alright,
let's ask her together.

1332
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,565
- Hey!
- Wait a minute.

1333
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,984
- What is this? You lunatics!
- Come on. Don't argue..

1334
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:55,986
Just come along and listen.

1335
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,157
There you are.

1336
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,951
George has got something
to ask you, Kit.

1337
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,410
You have the floor, George.

1338
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:06,080
Well, I don't know
just how to start, Kit.

1339
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,665
But there's an old Indian woman
who hangs around

1340
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:09,125
the fort
and tells people's fortunes.

1341
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,293
She is supposed to be
a wonder at it and..

1342
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,255
- Well..
- Yes, George?

1343
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,924
Well, she said I'm going
to get married soon

1344
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,884
to a very beautiful girl.

1345
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,845
Did she, George?
That's very nice.

1346
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:23,931
Pretty slick opening remark.

1347
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:27,977
Kit, were you ever by any chance
a blonde?

1348
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,855
- Why? No. Not even as a baby.
- Are you sure?

1349
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:32,940
This old woman
has never been wrong before.

1350
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:35,568
- Absolutely sure.
- Well, maybe she's still right.

1351
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,987
There's a whole lot of beautiful
blondes in the world, George.

1352
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,488
Let's ask her.

1353
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,824
- Let's.
- Wait a minute.

1354
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:46,287
Kit, are you in love with him
and not with me?

1355
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,913
I guess I am, George.

1356
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,665
- You're gonna marry him?
- Oh, wait a minute.

1357
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,251
I can handle this proposal
from now, son.

1358
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,044
Kit, you really mean that?

1359
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,005
You haven't asked me
anything yet.

1360
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,883
I wonder if I said
the wrong thing.

1361
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:01,802
Mm-mm-mm, couldn't have been
more perfect.

1362
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,679
Now where's that Indian?

1363
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,290
What she saying, Kit?
You know the lingo.

1364
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,209
She says that this is
one of the last times

1365
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:35,836
we'll all of us be together
as friends.

1366
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,298
Now ask her something sensible.

1367
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:42,134
Who is gonna be
the first general?

1368
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:54,897
She says that one day
you'll all be famous men.

1369
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,732
Great in battle.

1370
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,609
But bitter enemies.

1371
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,240
Pickett, Hood, Custer, Sheridan,
Longstreet

1372
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:06,242
and me enemies?
Now I know she's crazy.

1373
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:08,160
Where did you ever pickup
this old figure, George?

1374
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,704
I can tell better fortunes
than that with tea leaves.

1375
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:12,039
Well, we might as well get
our money's worth.

1376
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,165
Ask what we're gonna
fight about.

1377
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,584
Yeah, who is gonna start it?

1378
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,898
Well, what's this?
Too ridiculous to tell?

1379
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:41,318
She says,
the fight has already started.

1380
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:44,613
Somewhere in the east,
a man is lighting a torch.

1381
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,991
Now, at this very moment.

1382
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:49,868
The two of us will help
to kill him.

1383
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:51,870
But none of us can stop him.

1384
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,976
Here is where
I would attack first.

1385
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:16,228
The arsenal at Harpers Ferry.

1386
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:19,231
Give me only a 100 good men,
Dr. Russell.

1387
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:22,985
Well armed and God-fearing men
who believe in the cause.

1388
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,737
I will lead them through
Virginia.

1389
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,072
Arouse the thousands
of discontented slaves

1390
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:28,490
who will flock to join us.

1391
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,159
Then sweep down through
the south.

1392
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:33,495
Through the Carolinas,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi

1393
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,081
then with the entire nation
in the state of chaos

1394
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:38,000
we can dictate our own terms.

1395
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,836
Have you considered the army,
Captain Brown?

1396
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:42,629
Surely, they'll be after you
in full force

1397
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:44,381
within a few hours
after you first attack.

1398
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:47,634
Let them come, Dr. Russell.
Let them try to stop me.

1399
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,470
I've studied that country
for years.

1400
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:50,888
It's full of good hiding places

1401
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:53,349
natural forts where large forces
of brave men

1402
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,142
can defy pursuit indefinitely.

1403
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,479
Mr. Rader will go ahead of us
and scout the town.

1404
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,105
With his knowledge
of military methods

1405
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,316
and our great advantage
of surprise

1406
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,276
we can outwit the army
at every turn.

1407
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,278
Captain Brown,
this plan of yours is mad.

1408
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,238
Worse than mad,
it's high treason.

1409
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,991
Such a brazen attack
would lead to civil war.

1410
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:13,827
Exactly!
That is exactly what I want.

1411
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:16,538
Is it your wish then to destroy
the union?

1412
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:20,250
My answer to that is yes.
To the devil with the union.

1413
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:24,129
We've got to fight sometime,
it might as well be now.

1414
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,468
Gentlemen, I came here to Boston
at great personal risk.

1415
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,637
There's a price on my head
of $10,000.

1416
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,098
So, my time is precious.

1417
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:37,684
You've given me much help
and encouragement up to now.

1418
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:40,062
But all that we've done
in Kansas and elsewhere

1419
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,605
will be all wasted

1420
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:44,274
unless you see it through
to the glorious end.

1421
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,948
How much money will you need?

1422
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,124
We now possess the guns,
ammunition

1423
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:02,376
pikes, a complete store
of supplies.

1424
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,586
To place in the RSF,
Harpers Ferry

1425
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,422
day break, Monday,
October the 16th.

1426
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:08,924
We must strike with two forces,
suddenly with complete surprise

1427
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,385
and then move rapidly
through Virginia.

1428
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,011
You men all know what will be
demanded of you.

1429
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,139
- Yes, we are waiting, captain.
- Captain.

1430
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:21,395
It's Rader. He made good time.

1431
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:33,115
Well, what did you find?

1432
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,367
Speak up. Is anything wrong
at Harpers Ferry.

1433
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:36,952
Well, the town itself
won't any trouble.

1434
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,871
There's a bridge at the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad

1435
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:39,913
to be blocked
and we got to cut that

1436
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:41,373
telegraph line to Washington.

1437
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,000
What about the government
arsenal?

1438
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,586
It's guarded by only two men.

1439
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,421
Here, I made this rough map
of the place.

1440
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:51,550
Good. Excellent.

1441
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,510
This is precisely what I wanted.

1442
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,262
We must first take
some hostages from the town

1443
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,680
that'll prevent an attack
by the civilians.

1444
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:58,015
Then we'll move directly
on the arsenal.

1445
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:00,476
- There's something else.
- What?

1446
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:02,311
I want to settle our account.

1447
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:03,729
Back in Kansas
you promised to pay me

1448
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,355
what's due
when you got the money.

1449
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,358
How dare you demand a settlement
of a private matter?

1450
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,527
With the nation hour of
deliverance not three days off.

1451
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,863
That's putting the cart
before the horse, isn't it?

1452
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:14,823
I've done a job for you
nobody else can do.

1453
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:16,325
So, I was right at Palmyra

1454
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,659
the cause itself
means nothing to you.

1455
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:18,952
I'm only holding you
to your word.

1456
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,412
Are you, indeed,
have you forgotten so

1457
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:21,622
quickly my measures with
disloyalty?

1458
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:23,373
I haven't forgotten anything.

1459
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:25,292
But you got the money to pay me
and you can't afford not to.

1460
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,419
Then add this to your memory.

1461
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,049
I haven't waited 30 years

1462
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,134
to bargain with a rouge
at the final hour.

1463
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,036
Hiya.

1464
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,955
This is the kind of army life
I like.

1465
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,332
- Do you ever see me waltz?
- I've heard of it.

1466
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:07,918
But this ain't no Santa Fe
shake down.

1467
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:11,213
Hold it. You're in high society
now, come on.

1468
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,051
May I have your invitations
please, gentlemen?

1469
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:19,137
- What's them?
- Thems 'em little white cards.

1470
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:22,599
We ain't go no invitations, Joe.
Can't we get in on our uniforms?

1471
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:26,103
No, sir. Not unless you wants to
go right out on 'em again.

1472
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,230
Oh, we're the fellows
who cleaned up Kansas.

1473
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,232
- Ain't you ever heard of us.
- Sorry, sir.

1474
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,317
But we don't need no cleaning.

1475
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,485
Good evening.

1476
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,675
Hello, handsome.

1477
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,344
- Oh, hi, Jeb.
- My! You're a dream tonight.

1478
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:00,971
- How's the party?
- I don't know.

1479
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,681
She hasn't come out yet.

1480
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,933
- Who you waiting for?
- Old friend of mine.

1481
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:06,852
Promised me a surprise tonight.

1482
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,937
A night I'd remember
the rest of my life.

1483
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:11,189
Yeah? You don't know any girl
here but Kit, you know?

1484
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:12,816
I-I'm not talking.

1485
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,651
Maybe you don't rate quite as
high as you think you do

1486
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,153
Captain Stuart.

1487
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,114
Hello, Kit.

1488
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,116
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

1489
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,035
Say, George was just telling me
you've promised him

1490
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,411
the biggest night of his life.

1491
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:26,496
- Where do I come in?
- You don't.

1492
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,665
- I'm very fond of George.
- Thank you, Kit.

1493
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:32,044
I haven't told you this, but we
have a deep understanding.

1494
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,630
Wait a minute, Kit.
Are you serious? What is this?

1495
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:37,507
I'm gonna take care of George
for the rest of his life.

1496
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:39,259
That is if he's the man
I think he is.

1497
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:40,886
Oh, Kit, I have my faults.

1498
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,012
But I can be as faithful
and loyal

1499
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,055
as any man that ever lived.

1500
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,389
We'll soon see.

1501
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:47,267
Now wait here, both of you.

1502
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:49,144
Tough luck, son,
I guess we can't all

1503
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:51,104
have charm and good looks too.

1504
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:53,231
Custer, I hope you are joking
or you're not gonna have either.

1505
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:55,525
Oh, don't take it so hard, I
mean, this is something that...

1506
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:56,610
Hup.

1507
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:00,781
Charlotte, I want you to meet

1508
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,783
Captain Custer
and Captain Stuart.

1509
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,327
This is Charlotte Davis. We were
schoolmates together in Boston.

1510
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,871
- It's a pleasure, Ms. Davis.
Thank you, captain.

1511
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:10,040
Yes, indeed.
A great pleasure.

1512
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:12,250
I've heard so much about you,
Captain Custer.

1513
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:14,419
- Me?
Mm-hm.

1514
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:18,006
Well, I, uh...
Well, that is, uh, I mean...

1515
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,801
Well, uh...
well, that is... I...

1516
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,136
- Shall we dance, Jeb?
- Yes, of course.

1517
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:27,265
- Who is she?
- That's the blonde.

1518
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:30,143
The one that George was promised
by old "sit in the mud."

1519
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:32,521
Oh! I see.

1520
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,149
Well, she's pretty nice.

1521
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:39,653
Don't you think?

1522
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,740
Left wheel.

1523
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:47,661
Company, halt!

1524
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:50,831
Present arms,
prepare to scoop.

1525
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:59,756
- Uh, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1526
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,178
About face!

1527
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:07,556
Company, forward march!

1528
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:09,391
Eyes right!

1529
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:11,601
Right wheel.

1530
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:13,937
Well, there I was right out
in the middle of Kansas

1531
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:16,815
facing 500 crazy fanatics
heavily armed.

1532
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,817
And me with only 15 soldiers.

1533
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,319
Good heavens, captain.
How terrifying.

1534
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,571
What did you do?

1535
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,281
I sized up the situation
at a glance

1536
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:25,866
dismounted and walked
straight toward them.

1537
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,285
Not... not alone.

1538
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,704
My dear, young lady, there comes
a time in every soldier's life

1539
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,706
when he must stand
or fall alone.

1540
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,166
And if you knew the army
you'd understand

1541
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,585
that he who hesitates is lost.

1542
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,920
Well, that was something
wonderful, captain.

1543
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,797
Oh, it was nothing. Really.

1544
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,808
Will you come and meet
my father, captain?

1545
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:55,437
Why, I'd be delighted.
Is he in the government service?

1546
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,647
Yes, but I think he'll lose
his job in the next election.

1547
01:27:57,731 --> 01:28:00,150
Oh, that's too bad.
Say, he should be in the army.

1548
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:01,651
You know,
politics don't bother us.

1549
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:03,236
He'd rather go fishing anyway.

1550
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,488
- Father.
- Hello, Charlotte.

1551
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:06,198
- Hello, Colonel Lee.
- My dear.

1552
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,201
Father, I'd like you to meet
Captain George Custer.

1553
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,411
Oh, but of course I met
the captain at West Point

1554
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:13,205
when he graduated, didn't I?

1555
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,165
- Yes, sir.
- How're you, Custer?

1556
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,750
I'm fine, Colonel Lee.

1557
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,752
We've heard good things
about you, congratulations.

1558
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:20,378
Yes, the captain's just been
telling me

1559
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,756
how he put down the trouble
in Kansas by himself.

1560
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,803
Splendid job at Palmyra.
Splendid.

1561
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,222
Wasn't there also a chap
named Stuart, uh...

1562
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,641
Jeb Stuart connected
with that campaign?

1563
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,684
Stuart?

1564
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:37,854
Yes, sir. He was around.

1565
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:39,606
Shall we dance?

1566
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,082
Left turn.

1567
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,419
About face.

1568
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:02,879
March!

1569
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:10,262
- Jeb.
- Go away.

1570
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,805
You danced with your sister
once already.

1571
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:13,932
I don't want her,
I want you, come on.

1572
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,225
Hey, you can't leave me
stranded alone

1573
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:16,351
in the middle of ball room.

1574
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:18,061
Quiet, spread. Phil, Phil.

1575
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:20,272
Take over this detail,
will you?

1576
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,693
- Are you drunk?
- If I'm not, I ought to be.

1577
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:25,986
I've just seen enough to knock
anybody down.

1578
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:27,279
What're you talking about?

1579
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,530
An old friend of yours
is outside.

1580
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,407
And he asked me
to bring you to him.

1581
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,255
It's real.
I almost touched it.

1582
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,979
What're you doing here?

1583
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,523
I came to find you.

1584
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,192
I know what you think of me,
Stuart. That I'm no good.

1585
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:09,654
Well, maybe you're right.

1586
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:10,947
Well, maybe I've got something
to tell you

1587
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:12,365
that'll change your opinion.

1588
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,117
You'll have a hard time
doing that.

1589
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,662
Suppose I told you that I left
John Brown three hours ago

1590
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,581
with a well armed force of men

1591
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:22,626
not very many miles
from where we're standing.

1592
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,294
I'd say
you are out of your mind.

1593
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,171
All set to strike
at Harpers Ferry

1594
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:29,507
on the Maryland-Virginia line
sometime tonight.

1595
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,885
With the reinforcements
of over 1200 men

1596
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:34,804
expected before daybreak
from Pennsylvania.

1597
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:37,766
Brown plans to arouse the slaves

1598
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:39,517
first in Virginia
and then throughout the south

1599
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,269
in open rebellion.

1600
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:44,189
The telegraph wires will be cut
and he'll block the railroad

1601
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,608
and then at daybreak
they rush the arsenal

1602
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:48,360
take thousands of weapons
with the idea

1603
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:50,445
of arming the Negroes.

1604
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:53,239
Well, that's the situation,
gentlemen. Move for move.

1605
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:55,158
I don't know, you may be able
to get there ahead of 'em

1606
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:58,411
but if you do,
you've got to move fast tonight.

1607
01:30:58,495 --> 01:31:01,247
It's fantastic,
our Secret Service has reported

1608
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:02,707
John Brown to be
out of the country.

1609
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,335
Well, I oughta know where he is?

1610
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:07,170
I've been with him
every day and every mile

1611
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:08,463
since we left Kansas.

1612
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:11,967
Then why have you informed
on him.

1613
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:15,345
Don't forget, colonel,
I was in the service once.

1614
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:16,972
I was young,
and I made a mistake.

1615
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:20,392
I didn't know that then
but I do now.

1616
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,143
I guess some of the things
we learned at West Point

1617
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:26,481
stay on inside of us
a lot deeper than we realize.

1618
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:29,275
Anyway, I couldn't stand by
and see my country torn apart

1619
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:31,236
by a mad man like Brown.

1620
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,946
I had to come here.

1621
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:36,032
This was something a lot bigger
than myself.

1622
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:37,534
Couldn't have been
the size of the reward

1623
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:38,994
you'll get for turning him in,
could it?

1624
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:41,788
I said why I came here,
and that's the truth.

1625
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:45,166
But I am entitled any reward.

1626
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:49,546
I'm even willing to go back
there and rejoin him tonight

1627
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:53,633
just in case he gets suspicious
or changes his plans.

1628
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:56,594
Now what more proof
do you want than that?

1629
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:59,723
I believe him because
it's too dangerous not to.

1630
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:01,433
How soon can you start, colonel?

1631
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,601
We'll be ready to leave
in an hour.

1632
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:05,270
The officers are all here.

1633
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,521
Call them at once and proceed

1634
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:09,065
with all speed
to Harpers Ferry.

1635
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:18,700
You have your orders,
Captain Stuart?

1636
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,118
Yes, sir.

1637
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:22,746
Jeb, what is it?

1638
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:24,372
- What's happening?
- John Brown.

1639
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:25,749
Get the little Davis girl to
take you home.

1640
01:32:25,832 --> 01:32:27,167
- Will you, darling?
- But why, but...

1641
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,044
I'm sorry.
I can't explain now, no time.

1642
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:30,378
Try to keep the others calm,
tell 'em,

1643
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,630
there's nothing
to be excited about.

1644
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:34,299
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1645
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,114
Good. There's no more worry
on that score.

1646
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:00,575
You say no train is due until
well after daybreak.

1647
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:02,410
No, sir, not until 8 o'clock.

1648
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:05,413
I rode within ten miles of
Washington to make sure.

1649
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:06,831
What kept you so long?

1650
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,541
I had to take a side road
both ways.

1651
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,336
Shubel, Townsley.

1652
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,630
Get your men
block the railroad bridge.

1653
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:15,465
We meet below the arsenal
at daybreak.

1654
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:17,717
Kitzmiller, go to the town with
20 men and get the hostages.

1655
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:19,135
You know the ones?
Yes sir.

1656
01:33:19,219 --> 01:33:20,386
Rest you men, follow me.

1657
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,292
Drop your guns.

1658
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,972
Captain, we got enough guns here
to arm a 1000 men.

1659
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,723
And plenty of powder
and bullets.

1660
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:07,892
Stack those guns and ammunition
near the door ready to haul.

1661
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:09,519
Hurry up, boys,
get 'em out there.

1662
01:34:09,602 --> 01:34:11,604
Men from Pennsylvania will
be here within the hour.

1663
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:13,231
This isn't an arsenal,
it's a fortress.

1664
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,983
We could stand off
the whole army here.

1665
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:16,568
What about the prisoners,
captain?

1666
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,653
What is the meaning
of this outrage?

1667
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:21,865
Why have you broken into our
homes and dragged us here?

1668
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:25,952
- Who are you? John Brown!
- I am John Brown of Kansas.

1669
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:27,787
You are prisoners
of the provisional government

1670
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:29,289
of the United States.

1671
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,040
If the citizens of
Harpers Ferry

1672
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:34,836
attempt any interference,
I shall use you as I see fit.

1673
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:36,379
Otherwise, you will be
peacefully released

1674
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:39,007
when we depart.

1675
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,134
We must adhere to our schedule
to the precise minute.

1676
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:43,094
We will leave here
at 10 o'clock and by nightfall

1677
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:44,721
we should be 35 miles
into Virginia.

1678
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:46,389
What about the men
from Pennsylvania, sir?

1679
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:47,849
If they're late in arriving,
we cannot wait.

1680
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,893
Wouldn't that be taking
a long chance?

1681
01:34:49,976 --> 01:34:51,686
No word of us can leak out
until tomorrow

1682
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:54,731
maybe even two or three days,
and then we'd be 1,500 men.

1683
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:57,066
I don't see that there's
any reason to hurry.

1684
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:59,319
- That sound sensible.
- I disagree.

1685
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:00,695
I'm anxious to get out of here
and time

1686
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:02,155
is our most valuable weapon.

1687
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:04,490
Well, you're in command, sir.

1688
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:06,659
But that's been the fatal
mistake to many an expedition.

1689
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:08,703
My advice is to wait.

1690
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,890
Some of the townspeople
are firing at us?

1691
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:31,184
Just a handful of "em
with old shotguns.

1692
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:34,229
We can clean them out
in five minutes.

1693
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:40,360
Idiots! Why do they fight us?
Can't they understand?

1694
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,958
- What is your name?
- Brewer.

1695
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:57,335
If you value your life and those
of your fellow townsman

1696
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:59,170
you will do as I say.

1697
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:01,923
Yes.

1698
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:15,937
Stop firing. You're endangering
the your lives of your friends.

1699
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:20,525
John Brown promises that if we
leave the arsenal in his hands

1700
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,610
he will harm none of us.

1701
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:25,613
No! Run down to us!

1702
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:27,824
We'll cover you. Quick.

1703
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,291
Stupid cattle!

1704
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:39,002
Can't they understand
we're here on a righteous cause.

1705
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:42,297
Their interests are also ours.
The good of the whole nation.

1706
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,965
We'll leave out lesson
at Harpers Ferry

1707
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:45,717
for the rest of the South
to profit by.

1708
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,052
Wipe out those fools
at the foot of the hill.

1709
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,577
Cease firing!

1710
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,788
We're moving into the hills.

1711
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:19,083
Take all the weapons
and ammunition

1712
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,669
you can carry with speed.

1713
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:23,129
It's well past noon.

1714
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:25,631
We can wait no longer
for the Pennsylvanians.

1715
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:34,682
"Eighteen citizens
of Harpers Ferry killed,

1716
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:37,143
thirty-three wounded
by John Brown's invaders

1717
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:38,728
in open rebellion."

1718
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,858
It's from the second force
at Frederick, Maryland.

1719
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:45,985
"The road to Harpers Ferry
is blocked.

1720
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:47,820
Unable to get through."

1721
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,450
"Jefferson guards
and the Winchesters

1722
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:55,870
under Lee's command passed
through Upperville an hour ago.

1723
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:57,955
They will be the first
to arrive at the ferry."

1724
01:38:08,758 --> 01:38:11,803
- What're you watching, Rader?
- The North Road, sir...

1725
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:14,138
The North Road is over there.
This is the Washington Turnpike.

1726
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:15,723
Well, I thought our men might
circle the town...

1727
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:18,476
That was not their orders.
Help with the wagons.

1728
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,728
Yes, sir.

1729
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:22,522
Well, don't you think we ought
to wait another half hour?

1730
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:24,273
It might be...

1731
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:33,908
Every man inside!
Bolt the doors!

1732
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:35,660
- Bolt those door!
- Man the loophole!

1733
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:15,366
Wait, you said.

1734
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:18,161
"There is no cause to hurry.
Wait."

1735
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:22,248
Yes, sure I did.
I thought we had time.

1736
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:24,375
- Stuart.
- Yes, sir.

1737
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:27,253
I want you to take this under
a white flag to John Brown.

1738
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:28,880
Right, sir.

1739
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:39,807
There's to be no parlaying.
Yes or no?

1740
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,767
If it's a refusal,
wave your hat to us.

1741
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:43,394
Right, sir.

1742
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:47,732
Hang on to this, will you?

1743
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:54,113
Captain Brown,
they're coming up the road

1744
01:39:54,197 --> 01:39:55,448
with a flag of truce.

1745
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:28,231
Open the door.

1746
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:44,497
- You're John Brown of Kansas?
- I am.

1747
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,040
We've met before I think?

1748
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:48,668
And thanks to Mr. Rader,
we how meet again.

1749
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:58,302
This is Colonel Lee's formal
demand for your surrender.

1750
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:01,138
Once more, sir, you over rate
your strength and supposing

1751
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:04,141
that I can be taken
against my will.

1752
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:07,144
- That's your final answer?
- It is.

1753
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:09,146
We prefer to die here.

1754
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:18,072
Try to surround them!

1755
01:41:18,155 --> 01:41:19,448
Take troop B to the right
of the gallop,

1756
01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:20,908
troop A at the left
of the gallop.

1757
01:41:20,992 --> 01:41:24,620
Troop C, draw your guns,
dismount!

1758
01:41:24,704 --> 01:41:27,123
- Take cover!
- Forward and a gallop! Ho!

1759
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:03,534
Bring the right flank
into position.

1760
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,999
Attack with C troop
on the left flank.

1761
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:54,001
C troop, at first!

1762
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:34,166
Prepare a battering ram.

1763
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:40,548
Keep firing!

1764
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,012
Forward.

1765
01:43:47,096 --> 01:43:49,098
Forward!

1766
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:51,308
Forward!

1767
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:29,680
All of you keep on firing!

1768
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:52,495
No.

1769
01:44:52,578 --> 01:44:56,248
So Judas betrayed him
for a handful of silver.

1770
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:59,043
Don't!

1771
01:45:30,366 --> 01:45:31,575
Cease firing.

1772
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,236
Over, hut!

1773
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:43,439
Now, Kit.
He was born for this.

1774
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:46,317
I'm not crying for him, Jeb.

1775
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,069
I see something else up there.

1776
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:52,406
Something much more terrible
than just one man.

1777
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:56,285
Have you any last words,
John Brown?

1778
01:46:56,368 --> 01:46:59,914
I am only walking as God
foreordained I should walk.

1779
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:03,542
All of my actions,

1780
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:05,753
even the follies
leading to this disaster

1781
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:10,049
were decreed to happen long ages
before this world began.

1782
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:12,176
But I cannot remember
a night so dark

1783
01:47:12,259 --> 01:47:15,304
has to have hindered
the coming day,

1784
01:47:15,387 --> 01:47:18,390
or a storm so furious
has to prevent the return

1785
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:20,976
of warm sunshine
in the country of peace.

1786
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:26,315
I, John Brown,
am now quite certain

1787
01:47:26,398 --> 01:47:29,693
that the crimes of this guilty
land can never be purged away

1788
01:47:29,777 --> 01:47:31,528
but with blood.

1789
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:36,742
I let them hang me.

1790
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:38,869
I forgive them
and may God forgive them

1791
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:41,121
for they know not what they do.

1792
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:57,262
So perish all such enemies
of the union.

1793
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:59,807
All such foes of the human race.

1794
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:13,946
"For this company,
and thereto have given

1795
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:16,573
and pledged their truth
each to the other.

1796
01:48:16,657 --> 01:48:19,368
And have declared the same by
giving and receiving a ring

1797
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:21,120
and by joining hands.

1798
01:48:21,203 --> 01:48:23,998
I pronounce that
they are man and wife

1799
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:27,710
united forever with ties that no
man shall breaketh under,

1800
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:29,420
nor the years disturbed

1801
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:32,131
whose shining path shall run
together from this day

1802
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:33,757
hence unto eternity."

1802
01:48:34,305 --> 01:49:34,909
