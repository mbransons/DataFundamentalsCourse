1
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,320
Teacher.

2
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,194
I see your talents have gone
beyond the mere physical level.

3
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:47,457
Your skills are now at the point
of spiritual insight.

4
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,044
I have questions: what is the highest technique
you hope to achieve?

5
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,876
- To have no technique.
- Very good.

6
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,542
What are your thoughts
when facing an opponent?

7
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,426
There is no opponent.

8
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,132
And why is that?

9
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,425
Because the word "I" does not exist.

10
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,061
So. Continue.

11
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,103
A good fight should be...

12
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:18,813
like a small play, but played seriously.

13
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:24,452
A good martial artist does not become tense,
but ready.

14
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,073
Not thinking, yet not dreaming.

15
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,742
Ready for whatever may come.

16
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,877
When the opponent expand, I contract.

17
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,414
When he contracts, I expand.

18
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,174
And when there is an opportunity...

19
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,461
I do not hit.

20
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,344
It hits all by itself.

21
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,101
Now, you must remember...

22
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,265
the enemy has only images and illusions...

23
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,935
behind which he hides his true motives.

24
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,776
Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.

25
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:06,444
The "it" that you refer to
is a powerful weapon...

26
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:12,742
easily misused by the martial artist
who deserts his vows.

27
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:18,252
For centuries now, the code of the Shaolin Temple
has been preserved.

28
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:24,091
Remember, the honor of our brotherhood
has been held true.

29
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,259
Tell me now the Shaolin commandment number 13.

30
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,437
"A martial artist has to take
responsibility for himself...

31
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,350
and accept the consequences
of his own doing."

32
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,980
I'm ashamed to tell you now...

33
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,867
among all the Shaolin men
I have taught...

34
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,238
there is one who has turned the ways
of knowledge and strength...

35
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,249
to his own base ends.

36
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,334
He has perverted all we hold sacred.

37
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,545
His name is Han.

38
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,754
In defiance of all our beliefs...

39
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,885
he has brought disgrace
to the Shaolin Temple.

40
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,850
So it is now for you to reclaim our lost honor.

41
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,145
Yes. I understand.

42
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,316
There is a man here.
You will go to him.

43
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,076
Hello, Mr. Lee.
My name's Braithwaite.

44
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,370
Hello, Mr. Braithwaite.

45
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,924
I've come to speak to you
about a matter of great importance.

46
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,048
- Have some tea?
- Yes, indeed.

47
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,508
This is very pleasant.

48
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:05,063
Mr. Lee, I've come to speak to you
about a tournament of martial arts.

49
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,198
A tournament to which you've received an invitation.

50
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,528
Specifically, a tournament organized by Mr. Han.

51
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,162
- Han's tournament.
- I know, I know, I know.

52
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,829
But we'd very much like you to attend
that particular tournament, Mr. Lee.

53
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,752
"We," Mr. Braithwaite?

54
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,919
It's Lao's time.

55
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,088
Yes, of course.

56
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,894
Kick me.

57
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,192
Kick me.

58
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,120
What was that? An exhibition?

59
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,788
We need emotional content.

60
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,132
Try again.

61
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,644
I said, emotional content, not anger.

62
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,481
Now, try again. With me.

63
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,576
That's it.

64
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,166
How did it feel to you?

65
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,004
Let me think....

66
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,462
Don't think. Feel.

67
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:54,051
It is like a finger pointing
a way to the moon.

68
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,762
Don't concentrate on the finger...

69
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:02,351
or you will miss all that heavenly glory.

70
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,732
Do you understand?

71
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:14,613
Never take your eyes off your opponent,
even when you bow.

72
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,866
That's it.

73
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:41,939
There.

74
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,014
<i>That's Han.
That's the only film we have on him.</i>

75
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,269
We know he was a member of your temple.

76
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,273
A Shaolin monk, now a renegade.

77
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,771
<i>That's Oharra behind him.
Personal bodyguard.</i>

78
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:01,192
<i>Tough, ruthless, as you might expect,
being Han's bodyguard.</i>

79
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,405
<i>We got our hands on a demonstration film of Oharra.</i>

80
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,833
<i>All real bricks and boards,
nothing phony about any of it.</i>

81
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,997
<i>This was before he picked up
a facial scar somewhere.</i>

82
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,009
<i>This is where you'll be going.</i>

83
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,145
<i>An island fortress, really.</i>

84
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:36,061
After the war,
the nationality of the island was uncertain.

85
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,946
And sometime after that, Han bought it.

86
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,698
What do you know about Han?

87
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,239
He lives like a king on that island.

88
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,245
Totally self-sufficient.

89
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,201
All of his efforts, seemingly...

90
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,462
are directed toward supporting
what he calls his "school of martial arts."

91
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,966
Han's only contact with the outside world
is this tournament...

92
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,046
which he holds every three years.

93
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,886
<i>This was a stewardess, Mary King,
found floating in the harbor.</i>

94
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,722
<i>Nothing unusual about a body in the harbor.</i>

95
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:14,060
<i>But this girl was last seen at a party
aboard Han's private junk.</i>

96
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,397
<i>They'd reported her lost at sea
before the body was found.</i>

97
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,233
<i>We believe he selects attractive girls...</i>

98
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,068
<i>methodically builds
their dependence on drugs...</i>

99
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,702
<i>...then sells them to an elite clientele
around the world.</i>

100
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,738
<i>What did the autopsy reveal
as the cause of death?</i>

101
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,079
- <i>She did not drown.</i>
- <i>She OD'd?</i></i>

102
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:43,586
Yes. Cause of death was heroin overdose.

103
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,596
You still don't have enough
to bust up his operation.

104
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,972
We know everything. We can prove nothing.

105
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,097
We want you to go in there as our agent.

106
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,734
- Get us our evidence.
- And get out in one piece to give it to you.

107
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,605
We'll give you anything you need.

108
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,399
Electronic equipment, weapons, anything.

109
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,201
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

110
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,736
Guns.

111
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:14,075
Now, why doesn't somebody pull out
a .45 and bang, settle it?

112
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,539
No. No guns.

113
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,622
Look at this map here.

114
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:26,011
As you know, the possession of a weapon
is a serious offense here.

115
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:32,017
Han's island rests partly
within our territorial waters.

116
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,929
If we had the slightest reason to believe
he has any kind of arsenal...

117
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,560
we'd move in on him.

118
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,443
Besides, Han would never allow guns
on the island anyway.

119
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:46,148
He had a bad experience with them once
and he's fearful of assassination.

120
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:50,741
You can't really blame him.
Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.

121
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,242
I guess I won't need anything.

122
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,704
There's a radio on the island.
We'll monitor it...

123
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,789
on the chance you can get to it.

124
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,461
And then you come?

125
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,032
Someone will.

126
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,217
We aren't an agency of enforcement.

127
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:10,510
We function as gatherers of information, evidence.

128
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,968
Upon which interested governments can act.

129
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:18,685
I see. If there's any trouble,
you make a phone call.

130
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,020
Oh, by the way, two months ago...

131
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:25,650
we managed to place a female operative
on the island.

132
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,985
Since then, we've lost her.

133
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,530
If she's there, she might have something.

134
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,320
Name's Mei Ling.

135
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,662
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.

136
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,784
<i>But now the time has come
to tell you something very difficult.</i>

137
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:26,040
I'm happy you have decided to go
to Han's tournament.

138
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,216
Yeah.

139
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:33,338
The last of the tournaments
were held three years ago.

140
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:38,682
I was in the city with your sister
at that time.

141
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,105
I didn't know that.

142
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,441
Yes.

143
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,271
<i>Many of Han's men
had come in from the island.</i>

144
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,784
<i>They were everywhere, bullying and arrogant.</i>

145
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,116
<i>We were on our way into town.</i>

146
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,352
Stay back!

147
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,358
Run! Run!

148
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,365
Now!

149
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,150
Now you know the truth.

150
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,690
When you get to the city...

151
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,862
pay your respects to your sister
and your mother.

152
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,701
I will, old man.

153
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,689
You will not agree
with what I am going to do.

154
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,737
It is contrary to all
that you have taught me...

155
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,901
and all that Su Lin believed.

156
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,412
I must leave.

157
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,419
Please try to find a way to forgive me.

158
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,243
<i>Double or nothing?</i>

159
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,493
That's about 1000 bucks a foot, Roper.

160
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,496
Why not?

161
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,730
I'm sorry, Mr. Roper isn't in right now.
May I take a message?

162
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,544
That's a tough shot, Mr. Roper.

163
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:11,550
Excuse me, fellas.

164
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,349
- I say he can't make it.
- What'll you bet?

165
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,018
You gotta love him.

166
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:23,308
Come on, Roper.
It's 175 big ones by Monday the 15th.

167
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,726
Only 150.

168
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,358
You forget interest.

169
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,776
- Maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.
- You take advantage, Roper.

170
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,777
Come on, fellas.

171
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,785
It's the dough, Roper,
or we gotta break something.

172
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,912
You got it?

173
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,918
Freddie says this is for your own good.

174
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,607
Better confirm that flight to Hong Kong for me.

175
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:19,119
- How much do I have left in the bank?
- $63.43.

176
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,576
- It's all yours.
- Thanks.

177
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:26,212
- Only, I think you'll need it.
- You wanna bet?

178
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,548
Double-punching. Ready....

179
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,587
Going on a trip, are you?

180
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:47,558
- Hey, this jig's got a passport.
- Where you going, jig?

181
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:53,773
- Where's the plane ticket for?
- Hong Kong, via Hawaii.

182
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,236
He's not going to Hawaii.

183
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,734
Well, look what we got here!

184
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,620
Assaulting a police officer.

185
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:58,166
- Hey, soldier, shape it up!
- Roper! Hey, how are you, man?

186
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,337
How am I, man? How am I?
I'm glad to see you, that's how I am.

187
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:06,174
- Hey, how long has it been? Five...?
- Six years, man.

188
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,183
- Six.
- It's not as long as it seems.

189
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,843
Yeah, I know what you mean.

190
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,811
- What you been doing since Nam?
- Hanging in a little bit.

191
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,066
- All these yours?
- Always first-class.

192
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,145
Same old Roper.

193
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,700
Come here.

194
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,120
- Parsons.
- Yeah, from New Zealand.

195
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,160
This man's putting quite a collection together.

196
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,204
Know him?

197
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,376
Never saw him before.

198
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,883
What do you know about this Han cat?

199
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,717
Just rumors. I hear he likes to live big.

200
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,391
They don't live so big over there.

201
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,056
Ghettos are the same all over the world.

202
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,566
They stink.

203
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,857
Same old Williams.

204
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,235
Yeah.

205
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,068
What have we got here?
A little action.

206
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,740
Insects. Okay, I'll lay you 50 bucks
on the big one.

207
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,997
Fifty. $50 on the big one, all right?

208
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,753
I'll give you 5-to-1.

209
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,084
Would you bet 100?

210
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,208
You're on.

211
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,153
Come on, let's end this thing quickly.

212
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,981
Thattababy. Come on. Come on!

213
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,854
That's it. Just get him on his back.
Get him on his back! Come on.

214
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:09,490
Come on. Give up! Come on! Hey.

215
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:14,620
Oh, for crying out loud.
Would you believe that?

216
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,284
Dumb shit.

217
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,175
Do I bother you?

218
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,757
Don't waste yourself.

219
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,770
- What's your style?
- My style?

220
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,607
You can call it the art of fighting
without fighting.

221
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,436
"The art of fighting without fighting"?

222
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,397
- Show me some of it.
- Later.

223
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,448
All right.

224
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,121
Don't you think we need more room?

225
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,751
Where else?

226
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:53,928
That island, on the beach.
We can take this boat.

227
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,221
Okay.

228
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:20,159
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, are you crazy?

229
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,083
Pull me in! Pull me in!

230
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:31,423
Don't try to pull yourself up
or I'll let go of the line.

231
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:34,019
Would you look at that?

232
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:42,203
A woman like that could teach you
a lot about yourself.

233
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,394
Welcome.

234
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,615
This way.

235
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:13,494
I'll show you to your rooms.
The banquet begins promptly at 8.

236
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,835
I think you'll find our little island
quite charming.

237
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:18,077
Say, I hope you haven't spent all that money
you won from me yesterday.

238
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,791
- I plan to win it back.
- How?

239
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,917
You'll find out, after you've lost it.

240
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,716
You seem to be very much
at home here, Mr. Roper.

241
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,303
This guy Han's got a great sense of hospitality.

242
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,219
And a fantastic sense of style.

243
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,934
Yeah, it's great.

244
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,974
Then why are you so apprehensive?

245
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,943
Apprehensive?

246
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,947
No. I was just wondering
whether it was okay to drink the water.

247
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,822
Mr. Roper, don't con me.

248
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,324
Wanna bet?

249
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:08,131
No. I really don't think so. Thanks.

250
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,504
What's the matter, you on a diet?

251
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:14,175
I'd like to eat,
if I could find something I could keep down.

252
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:19,851
Well, I can't wait to meet our host.
I hear this is only one of his B parties.

253
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,350
You ever been to a martial arts tournament like this?

254
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,228
Never.

255
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,694
I have a funny feeling we're being
fattened up for the kill.

256
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,111
Better keep an eye out for the referee.

257
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,701
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

258
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,740
Gentlemen, welcome.

259
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,451
You honor our island.

260
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,288
I look forward to a tournament...

261
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:25,796
of truly epic proportions.

262
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,715
We are unique, gentlemen...

263
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:32,003
in that we create ourselves...

264
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,047
through long years of rigorous training...

265
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,182
sacrifice, denial, pain.

266
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:43,439
We forge our bodies
in the fire of our will.

267
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,896
But tonight, let us celebrate.

268
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,907
Gentlemen, you have our gratitude.

269
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,009
Mr. Williams.

270
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,482
Mr. Williams!

271
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,122
For me?

272
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,210
You shouldn't have.

273
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,663
But....

274
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,546
I'll take you, darling.

275
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,050
And you.

276
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,555
And you.

277
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,226
And you.

278
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,904
Please understand, if I missed anyone...

279
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,481
it's been a big day.

280
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,241
I'm a little tired.

281
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,454
Oh, of course, Mr. Williams.

282
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:08,250
You must conserve your strength.

283
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,504
Come in.

284
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,837
A gift, Mr. Lee.

285
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:32,270
- If you don't see anything you like....
- There was a girl at the feast tonight.

286
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,774
Which girl, sir?

287
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,940
The owner of this dart.

288
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,946
Oh, yes. I know the one.

289
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,110
I'll send her to you.

290
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,629
Another fine mess you got me into.

291
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,801
Come in.

292
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,316
Hi.

293
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,738
Well, well, one more lovely than the next.

294
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,773
What did you have in mind?

295
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,817
Pick one.

296
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,613
I already have.

297
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,959
Wise decision.

298
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,975
I wanna talk to you, Mei Ling.

299
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,270
Where do you come from?

300
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,932
- Braithwaite--
- Let's be quiet.

301
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,474
Have you seen anything?

302
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:01,146
Nothing much.
I'm kept in the palace, watched always.

303
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,699
I know nothing of Han's activities
away from the palace.

304
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,945
But I can tell you this: people disappear.

305
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,365
- Who?
- The girls. Every one of them.

306
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:15,786
They're summoned to Han's at night
and the next day they're gone.

307
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,463
I know I don't have much time.

308
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,645
You must attend the morning ritual in uniform.

309
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,729
Outside.

310
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,417
Mr. Lee, why you no wear uniform?

311
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,315
Gentlemen, let the tournament begin!

312
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:11,985
Bolo.

313
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,038
Good work. You made me some bread.

314
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,415
- Mr. Roper.
- I'm ready.

315
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,254
Okay.

316
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:56,594
I got myself a real pigeon here.

317
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,384
Keep the action going for me, will you?

318
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,431
What do you think, Roper?

319
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:06,941
Oh, no sweat.
Give my friend 8-to-3 all the way.

320
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,637
I'm finding out about myself.

321
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,890
This is the real me, definitely.

322
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,051
Do you like it here?

323
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,391
Oh, yeah. But a little lower.

324
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:11,225
No. I mean here on the island.

325
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,069
Yeah, I like it here.
But a little lower.

326
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,731
A man like you belongs here.

327
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,536
To you, I'm just another pretty face.

328
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,111
Where you go?

329
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,741
Out in the moonlight, baby.

330
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,735
It is not allowed. You must stay.

331
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,082
Goodbye.

332
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,630
A human fly.

333
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,881
Gentlemen...

334
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,885
it seems that one of you...

335
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,429
was not content last night...

336
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:10,147
with the hospitality of the palace...

337
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:16,987
and sought diversion
elsewhere on the island.

338
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:21,780
Who it was is not important...

339
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,994
at this time.

340
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,664
What is important is that...

341
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:34,171
my guards performed their duties incompetently.

342
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:37,174
And now they must prove...

343
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:42,342
themselves worthy to remain among us.

344
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,622
Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?

345
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,080
Only at how sloppy your man works.

346
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,706
Mr. Lee?

347
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,760
Are you ready?

348
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:23,420
Boards don't hit back.

349
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:30,096
- Bolo.
- Go!

350
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,604
Oharra!

351
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,304
Oharra!

352
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:40,040
Oharra's treachery has disgraced us.

353
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:02,229
If you wanna talk about this thing,
I'll be in my room.

354
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,231
Gotcha.

355
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,320
Williams? Williams.

356
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:14,028
- Go to Han's study as soon as possible.
- All right.

357
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,039
Hey, Roper.
I'll see you in half an hour.

358
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:22,825
Right.

359
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:34,174
- Mr. Han?
- You fought well yesterday.

360
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,589
Your style is unorthodox.

361
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,257
But effective.

362
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:43,603
It is not the art,
but the combat that you enjoy.

363
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,560
The winning.

364
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,855
We are all ready to win...

365
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:53,863
just as we are born knowing only life.

366
01:05:55,577 --> 01:06:00,538
It is defeat that you must learn
to prepare for.

367
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:04,450
I don't waste my time with it.

368
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,619
When it comes, I won't even notice.

369
01:06:08,322 --> 01:06:09,378
How so?

370
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,632
I'll be too busy looking good.

371
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:16,753
What were you looking for
when you attacked my guards?

372
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,843
Wasn't me.

373
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,635
You were the only man outside the palace.

374
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,223
I was outside, but I wasn't the only one.

375
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,766
You will tell me who else.

376
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:34,488
Mr. Han, suddenly I'd like
to leave your island.

377
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:38,742
- It is not possible.
- Bullshit, Mr. Han-Man!

378
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:48,911
Man, you come right out of a comic book.

379
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,018
Been practicing?

380
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:04,880
- Williams is expecting me.
- I wanted to talk to you.

381
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:07,971
We will meet your friend Williams later.

382
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,637
- Okay.
- This is my museum.

383
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,231
It is difficult to associate these horrors...

384
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,314
with the proud civilizations
that created them:

385
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:23,654
Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe, the samurai.

386
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:27,615
They worship strength
because it is strength...

387
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,827
that makes all other values possible.

388
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:34,034
Nothing survives without it.

389
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:38,622
Who knows what delicate wonders
have died out of the world...

390
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,667
for want of the strength to survive.

391
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,676
What's this?

392
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,183
A souvenir.

393
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,484
- Up here.
- A guillotine? No, thanks.

394
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:06,195
This is the only angle I care
to see it from.

395
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,861
If you please, Mr. Roper.

396
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,615
You want me to put my head
on that thing?

397
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,459
An act of faith.

398
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,206
I'm a man of little faith, Mr. Han.

399
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:40,859
Very few people can be totally ruthless.
It isn't easy.

400
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:43,736
It takes more strength
than you might believe.

401
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,168
Now you've got eight more.

402
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:18,688
Then there is a point
you will not go beyond.

403
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,648
Faked out again.

404
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,621
This way.

405
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,297
Our power plant.

406
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,933
Oh, yeah.

407
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,169
A lifetime of women.

408
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,322
A man's strength can be measured
by his appetites.

409
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:13,326
Indeed, a man's strength flows
from his appetites.

410
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,830
Oh, no. They are my daughters.

411
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,742
Your daughters?

412
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:26,957
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that--
I misunderstood. Miss Han?

413
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:35,216
And also, they are my most personal guard.

414
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,808
I admire your judgment.

415
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:41,688
Nobody's as loyal as daddy's little girl.

416
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,815
- Mr. Roper?
- No, thanks.

417
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,853
I'll get up myself.

418
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,021
Nice meeting you.

419
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,448
Opium.

420
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:07,373
We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper.

421
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:11,043
The business of corruption
is like any other.

422
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:12,548
Oh, yeah.

423
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:17,633
Provide your customers
with products they need...

424
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,769
and encourage that need a little bit
to stimulate your market...

425
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:25,519
pretty soon your customers depend on you.
I mean, really need you.

426
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:27,730
It's the law of economics.

427
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,565
Right.

428
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,694
And here we are stimulating
quite another need.

429
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:54,760
You wonder why I am exposing
so much of myself?

430
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:58,219
I forget what I see very easily.

431
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,095
But then, why are you?

432
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:05,226
I'm hoping you'll join us,
represent us in the United States.

433
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:10,603
I'm beginning to understand the thing
with the tournament. The whole setup.

434
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,509
It's a great way to recruit new talent.

435
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,454
And who are they?

436
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:26,118
The refuse found in waterfront bars.

437
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,912
Shanghaied?

438
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,293
Just lost, drunken men...

439
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,756
who no longer care
where they find themselves each morning.

440
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:47,143
You left some rather sizable debts in America.

441
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:50,851
Diners Club hasn't called in my card yet.

442
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:59,659
Oh, sh--

443
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:06,662
There were some questions
which I was forced to ask.

444
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:09,123
I got no answers.

445
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,690
And you want me to join this?

446
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:34,018
There are certain realities.

447
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:38,531
I want us to have a clear understanding.

448
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,457
No.

449
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:56,208
There's no misunderstanding between us.

450
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:11,677
Help me. Help, I'm 17!

451
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:15,810
I'm from California.
Help me! Please, help me!

452
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:19,942
Mister, come back, please!
You have to come back. Please!

453
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:25,357
- Help me! Help me!
- Hey, quiet! Shut up!

454
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,713
The battle with the guards was magnificent.

455
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,430
Your skill is extraordinary.

456
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,055
And I was going to ask you to join us.

457
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:51,451
My God. This came in half an hour ago.
Why didn't I--?

458
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:54,996
Hello. Put your colonel on.

459
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,748
Well, wake him up.

460
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:02,382
I don't care if he's not alone.

461
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:08,718
Damn it all, I don't care who he's with!
You bloody well put him on the line!

462
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:39,124
Good morning, Mr. Roper.
We have been waiting for you.

463
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,466
What's going on?

464
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:45,926
Would you be good enough to participate
in this morning's edification?

465
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,510
Edification.

466
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,272
What are you gonna do to him?

467
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:58,813
Not me, Mr. Roper. You.

468
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,443
Bolo?

469
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:43,562
Like you said...

470
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,361
there's a point I won't go beyond.

471
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,864
I was right about you.

472
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:53,368
We shall strive to be worthy
of your sense of grandeur.

473
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,997
I will find someone
with whom you can fight.

474
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,660
Bolo.

475
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:20,845
Quick, go destroy them. Kill!

476
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,801
Kill them!

477
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:00,885
Kill! Fools!

478
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:54,233
You have offended my family
and you have offended a Shaolin temple.

479
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:25,021
<i>Remember...</i>

480
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:28,309
<i>the enemy has only images and illusions...</i>

481
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:32,775
<i>behind which he hides his true motives.</i>

482
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:38,285
<i>Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.</i>

483
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:30,091
