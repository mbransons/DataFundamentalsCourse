1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:37,767
We should have
stayed in paris.

3
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,033
That's where
we belong.

4
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,000
I was born here. I have
every right to come here.

5
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,534
They'll make
you trouble

6
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,501
like they did
for your mama.

7
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:47,200
I'll make
them trouble.

8
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:48,434
Crazy talk.

9
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,434
Change your mind,
miss clio.

10
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,734
We'll go directly to mama's
house on rampart street-

11
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,133
my house now.

12
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:00,834
Charcoal, charcoal

13
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,300
my mule is white

14
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,434
my charcoal is black

15
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,234
i'll sell my charcoal

16
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,000
two bits a sack

17
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:14,801
charcoal, charcoal

18
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,901
charcoal

19
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,033
let's go...

20
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,734
and come back
some other time.

21
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,167
Ghosts in there.

22
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,467
If there is,
it's my father's,

23
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:10,200
and i'd like to see him.

24
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,534
Poor mama.

25
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,767
Her beautiful
garden-

26
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,267
mimosa, camellias,
and crape myrtle.

27
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:52,367
That's the kitchen

28
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:56,200
and upstairs where
cupidon and i lived.

29
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:58,467
Often your papa and mama

30
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,467
had dinner in the garden.

31
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,467
He loved his fine food.

32
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,701
It was so beautiful
in the moonlight.

33
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,567
And the little house?

34
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,467
The garconniere.

35
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:12,968
Remember, i told you
your papa was sure, sure

36
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,000
you were gonna be a boy,

37
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,968
so he built it for you

38
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,467
to live in
with your nurse,

39
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:21,968
like all the other fine
families in new orleans.

40
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,501
He must have been
disappointed with me.

41
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,467
He just turned it
into a stable,

42
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:27,501
but he loved you, baby.

43
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,501
He'd toss you in the air

44
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,200
and call you his little,
small angel.

45
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:42,767
Honey, baby,
don't go in.

46
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:44,567
Hysterical.
Slap her-hard.

47
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,200
Don't, cherie.

48
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,701
Ah!

49
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:01,200
Thank you,
angelique.

50
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,133
I'm all right now.

51
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:11,167
It was that sofa
with one leg off.

52
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,968
It looks so crazy

53
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,968
and frowzy and dirty,

54
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,968
just like that old woman

55
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,968
who used to limp along
the quay in paris

56
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:22,367
selling fish.

57
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:24,501
My poor, dead,
darling baby.

58
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,501
You should have seen her

59
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:29,968
as she sat on it
in her silks and jewels.

60
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,968
It was right there
that lawyer, mr. Osie,

61
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:36,467
told her your papa had been
forced to marry

62
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:39,234
with one of those high-up
aristocrat like himself.

63
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,467
My little rita,
she don't believe.

64
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,000
She hope he marry
with her.

65
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:47,467
They always hope-
ladies like her.

66
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:50,501
But it never happens,
oh, no.

67
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,434
Didn't my father
tell her?

68
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:55,434
Did he leave it
to his lawyer?

69
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:58,467
He come as soon
as he could,

70
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:02,467
but that was a very
bad thing that he come.

71
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,467
Very, very bad.

72
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:08,167
Light up there!

73
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,167
Don't go up there.
Do you hear me?

74
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,434
My father's blood.

75
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,968
I saw it spurting

76
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:34,000
like the fountains
of the seine.

77
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:36,000
And your mama kneeling
there screaming.

78
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,000
Shh!

79
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,501
Let him be.
I want to hear it.

80
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:42,000
She was trying to
kill herself, your mama.

81
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,000
He grabbed the gun,
that poor boy.

82
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,968
They said
she murdered him.

83
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,467
They sent her away.

84
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,968
She meant that
to be her blood.

85
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:52,167
Don't touch it.

86
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:57,367
My father's blood,

87
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:58,901
my blood.

88
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,167
They are the same.

89
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,701
I love it-
this spot.

90
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,467
I'll sleep here
tonight-

91
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,200
in this room.

92
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,467
No.

93
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:18,200
Tonight
and every night.

94
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,934
I'm going to fix
this house

95
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,467
and live in it.

96
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:24,934
I'll show them,

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,133
these pasty-faced
aristocrats.

98
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,667
I am not my mother,

99
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,701
to be sent away
and turned into

100
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,334
an ugly,
broken-hearted woman

101
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,167
and made an exile
even after she was dead.

102
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:38,767
Let them find out there's
someone in rampart street now

103
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,801
who's not
afraid of them.

104
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,000
Clio dulaine, that's me.

105
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm as good as they are.

106
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm better than they are.

107
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,968
I'll be richer than they.

108
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll be grander
than they.

109
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,567
I shall marry and be very
rich and respectable,

110
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,934
not like mama.

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
Oh, nonsense.

112
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:59,434
You'll be a fool about men
just like your poor mama

113
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,100
and your grandma vaudray and
your great-grandma bonavie.

114
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,133
I won't,
i tell you.

115
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,601
Men will be fools
about me.

116
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,033
Your mama was a plaise.

117
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,434
All she knew
was to please a man.

118
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:09,601
Your grandma was a-

119
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:10,734
i'm a dulaine.

120
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,701
My father was
nicholas dulaine.

121
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:14,767
My life will be
different.

122
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,968
I will have fun and
i will have money.

123
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:17,968
Horses and
a carriage!

124
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:18,968
And jewels
by the quarts

125
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,934
and fine clothes
and anything i want!

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,300
How are you
gonna get those?

127
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,467
With the money of
my very rich husband.

128
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:26,434
And where's he?

129
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:28,200
I'll meet him.

130
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:33,934
And everything
they did to my mama

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,467
i'll do back to them-
every little thing.

132
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:40,467
I'll do it twice.

133
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:42,501
Do all that
for your mama?

134
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,467
That's good.

135
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:46,367
Well, partly
i'll do it for mama.

136
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:49,200
Partly
i'll do it for me.

137
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
Chimney sweep

138
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:58,634
ladies, i know why
the old chimney won't draw.

139
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,968
Don't want to bake

140
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,367
and you can't make
no cake

141
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:09,667
and i know why
your chimney won't draw

142
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,000
chimney sweep

143
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:14,567
chimney sweep.

144
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:17,801
Chimney sweep

145
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,234
chimney sweep

146
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:25,100
chimney sweep!

147
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,067
Hey, shorty,

148
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:30,000
do you come from france, like they say?

149
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:32,000
I come from
new orleans.

150
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,534
Not like you, congo.

151
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,701
Is you going
to stay here?

152
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,534
What you think,

153
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,734
we're carpetbaggers
like you?

154
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,968
Now i know
what mama meant.

155
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,501
You remember,
she used to say

156
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,467
there was an old
louisiana proverb-

157
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,501
"give a creole
a crystal chandelier

158
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:03,501
"and two mirrors
to reflect it,

159
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,000
and he is satisfied."

160
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,501
I got the chandelier,

161
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,467
and i've got two mirrors,

162
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,000
but i'm not satisfied.

163
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,501
Who's creole
here?

164
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,501
I am.

165
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:13,968
I am creole.

166
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,501
Take shame
on yourself,

167
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:16,968
denying your
own mama.

168
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't you dare.
That's a lie.

169
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,000
Angelique buiton,
you listen to me,

170
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,501
and you, too, cupidon.

171
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,634
Do you want to stay with me?

172
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:26,033
Where else?

173
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,534
Well, then remember, no matter
what i say i am, that i am.

174
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,534
I don't want
to hear any more

175
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:34,534
of this telling me who
i am and what i am to do.

176
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:36,467
Do as i say,
and we'll be rich.

177
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:38,100
Which do you choose?
Stay or go?

178
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,734
Stay.

179
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:46,734
Playacting, just like
her great-grandma.

180
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:27,501
Where are we going
all dressed up?

181
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,868
First we'll go to
the french market.

182
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,400
We'll buy everything,
everything delicious.

183
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,901
Shrimps?
And soft-shell crab?

184
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,000
Then the saint louis
cathedral,

185
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:37,167
then madame begue's
for breakfast.

186
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,100
Those dulaines eat there.

187
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,133
I know. Mama said
they sometimes did

188
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,567
on sunday mornings.

189
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:44,067
Always. I found out.

190
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,934
They go to church, too.
I found out everything.

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,033
Good, cupid.

192
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,267
Now we fix those dulaines.

193
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,968
You wouldn't
do that?

194
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,901
Oh, wouldn't i?

195
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,367
Angelique, do you think
they'll recognize me?

196
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:59,400
Do i look
enough like mama?

197
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:00,968
Not half so beautiful.

198
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,701
Young scrawny like you.

199
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,901
Hah, an old crow
like you.

200
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:06,734
Perhaps it will be
just as well

201
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,167
if at first
they're not sure.

202
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:09,701
Perhaps
i'll not even

203
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,734
use my name of
dulaine at first.

204
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,634
You sure those police
ain't after you?

205
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:15,501
I'll be a...
who shall i be?

206
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:16,901
You're acting just
like your grandma.

207
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:18,033
I'll be
a comtesse.

208
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,000
I am la comtesse de
trignonai du chenfrais.

209
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,000
And i'm the queen
of spain.

210
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,667
And i'm the
emperor napoleon.

211
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:29,968
Boo!

212
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:35,167
Blackberries

213
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:38,534
fresh and fine

214
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,534
i got blackberries, ladies.

215
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:43,267
Fresh from the vine.

216
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:47,501
I got blackberries

217
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:50,501
america
is lovely.

218
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,167
It's swell
and lovely.

219
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:59,167
Mmm.

220
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:03,701
Ah.

221
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:24,467
Boo!

222
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:34,501
Are they here?

223
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,000
Do you see them?

224
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,467
No. Not yet.

225
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:40,000
Are you sure?

226
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:43,067
No, i could not
forget them.

227
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:49,767
Merci.

228
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:59,167
Lady, can i
dance for you?

229
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:17,801
Thank you, ma'am.

230
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:27,367
Oh, what a heavenly smell.

231
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,000
Jambalaya.

232
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:34,968
Jambalaya-

233
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,000
that mama wished for
in paris

234
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:38,501
and couldn't get?

235
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, i want some.

236
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, heavy stuff, you'll ruin
your breakfast at begue's.

237
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,000
You know i have the
appetite of a dock worker.

238
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,467
Quick cupid,
tell the man

239
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,133
a heaping plate for madame la comtesse.

240
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,834
For who?
You heard!

241
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:52,067
For madame la comtesse.
Who else, stupid?

242
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:55,501
Hey, you.

243
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,934
A dish of this stuff
for madame la comtesse.

244
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,968
For whom?

245
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,200
For madame la comtesse.
Who else?

246
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,467
But certainly.

247
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,667
Certainement.

248
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,367
Is it as good as
they've told me in france?

249
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:12,667
I await your judgment.

250
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:40,400
Mmm.

251
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,334
Delicieux.

252
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Delicious.

253
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:48,534
Mmm.

254
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:50,267
Excellent.

255
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:52,267
Wonderful.

256
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:57,934
Madame la comtesse

257
00:16:58,033 --> 00:16:59,968
says the dish is delicious.

258
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,467
It is more delicious

259
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,801
than anything
she has eaten in paris.

260
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:12,234
Hash. Phooey.

261
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:20,834
Ah, tres bien. Bravo,
madame la comtesse.

262
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,200
Bravo.

263
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:00,934
You're so quiet
all at once, eh?

264
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,400
Now what's
happened?

265
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:03,434
Hmm?

266
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,868
Don't pretend
innocent with me.

267
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,534
I see the look
in your eye.

268
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:07,968
Don't you try
fooling with-

269
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,968
stop nudging me,
you wicked old woman.

270
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,934
I'm not a child.
I'll go when i please.

271
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,667
I see him, that big lug
leaning there, that texas.

272
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:15,634
You going to
the cathedral,

273
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:17,634
and it should be
for confession.

274
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:19,667
Of course, angelique. Cupidon,
take the marketing home.

275
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,968
Stay with us
until we're safe.

276
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,334
Do whatever will please
the old crow.

277
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,968
Oh, what a lovely
chou- fleur.

278
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,434
Still there.

279
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,901
Who, angelique? Who?

280
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:33,367
"Who, angelique?
Who, angelique!"

281
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:35,901
You and your cauliflower head
- you're two of a kind.

282
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:37,968
We'll now go
to the cathedral.

283
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,000
Cupidon, go home
with your basket

284
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,000
and meet us later
at begue's.

285
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,667
We'll ride.

286
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:49,300
I'm tired. It's hot.
I'm hungry.

287
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,501
Yes, ma'am.

288
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:54,934
Nice time for a ride
out to the lake.

289
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,667
Ma'am.

290
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:01,901
I hate to see anybody
as plum beautiful as you

291
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:04,901
riding in a moth-eaten
old basket like this,

292
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:07,434
let alone those two nags
a- pullin' it.

293
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:10,067
If you'll do me the honor
of riding in my carriage...

294
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,601
i'm driving a pair of
long-tailed bays to the runabout.

295
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,033
Brought them
all the way from texas,

296
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,467
and they're beauties, and
they're thoroughbreds, just like-

297
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:17,968
well, that sounds terrible,

298
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:21,467
but i don't mean to
compare you, ma'am, to a-

299
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:24,467
but if you'll allow me,
ma'am, l-

300
00:19:32,534 --> 00:19:36,300
i'll, uh, i'll set down
this cup of coffee.

301
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:39,400
I ain't gonna let you
do it. Do you hear me?

302
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,467
I ain't gonna
let you do it.

303
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:42,968
Beautiful.

304
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:49,467
I think he's beautiful.

305
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:05,300
Ah! I'll
punish him.

306
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:06,567
Allez. Vite, vite.

307
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:08,133
I'll take him and lock
him up with the savages.

308
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,968
I'll lock him up
on bread and water.

309
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,501
So madame la comtesse

310
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,968
enjoys talking
to loutish cowboys?

311
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,667
I didn't talk to him.
He talked to me.

312
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:15,634
Even your aunt bess-

313
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:16,767
shut up! Do you
want me to slap you

314
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:17,834
right here
on the street?

315
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:19,000
I wish
i could die now.

316
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,267
Your mama made me promise
to take care of you,

317
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:22,801
but it's no use.
Common, common dirt!

318
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:24,100
Ah, shh.

319
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,000
If you please, pay
attention to your prayers,

320
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:42,033
not to someone
who ain't there.

321
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,534
I'm only looking
for those dulaines.

322
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:49,267
The dulaines don't wear 90-gallon hats.

323
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,501
Here we is, ladies-

324
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,000
the famous begue's.

325
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:58,501
All the quality eats here.
Whoa.

326
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,834
What are you
dressed up coachman for?

327
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:03,067
You look like
a monkey on a string.

328
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,067
We got horses,
haven't we?

329
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:08,067
Packed some of my paris
stuff from home.

330
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,200
I'll fix up these
nags yet.

331
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,501
Splendid, cupidon.

332
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll tell you what, it's
too late for begue's-

333
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,968
oh, no. We ain't
gonna drive around

334
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,000
to be seen and followed
by that texas.

335
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,000
Wait here.

336
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,801
Pay the man
and come on, cupid.

337
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:22,934
And if a cowboy in
a white hat comes along,

338
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,033
we ain't here.

339
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,367
It would
serve you right

340
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:26,634
if he had cupidon brought
into court as a billy goat.

341
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,200
Not for him-courtrooms.

342
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,701
I know the looks.

343
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,734
Probably wanted
in texas himself

344
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:33,734
and skipped out with
somebody's carriage and horses.

345
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:35,701
Oh, angelique, don't
let's quarrel anymore.

346
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:38,234
I meant it to be
such a happy day.

347
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,501
All right, baby,
we don't quarrel,

348
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:42,267
but just you keep your mind
on what you came out for.

349
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,767
And remember,
20 years ago,

350
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,267
your mama walked in here
like a queen.

351
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,200
Bonjour, madame-

352
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:07,000
but... no.

353
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:10,000
For a moment i thought
you were-

354
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:12,000
but, of course,
it isn't possible.

355
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:14,968
I've heard my mother speak
of you often, monsieur begue.

356
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,000
They say i resemble her.

357
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,067
I'm la comtesse de trignonai
du chenfrais.

358
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:20,000
Of course.
Of course.

359
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:22,868
This way,
if you please.

360
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,206
Oh, i am so sorry, madame.

361
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:43,167
This table is reserved

362
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:45,534
every sunday morning
for the family of dulaine.

363
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,033
Splendid.
They'd be delighted.

364
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,734
A relative,
you know.

365
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:56,968
I want everything that
you're famous for-

366
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,467
you and madame begue.

367
00:22:58,534 --> 00:22:59,968
All the delicious things

368
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:02,434
mama used to describe
to me in paris.

369
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:04,467
She spoke of my food
in paris?

370
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:06,968
Ah. Leon.

371
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,501
May i suggest,
perhaps,

372
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:13,400
madame begue's
renowned crawfish bisque?

373
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh, mais non.

374
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,634
Enchante.

375
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:26,434
C'est magnifique.
C'est delicieux.

376
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:28,367
Je prepare everything
with my own hands

377
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:31,467
pour vous,
madame la comtesse.

378
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,734
Is it?

379
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:44,767
Cupidon, my fan.

380
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:48,534
Bonjour, madame begue.
We are late.

381
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,734
I trust everything
isn't gone.

382
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:53,467
Don't stare, ninnies.

383
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:56,701
Will they recognize me,
do you think?

384
00:23:57,534 --> 00:23:58,901
Shall i speak to them?

385
00:23:58,968 --> 00:24:00,968
Shall i say to that girl,

386
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:02,367
"hello, sister"?

387
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:03,868
She's my half sister.

388
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:05,334
Ah, madame dulaine.

389
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,667
Bonjour.
Bonjour, madame.

390
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:19,934
But she said, ah,
she's a relative.

391
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:27,501
But she
said that-

392
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,534
who's that
at our table, mama?

393
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,968
What are
they doing?

394
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,033
Leaving.

395
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,868
Keep quiet.

396
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,567
Come.
We will go.

397
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,567
Stay where you are.
I'm not leaving.

398
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:52,934
First folks in a hurry
i've seen in new orleans.

399
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,601
Is this begue's?

400
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,167
It was begue's.

401
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:04,367
Is he coming?

402
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:05,834
Going right by.

403
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,534
Not looking,
either.

404
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:11,667
Hey, cookie.

405
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:17,434
Now, while he
ain't looking,

406
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:18,467
come, baby.

407
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm not nearly finished.

408
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:21,968
I'm going to have
an omelet souffle,

409
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:24,267
and after that some
strawberries with thick cream.

410
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah, burst your corset.
Stuff yourself.

411
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,667
With a figure
like a cow,

412
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,501
you'll get yourself
a fine husband. Oh, yes.

413
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,300
Or maybe you've already
picked that texas vache.

414
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,334
He's used to
bulging sides.

415
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
Texas, texas. What do
i care where he's from?

416
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,300
I'm not even
looking at him.

417
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:38,968
Well, do look,
then.

418
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,667
Can't read
the menu even.

419
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:42,334
What's all
this stuff?

420
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,901
Where i come from,

421
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:45,868
we write our menus
in american.

422
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:47,467
Beef and beans-

423
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:49,501
that's what
he's used to.

424
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:51,267
Even leon
is amused.

425
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:54,667
Kind of steamy
here in new orleans.

426
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:55,968
Oui, monsieur.

427
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,968
If he were mine,

428
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,968
i would have for him

429
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:06,968
four-dozen
white handkerchiefs

430
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,968
of the finest linen,

431
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:11,334
and you would
embroider his initials

432
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,367
in the most
delicate scrolls.

433
00:26:13,434 --> 00:26:14,367
Me?

434
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:15,968
Embroider
for that cowboy?

435
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,434
He's never even seen

436
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,567
a white linen
handkerchief.

437
00:26:18,634 --> 00:26:21,701
And linen, too,
for his shirts, i think.

438
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:26,167
Fine pleated linen.

439
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,968
And his initials
on them, too.

440
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:31,000
Initials. Initials.
What initials?

441
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:34,667
His initials,
whatever they are.

442
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:37,100
I don't know what the
devil those rognons are,

443
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:38,100
but i'll take a chance.

444
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:39,133
Oui, monsieur.

445
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,067
They say everything here
is lickin' good.

446
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,467
Psst.

447
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,100
Now what are you
gonna you do?

448
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:54,367
Leon, tell monsieur
seated over there-

449
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:56,934
the gentleman with
the big hat and boots-

450
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,467
if he's having difficulty
in choosing his breakfast,

451
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,968
i'll be happy
to assist him.

452
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:04,968
Ask him if he wouldn't perhaps
prefer to be served at my table.

453
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,467
We're old friends.

454
00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:07,968
Quickly.

455
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:09,467
Common.
Common as dirt.

456
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:13,901
Keep quiet, angelique, or i'll
send you away somewhere to starve.

457
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:28,968
Fellow over there
told me that you said-

458
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,667
won't you sit down?

459
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:33,501
Angelique,
wait in the hall.

460
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,501
Cupidon, bring
the gentleman's hat

461
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:37,000
from the other table.

462
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:39,000
Then you wait
in the hall, too.

463
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:41,501
Say, thanks.
Back where i come from,

464
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:44,868
we kind of like to
stay close to our hats

465
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:46,534
on account of not knowing

466
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:50,267
when we might have to pull
out of a place right quick.

467
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,601
Forgive me, but you look
so big sitting there.

468
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,567
As far as that goes,

469
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:05,634
you look kind of
funny yourself, ma'am,

470
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:08,167
with that white stuff
on your face.

471
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:19,467
Voila, madame.

472
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:20,467
Oh, wonderful.

473
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:21,968
Please serve
monsieur, too.

474
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,701
Oh, i see.

475
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:31,868
I don't know what
we're laughing at,

476
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:34,834
but i haven't had
as much fun in a coon's age.

477
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:36,133
Down in texas,

478
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,467
they told me people were
standoffish in new orleens.

479
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:39,567
New orleans.

480
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:43,534
Fixing to learn me
the english language?

481
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:44,667
Teach.

482
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:53,467
There.

483
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:55,934
This is the famous
ragout du rognons,

484
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,634
especially prepared by
monsieur begue's own hands.

485
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,601
Have you got any ketchup?

486
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:05,934
Ketchup.

487
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,901
In paris now, everything
is eaten with ketchup.

488
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:11,934
It's the chic thing
for dinner in paris.

489
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,667
Ketchup
for monsieur.

490
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:24,400
Ha ha ha!

491
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,968
And when
they brought you

492
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,467
monsieur begue's
ragout de rognons

493
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,934
with a sauce prepared for days and days

494
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,467
by monsieur begue's
own magical hands,

495
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:32,968
you ask for ketchup!

496
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:36,801
Ha ha ha!

497
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,968
Frenchy, i can't
figure you out.

498
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,000
Is that why you
whip your horses?

499
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:49,000
Besides, i'm not french. I'm american.

500
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:51,000
I was brought up
in france.

501
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:52,968
I'm la comtesse de
trignonai du chenfrais.

502
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh, you don't say?

503
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:56,467
Well, honey,
just to prove

504
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,000
i'm playing square
with you,

505
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,434
i'll tell you
my real name.

506
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,000
Clint maroon.

507
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,467
Now tell me yours.

508
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,968
Clint maroon. Do you
hear that, angelique?

509
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,334
The initials are c.m.

510
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,200
Whoa.

511
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:28,033
Won't you come in?

512
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:32,834
Hey, what kind of a
game is this, anyway?

513
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,434
Look, honey,
i was born in texas,

514
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,033
but it wasn't
yesterday.

515
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:41,467
I told you.

516
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:49,534
Hey, hold on.

517
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,400
There's no cause
of getting riled.

518
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:28,534
He ain't there.

519
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:29,534
Who isn't?

520
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:31,033
You know who.

521
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,033
He's been there
every day for a week

522
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,534
pawing the ground
worse than his horses,

523
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:37,033
but he ain't there today.

524
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,300
Go away someplace.

525
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:39,534
I will.

526
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:41,033
Go, then!

527
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,033
I'm going. I'd like
to go to paris, france.

528
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,501
You have
my permission.

529
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:47,033
I'd like to see
voodoo woman.

530
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,133
I'd spell that cowboy
into more trouble

531
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,501
than he ever
dreamed of!

532
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,667
Shame!

533
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,501
Cupidon?

534
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:02,701
Huh?

535
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:09,968
What you want?

536
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,667
Like some cake?

537
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:16,200
Baba au rum,
make it fresh today.

538
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,267
Like another piece?

539
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:30,734
You want something.

540
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,234
Tomorrow i fix you
creme brulee

541
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,767
or le ta de mer
a la creme.

542
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,767
You do want something.

543
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,033
I find letter today
in the hall.

544
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,534
I guess must be there
many years hiding itself.

545
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:49,033
What's it say?

546
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,734
Read it.

547
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:53,234
Heh heh heh!

548
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,767
Why you tear that?

549
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:57,300
What does it say?

550
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,501
I like that big cowboy
from texas.

551
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:16,000
He is a beautiful-
to know about horses-

552
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:20,033
yesterday i heard he won
$1,000 at the racetrack.

553
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,033
At night, he gambles
on royal street.

554
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,400
At number 18,
they say never loses.

555
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:26,767
Have you
been talking?

556
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:29,701
No, but i just might.

557
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,934
Ha ha ha!

558
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,767
What does it say,
you macaque, you?

559
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:52,934
Crazy about her.

560
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,267
Going to bust
the house down.

561
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:55,767
I knew it.

562
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,968
Only bad happens to us
in new orleans.

563
00:33:58,033 --> 00:33:59,267
What do you know?

564
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:00,968
This is fine
here in america.

565
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:03,100
Don't you bother your head
about little clio.

566
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,434
She knows her way about.

567
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:08,434
Anyway, i'm sick of
only women in the house.

568
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:10,100
Man around,
suit me fine.

569
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:11,634
Oh, you little...

570
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,767
you going out?

571
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:21,467
I didn't come
to new orleans

572
00:34:21,534 --> 00:34:23,467
to sit in
dignified seclusion

573
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:24,968
in my house.

574
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:26,467
I'm going...

575
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:27,734
i'm going
to church.

576
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:29,567
Why?

577
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,734
Because it's sunday.

578
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:38,234
What are you
grinning at?

579
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:46,400
La la la la la

580
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,934
what kind of language is that?

581
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,467
Gumbo, cherl-

582
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:30,033
new orleans french
flavored with african.

583
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,267
What does that say
in american?

584
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:37,234
If you was a bird,
suzette

585
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,601
and i was
a gun martinet

586
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,634
i will shoot
you down, sure

587
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:43,467
i will
shoot you dead

588
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:46,968
oh, my dear
mahogany jewel.

589
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:48,501
I love you.

590
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:53,300
I love you like
a pig love the mud.

591
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:54,367
And i will
shoot you dead

592
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:57,567
da dee da la

593
00:37:57,634 --> 00:37:59,901
da da da da da da

594
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:02,067
la la la la la

595
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:04,534
mm mm mm da da

596
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:33,467
a house isn't a house
unless it has about it

597
00:38:33,534 --> 00:38:35,467
the scent
of a good cigar.

598
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:36,968
Where'd you hear that?
Where?

599
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:39,501
Mama used to say that,
poor darling.

600
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,000
Oh, she did, huh?

601
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,501
Look, this stuff
you've been telling me-

602
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:43,968
is it true?

603
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:46,968
I don't mean that stuff
about being a countess.

604
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,801
I mean... well, sometimes
you talk like a schoolgirl-

605
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,133
ask angelique.
Ask cupidon.

606
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,934
Those two? They'd lie
for you no matter what.

607
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,434
Well, if you think
i'm lying,

608
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:55,934
angelique is lying,
cupidon is lying,

609
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,367
why don't you go back

610
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:59,934
to that little lady in texas
you always been talking about?

611
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,934
The one who made you
that white satin tie

612
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,434
embroidered with
blue forget-me-nots.

613
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:04,934
What's the matter with that
tie? You're not jealous, are you?

614
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,434
It's terrible.
Tell me about her-

615
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:08,434
the finest little lady
in the world.

616
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,367
Blue eyes, you said,
and golden hair,

617
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,901
and so little, she
only comes up to there.

618
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:14,434
How nice.

619
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:16,434
When are you going
to marry, you two?

620
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:17,934
I don't aim
to marry anybody.

621
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,100
I go it alone, and i'm out for big game.

622
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,501
I'll marry.

623
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,334
I'll marry a husband very,
very rich and very respectable.

624
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,968
I'll be the best man
at your wedding.

625
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,400
Why not?

626
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,901
No, you'll be
far too handsome.

627
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,901
All the guests
would wonder

628
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:33,868
why i hadn't
married you.

629
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:35,968
Very, very rich
and respectable men

630
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:37,434
are so rarely
handsome.

631
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:39,000
Then, one can't
have everything.

632
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:42,000
Where i come from,
women are two kinds.

633
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:43,968
They're good
or they're bad.

634
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:46,400
What kind of a woman
are you?

635
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,968
Well...

636
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,267
on my father's side,
i'm very, very good-

637
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:54,267
prim, you might say,
and very respectable.

638
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:56,501
On my mother's side,
i'm...

639
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:59,968
how shall i say that
for your tender ears?

640
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:06,000
Sometimes i'm mama, who gave
everything for love...

641
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:07,701
sometimes i'm
my grandmama vaudray,

642
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,167
who gave everything,
too,

643
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:10,567
but not for love.

644
00:40:10,634 --> 00:40:12,701
And sometimes i'm my
great-grandmama bonavie,

645
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,634
who was an actress.

646
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:17,000
Shucks, that's it. I keep
forgetting you're just a little girl

647
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:18,501
dressed up in your
ma's long skirts.

648
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:21,534
No. No, i'm not.
I'm very grown-up,

649
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:24,100
and i'm going to fool
the world.

650
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:27,300
Oh, you don't say?

651
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:29,968
What am i doing getting
hooked up with you?

652
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:31,667
That's what i
can't figure out.

653
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,701
What am i doing
in a house like this,

654
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,767
la-de-daing around?

655
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:48,000
Funny, the trouble
you can get into

656
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:51,033
just by talking to
somebody on the street,

657
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,467
not meaning
anything serious.

658
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,467
High time i cleared
out of here.

659
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:56,467
Leave new orleans?
Where would you go?

660
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,000
Up north.

661
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:01,501
Hadn't been for you, i'd
be out of here before now.

662
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:03,467
Too soft and pretty
around here for me.

663
00:41:03,534 --> 00:41:05,000
Two or three weeks here,

664
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:06,701
and i was headed
for kansas city and chicago.

665
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,033
Oh, why, clint?

666
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,968
Gambling. I told you that's
how i picked up a little.

667
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:13,100
Then further north to
saratoga for the races.

668
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,501
Saratoga?

669
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,667
Is that a nice place?

670
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:19,100
July and august,

671
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:22,400
no place like it in the
whole world, they tell me-

672
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:24,167
racing every day
and gambling.

673
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:26,033
Millionaires, pickpockets,
sporting people,

674
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,734
politicians, respectable family folks,

675
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:29,734
famous theater actors
and actresses-

676
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:32,200
you'll find them all
in saratoga.

677
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:34,467
Say, why don't you
come along?

678
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,033
Later, maybe.

679
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,534
Why not now?
What's to keep you?

680
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:40,200
Mama.

681
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:47,501
Hey, you look
downright wicked.

682
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:50,501
Not wicked, clint.
Practical.

683
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:54,501
What are you setting in that
steel-trap mind of yours?

684
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:57,467
What?

685
00:41:57,534 --> 00:41:59,434
I've sent cupidon
all through town.

686
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:01,000
He's listened
and learned.

687
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:03,501
He can find out
anything, that one-

688
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:04,934
all the gossip,
all the scandal.

689
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,467
There is
this daughter.

690
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:07,934
Daughter?
What daughter?

691
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,501
Charlotte terese,
she is called-

692
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:11,100
the daughter
of my father,

693
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:13,968
nicholas dulaine, and his
wife. She's 17 and creole.

694
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,000
Creole?

695
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:16,467
New orleans
aristocracy-

696
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,901
french
and spanish blood.

697
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,501
She's going to be introduced
into society next winter.

698
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:22,968
All very formal
and proper, you see.

699
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:26,167
It's not so proper if there pops
up more scandal in the family.

700
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:27,367
Hold on.

701
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:28,901
You're not fixing to
try blackmail, are you?

702
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:30,501
Oh, clint, how can you say such a thing?

703
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:33,400
If you are, i'll chuck you
and those two freaks so fast-

704
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,000
oh, no, no, no, clint.
You wouldn't do that.

705
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:36,033
Why wouldn't i?

706
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,367
You wouldn't like
people to say,

707
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:39,434
"what has happened
to the handsome texan

708
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:41,534
that went everywhere with
that beautiful creature?"

709
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,000
Oh, clint,
i'm so happy, clint.

710
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:44,501
Say that again.

711
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm so happy, clint.

712
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:48,534
"Cleent." why don't
you talk american?

713
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:50,033
I'm so happy,
clint.

714
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,033
I love to hear
your voice.

715
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,734
It goes over me like
oil over a blister.

716
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:56,968
Womenfolks back home
are mighty fine-

717
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,334
they don't come
any finer-

718
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,868
but they kind of got
screechy voices.

719
00:43:00,934 --> 00:43:03,334
Your voice kind of
puts me in mind

720
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,467
of a texas sky
at night...

721
00:43:05,534 --> 00:43:07,234
soft and perfect.

722
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:14,000
What am i mixed up
with you for?

723
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:16,667
Look, what do you
want out of me?

724
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:19,133
You got me roped, tied, and
branded. Me, clint maroon.

725
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,067
The folks back home
would die laughing.

726
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:22,934
I'll be wearing ruffles
on my pants next.

727
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,300
I adore you
when you're angry.

728
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:25,667
I've seen lots
of women,

729
00:43:25,734 --> 00:43:27,300
but i've never seen a
woman like you before.

730
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:29,801
There isn't anyone
like me, clint.

731
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:32,868
Go get your duds on.
We're going for a drive.

732
00:43:37,567 --> 00:43:40,267
I ought to drag it
out of you.

733
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:55,167
Bonjour,
monsieur!

734
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:57,133
Hook up the team,
cupidon.

735
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,100
We're going
for a drive.

736
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:00,367
Oui, oui, boss.
Pronto!

737
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:01,868
Son of a gun!

738
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,834
I learned to talk
like a true cowboy.

739
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:05,801
You talk like nothing
i ever heard.

740
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:25,000
You ain't got one
kind thought for me,

741
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:27,501
have you, now, mammy?
You know, it's funny,

742
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:30,501
whenever i meet up
with somebody i don't like

743
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:31,901
or don't like me,

744
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:34,000
either i get out
or they do...

745
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:35,501
and i'm staying.

746
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,501
I don't parlez-vous
that stuff,

747
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:42,501
but i kind of catch on

748
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:44,701
you're not paying me
any compliments.

749
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:50,968
Holding you
the way i am, mammy,

750
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:52,200
i could crack
your backbone

751
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:53,834
just like
you'd split a fish.

752
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:55,934
You'd never be able
to walk or talk again,

753
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,200
and nobody'd know
i done it.

754
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:01,968
Shucks. I don't
want to hurt you,

755
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,834
but we're going to be
friends, you and me.

756
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:06,067
Oh, yes, we are.
Now, listen.

757
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:08,434
Miss clio
- she's never had any fun.

758
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:10,467
Maybe you and me and
cupidon all together,

759
00:45:10,534 --> 00:45:12,968
we could fix it up
so she'd be happy.

760
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:16,033
I don't aim to hurt her.
I want to help her.

761
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:22,567
If it means she'll have
that rich husband

762
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:24,968
all comme il faut,
respectable?

763
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:26,467
Yeah.

764
00:45:26,534 --> 00:45:28,467
I guess that's
what i mean.

765
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:30,000
You sure?

766
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:31,434
Anything
that she wants.

767
00:45:33,534 --> 00:45:36,000
How'd you like me
to make you

768
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,467
one big pie
for dinner tonight?

769
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,901
That's great, mammy.

770
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:40,400
One thing i ask-

771
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:42,501
you do not
call me that.

772
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:44,000
What?
That-mammy.

773
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:46,968
It's one thing i hate
out of the slave days.

774
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:48,968
Me,
i'm angelique buiton.

775
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:19,601
Maybe it is vain of me,
darling,

776
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:21,667
but i like
to show you off.

777
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:27,501
Come away
from that window.

778
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:30,067
Mother, she just
drove by again.

779
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:31,634
Never mind, cherie.

780
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:33,100
Come practice
your piano.

781
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,701
Yes, mama.

782
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,467
Every day...

783
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:48,501
and if her carriage passing
by on the street were all.

784
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:51,968
The other night in a gambling
house on royal street.

785
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:54,901
Can you imagine a woman
in a gambling house?

786
00:46:54,968 --> 00:46:56,934
Cheap, like her mother
before her.

787
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,400
What is she after,
mama?

788
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:00,968
We can't step foot
out of our house

789
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:03,467
for fear of meeting her
face-to-face.

790
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:04,968
At the market,
at begue's,

791
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:06,467
even at the cathedral.

792
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:07,968
People staring,
talking.

793
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,968
I will not have you go
on your knees to her.

794
00:47:11,033 --> 00:47:13,968
Tonight i hesitate to occupy
our box at the french opera.

795
00:47:14,033 --> 00:47:15,467
Our own box!

796
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:39,534
That looks to me
like real bad manners.

797
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:41,734
It's the continental
custom, cheri.

798
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,901
There is charlotte.

799
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:07,634
Very plain.
Very dowdy.

800
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:10,701
That woman
down on rampart street.

801
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:13,000
Remember?

802
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:17,434
Must be 15 years ago.

803
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:21,434
She shot him.
Hushed up.

804
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:23,434
This is the daughter.

805
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:24,968
Paris.

806
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:50,467
You look very happy
this evening.

807
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:52,133
I am.

808
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:16,434
Honey, you're wearing out the carpet.

809
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:18,467
Why don't you
gentle down-

810
00:49:18,534 --> 00:49:20,467
quit snorting
and raring around?

811
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:22,367
Expecting somebody?

812
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:23,934
I always calm down.

813
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,467
Too much i've been handling
this charlotte, these dulaines,

814
00:49:27,534 --> 00:49:28,934
with kid gloves.

815
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,968
How's that?

816
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,968
Now i'll go after them
with bare hands.

817
00:49:33,033 --> 00:49:33,968
Cupidon? Cupidon?

818
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:35,334
Coming!

819
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,968
I want you to spread
the word all around town

820
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:42,067
that i'm turning this
place into a gambling house.

821
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:44,701
Let go of me!
You're hurting me!

822
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:48,000
Look, i've lived
a rough life.

823
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:50,100
I've come a far piece,
and i aim to go farther,

824
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:53,000
but you can't use me just
to muck up an old scandal.

825
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:54,033
Oh, clint!

826
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,467
I ought to break
every bone in your body.

827
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,501
It was just
an idea of mine.

828
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:57,567
You're right.
The idea is yours.

829
00:49:57,634 --> 00:49:58,901
The whole rotten
outfit's yours.

830
00:49:58,968 --> 00:50:00,100
You're using me.

831
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:02,067
Hitch up my team.
No-account french rat!

832
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:04,100
You can't talk to me
like that!

833
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,133
Who are you
- a big cowboy from texas,

834
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,200
and probably run out
as angelique said!

835
00:50:08,267 --> 00:50:10,534
Maybe i was, but it
wasn't for blackmail.

836
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:12,000
For something worse, then?
Maybe you killed somebody

837
00:50:12,067 --> 00:50:14,000
with those big guns you
carry around. Oh! Did you?

838
00:50:14,067 --> 00:50:15,033
Maybe i did-
two or three,

839
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,501
but it was decent,
honest killing.

840
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:18,067
It wasn't this dirty, behind-the-back
stuff. It was me or them.

841
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:19,100
They!

842
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,667
Aim to make a gentleman
out of me, hmm?

843
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:21,934
No, no, no,
you're perfect.

844
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,400
Sure you do. All women
want to make their man over.

845
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:26,467
You are not my man. You belong
to that little woman in texas.

846
00:50:26,534 --> 00:50:27,901
Don't be poking fun
at texas women.

847
00:50:27,968 --> 00:50:29,267
They could teach you
a thing or two.

848
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:30,434
Who could?

849
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:31,701
Any of them could. Take
my ma, for instance-

850
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:34,000
came all the way from
virginia with pa in a wagon.

851
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:35,334
Oh, how very
uncomfortable.

852
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,767
Shut up! Helped him pioneer
the land they lived on,

853
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,501
built it up with
their own bare hands,

854
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:42,033
and made things grow
until... till they lost it.

855
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,501
Lost it?
How, clint?

856
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:46,000
Railroad men, they call
themselves. Highbindin' crooks.

857
00:50:46,067 --> 00:50:48,033
They stole
pa's land from him

858
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,501
like he was a hick
at a country circus.

859
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:52,968
Almost broke his heart.

860
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:54,434
Said it wasn't
like america.

861
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:57,200
We got ideas about
america down there.

862
00:50:57,267 --> 00:51:00,000
Did they harm
your mama, too?

863
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:03,400
Poor clint, you must
make them pay.

864
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:05,934
What in sam hill do you
think i'm after doing?

865
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,968
I promised myself when i grew
up, if i ever met up with them-

866
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:09,300
then you should.

867
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:11,000
And i will. I'd as soon shoot them down

868
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,100
as i would
a cottonmouth.

869
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:13,367
You see, cheri,
we are two of a kind.

870
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:14,367
Us?

871
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:15,767
Yes. You heard your
mother and father

872
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:17,200
talking of the wrong
that was done them.

873
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:18,601
I heard my mother
talking the same way.

874
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:19,634
Your mother?

875
00:51:19,734 --> 00:51:21,033
Yes. She never
hurt a fly, clint.

876
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,000
Excuse me, honey, but if
shooting a man and killing him

877
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:24,467
ain't hurtin' him none...

878
00:51:24,534 --> 00:51:25,634
no, she didn't
kill him.

879
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:27,067
I know, i know.

880
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:28,534
She happened to have the gun,
and it was pointing at him,

881
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:29,868
the bullet went in him,
and he died.

882
00:51:29,934 --> 00:51:31,534
I tell you, no. If they
thought she was killing him,

883
00:51:31,601 --> 00:51:32,901
why did they keep
sending her money

884
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:34,033
all those years
in france?

885
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,968
That's called hush money
where i come from.

886
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:38,000
I don't care what it's
called where you come from!

887
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:40,501
I'm going to get back at
them for what they did to her.

888
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,033
They can't stop me! You can't
stop me! Nobody can stop me!

889
00:51:48,601 --> 00:51:50,033
Look, clio. Let's quit
this horsing around.

890
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,534
I'm heading north.

891
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:52,934
Go, then.

892
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,400
Like i said before,

893
00:51:54,467 --> 00:51:55,934
you're welcome
to come along.

894
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,901
No. First
i must finish here.

895
00:51:58,968 --> 00:52:00,567
I must have money.

896
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:02,968
I haven't any money,
either... i mean, money.

897
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:05,501
But i know how
to turn a trick...

898
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:07,501
most of the times
honest.

899
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:10,467
Honey, i can make out
for both of us.

900
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:14,467
I've been doing all right over
at the racetrack, the clubhouse.

901
00:52:14,534 --> 00:52:17,968
Faro, roulette, sitting in
on poker games. Look here-

902
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:21,434
poker games! Poker games when
there are fools with millions!

903
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:23,000
Do you think i came here

904
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:25,501
to pick up dollar bits
like those girls

905
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:26,968
in your cheap dance
halls in the west, do you?

906
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:28,501
Right careless way
to handle money.

907
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:30,000
Of course, for somebody

908
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:31,567
that's going to
have it to burn-

909
00:52:31,634 --> 00:52:33,501
yes, and when i have, it's going
to be my own. Mine-clio dulaine's.

910
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,033
Well, good luck.

911
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,534
When you think about us-
texas, paris-

912
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,234
it's downright comical.

913
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:38,467
Trying to sneak away
with me, huh?

914
00:53:38,534 --> 00:53:40,033
We leave
these women, yeah?

915
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,033
I heard her tell you
what to do,

916
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,767
now you go and do it.

917
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,601
You go back there and take good
care of her, or i'll skin you alive.

918
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:06,300
Come in, monsieur.

919
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:19,601
Monsieur.

920
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:22,300
Mademoiselle.

921
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:25,501
From your letter asking
me to call at your office-

922
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:27,501
which you chose to ignore, mademoiselle.

923
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:29,501
Madame, or comtesse,
if you prefer.

924
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:31,834
I'd hoped we were
going to be honest

925
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:32,834
and straightforward.

926
00:54:32,901 --> 00:54:34,133
Oh, but of course.

927
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,501
Good. I think
i should tell you,

928
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:38,000
i do not belong to the
old-school new orleans tradition.

929
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:40,501
I belong to
the post-war period.

930
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:43,300
The new orleans of the
river steamboat has ended.

931
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,801
You didn't come here to
discuss steamboats, monsieur.

932
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:49,868
I believe we understand
each other.

933
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:51,300
Now, i have here some-

934
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:52,501
no, no, no.

935
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:54,000
Please, no papers.

936
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:56,767
When my mother died,
there were so many.

937
00:54:56,834 --> 00:54:58,501
You remember my mother,
monsieur?

938
00:54:59,534 --> 00:55:01,968
Madame, uh...

939
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:06,434
you are causing a great
deal of pain to my client,

940
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:07,968
madame nicholas dulaine,

941
00:55:08,033 --> 00:55:09,634
and her daughter
charlotte terese.

942
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:12,434
Your client
for many years

943
00:55:12,501 --> 00:55:14,901
caused my mother
much greater pain.

944
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:17,968
This is blackmail.

945
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:21,000
You're right to say that
you're not of old new orleans.

946
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,434
I'm sure your manners are of a
more recent and unfortunate day.

947
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:24,968
After all,
i didn't ask to see you.

948
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,934
I was living here quietly
in my mother's house...

949
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,467
quietly?
...disturbing no one.

950
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:31,000
I'm young. I like to go
by the shops and theaters.

951
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:32,501
Still,
if as you suggest,

952
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:33,934
your actions can be
construed as blackmail-

953
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,033
my actions?

954
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,434
You can't frighten me
as you did my mother.

955
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:37,968
Good day, monsieur.

956
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:39,501
No, please.

957
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:41,033
Ahem.

958
00:55:45,567 --> 00:55:46,868
No, thank you.

959
00:55:46,934 --> 00:55:48,968
Um...

960
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:51,934
may we get
to the point?

961
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,467
I have here $5,000.

962
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:56,067
It is that or nothing.

963
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:59,133
$5,000 for what?

964
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:08,767
"I, who call myself
clio dulaine,

965
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:11,767
"sometimes known as the comtesse
de trignonai du chenfrais,

966
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:15,467
"daughter of the woman rita
who called herself dulaine,

967
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:18,033
"hereby agree and promise

968
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:22,067
"i shall leave new orleans
within the next 30 days

969
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:24,033
"and never to return.

970
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,734
I shall cease
to call myself dulaine."

971
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:34,934
"After leaving,
never to return,

972
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,501
"i shall do
and say nothing

973
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:40,968
"that will associate me
with the family of dulaine.

974
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:42,501
I hereby promise-"

975
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:46,968
and if i do not sign this
very inhospitable paper?

976
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:48,501
I have
political influence.

977
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:51,601
I can make it very
uncomfortable for you.

978
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:55,033
Not as uncomfortable as i
can make it for your client.

979
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,300
Shall we say 10,000?

980
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:57,934
Impossible.

981
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,400
Madame dulaine is
very far from wealthy.

982
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:03,133
I might possibly
stretch her to-

983
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,834
shall we save each other
some breath and say...

984
00:57:05,901 --> 00:57:07,367
seven?

985
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:15,200
10,000.

986
00:57:16,968 --> 00:57:19,400
Now, then, i, too,
have certain demands.

987
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:20,968
You have demands?

988
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:22,467
Don't be alarmed. They're
mostly sentimental.

989
00:57:22,534 --> 00:57:26,434
The money is to be paid as
if for the sale of this house.

990
00:57:26,501 --> 00:57:27,901
Agreed.

991
00:57:27,968 --> 00:57:29,467
In fact, very clever.

992
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:31,934
Then it's to be
torn down

993
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,968
and all its furnishings
destroyed.

994
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:36,467
Destroy this house, all
this magnificent furniture?

995
00:57:36,534 --> 00:57:38,467
I won't have
dirty eyes gloating

996
00:57:38,534 --> 00:57:40,467
over the belongings
of my mother.

997
00:57:40,534 --> 00:57:41,634
Agreed.

998
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:44,000
Then my mother is to be
returned to new orleans.

999
00:57:44,067 --> 00:57:45,267
It was her dearest wish.

1000
00:57:45,334 --> 00:57:46,501
New orleans
was her home.

1001
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:49,434
She's to be buried in the
cemetery of saint louis.

1002
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:51,467
There is a plot of
unconsecrated ground there.

1003
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:52,400
It'll have to do.

1004
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:54,934
On her tomb
is to be placed

1005
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,734
her name
- rita dulaine, beloved wife.

1006
00:57:56,801 --> 00:57:57,934
But, my dear child-

1007
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,367
rita dulaine.

1008
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,868
And flowers are
to be placed there

1009
00:58:01,934 --> 00:58:04,834
once a year
on all saints' day,

1010
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:07,300
and her tomb is to be kept whitewashed.

1011
00:58:09,033 --> 00:58:11,467
When you have rewritten
your paper,

1012
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:13,467
will you come back
this afternoon?

1013
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:17,467
Do you think you can bring
charlotte terese to see me?

1014
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:18,968
Impossible.
This is indecent.

1015
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:20,467
I suppose,

1016
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:23,267
but i think my father
would have liked it.

1017
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,801
Au revoir,
monsieur.

1018
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,801
Madame, i am
interested to know

1019
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:28,968
what you are
going to do-

1020
00:58:29,033 --> 00:58:30,434
as a man,
an acquaintance,

1021
00:58:30,501 --> 00:58:31,968
not a lawyer, i mean.

1022
00:58:32,033 --> 00:58:33,434
$10,000-
that can't last long.

1023
00:58:33,501 --> 00:58:34,968
I meant no offense.

1024
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:36,067
I'm amused.

1025
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:38,434
I don't mind telling
you i'm going to marry

1026
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:39,934
a very rich
and powerful man.

1027
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,467
You don't mean this fellow from
- this texas?

1028
00:58:42,534 --> 00:58:44,000
Oh, no, no, no-

1029
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:47,000
not a penny, except
what he wins gambling.

1030
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:49,000
I shall go
to greener fields.

1031
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:53,434
I hope the money
will be of some help.

1032
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:55,067
Madame?
Yes?

1033
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,067
You are very beautiful.
I mean...

1034
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:03,601
beautiful.

1035
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:06,400
Yes. Isn't it lucky?

1036
00:59:32,934 --> 00:59:34,267
Letterman!

1037
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:40,067
Put those with things we're gonna take
with us, not the things we're selling.

1038
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:42,067
Big show you made
to that lawyer

1039
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:43,567
was going to
destroy everything.

1040
00:59:43,634 --> 00:59:45,067
Sentimentality
is for the public.

1041
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:46,067
Practicality
begins at home.

1042
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:47,601
If that isn't
a proverb,

1043
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,100
it ought to be.

1044
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,834
Letter!

1045
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:53,601
Ahh!

1046
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:55,100
Who from?

1047
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:57,801
What does he say?

1048
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:02,601
"Dear countess,"
it begins.

1049
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:06,100
He means that to
cut me to the quick.

1050
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,834
"Every time i think about the..."

1051
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:12,567
go about your work.

1052
01:00:12,634 --> 01:00:15,567
Take that chair
outside and burn it.

1053
01:00:15,634 --> 01:00:17,334
See to the packing,
angelique.

1054
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:32,567
What did he say?

1055
01:00:32,634 --> 01:00:34,801
I haven't
finished it yet.

1056
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,801
Smash those glasses.

1057
01:00:57,701 --> 01:01:01,100
Bartholomew van steed.

1058
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:02,567
What you say?

1059
01:01:02,634 --> 01:01:04,334
Nothing.

1060
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:40,067
What's he say?

1061
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:42,067
He says he's
missing us very much.

1062
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:43,067
Me, too?

1063
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,734
All of us!

1064
01:02:20,234 --> 01:02:22,133
It's what
she always wanted.

1065
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,767
She all fixed up
respectable now?

1066
01:02:26,601 --> 01:02:28,534
I hope so, angelique.

1067
01:02:28,601 --> 01:02:31,033
Well, that was
a good deed

1068
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,767
what you've done
for your mama.

1069
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:39,300
Yes. That does for mama.

1070
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,834
Now we'll see what we
can do for little clio.

1071
01:02:57,601 --> 01:02:58,667
Gangway!

1072
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:02,801
All aboard!

1073
01:03:27,701 --> 01:03:29,000
He must be the one,

1074
01:03:29,067 --> 01:03:32,200
running up and down like a
chick without its hen mother.

1075
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:47,567
Come. Now the bus
is gone.

1076
01:03:47,634 --> 01:03:50,767
Angelique, hold the
jewel box well forward.

1077
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:04,567
Look, angelique,
almost everyone is gone.

1078
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:07,567
Really, i don't know
what we're to do.

1079
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:13,033
I was to look for a bus
marked saratoga springs hotel,

1080
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,100
but as you can see,
it isn't here.

1081
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,234
Why,
i beg your pardon.

1082
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,400
I couldn't help
overhearing.

1083
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:21,868
I'm driving to the saratoga
springs hotel myself.

1084
01:04:21,934 --> 01:04:23,334
I couldn't
trouble you.

1085
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,534
It's no trouble at all,
i assure you, madame...

1086
01:04:25,601 --> 01:04:27,167
or is it miss?

1087
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,534
I'm la comtesse-

1088
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:32,501
i am
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1089
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:35,534
I'm bart van steed.
It's no trouble at all.

1090
01:04:35,601 --> 01:04:37,200
Bartholomew van steed.
How enchanting!

1091
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:38,901
It's like being met
unexpectedly

1092
01:04:38,968 --> 01:04:41,400
by a friend
in a strange land.

1093
01:04:41,467 --> 01:04:43,868
It is a strange land
to me,

1094
01:04:43,934 --> 01:04:45,501
but perhaps you're
meeting someone else.

1095
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,033
I was expecting
my mother.

1096
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,934
She telegraphed that she
was arriving on this train.

1097
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,167
And she didn't come?

1098
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:52,434
Perhaps she missed the
train or changed her mind.

1099
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:54,267
My mother never
misses a train.

1100
01:04:54,334 --> 01:04:56,033
And she never
changes her mind.

1101
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,501
Perhaps someone
was playing a joke.

1102
01:04:57,567 --> 01:04:59,801
People do not
play jokes on me.

1103
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:03,567
It was lucky that
i brought the phaeton.

1104
01:05:03,634 --> 01:05:05,567
Mother won't ride
in the dogcart.

1105
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:07,501
But i'm afraid there
isn't room for all of you.

1106
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:09,534
Mais certainement,
it will do beautifully.

1107
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,300
My woman can sit back
there with your groom-

1108
01:05:11,367 --> 01:05:12,367
she's very thin-

1109
01:05:12,434 --> 01:05:14,067
and cupidon can stand here on the step.

1110
01:05:14,133 --> 01:05:15,567
Now, my bag right there at my feet.

1111
01:05:15,634 --> 01:05:17,067
Oh, but i
assure you-

1112
01:05:17,133 --> 01:05:19,567
oh, i don't mind. The hotel
porter will see to my trunks.

1113
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:21,100
Angelique, you have
my jewel case? Good.

1114
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,534
Cupidon, right here
on the step.

1115
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:25,033
Oh, this is wonderful.
So very kind.

1116
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,501
I don't know what
i should have done

1117
01:05:27,567 --> 01:05:30,267
if you hadn't appeared
like a shining knight.

1118
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:29,467
Do people always stare
like this in america?

1119
01:06:29,534 --> 01:06:33,734
Well, when they have
someone like you to stare at.

1120
01:06:38,901 --> 01:06:42,000
I gather this is your
first visit to saratoga,

1121
01:06:42,067 --> 01:06:43,334
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1122
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,000
C'est vrai?
I speak some french.

1123
01:06:46,067 --> 01:06:47,501
Oh, no, no!

1124
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:56,834
That is, i read french
much better than i speak it.

1125
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:07,033
Hey, you!

1126
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,334
Your best suite of rooms
for madame la comtesse!

1127
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:13,968
Did you say...

1128
01:07:16,934 --> 01:07:19,000
mr. Roscoe bean-
our head usher.

1129
01:07:19,067 --> 01:07:20,501
Your ladyship.

1130
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:22,467
If you please, i wish to live in america

1131
01:07:22,534 --> 01:07:23,767
quietly and
democratically

1132
01:07:23,834 --> 01:07:25,400
simply as
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1133
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:26,767
Your magnificent hotel

1134
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,868
is exactly as
i knew it would be.

1135
01:07:28,934 --> 01:07:32,267
But your ladyship
- madame has been here before?

1136
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:35,434
No. But my husband
le comte-the late comte.

1137
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:36,968
Comte
du chenfrais.

1138
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:39,467
I don't seem to recall. Was it recently?

1139
01:07:39,534 --> 01:07:42,000
Please, i rather we didn't
speak of him anymore.

1140
01:07:42,067 --> 01:07:44,467
I'm not yet fully recovered
from my bereavement.

1141
01:07:44,534 --> 01:07:47,400
If i may be allowed
to live here quietly.

1142
01:07:47,467 --> 01:07:49,501
Of course, of course. Incognito.

1143
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:52,501
How well i remember when his
excellency, the marquis de-

1144
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:54,434
i assure you
mrs. Du chenfrais

1145
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:58,267
is not interested in his excellency,
but in her accommodations.

1146
01:07:58,334 --> 01:07:59,701
Of course, of course, accommodations.

1147
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:00,934
Accommodations-
dear me.

1148
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,501
But we have no
accommodations.

1149
01:08:02,567 --> 01:08:05,601
If madame had only
let us know in advance.

1150
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:07,501
Perhaps one of
the other hotels?

1151
01:08:07,567 --> 01:08:08,601
Mrs. Du chenfrais,
no!

1152
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,000
Tomorrow i can
let you have a suite

1153
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:12,067
in one of the cottages in the rear.

1154
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:13,501
I? At the rear?

1155
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:15,033
That's preposterous!

1156
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,033
You must accommodate
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1157
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,534
Why, i, myself,
will give up my-

1158
01:08:18,601 --> 01:08:20,234
excuse me, ma'am...

1159
01:08:23,067 --> 01:08:26,968
but i couldn't help overhearing
what you were saying.

1160
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:29,467
My name's maroon.
Clint maroon.

1161
01:08:29,534 --> 01:08:30,701
Really,
gentlemen, i...

1162
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:32,000
no offense, ma'am.

1163
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:33,968
Look here, you can't address
a lady you've never met.

1164
01:08:34,033 --> 01:08:36,467
Introduce us, then,
and make it legal.

1165
01:08:36,534 --> 01:08:39,434
I'm aiming to help
the little lady.

1166
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:41,501
Mrs. Du chenfrais, may
i present colonel maroon?

1167
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:42,834
Right glad to meet you,
ma'am.

1168
01:08:42,934 --> 01:08:45,167
I'm occupying three rooms
just to stretch my legs,

1169
01:08:45,234 --> 01:08:48,000
and you might as well
have a couple of them.

1170
01:08:48,067 --> 01:08:51,000
No, i wouldn't think of
turning you out of your rooms.

1171
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:53,133
There's no sense of me
using all that space.

1172
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,501
I'll go and get my things out,
and you can move in right now.

1173
01:08:55,567 --> 01:08:57,167
How good of you,
colonel, uh...

1174
01:08:57,234 --> 01:08:59,467
maroon. Clint maroon.

1175
01:08:59,534 --> 01:09:01,400
What a delightful name!
So american.

1176
01:09:01,467 --> 01:09:02,501
Texas, ma'am.

1177
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:04,834
Texas? I should
love to see texas.

1178
01:09:04,901 --> 01:09:07,400
Play your cards right,
ma'am, and maybe you can.

1179
01:09:09,267 --> 01:09:13,000
Well, i'll mosey along
and be out in two shakes.

1180
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:15,501
Oh, how can
i thank you?

1181
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:18,534
I feel that we are
actually friends.

1182
01:09:18,601 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm happy to have
been of service.

1183
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:23,534
I hope that your
dear mother's telegram

1184
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:26,501
will soon be followed by her
company. Good-bye, mr. Van steed.

1185
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:27,701
Oh, i'll see you
again soon,

1186
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:29,033
since we're living
under the same roof.

1187
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,534
Who is this gentleman,
your friend in the white hat?

1188
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:33,934
He's the real figure
of an american. Who is he?

1189
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,901
Maroon? Texas cattleman, i'm told.

1190
01:09:35,968 --> 01:09:38,868
Some such thing. But
he's no friend of mine.

1191
01:09:38,934 --> 01:09:43,567
Oh, a pity. In paris, he
would have been the rage.

1192
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:56,067
Your mother didn't come,
bartholomew. What a disappointment.

1193
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:57,567
Mrs. Bellop.

1194
01:09:57,634 --> 01:10:00,501
You're not playing a little
joke on us, are you, bart?

1195
01:10:00,567 --> 01:10:03,601
You didn't drive down to the depot
just to meet a certain somebody else?

1196
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:04,868
I'm not obliged to
explain my behavior

1197
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,567
to a lot of harpies
on a hotel piazza.

1198
01:10:06,634 --> 01:10:07,634
She's really lovely.

1199
01:10:07,701 --> 01:10:09,601
I tell you, i don't
even know the lady.

1200
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:11,801
You must introduce me sometime.
I should love to meet her.

1201
01:10:27,067 --> 01:10:29,033
Raise those shades.
Mind that luggage.

1202
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,334
I'll have a housekeeper
and chamber maids

1203
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,534
up here immediately.

1204
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:34,033
Nothing now,
thank you.

1205
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,534
No maids.
I must rest.

1206
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:45,067
Cupid, run down to see
if the trunks have come.

1207
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,367
Well, it looks like this is
about all of my stuff, ma'am.

1208
01:10:50,434 --> 01:10:53,534
It's so kind of you,
mr. - Colonel maroon.

1209
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:54,968
I feel quite guilty.

1210
01:10:55,067 --> 01:10:58,067
No call to at all.
Good day, ma'am.

1211
01:10:58,133 --> 01:11:01,267
Well, it looks like
we're going to be neighbors.

1212
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:06,801
I'll lock the door on your
side, mrs. Du chenfrais.

1213
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:12,767
Now, if you'll kindly lock it
on your side, colonel maroon.

1214
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:19,534
It's a double lock,
you see. Both sides.

1215
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
If there's anything
i can do for you-

1216
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:26,501
if there's anything at all, mr.
Bean, i'll send for you at once.

1217
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:29,767
Thank you so much. Now,
you will let me know if-

1218
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,767
how are you, ma'am?

1219
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:49,501
If you'd called me "ma'am"
down there once more,

1220
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:51,167
i'd have screamed.

1221
01:11:51,234 --> 01:11:54,000
I sure would have admired
to hear you, ma'am,

1222
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:57,467
only i'd have hated to
have you scare bart away.

1223
01:11:57,534 --> 01:12:01,534
How in sam hill you get
him eating out of your hand?

1224
01:12:01,601 --> 01:12:05,067
I'd discovered that mrs. Van
steed was safely in bar harbor

1225
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:06,567
having a grandchild,

1226
01:12:06,634 --> 01:12:10,567
so i sent him a telegram
to meet me at the station.

1227
01:12:10,634 --> 01:12:12,067
And he came?

1228
01:12:12,133 --> 01:12:13,567
I signed it "mama."

1229
01:12:13,634 --> 01:12:15,234
Huh.

1230
01:12:16,701 --> 01:12:19,033
When i saw him sashaying
in acting like he owned you-

1231
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,434
are you jealous-

1232
01:12:20,501 --> 01:12:22,701
you're durn tooting,
i'm jealous.

1233
01:12:25,534 --> 01:12:29,000
Just have to get
used to it, my darling.

1234
01:12:29,067 --> 01:12:31,734
We mustn't forget
why i'm here.

1235
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,767
Send her away.

1236
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,801
It was
a long train trip.

1237
01:12:41,868 --> 01:12:43,067
My poor child.

1238
01:12:43,133 --> 01:12:45,734
I didn't sleep not one
hour on that dreadful train.

1239
01:12:45,801 --> 01:12:47,067
Thinking up that
flashy entrance?

1240
01:12:47,133 --> 01:12:48,367
Ha ha! Clever,
wasn't it?

1241
01:12:48,434 --> 01:12:49,434
What did you come here for, anyway?

1242
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:50,834
I was getting along
fine.

1243
01:12:50,901 --> 01:12:52,968
Did they get wise to you and
kick you out of new orleans?

1244
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:55,033
You know very well why i came
here. Have i ever pretended?

1245
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,734
No, but ain't you ever
gonna be satisfied?

1246
01:12:56,801 --> 01:12:58,567
Satisfied with what?
Some good jewelry?

1247
01:12:58,634 --> 01:12:59,901
Mama's made-over clothes?

1248
01:12:59,968 --> 01:13:01,868
Money enough to last me over
the summer if i'm careful?

1249
01:13:01,934 --> 01:13:04,467
I want respectability
and comfort and security!

1250
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:07,601
We cannot get used
to each other, cheri.

1251
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:10,334
Not too much. That would
be bad, n'est-ce pas?

1252
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,067
Oh, very bad.
Ness pop.

1253
01:13:13,133 --> 01:13:14,701
It's no use arguing
with her, mr. Clint.

1254
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:16,400
She's very tired.
She ought to go to sleep.

1255
01:13:16,467 --> 01:13:18,567
Oh, there are hundreds of things
i must know before i sleep.

1256
01:13:18,634 --> 01:13:22,501
Stop scowling like a cross
little boy and talk to me!

1257
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:24,000
Peaches!

1258
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:25,501
Peaches! Hey, you!
Peaches!

1259
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,734
Hey, clio! Hold it!
You can't do that!

1260
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:31,000
You can't do that!
Come here!

1261
01:13:31,067 --> 01:13:32,968
I want a peach!
I'm hungry!

1262
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:35,000
Stop screaming
into the streets!

1263
01:13:35,067 --> 01:13:36,367
Here's cupidon!
He can go!

1264
01:13:36,434 --> 01:13:39,501
Quick, cupidon,
before the man is gone!

1265
01:13:39,567 --> 01:13:41,234
Hey, you little
soldier!

1266
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,534
Bring me
some champagne.

1267
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:47,000
Fresh peaches bobbing
in a glass of champagne!

1268
01:13:47,067 --> 01:13:49,434
That's the way mama
used to drink it in paris!

1269
01:13:52,601 --> 01:13:55,100
Peaches! Peaches!

1270
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:57,534
Mrs. Bellop, i looked
it up in burke's peerage.

1271
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:59,033
There's no
du chenfrais.

1272
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,434
Of course there isn't.

1273
01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:02,767
Burke's peerage is english,
and she's french.

1274
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,467
Oh, good morning,
little man.

1275
01:14:07,534 --> 01:14:10,501
How long have you been with the
countess, and where did you come from?

1276
01:14:13,234 --> 01:14:16,067
Oh, so i'm
a fat old sow, am i?

1277
01:14:16,133 --> 01:14:18,300
Merci bien!

1278
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:32,400
That's the way
i love it. Mmm.

1279
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:36,000
Cozy and everyone near me...

1280
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:38,067
and things stirring.

1281
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:40,000
Take a little sip, cheri.

1282
01:14:40,067 --> 01:14:42,000
Just a little sip.
It's heavenly.

1283
01:14:42,067 --> 01:14:43,467
Peaches
in champagne?

1284
01:14:43,534 --> 01:14:44,934
That's no drink
for a man.

1285
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,467
Don't be like that.

1286
01:14:46,534 --> 01:14:48,033
Tell me everything.

1287
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,033
Tell me about
these men...

1288
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,033
these rich,
respectable old men

1289
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,501
who sit and rock
on that huge piazza.

1290
01:14:55,567 --> 01:14:58,367
If it's bart van steed
you have on your mind,

1291
01:14:58,434 --> 01:15:01,033
he's gonna be too busy
to bother about you, honey.

1292
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,033
I heard yesterday
they're out to get him.

1293
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,434
Why? How? When?

1294
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:09,033
Van steed owns a railroad
between albany and binghamton,

1295
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,033
right up here
near saratoga.

1296
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,701
It's what they call a trunk
line, only about 100 miles long.

1297
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:17,033
Years ago, his mama gave
it to him to play with-

1298
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,501
his first
little railroad.

1299
01:15:18,567 --> 01:15:21,033
Now it's turned up
worth millions.

1300
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,100
Why millions?

1301
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:23,501
Angelique, stop rattling that paper!

1302
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:25,501
Why is this saratoga
trunk worth millions?

1303
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,634
How can i sleep when there are
things like this i must know?

1304
01:15:28,701 --> 01:15:29,767
Tell me-why millions?

1305
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:31,234
Well, it seems
it's the link

1306
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,367
between the new pennsylvania
hard coal lands and new england.

1307
01:15:33,434 --> 01:15:35,501
Sure thing,
it's worth millions.

1308
01:15:35,567 --> 01:15:37,834
Does he know this?
Van steed?

1309
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:41,067
Listen, he ain't
as loco as he looks.

1310
01:15:41,133 --> 01:15:43,667
Don't raise your eyebrows
when i say "ain't."

1311
01:15:45,367 --> 01:15:48,501
Raymond soule's crowd
have been going at it

1312
01:15:48,567 --> 01:15:50,968
with every dirty trick
there is in the book.

1313
01:15:51,033 --> 01:15:52,501
Graft. Politics. Force.

1314
01:15:52,567 --> 01:15:54,033
For what they're doing,

1315
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,033
they'd be strung up for outlaws
out west. You wouldn't believe it.

1316
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,501
They hire gangs to go out and tear
up tracks and chop down trestles.

1317
01:15:58,567 --> 01:16:00,534
Folks won't ride the railroad
anymore. It ain't safe.

1318
01:16:00,601 --> 01:16:03,033
That's just what this
soule's figuring on-

1319
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,033
running it right down
to nothing.

1320
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,968
Buy it up cheap
- hair, hide, horns, and tallow.

1321
01:16:08,033 --> 01:16:09,067
Who is he?

1322
01:16:09,133 --> 01:16:11,767
He's boss of the upstate railroad crowd.

1323
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:15,501
Likely, you were too busy making goo-goo
eyes when you come in to notice him.

1324
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:17,539
Always sitting
there on the piazza

1325
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,627
hiding behind
a couple of bodyguards.

1326
01:16:19,628 --> 01:16:21,934
Don't let his size fool you.
He's big poison.

1327
01:16:22,033 --> 01:16:23,334
Is he rich?

1328
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,968
Rub my foot,
cheri.

1329
01:16:25,033 --> 01:16:26,934
Huh.

1330
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,701
Couple of hundred million.

1331
01:16:28,767 --> 01:16:30,000
Maybe more.

1332
01:16:30,067 --> 01:16:31,868
Is he married?

1333
01:16:31,934 --> 01:16:35,000
No, honey. No.

1334
01:16:35,067 --> 01:16:36,667
I mean, no for you.

1335
01:16:36,734 --> 01:16:38,567
Well, one never knows.

1336
01:16:38,634 --> 01:16:41,467
Now, go on, cheri.
I'm fascinated.

1337
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:44,100
Mmm, that feels good.

1338
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:46,501
There's more to
this soule bunch.

1339
01:16:46,567 --> 01:16:48,901
They're hooked up with those
skunks that came through texas.

1340
01:16:48,968 --> 01:16:50,400
Oww!
You're hurting me!

1341
01:16:50,467 --> 01:16:51,467
Sorry, honey.
I was thinking.

1342
01:16:51,534 --> 01:16:53,701
My fingers just itch
to get ahold of a gun

1343
01:16:53,767 --> 01:16:56,000
when i think of that pack of
varmints out there rocking.

1344
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:58,968
I bet i could pick one or two
of them off from your window.

1345
01:16:59,033 --> 01:17:00,901
Poor little
bartholomew van steed.

1346
01:17:00,968 --> 01:17:03,534
Poor little mama's boy.
No one to help him.

1347
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:04,834
Don't worry about
little bartholomew.

1348
01:17:04,901 --> 01:17:06,367
He's got a good team, too-

1349
01:17:06,434 --> 01:17:07,968
for one, the richest
banker in new york,

1350
01:17:08,033 --> 01:17:09,634
the fellow that's got that
place down on wall street-

1351
01:17:09,701 --> 01:17:11,334
the house of
something or other-

1352
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:15,000
and that scotchman who owns all
those steel mills and coal mines,

1353
01:17:15,067 --> 01:17:16,033
and plenty of others.

1354
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,467
Railroads! Railroads!
Railroads!

1355
01:17:17,534 --> 01:17:20,033
What do i care
about railroads?

1356
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,067
What am i doing here?

1357
01:17:22,133 --> 01:17:24,968
Who are you? How do i know who you are?

1358
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:27,467
Holy cats! Now what's
eating the countess?

1359
01:17:27,534 --> 01:17:28,968
There, baby,
angelique is here!

1360
01:17:29,033 --> 01:17:30,834
Mr. Clint,
that champagne make her sad.

1361
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:33,501
Why don't you gentle down,
honey, and quit snortin' around?

1362
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,467
Go away! Go away!
Everybody, go away!

1363
01:17:35,534 --> 01:17:37,501
Stop screeching around here
like a crazy mare.

1364
01:17:37,567 --> 01:17:39,501
First thing you're happy,
then you're tired.

1365
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:40,968
Now you're sad
or something.

1366
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:42,667
Try that again, and
you'll be here all alone.

1367
01:17:42,734 --> 01:17:45,267
Ooh, what's that?

1368
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:48,701
From the man who brought
us from the station.

1369
01:17:54,067 --> 01:17:56,834
Clint... is he the one i shall marry?

1370
01:17:56,901 --> 01:17:58,634
I don't give a hoot
who you marry,

1371
01:17:58,701 --> 01:18:01,000
but you're not gonna
get me to act as your-

1372
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:02,968
you'll act towards me with
the dignity and respect

1373
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:06,000
of someone who's met mrs. Du
chenfrais for the first time.

1374
01:18:06,067 --> 01:18:07,767
A widow
so recently bereft-

1375
01:18:07,834 --> 01:18:09,267
of her senses.

1376
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:11,033
But not her
dramatic sense.

1377
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,400
They'll be
expecting me.

1378
01:18:12,467 --> 01:18:14,501
They'll be
waiting for me.

1379
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:18,033
So for days and days,
i'll stay up here,

1380
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,767
and i'll let them
wait and wonder.

1381
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:22,934
I'll stay here
and watch the show.

1382
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,467
Why, these people will make
cold hash out of you in a week.

1383
01:18:26,534 --> 01:18:28,467
They'll tear you
to pieces,

1384
01:18:28,534 --> 01:18:30,934
and i'll stand by
and laugh.

1385
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,901
Hey, look,
she's clean beat out.

1386
01:18:33,968 --> 01:18:34,773
And no wonder

1387
01:18:34,774 --> 01:18:36,467
drinking champagne in
the middle of the day.

1388
01:18:36,534 --> 01:18:38,467
What are we gonna do
with her, angelique?

1389
01:18:38,534 --> 01:18:40,434
When she's like this, ain't
anybody can do anything.

1390
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:42,501
She like this in paris
before she come.

1391
01:18:42,567 --> 01:18:45,701
She like this in new
orleans before she met you.

1392
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:48,501
She sleep perhaps one day,
perhaps two or three.

1393
01:18:48,567 --> 01:18:50,501
But when she wake up,
zumba! Look out!

1394
01:18:50,567 --> 01:18:53,234
Look out? What can she do
she hasn't done already?

1395
01:18:54,601 --> 01:18:56,000
Crazy stuff!

1396
01:18:56,067 --> 01:18:57,968
Where boss man
go now?

1397
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,501
To the horses?

1398
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:01,701
All right, we'll go
to the track if you want.

1399
01:19:01,767 --> 01:19:03,501
Anyplace we can smell
some fresh air.

1400
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:05,300
Sure! Sure, boss. We go to
the horses. Women is crazy!

1401
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,601
N'est-ce pas? You betcha. Son of a gun!

1402
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,801
Maybe they dead.

1403
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:37,767
Mama...

1404
01:19:48,067 --> 01:19:49,801
clint...

1405
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,801
oh, cheri.

1406
01:20:09,467 --> 01:20:11,711
What time is it?

1407
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:16,968
7:00. what day is it?

1408
01:20:17,033 --> 01:20:18,567
Oh...

1409
01:20:18,634 --> 01:20:22,033
why, baby, you slept
two days, last i know.

1410
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:25,234
Oh, i feel wonderful!

1411
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,667
Quick, angelique,
my gabrielle!

1412
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:28,701
Look out, that's
what i told him.

1413
01:20:28,767 --> 01:20:30,334
My mind is
clear and bright,

1414
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,367
just as
i knew it would be.

1415
01:20:32,434 --> 01:20:34,567
And i have a plan,
as i knew i would have.

1416
01:20:34,634 --> 01:20:36,067
What now?
More mess?

1417
01:20:36,133 --> 01:20:37,667
You'll see.
Roll up the shades!

1418
01:20:37,734 --> 01:20:39,234
Tell me,
where is mr. Maroon?

1419
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,868
Ain't seen
nor heard of him.

1420
01:20:40,934 --> 01:20:43,000
Good. Where's cupidon? In here?

1421
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,767
Poor little man.

1422
01:21:03,634 --> 01:21:05,467
Howdy, ma'am.

1423
01:21:05,534 --> 01:21:07,267
Good morning, cupidon.

1424
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:15,033
Why didn't you sleep downstairs
in the room provided for you?

1425
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:17,067
He said stay near you and the old crow.

1426
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:19,267
Ah, to watch me,
no doubt.

1427
01:21:20,567 --> 01:21:22,801
Tell me,
what have you found out?

1428
01:21:22,868 --> 01:21:24,501
Who are
the important people?

1429
01:21:24,567 --> 01:21:26,467
Well, there's
that fat woman.

1430
01:21:26,534 --> 01:21:28,968
Ha ha ha!
Who is the fat woman?

1431
01:21:29,067 --> 01:21:29,767
Bellop.

1432
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:31,267
Don't make
ugly noises.

1433
01:21:31,334 --> 01:21:32,767
That's her name-
bellop.

1434
01:21:32,834 --> 01:21:35,601
They say everybody in
saratoga's afraid of her.

1435
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:37,033
Yes?

1436
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,901
She tried to
question me about you.

1437
01:21:38,968 --> 01:21:40,968
I pretended to
speak only french.

1438
01:21:41,033 --> 01:21:43,033
And what
do you think?

1439
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,767
She speaks french
like anything!

1440
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,534
So...

1441
01:21:48,601 --> 01:21:50,934
well, out of here,
both of you.

1442
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,901
Make yourself
neat and smart.

1443
01:21:52,968 --> 01:21:55,501
You, cupidon, look to
your shoes and buttons.

1444
01:21:55,567 --> 01:21:57,534
Be polite to the hotel
servants. No tricks!

1445
01:21:57,601 --> 01:21:59,000
And you, angelique,
no voodoo, no witchwork.

1446
01:21:59,067 --> 01:22:02,567
Your best black silk!
We're going to the springs.

1447
01:22:02,634 --> 01:22:04,767
About time.
Two days lost.

1448
01:22:07,133 --> 01:22:08,567
Red heels
ain't for widows.

1449
01:22:08,634 --> 01:22:10,067
It's the way
i feel today.

1450
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:13,033
My husband has been dead as a
herring for at least two years.

1451
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,234
You full of
the devil.

1452
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,067
Your ladyship,
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1453
01:22:16,133 --> 01:22:17,767
How have you been,
mr. Bean?

1454
01:22:17,834 --> 01:22:20,567
Frantic.
Simply frantic.

1455
01:22:20,634 --> 01:22:23,501
Two days! There have
been dozens of inquiries.

1456
01:22:23,567 --> 01:22:26,501
How kind of people
to take such interest.

1457
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,501
We pictured you
desolated with your grief.

1458
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:30,501
I think i'll take
the waters this morning.

1459
01:22:30,567 --> 01:22:32,501
I hear your famous springs
are most healthful.

1460
01:22:32,567 --> 01:22:33,968
Perhaps you could
recommend one.

1461
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:36,767
Of course. We have a
specially prepared booklet.

1462
01:22:38,601 --> 01:22:40,968
I told you these two days
haven't been wasted.

1463
01:22:41,033 --> 01:22:43,434
Regardez.
By the front door.

1464
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:50,000
That's the one been asking
questions about you.

1465
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:58,067
For example, there's
the triton water-

1466
01:22:58,133 --> 01:23:01,033
gout, irritated stomachs,
pimples blotches, ulcers.

1467
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,067
Please, mr. Bean!

1468
01:23:03,133 --> 01:23:05,534
The empire spring is
very gay. The band plays-

1469
01:23:05,601 --> 01:23:07,067
good morning.

1470
01:23:07,133 --> 01:23:11,000
Mrs. Du chenfrais,
i'm mrs. Coventry bellop.

1471
01:23:11,067 --> 01:23:13,601
I want to welcome you
to saratoga...

1472
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:15,100
and to tell you

1473
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:17,300
that i had the great
pleasure of knowing

1474
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,601
your late lamented husband-
dear, dear bimby.

1475
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:21,033
Is it possible?

1476
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,601
Well, isn't it?

1477
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:25,534
Hardly. He was
almost a recluse.

1478
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:28,000
Perhaps you're thinking
of his younger brother-

1479
01:23:28,067 --> 01:23:30,033
the black sheep,
i'm afraid.

1480
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,868
He was known as bimby among his friends.

1481
01:23:31,934 --> 01:23:34,634
I shouldn't wonder,
if you say so.

1482
01:23:34,701 --> 01:23:37,167
I told you you were wrong to
be suspicious of this lady.

1483
01:23:37,234 --> 01:23:39,000
Me? My dear
mrs. Bellop!

1484
01:23:39,067 --> 01:23:41,501
Oh, isn't that-
but of course it must be-

1485
01:23:41,567 --> 01:23:43,167
mr. Raymond soule,
the railroad man.

1486
01:23:43,234 --> 01:23:44,534
Yes, indeed.

1487
01:23:44,601 --> 01:23:46,000
I'll speak to him.

1488
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:48,534
Nobody ever speaks
to mr. Soule

1489
01:23:48,601 --> 01:23:51,734
unless mr. Soule
speaks to them first.

1490
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,100
Good morning, mr. Soule,
so pleasant to see you!

1491
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,534
My husband
spoke of you.

1492
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:02,067
I am mrs.
Du chenfrais.

1493
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:04,033
I do not know
the name.

1494
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:07,033
You'll recall him as
le comte du chenfrais.

1495
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,534
Please
don't stand up.

1496
01:24:08,601 --> 01:24:09,934
Perhaps it
was this colonel...

1497
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,767
white hat maroon i
heard speak of you.

1498
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,067
I don't know him, either.

1499
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:15,234
The texan-the one who's
says he's going to ruin you?

1500
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,267
Good day, mr. Soule.
Such a lovely chat.

1501
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:25,501
Now i'm walking to
this delightful empire spring.

1502
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:28,000
Walking! But everybody
rides to take the waters.

1503
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:30,734
But i am here
for my health.

1504
01:24:43,968 --> 01:24:45,400
What a woman!

1505
01:24:45,467 --> 01:24:47,467
She makes
her entrance here

1506
01:24:47,534 --> 01:24:50,534
on the arm of our
most eligible bachelor.

1507
01:24:50,601 --> 01:24:52,534
She disappears for two
days while we wonder.

1508
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:55,534
When she reappears, her first
act is to be seen talking

1509
01:24:55,601 --> 01:24:57,534
to the almighty
mr. Soule.

1510
01:24:57,601 --> 01:25:00,000
But she walks
to the springs.

1511
01:25:00,067 --> 01:25:02,033
What will people
say? It's heresy.

1512
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,534
Don't be any sillier
than you are, dear beanie.

1513
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:06,033
It's sheer genius...

1514
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,567
if she can get
away with it.

1515
01:26:26,534 --> 01:26:27,968
Another cup,
angelique.

1516
01:26:28,033 --> 01:26:31,200
I can feel it
doing me good.

1517
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,701
Good morning,
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1518
01:26:59,868 --> 01:27:02,267
Good morning.

1519
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:05,534
Good morning.

1520
01:27:05,601 --> 01:27:07,133
You've been ill?
You didn't come down...

1521
01:27:07,234 --> 01:27:08,701
not ill. Weary.

1522
01:27:08,767 --> 01:27:10,200
I can
understand that.

1523
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:11,534
But you look-

1524
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,534
you seem to be
fully recovered,

1525
01:27:13,601 --> 01:27:15,501
that is, if appearances are anything.

1526
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:16,534
Thank you.

1527
01:27:16,601 --> 01:27:18,267
You must have driven
down very early.

1528
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:19,834
I didn't drive.
I walked.

1529
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,801
Walked? Then you must
allow me to drive you back.

1530
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:24,934
No, no.
I'm walking back.

1531
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,968
I intend to walk down and
back every morning early-

1532
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:28,467
that's one of
the european cures.

1533
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:31,434
Splendid idea. You must
allow me to walk with you.

1534
01:27:31,501 --> 01:27:32,934
If you care to.
Good day.

1535
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,467
May i stroll
with you?

1536
01:27:34,534 --> 01:27:35,968
Of course.

1537
01:27:36,067 --> 01:27:37,801
There's that
fascinating mr. Maroon.

1538
01:27:37,868 --> 01:27:40,234
You presented him,
remember?

1539
01:27:41,501 --> 01:27:44,000
And he will ask to
drive me back, too.

1540
01:27:44,067 --> 01:27:45,501
You're all so kind.

1541
01:27:45,567 --> 01:27:48,501
He's the reason i've been
so weary until now.

1542
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:50,968
All that first night,
he kept me awake.

1543
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:52,567
If he's been
annoying you-

1544
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:54,000
no, not him, exactly.

1545
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:57,000
It was talk, talk,
talk in the next room.

1546
01:27:57,067 --> 01:28:00,801
Railroads, railroads-
i thought i should go mad.

1547
01:28:00,868 --> 01:28:04,000
I'm thinking of moving to a
cottage apartment this morning,

1548
01:28:04,067 --> 01:28:05,501
for quiet.

1549
01:28:05,567 --> 01:28:08,000
They weren't talking
railroads, were they?

1550
01:28:08,067 --> 01:28:10,534
What could they say
about railroads

1551
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:13,534
that would keep
a charming woman awake?

1552
01:28:13,601 --> 01:28:16,534
I don't know. Such things
are too much for me.

1553
01:28:16,601 --> 01:28:18,534
Oh, albany
and trunk lines.

1554
01:28:18,601 --> 01:28:21,033
Tell me, what is
the saratoga trunk?

1555
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,467
I thought it was
something for clothes.

1556
01:28:23,534 --> 01:28:28,167
Trunks and railroads kept whirling
around in my head. Maddening, it was.

1557
01:28:28,234 --> 01:28:31,567
Have i said something?
You look troubled.

1558
01:28:31,634 --> 01:28:33,634
Good morning,
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1559
01:28:33,701 --> 01:28:35,601
Colonel maroon.

1560
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,968
If you're going back
to the hotel-

1561
01:28:40,033 --> 01:28:43,501
what is this i hear about
you talking railroads so loud

1562
01:28:43,567 --> 01:28:46,000
that this lady has to move
out of her rooms?

1563
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:47,767
You've been circulating
this morning.

1564
01:28:47,834 --> 01:28:51,767
On my way out of the hotel
just now, i met mr. Soule.

1565
01:28:51,834 --> 01:28:54,501
He wanted to know what this
was about my threatening to-

1566
01:28:54,567 --> 01:28:56,467
soule? Are you
hooked up with him?

1567
01:28:56,534 --> 01:28:58,501
I hope i haven't said
anything i shouldn't.

1568
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:02,100
Just to know you've had my name
on your lips gives me pleasure.

1569
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:04,501
You shouldn't be angry
with colonel maroon.

1570
01:29:04,567 --> 01:29:05,734
He's on your side.

1571
01:29:05,801 --> 01:29:07,634
I distinctly heard his
voice say that he thought

1572
01:29:07,701 --> 01:29:09,634
you were more clever
than any of them.

1573
01:29:09,701 --> 01:29:11,567
By that time,
they were shouting.

1574
01:29:11,634 --> 01:29:14,100
When i was talking to mr. Soule
this morning on the piazza,

1575
01:29:14,167 --> 01:29:17,234
i thought his voice sounded like
the one who was disputing mr. Maroon.

1576
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:19,534
Mr. Maroon was telling him
he had some kind of a plan

1577
01:29:19,601 --> 01:29:21,534
that was going to win
this railroad war.

1578
01:29:21,601 --> 01:29:24,033
He was going to offer it
to you and ruin mr. Soule...

1579
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,367
or was it the other way
around?

1580
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:31,334
Oh, oh, dear me...

1581
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,033
i hope you aren't
angry with me.

1582
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:34,567
Oh, dear mr. Van steed,
oh, dear colonel maroon,

1583
01:29:34,634 --> 01:29:36,100
i detest
strong-minded women

1584
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:37,601
who interfere
in men's affairs.

1585
01:29:37,667 --> 01:29:39,667
I understand, ma'am.

1586
01:29:39,734 --> 01:29:42,534
Colonel, possibly you could
run my railroad better than l-

1587
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:45,033
now, gentlemen, this is no
place to discuss business.

1588
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,501
Have you forgotten you've asked
me to have breakfast with you?

1589
01:29:47,567 --> 01:29:49,534
Well, that's
hardly possible.

1590
01:29:49,601 --> 01:29:51,067
I'm having breakfast
over at the track

1591
01:29:51,133 --> 01:29:52,033
with the grooms
and the jockeys.

1592
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:53,434
Oh, what
a delightful surprise!

1593
01:29:53,501 --> 01:29:55,534
Ladies can't eat
in stables.

1594
01:29:55,601 --> 01:29:57,968
Well, this one can.

1595
01:29:59,968 --> 01:30:03,067
Miss clio! You're
not going without me,

1596
01:30:03,133 --> 01:30:04,567
miss clio!

1597
01:30:04,634 --> 01:30:06,267
Let him come.

1598
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:14,567
I do want
to thank you

1599
01:30:14,634 --> 01:30:16,300
for the lovely
pink roses you sent.

1600
01:30:16,367 --> 01:30:17,868
I am glad
you liked them...

1601
01:30:17,934 --> 01:30:20,734
and don't forget,
mrs. Du chenfrais-

1602
01:30:20,801 --> 01:30:22,334
you're dining with me
tonight.

1603
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,234
Delighted.

1604
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:36,033
Cheri,
you're not angry.

1605
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,968
Take your hand off my arm! What
do you think i'm driving? Cattle?

1606
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:41,534
How can you talk to me like that?
No one has ever talked to me-

1607
01:30:41,601 --> 01:30:43,033
it's time they did, then.

1608
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:46,000
Clint, i have such a clever
idea. I'm only trying to help you.

1609
01:30:46,067 --> 01:30:48,000
I'll try to explain this
slow and easy

1610
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:49,567
without losing my temper.

1611
01:30:49,634 --> 01:30:53,000
Really, you should be proud of me.
I'm only thinking of your future.

1612
01:30:53,067 --> 01:30:55,534
Interrupt again, and i'll
smash in your pretty nose.

1613
01:30:55,601 --> 01:30:57,767
I've got some plans
of my own.

1614
01:30:57,834 --> 01:30:59,868
Oh, clint, have you?
What are they?

1615
01:30:59,934 --> 01:31:02,067
And i don't need you
to come busting in.

1616
01:31:02,133 --> 01:31:05,067
Let's see... i'm only a woman.
I don't have a right to think.

1617
01:31:05,133 --> 01:31:07,033
I've got every respect
for womankind,

1618
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,534
but in texas, it's the men
who wear the pants.

1619
01:31:09,601 --> 01:31:11,067
I was up here
wearing mine.

1620
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:12,868
Now you come along, starting
trouble, acting downright loco.

1621
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:14,567
What have i done?
I only just arrived.

1622
01:31:14,634 --> 01:31:17,067
And then what? Screeching
out of hotel windows,

1623
01:31:17,133 --> 01:31:20,067
peaches and champagne
in the middle of the day,

1624
01:31:20,133 --> 01:31:21,534
pulling
the sleeping beauty act,

1625
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:24,000
sashaying out telling the
doggonedest mess of lies.

1626
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:26,000
You planning
to keep this up?

1627
01:31:26,067 --> 01:31:28,000
Yes. I've thought of the
most wonderful things.

1628
01:31:28,067 --> 01:31:30,501
It's going to be better
and better all the time.

1629
01:31:30,567 --> 01:31:32,534
I don't give a hang
what you do

1630
01:31:32,601 --> 01:31:35,534
as long as you keep your
nose out of my affairs.

1631
01:31:35,601 --> 01:31:38,033
I can be nagged by women, i can be
fooled by women, i can be coaxed by women,

1632
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,033
but no woman's
going to run me.

1633
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,000
You just pin back those
pretty ears of yours

1634
01:31:42,067 --> 01:31:43,901
and take heed
of what i'm saying.

1635
01:31:43,968 --> 01:31:46,834
Cheri, i think that even
when i marry someone else,

1636
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:48,501
i'll always
love you best.

1637
01:31:48,567 --> 01:31:52,033
Heaven help the man that
takes up with you for life.

1638
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,501
I wouldn't be in his shoes,
not for a million.

1639
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:56,767
I'm hoping he'll have
much more than a million.

1640
01:31:56,834 --> 01:31:58,534
If you mean
little bartholomew,

1641
01:31:58,601 --> 01:32:00,901
his mama brushes girls
like you aside like flies.

1642
01:32:00,968 --> 01:32:03,033
His mama isn't here,
cheri.

1643
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,567
When she hears what you're
doing to her baby boy,

1644
01:32:05,634 --> 01:32:06,901
she will be,
soon enough.

1645
01:32:06,968 --> 01:32:08,367
And he'll pay heed
to her, too.

1646
01:32:08,434 --> 01:32:09,834
He was brought up
prim and proper.

1647
01:32:09,901 --> 01:32:12,834
He was brought up
by a woman

1648
01:32:12,901 --> 01:32:15,067
who was stronger and more
possessive than he-his mother.

1649
01:32:15,133 --> 01:32:17,601
I'll be stronger and
more possessive than she.

1650
01:32:17,667 --> 01:32:19,567
And cleverer.
You'll see, cheri.

1651
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:22,367
Women are the most unmoral
people there are.

1652
01:32:22,434 --> 01:32:24,000
Cheri,
darling, darling.

1653
01:32:24,067 --> 01:32:25,300
Attention!

1654
01:32:25,367 --> 01:32:26,534
Aah!

1655
01:32:32,067 --> 01:32:34,100
Jumping catfish!
You see what you do to me?

1656
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:36,400
I don't know whether
i'm going or coming.

1657
01:32:45,501 --> 01:32:49,033
You intend to stay over in this
country long, mrs. Du chenfrais?

1658
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:52,033
That depends, mr. Van steed,
upon so many, many things.

1659
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,234
On what, for instance?

1660
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,434
Things you'd consider
quite sordid, i'm afraid.

1661
01:32:55,501 --> 01:32:56,434
Sordid?

1662
01:32:56,501 --> 01:32:58,133
Everything is so
expensive over here.

1663
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,534
It takes so many francs to
make one american dollar.

1664
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:03,868
You should never have to
worry about such things.

1665
01:33:03,934 --> 01:33:05,534
You're so-

1666
01:33:05,601 --> 01:33:09,033
you should have everything
that's beautl-

1667
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:11,067
well, beautiful.

1668
01:33:12,601 --> 01:33:14,667
You're so kind.

1669
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:19,501
You smoke cigarettes,
mrs. Du chenfrais?

1670
01:33:19,567 --> 01:33:23,467
Well, i've never seen a lady
smoke a cigarette before.

1671
01:33:23,534 --> 01:33:25,467
It's a continental
custom, i suppose.

1672
01:33:25,534 --> 01:33:28,200
I've smoked since
i was a baby.

1673
01:33:31,067 --> 01:33:32,834
Yes, but...
people will...

1674
01:33:32,901 --> 01:33:35,434
well, in a hotel,
people talk.

1675
01:33:35,501 --> 01:33:38,000
How kind of you to
protect me like that.

1676
01:33:38,067 --> 01:33:39,968
I'm not used
to american ways,

1677
01:33:40,033 --> 01:33:41,667
but a cigarette...

1678
01:33:41,734 --> 01:33:43,934
a cigarette is sometimes
cozy when one is lonely.

1679
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,868
Don't you find it so,
mr. Van steed?

1680
01:33:45,934 --> 01:33:47,334
I'm a cigar
smoker myself.

1681
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,000
Oh, but of course.

1682
01:33:49,067 --> 01:33:50,934
So masculine.

1683
01:33:54,601 --> 01:33:57,033
I shouldn't think you'd be
lonely, mrs. Du chenfrais.

1684
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,534
You're so popular
and...

1685
01:33:58,601 --> 01:34:01,267
well, a woman
of the world.

1686
01:34:04,567 --> 01:34:06,501
Oh,
mrs. Du chenfrais!

1687
01:34:06,567 --> 01:34:08,267
Have i
said something?

1688
01:34:10,067 --> 01:34:12,767
A woman of the world.

1689
01:34:14,167 --> 01:34:16,567
Imagine for yourself if your
dear sister, for example,

1690
01:34:16,634 --> 01:34:19,567
would suddenly find herself
a widow and alone in paris,

1691
01:34:19,634 --> 01:34:22,968
alone with only a servant
or two and knowing no one.

1692
01:34:23,033 --> 01:34:27,000
She follows the way to which she is
accustomed in her old loved america.

1693
01:34:27,067 --> 01:34:29,234
Is that a woman
of the world?

1694
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:32,734
Oh, mrs. Du chenfrais-
clio, i...

1695
01:34:34,567 --> 01:34:36,000
you called me clio.

1696
01:34:36,067 --> 01:34:38,434
How dear, how good...

1697
01:34:38,501 --> 01:34:40,501
how friendly.

1698
01:34:40,567 --> 01:34:42,501
What?

1699
01:34:42,567 --> 01:34:45,467
You're such a help to me.

1700
01:34:45,534 --> 01:34:46,968
Help? I?

1701
01:34:47,033 --> 01:34:51,033
You can't guess how much
i would like to do for you.

1702
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,534
All i can say is that your
friendship is the most beautiful thing

1703
01:34:53,601 --> 01:34:55,534
that ever happened
to me.

1704
01:35:05,434 --> 01:35:08,734
Shall we go in?
The music's started.

1705
01:35:21,067 --> 01:35:22,467
Colonel maroon.

1706
01:35:22,534 --> 01:35:24,200
Countess.

1707
01:35:37,634 --> 01:35:39,968
We might as well
get rid of this.

1708
01:35:40,033 --> 01:35:41,968
Van steed
won't be here now.

1709
01:35:42,033 --> 01:35:44,000
I saw him on the arm
of the countess.

1710
01:35:44,067 --> 01:35:46,868
You could have your poker game
if i could have the other arm.

1711
01:35:46,934 --> 01:35:49,501
Van seems to be going all
the way for this french girl.

1712
01:35:49,567 --> 01:35:52,501
Or is the french girl
going for him?

1713
01:35:52,567 --> 01:35:53,934
Before he's through,

1714
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
he might find that more
expensive than poker.

1715
01:35:57,067 --> 01:35:58,767
500.

1716
01:36:01,601 --> 01:36:03,234
I'll tilt you
1,000.

1717
01:36:04,167 --> 01:36:05,534
Are they that
good, colonel?

1718
01:36:05,601 --> 01:36:07,667
You can throw in
a handful of stock

1719
01:36:07,734 --> 01:36:09,767
in that saratoga
trunk line of yours

1720
01:36:09,834 --> 01:36:11,467
if you're short of chips.

1721
01:36:11,567 --> 01:36:13,534
Looks like it won't be
worth much nohow

1722
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:16,000
when soule and his crowd
gets through with it.

1723
01:36:16,067 --> 01:36:17,634
Why do you
want it?

1724
01:36:17,701 --> 01:36:19,033
Why are you
interested?

1725
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,033
If i had it, i wouldn't let
anybody take it away from me.

1726
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,467
Leastways,
not without a scrap.

1727
01:36:22,534 --> 01:36:24,968
And how do you propose to do that?

1728
01:36:25,033 --> 01:36:26,667
You don't understand
all this fight involves.

1729
01:36:26,734 --> 01:36:27,968
It's tied up
in politics.

1730
01:36:28,033 --> 01:36:29,601
Soule's crowd has
sewed up the law courts.

1731
01:36:29,667 --> 01:36:31,667
Law? Where
i come from,

1732
01:36:31,734 --> 01:36:33,501
possession is
nine points of that.

1733
01:36:33,567 --> 01:36:34,634
They've got
the legislature,

1734
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:36,133
and they've
manipulated the stock.

1735
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,422
Even down in texas,
we know that watering stock

1736
01:36:38,423 --> 01:36:40,367
don't only mean
just giving the cows a drink.

1737
01:36:40,434 --> 01:36:41,501
But you're right.

1738
01:36:41,567 --> 01:36:43,501
All that stuff-
dirty politics-

1739
01:36:43,567 --> 01:36:46,000
that ain't up my alley...

1740
01:36:46,067 --> 01:36:48,000
but fighting is.

1741
01:36:48,067 --> 01:36:50,000
I've never seen one yet

1742
01:36:50,067 --> 01:36:52,167
that wasn't won by
being quicker on the draw.

1743
01:36:52,234 --> 01:36:53,968
I'd fight them
barehanded-

1744
01:36:54,033 --> 01:36:56,000
same old plan
we used out west

1745
01:36:56,067 --> 01:36:58,467
when the sheepmen tried to run
the cattlemen off the range.

1746
01:36:58,534 --> 01:37:00,501
Soule's crowd
is wrecking your railroad.

1747
01:37:00,567 --> 01:37:03,033
You've got to keep it running
or lose your franchise.

1748
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:05,534
I'd battle them bloody.
I'd run them off the range.

1749
01:37:05,601 --> 01:37:07,567
Lordy, lordy,
i think maybe you would.

1750
01:37:07,634 --> 01:37:10,033
Where have you been
hiding this man?

1751
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,300
I'd get me a bunch of boys
together, the real hard-muscled kind.

1752
01:37:12,367 --> 01:37:14,501
There's a lot of them
down where i come from

1753
01:37:14,567 --> 01:37:16,334
that don't like railroads any
more than they do rattlers.

1754
01:37:20,033 --> 01:37:21,968
Worse.
It's the wild east.

1755
01:37:22,033 --> 01:37:23,767
We hang men down there
for less crimes

1756
01:37:23,834 --> 01:37:25,934
than you boys do to
each other just in fun.

1757
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,434
What can we lose that
we aren't losing now?

1758
01:37:29,501 --> 01:37:32,234
Maybe we'd better let this
minority stockholder in

1759
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,501
just to take care of us.

1760
01:37:33,567 --> 01:37:36,133
All right, it will cost
you all a fistful of stock.

1761
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,234
A big fistful.

1762
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,467
It's worth it, colonel,
if you can do this.

1763
01:37:39,534 --> 01:37:40,734
I'll do it.

1764
01:37:40,801 --> 01:37:42,868
I'll go the whole hog
to put my brand

1765
01:37:42,934 --> 01:37:44,434
on that crowd that
came through texas.

1766
01:37:44,501 --> 01:37:46,501
I've got a little score
of my own to settle.

1767
01:37:46,567 --> 01:37:49,467
Win this, and you won't have to
stop with any fistful of stock.

1768
01:37:49,534 --> 01:37:51,501
I'll take you along with
me, right up the line.

1769
01:37:51,567 --> 01:37:53,000
I ought to warn you... likely,
i'll have the whole railroad

1770
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:54,467
before i'm through.

1771
01:37:54,534 --> 01:37:56,467
Colonel, i think
you're my boy.

1772
01:37:56,534 --> 01:38:00,734
Just hang a welcome sign on the front
door of that house of yours on wall street.

1773
01:38:00,801 --> 01:38:02,968
You've just acquired
yourself a partner.

1774
01:38:19,234 --> 01:38:20,133
Morning,
colonel.

1775
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,601
Hey, what's up?

1776
01:38:21,667 --> 01:38:24,434
The cats seem to be meowing
louder than ordinary this morning.

1777
01:38:24,501 --> 01:38:27,934
Colonel maroon, you kill
me the way you put things.

1778
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,133
It's madame van steed.

1779
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,834
Madame van steed
has arrived.

1780
01:38:30,901 --> 01:38:32,400
You don't say.

1781
01:38:49,834 --> 01:38:50,968
Battle 'em bloody!

1782
01:38:51,033 --> 01:38:52,000
Run them up the range!

1783
01:38:52,067 --> 01:38:54,267
Son of a gun!
Ha ha ha!

1784
01:38:54,334 --> 01:38:56,367
I listen to
all the poker games.

1785
01:38:56,434 --> 01:38:57,400
I'm just keyhole-sized.

1786
01:38:57,467 --> 01:38:58,701
Quit talking!

1787
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:00,968
Wranglers and poker games-who
cares about all that?

1788
01:39:01,033 --> 01:39:02,467
Where's mr. Clint
all the time?

1789
01:39:02,534 --> 01:39:03,501
Where have you been?

1790
01:39:04,634 --> 01:39:06,801
You ain't touched
your lunch, honey.

1791
01:39:09,501 --> 01:39:10,901
Mr. Clint.

1792
01:39:13,067 --> 01:39:15,000
Saw the bellboy
stagger

1793
01:39:15,067 --> 01:39:17,968
and thought i'd help him with his load.

1794
01:39:18,033 --> 01:39:19,000
Bartholomew's
splurging.

1795
01:39:19,067 --> 01:39:21,467
Flowers. That's
a northerner for you.

1796
01:39:21,534 --> 01:39:23,501
Why ain't he sent you
jewelry?

1797
01:39:23,567 --> 01:39:25,234
To take jewelry
from a man

1798
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,200
that's not your husband,
that isn't nice.

1799
01:39:27,267 --> 01:39:30,367
My ma never had any
husband any more than you,

1800
01:39:30,434 --> 01:39:31,567
but she got jewelry-

1801
01:39:31,634 --> 01:39:33,033
diamonds and ruby rings
and large stone necklaces.

1802
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:35,000
I'll give you
my diamond stickpin

1803
01:39:35,067 --> 01:39:36,634
if you want it, honey.

1804
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:48,000
How are you making out
with little bart?

1805
01:39:48,067 --> 01:39:49,334
Wonderfully.

1806
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,200
That's fine, countess.

1807
01:39:52,901 --> 01:39:56,133
I reckon i just wasn't
worth frettin' about

1808
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,100
that day
at the french market.

1809
01:39:58,167 --> 01:40:01,434
Where have you been,
clint? Why don't i see you?

1810
01:40:01,501 --> 01:40:02,868
Business-
playing railroad,

1811
01:40:02,934 --> 01:40:04,367
gettinne,
too.

1812
01:40:04,434 --> 01:40:06,400
You know, i'd like to
take you around, honey,

1813
01:40:06,467 --> 01:40:08,200
but i had a little
matter to attend to.

1814
01:40:08,267 --> 01:40:11,033
Now, bart, he'd come a
- running if he knew you wanted to go out.

1815
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:13,567
Why don't you send
cupidon over with a note?

1816
01:40:13,634 --> 01:40:14,567
How dare you!

1817
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,968
What's up? Have i said something-

1818
01:40:17,033 --> 01:40:19,033
how dare you say to me
that you're busy

1819
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:23,033
and suggest that i go around asking
other men to take me here and there?

1820
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,534
Hold on. I didn't say
anything about other men.

1821
01:40:25,601 --> 01:40:28,634
I said bart. He's the man
you're fixing to marry.

1822
01:40:28,701 --> 01:40:30,400
Oh. So that's it.
You're jealous.

1823
01:40:30,467 --> 01:40:32,501
Yeah. Leastways, i
would be if i had time,

1824
01:40:32,567 --> 01:40:34,033
but i'm busy
as a sheepdog.

1825
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:37,067
It's too bad your plan
isn't working out so well.

1826
01:40:37,133 --> 01:40:38,534
Whose plan isn't?

1827
01:40:38,601 --> 01:40:41,200
In a game like yours,
you got to work quick

1828
01:40:41,267 --> 01:40:43,033
and get out before
they find the pea

1829
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:44,534
under
the walnut shell.

1830
01:40:44,601 --> 01:40:47,067
Yeah. It's too bad
you're too late.

1831
01:40:47,133 --> 01:40:48,567
Too late?

1832
01:40:48,634 --> 01:40:51,067
I sure hate
to tell you.

1833
01:40:51,133 --> 01:40:52,567
It seems
downright cruel.

1834
01:40:52,634 --> 01:40:54,167
Bart's mama's come.

1835
01:40:54,234 --> 01:40:55,901
Mama van steed.

1836
01:40:58,033 --> 01:40:59,434
Yes, ma'am,
countess.

1837
01:40:59,501 --> 01:41:01,501
The queen of saratoga, the head cat.

1838
01:41:01,567 --> 01:41:05,100
The lioness has come
to defend her cub.

1839
01:41:05,167 --> 01:41:06,234
When?

1840
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,701
She descended this
morning, they tell me,

1841
01:41:07,767 --> 01:41:09,968
with her claws showing
and her fangs bared.

1842
01:41:10,033 --> 01:41:12,968
The other tabbies are paying court
to her on the piazza right now.

1843
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:15,501
I wonder how your pretty
skin's gonna look in ribbons?

1844
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:19,701
Angelique,
get my things.

1845
01:41:19,767 --> 01:41:21,234
Cupidon,
get the carriage

1846
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,167
and take miss clio
for a drive.

1847
01:41:24,234 --> 01:41:26,601
I think she'll need
some fresh air.

1848
01:41:26,667 --> 01:41:28,334
You betcha.

1849
01:42:04,634 --> 01:42:08,033
Mrs. Du chenfrais
is coming now, mother.

1850
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,767
De trigononai du chenfrais
de fiddlesticks.

1851
01:42:15,834 --> 01:42:18,834
She's an adventuress.
It's written all over her.

1852
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:24,467
Good morning,
countess.

1853
01:42:24,534 --> 01:42:26,601
Colonel maroon.

1854
01:42:26,667 --> 01:42:27,834
Fetch her.

1855
01:42:27,901 --> 01:42:29,467
Oh, mrs. Du chenfrais.

1856
01:42:31,234 --> 01:42:33,701
My mother says she would
very much like to meet you.

1857
01:42:33,767 --> 01:42:36,167
She has heard
so much about you.

1858
01:42:36,234 --> 01:42:37,667
I would be enchanted to
meet your dear mother.

1859
01:42:37,734 --> 01:42:39,267
Good morning, countess.
Comment ca va?

1860
01:42:39,334 --> 01:42:40,801
Bon jour,
madame.

1861
01:42:40,868 --> 01:42:42,300
Good morning,
clarissa.

1862
01:42:42,367 --> 01:42:43,300
Good morning.

1863
01:42:43,367 --> 01:42:45,234
May i present
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1864
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,801
How do you do?

1865
01:42:46,868 --> 01:42:49,801
I hear you call yourself a countess.

1866
01:42:49,868 --> 01:42:52,300
No. I call myself
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1867
01:42:52,367 --> 01:42:53,300
Very clever.

1868
01:42:53,367 --> 01:42:54,968
Won't you
sit down?

1869
01:42:55,033 --> 01:42:56,701
You say you've been here
before, they tell me.

1870
01:42:56,767 --> 01:42:59,767
No. My dear husband
was here once.

1871
01:42:59,834 --> 01:43:01,667
Dear edouard-
the late comte.

1872
01:43:01,734 --> 01:43:03,234
That ninny roscoe bean

1873
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,033
couldn't find
your husband's signature

1874
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:07,634
in the hotel register.
Isn't that odd?

1875
01:43:07,701 --> 01:43:08,868
His signature?

1876
01:43:08,934 --> 01:43:11,767
I've been coming to the
saratoga hotel for years.

1877
01:43:11,834 --> 01:43:13,934
I've met every
well-known person

1878
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,767
that ever stopped here-
in my day, that is.

1879
01:43:16,834 --> 01:43:19,567
And i've searched the
registers, old and new...

1880
01:43:19,634 --> 01:43:21,067
but no
comte du chenfrais.

1881
01:43:21,133 --> 01:43:23,534
Are you sure
he stayed here?

1882
01:43:23,601 --> 01:43:24,667
Eh?

1883
01:43:24,734 --> 01:43:26,167
Incognito.

1884
01:43:26,234 --> 01:43:28,567
When a french diplomat is in
america on affairs of state,

1885
01:43:28,634 --> 01:43:30,567
it's sometimes wise
to discard titles.

1886
01:43:30,634 --> 01:43:32,067
Well, i'm quite sure
mother doesn't mean-

1887
01:43:32,133 --> 01:43:33,567
i'm quite sure that
mother does mean.

1888
01:43:33,634 --> 01:43:36,567
She doesn't mean a thing,
do you, clarissa?

1889
01:43:36,634 --> 01:43:38,367
I always did tell
dear etienne

1890
01:43:38,434 --> 01:43:40,567
that his passion for shunning
the limelight was silly.

1891
01:43:40,634 --> 01:43:42,901
Etienne?
And who is etienne?

1892
01:43:42,968 --> 01:43:45,734
Her husband.
I knew him well.

1893
01:43:45,801 --> 01:43:47,200
Didn't you say
edouard?

1894
01:43:47,267 --> 01:43:49,367
His intimates
called him etienne.

1895
01:43:49,434 --> 01:43:51,300
A pet name.

1896
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,467
Clarissa, i always say
it doesn't pay to inquire

1897
01:43:55,534 --> 01:43:58,167
too closely into the background
of us summer saratoga folk.

1898
01:43:58,234 --> 01:44:00,000
Take you, clarissa.
You call yourself a lady,

1899
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:02,400
but that doesn't necessarily
mean that you are one, does it?

1900
01:44:02,467 --> 01:44:05,400
I advise you to stay
out of this, sophie.

1901
01:44:05,467 --> 01:44:07,234
I was merely going to
remark in all innocence

1902
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:08,567
that my family
can remember

1903
01:44:08,634 --> 01:44:10,734
when your family
climbed out of the gutter.

1904
01:44:12,534 --> 01:44:13,934
Come,
mrs. Du chenfrais.

1905
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,801
Shall we have
a bit of a chat?

1906
01:44:15,868 --> 01:44:17,300
That would be
charming.

1907
01:44:17,367 --> 01:44:19,667
Enchanted to have met you,
madame van steed.

1908
01:44:19,734 --> 01:44:23,434
You're all that your dear son
has led me to expect.

1909
01:44:29,133 --> 01:44:31,000
I hope you weren't
too sharp

1910
01:44:31,067 --> 01:44:32,434
with that very
provincial old lady.

1911
01:44:32,501 --> 01:44:34,467
Provincial old lady?
She's an old hellcat.

1912
01:44:34,534 --> 01:44:37,501
Thank you very much for
being helpful. Good-bye.

1913
01:44:37,567 --> 01:44:40,400
Nonsense, my girl. I want to
talk to you. It's important.

1914
01:44:40,467 --> 01:44:41,501
In the garden?

1915
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:44,601
No. In your room.
We can talk better there.

1916
01:44:49,501 --> 01:44:51,634
If you'd asked me
who i'd rather be

1917
01:44:51,701 --> 01:44:54,634
than anyone else in the
world at this minute,

1918
01:44:54,701 --> 01:44:56,133
i'd say you.

1919
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,634
Me? But why?

1920
01:44:57,701 --> 01:44:59,601
No reason.
No reason, my girl.

1921
01:44:59,667 --> 01:45:02,634
Except that you're young
and beautiful and smart,

1922
01:45:02,701 --> 01:45:05,100
and you've got two dashing
young men in love with you.

1923
01:45:05,167 --> 01:45:07,534
At least, poor bart would
dash if that old harridan

1924
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:10,934
would let go of his coattails
long enough to let him dash.

1925
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,400
And you'd be very rich
if you use some sense.

1926
01:45:12,467 --> 01:45:15,634
Angelique,
bring the coffee in here.

1927
01:45:15,701 --> 01:45:17,367
Yes, ma'am.

1928
01:45:18,367 --> 01:45:21,033
Just what is it
you want of me?

1929
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:22,000
Money.

1930
01:45:22,067 --> 01:45:23,400
I have no money.

1931
01:45:23,467 --> 01:45:24,534
But you will have.
How?

1932
01:45:24,601 --> 01:45:25,901
Listening to me.

1933
01:45:25,968 --> 01:45:28,467
You have no money. Why haven't
you listened to yourself?

1934
01:45:28,534 --> 01:45:32,133
Because i'm not you. I explained
that to you a minute ago.

1935
01:45:36,167 --> 01:45:38,234
Tell your woman
to shut the door.

1936
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,400
Doesn't matter.

1937
01:45:39,467 --> 01:45:41,033
She knows
everything.

1938
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,400
She never talks.

1939
01:45:42,467 --> 01:45:43,667
No, thank you.

1940
01:45:43,734 --> 01:45:46,601
If you mean to harm me,
she'd be likely to kill you.

1941
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:49,067
She'd make a little figure
like you out of soap,

1942
01:45:49,133 --> 01:45:52,000
and she'd stick pins into it,
and you'd sicken and die.

1943
01:45:52,067 --> 01:45:55,434
Not i. I've had pins
stuck in me all my life-

1944
01:45:55,501 --> 01:45:58,000
knives and everything
up to pickaxes.

1945
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,534
All my life, mrs. Bellop,
i've been very direct.

1946
01:46:02,601 --> 01:46:04,501
If i wanted
to do a thing

1947
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:07,133
and it was possible, i did
it. I say what i want to say.

1948
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:09,634
That old lady
on the piazza dislikes me.

1949
01:46:09,701 --> 01:46:12,467
She makes no pretense.
I admire her for it.

1950
01:46:12,534 --> 01:46:14,734
I shall be grateful
if you'll be as honest.

1951
01:46:14,801 --> 01:46:16,300
You're right.
She hates you.

1952
01:46:16,367 --> 01:46:18,033
She wants to run you
out of saratoga,

1953
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:19,567
and she'll do it
unless...

1954
01:46:19,634 --> 01:46:20,567
unless?

1955
01:46:20,634 --> 01:46:21,934
Look, my girl,

1956
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,434
i know that you're no more
the countess de trumprechoochoo

1957
01:46:24,501 --> 01:46:26,000
than
i'm queen victoria.

1958
01:46:26,067 --> 01:46:28,033
But if i say you are,
if i stand up for you

1959
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,567
against that old buzzard and her crew,

1960
01:46:29,634 --> 01:46:31,434
the world will
believe you are.

1961
01:46:31,501 --> 01:46:34,434
I've watched you, and i'll say
this, you've been wonderful-

1962
01:46:34,501 --> 01:46:36,234
bold and dramatic
and believable.

1963
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:37,634
But from now on,

1964
01:46:37,701 --> 01:46:39,501
you're gonna need a
strong arm behind you,

1965
01:46:39,567 --> 01:46:42,033
and that handsome texan's
arm isn't gonna be enough.

1966
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:43,601
It's got to be
a woman

1967
01:46:43,667 --> 01:46:46,000
that's smarter than old lady van steed

1968
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:47,467
and somebody that
she's scared of.

1969
01:46:47,534 --> 01:46:49,000
That's me.
You saw it.

1970
01:46:49,067 --> 01:46:50,501
I look like
a wash woman,

1971
01:46:50,567 --> 01:46:52,100
but i've got family
and influence,

1972
01:46:52,167 --> 01:46:54,000
and all she's got are
two generations of money.

1973
01:46:54,067 --> 01:46:56,868
What do you want?

1974
01:46:56,934 --> 01:46:58,567
I know my way
around this world.

1975
01:46:58,634 --> 01:47:01,000
I know what it is
to be very rich,

1976
01:47:01,067 --> 01:47:03,801
and i know what it is
to be very poor.

1977
01:47:03,868 --> 01:47:05,601
I've lived on nothing
for years... in luxury.

1978
01:47:05,667 --> 01:47:06,801
Blackmail?

1979
01:47:06,868 --> 01:47:10,133
Oh, give me credit for
being smarter than that.

1980
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:12,634
I make certain hotels
fashionable by touting for them.

1981
01:47:12,701 --> 01:47:14,133
I put saratoga
on the map.

1982
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:17,133
I made newport, though i must
say i can't bear the place.

1983
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,434
I've been everywhere. I know
europe, and i know america.

1984
01:47:19,501 --> 01:47:22,067
And if i give a party that
somebody else pays for,

1985
01:47:22,133 --> 01:47:23,868
everybody comes
because i'm giving it.

1986
01:47:23,934 --> 01:47:26,067
Don't ask me why.
I don't know.

1987
01:47:26,133 --> 01:47:27,567
I've got
nothing to lose

1988
01:47:27,634 --> 01:47:29,067
because
i live by my wits.

1989
01:47:29,133 --> 01:47:31,067
They can't take
those away from me.

1990
01:47:31,133 --> 01:47:33,067
And i say and i do
as i please

1991
01:47:33,133 --> 01:47:34,834
because i'm not
afraid of anybody.

1992
01:47:34,901 --> 01:47:36,400
It's a grand
feeling.

1993
01:47:36,467 --> 01:47:39,434
In a way,
you're just like i am.

1994
01:47:39,501 --> 01:47:40,834
I've always-

1995
01:47:40,901 --> 01:47:42,267
i know
all about you.

1996
01:47:42,334 --> 01:47:43,901
I have connections
in new orleans.

1997
01:47:43,968 --> 01:47:46,601
How much do you want?

1998
01:47:46,667 --> 01:47:48,067
Your name
was clio dulaine,

1999
01:47:48,133 --> 01:47:50,567
and now you want it to be
mrs. Bartholomew van steed.

2000
01:47:50,634 --> 01:47:53,067
I think you can get him
with my help,

2001
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:54,601
though
why you want him

2002
01:47:54,667 --> 01:47:56,100
with that texan
around-

2003
01:47:56,167 --> 01:47:58,000
me, i'd marry him though
he hadn't a penny.

2004
01:47:58,067 --> 01:48:01,000
Those shoulders
and small through the hips,

2005
01:48:01,067 --> 01:48:03,968
and the way
he looks at you-

2006
01:48:04,033 --> 01:48:06,300
oh, me!
Always was a fool.

2007
01:48:06,367 --> 01:48:08,501
I'll take 25,000 down
on the day of the wedding

2008
01:48:08,567 --> 01:48:11,133
and 10,000 a year for life.
I don't want to be grasping.

2009
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:14,334
How do you know that
i can't do this alone?

2010
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,334
Try it.

2011
01:48:16,601 --> 01:48:18,367
Come in.

2012
01:48:20,167 --> 01:48:24,567
Edouard. Etienne.

2013
01:48:24,634 --> 01:48:26,534
Are you two
plotting something?

2014
01:48:26,601 --> 01:48:29,033
You look guilty
as all get out.

2015
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,968
If i were only 25
years younger, my boy-

2016
01:48:32,033 --> 01:48:34,868
mrs. Bellop has offered
to be my chaperone.

2017
01:48:34,934 --> 01:48:36,901
A little late,
i'd say.

2018
01:48:36,968 --> 01:48:38,901
Not too late,
we hope.

2019
01:48:38,968 --> 01:48:40,868
Not too late
for what?

2020
01:48:40,934 --> 01:48:42,400
For social
success

2021
01:48:42,467 --> 01:48:43,868
and marriage
to someone

2022
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:45,934
who's really
mad about her,

2023
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,434
with
your blessing.

2024
01:48:47,501 --> 01:48:48,934
She's got that now.

2025
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,734
I'll see you later.
I got to pack my bag.

2026
01:48:52,801 --> 01:48:54,367
Pardon me.

2027
01:49:00,968 --> 01:49:02,467
Clint!

2028
01:49:03,667 --> 01:49:06,267
I almost forgot to
tell you, honey.

2029
01:49:06,334 --> 01:49:08,067
I'm taking
a little trip.

2030
01:49:08,133 --> 01:49:09,567
Where?
Where are you going?

2031
01:49:09,634 --> 01:49:10,734
Albany.

2032
01:49:10,801 --> 01:49:13,067
What for? You used
to tell me everything.

2033
01:49:13,133 --> 01:49:15,100
What are you
keeping from me?

2034
01:49:15,167 --> 01:49:17,133
On business.
A couple of days.

2035
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,634
Business?
Now, what business?

2036
01:49:18,701 --> 01:49:21,100
Cupidon will
take care of you.

2037
01:49:21,167 --> 01:49:22,868
And bart.

2038
01:49:24,701 --> 01:49:27,300
Want me
to go with you?

2039
01:49:27,367 --> 01:49:29,934
Now, look here, honey, you
can't go traveling around

2040
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,200
with colonel
maroon,

2041
01:49:31,267 --> 01:49:32,767
a respectable widow
like you.

2042
01:49:32,834 --> 01:49:34,834
You set out to catch
yourself a millionaire.

2043
01:49:34,901 --> 01:49:36,634
You got him
roped and tied.

2044
01:49:36,701 --> 01:49:39,601
Now all you got to do is
cinch the saddle down on him.

2045
01:49:39,667 --> 01:49:40,834
Poor little bart.

2046
01:49:40,901 --> 01:49:43,000
In his place,
i sure would feel cheap

2047
01:49:43,067 --> 01:49:45,634
to think i was being married
just for my money.

2048
01:49:45,701 --> 01:49:46,934
You never need
to fear.

2049
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,501
If you win $500 at cards,
you feel yourself rich.

2050
01:49:49,567 --> 01:49:53,033
That sweet little woman in texas
has just such ambitions, i'm sure-

2051
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:54,968
the one who makes those
ravishing white ties,

2052
01:49:55,033 --> 01:49:56,501
those blue
forget-me-nots.

2053
01:49:56,567 --> 01:49:58,567
Sure is comical
how a woman likes

2054
01:49:58,634 --> 01:50:01,033
to put her mark
on a man with a needle.

2055
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:02,567
You couldn't rest
nor wait

2056
01:50:02,634 --> 01:50:05,067
till you had me crawling
with all those fancy initials

2057
01:50:05,133 --> 01:50:06,567
on my shirts
and handkerchiefs.

2058
01:50:06,634 --> 01:50:10,067
I look to wake up some day and
find a big "c" branded on my rump.

2059
01:50:10,133 --> 01:50:13,067
Bart hasn't asked me
to marry him.

2060
01:50:13,133 --> 01:50:15,167
He isn't
the asking kind.

2061
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:17,234
You got to tell him.

2062
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,634
Sure was different
in new orleans.

2063
01:50:37,701 --> 01:50:40,601
Why can't it be
like that here?

2064
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:43,634
You were mighty sweet
those days.

2065
01:50:43,701 --> 01:50:45,367
Ornery,
but mighty sweet.

2066
01:50:51,734 --> 01:50:54,634
Clint, cheri.
You're not leaving me.

2067
01:50:54,701 --> 01:50:57,067
Take me with you.

2068
01:50:57,934 --> 01:51:00,567
All the way?
Me the boss?

2069
01:51:09,734 --> 01:51:11,667
When will you be back?

2070
01:51:11,734 --> 01:51:12,801
Why?

2071
01:51:12,868 --> 01:51:16,501
I want you to take me
to the ball saturday.

2072
01:51:16,567 --> 01:51:19,167
I thought you were
fixing to go with bart.

2073
01:51:19,234 --> 01:51:20,667
I was, but...

2074
01:51:20,734 --> 01:51:22,767
better go with him.
Adios, honey.

2075
01:51:22,834 --> 01:51:24,634
And good luck.

2076
01:51:38,701 --> 01:51:40,133
I know. I heard,

2077
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:43,334
and i won't pretend
that it was accidental.

2078
01:51:44,767 --> 01:51:46,133
Why doesn't
he understand?

2079
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,634
What man ever did?

2080
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,133
It isn't the money!

2081
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:51,133
I want security,
protection, respectability-

2082
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:53,133
things that have been very scarce

2083
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:56,200
on my side of the
family, even my own mama.

2084
01:51:56,267 --> 01:51:59,000
I know about your mother and her
mother and all the other generations

2085
01:51:59,067 --> 01:52:00,901
of getting the dirty end
of the bargain.

2086
01:52:00,968 --> 01:52:03,234
Mama and all she
stood in new orleans

2087
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,667
and all that
i saw in paris,

2088
01:52:05,734 --> 01:52:08,033
that was something to
make one really sick!

2089
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:10,067
I won't be treated
like her!

2090
01:52:10,133 --> 01:52:11,300
I won't! I won't!

2091
01:52:11,367 --> 01:52:14,901
No need to, if you follow my advice.

2092
01:52:16,067 --> 01:52:17,501
No, mrs. Bellop.

2093
01:52:17,567 --> 01:52:20,434
I think i'll just
go on alone.

2094
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:23,400
I don't want you
to think i'm ungrateful.

2095
01:52:23,467 --> 01:52:26,434
You've been honest,
and you've been good.

2096
01:52:26,501 --> 01:52:27,901
Here. Please take this.

2097
01:52:27,968 --> 01:52:30,934
You're the only woman
who's shown me kindness.

2098
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,601
See here, clio. I'm going
to stand behind you anyway-

2099
01:52:33,667 --> 01:52:35,601
just in case-
because i like you,

2100
01:52:35,667 --> 01:52:37,634
and i don't like
clarissa van steed.

2101
01:52:37,701 --> 01:52:40,501
And just to prove what a
sentimental fool i can be,

2102
01:52:40,567 --> 01:52:42,033
here's your ring.

2103
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:44,000
Hang onto your jewelry, i always say.

2104
01:52:44,067 --> 01:52:45,734
It's a woman's
best friend.

2105
01:53:05,367 --> 01:53:07,300
Hi, clint.

2106
01:53:07,367 --> 01:53:09,033
Hi, al.
You boys ready?

2107
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,000
Yep.

2108
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:20,767
Get them aboard, al.

2109
01:53:20,834 --> 01:53:22,667
All right, men.
Climb on.

2110
01:53:22,734 --> 01:53:24,634
Now what are you
doing here?

2111
01:53:24,701 --> 01:53:25,968
I came to fight.

2112
01:53:26,033 --> 01:53:28,067
You gonna fight,
i gonna fight, too.

2113
01:53:28,133 --> 01:53:29,567
Did she send you?

2114
01:53:29,634 --> 01:53:31,100
Nah. I run away.

2115
01:53:31,167 --> 01:53:33,300
Doggone if i haven't got
a mind to tan you good.

2116
01:53:33,367 --> 01:53:35,000
How did you know
where i was going?

2117
01:53:35,067 --> 01:53:36,667
I listened at the keyhole.
I heard everything.

2118
01:53:36,734 --> 01:53:38,400
This is gonna be
a fine fight.

2119
01:53:38,467 --> 01:53:40,067
I'm gonna punch 'em
in the stomach.

2120
01:53:40,133 --> 01:53:43,067
I'll learn you to flap those
big ears of yours at keyholes.

2121
01:53:43,133 --> 01:53:44,567
Get on away from here.
Go home!

2122
01:53:44,634 --> 01:53:46,968
Please, mr. Clint,
let me stay.

2123
01:53:47,033 --> 01:53:48,801
I can fight.
I'm strong.

2124
01:53:48,868 --> 01:53:50,534
Get going,
you little half-pint.

2125
01:53:56,367 --> 01:53:58,667
I'm a man,
mr. Clint.

2126
01:53:59,801 --> 01:54:01,968
Now go home and
take care of the womenfolk

2127
01:54:02,033 --> 01:54:03,701
the way i told you.

2128
01:54:12,701 --> 01:54:14,634
Get her rolling, al!

2129
01:54:14,701 --> 01:54:16,133
'Board!

2130
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,901
Pull your shades
down, men!

2131
01:54:47,434 --> 01:54:50,100
Like i said, no guns-
only the butts in a pinch,

2132
01:54:50,167 --> 01:54:53,133
and maybe the other end
if they start shooting first.

2133
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:55,634
Every station between
here and binghamton,

2134
01:54:55,701 --> 01:54:57,100
we're in and out

2135
01:54:57,167 --> 01:54:59,400
before they can
telegraph word ahead.

2136
01:54:59,467 --> 01:55:02,133
We throw them out and leave a
bunch off behind to hold the fort.

2137
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:05,100
When you hear one whistle from
the engine ahead, that means ready.

2138
01:55:05,167 --> 01:55:07,133
When you hear three,
pile out.

2139
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:10,100
Three more, pile on in
and on your way.

2140
01:55:10,167 --> 01:55:11,100
Understand?

2141
01:55:11,167 --> 01:55:12,133
Yeah.
Yeah.

2142
01:55:13,701 --> 01:55:16,167
First stop, boys.
Hold onto your hats.

2143
01:55:44,968 --> 01:55:46,434
Get rolling, al!

2144
01:55:48,501 --> 01:55:51,634
You men, stay here
and hold the fort.

2145
01:56:22,367 --> 01:56:23,467
Bainbridge.

2146
01:56:23,534 --> 01:56:26,601
Only 30 miles to binghamton,
the end of the line.

2147
01:56:26,667 --> 01:56:28,067
Lordy, lordy, lordy.

2148
01:56:28,133 --> 01:56:29,601
Bad?

2149
01:56:29,667 --> 01:56:31,133
What is it?

2150
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,100
Soule's got wind of it.

2151
01:56:33,167 --> 01:56:36,100
He's starting a train
from the other end.

2152
01:56:36,167 --> 01:56:38,100
Better get word to
the colonel if we can.

2153
01:56:38,167 --> 01:56:40,133
Lordy, lordy, when
those two trains meet...

2154
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:43,067
we've got to get him
in this tunnel.

2155
01:56:43,133 --> 01:56:44,534
Now get going!

2156
01:56:44,601 --> 01:56:46,868
'Board!
Come on, get on.

2157
01:56:47,968 --> 01:56:50,000
Don't worry, chief.
We'll pile 'em up,

2158
01:56:50,067 --> 01:56:52,067
and they'll never
get to binghamton.

2159
01:57:01,801 --> 01:57:03,601
These texans
are pretty tough,

2160
01:57:03,667 --> 01:57:07,100
but if we can wreck them,
there won't be any fight.

2161
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:10,133
But get ready to jump
when you get the signal,

2162
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:13,367
and if any of those cowhands get
out of the wreck, boff 'em up.

2163
01:57:21,167 --> 01:57:23,067
Any sign of them yet?

2164
01:57:23,133 --> 01:57:24,501
Nope.

2165
01:57:37,634 --> 01:57:39,868
Next stop,
binghamton, boys.

2166
01:57:41,133 --> 01:57:42,801
Mighty pretty country.

2167
01:57:49,667 --> 01:57:51,601
Hey, wait a minute.

2168
01:57:52,667 --> 01:57:54,567
Wonder what's up.

2169
01:58:05,501 --> 01:58:07,267
Did you whistle
for me?

2170
01:58:07,334 --> 01:58:08,601
There's a train
coming.

2171
01:58:08,667 --> 01:58:11,300
No train due along here
now, is there?

2172
01:58:11,367 --> 01:58:12,601
No, but there
sure is one coming.

2173
01:58:12,667 --> 01:58:15,434
I can feel it
on the rails.

2174
01:58:15,501 --> 01:58:18,434
Better let them know
we're in the tunnel.

2175
01:58:22,968 --> 01:58:24,434
They must have
heard us.

2176
01:58:24,501 --> 01:58:26,467
They're trying to
whistle us down.

2177
01:58:26,534 --> 01:58:27,901
Keep that throttle open!

2178
01:58:27,968 --> 01:58:30,834
We can only nail them
in that tunnel.

2179
01:58:30,901 --> 01:58:32,467
They're
still coming.

2180
01:58:32,534 --> 01:58:35,467
Maybe soule's gotten wise
and is trying to head us off.

2181
01:58:35,534 --> 01:58:37,968
They wouldn't try and ram
us in here, would they?

2182
01:58:38,033 --> 01:58:39,567
They might.

2183
01:58:39,634 --> 01:58:43,067
Give her all you got and
let's get out of this tunnel.

2184
01:58:43,133 --> 01:58:44,601
The boys can't jump.

2185
01:58:44,667 --> 01:58:47,267
I won't signal them
till we get out of here.

2186
01:59:00,067 --> 01:59:01,133
We made it!

2187
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,400
Yeah, and there they
are, coming like a-

2188
01:59:45,033 --> 01:59:47,834
come on!
What are you waiting for?

2189
02:00:39,701 --> 02:00:40,901
Aah!

2190
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,601
Cupidon, you little son
of a gun, get out of here!

2191
02:00:59,234 --> 02:01:00,834
Ooh!

2192
02:01:00,901 --> 02:01:02,400
Hey, hey,
hey, boss!

2193
02:01:17,501 --> 02:01:19,400
Hey, it's clint!

2194
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:22,968
There's one.
Get him.

2195
02:01:54,067 --> 02:01:55,734
Where is everybody?

2196
02:01:57,701 --> 02:01:59,133
Angelique!

2197
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:01,133
Now, where
have you been?

2198
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:02,434
Upstairs,
looking for-

2199
02:02:02,501 --> 02:02:03,701
fasten my dress.

2200
02:02:03,767 --> 02:02:06,000
Why aren't you here
when i need you?

2201
02:02:06,067 --> 02:02:07,267
Something frets me.

2202
02:02:07,334 --> 02:02:09,334
I wish we'd never come
to this place. I hate it.

2203
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:11,067
I wish we'd stayed
in paris.

2204
02:02:11,133 --> 02:02:12,901
I wish we'd stayed
in new orleans.

2205
02:02:12,968 --> 02:02:14,334
Not even he cares
anymore.

2206
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,667
He leaves me alone.

2207
02:02:16,734 --> 02:02:19,667
Oh, baby...
like my beautiful rita.

2208
02:02:19,734 --> 02:02:22,300
I'm not rita,
i'm clio.

2209
02:02:22,367 --> 02:02:25,734
I shall make my life
the way i said.

2210
02:02:25,801 --> 02:02:27,200
No weeping,
no whimpering.

2211
02:02:27,267 --> 02:02:30,100
I'm strong again.
I'll let him go.

2212
02:02:30,167 --> 02:02:33,968
Vache! That gascon
with his swagger.

2213
02:02:34,033 --> 02:02:36,104
Oh, he's not
a gascon.

2214
02:02:36,105 --> 02:02:37,634
He doesn't swagger.

2215
02:02:37,701 --> 02:02:39,567
You know what i think?

2216
02:02:39,634 --> 02:02:42,801
I think we seen
the last of him-that one.

2217
02:02:42,868 --> 02:02:45,067
How dare you say
that he won't be back?

2218
02:02:45,133 --> 02:02:47,234
He'll be here tonight
for the ball.

2219
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:48,801
He'll go
as a real cowboy

2220
02:02:48,868 --> 02:02:50,267
with chaps and
spurs and everything.

2221
02:02:50,334 --> 02:02:52,267
And cupidon
is going as-

2222
02:02:52,334 --> 02:02:53,868
cupidon is...
where at?

2223
02:02:53,934 --> 02:02:55,400
He's probably
hanging around

2224
02:02:55,467 --> 02:02:56,901
those stables
somewhere.

2225
02:02:56,968 --> 02:02:58,601
Cupidon
is with him.

2226
02:02:58,667 --> 02:03:00,868
Ah, he can't be.

2227
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,434
How do you know?

2228
02:03:03,501 --> 02:03:06,133
Everybody in the hotel is talking.

2229
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,634
They have some big,
dangerous plan.

2230
02:03:08,701 --> 02:03:11,300
Cupidon must have hid
himself away somewhere

2231
02:03:11,367 --> 02:03:13,334
when mr. Clint
went out,

2232
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:15,334
and now
he's with him.

2233
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:18,501
Well, i'll whip him! I'll take
my riding crop, and i'll whip him!

2234
02:03:18,567 --> 02:03:20,300
What plan?
What dangerous plan?

2235
02:03:20,367 --> 02:03:22,033
It started at this
albany or someplace.

2236
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:24,367
Mr. Clint and a whole crowd of men,

2237
02:03:24,434 --> 02:03:26,067
taking each station
along the way

2238
02:03:26,133 --> 02:03:28,467
as if they was
fighting a war.

2239
02:03:28,534 --> 02:03:30,601
If anything happens to
cupidon because of him,

2240
02:03:30,667 --> 02:03:31,968
i'll kill him!

2241
02:03:32,033 --> 02:03:33,501
No! Angelique,
what stupid talk!

2242
02:03:33,567 --> 02:03:35,634
Nothing will happen
to them.

2243
02:03:35,701 --> 02:03:37,033
Something frights me.

2244
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:39,501
I got a feeling
deep down-

2245
02:03:39,567 --> 02:03:42,601
no, angelique!
Don't say such things!

2246
02:03:42,667 --> 02:03:45,634
I knew this texas
bring us bad luck.

2247
02:03:45,701 --> 02:03:48,601
I knew you'd turn out
like your mama-

2248
02:03:48,667 --> 02:03:50,634
no luck with menfolks.

2249
02:03:50,701 --> 02:03:53,133
You fixing to marry
a millionaire,

2250
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:54,634
and all the time

2251
02:03:54,701 --> 02:03:57,000
you crazy in your head
for that vache,

2252
02:03:57,067 --> 02:04:01,367
and he leave you,
just like mr. Nicholas-

2253
02:04:07,667 --> 02:04:09,100
now...

2254
02:04:09,167 --> 02:04:10,601
let me fix you.

2255
02:04:10,667 --> 02:04:12,133
What's going on in here?

2256
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:14,367
That great cow.

2257
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:18,667
What a to-do. I could
hear you way down the hall,

2258
02:04:18,734 --> 02:04:20,534
screeching like a
of couple fishwives.

2259
02:04:20,601 --> 02:04:22,567
Listen, my child, old lady
van steed knows who you are.

2260
02:04:22,634 --> 02:04:24,667
She's going to expose
you at the ball tonight.

2261
02:04:24,734 --> 02:04:27,067
She'll say nothing till she
gets you in front of an audience,

2262
02:04:27,133 --> 02:04:28,534
and then, squash-
no more countess.

2263
02:04:28,601 --> 02:04:30,100
I shall not be
at the ball.

2264
02:04:30,167 --> 02:04:31,968
You've got to go.
I got it up for you.

2265
02:04:32,033 --> 02:04:33,968
If clint comes back, i'll
go. If clint and cupidon-

2266
02:04:34,033 --> 02:04:35,501
you're
an ungrateful brat-

2267
02:04:35,567 --> 02:04:38,067
right when you're on the threshold
of success if you don't weaken.

2268
02:04:38,133 --> 02:04:41,601
I know a man who's head over
heels in love when i see one.

2269
02:04:41,667 --> 02:04:43,100
Who?

2270
02:04:43,167 --> 02:04:45,100
Great heavens,
she says "who?"

2271
02:04:45,167 --> 02:04:46,801
Why, van steed,
of course.

2272
02:04:46,868 --> 02:04:49,200
He's what you want,
isn't he?

2273
02:04:49,267 --> 02:04:51,334
Yes, he's what i want.

2274
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:52,634
Good girl. He's on his way here now.

2275
02:04:52,701 --> 02:04:53,834
Of course
he's what i want.

2276
02:04:53,901 --> 02:04:55,067
I've got to run-

2277
02:04:55,133 --> 02:04:56,400
got a million things to
do, running this ruckus.

2278
02:04:56,467 --> 02:04:59,434
I must keep remembering
that. I must be sane.

2279
02:04:59,501 --> 02:05:02,133
But you got to stand up to
his ma. I'll stand behind you.

2280
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:03,601
Just deny everything.

2281
02:05:03,667 --> 02:05:05,767
That's a trick i learned
from my husband.

2282
02:05:05,834 --> 02:05:07,734
Caught him cold once
with a chorus girl.

2283
02:05:07,801 --> 02:05:09,100
He kept on denying it,

2284
02:05:09,167 --> 02:05:12,033
looking me right in the
eye until in the end,

2285
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:14,434
darned if i didn't
believe the little liar.

2286
02:05:17,701 --> 02:05:20,634
You see? I'm not going to be like mama.

2287
02:05:20,701 --> 02:05:22,567
I shall marry and be
respectable and rich.

2288
02:05:22,634 --> 02:05:23,901
I shall have my life

2289
02:05:23,968 --> 02:05:26,334
the way i said
i should have it.

2290
02:05:28,133 --> 02:05:30,334
I really do look beautiful, don't i?

2291
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,601
Am i as beautiful
as my mother was?

2292
02:05:32,667 --> 02:05:34,100
Yes, i am.
I am.

2293
02:05:35,667 --> 02:05:37,467
Oh, there he is.
One moment!

2294
02:05:37,534 --> 02:05:39,100
Finish, angelique.
Vite.

2295
02:05:39,167 --> 02:05:40,400
You're shaking
all over.

2296
02:05:40,501 --> 02:05:41,834
I'm not.

2297
02:05:44,167 --> 02:05:45,601
I'm clio dulaine...

2298
02:05:45,667 --> 02:05:48,300
and i'm very calm.

2299
02:05:59,701 --> 02:06:01,868
Is mrs. Du chenfrais in?

2300
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:06,701
Dear bart,
good evening.

2301
02:06:06,767 --> 02:06:08,133
Will you have
a cocktail?

2302
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:10,133
Angelique, bring a cocktail
for monsieur van steed.

2303
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:11,634
No, thank you.
I never drink.

2304
02:06:11,701 --> 02:06:12,968
My digestion.

2305
02:06:13,033 --> 02:06:15,634
Of course. I've noticed
that strong men so often

2306
02:06:15,701 --> 02:06:17,367
have weak
digestions.

2307
02:06:18,701 --> 02:06:20,934
I came to fetch you
for the ball.

2308
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,033
Oh, how sweet of you...

2309
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:24,634
and brave.

2310
02:06:25,634 --> 02:06:27,501
You mean my mother.

2311
02:06:27,567 --> 02:06:28,567
How is
your dear mother?

2312
02:06:28,634 --> 02:06:29,834
I haven't
felt her claws

2313
02:06:29,901 --> 02:06:31,934
since the first delightful
meeting on the piazza.

2314
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,033
Suppose we go down, and you can
inquire of her health yourself?

2315
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,868
Oh, i should have
loved it,

2316
02:06:36,934 --> 02:06:38,767
but i'm waiting
for colonel maroon.

2317
02:06:38,834 --> 02:06:41,000
Maroon's away.

2318
02:06:41,067 --> 02:06:43,100
Yes, i know-
albany.

2319
02:06:43,167 --> 02:06:45,601
Tell me, isn't this
albany very near saratoga?

2320
02:06:45,667 --> 02:06:47,100
Yes, that's right.

2321
02:06:47,167 --> 02:06:49,100
But mr. Van steed, what
manner of country is this?

2322
02:06:49,167 --> 02:06:51,601
I hear there are
hordes of roughs.

2323
02:06:51,667 --> 02:06:54,067
They fight-fight like
savages for a railroad.

2324
02:06:54,133 --> 02:06:56,334
Where are the laws?
Where are the police?

2325
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:59,434
That's nothing for you to
worry your pretty head about.

2326
02:06:59,501 --> 02:07:00,701
That's a man's business.

2327
02:07:00,767 --> 02:07:03,667
Really? And what are
you doing about it-

2328
02:07:03,734 --> 02:07:06,100
you, yourself,
i mean?

2329
02:07:06,167 --> 02:07:07,734
I'm paying for it.

2330
02:07:11,133 --> 02:07:12,601
Oh, you coward.

2331
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:14,734
You're afraid to fight
for your own railroad.

2332
02:07:14,801 --> 02:07:16,234
You're afraid
of your mother.

2333
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:17,734
You're afraid
of everything.

2334
02:07:17,801 --> 02:07:20,767
Go away!
Get out of my sight!

2335
02:07:22,634 --> 02:07:24,067
Well, why don't you go?

2336
02:07:24,133 --> 02:07:26,567
You know, you're delightful
when you're angry.

2337
02:07:26,634 --> 02:07:28,767
I like a woman
with spirit.

2338
02:07:29,834 --> 02:07:31,834
Clio, will you
marry me?

2339
02:07:34,133 --> 02:07:36,767
I'm asking you
to be my wife.

2340
02:07:39,667 --> 02:07:41,801
Surprised,
aren't you.

2341
02:07:44,133 --> 02:07:45,567
Yes, i am.

2342
02:07:45,634 --> 02:07:47,934
I'll surprise you a lot
before i'm through.

2343
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,067
You say that i'm afraid
of my mother.

2344
02:07:50,133 --> 02:07:51,601
It's time
that you understood

2345
02:07:51,667 --> 02:07:52,801
about me and mother.

2346
02:07:52,868 --> 02:07:56,267
People think that i'm
tied to her apron strings.

2347
02:07:56,334 --> 02:07:57,267
Mother's useful.

2348
02:07:57,334 --> 02:07:59,267
She shoos
the women away,

2349
02:07:59,334 --> 02:08:00,767
and i let her.

2350
02:08:00,834 --> 02:08:03,901
But when there's something
or someone that i want,

2351
02:08:03,968 --> 02:08:05,234
i get it.

2352
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:07,934
You do the same thing,
don't you?

2353
02:08:09,167 --> 02:08:10,567
Yes, i do.

2354
02:08:10,634 --> 02:08:12,634
I schemed and tricked
to get you.

2355
02:08:12,701 --> 02:08:14,133
Oh, i know that.

2356
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:15,634
When a man
has millions-

2357
02:08:15,701 --> 02:08:17,634
i lied to you.
I'm not a countess.

2358
02:08:17,701 --> 02:08:19,000
I'm clio dulaine,
and my mother was-

2359
02:08:19,067 --> 02:08:20,734
i know exactly who you
and your mother were.

2360
02:08:20,801 --> 02:08:22,567
My own mother told me,

2361
02:08:22,634 --> 02:08:25,534
and i told her to mind her own business.

2362
02:08:25,601 --> 02:08:27,067
You're what i want,

2363
02:08:27,133 --> 02:08:28,734
and i've got
what you want.

2364
02:08:28,801 --> 02:08:30,601
So what are
we waiting for?

2365
02:08:30,667 --> 02:08:32,334
Mother's down
in the ballroom now.

2366
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:33,801
Suppose we go down

2367
02:08:33,868 --> 02:08:36,000
and see which one of
us will back out-

2368
02:08:36,067 --> 02:08:38,767
you or me?

2369
02:08:41,133 --> 02:08:43,033
Suppose we do.

2370
02:09:01,167 --> 02:09:02,367
Congratulations,
bart.

2371
02:09:02,434 --> 02:09:03,567
Yes, yes. Splendid.

2372
02:09:03,634 --> 02:09:05,100
How do they know?

2373
02:09:05,167 --> 02:09:06,567
Good news travels fast,
doesn't it?

2374
02:09:06,634 --> 02:09:08,601
Must have been some scrap,
eh, bart?

2375
02:09:08,667 --> 02:09:10,067
What has happened?

2376
02:09:10,133 --> 02:09:12,567
By gosh, he did it,
didn't he?

2377
02:09:12,634 --> 02:09:14,100
Who did what?

2378
02:09:14,167 --> 02:09:16,634
Knocked him sprawling.
Some man, that texan.

2379
02:09:16,701 --> 02:09:17,634
Clint!

2380
02:09:17,701 --> 02:09:18,734
Too bad
about colonel maroon.

2381
02:09:18,801 --> 02:09:19,934
Hear anything
more definite?

2382
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,267
Clint! What has
happened to clint?

2383
02:09:21,334 --> 02:09:22,501
Nothing.

2384
02:09:22,567 --> 02:09:24,601
We have to pay a price
for everything.

2385
02:09:24,667 --> 02:09:26,133
Tell me
what you know.

2386
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,133
People are looking.
I'll tell you later.

2387
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:29,234
No! Now!

2388
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:31,000
We understand that
the little dwarf was hurt.

2389
02:09:31,067 --> 02:09:33,000
Do you want me to strike you
in front of all these people?

2390
02:09:33,067 --> 02:09:34,367
Tell me what
has happened to clint?

2391
02:09:34,434 --> 02:09:37,267
We heard he was hurt a
little, but you know how he is-

2392
02:09:37,334 --> 02:09:38,767
you're lying.
You're lying.

2393
02:09:38,834 --> 02:09:40,133
He's dead. I can see it in your face.

2394
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:42,834
He fought for you in
a miserable raid-

2395
02:10:01,334 --> 02:10:02,767
clint!

2396
02:10:07,367 --> 02:10:10,667
My, my,
mrs. Du chenfrais, ma'am,

2397
02:10:10,734 --> 02:10:12,901
you look right pretty.

2398
02:10:14,234 --> 02:10:15,901
I reckon i'm a sight.

2399
02:10:17,367 --> 02:10:18,934
Oh, clint, cheri!

2400
02:10:21,167 --> 02:10:23,367
Clint! Clint!

2401
02:10:23,434 --> 02:10:24,601
Clint!

2402
02:10:46,834 --> 02:10:48,334
I want to see
the boss.

2403
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:50,300
Doctor say you stay
in bed. You stay.

2404
02:10:50,367 --> 02:10:51,834
Has he come to yet?

2405
02:10:51,901 --> 02:10:53,801
I don't find out
for one hour.

2406
02:10:53,868 --> 02:10:54,834
Still fainted?

2407
02:10:54,901 --> 02:10:57,634
Womanish, huh?

2408
02:10:57,701 --> 02:11:02,133
Plum disgraceful
to us maroons.

2409
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:05,167
The last thing
i heard him say,

2410
02:11:05,234 --> 02:11:09,667
"here goes a maroon,
killed by a shovel."

2411
02:11:09,734 --> 02:11:12,367
I know.
I know.

2412
02:11:14,067 --> 02:11:16,367
I find out.

2413
02:11:25,167 --> 02:11:27,300
Has he come to?

2414
02:12:11,234 --> 02:12:12,734
Honey...

2415
02:12:14,634 --> 02:12:16,167
yes, clint?

2416
02:12:16,234 --> 02:12:17,601
Missed you.

2417
02:12:17,667 --> 02:12:19,200
Missed you a lot.

2418
02:12:19,267 --> 02:12:22,100
Oh, have you,
my cheri?

2419
02:12:22,167 --> 02:12:23,601
Been away so long.

2420
02:12:23,667 --> 02:12:25,067
No, no.
Doesn't matter.

2421
02:12:25,133 --> 02:12:26,601
We're together now.

2422
02:12:26,667 --> 02:12:29,601
Ain't ever going
to be separated again?

2423
02:12:29,667 --> 02:12:32,100
No, my darling.
Never, never, never.

2424
02:12:32,167 --> 02:12:33,467
I was a fool...

2425
02:12:33,534 --> 02:12:36,267
ought never
have left texas.

2426
02:12:37,634 --> 02:12:39,133
What?

2427
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:40,634
Leaving you that way.

2428
02:12:40,701 --> 02:12:43,634
Sweetest little woman
in texas.

2429
02:12:43,701 --> 02:12:45,100
What?

2430
02:12:45,167 --> 02:12:47,634
Disposition
like an angel.

2431
02:12:47,701 --> 02:12:49,100
But, cheri,
i've changed.

2432
02:12:49,167 --> 02:12:51,100
Never hollering
at a fella,

2433
02:12:51,167 --> 02:12:52,634
never hightailing,

2434
02:12:52,701 --> 02:12:54,133
letting me
wear the pants.

2435
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:57,067
But i'm just like mama now, truly i am.

2436
02:12:57,133 --> 02:12:58,667
Anyhow,
i kept your tie.

2437
02:12:58,734 --> 02:13:00,033
Don't know what
i'd done without it.

2438
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:02,000
Look. I'm making one,
too.

2439
02:13:02,067 --> 02:13:03,501
Blue forget-me-nots.

2440
02:13:03,567 --> 02:13:04,968
Yes. Look, cheri,
look.

2441
02:13:05,033 --> 02:13:06,667
Kept it around
my neck always.

2442
02:13:06,734 --> 02:13:08,133
Should have
been a rope

2443
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:10,667
for some of the things i've done.

2444
02:13:10,734 --> 02:13:12,701
Some of the flowers
are crooked,

2445
02:13:12,767 --> 02:13:14,167
but i tried.

2446
02:13:14,234 --> 02:13:17,167
Got myself mixed up
with a foreign lady.

2447
02:13:17,234 --> 02:13:18,734
I'm ashamed.

2448
02:13:21,501 --> 02:13:23,634
Please don't say that. I know
you don't know what you're saying.

2449
02:13:23,701 --> 02:13:26,100
Funny what kind of
trouble you can get into

2450
02:13:26,167 --> 02:13:27,601
just by talking

2451
02:13:27,667 --> 02:13:29,133
to somebody
on the street.

2452
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:32,100
But i told bart.
I said i hated him.

2453
02:13:32,167 --> 02:13:33,567
Got myself rich, too.

2454
02:13:33,634 --> 02:13:37,033
But i said i didn't want to marry
him, even with so much money.

2455
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:40,534
I'm rich up to my neck. Be
richer, too, before i'm through.

2456
02:13:40,601 --> 02:13:43,567
I said i wanted
to marry only you.

2457
02:13:43,634 --> 02:13:45,868
Rich and respectable,
that's me.

2458
02:13:49,434 --> 02:13:51,334
Oh, don't punish me
anymore.

2459
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:57,133
I'll cook for you.
I'll scrub for you.

2460
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:58,634
If you leave me,

2461
02:13:58,701 --> 02:14:00,100
wherever you go,
i'll follow,

2462
02:14:00,167 --> 02:14:01,834
and i'll find you.

2463
02:14:08,701 --> 02:14:10,968
I'll let you wear the pants.

2464
02:14:13,701 --> 02:14:17,100
Honey, that's all
i wanted to know.

2465
02:14:25,801 --> 02:14:26,767
Clint!

2466
02:14:26,834 --> 02:14:28,234
Ha ha ha!

2467
02:14:30,067 --> 02:14:31,868
Son of a gun!

2468
02:14:32,305 --> 02:15:32,560
