Now listen, men.
Spring is here...

3
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:45,337
and spring is a dangerous time
of the year, especially in Paris.

4
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:49,138
The wanderlust is in the air.
Travelers are coming here from everywhere -

5
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:51,769
from Cincinnati and Singapore.

6
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:55,043
- Now, what do they come for?
- [Together] We know.

7
00:01:55,151 --> 00:02:00,679
That's right. Chicago packers
don't come here for a plate of cold cuts.

8
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:04,724
Big planters don't come
from Brazil just for nuts.

9
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:08,455
From Norway and Sweden,
they don't come here to fish.

10
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:13,397
But whether they come from
Amsterdam or Birmingham or Siam...

11
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:16,162
we let them do whatever they wish.

12
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,296
We let them play in any way...

13
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,339
as long as they're willing to pay.

14
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,806
[Together]
That's okay.

15
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,207
But spring is here.

16
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,974
And after dark, our cafés are empty.

17
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:32,109
But every park has
standing room only every night.

18
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,744
- Now that's wrong.
- That's right.

19
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,551
The situation is not funny.

20
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,785
Our best cafés are losing money.

21
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:43,124
We must clean up the public parks.

22
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,527
We must clean up the public parks.

23

Here's your slogan:
Cleaner parks and more prosperity.

24

[All] Cleaner parks. Cleaner parks.
More prosperity. More prosperity.

25

Come on. Come on.
Where do you think you are?

26
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:22,223
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

27
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,496
The French Revolution.

28
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,333
Hey! You can't make love in public.

29
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,634
- I can make love anywhere.
- No, you can't.

- Darling!

31

- Dr. Bertier.

33
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,349
And your name?

00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:47,423
Madame Bertier.

- So you're married, eh?
- Yes, Officer.

36
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:53,695
And you expect me to believe that?

37
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:56,594
- Oh, please.
- Please.

38
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,895
Now let me tell you something.

39

You're the only married couple
in this park.

Get out!

41

Well, there's only
one other place to go.

42
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:14,381
Why not?

43
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,177
Listen, Officer.
Do you see that moon?

44
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:22,415
If he could talk French,
do you know what he would say to you?

45
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:24,423
Phooey.

46
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,885
Ladies and gentlemen,
I must talk to you.

This is a very delicate situation.

He was wrong.
And so are you.

53

Believe it or not,
we are married.

54

I am her husband.

55

And she is my wife.

56
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,421

# I kiss Colette #

00:49:35,603 --> 00:49:37,502
#And I get all upset #

#Why, she could make an angel
throw away his wings #

#And yet I claim
Colette can do the same #

652
00:50:41,465 --> 00:50:43,626
Why don't you go back
to Mademoiselle Martel?

653
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:47,170
- [Chuckling] Oh, darling.
- It may be a joke to you, but it -

Oh, darling.

If I wanted to start something
with Mademoiselle Martel...

658

would I do it here?

Couldrt I call her to my office?

660
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,315
So, that's what goes on
in your office!

661
00:51:06,422 --> 00:51:08,856
Darling, we have been married
for three years.

662
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:11,859
And for three years,
you've gone to your office every day.

663
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:14,156
Sweetheart, take my word -
This Martel girl -

664
00:51:14,262 --> 00:51:16,856
- I don't believe you!
- I demand that you believe me.

00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:19,832
I saw what I saw.

- # I'm just insane with desire #
- Adolph, this is ridiculous!

- I don't know whether to laugh or scream.
- # I'm on fire #

00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:32,755
- I want you to leave this house at once.

if you want Andre to hear you.

younger.

701
00:54:43,962 --> 00:54:47,159
But it was my fault.
I was wrong.

702
00:54:48,466 --> 00:54:50,593
You have a right to be wrong.

You're a woman.
Women are born to be wrong.

- Yes. Love.

712

- Oh, darling.
- My dear, how excited you seem.

713
00:57:47,436 --> 00:57:50,337
I just had a dream,
a terrible dream.

714
00:57:50,439 --> 00:57:54,240
I dreamed that last night, when you
were gone, I was downstairs alone and -

715
00:57:54,343 --> 00:57:55,970
Yes, yes? Go on.

716
00:57:56,078 --> 00:57:59,605
Suddenly a man took hold of me.
I - I struggled, and he -

717
00:57:59,715 --> 00:58:01,614
- Choked you?
- No.

718
00:58:01,716 --> 00:58:03,616
- Shot you?
- No.

719
00:58:03,718 --> 00:58:05,618
What did he do?

720
00:58:06,888 --> 00:58:08,789
He kissed me.

721
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:11,325
Oh. Kissed you.

Someone I know?

725
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,202
- He's your pal.
- What a pal!

726
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:32,107
- It was Adolph.
- Oh, no. Not Adolph.

727
00:58:32,212 --> 00:58:35,978
[Laughs] That's a scream.
It couldn't be Adolph, even in a dream!

728
00:58:37,784 --> 00:58:39,979
Adolph!

729

01:02:20,396 --> 01:02:24,457
Your-Your wife just -
just asked me something.

787
01:02:25,566 --> 01:02:27,693
And then I answered.

788
01:02:27,803 --> 01:02:30,498
Then another question,
and then another answer.

789
01:02:30,606 --> 01:02:33,438
One question follows an answer.
You know? [Chuckling]

790
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:36,533
Eight minutes -
Eight minutes can go like that!

791
01:02:36,645 --> 01:02:38,271
Yes. Yes.

792
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,042
Then you, uh -
you got out of the car.

793
01:02:41,149 --> 01:02:43,481
You went to the house,
and at the door...

794
01:02:43,584 --> 01:02:45,711
my wife handed you the key.

795
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:47,720
You unlocked the door...

796
01:02:47,822 --> 01:02:51,258
and after a short conversation,
you went in.

797
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:55,727
This was exactly 2:51.

798
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,263
Uh -Am I boring you?

799
01:02:58,365 --> 01:03:00,697
Oh, not at all, Professor.

800
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:04,669
Uh, yes, y-your wife -
your wife said...

801
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:07,205
"Wort you come up
and have a little brandy?"

802
01:03:07,307 --> 01:03:11,174
And I said,
"Ah, a little brandy can't hurt."

803
01:03:12,712 --> 01:03:14,976
- So, I - I went up.
- Yes.

804
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:18,415
And, uh -
And you had the brandy?

805
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:21,347
Yes.

806
01:03:21,454 --> 01:03:23,649
Was it good brandy, Doctor?

807
01:03:23,756 --> 01:03:25,724
Excellent, Professor.

808
01:03:26,759 --> 01:03:30,422
You drank this brandy
from 2:53...

809
01:03:31,629 --> 01:03:33,563
to 4:44.

810
01:03:36,035 --> 01:03:39,401
Professor, I assure you...

811
01:03:39,504 --> 01:03:42,302
that there is
absolutely nothing wrong.

812
01:03:43,975 --> 01:03:46,944
We just -We just had a chat...

813
01:03:47,045 --> 01:03:48,945
and a few laughs.

814
01:03:49,047 --> 01:03:52,539
You know, y-your wife -
your wife is very amusing.

815
01:03:52,649 --> 01:03:55,517
Yes, everyone says so.
It must be true.

816
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:59,283
Now, Professor,
all appearances are against me.

817
01:03:59,389 --> 01:04:01,516
I know. I know.
But let me tell you again -

818
01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:03,924
Not another word, Doctor.

819
01:04:04,027 --> 01:04:07,395
- I believe you.
- Thank you.

820
01:04:07,498 --> 01:04:10,023
You're very welcome.
I believe you.

821
01:04:11,235 --> 01:04:14,830
But no one else will. [Chuckles]
Too bad, isn't it?

822
01:04:14,937 --> 01:04:17,838
I just came up here this morning
to ask you...

823
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,399
if you would appear,
voluntarily, as a...

824
01:04:22,712 --> 01:04:26,341
shall we say, witness
in my divorce suit?

825
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:28,815
[Chuckles]

826
01:04:28,918 --> 01:04:31,580
Professor, please believe me.

827
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:34,816
I'm an innocent man.

828
01:04:34,924 --> 01:04:38,655
I'm not guilty.
And neither is Mitzi.

829
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:40,728
I mean - I mean, your wife.

830
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:43,798
My friend -
May I call you my friend?

831
01:04:43,899 --> 01:04:46,629
- Please.
- My friend, nobody is guilty.

832
01:04:46,735 --> 01:04:51,262
I have a theory that nobody
is responsible for their actions.

833
01:04:51,373 --> 01:04:54,137
Right!
That's absolutely right.

834
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:58,177
Our doings are controlled by circumstances
over which we have no control.

835
01:04:58,279 --> 01:05:02,306
Oh, excellent.
Truer words have never been spoken.

836
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:05,681
Therefore, nobody can
be held responsible for his actions.

837
01:05:05,787 --> 01:05:08,653
Oh, what a beautiful thought,
Professor.

838
01:05:08,756 --> 01:05:10,724
You know -
You know that you're a poet?

839
01:05:10,825 --> 01:05:15,125
[Chuckles] This, of course, has nothing
whatever to do with our case.

840
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,789
- Good morning, Professor.
- Madame.

841
01:05:19,899 --> 01:05:22,367
Ah, I'm so glad you dropped in.

842
01:05:22,468 --> 01:05:24,437
We should see each other
more often.

843
01:05:24,537 --> 01:05:28,473
[Chuckles]
I'm afraid the doctor doesn't like me.

844
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,703
Oh, Professor.
Where did you get such an idea?

845
01:05:32,979 --> 01:05:35,174
Oh, by the way, how's Mitzi?

846
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,214
- Mitzi?
- Yes.

847
01:05:37,317 --> 01:05:40,844
Oh, Mitzi. Uh, let me see.

848
01:05:40,953 --> 01:05:43,251
She left this morning for Lausanne.

849
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,482
- Lausanne?
- Mmm.

850
01:05:45,591 --> 01:05:48,355
- Oh, to see her mother.
- I suppose so.

851
01:05:49,761 --> 01:05:53,218
- I hope nothing's happened to her mother.
- To her mother?

852
01:05:53,332 --> 01:05:55,630
No, I don't think so.

853
01:05:55,734 --> 01:05:59,295
Well, we'll see.
I'm sorry, but I must be going now.

854
01:05:59,403 --> 01:06:02,668
Well, you must come again sometime.

855
01:06:02,773 --> 01:06:06,004
And when you write Mitzi,
you'll give her my best regards, won't you?

856
01:06:06,111 --> 01:06:08,908
Oh, I surely will.
And yours, Doctor?

857
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:11,847
Please.

858
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:14,179
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

859
01:06:14,285 --> 01:06:16,253
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

860
01:06:28,132 --> 01:06:31,328
Don't you think
he behaved strangely?

861
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,402
Oh, no, not at all.

862
01:06:39,376 --> 01:06:43,402
Andre? There's something wrong
between the professor and Mitzi.

863
01:06:43,513 --> 01:06:45,844
Oh. What an idea, Colette.

864
01:06:45,949 --> 01:06:48,917
I feel it. I feel it.
My womars instinct tells me.

865
01:06:50,153 --> 01:06:52,712
And there's a man in it.

866
01:06:52,821 --> 01:06:56,348
Andre?
You know who the man is?

867
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:59,256
- Who?
- This Russian artist Rodovsky.

868
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,330
- No. No, it's not Rodovsky.
- How do you know?

869
01:07:02,431 --> 01:07:06,094
I don't know. I don't know.
My- My instinct tells me it's not Rodovsky.

870
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,395
I tell you, it's Rodovsky.

871
01:07:08,503 --> 01:07:10,471
All right. All right.

872
01:07:10,571 --> 01:07:12,937
Everybody- Everybody is entitled
to his own opinion.

873
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:16,010
[Chuckles]
Let's hope it's Rodovsky.

874
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:20,742
You're right, Andre.
It's not Rodovsky.

875
01:07:20,847 --> 01:07:22,816
Now I know who it is.

876
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:25,976
- Who?
- That American - Goldberg.

877
01:07:27,854 --> 01:07:29,823
Maybe - Maybe you're right.

878
01:07:29,923 --> 01:07:32,619
I - I wouldn't be surprised
if it were Goldberg.

879
01:07:42,668 --> 01:07:44,863
Andre!

880
01:07:44,971 --> 01:07:47,462
- I have it now.
- Who?

881
01:07:47,574 --> 01:07:50,167
No. No. No, it can't be.

882
01:08:00,218 --> 01:08:03,153
# I didn't want to do what I did
but I did #

883
01:08:03,254 --> 01:08:05,814
#And now what can I do #

884
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:08,722
# I'd better take a trip
Yes, a trip on a ship #

885
01:08:08,827 --> 01:08:11,489
#To China or Peru #

886
01:08:11,597 --> 01:08:14,064
# I knew the moment
that she began #

887
01:08:14,165 --> 01:08:16,861
#Where it was leading to #

888
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,732
# It might have happened
to any man #

889
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:22,169
# It might have happened
to you #

890
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:25,002
# It was late
and she was lonely #

891
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:27,634
#And she begged
for sympathy only #

892
01:08:27,745 --> 01:08:30,839
# Now I ask you
what would you do #

893
01:08:30,947 --> 01:08:32,916
# In a case like that #

894
01:08:33,017 --> 01:08:35,747
# If her head
was on your shoulder #

895
01:08:35,853 --> 01:08:38,446
#And she grew
a little bit bolder #

896
01:08:38,555 --> 01:08:41,546
# Now I ask you
what would you do #

897
01:08:41,658 --> 01:08:43,625
#With a girl like that #

898
01:08:43,726 --> 01:08:46,490
# Do you think
you could resist her #

899
01:08:46,597 --> 01:08:49,190
# Do you think
you wouldn't have kissed her #

900
01:08:49,298 --> 01:08:52,166
#Would you treat her
like a sister #

901
01:08:52,268 --> 01:08:54,532
# Come on, be honest, mister #

902
01:08:54,638 --> 01:08:57,299
# If you saw her
turn the light out #

903
01:08:57,407 --> 01:08:59,931
#Would you get your hat
and get right out #

904
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:02,840
# Now I ask you
what would you do #

905
01:09:02,945 --> 01:09:05,243
[Chuckles]
#That's what I did too #

906
01:09:05,348 --> 01:09:08,111
# It was late
and she was lonely #

907

912
01:09:22,197 --> 01:09:24,631

what would you do #

913
01:09:24,732 --> 01:09:26,700
#With a girl like that #

917
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:37,678
# Oh, come on

918
01:09:37,778 --> 01:09:40,508

920
01:09:43,184 --> 01:09:45,846

what would you do #

921
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:48,285
# Heh, that's what I did too ##

922
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,683
Darling.

923
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:01,319
- Have you had any breakfast?
- Yes.

924
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,619
Was -Was it a good breakfast?

925
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:06,161
Marvelous.

926
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:08,560
Had a - a good night's sleep?

927
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:10,633
Yes. Wonderful.

928
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:13,531
- Feel strong?
- Great!

929
01:11:13,637 --> 01:11:15,764
Strong enough to face -

930
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:19,238
to take a-a nice -
a nice, long walk with me?

931
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,434
I'd love it.

932
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:23,512
Sit down, darling.

933
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:30,783
Darling,
I've got to disillusion you.

934
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:33,116
Your instinct was right.

935
01:11:33,221 --> 01:11:37,020
There is something wrong
in Mitzi's marriage.

936
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,650
Didrt I tell you?
Didrt I tell you?

937
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:42,628
And who wouldn't believe me?
[Laughing]

938
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:45,461
Oh, darling, tell me.
Tell me all about it.

939
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,228
You were right.
There's a man in it.

940
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:50,269
[Squeals]
Rodovsky?

941
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:53,238
- No.
- Goldberg?

942
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,605
- No.
- But who is it, darling?

943
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:57,609
Tell me, who?

944
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:02,080
Me.

945
01:12:05,952 --> 01:12:07,853
You?

946
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:12,356
You?

947
01:12:17,163 --> 01:12:19,722
My husband...

948
01:12:19,832 --> 01:12:22,027
and my very best friend.

949
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,609
Look at me, Andre.

950
01:12:36,114 --> 01:12:38,014
Oh!
[Crying]

951
01:12:45,523 --> 01:12:48,286
Go away!
Either you leave this house or I do.

952
01:12:48,392 --> 01:12:50,326
- But, sweetheart -
- Our marriage is over.

953
01:12:50,428 --> 01:12:53,124
- Darling -
- From now on you're nothing but a doctor to me.

954
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,256
- I love you.
- Tell it to my lawyer.

955
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:58,995
Believe me,
there was nothing wrong in it.

956
01:12:59,104 --> 01:13:01,071
I know I shouldn't have done it...

957
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:04,072
but please, please forgive me
for- for what I didn't do.

958
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:06,108
I don't want to hear another word!

959
01:13:06,209 --> 01:13:08,677
You can keep the house, my jewels,
the furniture, everything!

960
01:13:08,778 --> 01:13:12,509
I don't want any alimony!
[Crying Continues]

961
01:13:14,918 --> 01:13:16,885
How do you do, sir?

962
01:13:20,691 --> 01:13:22,953
<i>[Crying Continues]</i>

963
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:44,239
Adolph.

964
01:13:44,346 --> 01:13:46,712
Don't go.

965
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:57,418
Sweetheart, you must forgive me.

966
01:13:59,126 --> 01:14:01,094
Forgive you?

967
01:14:01,195 --> 01:14:03,493
I'm in no position
to forgive you.

968
01:14:03,596 --> 01:14:06,395
You think you were bad? No.

969
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,798
You were just
a naughty little boy.

970
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:13,305
Look at me.
I'm the one that's bad.

971
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,374
You think you're a Don Juan, eh?

972
01:14:15,476 --> 01:14:18,274
Well, if you're a Don Juan,
then I'm a Cleopatra.

973
01:14:18,378 --> 01:14:21,040
You, with your one hour.

974
01:14:21,147 --> 01:14:25,276
What's your one hour
compared with my 25 minutes?

975
01:14:25,385 --> 01:14:28,183
Remember the dream I told you
about Adolph and me?

976
01:14:28,288 --> 01:14:32,748
Well, that was no dream. It happened,
right here, on the night of our party.

977
01:14:32,858 --> 01:14:35,224
[Sputtering Laugh]

978
01:14:38,831 --> 01:14:41,459
- Oh, so you think a man
couldn't fall in love with me.

979
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:44,365
- Let me kiss you.
- You think I'm not attractive enough?

980
01:14:44,469 --> 01:14:46,836
- Maybe I'm too old.
- [Laughing]

981
01:14:46,938 --> 01:14:49,772
- Well, I'll show you.
- Oh, darling! Darling.

Adolph!

984
01:14:57,415 --> 01:14:59,940
Adolph, I want the truth...

985
01:15:00,051 --> 01:15:02,678
and nothing but the truth.

986
01:15:02,787 --> 01:15:06,018
After the party was over,
did you or did you not...

987
01:15:06,124 --> 01:15:08,991
wait in the garden
till after Andre had gone?

988
01:15:09,093 --> 01:15:11,561
And didn't you come into the house
in the dark?

989
01:15:11,662 --> 01:15:15,461
And didn't I find you
on the couch?

[Mouths Word]

991
01:15:23,673 --> 01:15:26,141
Yes.

992
01:15:26,244 --> 01:15:28,073
Well?

993
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:32,545
Sit down!

994
01:15:34,651 --> 01:15:37,483
And then, Adolph, didn't you, with -
with an uncontrollable impulse -

995
01:15:37,586 --> 01:15:40,055
didn't you untie your tie?

996
01:15:44,026 --> 01:15:45,926
- Yes.
- Well?

997
01:15:47,363 --> 01:15:50,092
Sit down!

998
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:54,191
And then, Adolph - then didn't you
take me in your arms and kiss me?

999
01:15:54,303 --> 01:15:57,294
And didn't we sit on the couch,
and didn't you kiss me again?

1000
01:15:57,406 --> 01:16:00,306
And didn't I like it?

1001
01:16:00,408 --> 01:16:03,434
- I guess so.
- Answer yes or no!

1002
01:16:05,847 --> 01:16:09,078
- Yes.
- Well?

1003
01:16:10,618 --> 01:16:12,609
Sit down!

1004
01:16:18,025 --> 01:16:20,493
Well, Doctor? We're even.

1005
01:16:20,594 --> 01:16:23,757
A tooth for a tooth,
an eye for an eye...

an Adolph for a Mitzi.

Fifty-fifty.

But if I ever catch you aga -

1009
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:36,007
Kiss me, sweetheart.

- You don't mind, do you, Adolph?
- No.

1011
01:16:41,447 --> 01:16:43,506
- Ladies -
- And gentlemen -

1012

- If he were your husband -
- And she were your wife -

1013
01:16:46,919 --> 01:16:48,887
And you find out
he's a Don Juan -

1014
01:16:48,988 --> 01:16:50,955
And you find out
that she has dreams -

1015
01:16:51,057 --> 01:16:53,547
- And he confesses -
- And she admits -

1016

- But you like him -
- And you love her-
