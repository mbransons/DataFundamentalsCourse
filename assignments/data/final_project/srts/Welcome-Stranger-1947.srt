1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,514
Good morning.

3
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,282
<i>I'm Dr. McRory.</i>

4
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,752
Joseph McRory
of Fallbridge.

5
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:05,984
Have a chair, Doctor.

6
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,256
Why, thank you,
but I have no time to visit.
I have some business with...

7
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,388
<i>Well, I'm sorry, Doctor,
but I can't just...</i>

8
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,125
Oh, you may go in now.

9
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,394
<i>Thank you.
It's a matter of
great importance.</i>

10
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,992
Dr. McRory.

11
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,360
From Fallbridge.

12
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,566
How do you do, Doctor?
Sit down.

13
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,268
I believe we had
some correspondence.

14
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,332
Yes, of course we had.

15
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,843
Oh, yes,
physician to replace you.

16
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,412
Yeah, for two months,
during me vacation trip.

17
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,313
First in 30 years.

18
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,778
<i>Now, I'd like a man of
substance, of experience,</i>

19
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,980
a mature man.

20
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,352
<i>That's been
taken care of, Doctor.</i>

21
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,023
Fine, fine.
When can I see him?

22
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,890
<i>As soon as you get
back to Fallbridge.
He's on his way now.</i>

23
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,292
On his way?

24
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,558
Me dear sir, do you
suppose for a moment

25
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,691
<i>that I'd place the health
of me town in the hands
of a person</i>

26
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:48,756
I never set eyes on?

27
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,262
<i>What'd you suppose
I came to Boston for?</i>

28
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,100
To buy these
fishing things?

29
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,767
<i>I assure you we've just
as good in Maine.</i>

30
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,070
Yes, and cheaper, too.

31
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,805
<i>Well, don't worry, Doctor.</i>

32
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,210
We only send out
qualified physicians.

33
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,278
Besides, your letter was
a definite authorization.

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,578
<i>Bindin', you mean?</i>

35
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,382
<i>Yes, but
there's no occasion
for concern, Doctor.</i>

36
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,443
<i>He's a good man.</i>

37
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:14,587
<i>Well, it's not my custom
to buy a pig in a poke,
but if it's binding...</i>

38
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,987
<i>What's his name,
this doctor?</i>

39
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,554
Pearson. James Pearson.

40
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,330
<i>Boston Times.
Get your paper before
the train leaves.</i>

41
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,871
Paper.
Lower 10, sir?

42
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,100
Yeah. Take this with you, huh?

43
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,199
Yes, sir.
Hey, paper.

44
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,171
There you are.
Hey, fella!

45
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,443
<i>What?
That's a quarter.</i>

46
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,006
<i>Well, tell 'em
where you got it.</i>

47
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,483
<i>Say, where's
the club car on here?</i>

48
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,281
<i>You can smoke in
the men's washroom, sir.</i>

49
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,719
<i>That's all the
club car we've got.</i>

50
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,087
<i>Your bag's in lower 10
and your trunks are
checked through.</i>

51
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,592
Fine. Spread this
around, will you?

52
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,356
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,523
I always like a man
that whistles.

54
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,435
<i>Well, I guess
there's room for one
more here, huh, fellas?</i>

55
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,438
<i>What's this?
Young man!</i>

56
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,598
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

57
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,972
<i>In the future,
you might look
where you're steppin'.</i>

58
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,841
<i>You're right. It's an
outstanding suggestion.</i>

59
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,509
Board! All aboard!

60
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,925
<i>Young man,
if you don't mind,
that's my paper.</i>

61
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,028
<i>What? This?
If you don't mind.</i>

62
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,265
<i>Well, you're welcome
to any part of it,</i>

63
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,298
<i>but it just happens that
I'm the legal owner of
this pillar of truth.</i>

64
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,210
<i>You're mistaken. I bought
that paper at the station.</i>

65
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,674
What section of it
would you like?

66
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,480
<i>I'm offering you
part of the paper.</i>

67
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,986
You can have
the back part.

68
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,353
You may have
the front part.

69
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,691
<i>I'm not thankin' you because
you're doin' me no favor.
It's my...</i>

70
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,629
<i>It's your newspaper.</i>

71
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,859
Yes.

72
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,425
<i>And I'm giving it to you.</i>

73
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,614
Could that be
your newspaper?

74
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,528
You got a match?

75
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,477
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

76
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,843
Right over here.
Thank you.

77
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,410
Oh, would you prefer to...

78
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,110
<i>Oh, I'm not
sitting down just yet.</i>

79
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,985
<i>Tell me, would
it be possible to order me
breakfast while I'm shavin'?</i>

80
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,717
<i>You have a dish on this
train I'm very partial to.</i>

81
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,988
Broiled brook trout
with butter and
lemon sauce.

82
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,790
Oh, a very nice dish.

83
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,956
<i>It'll be right here
for you, sir.
10 minutes?</i>

84
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,693
Thank you.

85
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,394
Oh, Clarence.
Yes?

86
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,561
Broiled brook trout...

87
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,309
<i>I'm not sayin' that
all the young people in the
big cities are ill-mannered.</i>

88
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,442
<i>It's a matter of breedin'
and early trainin'.</i>

89
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,078
<i>Now, take that
young blatherskite
I was tellin' ye about.</i>

90
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,883
The vulgar upstart.

91
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,424
He tramples on me package
and then he makes a great
to-do

92
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,722
about the ownership of
a three-cent newspaper.

93
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,625
Yes,
a three-cent newspaper.

94
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,030
Good morning.

95
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,328
<i>Mornin'.</i>

96
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,360
<i>He must've been hard up.
You mean he tried to
steal your paper?</i>

97
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,430
Well, not exactly that.

98
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,869
<i>Tell you later.
Breakfast is waitin'.</i>

99
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,002
Say, can I use your plug?

100
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,239
Use me what?

101
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,304
I want to use your plug.

102
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,793
<i>Smile
right back at the sun</i>

103
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,300
<i>And you'll have
a wonderful day</i>

104
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,596
<i>Smile right back at the sun</i>

105
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,401
<i>Gloom will get out
of your way</i>

106
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,006
<i>Just a cheerful expression</i>

107
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,879
<i>It's as easy as that</i>

108
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:33,584
<i>And you'll go walking
on a great big welcome mat</i>

109
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,545
<i>Why don't you try it?</i>

110
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,920
<i>Smile right back at the sun</i>

111
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,756
<i>The moment
he catches your eye</i>

112
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,020
<i>Waking up can be fun</i>

113
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,725
<i>Just depend on
your friend in the sky</i>

114
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,599
<i>If you start
your daydreams early</i>

115
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,206
<i>You're gonna get
a lot more done</i>

116
00:07:55,608 --> 00:08:00,011
<i>So get up and get out
and smile right back
at the sun</i>

117
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,377
Thank you.

118
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,045
Young man.
Huh?

119
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,013
This is a washroom,
not a cabaret.

120
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,888
No! I never knew.

121
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,922
What did you do,
cut yourself?

122
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,826
Let me see it.
No, thank you.

123
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,034
Oh, say, Steward.

124
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,135
Steward, do you
have a single that...

125
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,911
Broiled brook trout
for you, sir?
Hmm?

126
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,110
<i>That's very attractive.
What, are you pushing
trout today?</i>

127
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,176
Oh, no, sir. This
is the very last order.

128
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,381
Well, drop it yonder. Mmm.

129
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,917
Yes, sir.

130
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,506
Good morning, sir.

131
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,671
<i>Me order's been taken.</i>

132
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,074
Broiled brook trout
with lemon and
butter sauce.

133
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,313
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
They told me table
number five.</i>

134
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,682
<i>This gentleman...
I don't...</i>

135
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,981
<i>I'm afraid this
is your trout, sir.</i>

136
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,086
<i>I'll thank you
not to talk to me.
Bring me another order.</i>

137
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,653
<i>I'm sorry, there's
no more trout, sir.</i>

138
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,756
No more trout?
No, sir.

139
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,099
<i>Well, if you don't mind
finishing this,</i>

140
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,036
<i>I've only made
a small dent in it.</i>

141
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,268
You may bring me
some oatmeal.

142
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,938
Oatmeal. Yes, sir.

143
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,575
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
I don't think we
have any more oat...</i>

144
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,347
Maybe we have some
more oatmeal. Maybe.

145
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,747
<i>I'll be pullin' for you.</i>

146
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,155
Want some of mine?

147
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,594
<i>Here's your change, sir.</i>

148
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,695
Waiter, bring me
some pipe tobacco.

149
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,262
Any 15 cent
brand will do.

150
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,205
We have no
pipe tobacco, sir.

151
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,606
What? No pipe tobacco?

152
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,202
No, sir. How about
cigarettes or cigars?

153
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,803
No, no. Thanks.

154
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,712
Thank you, sir.
You bet.

155
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,401
<i>Oh, that's perfectly
all right. Go right...</i>

156
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,034
Yeah,
I thought it was me own pouch.

157
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,307
<i>Oh, of course.
They do look so
similar, don't they?</i>

158
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,780
They do not.

159
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,341
<i>Won't you help yourself?</i>

160
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,017
No, thank you.

161
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,326
Oh, now you broke it, huh?

162
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,030
Blatherskite!

163
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,431
<i>Hey, here's your hat, sir.</i>

164
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,210
Hillboro,
Carson Junction, Lankato,
Tanner City, Bentonville,

165
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,874
Fallbridge and Callensburg.

166
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,685
I thought you were
going on a vacation.

167
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,981
<i>I'm leavin' Tuesday, Ben.</i>

168
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,919
Lot of things to
tend to back home.

169
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,856
<i>Uh-huh. Well, get right in
and we'll take off here
right now.</i>

170
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,352
Always room
for one more.

171
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,689
Thank you.
Okay.

172
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,235
Stand away from the door.
Move back in the bus,
everybody.

173
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,462
Move back a little, friend.

174
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,697
Move back?
Where am I going?

175
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,967
Sardines have
taken over back there.

176
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,400
You all right?

177
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,375
Oh, me bunion!

178
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,916
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

179
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,068
Service, hey, Joe?
Right up to your
front door.

180
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,625
Thank you, Ben.

181
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,408
<i>Here's your coffee, Unc.</i>

182
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,178
Thank you, Jackie.

183
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,150
Is this the main
thoroughfare here?

184
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,918
Always has been.

185
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,467
Hi. Where do
I find a taxi here?

186
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,907
<i>Down by the Weekly.</i>

187
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,535
<i>Thank you.
Down by the Weekly.</i>

188
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,176
<i>Say, could you take me
to Dr. McRory's house?</i>

189
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,013
Yup. Cost you half a dollar.

190
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,848
Fine.
Oh, is it?

191
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,479
<i>Sure. What's the matter?</i>

192
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,046
Well, when
the customer
likes the price,

193
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,386
<i>sometimes I don't.</i>

194
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,017
Oh, you mean
you could have
asked for more?

195
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,585
<i>Don't put words
in my mouth. Get in.</i>

196
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,825
Say, you want
to re-negotiate?

197
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,766
<i>Nope. Bargain's a bargain.</i>

198
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,005
<i>I could've said a dollar.</i>

199
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,631
<i>Not to me, you couldn't.</i>

200
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,335
<i>I couldn't?
No, sir.</i>

201
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,899
<i>That's what I figured.</i>

202
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,640
Man in my business
gets to know human nature.

203
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,012
I sized you up
as a half-dollar fare.

204
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,080
You the new doc?

205
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,983
<i>Yeah, while McRory's away.</i>

206
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,151
Say, has he been
here quite awhile?

207
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,281
Thirty-five years.

208
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,053
<i>Oh, he's an elderly man, huh?</i>

209
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,923
<i>He'll do for awhile.</i>

210
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,321
Is there much work
here for a doctor?

211
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,366
Population of 2,400.

212
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,593
Well!

213
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,266
<i>That get-up
you're wearin',
is it from Boston?</i>

214
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,433
No, no, this is
California treatment.

215
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,200
You no like?

216
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,072
Well...

217
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,147
<i>We're almost there.</i>

218
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,917
Mrs. Gilley.
Mrs. Gilley!

219
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,089
Yes, Doctor?

220
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,422
What is it, Doctor?

221
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,594
<i>Now, are you quite sure
there's been no message
of any kind</i>

222
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,399
from this Dr. Pearson?

223
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,336
Dr. McRory,
for goodness sake.

224
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,635
I see, I see. No message.

225
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,677
Have I ever
failed to tell you
when someone called?

226
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,904
Yes.

227
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,277
I...
The door. The door,
Mrs. Gilley. The door.

228
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,474
<i>Here's your coat.</i>

229
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,908
Oh, no.
Keep the change.

230
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,148
Charged a half dollar,
keep a half dollar.
No extras.

231
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,449
May I tell you something?

232
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,513
What?

233
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,582
<i>You'd be a big hit
in New York.</i>

234
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,292
<i>How do you do?
I'm Dr. Pearson.</i>

235
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,993
Come in.
Thank you.

236
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,002
Take the bag to the
back room, Mr. Dorkas.

237
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,059
I know.

238
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,171
Put your coat down.

239
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,576
Are you Mrs. McRory?

240
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,274
<i>Heaven forbid!
It's enough that I do
his cooking and tidying up.</i>

241
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,839
<i>I'll tell him.</i>

242
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,214
<i>He's here, Doctor.
What's that?</i>

243
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,551
<i>I say he's here.</i>

244
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,817
Dr. Pearson?
Yes.

245
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,791
Fine, fine,
bring him in.

246
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,986
Come in, Doctor.

247
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,456
Welcome, Doc...

248
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,465
Yup.

249
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,346
<i>No. It's not possible.</i>

250
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,181
<i>Well, it's me.</i>

251
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,249
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

252
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,481
Me, neither.

253
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,323
180,000 physicians
in the country and...

254
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,586
You got me.

255
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,560
You know, Doctor, actually,
it was my newspaper,
you know.

256
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,724
Young man,
do you try to
be objectionable?

257
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,729
<i>I'm not trying.</i>

258
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,704
<i>I can tell you this.
If I'd seen you in Boston,
I wouldn't be seein' you now.</i>

259
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,967
<i>What's this you're wearin'?
What are you dressed up for?</i>

260
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,443
Oh, you like my outfit.
Not too loud?

261
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,643
Let me look at
your credentials.

262
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,514
<i>Got 'em right here.</i>

263
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,558
I know of no Drake
Hospital in Boston.

264
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,858
<i>Oh, the Drake isn't
a hospital, Doctor.
It's a hotel.</i>

265
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,198
You worked in a hotel?

266
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,172
<i>Hmm-mmm. I wasn't
hopping bells, either.
I was house physician.</i>

267
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,197
Three months.

268
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,332
Were you fired?

269
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,639
<i>No, I took a job
as ship's doctor on the
New York to Bermuda run.</i>

270
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,648
Five voyages.

271
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,045
<i>What's this here
about Valpar...</i>

272
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,621
<i>What's that name?
Oh, it's Valparaiso.</i>

273
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,987
<i>That's down in Chile.</i>

274
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,753
I did a little
hospital work
down there.

275
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,125
Yeah, you were there
three months, huh?

276
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,220
Hmm-mmm.

277
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,095
I see you did a little
better in Goose Liver,
Wyoming.

278
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,532
<i>No, that's Goose River,
Doctor.</i>

279
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,934
Ah, yeah,
you were there
almost four months.

280
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,835
Just about. I was
personal physician
to a wealthy rancher,

281
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,300
till he died.

282
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,500
Died, huh?

283
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,244
<i>Well, that couldn't
have surprised the
poor man.</i>

284
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,851
Pearson, as a doctor
who has been working

285
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,784
in the one community
for 35 years,

286
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,948
I find this
extremely painful.

287
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,926
I was hoping
to get a good man.

288
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,986
A man of substance, a man
who might perhaps stay on

289
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,793
and assist me in
the new hospital, but...

290
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,958
<i>Oh, I couldn't
handle that, Doctor.</i>

291
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,001
<i>I'm leaving
in a couple of
months for Guatemala.</i>

292
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,730
Got my passage booked.

293
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:03,332
<i>Well, fine.
You wouldn't think of
going even sooner, huh?</i>

294
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,342
Right now?
No.

295
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,775
You have nothing to
worry about, Doctor.

296
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,904
<i>I'm really
an able physician.</i>

297
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,041
<i>To be honest, I wouldn't
trust you with me dog.</i>

298
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,641
I find nothing
to recommend you.

299
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,279
<i>Even your accent,
the way you speak, it's...</i>

300
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,755
<i>It's disturbin'
to New England ears.</i>

301
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,056
Where did you acquire
your Yankee accent?

302
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,995
<i>Don't change the subject.</i>

303
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,297
I suppose you
have the agreement,
the letter I signed?

304
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,424
Yeah, sure.

305
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,365
<i>And you regard it
as bindin'?</i>

306
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,993
Of course.
Oh.

307
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,332
Well, Mrs. Gilley will
show you to your room.

308
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,773
Mrs. Gilley.

309
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,806
Mrs. Gilley.

310
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,472
Yes, Doctor.

311
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,122
Pay no mind
to the old fellow.

312
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,924
He can be as ornery
as a hawk in a henhouse.

313
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,258
<i>But he's a good man.</i>

314
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,525
<i>Well, he'll be leaving soon.</i>

315
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,861
Yoo-hoo!

316
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,759
Oh.

317
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,802
Come in.

318
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,503
Oh, Trudy.

319
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,977
<i>Well, it's finished, Doctor.</i>

320
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,241
Me sweater?
Hmm-mmm. For the trip.

321
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,875
One fitting and we can
put the front and
back together.

322
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,782
Take your coat off
and turn around.

323
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,720
<i>I see the new
doctor's here.</i>

324
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,786
Yes.

325
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,054
<i>Trudy, you're a person
I can talk to.</i>

326
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,154
Hmm?

327
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,426
I want to tell you
about that young man.

328
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,488
All right.

329
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:36,690
Who?

330
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,360
Oh, she came in there
a minute ago.

331
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,837
<i>Don't put that satchel
on my clean quilt.</i>

332
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,895
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

333
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,670
She had sort of a checkered
ribbon in her hair.

334
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,507
<i>Oh, that's Trudy Mason.
She's the schoolteacher.</i>

335
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,103
Schoolteacher!

336
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,210
I never had schoolteachers
look like that when I went
to school.

337
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,082
I may go back and
brush up on my spelling.

338
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,054
<i>Well, are you sure
he's incompetent?</i>

339
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,286
<i>I know he's incompetent.
The man's not a doctor,
he's a hobo.</i>

340
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,957
<i>He's never
been in one place for
more than three months.</i>

341
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,794
<i>And he's arrogant about it.</i>

342
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,629
Oh! He sounds dreadful.

343
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,759
He is dreadful.

344
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,565
Well, then
get somebody else.

345
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,573
<i>No, I made
an agreement.
I'm bound in honor.</i>

346
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,971
Besides,
he has it in writing.

347
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:20,902
Oh, dear.

348
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,037
<i>What's wrong?</i>

349
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,479
<i>I'm afraid it isn't
a very good fit.</i>

350
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,175
<i>Oh, I'm sure it's grand.</i>

351
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,616
No, I did the thing
too fast.

352
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,244
<i>Why don't you
pay him off, Doctor?</i>

353
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,845
<i>Well, that's me intention.</i>

354
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,755
<i>But if I do, I can't
get away for a vacation.</i>

355
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,087
<i>Oh, well, that's
out of the question.</i>

356
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,618
<i>You need a vacation
and you're going
to have one.</i>

357
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,767
<i>Oh, it's awful!</i>

358
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,665
<i>Oh, it isn't awful.
No, no, that's grand.</i>

359
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,296
<i>It's roomy. You know,
I like a sweater roomy.</i>

360
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,631
Come in.

361
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,736
Say, Doctor,
did I leave my...

362
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,534
Well?

363
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,614
Well, I was going to pretend
that I came in here on
business, but...

364
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,915
But what?

365
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,745
<i>Oh, that's nice.
That's very attractive.</i>

366
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,279
Hmm.

367
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,448
What is it?

368
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,921
Secret?

369
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,192
<i>It's very obviously
a sweater.</i>

370
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,234
Just one?

371
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,827
<i>I'm afraid
it does look more
like a woolen nightgown.</i>

372
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,397
<i>Well, woolen nightgowns are
here to stay, don't you think?</i>

373
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,443
<i>I don't think I've met
Miss Mason, Doctor.</i>

374
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,481
<i>No, I don't believe
you have.</i>

375
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,414
Miss Mason,
Dr. Pearson.

376
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,543
Delighted to meet you.
How do you do?

377
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,416
<i>You're the teacher
here, huh?</i>

378
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,422
<i>I'll talk to you
later, Doctor.</i>

379
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,923
<i>I'm being dismissed.
Doctor...</i>

380
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,255
No, you are right.
I have been a bad boy.

381
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,626
<i>I sang
in the washroom and
I ate Dr. McRory's fish.</i>

382
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,063
<i>Really?
Now, that'll be just
about enough, young man.</i>

383
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,033
<i>I'm gone.
I'm gone.
I'm gone.</i>

384
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:56,635
<i>See? That's what they
call doctors nowadays.</i>

385
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,800
Dr. Pearson.
Yeah, huh?

386
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,903
I may have
seemed rude.
No.

387
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,880
<i>Well, I didn't
intend to be.</i>

388
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,348
<i>Let's sit down
some place, shall we?</i>

389
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,884
<i>Nothing I'd like better.</i>

390
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,249
In the parlor?

391
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,719
Good idea.

392
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,646
The sofa?

393
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,318
Uh, no,
this chair is fine.

394
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,393
<i>I'm sort of
partial to sofas.</i>

395
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,131
<i>We didn't have any
in the Army, you know.</i>

396
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,860
Fortunately,
we won the war, anyway.

397
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,731
So we did.

398
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,771
<i>I understand you've
done a lot of traveling.</i>

399
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,863
Quite a lot.

400
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,966
<i>Don't you think, Doctor,
after all the things
you've done,</i>

401
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,635
Fallbridge is going to be
very dull?

402
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,308
<i>You don't like me,
do you?</i>

403
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,747
<i>I hadn't thought
much about it.</i>

404
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,808
Do most people?
Like me?

405
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,945
<i>Oh, a fair percentage.
I don't cheat at cards,</i>

406
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:46,184
pay my bills and
I never kicked a big
dog in my entire life.

407
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,321
<i>It's very quiet
in Fallbridge.</i>

408
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,158
Very restful, too.

409
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,598
<i>And it's going to
be awfully cold soon.</i>

410
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,130
<i>It's a little chilly
here right now.</i>

411
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,435
<i>What I mean, Doctor,
is you're obviously
a big city man,</i>

412
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,675
and this is
a small place

413
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,078
and I honestly think
Dr. McRory would
release you,

414
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,579
if you wanted to leave.

415
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,682
Oh, you do, huh?

416
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:13,973
Yes.

417
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,715
Look, Teacher,
school is out.

418
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,845
<i>I'm on my own now.</i>

419
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,823
And I think it would be nice
if I went around making
my own decisions.

420
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,582
Of course.

421
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,923
Thanks, Teach.

422
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,441
A little
hot coffee, Doctor?

423
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,772
Yes, please.

424
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,413
Dr. Pearson?
No, thanks.

425
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,642
Come in.

426
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,088
Hiya.
Oh, Doc.

427
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,750
<i>What's it, Nat?
Oh, good evenin'.</i>

428
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,192
Morton Elkins
over at his barn,
up in the haymow,

429
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,786
fell and hurt his leg.
Bad?

430
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,322
Not good.

431
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,300
Want me to run
over there, Doctor?

432
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,895
<i>No, thank you.
I can manage.
I'll get me bag.</i>

433
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,380
Say, Mrs. Gilley.
Yes?

434
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,710
They have a movie
in this town?

435
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,773
Yes, they do.
Good.

436
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,684
<i>But not tonight.
Picture show's on Tuesday.</i>

437
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,481
<i>What's showing Tuesday?</i>

438
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,787
Some picture
with Bob Hope in lt.

439
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,350
<i>I'll wait
till a week
from Tuesday.</i>

440
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,319
Doctor.
Yeah.

441
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,360
You come along
with me tonight.

442
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,099
With you?

443
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,232
<i>You'll have
a real nice time.</i>

444
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,873
What are we going to do,
hit the hot spots?

445
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,036
Just as soon as I get
the dishes finished up.

446
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,910
<i>Let me help you. Give me
a towel there and we'll
get goin'.</i>

447
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,853
How could a grown man
fall from a hayloft?

448
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,157
He slipped.

449
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,261
Mort Elkins,
you clumsy fool.

450
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,326
Where are you?

451
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,674
<i>There's no one here.
What did you expect,
a brass band?</i>

452
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,505
A brass band.
Now, what kind
of a ridiculous...

453
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,187
<i>Say, what's all this?
Is Morton hurt?</i>

454
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,630
<i>He's over there, Doc.</i>

455
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,225
Oh, sure. Sure.
Over here, Doc.

456
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,237
Here I am.
Oh, it hurts
bad, too, Doc.

457
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,170
<i>See, can't hardly
do this anymore.</i>

458
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,043
Mort, you old
scalawag, ya!

459
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,709
Here, you can set his leg.

460
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,987
Wait till I get this
through me head.

461
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,186
Come on, Doctor.
Have some punch
or cider.

462
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,390
Great to see you, Doc.

463
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,693
Have a good time, Doc.

464
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,324
This is very
embarrassing,
Trudy.

465
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,835
<i>Embarrassing?
A farewell party
and I'm not going away.</i>

466
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,063
Oh, but you are
going away.

467
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,003
<i>But I can't.
Well, why not?</i>

468
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:28,006
Attention, everybody,
attention. Up here, Doc.

469
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,275
And Trudy.

470
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,317
Oh, of course.
You, too, Trudy.

471
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,684
<i>We've got
to have Maine's prettiest
schoolmarm on the platform.</i>

472
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,484
Well, here we are.

473
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,525
Sit down, everybody.
Sit down.

474
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,117
<i>Let's have it
quiet, please.</i>

475
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:47,995
We have here in Fallbridge
the biggest little chamber
of commerce in Maine.

476
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:51,832
<i>And I'm going
to call on its president,
your friend and pharmacist,</i>

477
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,098
and my son,
Mr. Roy Chesley.

478
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,400
Thank you,
Mr. Chesley.

479
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,071
Ladies and gentlemen,

480
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,847
I dare say that when
more than half of you
first came into the world,

481
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,854
and first
opened your eyes,

482
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,880
the first man you saw
was our guest of honor.

483
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,791
A man who has served this
community and served it well.

484
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,828
<i>You're looking very nice
this evening, Mrs. Gilley.</i>

485
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,890
Thanks.

486
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,395
<i>Place we're going
ain't no hot spot.</i>

487
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,770
<i>It ain't?</i>

488
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,604
<i>You shouldn't
say "ain't," Doctor.</i>

489
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,109
You say it.

490
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,475
I live here.

491
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,847
<i>When you say it, it sounds
like you're making fun of us.</i>

492
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,247
<i>Oh, I wouldn't do that.</i>

493
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,182
<i>Not for the world,
'cause I like you.</i>

494
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:43,849
Well,

495
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,221
<i>you won't be
so bad yourself</i>

496
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,021
once you learn not
to talk all the time.

497
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,723
Now, a word
from Trudy Mason.

498
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,061
Oh, Trudy.

499
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,197
Dr. McRory,
your friends,

500
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,333
and that means
all of us here
in Fallbridge,

501
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,934
want you to have
this for your trip,

502
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,939
with all our love.

503
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,877
Well, uh, thanks.

504
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,248
Open the bag.
Look inside, Doc.
Look inside.

505
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,846
Go ahead.
Look inside.

506
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,321
What in the world is this?

507
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,725
<i>It's your new
hospital, Doctor.
That's right.</i>

508
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,388
<i>Ain't that
a neat little model?</i>

509
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,795
Mort did a good
job of it.

510
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,390
The excavating
starts next week.

511
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:33,631
<i>That's right. And we've
got every dime raised, Doc.</i>

512
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,906
Well, well.

513
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,970
<i>You're good people,
all of you.</i>

514
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,513
Uh, and...

515
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:55,482
<i>As on this date,
all outstandin' bills
due to me are cancelled.</i>

516
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,549
Every penny.

517
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,192
<i>I don't think
I've felt like this</i>

518
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,171
<i>since I was a little kid
on Christmas mornin'.</i>

519
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:12,870
Good evening, Mrs. Gilley.

520
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,104
Good evening.

521
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,339
<i>That's all.</i>

522
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,607
<i>Who's he?</i>

523
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,670
Evening, Mrs. Gilley.

524
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,182
Good evening.

525
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,150
Good evening, Abbie.

526
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,881
Good evening.

527
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,424
Hello.

528
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,982
Good evening.

529
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,095
Dr. Pearson,
this is Roy Chesley.

530
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,289
How do you do?

531
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,888
Glad to meet you.
Well, thank you.

532
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,831
And his father,
Mr. C.J. Chesley.

533
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,194
How do you do, sir?

534
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,897
Pearson, Trudy and
I were discussing you.

535
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,098
<i>Why, that's
very flattering.</i>

536
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,572
<i>I'm president
of the Fallbridge
Chamber of Commerce...</i>

537
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,541
Oh, really?
Say, would you
hold this a minute?

538
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,202
Miss Mason and I
have this dance.

539
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,075
Oh, uh... Well...

540
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,486
Uh-huh.

541
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,819
Doc, Trudy told me about
your problem with that fellow.

542
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,256
Let me handle him.

543
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,315
No, no.

544
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,394
<i>There's a friend of mine
in Augusta. Dr. Jenks.
He's a fine MD.</i>

545
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,091
He can be here Friday.

546
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,604
Well, looks
good enough
to eat.

547
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,335
<i>Really heartwarming, this
New England hospitality,
isn't it?</i>

548
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,409
All these nice,
friendly faces.

549
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:27,816
Fella down at the board of
education was telling me of
a new ruling they have there.

550
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,344
Guess he must
have been wrong.

551
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:31,410
What ruling?

552
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:34,287
They told me it was okay now
for schoolteachers to smile.

553
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,428
Oh, yes, he must
have been wrong.

554
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,459
Well, I heard that...

555
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,860
Well, I must
have been wrong, too.

556
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,266
Could be.
What have you heard?

557
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,703
Oh, the impression I had
that doctors always had
good manners.

558
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,035
May I?

559
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,302
Of course.

560
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,905
Dr. Pearson.
Hmm.

561
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,238
<i>I'm Bill Walters.</i>

562
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,374
Yeah?

563
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:05,389
<i>Editor, reporter, copy boy
of the town's leading and
only newspaper.</i>

564
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,390
<i>So?
I'm drunk.</i>

565
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,855
That was my diagnosis.

566
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,896
I wanna give you
a little advice.

567
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,862
Get drunk.

568
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,623
<i>The town's more
charming that way.</i>

569
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,361
<i>Well, I'll sleep on it.</i>

570
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,530
Folks. Attention.
Attention, please.

571
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,868
<i>I've got some
disappointing news.
No square dances tonight.</i>

572
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,809
<i>I'm sorry, but Jeff Hawkins
just phoned from Bentonville.</i>

573
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,610
<i>He has to work tonight
and he can't be here
to do the call.</i>

574
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,951
<i>It's my big chance.
Oh, Mr. Chesley.</i>

575
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,214
Yes?

576
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,488
I learned a little bit
about these barn dances
when I was out in Wyoming.

577
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,789
Do you mind if I try?

578
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,126
Get your partners
for a square dance, huh?

579
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,865
<i>Say, do you fellas
know Country Style?</i>

580
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,924
Yeah, we do, but...

581
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:55,404
Young man, we are
perfectly capable of
managing our own affairs.

582
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,998
<i>And we don't have any
square dances without
Jeff Hawkins.</i>

583
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,270
<i>Well, it's a shame
he isn't here.</i>

584
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,437
Then we could have
done a very nice duet.

585
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,740
Contact.

586
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,610
All set?

587
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,484
<i>Well,
you pull up your pants
You tighten your traces</i>

588
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,649
<i>You all join hands
You're off to the races</i>

589
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,750
<i>Break your holds
and you backtrack back</i>

590
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,886
<i>Promenade, single file</i>

591
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,930
<i>Ladies in the lead
that Indian style</i>

592
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,228
<i>And swing that gal
behind you</i>

593
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,200
<i>Cut across and swing Grandpa</i>

594
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,327
<i>He ain't been swung
since last fall</i>

595
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,464
<i>Ladies start a-center
Gents on a little side bet</i>

596
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,336
<i>Meet your partner
You ain't through yet</i>

597
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,708
<i>It's four hands 'round
with the couple you met</i>

598
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,713
<i>Four hands up
and around you go</i>

599
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,976
<i>And when you get straight
it's a do-see-do</i>

600
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,109
<i>Chicken in the bread pan
picking out the dough</i>

601
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,948
<i>Grab your partners
A- home you go</i>

602
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,250
<i>Ladies to the center
Back to the bar</i>

603
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,418
<i>Gents to the center
You form a star</i>

604
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,394
<i>Pick your partner, promenade</i>

605
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,623
<i>Around the track
Don't stay in the shade</i>

606
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,666
<i>Gents swing out
and the ladies swing in</i>

607
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,792
<i>They cross their hands
and you're off again</i>

608
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,860
<i>Ladies swing out
and you all eight swing</i>

609
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,996
<i>Now you're back home
in the same old ring</i>

610
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,098
<i>First and third,
you balance and swing</i>

611
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,200
<i>Down the center
Divide the ring</i>

612
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,336
<i>Ladies go east
and the gents go west</i>

613
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,381
<i>Meet in line
Four abreast</i>

614
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,541
<i>Forward eight
and fall back eight</i>

615
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,642
<i>Forward again with
a right and a left</i>

616
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,516
<i>Cross the hall
and you pass them all</i>

617
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,112
<i>And take that
very pretty gal with you</i>

618
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,391
<i>Meet your partner
Promenade eight</i>

619
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,694
<i>Round the old track
till you come out straight</i>

620
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,593
<i>First and third
You balance and swing</i>

621
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,637
<i>You lead right out
to the right of the ring</i>

622
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,899
<i>You right and left through
and a right and left back</i>

623
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,964
<i>Promenade all around
the track</i>

624
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,405
<i>When it comes
to fancy dancin'</i>

625
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,643
<i>Or to music with a smile</i>

626
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,049
<i>Or to nice romancin'</i>

627
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,020
<i>Make mine country style</i>

628
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,057
<i>When it comes
to hands that hold ya</i>

629
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,388
<i>Eyes that shine about a mile</i>

630
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,519
<i>Like I just now told ya</i>

631
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,529
<i>Make mine country style</i>

632
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,565
<i>Hear that fiddle</i>

633
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,862
<i>I could listen all night</i>

634
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,869
<i>Hear that banjo</i>

635
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,132
<i>Ain't that somethin'?
Darn right</i>

636
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,333
<i>Dance and share
a lovin' cup</i>

637
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,433
<i>With different partners
for a while</i>

638
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,876
<i>But for hitchin' up with</i>

639
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:19,311
<i>Make mine country style</i>

640
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,482
<i>When it comes
to fancy dancin'</i>

641
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,490
<i>Or to music with a smile</i>

642
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,924
<i>Or to nice romancin'</i>

643
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,791
<i>Make mine country style</i>

644
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,854
<i>When it comes
to hands that hold ya</i>

645
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,195
<i>Eyes that shine about a mile</i>

646
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,497
<i>Like I just now told ya</i>

647
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,469
<i>Make mine country style</i>

648
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,267
<i>Catch that couple</i>

649
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,771
<i>Cosh all hemlock
Gee whiz</i>

650
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,003
<i>Ain't that snappy?</i>

651
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,205
<i>Ain't that steppin'?
Sure is</i>

652
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,339
<i>Dance and share a lovin' cup</i>

653
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,440
<i>With different partners
for a while</i>

654
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,748
<i>But for hitchin' up with</i>

655
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:02,055
<i>Make mine country style</i>

656
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,888
<i>Country style</i>

657
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,326
How about
a nice waltz?

658
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,233
Okay.
Number four, fellas.

659
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,319
Pardon me.
Huh?

660
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,282
<i>No, Trudy,
it's Pearson I want.</i>

661
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,523
Well, no, I think
I prefer to dance
with Miss Mason.

662
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,030
<i>She's prettier.</i>

663
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,998
<i>Hello, Trudy.
You'll pardon me?</i>

664
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,329
Yeah.

665
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,136
<i>Pearson, you're not going to
win any popularity contests
in Fallbridge.</i>

666
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,935
<i>I haven't entered any.</i>

667
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,975
You know, I learned
how to handle fellows
like you in the Army.

668
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,135
I was a captain.

669
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,510
Well, I learned how
to handle captains.
I was a major.

670
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,173
Let me give you some advice.
Are you a lawyer?

671
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,682
<i>No, I'm a pharmacist.</i>

672
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,150
Well,
I might send you some of
my prescription business.

673
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,085
<i>Oh, say, some day
I wish you'd show me</i>

674
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,089
how to make
a good banana split.

675
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,421
I do love banana splits.

676
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,559
Pardon me.

677
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,322
Cutting in seems to be
your specialty, Doctor.

678
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,797
<i>Oh, no,
I'm a general practitioner.</i>

679
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,233
Do you
generally go around
making friends this way?

680
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,999
<i>I'd rather concentrate
on just making one friend.</i>

681
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,002
I like blue eyes.

682
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:28,239
<i>Am I supposed
to say, "Thank you, Doctor.
I'm glad you like blue eyes"?</i>

683
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,603
Well, you could
say that.

684
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,911
<i>But I'd just
as soon you looked up
and gave me a nice smile.</i>

685
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,845
I like your smile, too.

686
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,515
Is that
the shipboard approach
or the bedside manner?

687
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,319
Teacher.

688
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,890
<i>You know, I can't
really figure out</i>

689
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,863
which of
the Chesleys
I dislike more.

690
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,490
Roy or his father.

691
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,693
Oh?

692
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,135
<i>I guess Roy, though.
I guess he's a little more
obnoxious, don't you think?</i>

693
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,467
Dr. Pearson.
What?

694
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:59,134
Roy and I are
going to be married.
Thanks for the dance.

695
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,025
<i>Seems downright stubborn,
you goin' away so
sudden-like.</i>

696
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,958
I did plan to
stay a little longer.

697
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,929
<i>You haven't
told the Doctor?</i>

698
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,158
<i>I haven't seen him,
but he'll be delighted.</i>

699
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,024
Old fool!

700
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,735
<i>I'm driving you
to the bus.</i>

701
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,032
You are?

702
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,335
<i>In Andy Weaver's
pickup truck.</i>

703
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,670
And we can take
this with us, too.

704
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,711
<i>There's no sense in your
wasting your money on
that Dorkas.</i>

705
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,747
<i>I'll appreciate that,
Mrs. Gilley.</i>

706
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,977
<i>I'll take
your horse blanket.</i>

707
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,351
Just about the shortest
engagement I ever had.

708
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,387
<i>Make mine city style</i>

709
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,557
<i>Oh, my achin' back.</i>

710
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,830
<i>Aren't we going the
wrong way?</i>

711
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:00,928
No.

712
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,203
<i>Before leaving,
you'll want to
see the Doctor.</i>

713
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,333
Oh.

714
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,041
There he is.

715
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,884
Why, that old phony.

716
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,752
<i>Didn't he tell you
he had an urgent
pneumonia case?</i>

717
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,988
He did.

718
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,530
<i>How'd you know
he was here, then?</i>

719
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,931
<i>Fishing poles and boots
don't cure pneumonia.</i>

720
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,491
Take your time, Doctor.

721
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,900
<i>The bus don't
leave till 4:00.</i>

722
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,496
<i>I'll be back.</i>

723
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,214
<i>Hey! How's Mrs. Hickey
comin' along?</i>

724
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,250
<i>Huh?
How's Mrs. Hickey doin'?</i>

725
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,949
Oh, her pneumonia
is better. Much better.

726
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,885
Oh, glad to hear that.

727
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,386
Young man,
are you spying on me?

728
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:01,022
<i>No, I've just come to
tell you I was leaving.</i>

729
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,763
Are you now? Well...

730
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,196
Ah, yes.

731
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,201
<i>You'll not be leaving
for a couple of weeks?</i>

732
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,533
Next bus.

733
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,464
<i>Pearson,
I'm an honest man.</i>

734
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,805
<i>I'll not pretend
I'm going to miss you.</i>

735
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:13,969
<i>But I'd be
greatly obliged</i>

736
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,979
<i>if you'd stay on
for a fortnight when
I have a good doctor coming.</i>

737
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:21,245
Oh, that is, this man Jenks
is most highly recommended.
Roy Chesley says he...

738
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,377
<i>I thought you told me
you wouldn't hire
a man again</i>

739
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,115
without seeing him first.

740
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,417
Well, yes, I did.

741
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,822
<i>But this
could be nothin'
but an improvement.</i>

742
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,582
Improvement?

743
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,458
<i>Why don't we start
the improvement
right now, then.</i>

744
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,656
Goodbye, Doctor.

745
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:35,726
Pearson!
What?

746
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,926
Be reasonable.

747
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,298
I want to start
me trip on Friday.

748
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,358
No.

749
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,372
<i>Now, I'm not asking you to
handle any difficult cases.</i>

750
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,772
If anything serious
comes up before
Jenks arrives,

751
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,402
Wheaton will come over
from Bentonville.

752
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,537
No. Next bus. Goodbye.

753
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:53,341
<i>I'll give you
a cash bonus
if you stay.</i>

754
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,946
Say $10... Say $5.

755
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,044
You said $10.

756
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,145
Did I?
Yeah.

757
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,553
All right, Doctor, $10.

758
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:04,754
<i>No, Doctor.
The town doesn't like me
and I don't like the town.</i>

759
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,319
I better get out today.

760
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,558
<i>You'll never
catch anything with
that routine, either.</i>

761
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,600
<i>I've been fishin' here
for 35 years.</i>

762
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,158
Have you now?

763
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,667
<i>Then maybe it's time
you had a few suggestions.</i>

764
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,762
Do you mind?

765
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,070
<i>So you're
a fisherman, too?</i>

766
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,575
Well, I ought to be
a standout in this league.

767
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,077
Let me see this
equipment you got here.

768
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,671
What are you doing
with this big buoy on?

769
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:25,874
My heavens!

770
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,815
<i>I like to get the hook
down into the fish's
living room.</i>

771
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,115
Down deep.
Down where the money is.

772
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,921
<i>Let's see.</i>

773
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,250
Get it way out there, deep.

774
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,419
There we are.

775
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,058
Stand by for action.

776
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:44,698
<i>Well, that's interesting.
Very interesting.</i>

777
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,627
<i>You'll stay for
a couple of weeks, eh?</i>

778
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,131
No.

779
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,638
<i>My heart is a hobo</i>

780
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:58,181
<i>Loves to roam through
fields of clover</i>

781
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,750
Are you
deliberately trying
to scare away the fish?

782
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,446
On the contrary.

783
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,752
Best audience I ever had
was an eight pound trout.

784
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,883
How he loved
boogie-woogie.

785
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,791
<i>My heart is a hobo</i>

786
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,300
<i>Loves to roam through
fields of clover</i>

787
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:21,000
<i>Hates to have
to think things over</i>

788
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:25,508
<i>And though it's wrong
I string along</i>

789
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,610
<i>My heart is a hobo</i>

790
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,137
<i>Loves to go out
berry-picking</i>

791
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,748
<i>Hates to hear
alarm clocks ticking</i>

792
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:40,380
<i>It isn't smart
But that's my heart</i>

793
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,684
<i>When hopes are out
at the elbows</i>

794
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:47,390
<i>And dreams are run down
at the heels</i>

795
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,299
<i>My heart refuses to worry</i>

796
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,296
<i>Except about
rods and reels</i>

797
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,341
<i>My heart is a hobo</i>

798
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,004
<i>Loves to quote
from Omar Khayyam</i>

799
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,646
<i>Hates the stodgy guy
that I am</i>

800
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,377
<i>And though it's strange</i>

801
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,944
<i>I just can't change
my heart</i>

802
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,124
Doc! Bill Walters
is in bad shape.

803
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,957
I just took him home.

804
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,257
<i>What's it?
Whiskey?</i>

805
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,061
<i>No. One of his
bustin' headaches.</i>

806
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,065
Tell him to take two of
the capsules I gave him.

807
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,705
Well...

808
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,639
Is that the
newspaper fellow?

809
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,697
Yeah.

810
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,969
What causes
the headaches?

811
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,203
Wish I knew.

812
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,075
<i>Don't you think he ought
to be seen? Be examined?</i>

813
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,374
Examination
shows nothing.

814
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,348
<i>I've had him in me
office a dozen times.</i>

815
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,940
<i>I think
I'll run over and
take a look at him. Here.</i>

816
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,986
You?
Yeah. Doctor.

817
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,521
<i>I don't think I could stay
for a fortnight, but I'll
tell you what I'll do.</i>

818
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,420
<i>What?
I'll stay a couple of weeks.</i>

819
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,025
Coming
right with you, Nat.

820
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:54,459
<i>Used up about 20 cents
worth of gas gettin'
out here.</i>

821
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,500
<i>Well, I'll take your
temperature sometime.
On the house.</i>

822
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,765
<i>My heart is a hobo</i>

823
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:07,003
<i>Loves to roam through
fields of clover</i>

824
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,858
<i>Doctor, Nat's still
waiting for you.</i>

825
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,728
<i>Well, tell him to go ahead.
I'll walk home.</i>

826
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,495
Come on in, Emily.

827
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,327
<i>Did you find out what's
wrong with him, Doctor?</i>

828
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,738
<i>No, I'm afraid not.
I'd like to have been
here during the attack.</i>

829
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,377
<i>Blood pressure's a little
high, but that shouldn't
do it.</i>

830
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,845
A dozen doctors
have told me that.

831
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,108
Pretty interesting
case, huh?

832
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,687
<i>I'd like to speak to
your father alone,
Emily, huh?</i>

833
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:56,882
Yes, sir.

834
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,054
Want a drink?
No, thanks.

835
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,423
Would you guess, Doctor,

836
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,960
<i>that the present editor
of the Fallbridge Weekly
once won a Pulitzer Prize?</i>

837
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,165
Well, I did,
back in Boston.

838
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,466
Were you drinking
better whiskey then?

839
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,136
<i>I wasn't drinking then.
Whiskey isn't why I'm here.</i>

840
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,703
<i>The reason I'm here is
because you can't work
on a daily paper</i>

841
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:21,114
and have your head
splitting wide open
half the time.

842
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,952
I might be able
to find out something
about those headaches

843
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,717
<i>if I could examine you
some day when you're
not drinking.</i>

844
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,088
<i>Why don't
you lay off for,
well, till Friday?</i>

845
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,224
<i>I could say I would,
but a drunk's promise
isn't worth very much.</i>

846
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,335
<i>That's a mighty sweet kid
you have there.</i>

847
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,334
Yeah.

848
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,712
Pretty busy girl, huh?

849
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:53,977
Mmm-hmm.

850
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,879
Oh, Doctor.
Yes.

851
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,313
Do you think
you can help him?

852
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:59,855
<i>Well, I'm going
to try, Emily.</i>

853
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,413
Oh, please do.

854
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,984
<i>I'm not sure,
but I have a hunch</i>

855
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,586
<i>your father isn't
going to drink
for awhile.</i>

856
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,130
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

857
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,064
<i>Don't you go
to school, Emily?</i>

858
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,528
<i>When Papa's well, I do.</i>

859
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,532
<i>Doctor,
we won't be able
to pay you for a while.</i>

860
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,509
<i>Well, that's all right.</i>

861
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,845
<i>You can pay me
when you've married some
big billionaire lumberman.</i>

862
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,541
With 4% interest.

863
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,479
<i>I'm going to marry
a newspaper man.</i>

864
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:28,984
<i>We'll waive
the interest.</i>

865
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,110
Emily!

866
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,413
Oh.

867
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,018
<i>I'll have to put off
making any resolutions
till tomorrow, Doctor.</i>

868
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,220
I just found
another bottle.

869
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,058
<i>I'd better...
I'd better fix his supper.</i>

870
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,139
<i>And your ticket,
you haven't forgotten
your ticket?</i>

871
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:59,171
<i>You asked me
that twice, Mrs. Gilley.
It's in me wallet. I think.</i>

872
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,144
And your woolen muffler?

873
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,480
Yes, in me wallet.

874
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:03,679
Where the blue blazes
is Pearson?

875
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,187
No occasion for
profanity, Doctor.

876
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:06,654
All right,
all right,
all right.

877
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,520
Now, bear in mind,
anything important,

878
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,991
telephone Dr. Wheaton
in Bentonville.

879
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,493
Yes, you told that
to Dr. Pearson.

880
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,587
Oh, that Pearson!

881
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,222
<i>Now, he knows I'm leaving.</i>

882
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,357
<i>Oh, it's you, Nat.</i>

883
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,958
Will you take these out,
Mr. Dorkas?

884
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:20,802
Nice bag.

885
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,235
Makes the others
look terrible.

886
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,003
<i>You didn't see Pearson?
No.</i>

887
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,044
<i>And don't forget
these, Mr. Dorkas.</i>

888
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,545
I only got two hands,
Mrs. Gilley.

889
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,949
<i>Well, I'll wait
two minutes longer.</i>

890
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,918
Doctor!
Huh?

891
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,945
Emily!
Good afternoon.

892
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,046
<i>What's your hurry?</i>

893
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,149
<i>Well, I just saw you and
I thought I'd get home
before it started raining.</i>

894
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,421
I see.

895
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,753
<i>How's your dad?</i>

896
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,263
<i>He's fine.
He hasn't been...</i>

897
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,063
<i>He's fine.</i>

898
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:51,959
Good.

899
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,069
He has confidence
in you, Doctor.
I have, too.

900
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,129
<i>Oh, I'm glad about that.</i>

901
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,139
Doctor.
Huh?

902
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,310
I must have
sounded awfully vain

903
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,006
when I told
you I was going to
marry a newspaperman.

904
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,811
<i>But still, men do marry
girls who aren't pretty,
don't they?</i>

905
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:11,344
Well, you have
nothing to worry about.
A gal with your good looks.

906
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,679
Doctor.
Hmm?

907
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,124
If I asked you a question,
I mean casually, not like
a visit,

908
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,287
well, would there be a fee?

909
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:22,821
Well, it depends upon
how casually you ask
the question.

910
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,124
You see,
I was wondering...

911
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,192
I saw in
a newspaper
advertisement

912
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,262
that if you send in a dollar,
well, they send you back
something for freckles.

913
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,569
Freckles?
Do you think
you need any more?

914
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,303
<i>Oh, I mean
to get rid of 'em.</i>

915
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,503
Oh, you must be kidding.

916
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,636
<i>But I'm not.</i>

917
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,179
<i>Well, it's a good thing
you came to me then,</i>

918
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,147
because I want to
straighten you out
on something.

919
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:43,118
<i>Don't you know that in
New York, Paris and
Hollywood, too,</i>

920
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,886
women are not considered
smart unless they have
freckles.

921
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,822
Those glamour girls,
they sit around in
the sun all day

922
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,757
just trying to pick up a few.
They do?

923
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,385
<i>You've read about
Cleopatra, haven't you?</i>

924
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:53,554
Yes.

925
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,222
And her freckles?

926
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,357
Did she have freckles?

927
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,458
Why, they used
to call her Speck.

928
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,531
Thank you, Doctor.

929
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,909
<i>I don't believe a word
you said, but thank you.</i>

930
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,466
So long, Cleo.

931
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,309
<i>Well, Nat,
what's the latest
scuttle on the weather?</i>

932
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,247
<i>See it bankin' up
over there?</i>

933
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,376
Yeah, got it.

934
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,680
<i>Be comin' down soon.</i>

935
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,118
<i>That's your
considered opinion, huh?</i>

936
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:19,280
Yeah.

937
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,651
The young blatherskite.

938
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:23,988
<i>He knows I'm leavin'.
Now, now, now.</i>

939
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,222
<i>Don't get yourself
overheated.</i>

940
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,729
<i>Here's your umbrella.</i>

941
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,163
<i>You haven't been
feelin' too well.</i>

942
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,563
And how could
I feel well?

943
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,896
<i>Haven't you left yet,
Doctor?</i>

944
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,698
And how could I leave
without giving you
instructions?

945
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,362
I thought I had
my instructions.

946
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,373
<i>If anybody gets sick,
I'm to call Dr. Wheaton.</i>

947
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,739
Young man, I can do
without the sarcasm.

948
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,710
Now, Wheaton will come
over for serious cases.
Okay.

949
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:42,870
You stay here
till Jenks arrives.

950
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,174
Right.

951
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:47,410
See that Mrs. Sims takes
calcium tablets for
her chilblains.

952
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,644
Calcium tablets.
Yeah.

953
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,311
And give Miss Lennek
some sugar pills.

954
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:51,445
Sugar pills?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

955
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,113
<i>She thinks she's ill.
Oh, I get it.</i>

956
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,852
<i>Yeah, and Mat Tewson's
carbuncle's about ready
for lancing.</i>

957
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,018
All right.
Yes.

958
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,062
And you might
drop in on Mrs. Krelly.

959
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,653
Her baby is about due.

960
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,825
<i>Doctor, do you think
I'm quite capable
of delivering a baby?</i>

961
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,300
<i>Frankly, no. But I'm not
worrying about Mrs. Krelly.</i>

962
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,860
<i>She's had 10.</i>

963
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,333
<i>She'll tell you what to do.</i>

964
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,733
<i>It's starting to rain.</i>

965
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,868
Oh, all right.
I have me umbrella.

966
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,105
Well, goodbye, Mrs. Gilley.

967
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:20,081
<i>Well, I'm...
Nat's gonna drop me off
at the Ladies' Aide.</i>

968
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:23,313
So long, Doctor.
Hope you have good fishing.

969
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,082
Goodbye.

970
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,679
Now, remember, no surgeries.

971
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,191
No surgeries.

972
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,188
<i>Miss Lennek's sugar pills.</i>

973
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,597
Mrs. Sims gets
some calcium tablets.

974
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,831
<i>Mat Tewson's carbuncle's
about ready to pluck.</i>

975
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:46,235
<i>Oh, Doctor, I'll run back
and get you a little
baking soda.</i>

976
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,106
You will not.
Get in there.

977
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,578
<i>Everyone thinks
he's a doctor
around here.</i>

978
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:51,739
Drive on at once!

979
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,186
<i>My heart is a hobo</i>

980
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,892
<i>Loves to roam through
fields of clover</i>

981
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,054
<i>Hates to have
to think things over</i>

982
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:14,593
<i>And though it's wrong
I string along</i>

983
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,571
<i>My heart is a hobo</i>

984
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,811
<i>Loves to go out
berry-picking</i>

985
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,176
<i>Hates to hear
alarm clocks...</i>

986
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,374
Hello.

987
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,742
Oh, hello.

988
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,078
<i>I've missed him,
haven't I?</i>

989
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,815
Dr. McRory? Yeah,
a few minutes ago.

990
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,153
<i>My car wouldn't start.</i>

991
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,193
<i>You couldn't lend me
an umbrella, could you?</i>

992
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,888
<i>Well, ordinarily,
there's a small charge
for that service,</i>

993
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:42,431
<i>but in your case,
we'll waive it.
Help yourself.</i>

994
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,057
<i>Thank you.
Don't let it
get around, huh?</i>

995
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,567
<i>No, I won't.</i>

996
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:51,266
Oh, say, Teach, I have
some good news for you.

997
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,036
You have?
Mmm-hmm.

998
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,470
<i>I'll be leaving soon.</i>

999
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:57,445
<i>Well, I'm sorry
there won't be time
for a civic celebration,</i>

1000
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,744
<i>but I'm sure
the town is grateful.</i>

1001
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:05,183
<i>Oh, you know, those
are the first kind words
I've heard in Fallbridge.</i>

1002
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:12,560
<i>My heart is a hobo</i>

1003
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:16,897
<i>Loves to quote
from Omar Khayyam</i>

1004
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,493
<i>Hates the stodgy guy
that I am</i>

1005
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,936
<i>And though it's strange</i>

1006
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,106
<i>I just can't
change my heart</i>

1007
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,303
Dr. Pearson!
Dr. Pearson!

1008
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:29,572
Open up! Open up!

1009
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,274
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1010
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,716
What happened?

1011
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,810
Well, we get to the bus
and he seemed to be fine.

1012
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,253
Pain in me stomach.

1013
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,414
<i>Let's get this
wet coat off.</i>

1014
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,889
We no more
than shake hands,

1015
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,426
he keeled over, like
he was kicked by a mule.

1016
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,586
Help me carry him
in the office.

1017
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,686
No, no.
I can walk.

1018
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,128
<i>I'll help you.</i>

1019
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,324
What is it?

1020
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,491
<i>I don't know.
Will you wait here?</i>

1021
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,865
Pearson,
call Dr. Wheaton.

1022
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,373
<i>He's sick. Mighty sick.</i>

1023
00:52:58,441 --> 00:52:59,601
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1024
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,611
<i>I ain't no doctor
and I don't think
Pearson is neither.</i>

1025
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,840
Well, call me
if you need me.

1026
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,014
Call Dr. Wheaton.

1027
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,717
We will, Doctor.

1028
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,782
Oh, me appendix.

1029
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,919
Probably have to come out.

1030
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,223
Trudy!

1031
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,566
<i>Pearson, I wish
you'd let me alone.</i>

1032
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,062
<i>Take it easy, Doctor.
Now, you've had your
finger jabbed before.</i>

1033
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:28,931
Certainly.

1034
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,599
<i>I don't mind a little thing
like that.</i>

1035
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,239
<i>You don't have
to jab me so deep.</i>

1036
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,241
One, two, three, four, five.

1037
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:39,507
<i>What's
the blood count?</i>

1038
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,313
Wait a minute.
Nine lymps, two monocytes,

1039
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,211
16,000 whites, 89% polys.

1040
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,818
Oh, Trudy,
call Dr. Wheaton.

1041
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,088
Bentonville 1-4-8.

1042
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:54,487
1-4 what?

1043
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,760
Bentonville 1-4-8.

1044
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,495
Bentonville 1-4...

1045
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,662
Look, please
get off the line.
This is an emergency call.

1046
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,433
<i>Dr. McRory's office.</i>

1047
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:06,202
<i>It's that chatterbox,
Mrs. Higgins, I suppose.</i>

1048
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:10,043
Thank you.

1049
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,712
Operator?

1050
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,074
Bentonville 1-4-8.

1051
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,947
Was it Mrs. Higgins?

1052
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,487
Mrs. Sims.

1053
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,386
That one is just as bad.

1054
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,919
<i>I don't think I'd put
off the operation, Doctor.</i>

1055
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,627
Nice vacation!

1056
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,163
Hello.
Is Dr. Wheaton there?

1057
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,291
Oh.

1058
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,697
<i>He's gone to Elktown
on a confinement case.
He won't be back until 10:00.</i>

1059
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,205
<i>We can't wait, Doctor.</i>

1060
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,036
<i>Can't? We must wait.</i>

1061
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,971
<i>I'd take you to
the Bentonville
hospital myself.</i>

1062
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:43,638
<i>But it's a long trip
in the rain and
the roads are rough.</i>

1063
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,179
<i>I'd better
operate here.</i>

1064
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,576
You?

1065
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:54,456
Pearson, I may be
a very sick man but me
mind is perfectly clear.

1066
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:57,956
<i>I'd as soon call in
Sweeney The Butcher.</i>

1067
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,388
<i>Let's be sensible,
Doctor.</i>

1068
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,863
<i>I know
that you don't have
any confidence in me,</i>

1069
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,763
<i>but there isn't
any other choice.</i>

1070
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,131
Your pulse is 108.

1071
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,837
Trudy, call Dr. Blodgett
of Millbrook.

1072
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,302
Is this Millbrook
near here?

1073
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:15,708
Over 90 miles.

1074
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,474
Look, Doctor...
No.

1075
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:18,638
You speak to him,
Miss Mason.

1076
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,205
You know what
a perforated appendix can do.

1077
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:21,511
The danger
of peritonitis.

1078
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,415
Dr. McRory, please.

1079
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,818
It has to
be done, Doctor,
and immediately.

1080
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,255
Pearson, I warn you, if
you operate against me will,

1081
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,816
<i>you'll go to prison
for manslaughter.</i>

1082
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:32,922
<i>Doctor, you've had a lot
more experience than I have.</i>

1083
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,055
Now, what would you do with
a patient as ornery, as cranky

1084
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:37,429
and as downright
disagreeable as you are?

1085
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,430
<i>Now, that's not
a fair question.</i>

1086
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,136
<i>Come on, Doctor,
we'll get you ready
for the operation.</i>

1087
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,106
No, no.

1088
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,171
Pearson,
have you operated before?

1089
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,507
Certainly.
Well...

1090
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,211
<i>Miss Mason,
you're going to help me.</i>

1091
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,412
What?
Mmm-hmm.

1092
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,122
Well, all right.

1093
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,525
Come on, Doctor.

1094
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,990
<i>Well, I've had a good life.</i>

1095
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:19,004
<i>Me fishin' tackle
goes to Mort Elkins,
a true friend.</i>

1096
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,411
Andy Weaver is
to have me pipes.

1097
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,605
Doctor.

1098
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,581
No, no,
write it down
as I tell you, Trudy.

1099
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,910
<i>Mrs. Gilley...
I'm sorry, Doctor,</i>

1100
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,885
but Miss Mason will have
to give up her legal work.

1101
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,012
I need a nurse.

1102
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,249
Me house goes
to Mrs. Gilley

1103
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:39,117
and me war bonds and
savings go to you,
Trudy,

1104
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,655
and to little
Emily Walters.

1105
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,230
<i>Pearson, you're a witness.</i>

1106
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:46,028
<i>Come on, you'll be up
playing football in
three weeks.</i>

1107
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:48,093
No. I know.

1108
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:55,635
Even with a good surgeon,
10% of peritonitis cases
are lost.

1109
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:59,438
<i>Well, then
you needn't worry.
I've already lost my 10%.</i>

1110
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,140
<i>What are you doin' there?</i>

1111
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,382
Put that away!

1112
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,584
<i>I'll take no ether.</i>

1113
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:08,590
I want a local
anesthetic, Pearson.

1114
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,122
Now, be reasonable,
Doctor.

1115
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,285
<i>I'd like to
give you a spinal</i>

1116
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,022
if I had somebody to
watch your blood pressure.

1117
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,792
And who said anything
about a spinal?

1118
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,059
I said a local.

1119
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,293
Oh, Doctor!

1120
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,394
<i>Believe me, Pearson,
you'll be grateful
for my supervision.</i>

1121
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,098
<i>I've had a lot
of experience.</i>

1122
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:26,336
<i>Well, I've told you this
isn't my first operation.</i>

1123
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:27,899
A local, please.

1124
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,035
All right.

1125
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,876
Trudy, you see that
over there?

1126
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:33,943
Get it.

1127
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,575
What?
The mirror.

1128
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,247
The mirror?
Yes, the mirror.

1129
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,417
Yes.
Here?

1130
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:46,755
Yes.

1131
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,096
Do you know how to
locate the appendix?

1132
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,498
Yes, I do.

1133
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,031
What kind of incision
are you planning?

1134
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,128
A McBurney.

1135
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:58,106
No, no.
Make a lateral.

1136
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,508
Give you more exposure.

1137
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,469
<i>And the sutures,
you're using catgut?</i>

1138
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:04,604
Silk.

1139
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,042
<i>Oh, no,
I don't hold with silk.</i>

1140
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,350
Use catgut.

1141
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,819
Doctor, maybe you
better do it yourself.

1142
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,285
And how can
I do it meself?

1143
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:19,590
<i>If you can't, then let me.
Your instructions clear?</i>

1144
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,027
I... I think so.

1145
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,622
Well, Doctor,
remember, no movement.

1146
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,263
Trudy,
move your head a little.

1147
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,035
<i>I can't see
into the mirror.</i>

1148
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,749
<i>Maybe it's as well
we didn't wait.</i>

1149
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,300
<i>Is it over?
It's over.</i>

1150
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,772
Is he all right?

1151
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,345
<i>He's asleep.</i>

1152
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,938
Oh, thank heavens.

1153
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,213
You did a fine job,
Miss Mason.

1154
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,650
Thank you.

1155
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,956
Doctor! Doctor!

1156
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,266
Mrs. Gilley!

1157
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:48,282
Hello, Doctor.
Good morning.

1158
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,579
Hi, Doc.
Howdy, Dr. Pearson.

1159
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:50,676
Hello, boys.

1160
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,811
<i>How's the old doc?</i>

1161
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,446
Oh, he looks better
than I do.

1162
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,354
Say, I hear
you saved his life.

1163
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,517
He sure did.

1164
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,118
<i>I had to.
He owed me
a week's salary.</i>

1165
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:03,263
<i>He's a joker.</i>

1166
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,994
Did a good job, eh?

1167
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:06,896
Oh, Dr. Pearson!

1168
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,062
Hello, Miss Lennek.

1169
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:11,334
<i>Going on the sleigh
ride this evening?
It's our annual.</i>

1170
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,704
Oh, I wish I could.

1171
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,766
Dr. Pearson!
Nurse Mason.

1172
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,971
Hello, Chesley.
Hello. What will it be?

1173
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,207
<i>I'd like
a couple of dozen
phenobarbital tablets.</i>

1174
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,614
<i>Half gram.
Jed Conway's account.</i>

1175
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,478
<i>Well...
That's a hypertension case.</i>

1176
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,611
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

1177
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,552
We have some
potassium thiocyanate.

1178
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,989
<i>I believe it's
considered more modern.</i>

1179
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:32,118
Would you
be terribly offended if
I insisted upon phenobarbital?

1180
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,654
No, just as you say.

1181
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:34,958
Thanks.

1182
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:38,060
<i>Say, Nurse,
I'm taking out
some tonsils tomorrow.</i>

1183
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,762
Would you like to join me?
Are you doing it with mirrors?

1184
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:43,067
<i>That was quite
the experience, wasn't it?</i>

1185
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,230
I had one disappointment.

1186
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,365
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1187
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,433
I had the impression
you always sang
during surgery.

1188
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,036
Well, it was
sort of unexpected.

1189
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,108
Forgot my music.

1190
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:56,379
<i>But, you know,
I don't think you realize
just how wonderful you were.</i>

1191
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:59,444
<i>I've had
experienced nurses who
weren't nearly so helpful.</i>

1192
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,180
Well, you were a help, Doctor.
Really?

1193
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:05,053
<i>I don't think I could
have saved Dr. McRory alone.</i>

1194
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,823
Oh, you...

1195
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,394
Of course,
Dr. Pearson knows

1196
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:12,161
that an appendectomy is
probably the simplest
of all operations.

1197
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,862
<i>Roy!
No, he's right.</i>

1198
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,496
<i>Oh, I don't
mean to belittle
Dr. Pearson, Trudy.</i>

1199
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,130
But you do know that
appendix operations

1200
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,437
are often performed
even by pharmacists.

1201
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,671
Still?
Well, on shipboard.

1202
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,410
In the movies, too.
Well, thank you.

1203
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:26,539
Oh, Doctor...
Yeah.

1204
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,141
<i>I don't suppose you'd care
to go along on the
sleigh ride.</i>

1205
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:31,482
I imagine
Dr. Pearson
is too busy.

1206
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:33,647
<i>Well, I am, yes. But
you'll have a lot of
fun, I know.</i>

1207
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,982
Bye, Nurse.
Goodbye, Doctor.

1208
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,252
Hello.

1209
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,161
Hello, Emily.

1210
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,494
Oh, hello, Doctor.

1211
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,961
<i>Ronnie!
It's Ronnie Jenks.</i>

1212
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,461
<i>Why, certainly
I'll pick you up.</i>

1213
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,838
In person.
You wait for me at
the Elktown station.

1214
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,638
The new doctor?

1215
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,705
<i>Yes, he's
Butch Jenks' brother.</i>

1216
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,474
<i>I've told you
about Butch Jenks.</i>

1217
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,106
Well, this kid
is just like him.

1218
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,548
<i>Well, if you're
going to Elktown,</i>

1219
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,016
<i>won't we miss
the sleigh ride?</i>

1220
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,678
No, you go right ahead.

1221
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:05,948
<i>I'll meet the
sleigh in Bentonville.</i>

1222
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,080
At the church supper.

1223
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,114
<i>And we'll have the
ride back together.</i>

1224
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,593
<i>How's your father?
Fine.</i>

1225
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,958
<i>He's only had one attack
and he's still drinking tea.</i>

1226
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,760
<i>Good.
I'll examine him
again before I leave.</i>

1227
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,357
But, Doctor...
Yeah.

1228
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:21,330
Is it unethical for
a doctor to take
a girl with him

1229
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,494
on his calls?

1230
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,764
<i>No. I wouldn't think so.</i>

1231
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,100
Come along.

1232
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:28,837
<i>Thank you.
I'd love to.</i>

1233
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:34,145
<i>Of course I don't
blame you for going away.</i>

1234
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,249
You are, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

1235
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,851
As soon as
Dr. Jenks gets here.

1236
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:45,419
I guess
for people like us,
Fallbridge is awful slow.

1237
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,259
Awfully.

1238
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,661
Doctor.
Yeah.

1239
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:54,765
If I asked you
a very frank question,

1240
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:57,101
well, would you give me
a frank answer?

1241
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,800
<i>I'll try, Emily.</i>

1242
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,334
Well, did you
really mean it

1243
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,139
when you said that
you thought I was pretty?

1244
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,679
Indeed I did.

1245
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:07,641
Thank you.

1246
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,514
<i>You're quite welcome.</i>

1247
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:12,486
And, Doctor.
Mmm?

1248
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:18,259
<i>Has it ever occurred to you
that in five years, I'll be
practically 18?</i>

1249
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:19,893
<i>No, no, it hadn't,</i>

1250
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:24,558
but five years and
practically 13 is
practically 18.

1251
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,295
<i>That's simple arithmetic.</i>

1252
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,664
And besides, in
some parts of the world,

1253
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:31,104
not that I approve
of it, of course,

1254
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:34,109
<i>but girls often get
married when they're 10.</i>

1255
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,075
Emily Walters.

1256
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,943
<i>You're an old maid.</i>

1257
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:50,150
Well?

1258
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:52,594
Looks like it froze up.

1259
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,129
Must be out of alcohol.

1260
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,494
Do you have any?

1261
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,658
Well, I got to
thaw it out first.

1262
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,429
<i>I'll have it
over at Doc's house
first thing in the morning.</i>

1263
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,731
Well, how are we
going to get home?

1264
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:05,566
<i>Well, if
Molly wasn't sick,
she could drive you in.</i>

1265
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,768
<i>Well, Mr. Pinkett,
your wife's going
to be all right.</i>

1266
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,404
<i>But you've been
letting her work
a little too hard.</i>

1267
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,379
<i>Here's my prescription.</i>

1268
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,041
One hired girl.

1269
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:18,314
<i>Mmm-hmm,
that's what she needs.
A couple of days rest in bed.</i>

1270
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,615
<i>That'll be $2.</i>

1271
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,884
<i>Doc McRory would rather have
Mrs. Pinkett's pickles
than cash.</i>

1272
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,191
<i>Well, there's
this to be considered.</i>

1273
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:33,496
A man with some
pickles laid by

1274
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,833
<i>ain't likely
to lose them on
the horses, is he?</i>

1275
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,234
<i>You'll enjoy them, Doc.</i>

1276
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,344
Look, Doctor!

1277
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,205
Hello!

1278
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,250
Howdy, Nat.
How about giving us a lift?

1279
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:49,306
Howdy, Doc!
Sure.

1280
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,852
<i>If you're heading
for Bentonville.</i>

1281
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,945
<i>Sleigh ride's a dollar.
Church supper is extra.</i>

1282
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:54,614
<i>Come on along.
Yes, why don't you?</i>

1283
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,782
<i>If you haven't
any calls to make.</i>

1284
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,086
Come on, Doc!
Sure, come on!

1285
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:59,150
Well, calls are all finished.
What do you say, Emily?

1286
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,422
<i>Gee, yes!
You've got a date.</i>

1287
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,054
Get aboard.
Come on then.

1288
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,564
Say, Mr. Pinkett,

1289
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,156
would you call
Mrs. Gilley and tell her

1290
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,168
that I can be
reached through the
Bentonville operator?

1291
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,329
<i>And tell
Bill Walters
that Emily's with me.</i>

1292
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,963
Say, Doc.
Huh?

1293
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,999
<i>Fixing cars is
a business with me.
That'll cost you $2.</i>

1294
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,339
Certainly.

1295
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,079
Are you done?

1296
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,346
Hey, Trudy,
have an apple.

1297
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,724
Keep the doctor away.

1298
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,350
Save the apple for Roy.

1299
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,789
Nice going, fellas.

1300
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,388
They are very rude,
but she is engaged.

1301
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:37,591
I know.

1302
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,434
Where is Roy?

1303
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,603
<i>He's meeting the new
doctor, Ronnie Jenks.</i>

1304
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:42,660
Oh.

1305
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,429
<i>Sorry you're leaving.</i>

1306
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,705
Me, too.

1307
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,239
<i>I imagine a girl
who isn't engaged</i>

1308
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:53,339
is even sorrier
when someone
is leaving.

1309
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,317
<i>Don't you think so,
Miss Mason?</i>

1310
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,909
Yes, I do.

1311
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,955
Are you warm enough, Emily?

1312
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,751
Uh-huh, except
for a little draft.

1313
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,724
<i>Oh, well,
let's fix it.</i>

1314
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,488
There we are. There.
Thank you.

1315
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:06,653
Better?
Uh-huh.

1316
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,924
Are you all right?
Oh, fine, thank you.

1317
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,096
How is Roy, Miss Mason?

1318
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,232
<i>He's fine.</i>

1319
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,742
Say, all this kidding
and everything,

1320
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,745
<i>Roy isn't
apt to take it
seriously, is he?</i>

1321
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,804
Roy? Oh, no.
Hmm-mmm.

1322
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,206
<i>You don't really
know Roy, Doctor.</i>

1323
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,275
<i>He's very understanding.</i>

1324
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:32,548
He knows that
you and I are...

1325
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,081
Yes, we are.

1326
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,826
Here we are.

1327
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,430
<i>Mind you, Ronnie,
he's not young.</i>

1328
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,768
<i>And I won't say
his methods are
very modern.</i>

1329
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,167
<i>It's precisely why
I'm here.</i>

1330
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:51,070
<i>The more old-fashioned he is,
the sooner I'll get to be
number one boy.</i>

1331
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,832
Oh, Mr. Chesley,
come in.

1332
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:55,240
Thank you.

1333
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,236
How are you feeling,
Mrs. Gilley?

1334
01:06:58,314 --> 01:06:59,941
Oh, well enough,
I guess.

1335
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,779
This is
a quaint
old place.

1336
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,785
Mrs. Gilley,
will you please
tell Dr. McRory

1337
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,946
that Dr. Jenks is here?

1338
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,646
Dr. Jenks?
Yes.

1339
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,656
This way.

1340
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:18,493
Doctor!

1341
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:20,902
<i>Will the
masked rider get there
in time</i>

1342
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,938
<i>to save Annie from
Black Horse Baskin?</i>

1343
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,939
<i>Listen in tomorrow,
same time, same station...</i>

1344
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,305
<i>... when crispy,
crackly, creamy
crusties presents another...</i>

1345
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,867
Doctor...

1346
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:31,336
Hello.

1347
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,438
Hello, Dr. McRory.

1348
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:33,573
Glad to see you, Roy.

1349
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,844
This is my very
good friend,
Dr. Jenks.

1350
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,253
Jenks?
How are you, Doctor?

1351
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,878
<i>I'm satisfactory,
thank you.</i>

1352
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:41,183
Everything is set.

1353
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:43,748
Jenks is moving
into that little cottage
Dad owns across the street.

1354
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,726
<i>And he's ready to take over.</i>

1355
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,057
Take over?
Take over what?

1356
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,130
Well, your practice, Doctor,
as I understand it,
until you...

1357
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,827
<i>Young man, I hope you
haven't traveled
very far</i>

1358
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,802
because I have
no opening for you.

1359
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:55,962
Huh?

1360
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,164
But, Dr. McRory,
you asked him
to come here.

1361
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,039
Oh, no, Roy,
you asked him.

1362
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,472
<i>I'm very sorry,
but I have the most
excellent man with me now.</i>

1363
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:08,039
And I see no reason
for a change. Thank you.

1364
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,380
Now, wait a minute,
Doctor.

1365
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,479
You made it quite clear that
you consider Pearson just
as I do.

1366
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:16,684
An incompetent, arrogant,
vaudeville singer,
not a doctor.

1367
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:20,723
<i>Now, you needn't
distort the facts, Roy.</i>

1368
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,960
<i>Dr. Pearson's
a man of great ability.</i>

1369
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:25,830
Which I...
Yes, I was the
very first to recognize.

1370
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,101
<i>And he's a fine surgeon.</i>

1371
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,335
And as for objection
to a doctor singing,

1372
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:34,535
well, now, what sort of
narrow-minded nonsense
is that?

1373
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,104
<i>I'm surprised at you, Roy.</i>

1374
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,347
<i>Well, I guess there's
nothing more to say.</i>

1375
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,111
<i>Yes, there's
one thing more.</i>

1376
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,744
<i>I'll thank you
not to use me to get
your friends employment.</i>

1377
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,488
<i>And now,
if you don't mind,
I'll be taking me rest.</i>

1378
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,320
<i>I don't want
to be disturbed.</i>

1379
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,253
Yes, you should.

1380
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:56,955
<i>I won't forget this, Doctor.</i>

1381
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,097
<i>See that you don't.
Goodbye.</i>

1382
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,907
Is Dr. Pearson
really staying on?

1383
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,704
<i>Why wouldn't
he be staying on?</i>

1384
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,935
The position of
assistant director
and chief surgeon

1385
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,877
in the most
modern hospital
in all of Maine...

1386
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,507
Did he... Did he
say he was staying?

1387
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,108
<i>Mrs. Gilley,
I'm not a well man.</i>

1388
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,546
All this chitter, chitter,
chatter is most disturbing.

1389
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,619
Turn on me radio, please.

1390
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:56,555
<i>It's funny, Roy's
not showing up, hmm?</i>

1391
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,254
Yes.

1392
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,795
Lovely night.

1393
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,964
Beautiful.

1394
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:18,504
<i>As long as I'm dreaming</i>

1395
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:23,180
<i>How nice it can be</i>

1396
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:28,881
<i>How nice to have you</i>

1397
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:33,020
<i>In love with me</i>

1398
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:40,960
<i>Did you know
that you just kissed me?</i>

1399
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:45,736
<i>What a thrill I got</i>

1400
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,871
<i>As long as I'm dreaming</i>

1401
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:54,346
<i>My love</i>

1402
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:02,153
<i>If I were just wishing</i>

1403
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,492
<i>What good would it do</i>

1404
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,264
<i>What chance would I have</i>

1405
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:15,064
<i>To wish for you</i>

1406
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:24,576
<i>If you never know
I love you</i>

1407
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:29,478
<i>Still it works out fine</i>

1408
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,883
<i>As long as I'm dreaming</i>

1409
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:38,118
<i>You're mine</i>

1410
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:46,725
<i>As long as I'm dreaming</i>

1411
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:51,095
<i>You're mine</i>

1412
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,412
The doctor is as good
as Frank Sinatra.

1413
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,351
Yes, and I can take
your blood pressure
at the same time.

1414
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:13,591
Oh! Oh, well.

1415
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,230
<i>Don't worry about
Emily, Doctor.
I'll get her home.</i>

1416
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,324
Thank you,
Miss Lennek.

1417
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:20,425
Good night, everybody.

1418
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,662
Good night.

1419
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:22,726
Good night, Miss Mason.
Good night, Doctor.

1420
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:24,636
Trudy, Trudy.

1421
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:25,696
Yes?

1422
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:26,763
Roy Chesley has been
telephoning.

1423
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,332
He wants you to
call him right away.

1424
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:30,236
<i>All right,
I'll take it from here.</i>

1425
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,668
Good night, Nat.

1426
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,742
Hello, Doctor.

1427
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:36,182
Back in bed again, huh?
Did you get a little tired?

1428
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:37,883
<i>Ah, no, I'm all right.</i>

1429
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,414
Well, I hear you were on
the sleigh ride.

1430
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,684
Yeah.
Had a good time?

1431
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,055
Oh, wonderful.

1432
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,585
Trudy was there?

1433
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:47,856
Yeah.

1434
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,454
Without Roy?
Mmm-hmm.

1435
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,066
Well, what do you
think of that?

1436
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,168
<i>Ah, there's
a fine girl, Trudy.</i>

1437
01:12:56,305 --> 01:13:00,867
<i>Great pity she's throwing
herself away on that rag,
Roy Chesley.</i>

1438
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,041
<i>Don't you think?</i>

1439
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:06,543
<i>He's
a pretty stuffy fellow.</i>

1440
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:08,105
Pulse is good.

1441
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:10,915
Yeah, Trudy, Trudy...

1442
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,454
She tells me that
Dr. Jenks has arrived, huh?

1443
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,422
Oh, that blatherskite.

1444
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:20,092
Most incompetent young man.
And so rude. He went away.

1445
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:21,351
Huh?

1446
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:24,397
<i>Wait a minute, here.
I'm leaving, you know,
as soon as you're well.</i>

1447
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:27,969
Oh, I have another
doctor coming.
Yes, yes.

1448
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,060
Who?

1449
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:30,264
A Dr. Gilrooney.

1450
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:31,829
<i>What's his first name?</i>

1451
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,135
<i>What's that?
First name?</i>

1452
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,472
Oh, Peter.
A very nice young man.

1453
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:36,568
But far from
your acumen, boy.

1454
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:37,873
Well, naturally.

1455
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,176
Yes, of course.
If you change
your mind...

1456
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,351
<i>No. Anyway you'll be up
and around in a week or so.</i>

1457
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,312
<i>You'll be back on the job
all by yourself.</i>

1458
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,921
All by myself.

1459
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,019
How those words
describe me whole life.

1460
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:58,126
<i>I'd like you to see
something, Doctor.</i>

1461
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,071
<i>Lovely young lady,
isn't she?</i>

1462
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:07,540
<i>Oh, she's lovely, yeah.</i>

1463
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:11,575
I was very fond of her,
very fond.

1464
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:13,708
And she of me.

1465
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,107
What happened?

1466
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:20,020
Oh, you know,
just a young doctor
just starting,

1467
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:23,080
not too bright. Yeah.

1468
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,556
While I was
making up me mind,

1469
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:28,618
she married.

1470
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:31,860
<i>And now,
I'm a lonely old man.</i>

1471
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:35,862
<i>Don't make the
mistake I made, me son,
or you'll be lonely, too.</i>

1472
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,601
Trudy has a very
high opinion of you.

1473
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:42,810
<i>Doctor, I'm leaving
at the end of the week.</i>

1474
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:46,446
<i>Oh, don't think
for a moment that
I intended to say that...</i>

1475
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,043
Close, please.
I was...

1476
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:49,583
Close. Please.

1477
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:55,219
Oh, listen to me.
We waited for you there.

1478
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:57,754
I know. I know. I saw
you waiting, both of you.

1479
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:59,293
I drive all the way
to Bentonville and...

1480
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,625
<i>Oh, I'm sorry you're upset.
Honestly, I am.</i>

1481
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,922
Well, where can
I see you later?

1482
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,499
Oh, at my place
in half an hour.

1483
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,265
At the boarding house
in half an hour.

1484
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:12,799
Goodbye.

1485
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:17,970
Right on the line.

1486
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,108
Could have told you that
before you took it.

1487
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,547
Hello, Doctor.

1488
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:22,973
<i>How's our patient?</i>

1489
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,310
<i>Oh, he's himself again.</i>

1490
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,081
Health, fine.
Disposition, terrible.

1491
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:27,984
Dr. Pearson, telephone.
Yeah?

1492
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,618
Excuse me.

1493
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:31,949
Anybody I know?
I doubt it.

1494
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,156
Trudy, sit down.

1495
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,355
Yes, Doctor?

1496
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:42,596
<i>Oh, it'll be a sad day for
Fallbridge when that
young man leaves.</i>

1497
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:45,602
<i>Great ability.
It's too bad that...</i>

1498
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:47,601
<i>What's too bad?</i>

1499
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:51,775
<i>Oh, no. It's not for me
to violate a confidence.</i>

1500
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:54,747
Still...

1501
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:57,250
No, no, no.

1502
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:00,685
<i>You know you're going
to tell me, Doctor, so...</i>

1503
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,555
All right. Then,
perhaps I should.

1504
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,825
Dr. Pearson
is most unhappy.

1505
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:09,286
What about?

1506
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,431
About your
engagement to Roy.

1507
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,195
Did he say so?

1508
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:16,793
More.

1509
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,842
<i>He says you're engaged
to a stuffy young man.</i>

1510
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,065
Oh?

1511
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:25,340
<i>And that's why
he's going away.</i>

1512
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,045
<i>He's not happy, Trudy.</i>

1513
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,218
<i>He doesn't show it,
you know, but...</i>

1514
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:34,015
Well, population
of East Fallbridge
is about to increase.

1515
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,283
Mrs. Chanock.

1516
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:38,053
Edie Chanock? Oh, a fine,
healthy girl. Her first.

1517
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:39,115
Say, how do I get there?

1518
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,558
Oh, if you go...

1519
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:44,895
<i>Oh, well, no, you'd
never find your
way there.</i>

1520
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:46,594
Not on these
roads at night.

1521
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:50,198
<i>Oh, I'd better
drive you there myself.</i>

1522
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,233
<i>If you'd just
hand me my gown...</i>

1523
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,569
<i>No, you can't do that.</i>

1524
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,437
<i>I know
the house, Doctor.
I'll take you there.</i>

1525
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,269
<i>Now, isn't that
very generous of her?</i>

1526
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:59,905
<i>It's very sweet of you.
Come on.</i>

1527
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:04,683
I brought your hot milk.

1528
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,616
<i>A lovely pair
they'd make, huh?</i>

1529
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,751
<i>What on earth
are you doing with
my cousin Hattie's picture?</i>

1530
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:14,517
And my album?

1531
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:19,523
<i>Oh, well, they...
When they...
You see, it's...</i>

1532
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,937
Old pictures, old wine.

1533
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,496
Old buttinsky.

1534
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,781
<i>Well, another
couple of weeks,
I'll be on a boat.</i>

1535
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:41,678
Going where?

1536
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:43,816
<i>There's only
one place to go
this time of the year.</i>

1537
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:44,881
Go south.

1538
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,720
<i>Doesn't having a home
mean anything to you?</i>

1539
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,524
<i>Well, you bet it does.
That's why I have so many.</i>

1540
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,435
What did I do?
Say something funny?

1541
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:59,106
No, not you. Dr. McRory.

1542
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,673
He said you were
going away heartbroken.

1543
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,111
Heartbroken? Over what?

1544
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:07,371
<i>Me. He'd do anything
to have you stay.</i>

1545
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,039
Oh.

1546
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,818
He told me you were
a pretty fine fellow.

1547
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:13,377
Cupid McRory, yeah?

1548
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:17,515
<i>Well, he couldn't have
set a more attractive trap.</i>

1549
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:18,616
Thank you.

1550
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:23,929
<i>Come in, Doctor.
We've been waiting for you.</i>

1551
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,695
Give me a lift
with this bag, man.

1552
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:29,327
<i>Oh, sure.
I'll run along in.</i>

1553
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:31,929
All right.
Everything all right?

1554
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,338
<i>Oh. Where's the doctor?</i>

1555
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:35,868
<i>He'll be in
in a minute.</i>

1556
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:37,275
Well, tell him to come
right in the bedroom.

1557
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,272
<i>And sit down, won't you?</i>

1558
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:45,017
<i>In there.
Her ma's with her.</i>

1559
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:48,686
Here. Let me have that.

1560
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,428
Is he any good?

1561
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,693
Dr. Pearson? Very good.

1562
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,228
Gee, I hope so.

1563
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,237
<i>Dr. McRory
couldn't come, huh?</i>

1564
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:04,533
No, but you...

1565
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,005
Trudy, this is gonna
take a little time.

1566
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,632
You better run along.
I can get home all right.

1567
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:08,733
<i>Oh, I'll wait.</i>

1568
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,141
<i>Is she all right, Doc?
She's fine.</i>

1569
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:11,372
Anything I can do?

1570
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:12,736
No.

1571
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,478
Well, yes. Do you
have a checkerboard?

1572
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:16,778
Checkerboard?

1573
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:17,978
Makes the time go faster.

1574
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,077
Doctor.
Yes?

1575
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:20,212
You better come in now.

1576
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,277
<i>I'll be right with you.</i>

1577
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,587
You take care
of the father,
huh, Trudy?

1578
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:24,886
I will.

1579
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,229
<i>Gosh!
It's my first one.</i>

1580
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,273
<i>There's my grandson.</i>

1581
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:44,241
A boy? My son.

1582
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,774
Ed, she wants to see you.

1583
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,651
<i>He's so little.</i>

1584
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,825
And so...

1585
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:18,273
Well, here we are.

1586
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:21,377
I was asleep.

1587
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:22,574
<i>Not much of
a night's rest</i>

1588
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,017
for a gal who
has to be at school
at 9:00 in the morning.

1589
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:26,979
<i>You're frostbitten?</i>

1590
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:28,821
Just cold.
Let me see.

1591
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:33,987
Well?

1592
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:35,388
Roy?

1593
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,260
You were gonna
meet me in a half hour.

1594
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:38,692
Some half hour.

1595
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,433
<i>Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Roy.
I meant to phone you.</i>

1596
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,661
But a woman in
East Fallbridge
had a baby, and...

1597
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:45,171
Of course,
you had to be there.

1598
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,504
<i>Without your help,
women in East Fallbridge
couldn't have babies.</i>

1599
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:48,838
<i>Well, Chesley,
it's really my fault.</i>

1600
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:49,968
<i>I didn't know the roads
and she...</i>

1601
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:51,340
<i>I'd like you to
keep out of this.</i>

1602
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:55,008
<i>I'd like to
keep out of it, too, Roy.
I'm sorry I've upset you.</i>

1603
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,948
<i>I tried to explain
and I'm very tired.</i>

1604
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,316
Good night.
Good night, Doctor.

1605
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:02,045
I think with
all your equipment,
you better take my car.

1606
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:03,385
You can drop it off later.

1607
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:04,755
Thank you, Trudy.

1608
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,350
<i>Oh, so it's Trudy now?</i>

1609
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:09,362
<i>Isn't that my name?</i>

1610
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,763
<i>You seem to forget that
it's also gonna be Chesley.</i>

1611
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,232
Roy, people are sleeping.

1612
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:15,064
<i>Maybe you'd
like to forget
that we're engaged.</i>

1613
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:18,203
When you talk that way,
yes, I would.

1614
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,298
<i>That's what I thought.
Well, it's fine with me!</i>

1615
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,366
<i>I'll give you two minutes
to take that back.</i>

1616
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,377
<i>She didn't mean that.
She'll be right back.</i>

1617
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:31,611
Then you better wait.

1618
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,384
I ought to
punch your nose.

1619
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:34,615
Maybe I better wait.

1620
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:36,452
<i>Yes, there's
a couple of things
I'd like to settle with you.</i>

1621
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:37,684
Certainly.

1622
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,454
<i>Now, don't think
I'm worried.</i>

1623
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:42,792
Miss Mason is far too smart
to throw herself away on
a hobo doctor.

1624
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:45,860
A guy who gets paid
in jellies and
sauerkraut.

1625
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:48,903
Not always. I had a very
big day yesterday.
I got pickles.

1626
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,129
<i>I'm not thinking
of myself.</i>

1627
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:53,674
<i>If I thought
she'd be happy with you</i>

1628
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,642
<i>living in
a freight car,
I'd say, "Fine!"</i>

1629
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:56,869
<i>That's very noble of you.</i>

1630
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:58,310
<i>I can be noble.
What's wrong with that?</i>

1631
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,813
<i>Nothing.
I'm impressed.</i>

1632
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:01,746
<i>I'm thinking of her
own good. Are you?</i>

1633
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:03,113
<i>Well, no.
I don't think I am.</i>

1634
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:04,310
Are your intentions marriage?

1635
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:07,048
<i>Now, that's a notion
I've always tried
to avoid.</i>

1636
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:08,817
Listen to me, Pearson...
Wait a minute.

1637
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,517
Quiet. We seem to have
picked up quite an audience.

1638
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,082
<i>Let's keep it bright, huh?</i>

1639
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,093
Boys, people
are trying to sleep.

1640
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,923
I tried to sleep, too.
In a chair, all night!

1641
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:19,559
<i>Oh, Trudy, I'm sorry.</i>

1642
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:21,291
<i>I know you didn't mean
what you said.</i>

1643
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:23,360
<i>But if you'd just keep away
from this quack.</i>

1644
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,462
Roy!

1645
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:26,837
<i>He isn't interested in
marriage, he just told
me that.</i>

1646
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:31,107
<i>Trudy, I...
I don't like to come
between engaged people.</i>

1647
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,646
<i>He's upset.
It's a natural
misunderstanding.</i>

1648
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,010
Out so late
and everything.

1649
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:39,011
<i>You needn't be
alarmed, Doctor.</i>

1650
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:43,124
<i>Your freedom
isn't in any danger,
whether I'm engaged or not.</i>

1651
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:45,990
<i>And, Roy, I'm not.</i>

1652
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:48,127
Good night, both of you.

1653
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,062
<i>I wasn't of very
much help, was I?</i>

1654
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:58,435
I ought to punch you...

1655
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:01,365
Oh, here, let me see.

1656
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:07,078
<i>There's no fracture,
just put an icepack on it.</i>

1657
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,048
<i>Next time, don't
telegraph your punches.</i>

1658
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:11,176
You can
wind up with
no knuckles at all.

1659
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:16,982
Good morning.

1660
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:18,423
Well, what happened?

1661
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:19,983
Six pound boy.

1662
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:22,085
Boy, boy.

1663
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:24,523
Yeah. Just left
Trudy, huh?

1664
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:26,166
Yes, and Roy.

1665
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:28,567
<i>They've just broken
their engagement.</i>

1666
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:30,629
Have they now?

1667
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,832
Well, I hope you seized
the opportunity, huh?

1668
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:38,846
<i>All right,
Doctor, don't you think
you've done enough meddling?</i>

1669
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:40,707
Meddling?

1670
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,609
A man tries to squeeze
a little brains into that

1671
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:46,882
narrow, pig-headed skull
of yours and you call
it meddling?

1672
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,320
<i>In my opinion, the girl's
too good for you.</i>

1673
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,591
<i>If you'll pardon me,
I'd like to wash my face.</i>

1674
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,553
A girl
with brains, a personality,

1675
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,030
an education
and a good figure...

1676
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:00,833
<i>Oh, you've gotten
rude again.</i>

1677
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:02,494
I was right about you
the first time.

1678
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:03,963
Breakfast, Doctor.

1679
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,131
All right, all right.

1680
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:07,199
Uh...

1681
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,250
Doctor...

1682
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:29,463
<i>Mrs. Gilley, you might
inform Dr. Pearson
that I'm not interested</i>

1683
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,862
in what he has to say.

1684
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:32,697
Well, if I offended you...

1685
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:35,258
<i>Yes, and
that I'd much rather
he didn't speak to me.</i>

1686
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:38,795
Mrs. Gilley, would
you remind Dr. McRory

1687
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:40,738
that he and I
are grown men?

1688
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,470
<i>What's gotten
into you two?</i>

1689
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:44,774
You have your
instructions,
Mrs. Gilley.

1690
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,382
Well, you heard
each other.

1691
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:52,082
Mrs. Gilley, you might
inform Dr. Pearson

1692
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:54,018
<i>that he needn't
bother to remain on here.</i>

1693
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:58,725
<i>Tell him
I'd strongly recommend that
he takes the 4:15 bus today.</i>

1694
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,322
Mrs. Gilley,
would you be good
enough to tell Dr. McRory

1695
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:05,059
that I agreed to remain here
until he was able to resume
his practice?

1696
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,227
<i>And I'll keep my word.</i>

1697
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:12,701
<i>Inform Dr. Pearson that he'll
not get one penny salary
after today.</i>

1698
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,332
<i>I'm busy frying eggs.</i>

1699
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:17,935
You mind passing
the sugar?

1700
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:23,445
Dr. McRory, Dr. Pearson
would like the sugar.

1701
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:32,251
If you get
a little time on your hands,
thank him for me, will you?

1702
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,321
Good morning.
Good morning,
Mrs. Gilley.

1703
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:37,591
Good morning, Al.

1704
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:39,530
I see you got a new
neighbor, Dr. Jenks.

1705
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:40,625
Jenks?

1706
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:41,896
Who? Who did you say?

1707
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,597
Dr. Jenks,
across the street.

1708
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,969
Just moved in
that little Chesley
property last night.

1709
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:50,505
<i>Oh, they're just
visiting, no doubt.</i>

1710
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:53,340
No, staying.
Just ordered a whole
lot of groceries.

1711
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:54,907
Well, see you tomorrow.

1712
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:15,729
<i>The man's an idiot.</i>

1713
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:19,271
<i>Oh, he'll never last, Doctor.
Nobody's gonna take your
place in this town.</i>

1714
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:23,037
Well, other doctors have
come in here and lasted
a month,

1715
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:24,703
at the longest.

1716
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:26,303
<i>This fellow
won't last three weeks.</i>

1717
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:28,382
Three weeks?
Three weeks.

1718
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:31,412
You still mad at me?

1719
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:34,645
No. Whatever
made you think
I was mad at you?

1720
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:37,786
Sit down there.
Finish your breakfast.

1721
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:44,828
<i>Smile right back at the sun</i>

1722
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:46,025
<i>At the sun</i>

1723
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,000
<i>The moment
he catches your eye</i>

1724
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:49,161
<i>Your eye</i>

1725
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:51,171
<i>Oh, waking up
can be fun</i>

1726
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:54,434
<i>Just depend on your
friend in the sky</i>

1727
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:55,567
<i>In the sky</i>

1728
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:58,476
<i>If you start your
daydreams early</i>

1729
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:01,481
<i>You can get
a lot more done</i>

1730
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:02,573
Oh!

1731
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:08,748
<i>So, get up, get out, and
smile right back at the sun</i>

1732
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:11,755
<i>Let's start again with
a little...</i>

1733
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:12,918
With what?

1734
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:14,621
Remember
on the train when you
cut yourself shaving?

1735
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:16,288
Yes, yes.

1736
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:18,756
Yeah. Jim.
Huh?

1737
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,900
<i>I don't think I'll go
to the station with you.</i>

1738
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:22,397
<i>I don't like farewells.</i>

1739
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,967
<i>Well, I won't be leaving
till 4:10, Doctor.</i>

1740
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,609
What I think of it,
my good friends
call me Joe.

1741
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:31,067
Joe?

1742
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,181
<i>I've liked working
with you, Joe.</i>

1743
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:37,378
Well, I wish
I could say that
I found you objectionable.

1744
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:38,577
Yeah?

1745
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:41,281
Yeah, then your
going away would be
a very happy occasion.

1746
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,351
Thank you, Joe.

1747
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,272
<i>I'll pick you up after
I see about my trunk.</i>

1748
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,503
Hello, Doc.
Hello, Harry.

1749
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,571
Gee, Pop, those
are fighting words.

1750
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:08,974
Yeah.

1751
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,608
Hello, Emily.

1752
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,044
Hello, Dr. Pearson.

1753
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:13,586
Hi, Bill.
Hiya, Doc.

1754
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:15,617
<i>Well, let's have
a drink, huh?</i>

1755
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:18,014
What?

1756
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:20,222
You mean you want
me to have a drink?

1757
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,025
Mmm-hmm.
Kept this for
a special occasion.

1758
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:24,622
You were right.

1759
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,826
<i>It wasn't the drinking
that was causing those
headaches, Bill.</i>

1760
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:28,901
Just got this letter
from Dr. Sachs.

1761
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:29,994
<i>Who's he?</i>

1762
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,505
<i>He's my
old professor
at medical school.</i>

1763
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:34,808
<i>He's an authority
on pheochromocytoma.</i>

1764
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:35,965
Pheochromo...

1765
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,569
Of the adrenal gland.
Confirms my diagnosis.

1766
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:41,545
Do you mean
I need a drink

1767
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:42,878
before I find out
what happens to me?

1768
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,282
<i>Oh, no.
It's to celebrate.</i>

1769
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:46,779
Oh, you mean,
he can be cured?

1770
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:48,344
<i>Mmm-hmm.
There's the man
that'll cure him.</i>

1771
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:49,720
<i>He's gonna perform
the operation.</i>

1772
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:51,822
Oh, an operation?
Yeah.

1773
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:54,161
<i>Oh, well,
if it'll cure you, Pop.</i>

1774
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:55,588
<i>Why don't you operate?</i>

1775
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:57,494
<i>Oh, no,
I'm leaving
by the next bus.</i>

1776
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,198
Say, could you meet me
in Boston tomorrow?

1777
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:02,969
<i>I can't get out of
this town quick enough.</i>

1778
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:05,130
<i>Haven't you heard
what's happened
to Dr. McRory?</i>

1779
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:06,264
No, what?

1780
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:08,271
Get a load
of this poison.

1781
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:16,747
And now,
we come to a subject...

1782
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:22,819
<i>What I want to say is
and I'm speaking for
the entire board.</i>

1783
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,825
<i>We'll always appreciate
your great service
to Fallbridge.</i>

1784
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:27,360
Yes. Thank you,
thank you.

1785
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,018
Hello, Jim.

1786
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:30,121
Doctor.

1787
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:32,991
Gentlemen.

1788
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:34,990
We will proceed.

1789
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,704
We know the hospital is
pretty close to your heart.

1790
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:41,736
Well, yes, it is.

1791
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:44,402
<i>Well, it's close
to our hearts, too.</i>

1792
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:48,112
And we sort of feel that

1793
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:50,742
a doctor with
more modern methods,

1794
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:52,786
with newer ideas...

1795
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:53,843
<i>What's that?</i>

1796
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:59,250
Well, to get down
to brass tacks, Doc,
times have changed and...

1797
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:02,228
<i>You mean,
you don't want me
to run the hospital?</i>

1798
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,656
We feel
we need a younger man.

1799
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,626
A man like Dr. Jenks.

1800
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:10,765
<i>If you'll excuse me.</i>

1801
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:12,829
Just a minute, Joe.

1802
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:16,432
That was a very touching
little speech, Mr. Chesley.

1803
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:18,410
Are you a member
of this board, Pearson?

1804
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:21,439
<i>If I was, I'd be
ashamed to admit it.</i>

1805
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,377
<i>There's some pretty
short memories here.</i>

1806
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:28,454
I was present
when this town
paid a tribute,

1807
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:29,512
a fine tribute it was,

1808
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,855
to Dr. McRory and
his 35 years of service.

1809
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:36,096
<i>I didn't
realize then how much
he deserved the tribute,</i>

1810
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:37,153
but I do now.

1811
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:39,395
I just want to add that
in taking care of you people

1812
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,958
and your parents
and your children,

1813
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:46,896
Dr. McRory has learned
more about medicine
than Dr. Jenks or I

1814
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:47,963
will ever
get out of books.

1815
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,902
<i>Listen, Pearson,
you'll have to admit</i>

1816
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:53,310
there are new methods,
new discoveries in medicine.

1817
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:55,972
Oh, yes,
very important
discoveries, too.

1818
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:59,047
But no one
has discovered
a substitute for skill,

1819
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:03,284
or wisdom,
or practical experience,
or for goodness of heart.

1820
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:05,753
<i>It isn't that
we don't think highly of Doc.</i>

1821
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:07,624
<i>And he canceled
all 'em debts, too.</i>

1822
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,253
Now, wait a minute.
Yeah, when
we gave the party...

1823
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,763
Now, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

1824
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:18,328
<i>If Dr. McRory
is the better man,
there's a way to find out.</i>

1825
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,033
A written examination.

1826
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:22,041
Conducted by
the medical society.

1827
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:23,133
That seems fair.

1828
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:26,874
<i>Yeah, I don't see
how the Doc could object
to a written examination.</i>

1829
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:28,306
<i>Oh, you don't, eh?</i>

1830
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,042
<i>I shouldn't have to
remind you two fellows</i>

1831
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:34,610
<i>that Dr. McRory hasn't
written an examination
paper in almost 40 years.</i>

1832
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:37,618
And Mr. Cartwright,

1833
01:31:37,692 --> 01:31:40,752
<i>before McRory
saved your son's life,
did you ask him to sit down</i>

1834
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:43,661
like a school boy and
write an examination paper?

1835
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:46,025
<i>Oh, nobody's knocking
the old Doc.</i>

1836
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:49,226
But we want to do
the progressive thing.

1837
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,064
And I think the examination
is progressive.

1838
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,774
<i>All in favor, say, "Aye."</i>

1839
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:55,831
Aye.

1840
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,000
Aye.

1841
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,438
No.
No.

1842
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:03,946
Six to two.

1843
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,312
<i>It's carried.</i>

1844
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:09,985
<i>Let's go, Jim.</i>

1845
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:17,954
Corresponding
secretary will read
his report.

1846
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:38,714
<i>Joe, that examination,
don't you think...</i>

1847
01:32:38,786 --> 01:32:40,515
<i>No, no, I don't. No.</i>

1848
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:42,950
<i>I wouldn't.</i>

1849
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:47,089
<i>Ah, I've been
here too long.</i>

1850
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:51,427
<i>A man's a fool
to bury himself</i>

1851
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:53,558
in one little corner
of the world.

1852
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:56,502
<i>Yeah, but, Joe,
you wouldn't have
too much trouble</i>

1853
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,129
with that
examination, really.

1854
01:32:59,173 --> 01:33:00,936
<i>Let's pretend
that I wouldn't.</i>

1855
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,976
At my age...

1856
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:06,912
<i>Jim, would you believe it,
I'm past 60?</i>

1857
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:08,175
Really?

1858
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,011
<i>Gee, I never
would've guessed it.</i>

1859
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:11,813
<i>You wouldn't, huh?
No, never.</i>

1860
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:13,513
Well,
what do you think of that?

1861
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:16,046
Joe?

1862
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:21,620
Would you like
me to stay here awhile?
Just sort of hang around, hmm?

1863
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:27,695
<i>No, me boy.
I'll be gone soon meself.</i>

1864
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:32,264
<i>Ah, you've got
the right idea.</i>

1865
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,506
Travel around,
have a good time.

1866
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:38,138
You know,
I might do that meself.

1867
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,547
Get me a job on
one of those boats.

1868
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:42,981
<i>Well, I don't think
that you...</i>

1869
01:33:43,484 --> 01:33:46,681
Yes, I imagine
I could fix it
for you.

1870
01:33:47,088 --> 01:33:49,283
<i>Well, it's about
time for the bus.</i>

1871
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:51,349
<i>Where's your grip?</i>

1872
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:52,824
<i>It's inside here
in the hotel.</i>

1873
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:56,388
<i>You wouldn't like
to wait around,
would you?</i>

1874
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:59,160
<i>See me off?
No. No, I don't think so.</i>

1875
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,431
<i>I think I'll walk home.</i>

1876
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:04,001
<i>It's a fine day.</i>

1877
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:07,131
Well...

1878
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:10,541
<i>Dr. Pearson, it's been
a pleasure knowing you.</i>

1879
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,911
Has been for me, Joe.

1880
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:21,182
Bye.

1881
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:33,489
Well, he...
You see, I do a lot
of business with Chesley.

1882
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:35,831
<i>Yes, I understand.
I'll see you again sometime.</i>

1883
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:42,205
Leaving, Doctor?
Hmm?

1884
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:45,808
Oh, hello, Miss Mason.
Yes, finally.

1885
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:47,639
I called to
say goodbye...

1886
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:49,307
<i>But goodbyes
aren't pleasant.</i>

1887
01:34:49,617 --> 01:34:50,914
<i>No, they're not.</i>

1888
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:53,913
<i>You generally manage
to avoid things that
aren't pleasant.</i>

1889
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:56,680
Yeah, if I can.
Mmm-hmm.

1890
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:01,324
<i>It's wonderful
having a little world all
your own, isn't it, Doctor?</i>

1891
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:04,023
<i>Your friends have problems,
that's their misfortune.</i>

1892
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:07,727
You just get on a little boat
and your whole world is snug
and cozy again.

1893
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:11,138
Say, wait a minute now,
Teacher.

1894
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:16,573
Have you any idea
what that hospital
meant to Dr. McRory?

1895
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:19,912
Have you the vaguest notion
what losing it will do to him?

1896
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:22,579
<i>Aren't you confusing me
with the Chesleys?</i>

1897
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:24,885
<i>I didn't
take that job
from Joe McRory.</i>

1898
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:27,149
<i>And my staying here
wouldn't give it
back to him.</i>

1899
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,122
You could stay
and help him prepare
for the examination.

1900
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:32,782
<i>Oh, he'd never take it.
Not with his pride.</i>

1901
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:34,624
Pride?

1902
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:38,961
That hospital is
the dream of his life
and you talk about pride?

1903
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:42,363
<i>If you urged him to take
the examination, he'd take it.</i>

1904
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,398
<i>If you coached him,
he'd pass.</i>

1905
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:47,802
<i>But no, it's much more
pleasant in Guatemala.</i>

1906
01:35:48,175 --> 01:35:49,699
<i>And here's your bus.</i>

1907
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:52,635
<i>Have fun, Doctor.
It's been nice
knowing you.</i>

1908
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:07,990
<i>What do you mean,
you're gonna
work on a boat?</i>

1909
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:10,355
A man of your age.

1910
01:36:11,532 --> 01:36:13,591
Will you be good enough
to pack, Mrs. Gilley?

1911
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:16,999
<i>Oh, you're
an impossible old fool.</i>

1912
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:20,367
What will I pack?

1913
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:22,097
Everything.

1914
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:26,474
Everything? You mean...

1915
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,582
<i>I wouldn't know
where to begin.</i>

1916
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:36,584
Neither would I.

1917
01:36:40,494 --> 01:36:41,552
Jim?

1918
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:42,618
Did you miss the bus?

1919
01:36:42,696 --> 01:36:44,357
No, took me
back to the house.

1920
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:46,365
Joe, get your coat off.
Me coat?

1921
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:47,764
Hang it up right there. Hmm?

1922
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:49,132
But what happened?

1923
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:50,693
<i>Here's your glasses.</i>

1924
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:52,973
Come on, you and I
are going to work.

1925
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,907
To work?
But... Yeah, but...

1926
01:36:56,677 --> 01:36:59,874
All right.
List the possible
complications of pertussis.

1927
01:37:00,948 --> 01:37:02,108
Go ahead, come on.

1928
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:05,885
<i>Pertussis. Can't you
just say whooping cough?</i>

1929
01:37:07,121 --> 01:37:11,615
Is a man a better doctor
because he knows that
measles is rubeola?

1930
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,686
Or that hordeolum
is a sty in the eye?

1931
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:19,030
<i>Or that tinea sycosis
is the barber's itch?</i>

1932
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:22,827
<i>Ah, I'm not a school boy.</i>

1933
01:37:23,437 --> 01:37:24,734
<i>I'm tired,
I'm going to bed.</i>

1934
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:27,330
<i>Joe, you want that
hospital, don't you?</i>

1935
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:36,514
What conditions
develop in advanced
hypertrophic emphysema?

1936
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:38,142
<i>Don't tell me,
don't tell me.</i>

1937
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:39,208
<i>I won't.</i>

1938
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,322
Polycythemia.

1939
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:46,584
Lowered vital capacity.

1940
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:50,257
Pulmonary vascular
hypertension.

1941
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:53,633
Eberthella typhosa.
Eberthella typhosa.

1942
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:55,293
<i>It's getting
a little late, Joe.
You better get to bed.</i>

1943
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:56,666
What?
You better go to bed.

1944
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:58,170
<i>No, no,
tomorrow's
the examination.</i>

1945
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:01,000
Eberthella typhosa.
Eberthella typhosa.

1946
01:38:01,408 --> 01:38:04,775
Salmonella paratyphi.
Salmonella paratyphi...

1947
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:12,612
Name the tests
of liver function?

1948
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:19,918
How do you treat
thyrotoxicosis?

1949
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:27,767
You can do it, Doc.
Lots of luck to you, Doc.

1950
01:38:27,835 --> 01:38:29,234
<i>Yeah, Jenks
ain't got a prayer.</i>

1951
01:38:29,336 --> 01:38:30,496
<i>Thanks.
I'll do my best.</i>

1952
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:33,335
<i>Our man's in great shape.
He'll win without taking
a long breath.</i>

1953
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:36,002
Say, Mort,
if you get over
to the barber shop,

1954
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:37,566
<i>will you
put this sawbuck
on McRory's nose?</i>

1955
01:38:37,645 --> 01:38:38,634
Okay.

1956
01:38:38,712 --> 01:38:39,736
<i>Oh, you shouldn't
have done that.</i>

1957
01:38:39,813 --> 01:38:41,804
<i>Oh, you'll gallop.
You'll breeze. Come on.</i>

1958
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:47,183
You know, Jim,
once when I was a little boy,

1959
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:50,314
just before an arithmetic
examination,

1960
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:53,485
I started sneezing
and they sent me home.

1961
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:56,486
I wish I was
sneezing now.

1962
01:38:56,897 --> 01:38:58,956
<i>Oh, you're gonna win,
all right. You gotta win.</i>

1963
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:00,125
Get in there.

1964
01:39:06,307 --> 01:39:07,433
Hello, Doctor.

1965
01:39:08,342 --> 01:39:09,366
How do you do?

1966
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:15,238
Mr. Dorkas,

1967
01:39:15,316 --> 01:39:17,944
<i>I understand
there's quite a lot
of gambling going on</i>

1968
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:19,451
over at the
barber shop?

1969
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,851
Some, yeah.

1970
01:39:21,221 --> 01:39:23,052
Would you bet that
dollar for me?

1971
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:25,285
Why, Mrs. Gilley.

1972
01:39:51,018 --> 01:39:52,781
<i>Warm, isn't it?</i>

1973
01:39:57,958 --> 01:39:58,947
All finished, Doctor.

1974
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:01,622
Dr. Jenks.
Yes?

1975
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:04,425
Mr. Chesley wants you
over at the school
house right away.

1976
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:05,658
School house?

1977
01:40:05,733 --> 01:40:07,030
Some kids are sick.

1978
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:08,534
<i>What's that?
What's the matter?</i>

1979
01:40:08,602 --> 01:40:10,297
<i>Don't know, Doc.
I'll be right with you.</i>

1980
01:40:10,371 --> 01:40:11,360
Well, thank you, sir.

1981
01:40:12,373 --> 01:40:13,840
<i>You'd better finish.</i>

1982
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:16,406
You only have
25 minutes to catch
the bus, Dr. Morton.

1983
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:17,466
I know.

1984
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,680
<i>Doctor, hurry up, please.
We've got a terrible
situation.</i>

1985
01:40:23,751 --> 01:40:25,082
<i>Yes, I'm coming.</i>

1986
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:27,577
Open your mouth.

1987
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:29,212
<i>Open up. That's it.</i>

1988
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:31,280
<i>Here's the basin, Trudy.
Where do you want it?
Over there?</i>

1989
01:40:32,526 --> 01:40:33,959
<i>Ah, throat's red.</i>

1990
01:40:34,061 --> 01:40:35,187
Is it anything serious?

1991
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:37,520
<i>Eddie's my nephew.
He's Lucy's boy.</i>

1992
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:40,498
Well, four boys
sick at one time,

1993
01:40:40,567 --> 01:40:42,364
<i>food poisoning's
ruled out.</i>

1994
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:44,165
<i>And I don't like
these dizzy headaches.</i>

1995
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,198
These youngsters been
out of school lately?

1996
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:50,800
<i>George was
absent yesterday,
but he wasn't sick.</i>

1997
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:54,847
He was emotionally upset.
His horse died.

1998
01:40:56,216 --> 01:40:57,478
Horse died?

1999
01:40:58,652 --> 01:41:00,017
What from?

2000
01:41:00,087 --> 01:41:01,076
<i>They didn't know.</i>

2001
01:41:03,857 --> 01:41:06,257
<i>What are those marks
on that boy's arm?</i>

2002
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:08,116
Uh-huh.

2003
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:10,090
Mosquito bites.
Yeah.

2004
01:41:10,164 --> 01:41:12,029
Mosquito?
Yes, looks like it.

2005
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:14,757
<i>What's it?
What's the matter, huh?</i>

2006
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:18,505
Oh, hello,
Miss Mason, Chesley.

2007
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:19,596
These your pupils?

2008
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:21,402
Yes, Doctor.
Maybe you can help.

2009
01:41:21,642 --> 01:41:24,110
<i>That won't be necessary.
It's a fairly obvious case.</i>

2010
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:25,968
Is it? What is it?

2011
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:27,641
<i>It's not a common
disease, Doctor.</i>

2012
01:41:27,714 --> 01:41:29,011
<i>I don't believe
you'd know about it.</i>

2013
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:30,939
I might.

2014
01:41:32,653 --> 01:41:35,247
<i>Well, if I'm not mistaken,
this is equine encephalitis.</i>

2015
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:38,517
Mosquitoes
carry the virus,
chickens harbor it.

2016
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:40,856
The disease is more
common among horses.

2017
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:42,956
<i>Aren't you being
a little hasty, Jenks?</i>

2018
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:45,726
If not wasting time
is being hasty, yes.

2019
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:49,966
Doctor, is it fatal?

2020
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:53,000
There was an epidemic
in Massachusetts in 1938.

2021
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:54,540
More than 50%
of the children died.

2022
01:41:55,342 --> 01:41:58,209
Equine...
What did you call it?

2023
01:41:58,545 --> 01:42:00,809
Oh, call it
virus brain fever.

2024
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:03,709
Brain fever?

2025
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:05,274
Brain fever!
What?

2026
01:42:05,352 --> 01:42:06,341
Brain fever?

2027
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:08,151
Stay here.

2028
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:13,623
Roy, call Bentonville.

2029
01:42:13,727 --> 01:42:15,592
Tell them to get an
ambulance here at once.

2030
01:42:17,064 --> 01:42:20,500
Hello, Operator.
Get me Bentonville,
the hospital. Hurry, please.

2031
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:24,331
I said,
Bentonville,
the hospital.

2032
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:26,269
Such telephone service.

2033
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:29,104
Yes, the Bentonville
Hospital. Hurry, please.

2034
01:42:35,682 --> 01:42:36,671
Psst.

2035
01:42:37,017 --> 01:42:39,850
This is Roy Chesley,
let me speak to
Dr. Wheaton.

2036
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:43,623
Hello, Dr. Wheaton,
we need an ambulance

2037
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:45,715
for the Fallbridge
Public School.

2038
01:42:46,894 --> 01:42:48,418
The Fallbridge
Public School!

2039
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:49,792
<i>Why don't you
listen to me?</i>

2040
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:53,094
At the school.
S-C-H-O-O-L!

2041
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:57,428
Virus brain fever,
four boys have got it.

2042
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:58,596
Hurry, please.

2043
01:42:58,672 --> 01:42:59,798
Line to Bentonville is busy.

2044
01:42:59,873 --> 01:43:02,433
Some kids at school
got brain fever.
Must be an epidemic.

2045
01:43:03,777 --> 01:43:06,439
We were right. Take a look.

2046
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:10,448
<i>It's a virus, all right.</i>

2047
01:43:12,286 --> 01:43:14,151
<i>That's nice work, Joe.</i>

2048
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:16,011
Come on.

2049
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:20,323
Long distance.
Long distance.

2050
01:43:20,394 --> 01:43:22,794
Get me back that Washington
number I was talking to.
I was cut off.

2051
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:24,125
Doctor, if I may
make a suggestion...

2052
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:26,758
<i>Not now, if you don't mind.
We're getting a vaccine
from Washington.</i>

2053
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:27,857
Yeah, but...

2054
01:43:27,935 --> 01:43:30,460
<i>Dr. Jenk's case, Joe.</i>

2055
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:32,066
Customary ethics.

2056
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:34,937
<i>Give me
Congressman Beeker.
He'll know who it is.</i>

2057
01:43:36,243 --> 01:43:38,302
<i>Mr. Chesley,
I can't allow you to...</i>

2058
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:40,141
Please. Please.

2059
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:42,541
Hello. Give me
Congressman Beeker.

2060
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:46,677
Oh, is that you, Congressman?
This is Charlie Chesley,
in Fallbridge.

2061
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:48,577
Charlie, who?

2062
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:51,252
Chesley! C-H-E...

2063
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:54,349
Well, you remembered me
before the election.

2064
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:56,424
Oh, yes, yes.

2065
01:43:57,264 --> 01:43:59,289
Well, what can I
do for you, Chesley?

2066
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:00,923
<i>Yeah, well,
that's better.</i>

2067
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:04,598
<i>Now, listen, Congressman,
my nephew's got equine...</i>

2068
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:05,695
Equine what?

2069
01:44:05,772 --> 01:44:07,296
Encephalitis.

2070
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:09,940
<i>Yeah, my nephew's
in a coma.</i>

2071
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:11,134
He got it from a horse.

2072
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:12,502
Where did the horse get it?

2073
01:44:12,713 --> 01:44:13,702
From chickens.

2074
01:44:14,114 --> 01:44:15,103
Chickens?

2075
01:44:15,482 --> 01:44:17,677
Now, listen, Congressman,
the War Department has
got that vaccine

2076
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:19,981
and I want
some of it flown up
here and I want it quick.

2077
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:23,185
<i>It's for equine encephalitis.</i>

2078
01:44:23,824 --> 01:44:25,553
Do you
plan to vaccinate
everybody in town?

2079
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:28,026
Uh, naturally. Roy.

2080
01:44:28,862 --> 01:44:31,330
Dad, get 2,400 doses.

2081
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:33,093
We need 2,400 doses.

2082
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,594
Twenty four...

2083
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:36,258
What? For one horse?

2084
01:44:36,536 --> 01:44:38,094
<i>This is
not for a horse,
it's for chickens.</i>

2085
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:39,529
What chickens?

2086
01:44:39,606 --> 01:44:40,595
Uh, for my nephew.

2087
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:42,772
<i>Say, look here, Chesley,
I'm a busy man.</i>

2088
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:47,607
Congressman?
Operator? Operator?

2089
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:51,082
<i>All right. It's all right.
You've got nothing to
worry about.</i>

2090
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:52,982
The vaccine will keep
the disease from spreading.

2091
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:56,045
<i>Well, if it isn't being
too unethical, I suggest
you forget the vaccine.</i>

2092
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:58,182
Dr. McRory here
has a simpler cure.

2093
01:44:58,258 --> 01:45:01,625
Yeah. Me own
prescription is

2094
01:45:01,695 --> 01:45:02,992
a hairbrush.

2095
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:04,052
A hairbrush?
What?

2096
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,462
Yeah, a hairbrush.

2097
01:45:05,999 --> 01:45:08,490
Vigorously applied
across the seat
of the pants.

2098
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:10,468
Huh? What are you
talking about?

2099
01:45:10,537 --> 01:45:13,506
<i>Well, it's the best cure
I know for 12-years-olds</i>

2100
01:45:13,573 --> 01:45:15,404
<i>who've been
smoking cigars.</i>

2101
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,765
What?

2102
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:19,408
I feel better already, Doc.

2103
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:21,137
Me, too.
Boys!

2104
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:23,045
<i>You won't tell Pop,
will you?</i>

2105
01:45:37,731 --> 01:45:39,130
Swell job, Doc!

2106
01:45:40,534 --> 01:45:43,128
<i>Oh, Mr. Cartwright,
let's get rid of this.</i>

2107
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:44,428
<i>You'll start
another epidemic.</i>

2108
01:45:46,606 --> 01:45:47,595
Good work, Doc.

2109
01:45:50,944 --> 01:45:53,412
<i>Mr. Chesley,
if you'll only let me
explain, I am certain...</i>

2110
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,415
Get away from me,
you horse doctor, you!

2111
01:45:57,918 --> 01:46:00,250
<i>Everything's all right.
You can go home now.</i>

2112
01:46:00,387 --> 01:46:01,718
Oh, Miss... Teach!

2113
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:02,914
Yes?

2114
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:04,251
<i>I'm surprised at you.</i>

2115
01:46:04,324 --> 01:46:06,451
<i>You shouldn't permit
your kids to smoke cigars.</i>

2116
01:46:07,094 --> 01:46:08,356
<i>Oh, I guess I shouldn't...</i>

2117
01:46:08,428 --> 01:46:10,862
<i>Well, you're just gonna have
to be a little more careful
with our kids.</i>

2118
01:46:11,932 --> 01:46:13,957
<i>Oh, don't be so smart.</i>

2119
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:15,228
No, wait. Come here.

2120
01:46:15,869 --> 01:46:18,736
<i>Listen, Joe,
the hospital,
it's yours.</i>

2121
01:46:18,805 --> 01:46:20,534
<i>But I don't want
the hospital.</i>

2122
01:46:20,607 --> 01:46:21,665
But, Joe...

2123
01:46:21,742 --> 01:46:24,267
<i>For 35 years, I've been
thinking of Fallbridge,</i>

2124
01:46:24,344 --> 01:46:25,470
<i>now I'm thinking
