Hey, Papi, get over here. I got
someone I want you to meet.

20
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:20,673
Roland Legrand.

21
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:23,980
Caught this fuckin' goat singing
like a canary to the police.

22

This is what happens when you cross me.

Get this piece of shit
outta here.

24
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:35,190
So, what do you got
for me?

25
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,491
Piece of cake.
Just like you said.

26
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:41,463
You pocket any
for yourself?

27
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:45,101
Yeah, just a couple
of big ones.

28
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,104
You sure got
some balls on you.

00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:36,152
- Yep.
- At least you did.

cheer you up.

Take it.

45
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,404
It's for you.

46
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:59,472
A couple of the big ones
for us.

47
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,377
You're crazy.

48
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,813
- Where you goin'?
- Castili doesn't want me leaving early.

49
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:08,784
To hell with Castili.

50
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,621
Let's go have some fun.

51
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:16,392
Turn that frown
upside-down.

52
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:21,163
I know you
wanna have some fun.

53
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:41,750
I love you.

54
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:44,153
<i>Say that again.</i>

55
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,455
Slower.

56
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:48,323
I...

57
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:51,426
love...

58
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:55,130
you.

59
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:07,710
I want a house.

60
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,181
In the countryside,
like where you grew up.

61
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:17,219
You make it sound so nice, riding
your little horsey around.

62
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,622
Let's go today.

63
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:23,957
How am I gonna earn
in the country?

64
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,895
There's nothing to steal.

65
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,729
We'll get jobs.

66
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:34,436
I made more last night than most
people in the country make in a year.

67
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,837
Gimme six months.

68
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,476
I'll be making more money
than Castili and all those bums.

69
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,655
Hey.

70
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,239
I don't want to wait
six months.

71
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,747
I'm here for the rent.

72
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,914
All right.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

73
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:29,756
- It's him.
- What the fuck?

74
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:32,392
You're under arrest for
the murder of Roland Legrand.

75
00:07:32,394 --> 00:07:33,859
What are you talkin' about?

76
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:35,931
Well, he was murdered last night.
A witness identified you.

77
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:38,364
The pimp,
Roland Legrand.

78
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:41,633
You know him, right?

79
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:45,304
- You got the wrong guy, pal. I was with her all night.
- Come on. Let's go.

80
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:47,407
- All right. Let me get dressed.
- No, no, no, no.

81
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,577
We got some stripes at the
station for you, pretty boy.

82
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:51,677
This is bullshit.

83
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,412
- I didn't kill anyone.
- You can't do that.

84
00:07:53,414 --> 00:07:55,314
- He was with me!
- Nennete, relax.

85
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:57,417
- They got nothin'.
- Nobody believes a whore.

86
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,451
- Nennete!
- Get back in your room.

87
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:01,520
Honestly,
I'll be back in no time.

88
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,357
- Papi! Papi!
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

89
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,561
Papi!

90
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:10,362
Papi!

91
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,664
Papi!

92
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,700
He didn't kill anyone!

93
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,068
He was with me!

94
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:58,046
Step away from the bars!

95
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,749
I can't believe they gave
you a life sentence.

96
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,523
You need to appeal.

97
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:09,757
Appeal what?

98
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,593
Nennete,
this is a frame-up.

99
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,431
They're all in on it.

100
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,034
I just need to concentrate
on breaking out.

101
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,100
Okay.

102
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:25,537
First thing I'm gonna do when I get
back is kill that lying rat witness

103
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,873
and anyone who has anything
to do with this.

104
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,678
- Calm down.
- All visitors have to leave!

105
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,881
Nennete, you need
to forget about me.

106
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:37,919
Don't say that.

107
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:40,452
I love you.

108
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,821
- Time's up, lady.
- Papi, I love you.

109
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:46,426
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

110
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:49,061
- Come on. Come on. Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

111
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:01,110
Papillon, right?
They fucked you good, huh?

112
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:03,812
Framed you
for murder.

113
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:07,213
Say you're one hell
of a safecracker.

114
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,451
I'm more of a smash-and-grab
guy myself. Name's Julot.

115
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:12,688
Got any money?

116
00:10:13,587 --> 00:10:15,854
No?

117
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:18,760
Get some. You'll never
escape without it.

118
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,564
Keep goin', keep goin'.
Let's keep goin'.

119
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:27,133
- Next. Move forward.
- Next, come on!

120
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:29,404
- Let's go, let's go.
- Next.

121
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:32,573
- Line up.
- Go to the end.

122
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,976
Come on. Move along.

123
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,080
- Stay in line.
- Hey.

124
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:44,984
- Perhaps I could speak with your supervisor.
- Sure.

125
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:46,587
Whatever you say.

126
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,557
Louis Dega.
Guy's a millionaire.

127
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,261
Busted making counterfeit
defense bonds.

128
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,763
- Won't last long.
- Next.

129
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:00,899
Every con in the prison will wanna cut
him open to get the money he's carrying.

130
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:02,737
Next.

131
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:10,676
<i>As of this moment,</i>

132
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:15,248
<i>you are the property of the Penal
Administration of French Guiana.</i>

133
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,950
<i>After serving
your full term in prison,</i>

134
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:20,952
<i>you will remain in South America</i>

135
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:26,060
<i>as workers and colonists for a period
equal to that of your original sentence.</i>

136
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:32,800
<i>This is for the greater good
that is French expansion.</i>

137
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,503
<i>As for France...</i>

138
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:39,772
<i>she has disowned you.</i>

139
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:44,913
<i>She has rid herself
of you... altogether.</i>

140
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:48,650
Forget France.

141
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:51,953
Now dress yourselves.

142
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:06,865
Are we going to hell?

143
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,803
Look up. Just keep walking.

144
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:19,515
Mr. Dega.

145
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:23,950
Your appeal is
in a few weeks.

146
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,687
Be strong, Louis.
I love you.

147
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,990
I love you.

148
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:30,922
You'll be home
before Christmas.

149
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:35,229
Dega. Mr. Dega, here.
Look this way. Mr. Dega.

150
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,177
Sixty-nine, 70.

151
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,346
- That's right.
- Move it!

152
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:55,748
That's enough.

153
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,719
Pick your feet up.

154
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,264
Hey, Julot!

155
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,300
All right, pair up.

156
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:15,904
- Hey.
- Take the corner.

157
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:23,311
Looks like Dega's
making friends already.

158
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:28,015
Julot, make sure
no one takes this hammock.

159
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,786
Hey.

160
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:37,023
I saved you a spot next to me.

161
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,760
You got a lot of eyes on you.

162
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,360
I can keep you safe.

163
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:44,866
All I need's enough money
for an escape.

164
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,300
Won't be cheap,
but you'll be safe.

165
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:51,037
Said the scorpion to the frog.

166
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,739
We're all scorpions
in here, pal.

167
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:57,442
I think I'd be better off taking my chances
setting up in front of the guards.

168
00:13:57,444 --> 00:13:59,912
Wouldn't you agree?

169
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:02,650
You seem like the kind of man
who can make up his own mind.

170
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:05,886
You're a good judge
of character.

171
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:10,058
Have a good night.

172
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:12,660
Yeah, you too.

173
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:21,300
Hey.

174
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:23,105
Me and you, we should team up
for an escape.

175
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:29,211
If I get caught in some half-assed
escape, I want it to be my mistake.

176
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:35,384
Settle down now!

177
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,792
Shh.

178
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,811
I know you hide your money
in your guts.

179
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:23,357
Upper deck.

180
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:25,392
Move it back.
Back, you.

181
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,326
Back. Back up.

182
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:29,765
Get him outta here.

183
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,298
The animals can clean up
their own mess.

184
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,133
Come on. Get rid of him.

185
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:36,804
Show's over.

186
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:05,834
How'd you sleep last night?

187
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,939
Smells like freedom.

188
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:17,344
What, you've heard of someone
escaping the prison?

189
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,279
Doesn't mean
it can't be done.

190
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:23,282
I have trouble seeing hope
in hopelessness.

191
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,253
That's why I need
a man like you.

192
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:29,221
I've reconsidered your offer.

193
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:32,625
Keep me alive until
I'm set up on the island,

194
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:34,930
I'll underwrite any escape
you care to arrange.

195
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:43,004
All right.

196
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:48,443
And when the time comes,
you're not comin' with me.

197
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:53,378
I have no intention
of escaping.

198
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,048
Unlike you,
I enjoy being alive.

199
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,082
My wife's working
on my appeal.

200
00:17:58,084 --> 00:18:00,454
I'm confident
I'll be home by Christmas.

201
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:05,293
A fellow optimist.

202
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:20,040
Four.

203
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:21,308
Two.

204
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,973
Look what the fuck you did!

205
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:01,982
Get the knife!

206
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,519
Come on!
Get the knife!

207
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,357
Get the knife!

208
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,256
I'll kill you!

209
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:47,594
Steam! Turn on the steam!

210
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:49,396
Fuck you!

211
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,581
Come on,
come on, come on.

212
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,253
Get back!

213
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,755
Strip and line up, you fuckin'
animals, or it's the steam again.

214
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:20,458
Strip down!

215
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,360
Gimme the fuckin' knife.

216
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:24,463
- Move it!
- Come on. Line up back there!

217
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:27,499
Let's go! Strip down!

218
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,234
- Come on, come on.
- On your feet.

219
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:32,337
Line up back there.

220
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:34,773
Strip down.
Strip right up.

221
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,408
Hands. Hands out.

222
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,778
- Everybody, hands out.
- Everyone, let's have your hands out.

223
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,513
Let's see.
What you got?

224
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:42,814
Get him to the infirmary.

225
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,782
Let's get this
piece of meat outta here.

226
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:46,784
- Show me your hands. Let's see.
- Turn 'em over.

227
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:48,352
You.

228
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:50,355
This one's been fighting
for sure.

229
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:52,124
Take him to first class.

230
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,859
Come on. Come on!

231
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:56,561
Time to go.

232
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:58,033
First class, let's go.

233
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:02,036
Try and behave, ladies.

234
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:37,104
You should have finished him.

235
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:40,507
I don't want to kill anyone.

236
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:47,612
I'm gonna get myself sent
to the hospital.

237
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:49,781
Let me know if a guard
looks this way.

238
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:52,285
- Do not stop!
- Get a move on!

239
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:57,222
Shh.

240
00:21:59,293 --> 00:22:01,629
Move it, now! You two!

241
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:06,798
- Move it! Move it!
- Crazy, Julot.

242
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,534
Go that way! You go this way!
You two, come on down.

243
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,503
Form a line.

244
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:14,305
Form a line, I said.
Form a line. Go ahead.

245
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:16,707
You two, you stay here.
Go back in line.

246
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:17,743
Move.

247
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:19,945
Move it! Come on!
That way!

248
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:22,747
Come on! Move it!
Come on.

249
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:25,551
I said move it, goddamn it.
Get up. Get up!

250
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,885
- Come on.
- Move along! Move along!

251
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,820
Eyes straight.
Eyes straight.

252
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:30,722
- Come on. Move it.
- Move it!

253
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,291
- That way.
- Down the ladder!

254
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:33,792
- Over there. Come on.
- Faster!

255
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:35,459
Move it. Move it!

256
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:37,228
- Come on now.
- Come on. Move.

257
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,398
Don't be looking at me
like that.

258
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,965
- Come on. Move.
- You too.

259
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,900
Move along.

260
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,270
Guys, get him up!

261
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:48,676
My fucking leg!

262
00:22:50,878 --> 00:22:53,678
My leg. My leg!

263
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,717
That's enough.
That's enough.

264
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:01,919
Break it up. Break it up.
That's enough.

265
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:03,988
- Move it!
- Move. Back to the line.

266
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,557
Move, move.

267
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,428
<i>Raise your hand
if I call your name.</i>

268
00:23:08,562 --> 00:23:10,231
Augustin.

269
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:15,503
- Barba.
- Come on now. Stay in line.

270
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:17,705
Bellaire.

271
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:20,438
Move along! Over there.

272
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,177
Lofton.

273
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:26,513
Navarrone.

274
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,314
Navarrone.

275
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:31,351
Move out!

276
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,722
Move out!

277
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:55,677
All right, come on.
Move it.

278
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,647
Keep moving!

279
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:05,852
Prisoners, halt!

280
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,289
Open the gates.

281
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,758
March.

282
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,378
I know many of you at this very
moment are thinking about escape.

283
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,046
Feel free to try
whenever you like.

284
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:43,850
We'll be happy to shoot you.

285
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,686
If, however, you should
avoid that mercy,

286
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:52,690
there are two guardians
who are always on duty...

287
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,896
The bush, where the best thing that
can happen to you is starvation.

288
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:59,997
Or you could choose the sea,

289
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,936
where sharks too, I assure
you, are always hungry.

290
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:07,872
If you manage to survive
your first attempt,

291
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:10,841
you'll get two years
in solitary.

292
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:13,011
Second attempt,
five years in solitary,

293
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:15,515
followed by a life sentence
at Devil's Island.

294
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,619
If you commit murder...

295
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,989
you'll be executed.

296
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:25,426
That's all.

297
00:26:42,176 --> 00:26:43,745
Move. Move.

298
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,695
Jesus Christ.

299
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,438
Take the corner.

300
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:22,617
Hey, keep your eyes open
and don't move.

301
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:26,988
Hey.

302
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,125
Who decides what work
we get assigned to?

303
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,863
- Excuse my ill-mannered...
- I thought I told you not to move.

304
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:39,731
He has yet to be tamed.

305
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,801
And you're obviously a very
important, very, very busy man.

306
00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:44,802
I'm just the turnkey.

307
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:49,107
We're looking for someone
to ensure we're assigned

308
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:51,446
the right sort of work
in the morning.

309
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,913
It'll cost you a thousand.

310
00:27:54,915 --> 00:27:56,046
I don't think so.

311
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:58,018
No, now that seems
entirely too high.

312
00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:04,822
Sir, I think we started
off on the wrong foot.

313
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:08,659
I think a thousand
is actually fair.

314
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:10,195
Now, is there a selection
of work you have...

315
00:28:10,197 --> 00:28:13,732
Attendants at
the hospital.

316
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,966
And for a thousand, you can
throw in a pouch of tobacco.

317
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:17,801
- And a notebook.
- A notebook?

318
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:20,071
- I'm an artist.
- You're a forger.

319
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:24,109
And you're a safecracker, a profession
of which I thoroughly disapprove.

320
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:25,843
- At least I'm an honest criminal.
- Hmm.

321
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:28,649
Hey. I'm gonna need that
right now.

322
00:28:29,315 --> 00:28:30,749
I mean, right now.

323
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,119
Excuse me.

324
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:38,793
I think you need to go
to the bathroom.

325
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,698
Yes, of course.

326
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,534
If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen.

327
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:53,271
Where you goin'?

328
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,076
I've never
been here before.

329
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:59,146
Toilet's there,
princess.

330
00:29:07,353 --> 00:29:12,159
What animal but a man keeps his
only means of survival up his ass?

331
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,169
Something bit me.

332
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:12,082
We got a runner!

333
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:15,086
- Lockdown!
- Lock it down!

334
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:17,222
- Which barracks?
- No, he broke out the hospital.

335
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:18,423
- Just one.
- The hospital?

336
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:19,858
Lock down
your barrack.

337
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,061
- I'll bet that's Julot.
- Lock it down!

338
00:30:23,063 --> 00:30:24,931
Son of a bitch
didn't waste any time.

339
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,169
You see?

340
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:33,972
It can be done.

341
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:37,044
Lock it down! Into the jungle.
Stand down.

342
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:41,314
Route Zero.

343
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:45,986
Route Zero.

344
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,823
Route Zero.

345
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:56,061
My friend and I need to be
kept together at all times.

346
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,730
Set these two up
in the hospital.

347
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,999
And it'll be a few days before I'm
well enough to do any sort of...

348
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:02,837
Don't push it.

349
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:06,673
Both of them,
Route Zero.

350
00:31:09,176 --> 00:31:11,212
Mr. Dega, stop.

351
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,483
I know you.
Do you know me?

352
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:21,351
Yes.
Yes, of course, sir.

353
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:23,253
You're the deputy
warden, sir.

354
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:26,390
My sister's husband
was arrested

355
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:29,829
selling counterfeit defense bonds you
furnished him with in Marseilles.

356
00:31:32,198 --> 00:31:35,466
Dega is a very common name
in Marseilles.

357
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:38,035
- Santini.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:40,738
This one goes straight
to Route Zero.

359
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,142
Take him away.

360
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:44,442
Wait.

361
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,980
Take him too.

362
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:51,983
We try not to separate
old friends here.

363
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:54,688
Get them to Route Zero.
Move.

364
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:57,757
What is Route Zero?

365
00:32:01,995 --> 00:32:03,863
Stand clear!

366
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:10,970
Your other round!

367
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:14,773
I don't feel so good.

368
00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:16,009
Watch it now!

369
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:21,314
It go...
It goes in the cart.

370
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:25,149
Move along.

371
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,451
You do a lot
of talking.

372
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:28,485
- I do?
- Yeah. Stop that.

373
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:31,156
It passes...
It passes the time.

374
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,094
- Get outta my face. Get outta my face.
- You take the bigger rock.

375
00:32:39,232 --> 00:32:42,803
You get into a fight with
him, I'm not protecting you.

376
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,404
If your wife was here...

377
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:21,207
you were in Paris
with all that money,

378
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:24,878
how much would you pay
to get her back?

379
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:28,349
Everything I have.

380
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:34,355
How much would she pay
for you?

381
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:45,900
You're a real optimist.

382
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,178
Little man. Little man.
You need to put some weight in.

383
00:34:32,544 --> 00:34:34,945
You can push harder
than that. Come on.

384
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,481
Trust me, he can't.

385
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:39,483
Trust me,
he has to.

386
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:41,321
Come on! Push it!

387
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,561
- Push it!
- Pick up the pace.

388
00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:53,196
I have... I have diarrhea.

389
00:34:53,198 --> 00:34:55,265
What you want me
to do about it?

390
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,301
No, you don't understand.

391
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,240
I lost the money.

392
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,349
What's the holdup?

393
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:14,385
What the hell are you doing?

394
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:16,720
- What?
- Stop shitting around.

395
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:18,957
- You'll get us all killed.
- You mind your own cart.

396
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:21,358
The little guy is making more
work for the rest of us.

397
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,364
- Mind your own business.
- Break it up. Break it up.

398
00:35:26,398 --> 00:35:29,367
What are you doing?
Get up.

399
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:31,505
Get up! Get up.

400
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:36,341
- On your feet.
- I can't.

401
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,209
Pick him up.

402
00:35:38,211 --> 00:35:40,014
Come on, pick him up.
Put him in the cart.

403
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,318
Back to work.

404
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,222
Move your carts.

405
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:05,370
You had one job to do.
You couldn't do it.

406
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,738
My body's in revolt.

407
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,108
Where is it now?

408
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,378
Where do you think?

409
00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:17,517
I should have known better
than to trust a thief.

410
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:24,222
I can't steal
what's already mine.

411
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,695
As soon as we get back to the
barracks, you're taking it back.

412
00:36:31,697 --> 00:36:33,296
And you're gonna hold onto
it this time.

413
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:36,035
I don't care if you have
to sew your ass up to do it.

414
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,315
I'm sorry.

415
00:36:51,651 --> 00:36:56,557
I may have prematurely judged you
with an unworthy degree of suspicion.

416
00:36:57,724 --> 00:36:59,791
Well, don't propose yet.

417
00:36:59,793 --> 00:37:01,528
I just don't like
carrying things in my ass.

418
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,070
Mmm.

419
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:27,785
He's dead.

420
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,287
- He's dead!
- Shut up, birdie.

421
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,726
Are you stupid or what?

422
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:36,729
We share his ration.
Here.

423
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:44,604
Here.

424
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,075
So you got yourself a boyfriend, huh?

425
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:00,754
You were in the navy?

426
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:05,789
What do you think?

427
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,627
I thought maybe
it meant "jailbird."

428
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:12,497
Swallows.
It stands for hope.

429
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,267
First thing you see
when you reach land.

430
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,503
- I know.
- Yeah? How come?

431
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:20,437
You were in the navy?

432
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:22,874
Eighteen months.

433
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:25,611
Followed by six in the brig.
Didn't suit me.

434
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,780
A butterfly.

435
00:38:29,782 --> 00:38:32,416
So you're a thief now?

436
00:38:32,418 --> 00:38:34,655
Guess that didn't
suit you either.

437
00:38:43,896 --> 00:38:46,265
We should go sailing
sometime.

438
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:52,539
You got a boat?

439
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:57,341
Can you get any
of that?

440
00:38:57,343 --> 00:38:58,178
Maybe.

441
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:02,282
Well, let me know then.

442
00:39:07,452 --> 00:39:10,287
Your boyfriend's
got trouble.

443
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:12,289
Give me your money, or you
and your friend will die.

444
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,260
- Is there trouble?
- I was talking to your bitch.

445
00:39:17,262 --> 00:39:18,662
Now you're talking to me.

446
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,633
Work it out in the barracks!

447
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:25,803
Break is over.

448
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:27,841
Get in line!

449
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,711
Break is over.
Forward march.

450
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,515
Line it up.
Line it up!

451
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,921
Stop. Stop!

452
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,524
Turn around. Eyes up front.
Come on.

453
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:53,363
You know better than to truck your
ladies through here after a rainstorm.

454
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:56,733
Yeah.
Can you help me out?

455
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:58,269
I'll make it good for you.

456
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,671
Get the girls up here.

457
00:40:00,673 --> 00:40:01,608
Come on.

458
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,941
Watch out.

459
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,809
Watch out...

460
00:40:10,717 --> 00:40:12,619
Hey.

461
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:17,724
Can you hear me?

462
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,392
How much to take me
up the coast?

463
00:40:22,394 --> 00:40:24,361
Don't be stupid.

464
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:26,400
I'll give you 2,000.

465
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,269
Guard!

466
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:33,637
Don't turn me in,
for Christ's sake.

467
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,039
4,000.

468
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,510
What's the problem?

469
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:43,013
Just wanted to know which girl
I should send to repay you.

470
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:45,519
One that hasn't
caught anything yet.

471
00:40:48,954 --> 00:40:53,024
My boat is on the other
side of the river.

472
00:40:53,026 --> 00:40:55,325
I'll be there for
three more days.

473
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,929
It's 5,000.

474
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,629
You're a goddamned thief.

475
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:57,383
- The guards are coming.
- Don't fucking touch me!

476
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,727
I didn't know
it would be like this.

477
00:43:43,729 --> 00:43:46,832
I'll be dead long before
my appeal.

478
00:43:50,135 --> 00:43:52,671
I need to go with you.

479
00:43:59,644 --> 00:44:01,678
That wasn't part
of the deal.

480
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,718
Yes, I realize that, but I
still have to go with you.

481
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,994
You ever sail a boat?

482
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:18,965
Spend any time at sea?

483
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:25,635
Yes, I have spent a
number of days at sea.

484
00:44:25,637 --> 00:44:27,740
I was locked in a cage
for most of them.

485
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:33,109
But I think I understand
the concept well enough.

486
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:35,144
You can't come
with me, Dega.

487
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,887
You should call me Louis.

488
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,901
Keep it moving.

489
00:44:57,836 --> 00:44:58,838
Get 'em in line.

490
00:45:01,974 --> 00:45:03,742
Stand straight!

491
00:45:11,316 --> 00:45:12,918
Down on your knees.

492
00:45:14,986 --> 00:45:17,957
Take off your hats
and cross your arms.

493
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:25,932
At the moment of execution,
you're all to bow your heads.

494
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:46,086
A man stabbed two guards...

495
00:45:47,852 --> 00:45:50,620
one of whom died this morning,

496
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,959
leaving two children
without their father.

497
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,827
And for what?

498
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:59,195
So he could go on a run
through the jungle.

499
00:45:59,197 --> 00:46:01,734
Thank you
for coming!

500
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:06,171
Watch me go to hell!

501
00:46:50,048 --> 00:46:51,617
Prisoner ready.

502
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:10,169
Keeping you is no benefit.
Destroying you is no loss.

503
00:47:15,775 --> 00:47:17,274
You.

504
00:47:17,276 --> 00:47:18,645
Pick another inmate.

505
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:21,648
You carry the body.

506
00:48:20,805 --> 00:48:23,774
Go get
the boat ready.

507
00:48:52,403 --> 00:48:54,273
He's gone.

508
00:48:56,307 --> 00:48:58,711
It's just
flesh and blood.

509
00:49:09,854 --> 00:49:12,256
Why are you stopping?

510
00:49:12,258 --> 00:49:13,957
What are you doing?

511
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:15,729
Move.

512
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,300
I said, what the hell
are you doing?

513
00:49:22,535 --> 00:49:24,104
Get up.

514
00:49:26,472 --> 00:49:30,276
You get up,
you little worm.

515
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:36,345
Get your ass up.

516
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,329
You little worm.

517
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:55,135
Oh, shit.

518
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:57,470
Oh, shit.

519
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,939
Stop! Hey, stop!

520
00:50:10,515 --> 00:50:12,515
Hey!

521
00:50:12,517 --> 00:50:14,820
We've got a runner!

522
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:18,555
He's heading north.

523
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,622
Papi.

524
00:50:19,624 --> 00:50:22,291
- Papi?
- Heading north now!

525
00:50:22,293 --> 00:50:25,330
Papillon!

526
00:50:27,532 --> 00:50:29,968
Check the tree line.

527
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:57,863
Hey!

528
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:36,235
Pick him up.

529
00:51:37,669 --> 00:51:40,039
Come on. Come on.

530
00:52:00,626 --> 00:52:03,428
Oh. You're a good man.

531
00:52:07,131 --> 00:52:10,068
Yeah, I'm a good man
that wants his money.

532
00:52:12,704 --> 00:52:14,470
Look, I don't have it.

533
00:52:14,472 --> 00:52:16,673
Not with me.

534
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,408
But I'm gonna make it
worth your while.

535
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:20,209
I got a lot of money in Paris.

536
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:22,948
I'll give you
everything I got.

537
00:52:26,485 --> 00:52:27,954
Hmm.

538
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,436
Even if you had the money...

539
00:52:46,438 --> 00:52:49,071
the warden will pay us double.

540
00:52:49,073 --> 00:52:50,642
Son of a bitch.

541
00:53:27,311 --> 00:53:30,280
You're lucky
that guard didn't die.

542
00:53:30,282 --> 00:53:33,182
Otherwise, you would
have met the guillotine.

543
00:53:33,184 --> 00:53:36,620
Now you'll be transferred to
the island of Saint Joseph,

544
00:53:36,622 --> 00:53:40,727
where you'll serve a two-year
sentence in solitary confinement.

545
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:44,160
There's no
rehabilitation.

546
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:46,296
We know that's useless,

547
00:53:46,298 --> 00:53:48,735
so we do our best
to break you.

548
00:53:53,372 --> 00:53:55,575
Strange things
happen there.

549
00:53:57,242 --> 00:53:59,776
Especially to those
who cling to hope,

550
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,611
because there is no hope
on Saint Joseph.

551
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:04,349
Just silence.

552
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,365
You heard the warden.

553
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:25,204
Silence must be observed
at all times.

554
00:57:26,952 --> 00:57:29,322
Thought you grew wings,
didn't you?

555
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:35,595
Grab him.

556
00:57:37,928 --> 00:57:39,361
I'll teach you to be quiet.

557
00:57:47,872 --> 00:57:49,541
You make another peep...

558
00:57:50,709 --> 00:57:53,279
you might not survive
your time here.

559
00:58:05,423 --> 00:58:06,825
Huh.

560
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,482
Come on. He's crazy.
Come on. Come on.

561
00:58:33,485 --> 00:58:35,588
Enjoy your next
two years here.

562
01:00:52,756 --> 01:00:54,793
Dega.

563
01:02:06,965 --> 01:02:09,568
Hold on.
Need to check that.

564
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:17,673
What is that, hmm?

565
01:02:17,675 --> 01:02:20,175
Somebody paying you to bring this
shit in here? Son of a bitch.

566
01:02:20,177 --> 01:02:21,843
Huh? Who's paying you?

567
01:02:21,845 --> 01:02:23,680
Who's paying you, you son of a bitch?

568
01:02:25,749 --> 01:02:26,952
No!

569
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,254
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Whoa!

570
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,592
Jesus!
I think you killed him.

571
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,928
Get that body out of
here and clean up the mess.

572
01:02:40,331 --> 01:02:42,233
What the hell
were you thinking?

573
01:03:02,887 --> 01:03:05,189
No wonder you haven't
broken yet.

574
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,095
How long has it
being going on?

575
01:03:12,796 --> 01:03:14,867
You may speak.

576
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:20,572
Who sent you
those coconuts?

577
01:03:32,217 --> 01:03:34,119
If you don't fess up...

578
01:03:35,653 --> 01:03:37,755
I'll put you on half rations.

579
01:03:41,825 --> 01:03:44,195
You're choosing another
man's life over your own.

580
01:04:01,012 --> 01:04:02,948
Put him on half rations.

581
01:06:10,374 --> 01:06:12,343
I brought you some soup.

582
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,316
It's got meat in it.

583
01:06:39,938 --> 01:06:41,340
Just tell me his name.

584
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,818
Tell me his name.

585
01:07:20,477 --> 01:07:23,381
You think a person knows
when he's going mad?

586
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,518
Or you think
it's blissful ignorance?

587
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,822
'Cause you're about
to find out.

588
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:47,669
Put him in darkness for the
remainder of his sentence.

589
01:07:47,671 --> 01:07:49,405
Or the remainder of his life,

590
01:07:49,407 --> 01:07:51,043
whichever comes first.

591
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:27,099
Six.

592
01:10:32,737 --> 01:10:33,705
Two.

593
01:10:39,811 --> 01:10:41,446
Twenty-four.

594
01:10:56,661 --> 01:10:58,196
6-2-24.

595
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,269
Twenty-four.

596
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:29,227
This is a good escape.

597
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,128
Is he still alive?

598
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,732
Two years are up.

599
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:25,574
I know that some of
you, at this very moment,

600
01:13:25,576 --> 01:13:27,913
are thinking about escape.

601
01:13:29,246 --> 01:13:31,480
Feel free to try
whenever you like.

602
01:13:31,482 --> 01:13:33,785
We'll be happy
to shoot you.

603
01:13:35,318 --> 01:13:37,852
However, should you
avoid that mercy,

604
01:13:37,854 --> 01:13:41,856
there are two guardians
who are always on duty.

605
01:13:41,858 --> 01:13:45,526
The bush, where the best thing that
can happen to you is starvation.

606
01:13:45,528 --> 01:13:48,029
Or you could choose the sea,

607
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,333
where the sharks too,
are always hungry.

608
01:13:54,705 --> 01:13:57,905
If you manage to
survive your first attempt,

609
01:13:57,907 --> 01:14:01,677
you'll get two years
in solitary.

610
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,012
Second attempt is
five years in solitary,

611
01:14:04,014 --> 01:14:06,614
followed by a life sentence
at Devil's Island.

612
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:12,288
If you commit murder...

613
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:13,792
...you'll be executed.

614
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,329
That's all.

615
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:24,869
Papi.

616
01:14:45,455 --> 01:14:47,922
I wanted to come sooner,

617
01:14:47,924 --> 01:14:50,829
but I was afraid you
wouldn't wanna see me.

618
01:14:57,601 --> 01:14:58,836
I'm sorry.

619
01:15:00,103 --> 01:15:01,972
It's my fault you're here.

620
01:15:09,013 --> 01:15:11,012
As you predicted, um,

621
01:15:11,014 --> 01:15:12,883
my appeal's run into
some problems.

622
01:15:14,617 --> 01:15:17,118
But my wife's doing very well.

623
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,990
She recently married my lawyer.

624
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:28,767
Well, to hell with her then.

625
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,570
You son of a bitch.

626
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:38,008
I thought you'd gone
simple on me.

627
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:44,316
That's the idea.

628
01:15:52,822 --> 01:15:54,856
You know you'd have had
a much easier time

629
01:15:54,858 --> 01:15:57,126
if you'd just given them
my name.

630
01:15:57,128 --> 01:15:59,898
It's not like
I didn't think about it.

631
01:16:02,098 --> 01:16:04,565
I just know how goddamn
delicate you are.

632
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:05,767
Mm.

633
01:16:09,706 --> 01:16:12,106
I fear under
similar circumstances

634
01:16:12,108 --> 01:16:14,044
I would've fared
differently.

635
01:16:15,812 --> 01:16:17,815
I don't know how you made it.

636
01:16:19,015 --> 01:16:21,719
I just got used to the silence.

637
01:16:23,653 --> 01:16:25,389
If I ever get out...

638
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:29,794
I'm gonna live
a different kind of life.

639
01:16:34,197 --> 01:16:38,600
This Sunday, the warden will be
showing a film in the courtyard,

640
01:16:38,602 --> 01:16:40,935
entertaining some
local politicians.

641
01:16:40,937 --> 01:16:42,637
It'll be loud.

642
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:45,574
The guards will be doing
double-duty, spread very thin.

643
01:16:45,576 --> 01:16:48,546
This is your best chance.

644
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,614
Can you get a boat?

645
01:16:52,616 --> 01:16:53,818
No.

646
01:16:55,753 --> 01:16:57,785
What about Celier?
Is he still here?

647
01:16:57,787 --> 01:16:59,557
Unfortunately, yes.

648
01:17:00,857 --> 01:17:02,826
If he can still get a boat...

649
01:17:05,196 --> 01:17:07,495
do you have enough money
to pay for it?

650
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:10,567
Well, I might, but then
he'd wanna come with us.

651
01:17:12,102 --> 01:17:13,037
Us?

652
01:17:15,071 --> 01:17:16,106
Us.

653
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:21,513
All right.

654
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,716
But we still need a boat.

655
01:17:26,549 --> 01:17:28,083
You leave now!

656
01:17:28,085 --> 01:17:29,650
Leave!

657
01:17:29,652 --> 01:17:31,520
Get out!

658
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:33,625
Get out! Leave!

659
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,727
Get out!

660
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,659
- This man's mad!
- Go!

661
01:17:38,661 --> 01:17:40,596
- Get out!
- He's out of his mind!

662
01:17:40,598 --> 01:17:42,663
No!
No, no, no, no!

663
01:17:42,665 --> 01:17:43,664
No!

664
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,100
- No!
- He's out of his mind!

665
01:17:45,102 --> 01:17:47,069
Help me!
Help me!

666
01:17:47,071 --> 01:17:48,569
Come, Papi. Here.

667
01:17:48,571 --> 01:17:50,705
Come on, come... Calm down, calm down.
Let him go.

668
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:52,641
Let him go!

669
01:17:52,643 --> 01:17:54,510
It's okay, it's okay.

670
01:17:54,512 --> 01:17:56,144
Shh, shh.

671
01:17:56,146 --> 01:17:57,812
Bring me some pills.

672
01:17:57,814 --> 01:17:59,248
Come on.
Take one.

673
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,819
Bring me some water.

674
01:18:02,519 --> 01:18:03,720
Swallow.

675
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,027
It'll be okay.

676
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:25,742
Lights out, ten minutes.

677
01:18:54,304 --> 01:18:56,171
Oh!

678
01:18:56,173 --> 01:18:57,672
Shh, shh.

679
01:18:57,674 --> 01:18:59,675
- Get off of me.
- Just relax!

680
01:18:59,677 --> 01:19:00,809
- Leave me!
- Relax.

681
01:19:00,811 --> 01:19:02,778
Get off! I will never
let you fuck me.

682
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,879
Shh, shh.

683
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:09,554
You will soon, if you
know what's good for you.

684
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:27,802
Hey.

685
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:29,706
Hey, I just wanna talk.

686
01:19:32,108 --> 01:19:35,177
- I'm not a goddamn whore.
- That's not what I want.

687
01:19:35,179 --> 01:19:37,178
Yeah, everybody says that
until they do.

688
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:39,780
Trust me, I don't.

689
01:19:39,782 --> 01:19:42,751
I got a different proposition.

690
01:19:42,753 --> 01:19:46,288
If you repeat one word of this,
it's not gonna be good for you.

691
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:48,660
- I don't wanna know then.
- Maybe you do.

692
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,928
Look, I'm puttin'
something together.

693
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:56,064
This Sunday.

694
01:19:56,066 --> 01:19:58,269
We got room for one more.

695
01:20:00,403 --> 01:20:02,370
I have nothing to offer you.

696
01:20:02,372 --> 01:20:04,909
I need you to distract
that turnkey.

697
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:10,712
Get him to come in here at a
certain time, keep him occupied.

698
01:20:10,714 --> 01:20:12,216
If I do that,

699
01:20:13,282 --> 01:20:14,686
your plan better work.

700
01:20:15,753 --> 01:20:17,252
It'll work.

701
01:20:17,254 --> 01:20:19,287
It's not gonna be easy.

702
01:20:19,289 --> 01:20:21,593
Can you handle yourself?

703
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:25,897
You were framed
for murder, right?

704
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:30,968
Well, nobody framed me.

705
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,977
That's Celier.

706
01:20:40,143 --> 01:20:41,943
He's gotten us a boat.

707
01:20:41,945 --> 01:20:43,377
Let's see the arm.

708
01:20:43,379 --> 01:20:44,881
Infected.

709
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:49,720
Good job.

710
01:20:51,021 --> 01:20:52,887
Papi!

711
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:54,659
You skinny son of a bitch.

712
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,391
Good to see you.

713
01:20:57,393 --> 01:20:59,427
What'd you do
to your arm?

714
01:20:59,429 --> 01:21:01,762
I had to cut myself
to get in here.

715
01:21:01,764 --> 01:21:04,099
- It still work?
- Yeah, it's nothing. Don't think about it.

716
01:21:04,101 --> 01:21:07,368
- I can still kick your ass.
- Can we hurry this up? I have to get back.

717
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:08,972
Birdie, can you
shut up for once?

718
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,306
This is Maturette.
He's our fourth.

719
01:21:12,308 --> 01:21:15,177
Oh, yeah?

720
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:17,712
- You know how to handle yourself?
- Yeah, with a knife.

721
01:21:17,714 --> 01:21:20,716
- All right, take it easy.
- Feisty little one, huh?

722
01:21:22,251 --> 01:21:25,753
- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm set.

723
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:27,955
I got a guy that's
hiding a boat on the bank.

724
01:21:27,957 --> 01:21:30,492
It's upriver a ways.

725
01:21:30,494 --> 01:21:33,231
From there, it's a straight
shot to the ocean.

726
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,135
But we need
half the money now.

727
01:21:39,469 --> 01:21:41,235
What about you?

728
01:21:41,237 --> 01:21:43,771
When the film starts, we'll go
through the warden's building.

729
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:44,709
I'll have a key.

730
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:49,110
We got a plan.

731
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:50,380
We got a plan.

732
01:21:58,755 --> 01:21:59,956
You all right?

733
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:02,457
No.

734
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:06,127
I'm not sure
we can trust him.

735
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:08,363
Look at him,
he's unpredictable.

736
01:22:08,365 --> 01:22:09,998
He's like a caged animal.

737
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,467
We're all animals
in here, pal.

738
01:22:15,205 --> 01:22:16,441
He'll be fine.

739
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,276
He needs the money now.

740
01:22:32,188 --> 01:22:33,488
Here.

741
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,224
It's the sedatives
they gave me.

742
01:22:36,226 --> 01:22:38,560
Get 'em in the guards' coffee.

743
01:22:38,562 --> 01:22:40,298
We'll do the rest.

744
01:22:42,432 --> 01:22:44,332
I have to get back.

745
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:45,803
Hey.

746
01:22:48,304 --> 01:22:50,006
You're doin' good.

747
01:23:04,554 --> 01:23:06,587
- Hey.
- What do we have here, huh?

748
01:23:06,589 --> 01:23:08,025
Go to hell.

749
01:23:09,459 --> 01:23:11,860
Give me those back.

750
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:13,060
He's gonna fuck up
our plan.

751
01:23:13,062 --> 01:23:14,995
It's gonna be fine.

752
01:23:16,967 --> 01:23:19,400
What the fuck are you doing, man?

753
01:23:26,143 --> 01:23:27,943
All right!
That's enough!

754
01:23:27,945 --> 01:23:29,947
Break it up!
Break it up!

755
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:33,280
He does the warden's books.

756
01:23:44,527 --> 01:23:46,895
I had to figure I'd know
how to throw a punch

757
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:49,433
considering how often
my father used to beat me.

758
01:23:53,937 --> 01:23:55,139
Yours too?

759
01:23:56,473 --> 01:23:58,810
My parents are school teachers.

760
01:24:02,979 --> 01:24:04,247
See ya tonight.

761
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:17,527
Anisette for the warden.

762
01:24:18,495 --> 01:24:19,863
The best you have.

763
01:24:22,299 --> 01:24:24,001
Just give me the bottle.

764
01:25:40,744 --> 01:25:43,278
Here's two or three.

765
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,080
Would you gentlemen
like your coffees freshened?

766
01:25:46,082 --> 01:25:47,218
Bring it on in.

767
01:26:04,401 --> 01:26:06,400
Compliments of the warden.

768
01:26:06,402 --> 01:26:08,203
Wow.

769
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:09,503
Very nice.

770
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:16,579
Here.

771
01:26:21,485 --> 01:26:24,655
If we kill someone and this goes
wrong, it's the guillotine.

772
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,124
No one dies.

773
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:54,149
Give me another one
of them.

774
01:26:54,151 --> 01:26:55,519
All right.

775
01:27:11,835 --> 01:27:13,168
Dega!

776
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,102
Where are you going?

777
01:27:15,104 --> 01:27:16,404
Dega!

778
01:27:16,406 --> 01:27:18,175
The warden.
Now!

779
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:55,310
Stop!
Shh, shh!

780
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,444
Shh, shh!

781
01:27:56,446 --> 01:27:58,613
What was that?

782
01:27:58,615 --> 01:28:00,217
I'd better go check.

783
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:25,276
It's working.

784
01:28:47,731 --> 01:28:50,265
Oh, man.

785
01:28:50,267 --> 01:28:52,135
We're too early.

786
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,669
Hey, got a light?

787
01:28:55,671 --> 01:28:57,372
Yes, of course, sir.

788
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:10,318
Oh! Oh!
Okay, go inside.

789
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,686
Everybody, go inside.
Come on.

790
01:29:12,688 --> 01:29:14,325
- Come on, darling.
- Fuck.

791
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:17,862
- That's our way out.
- No, no.

792
01:29:25,568 --> 01:29:27,267
What's he doin'?

793
01:29:31,674 --> 01:29:32,974
- Power's off!
- Fuck!

794
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,681
Papi, we gotta move.
We can't stay here.

795
01:29:40,683 --> 01:29:42,984
We wait for Dega.

796
01:29:42,986 --> 01:29:45,252
Forget about Dega!

797
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:46,988
He's not reliable.

798
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:48,655
And you know it!

799
01:29:48,657 --> 01:29:51,226
Let's just go.
Come on.

800
01:29:51,228 --> 01:29:52,961
You wanna go?

801
01:29:52,963 --> 01:29:54,331
Go.

802
01:29:56,232 --> 01:29:57,267
You with me?

803
01:29:58,634 --> 01:30:00,436
Uh, yeah.
Open the gate.

804
01:30:01,504 --> 01:30:02,740
What's wrong with you?

805
01:30:08,644 --> 01:30:12,680
Ha! I stole the keys to get
us up to the central walkway.

806
01:30:12,682 --> 01:30:15,249
We can take that
to the guard tower.

807
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:18,720
As long as the lights stay off,
they won't see us.

808
01:30:18,722 --> 01:30:20,555
And then we jump?

809
01:30:20,557 --> 01:30:22,193
You got a better idea?

810
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:31,332
Come on.

811
01:30:31,334 --> 01:30:32,570
Come on!

812
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:38,675
Go, go!

813
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:45,381
Guard the wall!

814
01:30:46,715 --> 01:30:48,483
You! Take me
to the south wall.

815
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:50,485
Yes, sir!

816
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:09,604
Oh, shit.

817
01:31:09,606 --> 01:31:11,342
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

818
01:31:12,675 --> 01:31:13,943
Easy.

819
01:31:20,983 --> 01:31:23,083
You all right?

820
01:31:23,085 --> 01:31:24,918
Let's go!
Come on!

821
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,456
Go, go, go.

822
01:31:45,075 --> 01:31:46,577
Come on!

823
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:48,611
Jump!

824
01:31:49,745 --> 01:31:50,980
Come on!

825
01:31:55,018 --> 01:31:56,950
Come on!
Come on!

826
01:31:56,952 --> 01:31:58,656
They're gonna see you!
Come on!

827
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:03,658
Come on!

828
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,360
Jump!
Come on!

829
01:32:05,362 --> 01:32:08,562
Jump!

830
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:10,698
Shit!

831
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:11,932
Hey.
It's broken.

832
01:32:11,934 --> 01:32:13,967
- Leave him.
- He's got the money.

833
01:32:13,969 --> 01:32:15,669
Aah.

834
01:32:15,671 --> 01:32:17,040
Maturette, help me.

835
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:19,606
Christ!

836
01:32:19,608 --> 01:32:21,378
All right, come on.

837
01:32:22,946 --> 01:32:23,881
Let's go.

838
01:32:34,156 --> 01:32:35,525
Come on.

839
01:32:40,629 --> 01:32:42,396
How much further
to the boat?

840
01:32:42,398 --> 01:32:43,931
You're slowing us down,
Dega.

841
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:46,770
Come on.
We've got to move faster.

842
01:33:13,429 --> 01:33:15,798
Don't take another step.

843
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,535
You're not takin' me back.

844
01:33:20,937 --> 01:33:23,573
That depends
if you have my money.

845
01:33:28,577 --> 01:33:29,646
Hey.

846
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,547
Papi.
It's okay.

847
01:33:32,549 --> 01:33:34,017
This is my guy
with the boat.

848
01:33:40,189 --> 01:33:41,655
Where's our boat?

849
01:33:41,657 --> 01:33:43,858
It's a ways up the river.

850
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:46,726
Want me to take you
there, pay me.

851
01:33:46,728 --> 01:33:47,830
Or fuck you.

852
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:04,448
This is all I have left.

853
01:34:09,885 --> 01:34:11,988
Let's keep that between us.

854
01:34:33,843 --> 01:34:35,512
Enjoy your freedom!

855
01:35:23,058 --> 01:35:25,760
Fuck! What kind of
shit boat did you get us?

856
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:27,761
Shut up, Dega!

857
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:30,230
You're lucky to be here.
Keep bailing!

858
01:35:30,232 --> 01:35:31,932
Get it outta the boat.

859
01:35:31,934 --> 01:35:34,235
I'm trying.

860
01:35:34,237 --> 01:35:36,270
Don't throw it at me, Dega.
Goddamn it.

861
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,172
- Throw it in the water!
- I'm throwing it at the water.

862
01:35:38,174 --> 01:35:39,907
- Maturette!
- Yes?

863
01:35:39,909 --> 01:35:40,811
Check the tiller.

864
01:35:42,879 --> 01:35:44,147
I got it,
I got it.

865
01:35:49,117 --> 01:35:50,784
Papi.

866
01:35:50,786 --> 01:35:53,119
This boat can't hold all of us.
You know it.

867
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:54,691
We need to lighten
the weight.

868
01:36:01,863 --> 01:36:04,065
He's gonna die anyway, Papi.

869
01:36:04,067 --> 01:36:05,865
Nobody needs to die.

870
01:36:05,867 --> 01:36:08,101
Fuck!
It fell off!

871
01:36:08,103 --> 01:36:09,971
- Fix the tiller!
- It's broken.

872
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,174
Fix the tiller!

873
01:36:12,174 --> 01:36:13,807
Move!

874
01:36:21,784 --> 01:36:22,986
Come on.

875
01:36:57,754 --> 01:37:00,387
Here, take this.
Take this.

876
01:37:00,389 --> 01:37:01,791
Maturette, help me.

877
01:37:16,839 --> 01:37:19,273
This storm is
gonna sink the boat.

878
01:37:19,275 --> 01:37:21,441
We need to act,
and we need to act now.

879
01:37:21,443 --> 01:37:22,979
Just let me get
the boat ready.

880
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,183
Did you lose your mind?
Huh?

881
01:37:27,316 --> 01:37:29,249
You wanna die
because of this guy?

882
01:37:29,251 --> 01:37:31,321
Nobody needs to die.

883
01:37:36,092 --> 01:37:37,227
Well, we can't all live.

884
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:41,028
Dega, he's dead weight.

885
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:42,799
How much money you have?

886
01:37:45,367 --> 01:37:47,435
He doesn't have any money.

887
01:37:47,437 --> 01:37:49,436
He doesn't have any money?

888
01:37:49,438 --> 01:37:51,337
You hear that, Maturette?

889
01:37:51,339 --> 01:37:52,909
They've been lying to us.

890
01:37:54,443 --> 01:37:55,911
You wanna die for him?

891
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:00,413
That makes it
two against one, Papi.

892
01:38:00,415 --> 01:38:01,981
Step aside.

893
01:38:01,983 --> 01:38:03,851
You don't need to do anything.

894
01:38:03,853 --> 01:38:05,985
Step aside, Papi!

895
01:38:05,987 --> 01:38:07,223
I'm not gonna die
for that guy.

896
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:10,927
Last chance, Papi.
Step aside!

897
01:38:13,228 --> 01:38:15,197
I don't know about you,
I'm going home!

898
01:39:10,253 --> 01:39:11,385
Stop!

899
01:39:11,387 --> 01:39:13,186
Stop!

900
01:39:13,188 --> 01:39:15,057
Enough!
That's enough!

901
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:17,894
That's enough.

902
01:39:20,495 --> 01:39:21,561
Enough.

903
01:41:43,505 --> 01:41:45,040
Welcome.

904
01:41:50,412 --> 01:41:52,312
I was traveling
with two other men.

905
01:41:52,314 --> 01:41:54,183
They are
being cared for.

906
01:41:59,187 --> 01:42:01,055
Where are we?

907
01:42:01,057 --> 01:42:03,193
This is Colombia.

908
01:42:06,195 --> 01:42:07,597
We know where
you've come from.

909
01:42:11,099 --> 01:42:13,436
But you need only repent.

910
01:42:14,536 --> 01:42:17,973
Allow God back
into your life...

911
01:42:19,607 --> 01:42:21,644
and you'll be forgiven.

912
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:26,046
You should go
and wash yourself.

913
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,485
Then come
and pray with us.

914
01:43:52,067 --> 01:43:53,736
We need to keep movin'.

915
01:43:59,575 --> 01:44:01,344
They know
where we came from.

916
01:44:04,146 --> 01:44:06,215
Our deal is done.

917
01:44:07,715 --> 01:44:10,452
I told you
we couldn't trust him.

918
01:44:14,557 --> 01:44:16,291
I'm leaving.

919
01:44:19,161 --> 01:44:21,064
With or without you.

920
01:44:39,581 --> 01:44:41,050
Good luck.

921
01:44:53,262 --> 01:44:55,428
Papi!
We made it!

922
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:57,163
Papi.

923
01:44:57,165 --> 01:44:58,664
It's paradise here.

924
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:00,335
Yeah, but it's not home.

925
01:45:02,338 --> 01:45:03,706
Not for me, anyway.

926
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:07,509
Good luck, Maturette.

927
01:46:19,814 --> 01:46:21,317
We're leaving.

928
01:46:22,483 --> 01:46:23,816
Now.

929
01:46:23,818 --> 01:46:25,722
Come on.

930
01:46:27,388 --> 01:46:28,821
- Aah!
- Papi!

931
01:46:28,823 --> 01:46:30,425
Maturette!

932
01:46:40,835 --> 01:46:42,468
Repent.

933
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:44,503
If you are truly sorry
for what you have done,

934
01:46:44,505 --> 01:46:46,273
then you have
nothing to fear.

935
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:48,244
God will watch over you.

936
01:46:56,352 --> 01:46:57,887
You came back.

937
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:33,756
Come on, Papi.

938
01:47:59,982 --> 01:48:02,285
I had to come
and see this for myself.

939
01:48:03,719 --> 01:48:05,955
Few men survive
five years in solitary.

940
01:48:13,829 --> 01:48:15,598
What were you
living for?

941
01:48:18,599 --> 01:48:20,969
'Cause I don't think you're gonna
find it where you're going...

942
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,309
Devil's Island.

943
01:50:33,134 --> 01:50:37,439
Now, what's the son of two school
teachers doing in a place like this?

944
01:51:15,978 --> 01:51:17,146
Well?

945
01:51:18,981 --> 01:51:20,182
What do you think?

946
01:51:24,052 --> 01:51:26,022
I've had five years
to work on it.

947
01:51:27,723 --> 01:51:31,591
The warden wasn't very happy
with my disobedience.

948
01:51:31,593 --> 01:51:35,194
So he sent me straight here
to Devil's Island.

949
01:51:50,646 --> 01:51:52,682
Let's get some food in you.

950
01:52:09,697 --> 01:52:11,200
Rise and shine.

951
01:52:13,835 --> 01:52:14,770
Come on.

952
01:52:16,004 --> 01:52:18,107
There's work to be done.

953
01:53:29,745 --> 01:53:31,613
Can we get to the ocean?

954
01:53:41,389 --> 01:53:42,959
I know what you're thinking.

955
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,597
But even if you survive
the fall...

956
01:53:49,731 --> 01:53:51,634
you'll never survive
the ocean.

957
01:55:05,973 --> 01:55:07,106
Hmm?

958
01:55:07,108 --> 01:55:09,175
It's all about the waves.

959
01:55:09,177 --> 01:55:11,110
What?

960
01:55:11,112 --> 01:55:12,912
What are you talking about?

961
01:55:12,914 --> 01:55:15,315
What do you think
I'm talkin' about?

962
01:55:15,317 --> 01:55:17,117
Oh, go back to bed.

963
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:18,517
That's suicide, not escape.

964
01:55:18,519 --> 01:55:20,787
No. Listen.

965
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:24,257
All we need to do is build a
raft and get it to the ocean.

966
01:55:24,259 --> 01:55:27,029
The tide will take us
straight to the mainland.

967
01:55:30,232 --> 01:55:32,398
Just come and see.

968
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,736
Come and see!

969
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:55,020
See?

970
01:55:55,022 --> 01:55:56,791
We ride the current
to freedom.

971
01:58:13,161 --> 01:58:16,695
I'm a little concerned about your
ability to protect me right now.

972
01:58:16,697 --> 01:58:19,198
Don't worry. The fall
will probably kill us.

973
01:58:23,338 --> 01:58:25,040
Let's tie these together.

974
01:58:37,251 --> 01:58:38,620
I need to stay.

975
01:58:46,728 --> 01:58:48,597
What are you talking about?

976
01:58:53,134 --> 01:58:54,937
I need to stay.

977
01:58:56,705 --> 01:58:59,441
For the same reason
you have to go.

978
01:59:01,576 --> 01:59:03,212
I belong here.

979
01:59:09,150 --> 01:59:10,352
It's okay.

980
01:59:14,054 --> 01:59:15,223
It's good.

981
01:59:49,156 --> 01:59:51,259
Go on now. You don't wanna
waste any more time.

982
02:01:44,505 --> 02:01:46,374
Louis!

983
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:50,379
Louis!

984
02:01:53,147 --> 02:01:55,083
Louis!

985
02:01:57,684 --> 02:02:00,822
I made it,
you dirty little forger!

986
02:02:03,825 --> 02:02:05,458
Whoo!

987
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:07,426
Whoo-hoo!

988
02:02:10,631 --> 02:02:12,800
Whoo!

989
02:03:08,923 --> 02:03:10,459
Thank you.

990
02:03:14,762 --> 02:03:15,860
Sir?

991
02:03:15,862 --> 02:03:17,331
Your water.

992
02:03:18,866 --> 02:03:20,736
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

993
02:03:27,008 --> 02:03:29,809
<i>I'm surprised
you risked coming back.</i>

994
02:03:29,811 --> 02:03:32,845
I'd read
the statute of limitations.

995
02:03:32,847 --> 02:03:34,349
You're still a wanted man.

996
02:03:35,383 --> 02:03:36,785
I won't be here long.

997
02:03:38,987 --> 02:03:40,889
My home is Venezuela now.

998
02:03:42,656 --> 02:03:46,258
But it's important

999
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,229
that my memoir
be published here...

1000
02:03:49,464 --> 02:03:50,832
in France.

1001
02:04:17,592 --> 02:04:20,429
My wife convinced me
to write it all down...

1002
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:24,533
while I'm still young enough
to remember.

1003
02:04:29,403 --> 02:04:31,406
So is this really your story?

1004
02:04:39,813 --> 02:04:41,682
It's the story of
a lot of men.

1005
02:05:59,863 --> 02:06:04,863
