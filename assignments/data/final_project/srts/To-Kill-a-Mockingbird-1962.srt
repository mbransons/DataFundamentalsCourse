1
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:29,798
Bing!

2
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,939
Maycomb was a tired old town

3
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,776
even in 1932 when
I first knew it.

4
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,321
Somehow, it was hotter then.

5
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,159
Men's stiff collars wilted
by 9:00 in the morning.

6
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:25,622
Ladies bathed before noon,
after their 3:00 naps

7
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,917
and by nightfall
were like soft teacakes

8
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,544
with frostings of sweat
and sweet talcum.

9
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,300
A day was 24 hours long,
but it seemed longer.

10
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,763
There was no hurry, for there was
nowhere to go and nothing to buy

11
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,681
and no money to buy it with.

12
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:46,017
Although Maycomb County
had recently been told

13
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,311
that it had nothing to
fear but fear itself.

14
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,816
That summer I was 6 years old.

15
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,068
Good morning,
Mr. Cunningham.

16
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,736
Good morning, miss.

17
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,321
My daddy's
getting dressed.

18
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,323
Would you like me
to call him for you?

19
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,617
No, miss,
I don't care to bother.

20
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,744
Why, it's no bother,
Mr. Cunningham.

21
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:06,329
He'll be happy
to see you.

22
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:07,831
Atticus.

23
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,418
Atticus!

24
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,837
Here's Mr. Cunningham.

25
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,382
Good morning, Walter.

26
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,092
Good morning,
Mr. Finch.

27
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,511
I didn't want to
bother you none.

28
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,722
I brought you these hickory
nuts as part of my entailment.

29
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,934
Thank you. The collards we had
last week were delicious.

30
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,395
Well, morning.

31
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,355
Morning, Walter.

32
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:40,572
Scout, I think maybe next
time Mr. Cunningham comes,

33
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,740
you'd better not call me.

34
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,534
I thought you'd
want to thank him.

35
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,869
Oh, I do.

36
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,413
But I think it embarrasses
him to be thanked.

37
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,504
Why does he bring you
all this stuff?

38
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,132
He is paying me for some
legal work I did for him.

39
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,134
Why is he paying
you like this?

40
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,720
That's the only way he can.
He has no money.

41
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,097
- Is he poor?
- Yes.

42
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,518
Are we poor?

43
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,770
We are, indeed.

44
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,190
Are we as poor as
the Cunninghams?

45
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,567
No, not exactly.

46
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,695
The Cunninghams are
country folks, farmers.

47
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,239
The Crash hit them
the hardest.

48
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,868
Scout,
call your brother.

49
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,871
Atticus,
Jem's up in the tree.

50
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,332
He says he won't come
down until you agree

51
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,917
to play football
for the Methodists.

52
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,339
Jem?

53
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,511
Son, why don't you come
on down out of there now

54
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,554
and have your breakfast?

55
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,474
Calpurnia has a good one.
Hot biscuits.

56
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,683
No, sir.

57
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,061
Not until you agree to play
football for the Methodists.

58
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,687
Son, I can't do that.

59
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,273
I explained to you, I'm
too old to get out there.

60
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,610
After all, I'm the
only father you have.

61
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:03,988
You wouldn't want me to go and get
my head knocked off, would you?

62
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,615
I ain't coming down.

63
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,493
Suit yourself.

64
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,083
Morning.

65
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,210
Good morning,
Miss Maudie.

66
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,962
What's going on
over there?

67
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,798
I'm having a terrible
time, Miss Maudie.

68
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,550
Jem's staying
up in the tree

69
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,052
until Atticus agrees to play
football for the Methodists

70
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,305
and Atticus says
he's too old.

71
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,767
Every time I want him to do
something, he's too old.

72
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,811
He's too old
for anything.

73
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,313
He can do plenty of things.

74
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,316
You be good, children.
Mind Cal.

75
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:43,194
Good morning, Maudie.

76
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,612
Good morning, Atticus.

77
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,156
He won't let me have a gun

78
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,785
and he'll only play touch
football with me, never tackle.

79
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:55,665
He can make somebody's will so
airtight you can't break it.

80
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,295
You count your blessings and
stop complaining, both of you.

81
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,298
Thank your stars he has
the sense to act his age.

82
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,883
Jem, he is pretty old.

83
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,594
I can't help that.

84
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,141
Hey.

85
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,688
Hey, yourself.

86
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,524
I'm Charles Baker Harris.
I can read.

87
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,236
You got anything that needs
reading, I can do it.

88
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,531
How old are you?
Four-and-a-half?

89
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,116
Going on seven.

90
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,576
No wonder, then.

91
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,953
Scout's been reading
since she was born,

92
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,205
and she don't start
school till next month.

93
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,500
You look right puny
for going on seven.

94
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,919
I'm little, but I'm old.

95
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,883
Folks call me Dill.
I'm from Meridian, Mississippi

96
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,428
and I'm spending two weeks next
door with my aunt Stephanie.

97
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,431
My mama worked for a
photographer in Meridian.

98
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:58,561
She entered my picture in the Beautiful
Child contest and won $5 on it.

99
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,938
She gave the money to me

100
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,900
and I went to the picture
show 20 times with it.

101
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,071
Our mama's dead but we've got a daddy.
Where's your daddy?

102
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,239
I haven't got one.

103
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,283
Is he dead?

104
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,826
No.

105
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:15,870
Well...

106
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,123
Well, if he's not dead,
you've got one, haven't you?

107
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:23,961
Hush, Scout.

108
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,299
What did I do?
What did I do?

109
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,096
Uh, Dill,
this is Calpurnia.

110
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,181
Pleased to know you,
Dill.

111
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,266
Pleased to know you.

112
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,560
My daddy owns
the L and N Railroad.

113
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,147
He's going to let me run the
engine all the way to New Orleans.

114
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,440
Is that so?

115
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,821
- He says I can invite anybody...
- Shh.

116
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:57,453
There goes the meanest man that
ever took a breath of life.

117
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,917
Why is he
the meanest man?

118
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,629
Well, for one thing,

119
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,507
he has a boy named Boo

120
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,010
that he keeps chained to a bed
in the house over yonder.

121
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,807
Come on.

122
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,814
See, he lives
over there.

123
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,859
Boo only comes
out at night

124
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,319
when you're asleep
and it's pitch dark.

125
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,614
When you wake up at night,
you can hear him.

126
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,033
Once I heard him scratching
on our screen door

127
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,828
but he was gone by the
time Atticus got there.

128
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,331
I wonder what
he does in there.

129
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,168
I wonder what he looks like.

130
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,128
Well,

131
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,175
judging from his tracks,
he's about 6'6" tall.

132
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,345
He eats raw squirrels and
all the cats he can catch.

133
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:00,683
There's a long, jagged scar that
runs all the way across his face.

134
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,186
His teeth are
yellow and rotten.

135
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,606
His eyes are popped, and he
drools most of the time.

136
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,693
Oh, I don't believe you.

137
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,362
Dill, what are you
doing here?

138
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,365
My Lord, Aunt Stephanie!
You almost gave me a heart attack.

139
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,951
Dill, I don't want you playing
around that house over there.

140
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,204
There's a maniac lives
there and he's dangerous.

141
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,413
See?

142
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:25,500
I was just trying to warn him about Boo.
He wouldn't believe me.

143
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,877
You'd just better believe
him, Mr. Dill Harris.

144
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,213
Tell him about the time Boo
tried to kill his papa.

145
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,964
I was standing
in my yard one day

146
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,550
when his mama come out yelling,
"He's killing us all."

147
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,969
Turned out that Boo was
sitting in the living room

148
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,387
cutting up the paper
for his scrapbook,

149
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,889
and when his daddy
come by,

150
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,225
he reached over with his scissors,
stabbed him in his leg,

151
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,560
pulled them out and went
right on cutting the paper.

152
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,479
They wanted to send
him to an asylum.

153
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,565
But his daddy said, "No Radley
is going to any asylum."

154
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,235
So they locked him up in the
basement of the courthouse

155
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,986
till he nearly
died of the damp,

156
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,696
and his daddy
brought him back home.

157
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:59,575
There he is, to this day, sitting
over there with his scissors.

158
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,911
Lord knows what
he's doing or thinking.

159
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,252
Six, seven, eight,

160
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,380
nine, ten.

161
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,928
Come on, Scout.
It's 5:00.

162
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,684
Where are you going?

163
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,519
Time to meet Atticus.

164
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,187
Why do you call
your daddy Atticus?

165
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,772
Because Jem does.

166
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,274
But why does he?

167
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,861
I don't know. He just started
to ever since he began talking.

168
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,449
Wait, stop.

169
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,119
Mrs. Dubose is
on her porch.

170
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,581
Listen, no matter what she says
to you, don't answer her back.

171
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,792
There's a Confederate pistol
in her lap under her shawl

172
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:53,546
and she'll kill you as quick
as look at you. Come on.

173
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,472
Hey, Mrs. Dubose.

174
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,808
Don't you say "hey"
to me, you ugly girl.

175
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,644
You say, "Good afternoon,
Mrs. Dubose."

176
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,731
You come over here
when I'm talking to you.

177
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,024
You come over here...

178
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,734
Hey, Atticus.

179
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,736
- You listen to me...
- Atticus, this is Dill.

180
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,987
How do you do, Dill?

181
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,156
Don't your daddy
teach you to respect old people?

182
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,117
You come back here,
Jean Louise Finch!

183
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,953
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Dubose.

184
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,497
My!

185
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,417
You look like a picture
this afternoon.

186
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,669
He don't say
a picture of what.

187
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,297
My goodness gracious,
look at your flowers.

188
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,008
Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful?

189
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,511
Mrs. Dubose, the
gardens at Bellingrath

190
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,639
have nothing to compare
with your flowers.

191
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,768
I don't think they're
as nice as last year.

192
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:49,936
I can't agree with you.

193
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,312
He gets her interested
in something nice

194
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,396
so she forgets
being mean.

195
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,192
I think your yard is going to
be the showplace of this town.

196
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,443
Well...

197
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,487
Grand seeing you,
Mrs. Dubose.

198
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,044
"I had two cats

199
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,047
"which I brought ashore

200
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,633
"on my first raft.

201
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,804
"And I had a dog."

202
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,976
Atticus, do you think
Boo Radley ever really

203
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,436
comes and looks in
my window at night?

204
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,480
Jem says he does.

205
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,315
This afternoon when we were
over by their house...

206
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,525
Scout.

207
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,570
I told you and Jem to leave
those poor people alone.

208
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,242
I want you to stay away from their
house and stop tormenting them.

209
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,077
Yes, sir.

210
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,580
I think that's all the reading for
tonight, honey. It's getting late.

211
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,040
What time is it?

212
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,583
8:30.

213
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,794
May I see your watch?

214
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,315
"To Atticus,
my beloved husband."

215
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,405
Atticus, Jem says this watch is
going to belong to him someday.

216
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,740
That's right.

217
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,366
Why?

218
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,785
Well,

219
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,330
it's customary for the boy
to have his father's watch.

220
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,876
What are you going
to give me?

221
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,592
I don't know that I have much
else of value that belongs to me.

222
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,889
But there's
a pearl necklace,

223
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,100
there's a ring that
belonged to your mother.

224
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,147
And I've put them away,
and they're to be yours.

225
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,116
Good night, Scout.

226
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,493
Good night.

227
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,088
- Good night, Jem.
- Good night.

228
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,602
Jem?

229
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,812
Yeah.

230
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,527
How old was I
when Mama died?

231
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,195
Two.

232
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,781
And how old were you?

233
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,157
Six.

234
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,451
As old as I am now?

235
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,619
Mmm-hmm.

236
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,665
Was Mama pretty?

237
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,333
Mmm-hmm.

238
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,128
Was Mama nice?

239
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,214
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,467
Did you love her?

241
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,761
Yeah.

242
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,388
Did I love her?

243
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,557
Yeah.

244
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,186
Do you miss her?

245
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,563
Mmm-hmm

246
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,866
Evening, Atticus.

247
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,409
Good evening, Judge.

248
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,206
Rather warm, isn't it?

249
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,875
Yes, indeed.

250
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,465
How's Mrs. Taylor?

251
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,217
She's fine, thank you.

252
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,391
Atticus, you've heard
about Tom Robinson?

253
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,144
Yes, sir.

254
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,356
Grand jury will get around
to charging him tomorrow.

255
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,908
I was thinking about appointing
you to take his case.

256
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,832
I realize you're very busy
these days with your practice

257
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,295
and your children need
a great deal of your time.

258
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,007
Yes, sir.

259
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,598
I'll take the case.

260
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,853
I'll send a boy over for you
tomorrow, when his hearing comes up.

261
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,608
Well, uh,

262
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,652
I'll see you tomorrow,
Atticus.

263
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,945
Yes, sir.

264
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,741
And thank you.

265
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,868
Yes, sir.

266
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,672
Hey, Jem.

267
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,259
I bet you a Gray Ghost
against two Tom Swifts

268
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,388
you wouldn't go any farther
than Boo Radley's gate.

269
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,435
You're scared to,
ain't you?

270
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,687
I ain't scared.

271
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,357
I go past Boo Radley's house
nearly every day of my life.

272
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,900
Always running.

273
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,735
You hush up, Scout.

274
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,491
Come on, Dill.

275
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,868
Me first!

276
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,537
You gotta let
Dill be first.

277
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,830
No, me.

278
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,498
Let her be first.

279
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,002
All right, get in.
Hurry up.

280
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,461
All right.

281
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,797
You ready?

282
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,507
Uh-huh. Let her go.

283
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,773
Scout!

284
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,115
Scout, get away from there!
Scout, come on!

285
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,827
Scout, don't just
lie there. Get up!

286
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,374
Come on, Scout.

287
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:38,552
Run for your life, Scout!
Come on, Dill.

288
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,729
Now who's a coward?

289
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:53,067
You tell them about this back in
Meridian County, Mr. Dill Harris.

290
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,362
I'll tell you
what let's do.

291
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,280
Let's go down
to the courthouse

292
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,074
and see the room
they locked Boo up in.

293
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,159
My aunt says
it's bat-infested,

294
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,827
and he nearly died
from the mildew.

295
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,996
Come on,
I bet they've got chains

296
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,956
and instruments of
torture down there.

297
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,209
Come on.

298
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,046
Young Finch.

299
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,173
Yes, sir.

300
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,883
If you're looking
for your daddy,

301
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,551
he's inside
the courthouse.

302
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,053
Thank you, sir, but we're
not looking for...

303
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,138
Thank you,
Mr. Townsend, sir.

304
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,518
What is your daddy doing
in the courthouse?

305
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,937
He's a lawyer
and he has a case.

306
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,564
The grand jury is charging
his client today.

307
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:36,026
I heard something about it last
night when Judge Taylor came over.

308
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,319
Let's go watch.

309
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:38,654
No, Dill.

310
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,364
He wouldn't like that.

311
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,490
Dill!

312
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,412
Dill, wait a minute.

313
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,710
- Is that the courtroom?
- Yeah.

314
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,337
Shh.

315
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,551
I can't see anything.

316
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:01,635
Shh.

317
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,056
You all lift me up so I
can see what's going on.

318
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,767
All right.
Make a saddle, Scout.

319
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,441
Not much is happening.

320
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,486
The judge looks
like he's asleep.

321
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,741
I see your daddy
and a colored man.

322
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:26,660
The colored man...

323
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:27,744
Shh.

324
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,914
The colored man looks
to me like he's crying.

325
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,249
And I've seen him...

326
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,543
I wonder what he's
done to cry about.

327
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,628
What's going on?

328
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:41,133
There's a whole lot of men
sitting together on one side

329
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,761
and one man keeps pointing at
the colored man and yelling.

330
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,474
They're taking
the colored man away.

331
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,267
Where's Atticus?

332
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,605
I can't see
your daddy now, either.

333
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,776
I wonder where
in the world...

334
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,236
Scout, Jem.

335
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,573
What in the world
are you doing here?

336
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,241
Hello, Atticus.

337
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,369
What are you
doing here?

338
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,457
We came down to find out where
Boo Radley was locked up.

339
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,417
We wanted to
see the bats.

340
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,046
I want you all
back home right away.

341
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,172
Yes, sir.

342
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,465
Run along, now.

343
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,676
I'll see you there
for dinner.

344
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,564
Hey, Atticus.

345
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,776
Mr. Ewell.

346
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,154
Captain, I'm real sorry
they picked you

347
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,657
to defend that nigger
that raped my Mayella.

348
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,867
I don't know why
I didn't kill him myself

349
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,702
instead of going
to the sheriff.

350
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,788
That would've saved
you and the sheriff

351
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,331
and the taxpayers
lots of trouble.

352
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,958
Excuse me, Mr. Ewell,
I'm very busy.

353
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,670
Hey, captain, somebody
told me just now that

354
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:04,841
they thought that you believed Tom
Robinson's story against ours.

355
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,636
And you know
what I said?

356
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,641
I said, "You're wrong, man.
You're dead wrong.

357
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,102
"Mr. Finch ain't taking
his story against ours."

358
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,564
They was wrong,
wasn't they?

359
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,108
I've been appointed
to defend Tom Robinson.

360
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:24,027
And now that he's been charged,
that's what I intend to do.

361
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,196
You're taking his...

362
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,823
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Ewell.

363
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,997
What kind of man are you?

364
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,583
You've got children
of your own.

365
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,882
Hey, Jem.

366
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,467
Jem?

367
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,731
I think we ought to stay right
here in Miss Stephanie's yard.

368
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:04,067
You don't have to come
along, Angel Mae.

369
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,208
What are you going to do?

370
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,880
We're going to look in the
window at the Radley house

371
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,424
and see if we can get
a look at Boo Radley.

372
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,426
Come on, Dill.

373
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,557
Jem, please,
I'm scared.

374
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,059
Then go home
if you're scared!

375
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,519
I swear, Scout, you act more
like a girl all the time.

376
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,646
Come on, Dill.

377
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,730
Wait for me.
I'm coming.

378
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:42,898
Shh.

379
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,656
We'll go around back,

380
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,325
crawl under the high wire fence
at the rear of the Radley lot.

381
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,453
I don't believe we can
be seen from there.

382
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,789
Shh.

383
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,466
Come on.

384
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,690
Come on.

385
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:28,985
Come on.

386
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,033
Come on, help me.

387
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,123
Shh.

388
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,386
Don't make a sound.

389
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,312
Spit on it.

390
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:09,693
All right.

391
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:16,867
- Jem...
- Shh.

392
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,493
Spit some more.

393
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:24,750
All right.

394
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,648
Come on.

395
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,638
Hurry.

396
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,975
Hurry.

397
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:59,821
Scout.

398
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,657
Scout.

399
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,312
Quick.
Come over here.

400
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,445
Shh. Shh. Quiet.

401
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,744
What are you going
to do for pants, Jem?

402
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,245
I don't know.

403
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,833
Dill?

404
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,127
Dill!

405
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,879
You come on in, now.

406
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,090
Shh.

407
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,800
I'd better go.

408
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,009
Dill?

409
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,970
Coming, Aunt Stephanie.

410
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,348
So long.
I'll see you next summer.

411
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,891
- So long.
- So long.

412
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:11,977
Dill?

413
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,144
I'm coming.

414
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,064
I'm going back
after my pants.

415
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,108
Please, Jem,
come on in the house.

416
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,068
I can't go in
without my pants.

417
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,529
Then I'm going
to call Atticus.

418
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,989
No, you're not.

419
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:27,242
Now, listen. Atticus ain't never
whipped me since I can remember

420
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,327
and I plan to
keep it that way.

421
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,454
Then I'm going with you.

422
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,580
You ain't.

423
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:36,084
You stay right here.
I'll be back before you can count to 10.

424
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,630
Jem.

425
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,264
One, two,

426
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,101
three, four...

427
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,311
Jem.

428
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:59,107
Scout. Come on in.

429
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:05,780
Five, six, seven,

430
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:11,411
eight, nine, ten,

431
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:17,125
eleven, twelve,

432
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:21,087
thirteen, fourteen.

433
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,722
Jem.

434
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,848
Shh.

435
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,351
Shh.

436
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,318
What was that?

437
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:48,156
What is it? What happened?

438
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,159
What's going on?
What is it?

439
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,495
Atticus, what is it?

440
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:57,499
Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

441
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:03,755
Mr. Radley shot at a prowler
out in his collard patch.

442
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,673
A prowler? Oh, Maudie!

443
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,426
Whoever it was won't
be back anytime soon.

444
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,762
Mr. Radley must've scared
them out of their wits.

445
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,180
- Good night.
- Good night.

446
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,431
Good night, Atticus.

447
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,475
Scared the living
daylights out of me.

448
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:18,645
I swear, a prowler.
He said a prowler.

449
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,192
Come on, now.
The excitement is over. Time for bed.

450
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,821
Scout, Jem.

451
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,675
Morning.

452
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,344
Good morning, Miss Maudie.

453
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:52,512
Morning, Calpurnia.

454
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,890
I came to see Jean Louise ready
for her first day at school.

455
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,392
- Scout.
- Morning, Mrs. Maudie.

456
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,893
- All ready for school?
- Yes, ma'am.

457
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,228
Scout!

458
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,856
What are you going to do
with yourself this morning

459
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,732
with both children
at school?

460
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,485
I don't know,
and that's the truth.

461
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,779
I was thinking
about that just now.

462
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:11,906
Scout?

463
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,244
Scout? Scout!

464
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,623
Did you hear me, Scout?
Now, hurry.

465
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,845
Hey, everybody,
look at Scout.

466
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:34,929
Shh.

467
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,478
Come on in here, Scout.

468
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,317
Have your breakfast.

469
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,995
I think your dress is
mighty becoming, honey.

470
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,789
Now don't go
tugging at that dress, Scout.

471
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:05,084
You want to have it all wrinkled
before you even get to school?

472
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:10,506
I still don't see why I have
to wear a darn old dress.

473
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,008
You'll get used to it.

474
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,843
- I'm ready.
- Oh, Jem.

475
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,803
Jem...

476
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,432
It's half an hour
before school starts.

477
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,686
Sit back down and
wait for your sister.

478
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,275
Well, hurry up, Scout.

479
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,361
I'm trying to.

480
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,448
Come on. It's your first day.
You want to be late?

481
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,536
- I'm ready.
- Come on, let's go.

482
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,459
Bye.

483
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,005
Bye, bye.

484
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:07,939
Darn you,
Walter Cunningham!

485
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,698
Come on, Walter!

486
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:22,161
Cut that out!
What do you think you're doing?

487
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,334
He made me start off
on the wrong foot!

488
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,878
I was trying to explain
to that darn lady teacher

489
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:35,008
why he didn't have no money for
his lunch and she got sore at me.

490
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:39,846
Stop it! Stop it!

491
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,356
Is your daddy Mr. Walter
Cunningham from Old Sarum?

492
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:56,946
Come home and have dinner with us, Walter.
We'd be glad to have you.

493
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,326
Our daddy's a friend
of your daddy's.

494
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,998
Scout here is crazy.
She won't fight you no more.

495
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,129
I hope that's
a dinner that you enjoy.

496
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,425
Yes, sir. I don't know
when I've had a roast.

497
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,679
We've been having squirrels
and rabbits lately.

498
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,851
My pa and I go hunting
in our spare time.

499
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,728
You've got a gun
of your own?

500
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,313
Uh-huh.

501
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,231
How long have you had a gun?

502
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:33,775
A year or so.

503
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,363
Can I have the syrup,
please?

504
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,572
Certainly, son.

505
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,117
Cal. Will you bring in
the syrup dish, please?

506
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,452
Yes, sir.

507
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,789
How old were you when you got
your first gun, Atticus?

508
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,208
Thirteen or fourteen.

509
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,963
I remember when my daddy
gave me that gun.

510
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:00,551
He told me that I should never
point at anything in the house.

511
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,722
And that he'd rather I'd shoot
at tin cans in the backyard.

512
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,601
But he said that sooner or later
he'd suppose the temptation

513
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,895
to go after birds
would be too much.

514
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:16,859
That I could shoot all the blue
jays I wanted if I could hit them.

515
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:21,322
But to remember it was a sin
to kill a mockingbird.

516
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,157
Why?

517
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,369
I reckon because mockingbirds

518
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:30,081
don't do anything but
make music for us to enjoy.

519
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:36,587
They don't eat people's gardens,
don't nest in the corncribs.

520
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:41,384
They don't do one thing, but just
sing their hearts out for us.

521
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,013
How did you like school,
Scout?

522
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,182
All right.

523
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,686
Thank you, Cal.
That's for Walter.

524
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,711
What in the Sam Hill are you doing...

525
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,256
But, Atticus, he's gone and
drowned his dinner in syrup

526
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,884
and now he's pouring it
all over.

527
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,802
Scout.

528
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:25,970
What?

529
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,889
Come out here.
I want to talk to you.

530
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,691
That boy is your company

531
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:42,069
and if he wants to eat up that
tablecloth, you'll let him, you hear?

532
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:44,822
And if you can't act
fit to eat like folks,

533
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,074
you can just sit here
and eat in the kitchen.

534
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,579
Scout.

535
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:58,419
Scout.

536
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,428
Scout, what in the world
has got into you?

537
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,305
Not going back.

538
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,431
Now, now.

539
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:11,849
Not going back.

540
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,355
Atticus, I'm not going
back to school anymore.

541
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,732
Scout,
it's just the first day.

542
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,360
I don't care.
Everything went wrong.

543
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,863
My teacher got mad
as the devil at me

544
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:29,951
and said you were teaching me to
read all wrong, and to stop it.

545
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,036
Then acted like a fool

546
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,372
and tried to give
Walter Cunningham a quarter

547
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:38,376
when everybody knows Cunninghams
won't take nothing from nobody.

548
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,295
Any fool could have
told her that.

549
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,630
Well...

550
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,131
Maybe she's just nervous.

551
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:46,133
After all,
it's her first day, too,

552
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,052
teaching school
and being new here.

553
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,220
Oh, Atticus.

554
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,305
Now, wait a minute.

555
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,894
If you just learn
a single trick, Scout,

556
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,647
you'll get along a lot better
with all kinds of folks.

557
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,233
You never really
understand a person

558
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:05,236
until you consider things
from his point of view.

559
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:06,612
Sir?

560
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:11,117
Until you climb inside of his
skin and walk around in it.

561
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,580
But if I keep going to school,
we can't ever read anymore.

562
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,377
Scout?

563
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,131
Do you know what
a compromise is?

564
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:28,676
Bending the law?

565
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,221
Uh...

566
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:37,018
No. It's an agreement
reached by mutual consent.

567
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,897
Here is the way it works.

568
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:48,654
You concede the necessity
of going to school

569
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:53,367
and we'll keep right on
reading the same every night,

570
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:56,162
just as we always have.

571
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,166
Is that a bargain?

572
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:00,833
Is that a bargain?

573
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:07,882
There just didn't
seem to be anyone or anything

574
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,051
Atticus couldn't explain.

575
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,637
Though it wasn't a talent
that would arouse

576
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,597
the admiration of
any of our friends,

577
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,433
Jem and I had to admit
he was very good at that.

578
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:21,687
But that was all he was
good at, we thought.

579
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,732
See, there he is!

580
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,912
Scout, Jem,
come on inside.

581
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,956
Come on, get in.

582
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,801
Mr. Finch? This is Cal.

583
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:54,845
I swear to God, there's a mad
dog down the street apiece.

584
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,263
He's coming this way.

585
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,065
There he is.

586
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,154
He's got it all right,
Mr. Finch.

587
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,160
Stay inside, Son.
Keep him in there, Cal.

588
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,789
He's within range, Heck.

589
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,209
Take him, Mr. Finch.

590
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,545
No, Mr. Tate.
He can't shoot.

591
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:28,671
Don't waste time.

592
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,172
For God's sake,
Mr. Finch,

593
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:32,383
he's got to be killed right
away, before he starts running.

594
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,386
Look where he is.
I can't shoot that well. You know it.

595
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,179
I haven't
shot a gun in years.

596
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:39,432
I'd feel mighty comfortable
if you did now.

597
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,196
Don't go near that dog,
do you understand?

598
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:36,947
He's just as dangerous
dead as alive.

599
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,240
Yes, sir.

600
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,452
Atticus?

601
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,828
Yes, Son.

602
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,374
Nothing.

603
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,835
What's the matter, boy?
Can't you talk?

604
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,755
Didn't you know your daddy is
the best shot in this county?

605
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:55,549
Hush, Heck.
Let's get back to town.

606
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,843
Remember,
don't go near that dog.

607
00:43:57,928 --> 00:43:59,178
Yes, sir.

608
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,765
I'll send Zeebo out
right away to pick him up.

609
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,287
Hey, Atticus.
Can we go with you?

610
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:27,998
Can we, please?

611
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,124
Can we?

612
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:32,503
No. I have to go to the country on
business, and you'll just get tired.

613
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,922
No, not me.
I won't get tired.

614
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:39,218
Promise to stay in the car while I
go in and talk to Helen Robinson?

615
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,344
Mmm-hmm.

616
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,138
And not nag me about leaving
if you do get tired?

617
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:44,932
All right, climb in.

618
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,401
Who's Helen Robinson?

619
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,278
She's the wife of
the man I'm defending.

620
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:18,632
Good evening, David.

621
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:19,800
Evening.

622
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:21,343
Evening, Helen.

623
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:22,720
Evening, Mr. Finch.

624
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,055
I came over to tell you
about my visit with Tom.

625
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,765
- Yes, sir.
- And to let you know

626
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,976
that I got a postponement
of the trial.

627
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,687
Give things a chance
to cool down.

628
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:05,679
Would you tell my daddy
to come out here, please?

629
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,231
You nigger lover.

630
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:19,086
No need to be afraid of him,
Son. He's all bluff.

631
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,477
Nigger lover!

632
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:51,326
There's a lot of ugly
things in this world, Son.

633
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,913
I wish I could keep
them all away from you.

634
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,460
That's never possible.

635
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:05,632
Cal, you wait until I get Scout in bed.
I'll drive you home.

636
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:06,800
Yes, sir.

637
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:25,486
Jem, would you mind staying here
with Scout till I get Cal home?

638
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,612
No, sir.

639
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,280
Night, Jem.

640
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,656
Night, Cal.

641
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:20,124
Atticus! Atticus!

642
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:22,626
Atticus!

643
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:04,311
Atticus had
promised me he would wear me out

644
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,480
if he ever heard of
me fighting anymore.

645
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:10,609
I was far too old and too big
for such childish things

646
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,028
and the sooner
I learned to hold in,

647
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,572
the better off
everybody would be.

648
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,366
I soon forgot.

649
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:21,536
Cecil Jacobs made me forget.

650
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,625
What is it, Scout?

651
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:34,132
Atticus,
do you defend niggers?

652
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,845
Don't say "nigger," Scout.

653
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,264
I didn't say it.

654
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:43,642
Cecil Jacobs did.
That's why I had to fight him.

655
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:47,104
Scout,
I don't want you fighting.

656
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,564
I had to, Atticus, he...

657
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:51,608
I don't care what
the reasons are.

658
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:54,194
I forbid you to fight.

659
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,530
Yes, sir.

660
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:07,207
Anyway, I'm simply defending
a Negro, Tom Robinson.

661
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,252
Scout,

662
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:15,007
there are some things that you're not
old enough to understand just yet.

663
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:22,347
There's been some
high talk around town

664
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:25,600
to the effect that I shouldn't do
much about defending this man.

665
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:32,733
If you shouldn't be defending
him, then why are you doing it?

666
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:40,282
For a number of reasons.

667
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,162
The main one is
that if I didn't,

668
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:47,664
I couldn't hold
my head up in town.

669
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:53,754
I couldn't even tell you or Jem
not to do something again.

670
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,884
Oh, Scout.

671
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,349
You're going to hear some ugly
talk about this in school.

672
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,020
But I want you to
promise me one thing,

673
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:14,024
that you won't get
into fights over it,

674
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,735
no matter what
they say to you.

675
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,701
Yes, sir.

676
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:40,550
What're you doing?

677
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,470
I'm walking
like an Egyptian.

678
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,514
We were studying
about them in school.

679
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:48,600
Teacher says we wouldn't
be no place without them.

680
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:49,810
Is that so?

681
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:54,356
Cradle of civilization.
They invented embalming and toilet paper.

682
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,403
That's wrong, Scout.

683
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,117
You dig your feet,
this way.

684
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,119
Look, Jem.

685
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:27,055
Look, the boy wore his hair in
front of his eyebrows like you do.

686
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,600
And the girl
wears bangs like you.

687
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,602
These are us.

688
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,410
Jem, are you awake?

689
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:31,828
Go back to bed.

690
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:33,580
I can't go to sleep.

691
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,665
Go back to bed.

692
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:39,127
What you got in the box?

693
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:40,754
Nothing. Go back to bed.

694
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,096
Come on.

695
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:01,775
If I show you, will you swear
never to tell anybody?

696
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,069
I swear.

697
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:06,571
Cross your heart.

698
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,886
I found all of these

699
00:56:30,263 --> 00:56:33,473
in the knothole of that old
tree at different times.

700
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,310
This is a spelling medal.

701
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:44,067
They used to award these in
school to spelling winners

702
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,402
before we were born.

703
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,782
And another time
I found this.

704
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,256
And this.

705
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,397
And Scout...

706
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:26,401
Something else
I never told you about

707
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,528
that night I went back
to the Radley house.

708
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:32,282
Something else? You never told
me anything about that night.

709
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:34,868
Well...

710
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,496
You know the first time I was
getting out of my britches?

711
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:39,789
Uh-huh.

712
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:43,710
They was all in a tangle,
and I couldn't get them loose.

713
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:46,880
Well,

714
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,882
when I went back though,

715
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,885
they were folded
across the fence,

716
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,388
sort of like they
was expecting me.

717
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:05,357
It was to be a long time

718
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:09,152
before Jem and I
talked about Boo again.

719
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:15,533
School finally ended
and summer came

720
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:17,494
and so did Dill.

721
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:18,536
Good morning.

722
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:19,829
Good morning.

723
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,998
My, you're up
mighty bright and early.

724
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,501
I've been up since 4:00.

725
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:26,336
4:00?

726
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,673
Yes. I always get up at 4:00.
It's in my blood.

727
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:33,927
You see, my daddy was a
railroad man until he got rich.

728
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,762
Now he flies airplanes.

729
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,516
One of these days, he's just going
to swoop down here at Maycomb,

730
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,768
pick me up,
and take me for a ride.

731
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,530
Who's that in the car
with Sheriff Tate?

732
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,281
Tom Robinson, Son.

733
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,076
Where's he been?

734
00:58:58,202 --> 00:58:59,786
In the Abbotsville jail.

735
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,164
Why?

736
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:05,625
The sheriff thought
he'd be safer there.

737
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,461
They're bringing him
back here tonight,

738
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:10,797
because his trial
is tomorrow.

739
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,816
Good evening, Heck.

740
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,443
Evening, Mr. Finch.

741
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:33,737
Come in.

742
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,744
The news has gotten
around the county

743
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:43,163
about my bringing Tom
Robinson back to the jail.

744
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:48,168
I heard there might be trouble
from that bunch out at Old Sarum.

745
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:01,389
Cal, if I need you to stay
here tonight, can you do it?

746
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:03,183
Yes, sir, I can.

747
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,559
Thank you.

748
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,151
I think you'd better
count on staying.

749
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:15,570
Yes, sir.

750
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,189
What's going on?

751
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,607
Shh. Go back to sleep.

752
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,108
What's going on?

753
01:00:54,193 --> 01:00:55,235
Shh.

754
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,412
Hey, there's his car.

755
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,095
See, there he is,
over there.

756
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:28,810
No, Scout, don't go to him.
He might not like it.

757
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:33,982
I just wanted to see where he
was and what he was up to.

758
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:38,486
He's all right.
Let's go back home. Come on.

759
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,713
He in there, Mr. Finch?

760
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:43,885
He is. He's asleep.
Don't wake him.

761
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,721
You know what we want.

762
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,143
Get aside from that door,
Mr. Finch.

763
01:02:55,064 --> 01:02:56,189
Walter,

764
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:02,153
I think you ought to turn right
around and go back home.

765
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,489
Heck Tate's
around here somewhere.

766
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,157
No, he ain't.

767
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,410
Heck and his bunch is out chasing
around Old Sarum looking for us.

768
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,038
We knew he was
so we came in this other way.

769
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:14,832
You ain't never thought
about that, had you, Mr. Finch?

770
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,125
I thought about it.

771
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,752
I can't see Atticus.

772
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,047
That changes things...

773
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,548
Atticus!

774
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:27,887
Hey, Atticus.

775
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,557
Jem, go home, and take Scout
and Dill home with you.

776
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,395
Son, I said, go home.

777
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:37,563
No, sir.

778
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,316
I'll send him home!

779
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:43,695
Don't you touch him.
Let him go!

780
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:45,238
That'll do, Scout.

781
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,910
Ain't nobody gonna
do Jem that way.

782
01:03:53,122 --> 01:03:55,289
Now, you get them
out of here, Mr. Finch!

783
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:01,129
Jem, I want you
to please leave.

784
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:03,923
- No, sir.
- Jem.

785
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:06,592
I tell you,
I ain't going.

786
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:10,221
Hey, Mr. Cunningham.

787
01:04:13,142 --> 01:04:15,018
I said, hey,
Mr. Cunningham.

788
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:16,936
How's your entailment
getting along?

789
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,984
Don't you remember me,
Mr. Cunningham?

790
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:26,279
I'm Jean Louise Finch.

791
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:32,660
You brought us some hickory nuts
one early morning, remember?

792
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,329
We had a talk.

793
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,584
I went and got my daddy
to come out and thank you.

794
01:04:41,128 --> 01:04:44,797
I go to school with your boy.
I go to school with Walter.

795
01:04:45,424 --> 01:04:49,427
He's a nice boy.
Tell him "hey" for me, won't you?

796
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,056
You know something,
Mr. Cunningham?

797
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:55,641
Entailments are bad.
Entailments...

798
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:09,655
Atticus, I was just saying to Mr
. Cunningham that entailments were bad

799
01:05:09,782 --> 01:05:14,035
but not to worry.
Takes a long time sometimes.

800
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:18,039
What's the matter?

801
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,341
I sure meant no harm,
Mr. Cunningham.

802
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,348
No harm taken, young lady.

803
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:41,395
I'll tell Walter
you said "hey."

804
01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:43,898
Let's clear out of here.

805
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,860
Let's go, boys.

806
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,765
Now, you go home.
All of you.

807
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:20,726
I'll be there later.

808
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:24,355
Good luck.

809
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,066
Come on.

810
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:55,553
Mr. Finch, are they gone?

811
01:06:57,222 --> 01:07:00,266
They've gone.
They won't bother you anymore.

812
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,456
Morning, Mr. Sykes.

813
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,250
- How do you do?
- Ever see so many people?

814
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:28,419
Just like on Saturday.

815
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:32,798
Where you going?

816
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:36,469
I can't stand it any longer. I'm going
downtown to the courthouse to watch.

817
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:38,888
You'd better not.
You know what Atticus said.

818
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,306
I don't care if he did.

819
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,225
I'm not going to miss
the most exciting thing

820
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,101
that ever happened
in this town.

821
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:06,666
It's packed solid.
They're standing all along the back.

822
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:10,419
Reverend.

823
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:11,587
Yes?

824
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:14,173
Reverend Sykes,
are you going upstairs?

825
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:15,508
Yes, I am.

826
01:08:25,978 --> 01:08:27,436
Thanks, Brother Jones,
for holding my seat.

827
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:28,938
Please be seated.

828
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,398
Come on, children.

829
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:31,816
It's the Rev.

830
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:08,519
This court is now in session.
Everybody rise.

831
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:23,367
On the night of August 21,

832
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:26,871
I was just leaving my office
to go home when Bob...

833
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,707
Mr. Ewell came in.

834
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:35,504
Very excited, he was, and he said to
get to his house as quick as I could,

835
01:09:36,048 --> 01:09:37,590
that his girl
had been raped.

836
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:41,552
I got to my car and went out
there as fast as I could.

837
01:09:43,055 --> 01:09:44,597
She was pretty well
beat up.

838
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:49,560
I asked her if Tom Robinson
beat her like that.

839
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:51,937
She said, "Yes, he had."

840
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:56,025
I asked if he'd
taken advantage of her.

841
01:09:57,069 --> 01:09:58,569
She said, "Yes, he did."

842
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:01,906
That's all there was to it.

843
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:05,576
Thank you.

844
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,415
Did anybody
call a doctor, Sheriff?

845
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,043
- No, sir.
- Why not?

846
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:17,380
I didn't think
it was necessary.

847
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:21,801
She was pretty well beat up.
Something sure happened, it was obvious.

848
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,264
Sheriff, you say she
was mighty beat up.

849
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,600
In what way?

850
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,644
She was beaten
around the head.

851
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:35,439
There were bruises
already coming on her arms.

852
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,775
She had a black eye
starting.

853
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:39,944
Which eye?

854
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:43,489
Let's see,
it was her left.

855
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:47,118
Now, was that...

856
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:52,915
Was that her left, facing you, or
looking the way that you were?

857
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,461
Yes, that would make it
her right eye.

858
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:01,799
It was her right eye,
Mr. Finch. Now I remember.

859
01:11:02,134 --> 01:11:05,469
She was beaten up on
that side of her face.

860
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:12,643
Which side, again?

861
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:15,020
Her right side.

862
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:18,607
She had bruises
on her arms.

863
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:22,278
And she showed me
her neck.

864
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:25,156
There were definite finger
marks on her gullet.

865
01:11:28,994 --> 01:11:30,703
All around

866
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,290
her neck, at the
back of her throat?

867
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:38,169
I'd say they were
all around.

868
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,053
The witness may be seated.

869
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:52,475
Robert E. Lee Ewell.

870
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,148
Place your hand
on the Bible, please.

871
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:00,983
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

872
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,818
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

873
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:04,361
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

874
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,825
Now, Mr. Ewell,

875
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:14,914
will you tell us, just in your own
words, what happened on August 21?

876
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:17,750
Late that night,

877
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:21,003
I was coming in from the woods,
with a load of kindling

878
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,923
and I heard Mayella screaming
as I got to the fence.

879
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:27,301
So, I dropped my kindling and
run just as fast as I could,

880
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:28,928
but I run into the fence.

881
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:31,555
But when I got loose,

882
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:36,227
I run up to the window, and
I seen him with my Mayella.

883
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:45,361
What did you do after
you saw the defendant?

884
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:47,780
I ran around the house
trying to get in,

885
01:12:47,906 --> 01:12:50,783
but he done run through the
front door, just ahead of me.

886
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,285
But I seen who it was,
all right.

887
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,621
I seen him!

888
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,126
And I run in the house

889
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,130
and poor Mayella was lying
on the floor, squalling.

890
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:09,093
Then I run for Mr. Tate
as quick as I could.

891
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,303
Mmm-hmm.

892
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:13,931
Thank you, Mr. Ewell.

893
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:27,653
Would you mind if I just ask you
a few questions, Mr. Ewell?

894
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:30,281
No, sir, Mr. Finch,
I sure wouldn't.

895
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,497
Folks were doing a lot
of running that night.

896
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:39,748
Let's see, now.

897
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:43,168
You say that you ran into the
house, you ran to the window,

898
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:47,506
you ran inside, you ran to Mayella,
and you ran to Sheriff Tate.

899
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:52,177
Did you, during all this
running, run for a doctor?

900
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:54,680
There wasn't no need to.
I seen who done it.

901
01:13:57,684 --> 01:14:01,353
Now, Mr. Ewell, you've heard
the sheriff's testimony.

902
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:04,273
Do you agree with his description
of Mayella's injuries?

903
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:07,359
I agree with everything
Mr. Tate said.

904
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:12,781
Her eye was blacked.
She was mighty beat up.

905
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:18,871
Mr. Ewell, can you...

906
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,707
Can you read and write?

907
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,712
Yes, Mr. Finch.
I can read and I can write.

908
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:30,549
Good.

909
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,887
Then will you write
your name, please?

910
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,640
Right there. Show us.

911
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:10,714
Now what's
so interesting?

912
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,425
You're left-handed,
Mr. Ewell.

913
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:17,596
What's that got to do with it, Judge?
I'm a God-fearing man.

914
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:20,432
That Atticus Finch, he's trying
to take advantage of me.

915
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:23,018
You've got to watch tricky
lawyers like Atticus Finch.

916
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,187
Quiet, sir.

917
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:27,940
The witness may
take his seat.

918
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:40,953
Mayella Violet Ewell.

919
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,134
Put your hand on
the Bible, please.

920
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,596
Solemnly swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

921
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:01,807
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

922
01:16:02,142 --> 01:16:03,475
Sit down, please.

923
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,314
Now, Mayella,

924
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:15,154
suppose you tell us
just what happened, huh?

925
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,824
Well, sir...

926
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:21,660
Sir,

927
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:27,583
I was sitting on the porch
and he come along.

928
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:33,505
There was this old
chifforobe in the yard

929
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,301
and I said,

930
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:42,306
"You come in here, boy, and bust up this
chifforobe and I'll give you a nickel."

931
01:16:44,184 --> 01:16:46,477
So, he come on in the yard

932
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,354
and I go in the house
to get him the nickel.

933
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:54,359
And I turn around, and
before I know it he's on me.

934
01:16:56,362 --> 01:17:00,449
I fought and hollered,
but he had me around the neck

935
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,869
and he hit me
again and again.

936
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:09,374
And the next thing I knew,

937
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:12,878
Papa was in the room,
standing over me, hollering,

938
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,799
"Who done it?"

939
01:17:18,218 --> 01:17:19,718
Thank you, Mayella.

940
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:23,222
Your witness, Atticus.

941
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:29,019
Miss Mayella,

942
01:17:29,896 --> 01:17:32,731
is your father good to you?

943
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:37,236
I mean, is he easy
to get along with?

944
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:40,697
Does tolerable.

945
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:42,366
Except when
he's drinking?

946
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:48,747
When he's riled,
has he ever beaten you?

947
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:58,924
My pa's never touched a
hair on my head in my life.

948
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:07,599
You say that you asked Tom
to come in and chop up a...

949
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:09,560
What was it?

950
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:12,437
A chifforobe.

951
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:18,110
Was that the first time that you ever
asked him to come inside the fence?

952
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:19,611
Yes.

953
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:25,534
Didn't you ever ask him to
come inside the fence before?

954
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:31,748
I might have.

955
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,878
But can you remember
any other occasion?

956
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:37,129
No.

957
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:40,048
You say,

958
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,886
"He caught me,
he choked me,

959
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:46,179
"and took advantage of me,"
is that right?

960
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,145
Do you remember him
beating you about the face?

961
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:58,317
No, I don't

962
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,237
recollect if he hit me.

963
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:11,830
I mean, yes, he hit me!

964
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,421
Thank you.

965
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,549
Will you identify
the man who beat you?

966
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,552
Most certainly will.
Sitting right yonder.

967
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:29,848
Tom, will you
stand up, please?

968
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,894
Let Miss Mayella have a
good, long look at you.

969
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:46,031
Tom, will you catch this,
please?

970
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:52,579
Thank you.

971
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,793
Now, then, this time,

972
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,878
will you please catch
it with your left hand?

973
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:01,964
I can't, sir.

974
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:03,548
Why can't you?

975
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:06,259
I can't use my
left hand at all.

976
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:10,555
I got it caught in a cotton
gin when I was 12 years old.

977
01:20:11,391 --> 01:20:13,392
All my muscles
were tore loose.

978
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:33,787
Is this the man
who raped you?

979
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:36,915
Most certainly is.

980
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:39,835
How?

981
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,965
I don't know how.

982
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:48,719
He just done it.

983
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:53,724
You have testified
that he choked you

984
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,435
and he beat you.

985
01:20:57,562 --> 01:21:01,898
You didn't say that he sneaked up
behind you and knocked you out cold,

986
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:05,110
but that you turned around

987
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,779
and there he was.

988
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:12,617
Do you want to tell us
what really happened?

989
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,622
I've got something to say!

990
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:22,294
And then I ain't
gonna say no more!

991
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:28,592
He took advantage of me.

992
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:36,933
And if you fine,
fancy gentlemen

993
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:39,478
ain't going to do
nothing about it,

994
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:44,483
then you're just a bunch of lousy,
yellow, stinking cowards!

995
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,152
The whole bunch of you!

996
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,238
And your fancy airs
don't come to nothing!

997
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:53,533
Your "ma'am-ing"
and your "Miss Mayella-ing,"

998
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:56,453
it don't come to nothing,
Mr. Finch!

999
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:02,918
Sit down, there.

1000
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:04,044
Poor girl.

1001
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,687
Atticus?

1002
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:27,943
Mr. Gilmer?

1003
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:33,949
The State rests, Judge.

1004
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,584
Tom Robinson, take the stand.

1005
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:02,018
Put your hand on the Bible.

1006
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:04,980
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

1007
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:06,731
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1008
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:08,191
- I do.
- Sit down.

1009
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,205
Now, Tom...

1010
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:26,459
Were you acquainted
with Mayella Violet Ewell?

1011
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:28,044
Yes, sir.

1012
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:31,506
I had to pass her place going to
and from the field every day.

1013
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,676
Is there any other way
to go?

1014
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:37,888
No, sir,
none as I know of.

1015
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,974
And did she ever
speak to you?

1016
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,601
Yes, sir.

1017
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:45,896
I'd tip my hat
when I'd go by.

1018
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:51,193
One day she asked me
to come inside the fence,

1019
01:23:51,444 --> 01:23:53,111
bust up a chifforobe
for her.

1020
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:56,615
She gave me the hatchet
and I broke it up.

1021
01:23:57,366 --> 01:24:01,411
And then she said, "I reckon I'll
have to give you a nickel, won't I?"

1022
01:24:01,621 --> 01:24:04,080
And I said, "No, ma'am,
there ain't no charge."

1023
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:06,750
Then I went home.

1024
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:13,465
Mr. Finch, that was way last
spring, way over a year ago.

1025
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:16,593
And did you ever go
on the place again?

1026
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:21,097
Yes, sir.

1027
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:23,308
When?

1028
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:29,231
I went lots of times.

1029
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,859
Seemed like every time
I passed by yonder,

1030
01:24:32,944 --> 01:24:35,445
she'd have some little
something for me to do.

1031
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,281
Chopping kindling and
toting water for her.

1032
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:47,916
Tom,

1033
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:55,215
what happened to you on the evening
of August 21 of last year?

1034
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:04,849
Mr. Finch,

1035
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:08,728
I was going home as
usual that evening.

1036
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,275
When I passed
the Ewell place,

1037
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:17,320
Miss Mayella was on the porch,
like she said she was.

1038
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,574
She said for me to come there
and help her a minute.

1039
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:25,120
I went inside the fence

1040
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:28,581
and I looked around for
some kindling to work on,

1041
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,709
but I didn't see nothing.

1042
01:25:32,545 --> 01:25:35,297
And then she said
to come in the house,

1043
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:37,674
she has a door
that needs fixing.

1044
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:42,470
So I follows her inside
and looked at the door

1045
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:44,556
and it looked all right.

1046
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:48,184
Then she shut the door.

1047
01:25:50,146 --> 01:25:54,107
All the time I was wondering
why it was so quiet like.

1048
01:25:56,444 --> 01:26:00,905
Then it come to me, there was
not a child on the place.

1049
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:07,037
And I said, "Miss Mayella,
where are the children?"

1050
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:11,291
And she said they all
gone to get ice cream.

1051
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:15,128
She said it took her a slap
year to save seven nickels,

1052
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:18,465
but she done it,
and they all gone to town.

1053
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:22,719
What did you say then?

1054
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:27,265
I said something like,

1055
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:32,354
"Why, Miss Mayella, it's right
nice of you to treat them."

1056
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:35,148
And she said,
"You think so?"

1057
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:40,904
Well, I said I best be going,
I couldn't do nothing for her.

1058
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:43,239
And she said,
oh, yes, I could.

1059
01:26:44,075 --> 01:26:45,492
And I asked her, "What?"

1060
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:51,081
And she said to just step
on the chair yonder

1061
01:26:51,332 --> 01:26:54,626
and get that box down
from on top of the chifforobe.

1062
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:59,881
So I done like she told me

1063
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:02,217
and I was reaching

1064
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,470
and the next thing I know,

1065
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:09,182
she grabbed me
around the legs.

1066
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:19,609
She scared me so bad, I hopped
down and turned the chair over.

1067
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:21,444
That was the only thing,

1068
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,781
the only furniture
disturbed in the room,

1069
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:26,991
Mr. Finch, I swear,
when I left it.

1070
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:33,540
And what happened after you
turned the chair over?

1071
01:27:40,214 --> 01:27:41,339
Tom?

1072
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:50,265
You've sworn to tell
the whole truth.

1073
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:52,934
Will you do it?

1074
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:57,981
What happened after that?

1075
01:28:03,112 --> 01:28:04,446
Mr. Finch,

1076
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:10,535
I got down off the chair
and I turned around

1077
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:14,789
and she sort of jumped on me.

1078
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:18,626
She hugged me
around the waist.

1079
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:22,130
She reached up and
kissed me on the face.

1080
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:27,886
She said she had never kissed
a grown man before

1081
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,847
and she might as well kiss me.

1082
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:34,684
She said for me
to kiss her back.

1083
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:40,440
And I said, "Miss Mayella,
let me out of here."

1084
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,150
And I tried to run.

1085
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:48,281
Then Mr. Ewell cussed
at her from the window

1086
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:51,910
and said he's going
to kill her.

1087
01:29:01,045 --> 01:29:02,795
What happened after that?

1088
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:10,678
I was running so fast,
I don't know what happened.

1089
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,774
Tom, did you rape
Mayella Ewell?

1090
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:28,613
I did not, sir.

1091
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,492
Did you harm her
in any way?

1092
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:41,709
I did not, sir.

1093
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,147
Robinson,

1094
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:07,735
you're pretty good at
busting up chifforobes

1095
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,737
and kindling with
one hand, aren't you?

1096
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:12,240
Strong enough to choke the
breath out of a woman

1097
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,200
and sling her to the floor?

1098
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,411
I've never
done that, sir.

1099
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:18,496
But you're strong
enough to?

1100
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:21,541
I reckon so, sir.

1101
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,042
Mmm-hmm.

1102
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:32,427
How come you were so all-fired
anxious to do that woman's chores?

1103
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:40,018
Looks like she didn't have
nobody to help her.

1104
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:42,270
Like I said...

1105
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:45,106
With Mr. Ewell and seven
children on the place?

1106
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:49,360
You did all this chopping and
work out of sheer goodness, boy?

1107
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,573
You're a mighty
good fellow, it seems.

1108
01:30:53,866 --> 01:30:56,200
Did all that
for not one penny.

1109
01:30:57,411 --> 01:30:58,453
Yes, sir.

1110
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:02,707
I felt right sorry for her.
She seemed...

1111
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:21,726
You felt sorry for her?

1112
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:24,479
A white woman?

1113
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,734
You felt sorry for her.

1114
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:04,435
To begin with,

1115
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:08,606
this case should never
have come to trial.

1116
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:13,194
The State has not produced
one iota of medical evidence

1117
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:16,489
that the crime
Tom Robinson is charged with

1118
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,701
ever took place.

1119
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:25,957
It has relied instead upon the
testimony of two witnesses

1120
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:30,169
whose evidence has not only been
called into serious question

1121
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:31,963
on cross-examination,

1122
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:36,467
but has been flatly
contradicted by the defendant.

1123
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:41,848
There is circumstantial
evidence to indicate

1124
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:46,394
that Mayella Ewell
was beaten savagely

1125
01:32:47,521 --> 01:32:52,024
by someone who led, almost
exclusively, with his left.

1126
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:58,906
And Tom Robinson now sits before
you, having taken the oath

1127
01:32:58,991 --> 01:33:01,659
with the only good
hand he possesses,

1128
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:04,078
his right.

1129
01:33:15,841 --> 01:33:19,177
I have nothing
but pity in my heart

1130
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:23,848
for the chief witness
for the State.

1131
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:31,856
She is the victim of cruel
poverty and ignorance.

1132
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:42,283
But my pity does
not extend so far

1133
01:33:42,785 --> 01:33:45,953
as to her putting
a man's life at stake,

1134
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:51,292
which she has done in an effort
to get rid of her own guilt.

1135
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:56,130
I say "guilt," gentlemen,

1136
01:33:56,256 --> 01:34:01,219
because it was guilt
that motivated her.

1137
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:05,056
She's committed no crime.

1138
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:12,104
She has merely broken a rigid and
time-honored code of our society.

1139
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:17,777
A code so severe, that whoever
breaks it is hounded from our midst

1140
01:34:18,195 --> 01:34:19,737
as unfit to live with.

1141
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:24,909
She must destroy the evidence
of her offense.

1142
01:34:26,787 --> 01:34:30,915
But, what was the evidence
of her offense?

1143
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:35,086
Tom Robinson,
a human being.

1144
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:41,467
She must put Tom Robinson
away from her.

1145
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:47,473
Tom Robinson was to
her a daily reminder

1146
01:34:47,933 --> 01:34:49,642
of what she did.

1147
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:52,728
What did she do?

1148
01:34:54,398 --> 01:34:58,776
She tempted a Negro.
She was white, and she tempted a Negro.

1149
01:35:00,821 --> 01:35:04,240
She did something that in
our society is unspeakable.

1150
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:07,493
She kissed a black man.

1151
01:35:08,996 --> 01:35:10,454
Not an old uncle,

1152
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:15,293
but a strong,
young Negro man.

1153
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:21,799
No code mattered to her
before she broke it.

1154
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:25,803
But it came crashing down
on her afterwards.

1155
01:35:33,854 --> 01:35:35,605
The witnesses for the State,

1156
01:35:35,689 --> 01:35:38,190
with the exception of the
sheriff of Maycomb County,

1157
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:41,319
have presented themselves to
you gentlemen, to this court,

1158
01:35:43,322 --> 01:35:46,866
in the cynical confidence

1159
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,994
that their testimony
would not be doubted,

1160
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:56,375
confident that you gentlemen
would go along with them

1161
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,127
on the assumption,

1162
01:36:00,881 --> 01:36:04,800
the evil assumption
that all Negroes lie,

1163
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:08,304
all Negroes are
basically immoral beings,

1164
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:12,725
all Negro men are not to be
trusted around our women.

1165
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:20,566
An assumption that one associates
with minds of their caliber

1166
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:26,072
and which is, in itself,
gentlemen, a lie

1167
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:32,078
which I do not need
to point out to you.

1168
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:39,752
And so,

1169
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:44,048
a quiet, humble,
respectable Negro

1170
01:36:44,758 --> 01:36:48,511
who has had
the unmitigated temerity

1171
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:51,263
to feel sorry
for a white woman

1172
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:57,395
has had to put his word
against two white people's.

1173
01:37:03,777 --> 01:37:06,404
The defendant
is not guilty,

1174
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:10,574
but somebody in
this courtroom is.

1175
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:13,953
Now, gentlemen,

1176
01:37:15,789 --> 01:37:17,373
in this country,

1177
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:21,585
our courts are
the great levelers.

1178
01:37:21,962 --> 01:37:23,462
In our courts,

1179
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:29,427
all men are created equal.

1180
01:37:31,722 --> 01:37:33,264
I'm no idealist

1181
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:36,142
to believe firmly
in the integrity

1182
01:37:36,226 --> 01:37:38,477
of our courts and
in our jury system.

1183
01:37:38,937 --> 01:37:43,107
That's no ideal to me.
That is a living, working reality.

1184
01:37:47,738 --> 01:37:52,283
I am confident that
you gentlemen will review

1185
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:56,412
without passion

1186
01:37:56,496 --> 01:37:59,290
the evidence
that you have heard,

1187
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:02,334
come to a decision

1188
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:06,505
and restore this man
to his family.

1189
01:38:17,267 --> 01:38:19,060
In the name of God,

1190
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,230
do your duty.

1191
01:38:30,614 --> 01:38:34,075
In the name of God,

1192
01:38:36,161 --> 01:38:37,620
believe Tom Robinson.

1193
01:39:13,657 --> 01:39:16,283
How long has the jury
been out now, Reverend?

1194
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:18,619
Let's see.

1195
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:21,539
Almost two hours now.

1196
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:27,711
I think that's an awful
good sign, don't you?

1197
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:16,260
Court's now in session.
Everybody rise.

1198
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:40,451
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1199
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:42,453
We have, Your Honor.

1200
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:50,461
Will the defendant please
rise and face the jury?

1201
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,304
What is your verdict?

1202
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:04,099
We find the defendant
guilty as charged.

1203
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:26,830
Gentlemen,
this jury is dismissed.

1204
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:33,504
Court's adjourned.

1205
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:48,018
I'll go to see Helen, first
thing tomorrow morning.

1206
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:51,272
I told her not to be disappointed,
we'd probably lose this one.

1207
01:41:53,108 --> 01:41:54,358
Tom.

1208
01:42:10,125 --> 01:42:11,333
Yes, Mr. Finch.

1209
01:42:56,588 --> 01:42:58,255
Miss Jean Louise?

1210
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:02,217
Stand up.

1211
01:43:06,598 --> 01:43:08,932
Your father's passing.

1212
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:38,504
Atticus.

1213
01:43:44,636 --> 01:43:46,470
I'm sorry, Atticus.

1214
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:48,138
Thank you, Maudie.

1215
01:43:57,941 --> 01:43:59,817
Atticus, can I see
you for a minute?

1216
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:04,321
Will you excuse me?

1217
01:44:29,973 --> 01:44:31,098
Jem?

1218
01:44:32,517 --> 01:44:33,642
Yes, ma'am.

1219
01:44:38,273 --> 01:44:39,982
I don't know
if it'll help,

1220
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:43,026
but I want to
say this to you.

1221
01:44:48,032 --> 01:44:49,867
There are some men
in this world

1222
01:44:51,953 --> 01:44:55,372
who were born to do
our unpleasant jobs for us.

1223
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,336
Your father's one of them.

1224
01:45:06,468 --> 01:45:07,551
Oh, well.

1225
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:35,579
What's the matter,
Atticus?

1226
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,251
Tom Robinson is dead.

1227
01:45:51,763 --> 01:45:56,767
They were taking him to
Abbotsville for safekeeping.

1228
01:45:58,269 --> 01:45:59,937
Tom broke loose and ran.

1229
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:03,774
The deputy

1230
01:46:04,943 --> 01:46:07,277
called out to him to stop.

1231
01:46:07,946 --> 01:46:09,363
Tom didn't stop.

1232
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:15,869
He shot at him to wound him
and missed his aim.

1233
01:46:19,624 --> 01:46:20,791
Killed him.

1234
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:27,464
The deputy says,

1235
01:46:31,803 --> 01:46:34,263
"Tom just ran
like a crazy man."

1236
01:46:44,566 --> 01:46:48,819
The last thing I told him was not to
lose heart, that we'd ask for an appeal.

1237
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:00,622
We had such a good chance.

1238
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:08,171
We had more
than a good chance.

1239
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:25,355
I have to go out
and tell his family.

1240
01:47:26,983 --> 01:47:29,192
Would you look after
the children, Maudie?

1241
01:47:35,116 --> 01:47:37,868
Atticus, you want me
to go with you?

1242
01:47:38,036 --> 01:47:40,829
No, Son. I think I'd
better go up there alone.

1243
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:42,998
Atticus.

1244
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,043
I'm going with you.

1245
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,172
All right, Son.

1246
01:48:13,905 --> 01:48:17,407
Hello, Mr. Finch.
I'm Spence, Tom's father.

1247
01:48:18,576 --> 01:48:20,035
Hello, Spence.

1248
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:24,081
Is Helen here?

1249
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:27,709
Yes, sir. She's inside, lying down,
trying to get a little sleep.

1250
01:48:27,919 --> 01:48:30,504
We've been talking about
the appeal, Mr. Finch.

1251
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:32,255
How long you think
it will take?

1252
01:48:35,051 --> 01:48:36,301
Spence...

1253
01:48:37,887 --> 01:48:40,222
There isn't going
to be any appeal.

1254
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:44,643
Not now. Tom is dead.

1255
01:48:45,103 --> 01:48:46,144
Dead?

1256
01:48:53,444 --> 01:48:54,736
Helen.

1257
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:26,893
Boy,

1258
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:32,482
go inside and tell Atticus
Finch I said, "Come out here."

1259
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:35,527
Go on, boy.

1260
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:16,670
By October,
things had settled down again.

1261
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:22,801
I still looked for Boo every
time I went by the Radley place.

1262
01:51:26,556 --> 01:51:30,225
This night, my mind was
filled with Halloween.

1263
01:51:30,977 --> 01:51:34,771
There was to be a pageant representing
our county's agricultural products.

1264
01:51:36,023 --> 01:51:38,024
I was to be a ham.

1265
01:51:39,861 --> 01:51:43,113
Jem said that he would escort
me to the school auditorium.

1266
01:51:44,824 --> 01:51:48,827
Thus began our
longest journey together.

1267
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:08,638
Scout?

1268
01:52:08,723 --> 01:52:10,140
Yeah?

1269
01:52:10,683 --> 01:52:14,269
Will you come on?
Everybody's gone!

1270
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,730
I can't go home
like this!

1271
01:52:17,023 --> 01:52:21,151
I'm going. It's almost 10:00 and
Atticus will be waiting for us.

1272
01:52:21,861 --> 01:52:23,862
All right, I'm coming.

1273
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:28,450
But I feel like a fool,
walking home like this.

1274
01:52:28,534 --> 01:52:30,869
It's not my fault
you lost your dress.

1275
01:52:31,037 --> 01:52:33,747
I didn't lose it.
I just can't find it.

1276
01:52:33,915 --> 01:52:35,624
Where are your shoes?

1277
01:52:35,708 --> 01:52:37,417
I can't find them, either.

1278
01:52:37,835 --> 01:52:39,210
You can get them tomorrow.

1279
01:52:39,295 --> 01:52:40,587
But tomorrow is Sunday.

1280
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:43,548
You can get the janitor
to let you in. Come on.

1281
01:53:11,452 --> 01:53:14,663
Here, Scout, let me hold on to
you before you break your neck.

1282
01:53:19,335 --> 01:53:20,877
You don't have to hold me.

1283
01:53:20,962 --> 01:53:22,045
Shh.

1284
01:53:23,965 --> 01:53:25,298
What's the matter?

1285
01:53:25,383 --> 01:53:26,716
Hush a minute, Scout.

1286
01:53:35,351 --> 01:53:37,102
I thought I heard something.

1287
01:53:40,398 --> 01:53:41,481
Ah!

1288
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:42,607
Come on.

1289
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:54,619
Wait.

1290
01:53:56,414 --> 01:53:58,164
- Are you trying to scare me?
- Shh.

1291
01:53:58,249 --> 01:53:59,332
You know I'm too old.

1292
01:53:59,417 --> 01:54:00,500
Be quiet.

1293
01:54:03,963 --> 01:54:05,755
I heard an old dog then.

1294
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,508
It's not that.
I hear it when we're walking along.

1295
01:54:09,343 --> 01:54:11,344
When we stop,
I don't hear it anymore.

1296
01:54:12,722 --> 01:54:15,140
Oh, yeah,
my costume rustling.

1297
01:54:16,267 --> 01:54:17,767
Halloween got you.

1298
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:27,027
I hear it now.

1299
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:31,239
I'll bet it's just old Cecil
Jacobs trying to scare us.

1300
01:54:32,033 --> 01:54:34,993
Cecil Jacobs
is a big wet hen!

1301
01:54:42,376 --> 01:54:43,460
Come on.

1302
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:27,879
Run, Scout! Run, Scout!
Run, run!

1303
01:57:16,488 --> 01:57:18,281
Scout! Scout!

1304
01:57:21,785 --> 01:57:23,369
What happened?

1305
01:57:23,454 --> 01:57:25,955
I swear I don't know.
I just don't know.

1306
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:30,001
Cal, you go and tell
Dr. Reynolds to come over.

1307
01:57:30,127 --> 01:57:31,127
Yes, sir.

1308
01:57:32,796 --> 01:57:33,922
You all right?

1309
01:57:34,006 --> 01:57:35,089
Yes, sir.

1310
01:57:35,174 --> 01:57:36,174
Are you sure?

1311
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:37,300
Yes, sir.

1312
01:57:45,976 --> 01:57:47,727
Sheriff Tate, please.

1313
01:57:48,312 --> 01:57:50,605
Atticus, is Jem dead?

1314
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:52,982
No, he's unconscious.

1315
01:57:53,525 --> 01:57:56,569
We won't know how badly he's
hurt until the doctor gets here.

1316
01:57:56,862 --> 01:58:01,491
Heck, Atticus Finch.
Someone's been after my children.

1317
01:58:04,745 --> 01:58:06,996
He's got a bad
break, so far as I can tell.

1318
01:58:07,498 --> 01:58:09,582
Like somebody tried
to wring his arm off.

1319
01:58:17,424 --> 01:58:19,008
I'll be right back,
Atticus.

1320
01:58:20,761 --> 01:58:22,053
How's the boy, Doc?

1321
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:23,346
He'll be all right.

1322
01:58:26,684 --> 01:58:28,184
Sheriff Tate.

1323
01:58:48,289 --> 01:58:49,372
What is it, Heck?

1324
01:58:54,295 --> 01:58:57,463
Bob Ewell's lying on the ground,
under that tree down yonder

1325
01:58:57,548 --> 01:58:59,799
with a kitchen knife
stuck up under his ribs.

1326
01:59:03,595 --> 01:59:04,929
He's dead, Mr. Finch.

1327
01:59:19,903 --> 01:59:21,738
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

1328
01:59:26,118 --> 01:59:28,578
He's not gonna bother
these children anymore.

1329
01:59:30,998 --> 01:59:33,666
Miss Scout, do you think you
could tell us what happened?

1330
01:59:35,461 --> 01:59:36,919
I don't know.

1331
01:59:37,588 --> 01:59:41,591
All of a sudden somebody grabbed
me, knocked me down on the ground.

1332
01:59:42,426 --> 01:59:43,760
Jem found me then.

1333
01:59:44,678 --> 01:59:48,973
Then Mr. Ewell, I reckon, grabbed
him again, and Jem hollered.

1334
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:53,811
Then somebody grabbed me.
Mr. Ewell, I guess.

1335
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:56,356
Somebody grabbed him.

1336
01:59:57,524 --> 02:00:00,443
Then I heard someone
panting and coughing.

1337
02:00:04,698 --> 02:00:07,033
And I saw someone
carrying Jem.

1338
02:00:07,368 --> 02:00:08,534
Who was it?

1339
02:00:13,457 --> 02:00:15,166
There he is, Mr. Tate.

1340
02:00:15,959 --> 02:00:17,627
He'll tell you his name.

1341
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:47,198
Hey, Boo.

1342
02:00:49,326 --> 02:00:53,371
Miss Jean Louise,
Mr. Arthur Radley.

1343
02:00:56,041 --> 02:00:58,376
I believe
he already knows you.

1344
02:01:08,178 --> 02:01:10,263
Heck, let's go out
on the front porch.

1345
02:01:22,693 --> 02:01:25,695
Would you like to say good
night to Jem, Mr. Arthur?

1346
02:01:49,303 --> 02:01:52,638
You can pet him, Mr. Arthur.
He's asleep.

1347
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:56,893
You couldn't if he was awake, though.
He wouldn't let you.

1348
02:02:00,564 --> 02:02:01,647
Go ahead.

1349
02:02:40,562 --> 02:02:42,647
Come sit in
the swing, Mr. Arthur.

1350
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:54,617
I guess that
the thing to do is...

1351
02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:02,500
Good Lord,
I must be losing my memory.

1352
02:03:05,254 --> 02:03:09,590
I can't remember
whether Jem is 12 or 13.

1353
02:03:13,887 --> 02:03:18,683
Anyway, it'll have to come
before the County court.

1354
02:03:22,437 --> 02:03:25,856
Of course, it is a clear-cut
case of self-defense.

1355
02:03:26,358 --> 02:03:29,694
I'll run down
to the office...

1356
02:03:29,778 --> 02:03:31,070
Mr. Finch,

1357
02:03:32,614 --> 02:03:36,033
do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell?
Is that what you think?

1358
02:03:38,912 --> 02:03:40,705
Your boy never
stabbed him.

1359
02:03:58,849 --> 02:04:00,766
Bob Ewell fell
on his knife.

1360
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:03,853
He killed himself.

1361
02:04:09,234 --> 02:04:11,402
There's a black man
dead for no reason

1362
02:04:12,237 --> 02:04:14,405
and now the man responsible
for it is dead.

1363
02:04:15,741 --> 02:04:19,118
Let the dead bury the dead
this time, Mr. Finch.

1364
02:04:19,202 --> 02:04:21,037
I never heard tell
it was against the law

1365
02:04:21,121 --> 02:04:22,872
for any citizen
to do his utmost

1366
02:04:22,956 --> 02:04:24,457
to prevent a crime
from being committed,

1367
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:26,334
which is exactly
what he did.

1368
02:04:26,627 --> 02:04:28,794
But maybe you'll tell
me that it's my duty

1369
02:04:28,879 --> 02:04:31,380
to tell the town all about
it, not to hush it up.

1370
02:04:32,257 --> 02:04:33,966
You know what
will happen then.

1371
02:04:34,718 --> 02:04:37,553
All the ladies in Maycomb,
including my wife,

1372
02:04:38,055 --> 02:04:40,765
will be knocking on his door
bringing angel food cakes.

1373
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,059
To my way of thinking,

1374
02:04:43,852 --> 02:04:47,313
taking the one man who's done
you and this town a big service

1375
02:04:47,564 --> 02:04:50,775
and dragging him, with his shy
ways, into the limelight,

1376
02:04:52,444 --> 02:04:53,903
to me, that's a sin.

1377
02:04:55,489 --> 02:04:59,659
It's a sin and I'm not about
to have it on my head.

1378
02:05:01,912 --> 02:05:03,746
I may not be much,
Mr. Finch,

1379
02:05:04,873 --> 02:05:07,083
but I'm still
Sheriff of Maycomb County

1380
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:10,795
and Bob Ewell
fell on his knife.

1381
02:05:12,673 --> 02:05:14,048
Good night, sir.

1382
02:05:53,755 --> 02:05:55,256
Mr. Tate was right.

1383
02:06:00,595 --> 02:06:02,012
What do you mean?

1384
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:10,187
It would be sort of like shooting
a mockingbird, wouldn't it?

1385
02:06:39,426 --> 02:06:41,010
Thank you, Arthur.

1386
02:06:49,686 --> 02:06:51,145
Thank you
for my children.

1387
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:09,497
Neighbors
bring food with death

1388
02:07:10,123 --> 02:07:14,752
and flowers with sickness,
and little things in between.

1389
02:07:16,129 --> 02:07:17,630
Boo was our neighbor.

1390
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:23,260
He gave us two soap dolls,
a broken watch and chain,

1391
02:07:24,387 --> 02:07:26,055
a knife

1392
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,599
and our lives.

1393
02:07:34,439 --> 02:07:36,565
One time, Atticus said

1394
02:07:36,983 --> 02:07:38,609
you never really knew a man

1395
02:07:38,693 --> 02:07:41,529
until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them.

1396
02:07:47,244 --> 02:07:50,246
Just standing on the
Radley porch was enough.

1397
02:07:57,879 --> 02:08:01,215
The summer that had begun
so long ago had ended

1398
02:08:01,424 --> 02:08:03,759
and another summer
had taken its place,

1399
02:08:04,427 --> 02:08:08,389
and a fall,
and Boo Radley had come out.

1400
02:08:12,936 --> 02:08:15,938
I was to think of
these days many times,

1401
02:08:16,356 --> 02:08:20,901
of Jem and Dill and Boo Radley
and Tom Robinson

1402
02:08:23,488 --> 02:08:25,364
and Atticus.

1403
02:08:33,915 --> 02:08:36,125
He would be in
Jem's room all night.

1404
02:08:37,878 --> 02:08:41,839
And he would be there when
Jem waked up in the morning.
