1
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,086
Come on! Knock it off.
Knock it off!

2
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:31,149
Gardner, keep telling them
you're innocent.

3
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:41,144
Don't let them see you're afraid, kid!

4
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:45,739
It'll be all right, son.

5
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:52,827
I didn't wanna do it, sir.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry!

6
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:56,868
I didn't... Sir? Sir?

7
00:00:57,543 --> 00:01:01,772
It won't happen again, sir.
I didn't want...

8
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:16,471
I didn't...

9
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,233
Private Arthur James Gardner...

10
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,437
you've been found guilty
as charged for the crime of murder.

11
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:27,145
Your case has been appealed
three times...

12
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:28,865
and reviewed three times.

13
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:32,325
The verdict of each court-martial
has been the same:

14
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:33,870
Guilty as charged.

15
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:38,325
Do you have anything to say before
sentence is carried out?

16
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:41,162
I didn't mean it.

17
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:44,549
I... I'm sorry.

18
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:51,005
I didn't mean to.

19
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,644
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:09,239
Open it up.

21
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:13,160
Enjoy the show, major?

22
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:44,729
I want to see Major Armbruster.

23
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,738
- Just down the corridor...
- Yeah, I know where it is. I know.

24
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,948
John. Good to see you.

25
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:55,368
Don't you give me that. We had
dinner last night together, remember?

26
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:01,243
Be nice. Take it easy.

27
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:08,092
This time it's serious, John.
You've gotta cooperate.

28
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,130
Let's go.

29
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:21,224
Colonel.
General is waiting, major.

30
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:30,692
Major Reisman, sir.

31
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,327
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.

32
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:42,121
- Sit down, major.
- Thank you, sir.

33
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:52,388
Well, major, what did you think
of the hanging?

34
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,676
Looked very efficient.
Then again, I'm not an expert.

35
00:03:56,893 --> 00:04:00,808
I meant, how did you
personally feel about it?

36
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:03,145
It wasn't the nicest way
to spend an evening.

37
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:06,402
Well, it wasn't staged
for your entertainment, you know.

38
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,479
I hope Private Gardner
was aware of that.

39
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:10,274
- Private who?
- Private Gardner.

40
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,904
He was the object of the exercise.

41
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,241
There happens to have
been a reason, major.

42
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:20,281
I've got your service record here, major.

43
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:25,542
A lot of fireworks. A lot of transfers.

44
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:29,540
One tough scrape after another,
very short on discipline.

45
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:33,258
Very short on discipline.

46
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,805
I hear you did a pretty good job in Italy.

47
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:42,143
Then you loused it up by exceeding your
orders. And that's not the first time.

48
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:45,808
- I didn't write those reports, sir.
- What is that supposed to mean?

49
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,357
I don't necessarily agree
with what's in them.

50
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:52,023
- Maybe you'd like to write your own?
- No, thank you, sir.

51
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:56,867
I'm not very interested in embroidery,
only results.

52
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,335
Now, you hold it right there.

53
00:05:02,544 --> 00:05:05,664
This war was not started
for your private gratification.

54
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,832
And you can be damn sure
that this Army...

55
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,713
isn't being run for your
personal convenience, either.

56
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,594
You've been waiting for a transfer
for over two months now.

57
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,976
With a record like yours,
you could go on waiting forever.

58
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:25,226
However, I get orders too.
And right now I've got some...

59
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:28,645
that sound as if they were made
for somebody just like you.

60
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:31,822
Personally, I don't go for this
behind-the-lines nonsense.

61
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:35,989
As far as I'm concerned, a soldier's job
is to wear his uniform and kill the enemy.

62
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,449
But that's another matter.

63
00:05:39,124 --> 00:05:41,615
I'm gonna ask General Denton
to read these orders...

64
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:43,335
just as they came down to us.

65
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,911
After, if you have any questions, ask.
Understand?

66
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:47,963
- Yes, sir.
- General.

67
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:53,005
"Project Amnesty:

68
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:55,677
You will select 12 prisoners
sentenced to death...

69
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:59,929
or long-term imprisonment for murder,
rape, robbery or other violent crimes.

70
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:03,472
Train these prisoners in as much of the
behind-the-lines operations...

71
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:06,435
as they can absorb in a brief
but unspecified time.

72
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:10,102
You'll then deliver them secretly
to Europe and prior to the invasion...

73
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,527
attack and destroy the target
specified: Overleaf."

74
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:17,612
- That's all?
- That's all.

75
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:21,625
What about the target specified,
Overleaf?

76
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:23,625
Doesn't concern you now.

77
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:25,788
Well, what do you say, major?

78
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:29,172
I'd say it confirms a suspicion
I've had for some time now, sir.

79
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,714
Do you think we might share
that suspicion, major?

80
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:33,007
I think you should.

81
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,055
Since I'll have to assume we're
over here to win the war...

82
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,883
it wouldn't pay to advertise...

83
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:40,894
that one man we're working for
is a raving lunatic.

84
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:44,721
Now, that's enough, major. You're here
to be briefed on an operation.

85
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,650
You have permission to ask questions
about that operation.

86
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:50,441
You do not have permission
to make personal comments...

87
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,407
concerning the officers
responsible for its conception.

88
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,069
- Now, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:57,117
Ask relevant questions or shut up.

90
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:00,080
Is it relevant to ask why I'm being
offered this mission?

91
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:03,997
It's not, as you say, being offered.

92
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,538
I'm volunteering.

93
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:08,124
Exactly, major.

94
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,878
I'm glad you look at these things
so realistically.

95
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:15,300
I don't mean to appear unduly cautious,
but if my personal survival...

96
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:17,886
depends on the performance
of 12 deadheads...

97
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:21,224
it might be helpful to know exactly
what I'm training them for.

98
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:24,188
Now, that's a very good question, major.

99
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:27,766
- Armbruster, let's have the basic outline.
- Yes, sir.

100
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:33,527
"The Germans are using a large chateau
near Rennes in Brittany...

101
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,572
as a rest center and a conference
place for general staff officers."

102
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:40,028
The target has no real
military value itself...

103
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:43,865
but with these conferences, discussion
groups and the like going on...

104
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:47,292
there's hardly a day when
there aren't a considerable number...

105
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:49,787
of important general officers
in residence.

106
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:53,085
Usually with the benefit
of female companionship.

107
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:57,344
"Eliminating a number of senior
officers couldn't but have the effect...

108
00:07:57,515 --> 00:07:59,424
of disrupting
their chain of command."

109
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:02,477
The idea is simply that our men
are dropped by parachute.

110
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:05,980
They enter the chateau and kill
as many senior officers as is possible...

111
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,976
in the time available.

112
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:12,860
Naturally, the place is fortified
and heavily guarded.

113
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:15,695
Naturally.
What's the deal with the men?

114
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:18,946
None whatsoever. Let's have
no misunderstanding about that.

115
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:20,995
It's exactly what it says, an amnesty.

116
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:24,450
A temporary postponement.
You take it or leave it on that basis.

117
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:27,954
Like you say, sir, let's not
have any misunderstandings.

118
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:29,998
I don't like it. I think it stinks.

119
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:31,834
I've had enough of your insolence.

120
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:34,500
It's not a question of insolence
but of practicality.

121
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,127
I'm the guy that's being asked
to sell this idea...

122
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,464
to 12 happy, smiling faces, right?

123
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:43,678
They do have an alternative way to go,
you know.

124
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:48,139
- That's no way for anybody to go.
- Oh, the hell you say, major.

125
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:51,152
Why, I know a lot of people
who should go exactly that way.

126
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:56,735
But that's beside the point.

127
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:59,863
Now, come on, major,
what's your basic objection?

128
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:03,697
These men are, by definition,
incapable of any discipline or authority...

129
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:05,416
much less intensive training.

130
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:08,704
If there isn't a possibility
for a remission of their sentence...

131
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,746
they have nothing to look forward to
and no reason to cooperate, right?

132
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:18,215
Got a point.
You got a point, major.

133
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:21,388
However, as you know,
I don't have the power...

134
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,886
to reverse the findings
of a court-martial.

135
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:27,058
You do have the power to commute
the sentence of such a court.

136
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,691
- Excuse me, general.
- Yes?

137
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,946
You do have authority under the Visiting
Forces Act to make such a ruling.

138
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,990
- Visiting Forces Act?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,078
All right, major, you got a deal.

140
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,868
Let's say that if any of these men
distinguish themselves...

141
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,034
then we will give serious consideration
to commuting their sentences.

142
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,998
That's no deal.

143
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,794
Who's to say whether they really
distinguish themselves or not?

144
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,252
You can leave that decision to me.

145
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:01,261
But remember, the other alternative
will apply with equal force.

146
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,346
Any breach of security,
any failure of discipline...

147
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,058
those prisoners go right back
where they came from.

148
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,850
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

149
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,774
Good. Anything more, gentlemen?

150
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:14,355
Well, yes, sir. I noticed
Colonel Breed in the waiting room.

151
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,276
I wondered whether he was
connected with this operation.

152
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,901
- What if he is?
- I'd be very unhappy, sir.

153
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,831
Major, Colonel Breed
is your superior officer.

154
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,617
And you will behave
accordingly, at all times.

155
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,293
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

156
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,298
Now, it so happens that Colonel Breed
is not concerned with this operation.

157
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,055
But he is running the parachute school
where part of your training will be.

158
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,969
I don't want to hear any complaints,
from either of you.

159
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,477
Now, you've got a job to do,
mister, so move it.

160
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:53,101
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,823
Thank you, gentlemen.

162
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,703
Major Reisman seems to be heading
to his own court-martial.

163
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:10,415
He's the most ill-mannered,
ill-disciplined officer...

164
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,581
it's ever been my displeasure to meet.

165
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,459
You think so, Denton?

166
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:19,551
You may be right.
But he's sure right about one thing.

167
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:23,014
Somebody up there must be
a raving lunatic.

168
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,684
Let's get Colonel Breed in here.

169
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:39,826
Open.

170
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:43,527
All right, you men,
this is an exercise period.

171
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,324
So exercise!

172
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:04,048
Major Reisman, Sergeant Bowren, sir.

173
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:08,514
- Have the prisoners fall in.
- Sir.

174
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,606
Prisoners, fall in.
All right, come on now. Get with it!

175
00:12:16,488 --> 00:12:19,407
- Come on, come on.
- Move it!

176
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:22,992
Come on, move!
Hey, you, move, I said, move.

177
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,172
"Franko, V.R.

178
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,678
Death by hanging.

179
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,600
Vladek, M.

180
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:55,938
Thirty years' hard labor.

181
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:06,403
Jefferson, R.T.

182
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,199
Death by hanging.

183
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,757
Pinkley, V.L.

184
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:22,132
Thirty years' imprisonment.

185
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:33,649
Gilpin, S.

186
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:36,187
Thirty years' hard labor.

187
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:45,035
Posey, S.

188
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:47,450
Death by hanging.

189
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:55,211
Wladislaw, T.

190
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:57,423
Death by hanging.

191
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:02,343
Sawyer, S.K.

192
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:04,925
Twenty years' hard labor.

193
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,731
Lever, R.

194
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,643
Twenty years' imprisonment.

195
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,650
Bravos, T.R.

196
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:24,866
Twenty years' hard labor.

197
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:32,624
Jiminez, P.

198
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,706
Twenty years' hard labor.

199
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,423
Maggott, A.J.

200
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:50,847
Death by hanging."

201
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:58,737
All right, sergeant. Have them fall in
according to height, right to left.

202
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:04,317
According to height, fall in!

203
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:08,367
Come on, you jokers, you heard him.
Get in there! Fall in line!

204
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:15,370
- Come on, move!
- Come on, come on. Turn around.

205
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:18,127
Come on, here! I said, get in line.

206
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:24,552
Straighten up your jacket there.

207
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,383
Get over there.

208
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:31,974
- All right, have them count off.
- Sir. Count off!

209
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:43,319
Let's see what they can do
with a little close-order.

210
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:46,653
- Hut, right!
- Right.

211
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,335
Left, march!

212
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:58,001
Hut, hut, hut, hut.

213
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:03,507
Two, three, four, hut, hut, hut.
Two, three.

214
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,603
Squad, halt!

215
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,321
About face!

216
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,397
Left, march!

217
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,533
Squad, halt!

218
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:33,323
Right face! At ease.

219
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:36,876
Now, what did I say to you?
Or maybe you don't understand English!

220
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:41,459
- What's the matter, Number 11?
- I got a pain.

221
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,882
- Where does it hurt?
- Well, I'll tell you. It's...

222
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:52,725
I wish you would.
And do it correctly, please.

223
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:56,396
Oh, I don't have to say, sir, I...
To you or anyone else.

224
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,900
And I don't have to march, either.
And I know the rules.

225
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:01,898
Why don't you have to march?

226
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:05,691
Because condemned men
don't have to drill.

227
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:11,583
And there's nothing you can
do about it, mister.

228
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:13,502
What's your name, son?

229
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:18,744
Eleven.

230
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,838
His name is Franko, sir.

231
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:27,263
Franko, come over here a minute.
Come on.

232
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:46,443
Look, you little bastard, either you
march or I'll beat your brains out.

233
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:47,946
Understand?

234
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:04,755
What'd you see, sergeant?

235
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:08,511
I saw the major attacked by the prisoner
and forced to defend himself, sir.

236
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,512
All right, have the prisoner
taken back to his cell.

237
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:13,304
Take his head, I'll get his feet.

238
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:16,230
Now let's see what they can do
with a little close-order.

239
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,976
Yes, sir.

240
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:22,190
Squad, ten-hut!

241
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:25,819
Right face.

242
00:18:27,494 --> 00:18:30,495
Forward, march! Hut.

243
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:33,538
Squad, halt!

244
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:36,712
About face!

245
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:39,995
Forward, march!

246
00:18:51,518 --> 00:18:54,270
General prisoner Franko, Victor, sir.

247
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:13,032
So how's the jaw?

248
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,832
If you're gonna act tough, you should
learn how to take care of yourself.

249
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:19,539
You really should.

250
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:21,871
You're worried about my jaw?

251
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,548
Franko's pain bothers the major?

252
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,133
You were a big man with
the syndicate back in Chicago?

253
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:33,519
You've seen my record.

254
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:36,722
Yeah, I've seen your record,
so let's knock it off, huh?

255
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,264
So, what happens first
when you hit London?

256
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:44,188
You get involved in a penny-ante stickup
and start blasting and kill some old guy.

257
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:47,401
And come away with what?

258
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:51,948
- What did you have when they got you?
- What did I have? What do you mean?

259
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:54,530
Come on, big shot.
How much money did you have?

260
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,784
I had enough.

261
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:02,754
Two pounds and 10 shilling.
That's almost 10 dollars.

262
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:06,458
You're gonna get yourself hung
for a lousy 10 bucks.

263
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:09,420
- What's that to you?
- Nothing.

264
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:12,683
Then why don't you get off my back?
You didn't come to visit me.

265
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:13,894
What do you want?

266
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:16,896
I don't care if they hang you
for 10 dollars or 10 cents.

267
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:19,104
It makes no difference to me.

268
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:24,567
But it just so happens that temporarily
I got a little pull around here.

269
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,066
And I might be able to get you
off the hook, if I wanted to.

270
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:36,493
Are you a general?

271
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:40,409
You're not a general, and only
a general can grant my reprieve.

272
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:42,289
Look, stupid.

273
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,877
I'm making you a proposition.

274
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:48,340
All I want from you
is a straight yes or no.

275
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:53,557
- You talk, I'll listen.
- Okay.

276
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:58,178
You either can sweat out the two days
you have before the hanging...

277
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:00,764
or you join an outfit
that I'm putting together.

278
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:04,483
If you do that, I'll have you
out of here in less than 24 hours.

279
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:08,106
But you'll be worked to death, and
there's not a beating you won't take.

280
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,407
And then
when I'm satisfied with you...

281
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:18,247
you'll go where the Army tells you.
Chances are you'll get killed anyway.

282
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:19,913
You don't know Victor Franko.

283
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:22,796
- Guard.
- All right, what's the deal?

284
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,673
What's the deal if I do stay alive?

285
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,711
- Might get off the hook.
- Count me in.

286
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:30,676
But you foul up once,
anywhere along the line, just once...

287
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,346
and you'll be back here
at the end of a rope.

288
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,094
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?

289
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:39,555
You think I want to die?

290
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:48,314
If you do, then you don't
know Victor Franko.

291
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:50,361
How come you speak German?

292
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:53,527
Because my old man was
a coal miner in Silesia.

293
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:57,080
If he didn't speak German,
he didn't dig coal and he didn't eat.

294
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,078
That was the language he spoke
when he came to the States?

295
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:02,079
Pretty tough job in those days.

296
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:04,123
Yeah, it still is.

297
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,587
I don't like officers,
not any of them, and I never have.

298
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:12,762
But you were one yourself,
weren't you?

299
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:16,182
Yeah, three lousy days.

300
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:19,648
Somebody must have thought
you'd make a good officer.

301
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:22,354
They made a big mistake, didn't they?

302
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:25,439
Well, I thought you claimed
he was going over the hill.

303
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:28,062
What the hell are you talking about,
"claimed"?

304
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,279
He was going over the hill.

305
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:33,952
My outfit was pinned down by
the worst crossfire you ever saw.

306
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:37,662
Half of them bleeding to death.
And this lover took off like a rabbit...

307
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,742
with the medical supplies
on his back.

308
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,285
The only way to stop him
was to shoot him.

309
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:45,834
Anyhow, he had it coming.

310
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:50,293
Yeah. But you only made
one mistake, huh?

311
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,850
Guard.

312
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:58,850
You let somebody see you do it.

313
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:11,235
General prisoner Maggott, A.J., sir.

314
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:18,284
"Maggott, A.J. Death by hanging."

315
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,501
Hey, midnight.

316
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:23,410
Be a real good boy, now, and maybe
I'll let you eat with the white folks.

317
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,680
Well, Maggott, I see you've got
a sense of humor.

318
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:44,726
The all-American hero,
laughing in the face of death.

319
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:53,404
They're not gonna hang me, major.

320
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:58,200
I never raped that evil slut...

321
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:02,328
or any other creature.

322
00:24:02,503 --> 00:24:05,172
The Lord gave me that woman
and told me to chastise her.

323
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:07,504
Then he told you to beat her
to death, huh?

324
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:10,124
I only do what I'm called on to do.

325
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:16,925
I was in a state of grace.
And that woman...

326
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:18,845
she tried to soil my spirit.

327
00:24:19,062 --> 00:24:21,019
Well, I'm sure you were, Maggott.

328
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:24,600
But it seems to me I remember
a quotation that goes like:

329
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:26,016
Vengeance is mine.

330
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:32,650
Vengeance is mine.
I will repay, sayeth the Lord.

331
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:35,655
Paul to the Romans, Chapter 12.

332
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:38,987
Exactly. Now, isn't that
supposed to mean...

333
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:42,161
that we leave punishment
of the transgressors to his hands?

334
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:46,505
That's right, major.
That's exactly what it means.

335
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:51,010
But it doesn't restrict him to the kind
of tools he would use, now does it?

336
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,265
And like I told you, major,
I only do what I'm called on to do.

337
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:59,101
You know, Maggott, I don't think
you're going to hang after all.

338
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:06,316
I think a man like you is destined
for higher things. Guard.

339
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:16,114
Besides, us Southern boys have
to stick together now, don't we?

340
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:25,041
I sure didn't mean to kill that fella.

341
00:25:25,254 --> 00:25:28,504
But you do like I say,
and maybe they won't hang you.

342
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:31,717
Fixing to kill me some other way?

343
00:25:31,928 --> 00:25:33,470
It might not come to that.

344
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:38,220
I reckon the folks would be a sight
happier if I died like a soldier.

345
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,222
Can't say I would.

346
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:46,228
Who does this hotshot major
think he is?

347
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:48,560
Making us play wet nurses
to a bunch of scum.

348
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:50,397
Corporal Morgan.

349
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:54,659
If you can't find something to do,
I'll find something for you.

350
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:57,869
Now, move it.

351
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:03,702
Don't sweet-talk me, whitey.
You know why I'm here.

352
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,755
Or maybe you think I should've let
those cracker bastards...

353
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:08,583
go right ahead and castrate me?

354
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:11,215
Seeing what those guys
tried to do to you...

355
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:15,715
I'd say that you had
considerable justification.

356
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:21,849
Thank you, Mr. Major, sir.
I really do thank you for that.

357
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:27,644
But the court didn't agree, right?
So where does that leave you?

358
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:31,111
I'm offering you an alternative,
which means you can keep fighting.

359
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:34,027
- Who for, major?
- For yourself, if you want.

360
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:37,362
But the Krauts,
they're the real master-race merchants.

361
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:39,536
That's your war, man, not mine.

362
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:42,707
You don't like the Krauts,
major, you fight them.

363
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:46,035
Me, I'll pick my own enemies.

364
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:50,168
That's your privilege. But you won't
be able to exercise it much longer.

365
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:51,593
Guard.

366
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:56,339
Because on March 25th,
you have a date with the hangman.

367
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:02,467
That's just six days from now.

368
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,067
<i>Buenos dias,</i> major.

369
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:17,825
You know, sergeant, going over
the transcript of that man's trial...

370
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,160
there are a couple of things
I don't get.

371
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:23,917
Did he ever claim
that he didn't do it?

372
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:27,959
I beg your pardon, but you haven't been
around prisons very much, have you?

373
00:27:28,173 --> 00:27:32,301
You see, the first thing one learns
in prison, everybody is innocent.

374
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:36,218
This one, he doesn't say too much
about that one way or another.

375
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:41,342
He's only disturbed because we don't
allow him to have strings for his guitar.

376
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,429
Sergeant, did you ever lose a man...

377
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:45,894
because he hung himself
with a guitar string?

378
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:48,557
No, sir, I haven't,
and I'm not about to.

379
00:27:48,777 --> 00:27:51,350
Well, if he makes the trip,
see he gets the strings.

380
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,858
Yes, sir.

381
00:27:58,787 --> 00:28:00,364
Attention!

382
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:11,039
- Tell the men to be seated.
- Yes, sir. Take seats!

383
00:28:12,717 --> 00:28:14,046
- Guards out.
- Sir, I...

384
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,502
- Guards out.
- Yes, sir.

385
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:19,343
You heard him. Guards, out!

386
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:34,518
My name, for those of you
who may have forgotten, is Reisman.

387
00:28:35,407 --> 00:28:39,535
You've all volunteered for a mission
which gives you just three ways to go:

388
00:28:39,703 --> 00:28:43,785
You can foul up in training and be sent
back here for execution of sentence...

389
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,619
or you can foul up in combat...

390
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,374
in which case
I'll blow your brains out...

391
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:52,456
or you can do as you're told,
in which case you might just get by.

392
00:28:52,676 --> 00:28:54,550
You must not attempt to escape.

393
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,092
There will be no excuses,
there will be no appeal.

394
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:00,557
Any breach of either of these conditions
by any one of you...

395
00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:04,177
means you'll all be shipped back
for immediate execution of sentence.

396
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:07,853
You are therefore dependent
upon each other.

397
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:10,736
Any one of you try anything smart...

398
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:13,779
and the 12 of you get it
right in the head, all right?

399
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:19,068
So try to remember that.

400
00:29:20,078 --> 00:29:21,489
Now, are there any questions?

401
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:27,419
Sir?

402
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:33,171
Do we have to eat with niggers?

403
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:41,673
It's all right.
The gentleman from the South...

404
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:45,059
made some kind of inquiries
about the dining arrangements.

405
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:48,728
He and his colleagues are discussing
the place-card settings. All right?

406
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:51,645
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

407
00:29:55,572 --> 00:29:58,491
Look, corporal, fellas,
let's get with it, right? Remember?

408
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:01,453
Baseball, pitching?
Chicago's always had the pitching.

409
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:03,779
But now, as far as...
As far as hitting goes...

410
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:07,332
well, my sister, she can hit
better than half them fellas.

411
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,294
Let's move it out!

412
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:19,337
- Well, what do you think, sergeant?
- I think you'll do just fine, sir.

413
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:22,012
Don't give me that.
I said, what do you think?

414
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:28,064
I think the first chance
one of them lovers gets...

415
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:31,643
he's gonna shoot the major
right in the head, sir.

416
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,396
- Thank you, sergeant.
- Sir.

417
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:39,441
Okay, Franko. Let's go.

418
00:30:42,913 --> 00:30:44,573
All right, move it out.

419
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:22,365
Come on.

420
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:45,853
Over there.

421
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:56,606
Sergeant, have the men fall in,
facing me.

422
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:00,861
Sir. All right, on your feet. Fall in
over here, double-quick! Come on now!

423
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:04,534
Come on, snap it up.
Snap it up!

424
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:10,700
Jiminez, get in there!

425
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,048
Ten-hut!

426
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:18,462
All right, Franko, get rid
of that cigarette.

427
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:21,639
Thank you.

428
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,798
This will be your new home
until further notice.

429
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:29,472
What there is of it will be built
by you, but the construction...

430
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,854
will in no way interfere
with your training.

431
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:35,934
So the sooner you get it up, the sooner
you'll be sleeping in out of the rain.

432
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,732
- Sergeant.
- Sir?

433
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:43,570
You're in charge. I want this compound
up and completed within the month.

434
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,325
Thank you.

435
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:11,459
If this place was on fire,
it'd burn to the ground.

436
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:13,460
Come on, what are you doing?

437
00:34:13,671 --> 00:34:16,921
All right, come on. Let's move.
Come on.

438
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:23,931
Hey, Maggott, what are you? German?

439
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,018
Hey, what are you trying to do,
break the window?

440
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:41,315
All right, sergeant, fall them in.

441
00:34:42,284 --> 00:34:44,739
Fall in, in front of the hut.
On the double!

442
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:46,370
Round it up!

443
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,162
At ease.

444
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:57,794
All right, that'll be all for today.

445
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,588
How come they got
all the comforts of home?

446
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:04,759
Why can't we put our floor in?
Why can't we put our windows in?

447
00:35:04,973 --> 00:35:08,141
- Franko's right.
- I'd rather sleep in my cell.

448
00:35:08,728 --> 00:35:11,978
Mr. Franko, with his keen eye
for detail...

449
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:15,398
has noted that the prisoners'
quarters are not yet ready.

450
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:18,984
The answer to that is simple:

451
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:21,948
You are not yet ready
to occupy that hut...

452
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:25,280
with the degree of comfort
that you would like.

453
00:35:26,162 --> 00:35:29,578
When I think that you've earned
that privilege, I'll let you know.

454
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,664
Reveille is at 0530.

455
00:35:33,878 --> 00:35:35,253
That is all. Sergeant.

456
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:38,210
Sir. You heard the man, chow time!

457
00:35:38,424 --> 00:35:39,918
Dismissed!

458
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:45,346
That's it, fellas. Speak up, boys.
Speak up.

459
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,635
Wind it up, strike one!

460
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:58,100
Hey, Joseph, is that the way
they did it in the Polish navy?

461
00:35:58,486 --> 00:36:00,360
You won't win any cigars that way.

462
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,201
Hey, Franko, number please.

463
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:10,244
Ask the operator for my nickel back.

464
00:36:10,456 --> 00:36:13,541
Why don't you guys
just dry up and blow away?

465
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:26,050
<i>Meanwhile, on the Atlantic wall...</i>

466
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:29,220
<i>the German forces</i>
<i>have been preparing...</i>

467
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:32,105
<i>a few nice surprises for you,</i>
<i>gentlemen...</i>

468
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:34,105
<i>just in case Mr. Churchill...</i>

469
00:36:34,274 --> 00:36:38,485
<i>is really foolish enough</i>
<i>to attempt an invasion.</i>

470
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:42,238
<i>He may not be</i>
<i>unduly worried about this...</i>

471
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:46,487
<i>but then, of course, he will not</i>
<i>be taking any active part...</i>

472
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,984
<i>in such an...</i>

473
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:50,280
Hey, what's this guy's name again?

474
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:52,782
You ought to know.
You listen to him every night.

475
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:57,414
- Dumbo, get me a cup of coffee.
- You crazy?

476
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:02,717
I say shut the guy up.

477
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:06,503
- Sleepy time.
- Hey, jump through this, will you?

478
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,067
Hey, you. Come here.

479
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,605
You look like an intelligent guy.

480
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,779
- You like it here?
- No.

481
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,448
You gonna stay here?

482
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:35,038
- Well, I ain't got nowhere else to go.
- Ah, you're an idiot.

483
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,042
Hey, Wladislaw.
You understand German.

484
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,259
Who's that dame singing about?

485
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,512
Well, it's about a very lonely girl...

486
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,096
who's sick and tired of war
and being left alone.

487
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,856
- Waiting for her man to come home.
- Keep that cheap, wailing slut quiet!

488
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,948
Let's cut out the community sing.

489
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:13,201
Get some sleep. You're gonna need it.

490
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,041
Up yours.

491
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,419
Creeps. They're all creeps.
That's what they are. Creeps.

492
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,683
- Hey, where you going?
- Going to the can.

493
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,765
- Want me to come with you?
- You kidding?

494
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:07,876
They're after Franko.

495
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:26,024
You trying to get us all hung?

496
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,734
We're all dead anyway. Don't tell me
you believe that creep Reisman.

497
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:33,779
Want that slick bum to make suckers
out of you? Whose side are you on?

498
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:41,828
What's with you?

499
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:45,714
What is this, anyway?
Uncle Tom week?

500
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:48,169
You come with me, we're home free.

501
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,803
He doesn't give a damn about you.

502
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:03,982
If we go on that mission, we all
get killed. That's what they want!

503
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:08,276
Those idiots in there are gonna get shot,
and they're not even due for hanging.

504
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:12,490
You, you slob, you slob.
What do you think you got coming?

505
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:46,113
- Slipped on a bar of soap, huh?
- Yeah.

506
00:40:48,284 --> 00:40:51,119
Pull with your arms,
hold with your legs.

507
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:54,996
Pull with your arms,
hold with your legs.

508
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:56,915
Come on, Jiminez. Move it.

509
00:40:57,126 --> 00:40:58,169
When the time comes...

510
00:40:58,335 --> 00:41:01,502
you've got exactly 34 seconds
to clear that distance.

511
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,048
I really can't make it, major.

512
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:07,294
Oh, come on, Jiminez.
Move it. Don't stop now.

513
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:08,887
I can't! I can't!

514
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:11,884
- Come on, Jiminez. Move.
- I really can't.

515
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:15,138
I can't make it, major.
I can't make it! I can't make it!

516
00:41:15,352 --> 00:41:19,979
Jiminez! You come back down that rope,
you're going straight back to prison.

517
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:23,690
I can't. I can't!
Really, I can't.

518
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:27,023
Sergeant, give me that weapon.
Take a spin on that rope.

519
00:41:28,491 --> 00:41:32,572
I can't make it. I can't make it!
I can't!

520
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:36,658
I really can't make it, major.
I can't!

521
00:41:42,297 --> 00:41:44,753
Boy, look at him go now!

522
00:41:50,972 --> 00:41:52,846
So you couldn't make it, huh?

523
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:56,186
Okay, Posey, let's see a little
of that Apache know-how.

524
00:41:56,353 --> 00:41:59,472
Re-thread that pulley and get another
rope down here. Come on!

525
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,848
Give these other characters
a crack at immortality.

526
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:07,196
You said Mayonnaise was the only one
supposed to get on top of that chateau.

527
00:42:07,364 --> 00:42:12,442
But suppose Jiminez gets killed before
he gets to the top of that chateau.

528
00:42:12,745 --> 00:42:16,328
- Come on, Posey. Move it.
- Come on, get that thing up here.

529
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,829
We'll have it ready in a minute, major.

530
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:23,205
All right, Franko, you're next.

531
00:42:33,266 --> 00:42:35,342
All right, so much for hygiene
on the field.

532
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,726
Now, which one of you guys would
like to stick this in the major?

533
00:42:41,524 --> 00:42:44,893
Well, major, if it's gonna
help the war effort...

534
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:46,978
Franko, sit down.
You'll get your chance.

535
00:42:48,824 --> 00:42:50,235
Well, let's see...

536
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,660
- Posey.
- Me?

537
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,198
Yeah, step out here.

538
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:55,658
I'd rather not, sir.

539
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,909
Look, Posey, it's just an example.
Come on, now. Step out here.

540
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:00,912
Now, will you hold this knife?

541
00:43:02,337 --> 00:43:05,007
Posey, it's got a scabbard on it.
It can't hurt anybody.

542
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,092
Tell me, Posey,
what did they lock you up for?

543
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:15,092
I mean, what did you do?

544
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:17,351
I already told you that, sir.

545
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,518
Well, tell me again.

546
00:43:19,688 --> 00:43:22,523
I'm sure that your friends
over here would like to know too.

547
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,271
- What'd you do, Posey?
- Yeah, fill him in.

548
00:43:27,446 --> 00:43:30,779
This fella kept pushing me.
I don't like to be pushed, so I hit him.

549
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:34,112
Killed a man with your bare hands
because he shoved you?

550
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:37,329
I only hit him once.

551
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:40,040
Only hit him once.

552
00:43:40,293 --> 00:43:44,540
And drove his jawbone right through
his brain because he pushed him.

553
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:48,623
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- You didn't mean to kill him, but you did.

554
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:52,301
Now, what would you do if you meant
to kill somebody? Could you do it?

555
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,758
If you had to kill somebody with a knife,
do you think you could do it?

556
00:43:57,977 --> 00:43:59,804
- Come on. Tell me.
- I'd rather not.

557
00:43:59,979 --> 00:44:01,972
I don't care what you'd rather do.

558
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,144
Come on, stick that knife in me.
You can do that. Come on.

559
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,355
Major, I don't want to do this.

560
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,484
Come on, Posey. Just stick it
right here in me, it won't hurt.

561
00:44:10,658 --> 00:44:11,737
Come on.

562
00:44:11,951 --> 00:44:14,868
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You're not. I'm gonna hurt you.

563
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:17,118
- Posey, stick me.
- I don't want no trouble.

564
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:20,207
You got no trouble. I'll give you
all the trouble you'll get.

565
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:23,626
Come on, now, Posey. Just stick
that knife right there, right there.

566
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:25,083
You're a big boy.

567
00:44:25,256 --> 00:44:27,663
You killed a man for shoving you?
I'm shoving you.

568
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:30,172
- Come on. Let me have it.
- Stick him!

569
00:44:30,344 --> 00:44:34,176
I'm talking to you. Give it to me or I'm
gonna shove you right through the wall!

570
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:36,509
Come on, Posey. Give it to him!

571
00:44:36,725 --> 00:44:38,848
- Stab him!
- Get him, Posey! Come on, Posey!

572
00:44:42,356 --> 00:44:44,562
I want that knife.
Why won't you give it to me?

573
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:47,485
- I don't like to be shoved, major.
- You're being shoved!

574
00:44:50,364 --> 00:44:52,522
- Stick him!
- Knock him down, Posey!

575
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,692
Posey. What a name for a guy like you.

576
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:56,411
- Stop!
- Don't tell me what to do.

577
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,571
- I'm giving orders.
- I don't like pushing.

578
00:44:58,747 --> 00:45:00,787
Give it to him, Pose! Come on!

579
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:02,452
I don't like to be shoved.

580
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,960
Stop pushing!

581
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:17,555
Posey. Posey!

582
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,264
- Posey.
- Yes, sir?

583
00:45:22,814 --> 00:45:24,226
Are you all right?

584
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:26,861
Yeah.

585
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:29,404
All right, now. Relax.

586
00:45:30,656 --> 00:45:32,364
Come on, get up.

587
00:45:36,537 --> 00:45:39,622
You know, you learn how to take care
of that temper of yours...

588
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,281
ain't nobody gonna take
this knife away from you.

589
00:45:42,502 --> 00:45:43,782
You're right. I'm sorry.

590
00:45:44,003 --> 00:45:46,079
Okay, major. We're all set.

591
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:49,462
All right, you go in
and see Captain Kinder.

592
00:45:49,675 --> 00:45:52,629
- What's he gonna do?
- He's just gonna talk to you, Posey.

593
00:45:53,596 --> 00:45:56,383
- Brush yourself off and go on in.
- Yes, sir.

594
00:45:58,893 --> 00:46:01,431
All right, which
of you gentlemen is next?

595
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:03,977
Come on. I'm looking for a volunteer.

596
00:46:05,775 --> 00:46:08,182
All right, Maggott. You're next.

597
00:46:10,196 --> 00:46:12,485
Speed it up, men.
Come on, speed it up.

598
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:18,830
They're looking good.

599
00:46:18,996 --> 00:46:22,412
Yes, sir. I hope they don't forget
what they're getting in shape for.

600
00:46:26,546 --> 00:46:29,463
Captain Kinder figures
maybe he can teach me letters.

601
00:46:29,632 --> 00:46:31,921
Folks back home would be proud
if I could write.

602
00:46:32,343 --> 00:46:35,629
Well, that would put you way ahead
of most of the guys around here.

603
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:38,798
- Better fall in and join them.
- Yes, sir.

604
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:41,682
It's true that I've been blessed...

605
00:46:41,896 --> 00:46:45,182
with an insight into women
that others don't have.

606
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,647
And sometimes...
Well, sometimes I'm called upon...

607
00:46:49,821 --> 00:46:51,944
to use it in our beloved master's will.

608
00:46:52,532 --> 00:46:56,150
If women are your special province, why
do you hate Major Reisman so much?

609
00:46:58,913 --> 00:47:02,329
There are 11 evil men out there...

610
00:47:05,086 --> 00:47:07,542
and they must be punished
for their wickedness.

611
00:47:07,714 --> 00:47:10,169
And this Major Reisman,
he just snatched them up...

612
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:14,090
from the brink of the pit, and he
cheated the master of his vengeance.

613
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:17,179
And you think that's what God wants?
To punish these men?

614
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:22,220
Oh, he will, captain. He will.
And Major Reisman too.

615
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:25,521
- So, what does that give you?
- It doesn't give me anything.

616
00:47:25,732 --> 00:47:28,353
But along with these other results,
it gives you...

617
00:47:28,568 --> 00:47:32,566
about the most twisted, anti-social
bunch of psychopathic deformities ever.

618
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:36,530
And the worst, the most dangerous
of the bunch is Maggott.

619
00:47:37,035 --> 00:47:41,364
You've got one religious maniac,
one malignant dwarf, two near-idiots...

620
00:47:41,581 --> 00:47:43,787
And the rest, I don't even want
to think about.

621
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:46,366
Well, I can't think of a better way
to fight a war.

622
00:47:46,544 --> 00:47:50,162
The results of these tests
point to the fact that each man...

623
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:55,209
has a built-in resentment against
any kind of authority. Any kind.

624
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:58,260
- Don't you?
- But this is different.

625
00:47:58,432 --> 00:48:01,433
These guys think the U.S. Army
is their enemy, not the Germans.

626
00:48:01,602 --> 00:48:03,096
Well, they know the U.S. Army.

627
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:06,054
But the Krauts haven't done
anything to them yet.

628
00:48:06,273 --> 00:48:07,733
Very sophisticated.

629
00:48:10,362 --> 00:48:12,401
Well, at least they know the U.S. Army.

630
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:15,907
You can twist it any way you want.
But the point is...

631
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:17,819
you are their main enemy.

632
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:20,699
And when the time comes,
you'll be the number one target.

633
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:23,405
Well, at least it gives them
something in common.

634
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:24,668
What do you mean?

635
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:28,541
They've come a long way individually,
further than we have a right to expect.

636
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:30,753
But not as a unit. Not as a group.

637
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:33,925
They've gotta function as a team.
And that's what's lacking.

638
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:36,377
You think putting them
on guard duty will help?

639
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:38,927
Well, it might give them
a sense of participation.

640
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:44,142
Why don't you let me weed out
the real morons? Especially Maggott.

641
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:48,434
I didn't pick these men, the Army did.
And I didn't pick the assignment either.

642
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:52,101
This is one time the Army's going
with a starting lineup all the way.

643
00:48:52,404 --> 00:48:54,313
- Including Maggott?
- Including Maggott.

644
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:56,945
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

645
00:48:58,994 --> 00:49:02,493
- We could get ourselves hurt, right?
- Why don't you shut up, huh?

646
00:49:02,664 --> 00:49:05,155
What's the matter?
You planning to save your mother?

647
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,573
Why don't you lay off?

648
00:49:06,793 --> 00:49:08,702
Want me to show you
how to do it, huh?

649
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:10,873
All right.

650
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:16,250
Take my arm, put it around your neck.
Very simple, right?

651
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,759
And then it's all in the leverage.

652
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:23,102
Better learn how to fall.
You'll end up in a wheelchair.

653
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:24,811
That's what I tried to tell him.

654
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:27,648
Trouble is you just don't know
how to fall right. Here.

655
00:49:28,191 --> 00:49:30,397
Slob. Ah, that's a bad attitude.

656
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:34,310
Kind of rough on the little fella,
aren't you? Like to try that with me?

657
00:49:43,749 --> 00:49:45,373
Now, this is really quite simple.

658
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:48,075
I'm going to say a word,
and you come back at me...

659
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:50,625
as fast as you can
with whatever comes to mind.

660
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:54,790
For instance, if I were to say
"happiness," you might say "children."

661
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,670
I wouldn't say that.

662
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,722
Well, that was just an example.

663
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,013
But if I said "ambition,"
what would you say?

664
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:05,143
I wouldn't say anything.

665
00:50:06,647 --> 00:50:09,220
Well, let's give it a try, okay?

666
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:13,858
- Weapon.
- Baseball.

667
00:50:14,071 --> 00:50:16,609
- Knife.
- Dodgers.

668
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:19,442
- Officer.
- Pitcher.

669
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,200
You seem to be thinking about
just one thing, aren't you?

670
00:50:25,374 --> 00:50:27,995
Yeah. What are you thinking about?

671
00:50:29,878 --> 00:50:32,964
Well, you see, I don't want you
to think of just one thing.

672
00:50:33,174 --> 00:50:36,923
I'd like for you to concentrate
on each word I throw at you. Okay?

673
00:50:38,388 --> 00:50:39,430
Okay.

674
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,183
Food.

675
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,220
Cincinnati.

676
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:48,813
- Comfort.
- Chicago.

677
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:53,106
- Now, what made you say that?
- That's what I was thinking about.

678
00:51:04,622 --> 00:51:06,283
The hell with it!

679
00:51:06,584 --> 00:51:08,327
Franko, what is it this time?

680
00:51:08,544 --> 00:51:10,702
How am I supposed to shave
in cold water?!

681
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:13,958
You're in the field now.
Where are you gonna get hot water?

682
00:51:14,175 --> 00:51:16,251
The guards got hot water!
You got hot water!

683
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,170
- You're in the field!
- That's tough.

684
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:20,925
Right. How come you guys have
hot water and we don't?

685
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:23,506
You keep quiet!
You keep your big mouth shut.

686
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:26,686
- We ain't shaving in cold water!
- Not if all you don't.

687
00:51:26,896 --> 00:51:29,850
You want us to shave in cold water?
Why don't you?

688
00:51:30,065 --> 00:51:31,346
- That's right.
- Yeah!

689
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:33,476
Franko means it.

690
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:36,481
We ain't shaving. We ain't washing.
Not in cold water!

691
00:51:36,655 --> 00:51:38,081
- Is that right?
- That's right!

692
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:40,108
The guards got hot, we won't use cold.

693
00:51:40,326 --> 00:51:41,440
And you can't make us!

694
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:44,454
You're gonna get yourself
into hot water, Franko.

695
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,823
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hang us?

696
00:51:47,082 --> 00:51:49,409
What can they do?
They can't do nothing!

697
00:51:49,586 --> 00:51:52,207
- Nothing.
- Now what are you gonna do?

698
00:51:55,133 --> 00:51:58,383
You know, I think Franko
might be right this time.

699
00:51:58,553 --> 00:52:01,507
Yeah, shaving in cold water
won't make us any better soldiers.

700
00:52:02,641 --> 00:52:05,013
Excuse me, sir.
We got some trouble outside.

701
00:52:05,477 --> 00:52:07,884
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear.

702
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:17,436
- All right, sergeant. Fall them in.
- Yes, sir.

703
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:19,814
All right, fall in. On your feet!

704
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:22,360
Come on, right over here, Posey!

705
00:52:23,828 --> 00:52:25,868
Come on! Dress it up there. Get in line!

706
00:52:26,873 --> 00:52:30,076
What's this about refusing to shave?
Who is refusing to shave?

707
00:52:30,293 --> 00:52:31,835
- We are!
- Who is we?

708
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,213
We!

709
00:52:34,172 --> 00:52:37,423
All those refusing to shave,
take one step forward.

710
00:53:00,241 --> 00:53:02,566
So you want to stink, huh?

711
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:05,286
And maybe itch too?

712
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:08,623
Well, that's okay with me
because I don't have to smell you.

713
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:12,079
Sergeant, there will be no further
issue of shaving equipment...

714
00:53:12,254 --> 00:53:13,297
or the use of soap.

715
00:53:13,505 --> 00:53:15,747
And there will be no more hot meals.

716
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:17,217
Just K rations.

717
00:53:18,302 --> 00:53:20,627
Courtesy of Mr. Franko.

718
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:29,009
At ease.

719
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:35,021
- Hey, I really think we got something.
- Yeah, it's what the Navy calls "mutiny."

720
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:38,894
No, no. Remember what I was saying
last night about 12 rugged individualists?

721
00:53:39,072 --> 00:53:40,115
So?

722
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:44,441
You heard them. It was "we ain't gonna
do this and we ain't gonna do that."

723
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:47,111
When I asked them to step forward,
even Posey joined.

724
00:53:47,372 --> 00:53:50,457
I'll bet you he's been shaving
in cold water since he was a kid.

725
00:53:51,043 --> 00:53:52,751
Boy, do I love that Franko.

726
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:58,169
That means that we are going to have
that much more time for work.

727
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:00,093
Right?

728
00:54:01,094 --> 00:54:04,095
So now, if you...

729
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:08,056
You "dirty dozen" have no objections...

730
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,769
we will get our equipment...

731
00:54:12,273 --> 00:54:16,105
and we will start in right now.

732
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:20,398
Attention!

733
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:27,993
Ready, hut!

734
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:31,534
That's very good.

735
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:34,962
You look just like real soldiers.

736
00:54:35,548 --> 00:54:36,876
Fall out!

737
00:54:38,384 --> 00:54:40,175
Now, move it!

738
00:54:41,554 --> 00:54:45,136
You're still the dirtiest soldiers
in this man's army...

739
00:54:45,724 --> 00:54:47,966
and you're getting
filthier every day.

740
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:50,844
But your training is almost over.

741
00:54:52,273 --> 00:54:55,274
In two days, you'll be learning
how to jump with a parachute...

742
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:56,687
and you'll learn quick.

743
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,405
This training will take place
at a regular Army base.

744
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:05,324
And I just want to remind you
that this operation is secret.

745
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,244
Top secret.

746
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,829
You will not be wearing dog tags.
You will not say anything to anyone.

747
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,284
Do you understand? Nothing.
Nothing!

748
00:55:15,087 --> 00:55:18,041
One word, one slip
from any one of you...

749
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,499
and the deal is off!

750
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:22,883
And you all know what that means,
right?

751
00:55:26,807 --> 00:55:28,385
All right, serve it up.

752
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,262
All right, serve it up!

753
00:55:32,188 --> 00:55:35,225
Colonel Breed won't like this secrecy bit.
He'll want to know.

754
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,650
- We're still top-priority, aren't we?
- You can't ignore his author...

755
00:55:38,862 --> 00:55:41,021
- Do we have the juice?
- Yes, but Colonel Br...

756
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:43,950
Then I don't care
what Colonel Breed likes.

757
00:55:44,368 --> 00:55:47,322
Look, you're supposed to be
the liaison officer.

758
00:55:47,538 --> 00:55:49,910
I want you to get orders
to the highest echelon...

759
00:55:50,082 --> 00:55:52,408
stating to Colonel Everett
Dasher Breed...

760
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:56,535
that a group, over which he will have
no authority, will be arriving Tuesday...

761
00:55:56,714 --> 00:56:01,091
and the identity of the men is secret.
Tell him we got a general with them...

762
00:56:01,302 --> 00:56:06,047
tell him anything you want, just get
that West Point bum off of my back.

763
00:56:06,933 --> 00:56:08,391
A general, huh?

764
00:56:09,477 --> 00:56:10,936
I'll see what I can do.

765
00:56:11,562 --> 00:56:14,100
- I know you will.
- Hey, Franko. What is it, man?

766
00:56:14,273 --> 00:56:16,681
- What kind of food is that?
- Pig face, serve it up!

767
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:18,353
What is it?

768
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,775
I don't know. I never ate
anything like this before.

769
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:24,741
I've stepped in it a couple of times,
but I never ate it.

770
00:56:24,909 --> 00:56:25,952
What is it?

771
00:56:30,122 --> 00:56:31,747
Did you ask what general?

772
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,576
Yes, sir. Got the same thing again.

773
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:36,414
No information beyond
what was in the order.

774
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:39,250
What about General Denton?

775
00:56:39,465 --> 00:56:43,249
When we first called, his extension
was busy. Now he's not there.

776
00:56:57,609 --> 00:56:58,985
Not now.

777
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:10,493
- Well, what about you?
- Nothing, sir.

778
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:26,507
Not now, you...

779
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:46,360
I think they're coming.

780
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:47,655
Yeah, it's them.

781
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:53,955
Yes? Sir, they just passed
the checkpoint.

782
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:55,542
Let's go.

783
00:57:59,797 --> 00:58:01,126
Now. Now!

784
00:58:13,895 --> 00:58:16,185
Sounds like we're running
into a party.

785
00:58:17,149 --> 00:58:19,605
Boy, you don't suppose
it's for us, do you?

786
00:58:46,054 --> 00:58:48,379
Present arms!

787
00:58:52,727 --> 00:58:54,387
Major Reisman reporting, sir.

788
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,305
Where's the general?

789
00:59:03,363 --> 00:59:06,862
He's in the truck. But you understand
that he's traveling incognito.

790
00:59:09,703 --> 00:59:12,573
We thought he might care to inspect
our number one platoon.

791
00:59:12,914 --> 00:59:16,746
If you give me a moment,
I'll see if he's willing to do that.

792
00:59:17,752 --> 00:59:20,160
Order, halt!

793
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:23,918
How come the band?

794
00:59:24,509 --> 00:59:27,427
- What are we waiting for?
- They're inspecting the guest list.

795
00:59:27,596 --> 00:59:30,003
- What guest list?
- What's the matter with you?

796
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:34,845
Which one of you wants
to be a general?

797
00:59:35,021 --> 00:59:36,645
Be a what?

798
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:38,059
Pinkley.

799
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,982
What? What kind of a general, sir?

800
00:59:42,486 --> 00:59:46,235
Just a plain ordinary, everyday,
home-loving American general.

801
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,157
I'd rather be a civilian, sir.

802
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:53,486
What do I have to do?

803
00:59:53,706 --> 00:59:57,538
You've seen generals inspecting troops.
Just walk slow and act stupid.

804
00:59:57,752 --> 01:00:00,788
Up one rank, down the other,
and straight back to the truck.

805
01:00:01,214 --> 01:00:04,630
They're expecting a general,
and that's exactly what they'll get.

806
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,212
So let's go.

807
01:00:09,097 --> 01:00:11,968
- Move it. Come on, move it!
- Ten-hut!

808
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:14,265
Present arms!

809
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:15,723
Move it.
Let's go, move it.

810
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,863
Fall in!

811
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,610
- Pinkley's gonna be a general.
- Why?

812
01:00:29,785 --> 01:00:31,694
- Pinkley's gonna be a general.
- What for?

813
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:32,913
Shut up and watch.

814
01:00:46,093 --> 01:00:48,762
First Platoon waiting for inspection, sir!

815
01:01:18,835 --> 01:01:22,619
They're very pretty, colonel.
Very pretty.

816
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:24,962
- But can they fight?
- Yes, sir.

817
01:01:25,174 --> 01:01:26,717
I hope you're right.

818
01:01:31,264 --> 01:01:35,097
- Where are you from, son?
- Madison City, Missouri, sir.

819
01:01:37,813 --> 01:01:38,928
Never heard of it.

820
01:01:43,194 --> 01:01:46,563
All right, major, let's go. We got
work to do. Thank you, colonel.

821
01:01:59,335 --> 01:02:00,877
Hold it down. Hold it down.

822
01:02:05,883 --> 01:02:08,719
You pull a stunt like that again,
I'll beat your brains out.

823
01:02:08,887 --> 01:02:10,346
Major, you d...

824
01:02:12,432 --> 01:02:15,516
Sergeant, fall them into a column
of twos, then move out.

825
01:02:15,685 --> 01:02:20,264
Yes, sir. Fall out. Fall into column
of twos on me. Fall out!

826
01:02:41,169 --> 01:02:42,829
Reisman!

827
01:02:45,882 --> 01:02:49,298
Some people may consider you
a first-class officer.

828
01:02:49,761 --> 01:02:54,506
But as far as I'm concerned, you're
a disorganized, undisciplined clown.

829
01:02:54,724 --> 01:02:57,678
I'm gonna make it my business
to run you out of this Army.

830
01:02:57,894 --> 01:02:59,970
I owe you an apology, colonel.

831
01:03:00,188 --> 01:03:04,401
I always thought that you were a cold,
unimaginative, tight-lipped officer.

832
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:09,605
But you're really quite emotional,
aren't you?

833
01:03:15,788 --> 01:03:17,745
Clayton, Blake.

834
01:03:24,923 --> 01:03:27,165
- Hey, watch it.
- Look out, will you?

835
01:03:27,426 --> 01:03:29,253
- Hey, hold this.
- All right, let's go!

836
01:03:29,469 --> 01:03:33,088
- Do you believe this guy?
- Okay, all right, we're coming!

837
01:03:34,933 --> 01:03:36,807
Come on, let's go!

838
01:03:48,822 --> 01:03:50,400
You're in the way.

839
01:03:52,451 --> 01:03:54,325
What's the matter with you guys?

840
01:03:54,536 --> 01:03:55,912
- Listen, buster.
- Hands off!

841
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,122
Now, take it easy.

842
01:03:57,289 --> 01:04:00,373
- Just want to ask you a few questions.
- Questions, huh?

843
01:04:05,672 --> 01:04:07,131
Hold him! Hold him!

844
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,170
You son of a...

845
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:14,381
In the gut, so it don't show.

846
01:04:16,433 --> 01:04:17,808
That's the way!

847
01:04:21,939 --> 01:04:23,978
Talk, you bastard.
Who the hell are you?

848
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:28,815
- Number Nine, you crumb.
- Number Nine?

849
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:31,693
- You gonna tell us or not?
- Go to hell.

850
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:33,988
Hold him.

851
01:04:36,162 --> 01:04:38,155
Where the hell are your dog tags?

852
01:04:39,832 --> 01:04:42,503
- I ate them.
- You ate them?

853
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,124
- You gonna tell us now?
- Yeah.

854
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:47,675
Yeah.

855
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,761
- Number Nine!
- Wladislaw!

856
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,653
What happened?

857
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,662
They tried to make me talk.

858
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,348
Where the hell have you been?

859
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,644
- Wait. What happened to him?
- He slipped on a bar of soap.

860
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,562
Everybody's slipping on soap.

861
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,604
Of all the miserable...

862
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,110
- Who?
- Who? Reisman.

863
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,152
He had a couple
of those paras jump him.

864
01:05:51,363 --> 01:05:53,689
- Major did this?
- Gave him a pretty hard time.

865
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,817
- Well?
- Well, what?

866
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,578
Did he tell them anything?

867
01:05:58,246 --> 01:05:59,361
Are you crazy?

868
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,576
Three wise men.

869
01:06:01,918 --> 01:06:05,369
"Trust your major."
I'd rather trust Hitler.

870
01:06:06,589 --> 01:06:10,421
- All right, move it out.
- Come on, move it! Move it!

871
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:20,436
You'll find this easier
than our jump-tower training.

872
01:06:20,603 --> 01:06:23,308
Action stations!

873
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:26,776
Go!

874
01:07:08,234 --> 01:07:09,277
Morgan.

875
01:07:09,485 --> 01:07:11,810
- Yes, sir.
- They should be here any minute now.

876
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:14,236
Get the men together.
I'll talk to them first.

877
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:16,608
- We'll use your hut tonight.
- Our hut?

878
01:07:16,785 --> 01:07:17,828
Your hut.

879
01:07:18,036 --> 01:07:20,492
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

880
01:07:20,664 --> 01:07:22,158
All right, Ike and Mike.

881
01:07:22,332 --> 01:07:25,832
Come on, get on your feet.
Come on, let's go.

882
01:07:26,003 --> 01:07:27,045
Move it!

883
01:07:27,588 --> 01:07:29,664
What are you, the Gold Dust Twins?

884
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:35,301
What, you need a special invitation?

885
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:36,514
- No, sir.
- No, sir?

886
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:38,638
- I mean, yes, sir.
- Then move it.

887
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:45,018
That's TS, Greek.
Why don't you tell it to the chaplain?

888
01:07:46,566 --> 01:07:49,686
All right, you foul-ups, come on!
Get over to the MP hut.

889
01:07:49,903 --> 01:07:52,476
The man wants to talk to you.
Come on, move it!

890
01:07:52,697 --> 01:07:54,191
All right.

891
01:07:54,866 --> 01:07:55,909
Stop pushing.

892
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:59,871
Come on, off it now. Let's get going!

893
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:03,453
So this is how the other half lives.

894
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:05,458
Get going!

895
01:08:05,877 --> 01:08:08,119
Hey, we're not going
to the junior prom.

896
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:11,292
- Pretty sweet, huh?
- No dancing. Come on, let's go!

897
01:08:14,093 --> 01:08:16,086
- They got electricity.
- Nice to be rich.

898
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:18,629
- Hey, what does he want to see us for?
- A radio.

899
01:08:18,848 --> 01:08:20,722
- A radio?
- Hey, look at those pictures.

900
01:08:20,892 --> 01:08:22,386
Maybe the guards are lonesome.

901
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:25,603
- Horny bunch of mothers.
- Wow!

902
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:30,766
All right, give them
a little air, boys.

903
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:33,522
Move it, Jiminez.

904
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:46,626
Okay, sarge.

905
01:09:14,406 --> 01:09:17,822
Well, jump school didn't kill you.
Maybe that stuff will.

906
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:21,326
Your training's about over
and I figure that entitles you...

907
01:09:21,538 --> 01:09:25,915
to a graduation ball or something.
You have cups and glasses.

908
01:09:28,712 --> 01:09:30,254
All right, wheel them in.

909
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:47,184
Shall I say they're
with your compliments?

910
01:09:47,355 --> 01:09:49,645
Hell, no.
Tell them it's part of their training.

911
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:50,860
Yes, sir.

912
01:09:51,068 --> 01:09:52,349
Where are we?

913
01:09:52,528 --> 01:09:55,399
Oh! Somebody in this truck
has a cold nose.

914
01:09:55,615 --> 01:09:57,358
Get off me foot!

915
01:09:57,575 --> 01:10:00,066
Watch yourself, baby.

916
01:10:00,786 --> 01:10:03,028
- Have you hurt yourself?
- It's a limey barrack!

917
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:05,447
I'm not one for orgies meself.

918
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:08,786
- Should've asked for more money.
- Bitch.

919
01:10:09,295 --> 01:10:11,797
You sadists!

920
01:10:12,131 --> 01:10:15,963
- Good evening.
- I'm already too worn out to work.

921
01:10:16,636 --> 01:10:19,008
- Right this way, ladies.
- Move along. That's nice.

922
01:10:19,222 --> 01:10:20,680
Good evening, major.

923
01:10:22,308 --> 01:10:26,886
I could only get eight, sir. It's like cops.
If you want one, you can't find them.

924
01:10:27,063 --> 01:10:29,602
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, admiral.

925
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:37,074
Blimey, they're filthy!

926
01:10:37,241 --> 01:10:40,195
They may be, lady,
but they sure do mean well.

927
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,453
Hey!

928
01:10:42,329 --> 01:10:45,116
All present and accounted for, major.

929
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:52,411
You gentlemen will be on duty again
at 0600 hours in the morning.

930
01:10:52,756 --> 01:10:55,045
That's, oddly enough, the same
amount of time...

931
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:58,218
that these young ladies have allotted
to be your guests.

932
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:03,305
In the meantime, I suggest that
you use that time to get acquainted.

933
01:11:04,017 --> 01:11:06,723
I don't believe that Mr. Maggott
would care to indulge...

934
01:11:06,938 --> 01:11:10,473
so I suggest you save some whiskey
for him when he gets off of duty.

935
01:11:10,858 --> 01:11:12,602
Good night, gentlemen. Ladies.

936
01:11:12,819 --> 01:11:14,646
Good night, colonel.

937
01:11:17,365 --> 01:11:20,034
- Are you crazy?
- Let's go. We might inhibit them.

938
01:11:20,869 --> 01:11:23,442
- You want to bet?
- Major!

939
01:11:23,663 --> 01:11:26,201
Yes, you, Major Reisman!

940
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:29,121
I saw those filthy strumpets!

941
01:11:29,335 --> 01:11:32,954
You're turning this place
into a bottomless pit of vice!

942
01:11:33,298 --> 01:11:35,836
Comes Judgment Day!

943
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:38,802
And Judgment Day is coming!

944
01:11:39,804 --> 01:11:42,805
Those men, major, they'll suffer
eternal damnation...

945
01:11:42,974 --> 01:11:44,516
because of you, major!

946
01:11:44,726 --> 01:11:47,976
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

947
01:11:48,187 --> 01:11:50,394
You're on guard duty, Maggott.

948
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:13,888
Want to dance?

949
01:13:14,109 --> 01:13:15,852
There's no music.

950
01:13:16,653 --> 01:13:18,112
Try humming.

951
01:13:23,869 --> 01:13:26,442
All right, girls,
you want to lose those wraps?

952
01:13:27,747 --> 01:13:30,074
- Put on that radio.
- Make yourself at home.

953
01:13:31,252 --> 01:13:34,169
You think those guys realize
tomorrow's Mother's Day?

954
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:35,745
Is it?

955
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:44,315
Now they're doing it to music.

956
01:14:03,553 --> 01:14:06,470
- This is a restricted area, sir.
- I know that.

957
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:08,175
Two groups, three ranks in.

958
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:09,470
Open the gate.

959
01:14:09,767 --> 01:14:11,262
Come on, let's move it!

960
01:14:11,477 --> 01:14:13,185
Open this gate.

961
01:14:13,605 --> 01:14:14,767
Yes, sir.

962
01:14:19,277 --> 01:14:20,605
Hey, look at those guys.

963
01:14:21,529 --> 01:14:23,438
You can't come in here, sir!

964
01:14:23,656 --> 01:14:26,028
Sergeant, take his weapon.

965
01:14:26,743 --> 01:14:28,154
Take his weapon.

966
01:14:29,829 --> 01:14:33,578
Corporal Morgan. Sergeant, get that
rabble in some kind of order.

967
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:35,831
Yes, sir. Commander, man to man!

968
01:14:36,044 --> 01:14:38,535
Sir, you are contravening
a direct order.

969
01:14:38,755 --> 01:14:39,917
Contravening nothing!

970
01:14:40,381 --> 01:14:43,169
Fall in with the rest and
speak when you're spoken to.

971
01:14:43,384 --> 01:14:45,840
You heard what the colonel said.
Fall in!

972
01:14:46,304 --> 01:14:47,846
Come on, move it!

973
01:14:49,682 --> 01:14:51,805
All right, you heard what he said.
Fall in!

974
01:14:51,976 --> 01:14:54,894
Come on, come on!
Let's get the lead out.

975
01:14:55,313 --> 01:14:56,807
What's he all upset about?

976
01:14:56,981 --> 01:14:59,937
All right, you bunch of foul-ups.
Come on. Grab a formation.

977
01:15:00,153 --> 01:15:03,154
Fall in there!
Come on, you yard birds!

978
01:15:03,323 --> 01:15:05,648
You believe this Army?
We gotta be losing.

979
01:15:05,825 --> 01:15:08,779
Move it! What's wrong with you?
You got lead in them?

980
01:15:09,329 --> 01:15:10,788
Come on, get going!

981
01:15:10,997 --> 01:15:14,497
Hey, ain't those the jokers that
roughed you up in the latrine?

982
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:16,168
Come on!

983
01:15:16,503 --> 01:15:17,748
Hey, come on, pick it up!

984
01:15:18,839 --> 01:15:21,590
Yeah, we had Reisman all wrong.

985
01:15:21,758 --> 01:15:24,712
- Come on, move it!
- Not now. Wait for it.

986
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,346
What's going on up there?

987
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,845
Hey, you!
What are you, something special?

988
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:34,226
We gotta wait all day for you?
Come on!

989
01:15:35,605 --> 01:15:39,105
Get in position there.
Let's try and make a straight line.

990
01:15:39,276 --> 01:15:40,936
Let's look like soldiers, huh?

991
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:48,024
I told you nobody could pass.
Now, open the gate. Let's get going.

992
01:15:52,289 --> 01:15:55,622
Those are the two guys
that got Wladislaw.

993
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,746
Those are the two guys that
gave Wladislaw his lumps.

994
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:03,204
Those are the two guys
that jumped Wladislaw.

995
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,423
Those are the two guys
that banged Wladislaw.

996
01:16:06,636 --> 01:16:09,471
Those two gorillas beat up Wladislaw.

997
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:12,307
Those are the two guys...

998
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:32,699
In my opinion...

999
01:16:33,248 --> 01:16:37,080
the officer in command
of this operation...

1000
01:16:37,294 --> 01:16:42,003
has either disregarded his orders
or is flagrantly disobeying them...

1001
01:16:42,508 --> 01:16:44,085
one way or the other.

1002
01:16:44,426 --> 01:16:46,964
And that is what I am here to find out.

1003
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:49,924
All right...

1004
01:16:51,767 --> 01:16:55,599
gentlemen,
let's understand each other.

1005
01:16:56,939 --> 01:16:59,774
I'm here to find out exactly
what this is all about...

1006
01:16:59,942 --> 01:17:03,441
and I intend to do it
if it takes all day.

1007
01:17:04,404 --> 01:17:07,773
Now, you can make it easy or tough
on yourself. That's up to you.

1008
01:17:09,368 --> 01:17:13,946
Before I leave, we're going to find
out who's involved in this insanity...

1009
01:17:14,456 --> 01:17:17,291
what you're doing here and why.

1010
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,120
Is that understood?

1011
01:17:22,297 --> 01:17:23,957
All right, general.

1012
01:17:28,554 --> 01:17:30,760
What's your name, rank
and serial number?

1013
01:17:30,931 --> 01:17:32,510
You tell him, we've all had it!

1014
01:17:32,684 --> 01:17:33,935
Quiet!

1015
01:17:36,896 --> 01:17:39,019
What's your name, soldier?

1016
01:17:39,232 --> 01:17:41,687
Number Two, sir.

1017
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,900
Morgan. Clayton.

1018
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:50,981
Yes, sir?

1019
01:17:51,661 --> 01:17:55,244
Give Clayton this man's name, rank
and serial number. For all of them.

1020
01:17:55,415 --> 01:17:58,452
- I really don't know that, sir.
- Then tell him what you do know.

1021
01:17:58,669 --> 01:18:00,247
You fink, you tell him nothing!

1022
01:18:00,462 --> 01:18:03,499
- What was that talk down there?
- Nothing, sir.

1023
01:18:05,134 --> 01:18:06,794
Come here, soldier.

1024
01:18:23,194 --> 01:18:24,652
When did you bathe last?

1025
01:18:26,447 --> 01:18:28,938
- I don't remember, sir.
- You're filthy.

1026
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:32,032
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

1027
01:18:32,369 --> 01:18:34,445
Sergeant Fredericks,
get a razor and water.

1028
01:18:34,747 --> 01:18:38,791
He will demonstrate proper procedure
for shaving and bathing in the field.

1029
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:40,952
- Yes, sir.
- Right, soldier?

1030
01:18:41,128 --> 01:18:42,622
No, sir!

1031
01:18:43,214 --> 01:18:44,293
No, sir, what?

1032
01:18:44,465 --> 01:18:47,715
No, sir, I am not going to shave, sir!

1033
01:18:47,927 --> 01:18:52,388
Then we'll have to do it the hard way.
Clayton, Blake, dry-shave him.

1034
01:18:53,433 --> 01:18:54,476
Now!

1035
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:11,524
- Reisman!
- That's right!

1036
01:19:12,077 --> 01:19:14,994
You be good enough to have your
men dispose of their weapons!

1037
01:19:15,205 --> 01:19:17,910
- Sergeant Bowren!
- Sir!

1038
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:21,452
Get some special help
and get those weapons!

1039
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:24,540
Yes, sir.
All right, you heard the man!

1040
01:19:24,756 --> 01:19:26,037
Now, get moving!

1041
01:19:26,259 --> 01:19:28,216
Hit them only where it hurts.

1042
01:19:29,929 --> 01:19:32,052
- Turn it loose!
- That's great.

1043
01:19:32,265 --> 01:19:34,553
Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.

1044
01:19:34,767 --> 01:19:36,345
You Nazi!

1045
01:19:55,997 --> 01:19:57,870
I'm with you, major, all the way.

1046
01:20:05,089 --> 01:20:07,581
Don't call us, we'll call you.

1047
01:20:08,302 --> 01:20:10,294
You must be out of your mind.

1048
01:20:10,512 --> 01:20:12,386
It might seem that way.

1049
01:20:17,144 --> 01:20:20,347
Take it all back, colonel.
They aren't pretty and they can't fight.

1050
01:20:20,564 --> 01:20:21,727
They're all 4-Fs!

1051
01:20:21,899 --> 01:20:24,899
Hey, colonel, I hear they
don't even use parachutes!

1052
01:20:30,324 --> 01:20:32,316
Hey, colonel, you crybaby!

1053
01:20:34,077 --> 01:20:36,070
Don't just stand there, pick it up!

1054
01:20:36,246 --> 01:20:38,868
- Stick around for tea.
- Put some money in there.

1055
01:20:39,082 --> 01:20:40,541
Come again, colonel!

1056
01:20:40,751 --> 01:20:43,242
Stop by any time, bozo.

1057
01:20:45,255 --> 01:20:49,087
I'm sure you look upon your service
record as being highly colorful, major.

1058
01:20:49,259 --> 01:20:51,299
Well, that's not my view of it.

1059
01:20:51,929 --> 01:20:55,262
I think you know I was never in favor
of you leading this operation.

1060
01:20:55,432 --> 01:20:58,220
So I can't say that I'm disappointed
in your performance.

1061
01:20:58,436 --> 01:21:02,304
Because the impression you made on
me was unfavorable in the first place.

1062
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:05,764
You behave as if this
were a personal matter.

1063
01:21:06,402 --> 01:21:08,194
Let me assure you, it isn't.

1064
01:21:08,404 --> 01:21:11,608
What happens to you is something
to which I am indifferent.

1065
01:21:11,824 --> 01:21:14,612
But the nature of the operation
I am running is not.

1066
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,454
Colonel Breed's report
on your unit's level of achievement...

1067
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:22,455
and general behavior at the parachute
training school is entirely negative.

1068
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:24,834
It would in itself justify
my recommendation...

1069
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:26,879
that this operation be canceled.

1070
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,291
Your men will be sent back
for execution of sentence.

1071
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,591
Whether disciplinary action
should be taken against you...

1072
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,681
is a matter for General Worden here.

1073
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:40,513
I take it you don't deny your
responsibility for the fact that...

1074
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:44,816
on the night of April 14-15, a military
establishment of the U.S. Army...

1075
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,810
was the scene of a drunken party...

1076
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,479
at which no less than seven
female civilians took an active part.

1077
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:53,491
Oh, yes, sir, they took
an active part all right.

1078
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:56,530
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1079
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:00,864
Are you in a position to offer even
the remotest mitigating circumstances?

1080
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:03,532
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, sergeant, more ice.

1081
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:04,832
Yes, sir.

1082
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:06,505
Well?

1083
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,838
You offered those men a chance to get
off the hook, and they worked hard.

1084
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:14,966
Now that they're just shaping up, you're
gonna say, "Sorry, the deal's off"?

1085
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:19,007
You've only yourself to blame for that.
You brought those women to camp.

1086
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:20,685
So I broke an Army regulation.

1087
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:23,889
You're gonna kill five men
and send the rest to prison for life?

1088
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:26,141
Because if you did that...

1089
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:30,143
you'd have to lock up half
the U.S. Army, officers included.

1090
01:22:30,322 --> 01:22:32,480
Anyway, you said it yourself,
it was my fault.

1091
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,029
It's not gonna affect their ability
as soldiers.

1092
01:22:35,202 --> 01:22:38,820
Yes, well, we've heard about their
ability as soldiers from Colonel Breed.

1093
01:22:39,206 --> 01:22:40,617
That's his opinion.

1094
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:44,831
My men have crammed six months of
intensive training into as many weeks.

1095
01:22:45,046 --> 01:22:48,331
As of this moment, I'd stack them
up against any men in the Army.

1096
01:22:48,758 --> 01:22:50,335
You can't be serious.

1097
01:22:50,551 --> 01:22:53,125
You're damn right I am!
They might not be pretty...

1098
01:22:53,346 --> 01:22:55,718
but any one of mine
is worth 10 of yours.

1099
01:22:55,932 --> 01:22:59,135
- Those comparisons are hardly the point.
- It's precisely the point.

1100
01:22:59,352 --> 01:23:03,017
My contention is that my men are more
than able to handle any job given them.

1101
01:23:03,523 --> 01:23:06,892
Now, you gentlemen set this thing up.
You promised them a chance.

1102
01:23:07,068 --> 01:23:09,903
At least you can let them
show you what they're capable of.

1103
01:23:10,071 --> 01:23:12,396
I shudder to think
what they might be capable of.

1104
01:23:12,573 --> 01:23:16,405
Give them a chance to prove it, then
if they fail, your conscience is clear.

1105
01:23:17,245 --> 01:23:18,869
Tell me, major...

1106
01:23:19,705 --> 01:23:22,955
just how would you
have your men prove it?

1107
01:23:25,586 --> 01:23:26,962
It can't be done, can it?

1108
01:23:34,136 --> 01:23:36,343
Well, yes. I suppose it could.

1109
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:39,133
I mean, there might be a way.

1110
01:23:40,268 --> 01:23:42,593
What I mean is,
general, if you recall...

1111
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:45,522
next week we've got divisional
maneuvers in Devonshire.

1112
01:23:45,731 --> 01:23:46,894
Yes, yes, yes.

1113
01:23:47,108 --> 01:23:50,393
Colonel Breed's outfit will be
part of that exercise.

1114
01:23:50,903 --> 01:23:53,690
As a matter of fact,
one of his companies...

1115
01:23:53,906 --> 01:23:57,953
has been assigned the defense
of divisional headquarters.

1116
01:23:58,162 --> 01:23:59,205
So?

1117
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:02,333
So...

1118
01:24:02,959 --> 01:24:07,870
So you let my 12 men act
as an independent unit...

1119
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:10,212
attached to the opposing force.

1120
01:24:11,634 --> 01:24:15,252
And they'll knock out Breed's
headquarters and capture his entire staff.

1121
01:24:17,473 --> 01:24:18,802
That I'd like to see.

1122
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,057
So would I.

1123
01:24:45,126 --> 01:24:48,162
Charlie and Fox Companies will support
the back of the woods.

1124
01:24:48,379 --> 01:24:50,586
They'll need supplies
from the 2nd Battalion.

1125
01:24:50,757 --> 01:24:53,592
Rogers won't like that,
but I don't want to hear about it.

1126
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,002
- Yes, sir.
- How's Johnson's armor?

1127
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:59,506
They just ran through two minutes ago,
sir. The armor's all set.

1128
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:08,942
Hold it!

1129
01:25:11,402 --> 01:25:12,445
Back!

1130
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:16,784
Change!

1131
01:25:36,429 --> 01:25:38,339
You think we're gonna
get away with this?

1132
01:25:38,807 --> 01:25:43,220
Smile, you idiots! If those blue
slobs recognize us, we're in trouble.

1133
01:26:02,205 --> 01:26:05,408
Can you believe it?
They shaved.

1134
01:26:05,584 --> 01:26:07,457
How about that?

1135
01:26:07,836 --> 01:26:10,790
Get a load of the major.
He can't believe we made it.

1136
01:26:11,006 --> 01:26:14,256
- The day go fast, major?
- You're beautiful, but you're late.

1137
01:26:14,467 --> 01:26:16,507
- Got everything you need?
- Absolutely.

1138
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,796
Think you can remember the plan?

1139
01:26:19,264 --> 01:26:21,553
- So where'd you get the vehicle?
- We stole it.

1140
01:26:21,766 --> 01:26:24,174
Like we're gonna steal
everything else.

1141
01:26:24,352 --> 01:26:27,022
We're playing war games, right?
Anything else, sir?

1142
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:30,854
I guess not. All right, we'll be
with the generals at headquarters.

1143
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:34,022
From now on, you're on your own.
So take off and good luck.

1144
01:26:34,447 --> 01:26:35,941
Let's move!

1145
01:26:38,034 --> 01:26:40,026
All right, split up into three groups.

1146
01:26:54,218 --> 01:26:56,127
These two belong to you?

1147
01:27:12,152 --> 01:27:13,527
Where's General Worden?

1148
01:27:13,737 --> 01:27:16,109
Well, he's gone to check up
in the field, sir.

1149
01:27:17,407 --> 01:27:19,115
Oh, my God.

1150
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:29,954
- Well?
- Be with you in a minute, sir.

1151
01:27:34,758 --> 01:27:38,672
- Well, how about this one?
- Yes, sir. I think that's it, sir.

1152
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:43,929
Oh, that's excellent,
Haskell, excellent!

1153
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:46,138
Come on, let's go.

1154
01:28:04,122 --> 01:28:06,114
- We made it.
- Where are the others?

1155
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:09,208
8:45. Four of them ought to be
coming over that ridge soon.

1156
01:28:09,419 --> 01:28:12,124
0845? They'd better
be coming fast then.

1157
01:28:12,297 --> 01:28:16,081
The enemy is gonna lay a live barrage on
that ridge at 0850. Did you know that?

1158
01:28:16,301 --> 01:28:17,711
Yes, sir, I knew that.

1159
01:28:17,927 --> 01:28:21,296
But that's the one direction Colonel
Breed won't be looking for them.

1160
01:28:23,976 --> 01:28:26,549
- Are they all set?
- All set, sir.

1161
01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:30,270
Batteries one, three and four,
open fire and continue at will.

1162
01:28:30,482 --> 01:28:34,314
Batteries one, three and four,
open fire and continue at will.

1163
01:28:34,486 --> 01:28:36,064
Batteries one, three and four...

1164
01:28:38,991 --> 01:28:40,242
Ready!

1165
01:28:40,868 --> 01:28:41,911
Aim!

1166
01:28:42,578 --> 01:28:43,621
Fire!

1167
01:28:50,669 --> 01:28:51,784
Come on!

1168
01:28:52,004 --> 01:28:54,412
Let's go! Come on!

1169
01:29:09,564 --> 01:29:10,607
Load!

1170
01:29:13,485 --> 01:29:14,528
Now, come on!

1171
01:29:14,694 --> 01:29:17,529
- While they're reloading!
- Let's go!

1172
01:29:19,366 --> 01:29:22,153
- Down! Can't you hear it?!
- Hit it!

1173
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:41,595
Secure guards!

1174
01:29:41,805 --> 01:29:43,844
All right, let's go!

1175
01:29:50,814 --> 01:29:51,893
Let's go.

1176
01:29:59,615 --> 01:30:01,822
Now, what the hell were you
guys waiting for?

1177
01:30:02,034 --> 01:30:05,569
What do you m...?
Mean, boy?

1178
01:30:07,206 --> 01:30:10,540
Those lovers were trying
to kill us back there.

1179
01:30:12,587 --> 01:30:14,046
Change.

1180
01:30:15,006 --> 01:30:17,675
Change? What do you mean, "change"?

1181
01:30:18,426 --> 01:30:19,505
You can't do that!

1182
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:22,838
It's all right, major.
We're gonna change back later.

1183
01:30:23,389 --> 01:30:25,347
They can't stop us now.

1184
01:30:25,851 --> 01:30:27,179
Let's go.

1185
01:30:27,728 --> 01:30:29,396
Come on.

1186
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,523
We're on our way.

1187
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,566
We get across this road, take 10.

1188
01:30:53,378 --> 01:30:55,122
What are we waiting here for?

1189
01:30:55,547 --> 01:30:58,169
For a jeep, a heavy machine gun
and four men.

1190
01:31:01,303 --> 01:31:02,466
Like this one?

1191
01:31:03,263 --> 01:31:04,306
Slow down.

1192
01:31:05,015 --> 01:31:06,474
Ten-hut!

1193
01:31:14,149 --> 01:31:15,691
Good afternoon, general.

1194
01:31:25,411 --> 01:31:27,119
The Mafia has landed!

1195
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:29,561
- Whatever Franko says, Franko does!
- Machine gun.

1196
01:31:29,666 --> 01:31:31,374
Let's get it out. Move it out.

1197
01:31:31,584 --> 01:31:33,493
- Come on, snap it up.
- Franko, out!

1198
01:31:34,045 --> 01:31:36,002
Out? What do you mean, "out"?

1199
01:31:36,172 --> 01:31:39,173
- Who do you think stole this thing?
- You did, my boy.

1200
01:31:39,676 --> 01:31:43,924
Look, you and Pinkley are the only guys
that Colonel Breed got a good look at.

1201
01:31:44,181 --> 01:31:47,182
This operation is a big enough risk
without you coming along.

1202
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:49,640
- Out.
- Come on, Franko.

1203
01:31:51,188 --> 01:31:54,106
Jefferson, you have until 0930
to show up with the ambulance.

1204
01:31:54,316 --> 01:31:56,523
You don't make it,
I'll figure you got nailed.

1205
01:31:56,694 --> 01:31:58,935
- Then we'll take a whack at plan B.
- Right.

1206
01:32:00,072 --> 01:32:01,815
So long, major.

1207
01:32:04,577 --> 01:32:06,865
Hold on, Maggott.
Don't want to lose you now.

1208
01:32:09,373 --> 01:32:11,413
Attention!

1209
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,335
Attention.

1210
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:17,339
Ten-hut!

1211
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:22,376
- Morning, Breed.
- Morning. Quite a surprise.

1212
01:32:22,553 --> 01:32:25,554
- Everything under control?
- I think you could say that, sir.

1213
01:32:25,723 --> 01:32:28,593
Good, good.
At ease, gentlemen, at ease.

1214
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:32,095
Just thought I'd drop by to see
how things are shaping up.

1215
01:32:32,396 --> 01:32:34,852
So this is what it looks like, huh?

1216
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:42,028
Come on, push!

1217
01:32:45,618 --> 01:32:48,239
- Posey, remember, you're hurt.
- Oh, I'm dying.

1218
01:32:48,454 --> 01:32:49,616
Come on, Maggott.

1219
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:53,661
Stand back, now.

1220
01:33:03,846 --> 01:33:05,969
- What's that?
- Over there!

1221
01:33:08,059 --> 01:33:11,428
- What was that?
- Down the road, sir. See that smoke?

1222
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:14,558
- Sergeant, have somebody take a look.
- Yes, sir.

1223
01:33:14,774 --> 01:33:18,059
- What are they doing around that ridge?
- I don't know, sir.

1224
01:33:18,277 --> 01:33:21,693
That should've been cleared
half an hour ago.

1225
01:33:21,906 --> 01:33:25,191
Now, colonel, it sure doesn't look like
it's been cleared, does it?

1226
01:33:25,368 --> 01:33:26,410
Let's go.

1227
01:33:31,290 --> 01:33:34,790
- Posey, remember, you're injured.
- Gilpin, you forgot the ketchup.

1228
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:36,870
- Help!
- Come on.

1229
01:33:53,104 --> 01:33:54,146
Sir?

1230
01:33:57,483 --> 01:34:00,484
We got a man that's hurt bad.
We'd like to call an ambulance.

1231
01:34:00,653 --> 01:34:02,610
Call an ambulance.
Go see what happened.

1232
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:05,615
- Yes, sir. Come on, you two.
- Private?

1233
01:34:05,992 --> 01:34:08,031
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

1234
01:34:08,244 --> 01:34:09,904
What were you doing on that road?

1235
01:34:10,121 --> 01:34:12,327
Our jeep got a flat tire.
We went into a ditch.

1236
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:17,331
I didn't ask you that. I asked you
what you were doing on that road.

1237
01:34:17,504 --> 01:34:19,663
Spotting for the Field Artillery, sir.

1238
01:34:24,554 --> 01:34:25,633
Let's see that map.

1239
01:34:25,805 --> 01:34:27,347
Move Able, Charlie Company to...

1240
01:34:27,557 --> 01:34:29,431
the bridge under smoke screen.

1241
01:34:29,642 --> 01:34:33,854
Baker Company bank towards
the ridge at 1420 hours.

1242
01:34:34,022 --> 01:34:37,355
- Private. Come here.
- Yes, sir.

1243
01:34:39,652 --> 01:34:41,063
What's your name and outfit?

1244
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:42,738
Private Matthew Donald, sir.

1245
01:34:42,947 --> 01:34:47,942
Serial number 726256.
Battery B, 526th Field Artillery, sir.

1246
01:34:48,161 --> 01:34:51,162
- Where are your orders?
- Right here, sir.

1247
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:55,032
From Captain Thornhill, sir.

1248
01:34:58,046 --> 01:35:00,881
I know most of the men
under my command.

1249
01:35:02,217 --> 01:35:04,126
But I don't recall seeing you before.

1250
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:07,428
No, sir.
I was transferred in last week, sir.

1251
01:35:11,643 --> 01:35:15,687
We're getting congested at point B.
Two forces have mined the road.

1252
01:35:15,855 --> 01:35:17,433
- Where's Peterson?
- Here it comes!

1253
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:23,730
Clear the way!

1254
01:35:24,155 --> 01:35:25,566
Looks like somebody got hurt.

1255
01:35:28,743 --> 01:35:30,321
Watch it there!

1256
01:35:31,579 --> 01:35:34,071
Okay, let's have some help
with this soldier.

1257
01:35:35,668 --> 01:35:38,871
Count of three, lift. One, two, lift.

1258
01:35:40,256 --> 01:35:41,750
Take it easy now.

1259
01:35:44,218 --> 01:35:47,088
- Where do we put him, sir?
- Put him there.

1260
01:35:49,848 --> 01:35:53,468
- You can stay, but keep out of the way.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1261
01:36:22,799 --> 01:36:25,373
Sorry, but this is the end
of the line for you.

1262
01:36:25,594 --> 01:36:27,752
But we got a bad accident
down here, sir.

1263
01:36:27,971 --> 01:36:31,885
That's too bad, because you just
became prisoners of war.

1264
01:36:35,896 --> 01:36:37,141
It's the enemy, sir!

1265
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:39,266
All right, come on, let's go.

1266
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:42,394
Let's go, let's go.

1267
01:36:44,529 --> 01:36:46,189
They can't do that.

1268
01:36:48,909 --> 01:36:50,570
You're wearing Red Force insignia.

1269
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,445
That's right. We're traitors.

1270
01:36:53,623 --> 01:36:56,161
- Watch my finger.
- They use real bullets, you idiot!

1271
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:58,202
Now, look here, I'm a doctor, major.

1272
01:36:58,419 --> 01:37:00,708
And I'm a major, captain.

1273
01:37:00,922 --> 01:37:04,504
Yes, sir, but we had a radio message.
There's a man badly hurt down there.

1274
01:37:04,675 --> 01:37:05,718
Hurry it up!

1275
01:37:05,927 --> 01:37:08,678
Here's our permission to cross
all lines and roadblocks.

1276
01:37:09,305 --> 01:37:12,756
Very cute idea, captain.
But it won't work. Get out.

1277
01:37:13,142 --> 01:37:16,891
But it's not a gag, sir.
There's a real casualty there.

1278
01:37:17,104 --> 01:37:18,515
All set back here, Jefferson.

1279
01:37:18,731 --> 01:37:21,021
Sir, will you explain
the rules to him?

1280
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:22,314
The man may be dying.

1281
01:37:22,527 --> 01:37:25,149
I'm just an observer, captain,
not an umpire.

1282
01:37:25,364 --> 01:37:27,937
I can't interfere
or make any rulings.

1283
01:37:28,534 --> 01:37:30,941
Come on, doc,
I've got a sick tree back here.

1284
01:37:31,161 --> 01:37:32,821
Come on, you too.

1285
01:37:33,038 --> 01:37:36,372
She's blond, she's engaged.
Come on, sugar!

1286
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,703
- Got your bracelet right here.
- What's the matter?

1287
01:37:39,878 --> 01:37:42,416
Come on, Little Red Riding Hood.

1288
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:45,298
You're really gonna enjoy this.

1289
01:37:48,053 --> 01:37:49,880
How about this patient, huh, doc?

1290
01:37:50,847 --> 01:37:53,089
You're really gonna enjoy it here, doc.

1291
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:54,844
Come on, men. What about 0930?

1292
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:57,895
All right, take out the blue bands.
Let's go!

1293
01:37:58,105 --> 01:37:59,563
Change to the blue armband!

1294
01:37:59,731 --> 01:38:00,894
What about the prisoners?

1295
01:38:01,108 --> 01:38:04,726
Sorry, major. We can't spare any men
to look after prisoners.

1296
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,602
You coming?

1297
01:38:25,717 --> 01:38:28,255
- Is he trying to kill us?
- We must be going 120.

1298
01:38:28,469 --> 01:38:30,379
He's gonna squash us
in this sardine can.

1299
01:38:30,597 --> 01:38:33,052
You want to be there by 0930,
don't you?

1300
01:38:33,224 --> 01:38:34,267
Yeah.

1301
01:38:35,143 --> 01:38:39,223
- Pulling back the map reference,
397492.

1302
01:38:39,439 --> 01:38:40,767
That's Blue Force crew.

1303
01:38:41,733 --> 01:38:44,852
Call in company orders and hit them
when they reach crossroads.

1304
01:38:45,069 --> 01:38:46,267
Hello, Able 3.

1305
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:49,275
Don't worry, Bill. They called
for the ambulance.

1306
01:39:03,214 --> 01:39:06,131
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yes, it will.

1307
01:39:07,635 --> 01:39:09,461
It's gonna be all right.

1308
01:39:09,678 --> 01:39:13,593
I want a strike on Hill 80
between them at 1400 hours.

1309
01:39:13,766 --> 01:39:16,932
Move them up to the base of the hill
and keep their heads down.

1310
01:39:17,144 --> 01:39:21,806
Well, thanks very much, colonel.
It's been very instructive.

1311
01:39:21,982 --> 01:39:25,186
I think I'll take a little ride now
and get the overall picture.

1312
01:39:25,403 --> 01:39:27,147
Yes, sir, thank you.

1313
01:39:37,624 --> 01:39:39,498
Move it over. Give them room.

1314
01:40:20,501 --> 01:40:23,336
Forward observation report.
Blue Force tanks approaching...

1315
01:40:23,504 --> 01:40:25,378
airfield at map reference...

1316
01:40:26,591 --> 01:40:27,966
Out of the way!

1317
01:40:30,094 --> 01:40:31,553
Out of the way!

1318
01:40:36,934 --> 01:40:38,642
Come on.
Watch out for the ambulance!

1319
01:40:47,905 --> 01:40:50,775
There he is. The old man.

1320
01:40:54,995 --> 01:40:56,573
Come on, observers!

1321
01:41:07,424 --> 01:41:09,333
Major Reisman's compliments, sir.

1322
01:41:18,018 --> 01:41:22,644
Hey, major. What do you think
about that one, major?

1323
01:41:22,814 --> 01:41:26,598
I didn't wanna tell you before because
I thought it might make you nervous.

1324
01:41:26,777 --> 01:41:29,943
After our last little party,
the generals were all in favor...

1325
01:41:30,155 --> 01:41:32,444
of sending you back to finish
your sentences.

1326
01:41:32,658 --> 01:41:34,615
- Or get hung.
- Or get hung.

1327
01:41:34,785 --> 01:41:35,827
Or get hung.

1328
01:41:36,328 --> 01:41:38,237
But I made a deal with them.

1329
01:41:38,622 --> 01:41:42,667
Knocking off Breed's headquarters
is what got you guys off the hook.

1330
01:41:46,797 --> 01:41:48,874
You weren't really worried,
were you, major?

1331
01:41:49,092 --> 01:41:50,752
No, not much, he wasn't.

1332
01:41:50,969 --> 01:41:53,210
But we still have
one operation to go.

1333
01:41:53,429 --> 01:41:57,973
If you guys foul up on this one, none
of us will ever play the violin again.

1334
01:41:58,185 --> 01:42:00,427
Because up until now,
it's all been a game.

1335
01:42:00,604 --> 01:42:03,226
But as of tomorrow night,
it's gonna be the real thing.

1336
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,516
If you want to know how real,
I'll tell you.

1337
01:42:05,734 --> 01:42:08,819
It's my guess the lot of you guys
won't be coming back.

1338
01:42:08,988 --> 01:42:11,111
But there's no sense in squawking
about that.

1339
01:42:11,282 --> 01:42:12,990
Because the Army never did love you.

1340
01:42:13,158 --> 01:42:15,032
Besides, you all volunteered, right?

1341
01:42:15,244 --> 01:42:17,996
- Yeah.
- Well, that's more than I did.

1342
01:42:18,914 --> 01:42:20,492
Sergeant Bowren.

1343
01:42:21,333 --> 01:42:23,907
Look, I know we've been over this
a thousand times...

1344
01:42:24,086 --> 01:42:27,004
but a lot can go wrong.
We gotta be prepared to improvise.

1345
01:42:27,172 --> 01:42:30,173
So let's see what happens
if everything goes right. Ready?

1346
01:42:30,384 --> 01:42:33,171
- One.
- At the roadblock, we've just begun.

1347
01:42:33,387 --> 01:42:36,886
- One.
- At the roadblock, we've just begun.

1348
01:42:37,099 --> 01:42:39,388
- Two.
- The guards are through.

1349
01:42:39,602 --> 01:42:42,721
- Three.
- The major's men are on a spree.

1350
01:42:42,938 --> 01:42:46,058
- Four.
- Major and Wladislaw through the door.

1351
01:42:46,275 --> 01:42:49,774
- Five.
- Pinkley stays out in the drive.

1352
01:42:49,987 --> 01:42:53,356
- Six.
- The major gives the rope a fix.

1353
01:42:53,574 --> 01:42:56,777
- Seven.
- Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven.

1354
01:42:57,620 --> 01:43:01,035
- Eight.
- Jiminez has got a date.

1355
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:05,205
- Nine.
- The other guys go up the line.

1356
01:43:06,003 --> 01:43:09,586
- Ten.
- Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen.

1357
01:43:09,798 --> 01:43:13,084
- Eleven.
- Posey guards points five and seven.

1358
01:43:13,761 --> 01:43:17,712
- Twelve.
- Wladislaw and major go down to delve.

1359
01:43:18,267 --> 01:43:19,465
And where's Donald Duck?

1360
01:43:20,436 --> 01:43:23,105
Donald Duck's down at the crossroads
with a machine gun.

1361
01:43:23,522 --> 01:43:26,274
And he'd better not be asleep,
or we'll all be in trouble.

1362
01:43:28,236 --> 01:43:31,901
- Thirteen.
- Franko goes up without being seen.

1363
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:34,613
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.

1364
01:43:34,909 --> 01:43:37,661
- And?
- Mayonnaise cuts the cable...

1365
01:43:37,828 --> 01:43:39,620
Franko cuts the phone.

1366
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:41,455
- Fifteen.
- Franko goes in...

1367
01:43:41,624 --> 01:43:43,083
where the others have been.

1368
01:43:43,501 --> 01:43:47,830
- Sixteen.
- We all come out like it's Halloween.

1369
01:43:49,423 --> 01:43:51,250
And kill every officer in sight.

1370
01:43:51,425 --> 01:43:52,836
Ours or theirs?

1371
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:54,884
Well, let's start off with theirs, huh?

1372
01:43:55,096 --> 01:43:57,634
Let's take it again from the top,
without the ad-libs.

1373
01:43:57,848 --> 01:44:01,467
- All right, one.
- Down the roadblock, we've just begun.

1374
01:44:01,686 --> 01:44:04,603
- Two.
- The guards are through.

1375
01:44:04,772 --> 01:44:08,058
- Three.
- The major's men are on a spree.

1376
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:10,933
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.

1377
01:44:11,153 --> 01:44:14,024
- And?
- Mayonnaise cuts the cable...

1378
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,948
Franko cuts the phone.

1379
01:44:16,117 --> 01:44:18,074
- Fifteen.
- Franko goes in...

1380
01:44:18,244 --> 01:44:19,821
where the others have been.

1381
01:44:20,288 --> 01:44:24,499
- Sixteen.
- We all come out like it's Halloween.

1382
01:44:24,709 --> 01:44:26,618
Seventeen?

1383
01:44:26,794 --> 01:44:29,629
Seventeen. D-day.

1384
01:44:30,172 --> 01:44:33,009
We get out as best we can
and make our way to the coast.

1385
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,461
And hope that the entire invasion
hasn't been a total disaster.

1386
01:44:37,681 --> 01:44:39,970
Otherwise, we got a long swim home.

1387
01:44:40,559 --> 01:44:42,302
How much longer, major?

1388
01:44:42,477 --> 01:44:43,888
I'll ask the driver.

1389
01:44:50,904 --> 01:44:53,573
You're not worried about jumping
at night, are you?

1390
01:44:56,284 --> 01:44:57,778
Getting back.

1391
01:45:05,376 --> 01:45:06,419
Ready.

1392
01:45:11,341 --> 01:45:12,592
Cargo.

1393
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:25,063
Go.

1394
01:45:40,536 --> 01:45:43,787
- Where have you been? We're late.
- We've been looking for Jiminez.

1395
01:45:44,123 --> 01:45:47,160
- And?
- We found him hung up in an apple tree.

1396
01:45:47,377 --> 01:45:50,129
- His neck's broken.
- You mean he's dead?

1397
01:45:50,339 --> 01:45:52,581
That's exactly what I mean.

1398
01:45:54,885 --> 01:45:56,130
- This far.
- Yeah.

1399
01:45:59,056 --> 01:46:02,591
All right, Franko, now you know why
we all checked out on that rope, huh?

1400
01:46:06,355 --> 01:46:07,897
Gilpin, number eight.

1401
01:46:08,107 --> 01:46:10,230
Gilpin, did you hear me?

1402
01:46:10,401 --> 01:46:12,974
- Eight.
- Gilpin's got a date?

1403
01:46:16,156 --> 01:46:18,233
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.

1404
01:46:18,451 --> 01:46:20,693
- And?
- Gilpin cuts the cables...

1405
01:46:20,912 --> 01:46:23,284
Franko cuts the phone.
- Let's go.

1406
01:46:32,132 --> 01:46:35,797
- What a great way to start out, huh?
- Yeah.

1407
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,953
So far, so good, major.

1408
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:52,141
Where are those guys?

1409
01:48:54,652 --> 01:48:56,111
Here they come.

1410
01:48:58,656 --> 01:49:00,150
Let's go.

1411
01:49:17,009 --> 01:49:18,918
Come on, Pinkley, let's go.

1412
01:49:54,256 --> 01:49:57,091
It's just like the major
said it would be.

1413
01:49:57,425 --> 01:50:00,925
Yeah, really some spread, ain't it?

1414
01:50:02,764 --> 01:50:04,223
There they go now.

1415
01:50:24,661 --> 01:50:27,615
- No blackout?
- Think they're expecting us?

1416
01:50:27,789 --> 01:50:29,449
Hey, the silencer!

1417
01:51:43,408 --> 01:51:44,819
Let's go.

1418
01:52:42,386 --> 01:52:44,129
"Radio room."

1419
01:53:03,616 --> 01:53:06,285
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

1420
01:53:09,538 --> 01:53:11,531
I don't know how many
Germans we'll kill...

1421
01:53:11,749 --> 01:53:13,955
but we're gonna make
an awful lot of noise.

1422
01:53:15,586 --> 01:53:17,958
Hey, do you believe
in stuff like that?

1423
01:53:19,256 --> 01:53:21,296
Oh, I don't know, can't hurt nothing.

1424
01:53:22,426 --> 01:53:24,715
I don't think I believe
in stuff like that.

1425
01:54:22,947 --> 01:54:26,398
- So, how's your German holding up?
- Oh, man, I don't know.

1426
01:54:26,576 --> 01:54:28,864
You know those two guys
walking down the stairs?

1427
01:54:29,036 --> 01:54:30,863
I couldn't understand
a word they said.

1428
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:34,164
- Just act mean and grunt, huh?
- Yeah.

1429
01:54:35,835 --> 01:54:37,662
Okay, Room 11.

1430
01:55:06,283 --> 01:55:07,326
So?

1431
01:55:08,493 --> 01:55:11,031
You go first, I'll carry the bags.

1432
01:55:39,025 --> 01:55:40,733
We'll set it up here.

1433
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:28,283
- They should've been here by now.
- Yeah.

1434
01:57:10,243 --> 01:57:11,494
Guard!

1435
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:33,216
I left the rope.

1436
01:58:34,621 --> 01:58:36,290
Hold it.

1437
01:58:50,096 --> 01:58:51,347
Idiot.

1438
01:58:54,559 --> 01:58:57,429
- Do it, Polack!
- Shut up.

1439
01:59:01,482 --> 01:59:02,858
Hurry up.

1440
01:59:42,566 --> 01:59:43,609
Now.

1441
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,363
Now.

1442
02:00:01,169 --> 02:00:02,829
Ready for the turkey shoot?

1443
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:11,358
I wish I could read this.
I think it's dirty.

1444
02:02:55,889 --> 02:02:57,681
Hey! What are you doing?

1445
02:02:57,891 --> 02:03:01,391
Franko and the others
are still down there. Come on!

1446
02:03:41,435 --> 02:03:42,550
Hey, Maggott.

1447
02:03:42,770 --> 02:03:45,177
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of sight.

1448
02:05:14,698 --> 02:05:16,026
Wolfgang?

1449
02:05:17,826 --> 02:05:18,869
Wolfgang?

1450
02:05:22,331 --> 02:05:23,373
Wolfgang?

1451
02:06:56,385 --> 02:06:57,583
Scream.

1452
02:07:01,807 --> 02:07:03,182
Scream.

1453
02:07:04,643 --> 02:07:07,313
Scream, you slut.

1454
02:07:07,563 --> 02:07:09,686
<i>Sprechen,</i> you harlot.

1455
02:07:09,983 --> 02:07:11,311
Scream.

1456
02:07:35,258 --> 02:07:36,539
Radio room.

1457
02:08:53,046 --> 02:08:55,881
Blow it! Blow it!

1458
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:45,343
- Hey, what's going on?
- Shut up.

1459
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:02,541
It's Judgment Day, you sinners.

1460
02:11:03,138 --> 02:11:04,549
Come out.

1461
02:11:05,223 --> 02:11:07,180
Come out, wherever you are.

1462
02:11:12,188 --> 02:11:14,065
Come out.

1463
02:11:14,733 --> 02:11:16,061
Come out.

1464
02:12:58,214 --> 02:12:59,257
Now!

1465
02:13:17,067 --> 02:13:19,985
- You didn't think about that, did you?
- They gotta breathe.

1466
02:13:50,809 --> 02:13:52,352
You got the grenades?

1467
02:13:53,479 --> 02:13:54,641
Right. Right, sir.

1468
02:13:55,272 --> 02:13:57,395
We got enough here
to blow up the world.

1469
02:14:15,293 --> 02:14:17,500
What are we gonna do about them?

1470
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:21,087
We'll feed the French
and kill the Germans.

1471
02:14:23,593 --> 02:14:26,345
- Franko, cover that corner.
- What happened?

1472
02:14:26,513 --> 02:14:30,345
They're locked in the bunker. There's
gotta be some air vents. Take a look.

1473
02:14:30,558 --> 02:14:32,717
All right, bring your grenades!
Over here!

1474
02:14:32,936 --> 02:14:34,478
I'll take them.

1475
02:14:45,241 --> 02:14:46,652
Here they are.

1476
02:14:52,873 --> 02:14:54,416
Take it down there.

1477
02:14:56,335 --> 02:14:57,913
Bowren, get Vladek out here.

1478
02:15:00,923 --> 02:15:02,667
Where's that coming from?

1479
02:15:09,932 --> 02:15:11,391
Come on, Vladek, we need you.

1480
02:15:12,727 --> 02:15:14,387
Come on, come on.

1481
02:15:18,232 --> 02:15:21,850
Franko! Get over here and see
if you can start one of those trucks!

1482
02:15:40,339 --> 02:15:44,206
Wladislaw, Jefferson. Get the lids
off those other ventilators.

1483
02:15:49,348 --> 02:15:51,554
You know what you gotta do, so do it.
Hurry up!

1484
02:16:04,237 --> 02:16:06,230
All right, you Frenchies, beat it.

1485
02:16:27,595 --> 02:16:29,671
No, it's all right. It's all right. Go on.

1486
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:38,478
Get back up there
and cover that bridge!

1487
02:16:41,068 --> 02:16:42,348
Move it!

1488
02:16:50,286 --> 02:16:51,566
Help Bowren!

1489
02:17:16,312 --> 02:17:17,722
There they are!

1490
02:17:37,626 --> 02:17:39,583
Hurry it up. Posey's got trouble!

1491
02:17:45,425 --> 02:17:47,833
Get one of those trucks started!

1492
02:17:57,604 --> 02:18:01,056
No, no, no. Leave the pins in.
The pins in, huh?

1493
02:18:28,427 --> 02:18:30,669
Bowren, get some gasoline.

1494
02:18:31,555 --> 02:18:33,133
Some gasoline?

1495
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:34,642
Are you sure?

1496
02:18:35,226 --> 02:18:37,799
You want to ask Pinkley and Vladek?
Now, get going!

1497
02:18:40,273 --> 02:18:41,387
Yes, sir.

1498
02:19:15,602 --> 02:19:17,808
Sawyer, Lever, cover that bridge!

1499
02:19:18,104 --> 02:19:20,809
Do you believe these guys?
They keep these things locked.

1500
02:19:21,024 --> 02:19:22,518
Keep looking!

1501
02:19:30,199 --> 02:19:31,777
The other road! The other road!

1502
02:20:23,795 --> 02:20:26,167
Come on, baby.
Where are you, baby?

1503
02:20:44,192 --> 02:20:45,567
Let's go!

1504
02:20:49,155 --> 02:20:50,318
Move over.

1505
02:20:50,532 --> 02:20:52,192
Move over!

1506
02:20:52,951 --> 02:20:54,410
Wladislaw...

1507
02:20:54,619 --> 02:20:56,742
get Vladek out of there, huh?

1508
02:21:33,742 --> 02:21:35,117
Another flare! Another flare!

1509
02:21:46,087 --> 02:21:47,463
Come on, you...

1510
02:21:48,757 --> 02:21:51,213
Jefferson! When I give you the signal...

1511
02:21:51,385 --> 02:21:54,968
set them off one, two, three, four,
and get the hell out of there.

1512
02:21:55,181 --> 02:21:57,055
We'll wait for you at the bridge.

1513
02:21:57,266 --> 02:21:58,595
- Right?
- Right.

1514
02:22:02,772 --> 02:22:03,886
Let's go!

1515
02:22:13,533 --> 02:22:16,024
Come on, let's go.
Come on, hurry up!

1516
02:22:40,060 --> 02:22:41,388
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1517
02:22:41,603 --> 02:22:43,810
Jefferson, set them off!

1518
02:22:44,147 --> 02:22:46,983
Get that thing out of here
or we'll all go up!

1519
02:23:12,677 --> 02:23:14,005
Let's go.

1520
02:23:19,183 --> 02:23:20,843
They're not gonna make it.

1521
02:23:21,978 --> 02:23:25,014
We'll get a boat and get out
the other side. Come on, let's go.

1522
02:24:02,728 --> 02:24:04,721
All right, blow it!

1523
02:24:07,191 --> 02:24:10,476
Remember, Jefferson, 20 seconds!

1524
02:24:16,617 --> 02:24:17,660
Run!

1525
02:24:18,369 --> 02:24:20,029
- Faster, faster.
- Come on! Come on!

1526
02:24:20,245 --> 02:24:21,740
Jefferson faster.

1527
02:24:21,914 --> 02:24:24,916
Come on, Jefferson. Run!

1528
02:24:25,126 --> 02:24:26,241
- Go!
- Hurry up!

1529
02:24:26,419 --> 02:24:29,254
- Come on, move!

Jefferson!

1533
02:25:30,776 --> 02:25:32,021
Come on, start.

1534
02:25:33,362 --> 02:25:36,482
It won't start! It won't start!
The bastard won't start!

All right, get in!

1536
02:26:41,641 --> 02:26:44,214
Shift! Shift it, shift it!

1537
02:27:28,522 --> 02:27:29,933
We made it!

1538
02:27:30,107 --> 02:27:33,310
We made it. Those stupid bastards,
we made it!

1539

Come on! Keep shooting!

1540

1542
02:27:55,299 --> 02:27:58,216
<i>perhaps the most objective</i>
<i>is the one by General Worden...</i>

1543
02:27:58,385 --> 02:27:59,927
<i>in which he states:</i>

1544
02:28:00,095 --> 02:28:03,014
<i>"We are recommending that those</i>
<i>members of the group known...</i>

1545
02:28:03,183 --> 02:28:05,756
<i>as 'The Dirty Dozen ' who survived</i>
<i>this operation...</i>

1546
02:28:05,935 --> 02:28:08,343
<i>should have their records</i>
<i>amended to indicate...</i>

1547
02:28:08,521 --> 02:28:11,890
<i>that they are being returned</i>
<i>to active duty at their former ranks.</i>

1548
02:28:12,275 --> 02:28:16,144
<i>And that the next of kin of those</i>
<i>prisoners who were killed be advised...</i>

1549
02:28:16,322 --> 02:28:19,821
<i>that they lost their lives

1550
02:28:20,159 --> 02:28:21,653
You did a fine job, major.

1551
02:28:24,413 --> 02:28:25,658
I'll see you around.

1552
02:28:26,332 --> 02:28:28,455

1553

Hurry up and get well.
We need men like you out there.

1554
02:28:46,143 --> 02:28:47,851
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

1555
02:28:48,167 --> 02:28:51,154
Killing generals could get to be
a habit with me.
