1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,377
Take a letter to
Paramount Studios, Hollywood.

3
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,880
Gentlemen, I've read
the book of your show,

4
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,509
and as your legal advisor,
I'm writing to let you know...

5
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,883
that it really
can't be done.

6
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,890
I know it's all in fun,
but there is a state
called Louisiana,

7
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,893
and anyone can tell that
they're gonna be sore as...

8
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,896
Well, you won't
get away with it.
They'll sue you...

9
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,398
and the writers
and the actors too.

10
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:50,403
Because there are laws,
laws that specifically
say...

11
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:52,700
you can't write a book
or a play...

12
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:55,367
based on characters
living today.

13
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,535
Yes, the cast
will go to jail,

14
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,045
of that I have no doubt.

15
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:03,049
But speaking
as your attorney...

16
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:06,587
? Let me say that
there is a way out ?

17
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,452
? You can make
the whole thing legal ?

18
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:12,856
? Without changing
a line in your book ?

19
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:15,725
? It can still be
Louisiana ?

20
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,095
? You can call
a crook a crook ?

21
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,692
? But you must say
it's based on fiction ?

22
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:27,707
? And everything
will be fine ?

23
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:33,111
? Yours truly
Sam Horowitz ?

24
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:40,052
? Of Rafferty, Driscoll
and O'Brien ?

25
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:49,122
? Before the picture starts
we say with all our hearts ?

26
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,667
? The characters portrayed
in our musical charade ?

27
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:57,727
? Have not been based on
persons living or dead ?

28
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:01,832
? They've all been made up
out of the author's head ?

29
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:06,277
? The politicians
we investigate ?

30
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:10,374
? Could come from Kansas
Maine or Indiana ?

31
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:15,047
? So we laid our story
in the mythical state ?

32
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:19,354
? A mythical state
we call Louisiana ?

33
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,362
? Within our simple plot
you'll notice quite a lot ?

34
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:29,835
? Of references to crooks
who have monkeyed with
their books ?

35
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:32,702
? The law says
shows like this one ?

36
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:35,571
? Can get by
with one restriction ?

37
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,838
? It must be fiction ?

38
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:41,404
? We've tried to stay
within the law ?

39
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:44,212
? That's why
we laid the scenes ?

40
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,344
? In New Orleans ?

41
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:51,118
? A city we've invented so that
there would be no fuss ?

42
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:56,026
? If there is such a place
it's certainly news to us ?

43
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,123
? Yes, it's certainly
certainly news to us ?

44
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,168
? Mythical, mythical
fiction, fiction ?

45
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,261
? Mythical, mythical
fiction, fiction ?

46
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:08,638
? Mythical fiction,
mythical fiction, ah ??

47
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:49,148
Ohh.
You're tellin' me. Huh!

48
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,150
Where's Whitfield?

49
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:54,153
I've got to get back
to the commencement
exercises.

50
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,655
Oh, no, you don't. We're
all in on this together.

51
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:58,658
Now, keep calm, son.
Keep calm.

52
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,194
We've been investigated before,
and we'll be investigated again.

53
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,696
Yeah, but we've never had
Oliver P. Loganberry before.

54
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,700
They don't call him the watchdog
of the senate for nothin'.

55
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,963
Senator Loganberry.
Where does he
hail from?

56
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,834
[Young Man]
Some New England state.

57
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,067
I thought so. Nothin' but
a doggone Yankee carpetbagger.

58
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:19,442
He'll give us
a fair trial.
If we get a
fair trial, they'll hang us.

59
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,515
But think
of the college.

60
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:24,414
If it ever comes out
that the head of the
English department...

61
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,316
signs his name
with an "X"...

62
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,254
Well, let's drink up.
They tell me the liquor
at Leavenworth...

63
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:31,257
ain't fit for man
nor beast.

64
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:34,294
[Door Opening]

65
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:39,131
Well, Captain Whitfield,
I'm glad you're here.

66
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:43,135
I always feel a lot safer
with the police force around.

67
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,673
Well, boys,
we're in for it.
We're in for it?

68
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:51,211
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Don't pin it on me.

69
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:54,076
But after all,
they expect it
from you, Captain.

70
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:56,878
What? Whose idea was it...

71
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:00,147
to make the football team
share their salaries with us?

72
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:03,655
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
don't let's fight
among ourselves.

73
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,487
A house divided
must fall.

74
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:08,426
If it's gotta fall,
let it fall on Jim Taylor.

75
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:12,158
Taylor?
But he doesn't know
what's going on.

76
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,235
That's the point.
Being innocent,
he won't seem guilty...

77
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,668
when they get him
on the stand.
That's right.

78
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,673
We made him president
of the Louisiana
Purchasing Company.

79
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,676
We even got him elected
to the state legislature.

80
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:26,975
And what's he ever done?
Nothing but sit on his seat
at the state capitol,

81
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:30,915
taking our honest money
and acting like a big shot
while we do the dirty work.

82
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,919
We put him in there
in case a situation
like this came up.

83
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,251
Now let him
earn his keep.

84
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:39,326
You'd better figure
something out quick.
He'll be here any minute.

85
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:42,328
It's simple. Jim Taylor
gave us his power
of attorney, didn't he?

86
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,627
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Every deal we've made,
we've made in his name.

87
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,701
Hello, Mr. Taylor.
Hello, Sam.

88
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:51,203
With you home again,
New Orleans looks
more like New Orleans.

89
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,705
What did it look like
without me?
[Both]
New Orleans!

90
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,969
I'll be back
in a few minutes, boys.
Here's the cards.

91
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:58,477
Play a little rummy.
Cut out the gin this time.
Yes, sir.

92
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,139
Hello, Jim.
Glad you're back.
So am I. Thanks.

93
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,986
Hello.

94
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,653
Hello.
[Laughter]

95
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,727
Whoa,
that's wonderful!

96
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,324
Well, hello, fellas.
What's cooking?

97
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,458
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.

98
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,537
Well, well...

99
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:27,404
nothing's changed.
You're just the way I left you.

100
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,703
Jim, I have
bad news for you.

101
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,005
Looks like
your trial's
coming up.

102
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:34,013
My trial?

103
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:37,846
[Captain]
You know, for all that lumber
you sold the college?

104
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,682
When did I sell
the college lumber?

105
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:43,689
The day after you left.
Oh, we paid
for it, all right,

106
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,419
but the following month
you sent the college
another bill,

107
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,985
and through some mistake,
the college paid your
company again.

108
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:53,555
Wait a minute. Why do you
keep calling it my company?

109
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:55,568
It is your company.

110
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,865
We used your power of attorney
to put it all in your name.

111
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:01,635
Maybe if I sent back
the second check with
a sweet little note...

112
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,768
they might think
it's an oversight?
We could
explain the second check.

113
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,076
What you've got
to worry about
is the third check.

114
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:11,174
Yeah... I do?

115
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,253
Uh...

116
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,790
does anybody got a funnel?

117
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,393
How much lumber
did I sell the college?

118
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,056
$25,000 worth.

119
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,125
$25,000 worth?
Say, the Louisiana
Purchasing Company...

120
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,637
wasn't in the lumber
business when I left.

121
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,173
Where did I get all
that wood?
It's a little
complicated.

122
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:37,210
You remember the lumber
the government gave
the city...

123
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,972
to build
that new high school?

124
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,140
Don't tell me I swiped
the lumber from the government.

125
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,913
You shouldn't have done it.
Why monkey with
the federal government?

126
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,116
Oh. The rough idea is
I swipe the lumber,

127
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:53,125
then I charge them
for swiping it,

128
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,627
then I sold it every month.

129
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,222
Am I a genius. Hey,
that's crooked, ain't it?

130
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:04,236
Yeah. Well, I'll never
forget you boys...

131
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,738
for the way
you've trusted me,

132
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,469
but the responsibility
is too great.

133
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:12,910
You can sell my seat
in the legislature
to the highest bidder.

134
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,983
I'm learning to rumba,
so I'm flying to Havana tonight.

135
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,483
So long, fellas. Ha.

136
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,486
Pardon me, I'd...

137
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:23,489
Is this him?
[Captain]
Yep, that's him.

138
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:26,492
Okay, you're pardoned...
with pleasure.

139
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:28,994
I got his fingerprints.
We ge...

140
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,997
That's about it, Jim.
Do you see what
we mean?

141
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,226
I see. I'm gonna get
a convoy.

142
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:38,965
All you've got to do
is to get the senator
in a compromising situation.

143
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:43,032
Compromise him? He doesn't
drink, smoke or play cards.

144
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,942
Every time he lies down,
they muffle a bugle
and play "Taps."

145
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:50,541
Well, how about women?
Loganberry's 60 years old
and has never kissed a woman.

146
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,551
He's been in "Ripley"
three times.

147
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,019
Get him a girl,
we'll make him think
he's 19 again.

148
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,556
You expect me to do that
with a power of attorney?

149
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,558
If you don't,
you'll regret it...

150
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,561
for the next 20 years
of your life.
Okay, I'll try.

151
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:06,064
After all, if the government
could fertilize the dust bowl...

152
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,068
I ought to be able to do
something with Loganberry.

153
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,872
Will you join me?

154
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,877
Hello, Oscar.
Hello, Mr. Taylor.

155
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,879
Can I have one?
Hello, Mr. Taylor.

156
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,789
Next year you'll be
buyin' papers from me.

You got a slug, slug?
Yeah, sure.

00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,677
Oh, no, no, not that kind.
Just the phone.
Oh.

163
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,509
Help yourself.

164
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,516
Hmm. Make your own, huh?

165
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,188
Hello, Madame Bordelaise's
Cafe? This is Jimmy Taylor.

00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,389

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,198
Oh.

00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,707
Mr. Taylor
on telephone.

171
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,710
Jimmy? When did he
get back?

172
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:27,372
Hello, Jimmy.
Welcome home to New Orleans.

173
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,506
I'll be over.
I'm in trouble.

174
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:32,017
Certainly I'll help you.

175
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,220
Who is the girl?

176
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:37,154
No, this time something else
got me in trouble.

177
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:40,159
It wasn't legs,
it was logs. Good-bye.

178
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,668
I'm gonna be busy,
so you can take
the afternoon off.

179
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,170
Spend some time with
your father and mother,

180

visiting hours today.

181

Mademoiselle.
Oh, excuse me, please.

182
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:10,682
Is this Madame Bordelaise's
restaurant?
Yes, mademoiselle.

183
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,692
May I see her, please?
We are very old friends.

Oui.

00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,833
Oh, my little Marina.

186
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:24,837
You here in Louisiana.
What a surprise.

187
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,339
Yvonne. This is a bigger
surprise for me.

188
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:30,342
You have not changed
in ten years.
Oh, but you have.

189
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,639
You were such
a little girl.

190
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:37,683
What a beautiful place.
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

191
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:39,685
Now, sit down.

192
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:43,052
How is your mother?
Well, I trust.

193
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,125
No, she's not well,
I trust.
Oh.

194
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:49,219
She's still in Vienna.
Oh, health is all right,
but money and things...

195
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,094
I want to get mama
a passport too,

196
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,929
but she needs $500
to come over.

197
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,866
$500?
Mm-hmm.

198
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:59,235
I just paid my mortgage,
but I'll get it.
No, no, no.

199
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,241
I don't want you
to give it to me.
I want a job,

200
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,243
any kind of a job.

201
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,745
I can dance
or scrub the floors...

202
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,111
or wash the dishes
or anything.

203
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:13,118
But the estate.
First we sold one part
of the estate,

204
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,121
and then another,
and then came Anschluss.

205
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,123
You know... liberation.

206
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,955
They liberated the rest
of the estate from us.

207
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,962
Of course they left us
the gardener's cabin.
Mon dieu.

208
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,965
Oh, it wasn't bad.
The gardener had some cows.

209
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,298
First we sold the milk,
then the cows.
And then what?

210
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,838
Then last year I got
a passport for America.

211
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,340
I have my first
citizen papers already.

212
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,343
In a few years
I get my second papers,

213
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,937
and then I'll go on relief.
Heil Roosevelt!

214
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:50,650
Ah, bonjour, monsieur.

215
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:53,158
Voulez-vous prendre
cette table ici, peut-etre...

216
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,321
tres bien, je vous assiérai
et personne ne vous
derangera.

217
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,331
How do you do?

218
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,334
La tempete est belle dans
New Orleans, n'est-ce pas?

219
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,336
Thank you.

220
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:07,839
Et maintenant, monsieur,
voulez vous choisir?

221
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:15,638
This is in French too.
Yes.

222
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,082
Well, could I order
something in English?

223
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,177
Certainly.
Certainly.

224
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:24,223
Monsieur would like to
have something to drink
before dinner?

225
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:28,819
No, I'll just take my usual:
A glass of hot water.

226
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,332
Hot water?
Yeah, that's good for you
before a meal.

227
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,299
Oh, very well,
but, uh...

228
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,802
now, what about
something to eat?

229
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:39,896
I will suggest
some oysters.

230
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:43,465
I knew you were going
to say that.

231
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,478
Every time I go
in a restaurant,

232
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,980
a waiter takes
one look at me...

233
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,142
and suggests oysters.

234
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,453
I don't understand it.

235
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:58,685
But, monsieur,
this is New Orleans,
the home of oysters.

236
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:03,491
I've had waiters
suggest it to me
in Nebraska,

237
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:06,225
and Nebraska ain't
the home of oysters.

238
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,269
Oh, but you see,
the waiter realizes
immediately...

239
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,771
that monsieur is
a connoisseur about food,

240
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:15,774
so naturally
he suggests oysters.

241
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,776
Say, maybe that's it.

242
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:20,506
All right, I might
have some oysters.

243
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:25,017
May I suggest
a New Orleans speciality?
Oysters Rockefeller.

244
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,610
Oysters Rockefeller?

245
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,155
Oh, no, you don't.
What's the matter?

246
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,157
No.

247
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,659
A man in my profession
can't afford...

248
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:37,697
to have his name associated
with Rockefeller.

249
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,130
What is your profession?

250
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:46,603
Bend over.

251
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,642
I don't want this
to get around,

252
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:55,147
but I'm a senator,
a United States senator.

253
00:16:55,249 --> 00:17:00,152
We're supposed
to knock big business
all the time, see?

254
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:04,156
We can't have anything
to do with Rockefeller.

255
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:06,818
Oh. I understand.

256
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:10,829
I can't even go
to Radio City.

257
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,831
That is sad.

258
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:16,334
So I guess we'd better
skip the oysters?

259
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,337
Well, then, uh...

260
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,339
what about some soup?

261
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:22,841
Soup?
Mmm.

262
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,776
Nah. That's practically
hot water,

263
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,780
and I'm having that
anyway.

264
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,784
I tell you what:
You bring me
a ham sandwich...

265
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,287
and a cup of coffee.
A ham sandwich?
In Bordelaise's,

266
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,290
the best restaurant
in New Orleans?

267
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,792
Oh! What an insult!
What's the matter?

268
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:45,297
We are not in the habit
of serving ham sandwich
in Bordelaise's.

269
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,301
Oh, I get it.
A kosher restaurant, huh?

270
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:54,136
Well, that's all right.
Bring me a hot pastrami
on rye.

271
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:57,699
A hot pastrami?
Sure.
I like that too.

272
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,245
Oh! Gaston!

273
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,315
Oui, Madame?

274
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,651
Madame?
Have the gentleman
served immediately.

275
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:10,155
Yes.
Il veut de I'eau chaude
et du hot pastrami.

276
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,384
Tu t'imagines,
chez Bordelaise?

277
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:15,462
On a pas d'idée
d'une chose pareille.
Aussi donne lui un sandwich...

278
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,462
de n'importe quoi et
ca fera la rue michel.

279
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,464
With mustard.
Wi...

280
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,467
I suppose it's quite
an honor to you...

281
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,663
having a senator
eat here.
We've had
a lot of senators.

282
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:29,174
Oh.
And we've had ambassadors
and presidents.

283
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,176
Is that so?

284
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,678
Uh, President Roosevelt
ever eat here?

285
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,740
No, but we had Coolidge
and Hoover.

286
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:42,613
Ah, Coolidge and Hoover.

287
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,624
Well, in those days
it was still legal...

288
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:48,786
for a Republican
to be president.

289
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,262
Why? Isn't it
legal anymore?

290
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,729
It hasn't come up recently,

291
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:59,636
but if it ever does,
I don't think
the new supreme court...

292
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,641
would declare it
constitutional.

293
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:05,234
Voila, monsieur.

294
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,643
C'est un bon client,
n'est-ce pas?
Quel ballot!

295
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,648
Tais-toi! Tais-toi!
Tais-toi!

296
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,684
On a pas d'idée
d'une chose pareille!

297
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:14,720
[Whistle]
Don't do that.

298
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:19,654
This is a pretty
expensive place.
You'd better wait outside.

299
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,660
Uh-huh.

00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:37,108
Is it really you?
This is a fine time
to make sure.

303
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:39,611
I'm so happy to see you.
Oh, thanks.

304
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:41,613
Mr. Taylor?
Yes?

305
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,240
You're just the man
I'm looking for.

306
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:47,787
I'm busy now, shorty,
and I have all the
insurance I can carry.

307
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,789
What I want you to do,
Bordy, I wa... come in.

308
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,791
What's this?
My card.

309
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:56,795
I told you I'm busy.
I don't even know who you are.

310
00:19:56,897 --> 00:20:00,628
That's the reason
I gave you my card,
so you'd know.

311
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:04,295
Well...
"Mr. Oliver P. Loganberry."

312
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,395
He...

313
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:10,135
I'll see you later, Bordy.
All right.
I'll be around.

314
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:13,145
So you're
Senator Loganberry.
Mm-hmm.

315
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,112
Well... heh heh.

316
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:21,486
Uh... do you want to come
over to my table with me...

317
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,488
while I finish
my sandwich?

318
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,151
The reason I want to
go over to my table is...

319
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:29,821
because they got
the mustard over there.

320
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,296
The mustard.

321
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,675
Oh, uh... could I offer you
a piece of this?

322
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,678
No, thanks, Senator.
It would stick
in my throat.

323
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,681
Well, then I'll just go
right ahead.
Mm-hmm.

324
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:53,184
It's quite a coincidence,
my running into you this way.

325
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:56,688
Yes, sir, it certainly is
a small restaurant.

326
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,655
Yeah.

327
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,195
I was afraid I'd have to send
J. Edgar Hoover after you.

328
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,198
Oh, well, we wouldn't want
to trouble him, would we?

329
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,201
What was it you wanted
to see me about, Senator?

330
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:13,364
You're the president of
the Louisiana Purchasing
Company, aren't you?

331
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:15,373
Well, I was.
What do you mean, "was"?

332
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,375
We elected a new
president today.

333
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,377
We felt like we needed
new blood...

334
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,447
and we'd like to give
the young fellas a chance.

335
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,448
I see.
I'm glad to have
met you, Senator.

336
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,383
If there's any I can do
to make your stay pleasant,
just call.

337
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,386
That's very nice
of you.
Good-bye.

338
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,888
Hey! Wait a minute.

339
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:33,892
There is something
you can do.
What's that?

340
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:36,121
I'd like to see
your books.

341
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:38,891
Books? Uh...
Yeah.

342
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:41,832
Why read that old stuff?
There's a circulating
library right...

343
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,733
No, I don't want to read,
I just want to add up.

344
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:48,797
Mmm. Well, that's too bad.
Huh?

345
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,503
Didn't you hear about
the fire we're having?

346
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,511
I mean had.

347
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,513
Fire?
It destroyed
all our records.

348
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:59,051
It started out
as a hotfoot,
but it got away from us.

349
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,052
That's too bad.
Much damage?

350
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,055
No, the fire
was confined to the
bookkeeping department.

351
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,058
Destroyed all our records
of sales, checks,
valuable papers,

352
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,560
but the rest
of the building
is still intact...

353
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,961
and no lives were lost.
That was pretty fortunate.

354
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,465
So, as much as I'd
like to cooperate,

355
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:16,468
I can't show you
our books.

356
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,504
Of course not.
All burned up.

357
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:21,597
A beautiful set
of books they were too.
I'll betcha.

358
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:25,542
Made out by the best
certified public accountant
money could convince.

359
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:28,409
You mean Simpson.
Yeah...

360
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,379
Yeah, he's a good man.
I guess I'm lucky.

361
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:35,148
What do you mean?
When I got to town,

362
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:38,156
the first thing I did
was to go to Simpson...

363
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:41,159
and subpoena his
duplicate set
of your accounts.

364
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,661
I got 'em right here
with me.

365
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:47,332
It's a very interesting
record.

366
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,602
Only they, uh...

367
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,603
the figures don't
add up right.

368
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,437
I've gone over it
very carefully
from every angle.

369
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,444
I've had it checked,
rechecked and certified.

370
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,447
You certainly seem
to think of everything,
Senator.

371
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,449
Just a case of experience.

372
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,452
I've been in politics
for thirty years now.

373
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,455
When my side,
the Republicans, are in,

374
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,957
they tell me all the tricks
they pull and...

375
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,858
when the Democrats get in,
I know just what to look for.

376
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:18,931
- You fellas have to keep
an eye on each other.
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:21,933
It's a good thing
for the American people
we do.

378
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:24,936
That's the only reason
they still have shirts.

379
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,767
Well, uh...

380
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:33,603
I... I don't suppose
there's any way you could
forget about this, Senator?

381
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,683
No.

382
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,651
No way I can see.

383
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:58,328
Might even get you
ten years extra
just for asking me.

384
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,507
Oh, uh... waiter.

385
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,043
Oui, monsieur.
Bring me the check,
please.

386
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,006
Monsieur, check.

387
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,523
Voila, monsieur.
Check.

388
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,490
90 cents.
Oui, monsieur.

389
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:22,494
That's enough.

390
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,996
Any place that'll
charge 90 cents...

391
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:27,999
for a sandwich
and a cup of coffee...

392
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,001
can't be respectable.

393
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:36,307
There's a dollar.
That's ten cents
for you.

394
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,309
Merci, monsieur.

395
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:41,880
He didn't even say
thank you.

396
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,883
Well, I've enjoyed
this little talk,
Senator.

397
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,886
I'm very glad to have
met you, Mr. Taylor.

398
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,889
I suppose I'll be
seeing you again
in the state capitol.

399
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,892
Look for me.
I'm in the sixth row
on the aisle.

400
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,894
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

401
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:09,598
[Senator]
Oh, uh...
Oh.

402
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:12,678
If you want to keep
that briefcase...

403
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,680
to look over those records,
it's all right,

404
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:18,683
because I had a lot
of copies made anyhow.

405
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:25,091
Crook.

406
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,832
Jimmy!
Huh?

407
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:36,903
Something's the matter,
no? Yes?
Something's
the matter, yes.

408
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:40,404
The senator. He's going
to send us all to jail
for 1,000 years apiece...

409
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,407
unless we get him first.

410
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:45,410
Besides that, the gang'll
probably bump me off.

411
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:48,913
I've got to do something,
and you can help.
Sure. But how?

412
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:51,415
I need a girl
to go after the senator,

413
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:53,918
a girl with plenty
of ants.
Relatives?

414
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,921
She can have relatives too,
but she's gotta have ants.
Ants?

415
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:59,287
Ants. You know,
flies that have been
grounded.

416
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,623
Yvonne, I've been
looking for...
Marina!

417
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,358
Jimmy, look!
From heaven!
Heaven?

418
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,832
She must've had
a rough trip down.

419
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,870
But that's what you wanted:
Nice, sweet, demure.

420
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:15,567
But what about the ants?
She has no ants.
What I'm after is ants.

421
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:17,609
You should go
on a picnic.

422
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:19,702
[Jimmy]
Ohh...
[Bordelaise]
Listen, Jimmy...

423
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:22,714
an archduke and a baron,
for this girl they killed
themselves.

424
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:25,284
What?
What?
Yes!

425
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:28,286
And then there was
the count of Budapest.

426
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:31,482
There's no count
of Budapest.
No. No more.

427
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,526
He kill himself.
You mustn't say
such things, Yvonne.

428
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:37,529
Yes, I'll say it. Let him
know how good you are.

429
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,531
Mr. Taylor wants
to engage you.

430
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:43,262
You want to engage
with me?
Well, yes, I...

431
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,270
But I do not love you,

432
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:48,034
and I do not engage
unless I love.

433
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:50,837
What's playing with her?

434
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,879
Oh, no, no, no, darling,
you don't understand.

435
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,881
Mr. Taylor wants to
give you a job.

436
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,383
Good! What kind
of a job?

437
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:02,387
Well, it won't pay much.
Only $500.

438
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:07,893
$500?
For $500, I can get
a truckload of girls
and two tons of caviar.

439
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:11,896
Never mind the caviar.
I'll take the $500.
She works fast.

440
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,762
Tell him what I did
to the crown prince.
Oh, yes.

441
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:17,302
I know.
"He keel himself."

442
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:20,567
Oh, you read about it
in the paper.

443
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:23,165
Yes. In the
"Budapest Bugle."
Come here.

444
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:27,679
She's not a bad-lookin' girl,
but if she's such a killer,
what's with those clothes?

445
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,682
She looks like a fugitive
from a down payment.
Oh, well, you see...

446
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:34,185
when she ran away
from the baron, she left
everything behind:

447
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:37,688
Her jewels, her clothes,
everything.

448
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,884
Well, not everything.

449
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,260
So you know a lot
about men, huh?

450
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:49,301
Maybe you do not
think so.

451
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:51,802
Well, it's
barely possible.

452
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,874
So you think
I'm barely possible.

453
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:58,410
Well, you might even go
a little further than that.

454
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,945
Oh, I'm sure I could.

455
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,379
Like this.

456
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:07,180
Turn it off. You'll
wear out your battery.
You get the job.

457
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:10,381
I do?
Yeah.
Now turn it on again.

458
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,357
What do I do?
I'll arrange for you
to have dinner...

459
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,897
with the senator tomorrow night,
then you can do your stuff.
My, uh... stuff?

460
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:20,056
You know,
the old stufferoo.

461
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,259
My, uh... stufferoo?

462
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,805
But not all of it.
I don't want him
to "keel himself."
Oh.

463
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:28,806
I'll try to hold back.
I don't give him all
the stufferoo,

464
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:32,309
I just give him half.
[Bordelaise]
She must have new clothes.

465
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:34,312
I knew you'd say
something like that.

466
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:37,016
What you want her to do,
go without any?

467
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,983
Yes.
No!
No!

468
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:42,748
Suppose I pick you up
about 1:00 and we go
on a shopping tour?

469
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:44,949
Shopping. Shopping?

470
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,653
And Jimmy, don't worry.
You've picked
the right girl.

471
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:52,163
If I haven't, you can tell
the archduke and those
other suicides to move over.

472
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:54,324
Tomorrow at 1:00?

473
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:56,402
Tomorrow.

474
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:05,677
Ants. She's loaded.

475
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:15,687
Oh, Jimmy,
this is wonderful.

476
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:18,690
I want to look like
an American girl.

477
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:21,693
Let's buy, buy,
buy, buy.
You talk like one already.

478
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,695
[Saleswoman]
Good morning.
May I assist you?

479
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:27,130
Thanks. We'd like to see
some clothes for a senator.
What?

480
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:32,136
Something that'll appeal to
a disintegrating Don Juan.
I wouldn't call you old, sir.

481
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:35,639
Well, isn't...
You would if you knew
what I had on my mind.

482
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:37,642
This way, please.

483
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:48,319
May I show you
something, sir?
No, thanks. I seen it.

484
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:55,961
Your young lady
should look very well
in clothes.

485
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:58,656
She's the type
who can take 'em
or leave 'em.

486
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:02,166
I'm not his young lady.
I'm his business.

487
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,671
You're entitled to
your own opinion, but
you can be wrong too.

488
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,806
Hello there.

489
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:13,344
[Jimmy]
Shopping?

490
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:20,684
Who's that?
A friend of mine
who's been on my
tail for days.

491
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:22,516
He's practically
a bustle.

492
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,785
These are the latest
sport models.

493
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:46,679
Sports, huh? Have you
anything appropriate for
trapping an old goat?

494
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,940
Oh, they're lovely.

495
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:53,213
I can hardly wait
to put myself in them.

496
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:59,223
Oh. I'll take
that and that and...

497
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:02,226
Don't mind her.
She stutters.
Very good.

498
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,228
Very good?
She's batting
a thousand.

499
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,230
We're really
interested in some
sheer, clinging,

500
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,129
low-necked overalls
for night work.

501
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,225
You got that type
of thing?
Of course.

502
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,236
Oh, you have, eh?

503
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,955
Somebody
strap me down.

504
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,685
Oh. So that's
the kind you are.

505
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:35,693
You mean
there's another kind?

506
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:40,198
[Coughs]

507
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:53,734
Is that what they mean
by the open door policy?

508
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,540
Well, they're
beautiful.

509
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:04,523
I'll take them all.
Yes, I would...
All?

510
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:07,650
Now I know why
all those noblemen
shot themselves.

511
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:21,739
Say, does fluid drive
come with this model?

512
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:39,516
That reminds me: I must
get some vitamin B pills.

513
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,526
Oh, what a country.

514
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:44,529
Say, come to think of it,
shouldn't you have
a bathing suit?

515
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,496
Why?
The senator
might drool.

516
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,067
Oh.
We'd like to see some
bathing suits.

517
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:52,069
Filled, of course.
What a racket.

518
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,667
[Wolf Whistle]

519
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:03,875
Please, Malcolm,
let's dispense with those
long and low whistles...

520
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,883
and the thought behind them.

521
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,894
Chicken under glass.

522
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:30,507
These are all
next season's models.

523
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,340
Yeah? Let's see
the season after next.

524
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:50,595
Ha ha. Thank you, Jimmy,
and good-bye.

525
00:33:56,969 --> 00:34:01,030
Wait for me downstairs.
I may be out much quicker
than I think.

526
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,041
All right, but don't
think I'm a dope.
Don't pull nothin'.

527
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:06,407
Mind reader.

528
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:13,717
Wha... I thought
we made good-bye.

529
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,220
Well, we make hello
again.
Why?
Is there something else?

530
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:18,722
Are you kiddin'?
I hate to shop and run.

531
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:21,225
Besides, if you're going
to tackle the senator,

532
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,318
we'd better have
a rehearsal.

533
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,363
Rehearsal?
How will we rehearse?

534
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:27,228
We'll go through
the motions.

535
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,734
I'll pretend to be
the senator, and you
pour on the stufferoo.

536
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:33,829
Stufferoo? Oh, no.
I pour on the stufferoo
tonight.

537
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,840
Oh, no.
Look, I'm the senator.

538
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:45,015
What are you doing
in my room?

539
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:47,018
Must I call
the house detective?

540
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,351
But, Senator,
you do not understand.

541
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:54,358
I have come here specially
to make this visit with you.

542
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,361
Young lady, I know
just what you're
lobbying for, and...

543
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:59,363
you've got
a beautiful lobby.

544
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:02,366
But, Senator, I do not
want to lobby with you.

545
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:05,699
This means very many to me,

546
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:08,365
alone... like this.

547
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:11,375
Marina.
Remember,
you're the senator.

548
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,377
Loganberry never
felt like this.

549
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:16,380
Please, Jimmy,
one man at a time.

550
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:19,280
First I must get the senator
in a promising position.

551
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:23,845
Okay, but remember,
after you've finished
with Loganberry,

552
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,857
I want a chance
to blow my brains out.

553
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,363
Well, I've never seen
a cleaner-lookin' bunch
of vultures.

554
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,905
I hope you've thought
of something good.

555
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:43,999
I've procured the services
of one of the world's
most dangerous women,

556
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,975
including the Scandinavian.

557
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:49,514
Miss Marina's
in there, sir.
This is it. Thanks, Sam.

558
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:51,951
Let's take a look.

559
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:54,418
Good evening, gentlemen.

560
00:35:56,189 --> 00:35:59,590
Wait a minute, boys.
This is to get us out of a jam.

561
00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:02,092
What she hasn't got,
she doesn't need.

562
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:05,028
What she doesn't need
is good enough for me.
I'll buy that.

563
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:07,099
I'm not late, am I?

564
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,134
How do you like?

565
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:11,669
I like fine.
I knew you'd
come through, Jim.

566
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:15,798
Yes, sir. From here in,
we'll leave it all to you.

567
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:19,605
Boy, if she was black,
she'd be beautiful.

568
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:22,647
I'll call the senator
and make an appointment.

569
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:34,992
Take these. You know
what to do with 'em.

570
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:36,994
Shoot him
from every angle.

571
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:39,997
Hello. Give me
Senator Loganberry's
room, please.

572
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:43,500
I've been with him
all afternoon. We're
practically bosom pals.

573
00:36:43,603 --> 00:36:47,004
Hello, Oliver,
this is Jim.
Jim Taylor.

574
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:49,506
You know, Louisiana
Purchasing Company,

575
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:53,045
the one whose
books are short?
Well, this is shorty.

576
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,680
Meet you?

577
00:36:56,782 --> 00:37:01,845
Wh... I'm in bed,
practically. Um, it's...

578
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:06,991
it's s... s...
18 minutes past seven,

579
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:10,551
and I got a big day
ahead of me tomorrow.

580
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:12,893
He's shy.
He wants to be coaxed.

581
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:15,559
Meet me at Madame Bordelaise's
and I'll give you the lowdown.

582
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:19,331
I've been telling him
all about her.
Boy, is he steamed up.

583
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:22,464
You mean you're ready
to turn state's evidence?

584
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:26,341
Oh, sure. Anything you want,
from soup to nuts.

585
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,845
Well, that's fine. Fine.

586
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:32,349
You see, I gotta get back
to my home state...

587
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:34,851
and start campaigning
for re-election,

588
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:38,515
or I'm liable to lose
my senatorial seat.

589
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,559
Well, you've got
an awful lot to lose, Senator.

590
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:43,720
Okay, it's a date.

591
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:46,662
Boys, I have to give Marina
a final polishing job,

592
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,666
so meet me there, will ya?

593
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,850
You think I got
the, uh... ants?

594
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:08,853
Honey, you're
covered with 'em.

595
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:12,857
I have a lot of fun with you
when you take me shopping.

596
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,359
I have a lot of fun
when you take me.

597
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:18,362
Good. I like two people
should have fun together.

598
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:21,365
Well, we could have a lot
of fun together, but...

599
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:26,132
business before business.
You see, you're my private
secretary.

600
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:29,139
You tell the senator
I'll be a little late...

601
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:32,642
and that you can explain
things till I get there.
What I explain?

602
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:34,645
You're not going to explain.

603
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:37,147
When he opens his books,
you get to work.

604
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:40,150
I'm counting on your figure
to make him forget ours.

605
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:42,652
You like my figure?

606
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:46,987
There are a lot of things
I like about you, only...
Only what?

607
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:49,994
Well, there are some things
I don't like.
What?

608
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:53,497
All those noblemen,
for one thing.
Oh, but they are dead.

609
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,499
Yes, but there they are.

610
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:59,002
But you are different.
You are not noble.

611
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:02,006
I see. You never
have any trouble
with the peasants.

612
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:04,008
No.
No. Heh heh.

613
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,692
[Bordelaise]
Ah, good evening,
Senator.
Good evening.

614
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:25,195
Please go in. Go in.

615
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:32,136
Say, what is this?
Where's Taylor?

616
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:34,035
He's to meet you here.

617
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,109
This is our private
dining room.

618
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:41,305
Oh, yeah. I never been
in one of these before.
Ha-ha.

619
00:39:41,414 --> 00:39:44,315
Won't you sit down,
Senator?
Thanks.

620
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,856
That was awful good pastrami
I had yesterday.

621
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,356
Oh, I'm glad
you liked it.

622
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:55,859
Pardon me. Are you
Madame Bordelaise?
Yes.

623
00:39:55,961 --> 00:40:01,160
I'm Marina Von Minden.
Is Senator Loganberry here?

624
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:03,167
Yeah, that's me.

625
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:07,171
I'm Mr. Taylor's
private secretary.

626
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:09,173
Oh.
He will come later.

627
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:12,210
While we are waiting,
I can explain anything.

628
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:16,839
Oh, well, won't you
sit down 'til he comes?
Thank you.

629
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:21,082
[Bordelaise]
While you are waiting,
Senator,

630
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:24,156
may I send you up
some of your hot water?

631
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:27,157
That's a good idea.
Will you have some?

632
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,318
Hot water?
Yes.

633
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:32,454
No, thanks,
I just have my bath.

634
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:37,935
Uh... well,
this isn't for bathing,
it's for drinking.

635
00:40:38,037 --> 00:40:41,598
No, thanks,
I do not like it.
Could I
offer you something else?

636
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:43,732
Some cold water, maybe.

637
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:48,507
Hot water? Cold water?
I think you are old foof.

638
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:53,176
Huh?
Oh, old foof!
Oh, yes.

639
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:57,381
We have very good
old foof. 1880.

640
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,390
I'll send it right up.

641
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:04,586
What is this old foof?

642
00:41:04,697 --> 00:41:07,222
I hope it's nothing
intoxicating.

643
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:12,327
They tell me so many girls
drink liquor nowadays.

644
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:17,205
Not me. I believe in...
probation.

645
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:23,312
Uh, pardon me.
What sort of an accent
is that you have?

646
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:25,849
Oh, that's Viennese.
Oh.

647
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:28,351
I'm not here very long.
I see.

648
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:31,855
You, uh... live here
with your family?

649
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:34,858
No. My mother's
still over there.

650
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,861
I can't
bring her over yet.
Why not?

651
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:42,332
Those dirty, stinking
immigration laws.

652
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:48,531
Immigration laws.

653
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:50,438
I wrote them.

654
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:52,408
You?

655
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:54,843
Perhaps you could
bring her over here.

656
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:57,916
Oh, sure I could.
Like that.
Really?

657
00:41:58,017 --> 00:42:00,918
But she'd have to
have $500.

658
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,921
Oh, she'll have that,
all right.
I'm getting it tonight.

659
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:07,356
Oh. Well, uh...
what is her name?

660
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:10,860
Countess Maritza Von Minden,

661
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:14,865
32 Josefstrasse, Vienna.

662
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:19,529
32... Josefstrasse?

663
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:21,367
Uh-huh.

664
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:26,336
[Whispering]
Josef... Strasse.

665
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:28,379
Uh, how do you spell that?

666
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,938
Yaht-O-S-E-F... Strasse.

667
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:35,452
Yaht?
Yaht.

668
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:37,681
You better write it.

669
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,858
Your mother
is a countess?

670
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:43,861
How did that happen?

671
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:47,364
Very simple.
My father was a count.
Oh.

672
00:42:47,466 --> 00:42:49,696
Well, that sounds
reasonable.

673
00:42:49,802 --> 00:42:51,702
I'll send a wire tonight,

674
00:42:51,804 --> 00:42:54,705
and she can come over
as a visitor...

675
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:56,707
under my protection.
How's that?

676
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:58,834
Oh, Senator.

677
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:02,402
Oh, you didn't
have to do that.

678
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:08,886
[French Accent]
Ahem. Senator Loganberry?
Yeah?

679
00:43:08,988 --> 00:43:10,888
I have the honor
to present myself.

680
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:16,394
I am Madame Bordelaise's
head waiter. I am Jacques.
Hiya, Jacques.

681
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:19,396
Madame Bordelaise told me
to take good care of you,

682
00:43:19,498 --> 00:43:22,729
and I am going to give it
to you... good!

683
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:24,735
Observe. Voila!

684
00:43:24,837 --> 00:43:27,567
My staff.

685
00:43:27,673 --> 00:43:31,666
Pierre, Albert, Robert...

686
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:35,474
and, uh... polar bear.

687
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:38,049
They certainly give you
good service here.

688
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,210
Five waiters for a glass
of hot water.

689
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,288
Albert. This way.

690
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:46,256
Senator. Observe.

691
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,861
What is that?
This is pure Mississippi
River water.

692
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:53,864
Oh.
Temperature is
as you wish?

693
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:57,701
Yeah,
that's about right.

694
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:01,204
Mississippi
River water, huh?
Uh-huh.

695
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:05,266
Would you mind
putting a squirt
of lemon in it for me?

696
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:08,369
A squirt? A squirt!
A lemon? Certainement.

697
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,380
Oui oui. Tout suite.

698
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,382
Lemon! Voila! Voila!

699
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:15,385
Take it on ze lam.
Warm it up out zere.

700
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:19,389
[Indistinct Chatter]
Lemon? Ha-ha-ha!
Lemon.

701
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,686
[Jimmy]
A little hot water for
the senator, polar bear?

702
00:44:21,794 --> 00:44:24,262
Oh, yes.
Little hot water.
Very little.

703
00:44:24,363 --> 00:44:28,265
Pierre, a little vitamin A
for the senator. Thank you.

704
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:31,268
Albert, a little pinch
of salt for the senator.

705
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,669
A little pinch of salt
with a slight gin flavor.

706
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:37,674
Robert, a little
squirt of lemon.

707
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:40,677
The everlovin'
squirt of lemon
for the senator...

708
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:43,509
and stir well before
tasting. Ah ha ha.

709
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:45,515
I taste.

710
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,361
Monsieur. Hot water
for the senator,

711
00:44:57,463 --> 00:45:00,864
and the old foof
for the mademoiselle.
You taste, please.

712
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:04,197
Pure Mississippi
River water, eh?
Ah.

713
00:45:04,303 --> 00:45:06,999
You sure?
Look, there's a piece
of the levy.

714
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:12,042
Gulp! Uhh...

715
00:45:12,144 --> 00:45:14,704
uh... whew.
That's a little hot.

716
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:18,180
The senator will blow on it
or fan it with his hat.

717
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,379
Yes, that's better,
but it tastes different...

718
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:25,514
from what I had
yesterday.

719
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:33,497
It don't seem to be hot,
but still it burns
going down.

720
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,499
I guess it's stronger.

721
00:45:35,601 --> 00:45:37,535
That's the "whitamin"
content.

722
00:45:37,636 --> 00:45:41,333
It has the "whitamins"
S, O, U, S and E.

723
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,341
Yesterday we have on hand
only the Missouri water.

724
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:47,207
The Missouri water
is much weaker than
the Mississippi water,

725
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:51,715
but you prefer the Missouri...
No, I'm beginning
to like this.

726
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:54,149
[Jimmy]
Oh, you make me so happy.

727
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:56,346
Oh. Very happy.
Hey!

728
00:45:56,455 --> 00:45:58,855
Oh. Don't worry, Senator.

729
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:00,857
I'll take it off your check.

730
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,689
Vamoose. Amera-cays.

731
00:46:03,796 --> 00:46:06,196
[Loganberry]
Oh... oh... oh, Jack.
Monsieur?

732
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:09,699
Some more hot water.
Ah-ah!

733
00:46:09,802 --> 00:46:13,203
One more of these and he'll
be higher than the B-19.

734
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:18,208
[Loganberry]
I think I've seen that
waiter someplace before.

735
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,610
Oh, Jack, haven't I seen you
someplace before?

736
00:46:22,714 --> 00:46:26,616
Well, I don't know.

737
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:30,916
Maybe it was Paris,
where I was head waiter
at the Petite Poulet?

738
00:46:31,023 --> 00:46:33,821
No, I never been to Paris.

739
00:46:33,926 --> 00:46:37,362
Maybe it was
Washington.
That could be it.
Washington.

740
00:46:37,463 --> 00:46:39,226
Washington. Let's drink
to Washington.

741
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:42,300
To Washington, B.C.

742
00:46:42,401 --> 00:46:44,369
Washington... [Mumbles]

743
00:46:46,038 --> 00:46:48,165
Gulp! Washington.

744
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:52,334
Every time I think
of Washington, I could cry.

745
00:46:52,444 --> 00:46:55,936
There's a couple of guys
in Europe who feel
the same way.

746
00:46:57,149 --> 00:46:59,344
[Crying]

747
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:03,353
Oh, don't cry,
please.

748
00:47:03,455 --> 00:47:06,686
I was just feeling
a little homesick...

749
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:09,022
for Washington.
Oh.

750
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:12,028
I don't know anybody
in New Orleans.

751
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,224
Everybody I try
to get in touch with...

752
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:18,030
doesn't want to see me.

753
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:20,036
Well, I know
how you feel.

754
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:23,539
I don't recognize
many people here either.

755
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:25,542
You don't?
No.

756
00:47:25,644 --> 00:47:28,135
I just work
for Mr. Taylor.
Yes?

757
00:47:28,247 --> 00:47:31,148
After I finish my work,
I go home right away...

758
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,650
so I can worry
by myself.

759
00:47:33,752 --> 00:47:37,654
That's the saddest story
I ever heard.

760
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:39,656
I'm lonely too.

761
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:44,161
Why, even when I
get up in the senate
to make a speech...

762
00:47:44,263 --> 00:47:46,663
I'm all alone.

763
00:47:46,765 --> 00:47:49,666
? You're lonely ?

764
00:47:49,768 --> 00:47:51,668
Yeah.

765
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,103
? And I'm lonely ?

766
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:59,166
? So why can't we ?

767
00:47:59,278 --> 00:48:04,375
? Be lonely together ?

768
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:11,685
? The night is young
and while it grows older ?

769
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,281
? We can forget ?

770
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:20,263
? Crying on
each other's shoulder ?

771
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:24,324
? The sky's cloudy ?

772
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:29,464
? 'Cause we're lonely ?

773
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:33,443
? But soon we'll see ?

774
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:38,915
? A change
in the weather ?

775
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:46,321
? Two lonely hearts
beating as one ?

776
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:50,225
? Can be miserable ?

777
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:58,361
? And still have a lot of fun ?

778
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,904
Ah ha-ha-ha.

779
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:04,407
? You're lonely ?

780
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:08,775
? And I'm lonely ?

781
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,976
? So why can't we ?

782
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:18,022
? Be lonely together ?

783
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:25,495
? The night is young
and while it grows older ?

784
00:49:25,597 --> 00:49:27,929
? We can forget ?

785
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:33,403
? Crying on
each other's shoulder ?

786
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:37,874
? The sky's cloudy ?

787
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:41,878
? Cause we're lonely ?

788
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,178
? But soon we'll see ?
? So why... see ?

789
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:51,085
? A change in the weather ?

790
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:58,357
? Two lonely hearts
beating as one ?

791
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:01,955
? Can be miserable ?

792
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:14,207
? And still have a lot
of fun ??

793
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:18,348
Oh, say,
that was beautiful.
Oh, really?

794
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,452
Oh, Jack!
Some more hot water!

795
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:21,851
Oh, Jack!
Some more hot water!

796
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:26,083
First time the Mississippi
ever emptied into a senator.

797
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:33,362
[French Accent]
Zere you are.
Uh, thanks. Oh, golly.

798
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:37,333
I wish I could remember
who you remind me of.

799
00:50:37,436 --> 00:50:40,701
Oh, don't worry, Senator.
It will come to you.

800
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:44,367
- [Hiccup]
- Don't reach for it.
It'll come to you.

801
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:47,877
I guess the Mississippi
[Hiccup] is repeating on me.

802
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:50,379
Sounds more like
the levy eez breaking.

803
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:53,883
Mademoiselle, I have
a telephone message
for you... private.

804
00:50:53,985 --> 00:50:56,886
You will pardon me,
Senator?
Oh, sure.
Go right ahead.

805
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:59,889
I've run out of
conversation anyhow.

806
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,061
We're all set.
All you've gotta do...

807
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:07,723
is get on this guy's lap
long enough for us to
take a picture.

808
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:10,233
Do I got to?
He's such a sweet man.

809
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:12,895
Do you want me to spend
my life in jail...

810
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:15,905
or floating
down the river in
a barrel of cement?
No, Jimmy.

811
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:18,908
Then give him the works.
Okay, I'll give him
the works,

812
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,910
but I don't like it.

813
00:51:21,012 --> 00:51:22,314
? Oh, my darling
Nellie Gray ?

814
00:51:22,314 --> 00:51:23,906
? Oh, my darling
Nellie Gray ?

815
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:27,007
? They have
taken you away ?

816
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,519
Mmm. Was it anything
important?

817
00:51:29,621 --> 00:51:32,317
No. It is Mr. Taylor.
He say excuse him,

818
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:35,621
he'll be here
in 10 minutes.
Mr. Taylor?

819
00:51:35,727 --> 00:51:38,662
He wanted to see me
about somethin',
didn't he?

820
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:43,030
Oh! Oh, goodness.
Goodness.

821
00:51:43,135 --> 00:51:45,035
What's the matter?

822
00:51:45,137 --> 00:51:48,038
I got a ruin
in my stocking.
Hmm?

823
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:53,544
Look.
Oh! You think
that's anything? Look.

824
00:52:07,826 --> 00:52:11,023
Ha-ha! Oh, say,

825
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:13,597
maybe we ought to have
something to eat, huh?

826
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:15,723
[Loganberry]
Uh... oh, Jack!

827
00:52:16,902 --> 00:52:18,836
Oh, no.
Ain't you hungry?

828
00:52:18,937 --> 00:52:21,838
No, I am on a diet.
Oh.

829
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:26,468
[Crying]
What's the matter,
another stocking?

830
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:29,979
No, I've got something
in my eye.
Oh, that's too bad.

831
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:32,982
Maybe I ought to get
a doctor.
Oh, no, Senator.

832
00:52:33,084 --> 00:52:35,484
I think maybe you
can get it out.

833
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:37,987
Have you got
a handkerchief?
A handkerchief?

834
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:40,990
I had a handkerchief.
What did I do with it?

835
00:52:41,092 --> 00:52:43,993
I got it here somepl...
Here it is.

836
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:50,199
Uh... which eye is it in?

837
00:52:50,302 --> 00:52:53,203
I think it's this one.
I don't see anything.

838
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:56,206
Maybe it's
the other one.
It must be
the other one.

839
00:52:56,308 --> 00:52:59,209
I think it's better
if you sit down.
Oh.

840
00:52:59,311 --> 00:53:01,211
And I also sit down.

841
00:53:01,313 --> 00:53:04,714
Now can you see better?
Oh, yeah, I think
I see somethin'.

842
00:53:04,816 --> 00:53:06,716
How's that?

843
00:53:06,818 --> 00:53:10,219
That's much better.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

844
00:53:10,322 --> 00:53:14,725
Say, this is funny,
isn't it?
What?

845
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:19,229
You're sitting
on my lap, ain't ya?
Oh, yes.

846
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:21,993
That's what I thought.
Do you like it?

847
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,000
I love it.

848
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:34,177
Uh, what was that?
Oh, that,
like a big flash?

849
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:36,179
Yeah.
That was love.

850
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:40,945
Oh. Say, let me sit
on your lap, will ya?

851
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,452
Oh, no. No.
I just want to try it.

852
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:46,456
I never sat on a girl's lap.
I just wanna try it.

853
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:49,959
Are you all ready?
Here I come. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

854
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:52,461
[Laughing]

855
00:53:57,302 --> 00:54:01,534
Are you comfortable?
I don't mind it a bit.
How do you feel?

856
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,609
I feel just like
Charlie McCarthy.

857
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:07,610
Hello, Mr. Bergen.
Hello, Charlie.

858
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:13,216
Am I wrinkling your dress?

859
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:15,218
No, I don't think so.

860
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,721
I don't want to wrinkle
such a pretty dress.

861
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:22,224
I'm glad I'm not
wrinklin'-in'-in'-in'.
No.

862
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:26,320
Heh, heh. Are you...
Are you... Are you sure...

863
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:29,832
I'm not too heavy for you?
No, not for me.

864
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:33,496
I'm afraid I'm too heavy.
I weigh almost 200 pounds.

865
00:54:33,605 --> 00:54:36,005
I... Oh ho-ho!

866
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:38,837
I... You mustn't do that.

867
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:41,037
I...

868
00:54:41,146 --> 00:54:44,343
[Jimmy]
Peeping toms. Now, you were
sitting right there,

869
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,349
ze young lady was
sitting on your lap,

870
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:48,851
your heads were together,
you were making love,

871
00:54:48,954 --> 00:54:51,855
and you were making
that $500 smile.

872
00:54:51,957 --> 00:54:54,687
Close-up, close-up.
Follow me.

873
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:57,523
[Loganberry]
Were we like thi...

874
00:54:57,629 --> 00:54:59,688
There goes love again!

875
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:01,698
You get everything
you need?

876
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,701
I got him from every angle
in the U.S. Camera Guide.
Okay.

877
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:09,038
Oh, Senator?
How about a little nightcap?

878
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,540
- Nightcap?
- Yeah, just try this on
for size.

879
00:55:11,643 --> 00:55:16,546
Ooh! I just happened
to think of somethin'.
What?

880
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:19,811
I just remembered
who he reminds me of.

881
00:55:19,918 --> 00:55:23,012
Who?
Jim Taylor.

882
00:55:23,121 --> 00:55:24,816
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Yeah.

883
00:55:24,923 --> 00:55:27,483
Jim Taylor?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

884
00:55:27,592 --> 00:55:29,651
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes.

885
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:32,161
If you didn't
have a mustache,

886
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:36,063
you'd be the spittin' image
of Jim Taylor.

887
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,067
Oh, you mean like this?

888
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:45,406
No, wrong again!
[Laughing]

889
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,874
I've bought you a costume.
Wait until you see it.

890
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:55,783
You'll be the sensation
of the Mardi Gras.
Will I?

891
00:55:55,887 --> 00:55:59,618
Oh, what's wrong, Marina?
You should be very excited.

892
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:03,660
Think of it. Mardi Gras
comes only once a year.

893
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:47,472

894

with nothing in his jeans ?

to sell you New Orleans ?

903
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:23,740
? Come on, come on and do all
the things there are to do ?

? In New Orleans ?

905
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:30,104
? Where'd ya think
that heat comes from ?

906
00:57:30,215 --> 00:57:32,775
? That rhythmic beat
comes from ?

907
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:35,876
? And that red meat comes from ?

908
00:57:35,987 --> 00:57:38,114
? New Orleans ?

909
00:57:38,223 --> 00:57:43,525
? Louisiana purchase

910
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:46,654
? So won't you let me
sell you New Orleans ?

911
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:48,994
? Come on, come on,
come on, come on along ?

912
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:54,172

? Louisiana purchase

915
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:09,548
? It means I'd like

that heat come from ?

? That rhythmic beat
come from ?

920

? Where does that heat
that rhythmic beat ?

921
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:26,464
? And that red meat come from ?

? I'll tell you what it means ?

? Come on along

[Laughing]

960
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:51,825
I want you boys to be the first
to know, now that we have
Loganberry where we want him...

961
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:55,831
and jail isn't staring us
in the face, Emmy Lou and I
are gonna get married.

962
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:59,061
Well,
congratulations!
Good for you!

963
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:02,037
I love him so much,
I could just die.

964
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:06,576
Uh-huh! She's always saying
that, but she never does!
[Laughing]

965
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:14,675
??

966
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:17,811
Senator, I've been
looking all over for you.

967
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:19,719
I haven't
thanked you enough.

968
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:22,353
Now, you...

969
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,588
You'll have to
break yourself
of that habit.
Why?

970
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:27,755
Don't you like it?
It's from my heart.

971
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:32,962
Well, I can't help where
it's from. I've got to
be a little careful.

972
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:35,698
You see,
I'm a dark horse.

973
01:04:35,806 --> 01:04:38,036
Well, you look
all right to me.

974
01:04:38,142 --> 01:04:40,872
No, you don't understand.
That's another expression...

975
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:44,937
for somebody who thinks
he can be president.
President!

976
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:49,076
Yeah, I've been a dark horse
for the last nine elections.

977
01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:52,246
Ever since you were
a little pony?
[Giggling]
Yeah.

978
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:57,453
They tried to give it to me
in 1940, but I outsmarted 'em.
Uh-huh.

979
01:04:57,562 --> 01:05:01,293
But next time,
I think I'll have a chance.
I'll show you how it figures.

980
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:06,200
Uh-huh.
There are 22,000,000 Republicans
who will vote the ticket...

981
01:05:06,304 --> 01:05:10,206
even if we put up
Li'I Abner.
Is he a Republican?

982
01:05:10,308 --> 01:05:15,007
Yeah.
And this investigation should
be worth at least 5,000,000.

983
01:05:15,112 --> 01:05:18,775
Mm-hmm.
The public loves
a good crusade.

984
01:05:18,883 --> 01:05:21,716
Makes 'em think
that we're looking out
for their interests.

985
01:05:21,819 --> 01:05:26,586
Oh, I'm glad
I came to America.
It's wonderful.

986
01:05:26,691 --> 01:05:30,855
Marina, would you mind
trying a dance with me?

987
01:05:30,962 --> 01:05:33,897
Of course! Come on.

988
01:05:33,998 --> 01:05:37,058
Well, Senator,
I've been looking
all over for you.

989
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:41,264
No wonder I didn't recognize
you. What are you supposed
to be, a used laundry bag?

990
01:05:41,372 --> 01:05:45,172
No, I'm still a senator.
I'm an old Roman now.

991
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,744
An old Roman!
Quite a Colosseum
you got there. Look...

992
01:05:47,845 --> 01:05:51,008
What is it?
I want to show you a picture
I found in an Easter egg.

993
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:53,015
Come here a second.

994
01:05:58,155 --> 01:06:01,784
Senator, I want you to meet
some members of the old
and now defunct firm.

995
01:06:01,892 --> 01:06:04,656
Colonel Davis, Senior
and Junior, Dean Manning
and Captain Whitfield.

996
01:06:04,762 --> 01:06:07,560
[Together]
How do you do?
How are you, gentlemen?

997
01:06:07,665 --> 01:06:10,725
You look like
a nice bunch of fellas.

998
01:06:10,835 --> 01:06:14,396
I'm sorry I've got to do
what I got to do,
but I gotta do it.

999
01:06:14,505 --> 01:06:19,340
You may not have to, Senator.
Here, take a look at this
and hold on to your eyebrows.

1000
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:22,378
It looks like a drunk.
Correct, Senator.

1001
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,473
You hit the nail right on
your head. Get a good look,
you may recognize who it is.

1002
01:06:26,584 --> 01:06:30,452
Say, wait a minute.
That looks like me.
That's right.

1003
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:33,819
That's either you
or a reasonably
plastered facsimile.

1004
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:36,791
I was never drunk.
No? Then how'd that
girl get in your lap?

1005
01:06:36,894 --> 01:06:41,092
Don't tell me that was
the only chair in the room.
I never had a drink in my life.

1006
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:45,931
All I had last night was
some Mississippi River water.
I got a witness.

1007
01:06:46,037 --> 01:06:48,301
I'll take this and give
you three witnesses
and six points.

1008
01:06:48,406 --> 01:06:52,365
Why, even your own
secretary can...

1009
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:57,436
That girl.
Say, that's you.

1010
01:06:57,548 --> 01:06:59,880
Yes.

1011
01:06:59,984 --> 01:07:02,714
Oh, I begin to get it.

1012
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:06,153
It was a frame-up
and she was in on it.

1013
01:07:06,257 --> 01:07:10,421
We're willing to leave that
to the American people or
Dr. Gallup. Take your choice.

1014
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:14,794
You mean you're
going to print this?
Not necessarily.

1015
01:07:14,899 --> 01:07:18,062
If you called off
the investigation,
we could forget about this.

1016
01:07:18,169 --> 01:07:20,899
You come down
with amnesia
and we'll catch it.

1017
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:25,999
There's a train pulling out
of here at midnight.
I'll give you a police escort.

1018
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,738
What do you say,
Senator?

1019
01:07:28,846 --> 01:07:31,940
Well, I guess
I'll have to take it.

1020
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:35,883
I got a record of 30 years
in the senate...

1021
01:07:35,986 --> 01:07:40,320
but it wouldn't hold up
against this picture.

1022
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:43,450
You're a pretty smart
fellow, Mr. Taylor.

1023
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:46,257
I kind of wish
you were a Republican.

1024
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,797
No hard feelings,
Senator.

1025
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:51,163
No, no hard feelings.

1026
01:07:51,268 --> 01:07:55,261
After all,
it's only politics.

1027
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:59,240
Only it might've been nice
to have had a chance...

1028
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:02,676
to be president.

1029
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,510
My sister
would've liked it.

1030
01:08:05,616 --> 01:08:09,347
You get your name
in all the history books
with the other presidents.

1031
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:13,719
Other presidents?
You mean there was somebody
before Roosevelt?

1032
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:16,019
Wait a minute.

1033
01:08:16,127 --> 01:08:19,585
Let me see that picture.
There's nothing bad about this.

1034
01:08:19,697 --> 01:08:23,758
No, maybe not for you.
But it'd mean ruin to me.

1035
01:08:23,868 --> 01:08:25,961
Anyway, you got
your mother in.

1036
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:27,970
You're still going
to bring her over?

1037
01:08:28,072 --> 01:08:30,905
I'm not going
to stop it now.

1038
01:08:31,008 --> 01:08:33,738
That'd be pretty cheap
revenge, wouldn't it?

1039
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:38,440
No wonder I love you.
Sure, that's why you
lov... What? Love?

1040
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:42,110
You call that love?
Why, you're almost old
enough to be his daughter.

1041
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:46,212
The senator and I got engaged
last night and here we are
celebrating before the marriage.

1042
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:48,416
Huh?
I smell a rat with
a Viennese accent.

1043
01:08:48,526 --> 01:08:51,086
Do you mean to say...
Do not try to hide it
from them, Oliver.

1044
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:54,995
You know I proposed
and you accepted.
Are you sure?

1045
01:08:55,099 --> 01:08:59,468
You're a little hysterical.
Why don't you creep off and hold

All right. Do you like

Come on!
Get goin'!

on the surface, it looks bad,

01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:56,426

it gets worse, doesn't it?

looks gray ?

to marry the senator.

But he's 60 years old,
if he's a day.

I will marry him if he's
90 years old, if he's a day.

Oh! But you don't
love the senator.

enough for marriage.

Jimmy Taylor likes you
a lot, you know.

in a much younger way
from the senator.

if I could marry Jimmy...

did you find out?

He tell me all about
you and your crooks.

sell out for, $600?
I do not what I do for money.

I do it because I like
people who are honest.

I suppose it's honest
to marry a man old enough
to be your grandfather.

1112

It is more honest
than framing him up.

self-defense. You're doing
what you're doing in cold blood.

marriage with me yourself.

were the last woman on earth!

If you were the last man on
earth, I would marry you. But
only if you were the last man!

You don't understand
why she's marrying the senator.

Why does her old lady
want to see me go to jail?

into the country.

to get out of the country.

one chance left for me.

And it's up to you.

of you first.

Marina, the investigation and
the White House if you want to.

mind to it and anything
else you can spare.

Emmy Lou. They told me she was
here. Now tell me, or I'll...

Honest, you're killing
an innocent man!

of a room upstairs.

There's been goings on
going on in here.

Well, Senator,
it looks bad.

Well... what do you think
they'll do to me?

1233
01:21:47,871 --> 01:21:51,238
You never know in Louisiana.
We're pretty hot-blooded
about our women.

So are the women.
They may lynch you.

anything, except that
you've got a neck.

Mr. Taylor,
I didn't do a thing.

Honest, I didn't.

Yet you admit there
were three women in here.
Yeah, at least three.

Do you know there's
a federal law covering that?

Do I know it?
Gosh, I helped pass it.

think of the future
when you pass laws?

Or didn't you think you'd
have a future like this?

Look, Ollie, let's lay our cards
on the bed, marked as they are.

1244
01:22:20,837 --> 01:22:25,433
After all, as a state
representative, I can pull wires
and straighten out this scandal.

1245
01:22:25,542 --> 01:22:29,273
There's no scandal.
Don't worry,
there will be.

1246
01:22:29,379 --> 01:22:32,246
All you have to do
is sign a statement that the

sign away my honor!

01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:08,617
I take it Madame Bordelaise's
made you very happy.

1327
01:28:08,718 --> 01:28:11,380
Ohh...

1328
01:28:11,487 --> 01:28:15,719
I don't know whether she's
made me happy, exactly, but...

1329
01:28:15,825 --> 01:28:18,487
she is interesting.

1330
01:28:20,763 --> 01:28:25,325
I've seen more gadgets
that I didn't know about.

1331
01:28:25,435 --> 01:28:29,895
Gadgets?
Yeah. My wife
wears a, uh...

1332
01:28:30,006 --> 01:28:31,371
A...

1333
01:28:31,474 --> 01:28:35,501
a contraption that looks
like a straitjacket.

1334
01:28:35,611 --> 01:28:38,307
I think they
call it a "griddle."

1335
01:28:38,414 --> 01:28:39,904
A griddle?
Yeah.

1336
01:28:40,016 --> 01:28:43,452
Oh, you mean a girdle,
don't you?
Girdle, yeah!

1337
01:28:43,553 --> 01:28:47,114
How did you know?
You never been married,
have ya?

1338
01:28:47,223 --> 01:28:50,590
No, but I read a lot.
And besides, the Louisiana
Purchasing Company...

1339
01:28:50,693 --> 01:28:52,991
also manufactures griddle...
I mean girdles.

1340
01:28:53,096 --> 01:28:57,465
Maybe you can tell me
how she gets into this thing.

1341
01:28:57,567 --> 01:29:02,004
It puzzles me because
there don't seem to be
any opening in it anywhere.

1342
01:29:02,105 --> 01:29:04,198
It can't go
over her head.

1343
01:29:04,307 --> 01:29:06,070
Oh, no, she'd
strangle to death.

1344
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:09,269
All she does is put her hands
in the girdle like that.
Yeah?

1345
01:29:09,379 --> 01:29:12,507
To open it. She couldn't
do it like that.
She'd break her wrist.

1346
01:29:12,615 --> 01:29:15,846
Oh, yeah.
Tear 'em right off. So, she
puts her hand in like that.

1347
01:29:15,952 --> 01:29:19,479
Then she puts one foot in
and then the other foot in.
Yeah.

1348
01:29:19,589 --> 01:29:22,490
And there she is,
in the girdle.
Yeah?

1349
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,992
[Chuckling]
She can't walk in it!

1350
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:31,465
She takes the one side
and she pulls it up.

1351
01:29:31,567 --> 01:29:34,627
Then she crosses her leg.
That makes it smaller.
Oh, yeah.

1352
01:29:34,737 --> 01:29:38,400
Then she pulls
the other side up.
Yeah.

1353
01:29:38,508 --> 01:29:40,908
Then she...

1354
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:43,410
[Grunting]

1355
01:29:47,016 --> 01:29:50,679
[Laughing]

1356
01:29:50,787 --> 01:29:55,383
Now it's on.
Well, this part's up, but
that part's still down there.

1357
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:06,802
Goes up in the back.
Yeah, it's coming.

1358
01:30:12,475 --> 01:30:17,037
[Laughing]
And there it is,
all one piece.

1359
01:30:17,146 --> 01:30:19,137
Equal distribution.

1360
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:21,478
By golly,
that's very ingenious.

1361
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:26,214
Oh! There are two things on
the sides with snappers on the
end of'em. What are they for?

1362
01:30:26,322 --> 01:30:28,483
Oh, those things
are to hold her
stockings up, too.

1363
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:32,789
How can she walk
with that harness on?
It's easy. Just try it.

1364
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:35,295
Follow me.

1365
01:30:47,643 --> 01:30:49,338
[Murmuring]

1366
01:30:49,445 --> 01:30:52,346
The House will
please come to order.

1367
01:30:56,586 --> 01:30:59,020
Next on our agenda...

1368
01:30:59,122 --> 01:31:03,354
are certain charges
brought against the
Louisiana Purchasing Company...

1369
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:05,791
and members of
the local government.

1370
01:31:05,895 --> 01:31:07,590
Gentlemen, please.
Please.

1371
01:31:07,697 --> 01:31:12,634
Charges brought by Senator
Oliver P. Loganberry...

1372
01:31:12,735 --> 01:31:14,930
of a northern state.

1373
01:31:15,037 --> 01:31:16,664
[Murmuring]

1374
01:31:16,772 --> 01:31:18,831
Mr. Speaker...

1375
01:31:18,941 --> 01:31:21,273
Mr. Speaker!
[Gavel Pounding]

1376
01:31:21,377 --> 01:31:24,642
The chair recognizes
the gentleman from New Orleans.

1377
01:31:24,747 --> 01:31:27,773
But, Mr. Speaker,
I raised my hand first.

1378
01:31:27,884 --> 01:31:30,614
And besides,
I'm bringing the charges.

1379
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,883
Don't worry,
this won't take forever.
What is this?

1380
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:37,517
It's a filibuster, Senator!
[Murmuring]

1381
01:31:37,627 --> 01:31:40,255
Hey, Ed,
it's a filibuster. Yeah.

1382
01:31:40,363 --> 01:31:44,390
If Taylor holds the floor
for three days,
he's got Loganberry licked.

1383
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,333
The senator's due back
in his home state
for a political rally.

1384
01:31:47,436 --> 01:31:49,870
You can't do this!

1385
01:31:49,972 --> 01:31:53,135
Oh, yes, I can.
I got special permission
from Jimmy Stewart.

1386
01:31:54,544 --> 01:31:57,240
Gentlemen, I want to start
this auspicious occasion...

1387
01:31:57,346 --> 01:32:00,975
by reading a brief statement
on the glories of the South.

1388
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:04,382
Gone with the Wind...
[Laughter, Gavel Pounding]

1389
01:32:04,487 --> 01:32:06,387
By Margaret Mitchell.

1390
01:32:12,028 --> 01:32:15,156
"She could get Rhett back,
she knew she could.

1391
01:32:15,264 --> 01:32:19,200
"There'd never been a man
she couldn't get once she set
her mind upon him.

1392
01:32:19,302 --> 01:32:23,329
"I'll think of it all tomorrow,
at Tara. I can stand it then.

1393
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:25,669
"Tomorrow I'll think
of some way
to get him back.

1394
01:32:25,775 --> 01:32:29,040
After all, tomorrow
is another day."

1395
01:32:29,145 --> 01:32:33,548
Oh, the glorious South.
[Murmuring]

1396
01:32:33,649 --> 01:32:36,618
Mr. Speaker!

1397
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:37,777
Quiet, Yankee!

1398
01:32:37,887 --> 01:32:39,184
[All]
Quiet, Yankee!

1399
01:32:39,288 --> 01:32:43,918
But I have to get home.
I've got business to attend to.

1400
01:32:44,026 --> 01:32:48,087
You better give up.
I'm gonna be talkin' a long
while and I know how to talk.

1401
01:32:48,197 --> 01:32:51,860
My father was
a tobacco auctioneer
and my mother was a woman.

1402
01:32:51,968 --> 01:32:54,732
You better give up.
Never. Never!

1403
01:32:54,837 --> 01:32:57,931
Okay. Let's see
what's in the paper.
Ohhh.

1404
01:32:59,809 --> 01:33:04,109
I tell ya, this is a wonderful
country we're living in.
You can always get help.

1405
01:33:04,213 --> 01:33:06,807
You can get cooperation
any time you...

1406
01:33:06,916 --> 01:33:09,976
Hi, Mr. Taylor.
Oh, hiya.

1407
01:33:10,086 --> 01:33:11,383
Thank you.

1408
01:33:11,487 --> 01:33:14,149
This'll just give you
a rough idea.

1409
01:33:14,257 --> 01:33:16,953
"Friends, do you need money?
We can help you.

1410
01:33:17,059 --> 01:33:20,495
"You can have as high as $500.
No security, no endorsers.

1411
01:33:20,596 --> 01:33:23,497
"You don't even
have to have a job.
Pay the money back any time.

1412
01:33:23,599 --> 01:33:26,329
And when paid back,
we let your mother
out of the dungeon."

1413
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:28,335
Now, I just...

1414
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:31,838
Back in vaudeville.

1415
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:35,104
[Clapping]
Good morning, good morning.

1416
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:37,577
A funny thing happened
on the way to the senate.

1417
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:40,877
There was a lady standing
in the rain, holding her
dress up over her hat.

1418
01:33:40,983 --> 01:33:43,952
I said, "Lady, you're
gettin' your legs wet."
She said, "I don't care.

1419
01:33:44,053 --> 01:33:46,886
My legs are 50 years old.
The hat's brand new."

1420
01:33:46,989 --> 01:33:50,789
"Mother bear cooked
a pot of porridge
and poured it into three bowls,

1421
01:33:50,893 --> 01:33:55,853
"a big bowl, a middle-sized bowl
and a small bowl and left it on
the table to cool.

1422
01:33:55,965 --> 01:33:58,832
"Then the bears
went out for a walk.

1423
01:33:58,934 --> 01:34:02,028
"They had such a good time,
they stayed until...

1424
01:34:02,138 --> 01:34:05,164
"the small bear got
quite tired and hungry.

1425
01:34:05,274 --> 01:34:09,608
"While they were away, a
little girl called Goldilocks,
because of her golden hair,

1426
01:34:09,712 --> 01:34:13,170
"passed by the bears' house
and knocked on the door.

1427
01:34:13,282 --> 01:34:17,685
"There was no answer,
but Goldilocks saw an open
window and climbed through it.

1428
01:34:17,787 --> 01:34:22,053
"The first thing she found
was a table with three
bowls of porridge.

1429
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:24,592
[Amplified]
"The porridge smelled so good,
it made her hungry.

1430
01:34:24,694 --> 01:34:27,797
"She tasted the porridge
in the big bear's bowl.
It was too hot.

1431
01:34:27,797 --> 01:34:28,729
"She tasted the porridge
in the big bear's bowl.
It was too hot.

1432
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:33,325
"But the wee, small bear's
porridge was just right,
so she ate it all up.

1433
01:34:33,436 --> 01:34:36,371
"She tried the middle-sized
bear's chair.
That was too high.

1434
01:34:36,472 --> 01:34:40,067
"Then she tried the wee,
small bear's chair,

1435
01:34:40,176 --> 01:34:42,736
"and it broke
all to pieces.

1436
01:34:42,845 --> 01:34:44,972
"Goldilocks went
into the bears' bedroom.

1437
01:34:45,081 --> 01:34:47,515
"The big bear's bed
was much too big,

1438
01:34:47,616 --> 01:34:50,346
"and the middle-sized bear's bed
seemed a little hard.

1439
01:34:50,453 --> 01:34:53,581
"But the wee, small bear's bed
was so comfortable,

1440
01:34:53,689 --> 01:34:56,351
"Goldilocks went
right to sleep.

1441
01:34:56,459 --> 01:34:59,690
It was just about then
that the three bear..."
[Clears Throat]

1442
01:34:59,795 --> 01:35:02,821
Huh. Can you imagine?

1443
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:07,892
Another drink.

1444
01:35:08,003 --> 01:35:11,996
And with the chalk in hand,
the vagabond finished
the sketch...

1445
01:35:12,108 --> 01:35:15,271
of a face that well might
buy the soul of any man.

1446
01:35:15,378 --> 01:35:20,247
And as he placed another lock
upon that shapely head,

1447
01:35:20,349 --> 01:35:22,442
with a fearful shriek,

1448
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:26,954
he leaped and fell across
the picture, dead!

[Murmuring]

1450
01:35:31,327 --> 01:35:35,320
Only acting, Senator. I hope.
[All]
Ohhh!

1451
01:35:37,299 --> 01:35:40,826
Ah. Beautiful hair.

1452
01:35:40,936 --> 01:35:42,870
Dandruff.

1453
01:35:42,972 --> 01:35:47,466
"Invention number 9,412
is a snood for a chicken.

1454
01:35:47,576 --> 01:35:49,737
"You slip the snood over
the back end of the chicken...

1455
01:35:49,845 --> 01:35:53,440
and when she lays an egg,
she brings it to ya."

1456
01:35:53,549 --> 01:35:55,744
Let's forget inventions
and take up cooking.

1457
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:59,184
Jim Taylor's epic struggle
has been going on now
for three days...

1458
01:35:59,288 --> 01:36:02,086
and this remarkable man
shows some signs of weakening.

1459
01:36:02,191 --> 01:36:04,751
Water! Water!

1460
01:36:06,195 --> 01:36:09,790
Water, water, everywhere
and not a drop to drink!

01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:13,494
That's all, folks!

Mr. Speaker!
Gentlemen!

1467
01:36:36,692 --> 01:36:39,456
I have absolute proof
that Mr. Jim Taylor...

1468
01:36:39,562 --> 01:36:42,827
has been the innocent victim
of a bunch of crooks.

I'm turning over
my evidence to the state.

01:36:52,808 --> 01:36:56,938
Now, I'm quite sure
that you gentlemen are able
