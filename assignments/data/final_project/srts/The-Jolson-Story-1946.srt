1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,800
Over here.

3
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,000
Steve Martin's the name.

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,200
It grew.

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you. Tell you what I'll do.

6
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,300
You call out a tune, and I'll play it.

7
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
<i>Stay in Your Own Backyard.</i>

8
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,300
Too dirty back there.

9
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,500
- Any other tune?
- <i>Banks of the Wabash.</i>

10
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,100
<i>Banks of the Wabash.</i> All right.
Now I'll tell you what I'll do.

11
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,200
I'll play it if you folks will sing it. Right?

12
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,900
The key of C, Professor.

13
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
So you won't sing?

14
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,600
Am I asking you to do me a favor?
I'm doing you a favor.

15
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,100
When you sing, what happens?

16
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,800
Your lungs get full of oxygen.
It puts roses on your cheeks.

17
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,300
As a matter of fact, you either sing out,
or you get out.

18
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,500
Now that we understand each other,
let's go, Professor.

19
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,400
<i>The breath of new-mown hay</i>

20
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,700
<i>Through the sycamores</i>

21
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,100
<i>the candle lights are gleaming</i>

22
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,400
<i>on the banks of the Wabash, far away</i>

23
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,300
Fine. Stand up and let the folks see you.

24
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
Don't be bashful. Come on, stand right up.

25
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,500
Come on, folks, let's make him stand up.

26
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,700
Attaboy! Let's have it again.

27
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Give that boy a spotlight!

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Professor, let's have the chorus again.

29
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,200
<i>Oh, the moonlight's fair tonight</i>

30
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,500
<i>along the Wabash</i>

31
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,100
<i>From the fields there comes the breath</i>

32
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,700
<i>of new-mown hay</i>

33
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,100
<i>Through the sycamores</i>

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,300
<i>the candle lights are gleaming</i>

35
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,700
<i>on the banks of the Wabash</i>

36
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,300
<i>far away</i>

37
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,000
- What's your name?
- Asa Yoelson.

38
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,200
Are you in show business?

39
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,500
No, sir, I'm not.

40
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,800
Where'd you learn to sing like that?

41
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,100
I sing with my father at the synagogue.

42
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,300
- Where?
- At the...

43
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,600
The synagogue!

44
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,300
Wait a minute!

45
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Sonny, wait a minute!

46
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Answer me, Asa.
Where were you all that time?

47
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,300
You came like someone
who is running a race.

48
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,100
It's not good to run a race with God, Asa.

49
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,800
Where were you, Asa?

50
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,800
I was... singing.

51
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You mean you stayed home?

52
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,200
- Practicing, is that what you mean?
- No.

53
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Then where were you singing?
Stop cracking your knuckles.

54
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,300
In the street, maybe?

55
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,400
That's not exactly where I was singing.

56
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,800
Singing prayers in the street.

57
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,500
- No, not exactly.
- Exactly?

58
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,000
You must have been exactly somewhere...

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,100
singing exactly something...

60
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,100
- and for some exact reason.
- Yes, Papa.

61
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,800
My name is Martin.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

62
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
Hello, Asa.

63
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,000
You're Cantor Yoelson. I'm Steve Martin.

64
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,300
- How do you do?
- I'm glad to know you.

65
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,000
Your son has a real voice.

66
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You were at the synagogue today
for the service?

67
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,700
Me? No. I just went by there to find out
where you lived.

68
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Then where did you hear my son sing?

69
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,800
- At Kernan's.
- Kernan's?

70
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,600
Yeah. The burlesque house
a few blocks from here.

71
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,500
The burlesque theater?

72
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,200
- Don't you ever go there?
- No, I do not.

73
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,200
That boy's got a future in show business.

74
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,800
I've looked for something like him
for a long time.

75
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,900
I'd like to make him a regular part of the act.

76
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,300
You've nothing to worry about.

77
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,500
I'm booked solid for the season.
I move on to Baltimore tonight.

78
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
- Baltimore.
- I know he's pretty young...

79
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,900
but when a boy's got a voice like that,
he ought to let people hear it.

80
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,600
You're right, Mr. Martin. Asa will sing.

81
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,500
But where his people have always sung.

82
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,100
I know how you feel.

83
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,000
It's a beautiful thing to sing in church,
but there's a lot to say for the theater, too.

84
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,200
If you're worried
about my taking care of him...

85
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,000
Excuse me, Mr. Martin.

86
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,800
I think I know what's best for my son.

87
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,000
I was afraid that's how you'd feel about it.

88
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,700
Sorry, Asa.

89
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,000
- Good night.
- Good night.

90
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,400
I want your promise
that you'll never go to that place again.

91
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,500
I can't.

92
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,500
- I can't promise.
- Go to your room.

93
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,700
Ann, go downstairs and get a ladder.
Put it here.

94
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,900
- Why?
- Hurry up. Get the ladder.

95
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,400
What'd you bring me here for?
Why don't you let me find Steve Martin?

96
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,700
What kind of a car was that
you jumped out of?

97
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,300
A cattle car.
What difference does that make?

98
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,000
All the difference in the world, my boy.

99
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,200
- Here's another one, Father.
- Let me go.

100
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes, let him go, Riley. Don't mind him.

101
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,600
He just thinks he has to behave
like a policeman.

102
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,300
I don't think he understands boys.

103
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,900
No? I've only got seven of them myself.

104
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,600
That's just what I mean.

105
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,300
Now, suppose you tell me about yourself.

106
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,600
Where are you from?

107
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,400
- Where was he picked up?
- In the freight yard.

108
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,300
He came in on a cattle car. Can't you tell?

109
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,000
If you knew about freight trains,
you'd never pick a cattle car.

110
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
- I had to get here.
- To Baltimore? Why?

111
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,200
- He's got a job here.
- What kind of job?

112
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,800
- Singing.
- Singing? Where?

113
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,100
In a show with Steve Martin.
He's in Baltimore right now.

114
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,100
What about your family?
Do they know about this?

115
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,900
I see.

116
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,400
Before we do anything else,
I think you'd better have a hot bath.

117
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
- And something to eat, John.
- Come on, my boy.

118
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Why don't you find Steve Martin
and ask him?

119
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,600
That's just what I'll do.

120
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,400
Since it's singing he's interested in,
why not let him sing?

121
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,300
Sing?

122
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Tell me a little more about your work
in the theater, Mr. Martin.

123
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
I've told you about all there is.

124
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,600
Pardon me, Father. I don't get it.

125
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,700
Why would you be bringing me here,
asking me all these questions?

126
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,400
- Is there something you want me to do?
- I'll come to the point in a little while.

127
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,900
- Cantor Yoelson? I'm Father McGee.
- How do you do?

128
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,300
Mrs. Yoelson.

129
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,000
Hello, glad to see you again.

130
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,900
- You know Mr. Martin?
- We know him.

131
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,300
- Is our boy here?
- The description is like Asa.

132
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,900
I have a very strong feeling that...

133
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,800
So have I.

134
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,400
Singing without his cap on.

135
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,100
It's not so much what's on the head
as what's in the heart...

136
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,200
is it, Cantor?

137
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,200
Hello, Mama. Hello, Papa.
Beautiful song, wasn't it?

138
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,100
Get ready, Asa. We're going home.

139
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,600
I'll do it again, Papa. I'll run away.

140
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,500
- I'll find Mr. Martin someplace.
- Now wait, Asa.

141
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,100
I wouldn't have you in the act
if I didn't have your father's consent.

142
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,200
Then I'll get in another act.
I'll keep running away.

143
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
- What are we going to do with him?
- We'll decide that at home.

144
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,600
Maybe we should decide now, Papa.

145
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,900
You said you would take
very good care of our boy?

146
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,600
- You would consider this foolishness?
- I'm only asking, Papa.

147
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,700
If Asa is going to keep running away,
I have a right to ask.

148
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,100
I made inquiries about Mr. Martin.
He's a man who can be trusted.

149
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,100
I'm sorry I started all this trouble
and I wouldn't have more to do with it...

150
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,200
but considering his feelings
about show business...

151
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,300
Show business!

152
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Tell me, Mr. Martin,
exactly what would Asa do?

153
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,400
The same as I did at Kernan's, Mama.

154
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,100
- Isn't that what you mean, Mr. Martin?
- Yes.

155
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Mr. Martin's onstage asking everybody
to sing, but nobody does...

156
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
'cause they're waiting
for someone else to begin.

157
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm up in the balcony, and Mr. Martin says:

158
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,300
"Come on, folks! Join in the chorus!"

159
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,700
"Don't be bashful. All together now."

160
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,800
All of a sudden,
I stand up in the balcony and start singing.

161
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,200
I'm dumbfounded at the kid's voice,
and I say:

162
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,900
"Give that boy a spotlight!"

163
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,400
"Give that boy a spotlight!"

164
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,700
<i>I love you</i>

165
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,600
<i>as I've never loved before</i>

166
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,200
<i>Since first I met you</i>

167
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,800
<i>on the village green</i>

168
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,300
<i>Come to me</i>

169
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,300
<i>or my dream of love</i>

170
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,000
<i>is over</i>

171
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,700
<i>I love you as I loved you</i>

172
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,700
<i>when you were sweet</i>

173
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,300
<i>when you were sweet</i>

174
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,600
<i>sixteen</i>

175
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,200
"Next week, Philadelphia, then Pittsburgh.

176
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,900
"Feeling fine.
Your loving son, Asa Yoelson."

177
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,200
He's feeling fine.

178
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,900
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh.

179
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,900
Washington was too small for Asa.

180
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,000
<i>- "Indianapolis."</i>
<i>- Indians! He'll come home scalped yet.</i>

181
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,500
<i>"Kickabock."</i>

182
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,900
<i>- Is this in the United States, Papa?</i>
<i>- Don't be foolish!</i>

183
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,900
<i>- No. That's pronounced Di-bi-kah.</i>
<i>- Dubuque!</i>

184
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,900
<i>Anyway, in Dubuque, he sang two encores.</i>

185
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,700
Now spell "tedious."

186
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,900
T-E-D-O...

187
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,000
Wait a minute. That's wrong.
Try again. "Tedious."

188
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,100
You wouldn't know to spell it
if you didn't have that book.

189
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm not learning. I'm teaching.

190
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,700
<i>By the light</i>

191
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,200
<i>of the silvery moon, moon</i>

192
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,300
<i>I want to spoon</i>

193
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,800
<i>to my honey I'll croon love's tune</i>

194
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,000
<i>Honey moon</i>

195
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
<i>keep a-shinin' in June</i>

196
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:18,300
<i>Your silv'ry beams will bring love dreams</i>

197
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,100
<i>We'll be cuddling soon</i>

198
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,400
<i>by the silvery moon</i>

199
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,500
Just a minute.

200
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,900
How come suddenly
in the middle of the song...

201
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,300
you put in a "moo-moo"?

202
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,000
I thought it would be a little better that way.

203
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,800
You thought it would be a little better?

204
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,600
If the guy who wrote the song
wanted to say "moo-moo"...

205
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,800
he'd write it that way.

206
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,000
I just get tired of singing it
the same way every time.

207
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,900
- So you thought up "moo-moo"?
- I didn't think it. It just came out.

208
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,400
It just came out?

209
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,000
Don't let it come out!

210
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,800
Sing that song just like it's written...

211
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,600
and I don't want to hear
no more "moo-moos."

212
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
- Yes, sir.
- How do you like that?

213
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,300
He gets tired singing it the same way...

214
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,100
so he puts in "moo-moo."

215
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
As if that makes any difference.
And another thing...

216
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,900
you're singing it a little faster every night.
Is that because you're tired, too?

217
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,700
No. That's because you're playing it
too slow.

218
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm playing it slow?

219
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,200
Excuse me.

220
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,400
I've only been in this business for 30 years,
making a very nice living.

221
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,000
But maybe an old trouper like you
ought to come on stage...

222
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,900
I thought of that.
I could sing much better on the stage.

223
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,300
You don't tell me.

224
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,700
Then I can sing right to them
instead of the backs of their heads...

225
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,300
- and I could see how their faces look.
- The faces?

226
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,900
Unless you can see the people's faces,
it's no good at all.

227
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,000
You don't say. And tell me, Mr. Yoelson...

228
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,700
with that spotlight
shining right in your eyes...

229
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
- how are you gonna see faces?
- That's easy.

230
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,800
If you turn up all the lights in the theater,
then they can see me, and I can see them.

231
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,100
Asa in long pants.

232
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,900
<i>Goodbye, my bluebell</i>

233
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,400
<i>farewell to you</i>

234
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,100
<i>One last fond look</i>

235
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,100
<i>into your eyes so blue</i>

236
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,500
<i>'Mid campfires gleaming</i>

237
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,500
<i>'mid shot and shell</i>

238
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
<i>Goodbye</i>

239
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,800
- You don't wanna be in the act anymore?
- No, Steve.

240
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,500
I'm going home.

241
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,700
Don't be silly.
Your voice is changing, that's all.

242
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,400
In a couple of years,
you'll get it back, better than ever.

243
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,800
And listen, the way
you pulled that whistle out of the hat...

244
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,300
that's showmanship.
Didn't you hear them applaud?

245
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,900
- But it isn't the same.
- What isn't the same?

246
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,900
The act's just as good as it was before.

247
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
When you whistle,
their faces don't look the same.

248
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,900
Faces again. This kid'll drive me crazy.

249
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,400
Listen, I didn't say you're gonna whistle
the rest of your life.

250
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,100
Just for a while.
Look, know what we're gonna do?

251
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,500
We're gonna work up
some whistling routines...

252
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,300
and you're gonna
work on the stage with me.

253
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
What do you think of that?

254
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,900
And do you know something else?
Then you're gonna get billing.

255
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,900
Yes, sir!

256
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,300
"Meet that scintillating team of artists:
Steve Martin and Asa Yoelson."

257
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,400
Asa Yoelson.

258
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,400
"Now I whistle in the act.
Everyone seems to like it.

259
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,400
"Your loving son..."

260
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,700
- Papa, Asa isn't Asa anymore!
- What?

261
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,900
<i>In Reno, Papa, he's picking up time.</i>

262
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,800
<i>Is time something you can pick up?</i>
<i>This is crazy.</i>

263
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,600
<i>This town they liked so much,</i>
<i>they named it twice.</i>

264
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,400
<i>He says he can't come home this summer.</i>
<i>Maybe next spring.</i>

265
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,900
<i>Since first I met you</i>

266
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,300
<i>on the village green</i>

267
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,200
- Listen.
- What's the matter?

268
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,800
<i>Come to me</i>

269
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,300
<i>for my dream of love</i>

270
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,100
<i>is all</i>

271
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,400
<i>I love you as I loved you</i>

272
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,500
<i>When you were sweet</i>

273
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,300
<i>When you were sweet</i>

274
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,000
<i>sixteen</i>

275
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
What do you think?

276
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,500
Are we going into this again
in the middle of the night?

277
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,100
- It's getting better every time.
- All right, it's getting better.

278
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,800
I told you, let it alone. Give yourself time.

279
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,200
- Go away. Go sing in the bathroom.
- Why not let me try?

280
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,000
You mean all of a sudden,
tomorrow maybe...

281
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,900
- in the middle of the act, you wanna sing?
- Why not?

282
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,700
- You're daffy.
- Why?

283
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,600
We're changing no act
in the middle of the season...

284
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,100
and fall flat on our face.

285
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,300
We're gonna do like I said.

286
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,200
We're gonna knock off a month next spring.

287
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,800
Won't take no. Never stops.

288
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,500
This guy'll drive me crazy.

289
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,600
<i>He's getting close to home.</i>
<i>We'll see him soon, Papa.</i>

290
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,700
- Hello, Pop. How's tricks?
- Letter for you.

291
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,700
Mama. Always on time.

292
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,500
- Overture!
- Come on, Al.

293
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,800
Mama's excited.
Three more weeks, and we go home.

294
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,400
- I could use a nice month's rest.
- Not a month.

295
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,900
I don't want to stay home that long.
Just a few days.

296
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,300
We have to work on the new act
and the stuff I'll sing.

297
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,700
I know. There'll be time.
Take it easy. Just relax.

298
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,000
- Stop arguing.
- Just humming a little.

299
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,300
When you sing,
it means you're getting ideas.

300
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,900
I was thinking of something.

301
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,400
In Nashville and Charleston,
the last two dates...

302
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,700
why can't I sing just one chorus
of <i>Sweet Sixteen?</i>

303
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,300
- No.
- Just to see how it sounds.

304
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,500
Won't matter if I flop.

305
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,600
Just in Charleston, then.
Let me sing it once the last night.

306
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,000
That little Connolly kid
is awful sweet on you.

307
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,600
Give her a tumble
and get your mind on something else.

308
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,700
- Don't you think of girls?
- I haven't got time.

309
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,300
All I'm asking is just one chance. That's all...

310
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,500
Stop arguing!

311
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,500
I bet the Kentucky Derby winner.

312
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
I win a snootful!

313
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,700
A snootful is right. You better get ready.

314
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,000
I got ready, boy, and I win!

315
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,300
Get yourself together.
You're on in a little while.

316
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,900
- I'll be there with flying colors.
- He can't go on like that.

317
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,900
We better tell Jonesy to skip the act,
and get ready ourselves.

318
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,100
You get made up.

319
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,300
- I gotta try and pull this guy together.
- All right, but hurry up.

320
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,800
There's a big derby crowd out there tonight.
The house is packed. You gotta go on.

321
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm raring to go.

322
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,600
Oscar Hammerstein and Lew Dockstader!
What are they doing here?

323
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,300
Down for the races.

324
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,200
Why did you drag me here
when we could've been playing poker?

325
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,800
Anything on a stage, Oscar, and I love it.
I see them all.

326
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,700
- You're on, Mr. Baron.
- Ready.

327
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,700
Anytime you're ready to go, Lew.

328
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,000
Tom, you're all right? Where's Al?

329
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,400
He was with you, wasn't he?
Where did he go?

330
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
All right, Tom.

331
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,200
Tom, come on, get out there. Hurry up!

332
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,400
<i>There's a little bunch of sweetness</i>

333
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,100
<i>that I long to call my bride</i>

334
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,400
<i>And believe me, I'm not happy</i>

335
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,400
<i>But, baby</i>

336
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,700
Funny thing,
I've sung this song a thousand times...

337
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,600
Why I forgot it tonight, I don't know.

338
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,700
<i>You'll hear me call her name</i>

339
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,100
I got it now.

340
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,100
<i>Rosie, you are my posie</i>

341
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,800
<i>You are my heart's bouquet</i>

342
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,400
<i>Come out here in the moonlight</i>

343
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,200
<i>There's something sweet love, I want to say</i>

344
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,600
<i>Your honey boy, I'm waiting</i>

345
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,800
<i>Those ruby lips to greet</i>

346
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,100
<i>Don't be so aggravating</i>

347
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Baron's developed a very nice style.
Very nice.

348
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,800
<i>Rosie</i>

349
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,300
<i>you are my posie</i>

350
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,600
<i>You are my heart's bouquet</i>

351
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,900
<i>Come out here in the moonlight</i>

352
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,400
<i>there's something sweet love</i>

353
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,500
<i>I'm gonna sing about my baby, your honey</i>

354
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,000
<i>Your boy, I'm waiting</i>

355
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,500
<i>Those ruby, those lips to greet</i>

356
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,000
<i>Don't be so aggravating</i>

357
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,800
<i>My blushin' Rosie</i>

358
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,400
<i>my posie sweet!</i>

359
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,000
Did you hear that finish?

360
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,100
Come on, Tom. Get out there!

361
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,700
I don't know any more of Tom's songs.

362
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,900
Take a bow and collapse.
Get yourself off! Go on!

363
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,300
- What's the matter?
- He's sick.

364
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,100
- Let me help you.
- I'll take him back.

365
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,600
Jimmy, get the adagio team. Hurry up!

366
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,100
I'll murder you!

367
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Give me that key to Baron's room.
He could get thrown out.

368
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,600
But the way I sang that finish.

369
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,800
Give me that key.
We gotta get Tom on his feet.

370
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,700
Get that make up off and you get yours on.

371
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,200
The stage manager
will be here to see if you died.

372
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,600
- I gotta go on!
- Get this through your head.

373
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,600
You've been on. You just came off.

374
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,100
- You got sick and quit after the first song.
- I did?

375
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,400
Don't you understand?

376
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,900
You weren't on at all. You couldn't make it.

377
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,500
- That idiot went on and sang for you.
- You were a big hit, Tom.

378
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I'll talk to you later. Get that makeup off.

379
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,900
He's all right, Jonesy.
Nothing to worry about.

380
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Mr. Hammerstein and Mr. Dockstader
are here to see him.

381
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,600
Hammerstein? Dockstader?

382
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,900
- What's the matter? Let me in!
- Just a minute!

383
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,800
Are you all right?
Did you hear what I told you?

384
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,300
- See, you were a big hit.
- Keep still.

385
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,200
Come in, gentlemen.

386
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,700
He's feeling much better.
Just a little indigestion.

387
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,200
Mr. Baron, gentlemen.
Mr. Dockstader, Mr. Hammerstein.

388
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm glad to know you.
You were great out there tonight.

389
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,900
- Sorry you couldn't do more.
- Thank you, Mr. Hammerstein.

390
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,600
This is Steve Martin, gentlemen.

391
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,000
How are you? My partner, Al Jolson.

392
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,000
- How do you do?
- Martin and Jolson.

393
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,800
I have an idea you might do very well
at Hammerstein's Victoria...

394
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,800
if you'd consider opening in two weeks?

395
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,400
I don't know, Mr. Hammerstein.

396
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,100
That's wonderful. He gets an offer
to play on Broadway and he doesn't know.

397
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,600
That's a great break.

398
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,200
I don't carry a contract around with me,
but anything will do.

399
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,400
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Who me?

400
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Outside.

401
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,600
I'm certain we won't have any trouble
about the terms.

402
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,900
Yes, sir, you're going to enjoy
playing my theater.

403
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
What did you say your name was?

404
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,400
Al Jolson.

405
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,200
- Did you ever sing in blackface?
- Him? Never.

406
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,700
You see, he just whistles, Mr. Dockstader.

407
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,400
Blacks up behind the ears to whistle.

408
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,900
I've seen Baron work before.

409
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,600
Hammerstein hasn't.

410
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,300
- I'll go and explain to Mr. Hammerstein.
- I wouldn't.

411
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,500
Hammerstein knows what he's doing.

412
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,700
I don't tell tales.

413
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,700
As for you, Jolson...

414
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,200
you can join Dockstader's Minstrels
in St. Louis next week.

415
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,700
You don't mean it.

416
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,100
- You hear that?
- That's from heaven!

417
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,900
St. Louis next week.

418
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,600
We'd have to leave the show on Saturday.
We can fix that, can't we?

419
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,800
Sure. There's a lot of new stuff
we're planning to put in the act.

420
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,500
- We'll have it ready Saturday.
- I can't use an act.

421
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,600
I only have a place for one man.

422
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,000
You mean you just want me?

423
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,200
What did you think?
What would I be doing with minstrels?

424
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,200
Steve and I have been together a long time
and we're working up a lot of new ideas.

425
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,500
Not me. You.
But this is what a guy like you prays for.

426
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,500
- Dockstader's Minstrels in one jump.
- Where you can sing your head off.

427
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,100
You mean the job calls for a singer?

428
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,500
What are you talking about?
What did you think?

429
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,900
Then I wouldn't be interested.
See, I like whistling.

430
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,900
Steve and I argue about that all the time.
He wants me to sing...

431
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,300
but at heart I'm a whistler.
It makes me happy.

432
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,700
- Martin and Jolson, five minutes.
- That's us.

433
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,800
Thanks a lot.
If you need a whistler, let me know.

434
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,700
Be with you in a minute, Steve.

435
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,300
When are you leaving town, Mr. Dockstader?

436
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,800
Tomorrow evening.

437
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,300
I might drop around to your hotel
in the morning.

438
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,500
I wonder what the porter did
with my bags. They're not here.

439
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,000
- Must be on the train somewhere.
- I'll see.

440
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,400
Hello, Jolson.

441
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,600
Hello, Mr. Dockstader.
I thought you were going to St. Louis.

442
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,600
I am. So are you.

443
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,700
- All aboard!
- Where's Steve?

444
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,700
He's not coming.

445
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,800
- Then I'm on the wrong train.
- No, you're not! This is the right train.

446
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,300
Steve wants you to go with me.

447
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,400
- I can't do it, Mr. Dockstader.
- But you're throwing away a great chance.

448
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,300
<i>I want a girl</i>
<i>Just like the girl</i>

449
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,600
<i>That married dear old Dad</i>

450
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>She was a pearl</i>

451
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,800
<i>And the only girl</i>
<i>That Daddy ever had</i>

452
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,300
<i>A good old-fashioned girl with heart so true</i>

453
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,700
<i>One who loves nobody else but you</i>

454
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,800
<i>And that's why I want a girl</i>
<i>Just like the girl</i>

455
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,600
<i>That married dear old Dad</i>

456
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,300
Excuse me, Mr. Dockstader.

457
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,200
- It's been almost a year now...
- And you're doing fine.

458
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
You're making real progress
and I have some ideas for you.

459
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,200
I'm going to move you into a quartet.

460
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Thanks a lot, Mr. Dockstader,
but you see, I had some ideas myself...

461
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,800

you break out with a rash now and then.

462
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,100
Ideas about what?

463
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,900
I wanted to talk to you
about the kind of song we're singing.

464
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,000
- Same one always in the same way...
- That's what they come to hear.

465
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,700
- It's tradition.
- But they might like something different.

466
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,000
My boy, minstrels have been doing fine
for 50 years.

467
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,600
We take pride in doing it
like it's always been done.

468
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,800
- I know that...
- But you've got a great point there.

469
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,500
We'll talk it over sometime.

470
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,900
<i>She was a pearl and the only girl</i>

471
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,500
<i>That Daddy ever had</i>

472
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,400
<i>A good old-fashioned girl with heart so true</i>

473
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,500
<i>One who loves nobody else but you</i>

474
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,700
Excuse me, Mr. Dockstader.

475
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,200
- I've been looking for a chance for weeks...
- I agree.

476
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
You've worked in that quartet long enough.
Time you moved up.

477
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,100
- I'm going to give you a chance in a duet.
- That'd be fine, Mr. Dockstader...

478
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,300
but the point is, if I do,
I'd like to try a different kind of song.

479
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,800
I mean something with a style
that's better for me...

480
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,400
faster tempo, more rhythm.
I'd like to look for something like that.

481
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,500
Sure. Talk to you about that again.

482
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,100
Must be some song around
you'd be happy with.

483
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,900
<i>I want a girl, just like the girl</i>

484
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,700
<i>That married dear old Dad</i>

485
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,700
<i>She was a pearl and the only girl</i>

486
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,200
<i>That Daddy ever had</i>

487
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,200
- Where you going to eat?
- I think I'll take a look at the town.

488
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,600
- I've never been in New Orleans before.
- Don't get lost. We've got a show tonight.

489
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,300
Mr. Dockstader,
Jolson hasn't showed up yet.

490
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,700
It's too late now anyway. Cut the duet.

491
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,300
I'm sorry I'm late...

492
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,800
It's intermission.
We had to skip your number.

493
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm very sorry.

494
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,300
I just forgot.

495
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,700
I know that sounds crazy,
but I heard some music tonight...

496
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,400
something they call "jazz."

497
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,900
Some fellas just make it up
as they go along. They pick it out of the air.

498
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,500
They tell me they play it
for weddings, funerals...

499
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,700
Funerals?

500
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Don't get the wrong idea.
You've never heard anything like this.

501
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,600
I sang with them. Nothing with words,
because the song doesn't have any.

502
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,300
In fact, it isn't even a song.

503
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,200
But you can make it one
and get words to fit.

504
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,900
It just needs to be worked on a little.

505
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It's exciting.
It'll make the show a hundred times better.

506
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,600
I'm happy with the show as it is.
But you aren't, are you?

507
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,000
In fact, you never will be.

508
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,300
You'll always be chasing something
up ahead...

509
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,100
and keep forgetting your act
in a little thing like a minstrel show.

510
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,100
So, maybe, we ought to call it quits.

511
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,500
Don't you think so?

512
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,800
Yeah, I think you're right.

513
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Good luck, Jolson.
I hope you find what you are looking for.

514
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
Thanks, Mr. Dockstader.

515
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,200
Papa, you're not
going to start again tonight?

516
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,600
Can't a man ask himself questions?

517
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,200
In six months, three cards.

518
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,100
I would really like to understand.

519
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,500
He leaves Dockstader
and then no cards. Why?

520
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,600
Because he did not leave Dockstader
for a better position...

521
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,100
because, for a long time, he isn't working.

522
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,600
Excuse me, are you the Yoelsons
who have a talented son in show business?

523
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Yup, it's the right Yoelsons.

524
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,300
Mama, you got younger.

525
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,200
- Why didn't you say you were coming?
- Isn't this better?

526
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,900
- This way Mama's having a good cry.
- How are you?

527
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,400
- Look at him, a man.
- Did you eat, Asa?

528
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,400
- Eat? What's that?
- Mama, he didn't eat!

529
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,200
Come on, sit down. Papa and I just finished,
but there's plenty. I got everything.

530
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,100
I got to tell Ann!
Sit down. Make him sit down, Papa.

531
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,300
Ann Murray!

532
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,900
Why is she so excited?

533
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,500
What's there to be so excited about?

534
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,300
Mama takes all the medals.
Still the best cook in the United States.

535
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,400
After what you've been eating,
by comparison I'm wonderful.

536
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,500
Look at him. Shows you what you can tell
from pictures. He is skin and bones.

537
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,400
You see...

538
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,700
That's nice, to put a cap on when you eat.

539
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,800
But, Asa...

540
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,600
did you wear one all the time
you were away?

541
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,900
- As a matter of fact, I didn't.
- For me, it's not necessary.

542
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,600
- Gefilte fish I made this morning.
- And horseradish, fresh-grated an hour ago.

543
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,900
Look out for it, Asa. It's very strong.

544
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,900
Who's that again? Not Ann Murray?

545
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,700
Of course. She grew up.
And look how pretty.

546
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,100
That's what I mean. It can't be.

547
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
She was just a funny little girl
with funny ribbons in her hair.

548
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,400
Listen to that, Mama.
And you were such a prize, I suppose?

549
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,400
- Asa was a beautiful boy.
- You see?

550
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,300
- Let him eat. The fish.
- I can taste this already.

551
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,400
- Not too much horseradish.
- I don't have to worry about...

552
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,400
Magnificent.

553
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
See? I knew he would like it.

554
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,300
Wonderful, Mama.

555
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,100
Really, the best you ever made.
Mama, you're terrific.

556
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,100
- Tell me, Papa, how's everybody been?
- Mama and I have been well.

557
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,800
By the way, do you know who came
to see us a few weeks ago? Steve Martin.

558
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,400
- How is he?
- I don't know.

559
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,800
He didn't look so well.

560
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,500
He said he was picking up time.

561
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,200
- Is that good?
- Lf you don't have a regular booking...

562
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,100
that means you're picking up
whatever work you can get.

563
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,600
- And you...
- Papa, please, he's eating.

564
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,400
- You can talk business later.
- I'm sorry.

565
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,900
It's all right, Mama.

566
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,700
It's true. I've been picking up a little time
now and then.

567
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,100
- You see...
- But wait.

568
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,800
I'd have had regular booking
if I'd wanted it. But I've had other ideas.

569
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,200
They sound a little crazy to anyone but me.

570
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,500
Like what, Asa?

571
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,700
Like spending most of my time
in hotel rooms with songwriters...

572
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,500
whenever I met up with one...

573
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,200
trying to make songs out of music
I picked up.

574
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,000
Music nobody ever heard of before,
but the only kind I want to sing.

575
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,800
Is this music so peculiar?

576
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
You sing it all the time, Papa.

577
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,300
- You want to sing prayers on the stage?
- No, just the feeling in prayers.

578
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,400
That's what's in the people I got it from...

579
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,000
and that's what's in their music,
even when it's fast and happy.

580
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,300
But they tell me it won't go, Papa.

581
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,300
It's never been done.
In fact, I'll tell you a secret.

582
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,800
They say your son's a little crazy.

583
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,800
Mama, our son is a little crazy.

584
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,300
But what can we do? He is our boy.
We have got to love him.

585
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
But about crazy people, Asa...

586
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,500
it's very funny.

587
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,600
See, once they prove they are right,
they are suddenly great people.

588
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,600
I'll go. Eat, Asa.

589
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,200
Hello. Yes?

590
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,300
New York?

591
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,100
Hello. Yes?

592
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,700
Who?

593
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,300
Al?

594
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,800
Asa? He is right here.
Yes, and who is this, please?

595
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,200
Baron?

596
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,100
A Mr. Tom Baron.

597
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,000
Hello, Tom? How are you?

598
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,300
Where'd you drop from?
How'd you know I was here?

599
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,000
I got your home address from an agency.
It's about this, Al.

600
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,500
You remember that contract
with Hammerstein?

601
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,300
I was so bad that he paid me off
if I'd stop singing.

602
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,400
That's how it happens I'm managing
the new Winter Garden Theatre.

603
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,900
I got you to thank for the whole thing.

604
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,100
Look, my friend, we open in three weeks.

605
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,900
There's a spot in the show for you,
if you want it.

606
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,200
If I want it?

607
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,400
Winter Garden?

608
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Yes, I heard you, Tom. It's just a spot...

609
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,700
but Broadway.

610
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,300
Except, tell me, Tom, what do I do?

611
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,500
- I mean, exactly what do I sing?
- I don't know.

612
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,900
Any one of the songs
that's been written for the show.

613
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,800
Why can't I pick my own, Tom?

614
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,300
Not exactly my own.
It's stuff I picked up. Terrific songs.

615
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,500
They need to be polished up
by someone good. Won't take much time.

616
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,900
They're terrific, but not written yet?

617
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,100
What's the good, if it won't help the show
and I can't do what I can?

618
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,700
I don't care if it's the biggest show,
I rather pass it up.

619
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,800
Let me bring the stuff on
and help me get it into shape.

620
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,600
You will? You're marvelous.

621
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,500
I can leave right away.
I'll be on that train in an hour.

622
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,900
- He just came home.
- Right, Tom, the minute I get there.

623
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,200
- Asa, you are leaving?
- Just right next door, New York. I'll be back.

624
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,600
Honey, what a break this is.

625
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,700
New York, Broadway,
Winter Garden, here I come.

626
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,800
How do you like that?
It's got to be his own song...

627
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,300
- and his own way of singing it.
- Hasn't changed a day.

628
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,600
Thanks a lot.
Don't tell him I had anything to do with it.

629
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,200
This could turn out to be a pack of trouble.

630
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,400
Al? Trouble? I can't imagine what you mean.

631
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,000
Show's running too long.
It's almost 11:00 p.m.

632
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,600
- Who's on next?
- Jolson.

633
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,900
- Cut him and jump to the finish.
- Wait a minute.

634
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,800
Tell the orchestra leader about it.

635
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,800
Look, I want to go on.
Where's Baron? Ask Tom.

636
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,200
Baron isn't running this end of it. I am.

637
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,300
- Hold it. You're not on.
- That's what you think.

638
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,000
We're cutting the Jolson number.

639
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,300
I'm next, folks.

640
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,400
- You lucky people.
- But he's here, in front of me.

641
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,600
Oscar, what are you doing with that phone?
This is no time to call up women.

642
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,700
- I can't get up there and pull him off.
- Close the curtains on him.

643
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,800
Oscar, if you insist on phoning,
get one for me.

644
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,900
Hello, Oscar, remember me? Jolson.

645
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,900
Now, boys, take it easy.

646
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,500
Next they'll turn out the lights on me,
but I wouldn't mind that.

647
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,200
Professor, my song, if you please.

648
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,900
Settle back, folks.
You ain't heard nothing yet.

649
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,000
<i>Everything seems lovely</i>

650
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,300
<i>when you start to roam</i>

651
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,000
<i>The birds are singing the day that you stray</i>

652
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,000
<i>But wait until you are further away</i>

653
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,700
<i>Things won't be so lovely</i>

654
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,700
<i>When you're all alone</i>

655
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,400
<i>Here's what you'll keep saying</i>

656
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,500
<i>when you're far from home</i>

657
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,200
<i>Mammy</i>

658
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,800
<i>Mammy</i>

659
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,700
<i>The sun shines east, the sun shines west</i>

660
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,300
<i>I know where the sun shines best</i>

661
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,300

00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,400

00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,700
<i>I'm a-comin'</i>

666
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,800
<i>Sorry that I made you wait</i>

667
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,100
<i>I'm a-comin'</i>

668
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,700
<i>Hope and trust that I'm not late</i>

669
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,300

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,800
<i>My little mammy</i>

671

<i>I'd walk a million miles</i>

672
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,200
<i>For one of your smiles</i>

673
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,400
<i>My mammy</i>

674
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,300
<i>Mammy</i>

679
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,300
<i>Nobody else's, my little mammy</i>

680
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,600
<i>My heartstrings are tangled around</i>

681
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,100
<i>Alabamy</i>

682
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
<i>Mammy</i>

683
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,200
<i>Mammy, I'm comin'</i>

684
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,100
<i>I hope I didn't make you wait</i>

685
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,800
<i>Mammy, I'm coming</i>

686
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,400
<i>I hope I'm not late</i>

687
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,200
<i>Mammy, look at me</i>

688
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,400
<i>Don't you know me? I'm your little baby</i>

689
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,100
<i>I'd walk a million miles</i>
<i>for one of your smiles</i>

690
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,200
<i>My mammy</i>

691
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,700
Asa smashed something?

692
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,200
That actor you wanted to interview
for the new show...

693
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,400
- want to see him now?
- Send him in.

694
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,700
Hello, Steve. Haven't seen you
in a long time. How have you been?

695
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,700
Fine. Glad to see you, Al.

696
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,800
Sit down. Just cleaning up.

697
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,200
Look, about this part, Al.

698
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,200
It's nice of you to think of me,
but it might not be right.

699
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,500
- I'm considering a few other things...
- Sure, I realize that.

700
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,200
But it's like this. I've clicked on Broadway
and things are piling up on me.

701
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,700
Music contracts, record-making,
sheet music.

702
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,700
Now we're putting together a new show
starring Al.

703
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,700
It's a great show.
You should hear the songs.

704
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,800
- We go into rehearsal next week.
- But what's this got to do with the part?

705
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,600
I'm telling you the part.
I need a man who knows show business.

706
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,300
I need a man to move in
and help me run my career.

707
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,500
I need a manager. What do you say?

708
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,200
It's a nice part, Mr. Jolson,
but not in my line.

709
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,600
You old dog, you got to do it.
I need you, been looking all over for you.

710
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,800
Quit kidding. You got Tom.

711
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,700
I have to run the shows.
Somebody's got to run Al.

712
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,600
- Come on, say you'll ride along with me.
- At my age, ride on a comet?

713
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,300
Tom, meet my new manager,
Mr. Steve Martin.

714
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,200
Great pleasure, Mr. Martin.

715
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,900
Great pleasure, Mr. Martin.

716
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,900
<i>And I'm sittin' on top of the world</i>

717
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,000
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

718
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,700
<i>Just rollin' along</i>

719
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,600
<i>Don't want any millions</i>

720
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,200
<i>I'm getting my share</i>

721
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,900
<i>I've only got one suit</i>
<i>just one, that's all I can wear</i>

722
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,000
<i>A bundle of money don't make me feel gay</i>

723
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,000
<i>A sweet little honey</i>

724
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,100
<i>is making me say</i>

725
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,300
<i>I'm sittin', sittin' on top</i>
<i>Top of the world</i>

726
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,600
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

727
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,200
<i>Just rollin' along</i>

728
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,400
<i>And I'm quittin' the blues of the world</i>

729
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,100
<i>I'm singin' a song, just singin' a song</i>

730
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,900
<i>Glory Hallelujah, I just phoned the parson</i>

731
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,400
<i>Hey, Par, get ready to call</i>

732
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,800
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

733
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,400
<i>I'm going to fall</i>

734
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,000
<i>And I'm sittin', sittin' on top</i>
<i>Top of the world</i>

735
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,000
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

736
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,500
<i>Rollin' along</i>

737
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,100
11:40 p.m. Why doesn't he phone?

738
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,400
- The show isn't over yet, that's all.
- So what are you worried about?

739
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,900
Mama, when will you learn
about show business?

740
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,800
Running time is everything.

741
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,900
You can have a smash show,
but if it's too long, it can take a nosedive.

742
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,500
It happens all the time.

743
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,200
What's the matter, Miss Sally?
Just tell your old Uncle Gus everything.

744
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,900
It can't be as bad as all that.

745
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Henry will never believe I love him
and not Lester.

746
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,900
Why don't you just explain it to Henry?

747
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,700
He won't even listen to me.

748
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,400
- He won't?
- No.

749
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,000
Honey, Henry better listen pretty soon
or this show's going to run till 1:00.

750
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,600
A lot of these folks live in Brooklyn.
They got to catch a train.

751
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,500
He really loves her and she really loves him,
and it comes out all right anyway.

752
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,800
Henry, please come here and tell her
you love her so we can get to the finale?

753
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,900
Come on, Henry. Come on out.

754
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,400
You remember Henry.

755
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,400
Go ahead, kids, do your stuff.

756
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,800
That's enough. Besides, you're getting paid.

757
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,900
Now that we got that set,
take this curtain up.

758
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,600
Has he lost his mind?

759
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,100
Go ahead, take it up.

760
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,500
Hello, kids, how are you?

761
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,200
Wait a minute. Hold it. Don't go.
Don't mind the customers. Do like I tell you.

762
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,200
Everybody, come back and sit down.

763
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,400
Anyway, kids, you're tired...

764
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,700
and this may go on for a long time.

765
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,600
Because I got another dozen songs in me
and I'm raring to go.

766
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,500
Wait a minute.

767
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,000
I've made up my mind.

768
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,600
If I'm going to sing to you,
I want to see you.

769
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,100
Steve, tell the electricians
to turn up the lights.

770
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,100
Go ahead.

771
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,300
All the houselights. Every one of them.

772
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,900
Houselights? Why?

773
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,500
How else you going to see faces?

774
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,400
That's more like it.

775
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:00,900
I've been waiting for this a long time.

776
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,900
I've been waiting for this a long time.

777
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,800
Professor, <i>You Made Me Love You.</i>

778
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,500
And if that ain't a song cue,
I never heard one.

779
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,900
<i>You made me love you</i>

780
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,900
<i>I didn't wanna do it</i>

781
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,000
<i>I didn't wanna do it</i>

782
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,500
<i>You made me want to</i>

783
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,600
<i>And all the time you knew it</i>
<i>I guess you always knew it</i>

784
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,900
<i>You made me happy sometimes</i>

785
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,100
<i>You made me glad</i>

786
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,300
<i>But there were times, baby</i>

787
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,000
<i>You dog</i>

788
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,500
<i>You made me cry for</i>

789
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,800
<i>I didn't wanna tell you</i>

790
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,100
<i>I didn't wanna tell you</i>

791
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,400
<i>I want some love that's true</i>

792
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,700
<i>You know I do, indeed I do, yes, I do</i>

793
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,400
<i>Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme</i>

794
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,100
<i>what I cry for</i>

795
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,000
<i>You know you got the kind of kisses</i>
<i>that I'd die for</i>

796
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,100
<i>You know you made me love you</i>

797
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,500
Beginning of the second year
and still socko, Mama.

798
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,600
I want to get past those footlights
and a lot closer to the audience.

799
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,400
I want a runway from the stage
running right down the center of the house.

800
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,900
Then I can sing right at them.

801
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,000
Put a thing like that up,
you lose 100 seats every performance.

802
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,500
And your show has twice as long a run,
a clear profit.

803
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,800
Look, right down here...

804
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,400
<i>Swanee, how I love you, how I love you</i>

805
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,000
<i>My dear old Swanee</i>

806
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,800
<i>The folks up north will see me no more</i>

807
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,800
<i>when I get to that Swanee shore</i>

808
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,400
<i>I love the old folks at home</i>

809
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,000
<i>Swanee, how I love you, how I love you</i>

810
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,600
<i>My dear old Swanee</i>

811
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,400
<i>The folks up north will see me no more</i>

812
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,100
<i>When I get to that Swanee shore</i>

813
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,000
"Robinson Crusoe, after two years,
still sockeroo."

814
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,600
What is "sockeroo," Papa?

815
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,500
Sockeroo, Mama? That's double socko.

816
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,300
Take a big Broadway show like this on tour?
Drag it all over the country into tank towns?

817
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,800
Al's out of his mind. It's never been done.

818
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,500
Neither was lighting up the audience,
or runways.

819
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,000
But why this, Steve?

820
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,900
Because it's a brand-new audience,
he says, millions of them.

821
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,200
People who never saw a Broadway show
and never heard him sing.

822
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,500
But you go ahead, Tom, talk him out of it.

823
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,500
I will.

824
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,200
Here's a laugh.

825
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:56,700
Some boys at the club were saying,
"Give Sunday night concerts...

826
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,400
"so actors and people in show business
can get a chance to see you perform."

827
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,700
How do you like that?

828
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,000
That's the most exciting audience
in the world.

829
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,700
That's a great idea.

830
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,100
Make a note of it, Steve.
Tell Tom to arrange it.

831
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,600
Wait. The minute we get back to New York...

832
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,400
you want to start to work on the new show,
without even a day's rest.

833
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,300
So what?

834
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,300
Soon, you're doing eight performances
a week again...

835
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,700
like you've done steady for five years.

836
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,600
And now you want to add
an extra show on Sunday.

837
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,400
That's a shortcut to the morgue.

838
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,800
Sweetheart, what you like doing
keeps you healthy.

839
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,300
I know you'd rather sing
to a live face than eat...

840
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,900
but I call this winding up
with nothing for yourself.

841
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,400
I'm talking about some life
outside of a theater.

842
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,700
Like what?

843
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,800
Like slowing down a little
and having some other kind of fun...

844
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,900
like a family, like some girl.

845
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,700
Don't worry, pal, there's always been a girl.

846
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
- Look, when do we play Washington?
- Two weeks.

847
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,300
The night we open there,
let's make it a real celebration.

848
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,600
Get a box for Mama and Papa,
Ann Murray and her folks...

849
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,200
and tell Papa to bring the president.

850
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,100
- Of the United States?
- No, the synagogue.

851
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,800
<i>Hamburgers</i>

852
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,100
<i>Hamburgers</i>

853
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,800
<i>Hamburgers</i>

854
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,700
<i>List'n to me while I tell you</i>

855
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,200
<i>of the Spaniard who blighted me life</i>

856
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,700
<i>List'n to me while I tell you</i>

857
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,200
<i>of the man who stole my future wife</i>

858
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,900
<i>- 'Twas down at the bullfight we met him</i>
<i>- Yes! Yes!</i>

859
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,000
<i>- And during his daring display</i>
<i>- What then?</i>

860
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,100
<i>And while I went out</i>
<i>for some peanuts and a program</i>

861
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,100
<i>that dirty dog stole her away</i>

862
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,500
<i>- The pig!</i>
<i>- Oh, yes!</i>

863
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,500
<i>Oh, no!</i>

864
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,800
<i>- Oh, yes!</i>
<i>- Oh, no!</i>

865
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,800
<i>So tonight</i>

866
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,900
<i>I will have my revenge</i>

867
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,900
<i>Tonight he will have his revenge</i>

868
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,900
<i>If I catch Alphonso Spugoni</i>

869
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,600
<i>- the toreador</i>
<i>- He'll rue the day</i>

870
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,200
<i>With one mighty swipe</i>
<i>I will dislocate his bally jaw</i>

871
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,400
<i>He will, he will</i>

872
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,100
<i>I'll get him, the blighter, I will</i>

873
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,800
<i>and when I get him, that blighter I'll kill,</i>
<i>he shall die!</i>

874
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,300
<i>- He shall die</i>
<i>- He shall die</i>

875
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,700
<i>- He shall die</i>
<i>- He shall die</i>

876
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,300
<i>- He shall die</i>
<i>- I'll kill him</i>

877
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,100
<i>- He shall die</i>
<i>- I'll kill him dead</i>

878
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,800
<i>I'll raise a bunion on his Spanish onion</i>

879
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,300
<i>If I catch him bending tonight</i>

880
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,700
<i>- He shall die</i>
<i>- He shall die</i>

881
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,300
<i>- He shall die</i>
<i>- He shall die</i>

882
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,000
<i>He shall die</i>
<i>He shall jolly well die</i>

883
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,700
<i>- He shall die</i>
<i>- He shall die</i>

884
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,600
<i>He shall die</i>

885
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,300
<i>Oh, it's too high</i>

886
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,400
<i>One of us should have stayed home</i>

887
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,300
<i>For I'll raise a bunion on his Spanish onion</i>

888
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:32,200
<i>If I catch him bending tonight</i>

889
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,400
A Spaniard all of sudden.

890
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,500
- Mr. And Mrs. Murray, glad you're here.
- You were great. I enjoyed it.

891
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,200
Mr. Samuels, how are you?

892
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,600
How'd you like it?

893
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:52,100
When I sing in the synagogue,
I never get applause like that.

894
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,600
Papa, if you want to get ahead singing,
you got to have Steve manage your affairs.

895
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,900
Asa, you look thin. You need a rest.

896
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,300
Rest? There's a new show coming up...

897
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,300
and now a performance every Sunday night.

898
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:09,200
- Sunday nights, too?
- By popular request. Don't worry about it.

899
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,600
- AI, it was marvelous.
- I'm glad to see you, Ann.

900
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,200
I know him.

901
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,600
That's Roy Anderson, Al.
He was in school with us.

902
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,500
- Sure, hello, Roy.
- How are you?

903
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,000
We're going to be married next month, Al.

904
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,700
You and Roy?

905
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,800
What do you know!

906
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,800
We've been experimenting with talking
pictures for years. We know it'll work.

907
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,700
But we want a star
in our first sound picture.

908
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,800
But why Al?

909
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:56,700
It's logical. He's the biggest singing star
and he's led the way ever since he began.

910
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,200
So Al should risk his career
on a newfangled invention like this.

911
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,600
- What if this thing is a flop?
- With Jolson, we don't think it will be.

912
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:08,400
Before Al goes into anything like this,
he's gonna knock off for a year and rest.

913
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,600
How many people do you figure
see a good movie?

914
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,800
Fifty million in this country alone.

915
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,900
The rest of the world besides.
Never was an audience like that in history.

916
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,600
- That may be true, Al, but...
- It's an audience that never saw a live show.

917
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,100
People in small towns can afford a movie
but can't afford anything else.

918
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,900
Audience of millions. Be singing
to every one of them at the same time.

919
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,600
- That's really something.
- Ready for the finale, Mr. Jolson.

920
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,400
Stick around, Mr. Glenn.
We'll talk about it later.

921
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,600
Pictures that talk?

922
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,200
- Is that possible, Papa?
- Certainly. It's a new invention.

923
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,000
But tell me, exactly, how does this work?

924
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,700
It's very complicated, Mama.
You wouldn't understand it.

925
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:10,800
Al, <i>The Jazz Singer</i> is all set. All that's
left to do is to make the announcement.

926
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,200
Al, there's your music.

927
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,700
Announcement? There's only one place
to make the announcement.

928
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,000
Hi, folks.

929
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,200
Hello, Jerry.

930
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,900
Show people are crazy.

931
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,400
Work in the theater all week.
Sundays, you come here.

932
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,900
I'm crazy, too.

933
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,900
Tonight, folks, I'm only gonna sing
2,000 songs. One to a customer.

934
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,600
I should live so long.

935
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,800
Hold this, will you, Henry?

936
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:39,000
Sorry I'm late, but we were discussing
a business deal in the back of the house.

937
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,200
As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna tell you about it right now.

938
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,200
See, tomorrow I leave for Hollywood.

939
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,500
I'm going into
what they call "talking pictures."

940
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,300
Don't know what'll happen to me.

941
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:51,900
But if I wanna come back,
you'll let me, won't you?

942
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:58,000
Thanks, I'll remember that.
So this is a kind of a farewell.

943
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,600
If you don't mind,
I'll sing till you ask me to stop.

944
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,900
You ain't heard nothing yet.

945
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,300
Well, I see a rival producer
sitting down front.

946
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,300
Mr. Ziegfeld.
Ziggy, will you stand up and take a bow?

947
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,700
Try and stop him.

948
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,800
Not too much, folks.

949
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,400
Say, Ziggy, who's that pretty gal with you?

950
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,800
This is Julie Benson,
the star of my next production, <i>Show Girl.</i>

951
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,900
Mr. Ziegfeld, you will please
not advertise on my time.

952
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,100
Glad to know you, Miss Benson.

953
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,600
Look, I'm giving a little farewell party up
at my place tonight, Miss Benson.

954
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,800
I don't live very far from here.
You can bring Mr. Ziegfeld along.

955
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,900
- What'll it be?
- <i>Swanee.</i>

956
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,400
Wait a second. Hold it.
I don't care what you mugs want.

957
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,200
I want to know
what Miss Benson would like to hear.

958
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,700
Miss Benson, what is your pleasure?

959
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,400
<i>April Showers.</i>

960
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,700
Let's not keep the lady waiting, Henry.

961
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,700
<i>Though April showers</i>

962
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,100
<i>may come your way</i>

963
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,800
Just for you.

964
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:30,300
<i>They bring the flowers that bloom in May</i>

965
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,500
<i>So if it's raining</i>

966
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,000
<i>have no regrets</i>

967
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:42,100
<i>because it isn't raining rain, you know</i>

968
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,600
<i>It's raining violets</i>

969
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,700
<i>And where you see clouds</i>

970
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,300
<i>upon the hills</i>

971
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,800
<i>you soon will see crowds</i>

972
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:58,200
<i>of daffodils</i>

973
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,900
<i>So keep on looking for a bluebird</i>

974
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,400
<i>And listening for its song</i>

975
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,600
<i>Whenever April showers</i>

976
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,800
<i>come along</i>

977
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,900
<i>Though April showers</i>

978
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,900
<i>may come your way</i>

979
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,300
<i>They bring the flowers</i>

980
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,800
<i>that bloom in May</i>

981
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,900
<i>So if it's raining</i>

982
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,500
<i>have no regrets</i>

01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,200
<i>because it isn't raining rain, you know</i>

984
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,900
<i>It's raining violets</i>

985
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,400
<i>And where you see clouds</i>
<i>Where you see clouds on the hills</i>

986
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,700
<i>Look, look, they're not clouds, no, no</i>

987
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,900
<i>They're crowds of daffodils</i>

988
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:02,500
<i>So keep on looking for a bluebird</i>

989
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,600
<i>and listening</i>

<i>come along</i>

993
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,700
Folks, I'm calling the next one.

994
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,800
I want to sing about
that big, beautiful state I'm going to.

995
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,600
And I don't mean Florida.

996
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:48,400
Hit it, Professor!

997
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,800
Hit it, Professor!

998
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,200
<i>California, here I come</i>

999
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,900
<i>Right back where I started from</i>

1000
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,500
<i>Where bowers of flowers</i>
<i>bloom in the spring</i>

1001
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,100
<i>Each morning at dawning</i>
<i>birdies sing and everything</i>

1002
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,200
<i>A sun-kissed miss said, "Don't be late"</i>

1003
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,800
<i>That's why I can hardly wait</i>

1004
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,900
<i>Open up that Golden Gate</i>

1005
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,500
<i>California, here I come</i>

1006
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,600
<i>California, here I come, yeah!</i>

1007
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,400
<i>Right back where I started from</i>

1008
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,600
<i>Where bowers of flowers</i>
<i>bloom in the spring</i>

1009

01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:51,400
<i>That's why I can hardly wait</i>

1012
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,400
<i>Come on, open up, open up, open up</i>
<i>that Golden Gate</i>

1013
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,300
<i>California</i>

1014
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:03,200
<i>Here I come</i>

1015

<i>California, here I come, yeah!</i>

1016
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,300
<i>Right back where I started from</i>

<i>Where bowers of flowers</i>

1021
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:38,400
<i>Come on, open up, open up, open up</i>
<i>that Golden Gate</i>

1022
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,700
<i>California</i>

01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:44,800
<i>here I come</i>

1024
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,200
I'm afraid I'll have to talk to you, my friend.

1025
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:03,600
- Please, Mr. Jolson, I'll never do it again.
- You sure?

1026
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:08,100
A million imitators of Al Jolson,
but none of them touch the original.

1027
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,900
That's a cute speech.
You know, I'd sort of like to touch you.

1028
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,800
I don't know. It's funny.
I can't seem to make it.

1029
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,000
That's good.

1030
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:19,000
You know, you get prettier
every time I see you.

1031
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,800
- The first time was just a few hours ago.
- Yeah?

1032
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,800
- Then you got prettier since then.
- Thank you.

1033
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,200
- Look, will you do me a big favor?
- What?

1034
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,800
Will you marry me, Miss Benson?

1035
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,100
I'll do you a bigger favor, Mr. Jolson.
I won't marry you.

1036
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,300
I didn't suppose you would,
but you could think about it.

1037
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,300
You'd have to decide tonight.
I'm going to California tomorrow.

1038
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,400
- This last evening belongs to your friends.
- Wait. You mean in there?

1039
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,500
Tell you a secret,
don't even know most of them.

1040
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,200
How'd they get there?

1041
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:55,000
It always seems to happen.
You see, I ask a few people up.

1042
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,100
Then they ask some people
I never heard of...

1043
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,400
and those strangers ask some
other strangers and before you know it...

1044
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,900
- You're singing for them.
- Yeah, just for three or four hours.

1045
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,800
You work till midnight and then you come
home and work three or four hours more?

1046
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,100
I don't mind.

1047
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,200
- You mean you love it.
- Yeah, I guess I do.

1048
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,100
It's more than just singing.
I don't know how to tell you...

1049
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,300
- You really don't have to, Mr. Jolson.
- Yes, I do.

1050
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,200
I gotta tell you everything.

1051
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,300
- AI, it's getting late and the gang wants...
- Go away, Steve, I'm busy.

1052
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,000
Caught a cold. Can't sing a note. Go away.

1053
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,600
You really ought to go in, Mr. Jolson.

1054
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:34,100
No, I've got to tell you how I feel.

1055
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,600
And it's gonna take me hours.

1056
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,000
I shouldn't be rushing you like this.
You'll think I'm kidding.

1057
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,300
But look, you see, I've been waiting
for something for a long time.

1058
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,900
I didn't know what it was.
Steve was trying to tell me, it was about...

1059
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,500
All about getting everything
and nothing out of life.

1060
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,800
I didn't know what he was talking about,
and then I saw you.

1061
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,400
Yes, sir, then I saw you.

1062
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,000
Look, got a great idea.

1063
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,100
Suppose you and I got married and went
to California together? How about it?

1064
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,800
Of course, I'm rehearsing <i>Show Girl,</i>
and we open in two weeks.

1065
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,400
Yeah, that's too bad.

1066
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:11,300
If it just wasn't for that?

1067
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,300
And a few other things.

1068
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,600
Go ahead, tell me.
That's what I want to know. Like what?

1069
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,200
That street down there.

1070
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:25,600
Broadway? What a street.

1071
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,000
You know something, baby?
It belongs to me.

1072
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,600
You know something else?
If you want it, I'll give it to you.

1073
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,300
That's the point. It's yours all right.

1074
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,100
It's your whole life, too.
But I don't think it'll ever be mine.

1075
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:43,200
Why, it's gonna say "Julie Benson"
down there in great big lights.

1076
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
- Do you mean to say you don't want that?
- Yes, I want that.

1077
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,900
- I'm just normal enough to want that.
- Sure. You're just a little scared now.

1078
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,400
When you get some confidence
you'll begin to love it...

1079
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,600
begin to feel it in your blood.

1080
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:58,000
- That's the big difference.
- What's the big difference?

1081
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,500
It was in your blood when you were born.

1082
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,900
But I'm just a pretty good hoofer,
and I got a lucky break.

1083
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:07,300
All I know is, I want a lot besides this.

1084
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,500
Like what, Julie? Gotta know.

1085
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,900
Well, in the first place, like a real home.

1086
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,500
Sure, everybody wants a home.

1087
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,800
- You won't care for the kind I'm thinking of.
- Why not? Why wouldn't I?

1088
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,500
It would have to be far enough away.

1089
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,700
Maybe way out in the country,
so that by the time you got there...

1090
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,800
and closed the door, you'd have forgotten
all about show business.

1091
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,400
It's funny, all of a sudden that's what
I've always wanted, to close a door.

1092
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,400
I'll tell you something. I know the spot.

1093
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,700
It's in Westchester.
Acres of pretty land, trees all around.

1094
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,400
Go away, Steve.
Feeling worse all the time. Go away.

1095
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,300
- Tell Ziggy I'll see Miss Benson home.
- It's getting pretty late, Mr. Jolson.

1096
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,300
Late? But, baby, I'm going away tomorrow.
We're just getting places.

1097
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,300
Come here, sit down.
Look, can you cut out that "Mr. Jolson"?

1098
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:00,200
Why don't you just call me
by my southern name: Honey.

1099
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,000
I know what's the trouble.

1100
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,100
You don't believe me.
You don't believe I want anything different.

1101
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:18,700
I'm trying to tell you, I was barging
through this big, beautiful world like a fool.

1102
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,400
I do believe you, honey.

1103
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,800
I always thought I'd like to fall in love
with the man I'll marry.

1104
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,700
You're absolutely right,
and I'm not gonna rush you, baby.

1105
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:31,100
In fact, we won't get married till I get back
from California. How's that?

1106
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,500
Hello, darling. How are you?
How'd the dress rehearsal go?

1107
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,700
Fine, Al. Yes, honest.

1108
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,300
But opening tomorrow night
will be something else again.

1109
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,800
I'm scared to death.

1110
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,700
You got nothing to be scared about, honey.
You're gonna be wonderful.

1111
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:21,500
Yeah, I'm still at the studio, working hard.
We shoot pretty soon.

1112
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,700
It's gonna be all right, I think, when
I find out which end of the camera's which.

1113
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,800
Get a good night's sleep and don't worry,
you hear? You're gonna knock them dead.

1114
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,000
Yeah, I'll call you again tomorrow night.
Goodbye, angel.

1115
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,900
- She all right?
- She says she's scared. She sounds it.

1116
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:42,100
Steve, if I got a plane,
a special plane to fly right through...

1117
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,600
I can be in New York
for that opening tomorrow night.

1118
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,200
- What can you do in New York?
- I don't know.

1119
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,600
I want to be there. Get on that phone.
Get the plane.

1120
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,500
- You can't walk out on the studio.
- Be back soon and work twice as hard.

1121
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:58,100
Phone Ziegfeld, tell him to hold me a seat
and not to tell Julie I'm coming.

1122
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:15,300

1147
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,100
Hello? Who?

1148
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,300
Al, how are you? Tell me, how'd it go?

1149
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,700
What? I can't hear you.

1150
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,800
Connecticut?
What are you doing in Connecticut?

1151
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,600
You what?

1152
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,000
- Meet Mrs. Jolson.
- Oh, my.

1153
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,100
- Asa!
- I'm so happy, dear.

1154
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:00,000
Mama, please. Please, give me a chance.

1155
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,800
I don't understand. Married a few hours,
he runs to California...

1156
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,300
It'll take me a couple of months to make
this picture, then I'll be home.

1157
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,600
And that's where he's gonna stay.

1158
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,600
Asa staying home. That will be a miracle.

1159
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,700
Julie, there's only one thing
the matter with Asa.

1160
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,500
He's got to sing. It's a wonderful thing.
Success is beautiful.

1161
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,400
But Mama and I have worried...

1162
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:26,200
because a home with love in it
is even better.

1163
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:30,500
The way you say that is a little corny, Papa,
but you're right. Julie agrees with you.

1164
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,700
What do you think we'll do?
We'll build a real home and settle down...

1165
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:37,000
out in the country where it's nice
and quiet, with crickets and frogs.

1166
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,700
I'll teach the frogs to sing <i>Mammy,</i>
so Al won't be lonely.

1167
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,900
Thank you, honey.

1168
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:43,000
- Asa, are you serious?
- Sure.

1169
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,200
In fact, Julie doesn't know this yet.
I've got an architect at work.

1170
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,400
I told him, "Build a house for Julie.
The sky's the limit."

1171
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,400
- That I approve of.
- So do I.

1172
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,900
Here. Here have some gefilte fish
with the horseradish, Julie.

1173
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,000
Look out for the horseradish.
That stuff will curl your hair.

1174
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,700
I think we'll have a barn, Mama,
and some cows.

1175
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,800
- I'm gonna milk them myself.
- You?

1176
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:07,100
- You, milk cows, Asa?
- You have to get up at 5:00 a.m.

1177
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,200
We'll keep the cows up at night
so they'll sleep later in the morning.

1178
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,200
Julie, you got too much.

1179

1185
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,900
Let Jolson sing it, mister.
He's doing all right.

1186
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,200
Think so?

1187

Hello, everybody.
We didn't realize how late it was.

- Did you see the papers?
- We saw them at Glenn's office.

- They're really something.
- "Something," he says.

I'm sorry, baby,

but we got to talking over...

I know, they want you to go right back
to the Coast to make another picture.

1204
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,200
- How did you know?
- That was tough to figure out.

1205
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,900
They said the first talking picture
will be a great hit.

1206
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,200
- It ought to be followed with another one.
- You ought to go.

1207
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:04,200
The point is I'd have to go alone. You can't
leave your show in the middle of a run.

1208
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,600
We'll just have to wait a little while longer.

1209
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,900
What happens
to the new Winter Garden show?

1210
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:12,100
- That waits like Julie does.
- We'll talk about that later.

1211
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,300
Wait a minute, Julie will be here,
Asa in California...

1212
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,700
so where will you build your house?
In Kansas City?

1213
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,300
Don't worry, Mama, we'll build it.
You're terrific to take it this way.

1214
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:27,900
Another bad break, but it won't be for long.
Then you'll get everything you want, angel.

1215
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,600
In fact, while I'm gone
you go ahead with the house.

1216
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,300
Get it ready. Start building it. Start teaching
those frogs how to sing <i>Mammy.</i>

1217
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,600
Yes, we're closing Saturday. It's definite.

1218
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,800
I want you to fly here when you're through.

1219
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,700
You were coming east when you're through.

1220
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:52,000
A little change in plans, baby.
A big surprise.

1221
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,500
But, Al...

1222
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,900
Be on that plane no later than Sunday.
I'm dying to see you.

1223
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,100
California, here I come.

1224
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,600
Here we are, baby, home.

1225
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,300
This is really something.

1226
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,000
- How are you, Henry?
- Meet Mrs. Jolson.

1227
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,100
Great to have her here, isn't it?
Here, baby, let me take this.

1228
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,100
You want something? You want to clean up,
want something to eat?

1229
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,900
- Henry will rustle up some grub.
- I don't want a thing.

1230
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,500
Come on, let's go inside then.
Come on, fellas.

1231
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:25,400
It's been a long time, honey.
Here, wait a minute, let me look at you.

1232
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,900
- Never gonna let you out of my sight again.
- Good for you.

1233
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,200
Sit down, Dick. This may take a little time.

1234
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,600
- It's a little large, isn't it?
- It ain't exactly small.

1235
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:41,400
You see, they used to play football here
before they built the Coliseum.

1236
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,100
You wouldn't care for a place like this,
but don't let it get you down.

1237
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,700
Darling, since we don't have to stay here
very long, I just love it.

1238
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,700
Yeah, that's right.

1239
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,600
Yet, on the other hand, baby, you know...

1240
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,900
Come here. Sit down.
Got something to tell you.

1241
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,200
On the other hand, what?

1242
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,000
On the other hand,
he's talking through his hat.

1243
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,500
We had a little dinner planned.

1244
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:06,800
Forget what we arranged.
I can't wait, gotta tell her now.

1245
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,200
What goes on here?

1246
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:12,000
Honey, talking pictures are here for good.
They're getting better all the time.

1247
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,800
In a few years, they'll have audiences
nobody ever dreamed of.

1248
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,600
Studio's got terrific plans.

1249
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,000
All I know is a man would have to be insane
to walk away from this now.

1250
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,600
- AI, you went and did it.
- What?

1251
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:25,500
You bought a house here. Or you're
building one with sunken gardens.

1252
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,300
- That was the surprise you talked about.
- No, honest.

1253
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,400
- You ain't heard nothing yet, Julie.
- You said it.

1254
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,400
- Now, baby, now, listen...
- AI, are you gonna sing <i>Mammy?</i>

1255
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,600
Quit clowning. Look,
you don't think I'd ask you to give up...

1256
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,100
the stage and dancing and just have you
come out here and settle down?

1257
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,200
I'd consider it.

1258
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:46,600
I wouldn't let you do that. You're too terrific.
In fact, do you know what pictures need?

1259
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:49,800
Talent, and something beautiful
at the same time, like you.

1260
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,800
- Wait a minute.
- Listen, show business is here now, baby.

1261
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:56,900
You belong in it, you and me both.
If we're together, who cares where we live?

1262
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,500
The world's gotta hear about you.
Your name on billboards in 97 languages.

1263
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,200
Greatest star pictures ever had.
You can't miss. The document?

1264
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,100
- You didn't forget to bring it?
- Here.

1265
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:08,000
Your studio's about to own
the biggest hunk of talent.

1266
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,300
Papa's been working on this contract.
It's all ready to sign.

1267
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,800
Wait a minute. Julie hasn't said anything.

1268
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,100
- I can't think of anything.
- There you are.

1269
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:22,400
Maybe she doesn't want her name
in more than 17 languages. Or maybe none.

1270
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:26,000
Don't listen to him. For weeks he's
squawking about me rushing you into this.

1271
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,300
This guy is out of his mind about pictures.

1272
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:30,900
The latest type of Jolson rocket
is taking off.

1273
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:34,800
I've been riding those dizzy things for years.
It's all right with me.

1274
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,600
But maybe you had something
a little slower in mind.

1275
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,600
Baby, what's he talking about?

1276
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:43,100
Haven't the faintest idea.

1277
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,400
My dear Mr. Martin, pictures need talent...

1278
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:50,200
and what girl would take 17 languages
when she can have 97?

1279
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,300
Shall I sign this now, Mr. Jolson?

1280
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:57,100
Thanks, Steve, you talked her into it.
Here you are, baby.

1281
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,200
Got a pen, Dick? We'll do this right now.

1282
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,300
Call the studio. Mrs. Jolson's ready
for her first starring vehicle.

1283
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:02,800
Call the studio. Mrs. Jolson's ready
for her first starring vehicle.

1284
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,700
<i>She's a Latin from Manhattan</i>

1285
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,300
<i>You can tell by her manana</i>

1286
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,300
<i>She's a Latin from Manhattan</i>

1287
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,100
<i>And not Havana</i>

1288
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,100
<i>Though she does the rumba for us</i>

1289
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,700
<i>And she calls herself Dolores</i>

1290
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,400
<i>She was in a Broadway chorus</i>

1291
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,300
<i>known as Suzie Donahue</i>

1292
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,300
<i>I can take a tambourine and whack it</i>

1293
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,900
<i>But with me it's just a racket</i>

1294
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,100
<i>She's a hoofer from Tenth Avenue</i>

1295
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,400
<i>I'm a Latin from Manhattan</i>

1296
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,100
<i>I'm a Forty-Second Streeter</i>

1297
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,800
<i>She's a Latin from Manhattan</i>

1298
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,300
<i>Senorita Donahue</i>

1299
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,500
- Here's to the real star of this family.
- I'll have a drink to that.

1300
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,600
I thought I was pretty good.

1301
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:26,100
- Now to Julie's next picture.
- Wait, let's not even think about it.

1302
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,600
Not another one. Not right away.
I couldn't go through all that work again.

1303
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,700
You can't stop now. You're up there.

1304
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,300
Do another one
and prove the first one wasn't a fluke.

1305
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,300
You won't mind the next one,
you're used to it.

1306
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:39,100
And after the first dozen,
you won't mind anything.

1307
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,100
Dozen?

1308
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,900
My mother said, "Always be kind to
tired ladies, especially when they're pretty."

1309
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,700
- Is the mob getting you down, babe?
- No, I like people, Steve.

1310
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,300
I just wish sometimes
there weren't so many of them.

1311
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,500
Funny how they never get tired
listening to him. Night after night.

1312
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,000
Not so funny. He's a pretty remarkable fella.

1313
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,300
That he is.

1314
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:23,400
Soon, you and Al will wash up the pictures,
and you'll knock off for a long rest.

1315
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:24,900
That'll take a miracle, Steve.

1316
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
When I'm finished, he's in the middle of one
and vice versa.

1317
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,500
We'll never come out together.

1318
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,600
Then somebody's got to quit for once
and wait for the other.

1319
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,200
No waits, no delays
in the life of the Jolsons.

1320
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,400
Just a matter of
putting your foot down once.

1321
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:41,100
He'll know the right time, Steve.
He's happy, so am I.

1322
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,600
And it's not nice to put your foot down.
Good night, my friend.

1323
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,700
Remember those plans you had
for that house in the East?

1324
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:50,300
I just happened to think of that
the other day.

1325
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:54,200
Find a piece of land in the country
around here, in the Valley, for instance...

1326
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:57,700
and get the thing built. You'd get
a big kick out of that, wouldn't you?

1327
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,300
I don't know, Steve.

1328
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:03,600
That was just a romantic idea I once had.
What's wrong with this house?

1329
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:07,800
It's got marble, even.
Good night, Steve. I'm absolutely dead.

1330
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:24,800
I agree with you, baby. No more contracts.
I've told Dick how you feel.

1331
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,500
But this last one, this isn't just another one.

1332
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,500
This is you and me in the same picture.
It's one thing I've had my heart set on.

1333
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,600
When we've done it, we've done everything.

1334
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,800
Then we blow this town,
do anything you want.

1335
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,600
- The script is ready.
- It's good.

1336
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:41,700
- You could shoot in a month.
- A hard month of dance rehearsals.

1337
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,000
This will be fun.

1338
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,100
Why don't you go away for a year
and do this when you come back?

1339
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:48,400
That's no good. Say yes, Julie.

1340
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,500
- You can say no, too. You're a citizen.
- Shut up, Steve.

1341
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:02,200
<i>The stars are gonna twinkle and shine</i>

1342
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,500
<i>This evening about a quarter to nine</i>

1343
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,800
<i>My loving arms</i>

1344
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,100
<i>are gonna tenderly twine, tweet, tweet, twine</i>

1345
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:21,200
<i>Around you, around a quarter to nine</i>

1346
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,500
<i>I know I won't be late</i>
<i>'cause at half past eight</i>

1347
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,300
<i>I'm gonna hurry there</i>

1348
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,900
<i>I'll be waiting where the lane begins</i>

1349
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,600
<i>Waiting for you on needles and pins</i>

1350
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:38,900
<i>And then the world is gonna be mine</i>

1351
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:41,000
<i>mine, all mine</i>

1352
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:45,900
<i>This evening around a quarter to nine</i>

1353
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,200
Good evening.

1354
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,100
- How was the picture?
- Wonderful.

1355
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,800
- Henry, it was a mild sensation.
- I'm glad.

1356
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:00,000
There's nobody here.

1357
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:03,700
What do you know? A big Jolson preview
and no mob waiting at home?

1358
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,600
- What do you suppose happened?
- It could be me.

1359
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,000
- Could be you?
- I told Henry to tell any callers...

1360
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:13,500
that we went straight from the theater
to Santa Barbara for the weekend.

1361
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,700
- Suppose that did it?
- You're kidding.

1362
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:23,000
Show you how it works. Listen.

1363
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,900
Sorry, Mr. And Mrs. Jolson
left for Santa Barbara.

1364
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:28,800
That's too bad.
Say we stopped by, will you?

1365
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:31,200
- Good night, Henry.
- Good night.

1366
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:35,300
- Simple.
- Sweetheart, that's cute.

1367
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,200
Should have thought of it a long time ago.

1368
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,800
- You don't really mind, do you, Al?
- Mind?

1369
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,400
You see, tonight's a different night.
The last picture's finished.

1370
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,800
We're free. Not a contract in the world.

1371
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,700
- The governor sent the pardon.
- That's right.

1372
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:54,100
I thought a quiet evening around the fire,
discussing plans for the future.

1373
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,300
Look, sandwiches, coffee...

1374
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:00,700
and we'll play some records
by a fella named Al Jolson, very talented.

1375
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:04,200
That guy's washed up,
hasn't even got a picture contract.

1376
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,700
- Have some coffee, Steve?
- Thanks, Julie, I will.

1377
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:10,400
Honey, you sound like a gal
with a program all figured out.

1378
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:13,200
First we shake this town for points east...

1379
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,400
maybe farther east than that,
across the Atlantic, who knows?

1380
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,900
Cream for you, Steve.

1381
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:22,100
And when that's out of our system,
there's a little matter of building that house.

1382
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:25,000
That I gotta see if I never see
another house in the world.

1383
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,300
I kind of got a hankering to see it myself.

1384
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:30,600
I'm glad to hear that,
because I can have it up in no time.

1385
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:34,400
I know every room in the place.
I've even got it furnished.

1386
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:36,100
Just one thing...

1387
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:39,400
in our travels to find the right place
to put that house.

1388
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,400
You don't mean the East, do you, baby?

1389
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,000
That was the original idea. Why change it?

1390
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,300
We've gotten used to this country here.
I like it.

1391
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:51,500
I don't know, it feels more like home
than any place in the world...

1392
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,300
and it doesn't matter too much to you,
does it, sweetheart?

1393
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:58,400
No, not really. And if it does to you, Al.

1394
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:02,000
Don't put it that way. There's nothing
special you want in the East, is there?

1395
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:05,200
No, that's true. That settles it.
It's going to be here.

1396
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,500
- Wonderful!
- And you keep quiet.

1397
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:12,400
Only, Al, we could get out
in the country a little way, couldn't we?

1398
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:14,200
- Sure, why not?
- Thanks.

1399
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,900
That's all I wanted.

1400
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:19,100
With no number on the house,
and some vicious dogs in the yard...

1401
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,600
you can keep the callers
down to practically nothing.

1402
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:24,600
It's Friday. What about train tickets
out of here, say, Sunday?

1403
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,500
I can be ready tomorrow,
but Sunday will have to do.

1404
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,500
What's the rush?
Let's give ourselves a little time.

1405
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,300
Let's say a week or so.

1406
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,200
What do we want with a week or so?

1407
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:37,000
No kidding, a week would wrap up
everything fine for me.

1408
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,200
- What have you got to wrap up?
- Not a thing.

1409
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,700
He just thinks he has.
Nothing important at all.

1410
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:43,400
Have a coffee, Al. It's great.

1411
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,800
- Look, boys, is something cooking?
- No, there's nothing cooking.

1412
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,500
It was just an idea, that's all.

1413
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:53,200
A proposition about putting a company
together and making our own pictures...

1414
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:57,500
Nothing definite, just talking about it.
Of course, in a week or so it could gel.

1415
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:00,900
It might be a pretty exciting thing
to come back to. That's all it was.

1416
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:05,300
Sorry, no gelling. First thing you know,
you've set a date to make a picture.

1417
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:09,300
Then we'll have to travel with one eye
on the calendar or something just as bad:

1418
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,400
Talking about a picture
all the time we're gone.

1419
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:14,400
- Not a peep. Give you my word.
- Fine, darling.

1420
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,200
But I know this is silly,
but it's gotten to be a sort of principle.

1421
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:22,000
Once we do say
we're going to quit for a while...

1422
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
- Who said we weren't?
- Then, whatever this proposition is...

1423
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:29,100
it'll still be there
in three months or six months...

1424
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,100
And just as hot, so why bother now?
Why don't you lay off, Al?

1425
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:34,400
What a beating I'm taking here.

1426
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,000
But look, honey, remember me?
This is Jolson.

1427
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I go with the principle every time,
but all I'm talking about is a couple of days.

1428
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:45,300
When you want to spend them that way, Al,
that's where the principle is.

1429
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:49,400
It isn't the days.
It doesn't have anything to do with time.

1430
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,500
If you can't see that, Al,
I wouldn't know how to...

1431
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,900
Holy smoke, this is a kid stunt, isn't it?

1432
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,600
I'll be right back.

1433
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,700
First time I ever saw Julie cry.

1434
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:14,200
- Something wrong with me, I guess, Steve.
- Yeah, has been for a long time.

1435
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:34,400
You're going to hate to stop work
and go away, aren't you?

1436
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:38,300
It's going to be awfully tough, isn't it?
Not singing always is.

1437
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:41,100
And here I am asking you to go away
without any plans...

1438
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:43,000
without even any work to come back to.

1439
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,200
Honest, it doesn't matter that much, baby.

1440
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,000
You know how it is
when an old fire horse hears the bell.

1441
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:50,200
I didn't say it was your fault.

1442
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:55,400
That's not what I'm trying to say.
What we've got to discuss is you and me.

1443
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,200
Please, Al, just listen hard for once,
will you?

1444
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:03,600
You see, I'm like somebody
with one desperate chance left.

1445
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,700
I couldn't go on this way if I wanted to.
That means you'd have to change.

1446
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:12,300
You'd have to get off this merry-go-round
and quit for once, for a long time.

1447
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:15,500
And I know you'd make promises
and try to keep them.

1448
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:17,900
But I'd know how you felt.

1449
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,800
I couldn't have any happiness
out of wishing the tiniest misery on you.

1450
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:25,800
Any way you look at it,
there's got to be misery for both of us.

1451
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:31,100
And the way we feel about each other, rather
than let that die a slow, painful death...

1452
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,700
I think we ought to have the courage
to quit now.

1453
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,500
That's the one thing that can't happen.

1454
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:40,500
- Be honest, Al.
- I never understood a thing.

1455
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:46,700
You've heard of fellas who hit the bottle
and wind up hopeless drunks.

1456
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:49,800
Whatever drives me that way
and won't let me understand...

1457
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,100
it's the same thing.

1458
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:54,400
I've been like a fella
who's been drunk all his life.

1459
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:57,500
And you know,
a guy like that will get so bad...

1460
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,400
he'll pass up the thing he wants
more than anything else.

1461
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,400
You don't have to tell me
how you feel about me. I know that.

1462
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:06,900
No, listen, baby.
I do have to tell you, because listen...

1463
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,600
I've been kicked around in my time.

1464
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:13,100
I thought I could take anything,
but your saying you want to quit because...

1465
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,300
Look, baby, if it means losing you...
It isn't even a contest.

1466
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,600
I don't want any more contracts, or shows,
or any singing in the world.

1467
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:24,500
You can't make me a gift of your whole life.
I just couldn't take it.

1468
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:26,900
No, look, baby, it's giving you nothing...

1469
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,400
except this show business,
and that's cheated me all my life.

1470
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,500
It stands to cheat me right now
because I know what would happen.

1471
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:36,000
I'd go on the same way,
working my head off...

1472
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:39,100
living everybody's life but my own,
and at the same time...

1473
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,600
Iose the only thing
I was lucky to get out of it.

1474
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:45,600
I know what you're thinking.
I'm kidding myself and don't know it.

1475
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,500
Maybe, yes. I don't know.
When you've been all your life like a drunk...

1476
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:53,100
you can't quit all of a sudden.
Sometimes you crave this stuff.

1477
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,900
But I am sober now, baby.

1478
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,600
And I want you to help me.

1479
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,200
If I start yelling, hit me over the head,
tie me down.

1480
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:04,700
Because when you go, baby,
I got nothing left.

1481
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,500
So, be a pal, Julie. Do what I ask you.

1482
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,300
- Hello, Henry.
- Sir, welcome.

1483
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:26,600
Honey, it's a miracle.
Why, it fell from heaven.

1484
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:29,800
You're over the threshold, you fool.
Put me down.

1485
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:33,500
- It's a sensational job, Julie.
- Thank you, boys. Thank you.

1486
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,000
Alice, Henry, the house looks beautiful.
You've done a wonderful job.

1487
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:40,400
You've worked hard enough now.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?

1488
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,900
That's right. Go ahead.

1489
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:45,800
- Don't worry about dinner. We'll get a snack.
- Kitchen snack. That's for me.

1490
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:49,100
- Shall I take the bags up now?
- Don't worry. We'll take care of them.

1491
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,600
Yeah, so long, Henry. Have a good time.

1492
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:53,400
Checkers.

1493
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,800
I used to be a champ back in Washington.
Come on, I'll play you a game.

1494
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,700
Checkers, now? You just came in.
How about unpacking?

1495
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:02,100
- We got months to unpack.
- Months.

1496
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:07,000
Wood and everything. I'll light a fire.
We'll play right over here, nice and cozy.

1497
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,700
It's not cold enough for a fire.

1498
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,400
If he wants to light a fire
in his own home, he can.

1499
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,700
That's telling him, baby.

1500
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:15,200
Move that lamp off.
We'll bring the table right here.

1501
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:17,500
Steve, get this one out of the way.

1502
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:20,200
- What'll I do with it?
- Put it anyplace.

1503
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,200
Get that, will you, Steve?

1504
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:24,600
- Where?
- In the library.

1505
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,500
Put it there. Steve, the phone.

1506
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:34,600
Let's take that telephone out, Julie.

1507
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,400
Don't be silly. We need a telephone.

1508
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:39,700
Why? People got along without them
for thousands of years.

1509
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:44,100
Anybody wants to get in touch with us,
let them do it by carrier pigeon.

1510
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,200
We've retired, sweetheart.
Come on, sit down.

1511
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:50,900
I'll play you for who's going to be boss
in this house.

1512
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:53,100
- It's Dick Glenn, the studio.
- Not here.

1513
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,900
- He wants to wish you luck in the new home.
- Tell him thanks.

1514
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:58,700
If the studio has this telephone number,
change it.

1515
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:00,200
Your move, baby.

1516
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:03,800
- Big fire, isn't it?
- Yeah, it sure is.

1517
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:10,100
- Want to move this way a little bit, baby?
- All right.

1518
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,300
Cozy, Steve?

1519
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,500
For a Turkish bath, it's very nice.

1520
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:26,400
- Is it a little warm in here, baby?
- It is, a little.

1521
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:33,700
There's nothing like a five-alarm fire
on a nice spring day.

1522
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:36,800
You know,
I never wanted this table in the living room.

1523
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,000
It should be in the library.
It's much cozier in there.

1524
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,900
- You want to move in there now, honey?
- Yeah, let's.

1525
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,000
We'll be with you in a minute, Steve.
Just sit down and relax.

1526
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,100
It's your home, too, you know.

1527
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:13,700
New Zealand. <i>Go Into Your Dance</i>
was playing there lately. Funny.

1528
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,800
Still hearing from places like that
after all this time.

1529
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:19,100
It's the fan letters from China I like to read.

1530
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:21,100
- Where's Julie?
- She'll be back.

1531
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:22,900
- For lunch?
- That's what she said.

1532
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:25,700
- Where'd she go?
- Into town. I don't know.

1533
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,900
Why didn't she tell me?
I could have gone along for the ride.

1534
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:32,200
Your folks' wedding anniversary tomorrow.
You'll phone them?

1535
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:38,000
- I wish we'd have gone east and celebrated.
- Julie wanted to go, and you said no.

1536
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,300
I know. I just didn't feel like it then.

1537
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:43,900
We should've brought the folks
to California for their anniversary this year.

1538
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:48,000
We talk about doing it every year,
and never do. It would have been nice.

1539
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,000
I wish Julie had told me
where she was going.

1540
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,000
She'll be here in a little while. Look, Al...

1541
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,600
this manuscript of Baron's new show.

1542
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:01,600
You want to change your mind and read it,
or shall I send it back?

1543
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:04,300
I don't know. Better send it back.

1544
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:07,700
- He's wired about it twice.
- Why doesn't he stop wiring?

1545
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,100
We've told him 50 times in this last year,
I'm not interested in any shows.

1546
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,900
Wait a minute. Tom knows that.

1547
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:16,600
All he wants is your opinion,
and any ideas you might have.

1548
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:21,800
Tell him I'm sorry, Steve.
I don't want to read it. Haven't the patience.

1549
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:25,800
- Hello, Al.
- There she is.

1550
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:30,300
Surprise!

1551
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,400
- Mama, Papa!
- Asa!

1552
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,800
- What a surprise. Who thought of this?
- Steve.

1553
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,800
- Julie.
- Mama.

1554
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,000
No, Papa.

1555
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
- Look, he's gonna cry.
- Go away.

1556
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,700
A big boy like him.

1557
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:49,600
This is the life.

1558
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:53,600
You know, Mama,
if I tried, I could get used to this.

1559
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,300
- You go right ahead and try, Papa.
- You and Mama ought to move out here.

1560
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,200
Henry, will you see who that is, please?

1561
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:04,700
We've got acres of land.
We'll build you a house right next door.

1562
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:05,600
Next door?

1563
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:08,400
How would Papa get to a synagogue
on the Sabbath?

1564
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,700
You know, on the Sabbath, you mustn't ride.

1565
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:15,100
It would be a long walk back to Washington,
especially two trips a week.

1566
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,700
Mr. Baron.

1567
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,600
- Hello, everybody.
- Tom, how wonderful to see you.

1568
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,200
- Looking fine. Where'd you drop from?
- New York, Steve. How are you?

1569
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,800
- Cantor, please sit down.
- Thank you.

1570
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,500
- Mrs. Yoelson.
- How do you do, Mr. Baron?

1571
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,800
Al, you look wonderful.

1572
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:33,800
- Hello, Tom. When did you arrive?
- Just flew in.

1573
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:37,200
- Had no idea I'd find the whole family here.
- You lost no time finding me.

1574
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,800
- That's right...
- You wasted a trip.

1575
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,400
You can turn around and go back.

1576
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:43,700
I'm not interested in your show.
Steve's told you that, hasn't he?

1577
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,900
- AI, wait a second.
- I've quit. I've worked enough.

1578
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:50,100
For you, too. Busting out here
like this'll get you nothing.

1579
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,300
Al, what's the matter with you?

1580
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:58,100
You happen to be wrong, Al.
To cast a Broadway show these days...

1581
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,300
you have to come to Hollywood
to find the actors.

1582
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:03,200
I can't imagine coming here
and not saying hello to you...

1583
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:06,200
- after quite a few years together.
- Of course.

1584
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:11,300
- You'll have lunch with us, won't you?
- Julie, I'd love to, but as a matter of fact...

1585
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:14,300
As a matter of fact,
we wouldn't think of letting you go.

1586
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:17,200
Henry, set Mr. Baron up here.
Move over, Steve.

1587
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,200
Come here, Tom, sit down.

1588
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,000
Look, pal. Look, everybody.

1589
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:25,800
There was a crazy fella here a minute ago,
but I think he's gone now.

1590
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,000
You can relax.

1591
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
- How long are you staying?
- I'm flying back late tomorrow night.

1592
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,700
Mama and Papa have the guest room.

1593
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:34,800
There's a studio bed in the library
for Tom tonight. With bath.

1594
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,100
- What do you say, Mr. Baron?
- No, I really...

1595
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,400
That's settled.

1596
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:41,700
And tomorrow night you will attend
the wedding anniversary dinner...

1597
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:45,600
- of Cantor and Mrs. Yoelson.
- I wouldn't miss that for anything.

1598
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:49,600
- But about tonight, I've got a hotel room.
- Sorry, you're staying here, my boy.

1599
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:52,600
And look, son, I'm gonna read
that little show of yours tomorrow.

1600
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:56,300
Yes, sir, I'm gonna give it Mr. Jolson's
personal attention and advice.

1601
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:57,600
And tomorrow night...

1602
01:46:57,700 --> 01:47:00,200
What do you say to our
having the dinner party here?

1603
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:04,400
- What do you think of that idea, Papa?
- This I could also get used to.

1604
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:15,100
It's gonna be beautiful out there tonight.

1605
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:18,500
It's about time those two
stopped talking in there.

1606
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:23,500
- Luck to it, Tom.
- You've been a big help to me, Al.

1607
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,900
I got a kick out of working on it.

1608
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,900
Like old times. It happens to be good.

1609
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,700
If I ever had any idea
of going back to the old grind...

1610
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:34,500
it's the kind of a show I'd want.

1611
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:38,900
Not that I have any such idea.
Matter of fact, I couldn't stand it.

1612
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,800
- What do you mean?
- A show's a big job. You gotta be up to it.

1613
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,800
Look at me.
Laying off for a long time like this.

1614
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:49,900
Pipes not what they used to be.
I'll tell you something you never knew.

1615
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:53,300
Every opening night of my life,
I used to have knots right in here.

1616
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,800
No, that's all behind me, Tom.
Luck again, pal.

1617
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:02,200
Al hasn't been as excited about anything
in a long time, has he, Steve?

1618
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,200
I don't know.

1619
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,300
- Must be a good show.
- Not bad.

1620
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:07,800
He gave Tom some good ideas
this afternoon.

1621
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,900
Julie, make him sing tonight.

1622
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:13,000
I'm afraid we won't have any more luck
than we had last night.

1623
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:15,300
He'll play records again, but that's all.

1624
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:18,200
Well, I can understand.
He has sung enough.

1625
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:22,500
- Let the records sing for a change.
- Nice idea, Cantor.

1626
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,600
Speaking of change, Papa,
do you think it's been good for Al?

1627
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:29,000
- Good? How do you mean?
- Does he seem happy to you?

1628
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,500
Of course.

1629
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:34,500
- Exactly like he used to be?
- A little more settled, maybe.

1630
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,400
After all, it's time. He's no boy anymore.

1631
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:42,500
- Dinner is ready, Mrs. Jolson.
- Good, I'll break this up.

1632
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,700
All right, that's all, boys.
Join the party. Dinner's served.

1633
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,600
That's that. Washes everything up.

1634
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:54,000
From here in, Mama, we belong to you.
I'm hungry. Let's go.

1635
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:58,100
My dear Cantor, if you'll give your arm
to the bride and lead the way.

1636
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:16,600
The Cantor and Mrs. Yoelson
are the youngest couple I've ever known.

1637
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:19,200
It doesn't matter how many years
they've been married.

1638
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:21,400
All that counts is the spirit.

1639
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,400
And I wish them
100 more young years of happiness.

1640
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,500
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

1641
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,900
- Thank you.
- Speech, Cantor.

1642
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:30,800
Yeah, speech, come on.

1643
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:33,300
- No...
- Come on, Papa.

1644
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:41,000
Thank you, Mr. Martin.
That was very beautiful.

1645
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,000
In fact...

1646
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:47,800
That wine was very good, Mama.

1647
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:52,600
I mean, what you said before
about the spirit, Mr. Martin.

1648
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,200
By a strange coincidence...

1649
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:59,400
we actually said something just like that...

1650
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:03,200
the night of our wedding,
while Mama and I were dancing.

1651
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:09,000
I said, "Let's always dance."

1652
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:13,100
And how we danced that wedding night.

1653
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:19,100
Asa, you should have seen us.

1654
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,600
I remember, you couldn't be there.

1655
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:27,600
Anyhow, I thank you all.

1656
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,600
That was very good, Papa.

1657
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:56,500
Remember that, Asa?

1658
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:00,000
I've heard you sing it
a thousand times, Papa.

1659
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:04,500
That was the waltz at our wedding.
Come on, Asa, sing with me.

1660
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,100
No, you go ahead, Papa.

1661
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:10,500
Listen to this.

1662
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,900
As a little boy, he used to sing
with me at the synagogue.

1663
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:17,600
What's the matter? Too big a man now?

1664
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:24,500
Mama, tell the truth.
Who was always a better singer, me or Asa?

1665
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,200
You, of course, Papa.

1666
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:30,600
Do you hear that? Come on.

1667
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,400
Please?

1668
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,400
<i>How we danced</i>

1669
01:51:56,500 --> 01:52:00,900
<i>on the night we were wed</i>

1670
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:05,600
<i>We vowed our true love</i>

1671
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:10,300
<i>though a word wasn't said</i>

1672
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:14,700
<i>The world was in bloom</i>

1673
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,600
<i>there were stars in the skies</i>

1674
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:24,000
<i>Except for the few</i>

1675
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:29,000
<i>that were there in your eyes</i>

1676
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:33,500
<i>Dear, as I held you close in my arms</i>

1677
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:37,700
<i>Angels were singing a hymn to your charms</i>

1678
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:42,600
<i>Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low</i>

1679
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:47,000
<i>"Darling, I love you so!"</i>

1680
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:53,200
<i>The night seemed to fade</i>

1681
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:58,000
<i>into blossoming dawn</i>

1682
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:02,400
<i>The sun shone anew</i>

1683
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:07,000
<i>but the dance lingered on</i>

1684
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:11,500
<i>Could we but recall</i>

1685
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:16,200
<i>that sweet moment sublime</i>

1686
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:21,000
<i>We'd find that our love</i>

1687
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
<i>is unaltered</i>

1688
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:30,000
<i>by time</i>

1689
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,500
- That's that.
- Thank you, Asa. That was very nice.

1690
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:51,400
Cantor, you two
have a fine dancing act there.

1691
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:54,800
Do you think we could pick up a little time?

1692
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:58,100
I can book you solid for the season.

1693
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:01,000
It was a beautiful party, Julie.

1694
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:03,500
I'd like to take over from here on.

1695
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:06,700
Suppose we drive into town
and you all be my guests at a nightclub.

1696
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,700
- What do you say?
- Nightclub now?

1697
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:11,600
Yes. We could see an early floor show,
and I can catch my plane.

1698
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,700
- No, let's not.
- Why?

1699
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,400
Well, I haven't been
in one of those spots in years.

1700
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:21,100
We're just country folks, Tom.
We don't go for that fast life.

1701
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:24,700
Anyway, Mama and Papa
wouldn't be interested in a nightclub.

1702
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:25,800
Yes, we would.

1703
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,500
There you are.

1704
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:32,600
And it's not your anniversary, son,
it's theirs. Come on, let's go.

1705
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:18,000
In all your years in show business, Papa,
you didn't see anything like this yet.

1706
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm interrupting</i>
<i>the show to make an announcement.</i>

1707
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:37,900
<i>We have a celebrity with us...</i>

1708
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,500
<i>a man you've enjoyed and admired</i>
<i>for many years.</i>

1709
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:43,200
<i>He's been away for a long time,</i>
<i>and we've missed him a lot.</i>

1710
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:45,600
<i>But he still is the greatest entertainer</i>
<i>of them all.</i>

1711
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:47,000
Wonder who he means?

1712
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,900
<i>It's an honor to introduce...</i>

1713
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:59,500
<i>That's right, it's</i> Mammy
<i>and the man who made it famous...</i>

1714
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,400
<i>the one and only Al Jolson!</i>

1715
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:14,700
The idiot.

1716
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,100
<i>There's a slight chance,</i>
<i>if we ask him hard enough...</i>

1717
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,500
<i>just for old times' sake,</i>
<i>Mr. Jolson might give us a song.</i>

1718
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:23,300
- This guy's crazy.
- Come on, Al!

1719
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:28,300
Sorry, no.

1720
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:35,400
They're not going to stop.
Better do it and get it over with.

1721
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:41,200
Baby, it looks like
I'm not going to get out of this. I'm sorry.

1722
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:58,700
Thanks, Eddie. Thank you, boys.
That was a big introduction.

1723
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:00,500
Just talk into this?

1724
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:04,300
<i>Thank you, folks.</i>
<i>It's nice to be remembered.</i>

1725
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,200
<i>I can't tell you how nice.</i>

1726
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:09,800
<i>But about singing for you,</i>
<i>you see, I'm a little rusty...</i>

1727
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:12,600
<i>but you asked for it,</i>
<i>so we'll just make it a quick one.</i>

1728
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:15,900
- What do the boys handle that I can sing?
- Anything.

1729
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:17,600
<i>Robert E. Lee.</i>

1730
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:20,100
I don't think I'll need this.

1731
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,900
<i>Watch them shuffling along</i>

1732
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,200
<i>See them shuffling along</i>

1733
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:32,000
<i>Go take your best gal, your real pal</i>

1734
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:35,400
<i>Go down to the levee, I said the levee</i>

1735
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:38,600
<i>join that shuffling throng</i>

1736
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:40,900
<i>Hear that music and song!</i>

1737
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:44,600
<i>It's simply great, mate, waiting on the levee</i>

1738
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:47,200
<i>Waiting for the Robert E. Lee</i>

1739
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:50,900
<i>Watch them shuffling along</i>

1740
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:53,100
<i>See them shuffling along</i>

1741
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:56,800
<i>Go take your best gal, your real pal</i>

1742
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:00,200
<i>Go down to the levee, I said the levee</i>

1743
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:03,000
<i>Join that shuffling throng</i>

1744
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,800
<i>Hear that music and song</i>

1745
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:09,600
<i>It's simply great, mate, waiting on the levee</i>

1746
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:12,400
<i>Waiting for the Robert E. Lee</i>

1747
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,600
Great.

1748
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,100
More!

1749
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:25,800
They'll mob him.

1750
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:37,700
All right.

1751
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,400
Come on out, gang. Everybody.

1752
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:47,100
Everybody in the show,
come out and sit down.

1753
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:50,100
You work hard every night
and must be tired of doing this show.

1754
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:52,500
Just sit down,
and I'll take over for you tonight.

1755
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,600
Haven't worked in a long time.

1756
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:56,500
Gather around,
make yourselves comfortable.

1757
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:58,400
You ain't heard nothing yet.

1758
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:04,900
You pick it, Professor. What'll it be?

1759
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:08,500
<i>Rock-a-bye!</i>

1760
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:13,100
Yes, sir. I think I remember that one.

1761
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:19,300
<i>Rock-a-bye your baby</i>

1762
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:23,800
<i>with a Dixie melody</i>

1763
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:29,600
<i>When you croon, croon a tune</i>

1764
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,800
<i>from the heart of Dixie</i>

1765
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,100
<i>Hang that cradle, Mammy mine</i>

1766
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:43,200
<i>Right on that Mason-Dixon line</i>

1767
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:48,800
<i>And swing it from Virginia</i>

1768
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:53,200
<i>To Tennessee with all the soul that's in you</i>

1769
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:56,400
<i>Weep No More, My Lady</i>

1770
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:00,000
You see, what he didn't have at home,
Mama, was an audience.

1771
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:02,300
Live faces. Isn't that it, Steve?

1772
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:07,400
<i>And Old Black Joe, just as though</i>

1773
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:11,500
<i>you had me on your knee</i>

1774
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:16,700
<i>A million baby kisses I'll deliver</i>

1775
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:21,600
<i>if you will only sing The Swanee River</i>

1776
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:26,300
<i>Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby</i>

1777
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:30,700
<i>with a Dixie melody</i>

1778
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:38,500
<i>Rock-a-bye hush-a-bye</i>

1779
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:42,800
<i>to a Dixie melody</i>

1780
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:49,100
<i>When you croon, croon a tune</i>

1781
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:51,000
<i>from the heart of</i>

1782
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,700
You see, Papa,
Al was sure he didn't want to sing anymore.

1783
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
He wanted to be with me.

1784
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:01,100
- I think I let him make the wrong decision.
- I don't get this, Julie.

1785
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:04,800
I think Papa does.

1786
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:08,600
<i>To Tennessee with all the soul</i>

1787
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:13,800
<i>that's in you, Mammy!</i>

1788
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:17,800
<i>Mammy, listen what they're playing</i>
<i>They're playing Weep No More, My Lady</i>

1789
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:21,500
<i>Sing it for me and Old Black Joe</i>

1790
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:27,200
<i>just as though you had me on your knee!</i>

1791
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:32,300
<i>A million baby kisses I'll deliver</i>

1792
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:37,200
<i>if you will only sing The Swanee River</i>

1793
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:42,200
<i>Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby</i>

1794
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:47,200
<i>with a Dixie melody</i>

1795
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:54,600
<i>April Showers!</i>

1796
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:01,200
You heard them, Professor.

1797
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:06,100
<i>Though April showers may come your way</i>

1798
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:11,000
<i>Though April showers may come your way</i>

1799
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:14,400
<i>They bring the flowers</i>

1800
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:18,100
<i>that bloom in May</i>

1801
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:21,000
<i>So if it's raining</i>

1802
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,700
<i>have no regrets</i>

1803
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:29,700
<i>because it isn't raining rain, you know</i>

1804
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,600
<i>it's raining violets</i>
<i>And where you see clouds</i>

1805
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:36,400
Excuse me.

1806
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:40,800
<i>You soon will see crowds</i>

1807
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:44,100
<i>of daffodils</i>

1808
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:48,800
<i>So keep on looking for a bluebird</i>

1809
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,400
- Where do you think you're going?
- Home.

1810
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,000
Throw some things in the car.

1811
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:58,100
- I'll be gone by the time he gets back.
- Don't do that, Julie.

1812
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:00,000
He tried awfully hard, Steve...

1813
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,600
- but you and I know he's got to do that.
- Now, wait...

1814
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:06,900
See that he's on that plane
with Tom tonight. They'll do a great show.

1815
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:11,500
- This is going to kill him, Julie.
- It isn't going to be so good for me, either.

1816
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:14,800
But, look, when did you last see him
as happy as that?

1817
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:18,200
<i>Have no regrets</i>

1818
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:22,200
<i>Because it isn't raining rain</i>

1819
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:25,300
<i>you know, it's raining violets</i>

1820
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:28,200
Steve, when he gets home nights
after the show...

1821
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,000
don't let him sing too long.

1822
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:35,500
<i>You soon will see crowds</i>

1823
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:38,600
<i>of daffodils</i>

1824
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:43,100
<i>So keep on looking for a bluebird</i>

1825
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:48,000
<i>And listening for its song</i>

1826
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:54,900
<i>Whenever April showers</i>

1827
02:03:55,200 --> 02:04:00,200
<i>come along</i>

1828
02:04:01,305 --> 02:05:01,752
