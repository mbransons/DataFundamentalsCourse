1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,310
<i>This story consists of my recollections</i>
<i>of a very unusual young man... </i>

3
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,552
<i>... with whom I was thrown</i>
<i>into contact at long intervals. </i>

4
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,756
<i>In the summer of 1919... </i>

5
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,878
. <i>... while passing through Chicago</i>
<i>on my way to the Far East... </i>

6
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,235
<i>... a friend of mine, Elliott Templeton... </i>

7
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,436
<i>... whom I had known</i>
<i>in London and Paris... </i>

8
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,070
<i>... invited me to dine with him</i>
<i>and his sister, Mrs. Bradley. </i>

9
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,630
<i>They were giving a dinner party at</i>
<i>one of those sprawling country clubs... </i>

10
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,189
<i>... which were so much a part</i>
<i>of the American scene... </i>

11
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,510
<i>... in the early days</i>
<i>of the postwar boom. </i>

12
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,474
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. Mr. Templeton's table.

13
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,517
- Yes, sir.
- Are they here?

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,069
They're having refreshments, sir.

15
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,189
- Oh, here you are.
- With a dry martini, sir.

16
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,510
Prohibition, of all the bloody nonsense.

17
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,159
- Elliott.
- Yes, dear?

18
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,151
Who is this man
that you asked to dinner?

19
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,880
I had to get Sophie last minute
or we woulďve been 13.

20
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,828
He's an English author. He's quite
all right. In fact, he's really quite famous.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,911
So pretend that you've heard of him.

22
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,275
That's too much. Get the other glasses.

23
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,557
Elliott, you must be slipping
if you frequent authors.

24
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,871
Not at all, my dear.
Authors go everywhere nowadays.

25
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,589
Why, in London, I even met actors
and actresses in society.

26
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,956
Here he is now.

27
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,555
My dear fellow,
how very nice to see you.

28
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,789
Hello, Elliott.

29
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,838
Let me present you to my sister,
Mrs. Bradley.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,592
Louisa.

31
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,273
Louisa, dear,
this is Mr. Somerset Maugham.

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,352
How do you do, Mr. Maugham?
It's an honor to have you with us.

33
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,238
Thank you. It's very nice to be here.

34
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,709
What on earth are you doing
in this benighted city?

35
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,111
I'm just passing through, but you,
I thought you never left Paris.

36
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,508
Why should I?

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,319
In fact, I came to see my sister
and my niece, Isabel.

38
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,278
I haven't been back
since before the war.

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,957
I hope you don't mind, a few
young things are joining us for dinner...

40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,599
...but we can leave early.

41
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,070
Why should I mind? I like young things
if they're good to look at.

42
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,358
Incidentally, you'll meet the young man
my niece has got herself engaged to.

43
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,229
His name is Larry Darrell, and I'll tell you
that Elliott doesn't approve of him.

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,188
I have nothing against him, but he hasn't
any money. And my sister's not rich.

45
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,316
- She needs all she's got.
- Elliott...

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,358
...is it necessary to tell Mr. Maugham
all our private affairs?

47
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,671
- We can't all be millionaires, Elliott.
- He hasn't even got a job.

48
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,956
- He can get one.
- He doesn't want a job.

49
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,839
- Why not?
- Because he's bone idle.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,549
That must shock a man like you
who's never earned a penny in his life.

51
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,555
It may have escaped your notice,
my dear fellow...

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,836
...but I am not an ordinary man.

53
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,118
- Cocktail?
- Oh, yes, please.

54
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,475
For the run of mankind,
industry is essential.

55
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,757
I see no reason why this man
my niece has got herself engaged to...

56
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,196
...should not conform
to the customs of his country.

57
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,838
Here's my niece now.

58
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,352
Oh, Mother.

59
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,068
- Hello, Isabel.
- Hello.

60
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,038
- This is my daughter, Isabel.
- How do you do, Mr. Maugham?

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,270
- Where's Larry?
- Late.

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,035
Poor sweet. I suppose he forgot
to wind his watch last night as usual.

63
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,952
You wouldn't know about Larry.

64
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,997
Say, Mother, you've mixed up
the cards...

65
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,673
- Oh, Sophie, dear.
- Hello, Sophie.

66
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,276
This is Sophie Nelson. Sophie
is a neighbor of ours in the country.

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,351
- How do you do?
- You look charming, Sophie.

68
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,636
Yes, doesn't she? Excuse us.

69
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,758
Come here.
I want to have a look at you.

70
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,469
- Sophie, you look lovely.
- It's the dress.

71
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,279
- You sure you don't mind my wearing it?
- Of course not.

72
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,750
- Lf you like it, take it as a present.
- Oh, that's awfully sweet of you.

73
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,878
Oh, it'll be such a surprise for Bob
to see me decently dressed.

74
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,430
Oh, you know Bob's much too much in
love with you to notice what you wear.

75
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,876
He's no more crazy about me
than I am about him.

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,715
I don't think anyone ever loved
anyone as I love him.

77
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,440
- Isn't it heavenly to be alive?
- Yes.

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,919
- Hi.
- Hello, Gray.

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,718
- Hello, Gray.
- May I break this up?

80
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,108
Sure.

81
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,759
Hello.

82
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,868
- You look lovely.
- Think so?

83
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,477
- Hello, Sophie.
- Hello.

84
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,278
May I get you one, Miss...?

85
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,431
- Miss Nelson, isn't it?
- Yes, Sophie Nelson.

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,113
I'd love it.

87
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,998
No, I guess I'd better not.

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,628
- Why? What's wrong with cocktails?
- Oh, nothing.

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,075
Only, I promised Bob I wouldn't.

90
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,390
- Who's Bob?
- My boyfriend.

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,757
He doesn't like me to drink.
He thinks I'm too fond of it.

92
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,912
- Which is Bob?
- Oh, he isn't here. He's working.

93
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,230
He's putting himself
through law school.

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,311
He's gonna drop in later
and take me home.

95
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,392
Will you have one of these?
If my man Joseph could see me now...

96
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,518
...I give you my word,
he'd faint dead away.

97
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,471
You're a great friend
of Mr. Templeton's.

98
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,553
Oh, I wouldn't say that. Elliott has
no friends, only acquaintances.

99
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,355
- He's an awful snob, isn't he?
- Oh, awful. But he's kind and generous.

100
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,478
People laugh at him, but they eat
his food and drink his wine.

101
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,513
Oh, Mr. Maugham. Mr. Maugham,
you're next to Mother.

102
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,511
And Sophie, you're next to Gray.

103
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,114
- That's us, toots.
- Mr. Maugham, Mr. Maturin.

104
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,508
- Isabel.
- Yes?

105
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,353
- Dinner, my dear fellow.
- Oh, yes.

106
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,830
And who's Mr. Maturin?

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,389
Oh, Gray. He's our millionaire.

108
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,630
His father's a big broker.
We're proud of him.

109
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,519
He gives us class. But he's nice.

110
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,877
I know several girls who'd stop
at nothing short of murder to get him.

111
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,156
- They haven't a chance.
- Why not?

112
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,595
He's so in love with Isabel
he can't see straight.

113
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,070
I see. And she's in love
with Larry Darrell.

114
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,992
I suppose that does
complicate matters.

115
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,391
It does, if you're as
high-principled as Gray is.

116
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,551
And Larry isn't here.

117
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,269
Yes, he's just coming in now,
way over there. Look.

118
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,476
Come on, dinner.

119
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,554
<i>This is the young man</i>
<i>of whom I write. </i>

120
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,392
<i>He is not famous. </i>

121
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,552
<i>It may be that when his life</i>
<i>at last comes to an end... </i>

122
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,951
<i>... he will leave no more trace</i>
<i>of his sojourn on this earth... </i>

123
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,477
<i>... than a stone thrown into a river</i>
<i>leaves on the surface of the water. </i>

124
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,110
<i>Yet it may be that the way of life</i>
<i>he has chosen for himself... </i>

125
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,875
<i>... may have an ever-growing influence</i>
<i>over his fellow men... </i>

126
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,156
<i>... so that, </i>
<i>long after his death perhaps... </i>

127
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,190
<i>... it may be realized that there lived</i>
<i>in this age a very remarkable creature. </i>

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,911
- You're very late, Larry.
- I'm sorry.

129
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,718
Sophie, where is Mr. Maugham?

130
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,031
Larry hasn't learned that punctuality
is the politeness of kings.

131
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,589
Elliott. Mr. Maugham,
this is Larry Darrell.

132
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,275
- When can we start dinner?
- Mr. Maugham's a novelist, darling.

133
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,432
I may as well tell you that Larry's
very stupid and uneducated.

134
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,239
He knows nothing
about anything except flying.

135
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,960
When he came back,
he looked so lovely in his uniform...

136
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,918
...I camped on his doorstep
until he consented to marry me.

137
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,799
- The competition was awful.
- Don't believe a word she says.

138
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,269
Isabel's not a bad girl,
but she's a terrible liar.

139
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,158
- Dinner.
- Oh, yes.

140
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,311
I've seen you before.

141
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,953
Oh, when?

142
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,839
I happened to have work to do,
and I went into the library.

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,319
I saw you there this morning.

144
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,755
When I came back from lunch,
you were still there.

145
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,229
- I forgot about lunch.
- I couldn't help admiring...

146
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,879
...your power of concentration.

147
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,951
- It was that kind of a book.
- My fellow...

148
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,588
...you're at the end of the table
with my sister.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,956
- Hello, Gray.
- Hi there.

150
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,918
Say, Dad tells me you turned down
that job in the office.

151
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,594
Oh, Larry, why have you done that?

152
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,593
I thought it over, and I figured
I'd be a disappointment...

153
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,877
...so I decided I'd better refuse.
- Sorry, old man.

154
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,679
It would have been swell,
us working together.

155
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,152
Hi. Looks as if tall, dark and legal
is standing you up tonight.

156
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,595
I'd like to catch him trying it.

157
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,320
- You're old friends?
- We grew up together.

158
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,914
I used to play shortstop
on his baseball team.

159
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,469
We used to think we could lick
any 10 kids our size.

160
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,154
- And could you?
- We tried.

161
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,278
Oh, here comes my young man now.

162
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,156
- Well, here you are.
- Hello.

163
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,035
This is Mr. Maugham. Bob MacDonald.

164
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,519
- How do you do?
- How are you?

165
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,114
He's the one who seems to think
he wants to marry me.

166
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,669
I can't see why, but there it is.

167
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,195
I just happen to be crazy
about the girl.

168
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,079
I wouldn't like him to know,
but just between you and me...

169
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,550
...I rather like him myself.
- Let's dance.

170
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,669
- Hello, Isabel.
- Hello.

171
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,594
Larry, why didn't you tell me that
Mr. Maturin had offered you a job?

172
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,159
What?

173
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,955
Larry, why didn't you tell me that
Mr. Maturin had offered you a job?

174
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,592
Answer me.

175
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,512
Answer me.

176
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,430
Well, I thought I'd better not until
I made up my mind one way or another.

177
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,589
You mad?

178
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,751
Darling, that's the horrible part
about you.

179
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,957
However aggravating you are,
one can't really be angry with you.

180
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,031
Oh, can't they?

181
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,470
Did you see those looks
Elliott was giving me?

182
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,551
Well, after all, Larry, a man must work.

183
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,598
And the longer you put it off,
the harder it'll be.

184
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,797
I've got a foolish notion I want
to do more than just sell bonds.

185
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,791
All right, then.

186
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,110
- Go into a law office.
- I don't wanna do that either.

187
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,516
What do you want to do then?

188
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,478
I don't know.

189
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,034
Loaf, maybe.

190
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,715
Oh, Larry, don't be funny.

191
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,711
This is serious.

192
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,513
I'm not being funny.
I think it's very serious.

193
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,960
I wouldn't make you miserable
for anything.

194
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,793
But you are making me miserable.

195
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,196
You see, I love you.

196
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,590
And I love you, Isabel.

197
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,629
Look, Larry, let's be sensible.

198
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,308
A man must work.
It's a matter of self-respect.

199
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,189
This is a young country, and it's a
man's duty to take part in its activities.

200
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,430
Gray's father was saying
only the other day...

201
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,990
...that we're beginning an era that
will make the past look like 30 cents.

202
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,469
He said that he can see
no limit to our progress...

203
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,430
...and that by 1930, we'll be the greatest
and richest country in the whole world.

204
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,717
- Don't you think that's terribly exciting?
- Terribly.

205
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,235
Why, there never was such a chance
for a young man.

206
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,709
I'd have thought
you'd be proud to be a part of it.

207
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,793
- It's such a wonderful adventure.
- I'm sure you're right, Isabel.

208
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,394
The Armours and Swifts
will pack more and better meat.

209
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,596
The McCormicks will turn
out more harvesters.

210
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,672
Henry Ford will make more cars,
and everybody will get richer.

211
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,832
- And what's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

212
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,960
Nothing. It just happens
that sitting in an office...

213
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,350
...and making a lot of money
doesn't interest me.

214
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,313
Oh, don't talk like a fool.
You can't live without money.

215
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,553
I have a little. That's what gives me
the chance to do what I want.

216
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,551
You're making it very difficult for me.

217
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,473
I'm sorry, darling.
I wouldn't if I could help it.

218
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,114
You can help it.

219
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,432
Yes?

220
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,837
The dead look so terribly dead
when they're dead.

221
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,913
- What does that mean, exactly?
- Just that.

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,355
Are you terribly unhappy, darling?

223
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,274
No, the only thing that makes me
unhappy is making you unhappy.

224
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,953
I don't think I'll ever find peace
until I make up my mind about things.

225
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,198
It's so difficult to put into words. The
minute you try, you feel embarrassed.

226
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,349
You say to yourself, "Who am I to bother
my head about this, that or the other?

227
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,308
Isn't it better to follow the beaten path
and let what's coming to you come?"

228
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,277
And then I think...

229
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,271
...of a guy I knew.

230
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,671
A minute before, he was
full of life and fun, and then...

231
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,997
...he was dead.

232
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,911
I've seen many men die,
but this one was different.

233
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,357
It was the last day of the war,
almost the last moment.

234
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,036
He coulďve saved himself,
but he didn't. He saved me and died.

235
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,229
So he's gone,
and I'm here alive. Why?

236
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,958
It's all so meaningless.

237
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
You can't help but ask yourself
what life is all about.

238
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,594
Whether there's any sense to it
or whether it's just a stupid blunder.

239
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,317
I hardly know what to say.
It's so unexpected.

240
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,797
Larry, do you think it would help
if you went away for a while?

241
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,669
- I think perhaps it would.
- Then why don't you go?

242
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,437
Because of you.

243
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,639
Larry, let's be frank with each other.

244
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,553
There's no place in your life
for me just now.

245
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,711
Does that mean you don't
want to be engaged?

246
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,791
Oh, no, foolish.

247
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,599
It means that I'm prepared to wait.

248
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,997
It might be a year, or even longer.

249
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,231
That doesn't matter.

250
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,277
It might be less.

251
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,670
Where have you thought of going?

252
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,478
Where?

253
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,430
Well, I thought I'd start
by going to Paris.

254
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,114
I went there several times on leave.

255
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,316
I've got it into my head that there...

256
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,199
...everything that's muddled
in my mind...

257
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,837
...would grow clear.

258
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,992
It's a funny place.

259
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,994
It gives you the feeling that you can
think out your thoughts to the very end.

260
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,116
I think over there I may be able
to see my way before me.

261
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,471
And if you don't?

262
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,239
I'll give it up as a bad job...

263
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,631
...come back to Chicago,
and take the first work I can get.

264
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,792
Oh, my darling.

265
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,757
Oh, Larry.

266
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,070
I love you.

267
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,754
I love you so much.

268
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,309
I cannot for the life of me
understand how Isabel...

269
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,268
...could possibly prefer that young man
to a fine chap like Gray.

270
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,113
Oh, I grant you, he's good-looking.
And his clothes fit.

271
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,157
But imagine, an opportunity...

272
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,869
...to go in with Gray and his father
on the ground floor.

273
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,712
Isabel.

274
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,071
Home so early?

275
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,718
Yes.

276
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,630
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

277
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,476
- Where's Larry?
- Gone. Hello, Mother.

278
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,868
- Did you have a talk?
- Yes.

279
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,350
- May I venture to inquire the result?
- He's going to Europe for a while.

280
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,034
- I promised to wait.
- What is he going to do in Europe?

281
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,270
- Loaf.
- Loaf? Don't be ridiculous.

282
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,556
- It's what he said.
- I have no patience with you.

283
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,314
If you had any spirit, you'd have
broken off your engagement.

284
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,993
What can I do?

285
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,357
- I love him.
- Come along.

286
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,752
It's all right.

287
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,830
Well, things might be
a great deal worse.

288
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,719
Oh, thank heavens.
<i>Merci</i>, Joseph.

289
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,713
I was just saying, Louisa,
things might be a great deal worse.

290
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,314
Don't get up. I don't see how.

291
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,109
My poor Louisa,
you have no imagination.

292
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,113
When you're young, your emotions
are violent, but not durable.

293
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,919
It's a delusion that absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

294
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,318
With Larry out
and Gray on the spot...

295
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,596
...I don't see why Isabel
shouldn't marry him.

296
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,069
You've been away from America
too long, Elliott.

297
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,515
In this country,
a girl doesn't marry a man...

298
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,036
...because her mother,
or even her uncle, wants her to.

299
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,316
That's nothing to be proud of, Louisa.

300
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,472
As a result of 30 years' experience,
I may tell you that a marriage arranged...

301
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,599
...with a regard for position and fortune
has every advantage over a love match.

302
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,594
In France, which, after all, is
the only civilized country in the world...

303
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,832
...Isabel would marry Gray
without thinking about it twice.

304
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,594
After a few months,
if she was still in love with Larry...

305
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,276
That will do. I know what you're going
to say. The idea doesn't appeal to me.

306
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,432
That's one of the things I've never
understood about you, Louisa.

307
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,716
Though you've lived half your life
in diplomatic society...

308
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,714
...in half the capitals of the world,
you've remained hopelessly American.

309
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,155
It isn't often that you pay me
a compliment, dear.

310
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,629
- It wasn't meant to be one.
- I know.

311
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,233
Well, I think I'll go to bed.

312
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,958
- Will you lock up?
- Yes, dear.

313
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,350
- Good night, Mr. Maugham.
- Good night.

314
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,429
You're very full of worldly wisdom
this evening.

315
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,830
Have you ever known me not to be?

316
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,072
I don't mind telling you,
I have a sneaking sympathy for the boy.

317
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,276
He's young and wants
to sow his wild oats...

318
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,115
...before he settles down to married life.
Very natural and very proper.

319
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,316
I'll keep my eye on him in Paris.

320
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,994
Of course, he must cross
on the <i>Aquitania</i>.

321
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,275
<i>I know the captain. </i>

322
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,115
<i>He'll see that Larry sits at his table</i>
<i>and meets the right people. </i>

323
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,076
<i>I'll look for an apartment for him</i>
<i>in a really smart quarter. </i>

324
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,151
<i>I'll do him proud. </i>

325
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,629
<i>I'll give some parties for him. </i>

326
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,475
<i>So many Americans, when they go</i>
<i>to Paris, get in with the wrong people. </i>

327
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,030
<i>And then they find it no end</i>
<i>of a job to shake them off. </i>

328
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,234
<i>I'll have my chauffeur, Marcel, </i>
<i>drive him about in the Rolls. </i>

329
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,675
<i>I detest the countryside. </i>

330
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,035
<i>But alas, all Americans</i>
<i>are born tourists... </i>

331
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,317
<i>... and no doubt, </i>
<i>he'll want to see the sights. </i>

332
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,233
<i>It would be perfect if I could arrange</i>
<i>for some older woman... </i>

333
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,277
<i>... to take him under her wing. </i>

334
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,750
<i>Princess Novemali, for instance. </i>

335
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,480
<i>He is young and he has a good figure. </i>

336
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,713
<i>I think she'd fall for him</i>
<i>like a ton of bricks. </i>

337
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,591
<i>In any event, the busier I keep him... </i>

338
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,752
<i>... the less time he'll have</i>
<i>to think about Isabel. </i>

339
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,716
Anything for Lawrence Darrell?

340
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,437
This wireless came
day before yesterday.

341
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,079
Thank you.

342
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,716
Excuse me. Pardon me, when does
the boat train from the <i>Aquitania</i> arrive?

343
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,155
- Eleven-thirty, monsieur.
- Thank you.

344
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,632
Why, of course, madame.

345
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,758
Larry! Larry!

346
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,716
Oh, Larry.

347
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,875
Oh, Larry, I've missed you.

348
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,554
I've missed you so much.

349
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,837
May I ask how he knew
you were coming?

350
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,718
Isabel cabled him from the ship.

351
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,110
- Are they still engaged?
- As far as I know.

352
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,919
- What about Gray Maturin?
- Still faithful.

353
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,150
I don't believe you've played
your cards well.

354
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,709
- I never had much card sense.
- Mother, here he is.

355
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,394
- Oh, how good of you to come.
- So nice to see you.

356
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,118
- Hello.
- How do you do?

357
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,716
- May Larry come to dinner with us?
- I understand Larry doesn't dine out.

358
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,518
- He will tonight. Won't you?
- I will.

359
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,035
That's very good of you.
I shall be delighted.

360
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,599
We'll meet you at the house.

361
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,274
Taxi. Taxi.

362
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,911
Come along, darling.
I've got a million things to tell you.

363
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,279
I'm afraid I haven't a very good account
to give you of that young man, Louisa.

364
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,271
When he first came to Paris,
for Isabel's sake, I asked him to lunch...

365
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,556
...to meet the sort of people
he ought to know.

366
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,314
- And he told me he didn't eat lunch.
- Perhaps he doesn't.

367
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,029
When I asked him to dinner, he couldn't
because he had no evening clothes.

368
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,357
If I live to be 100, I shall never
understand how any young man...

369
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,954
...could come to Paris
without evening clothes.

370
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,032
Maybe he just didn't want to.

371
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,159
That's the most incredible reason
for refusing an invitation I've ever heard.

372
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,356
- And where does he live?
- I haven't a notion.

373
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,034
Isabel writes to him in care
of the American Express.

374
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,309
Like a traveling salesman,
or a schoolteacher on vacation.

375
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,711
My own belief is that he's living
in the Latin Quarter with some bit...

376
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,757
...who's no better
than she ought to be.

377
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,957
I'm afraid you'll have to write him off
as one of your failures.

378
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,148
It might surprise you to know it,
my dear, but I've already done so.

379
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,436
She speaks so quickly
I can't understand her.

380
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,239
It's an old French custom.
Everyone has to wear a sprig...

381
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,631
...of lilies of the valley on May Day.
They're a symbol of happiness.

382
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,715
May Day. Imagine it's being May.

383
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,714
- I've been here nearly a month now.
- Oh, impossible. It was only yesterday.

384
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,440
I still don't know a thing
about what you've been doing.

385
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,558
Tell me, Larry. You must know
I've been dying to know.

386
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,995
Oh, nothing very exciting.
I've traveled around...

387
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,355
...read a lot, gone to lectures
at the Sorbonne.

388
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,034
Have you found that peace of mind
you were looking for?

389
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,873
No, but for the first time,
I see things in a clear light.

390
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,270
What does that mean?

391
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,434
It's rather difficult to explain. And even
if I try, you'll only be angry with me.

392
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,398
How much longer do you think
all this is going to take you?

393
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,838
I don't know. I don't know.
It's hard to say.

394
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,999
And after that, what are you going
to do with all this wisdom?

395
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,878
If I ever acquire wisdom, I suppose I'll be
wise enough to know what to do with it.

396
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,795
You know what Uncle Elliott says.

397
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,678
Nothing to my credit, I imagine.

398
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,752
He says you have a cozy
little hideout somewhere.

399
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,959
Come and see for yourself. The cozy
little hideout's only a step from here.

400
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,354
- Monsieur Darrell.
- Madame Duval, Mademoiselle Bradley.

401
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,750
- <i>Bonjour</i>.
- Monsieur Jacques Duval.

402
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,397
Did you see the looks they gave me?

403
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,869
Ruined my character,
that's what you've done.

404
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,873
This is where you live?

405
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,474
- You don't like it.
- No.

406
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,313
Well, it's all right. It's convenient.

407
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,916
How about a cup of coffee?

408
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,110
Larry, how can you bear to sit here
in a backwash when America's...

409
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,034
...living through the most glorious
adventure the world has ever known?

410
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,636
You've been away a year now,
a whole year out of your life.

411
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,032
You just can't go on loafing forever.
Or can you?

412
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,555
- It's possible.
- And what about me?

413
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,790
Am I of no importance to you at all?

414
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,791
You're of great importance
to me, Isabel.

415
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,520
- I love you. I want you to marry me.
- When, in 10 years?

416
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,352
- No, as soon as possible.
- On what?

417
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,114
- I've got $3000 a year.
- Oh, Larry.

418
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,035
- Lots of people live on a great deal less.
- I don't want to live on $3000 a year.

419
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,192
I never have,
and I don't see why I should.

420
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,591
We could go to Capri
for our honeymoon.

421
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,194
And then in the fall,
we could go to Greece.

422
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,558
Remember how we used to talk
about traveling together?

423
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,229
Of course I want to travel.

424
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,879
But not like that.

425
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,793
Cheap restaurants, third-rate hotels.

426
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,393
Besides...

427
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,676
...I want to have babies, Larry.

428
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,833
- All right, we'll take them along with us.
- Oh, Larry, you're so impractical.

429
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,514
You don't know what you're
asking me to do. I'm young.

430
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,990
I want to have fun,
do all the things people do.

431
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,037
We wouldn't have a friend
in the world.

432
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,589
Oh, Isabel, stop exaggerating.

433
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,069
We'll do everything you want.
We'll do it together.

434
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,470
Oh, listen.
If you hadn't a cent to your name...

435
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,270
...and got a job that brought you $3000
a year, I'd marry you without hesitation.

436
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,273
I'd cook for you. I'd make beds.

437
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,829
I wouldn't care what I wore.
I'd think it was fun.

438
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,878
I'd know it was only a question of time
until you'd make good.

439
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,635
But this means living like this all
our lives with nothing to look forward to.

440
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,109
It's asking too much.

441
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,356
Oh, Larry, you've had your fling now.

442
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,114
For your own sake, I beg of you
to come home with us.

443
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,840
But I wouldn't make you happy if I did.

444
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,879
You see, what you forget is that
I want to learn as passionately as...

445
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,271
...well, as Gray, for example,
wants to make a lot of money.

446
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,595
I came over here because I was restless,
and because my mind was muddled.

447
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,718
I came looking for the answers
to a lot of questions.

448
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,518
Some of them I've found.

449
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,559
Others I may never find.
But I can't stop now.

450
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,869
Oh, I know it sounds vague
and trivial compared with... .

451
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,197
Well, compared with everything
that's happening at home today.

452
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,999
And I know I'm being very difficult.

453
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,874
But I can't stop now, Isabel.
I just can't.

454
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,315
What would happen to America
if everyone did as you're doing?

455
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,278
The answer to that is that
everyone doesn't feel as I do.

456
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,512
Fortunately, most people are content
to follow the normal course...

457
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,875
...and take things as they are.

458
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,235
Oh, I wish I could too.

459
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,757
But I know if I tried, I'd just make
a mess of your life, and of mine too.

460
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,679
But...

461
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,959
...what's this all going to lead to?

462
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,038
I don't know.

463
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,520
It may be that I will find
something to give...

464
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,910
...that people will be glad to take.

465
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,431
It's just a chance. But even if I fail,
I shan't be any worse off...

466
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,797
...than a fellow who's gone into
business and hasn't made a go of it.

467
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,068
Then there's nothing more to be said.

468
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,392
Here you are.

469
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,438
Isabel.

470
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,274
Wear this on another finger, please.

471
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,876
- We're still friends.
- Of course.

472
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,437
Shall we go?

473
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,035
Well, go on, go on.

474
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,868
I don't believe it.

475
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,634
Do you realize that in the two months
you've been here...

476
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,756
...I haven't won a game?

477
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,316
- Who's winning?
- I am.

478
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,993
Good.

479
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,193
Well, I must say, Isabel's taking it very
well. Has she told you what happened?

480
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,636
Only that she and Larry came to
the conclusion they'd made a mistake.

481
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,634
- Has she written to Gray?
- I'm not in the habit of opening her mail.

482
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,509
If you ask me, she's very well out of it.
There was a physical attraction...

483
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,511
...but that's all...
- Here she is.

484
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,717
- Good night, Mother.
- Don't be too late.

485
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,718
Remember we have to catch
the boat train in the morning.

486
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,791
You're very dressed up.

487
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,951
- You seem to be going somewhere.
- Yes.

488
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,792
- Where?
- Oh, nowhere in particular.

489
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,952
- Larry and I are going out on the town.
- Larry?

490
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,190
We thought we'd spend
our last night together.

491
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,715
"Evening," I trust you mean.

492
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,233
I'm profoundly shocked.

493
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,675
If he had any decency,
he'd never have asked you.

494
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,752
But he didn't ask me. I asked him.

495
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,230
- You should forbid her to go.
- Will you pay any attention to me if I do?

496
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,992
- No, darling, none.
- In that case...

497
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,674
...I don't think there's any point
in my forbidding it.

498
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,470
Pretty dress she had on.

499
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,037
I hadn't realized
it was cut quite so low.

500
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,200
I've never seen you so beautiful.

501
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,115
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

502
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,513
Will you come in
and have one last drink?

503
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,872
Yes.

504
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,995
It's late. You'd better go.

505
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,394
Oh, Larry, for heaven's sakes, go!

506
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,397
Please, Larry.

507
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,072
Larry.

508
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,037
Uncle Elliott.

509
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,554
That was a brilliant performance,
my dear.

510
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,797
I left the door just a little open.

511
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,553
Shall I get you a drink?
I expect you want it.

512
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,272
You think you're very clever,
don't you?

513
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,268
I don't think it, I know it.

514
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,756
Come, come, child, be reasonable.

515
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,916
I guessed you were up to something.

516
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,350
Even your mother noticed
the pains you went to...

517
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,994
...to make yourself alluring tonight.

518
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,237
You're hateful.

519
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,230
But no fool, my angel.

520
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,675
Am I right that you thought if you
could get him to come back here...

521
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,719
...it was almost inevitable
that the inevitable should happen?

522
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,078
No one could put it more delicately.

523
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,440
We know what the consequences
may be when a poor girl...

524
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,676
...strays from the narrow path
of virtue.

525
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,154
Do we?

526
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,158
My guess is that if your
unscrupulous plan had come off...

527
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,239
...it wouldn't have been long
before Larry got a letter from you...

528
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,716
...telling him to come back at once
and make an honest woman of you.

529
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,388
You can be wonderfully disagreeable
when you like.

530
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,717
I know, it's one
of my most cherished gifts.

531
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,430
Why didn't you go through with it?

532
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,879
When I looked into his eyes...

533
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,072
...and saw he hadn't the slightest idea
I'd set a trap for him...

534
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,953
...I couldn't bring myself
to play such a dirty trick.

535
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,515
I couldn't help myself.

536
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,631
I suppose it was my better nature.

537
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,838
Nonsense. It was your sound
Middle Western horse sense.

538
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,600
You'd have been mad
to have married him.

539
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,631
I wonder.

540
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,039
Believe me,
when you've put the Atlantic...

541
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,392
...between you and that young man,
you won't care two straws for him.

542
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,670
Trust your Uncle Elliott.

543
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,599
He's a very wise old party.

544
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,198
Mr. Maturin, the cake.

545
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,116
Here's a knife, Miss Isabel.
I mean, Mrs. Maturin.

546
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,039
- What do I do with it?
- Gray, you get in. You're in on this.

547
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,596
- I told you what to do. Take her hand.
- Nothing would please me more.

548
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,234
Darling, this is the nicest wedding
I've ever been to.

549
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,000
- We shoulďve thought of this sooner.
- Uncle Elliott...

550
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,590
...how do brides cut cakes in France?
- With a knife, dear.

551
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,473
- Now make a wish, Gray.
- I don't have to.

552
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,631
I've got my wish.

553
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,436
I've never understood why, when
there's so much space in the world...

554
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,837
...people should deliberately choose
to live in the Middle West.

555
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,390
What in heaven's name is this?

556
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,113
Is it alone?

557
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,271
Doesn't it come with something?
What is it?

558
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,796
- It could be a pickle fork.
- A pickle fork.

559
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,150
Two ninety-eight, no doubt,
at Ye Gifte Shoppe.

560
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,193
Four fifty, Mr. Templeton,
at Obendorfer's.

561
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,598
- We know, because we sent it.
- Charming. Is it for use or ornament?

562
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,074
Both.

563
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,589
Remember me? We met
the last time I was in Chicago.

564
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,711
- I certainly do, Mr. Maugham.
- Hello, sir.

565
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,478
Sophie.

566
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,514
Oh, darling, how sweet of you
and Bob to come.

567
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,312
Let me see you.

568
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,670
- Oh, you look beautiful, Isabel.
- Think so?

569
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,190
Like a million dollars.
Or should I say 20 million?

570
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,311
Darling, we never see you
and Bob anymore.

571
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,873
Where do you hide yourselves?

572
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,594
Just at present, for reasons
best known to ourselves...

573
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,314
...we don't mix with the rich.
- We find it expensive.

574
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,158
- How's the kid, Bob?
- Fine.

575
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,715
- Would you like...?
- Oh, please, darling, not now.

576
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,115
I'd love to come see you.
Where do you live now?

577
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,151
In a walk-up apartment
on the North Side.

578
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,557
I'd ask you to dinner, only I'm afraid
you won't care for my cooking.

579
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,553
Don't you believe her.
She's the best darn cook in Chicago.

580
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,796
All's well that ends well.

581
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,639
And I must say, they make
a very attractive couple.

582
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,354
Oh, no.

583
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,120
- I hope they'll be happy.
- Why shouldn't they be happy?

584
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,276
They have everything
to make them happy.

585
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,234
Money, position, a nice house.
And Gray's father can't live forever.

586
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,351
What about Larry?
Heard anything about him?

587
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,269
Good heavens, no. As soon
as Isabel and Louisa went away...

588
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,035
...I dropped him like a hot potato.
A most undesirable young man.

589
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,516
I tried to find him the last time
I was in Paris, but I couldn't.

590
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,352
I wonder what's happened to him.

591
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,835
Shall I tell you something,
my dear fellow?

592
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,952
I don't care a row of beans.

593
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,235
- Hey, Kosti.
- How about a beer?

594
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,709
- Well, I would like to wash up first.
- Oh, come on.

595
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,957
It's good, clean dirt.
You can wash later.

596
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,716
A couple of beers, sweetheart.
And a deck of cards.

597
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,635
I looked for you last night.
You were out.

598
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,637
Was she pretty?

599
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,798
You're wrong. I went
to a lecture at the university.

600
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,991
Missed the bus.
I walked back in the rain.

601
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,553
- It serves you right.
- Why?

602
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,234
Enlightenment is a curse
of civilization.

603
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,989
A man who wastes his energy
on knowledge is a fool.

604
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,476
The more he learns, the more he wants,
and the more unhappy he becomes.

605
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,639
Tear down the schoolhouses,
burn the books, strangle the teachers.

606
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,752
Then the world can get somewhere.

607
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,917
The beer.

608
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,316
And the cards.

609
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,235
We'll play for the drinks.

610
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,117
Why should a man who wants to
develop his brain work in a coalmine?

611
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,756
Answer me that. You could have
gotten a soft job on the surface.

612
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,110
I wanted to work below.

613
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,438
Hiding out, are you?

614
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,959
- Police after you?
- No.

615
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,832
- A woman?
- No, I just thought...

616
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,235
...it'd do me good
to work up a sweat.

617
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,749
What have the other Poles
told you about me?

618
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,317
Not much. They advised me not to play
cards with you because you cheat.

619
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,479
- Do you think it's true?
- Yes. I know it is.

620
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,716
Then why do you play with me?

621
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,512
For the fun of it.

622
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,870
I've been watching.
I can't see how it's done.

623
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,513
You never will, my boy.

624
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,917
I shouldn't have thought it worth
your while just for a few drinks.

625
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,712
I like to keep my hand in.

626
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,639
What are you going to do
when you get enough of this?

627
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,115
Go back to America?

628
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,278
I will, I suppose, one of these days.

629
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,040
- And do what?
- Sell bonds.

630
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,755
You're a rum one, Larry.

631
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,236
But what about the answers
to all those profound questions...

632
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,078
...you have been asking yourself?

633
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,317
Don't you know people have been
asking the same questions...

634
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,511
...for thousands of years?

635
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,432
Doesn't the fact that people have
asked those same questions...

636
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,871
...for thousands of years only go
to prove that they can't help asking?

637
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,072
Very good. Very good.

638
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,759
You're not altogether stupid.

639
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,679
As a matter of fact, you sound
like a very religious man...

640
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,075
...who doesn't believe in God.

641
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,439
I'm not sure that I believe in anything.

642
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,194
Have you ever thought
of going to the East?

643
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,038
No.

644
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,310
India, for instance?

645
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,069
I went there. I met a strange man.

646
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,714
A man I never thought
to meet in this world.

647
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,319
A saint.

648
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,512
People go from all parts of India
to see him...

649
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,508
...tell him their problems, ask
his advice and listen to his teaching.

650
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,269
And they go away strengthened
in soul and at peace.

651
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,756
But it's not his teaching
that's so remarkable.

652
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,478
It's the man himself.

653
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,877
- Did he help you?
- No. No.

654
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,709
But that wasn't his fault.
It was mine.

655
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,279
How did you ever come
to go to India?

656
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,953
To escape my pursuer.
He followed me there.

657
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,835
I've wallowed in the gutters
of half the seaports of Europe...

658
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,669
...to put him off my track.
He was waiting for me.

659
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,994
I know however far I flee,
one day he will come up with me...

660
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,317
...and I shall feel the terrible hand...

661
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,996
...on my shoulder.

662
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,510
Wouldn't it be better
to take your punishment?

663
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,438
You don't know
what the punishment is.

664
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,595
It's not prison or the hangman's rope.
I could face that.

665
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,756
It's mercy...

666
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,349
...forgiveness, love.

667
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:50,115
Didn't anybody ever tell you
that I'm a unfrocked priest?

668
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,391
It's not the police
I'm running away from.

669
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,388
I'd kill anyone who tried to arrest me.

670
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,151
It's God.

671
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,197
Get out, you fool!
I'm going to get drunk.

672
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,032
Sorry we were interrupted.
They're pilgrims.

673
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,360
They come from many places,
some from quite far distances.

674
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,270
What has brought you here, my son?

675
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,390
I've come to learn.

676
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,829
Ever since the war,
I've been searching for something.

677
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,828
Something that I've not been able
to put into words.

678
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,957
I've been told that from you
I might find guidance.

679
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,355
God is the only guide.

680
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,269
But perhaps if we talk,
he may show me a way to help you.

681
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,595
To my friends, I'm a loafer,
afraid of responsibilities.

682
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,236
I can't even make those I love
understand what I'm after.

683
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,238
The fact you've taken the time
to come this great distance...

684
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,479
...in search of knowledge proves that
you're not afraid of responsibilities.

685
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:35,312
Even to admit that you want to learn
is in itself courageous.

686
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,839
I've studied, I've traveled, I've read
everything I could get my hands on...

687
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,793
...and nothing seems to satisfy me.

688
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,510
Oh, like everyone else, I want
to succeed, I want to improve...

689
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,918
...but not necessarily in the terms
of what the world calls success.

690
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,552
Somehow I've lost confidence
in the accepted values.

691
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,800
I try to get excited at the prospect
of settling down...

692
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,110
...minding my own business
and making good...

693
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,716
...but it only increases my urge
to move on.

694
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,392
I know that if I do find
what I'm looking for...

695
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,637
...it will be something
that I can share with others.

696
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,116
But how to find it, and where?

697
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,551
All your restlessness and confusion
are not unique, my son.

698
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,433
The whole world is restless
and confused.

699
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,875
It will always be so, as long as men
set their ideals on the wrong objects.

700
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,430
There can be no real happiness...

701
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,679
...until men learn that it comes
from within themselves.

702
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,632
I know.

703
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,550
It is written that the wise man
lives from within himself...

704
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,639
...which is from God,
from within his own heart.

705
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,719
This is the way of calmness,
forbearance...

706
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,799
...compassion, selflessness...

707
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,475
...and everlasting peace.

708
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,359
- But that's not easy.
- No.

709
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,038
The road to salvation
is difficult to pass over.

710
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,631
As difficult as the sharp edge
of a razor.

711
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,637
But this much we know...

712
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,308
...and all religions teach it.

713
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,836
There is in every one of us
a spark of the infinite goodness...

714
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,672
...which created us.

715
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,599
And when we leave this earth,
we are reunited with it...

716
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,268
...as a raindrop falling from heaven...

717
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,712
...is at last reunited with the sea
which gave it birth.

718
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,875
- May I stay here with you?
- Of course you may.

719
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,197
Our life's very simple.
There are books.

720
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,311
We will talk together.

721
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,637
You can even work in the fields
if you wish.

722
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,676
We Indians believe there are
three roads that lead to God.

723
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,269
One is the path of faith and worship.

724
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,711
One is the path of good works
performed for the love of God.

725
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,710
And then there is a third path, which
leads through knowledge to wisdom.

726
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,395
You have chosen
the way of knowledge.

727
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,556
But you will find in the end, my son...

728
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,072
...that the three paths
are but one path.

729
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,592
One of my students
will show you where to sleep.

730
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,512
Thank you.

731
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,515
- Excuse me, please.
- Yes, sir.

732
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,914
Operator?

733
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,680
Michigan 7182.

734
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,553
I wanna get Mr. Gray Maturin.

735
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,638
- Is Dr. Thompson in there?
- Yes, he is.

736
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,429
We'll hold the hypo for now.
She's doing all right.

737
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,437
You're wanted, doctor.

738
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,718
I'm Gray Maturin, doctor.
They sent for me.

739
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,878
- How is she?
- She's conscious now.

740
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,196
She asked about her husband.
Will you tell her?

741
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,277
Tell her? Doesn't she know?

742
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,914
She should be told before
a possible shock reaction.

743
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,718
You're an old friend.

744
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,758
Hello, Gray.
It was nice of you to come.

745
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,474
I got here as quickly as I could.

746
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,191
It was such a silly thing to happen.

747
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,836
A bunch of drunks.
They ran into us at an intersection.

748
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,076
We might all have been killed.

749
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,511
It was lucky I was holding
the baby in my arms.

750
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,594
Is the car badly damaged?
Where's Bob?

751
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,310
Careful of her arm.

752
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,277
Where's Bob?

753
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,914
I want Bob. Bob?

754
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,877
You have to stay in bed,
Mrs. MacDonald.

755
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,640
- Take it easy, Sophie.
- No. I've got to see Bob.

756
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,149
- And baby. Baby, baby.
- Don't let her get up.

757
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,430
- I'll get the doctor.
- Sophie, lie down.

758
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,235
- Leave me alone, you swine!
- Please. Please, Sophie.

759
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,355
Is Bob dead, Gray?

760
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,037
Is he dead?

761
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,589
You can tell me, Gray.

762
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,398
Yes.

763
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,359
And...

764
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,231
...baby too?

765
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,871
Linda.

766
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,040
Linda!

767
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,515
Baby.

768
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,798
Hypo.

769
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,476
Linda. Wake up, baby.

770
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,912
Wake up, baby, wake up.

771
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,910
Well, are you ready to start
on your pilgrimage?

772
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,399
Yes.

773
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,909
But I'll miss it here.
I've been very happy.

774
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,795
We'll miss you too. But you've
got all you can get from books.

775
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,673
It's time for you to put the world
behind you for a while.

776
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,115
To isolate yourself completely...

777
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,191
...from everything.

778
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,997
Sometimes very strange things
happen when you're in the mountains.

779
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,397
Not a living soul within miles of you.

780
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,279
Nothing above you but the sky...

781
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,232
...and God.

782
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,911
What sort of things?

783
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,834
That, my son, depends on you.

784
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,714
You'll find a little shelter up there
at the very top.

785
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,791
Go in. Make yourself at home.

786
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,437
After you've been there some time,
perhaps I shall pay you a visit.

787
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,517
You've come.

788
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,756
Let me look at you.

789
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,078
Yes, I see.

790
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,272
You were right.

791
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,796
Something very strange
did happen to me.

792
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,672
I know.

793
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,632
Tell me.

794
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,672
It was just at that moment
before night ends and day begins...

795
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,395
...when the whole world
seems to tremble in the balance.

796
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,834
Gradually the light began
to filter through the darkness...

797
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,555
...like some mysterious figure
stealing through the trees.

798
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,472
And then the first rays
of the sun came up.

799
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:53,438
The mountains,
the mist caught in the treetops... .

800
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,913
I'd never before felt
or seen anything like it.

801
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,949
I know. I come here often.

802
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,435
I felt that I'd been released
from my body.

803
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,234
That I was suspended in midair.

804
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,990
That all the things
that had been confused before...

805
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,874
...suddenly became clear to me.

806
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,916
I had a sense of knowledge
more than human.

807
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,590
I felt that I'd broken away
and was free.

808
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,757
I felt that if it lasted
another minute, l...

809
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,751
I'd die.

810
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,109
And yet I was willing to die
if I could just hold onto it...

811
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,834
...because for that one moment...

812
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,554
...I had the feeling that... .

813
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,037
That you and God were one.

814
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,517
Yes.

815
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,434
I'm sure I could stay here forever
and never tire of it.

816
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,397
No. You must go back.

817
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,353
You are now ready to go back.

818
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,354
It's not necessary
to leave the world, my son...

819
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,109
...but rather to live in the world
and to love the objects of the world...

820
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:13,996
...not for themselves alone,
but for what there is in them of God.

821
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,953
Your place is with your own people.

822
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,709
You, my son,
are one of the fortunate ones.

823
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,959
By the grace of God, it's been given you
to see the infinite beauty of the world...

824
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,038
...which is only the reflection
seen through a glass darkly...

825
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,713
...of the beauty of God.

826
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,476
That sense of joy...

827
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,989
...that vision of his beauty...

828
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:39,593
...will remain with you, fresh and vivid,
till the day of your death.

829
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,237
This crest is not in the proper place
at all.

830
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,389
The crest belongs up here.
Up here.

831
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,120
I'm not running in the Olympic Games,
you know.

832
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,874
It'll all have to be done over
immediately.

833
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,874
Now, about this robe. It's really dreadful.
Dreadful.

834
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,998
And look at this tassel. Hideous.

835
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,674
It should strike me here, at the knees,
lower, lower...

836
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,990
...so that when I walk, it'll sway.

837
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,277
As it is now, it just bobbles.
Where are my ties?

838
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,757
It isn't.

839
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,753
By Jove, it is.

840
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,714
- My dear fellow.
- Elliott.

841
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,314
- Where have you been all these years?
- In the Orient.

842
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,550
The last time I passed through
you were away.

843
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,951
Come in, come in.
I have a house on the Riviera now.

844
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,350
I've reached an age
when I'm prepared to relax...

845
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,637
...and enjoy the beauties of nature.
- You surprise me, Elliott.

846
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,872
You always looked on nature as
an impediment to social intercourse.

847
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,439
Paris is not what it was.

848
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,830
There's practically nobody to know
here anymore.

849
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,076
But on the Riviera,
there's some nice people.

850
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,028
In fact, the shores of the Mediterranean
are simply littered with royalties.

851
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,556
Heavens knows I'm not a snob,
but just as a matter of interest...

852
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,840
...I don't mind telling you that on one
occasion I had two ex-kings to lunch.

853
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,319
Two.

854
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,198
How nice.

855
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,192
Elliott, what the devil is that crown
doing over your initials?

856
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,876
His Holiness has been graciously pleased
to revive in my favor my old family title.

857
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:31,077
- Your what?
- Oh, didn't you know?

858
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,277
I'm descended in the female line
from the Count de Lauria...

859
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:38,558
...who came to England with Philip II and
married a maid of honor to Queen Mary.

860
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,597
As an American citizen, I feel it
more modest not to use my title...

861
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,876
...except on all my personal linen.

862
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,157
I think that's a very pretty gesture
on your part, Elliott.

863
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,153
I take a modest pride
in concealing my rank...

864
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,756
...under the sober pinstripe
of an American gentleman.

865
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,670
You know that Isabel and Gray Maturin
are here with their two children.

866
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,832
Are they? I didn't know.
I've only just arrived in Paris.

867
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,430
- They were wiped out in the crash.
- Yes, I heard that.

868
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,110
Poor Isabel even had to sell
her jewels.

869
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,317
Gray tried to get a job, but it appears
there was no business.

870
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,232
The result was a nervous breakdown.

871
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,153
And he suffers from
the most frightful headaches.

872
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,470
He couldn't take a job now
if he could get one.

873
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,914
Oh, I am so sorry.

874
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,719
I couldn't let them live like pigs,
Isabel with no maid...

875
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,598
...and no governess for the children.

876
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,793
So I've lent them my apartment
until Gray is back on his feet.

877
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,554
You're the most generous creature
in the world.

878
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,792
Nonsense. If I'm taking care of them,
it's because...

879
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,916
...well, noblesse oblige, you know.

880
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,799
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- What about having lunch with me?

881
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,748
- I'm expecting an old friend of yours.
- I wasn't aware I had old friends in Paris.

882
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,912
And even if I have, nothing would give
me less pleasure...

883
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,390
...than to meet them at this time.
- Jump in. We're meeting at the Dome.

884
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,755
I dislike being hustled.

885
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,437
To the Dome.

886
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,070
And what about you?
Were you hurt in the crash?

887
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,515
God tempers the wind
to the shorn lamb.

888
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,636
I happened to be in Rome
in September '29.

889
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,758
My friends strongly advised me to sell
my American securities.

890
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,070
I very sensibly took their advice.

891
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,356
So when the crash came
you were sitting pretty.

892
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,318
An Americanism, which I see
no occasion for you to use...

893
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,109
...but it expresses my situation
with a good deal of accuracy.

894
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,271
In fact, I was inspired to sell short...

895
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,079
...and made what you would probably
call a killing.

896
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:37,119
- You're a downy old bird, Elliott.
- I have a flair.

897
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,677
I do not like the propinquity
of the hoi polloi.

898
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,278
- Oh, hello.
- Larry.

899
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:55,069
- Larry? I thought you were dead.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

900
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,879
- Where have you sprung from?
- India.

901
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,314
India.

902
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,030
If you will excuse me,
I will now leave you.

903
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,111
I find I have an engagement.

904
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,872
- Goodbye, my dear fellow.
- Goodbye.

905
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,634
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

906
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,230
- Did you know Isabel and Gray are here?
- Really? Where are they staying?

907
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,470
In Elliot's apartment
with their children.

908
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,959
I must look them up.

909
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,998
If you don't want to drive their
two girls into hysterics...

910
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,357
...you'd better get a haircut.
- That'd be a good idea anyway.

911
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,910
They've had a bad time. The Maturin
Company was wiped out in the crash.

912
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,116
Gray had a nervous breakdown.

913
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:51,477
Poor Gray. Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

914
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,235
What did you do in India?

915
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,675
I learned something about myself.

916
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,230
I was very happy there.

917
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,952
- Mr. Maugham, sir.
- Yes, I know.

918
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,439
- Hello, Mr. Maugham.
- Hello.

919
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,511
Isabel said she talked to you
on the phone.

920
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,432
Tell Mrs. Maturin
Mr. Maugham's here.

921
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,795
I'm sorry to hear
you've been under the weather.

922
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,430
It's one of those things that comes
and goes. I can't get rid of it.

923
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,319
I thought if I came here
the change might do me good.

924
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,072
Hello.

925
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,355
- Mr. Maugham.
- Isabel.

926
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,590
This is a pleasure.
How are the children?

927
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,479
Oh, wonderful.
Growing by leaps and bounds.

928
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,110
- How is it now, dear?
- Oh, I'm all right.

929
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,590
If you'll excuse me, I always feel
such a nuisance when I'm like this.

930
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,910
Do you want anything, dear?

931
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,635
- No.
- Sure?

932
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,789
- Poor boy.
- What a pity. I was hoping you two...

933
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,794
...would dine with me tonight.
- Oh, I'd love to. But he really suffers.

934
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,319
You look very well, Mr. Maugham.

935
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,391
I am very well.

936
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,356
Larry hasn't arrived yet?

937
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,439
Larry?

938
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,036
Yes, he lunched with me today. He said
he'd drop in on you this afternoon.

939
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,555
Larry in Paris? Where has he been?

940
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,758
- India.
- But I didn't know.

941
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,990
I didn't know he'd been in India.

942
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,715
Do you realize I haven't laid eyes
on him for years?

943
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,194
Did you tell him we'd lost
all our money?

944
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,035
It's funny when you think of it,
that we have...

945
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,034
...almost exactly the income that Larry
had when he wanted me to marry him.

946
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,119
And I wouldn't, because
we couldn't possibly live on it.

947
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,478
And now I have two children besides.

948
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,072
I don't think you're so terribly
to be pitied.

949
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,711
Excuse me.

950
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,837
Mr. Darrell.

951
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,398
Isabel.

952
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,353
Larry.

953
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,670
Hello, Isabel.

954
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,872
Larry.

955
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,470
Oh, Larry, I can't believe it.

956
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,200
- Where did they go?
- Who?

957
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:43,549
Oh, the brood. Come on, babies.
Come on, darling. Come back.

958
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,469
- Oh, come here. What's your name?
- Joan.

959
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,029
- Joan. And how old are you?
- Seven.

960
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,599
Seven.

961
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,951
This is Priscilla.

962
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,916
Seven. It has been a long time.

963
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,273
Yes. A long time.

964
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,471
- It's a lovely brood. Where's Gray?
- In the library.

965
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,631
Run along, darlings.

966
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,713
- Hello, Larry.
- Hello.

967
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,711
Come in and see Gray.

968
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,510
Gray, look who's here.

969
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,713
- Hello, Gray. Don't get up.
- Larry. I am glad to see you.

970
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,552
Sorry you caught me like this.

971
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,438
- Blinding headache.
- Yes.

972
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,068
Mr. Maugham wants to take us
all out this evening.

973
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,913
I thought we'd dine and do the town.
Do you feel up to it?

974
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,595
Well, that's very nice of you,
Mr. Maugham, but I'm afraid not.

975
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,554
- Larry'll go, won't you, Larry?
- Oh, poor Gray.

976
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,109
Sail on, all of you.
Don't let me spoil your evening.

977
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:52,068
Wait a minute. Would you let me see
if I can help you?

978
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,108
- How?
- I mean, I... .

979
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,999
I might be able to help you
help yourself.

980
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,073
All right.

981
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,708
Here, sit down.

982
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,348
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.

983
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,916
What's this?

984
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,237
It's an old coin from India.

985
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,958
Here.

986
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,035
Close your fingers tightly on this,
palm downward.

987
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,478
Now don't fight me.
Don't make any effort.

988
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,438
Just squeeze the coin
with your closed fist.

989
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,311
Before I count 10...

990
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,278
...your hand will open,
and the coin will drop out of it.

991
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,913
One, two...

992
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,753
...three, four...

993
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,072
...five, six...

994
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,471
...seven...

995
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,399
...eight, nine... .

996
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,674
I didn't let that coin drop.
It fell out of itself.

997
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,072
It's not important.

998
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,674
I just thought it might give you
confidence in me.

999
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,637
Why?

1000
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,154
You'll see. Here.

1001
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,992
Got it?

1002
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,109
- Excuse me. Here.
- What do you want me to do?

1003
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,319
Come back in the corner and sit right
against those cushions. Get comfortable.

1004
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,597
- Are you comfortable?
- I think so.

1005
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,069
- Have you got a watch?
- Yes.

1006
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,229
Palm downward.

1007
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,311
Thank you.

1008
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,755
Six forty-three.

1009
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,633
In 60 seconds, your eyelids
will grow heavy...

1010
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,553
...so heavy that you will be
obliged to close them.

1011
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,995
Then you will sleep for another minute.

1012
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,989
At 6:45, you will wake up...

1013
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,515
...and you will have no more pain.

1014
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,395
No more pain.

1015
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,151
Believe it or not, he's falling asleep.

1016
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,392
- You learned that in India.
- There's nothing miraculous about it.

1017
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,950
I merely put an idea into his head.
He's doing the rest himself.

1018
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,233
I did doze off.

1019
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,197
Is your head better?

1020
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,352
I don't know. Could be.

1021
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,391
- You did something. What did you do?
- I didn't do it. You did it yourself.

1022
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,835
- Did I?
- Of course.

1023
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,436
A moment ago, my head was splitting
wide open, from here to here.

1024
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,909
- How is it now?
- Well, it's certainly better.

1025
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,638
Could you cure him permanently?

1026
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,997
I can't do miracles, but there's no reason
why he can't cure himself.

1027
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:23,789
- But that was a miracle. I saw it.
- Well, whatever it was, it sure helped.

1028
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,713
- Enough to come to dinner with us?
- Sure, I'd like to come.

1029
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,996
- I haven't eaten all day.
- You'll come, Larry.

1030
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,993
I'd love to. You know, I haven't danced
with you for years.

1031
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:36,836
- I'd like to find out if I still know how.
- We'll see. I'll go get my things.

1032
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:40,948
Oh, would you like a drink,
Mr. Maugham? Larry?

1033
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,076
Everything's here.

1034
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,833
Oh, hello. How is your friend,
Elliott Templeton?

1035
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,116
Pretty well, I think.

1036
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,439
- Who was that?
- The Princess Novemali.

1037
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,873
Edna.

1038
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,153
Funny fellow, that Larry.

1039
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,029
He doesn't look a day older than he did
when he left all those years ago.

1040
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,430
India changed him.

1041
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,592
- Changed him?
- He looks extraordinarily happy to me.

1042
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,957
Calm, yet strangely aloof.

1043
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,554
- Excuse me. Do you have a match?
- Oh, here.

1044
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,029
- Did you get the car?
- Not yet.

1045
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,313
Thanks.

1046
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,995
- Does he dance as well as ever?
- I didn't notice.

1047
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,956
You aren't going to be so silly as
to fall in love with him again, are you?

1048
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:00,557
I've never stopped loving him.
I've never loved anyone else in my life.

1049
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,192
Marriage is a pretty difficult job,
even when one's in love.

1050
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,555
I shouldn't have thought it fun
when one is not.

1051
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,149
One can get on all right without love.

1052
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,868
Gray's such a good fellow.
Be a pity to hurt him.

1053
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:19,715
I'll never do anything to hurt him.
I'm too fond of him for that.

1054
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,235
Well, it's your business, not mine.

1055
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,551
Where to now?
How about Les Ambassadeurs?

1056
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,792
Oh, no, I'm sick of all these
smart places.

1057
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,192
Well?

1058
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,114
How about the rue de Lappe?
I've never been there.

1059
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,679
At least it will be different.

1060
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,071
- The rue de Lappe in those clothes?
- Nonsense. I can keep my jacket on.

1061
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,959
- Please. It'll be fun.
- Don't blame us if you don't like it.

1062
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,192
Pull down the blinds if you don't want
a bottle through the window.

1063
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,999
You asked for it, Isabel. Here it is.

1064
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,954
I'm not scared. I like it.

1065
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,837
Oh, look at that.

1066
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,754
The police will probably choose now
to raid the place.

1067
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,115
I should be thrilled to the marrow.

1068
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:34,432
- Any champagne in Paris is all right.
- Well, I don't...

1069
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:41,509
- Well, well, look who's here.
- Sophie.

1070
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,797
Who'd you think it was?

1071
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,872
Sit down. Sit down, all of you.

1072
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,238
Hello, Gray. Sit down.

1073
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,958
I'll get you a chair, Sophie.

1074
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,758
Fancy meeting you all like this.

1075
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,477
- Hello, Larry.
- Hi, brown eyes.

1076
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,752
How are you?

1077
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,797
Thirsty.

1078
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,750
Come on, let's all have a drink.

1079
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,314
Do I know them?
They're my childhood friends.

1080
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,355
Who says I'm drunk?

1081
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,031
I know you.

1082
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,350
You came to Chicago.

1083
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,708
- Bit of a stuffed shirt, aren't you?
- Maybe.

1084
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,393
I can't say you seem
so terribly pleased to see me.

1085
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,278
I heard you were in Paris, Sophie.

1086
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,351
You might've called.
I'm in the phone book.

1087
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,954
- Are you?
- Yes.

1088
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,160
Having a good time over here, Sophie?

1089
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,436
Fine.

1090
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,879
You went bust, didn't you, Gray?

1091
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,915
Tough on you.

1092
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,110
I guess it must be pretty grim
in Chicago right now.

1093
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,078
Lucky for me I got out when I did.

1094
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,317
Where are those drinks?

1095
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,992
Here they are, Sophie.

1096
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,676
Here you are, Sophie.

1097
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,835
My loving in-laws kicked me out
of Chicago.

1098
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,673
Said I was gumming up
their reputation.

1099
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,791
Look out, Coco. He's the quiet type.
He'll lay you out cold.

1100
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:18,435
- Is that a friend of yours, Sophie?
- Yes, that's a friend of mine, Isabel.

1101
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:32,319
- You living in Paris now, Larry?
- Yes, I am, Sophie.

1102
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,951
You remember the summer
before the war?

1103
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,394
Sure.

1104
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,870
- We saw a lot of each other then.
- When?

1105
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:43,080
When you and your mother
were being social.

1106
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:47,275
We used to read poetry together.
Remember, Larry?

1107
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,558
You used to write some poetry
yourself in those days.

1108
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,314
Pretty good too, wasn't it?

1109
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,673
Not bad for a kid.

1110
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,156
It was good.

1111
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,320
Well, I'd better get back
to my boyfriend...

1112
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,630
...or he'll raise the roof.

1113
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,955
He's a sulky brute.
But quite a man.

1114
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,034
Come and see me
when you've nothing better to do.

1115
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,829
I've got a case of Scotch.

1116
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,276
So long, folks.

1117
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,237
Come again.

1118
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,751
I'm here every night.

1119
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,716
I'm afraid that was not
a great success.

1120
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,714
Some shock to see Sophie.
Boy, was she tight.

1121
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,475
- Lf not worse.
- That's funny. I got the same impression.

1122
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:25,359
- Do you remember her at all?
- Very well. I liked her.

1123
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,192
I remember her husband.

1124
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,669
You never saw two people
so crazy about each other.

1125
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,990
They got to be a regular joke
around Chicago.

1126
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,230
- But what happened?
- Didn't you know?

1127
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,909
Bob and the baby were killed.

1128
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,758
A car hit them.

1129
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,238
- Oh, so that's what it is.
- She nearly went crazy.

1130
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,595
We did all we could to help,
but it was no good.

1131
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,673
If you asked her to dinner,
she'd come in plastered and pass out.

1132
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,189
- We simply had to drop her.
- She became impossible.

1133
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,954
Of course, it was a shock.
I was terribly sorry for her.

1134
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,599
But a normal person recovers.

1135
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,228
If she went to pieces, it was because
she was always unbalanced.

1136
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,551
Even her love for Bob was exaggerated.
Aren't I right, Larry?

1137
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,755
No, I don't agree with you, Isabel.

1138
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,798
She was as normal as any person
I've ever known.

1139
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,473
But remember, I knew her better
than you did.

1140
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:21,190
- Was she in love with you?
- Good heavens, no.

1141
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,591
She was only a kid.

1142
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,149
Just a skinny little girl
with a bow in her hair.

1143
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:32,350
I remember her crying once
when I was reading an ode of Keats'...

1144
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,198
...because it was so beautiful.

1145
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,319
Girls of that age are very emotional.

1146
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,794
Oh, there was a lot to her
in those days.

1147
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,237
She had what Keats probably
would have called...

1148
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,595
...a sort of lovely purity.

1149
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,270
Chauffeur, would you stop
at the next corner.

1150
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:06,433
- You're not going to run out on us.
- Well, my hotel's only a step from here.

1151
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,268
- Good night.
- Larry, will we see you?

1152
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,675
- Yes.
- We're going to Vittel on Thursday...

1153
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,956
...with Elliott.
He wants to take the cure.

1154
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,315
We'll be back by the first.
I'll call you.

1155
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,432
Fine. Well, good night.

1156
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,431
- Good night, Gray.
- Good night, Larry.

1157
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,318
And thanks for the dinner.

1158
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,714
- Hello?
- Larry.

1159
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:19,873
At last. I've been trying to reach you
for hours. Aren't you ever in?

1160
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,079
Well, hardly ever.
When did you get back?

1161
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,395
This morning.

1162
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,836
Uncle Elliott insisted on being here
in time for Elsa's soiree tonight.

1163
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,754
Poor dear. He's not at all well,
but he will go to all these parties.

1164
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,033
How's Gray getting along?

1165
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,118
Oh, Larry, you've simply done
wonders for him.

1166
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:41,512
He's started to play golf again.
He blames it all on you.

1167
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:42,999
And what have you been doing?

1168
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,791
Oh, one thing and another.
I've seen a lot of Sophie.

1169
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,553
Really? Why?

1170
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,198
Well, after all, she's an old friend.

1171
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,039
If you want my opinion,
I think you're wasting your time.

1172
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,390
She stopped drinking.

1173
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,279
Larry, you're the most gullible person
I've ever known.

1174
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,192
She'll never stop drinking.

1175
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,635
Sophie wallows in the gutter
because she likes it.

1176
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,631
A blind person could see that.

1177
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,877
Well, just the same, I do wish
you'd be nice to her, Isabel.

1178
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,473
We're going to be married.

1179
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,077
What?

1180
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,354
Married?

1181
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,756
Yes, that's right. It's all settled.

1182
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,078
Well, you're not serious. You can't be.

1183
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,191
But I am.

1184
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,190
Well, aren't you going
to congratulate me?

1185
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:33,388
I am not. I think you're... You're...

1186
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:52,111
- What's kept you? You've been hours.
- I came the instant I got your call.

1187
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,748
- What's happened?
- It's about Larry and Sophie.

1188
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,878
The idiot. The stupid, blind idiot.
He must be mad.

1189
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:01,112
If you'd calm down, I might be able
to make out what you're saying.

1190
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,555
He's going to marry her.

1191
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:08,797
- How do you know?
- He just called me on the phone.

1192
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,632
- Oh, I'm frantic.
- So I see.

1193
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,155
He had the effrontery to ask me
to be nice to her.

1194
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,357
- Well, it's his own affair, isn't it?
- She's an awful woman.

1195
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,557
She's bad, bad, bad!

1196
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,873
She's soused from morning
till night.

1197
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,312
That doesn't mean she's bad.

1198
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:30,155
Quite a number of respectable citizens
get drunk and do silly things.

1199
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:34,029
They're bad habits, but I don't know
if they're worse than that.

1200
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,875
I call a person bad who lies and cheats
and is unkind.

1201
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,270
If you're going to take her part,
I'll kill you.

1202
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:43,398
- I'd prefer if you'd give me a cup of tea.
- Oh, help yourself.

1203
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,994
He's seen a lot of her since we were
at that dive.

1204
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:50,073
He says she's quit drinking.
The fool thinks he's cured her.

1205
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,596
- Did you forget what he did for Gray?
- That had nothing to do with it.

1206
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,755
Thanks. Gray wanted to be cured.
She doesn't.

1207
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,069
- How do you know?
- Because I know women.

1208
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:04,119
Do you think she'll stick to Larry? No.
She'll break out. It's in her blood.

1209
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:07,511
It's a brute she wants. That excites her.
It's a brute she'll go after.

1210
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,352
She'll lead Larry to hell.

1211
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,394
It's probable, but I don't see
what you can do about it.

1212
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,030
I can do nothing about it.

1213
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,391
But you can.

1214
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,517
I?

1215
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,554
Larry likes you, and he listens
to what you say.

1216
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,235
You know the world. Go to him and
tell him he can't make a fool of himself.

1217
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,515
Tell him it'll ruin him.

1218
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:32,070
He'd only tell me it's none of
my business, and he'd be quite right.

1219
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:34,549
It may not turn out so badly
as you think.

1220
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:38,315
You make me tired!
She's rotten to the core!

1221
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,752
Do you think I've sacrificed myself...

1222
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,832
...only to let Larry fall into the hands
of a woman like that?

1223
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,431
How did you sacrifice yourself?

1224
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,434
I gave up Larry for one reason only.

1225
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,989
Because I didn't want to stand
in his way.

1226
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,434
Come off it, Isabel.

1227
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,434
You gave him up for
a square-cut diamond and a sable coat.

1228
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,629
Your Uncle Elliott wouldn't
have thanked you...

1229
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,268
...if you'd broken one of his
Crown Darby plates.

1230
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,715
They were made for the Duchess
of Dorset.

1231
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:13,031
- Pick up that bread and butter.
- Pick it up yourself.

1232
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,509
And you call yourself
an English gentleman.

1233
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,830
No, that's one thing I've never done.

1234
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,436
Get out of here! I never want to see
you again. I hate the sight of you.

1235
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,992
I'm sorry for that, because the sight
of you always gives me pleasure.

1236
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,678
Have you ever been told your nose
is like that of the Psyche...

1237
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,592
...in the Muzeum of Naples?

1238
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:40,276
And that's the loveliest representation
of virginal beauty that ever existed.

1239
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:44,116
You've got exquisite legs,
so long and shapely.

1240
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:48,108
I can't cease to be surprised at them.
They were lumpy when I first saw you.

1241
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:52,876
- I can't imagine how you've managed it.
- An iron will.

1242
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,672
But, of course, your most
fascinating feature...

1243
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,037
...are your hands.
They're so slim and elegant.

1244
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,839
I was under the impression
you thought them too big.

1245
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,150
Not for your height and build.

1246
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,799
I'm always amazed at the infinite grace
with which you use them.

1247
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,475
Whether by nature or by art...

1248
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,837
...you never make a gesture
without imparting beauty to it.

1249
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,549
They're like flowers sometimes...

1250
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,678
...and sometimes like birds
on the wing.

1251
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,071
There are moments
when I don't positively dislike you.

1252
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,356
Sometimes I think you're rather sweet.

1253
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,318
I will not have my face
smeared with lipstick.

1254
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,913
If you want to kiss me,
kiss me on the lips...

1255
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:37,311
...which is what a merciful providence
provided them for.

1256
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,359
Thank you.

1257
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,512
- Now what's it you want?
- Advice.

1258
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,832
There's only one thing you can do.
Make the best of a bad job.

1259
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,516
Larry's gripped
by the most powerful emotion...

1260
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,990
...that can beset the breast of man,
self-sacrifice.

1261
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,515
He's got to save the soul
of the wretched woman...

1262
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,955
...whom he had known
as an innocent child.

1263
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:04,550
And there's nothing you or I
or anyone can do to prevent it.

1264
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,439
But he's going to be so unhappy.

1265
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,151
Do you love him very much?

1266
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,876
It is a nuisance, isn't it?

1267
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,559
But I can't help it.

1268
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,711
And you don't want
to lose him altogether?

1269
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,031
Then make friends with Sophie.
Be as nice to her as you can.

1270
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,997
Ask her to lunch.

1271
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:27,431
It would be rather awkward for me
after what I've just said to Larry.

1272
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,637
- Will you behave if I do?
- Like an angel of light.

1273
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,472
I'll fix it up.

1274
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,559
One o'clock tomorrow at the Ritz.

1275
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,196
What are you thinking?
I don't quite like the look of you.

1276
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,477
I'm sorry. I thought that was
the one thing about me you did like.

1277
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,234
You haven't got some scheme
you've been hatching up?

1278
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,753
Oh, I promise you I haven't.

1279
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,275
I'm terribly curious
to see what she looks like...

1280
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,715
...now that Larry's reformed her.

1281
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,711
- Larry.
- Oh, there you are.

1282
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:05,916
Excuse me. Mr. Maugham's table?

1283
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,389
- In the lounge, monsieur.
- Thank you.

1284
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:13,912
Larry. You like it?

1285
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:17,400
You look fine, come on.

1286
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,234
- Hello, Larry.
- Miss Keith.

1287
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,311
- How do you do?
- Nice to see you.

1288
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:25,835
- Hello, Sophie.
- Oh, hello, Isabel.

1289
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,956
- Sophie, I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

1290
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,714
- Hello, Larry. Here they are.
- Thank you for asking us.

1291
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,233
- Hello, Gray.
- Hello, Larry.

1292
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,472
- Isabel says you're feeling much better.
- Not better, I feel great.

1293
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,359
I haven't taken a sleeping pill
since we went out together.

1294
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,750
If you ever hang out your shingle,
let me know.

1295
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,717
- I'll do that.
- Oh, a cocktail.

1296
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,757
- No, thank you.
- Here.

1297
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:46,876
- No, thanks.
- You don't mind if we do?

1298
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,793
- Oh, no, of course not.
- Go right ahead.

1299
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,190
Oh, look. Uncle Elliott.

1300
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:55,238
He behaves exactly as if the Ritz
were his private house.

1301
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:59,029
I'm sure he's telling them how pleased
he is they accepted his invitation.

1302
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,838
I'd rather not discuss it.

1303
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,718
Isabel. That bloody woman.

1304
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,269
How do you do?
It's charming to see you again.

1305
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,159
May I offer you my best wishes?
I hope you'll be very happy.

1306
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,833
Thank you.

1307
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:15,559
- The same to you.
- Thank you.

1308
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,073
Cocktail, Elliott?

1309
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:20,596
No, I would not like a cocktail.
I drink nothing but Vichy.

1310
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:25,639
Look at her. You all know her, of course.
The Princess Edna Novemali.

1311
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,392
You'd never think she was American.

1312
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:30,632
But I knew her before she came
over here from Milwaukee.

1313
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:34,509
And that frustrated old-maid secretary
of hers, if you ask me...

1314
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:38,878
...they look like a couple of fugitives
from Madame Tussauďs waxworks.

1315
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:46,995
And where will you and Larry
go on your honeymoon, my dear?

1316
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:49,151
Greece, isn't it?

1317
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:52,232
- Greece?
- It ought to be lovely this time of year.

1318
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,516
- Lovely.
- How about a liqueur, Gray?

1319
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,877
- Yes, I think I will.
- Ah, yes, this.

1320
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,152
Sophie?

1321
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,471
- No, thanks.
- You're very foolish. It's excellent.

1322
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,637
No, Uncle Elliott, she doesn't want it.

1323
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:08,109
- Gray?
- A little glass for monsieur?

1324
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,829
No, alas, it's forbidden me.
My doctors won't let me touch alcohol.

1325
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,912
A tear of Perzovka
can do monsieur no harm.

1326
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,950
Perzovka. Perzovka.

1327
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:22,517
I'll just have a look at the bottle.

1328
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,794
I'm sorry to hear you've been ill, Elliott.
You should take care of yourself.

1329
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,876
Perzovka.

1330
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:38,116
It can't hurt me for once.
Just a drop.

1331
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,396
Two drops, perhaps.

1332
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,038
We drank it at the Radziwills when
I stayed with them for the shooting.

1333
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:50,556
You should have seen
those Polish princes putting it away.

1334
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,280
They drink it by the tumbler
and never turn a hair.

1335
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,275
I don't care whether Sophie's
on the wagon or not, she must try this.

1336
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,998
It's an experience no one can miss.

1337
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,436
It's like listening to music
by moonlight.

1338
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,312
I'd rather not.

1339
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,958
Isabel?

1340
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,596
Nice smell.

1341
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,472
That's the herbs they put in it.

1342
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:22,118
Oh, very good. Can we have some
of this at the apartment?

1343
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:25,078
Certainly. I'll have a few bottles
sent around.

1344
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,231
What did you say it was like,
Uncle Elliott?

1345
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,233
Like listening to music by moonlight.

1346
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,193
It is.

1347
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:41,919
Sophie.

1348
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,796
- Yes?
- I saw the most divine wedding dress...

1349
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,793
...at Molyneux's. Let me give it to you
for a wedding present.

1350
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,678
- Uncle Elliott and me.
- What?

1351
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,912
- Sophie has one already picked out.
- Oh, don't be stuffy, Larry.

1352
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,435
Let us give her a dress.
I'll arrange a fitting.

1353
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,033
May she?

1354
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,998
- Certainly. It's very nice of you.
- Thank you, both of you.

1355
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,593
Not at all, not at all.

1356
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,228
Suppose you pick me up tomorrow
at 3 at the apartment?

1357
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,391
- You know the address, don't you?
- Yes.

1358
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:10,678
Oh, good heavens, we don't want you.
You're only the groom.

1359
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,718
I'll see you at 3.

1360
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,036
Yes, it was a lovely party.

1361
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,153
No, of course I did.

1362
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,630
I behaved like an angel.
I always do.

1363
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,317
Oh, how silly.

1364
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,550
Stop imagining things.

1365
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,750
I meant every word of it.

1366
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:32,718
Yes.

1367
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,359
Yes.

1368
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:38,357
Tomorrow. At 5.

1369
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,276
That was Somerset Maugham
on the telephone.

1370
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,078
He gives me the queerest feeling.

1371
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:50,708
As if he were leading
other people's lives for them.

1372
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,599
But I daresay that comes
of being a novelist.

1373
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,958
Here.

1374
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,472
Thanks.

1375
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,156
Mr. Maugham.

1376
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,350
I called him a stuffed shirt that night.

1377
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,751
What does it matter?
That's all past. You weren't yourself.

1378
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:22,476
Your mind was miles away when
I came in. Where was it? With Larry?

1379
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:25,837
- No, right here. I was thinking.
- What?

1380
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:31,072
- You always wanted Larry for yourself.
- I've always wanted to see him happy.

1381
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,950
You hate me for marrying him,
don't you?

1382
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:37,113
No. I don't hate you at all.

1383
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:40,556
I'd hate anyone or anything
that came in the way of his happiness.

1384
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,754
- I'll be a good wife.
- I hope you will.

1385
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:46,078
I was before.

1386
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:50,471
I know you were.
Sophie, don't misunderstand me.

1387
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,438
I don't.

1388
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,520
What are we getting into?
Coffee? Ice?

1389
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,352
No, thanks.

1390
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,431
I'm going to have a drink.

1391
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:06,030
Oh, look. Uncle Elliott sent the Perzovka.

1392
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,156
- The what?
- Don't you remember?

1393
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,151
He raved about it yesterday.

1394
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:14,472
Oh, yes, the Perzovka.

1395
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,552
Poor Uncle Elliott.

1396
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:22,396
Exaggerates about so many things,
but for once, he's right.

1397
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,799
I love the color.

1398
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,714
Like the green you sometimes see
in the heart of a white rose.

1399
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:31,599
Poor Sophie.

1400
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,990
I haven't had a drink since that night
in the rue de Lappe.

1401
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:43,432
It must be awful just to break off
completely, all at once.

1402
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,637
Sometimes when I've been alone...

1403
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,473
...I've wanted to shake
the house down.

1404
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,876
But I've quit.

1405
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:00,473
- Yesterday at the Ritz was tough going.
- I know, I saw it.

1406
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,551
Did you? Did I show it?

1407
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,548
Only to me, I think.
It meant something to me.

1408
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:10,191
Larry, you mean. Larry's happiness.

1409
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,312
He's good.

1410
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:15,835
He's really good, Isabel.

1411
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,310
I was gone. Lost. Gone.

1412
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,274
This is my only chance. I know that.

1413
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:27,874
Excuse me.

1414
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:30,190
- Is the car here?
- Yes, madame.

1415
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,956
Could we talk more?

1416
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,998
- Of course, as much as you want.
- Will you wait for me?

1417
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:41,709
I've got to pick up Joan
at the dentist's. I promised I would.

1418
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,877
Your baby.

1419
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:50,317
- How old is she now?
- Seven.

1420
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,872
Here.

1421
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,596
She's lovely.

1422
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:19,513
Linda would have been 9
in November.

1423
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,320
This November that's coming.

1424
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:30,472
Stay here. I'll be back
and we can talk.

1425
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:06,030
If you see Sophie MacDonald,
the American, tell her I'll be back later.

1426
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:54,030
Hi, big boy.

1427
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:56,760
Please pass me some Perzovka.

1428
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,359
Where's that?

1429
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,197
- I speak the English from London.
- Very well, come along.

1430
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:32,029
It is better I do not go in, monsieur.
I will wait for you there.

1431
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,437
Come on, Sophie.

1432
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,591
Let's get out of here.

1433
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,155
Hello, Larry.

1434
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,509
Come on. Join us.

1435
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,755
Perzovka.

1436
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:13,677
You must try some.

1437
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:16,070
It smells like... .

1438
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:19,550
Like listening to music by moonlight.

1439
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:27,599
Come along, Sophie. Up you go. Up.

1440
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:37,477
Come on, Sophie.

1441
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,317
Come with me now.

1442
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,994
I'll buy you a drink someplace else.

1443
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,792
Take your hands off me!

1444
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,192
I don't need you! I don't need anyone!

1445
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:06,676
<i>That was the very last I saw or heard</i>
<i>of Sophie MacDonald for almost a year. </i>

1446
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,909
<i>As a matter of record, it was</i>
<i>the very last any of us knew of her. </i>

1447
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,870
<i>I settled down at my cottage</i>
<i>on the Riviera... </i>

1448
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:16,270
<i>... near Cap Ferrat to finish my book. </i>

1449
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,268
<i>And then one day, the police of Toulon</i>
<i>sent for me. </i>

1450
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,030
Good morning, Monsieur Maugham.

1451
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:39,634
I see Monsieur Maugham
wears the <i>Légion ďHonneur. </i>

1452
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:42,519
- I have that distinction.
- I apologize for being obliged...

1453
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:45,433
...to inconvenience a person
of your distinction.

1454
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:48,512
Nothing could make me happier
than being of service to you.

1455
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,671
Now, about this.

1456
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:53,999
Yes. This is a very dirty business,
monsieur.

1457
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:58,472
It appears that the woman, Sophie
MacDonald, had a very evil reputation.

1458
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:00,915
She was brutally murdered.

1459
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,753
What?

1460
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:05,709
Her body was fished out of the harbor.

1461
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:08,713
Her throat was cut from ear to ear.

1462
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,279
Dreadful.

1463
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:19,353
How does it happen that a person
of your age...

1464
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,830
...and respectability should be
acquainted with such a character?

1465
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,709
- I knew her very slightly.
- This volume was found in her room.

1466
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,589
If you will examine the autographed
page, you will see it hardly suggests...

1467
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:34,116
...that your acquaintance with her
was as slight as you claim.

1468
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:40,797
"My sweet, let us see if the rose... . "

1469
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:43,516
If you think I was her lover,
you're wrong.

1470
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,079
It would be no affair of mine.

1471
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:47,754
And without wishing to say
anything offensive to you...

1472
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,959
...I must add that from what I've heard
of her proclivities...

1473
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,917
...I should say you were not her type.

1474
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,036
I'm prepared to take that
as a compliment.

1475
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:59,795
Nevertheless, it is evident you
would not address a perfect stranger...

1476
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:02,155
...as "my sweet. "

1477
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:07,509
That line, <i>monsieur le commissaire</i>, is the
first of a celebrated poem by Ronsard...

1478
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:11,599
...with whose works I am certain a man
of your education must be familiar.

1479
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,436
Ronsard, Ronsard. Oh, Ronsard.

1480
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:21,989
Of course, I studied Ronsard at school.
But with all the work I have to do...

1481
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:24,594
...I must confess that line
has escaped my memory.

1482
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:29,436
As a matter of fact, I signed this book
for her years ago in Chicago.

1483
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,919
Hello, Mr. Maugham.

1484
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:33,833
I didn't know you were here.
I thought you were in Sanary.

1485
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,150
Yeah, they sent for me.
Have they told you?

1486
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,595
- It's dreadful.
- I've just seen her at the morgue.

1487
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:40,352
I had to identify her.

1488
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:43,080
<i>Pardon, </i> Monsieur Maugham,
do you know this individual?

1489
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:47,313
I do. He's an American citizen.
His name is Lawrence Darrell.

1490
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:50,631
And what do you know of
Monsieur Lawrence Darrell?

1491
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,678
He's a student,
a young man of impeccable character.

1492
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,353
Impeccable, eh?

1493
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:58,830
And how long have you known this
young man of impeccable character?

1494
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,195
Approximately 10 years.

1495
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,077
Have any burial arrangements
been made?

1496
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:08,074
Well, if you are prepared to undertake
the expense of the funeral yourself...

1497
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:10,435
...you will receive
the necessary authorization.

1498
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:14,518
Here is a card of an undertaker,
a personal friend of mine...

1499
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:17,956
...who will arrange the matter for you
on terms and with dispatch.

1500
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:22,033
- You are a marvel of efficiency.
- You flatter me <i>beaucoup</i>.

1501
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:23,792
May I see where she lived?

1502
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:26,554
- You have not seen that room before?
- No, I have not.

1503
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,438
Look.

1504
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:01,472
Who are these people?

1505
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:04,677
- That's her husband. That's her baby.
- Where are they now?

1506
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:07,115
Dead, monsieur. A long time ago.

1507
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:10,955
May those be buried with her?

1508
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:13,714
- In that frame, monsieur?
- Yes.

1509
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,950
As you wish, monsieur.

1510
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:31,631
This is the ode of Keats' I read to her
when she was a little girl.

1511
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,236
I remember you mentioned it in the car,
on the way from the rue de Lappe.

1512
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,159
It's something
I've always remembered her by.

1513
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,673
<i>The day is gone</i>
<i>And all its sweets are gone! </i>

1514
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,628
<i>Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand</i>
<i>And softer breast</i>

1515
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,678
<i>Warm breath, light whisper</i>
<i>Tender semitone</i>

1516
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:52,431
<i>Bright eyes, accomplished shape</i>
<i>And languorous waist! </i>

1517
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:56,391
<i>Faded the flower</i>
<i>And all its budded charms</i>

1518
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:00,438
<i>Faded the sight of beauty</i>
<i>From my eyes</i>

1519
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,794
<i>Faded the shape of beauty</i>
<i>From my arms</i>

1520
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:08,870
<i>Faded the voice, warmth</i>
<i>Whiteness, paradise</i>

1521
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:12,350
<i>Vanished unseasonably at shut of eve</i>

1522
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,350
My advice is that you go
and have a good dinner.

1523
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:28,273
I have a card here
of one of the best restaurants in Toulon.

1524
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:30,590
It will assure you
of the patron's attention.

1525
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:34,309
A bottle of wine will do you both good
after this harrowing experience.

1526
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:37,597
I've got to get to Nice.
Elliott Templeton's had a relapse.

1527
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:40,035
I'm sorry to hear that.
Do Gray and Isabel know?

1528
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,031
Yes, I hope they'll arrive in time.

1529
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,031
- I wish you'd come.
- I'd like to...

1530
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:47,272
...but I was never one of Elliot's
favorites, if you remember.

1531
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:10,268
- Thank you. Good afternoon, Joseph.
- Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

1532
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,396
I'll let Mr. Templeton know
you're here.

1533
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,710
- How is he?
- Very weak, sir.

1534
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,030
The doctors say there's no hope.

1535
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:19,316
May I speak to you
on a very delicate matter?

1536
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:21,835
- Of course.
- The time is growing short...

1537
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,673
...and Mr. Templeton
should receive the last sacraments.

1538
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:28,196
I hesitate to mention it to him,
sir, but perhaps...

1539
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,828
- I shall be glad to suggest it.
- Thank you, sir.

1540
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,430
I hear voices.

1541
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,836
See who it is.

1542
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,235
Mr. Maugham, Mr. Darrell.

1543
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,278
My dear fellow,
how very nice to see you.

1544
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:58,912
And Larry. Well, this is a surprise.
Sit down. Sit down.

1545
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,799
- Mr. Maugham said you were sick.
- Did he?

1546
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:04,110
- Well, I am sick.
- But you don't look it.

1547
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:06,316
You look extremely well.

1548
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:09,913
Well, really now,
young Mr. Larry Darrell...

1549
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:13,117
...that's the most sensible thing
I've ever heard you say.

1550
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:15,318
Of course he's right.

1551
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:18,199
It's only a temporary indisposition.

1552
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,712
I'm lunching with
a duke on Sunday...

1553
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:24,714
...and I've told my doctor he must
put me to rights by then at all costs.

1554
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:27,678
It's too bad this should
have happened just now.

1555
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,229
It's a particularly brilliant season.

1556
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:34,954
Are you going to Edna Novemali's party?

1557
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:37,429
- Of course not.
- Has she asked you?

1558
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:39,477
She's asked everybody in Europe.

1559
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,710
She's giving a great do. Fancy dress.

1560
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:44,157
Fancy dress.

1561
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,120
She hasn't asked me.
It's a deliberate insult.

1562
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,794
Don't be ridiculous.
Why should she want to insult you?

1563
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:53,953
- It was just an oversight.
- I'm not a man that people overlook.

1564
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,630
Perhaps she doesn't know
you're in the south of France.

1565
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:00,110
Don't be ridiculous, Larry. Everybody
knows I'm in the south of France.

1566
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:02,191
It'll be the best party of the season.

1567
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,755
If I was on my deathbed, I'd go to it.

1568
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:08,879
Never mind, old boy, it may rain
the night of the party. That'll ruin it.

1569
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,514
I never thought of that.

1570
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:19,990
I'll pray for rain
as I've never prayed before.

1571
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,913
The old witch.

1572
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:26,838
She'd never have got anywhere
if it hadn't been for me.

1573
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,834
Now she doesn't invite me
to the greatest party of her career.

1574
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:34,869
Fireworks, my dear fellow.
There are going to be fireworks.

1575
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:38,399
So unkind.

1576
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:41,837
I hate them, I hate them all.

1577
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:45,074
They've eaten my food
and drunk my wine.

1578
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:48,949
I've run their errands for them.
I've made their parties for them.

1579
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:53,511
And what have I got out of it?
Nothing.

1580
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,356
Now that I'm old and sick...

1581
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:00,316
...they have no use for me.

1582
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:04,155
They don't care whether I live or die.
Not one of them.

1583
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:07,636
They're so cruel.

1584
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,878
I wish I'd never left America.

1585
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,717
Excuse me.

1586
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:28,872
I'm afraid you're very ill, Elliott.
Much iller than you think.

1587
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:31,508
I was wondering if you'd like
to see a priest.

1588
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:33,557
Do you mean to say I'm going to die?

1589
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:37,030
Oh, I hope not, but it's as well
to be on the safe side.

1590
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:38,997
I understand.

1591
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:42,668
Don't be upset, my dear fellow.

1592
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:45,879
Noblesse oblige, you know.

1593
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:49,910
You... You ridiculous creature, Elliott.

1594
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:53,870
Call the bishop. Tell him I'd appreciate
it if he'd send Father Charles.

1595
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:55,359
He's a friend of mine.

1596
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,353
- I'll go and do that now.
- Thank you.

1597
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:08,870
- May I borrow your car a few moments?
- Of course.

1598
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:10,758
I'll go to Princess Novemali's house.

1599
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:12,831
Her secretary's an old Scotch girl
I know.

1600
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,195
I think I can do something
about the invitation.

1601
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:18,158
She's a spiteful woman.
There'll be 1000 people at her party.

1602
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,470
It couldn't have hurt her
to have asked him.

1603
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,438
- Leave that to me.
- Don't worry about the bags, darling.

1604
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:26,478
- Mr. Maugham. Larry.
- Hello.

1605
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:28,915
This is a surprise.
I had no idea you were here.

1606
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:30,479
- Hello, Gray.
- How is he?

1607
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:33,279
- I'm afraid you've come just in time.
- Poor Uncle Elliott.

1608
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:36,989
- I think he'd like to see you. Come on.
- Larry, you're not leaving?

1609
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:39,071
I'll be right back.

1610
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,350
It's more usual
to come in by the door, Larry.

1611
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,351
Hello. I thought the room was empty.

1612
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:13,353
Then may I inquire
what you're doing here?

1613
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:16,753
- I'm a burglar, dear.
- Fancy that, now.

1614
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:20,151
And I thought for one happy moment
that you'd come here to attack me.

1615
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:24,233
No, Miss Keith. No, I came to steal
a card for the princess's party.

1616
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:27,039
- She hasn't asked Elliott Templeton.
- I know she hasn't.

1617
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,395
She crossed his name off
on the list herself.

1618
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:31,198
He's awfully hurt at being left out.

1619
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:33,032
If he wanted to keep in with her...

1620
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:36,909
...he shouldn't have said those terrible
things about her and her chauffeur.

1621
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:39,992
The unfortunate part about it is
that they're all true.

1622
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:44,039
- You have nothing against him.
- No. He's always been very nice to me.

1623
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:46,475
He's a gentleman.
That's more than you can say...

1624
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:50,838
...about most people who come here to
fill their bellies at the princess's expense.

1625
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,755
Oh, come, Miss Keith, be a good sport.
Give me a card. He won't come.

1626
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:59,117
He's dying, and it'll make
the poor old man so happy.

1627
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:05,513
The cards are on the desk.

1628
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:09,116
I am going to look out of the window
to observe the beauty of the prospect.

1629
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,430
And what happens
when my back is turned...

1630
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:14,990
...neither God nor man
can hold me responsible for.

1631
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,313
Thank you, Miss Keith.

1632
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:51,669
Our poor friend is very low.

1633
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,432
He was a good man.

1634
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:57,559
His defects were on the surface,
but he was generous of heart...

1635
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:00,188
...and kindly toward his fellow creatures.

1636
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:02,715
You may go in now.

1637
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:17,556
A great honor, my dears.

1638
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:19,472
I shall enter the kingdom of heaven...

1639
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:22,552
...with a letter of introduction
from a prince of the church.

1640
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:25,109
I fancy all doors will be open to me.

1641
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,999
- You'll find the company very mixed.
- Don't you believe it.

1642
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:31,277
There will be none of this
confounded democracy there.

1643
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,954
I shall pick and choose my company
as I always have.

1644
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:39,592
No, no, please don't draw the curtains.
I always love this time of afternoon.

1645
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:41,432
Have a drink, my dear fellow.

1646
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:44,239
- You always have a drink at this time.
- I have had it.

1647
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:47,392
Have you? Isabel,
if you are going to make a scene...

1648
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:49,869
...you will have to leave the room.

1649
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,918
I'm a rich man in my way,
and I've left you everything I have.

1650
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:56,868
- Oh, Uncle Elliott.
- Now, now, now. Gray, come here.

1651
02:05:57,880 --> 02:06:01,190
I understand you have a job in prospect.

1652
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:04,830
Yes. A roommate of mine in college
has offered me a job in his business.

1653
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,039
My idea is to see if I can raise enough
money to start up my father's firm again.

1654
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:12,715
- It's still in receiver's hands.
- Splendid.

1655
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:16,437
You have the money now, my boy.

1656
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:22,196
Letter for Mr. Templeton.
It's marked urgent.

1657
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:24,715
Joseph, you'd better stay.

1658
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:32,476
- Elliott.
- What is it?

1659
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:34,312
For you.

1660
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,312
Open it.

1661
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:43,598
- What is it?
- It's a card for Edna Novemali's party.

1662
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:50,110
There, what did I tell you?

1663
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,996
Get a pad and envelope.

1664
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:56,393
- I'll reply.
- Please, don't bother about that now.

1665
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,120
Why not? I've always been
a man of the world.

1666
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:02,397
There's no reason why I should forget
my manners as I'm leaving it.

1667
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:04,869
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Elliott.

1668
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,998
Mr. Elliott Templeton regrets...

1669
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,914
...he cannot accept...

1670
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:18,232
...Princess Novemali's kind invitation...

1671
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:21,432
...owing...

1672
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:25,389
...to a previous engagement...

1673
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:30,599
...with his blessed Lord.

1674
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:34,753
The old witch.

1675
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,230
Pardon, madame,
but Mr. Darrell wishes to know...

1676
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:52,312
...if the chauffeur might drive him
to the station.

1677
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:57,232
- The station? He's leaving?
- Yes, madame, at 10:30 for Paris.

1678
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:59,675
But he didn't say.

1679
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:02,872
Yes. Yes, of course.

1680
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:13,038
Leaving?

1681
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:16,074
- He's going to America.
- Oh, really?

1682
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:17,514
How wonderful.

1683
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:21,389
He's going to work his way back
on a tramp steamer.

1684
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:25,030
He would do that.
But it doesn't matter.

1685
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:28,078
At least he'll be home. I'll see him.

1686
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:31,278
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1687
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:33,357
But you're not me.

1688
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:37,149
All my life, I've done the things
other people have wanted me to do.

1689
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:41,029
From now on, I intend to do the things
I want to do.

1690
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:43,794
I intend to see as much of Larry
as I possibly can.

1691
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:49,592
- It may cause you a lot of pain, my dear.
- I know, but it's a pain that's heaven.

1692
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:56,828
Oh, Joseph. Tell Marcel
not to bother about the Rolls.

1693
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,549
- I'll drive you to the station, Larry.
- Fine, thank you.

1694
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:03,395
- You're on your way again.
- Yes.

1695
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:06,836
I'm sorry I can't stay for the funeral.
I have to catch a boat.

1696
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:13,238
- So you're going back to America at last.
- That's right.

1697
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,231
And what are you going to do?

1698
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:18,631
I thought I might take a job
in a factory or a garage.

1699
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,074
I've always liked machinery.

1700
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:23,038
And when I'm washing a car
or tinkering with a carburetor...

1701
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:25,953
...my minďs free, and I feel
I'm accomplishing something.

1702
02:09:26,120 --> 02:09:27,838
And after that?

1703
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:29,999
I don't know.

1704
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,958
- I might buy a taxi.
- A taxi?

1705
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:36,192
It's a good life, always on the go.
You meet a lot of people.

1706
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:40,831
Oh, Larry, for heaven's sake.
What you need is a good psychiatrist.

1707
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,992
Sometimes I think you're completely
out of your mind.

1708
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:47,994
Just look what you've done
with your life. And with mine!

1709
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:50,914
What in heaven's name
are you trying to prove?

1710
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,230
I'd hoped you'd come back
to the States with us.

1711
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:06,631
Gray's going into business again,
and he'll need help.

1712
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,870
You've no idea
what you've done for him.

1713
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:13,318
He spoke of it again only yesterday.
You can't see the change, but I can.

1714
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:16,472
When you're around, he's different,
much like his old self.

1715
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:20,235
- Gray's all right. He doesn't need me.
- But suppose he does?

1716
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:23,472
Suppose something goes wrong again
and he has another breakdown?

1717
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:25,437
You can't imagine
what he went through.

1718
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:30,674
It wasn't just a matter of headaches
or nerves. He was sick, really sick.

1719
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:32,876
I've never told this
to anyone before...

1720
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:35,713
...but for months and months,
we watched him every minute.

1721
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:39,111
It wasn't just losing his money
and the business his father had built.

1722
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:42,477
It was more. He blamed himself
for all the things that happened...

1723
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:45,757
...to those little people
who trusted him with their savings.

1724
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:49,959
I honestly believe
if it hadn't been for the children...

1725
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:52,509
...he'd have killed himself.

1726
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:55,956
Well, there's nothing so surprising
about that, Isabel.

1727
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:58,710
There isn't a man or woman
living today...

1728
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,872
...who hasn't felt that way
at least once in their lives.

1729
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:06,591
The wonderful thing about life
is that most of us get a second chance.

1730
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:09,115
I got a second chance...

1731
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:13,717
...right at the moment when I thought
there was nothing worthwhile living for.

1732
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:19,151
Do you know what it means to see
another man give up his life for you?

1733
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:22,869
Do you? Have you ever thought
what it is to walk the streets at night...

1734
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:25,952
...knowing that you're walking
in another man's shoes?

1735
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:28,395
That someone deliberately died...

1736
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,755
...so that you might go on living.

1737
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,194
Listen.

1738
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,595
Do you remember that night in Chicago
when we talked at the country club?

1739
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:40,036
I told you then that I didn't think
I'd ever find myself.

1740
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:43,510
Well, I haven't yet, completely.

1741
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:45,875
I've found some of the things
I was looking for.

1742
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:50,716
Someday I may find them all, but in
any event, I'm going to keep on looking.

1743
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:53,720
It isn't easy, and it isn't fun.

1744
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:58,078
I've known moments of futility
and frustration. I've... .

1745
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:04,829
But that's all past now. Past and done.
I know what lies ahead.

1746
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,470
I know where I'm going. Gray,
in his own way, can do the same thing...

1747
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:13,156
...because this is his second chance.
And I know he'll come through.

1748
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:18,559
All right. Suppose he does?
And what about me?

1749
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:21,308
Doesn't it mean anything to you
that I love you?

1750
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:23,710
That I've never loved anybody
else but you?

1751
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:26,474
That my children might've been
your children? That...?

1752
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:29,108
Oh, why didn't I marry you
when I had the chance?

1753
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:31,111
I could have, you know I could have.

1754
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:34,716
That night in Paris, you were ready
to give up all this foolishness for me.

1755
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:36,996
If I'd had brains enough,
I coulďve saved you.

1756
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:41,711
But no, I threw you out! I thought
I was being so noble, remember?

1757
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:47,637
Look at me, Larry.
You know you love me.

1758
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,639
You know that you've always
wanted me.

1759
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:55,476
Say it's true.
Say you know it's true.

1760
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:58,950
Oh, Larry, I love you.

1761
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:01,156
I love you.

1762
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:03,869
Promise you'll come back with us.

1763
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:06,235
Promise you will.

1764
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:21,313
Tell me about Sophie, Isabel.

1765
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:28,678
Sophie?

1766
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:30,796
What about Sophie?

1767
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:34,350
That afternoon she came to your
apartment, did she have a drink?

1768
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:36,750
- Yes.
- Perzovka?

1769
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:38,353
How did you know?

1770
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:45,397
Isn't it strange that she shoulďve asked
for such an unfamiliar liqueur?

1771
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:50,114
She didn't ask for anything.
She just helped herself.

1772
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:52,510
I had to pick up my daughter
at the dentist.

1773
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:56,434
And when I returned, Sophie was gone
and the bottle was empty.

1774
02:13:56,600 --> 02:14:00,036
When you found Sophie gone and
the bottle empty, weren't you surprised?

1775
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:01,838
I thought she got tired of waiting.

1776
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,639
When I noticed the bottle,
I thought the butler drank it.

1777
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:07,633
I very nearly spoke to him about it.

1778
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:13,394
You never were a very good liar, Isabel.

1779
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:15,835
You don't believe me.

1780
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,991
Not for a moment.

1781
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:20,151
Then don't.

1782
02:14:27,120 --> 02:14:30,078
All right, if you want the truth,
I did it, and I'd do it again.

1783
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:33,710
I was determined to prevent her marrying
you. Nobody else would do a thing!

1784
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:36,758
They didn't care. I did!
Oh, Larry, you men are such fools.

1785
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:40,276
I knew that sooner or later,
she'd break down. It stuck out a mile.

1786
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:44,399
You saw how jittery she was at the Ritz.
I knew she'd give her soul for a drink.

1787
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:47,791
The idea came when Uncle Elliott
made such a fuss about the stuff.

1788
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:50,997
I hated it, but I pretended
it was wonderful.

1789
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:58,909
I knew if she had a chance,
she'd never resist.

1790
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:02,198
That's why I offered her a dress.

1791
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:05,158
I made up my mind that if Sophie
hadn't touched the bottle...

1792
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:07,834
...I'd make the best of things
and try to be friends.

1793
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,560
That's true, I swear it!

1794
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:13,515
When I came back,
saw the bottle was empty...

1795
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:16,114
...I knew I'd been right all along.

1796
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:19,314
That's pretty much what I thought.

1797
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,594
Sophie's dead.

1798
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:35,037
Dead?

1799
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:37,873
Her body was found
in the harbor at Toulon.

1800
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:40,156
She'd been murdered.

1801
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:43,635
Oh, how horrible.

1802
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:46,796
Do they know who did it?

1803
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:49,877
No.

1804
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,836
But I do.

1805
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:01,715
There's no need to be shocked
about Sophie any longer, Isabel.

1806
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:06,078
I've had the feeling all day that Sophie
is where she would want to be most...

1807
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:08,750
...with Bob and Linda.

1808
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:13,036
Oh, I know it's a very usual
and simple way to look at it...

1809
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:16,037
...but it's comforting.

1810
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:22,271
Goodbye, Isabel.

1811
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:25,000
And take good care of Gray.

1812
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:27,879
He needs you now more than ever.

1813
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:07,832
- He's gone.
- I know.

1814
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:16,990
I've lost him.

1815
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:23,191
Lost him for good.

1816
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:26,238
And I love him.
I love him so tenderly.

1817
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,789
And now I've lost him.

1818
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:32,028
Do you suppose we'll ever
see him again?

1819
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:33,792
It isn't likely.

1820
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:37,077
His America will be as remote
from yours...

1821
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:41,438
...as the Gobi Desert.
- It's all so crazy, so useless.

1822
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:45,798
What is he trying to do with his life?
What does he hope to find?

1823
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:50,272
My dear, Larry has found what we all
want and very few of us ever get.

1824
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:54,839
I don't think anyone can fail
to be better and nobler...

1825
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,560
...kinder, for knowing him.

1826
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:01,195
You see, my dear...

1827
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:06,873
...goodness is, after all,
the greatest force in the world.

1828
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:09,395
And he's got it.

1829
02:18:54,320 --> 02:18:56,311
