Wake up. Wake up.

00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,492
Okay, don't worry about it,
I'm gonna get you out in a jiffy.

Got you! Okay, body you're free.

Now escape, go! Just go, cry freedom.

- You almost gave me a heart attack!
- Lenny, what are you doing?

12
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:29,327

00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,313
Hey, mom said it's not okay to hit me!

15
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,135
Mom's not here.

00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,505
Don't. Don't!

17
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:46,299
What do you mean?
It's a theme song.

00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:12,285
Are they gone? Are they gone?

19
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:13,436
You're sure?

00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:29,362

Whale for a wash and the price,

00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,020
Oh my gosh.

101
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:46,239
Oh, may I suggest a monic peel?

00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:47,868
Removes lines and self damage.

103
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,595
- Good.

00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:50,937
Oh my gosh! Hi Oscar!

Yo, I'm sorry dog, Angie

00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,266

108
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,704
- Thanks, dog.

109
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:00,430
Come on Ange, dance with me, mama!

111
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:06,088
- Come on, Ange!
- Oscar! You're gonna get me fired!

112
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,430
Please. You? Fired?

113
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:09,636
No, that can't happen, cause then I would have

114
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:12,225
absolutely no reason to come to work.

115
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:17,307
- You don't mean that.
- Of course I do. You're like my best friend.

116
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:22,484
Let me see, tell me what
you think about this,

117
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,266
this is like the best idea ever, allright?

118
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,334
This is a short thing guarantee
cash extravaganza.

119
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:32,649
- Bottled water.
- Oh, no.

120
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:35,717
All I need, is another advance
of my paycheck from deposite,

121
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:37,444
and Ange, I am out of this place!

122
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:42,525
Oscar, it's relegating mister Sykes face,

123
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,538
with another one you-get-rich-quick-skims.

124
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:45,882
Go to something you're actually good at.

125
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:50,005
Your job! Which is some of
a miracle you still have!

126
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:52,689
Almost forgot.

127
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,813
- I brought you some breakfast.
- You didn't.

128
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:58,826
- Shelly creams?
- Your favourite!

129
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:01,319
Oh, by the way, you're still on hold.

130
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,716
Oh my gosh! Thank you for holding!

131
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,347
Busy busy busy! Go!

132
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:06,209
How can I help you?

133
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:13,689
No, I'm sorrry, mister Sykes
is at the meeting right now.

134
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:14,936
He won't be'll back till later.

135
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:25,387
How are my little babies this morning?

136
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,593
You missed me? You're doing good?

137
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:34,401
You see, Sykes. It's a fish eat fish world.

138
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:36,607
You eat the take, or you get taken.

139
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:42,839
True words have never been spoken.

140
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:44,086
Is that it? That all? We're done?

141
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:48,400
Now you and me, we've worked
together a long, long, long time.

142
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:50,797
- Please, Don Lino, it's hardly been like worked!
- Let me finish.

143
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,428
- And you know...
- And I love that about you!

144
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:55,592
Let me finish! That I'd lived my life for my sons.

145
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:58,852
- Raising them and protecting them,
- You're the best! He's the best, right?!

146
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,003
- Teaching them.
- Am I right or am I wrong?

147
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:02,113
- Ha? Am I right?
- Sykes, it's all been to pre...

148
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:03,934
- Right?
- To prepared.

149
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:04,989
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

150
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:07,866
For the day they run the reef.

151
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:10,551
Well, today is that day.

152
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:14,674
Luca!

153
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,825
Hey boss! Big butts!

154
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,674
Allright, to make long story short, from now on,

155
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,646
you work for Franki and Lenny, capish?

156
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:35,098
Lenny? Franki I understand, but Lenny?

157
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,016
- You can't be serious.
- That's serious.

158
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:39,029
It takes not only muscle to run things,

159
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,577
now Lenny, he's got the brains,
that's something special.

160
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:45,071
- Oh yeah, he's special.
- What's that supossed to mean?

161
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:48,907
- Nothing, nothing, I'm just saying.
- I bring you in here, look you in the eye

162
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,879
tell you what's what and what?
- What?

163
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,797
- What what?
- What what nothing!

164
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:56,482
- You said what first!
- I did say what first, I asked you what.

165
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:58,496
No, you said it then what, and I said what?

166
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,700
No, I said what what! Like what what!

167
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,920
- You said what first.
- Now you make a fun of me?!

168
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,454
No, no, no, you misunderstood,
you misunderstood.

169
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:08,276
Sorry, we're late, pap.
Lenny had an accident.

170
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:11,920
- He was born!
- He, he, he. You're comic genious!

171
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:14,796
Look, all I'm saying is
that kid ain't exactly no killer!

172
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:16,714
My Lenny is a killer, you hear me?

173
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:18,824
A cold blooded killer! Look at him!

174
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:23,138
Yeah?

175
00:10:25,152 --> 00:10:28,605
That's it! That's it! You are out!

176
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:29,275
What?

177
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:32,632
- What do you mean I'm out?
- You're fired!

178
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:38,001
And on top of that, you're gonna
have to start paying me!

179
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,440
- For what?
- So not have us to that

180
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:41,166
little whale wash of yours!

181
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:42,316
WHALE.

182
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:43,467
Welcome to Oscar's crib.

183
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,960
Sixty foot slide covered tomb.

184
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:49,700
There's swimming casualties and plankton

185
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,714
across the deep, when you feel a little...

186
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,398
old school.

187
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:55,932
Oh stop your moaning, Oscar!

188
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,467
That could be a lot worse, you know?

189
00:10:57,467 --> 00:11:00,343
Yeah, that's true. I can have
this job and look like you!

190
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,891
Who's behind me? Who's behind me!
Babe, give me some!

191
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:09,356
Indigestion.

192
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:12,042
She's gonna blow!

193
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,247
Wait! Headphone guy's still in there!

194
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:19,809
I get you! Hang on!

195
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:33,041
- Still think it could be worse?
- Yeah! I can look like you!

196
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:37,548
You're funny. We'll see
how you laugh at this!

197
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:48,000
Soap in the eye! Soap in the eye!

198
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,767
It's all right. It's all right. Look,

199
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,356
I'm gonna get you some cool pies,
we'll get you free hot wax

200
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,602
and all that, you like that?

201
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:01,712
- Allright, go at it, big baby.
- Thanks, Oscar.

202
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:02,767
All right.

203
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:06,315
- Ernie look, who's burning!
- Just the fish we were looking for!

204
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:09,095
- Yeah.
- The boss wants to see you right now!

205
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,301
- Right now!
- Ernie! Bernie!

206
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:12,739
My jelly fish brothers, voodoo!

207
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:15,808
Hey what's up, men?
Ah men, good to see you!

208
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:20,027
Fellows, I'm gonna ahead,

209
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:22,711
over there with Don Worby.

210
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,492
That's not the way
you sing that song, man!

211
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:40,930
Hey Sykes! My brother from another mother!

212
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,369
What's the day is it, baby?

213
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,054
What's going down?

214
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:47,163
Hey baby, this is all gravy today, allright

215
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:48,793
snap you fin, right on it. Snap it!

216
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,231
- You are not snapping it!
- Oscar!

217
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:53,204
Hey, don't sweat it, Sykes,
a lot of other fish can do it.

218
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:54,451
Oscar, would you just sit down, okay?

219
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:56,752
- Thank you!
- Look, I've been gone off for my markets.

220
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:59,629
Your owe to me is five grand! Five gees, okay?

221
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:03,944
- Five gees? Man, it's not five gees!
- See if this refreshes your memory!

222
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,163
Wow! That's crazy! Look at that!

223
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,423
You wrote everything down
so you wouldn't forget!

224
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,916
Wow! This is a perfect example why you're

225
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,505
in management and I'm not. You go boy.

226
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,423
Look, I have to start paying
Don Lino for protection,

227
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,204
so everything you owe me, you owe him!
- How did you figured that?

228
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:23,025
It's simple. The food chain.

229
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:25,326
You see, on top there's Don Lino. There's me.

230
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,957
- And there's regular fish.
- And there's me!

231
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,793
No, there's plankton, there's single celominas.

232
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:33,381
- Then there's me.
- I'm getting to that, there's coral.

233
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,874
There's rocks. There's whale poo.

234
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:37,025
And then there's you!

235
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:40,190
- There's my stuff.
- So after he's squeezing me,

236
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,011
he's squeezing you!
- What?

237
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,025
Wow! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

238
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:46,901
- Easy boss, find your happy place.
- Happy place!

239
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,532
There's is no happy place with him around!

240
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,751
Okay, okay, okay. Please,
please just give some time,

241
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:55,723
that's all I'm asking!
I'm begging you, Sykes, please!

242
00:13:55,723 --> 00:14:00,038
- Please!
- All right.

243
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:04,833
Cause I like you. I'm gonna give you
twenty-four hours to pay out.

244
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,792
All of it?

245
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,806
- How will I do that?
- That's your problem.

246
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:09,723
Bring my five thousand clams

247
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:11,353
tomorrow, or else...
- Or else what?

248
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:12,503
The boys will explain you.

249
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:17,970
Unpleasant!

250
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:21,709
Five thousand clams?!

251
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:25,736
You borrowed five thousand
clams from mister Sykes?

252
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:29,572
Oscar, why do you get yourself
into these situations?

253
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:33,791
I don't know, Ange,
it's just hard, allright?

254
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:38,681
Because I'm a little fish
in a big pot. A really big pot.

255
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:40,119
The ocean.

256
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:43,859
I'm nobody.

257
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:47,887
- I want some of that!
- Missis Sanches?

258
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:53,256
Uh, no. That.

259
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,763
The top of the reef. Where
the somebodies live.

260
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:01,886
I wanna be rich and famous like them!

261
00:15:01,886 --> 00:15:07,161
- But I'm stuck down here.
- Well, what's wrong with down here?

262
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:09,078
I'll tell you what's wrong with down here.

263
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:13,297
Remember my dad? He worked
at the washes the whole life.

264
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:19,817
He was the number one tongue scrubber.

265
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:23,269
Every year for twenty-five years.

266
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:27,776
To me working at the wash

267
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:31,133
was the coolest job in the ocean.

268
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,681
But then I've learned something
I would never forget.

269
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:37,749
Ha, ha! Oscar dad's the tongue scruber!

270
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:42,735
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

271
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,433
My dad was the greatest.

272
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,077
But nobody loves nobody.

273
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,926
- I wanna be a somebody!
- Oscar, you don't have

274
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,611
to live at the top of the reef
to be a somebody.

275
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:05,460
What's the difference, if I don't pay
mister Sykes' beg by tomorrow.

276
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,858
I'm dead anyway.

277
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:11,885
Wait here.

278
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:25,501
What's this?

279
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,583
- A pink pearl?
- Hm.

280
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:33,844
- Where did you get that?
- My grandmother gave it to me.

281
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:38,926
She said it started from a tiny grand of sand,

282
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:41,898
but then after a while,

283
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:45,542
it grew in something beautiful.

284
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:51,487
- Dreams can begin small too.
- No, I couldn't.

285
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:55,322
Take it! It'll get you the money
you need for mister Sykes.

286
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,336
What's new on the stand? I'd been
on all over this a thousand times,

287
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:05,487
I don't wanna to say it again.

288
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,884
You know, you've really given
me actually, you know that?

289
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:09,514
I don't know how else
to say this to you, Lenny.

290
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,528
You see something, you kill it
and you eat it. Period.

291
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:14,308
Thanks. That's what sharks do!

292
00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:16,610
That's a fine tradition.
What's the matter with you?

293
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,487
Your brother Franki here, he's a killer.

294
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:21,021
- Right, pap.
- He's beautiful,

295
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:23,514
he does what he's supposed
to do! Wipe your face.

296
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:25,911
But you...

297
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:28,117
I'm hearing things...

298
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:31,472
You gotta understand,
when you look week,

299
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,486
it make me look week.
- I know, pap.

300
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,747
- I'm sorry.
- Lenny, Lenny, look at me.

301
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:37,993
Look at me!

302
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,541
This ain't nobody's business,
this is for you! It's for both of you!

303
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:44,226
And you're acting like
you don't even want it!

304
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,006
I need to know that you can handle that.

305
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,348
Right here in front of me now, eat this.

306
00:17:56,883 --> 00:17:59,281
Yeah, oh Jee! Thanks pap.

307
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:02,061
Here's the thing. I'm on a diet,

308
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:05,129
and I've read an article about these
shrimps, they are not good for you,

309
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,389
you know how many calories are in one shrimp?

310
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:11,363
- A lot!
- It's true! It's true,

311
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,416
and the other thing is,

312
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:15,581
my sister had a baby and I took her baby,

313
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:18,554
cause she past away, and then the baby lost it's legs,

314
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,951
and it's all I wasn't suppose I gonna stop,

315
00:18:20,951 --> 00:18:23,060
but I still take care of him with my wife.

316
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:28,910
It's crawling and it's fearly
happy, it's difficult, cause

317
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,307
I've been working on a
second shift at the factory,

318
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:34,087
there put food on the table, all the love

319
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:37,924
and I see that little guy's tears,
it's the worst in the world.

320
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,279
Front story.

321
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,992
I'm not asking you anymore, I'm telling you,

322
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:50,197
eat it!
- No! Have mercy!

323
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:51,635
- Pap, please!
- Eat!

324
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:52,786
- Don't eat!
- What are you...

325
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:54,128
- Son, eat...
- No!

326
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:55,375
the shrimp!
- Please!

327
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:57,964
- No, please, no!
- Lenny! Eat! Eat, eat, eat!

328
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:00,937
- Eat, eat, eat, eat!
- Put the shrimp down!

329
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:06,019
All right, go now. No one's
looking. Get out of here!

330
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:10,237
- You're free. Go on, go, go!
- Thank you. You're good person.

331
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:15,991
Come on, fellows!

332
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:28,169
- Papa, why can't I handle the reef?
- No! No! We're gonna do this as a family.

333
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:31,046
Franki, I want you to take Lenny
out, and show him the rules.

334
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:33,922
- Oh come on, pap.
- Son you're gonna learn how to be a shark!

335
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,649
Will you like it or not.

336
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,141
- That kid better show up, or he's dead meat!
- Yes, at a word, boss.

337
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:49,264
Get a whole load of the money,
give it to mister Sykes.

338
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:50,511
Come on, hurry up, hurry up!

339
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,812
- This is our chance, you don't wanna miss it!
- Are you sure about this?

340
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,730
A friend of friend of mine tipped me off!

341
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:58,182
- Race is rigged. We can't lose!
- Well what's the horses name?

342
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:00,100
Lucky day.

343
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:03,839
LUCKY DAY
SEABISCUIT

344
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:08,730
- We're gonna be rich. Rich!
- Top of the reef, here I come!

345
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,935
No, wait! What am I doing?

346
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:12,661
Remember what Angie said,
remember what Angie said.

347
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:15,346
What did Angie say?

348
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:20,140
Dreams can begin small,
you just have to bet it all!

349
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:21,579
Bet it all!

350
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:31,551
Five thousand on Lucky day to win!

351
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,757
That's two hundred a one!

352
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:39,606
- That would pay a million clams!
- Than I guess it makes me, Oscar la millionaire.

353
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:46,030
Lucky day! Lucky day! Lucky day!

354
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,263
Nice bet.

355
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,221
You have a name?

356
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:17,386
You wanna tell me what it is?

357
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,166
Well mine's Lola.

358
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:23,331
Come on man! Get it handled yourself!

359
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:26,592
So...

360
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,659
Lola, my name's O...

361
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:33,303
My name is Oscar, sweety.

362
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:36,564
- Missis Sanches!
- I hate when it hops,

363
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:38,193
smooth dog, don't work with me!

364
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:41,262
- No, my bad. Hey! So...
- Oscar!

365
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:43,275
I was starting to think
you skipped on on me.

366
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:45,577
Sykes! Hey! I see you...

367
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,166
already to your way to the cashier stand.

368
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,988
- What are doing?
- You mind bring us back some drinks?

369
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:51,618
- Why are you touching me?
- That'll be great man, thanks.

370
00:21:51,714 --> 00:21:52,864
Oh I know, I'll bring back

371
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:55,454
some of little winner thing!
- You mean the one with the toothpicks?

372
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,043
- What are doing? Don't listen to him!
- Come on Lola, let me escort you to...

373
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,440
my box.
- Your box?

374
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:03,221
His box? You can't even afford
the gum to the seats!

375
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,577
He just laid five grand on Lucky day,
I think he can afford

376
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:07,919
anything he wants!

377
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:11,850
Five grand? My five grand?

378
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,823
- No, it was another five grand.
- You had the money to pay me back

379
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:16,357
and you bet it anyway?
- Hold on.

380
00:22:16,357 --> 00:22:17,508
- Give me that!
- Sykes!

381
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:20,576
- Clearly I've made a mistake.
- No! No, wait! Lola!

382
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:23,645
Look, deep down, I'm really superficial.

383
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:26,330
And don't get me wrong, you're cute, but

384
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:28,152
you are a nobody.

385
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:33,234
Oscar, you're cute, but you are a nobody.

386
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:36,494
Wait Lola! Come back! I'm not a nobody!

387
00:22:36,494 --> 00:22:38,316
I'm a winner!

388
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,631
You are unbelievable, you're
in trouble up to your gilles,

389
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,165
and still, you're asking for more?

390
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:47,233
Now go on, get in here!
Oscar, you better pray

391
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,576
that this horse of yours comes through.

392
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:50,110
You bet my five thousand!

393
00:22:50,878 --> 00:22:52,986
Hey! Hey! Hey! Out of my seat!
You, out of my seat!

394
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:55,000
Unbelievable! Unbelievable!

395
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,877
- Sit tight and watch the race.
- With your good eye!

396
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,713
Horses are ready on the post.

397
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:05,644
Race is going special by
Seabiscuit and some of other!

398
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:08,233
The long shoulder Lucky day appears
of having trouble of getting

399
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,480
out of the gates.
- What?

400
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:11,109
Only a sucker could have bet on him!

401
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:13,411
No, no, no, don't sweat it man,
he does this all the time,

402
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:14,753
he just blam.
- Oh, what's this?

403
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:17,534
Lucky day has crossed his way through the gates!

404
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:18,781
And he's off for running!

405
00:23:19,452 --> 00:23:22,136
That was straight away
Seabiscuit forcing on Lucky day!

406
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:24,150
Fast! Go fast!

407
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,643
Coming round the fall tone the Seabiscuit riding,

408
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,753
and Lucky day well behind the pack.

409
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:31,725
And in comes Lucky day!
Coming up from behind!

410
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:33,835
He's passing other tales! Now or never!

411
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:35,753
Sykes, you see? Who's your fish now?

412
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:38,725
Around the final turn here comes Lucky day!

413
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:41,218
Lucky day is now calling the Fishfingers!

414
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:42,465
He gets ahead.

415
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:47,835
Wait, I'm getting tired, just beg him up!

416
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:49,082
Look how Lucky day goes!

417
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,259
Absolutely amazing!

418
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:57,711
This is Lucky day's big day!

419
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:59,150
That's Lucky day!

420
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:06,341
What happened!
Lucky day is down!

421
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,670
No!!!

422
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,519
And here comes Fishfingers
followed by Seabiscuit yellow tail.

423
00:24:18,615 --> 00:24:19,957
Fishfingers wins!

424
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:22,547
- What is it?
- Wait, wait, wait I just wanted to hold you!

425
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:24,464
Get out of my way, let me see!

426
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,998
Poor sad day for Lucky day!

427
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:29,163
And that's why they call him the low shot.

428
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:30,793
Yo, that was crazy, right?

429
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,807
Who knew? I mean everything's set,

430
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:34,821
there's a luck, we're good to go, we're in the money,

431
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:39,711
and he trips underwater. Who in a hell

432
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:41,532
trips underwater? And by the way...

433
00:24:42,874 --> 00:24:44,409
That's it! That's it, I've had it.

434
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:47,477
Ernie, Bernie, I want you to find
the deepest, darkest hole in the ocean,

435
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:50,834
and when you do, dig deeper,
and put him in it!

436
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,889
Sorry kid, it's nothing personal. It's just business.

437
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:08,861
Don't worry about a day,

438
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:14,710
cause every little thing is gonna be all right!

439
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,627
- This is how you sing it, Oscar.
- Yeah.

440
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:20,655
Sykes, you like your money.
I set ticket easy on you.

441
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:24,682
- But Sykes is not here!
- True.

442
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:29,093
- Ernie, let me ask you a question.
- Yeah man, go on.

443
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:31,874
Why is it that millacscan sting on a people?

444
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,654
But they have no affect on you.

445
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:38,682
Ernie, I didn't mean it Ernie!
I didn't mean it man!

446
00:25:41,654 --> 00:25:43,668
Ernie! You made a joke!

447
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,640
- Good one man! Respect!
- Respect.

448
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,080
Load fire!

449
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:54,312
- Franki, you know I can't do this!
- Lenny, if you wanna make pap happy,

450
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:57,572
you gotta kill something!
- Or I could find a very old sick fish

451
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:58,915
and just wait!
- Oh.

452
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:00,928
This getting around, you think
of the day in the restaurant,

453
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:01,983
you know how fish pop!

454
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,093
Bit of bit, bit of bob,
this that the other, then

455
00:26:04,093 --> 00:26:06,394
how you're doing? Boom!
Get a body here. Dead

456
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:09,558
Okay, seriously I can't
understand why this is so

457
00:26:09,654 --> 00:26:12,435
you have to be more specific.
- More specific? You want specific?

458
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:15,887
- Be a shark, for once in your life!
- Oh, what am I gonna do?

459
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:19,818
Lenny, forget about it, okay?
We do a couple of practice,

460
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:22,216
but a bim, but a bom,
pap's happy, you're a shark,

461
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:24,804
life goes on! Capish?
- Okay.

462
00:26:24,804 --> 00:26:27,873
- Okay, capish.
- Wait, wait, wait. Bingo.

463
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:31,996
Right there, there you see? TV dinner.

464
00:26:31,996 --> 00:26:36,886
- Don't get lousy on this.
- All right. Come on. I am the tiger.

465
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:41,106
Franki, I can do this!
What if I can't do this?

466
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:44,461
- Then don't bother coming home.
- Good point! All right.

467
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,092
Hit him in the tale again.

468
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,736
- I like his funny face, man.
- Funny face, yeah.

469
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:50,982
- Ernie!
- No!

470
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:03,160
Guys! Guys! Don't leave me alone!
Come on, there could be a shark out here!

471
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:12,749
Oh no, wait!

472
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:14,283
I'm sorry, no, no, no. I'm not gonna...

473
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:15,338
- Lenny!
- What?

474
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,488
Like this!

475
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:23,393
Oh my god! Just get off me!
Wait a minute!

476
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:26,652
Do me a favor, don't chew me,
I'm not for that.

477
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:30,200
- I'm not gonna eat you.
- Don't do the whole hit trip thing with me!

478
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:32,118
Listen to me, don't move until I tell you!

479
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:37,488
That's it, Lenny, here you go, body!

480
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,597
That's it, dig straight, baby. Dig it!

481
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,049
Look, I'm just pretending,
so you can get away.

482
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:45,159
When I turn around, you take off!

483
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:48,227
Tastes like chicken! Mhh.

484
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,213
- Oh no. No.
- What did I tell you!

485
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,940
I'm sorry, I didn't get it,
you want me to go now?

486
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:58,103
- What are you doing, just come home!
- That's it, I've had it up to here!

487
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:03,091
- Oh no!
- Hurry, swim!

488
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:06,063
- No, Franki wait!
- No, get your boy! Get your boy!

489
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:22,556
Franki!

490
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,076
Lenny,

491
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:34,158
- Lenny, is that you?
- I'm here, Franki.

492
00:28:34,158 --> 00:28:36,459
- Come closer.
- Yes, what is it?

493
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:40,294
- I'm so cold.
- That's just because we're cold blooded.

494
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:43,555
Moron!

495
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:47,103
Franki, no!

496
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:50,459
No!!!

497
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:57,363
This is all my fault! I'm so sorry, Franki!

498
00:28:58,034 --> 00:29:00,623
Oh my, how am I gonna
explain this to pap?

499
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,075
Oh no!

500
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,376
Watch it! Back off! I'm crazy! I will do it!

501
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:16,444
- Wow!
- Wow!

502
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:20,472
Oh, what a...

503
00:29:26,226 --> 00:29:29,390
Don't hurt us, we're sorry!
It was all Ernie idea!

504
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:35,047
Oscar! Did you kill that shark?

505
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:42,526
All right, yeah! Yeah!

506
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:45,211
Exactly how it looked, that's how it is.

507
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:46,170
What happened!

508
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:51,252
- Oh, you want to know what happened?
- Yeah, you're standing on top of shark!

509
00:29:51,252 --> 00:29:53,074
- Go on man!
- Well I'll tell you what happened!

510
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,060
Big old shark, seventy-five hundred feet long,

511
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,690
so he's swimming at me, right?

512
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,855
- With teeth like razors!
- Razors!

513
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,020
And it was all like, you want come at me like that,

514
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,224
you want come to all like that?

515
00:30:08,992 --> 00:30:11,197
Dude, do the muscle thing, the muscle thing!

516
00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:14,361
Oh right, right. So I told that dude,
I said do you see this guy?

517
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,662
And I pointed like this,
well he's got a brother.

518
00:30:16,662 --> 00:30:18,676
And he lives right over here!

519
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:23,183
And I think it's time for a little
family reunion!

520
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,594
- You see man, I told you!
- Excuse me.

521
00:30:27,594 --> 00:30:30,471
- We were right there, right there!
- Pardon me. Move it!

522
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:33,539
Sorry, sorry! She seems so nice on TV.

523
00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:36,032
Oscar, Katie Current. As a first fish in history,

524
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:37,854
that ever take on a shark and win, tell me,

525
00:30:37,854 --> 00:30:39,868
does this mean you're now
the protector of the reef?

526
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:43,512
- New sheriff in town, the big cahuna?
- Katie, I'm a keeper of reef,

527
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:45,909
- I can call you Katie, right?
- Of course!

528
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:48,881
Any shark
tries to mess around
in Oscar town,

529
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,032
is going down!

530
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:56,073
Yeah, just poetic, I mean poetic!

531
00:30:56,073 --> 00:31:00,388
Oscar! Oscar.

532
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:03,169
Okay, get out of here, barracuda,

533
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:05,087
any further questions will be filled by me!

534
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:08,538
- And you are?
- I'm his manager, Sykes. With an Y.

535
00:31:08,538 --> 00:31:10,744
And I'm his financial advisor!

536
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,867
You wanna see my puppets?

537
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,648
Hello!

538
00:31:19,373 --> 00:31:21,004
Could you excuse for a moment, please?

539
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:23,593
- My manager?
- Kid, you're a superstar!

540
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:25,607
We're gonna make a fortune!
Just let me handle it.

541
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:27,428
- What about the five gees?
- Forget the five gees.

542
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:30,401
- From now on we're partners!
- So what exactly are we talking about here?

543
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:33,086
- I'm thinking about 90/10 split.
- Well, that's actualy pretty generous.

544
00:31:33,086 --> 00:31:34,524
You're the 10, I take my 90 off the top.

545
00:31:34,524 --> 00:31:35,771
- I don't think so!
- Talk to me.

546
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,113
- You get 50!
- 70.

547
00:31:37,113 --> 00:31:37,881
- 20!
- 75.

548
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,127
Dude! You're going the wrong way!

549
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,044
- Fifty-fifty!
- Fifty-fifty!

550
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,195
- You're happy?
- No, you're happy?

551
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,634
- No! Deal!
- Deal!

552
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,250
My manager and I are now
prepared to take your questions.

553
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,223
Oscar, are you going to continue
working here at the wash?

554
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,044
Please, I bearly work here now!

555
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:59,935
- Keep in up, kid. You're slaying them!
- No, he's slaying sharks!

556
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,564
Hey, that's good,
that's good, I like that!

557
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:03,674
Oscar, the Sharkslayer!

558
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,359
- Wow!
- A Sharkslayer!

559
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:07,990
You heard it here first, from now on,

560
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,099
any shark tries to bother this reef,

561
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:11,825
it's had its funeral.

562
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,208
I could fly high...

563
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:40,879
- Franki, we'll miss you.
- To Franki!

564
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:46,441
It's a terrible thing, Don Lino.
Everybody loved Franki.

565
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:49,989
May whoever did this, die at thousand depths.

566
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:53,248
May his stinking maggy coffered corpse rot

567
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:54,783
in a fire depth of hell!

568
00:32:56,413 --> 00:32:58,810
Thank you for your kind
thoughts, Giuseppe.

569
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:02,742
Oh and may Lenny be
found safe and sound too.

570
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:06,289
- Hope he's okay.
- Oh Lenny.

571
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:10,796
- Don't worry, boss.
- I said some things to him...

572
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:14,823
- We' gotta find him.
- We're searching everywhere.

573
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:16,550
Forget about it, he'll turn up.

574
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,618
What's wrong with that kid?
Why does he gotta be so different?

575
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:24,796
Franki, god rest his soul,
he was perfect. Perfect!

576
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:30,070
Oh, Luca, who could have done this?

577
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:37,837
Don Lino, at this most difficult time,
please accept my deepest condolences.

578
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,179
Thank you, Don Brizzi,

579
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,193
for honouring my son with your song.

580
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:45,987
I got some news, about
the guy who took out Franki.

581
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,521
Hey, let's talk over here.

582
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:59,028
He come out of nowhere, this guy.

583
00:33:59,892 --> 00:34:03,823
Calls himself the Sharkslayer.

584
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:09,768
- I'm here, over here.
- The Sharkslayer!

585
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:12,932
- Where do I find him?
- He's from the south side reef,

586
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:16,480
that's all we could dig up.
- Thank you, thank you.

587
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:20,412
- Any request?
- Luca.

588
00:34:20,412 --> 00:34:23,288
- How about that Titanic song?
- No, no!

589
00:34:23,384 --> 00:34:26,068
Get Sykes, he knows that
reef better than anybody.

590
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:28,946
I wanna find this guy, I wanna
know everything about him,

591
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:30,959
I wanna know where he lives,
I wanna know where he sleeps,

592
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:34,507

about it. Who is the Sharkslayer.

593
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,576
Here he is! The Sharkslayer!

00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:53,589

Found that dog. Found it! Oscar,

- Hey, wait! You're gonna break my gift!

603
00:35:40,382 --> 00:35:42,684
Come on, you didn't have to get me anything.

604
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:46,615
- What did you get me?
- Well, what does every bachelor need!

605
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:50,163
A lover lamp! How did you
know I love lover lamps?

606
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:52,464
You know what, I'm gonna put it

607
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,382
Hey, come Ange, I wanna show

608
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:06,848
- Wow!

609
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:12,121
- Top of reef! It's amazing!
- I know , it's beautiful, right?

610
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:15,094
Like your, like your new appartment?

It's... wow! Awesome!

00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:22,478
All I'm trying to say, is that...

613
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:27,559
- I'm proud of you, Oscar.
- Yeah, it was nothing, really.

614
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,779
You know what? Wait
right here, don't move,

615
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:34,368

00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,737
- Wow! I'm back!

621
00:36:52,874 --> 00:36:57,668
- I'd never could have done it without you.
- Oh, sure you could.

622
00:36:58,244 --> 00:36:59,587
Well, probably not.

623
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,298

- Oh, Oscar!

624
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:11,380

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,682
- Oh that's okay!
- Bam!

626
00:37:15,695 --> 00:37:17,229

- Lenny!
- Hey! What are you doing?

653
00:39:05,488 --> 00:39:07,310
There's a Sharkslayer around here!

654
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:12,296
Oh yeah, Lenny! Lenny!

655
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:17,282
- That was close.
- Super close.

656
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:21,981
Don't panic.

657
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:28,981
- Quiet, we're safe.
- No, not you again!

658
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:32,145
- Yeah, what was that?
- What is with you, man!

659
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,118
- Shh, he could be anywhere.
- Who?

660
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:38,474
Shh, the Sharkslayer.

661
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:43,939
- There's no Sharkslayer around here.
- Yes, there is!

662
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:48,542
- No, there is not, trust me on this one.
- Get a hold of yourself, man!

663
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:52,090
- This is no time to act crazy!
- You're the one acting crazy! Crazy!

664
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:55,158
You're right. You're right, I'm sorry.

665
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:56,884

667
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:07,624
No, that's not all that.

668
00:40:07,624 --> 00:40:09,541
- Just relax.
- It's my fault!

669
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,486
- Not really, but still!
- Okay calm. You just need a little time.

670
00:40:15,486 --> 00:40:17,596
- Man look, things are work out.
- You think?

671
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:18,843
Yeah! So...

672
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:23,637
Look, I'll take off, and you
should just go home, okay?

673
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:26,034
- Okay.
- Hey, good luck, dog.

674
00:40:26,993 --> 00:40:28,431
- Wait!
- What, man?

675
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:30,829
- I didn't catch your name.
- Oscar.

676
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:32,843
- I'm Lenny. Hi!
- Hi.

677
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:36,678
- Where do you live?
- Lenny? Where I come from,

678
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:39,363
fish don't like to get
grabbed by sharks, okay?

679
00:40:39,363 --> 00:40:40,801
- Sorry.
- Go home!

680
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,678
There is no home for me anymore.
Don't you understand that?

681
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,171
- You're too big to be grabbing me like this.
- Take me home with you.

682
00:40:46,171 --> 00:40:48,184
- Shh! What?
- You won't even notice I'm in!

683
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:49,335
I'm like the invisible shark!

684
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,143
- Are you crazy?
- Please, I'm begging you,

685
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:57,869
don't leave me alone!
- Shh!

686
00:40:57,965 --> 00:41:01,321
Yo! Put you fins on the wall,
where I could see them!

687
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:08,034
- Got ya!
- Hey, yo! Shorty!

688
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:10,143
- Oscar!
- What ya doing here?

689
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:12,061
- Check out my mad bum!
- Check it out.

690
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:13,499
Bum! There is!

691
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:16,759
- Do you like it?
- You kids got some skills!

692
00:41:19,156 --> 00:41:21,554
What did I tell you? You can
shooting be doing this!

693
00:41:21,649 --> 00:41:24,527
And besides, it's not safe
to be here at night.

694
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:27,211
It is now, dude bro,
you're the Sharkslayer!

695
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:32,389
- Sharkslayer?
- Sometimes I'd be coughing like that.

696
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,019
Look, I just need you off of these streets.

697
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:35,265
- Come on!
- Get your butts home!

698
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:37,471
Cause I know your moms,
and I'm just tell them you are doing bad.

699
00:41:37,471 --> 00:41:41,306
- Hey let's go make mister Sykes puff up!
- Yeah! Bye Oscar!

700
00:41:42,745 --> 00:41:48,306
- Lenny! Did you see what just hapened there?
- I know. They think you're the Sharkslayer!

701
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,553
As if!

702
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:55,115
- I appreciate your funky tone, actually.
- No, wait up! Hey! I'm sorry.

703
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:57,033
Seriously, I don't want you mad at me.

704
00:41:57,033 --> 00:42:00,197
And I certainly don't want you to 'slay me'!

705
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,306
You're having a good time, right?

706
00:42:02,306 --> 00:42:03,649
Are you enjoying yourself?

707
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:06,525
Well, for your information,

708
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:08,347
I am the Sharkslayer!

709
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:11,319
Oscar the Sharkslayer,
that's what they're saying!

710
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:14,676
- Wait, you mean you?
- Yeah.

711
00:42:15,347 --> 00:42:16,881
When the anchor...

712
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:22,251
- Oh, you're a liar!
- Hey, I didn't lie, all right?

713
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:24,073
Allright, I lied!

714
00:42:24,648 --> 00:42:27,045
But that was a little lie! Come on,
no one's was gonna be hurt anyway!

715
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:29,251
What am I doing? I'm not
gonna explain myself to you.

716
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,361
- You know what? You're on your own!
- No problem!

717
00:42:31,456 --> 00:42:35,579
And if god forbids, someone should, I don't know.

718
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:39,703
Find out the truth about the
Sharkslayer on my way back...

719
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:41,813
- You wouldn't!
- I would.

720
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:47,854
Come here!

721
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:51,689
Of course you can cup on me!

722
00:42:52,648 --> 00:42:54,853
But you know, I mean, you're a shark, right?

723
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:57,634
And I'm a Sharkslayer,
so we can't be seen together.

724
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:03,099
- You dig dug?
- Dig dug, dug dig. Dig dug, yeah!

725
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:05,497
- Yo, diggy dug!
- Just come on!

726
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:12,688
Okay Lenny, follow my every
move and don't make a sound.

727
00:43:12,784 --> 00:43:16,812
You got it. Wow, echo. Echo!

728
00:43:16,812 --> 00:43:18,538
Now, coming for the
south side sharks, I'm fifty.

729
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:20,743
Oh, it's not okay to hit!

730
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,893
- Get your bum in there!
- You think anybody heard that?

731
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:11,756
- Who is that? Ha? Who's that?
- Yo-hoo! Crazy Joe!

732
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:14,920
I thought I heard something!
Did you get that shark?

733
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:20,578
- You have no idea, Joe!
- That's great! Well, gotta go, my show's on!

734
00:44:26,523 --> 00:44:29,495
All right. We're safe. For now.

735
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:36,015
Hey a bed! Oh! Yeah,
that's good. That's heaven.

736
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,084
Snuggely buggley waggely!

737
00:44:40,618 --> 00:44:43,974
- I love you man!
- Wow, hold on!

738
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:49,440
- You're my new best friend!
- Stop it! Okay, you wanna be friends?

739
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,125
Fine, but we gotta lay down some rules.

740
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:57,111
Rule number one, no snuggely buggely,

741
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,796
whatever that just was!
- You got it. Anything else?

742
00:44:59,892 --> 00:45:03,056
Allright, rule number two!
And this is the most important rule.

743
00:45:03,152 --> 00:45:05,933
Any event, that possibly,
you know, you're hungry...

744
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:07,851
Don't worry, I'm not gonna eat anyone.

745
00:45:07,851 --> 00:45:10,823
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm different from the other sharks.

746
00:45:10,823 --> 00:45:13,988
Let's put it that way,
leave it at that. Good night!

747
00:45:13,988 --> 00:45:15,521
- Define different.
- You'll laugh.

748
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:18,014
- I'm not gonna laugh!
- Well that's just what you said,

749
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:19,741
and then what happens later? You laugh.

750
00:45:19,837 --> 00:45:21,467
Lenny, I give you my word.

751
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:25,782
Okay, I will tell you, I'm...

752
00:45:26,644 --> 00:45:28,275
I'm a vegetarian.

753
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:34,412
Hm, hold on.

754
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,343
So that's it?

755
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,644
- What do you mean that's it?
- I'm just...

756
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,083
You're first fish I've ever told!

757
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,767
I'm so tired of keeping that all a secret!

758
00:45:44,864 --> 00:45:46,398
- And my dad,
- Wow, hey!

759
00:45:46,398 --> 00:45:47,932
he'll never accept me for who I am.

760
00:45:47,932 --> 00:45:52,247
- What's wrong with me?
- Nothing is wrong with you, man.

761
00:45:52,343 --> 00:45:57,425
- I think all sharks should be like you.
- God, that sweet to say.

762
00:45:57,425 --> 00:46:00,301
And stop blaming yourself for what happened.

763
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:02,124
- Really?
- If you wanna blame anybody,

764
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:04,138
blame me. Cause if I hadn't been out there,

765
00:46:04,138 --> 00:46:06,055
in the first place, nothing of this would happen!

766
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:09,603
Yeah, if pop knew that,
he'd ice you for sure.

767
00:46:11,425 --> 00:46:14,110
Ice? Was that a godfather or something?

768
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,315
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, 'yeah'?

769
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,178
Yeah, he is.

770
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:21,301
Hey, are you all right?

771
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,096
GAME OVER

772
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,876
- Ha, man, I told you!
- I'm doing this!

773
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:31,657
Left circle double left square right
to the down square square.

774
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,862
Another square! Respect.
- Respect.

775
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,301
Oh yeah? Well I got some news for you!

776
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:37,506
The Sharkslayer made me
his manager, so I'm now...

777
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:40,671
what I like to call untouchable!
Did you hear me?

778
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:41,534
- Sykes!
- Okay.

779
00:46:41,534 --> 00:46:42,396
Hey Oscar!

780
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,191
- Sykes!
- Hey hey hey, there he is,

781
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:49,972
my brother, my player, the Sharkslayer!
- Yeah whatever, Sykes listen.

782
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:52,944
And another thing, from now on you're gonna
have to start paying me for protection!

783
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:56,780
Sykes, the deal is off, the shark
I killed was Don Lino's son!

784
00:46:56,876 --> 00:46:59,464
- I know! Any grade?
- Not if he finds out!

785
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:01,287
What do you mean find out? I've got
him on the phone right now!

786
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:04,163
That's right, Lino. I've got the
Sharkslayer right here in front of me!

787
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:10,971
- And he's gonna slay you and all of your sharks!
- Sykes, shut up! Shut up!

788
00:47:11,067 --> 00:47:12,697
Hey that's good. That's good, I like that.

789
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:14,998
Shut up, Lino! Shut up!

790
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:18,738
- What? Oh, kid, he wants to talk to you.
- I know, I'm not here! I'm not here!

791
00:47:18,738 --> 00:47:19,505
Yeah, he's right here.

792
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,628
- Hello.
- Shut up? Shut up?

793
00:47:23,725 --> 00:47:26,218
You don't tell me shut up,
I tell you shut up!

794
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,039
- What? Hello?
- Yeah, how you're doing?

795
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:31,492
Let me have a pie with everything on it.
Anchovies, meet balls, mushrooms...

796
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:32,546
- Luca!
- Oh, hi boss!

797
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:35,999
- What are you doing working in a pizza joint?
- Get off the phone!

798
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:36,861
But I'm hungry!

799
00:47:37,628 --> 00:47:40,313
My guys are coming for you, Sharkslayer!

800
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:42,999
They are going to tear you fin from fin!

801
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,971
Come on, now who's your puff daddy?

802
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:46,738
Who takes care of you?

803
00:47:47,505 --> 00:47:48,943
Come on you two, we've got work to do.

804
00:47:49,806 --> 00:47:52,395
- I was winning!
- Sykes, Sykes, hold, look!

805
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:54,505
- You got it all wrong!
- I've been writing songs about you kid!

806
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:56,998
- All the shark bites..
- Sykes.

807
00:47:57,094 --> 00:47:58,340
With his teeth dear.

808
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:00,833
- And then Oscar,
- Sykes!

809
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:02,847
- Kicked his butt!
- Sykes, Sykes, man!

810
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,532
- Come on!
- Maybe I can help?

811
00:48:06,108 --> 00:48:09,464
Hey! Lola! What are you doing here?

812
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:11,861
You pop it up sometimes in places!

813
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:13,778
Oh you said to wait, so...

814
00:48:15,216 --> 00:48:19,819
- I've been waiting.
- Look, I don't have a lot of time

815
00:48:19,819 --> 00:48:22,600
for a whole hand clappy making the life's go on

816
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,518
music playing and the guitar thing, you know.

817
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:28,449
- What are you afraid of?
- Afraid? That's funny.

818
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:30,271
I'm not afraid of nothing, it's just...

819
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:35,257
- Oh baby, you're so tense.
- Yeah, you know. I've really been stressed lately,

820
00:48:36,025 --> 00:48:38,518
like protecting the reef,
you know, I do that for myself.

821
00:48:39,956 --> 00:48:42,832
- It's just too crazy.
- It's just too much.

822
00:48:42,832 --> 00:48:45,038
Yeah, you know, just one
thing on top of the other.

823
00:48:45,614 --> 00:48:47,435
Actually I was thinking about retiring.

824
00:48:48,298 --> 00:48:49,928
- You don't wanna do that.
- I don't?

825
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:52,325
You have worked your way to the top.

826
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:56,449
You don't wanna go back
to the bottom, do you?

827
00:48:56,449 --> 00:49:03,257
- No. No, no way!
- You just show them who's boss.

828
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:05,654
And the sharks will leave you alone.

829
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:08,627
Yeah, you're right!
Lenny!

830
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:21,284
- Pss! Lenny! Where are you?
- Hello, Oscar.

831
00:49:21,955 --> 00:49:25,887
Angie! Hey! What are you doing here?

832
00:49:25,982 --> 00:49:27,612
What Oscar, did you forget something?

833
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:31,544
Oh maybe, you forgot your shark!

834
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:34,421
Hi.

835
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:38,640
Shark! Swim Angie! I'll cover you! Quick!

836
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,009
- Before it's too late! Go home without me!
- Oh stop it! Your friend shark here told me everything.

837
00:49:44,777 --> 00:49:48,612
- Lenny, why would you do that?
- I don't know, I like her!

838
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:50,434
Thank you, I like you too.

839
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,215
What were you thinking bringing him in here?

840
00:49:53,311 --> 00:49:57,530
- No, I just, I'm still working at the cakes.
- Cakes? You lie!

841
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:01,173
- Everybody thinks you're slayer of the sharks!
- Who am I gonna tell that they are wrong?

842
00:50:01,173 --> 00:50:05,872
- How could you lie to me, Oscar? Me?
- Don't take it personally. Come on, I lied to everybody!

843
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,283
All right. Look, I'm sorry. I totally betrayed you,

844
00:50:10,379 --> 00:50:12,009
but listen I got just one...

845
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,693
little problem I gotta take care of.
- Of what's that?

846
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:19,488
- Sharks are coming to get me!
- And they should!

847
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:22,078
I mean, what did you expect?
You just take credit for killing the shark

848
00:50:22,173 --> 00:50:24,858
and everything will be fine and
dandy for the rest of your life?

849
00:50:27,926 --> 00:50:28,789
Yeah!

850
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:32,625
But don't you worry about it.
Me and Lenny got it,

851
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,160
we go fix it!
- Wow, wow, wow.

852
00:50:34,255 --> 00:50:38,570
- What's with the 'we', I don't wanna 'we' part of this.
- Hey, too late now, vagie boy, they'll be looking for you too.

853
00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:42,118
- Point taken. What's the plan?
- Allright, just what we will do.

854
00:50:42,214 --> 00:50:46,721
Oscar! Here's the plan! You tell
the truth. And you go home!

855
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:52,857
Allright, look. This we're gonna do, right?

856
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:55,926
We will paint you up all bloody. Just mess, right?

857
00:50:56,022 --> 00:50:59,282
And you go swim out and meet
the sharks before they get here.

858
00:50:59,282 --> 00:51:00,241
And you will say stop!

859
00:51:01,487 --> 00:51:05,227
Don't go no further! This Sharkslayer's crazy man!

860
00:51:05,898 --> 00:51:09,063
He beat me senceless!
He's stone cold killer, man!

861
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:10,693
And then you can tell them I'm huge!

862
00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:12,131
You know, tell them that I'm handsome.

863
00:51:12,227 --> 00:51:18,748
- You're going way too far, Oscar!
- Acually he hasn't gone far enough.

864
00:51:18,844 --> 00:51:20,473
Exactly!
What?

865
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:24,980
You need slay a shark,
and I need to dissappear.

866
00:51:25,555 --> 00:51:26,802
This is what we're gonna do.

867
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,117
This is Katie Current, reporting live.

868
00:51:31,117 --> 00:51:32,747
We've got uncontrolled reports of...

869
00:51:32,747 --> 00:51:33,898
Shark!!!

870
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:44,254
Look, it's the Sharkslayer!

871
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:06,500
Holy microbe! Did we get that?

872
00:52:06,595 --> 00:52:08,322
Hey, Ange! Oscar's on the TV!

873
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:11,486
Show me that. Allright,
do what you do best.

874
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,143
Do you hear them, Lenny?
They are going crazy, man!

875
00:52:17,143 --> 00:52:19,253
- They love us!
- They love you, they hate me!

876
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:20,691
- What?
- Let's switch sides,

877
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:22,129
maybe I can be the Fishslayer!

878
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:24,239
- They'll never see it coming!
- Come on, man!

879
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,020
You saw this, you'll never
have to go home again!

880
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,554
You can start a new life!

881
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:30,376
- Now give me a growl!
- Okay.

882
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:43,417
- Like that?
- That was pretty good.

883
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:44,472
Let's go!

884
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:48,595
Is that what you're offering?
Do you understand how huge

885
00:52:48,691 --> 00:52:50,609
my client is? Turn on your TV right now!

886
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:55,403
Lenny, hold on! Lenny, Lenny!

887
00:52:58,951 --> 00:53:00,293
Turn off your TV! Turn off your TV!

888
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,677
- Don't swallow!
- Oscar?

889
00:53:07,773 --> 00:53:11,512
No, it's Pinnoccio. Of course it's me!
Why did you do that?

890
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:14,005
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Sorry, is when you step

891
00:53:14,005 --> 00:53:15,539
on somebody's fin at the movie theater.

892
00:53:15,636 --> 00:53:17,553
It is sorry. Sorry, is what you say,

893
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:18,991
Hey, where's the baby, dude?

894
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:20,526
And it turns out to burst is just fat!

895
00:53:20,526 --> 00:53:24,936
This is as far away from sorry,
as you could possibly get!

896
00:53:25,032 --> 00:53:30,690
- But Oscar! I think I'm gonna puke.
- No, no, no! Lenny, just open up.

897
00:53:30,786 --> 00:53:32,704
Nice and easy.

898
00:53:42,868 --> 00:53:46,032
- Are you not entertained?
- Go Oscar, man!

899
00:53:46,128 --> 00:53:49,100
- You can't handle its rule!
- Go get them!

900
00:53:49,196 --> 00:53:51,402
You had me at hello!

901
00:53:52,936 --> 00:53:54,950
Turn your TV back on! What are you doing,

902
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:56,100
turning your TV off? Turn it on!

903
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:16,429
This reef is huge. How we're supposed
to find the Sharkslayer?

904
00:54:27,936 --> 00:54:30,620
This is it, Lenny. Big finish!
Just like we practised.

905
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,730
- The flying fish?
- The flying fish!

906
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:37,332
Little more help here, body boy!

907
00:54:38,004 --> 00:54:39,921
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

908
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:02,839
Curse you, Sharkslayer!

909
00:55:17,797 --> 00:55:21,345
Yeah, and you tell Don Lino,

910
00:55:21,824 --> 00:55:25,757
that I don't never ever ever ever never!
Want to see another shark

911
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:28,441
on this reef again!
- Ever!

912
00:55:29,975 --> 00:55:31,798
Remember this name,

913
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:34,482
Oscar the Sharkslayer!

914
00:55:35,057 --> 00:55:36,879
Aha! You see? You see? Ha?

915
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:47,043
Look at Oscar! Oscar!

916
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,646
Hey, Lol...

917
00:55:52,893 --> 00:55:55,577
It seems that Sharkslayer not only
countered a few sharks today,

918
00:55:55,577 --> 00:55:59,317
but maybe a few hearts?
Has the reef's most eligible

919
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:00,563
bachelor have been snapped up?

920
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:04,879
I'm Katie Current. You're live watching
the Sharkslayer making out.

921
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,194
Hey Angie, can you hand me the blue one?

922
00:56:10,728 --> 00:56:11,783
Thank you.

923
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,331
Who steps in the room?

924
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,590
- Yeah!
- Oscar and Lenny!

925
00:56:18,686 --> 00:56:20,604
What a dream baby! Give me that!
Give me some fin!

926
00:56:20,892 --> 00:56:21,468
- High fin!
- Give me some fin!

927
00:56:21,755 --> 00:56:24,152
- Low fin!
- Did you see me? I was like...

928
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:29,522
- That was great!
- When you punched me, the crowd was...

929
00:56:30,672 --> 00:56:32,303
Yeah, the ate it up! Hey Angie, Angie

930
00:56:32,399 --> 00:56:33,933
you ain't know how Lenny had me in him, did you?

931
00:56:34,029 --> 00:56:36,330
- It was like an Oscar explosion!
- How good was I?

932
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,536
- Oh you was the ball!
- Thank you, thank you.

933
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:42,083
Hey, hey, hey! Casanova!

934
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:46,302
I saw your big finish on the news.
Nice smooch, lover boy.

935
00:56:48,412 --> 00:56:49,467
It was just private, just private.

936
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:54,165
- Private! The entire reef saw you do it.
- Hey, somebody's got a bad move.

937
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:55,412
Come on, Ange. Let me see the smile!

938
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,946
- Show me the smile, baby!
- Knock it off!

939
00:56:57,905 --> 00:57:01,740
- What is gotten in you?
- Me? I want, I swear! Sometimes I wanna

940
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,329
take your big dumb dummy head and just...

941
00:57:05,864 --> 00:57:09,219
- Ange, Ange, what is the problem?
- Problem? There's no problem, I'm not having problem!

942
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:11,329
Maybe it's probably because
you're the one with a problem!

943
00:57:11,425 --> 00:57:13,918
- Hey you guys?
- What have you got against Lola?

944
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:16,219
Not my lips, that's for sure!

945
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,576
- Okay, what's going on?
- I'm gonna stay out of this.

946
00:57:19,576 --> 00:57:21,877
Look, why would you even
care about Lola anyway?

947
00:57:21,877 --> 00:57:23,028
- I don't!
- You don't?

948
00:57:23,028 --> 00:57:23,987
- No!
- No what?

949
00:57:23,987 --> 00:57:26,192
- I don't know!
- You guys, you wanna get?

950
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,151
- No
- No!

951
00:57:27,151 --> 00:57:29,260
Just tell me, Oscar, cause I'm curious.

952
00:57:29,932 --> 00:57:33,479
Why do you think she's interested?
Do you think for one minute

953
00:57:33,479 --> 00:57:36,740
that she would even be with you,
if you want to reach a fame of Sharkslayer?

954
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,754
- Come on guys, please don't fight.
- Are you that light?

955
00:57:38,754 --> 00:57:42,397
- At least she treats me like I'm somebody!
- Yeah, but will she love you if you were nobody?

956
00:57:42,397 --> 00:57:44,986
- Nobody loved me when I was nobody!
- I did!

957
00:57:48,822 --> 00:57:51,603
Before the money, and before the fame,

958
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:57,644
before the lie! To me you were a somebody, Oscar.

959
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:02,534
Now you're nothing! But a fake. A shame.

960
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:06,465
- You're joker.
- Here I come!

961
00:58:08,575 --> 00:58:11,930
Sebastian, the way you'll washing dolphin!

962
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:23,725
- Angie.
- No, forget it! Just go!

963
00:58:24,397 --> 00:58:27,849
Cause I'm tired of hearing that everything
you had in your life wasn't good enough.

964
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:29,766
Including me.

965
00:58:38,492 --> 00:58:41,560
- Angie?
- Oh honey, I'm sorry.

966
00:58:42,711 --> 00:58:44,245
Go back and do it again.

967
00:58:47,506 --> 00:58:51,821
Hey, come on. It'll be okay.

968
00:59:16,943 --> 00:59:20,683
You can't have the lose!
You got shark breath!

969
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:22,601
'O' mints

970
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,915
'Coca cola'
'Get real'

971
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:46,190
What are you kids doing?
How many times I got to tell you?

972
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,738
This is past your bed time! Go on, all right.

973
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,189
Hey, hey, hey! What are you kids are...

974
00:59:54,244 --> 00:59:56,832
Well, it looks pretty good!
You guys should do this for a living!

975
01:00:25,503 --> 01:00:26,846
Preparation 'O'!

976
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:30,778
It slays hemorroids like Oscar slays sharks!

977
01:00:31,448 --> 01:00:32,982
Hey Oscar!

978
01:00:37,873 --> 01:00:40,942
Angie was right. I am a joker.

979
01:00:41,996 --> 01:00:45,832
Hey, Sharkslayer. Why are you in here?

980
01:00:45,928 --> 01:00:49,859
- All your friens are inside!
- Not all my friends.

981
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:52,449
You may not little bottom feeder
from the whale wash.

982
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,284
Forget about her. She's a nobody.

983
01:00:57,146 --> 01:00:58,394
I'm the nobody.

984
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:04,051
Oh let me guess. She told you that she loves you,

985
01:01:04,051 --> 01:01:05,297
is that it?

986
01:01:08,366 --> 01:01:09,996
It's not like you feel the same way about her.

987
01:01:18,914 --> 01:01:20,831
You know what? I don't think
this is gonna work out.

988
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,804
What? Are you dumping me?

989
01:01:28,214 --> 01:01:29,749
Let me explain something to you.

990
01:01:29,845 --> 01:01:31,858
We get party like at your birthday.

991
01:01:35,214 --> 01:01:36,365
Ha! Young love!

992
01:01:41,255 --> 01:01:42,214
CHOCOLATES

993
01:01:43,174 --> 01:01:44,228
FLOWERS

994
01:01:56,885 --> 01:01:58,995
- Hey Oscar!
- Hey, I can't talk, I gotta find Angie!

995
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,584
I need to tell her... I love her!

996
01:02:04,364 --> 01:02:05,995
Where you're going, Oscar?

997
01:02:05,995 --> 01:02:08,297
- Hi, whale wash.
- Give me the phone!

998
01:02:08,297 --> 01:02:12,036
- We'll you got a whale to wash and the price...
- Give me back the phone! And the price is...

999
01:02:12,515 --> 01:02:16,638
very very low. Consider no good washers!
- Good one, Ernie.

1000
01:02:16,735 --> 01:02:18,748
How many times do I have to tell you? It's gosh!

1001
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:21,337
You get a whale of a wash,
and the price - oh my gosh!

1002
01:02:21,432 --> 01:02:23,255
- All right, we get it man.
- Whale wash,

1003
01:02:23,255 --> 01:02:26,035
rhymes with gush!
- Give me that!

1004
01:02:26,035 --> 01:02:28,432
Get out of here, both of you.
Won't you use some place else, will you?

1005
01:02:28,528 --> 01:02:30,351
- Sykes? Where's Angie?
- You tell me!

1006
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,460
Whale wash, you got a whale of a wash... No?

1007
01:02:33,227 --> 01:02:34,473
- It's for you.
- Ha?

1008
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:37,351
- Hello?
- Is this the Sharkslayer?

1009
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:40,035
- Yeah, who is this?
- It's Luca the octop... I mean,

1010
01:02:40,035 --> 01:02:43,871
forget about it. Now you follow
these instructions, okay?

1011
01:02:43,966 --> 01:02:47,419
Fall cabinet, top drawer,
there's a package. Get it.

1012
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:51,446
That's right, tough guy,
we got your girl.

1013
01:02:52,405 --> 01:02:54,706
That is gonna be a sit-down. In one hour.

1014
01:02:54,706 --> 01:02:56,048
- Who is it?
- Shh!

1015
01:02:56,624 --> 01:02:59,788
Be there if you don't want
to see her sleeping with the fishes.

1016
01:03:01,226 --> 01:03:02,281
The bad ones.

1017
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:05,062
Now nod your head if you understand.

1018
01:03:07,747 --> 01:03:09,281
Now tell me if you nodded your head.

1019
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:11,295
I nodded.

1020
01:03:14,075 --> 01:03:16,377
They got Angie. And they want a sit-down.

1021
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,966
I never meant for anybody to get hurt,

1022
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:22,322
especially not Angie. This is all my fault.

1023
01:03:22,322 --> 01:03:24,528
That's a classic move. I've
seen it a thousand times.

1024
01:03:24,623 --> 01:03:27,596
They take the thing you love the most,
and then they use it against you!

1025
01:03:30,952 --> 01:03:34,021
Look, we gotta go to that sit-down,
and we gotta save her.

1026
01:03:34,117 --> 01:03:36,225
Wow, wow, wow. Look,
I wanna save Angie too,

1027
01:03:36,322 --> 01:03:37,760
but I can't just sit there and say,

1028
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,677
- Hi pap, I'm a dolphin!
- Lenny?

1029
01:03:39,773 --> 01:03:41,404
And my friend Sharkslayer, he is a fake!

1030
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:42,459
- Fake?
- Come on!

1031
01:03:42,459 --> 01:03:43,801
We're gonna need
a better plan than that.

1032
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:47,061
This is a joke, right? This is a joke?

1033
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:48,308
Because you know, I told Lino,

1034
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:50,417
Shut up, Lino! Shut up!

1035
01:03:52,527 --> 01:03:53,582
Tell me you didn't make it a low kid.

1036
01:03:53,582 --> 01:03:55,692
Tell me that's not Lenny. Tell
me you're a real Sharkslayer.

1037
01:03:55,787 --> 01:03:57,800
- Please!
- I'm sorry, Sykes.

1038
01:03:58,472 --> 01:03:59,143
I'm not.

1039
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:03,075
But the sharks don't know that.

1040
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,841
Would you stop screwing around? This will
never work. We're dead, we're dead!

1041
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:34,335
Sh! Thank you, Sykes. Thank you!

1042
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:38,841
My man Sykes has just begged me

1043
01:04:38,937 --> 01:04:41,718
not to murder you all up here, right?

1044
01:04:41,814 --> 01:04:44,786
Now I might listen to him.
But then I cannot might not.

1045
01:04:44,786 --> 01:04:47,567
And that depends on the individual behaviour

1046
01:04:47,663 --> 01:04:51,307
of all the individuals in here. Individuals.

1047
01:04:51,307 --> 01:04:52,457
Hey, is that right?

1048
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:57,731
- Look, he's got dolphine muscle.
- My uncle Will got wacked by one of those.

1049
01:04:57,731 --> 01:05:00,896
All right. Which one of you sorry
deans caled this meeting?

1050
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:02,909
That would be me.

1051
01:05:04,923 --> 01:05:09,142
So, this the Sharkslayer? I've been
looking forward to meet you.

1052
01:05:09,142 --> 01:05:12,978
I feel like we're practically family!
You know that's funny, ain't it?

1053
01:05:12,978 --> 01:05:17,005
I brought my kids into the
world. Full love and care.

1054
01:05:17,772 --> 01:05:20,936
And you took them out.
You know who I am?

1055
01:05:21,607 --> 01:05:22,950
Do you know who I am?

1056
01:05:23,717 --> 01:05:27,744
I'm the Don! The boss of the Great White sharks!

1057
01:05:27,744 --> 01:05:29,470
Hey boss, I saved your seat.

1058
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:33,113
I've been running this reef
since before you was born!

1059
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:35,703
And If you thought that guy like me,

1060
01:05:35,703 --> 01:05:38,388
can't get to a guy like you, guess what?

1061
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:40,689
You thought wrong!

1062
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:48,168
Man, you're the one who's wrong.
I barely know that girl.

1063
01:05:48,168 --> 01:05:51,141
- What her name was?
- Oh yeah?

1064
01:05:51,812 --> 01:05:53,346
Well I say he's bluffing.

1065
01:05:54,977 --> 01:05:58,908
- If I wasn't marry.
- How you're doing, pretty lady?

1066
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:04,757
- Lola! We meet again!
- You know, Sharkslayer,

1067
01:06:04,853 --> 01:06:08,209
there's only one thing
I like better than money...

1068
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,935
Revenge!

1069
01:06:11,086 --> 01:06:14,442
- Oh, I'm in love!
- Your shark slaying days are over!

1070
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:17,318
and there ain't nothing you can do about it.

1071
01:06:31,893 --> 01:06:32,852
Ha? What's so funny?

1072
01:06:33,524 --> 01:06:36,209
You got nothing! Nothing!

1073
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:38,222
Sebastian, take a roll!

1074
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:46,277
Can't touch this!

1075
01:06:48,578 --> 01:06:49,250
Can't touch this!

1076
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:53,660
Stop! Oscar time!
Okay!

1077
01:06:54,332 --> 01:06:56,249
New rules! Nobody!

1078
01:06:56,249 --> 01:06:59,318
I repeat, nobody makes
a move without my okay.

1079
01:06:59,318 --> 01:07:01,523
I am the pattern marker now baby!

1080
01:07:01,523 --> 01:07:04,400
From now on everything flows through me!

1081
01:07:04,495 --> 01:07:06,318
What did he do? What did he do? I can't see it!

1082
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:09,194
You don't lose a two, you don't
grow one back without my okay.

1083
01:07:09,194 --> 01:07:10,921
- Okay?
- Okay.

1084
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:14,468
If you sneeze, you don't white
dead boogie without my okay.

1085
01:07:14,468 --> 01:07:15,619
- Okay?
- Okay.

1086
01:07:15,715 --> 01:07:18,208
All right. And you don't say okay, without my okay.

1087
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,263
Okay?

1088
01:07:21,276 --> 01:07:23,961
Okay! Thank you all for coming,
good meeting, we gotta go.

1089
01:07:24,057 --> 01:07:27,701
And one more thing. What is with
all your living in a low boo?

1090
01:07:27,797 --> 01:07:29,522
- Oscar!
- That was supposed to be my

1091
01:07:29,618 --> 01:07:33,070
get yourselves a real high-down!
- Oscar.

1092
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:35,851
And take the good look, Lino. It's over!

1093
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:38,537
- Your old school!
- Oscar!

1094
01:07:38,537 --> 01:07:39,303
What?

1095
01:07:50,426 --> 01:07:51,961
Excuse me.

1096
01:07:51,961 --> 01:07:55,220
- Ange, are you okay?
- No! I am not okay!

1097
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,002
- He ate me!
- I had to take it.

1098
01:07:58,002 --> 01:08:00,686
- The taste was killing me!
- Lenny?

1099
01:08:02,029 --> 01:08:03,179
Is that you?

1100
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,125
You're alive?
I thought I lost you!

1101
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,001
What are you wearing, ha?

1102
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:13,056
What is that?

1103
01:08:28,877 --> 01:08:30,220
Hey boss, it's Lenny!

1104
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:32,809
He was wearing the disguise,
so we wouldn't recognize him.

1105
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:34,631
But now he's not wearing a disguise,

1106
01:08:34,631 --> 01:08:36,836
so we do recognize him!

1107
01:08:37,891 --> 01:08:39,808
- Hi pap.
- Are you kidding me?

1108
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,973
Are you kidding me?
Are you out of your mind?

1109
01:08:42,973 --> 01:08:44,891
Do you have any idea how this looks?

1110
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:47,768
This is the best sit-down,
I've ever been to!

1111
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:50,932
What are you doing with disguise?
You took out your own flash and blood!

1112
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:52,945
- Franki!
- Look pap, just listen!

1113
01:08:52,945 --> 01:08:56,110
It's not that, you never take
side against the family, ever!

1114
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:59,562
Hey Don Lino! Sir, listen!
It's not his fault!

1115
01:08:59,658 --> 01:09:02,630
- This is between you and me.
- What did I ever do to you!

1116
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:06,178
You took Franki away, and you've
turned Lenny into a dolphin!

1117
01:09:07,233 --> 01:09:08,288
I'm gonna get you!

1118
01:09:08,288 --> 01:09:12,603
- Oscar! Look out!
- Oscar! Swim! Swim for your life!

1119
01:09:20,274 --> 01:09:23,054
You're gonna regret the day
you became the Sharkslayer!

1120
01:09:25,356 --> 01:09:28,329
- Look who's talking in the pot hole!
- Ha?

1121
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:33,123
You're still hungry big guy!
Well say hello to my little friends!

1122
01:09:46,356 --> 01:09:47,698
- Try again.
- Whale wash.

1123
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:50,862
You get a whale of a wash
and a price. Oh my gosh!

1124
01:09:50,862 --> 01:09:52,876
All right, you got it right!

1125
01:09:52,876 --> 01:09:55,369
- You got it right.
- Move! Everybody everyway!

1126
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:10,040
Come on, Lino. It's time
to clean up your act.

1127
01:10:14,163 --> 01:10:15,793
Pap, leave him alone!

1128
01:10:23,368 --> 01:10:25,574
All right Lino! Game's over!

1129
01:10:32,574 --> 01:10:34,395
Lenny? What are you doing in there?

1130
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:36,122
- Sorry.
- Where's Lino?

1131
01:10:37,464 --> 01:10:40,053
- He's right behind me, isn't he?
- You're mine now!

1132
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,819
- Let's finish the Sharkslayer.
- Oh we're about to!

1133
01:11:22,627 --> 01:11:24,066
Thank you for coming to whale wash.

1134
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:31,737
Okay! Somebody needs to get me
out of the bubble. Today!

1135
01:11:34,038 --> 01:11:36,148
- Angie?
- The Sharkslayer has done it again!

1136
01:11:36,148 --> 01:11:37,010
- Hey!
- This time...

1137
01:11:37,106 --> 01:11:38,737
- Wait!
- glorying two sharks into his

1138
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,079
death trap of high gene.
- No!

1139
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:42,572
Oscar, you're the somebody,
everybody wants to be!

1140
01:11:42,572 --> 01:11:46,408
The top of the food chain!
Tell our cameras, how it feels to be you.

1141
01:11:46,408 --> 01:11:48,613
- Angie?
- Oscar, get me out of here, quick!

1142
01:11:48,613 --> 01:11:51,490
I need to get straight so I get
as far away as I supposed to.

1143
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,175
- Look what you did to him!
- No, it's all a big misunderstanding!

1144
01:11:54,175 --> 01:11:56,188
Sharkslayer, over here! One word
about you, Sharkslayer.

1145
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,654
- Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer!
- Stop!

1146
01:12:02,325 --> 01:12:06,832
I am not a real Sharkslayer!

1147
01:12:13,449 --> 01:12:16,517
- I lied.
- What?

1148
01:12:17,188 --> 01:12:20,256
And I'm not a real financial advisor!

1149
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:25,435
Okay, it was an anchor that killed Franki.

1150
01:12:26,106 --> 01:12:28,694
I didn't have anything to do
with it and neither did Lenny.

1151
01:12:28,694 --> 01:12:31,283
If that was true, why did you ran away?

1152
01:12:31,283 --> 01:12:33,873
I think you always wanted me to be like Franki.

1153
01:12:34,544 --> 01:12:36,941
I'll never be the shark you want me to be.

1154
01:12:37,613 --> 01:12:39,914
What is your problem?

1155
01:12:39,914 --> 01:12:42,407
So, your son likes calp? So?

1156
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:43,941
His best friends are fishes. So?

1157
01:12:43,941 --> 01:12:47,489
He likes to dress like a dolphin, so what?!

1158
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,037
Everybody loves him just the way he is.

1159
01:12:52,475 --> 01:12:53,338
Why can't you?

1160
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,229
Don't make the same mistake that I did.

1161
01:12:58,995 --> 01:13:02,256
I didn't know what I have. Till I lost her.

1162
01:13:08,392 --> 01:13:11,365
Will you get me out of this?
So I can hug my kid.

1163
01:13:11,365 --> 01:13:14,529
- And tell him I'm sorry.
- Pap!

1164
01:13:20,474 --> 01:13:21,338
Give me a hue.

1165
01:13:24,118 --> 01:13:27,762
I love you son, no matter
what you eat, or how you dress.

1166
01:13:29,392 --> 01:13:31,981
- Oscar?
- Angie?

1167
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:38,886
Angie...

1168
01:13:40,899 --> 01:13:43,296
I wish I knew now
what I knew then. I mean...

1169
01:13:43,296 --> 01:13:46,556
I wish you knew,
what I knew. I mean...

1170
01:13:46,556 --> 01:13:48,953
- Before this.
- You're blowing it, man!

1171
01:13:48,953 --> 01:13:49,913
Mind your business, all right?

1172
01:13:49,913 --> 01:13:51,734
I'm just emotional,
and there's pressure!

1173
01:13:52,693 --> 01:13:54,994
What I'm saying, I just...

1174
01:13:55,762 --> 01:13:57,679
I didn't mean the top of the reef.

1175
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:00,556
Everything I wanted was right there in front of me.

1176
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:02,186
The whole time.

1177
01:14:03,145 --> 01:14:05,447
What about being a somebody?

1178
01:14:05,447 --> 01:14:07,747
I'm nobody without you.

1179
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:18,967
You're not helping.

1180
01:14:21,364 --> 01:14:24,912
Oh, come here! You big dumb dummy head!

1181
01:14:29,802 --> 01:14:31,144
I've never told you till this, but

1182
01:14:31,144 --> 01:14:33,254
you're the best henchmen
and guides I ever had.

1183
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:34,692
Come on, group hug!

1184
01:14:34,788 --> 01:14:36,898
- Ah! Hey!
- Sorry man, sorry.

1185
01:14:36,898 --> 01:14:39,007
Come such, straight again
man, don't be afraid.

1186
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:40,542
Oh forget, the moment's gone.

1187
01:14:42,267 --> 01:14:45,815
So Lino, Don, we're cool, right?

1188
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:48,691
I mean like the reef is safe,
you know walk the streets,

1189
01:14:48,691 --> 01:14:50,705
you know without... you know?

1190
01:14:50,705 --> 01:14:52,911
Yeah, we're cool.

1191
01:14:55,596 --> 01:14:57,226
Oscar, excuse me, Oscar?

1192
01:14:57,226 --> 01:15:00,390
You've lost everything
you've lied so hard to achieve.

1193
01:15:00,486 --> 01:15:02,117
Tell me, what's next for you?

1194
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,144
Come on! Everyone's waiting!

1195
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:09,212
- Mister manager!
- Hey, I just gotta put

1196
01:15:09,212 --> 01:15:10,938
the finishing touch on my new desk.

1197
01:15:11,897 --> 01:15:12,760
I love you, pap.

1198
01:15:13,527 --> 01:15:15,253
- Yo, dog!
- Sykes!

1199
01:15:15,253 --> 01:15:17,171
All right partner,
let's see what you can do.

1200
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,403
Sykes and Oscar's whale wash
is now opened for business!

1201
01:15:25,034 --> 01:15:29,636
Yo E, B, let's get this party boomed!

1202
01:15:30,787 --> 01:15:33,088
The other wheels of steel!

1203
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,253
Yo Christina! Missy!
How about we have a low?

1204
01:15:36,253 --> 01:15:38,074
Oscar leashes furnal!

1205
01:15:57,348 --> 01:15:58,883
What's up with your bow? Let it go!

1206
01:16:05,882 --> 01:16:08,279
Hey Angie? Sorry papa and I are late,

1207
01:16:08,376 --> 01:16:09,718
but we brought some new customers!

1208

- Wow!

1209
01:16:12,786 --> 01:16:14,704

01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:19,211
What's up!

1212
01:16:28,224 --> 01:16:29,854
No, no snap it, snap it,

1213
01:16:29,854 --> 01:16:33,210
- I'm snapping, I'm snapping!

01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:34,265

1219
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:47,498
- Paint me out!
- Hey! You think you're smart?

1220
01:16:47,498 --> 01:16:49,512
What am I? A clown?

1221
01:16:54,018 --> 01:16:55,744
Keep going with me,

1223
