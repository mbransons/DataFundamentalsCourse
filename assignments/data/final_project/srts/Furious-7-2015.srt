1
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,604
They say if you
want to glimpse the future,

2
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,047
just look behind you.

3
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,930
I used to think
that was bollocks.

4
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,161
But now I realize

5
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,006
you can't outrun the past.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,162
When we were kids,

7
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,128
you'd start fights with the
toughest bastards in the yard.

8
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,367
But I was the one who
had to step in and finish them.

9
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,405
You'd steal from
the corner shop,

10
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,930
but it was me

11
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,042
who'd brave the
old man's belt.

12
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,848
I'd hoped you'd outgrown it.

13
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,804
That playing the gangster

14
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,571
made you harder,
smarter, better.

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,127
But deep down, I guess I always
knew you'd end up like this,

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,044
despite everything
I did teach you.

17
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,126
Still,

18
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,884
you're my flesh and blood.

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,249
So you remain
my cross to bear.

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,207
Rest now, little brother,

21
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,011
while I settle
your one last score.

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,691
You take care of my brother.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,689
Anything happens to him,

24
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,689
I'll come by looking for you.

25
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,605
Here. Hold this.

26
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,881
Grenade!

27
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,527
Come on, Dom.
So where are you taking me?

28
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,160
They say an open road
helps you think

29
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,841
about where you've been,
where you're going.

30
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,328
So you don't remember
any of this yet?

31
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,681
That's not fair.

32
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,320
You know I don't.

33
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,167
So what is it exactly that you're
trying to show me?

34
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,600
That.

35
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,201
Race Wars.

36
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,010
We used to come here?

37
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,161
"Come here"?

38
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,921
We invented it.

39
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,164
Keep it under 9,000 RPMs.

40
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,891
Kid's gonna fry his pistons
after the first 200.

41
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,240
You know that's not my style.
I gotta ride or die, right?

42
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,050
How about you just ride
on this one?

43
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,761
Are you ready?

44
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,766
I know you're ready!

45
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,120
Go!

46
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,202
Hey, nice job.

47
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,681
Hey!

48
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,521
That's the girl
I heard so much about.

49
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,648
Where you been at,
ghost girl?

50
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,760
<i>Ghost girl.</i>

51
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
Letty, what the hell?

52
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,281
Huh?

53
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,648
Damn, dawg!
Girl's still got that swing, homie.

54
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,641
You never could
take a punch.

55
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,686
Right, right.

56
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,330
Hey, man.
I'm glad you're back, man.

57
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,640
It's good to see you!

58
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,689
Good to see you, Hector.

59
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,721
All right.
We made it, Jack.

60
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,122
Yeah, we made it!
Yeah, we made it.

61
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,282
Now I just gotta find
that door button.

62
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,488
Buddy, where's the door
button at? Do you know?

63
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,721
Hi.
Hey.

64
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,962
Yeah, of course.
I'm new to this.

65
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,451
Yeah, you don't seem
like the minivan type.

66
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,601
No, not exactly.

67
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,761
Hey, buddy, you gonna
give me a high five?

68
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,365
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, high five!

69
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,771
All right. Yeah, buddy.

70
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Appreciate it. Thank you.

71
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Don't worry. You'll get
used to this in no time.

72
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,889
Yeah, that's what
I'm afraid of.

73
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,725
First time I saw this,

74
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,762
I thought
it was kind of funny.

75
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,807
I guess now
the joke's on me.

76
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,520
What are you doing?

77
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,289
What I should've done
a long time ago.

78
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,164
Stop it!

79
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,450
Look at it.

80
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,766
It's the truth.

81
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,603
That's the date
that I lost my memory.

82
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,684
That's the date
that Letty died

83
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,524
and I was born.
No.

84
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
You never died.

85
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,807
Do you know how hard it is
for me when you look at me

86
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,970
and you see me through
15 years of memories?

87
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,807
Every beautiful moment
we've ever had.

88
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,122
I see it in your eyes.

89
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,807
I can't give that to you.

90
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,209
I got nothing.

91
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,361
You got me.

92
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,763
And you've got
only a piece of me.

93
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,687
I have to find myself.

94
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,171
For me.

95
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,846
Goodbye, Dom.

96
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,208
You're disappointed,
aren't you?

97
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,530
What are you talking about?

98
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,006
The last arrest.

99
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,050
He was too easy.
Target didn't even run.

100
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,406
Ah, it's okay.

101
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,682
Gives me a chance
to hit the iron.

102
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,764
Also lets me work on
my stamping skills.

103
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,523
You're a terrible liar.

104
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,566
See you tomorrow, boss.

105
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,529
I'll see you then.
Don't stay too late.

106
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,523
I'll stay as long
as I want, woman.

107
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,444
I knew you would say that.

108
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,041
Elena?

109
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,244
What's this?

110
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,280
It's the letter of recommendation
you asked for.

111
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,806
Just know I meant
every word in there.

112
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,329
Thanks, Hobbs.

113
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,289
Thanks for everything.

114
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,890
Come on, way too sentimental right now.

115
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,041
Get home. Good night.

116
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,764
Okay. Good night.

117
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,726
Just one sec.

118
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,248
You sure as hell
ain't the IT guy.

119
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,400
So you better start talking

120
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,801
before I break that finger
six different ways

121
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,326
and stick it right where
the sun doesn't shine.

122
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,528
Agent Hobbs, right?

123
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,606
That's right.

124
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,083
I'm also the last
man on Earth

125
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,969
whose computer you want
to be hacking into.

126
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,289
You just earned yourself
a dance with the devil, boy.

127
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,801
You're under arrest.

128
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,082
I don't care about
your computer.

129
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,001
I'm here for the team
that crippled my brother.

130
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,965
There ain't no goddamn team.

131
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,601
It was just one man,
and he's standing right in front of you.

132
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,730
The lady was right.

133
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,845
You are a terrible liar.

134
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,485
Goddamn IT guys.

135
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,760
Hobbs!

136
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,686
On me!

137
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,090
Elena!

138
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,441
Hobbs?

139
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,001
Hobbs!

140
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,200
All right, buddy.
We gotta go.
We're gonna be late.

141
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,807
Come on.

142
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,049
Okay, what do you think?

143
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,009
Parking brake slide
right up to the school?

144
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Where's Mommy?

145
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,646
I don't know.
She's up there.
She's coming.

146
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,960
Oh.

147
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,481
Here we go.

148
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,047
Watch your head.

149
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,729
Dom, you have
a package out here!

150
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,331
It's from Tokyo.

151
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,845
Tokyo?

152
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,083
What? Is Han trying to convert
me over to a turbocharger?

153
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,446
All right, you ready?

154
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,567
There we go.

155
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,965
Yeah!
Hey, buddy.
Cars don't fly.

156
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,451
Hey, cars don't fly.

157
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,320
This one did, huh?

158
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,842
Brian in a minivan.
Things have changed.

159
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,242
He's struggling, Dom.

160
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,851
He doesn't
want me to see it,

161
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,402
but the white picket fence
is like an anchor on him.
I can tell.

162
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,810
I tried to talk to him the other night.
You know what he said?

163
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,681
He doesn't miss the girls,
he doesn't miss the cars.

164
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,366
He misses the bullets.

165
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,531
Let him settle in.
Give him time.

166
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,689
How does nine months sound?

167
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,807
I'm having another baby.

168
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,327
And you didn't tell him,
did you?

169
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,611
You gotta tell him.

170
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,810
I don't want him to be
disappointed with his life.

171
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,729
With me.

172
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,680
He will never be
disappointed with you.

173
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,411
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

174
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,527
Thank you.

175
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,401
Yeah?

176
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,606
Dominic Toretto.

177
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,281
You don't know me.

178
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,691
<i>You're about to.</i>

179
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,051
Get down!

180
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,001
Jack!

181
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,241
Jack!

182
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,886
Shattered his collarbone,

183
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,247
fractured his leg
in two places.

184
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,049
He only regained
consciousness this morning.

185
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,488
The first thing he said was,
"Get me Dom."

186
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,961
He's in there.

187
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,045
Are you okay?

188
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,523
I'm fine.

189
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,049
He's waiting. Let's go.

190
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,362
Got something for you.

191
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,286
Your files.

192
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,691
Thank you.

193
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,929
You risk life and limb

194
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,490
to save the free world
and what do they give you?

195
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,087
Jell-O and a bad
'70s TV show.

196
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,200
You know, it's got its perks.

197
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,203
- Sponge baths ain't that bad.
- Dad!

198
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,566
I'm sorry, baby.

199
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,483
"Dad"?

200
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,491
Honey, I want to introduce you
to somebody. He's a, uh...

201
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,320
He's an old friend.

202
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,640
Go on and say hello.

203
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,370
Dominic Toretto, right?

204
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,684
My dad said he
kicked your ass once.

205
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,888
Young lady,
watch your mouth.

206
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,847
Your dad's on
heavy pain meds.

207
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,081
I can understand if his
history is a little hazy.

208
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,128
I doubt it.
All right, honey, that's enough.

209
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,202
I want you to go get
something to eat with Elena

210
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,009
while me and Toretto
have a talk. You hear me?

211
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,844
Come on, lady.
Let's get some cookies.

212
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,570
Watch that mouth.

213
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,644
Who did this?

214
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,768
You remember Owen Shaw?

215
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,321
The one we tore half of
London down trying to get.

216
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,125
Well, this is his
big bad brother.

217
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,084
Take a look at this.

218
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,011
Deckard Shaw.

219
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,248
British Special Forces assassin.

220
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,129
The kind of unique asset

221
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,441
that no government would
ever admit to employing.

222
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,726
Black Ops boys.

223
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,167
Worse.
They created a monster.

224
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,482
They felt Shaw
was a necessary evil

225
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,483
until eventually

226
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,006
they decided he was unnecessary.

227
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,366
The powers that be

228
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,568
felt that he knew
just a little bit too much.

229
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,404
The asset became a liability.

230
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,490
So they sent in 20 elite
operatives to retire him.

231
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,080
And they missed.

232
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,207
That was six years ago,

233
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,884
and Shaw's been
a ghost ever since.

234
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,041
Until now.

235
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,084
How do I find him?

236
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,006
The official answer
is, you don't.

237
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,809
He killed Han.

238
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,720
Almost killed my family.

239
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,007
He also tried to put me
in a body bag, too.

240
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,766
Which is why when I get out,
I'm gonna put a hurt on him so bad

241
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,770
he's gonna wish his mama
had kept her legs closed.

242
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,286
But until then,
my official answer to you

243
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,086
is stand down.

244
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,402
Now, you know
I can't do that.

245
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,686
I do know you, Dom.

246
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,967
Which is why now I give you

247
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,929
the brother-to-brother answer.

248
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,083
You do whatever
it is you gotta do.

249
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,208
When you find that sumbitch,

250
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,090
just do me one favor.

251
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,844
What's that?

252
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,368
Don't miss.

253
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,488
Thank you so much
for letting us stay, Mando.

254
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,766
I hope it's not a problem.

255
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,003
Listen,
Dom needed a safe delivered
to Rio in two days.

256
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,081
That was a problem.

257
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,208
Hosting his family
in the Dominican Republic,

258
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,441
that is vacation.

259
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,010
Anyone messes with you here,

260
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,969
they mess with
the entire country.

261
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,326
You'll be safe.

262
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,048
Yeah, yeah, they're here.
I picked them up myself at the airport.

263
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,804
Hold on. Your brother.

264
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,881
Dom.

265
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,561
Yeah, Mia, it's me.

266
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,641
<i>How's it going there?</i>

267
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,051
We're at Mando's.

268
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,571
This place is like a fortress.

269
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,849
You should see Brian.
He's in full FBI mode.

270
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,163
He built a surveillance hub in
Mando's garage and everything.

271
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,962
<i>What about you?
Did you find out who's after us?</i>

272
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,850
Looks like the sins of London
have followed us home.

273
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,524
<i>How did Buster take the news?</i>

274
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,011
I can't tell him.

275
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,082
If he knew about the baby,
he'd stay here with us.

276
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,243
<i>And with all that's going on,
you're gonna need him by your side.</i>

277
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,324
Just watch out for
him. Keep him safe.

278
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,401
And come home together.

279
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,361
Tell Brian I'll see him
in LA in two days.

280
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,767
Where are you going?

281
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,365
Tokyo.

282
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,882
I'm bringing Han home.

283
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,128
<i>Authorities are still
trying to determine</i>

284
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,846
<i>the motive behind this daring
attack here at the office</i>

285
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,402
<i>of the US Diplomatic Security
Service in downtown Los Angeles</i>

286
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,245
<i>less than 36 hours ago.</i>

287
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,401
<i>Facts are still coming in,</i>

288
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,642
<i>but what is known
is the suspect entered</i>

289
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,371
<i>the building's fourth floor...</i>

290
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,771
Hey.

291
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,283
You okay?
Yeah.

292
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,802
This guy's just relentless.

293
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,482
That's why Dom needs you.

294
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,604
You two need to find this guy
and you need to stop him

295
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,445
before he does any more
damage to our family.

296
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,849
You know, I just...

297
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,367
I've screwed up
so many things.

298
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,083
I couldn't live with myself
if I screw this up, too.

299
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,641
You won't.

300
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,803
I believe in you.

301
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,169
I believe in us.
That's all that matters.

302
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,209
I love you, Brian.

303
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,326
I love you, baby.

304
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,607
Just promise me,
after this, we're done.

305
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,604
No more jobs, no more enemies.

306
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,364
Come back to us.

307
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,289
I won't let you down, Mia.

308
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,121
I know.

309
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,126
Hey, yo, Sean!

310
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,531
Hey, check this out, man.

311
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,728
This dude over here
want to race the new DK.

312
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,161
Not tonight, Twinkie.

313
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,966
Said he knew Han.

314
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,571
Han said you was fast,
but not that damn fast.

315
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,887
Who said American
muscle can't drift?

316
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,882
Han mentioned he left his
enemies in his rearview.

317
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,370
He never talked
about it much.

318
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,405
Always playing it
close to the vest.

319
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,449
We found a couple
things by the crash.

320
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,286
Wasn't much left.

321
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,441
Gisele.

322
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,044
Oh, yeah.

323
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,084
There's one more thing.

324
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,922
I found this.

325
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,081
Must have meant
something to him.

326
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,562
When you find the guy
that killed Han,

327
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,451
what are you going to do?

328
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,323
Words ain't even
been invented yet.

329
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,247
They say to live in the hearts
of those we leave behind

330
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,842
is not to die.

331
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,526
But he put you in this grave.

332
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,161
So now I'll do
the same to him.

333
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,326
I can't do no more funerals.

334
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,921
First Han.

335
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,411
Now Hobbs is laid up,
of all people.

336
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,525
We're being hunted.

337
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,486
You know he's out there
somewhere watching, right?

338
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,366
I hope so.

339
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,330
Means he's close.

340
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,848
Just promise me, Brian,

341
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,930
no more funerals.

342
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,566
Just one more.

343
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,607
His.

344
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,202
You never should have
messed with a man's family.

345
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,964
I told your brother
the same thing.

346
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,291
Reinforced your chassis.

347
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,521
It's like going into a ring
with weighted gloves.

348
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,840
Your mistake.

349
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,005
I'm not here to play games.

350
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,322
See, you and me,
we're from different worlds.

351
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,170
Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner
streets than the ones you're used to.

352
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,641
Stick around.

353
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,040
It's gonna get a lot meaner.

354
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,682
You thought this was
gonna be a street fight?

355
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,285
On the ground.

356
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,841
Now!

357
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,650
Drop him
or I will drop you!

358
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,010
Whoa, whoa. Easy, guys.
We're on the same team here.

359
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,520
Mr. Toretto,

360
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,650
I'm here on the recommendation
of a mutual friend of ours.

361
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,484
Mr. Hobbs.
Who the hell are you?

362
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,289
Me? I'm just a guy.

363
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,124
I'm Mr. Nobody.

364
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,002
It's a big entrance
for a nobody.

365
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,842
And the guy that put our
mutual friend in the hospital?

366
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,080
You just let him get away.

367
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,847
I think I might have just saved
your ass there, Dom.

368
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,201
Listen, you think you could
let go of my guy there?

369
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,601
He's beginning to
turn a little blue.

370
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,760
I appreciate that.

371
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,005
Ah, here they come.

372
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,081
Listen, Dom.

373
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,121
There's a war going on between
shadows and ghosts like me.

374
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,524
You and your team unwittingly
walked into the middle of it in London,

375
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,967
and it appears it's
now followed you home.

376
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,285
It's up to you.

377
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,047
I'm gonna have a beer.

378
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,171
You're welcome to join me.

379
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,084
By the way, I can
get you Deckard Shaw.

380
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,245
Belgian ale.

381
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,691
Oh, man, those
monks got it right.

382
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,683
I mean, I don't know about
the whole celibacy thing,

383
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,762
but when it comes to beer...

384
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,681
Would you like one?

385
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,084
I'm more of a
Corona man myself.

386
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,241
Ah.

387
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,806
Your file's not
only detailed,

388
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,248
it's, uh,
extremely entertaining.

389
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,209
Look, Shaw's power
is that he's a shadow.

390
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,363
He's really good at getting in and
out of places without being seen

391
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,522
and leaving nothing but a
body count in his wake.

392
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,127
I mean, he's a legitimate
English badass.

393
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,123
But to be honest with you, Dom,
I don't give two shits

394
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,884
about Deckard Shaw.

395
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,325
It's you I want.

396
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,450
Because you and I can help
each other get what we both need.

397
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,091
I'm listening.

398
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,731
Just recently a private
military company

399
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,690
led by a wanted terrorist
named Mose Jakande

400
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,286
kidnapped a hacker known
only by the name "Ramsey."

401
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,441
Now, Lady Liberty's
got her panties

402
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,249
in a bunch over this,
but rightfully so,

403
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,210
because this Ramsey has created
something interesting.

404
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,165
- Bring it up.
- Yes, sir.

405
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,930
Say hello

406
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,491
to God's Eye.

407
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,405
Now, this little bastard hacks into
anything that's on the digital network.

408
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,166
That means every cell phone, satellite,
ATM machine and computer.

409
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,447
Simultaneously.

410
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,329
If it's got
a microphone or a lens,

411
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,129
God's Eye can find you.

412
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,646
So you invited me here to
show me a tracking device.

413
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,768
On steroids. Lots of them.

414
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,444
Let me put it
to you this way.

415
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,131
It took us nearly a decade
to find Osama bin Laden.

416
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,567
With this, we'd have located him
anywhere on the planet

417
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,201
in a couple of hours.

418
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,806
Now, that's a serious
piece of machinery

419
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,803
that could be catastrophic
in the wrong hands.

420
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,288
But for some very nauseating
political reasons,

421
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,646
any rescue plans involving

422
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,610
any US government
forces or entity

423
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,648
has been strictly ruled out.

424
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,764
And that's why I need you.

425
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,522
But why do I need you?

426
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,882
I mean,
I could go back outside,

427
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,928
enjoy the rest
of the Coronas,

428
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,049
let Shaw come to me.

429
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,851
You could do that.
How's that working out for you so far?

430
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,967
You got one friend
in the ground,

431
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,280
another one in the hospital.

432
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,681
And then, of course,
there's that little issue of the bomb

433
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,888
that destroyed your home.

434
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,890
Shaw lives in a
world that doesn't

435
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,883
play by your rules.

436
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,681
Like it or not,

437
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,161
you live in that
world now, too.

438
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,168
You wanna know
how to kill a shadow?

439
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,567
You just shine
a little light on it.

440
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,324
If you get the
God's Eye for me,

441
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,004
I've already got authorization

442
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,327
for you to use it
until you get Shaw.

443
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,368
You go from the hunted
to the hunter.

444
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,761
And there's no place on Earth
Shaw can hide from you.

445
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,684
More importantly,

446
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:40,563
you and your family don't
go to any more funerals.

447
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,206
You get Ramsey,
you get the God's Eye,

448
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,646
you get Shaw.

449
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,486
Well, that's the wind-up
and the pitch.

450
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,881
Now that I've given you
this incredibly sensitive

451
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,406
and highly
classified information,

452
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,000
what do you think, Toretto?

453
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,443
I think you already know
what I'm gonna do.

454
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,040
Good.

455
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,931
But it'll be my way.

456
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,801
And my crew.

457
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,928
I assumed you
might say that.

458
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,727
Which is why I've taken the
liberty of gathering your team.

459
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,322
This is crazy.

460
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,245
What the hell is
going on in here?

461
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,200
Our intelligence
suggests that Ramsey

462
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,049
will be transported
by an armed motorcade

463
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,884
through the Caucasus
mountain range.

464
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,088
If they clear this range
and reach their destination,

465
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,889
Ramsey is as good as gone.

466
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,086
So let me
get this straight.

467
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,731
There's only one road
that leads in or out,

468
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,848
sheer drops on every side,

469
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,571
a motorcade from hell
protected by a small army

470
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,165
from one mile in
either direction?

471
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,802
Yeah, that's about it.

472
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,005
You done?
No, I'm not done.

473
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,210
So you all wanted me
to break into

474
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,884
a police station. Fine.

475
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,010
Then you asked me
to stop a tank.

476
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,924
I wasn't happy about it,
but I did it.

477
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,162
Then you came up with
this brilliant idea

478
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,687
to shoot down one of
the largest airplanes ever.

479
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,331
I shot that shit
out of the sky. Mmm.

480
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,841
It's nothing.

481
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,205
But this right here,
my friend,

482
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,566
happens to be

483
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,008
the stupidest idea I've ever
heard of in my life.

484
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,208
I forgot that you were the only one
to bring the plane down.

485
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,440
No, no. The only thing I've
ever seen him take down was

486
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,641
"No Knees" Denise.

487
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,529
Remember, at prom?

488
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,648
Really, Brian?
You're gonna do that right here?

489
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,286
See, y'all trying to
get me off my point.

490
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,489
All I'm saying is,
I'm tired of everybody around me

491
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,642
making all the decisions.

492
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,210
This time, I lead.

493
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,523
Seriously. If I don't start
making decisions, I'm out.

494
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,364
All right, Roman.

495
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,086
What do you got?

496
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,965
I mean, I wasn't trying to get into
the whole leadership thing, like, now.

497
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,405
You know what I'm saying?

498
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,640
I was just, kind of, talking about,
like, at some point.

499
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,806
Like, you know, when we...

500
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,769
Whatever. I mean, I think...

501
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,806
Let's hit it from here.

502
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,121
I don't think that that's...
No, no, no, don't think.

503
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,089
That's my job.

504
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,521
Okay.

505
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,488
It is impossible
to hit it there.

506
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,803
That is literally the most
secure spot on the mountain.

507
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,326
Why? Because you cannot
physically access it.

508
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,648
See, that's what
makes it so sweet.

509
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,326
Because it's the place that they
least expect us to hit them from.

510
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,050
As much as
I hate to admit it,

511
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,160
he's onto something there.

512
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,606
What do you think, Dom?

513
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,405
- Here?
- Yeah.

514
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,446
I think we got a plan.

515
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,325
Completely wrong thinking.

516
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,447
And I like it.

517
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,242
You see? I'm good at this.

518
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,922
"Good"? Okay.

519
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,720
How are you planning
on getting on that road?

520
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,289
Well, Tej?

521
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,881
I think I may actually
have a plan for that.

522
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,128
What? I delegated.
That's what good leaders do.

523
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,441
Leader!

524
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,568
You know, when I was
reading your files,

525
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,881
I was impressed with what you've
accomplished with your team.

526
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,601
But meeting them now,
I've gotta say, Dom,

527
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,044
you've truly got a gift.

528
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,607
Consider my workshop
your new playhouse.

529
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,810
I think you'll find our
cars extremely appealing.

530
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,649
And your team is now complete.

531
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,284
I went to the house.

532
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,162
I was looking
for you everywhere.

533
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,562
You scared the
shit out of me.

534
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,002
<i>You will never be alone.
Wherever you go...</i>

535
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,844
<i>Tell no one.</i>

536
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,289
Where did you find that?

537
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,520
Found in Han's car.

538
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,565
It was left as a message.

539
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,530
A message I plan on returning.

540
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,086
Can you ride?

541
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,810
Yeah, of course I can.

542
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,167
Han was my family, too.

543
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,571
Brian!

544
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,802
We're gonna need
long-travel suspension,

545
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,928
limited-slip differentials
on all of them.

546
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,201
How you doing?

547
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,961
Tej!

548
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,328
I want the demon
love child between that

549
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,850
and that.

550
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,365
That's a lot of armor.

551
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,010
It's just gonna
add more weight.

552
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,491
Slow you down.

553
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,840
This time, it ain't
just about being fast.

554
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,605
Yeah, I'm good.

555
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,960
From the streets.
You know what I'm saying?

556
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,607
It's nothing.

557
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,927
Hey, Roman,
you're freaking out, ain't you?

558
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,451
No.
Yeah, you are.

559
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,847
I said no.

560
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,443
Listen, man, it takes a grown man
to embrace his feelings.

561
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,087
<i>If you need to cry,
just go ahead and cry.</i>

562
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,685
As your friend, you know I'm
concerned about your well-being,

563
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,091
<i>which is why I took
the precaution</i>

564
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,005
of putting some adult diapers
in your glove compartment.

565
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,320
Yo, can you just
chill out, man?

566
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,849
<i>I have seen
some crazy shit, Dom,</i>

567
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,604
but this really
could make some waves.

568
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,401
So let's just try to keep it
as low-key as possible, huh?

569
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,641
Don't I always?

570
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,327
<i>I'll tell you what, you knock it down
a couple of notches this time</i>

571
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,370
and I'll swap out my Belgian
for a keg of Corona.

572
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,922
You'd be doing
yourself a favor, there.

573
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,881
Can somebody just walk me through
what we're supposed to be doing?

574
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,406
Come on,
Rom, this is your plan.
You gotta embrace it.

575
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,925
No, this was not my plan.

576
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,080
Oh, yeah, here we go.
Game time.

577
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,649
<i>Roman,
you need some fresh air?</i>

578
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,520
Because you're about to
get a whole lot of it.

579
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,128
Okay, here we go!

580
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,325
Just when you didn't think
it could get any better, huh?

581
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,850
Oh, shit!

582
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,481
Whoo!

583
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,401
Now we're moving.

584
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,843
Everybody good?
Everybody make it out?

585
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,722
You just didn't tell them
that this is not for you!

586
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,126
This is not your mission!

587
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,521
Hey, Rom? Hey, what's up, man?
Talk to me, come on!

588
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,289
- I can't do it.
<i>- The hell you can't!</i>

589
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,850
Come on, man!
You throw that thing

590
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,604
in reverse and get
your ass out here now!

591
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,967
Look, I can't do it, okay?
Listen to what I'm saying.

592
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,121
Now isn't the time!

593
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,565
<i>I'ma stay up here
with the pilot.</i>

594
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,484
We gonna circle
around and make sure

595
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,846
we holding it down
from up here!

596
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,320
You're running out of time!

597
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,568
The chute is guided by GPS!

598
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,809
<i>You don't have
to do anything!</i>

599
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,530
Tej!
I'm already on it.

600
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,491
<i>Hey, man, listen.</i>

601
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,005
I'm sorry to
let y'all down, okay?

602
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,531
I'ma go ahead
and stay up here.

603
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,601
<i>No, brother.</i>

604
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,205
I'm sorry to let you down.
What?

605
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,241
What do you mean you're...

606
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,602
Tej! What are you doing?

607
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,249
Oh, shit!

608
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,767
Tej!

609
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,084
I hate you, Tej!

610
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,287
Get ready!

611
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,766
Ground's coming fast!

612
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,602
Come on, baby. Come on.

613
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,406
Oh, yeah!

614
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,321
Touchdown, baby!

615
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,240
Car check. Call it in.

616
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,401
Check.
Check.

617
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,527
I'm good. Let's do this.

618
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,847
Hello? Please, man.
Get me out of here, somebody!

619
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,401
No! The trees!

620
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Oh, shit.

621
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,770
Sit tight, Roman.
We'll come back for you.

622
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,330
This is not the plan!

623
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,610
All right,
you got one chance
to hit them here, Dom.

624
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,724
You miss, they'll make
it to their black site

625
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,127
and they'll squeeze whatever
information they need out of Ramsey.

626
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,124
<i>The device and your chance of ever
getting Shaw will be gone for good.</i>

627
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,326
That ain't gonna happen.

628
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,411
I'll see you at the pickup.

629
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,680
Ramsey will be in the bus.

630
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,921
Then let's do this.

631
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,368
Captain, we have company.
Four cars, inbound.

632
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,721
Oh, shit!

633
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,165
Tej, shield!
I'm on the way.

634
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,241
All right, formation.

635
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,286
Bulletproof, baby.

636
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,362
<i>Can't touch this</i>

637
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,121
Punch it!

638
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,250
Strike! Ha-ha!

639
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,891
Guns free.

640
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,681
No!

641
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,601
Get out of the way!

642
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,722
Those aren't guns,
those are goddamn cannons!

643
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,086
Armor-piercing rounds!

644
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,441
Hook them up.

645
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,730
Brian, Tej, blow it!

646
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,001
Lock it up.

647
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,081
Huh?

648
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,329
Brian, you're up.

649
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,201
Little closer, Tej!

650
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,521
Ramsey?

651
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,246
Stay away from me!
Stay back!
Don't you touch me!

652
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,765
My name's Brian.
I'm gonna get you out of here

653
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,365
but I'm gonna need you
to settle down, all right?

654
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,920
I'm gonna cut those
things off of you.

655
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,361
Sir?

656
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,040
Sir, we have an unidentified
vehicle approaching.

657
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,131
Come on! Closer!

658
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,645
- You're gonna have to jump.
- No! No! No!

659
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,080
We don't have time!
Come on!

660
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,529
We gotta get out of here.
Come on.

661
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,170
Look at me!
Look at me!
I'm not jumping!

662
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,971
You don't jump,
we're gonna die. Okay?

663
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,807
You're jumping. Come on!

664
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,120
One.

665
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,531
Two!

666
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,405
Well, well, well.

667
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,726
Take my hand!

668
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,131
Welcome to the
party, Mr. Shaw.

669
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,049
<i>Letty, stay with Brian.</i>

670
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,321
Oh, shit!

671
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,682
What are you doing?
This is crazy!

672
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,006
Keeping you alive.

673
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,322
There's a cliff. Cliff!

674
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,046
Cliff! There's a cliff!

675
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,881
Shit!

676
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,801
Too slow.

677
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,769
Yeah!

678
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,321
I'm back, bitches!

679
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,481
You good?

680
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,765
Thank you.

681
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,163
Roman, get back to the others.
What about you?

682
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,651
Don't worry about me.

683
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,326
I have to say,
I am impressed.

684
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,608
I would very much like to
know the name of the man

685
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,126
Who is causing me
so much trouble.

686
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,561
There's no way out of there.

687
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,801
What is he doing?

688
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,769
He's frozen like a damn
deer in headlights.

689
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,649
Toretto ain't no deer.

690
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,445
Come on, Dominic.

691
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,729
Give us the girl,
and I'll let you live.

692
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,924
What are you going to do?

693
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,844
You might wanna put on
your helmet for this one.

694
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,441
Helm...

695
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,881
Target the driver.

696
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,809
Damn it!
What is he thinking?

697
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,725
You're insane!

698
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,922
You're pointing the wrong way.

699
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,161
Am I now?

700
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,851
Fire on my mark.

701
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,449
Interesting.
Three!

702
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,808
Two!
Hold on.

703
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,041
One!

704
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,326
Fire!

705
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,527
Looks like our
demon love child worked.

706
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,364
That's one way
down a mountain.

707
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,645
Where's Ramsey?

708
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,970
Hello Kitty is awake.

709
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,488
She don't look like
a hacker to me.

710
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,961
Oh, yeah? And what do
hackers look like?

711
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,048
They don't supposed
to look like that.

712
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,720
I'm just saying, like,

713
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,404
you know how they
normally wear them little,

714
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,323
weird glasses
that's all crooked,

715
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,887
and pimples all over their
face from drinking soda?

716
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,084
I mean, trust me,
with a body like that,

717
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,969
you ain't gonna park it
behind a computer.

718
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,440
How are you feeling?

719
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,010
Did you hit your head?

720
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,406
Feeling nauseous?
Ears ringing? No?

721
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,449
Where's my shoe?

722
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,010
Oh, it flew off
when you crashed.

723
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,803
If you start experiencing any of
those things, let me know, okay?

724
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,326
I don't know whether to
thank you for rescuing me

725
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,562
or kick your ass for
throwing me off a cliff.

726
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,402
Thank us or kick
our ass, huh?

727
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,921
How about you tell us
where that device is?

728
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,928
I mailed it to a friend.

729
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,081
In Abu Dhabi.

730
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,450
That was pretty easy.

731
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,440
That other team would have
tortured you for that information.

732
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,529
I didn't trust them.
I trust you.

733
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,002
Now, why would you trust us?
You barely know us.

734
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,725
I know enough.

735
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,524
Ex-cop. Military,
something like that.

736
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,890
The way you took out
them guys shows training.

737
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,926
Tech guy, offended by the hacker remark,
naturally.

738
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,085
Alpha.

739
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,530
Mrs. Alpha.

740
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,241
Joker

741
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,721
Wrong.

742
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,283
Double alpha.

743
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,522
Man candy. You know
what I'm saying?

744
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,761
Man, sit your
candy ass down.

745
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,402
The disrespect is
real around here.

746
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,929
Life is binary.
Zeroes and ones.

747
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,162
Only two things keep
a group like this together.

748
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,969
Fear or loyalty.

749
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,051
And I don't see a drop
of fear among you guys.

750
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,646
Very impressive.
Just one thing.

751
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,880
They're not married.

752
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,320
She's so off, it's crazy.
You just gonna roll with it?

753
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,926
You're telling me there can't be
a double alpha in one group?

754
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,081
You work for US government?

755
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,124
We got similar interests.

756
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,882
Tej, call it in.

757
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,322
We're going to the Middle East!

758
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,601
Hey.

759
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,886
Hey, Dom.
It was pretty wild on that mountain, huh?

760
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,929
No, it was too close.

761
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,726
But we got the job done.

762
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,082
You know what
the crazy thing is, is...

763
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,891
You miss the bullets.

764
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,482
Yeah, that's messed up, huh?

765
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,404
Brian, I've seen you
jump from trains, dive from planes.

766
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,728
Hell, I saw your courage
the day I met you.

767
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,286
Right.

768
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,526
Want to know the bravest
thing I ever saw you do?

769
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,285
Be a good man to Mia.

770
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,164
Being a great father
to my nephew, Jack.

771
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,929
Everyone's looking
for the thrill,

772
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,800
but what's real is family.

773
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,125
Your family.

774
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,409
Hold on to that, Brian.

775
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,684
It's hotter than I
thought it would be.

776
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,770
Yeah, well, we are in the desert,
so it would be hot.

777
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,480
Oh, no, I ain't talking
about the weather.

778
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,645
My, my, my.
Hmm.

779
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,525
Now, that is a woman

780
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,001
that's worth falling
out a plane for.

781
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,730
Get out of there, man,
I got dibs on that.

782
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,801
You've seen me
looking at that.

783
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,564
Did you just say "dibs"?

784
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,766
What are you, in
the fourth grade?

785
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,410
Man, can you
just get out of there?

786
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,606
I mean,
it's a free market.

787
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,126
What are you talking about?
Get out of there.

788
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,690
Rock, paper,
scissors for her.

789
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,330
Are you guys for
real right now?

790
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,126
Look at you.

791
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,971
You both look
whupped already.

792
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,166
You got stalker eyes.

793
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,643
I tried to call dibs
on Ramsey two years ago.

794
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,121
Her knee, my balls.

795
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,648
Trust me,
you don't wanna do that.

796
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,041
Hey! Ramsey!

797
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,045
Hello, Safar.

798
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,845
I see you make
some new friends.

799
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,922
Yeah, some short-tempered
new friends.

800
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,685
I need the speed drive
I sent you. Where is it?

801
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,525
Oh, good. You will be
pleased to know I sold it.

802
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,886
You sold it?

803
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,166
You hear that?

804
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,571
I asked you to
take care of it.

805
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,005
Why on earth
would you sell it?

806
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,607
We're gonna need it back.

807
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,761
Impossible.

808
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,203
Safar, I stashed something inside it.
It's important.

809
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,850
Okay, Okay.

810
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,127
Uh, good news. It is safe.

811
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,285
And the bad news?

812
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,002
It is very safe.

813
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,129
I sold it to a Jordanian
prince living up there.

814
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,531
Trust fund billionaire.

815
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,171
Said he wanted to use
it for his supercar.

816
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,727
Now, see, this?

817
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,450
This, I like.

818
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,931
Billionaire, supercar...

819
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,764
What makes it so super?

820
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,411
242 miles per hour,
top speed.

821
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,450
And it's bulletproof.

822
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,931
242...

823
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,841
Am I the only one
aroused right now?

824
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,928
It's, like, you know
what I'm saying?

825
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,640
Whatever.

826
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,364
Where does he keep it?

827
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,281
In his penthouse.

828
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,930
Tower number one.

829
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,240
Now, why in the hell would he
keep his car in his penthouse?

830
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,441
He's a billionaire,
my friend.

831
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,807
He can do whatever he wants.

832
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,611
Now, tomorrow happens to be
the longest day of the year.

833
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,806
The prince wants to celebrate it

834
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,769
and host a party
tomorrow afternoon.

835
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,171
So you can get us
up there, right?

836
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,571
Sure.

837
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,530
But, uh,
not dressed like that.

838
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,201
What?

839
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,045
Is something wrong?

840
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,360
There's a billion things wrong.

841
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,964
But not in this moment.

842
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,010
You look handsome.

843
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,131
I feel awkward.

844
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,364
You and me both.

845
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,204
Just seeing you
dressed like this

846
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,761
just reminds me of something.

847
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,566
Of What?

848
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,761
Old times.

849
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,800
You okay?

850
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,164
Yeah. I'm fine.

851
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,801
Showtime.

852
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,090
No, no, no. Listen, man.

853
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,242
They're telling me they
party like this every day.

854
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,084
On this level,
they party every day.

855
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,920
This is crazy. I might
have to move out here.

856
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,324
I think I'm gonna start a new culture.
It's called Blarab.

857
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,805
You know,
like "black Arab."

858
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,370
How are we looking, Tej?

859
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,521
<i>We're almost in position.</i>

860
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,569
Okay, so this is
how it works.

861
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,688
<i>We got to move in sync
if we're gonna pull this off.</i>

862
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,091
<i>So let's go over
it to make sure</i>

863
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,282
<i>everyone clearly
understands their roles.</i>

864
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,964
Roman, that means you.

865
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,560
You know what, you're being real
unprofessional right now, Tej.

866
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,563
The God's Eye chip
is hidden in a speed drive

867
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,721
installed in the prince's car,

868
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,529
which he keeps in
a safe room vault.

869
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,523
I make 8 to 10
plainclothes security.

870
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,887
Not to mention the prince

871
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,363
and his personal bodyguards.

872
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,205
Security cameras are clustered by the north wall.
That's where the vault is.

873
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,170
We got to get in that vault,
we got to tap into the security system,

874
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,969
<i>which can be accessed
in the prince's bedroom.</i>

875
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,200
All right, guys,
I'm going in.

876
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,481
Excuse me.

877
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,211
Oh, I was just
looking for the...

878
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,004
The party is that way.
What?

879
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,366
This room is off-limits.

880
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,680
<i>Now,
once we're tapped in,</i>

881
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,166
<i>Ramsey and I can hack into
the network and pop the door</i>

882
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,685
<i>so you can get in
and get that shit.</i>

883
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,410
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
You missed a step.</i>

884
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,642
What about my steps?
What am I supposed to be doing?

885
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,245
No, we didn't miss anything.

886
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,448
<i>You're special teams.
So when we need you,</i>

887
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,806
do what you do best.

888
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,166
And that is?

889
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,089
Shine brightly like only
Roman Pearce can do.

890
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,161
Ha-ha.

891
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,243
See? Now we talking.

892
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,731
All right, Tej, I'm in.

893
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,847
All right,
find the phone jack.

894
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,285
The tap always
runs behind that.

895
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,489
It's gonna be a
350-megahertz CAT5e cable.

896
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,562
<i>They probably got
a couple dozen back there,</i>

897
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,760
but this will be the bonded pair
with the plenum coat.

898
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,001
English, Tej.

899
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,241
It'll be the orange wire.

900
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:14,841
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

901
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,649
we are in the pilot seat.

902
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,284
<i>All right, Roman.</i>

903
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,283
Do whatever it is you do.

904
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,288
It's your birthday, right?

905
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,691
Are you Jasmine?

906
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,047
Oh, God, no.
Not the birthday routine.
<i>Take my hand.</i>

907
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,566
Happy birthday to you.
This way, this way.

908
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,722
Excuse me, so sorry.
I'm coming through, sorry.

909
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,280
Right this way.
Listen, excuse me one second.

910
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,167
My brother, my brother.
Man, you ain't supposed to...

911
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:42,765
Sir, thank you so much.

912
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,049
All right, listen, people.
Please, everybody, gather around.

913
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,009
Understand something, right now.

914
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,491
Listen to what
I'm telling y'all.

915
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:54,045
We are here to celebrate
Jasmine's 18th birthday.

916
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,043
Happy birthday, my dear.

917
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,809
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

918
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,644
<i>To you</i>

919
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,368
<i>To you</i>

920
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,326
Oh, I wish I didn't see that.

921
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,764
Ramsey,
open it up for us.

922
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,842
Copy that. You're in.

923
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,400
Do you realize
what this is?

924
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,124
Lykan HyperSport.

925
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,366
$3.4 million.

926
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,602
Zero-to-60 in less
than three seconds.

927
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,284
There's seven of these
things in the world,

928
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,885
and this guy keeps it
locked up in a vault.

929
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,965
Nothing's sadder than locking
a beast in a cage.

930
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,408
And now I really want
to punch him in the face.

931
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,886
Okay.

932
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,006
Let's get to work.

933
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,840
You got this, right?

934
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,041
Go.

935
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,167
Would you believe I knocked
him out with my charm?

936
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,562
You ain't
that charming, bitch.

937
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,330
No, no, no!

938
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,482
Tej, your magic trick is failing.
We're losing systems.

939
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,560
I know.

940
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,080
I see it.

941
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,360
Tej, talk to me.

942
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,920
I'm trying,
but their security system
is locking us out.

943
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,640
All right, listen,
ladies and gentlemen...

944
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,808
Oh, there he is.
These are your dancers?

945
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,086
This is a party, baby!

946
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,562
Some of y'all probably
went to the bathroom

947
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,722
and noticed that all
the hairspray was missing.

948
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,450
Yep. She did it.

949
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,401
Thank you.

950
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,090
And we're so happy
for you to be here.

951
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,084
You look like you got some
missiles underneath that dress. No?

952
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,561
He did not just...
Did you just say that?

953
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,650
Oh, shit! Not the gate!
Not the gate!

954
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,009
Brian, faster!

955
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,491
<i>We're playing all
the defense we can up here</i>

956
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,642
but we're gonna lose.
You gotta hurry up.

957
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,483
Thank God you showed up.

958
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,369
These parties
bore me to death.

959
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,161
Aah!

960
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,685
Guys, get out of
there right now.

961
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,640
You've got an army
heading your way.

962
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,530
Brian, get out! Forget it!

963
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,640
Tej, we're taking the car.

964
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,886
This is what I do.
You know what I'm saying?
As far as I'm...

965
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,726
My man, what's...

966
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,481
Letty?

967
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,403
Letty, talk to me.
Are you okay?

968
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,884
<i>Guys, I can't hold it.
I'm losing the final gate.</i>

969
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,041
You gotta get out of there.

970
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,923
Tear out the dash!
Go through it.

971
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,084
Wait, wait, wait. Now,
just hold on, man.

972
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,089
Time to unleash the beast.

973
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,481
Let's go!

974
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,280
Stay with me,
I got you.

975
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,520
Let's get the hell
out of here.

976
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,440
Dom, cars don't fly!

977
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,090
Cars don't fly!

978
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,241
Holy shit!

979
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,289
No brakes!
What?

980
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,529
No brakes!
Shit!

981
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,325
No, no, no!

982
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,811
No!

983
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,401
Oh!

984
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,091
Got it!
Get out!

985
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:13,920
Still miss the bullets, Brian?

986
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,806
Ah! There they are.
Disaster. I'm sorry.

987
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,010
I get you an invite to the most
exclusive party in Abu Dhabi.

988
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,247
Safar...
No, no, no.

989
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:06,564
You steal the host's car,
and you jump it between two buildings.

990
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,370
Actually, it was three buildings.
Oh!

991
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,682
Two, insult. Three, honor.

992
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,881
My bad.

993
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,525
Well, well, well.

994
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,920
I have to say,

995
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:19,961
you've got an interesting interpretation
there of "low-key," Mr. Toretto.

996
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,763
You know, Dom,
I thought we had an understanding.

997
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,522
Sometimes you have to play
the hand you're dealt.

998
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,002
That's why I prefer
to be the dealer.

999
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,041
Good night.

1000
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:35,961
Ah!

1001
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,369
I'm being kicked out of my own garage.
This is great.

1002
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,561
Uh, may I?

1003
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,920
Brian,

1004
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,246
give it to him.

1005
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,841
All that trouble
for this little

1006
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,767
thing.

1007
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,770
With all due respect, Dom,

1008
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,764
you really did
great work back there.

1009
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,126
All of you.

1010
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,209
All of my men
are now standing by

1011
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,324
and are fully
at your disposal.

1012
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,646
Your call.

1013
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,321
Ramsey.

1014
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,442
Fire it up and
find me Shaw.

1015
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,204
Oh, damn, this is crazy.

1016
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,207
Thank you.

1017
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,811
All right,
give me a second.

1018
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,201
What is it doing now?

1019
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,811
It's hunting.

1020
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,600
Hacking into the security
cameras at Etihad Towers.

1021
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,360
That's the last place you saw Shaw,
so that's where we'll start.

1022
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,089
That's him, right there.

1023
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,371
Wait, wait. What are these
numbers right here for?

1024
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,604
It's bio-mapping Shaw's face.

1025
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,280
It'll run it
against every camera.

1026
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,889
<i>Every audio device
in this hemisphere.</i>

1027
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:33,041
Bingo. Looks like
he's holed up here.

1028
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:34,801
<i>That's perfect.</i>

1029
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,247
Automated factory, no people,
lots of places to hide.

1030
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,761
You just changed the face
of manhunts forever.

1031
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,090
Congratulations.

1032
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,286
Hey, can I check
my email real quick?

1033
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,442
Dawn's up in two hours.

1034
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,121
We're gonna go
take down Shaw then.

1035
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,409
Go get changed.

1036
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,125
We should go now.

1037
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,969
Just you, your team, and me.

1038
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,481
I thought you said at dawn.

1039
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,686
My guys are racers,

1040
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:10,410
the best drivers
in the world.

1041
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,045
But they ain't killers.

1042
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,850
Told you he'd say that.

1043
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,082
I know you too well, Dom,
and I'm going with you.

1044
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,004
Well, looks like we got
a nice little hunting party.

1045
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,564
Let's go bag a shadow.

1046
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,448
Ten klicks out, boys.
Get ready to rock and roll.

1047
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,569
Here we go. Weapons hot.

1048
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,129
You ready for this?
Yeah.

1049
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,289
I hope you're enjoying
your last meal.

1050
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,001
This is it?

1051
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,169
This is all I warrant?

1052
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,769
A dozen men?

1053
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,081
I think you'll find
it's more than enough.

1054
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,082
I'm ready
to meet my maker.

1055
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,526
Are you?

1056
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,968
What were you expecting, Toretto?
To catch me off guard?

1057
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,923
Me standing here,
waving a white flag?

1058
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,965
You ever heard the saying,

1059
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,610
"The enemy of my enemy

1060
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,486
"is my friend"?

1061
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,408
I don't have friends.

1062
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,800
I got family.

1063
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,566
Well, I got a lot of friends.

1064
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,568
Two-two formation!
Sheppard, peel one!

1065
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,166
Brian, leave it!

1066
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,281
Get down!

1067
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,361
I got you.

1068
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,164
God's Eye.

1069
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:36,244
You didn't really think I was
gonna walk in there naked, did you?

1070
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,244
You got hit bad.

1071
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,370
Look, Toretto.

1072
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,327
I know you won't listen to me.

1073
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,651
You're not gonna want to
hear what I have to say.

1074
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:51,041
But the truth is,

1075
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,850
you really ought to

1076
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,886
try that Belgian ale, man.

1077
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,042
It's something special.

1078
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,049
Belgian ale, huh?

1079
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,122
Hey, we gotta get
you to a hospital.

1080
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,520
No, you're not.

1081
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,804
I carry my own
health insurance.

1082
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:13,565
SOCM medics on standby.
They're already inbound.

1083
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,484
Pull over, kid.

1084
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,723
Dom,
you gotta protect Ramsey.

1085
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,723
As long as she's alive,

1086
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,841
she can lock them out of God's Eye,
and they know that.

1087
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,209
That means they're not gonna
stop coming until they've got her.

1088
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,210
And this time,
when they come

1089
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:46,204
they're gonna come
with everything they've got.

1090
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,561
I'm not leaving you.

1091
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:48,766
You're not.

1092
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,208
I'm leaving you.

1093
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,283
Go now, Dom.

1094
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,321
A war is coming to us,
whether we like it or not.

1095
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,887
If a war is coming,

1096
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:20,082
we're gonna face them on
the streets we know best.

1097
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:28,124
I'm all for winging it,
but this is crazy, man.

1098
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:31,409
We got mercenaries with
some real heat on us.

1099
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,440
I mean, I ain't scared
or nothing, but...

1100
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,326
Man, I don't
even have a gun!

1101
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,240
Gun?

1102
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,090
We got a whole city.

1103
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,561
And we may have more than that.
If they use God's Eye,

1104
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,047
it'll tap the cameras around
town to find our location.

1105
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,721
Which means we could
plant a virus.

1106
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,042
And then break in
when they access it.

1107
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,927
So you're talking about
hacking my hacking device.

1108
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,286
It's brilliant.

1109
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,050
Yeah, but there's
one problem.

1110
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,406
The signal strength.

1111
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,803
We can't start a hack on them
until they're within a two-mile range.

1112
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,004
- That's really close.
- Close?

1113
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,247
These guys are military.

1114
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,767
If they're within two miles of us,
we're already dead.

1115
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:12,369
I don't know about y'all,
but I didn't really plan on dying today.

1116
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,488
Only one way
to stay alive.

1117
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,806
We play keep-away with Ramsey.
What?

1118
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,320
They can't hit
us if we keep moving.

1119
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,243
And I'll take Shaw.

1120
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,920
So, basically,
we're just gearing up

1121
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,280
for a big game of
hot potato, huh?

1122
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,481
Which car is the potato?

1123
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,760
Girl,
you're the potato.

1124
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,600
Why does it feel like
I'm not gonna see you again?

1125
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,969
I'll come back for that.

1126
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,520
Promise?

1127
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,245
Promise.

1128
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,928
- Brian, are you okay?
<i>- Mia, listen to me.</i>

1129
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,883
Something's about to go down.

1130
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,167
<i>And if you don't hear
from me in 24 hours,</i>

1131
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,451
I need you to take
Jack and move on.

1132
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,091
You understand?

1133
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,760
<i>You understand what I'm saying?</i>

1134
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,689
No, I can't do that, Brian.

1135
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,604
<i>No, I can't.</i>

1136
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,087
We're gonna have another baby.

1137
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,011
It's a little girl.

1138
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,320
<i>And she's going to
need her father.</i>

1139
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,607
So you have to finish
what you're doing

1140
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:48,160
<i>and you have to
come home to her.</i>

1141
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,091
You have to
come home to us.

1142
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,161
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
tell you before.</i>

1143
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:58,401
I was scared you'd be
disappointed with domestic life.

1144
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:04,166
You know,
the best decision I ever made
was stepping into the store

1145
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,411
and buying that first sandwich.

1146
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,167
It was such a bad sandwich.

1147
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,090
I know, right?
But I ate a lot of them.

1148
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,041
Uh...

1149
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,644
I love you, Mia.

1150
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,601
Don't do that.

1151
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,006
What?

1152
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,161
<i>The way you said it.</i>

1153
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,049
It's like goodbye.
Say something else.

1154
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,689
Okay. Kiss Jack for me.

1155
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,320
I will.

1156
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,809
I love you, Brian.

1157
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:54,605
I love you, Mia.

1158
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,640
One last ride.

1159
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,283
Boot up God's Eye.
Find them.

1160
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,327
I'm getting something.

1161
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:58,970
I got a positive ID.
It's Toretto.

1162
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,488
God's Eye is placing him
at Hill and Seventh.

1163
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:07,966
Should we follow him?

1164
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:10,009
No. Let Shaw
take care of him.

1165
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,207
Find Ramsey.

1166
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,281
Yes, sir.

1167
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,560
I don't know why we
gotta keep driving around like this.

1168
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,204
Why can't we just
pull over somewhere,

1169
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,931
park, gather our thoughts in, like,
a bunker somewhere?

1170
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,604
Because it does not
work like that.

1171
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,649
We gotta stick close
enough to the bad guys

1172
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,848
in order to get in range
for Ramsey to hack them.

1173
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,764
But we gotta be mobile enough
not to get shot like fish in a barrel.

1174
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,360
So, do me a favor,
focus on the mission

1175
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:37,811
and keep us from
getting killed.

1176
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,329
Got her. Target acquired.

1177
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,289
She's riding shotgun
in a blue GT-R.

1178
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,601
Guys, they're here.

1179
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,121
How many cars?

1180
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:55,247
Uh, none.

1181
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,044
<i>And that's kind of the problem.</i>

1182
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,969
Okay, let's give them the tour.

1183
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,166
Break on my mark.

1184
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,322
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

1185
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:10,566
Go!

1186
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:15,805
Splitting up won't work.

1187
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,644
Can't hide from God's Eye.

1188
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,601
They're in range.

1189
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:24,365
Ramsey, start the hack.

1190
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:25,851
Initiating.

1191
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:27,761
Now.

1192
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,282
Sir, I think someone's trying
to hack the system.

1193
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,201
It's Ramsey.

1194
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:35,566
Send in the Predator!

1195
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:36,881
Take her out!

1196
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,809
Releasing Predator.

1197
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,646
I think we lost the chopper.

1198
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,648
I think we got
bigger problems than that!

1199
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,965
Oh, my God.

1200
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,081
What are you doing?

1201
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:27,287
We're going old school!

1202
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,001
Watch out!

1203
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,680
It's coming back around!

1204
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,526
Predator's back on him.

1205
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,604
- Ready missiles!
- Roger that.

1206
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,680
Fire!

1207
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,761
Oh, shit!

1208
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:23,085
Football's hot!
I need to lateral!

1209
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,366
Rom, where are you?

1210
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:25,805
Running back charging in!

1211
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,727
Meet me on Third and Spring.
You got it!

1212
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,041
I'm halfway there.

1213
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,326
Grab your computer!
Get in the window!

1214
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,606
Why?
Do it! Now!

1215
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,331
You gotta go! Right now!

1216
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,171
Fire!

1217
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:21,801
Come on!

1218
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,045
Hit!

1219
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:46,601
He made it!

1220
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,450
I can't believe
we pulled that off.

1221
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,763
Wait, wait, wait.
We're still being hacked.
What?

1222
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,683
God's Eye is
still tracking Ramsey.

1223
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,250
Keep the drone
in pursuit of her.

1224
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:03,000
The signal has to be
coming from somewhere.

1225
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:42,725
<i>Back to throw.
Here comes the blitz.
Number 94 sacks him!</i>

1226
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,167
<i>Breaking news
out of Los Angeles tonight.</i>

1227
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:48,164
<i>In what can only be described
as vehicular warfare,</i>

1228
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:50,049
<i>police are engaged in
a high-speed pursuit...</i>

1229
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,485
I got it. They're
piggybacking the hack

1230
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,000
off that satellite
tower right there.

1231
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:57,565
Take it out!

1232
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:10,247
Toretto.

1233
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:21,440
Wait. What happened?
We were almost there.

1234
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,802
They've cut the signal!
I can't finish the hack!

1235
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:24,881
What do you mean?

1236
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,365
Brian, they took out the tower!

1237
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:35,891
Dad,
what's going on?

1238
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,530
Daddy's gotta go to work.

1239
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:57,801
All right, baby girl.

1240
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,689
Elena's gonna be here
in a little bit.

1241
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,080
You know our drill.

1242
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,491
Give me three for the road.

1243
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,248
You thought this was
gonna be a street fight?

1244
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,729
You're goddamn right it is.

1245
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,207
There has to be another way.

1246
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,691
Wait. I'm seeing
half a dozen

1247
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,888
<i>cell towers between
Sixth and State.</i>

1248
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,200
Brian, if you can
get to the top

1249
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:33,844
<i>of any one of those
buildings around there,</i>

1250
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,127
we can reroute the signal
manually and finish the job.

1251
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:37,201
I'm on it.

1252
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,646
Sir, did you hear that?

1253
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:43,722
O'Conner is on foot,
heading for a repeater.

1254
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,245
He's going to try to
reinitiate the hack.

1255
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,400
Keep the drone on the girl.

1256
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:48,841
Kiet,

1257
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:51,040
<i>O'Conner's on foot somewhere
between Sixth and State.</i>

1258
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:52,771
Don't let him make it there.

1259
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:08,961
Them boys is on us!

1260
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,565
Man, them boys
ain't ready for this!

1261
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:16,806
Shit!

1262
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,288
First the tank,
then the plane.

1263
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,646
Now we got a spaceship?

1264
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:40,921
That's not a spaceship,
that's a drone!
Oh, it's a drone?

1265
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,843
Now, you gonna break it down
and be articulate

1266
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:44,809
like you already know
what the hell is going on?

1267
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,609
Shut your ass up
and drive the car!

1268
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,004
Letty, the football's
on fire!

1269
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,081
We need help!

1270
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,807
Hang on! I'm coming!

1271
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,811
Ramsey, get ready to go again!

1272
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,768
Drone has missile lock.
Fire!

1273
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:51,721
Target destroyed.

1274
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:57,811
<i>Let's see if we have a connection.
If I can get back in...</i>

1275
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,126
Wait, wait, wait!
God's Eye still has her.

1276
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,326
How can that be?

1277
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,803
Get up. Come on!

1278
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:18,880
Let's go! Let's go!

1279
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:25,081
They switched her under the bridge.
What?

1280
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,606
Gotta get out of here.
It's on your trail and it's coming fast.

1281
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:31,681
Got it.

1282
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,445
So, if this car goes down,
who's coming to save us?

1283
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,761
Save us, honey?
We're it.

1284
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:37,841
Where are they now?

1285
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,291
Six blocks east,
hauling ass.

1286
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:41,840
Where are we
headed, Tej?

1287
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:44,087
<i>There's a service elevator
past the maintenance sector.</i>

1288
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:46,288
<i>It'll take you
directly up to the repeater.</i>

1289
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,805
<i>Brian, you gotta hurry!</i>

1290
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:49,766
Too slow!

1291
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,401
It's coming back!

1292
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:07,680
We'll lose them in the tunnel.

1293
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,285
Got it.
Fire!

1294
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,645
I can't shake this thing!

1295
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:33,643
Predator has missile lock.

1296
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,285
Take it out!

1297
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:02,447
No way.

1298
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,291
Wait! What happened?

1299
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:18,041
Sir, someone just
double-tapped our drone.

1300
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,201
What?

1301
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:22,844
Hey, did you bring
the cavalry?

1302
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:26,160
Woman, I am the cavalry.

1303
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,321
Of course you are.

1304
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:30,606
Who is that?

1305
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:35,120
That's Hobbs.

1306
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:45,086
I'm at the repeater.

1307
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,400
The access cable's in the base.

1308
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:49,565
<i>Just plug it into your phone and
Ramsey will be back online.</i>

1309
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:52,361
Ramsey, go!

1310
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:58,529
Brian did it. We're back in!

1311
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,046
We've got God's Eye back.

1312
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:13,761
We lost the God's Eye!

1313
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,331
What? Shit!

1314
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,681
Military's inbound.
Three minutes and closing.

1315
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:24,240
We need to get
the hell out of here.

1316
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:28,204
Tej, Roman, I'm on my way!

1317
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:29,960
All right, homie,
I'll see you there.

1318
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,964
I have eyes on Toretto.

1319
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:40,561
Shaw is in the way.

1320
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,087
Then it seems our
friendship is at an end.

1321
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:44,921
Do it!

1322
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:02,285
Thing about street fights,

1323
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:06,683
the street always wins.

1324
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:36,523
Goodbye, Toretto.

1325
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:47,042
Take him out!
Take down the bastard!

1326
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,001
This son of a...

1327
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:13,806
No!

1328
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:16,170
Duck!

1329
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:19,289
I need some help over here!
We're getting nailed!

1330
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:21,369
<i>I need some backup!</i>

1331
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,091
No! No! Son of a bitch!

1332
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,685
He's getting away!

1333
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,285
No! Stop him!

1334
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:34,087
Don't miss.

1335
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:08,721
Dom!

1336
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:56,243
Come on, buddy.

1337
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,647
Is he breathing?

1338
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,802
I want you to keep his head
tilted up, all right?

1339
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,411
Keep it back like this.

1340
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:09,040
Pinch his nose,
keep his head tilted.
Breathe into him, now. Go.

1341
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,001
Good. Come on, Dom.

1342
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,329
Come on, Dom. Come on!

1343
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:15,289
God damn it!
You come on! You breathe!

1344
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:16,771
Go, go! Breathe.

1345
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:18,000
Come on. Damn it. Let's go.

1346
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:21,840
Come on, Dom,
I need you to breathe.
Come on! Come on, Dom!

1347
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:23,331
Come back! Come on, buddy.

1348
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:24,731
Stop it.
Dom, come on! Come on!

1349
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:25,801
Back off!

1350
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:27,211
Will you stop?
Breathe into him.

1351
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,203
Get off of him!
You breathe into him!

1352
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:31,004
Back off!
You breathe into him!

1353
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:32,491
Back off!

1354
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:34,766
Please.

1355
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,205
Dom.

1356
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,011
Dom, baby. I know
you're hurting right now.

1357
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:43,371
But I want you to listen.
Stay awake

1358
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,805
and focus on me.

1359
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,046
I remember everything.

1360
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,604
It came to me like a flood.

1361
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,322
<i>I remember that night
in the Dominican Republic.</i>

1362
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,130
The night we got married.

1363
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,806
Oh, my...

1364
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:18,961
Will this do?

1365
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:25,167
We have eternity in this moment.

1366
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,651
You will never be alone again.

1367
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:31,326
I vow wherever you go, I go.

1368
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:32,925
You ride, I ride.

1369
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:34,844
You fight, I fight.

1370
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,367
And if you ever die on me,
Dominic Toretto,

1371
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:39,120
I'm gonna die with you.

1372
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:45,367
<i>I love you, Letty.
I will always love you.</i>

1373
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:48,731
If you die, I die.

1374
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:53,761
And I'm not ready to
leave this place yet.

1375
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:57,570
This moment is still ours.

1376
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:04,682
I remember everything.

1377
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:07,044
I remember it all.

1378
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:11,202
It's about time.

1379
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,525
Why didn't you tell me
we were married?

1380
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:39,888
Because you can't tell
someone they love you.

1381
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,331
Holy shit.

1382
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:20,289
You sure you brought
enough backup with you, Hobbs?

1383
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,325
Oh, they ain't mine.

1384
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:24,930
They're here to protect you

1385
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,763
from me killing your ass.

1386
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,651
You do know none of this
will keep me, right?

1387
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,049
Well, once you dig through
38 feet of concrete and steel,

1388
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:57,966
my fist and a body bag will be
waiting for you on the other side.

1389
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:00,802
So I suggest you
get to digging, boy.

1390
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,521
Whoo-hoo!

1391
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:39,365
Daddy! Come play.

1392
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:40,767
Yeah.

1393
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:42,524
Look at him. Look at him.

1394
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:46,201
Yeah, buddy.

1395
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:49,370
- Duty calls.
- It does.

1396
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:50,441
Hey, babe, come on.

1397
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:52,923
Let's get Mama. Yeah!

1398
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,121
Here we go.

1399
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:57,647
Because the sun is out,
I'm kind of medium rare,

1400
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:01,406
but I can get,
like, well done.
Like, really dark.

1401
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:03,881
What you nudging me for?

1402
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:05,530
Close your mouth
for two seconds.

1403
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,407
Just open your eyes, man.

1404
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:14,046
Beautiful.

1405
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:17,768
That's where he belongs.

1406
02:07:18,240 --> 02:07:19,890
Home.

1407
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:22,970
Where he's always belonged.

1408
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:30,891
Things are gonna
be different now.

1409
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,001
One more time.

1410
02:07:57,560 --> 02:07:59,562
You aren't going
to say goodbye?

1411
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:13,287
It's never goodbye.

1412
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:18,606
<i>It's been a long day</i>

1413
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:21,122
<i>Without you, my friend</i>

1414
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:27,244
<i>And I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again</i>

1415
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:30,451
<i>We've come a long way</i>

1416
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,281
<i>From where we began</i>

1417
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:38,924
<i>Oh, I'll tell you all about
it when I see you again</i>

1418
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,931
<i>When I see you again</i>

1419
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:48,804
<i>First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong</i>

1420
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:50,120
<i>And what's small
turn to a friendship</i>

1421
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:51,731
<i>A friendship turn into a bond</i>

1422
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:53,245
<i>And that bond
will never be broken</i>

1423
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,970
<i>The love will never get lost</i>

1424
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:57,082
<i>And the love
will never get lost</i>

1425
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:59,164
<i>And when brotherhood
come first</i>

1426
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:00,810
<i>Then the line
will never be crossed</i>

1427
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:03,764
<i>Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn</i>

1428
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:06,884
<i>And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone</i>

1429
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:09,487
<i>It's been a long day</i>

1430
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:12,248
<i>Without you, my friend</i>

1431
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:18,210
<i>And I'll tell you all about
it when I see you again</i>

1432
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:21,162
<i>When I see you again</i>

1433
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:24,527
Hey. You thought you could
leave without saying goodbye?

1434
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:34,886
<i>I used to say I live my life
a quarter-mile at a time.</i>

1435
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:39,931
<i>And I think that's
why we were brothers.</i>

1436
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:42,404
<i>Because you did, too.</i>

1437
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,244
This is your car.
My car?

1438
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:53,680
It's official.

1439
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:54,767
You're all free.

1440
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,122
Home sweet home.

1441
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,720
What's happening, dude?
Thanks for the invite.

1442
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,085
Wanna go for a drive?

1443
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:11,126
