1
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,863
I love this job!
Can't you go faster?

2
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,947
- Floor this thing!
- It's my wife's.

3
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,789
- I won't go faster.
- You're doing 65 now.

4
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,469
65?! Shit!

5
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,349
Get your foot off the pedal!
You're killing my corn!

6
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,101
We're eastbound on Fourth,
in pursuit of a red BMW...

7
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,823
...driver Caucasian, blond.

8
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,225
Plate "2-Boy-Adam-Henry-174."

9
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,221
<i>You are westbound on Second.
20-William- 12 is southbound...</i>

10
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,786
...approaching Second.
You're heading right for each other.

11
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,821
<i>- Somebody back off.
- Got it!</i>

12
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,544
- What'd she say?
- We're about to have an accident.

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,422
- You're gonna get us killed!
- Shit! I'm...

14
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,778
We'll stick with this red
son of a bitch. You chase the blue.

15
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,466
20-William-15, that's confirmed.
You got red, we'll get blue.

16
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,828
- What's the pursuit?
- 20-William-15 and 20-William-12.

17
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,022
- Riggs, Murtaugh.
- And the squad.

18
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,698
- $ 20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.
- Who's driving?

19
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,468
Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,702
I knew nothing about the wife's
station wagon. Bet's off!

21
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,899
Shut up!

22
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,224
What the hell is that?

23
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,785
What fucking language is that?

24
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,105
It's German.

25
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,540
Japanese?

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,583
It's a Japanese radio.
Maybe they bought the LAPD.

27
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,779
They own everything.

28
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,629
Shotgun!

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,868
Shots are being fired.

30
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,068
Thanks for the scoop.

31
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,950
The son of a bitch shot
my wife's windshield.

32
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,344
Entering the pursuit.

33
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,824
Shit, man!
We're splitting up!

34
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,186
Son of a bitch!
Now we're cooking!

35
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,946
Step on it!

36
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,545
Look out!

37
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,505
See you!

38
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,543
I'd like to see your license
and proof of insurance!

39
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,985
We got one.
Yours is going up the hill.

40
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,418
<i>So is Riggs, on foot!</i>

41
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,147
Hey, Riggs!
Get your slow ass in here!

42
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,988
Get in here. Now!

43
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,265
Only if I drive.

44
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,062
Move over, I'll drive.

45
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,545
No, go around. I'm driving.

46
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,149
I'll drive.

47
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,145
Did you get a make
on that red Beemer yet?

48
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,783
Not a scratch, you hear?

49
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,303
You're not gonna make it.

50
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,864
There's no room!

51
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,549
You're not gonna make it!

52
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,019
Look at my side panel!

53
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,979
Goddamn it, you were right, you know.

54
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,301
There wasn't enough room.

55
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,745
Get down! Get down!

56
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,187
Get down, stay down!

57
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,583
He's making a hard right.

58
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,382
Get out of the way!

59
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,109
This was a new car, Riggs.

60
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,539
It still is.

61
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,025
On three.

62
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,620
One...

63
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,061
...two... three!

64
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,585
Shit!

65
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,300
You forgot your left indicator.

66
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,819
Where the hell is he?
This guy's Mandrake!

67
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,863
Where were you, man?!
Goddamn it!

68
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,463
Me?! Where'd he go?!

69
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,224
- He's fucking gone!
- I can see that!

70
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,308
- You come on "three"!
- It's "three," then go!

71
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,222
No! We always go on "three"!

72
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,145
Sometimes we go,
"one, two, three," then go!

73
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,740
Go check back there!

74
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,985
What was that?

75
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,265
- He's in the trunk.
- I got you covered.

76
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,263
Holy Christ!

77
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,781
That's a lot of money.

78
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,749
What is this?

79
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,148
It's gold!

80
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,824
Fucking gold!

81
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,099
Krugerrands.

82
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,143
It's illegal. You can't
import this into the country.

83
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,306
You're right.

84
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,106
The damage you caused comes
out of the department's budget.

85
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,064
- Pay it off in Krugerrands.
- Don't make jokes, make arrests.

86
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,306
You came up empty,
I want an explanation.

87
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,105
- Things got out of hand.
- You said it was a routine bust.

88
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,026
You didn't mention helicopters,
automatic weapons, Krugerrands...

89
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,500
This was bigger than we thought.

90
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,103
Talk to you later.

91
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,104
I worked psycho ward, Riggs.
You'll never get out.

92
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,785
One minute, 15 seconds.

93
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,907
Shapiro, scratch my nose.

94
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,587
What's going on here? Is this a
kindergarten class or a police station?

95
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,548
Let's get some work done.

96
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,544
Houdini Jr. Bets he can
free himself in five minutes.

97
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,700
I will too.

98
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,741
Don't try this at home, kids.

99
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,504
It's all over now.

100
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,862
Put your money on the table,
and get back to work.

101
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,064
Suckers!

102
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,901
Somebody check that thing, man.

103
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,465
How the hell did you do that?

104
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,260
I dislocated my shoulder once.
I can do it whenever I want to now.

105
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,949
Goddamn, doesn't that hurt?

106
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,061
Yeah, it does.

107
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,308
But not as much as...

108
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,182
...when I put it back in.

109
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,181
If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.

110
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,264
My door is always open, sergeant.

111
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,625
I think we ought to keep this
on a professional level, don't you?

112
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,229
Why the hell do you
do this to yourself?

113
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,263
Who else could I do it to?
None of them will let me.

114
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,949
And I need the money.

115
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,946
Cough up!

116
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,309
It's not all here yet.
I want it all. I want the lot.

117
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,981
Where did this come from?

118
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,900
You can't help yourself to this stuff.

119
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,465
This is evidence. It's a Krugerrand.

120
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,464
- That's mine. I won that.
- It's not yours.

121
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,985
You want to get busted?

122
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,981
Want to get something to eat?

123
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,102
Not tonight.
Rianne's commercial is on.

124
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,029
- Rianne's in a commercial?
- Not so loud!

125
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,949
What's the matter?
I'd be proud of her if I was you.

126
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,106
I haven't seen it yet. I don't know.
What if she stinks?

127
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,187
You gotta be kidding.
She'll be great!

128
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,743
Everybody, listen up!

129
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,826
Tonight at...
What time?

130
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,980
Come on!

131
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,703
What time?

132
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,146
8:00.

133
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,068
At 8:00 on channel...?

134
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,302
Eight. The sergeant's
beautiful daughter Rianne...

135
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,148
Here's her picture.

136
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,346
She'll make her television debut
in a commercial.

137
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,343
With this crowd, baby,
you'd better not stink.

138
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,859
- Thought I'd get a new windshield.
- Don't worry, it'll be fine.

139
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,265
- The hood.
- We got a new hood on order.

140
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,506
- No bumper.
- We got a bumper on order.

141
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,587
See you back at your place, Rog.

142
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,027
- Lf you ever get there.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

143
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,790
Be careful.
The mirror's got tape around it.

144
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh, boy. Shit.

145
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,146
What happened? This was a new car.
Mom's gonna be upset!

146
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,023
- It's still new.
- It's not! It's wrecked!

147
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,585
I don't want your mother to know
about it.

148
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,303
Do your homework too.

149
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,343
- Hey! I haven't read these.
- Rianne put them there.

150
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,905
Why don't you look out for me?

151
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,228
Hey, Ricky! I want to use
my driveway once in a while.

152
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,262
Nice o xygen tent.

153
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,826
- Do I look like Michael Jackson?
- No, but you're bad.

154
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,229
This is a two-car garage, and this is
my hobby room upstairs. Take a look.

155
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,139
I retire when I'm 52, and the whole
nine yards kick in when I'm 55.

156
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,818
Cut it out.
You're not retiring, are you?

157
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,783
- I've thought of it since I met you.
- Thank you.

158
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,426
This is a nice hobby room.
All you need now is a hobby.

159
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,146
Jesus Christ!

160
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,342
What's wrong with you guys?

161
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,586
I'm sorry. That's very uncool.

162
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,583
You're sorry?
Check my shorts, for chrissakes!

163
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,469
- Don't you use hammers anymore?
- What's a hammer?

164
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,263
Easy, easy.

165
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,746
It's no Saturday night special,
for crying out loud.

166
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,748
All right, give it back.

167
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,307
A man's not safe in his own home.

168
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,341
Stay the hell out of here, then.

169
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,542
You got any traffic warrants?

170
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,978
Why? Can you fix them?

171
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,100
Almost time.
Are we taping this?

172
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,148
Yes, so we can watch it
over and over again.

173
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,578
Take the stairs.

174
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,902
Nick, get your feet off the table.
You too, Martin.

175
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,943
- The color's no good.
- It's fine. You'll mess it up.

176
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,742
I want my baby to look good.

177
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,700
Unplug it.

178
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,104
That's your sister!

179
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,459
Picture's perfect.

180
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,019
You think so?

181
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,219
Do I know you?

182
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,260
Yes, sir.

183
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,109
We had a long talk about a week ago.
Remember?

184
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,709
We did? About what?

185
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,822
- About your new hobby room.
- This is George!

186
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,509
- How you doing?
- Did you sense that I liked you?

187
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,699
Yes, sir.

188
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,541
Then sit down and be quiet.

189
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,462
- What's that you're eating?
- My tuna fish sandwich.

190
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,620
Tuna?!

191
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,221
Daddy, you can't eat tuna.

192
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,829
Dad killed Flipper.

193
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,668
We're boycotting tuna.

194
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,579
They kill the dolphins that get caught
in the nets. Only albacore.

195
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,225
Have ham.

196
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,744
Eat Miss Piggy.

197
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,026
- I'm sorry!
- It's only my eye.

198
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,622
Oh, my God! It's coming on!

199
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,619
My baby!

200
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,820
Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?

201
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,342
<i>When the time has come...</i>

202
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,026
<i>... and the moment is right...</i>

203
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,144
<i>... remember...</i>

204
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,938
<i>... use Ramses Extra Condoms.</i>

205
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,546
<i>We do!</i>

206
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,342
<i>Ramses Extra.</i>

207
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,747
<i>Because caring means
all the protection you can get.</i>

208
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,780
Take the kids upstairs.

209
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,742
We learn this in human development.

210
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,305
In human what?!
Human development what?!

211
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,102
Development. Chill out.

212
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,465
Upstairs.

213
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,143
Nick, upstairs.

214
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,746
You know how your father is.

215
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,385
- I looked fat.
- I liked you.

216
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,869
Home. Out.

217
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,705
George, I got a gun.

218
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,100
What's with you?
She looked beautiful.

219
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,859
I liked it. She made me want
to buy rubbers right now.

220
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,508
I thought it was great.
Rianne, that was just...

221
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,705
- I thought you were terrific.
- Really?

222
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,741
I think she's got a future.
Don't you?

223
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,510
- Yeah, she was good.
- George is afraid of Daddy.

224
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,859
Stick around.

225
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,584
Mr. Murtaugh has a gun.

226
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,987
Yeah, but it's an old gun,
and he's not a very good shot.

227
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,219
That's good.
I'm going anyway. Good night.

228
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,024
- I'll buy you a beer.
- Let him buy the beer.

229
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,379
You're under 21.

230
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,262
Be back by midnight.

231
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,659
Wait and see.
Cops never let up, you know?

232
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,419
I'll have rubbers on my desk,
in the mail, in the coffee...

233
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,021
If you'd only shut your mouth. You
told everybody. I'm going for a walk.

234
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,222
Give the boys some credit.
In one ear, out the rubber.

235
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,866
How goes it with you, Hans?

236
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,425
Okay. You, Pieter?

237
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,108
That's quite enough of that.
Come on over here, Hans.

238
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,386
Mind the plastic.
I'm having some painting done.

239
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,823
The important thing is,
are you all right?

240
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,022
No bones broken?

241
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,904
I'm fine, thank you.

242
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,748
Just bumps and bruises, eh?

243
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,829
Yeah, that's all.

244
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,549
Good, good.

245
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,629
However, we did lose over $ 1 million
in Krugerrand.

246
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,948
I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.

247
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,824
It happens.

248
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,907
It's not your fault.

249
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,148
Sometimes these things
do not go as planned.

250
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,186
As you say, they just happen,
eh, Pieter?

251
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,067
You give a whole new meaning
to the word "dropcloth."

252
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,784
Certain policemen in this city
have become an intolerable nuisance.

253
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,742
They are obviously onto us again.
How do you propose to handle it?

254
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,383
Warn them off.

255
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,588
It's my experience...

256
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,348
...that a scared cop is
more useful than a dead one.

257
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,903
A warning?

258
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,902
Is that not a bit tame?

259
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,658
Depends how you do it.

260
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,347
Then you'd better look at this.

261
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,866
This is the policeman in charge.

262
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,584
<i>Goddamn kaffir.</i>

263
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,305
Lovely.

264
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,863
Remember to take these in order.

265
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,589
There's a packet
for each day of the week.

266
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,060
Thank you.

267
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,498
This yours?

268
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,863
I found it in the wash.

269
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,300
Thanks.

270
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,829
I keep on losing this.

271
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,945
Something's wrong.

272
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,626
No, not really.
It's just a goddamn pen.

273
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,744
What about the pen?

274
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,067
It just reminds me of something.

275
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,099
Reminds you of what?

276
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,389
It reminds me of...

277
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,462
...the night Vicki was killed.

278
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,858
I didn't mean to push.

279
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,944
That's okay.
We never really talked about this.

280
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,948
I was supposed to meet her for dinner,
one of those romantic dinners for two.

281
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,509
I had so much work.

282
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,627
I forgot about the whole thing.

283
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,388
She waited at the restaurant for
an hour before she drove home alone.

284
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,903
It was midnight when I got home
to a ringing phone, so I answered it.

285
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,459
They told me she was killed
in a car crash.

286
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,941
I should've been driving.
We'd have been all right.

287
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,058
I remember falling down on my knees,
and I started shaking all over.

288
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,023
I remember thinking,
"I'm just losing it."

289
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,544
So there I was,
lying on the living room floor.

290
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,425
Lying there, and I'm seeing under
the couch, and I see this gold pen...

291
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,738
...just lying there.

292
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,545
I'd been looking for it everywhere
for two months. There it is.

293
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,266
She wasn't much of a housekeeper.

294
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,260
This voice goes off inside my head,
like a drill instructor.

295
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,539
It said, "Get up! Now!"

296
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,100
I didn't feel like it,
but I got up.

297
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,141
Muscles were still working.

298
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,785
Then I drove to the hospital...

299
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,182
...identified her
and signed her out with my gold pen.

300
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,541
Gold pen? Trish found
a gold pen in the laundry.

301
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,939
Look around you, Sam.
Look around you.

302
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,908
One day, Sam...

303
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,308
...this'll all be yours.

304
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,622
Find a nice bitch,
raise a couple of pups.

305
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,540
A man could live here and be happy.

306
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,305
Anybody tell you if you sit on
cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?

307
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,228
Let's go watch some TV.

308
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,064
<i>Kaffirs!</i>

309
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,709
Wondering about your kids?

310
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,906
You wondering what we done to them?

311
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,259
If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.

312
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,540
I'd be going fucking bananas.

313
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,108
Want to know what we done?

314
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,426
Shall I tell you?

315
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,950
You just let your imagination
run riot.

316
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,501
This has just been a warning.

317
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,459
After this, it gets bloody.
You tell your people to back off.

318
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,308
<i>Don't be a smart kaffir.</i>

319
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,623
Maybe we let you live, huh?
Come on, let's go.

320
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,548
- You didn't see a face?
- Not one. They all had on hoods.

321
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,944
What about a voice?

322
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,541
That motherfucker who did talk had a
strange accent. I couldn't place it.

323
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,342
Not German, not English.

324
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,269
Kind of guttural.
You know, a shitty accent.

325
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,780
Anything like what we were chasing
the other night?

326
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,379
Yeah, kind of like that.

327
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,143
Trish and the kids?

328
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,103
They're at her sister's house
in Bellflower.

329
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,462
Listen up. You all heard about
what happened to Rog last night?

330
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,661
Forensics get back with anything?

331
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,906
Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.

332
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,427
The point being, we gotta watch
each other's backs and fronts.

333
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,339
You're all invited to watch my back
in poker tomorrow. You in?

334
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,428
- Lf we catch these assholes.
- Count me in.

335
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,350
I got something special for you boys.

336
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,383
Leo Getz has been placed
in protective custody.

337
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,185
You guys are gonna babysit him
until Washington sends the feds.

338
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,502
- How long?
- Soon as the red tape is processed.

339
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,859
Three days.

340
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,149
This guy Getz is gonna testify
before a commission of inquiry.

341
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,420
Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.

342
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,741
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

343
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,862
This is not a shit assignment.

344
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,146
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

345
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,181
- It isn't.
- It's a shit assignment.

346
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,823
Shut up, the both of you.

347
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,105
Here you go, sir.

348
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,619
- I guaranteed this guy's safety.
- Why us?

349
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,027
Because you two are
the most qualified for the job.

350
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,023
And after last night,
you could use the break.

351
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,504
I can handle last night.

352
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,864
What do we do with him?

353
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,305
How should I know?
Take him to Disneyland.

354
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,228
This stinks. This stinks.

355
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,579
I don't give a fuck.

356
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,782
I don't have an ulcer,
because I know when to say that.

357
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,385
Here's where he's staying.
It's a nice hotel.

358
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,787
Expenses are paid by the Justice
Department, so enjoy yourselves.

359
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,303
One more thing.

360
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,066
Know what that says?

361
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,064
Same thing as that.
But I don't give a fuck.

362
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,623
You're lucky.
I have to live with that.

363
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,469
What a joint!

364
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,219
Excuse me, ma'am, where's the lobby?

365
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,579
That's this way.

366
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,386
Hey, come on. Come on.

367
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,669
What I wouldn't pay to have this pool
in my back yard.

368
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,746
You can't swim.

369
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,668
I could get my stroke down.

370
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,347
- What's the water like?
- Great.

371
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,303
- How's the temperature?
- Great. Why don't you come in?

372
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,901
As an employee, I can't get into these
things. If I get caught, I get fired.

373
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,345
Everything okay for you at the hotel?

374
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,586
No problem?
Nothing I can do for you?

375
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,827
Excuse me. I see you're coming out
of your shell.

376
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,981
- Hotel psychiatrist.
- Join us also.

377
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,739
Our patient, Mr. Getz, is waiting
for us upstairs.

378
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,269
Want to talk to Mr. Murphy?

379
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,665
Yeah, I gotta go to work. Bye.

380
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,062
- Come back.
- We'll be waiting.

381
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,625
Can any of you cook?

382
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,742
Let's go. Murphy.

383
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,022
The girls in this place.
This is where they live in the day.

384
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,505
This is where my tax money goes too.

385
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,189
Leo lives like this.

386
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,108
Where's the elevator?

387
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,062
Down the hall to the right.

388
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,659
Are you gentlemen guests of the hotel?

389
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,424
Excuse me.

390
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,428
What room is that for?

391
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,586
612.

392
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,068
This is it. 612.

393
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,864
- Who is it?
- Police.

394
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,784
How do I know that?

395
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,460
After I shoot you through the door,
you can examine the bullet.

396
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,340
Don't you want to see a badge?

397
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,903
- Where's your badge?
- Shut up.

398
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,385
I get it.
Bad cop, good cop.

399
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,069
Shut up!

400
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,420
Bad cop, bad cop.
I know the routines.

401
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,463
- Are you Leo Getz?
- That's me, Leo Getz.

402
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,100
Whatever you need, Leo gets.
You get it?

403
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,223
I use that to break the ice
when I meet people.

404
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,421
I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
This is Sgt. Riggs.

405
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,747
How you doing? Nice to meet you.
What do I call you guys?

406
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,101
- Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.
- We're gonna be your shadow.

407
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,141
That's all right.
An old-fashioned...!

408
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,422
Okay. I just ain't seen one
in a long time.

409
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,349
I didn't think anybody
used those things anymore.

410
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,508
I'll bet you the kid's got
an automatic. Got an automatic?

411
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,825
Yep, a Beretta.

412
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,224
Don't touch it.

413
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,503
You sure you guys are cops?

414
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,019
Better watch how you treat me.
I'm the state's star witness.

415
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,148
We'll take that room.

416
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,698
Actually, I already have my stuff
in this room. You know, when I...

417
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,422
It's yours. My stuff's gone.

418
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,746
I'll move it in the small room, okay?

419
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,500
I'm the smallest guy here.
I'll take the small room.

420
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,589
Come on, loosen up a little, guys.
We'll be together a long time.

421
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,500
I'll get it.

422
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,785
It's only room service.

423
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,544
You hungry? I'll call
and get anything you want.

424
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,139
See this silk robe?
Silk pajamas? Free!

425
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,908
- It's not free.
- Yes, it is!

426
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,068
- It's taxpayers'money.
- Oh, God! It's the same thing.

427
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,029
Good morning, gentlemen.

428
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,345
That's my food! You guys didn't
want anything. Bring it here.

429
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,668
It's mine. Boy!

430
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,260
You could've had anything you wanted.

431
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,542
I ordered eggs, not hamburger.

432
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,903
Martin, not the window!

433
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,665
Shit!

434
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,703
Where is that son of a bitch?

435
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,104
Somebody stop that guy!
Stop him!

436
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,061
Don't leave me! I can't swim!

437
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,382
Get off me!

438
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,545
Get off me!

439
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:53,907
We're near the edge of the pool.
Now get the fuck off my back.

440
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,505
Clear, move it! Get back! Police!

441
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,506
You all right?

442
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,383
I'm okay.
Why didn't you follow me down?

443
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,899
- Why didn't you?
- I was seven floors up!

444
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,225
He hit me.

445
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,419
Good!

446
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,268
This guy took an awful chance
to pop all of us.

447
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,188
Did you witness a murder?

448
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,426
No, nothing like that. Honest.

449
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,181
All I did was, I laundered
half a billion dollars in drug money.

450
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,141
Half a billion dollars?

451
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,820
Give or take a few.
Who could count with that much money?

452
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,346
Could I please have some cotton balls
for my nose?

453
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,428
Could you please shut up?

454
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,743
- You're supposed to take care of me.
- Shut up!

455
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,503
Mr. Getz got away. Our best
opportunity, and he gets away.

456
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,261
He slips right through our fingers
and into the hands of the police.

457
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,098
What are you doing?

458
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,260
Just checking to see
if I was standing on plastic.

459
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,787
Okay, I got it. Okay, here.

460
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,620
I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.
I work in a bank.

461
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,344
You have money to launder.
What do you do?

462
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,785
I bring it to you.

463
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,028
- He does.
- Me? I don't understand. Why me?

464
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,505
Who am I?

465
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,183
I'll tell you.

466
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,665
You're a courier. You work for him.

467
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,662
I'm the drug dealer.

468
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,419
Don't you have plates?
Here. Come on. What is this?

469
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,547
I deposit the cash into the account
of a dummy finance company.

470
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,787
Then I issue you a cashier's check
in his name...

471
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,624
...minus a small commission
for myself.

472
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,302
- You like breathing?
- How much?

473
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,625
Two percent.

474
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,182
Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.

475
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,227
You give it back to me as collateral
on a loan I make to you.

476
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,820
But you don't pay back the loan.
You keep the money.

477
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,025
How's that work?

478
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,744
How's what? That's it!
Don't you get it?

479
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,704
It's your money. You don't pay
it back. It's yours, and it's clean!

480
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,026
It is now laundered.

481
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,580
You cops aren't too bright, are you?

482
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,420
This is the best part. You got it?

483
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,703
You take a tax deduction...

484
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,541
...on interest payments
that you don't even make.

485
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,305
- Am I a genius?
- You're a swindler.

486
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,420
Cheat!

487
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,944
Come on.

488
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,818
Everybody cheats.
Look at the Pentagon.

489
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,298
So you got it?

490
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,142
Okay, Mr. Big Shot,
how come you turned yourself in?

491
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,780
I was scamming those guys for months.

492
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,107
Every transaction, I kept a little.

493
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,186
You?

494
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,700
It was easy.
All those cash deposits.

495
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,147
Millions of dollars in small bills
changing hands.

496
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,387
Who's gonna miss $ 10,000 here,
$ 20,000 there?

497
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,589
Drug dealers.

498
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,748
That's right. They did.

499
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,670
That's why I'm living
out of a suitcase now.

500
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,708
You can give that to Nick.

501
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,228
I'll bet you it's softer.
I put fabric softener in.

502
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,419
It's small, Leroy.

503
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,623
It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if
you want, I'll buy you another shirt!

504
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,663
Do me a favor. Give me the names
of those drug dealers.

505
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,499
I don't know any drug dealers.
All I dealt with was couriers.

506
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,544
- Where does Trish keep my laundry?
- On the shelf in back of the machine.

507
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,219
You never met anyone except couriers?

508
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,143
No names.

509
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,182
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Come to think of it...

510
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,545
Okay, listen.

511
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,579
They took me up to the hills
in this house with stilts on it.

512
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,588
And I had a job interview
with a guy...

513
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,741
...and his name was...

514
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,149
...Haynes. Hans!

515
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,580
- Take us there.
- We have to sit on this guy.

516
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,542
It won't do any harm to look.

517
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,946
- I know the address.
- Let's go.

518
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,060
We shouldn't!

519
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,226
Come on, don't be a killjoy!

520
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,898
We're back, we're bad!
You're black, I'm mad.

521
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,828
This is going to be great!

522
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,903
If we're going,
shouldn't I have a gun?

523
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,659
Is my nose still bleeding?
It's really sore.

524
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,462
I'm sorry about that.

525
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,667
That's downtown L.A.
How'd you like to have a house here?

526
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,180
It'd be okay three days of the year
when you can actually see it.

527
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,903
Get a fresh breath.

528
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,462
It's been two hours and six places.
You sure of the address?

529
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,309
I told you I wasn't sure
of the exact address.

530
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,659
What are you sure of?

531
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,747
I'm sure the numbers add up to 28.

532
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,989
I remember because I was 28 when I
became a certified public accountant.

533
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,348
We can figure this out.

534
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,269
There's four numbers.
The first one has to be a nine.

535
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,349
Nine is my lucky number. I was born
on the ninth day of the ninth month.

536
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,466
- This is ridiculous.
- Hang on. Maybe not, maybe not.

537
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,302
There aren't many streets
in Bel Air that begin with nine...

538
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,466
...with four numbers in the address.

539
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,423
- How many's not that many?
- Let's have a look.

540
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,343
Well, I meant more than
10 or 12 streets.

541
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,859
This is thin, Riggs.
This is very thin.

542
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,509
This is anorexic.

543
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,420
- Such as 739, 658.

544
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,949
Okay, that's it.

545
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,379
That's it.

546
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,907
Look. This is it. See?

547
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,028
The last three numbers have to be
either 739 or 658.

548
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,540
The first number's gotta be a 9
because 9 was my lucky number.

549
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,583
I was born on the ninth day...
See, that's it.

550
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,348
I tell you, I could do it.

551
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,460
Take us there.

552
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,059
- We need a street, that's all.
- Is that all?

553
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,024
- How's that?
- Good enough for me.

554
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,747
Leo, this is the seventh place.

555
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,225
- We have the numbers.
- And the seventh time.

556
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,069
- Just jumble them around.
- It's a lucky number.

557
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,148
It should be coming up soon.

558
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,585
- 9856.
- That's it.

559
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,987
- That's another possibility.
- This is the ninth possibility.

560
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,182
That's it! Nine. My lucky number.

561
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,626
Stay in the car, you hear?

562
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,662
- Can't I come?
- Stay.

563
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,144
Nice car.

564
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,421
- What are you doing?
- Hooking it up.

565
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,621
You're not looking
at what you're doing!

566
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,709
I know what I'm doing. I'm towing
your car, not a baby carriage.

567
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,060
You're chipping the paint.
I can hear it!

568
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,783
- You smell what I smell?
- I smell something.

569
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,469
What's that? A rat?

570
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,747
A stinky one too.

571
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,304
Where you going?

572
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,070
I'm a peeping Tom.
It goes with the badge.

573
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,709
It's fun sometimes too.

574
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,460
Bingo!

575
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,989
Lars, look!

576
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,942
What the fuck?

577
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,587
- Where's the pool?
- There's no pool.

578
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,900
There's no pool.

579
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,941
This house is built on stilts.

580
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,220
Stilts? No, I'm sure there's a pool.

581
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,949
Cuff yourselves.

582
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,228
Not this again.

583
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,582
Riggs! Where you at?

584
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,585
Stay where you are. Don't move.

585
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,418
You all right?

586
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,779
Move that truck.

587
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,419
Give me your keys!

588
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,984
You all right?

589
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,665
Where you going?

590
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,269
That was the hotel waiter.

591
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,425
Wait for me!

592
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,225
Get out of here!

593
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,184
What are you doing? You can't
take my truck! What's going on?

594
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,901
Don't worry.
We'll bring it right back.

595
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:14,746
Gotcha!

596
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,180
Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!

597
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,658
Where did he go?

598
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,188
Riggs is hanging on the truck!

599
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,661
What are you doing out of the car?
Get in the car!

600
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,665
Get back! It's police business!

601
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,749
It's a high-speed chase!
Get out of the way!

602
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,703
Go faster! We gotta catch him
and your partner.

603
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,909
Hello, asshole!

604
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,780
Come on, come on. Give me that!

605
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,618
There they are! Hurry up!

606
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,627
Come on! Can't you go faster?

607
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,786
Will you shut the fuck up?

608
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,979
Look out!

609
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,509
Oh, shit!

610
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,426
Wipeout! It's all under control.

611
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,541
I told you to look out!

612
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,503
- You're too old to drive this car.
- Shut up!

613
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,860
And stay!

614
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,742
What do you think I am, a dog?

615
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,943
Hands behind your neck!

616
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:51,067
What are you doing here?
We got a lot to talk about.

617
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,379
What's going on?

618
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,659
Freeze, dickhead!

619
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,384
Get down here, dickhead.
It's been a bad day.

620
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,705
Show me your hands.

621
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,787
Take it easy, officer.

622
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,142
I'm not armed. I won't resist.

623
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,908
Put down your guns, gentlemen.
It's all right.

624
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,743
Do as I say!

625
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,708
Get your hands on your head.

626
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,543
Lace them behind your head!

627
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,422
You have no idea what you're doing.

628
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,869
We're professional police officers.
We do this for a living.

629
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,181
My name is Arjen Rudd.

630
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,742
I'm minister of diplomatic affairs
for the South African Consulate.

631
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,547
South Africa,
home of the Krugerrand.

632
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,229
Among other things.

633
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,149
These gentlemen also work
for the consulate.

634
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,545
We have diplomatic credentials...

635
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,028
Keep your hands high.

636
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,098
Give me that.

637
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,029
Everybody take it easy.
Especially you, Riggs.

638
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,949
Riggs? You Martin Riggs?

639
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,143
Of the Chicago Riggses.
What's your name?

640
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,904
Pieter Von... Vor...

641
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,862
Fuck, I'll just call you Adolf.

642
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,509
Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?

643
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,667
- That's you.
- It's official.

644
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,178
They are official.

645
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,225
Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...

646
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,940
...no diplomatic agent
may be detained or arrested...

647
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,062
Once his identity
has been established.

648
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,141
We do have a serious
diplomatic situation here...

649
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,820
...which I'll take up with your
State Department tomorrow.

650
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,942
I'm quaking in my boots,
but I'll still bring you down.

651
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,708
My dear officer...

652
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,429
...you could not even give me
a parking ticket.

653
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,387
Who is the dickhead now?

654
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,468
This house is owned by
the South African government.

655
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,661
This is South African soil.

656
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,588
Now get out of here.

657
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,705
All of you.

658
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,829
Come on, let's go.

659
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,464
Hey, man, don't do it.

660
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:14,141
Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,
and I'll make you eat this thing.

661
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,659
<i>Kaffir!</i>

662
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:22,149
With those credentials,
Chuck Manson could get off.

663
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,540
- I went to school with him.
- Yeah, right.

664
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:29,541
Miss, could you step out
of the car, please?

665
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,506
Put them away. I'm sorry.

666
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,543
I'm sorry. Are you...?

667
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,379
Don't open that.

668
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,023
That is a diplomatic pouch...

669
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,745
...protected under Article 27
of the Vienna Convention.

670
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,907
Is he serious with this stuff?

671
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,150
These are police officers,
Miss Van Den Haas.

672
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,784
They were just leaving.

673
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,142
She is a consulate secretary.

674
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,782
Give her back the briefcase.

675
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:04,909
Give it to her.

676
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,704
Here. I'm sorry,
Miss Consulate Secretary.

677
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,903
Don't talk to them! Come here.

678
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,749
He's a nice guy.
What's he paying you an hour?

679
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,544
How'd you like to increase your pay?
Better hours?

680
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,944
I'd start getting used to
that sort of view.

681
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,706
- It's the Triangle Trade again.
- The what?

682
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,504
Didn't you ever do American history
at school?

683
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,507
From molasses to rum to slaves.

684
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,746
Now it's drugs to dollars
to Krugerrands.

685
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,579
I know there's a dead guy
with a surfboard where his face was...

686
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:53,100
...and the State Department's
breathing down our throats.

687
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,588
I'll have to make a formal apology
to the South African Consulate.

688
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,905
Apologize?

689
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,300
He's a sack of shit!
He's dirty, a crook.

690
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,706
- It's the Triangle Trade again.
- The what?

691
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,504
Didn't you ever do American history
at school?

692
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,507
From molasses to rum to slaves.

693
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,746
Now it's drugs to dollars
to Krugerrands.

694
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,579
I know there's a dead guy
with a surfboard where his face was...

695
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:53,100
...and the State Department's
breathing down our throats.

696
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,588
I'll have to make a formal apology
to the South African Consulate.

697
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,905
Apologize?

698
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,300
He's a sack of shit!
He's dirty, a crook.

699
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,149
It doesn't matter if he's dirty.
He's a diplomat.

700
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,468
He's got immunity. We can't
touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.

701
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,820
Is that clear?
Does that spell it out?

702
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,860
Yes, sir.

703
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,540
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.

704
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:21,861
You took a civilian on a bust.
A civilian you're supposed to protect!

705
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,903
- He's alive, isn't he?
- It's okay. I signed a waiver.

706
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,420
- Besides, I usually wait in the car.
- Usually? Usually?

707
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,586
They're very adamant about that.

708
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,862
- I don't give a fuck.
- They're good cops. They're the best.

709
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,220
One time, a guy was waving a gun...

710
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:37,664
What'd he say?

711
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,785
What did he say?

712
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:43,220
"I don't give a fuck."
It's his mantra.

713
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,422
Why is everybody's ass parked
on my desk? Up! Up!

714
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,109
It's a rubber plant!

715
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,149
I had nothing to do with it.
Looks like a week's supply.

716
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,300
Go spit.

717
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,547
I'm sorry, I forgot.
You're too old for that shit.

718
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,578
If you don't like it,
you can exchange it.

719
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,068
Thank you, Mr. Rudd.

720
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,460
One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.

721
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,622
I hope you understood
what was happening here today.

722
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,549
I'd rather not jump
to any wrong conclusions.

723
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,941
Why don't you explain it to me?

724
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:43,662
The policies of our government are not
popular here in America, as you know.

725
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:47,505
The police department of this city
is overrun with blacks.

726
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:51,022
They have badges and guns,
and they hate us.

727
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,666
Our consulate, its staff...

728
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:58,108
...and particularly myself, will always
be targets for their harassment.

729
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,028
Good night, Mr. Rudd.

730
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,741
Things are getting out of hand.

731
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,106
We are suffering too many losses.

732
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,104
We have to move the cash
in one large shipment.

733
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,659
We'll need something bigger
than a suitcase.

734
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:31,579
I'll worry about that.
You worry about the police.

735
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:34,384
Your warning did not work.

736
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,827
- Come on, Leo, let's go!
- I'm coming.

737
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,100
Come on! Move!

738
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,540
Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?

739
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,469
- Big deal. I've gotta eat too.
- Come on, Leo.

740
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,748
Give me the food.

741
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,622
- Who ordered the super combo?
- Over here.

742
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,748
I get a steak sandwich.

743
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:04,940
Who gets Leo?

744
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,028
You got a big, empty house.

745
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,460
I got a trailer.
What will I do with him?

746
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,865
My place is too small. You take him.

747
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,389
I had him last night.

748
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,023
Excuse me, fellas!

749
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,186
This is tuna. I hate tuna.

750
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:21,143
I refuse to get stuck with tuna.
Now, come on.

751
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,788
- Don't eat the tuna.
- Where were you? I just said that!

752
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,420
I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.

753
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,109
We're not going back. Shut up!

754
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,143
Sure, don't go back.
Okay, don't go back. That's it.

755
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,467
Can I give you two guys
a friendly piece of advice?

756
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:39,140
Never go up to the drive-through.
Always walk up to the counter.

757
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,187
You know why? Let me tell you.

758
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,906
They fuck you
at the drive-through, okay?

759
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,944
They know you'll be miles away
before you find out you got fucked.

760
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,380
They know you won't
turn around and go back.

761
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:54,309
They don't care.
Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!

762
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,228
I'm not eating this tuna!

763
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,903
Shut up!

764
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:09,223
Good morning, Mr. Rudd.

765
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,541
- Get rid of that man.
- Yes, sir.

766
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:17,341
Sorry, you're gonna have to leave
the premises right now.

767
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,023
The morning faxes.

768
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:07,180
Sam, come here. What's the matter?
He kick you out of the house?

769
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,423
Here, Sam. I want you
to bite Leo for me.

770
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,349
What are you doing?

771
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,427
I'm cleaning up this pigsty.

772
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,666
I like living the way I live.

773
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:30,783
When's the last time you did
the refrigerator? The pan under it?

774
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,788
- There's a pan under there?
- Oh, please. Come on.

775
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,629
Where's my phone?
Where the fuck is everything?

776
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,388
Where's my TV?

777
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,387
Everything is outside.

778
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,109
Just stop what you're doing.

779
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:45,427
- Get the dog out of here!
- You go before the mutt.

780
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,302
Out, out! Oh, man!

781
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,868
<i>Riggs, it's Collins.</i>

782
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,427
<i>- Has Murtaugh checked in with you?
- No, he hasn't. Why?</i>

783
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,702
<i>I haven't heard from him.
He doesn't answer his phone.</i>

784
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,785
I'll be right there.

785
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:09,783
Stay in the car.

786
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,025
Get in there.

787
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,344
I'm upstairs!

788
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:20,940
Should I call 999,
"Officer in distress"?

789
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,265
I'll cover the back!

790
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,825
- Where are you?
- I'm up here.

791
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:42,864
In here.

792
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,179
Good morning.

793
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,339
First time in 20 years
I got the bathroom all to myself.

794
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:11,940
No kids banging on the door.
No wife asking me to hurry up.

795
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:15,546
<i>Just me and my new
Salt Water Sportsman magazine.</i>

796
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,661
Is that the one with the article
on deep-sea fishing?

797
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:40,183
Sitting here reading about marlin
fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...

798
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:43,220
...when I glanced over,
I saw this.

799
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,148
Oh, Jesus!

800
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,179
Is that all?

801
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:54,905
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Scared the shit out of you?

802
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:57,703
How long you been here?

803
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:59,548
I've been here all night.

804
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:02,589
My legs are so goddamn numb,
I don't know if I can...

805
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,058
Don't move.

806
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:05,465
I can't.

807
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:08,304
Just stay that way. Do you mind?

808
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:12,023
A dirty job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

809
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,906
Tell me I'm not fucked.

810
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,698
He's fucked.

811
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,025
Okay, but I'd be lying.

812
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,460
You'll be okay if you don't stand up.

813
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,819
That's a relief.

814
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,345
- I'll have to get help.
- No way!

815
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,263
Why?

816
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:47,180
I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.

817
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:51,305
This is serious.
I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.

818
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,545
Bomb Squad?

819
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,146
Okay, call them in.

820
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,788
Call them, but don't use
the open frequency.

821
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,706
Let's keep this quiet, okay?

822
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,063
Sure. Trust me.

823
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:32,864
Excuse me, please.

824
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,106
Officer, an escort isn't necessary.

825
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,939
I know you're a psychiatrist,
but it's not a pretty sight.

826
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:42,381
I have helped policemen through
the most traumatic moments.

827
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:46,145
Believe me, there is nothing
in this room that I cannot handle.

828
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,423
I was wrong.

829
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,229
Excuse me.

830
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:58,628
I should've known.
Where there's one, there's the other.

831
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,988
Split.

832
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,865
You're the psychiatrist?
I have these dreams.

833
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,226
It's ready to come out.

834
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,221
I gotta live in this house!

835
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,339
Clear this room.

836
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,669
Come on, Riggs.

837
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,148
- You too, Riggs.
- No.

838
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,467
Riggs. Out.

839
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,909
All right.

840
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,378
Dive into the tub.

841
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,063
When you do, pull the bomb blanket
over your head.

842
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:50,145
This is a good cast-iron tub.
It'll withstand a hell of a blast.

843
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:51,579
I can't do it.

844
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,748
He can't do it.
He's been on there for 18, 20 hours.

845
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:56,747
He can't even walk.

846
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,668
I'll have to help him.

847
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,427
All right, you better wear this.

848
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,541
- How's the nitrogen?
- Almost there.

849
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:11,620
What he's doing is spraying
this thing with liquid nitrogen...

850
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:14,503
...to give you a second
or two before detonation.

851
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:17,304
- Got that?
- A second or two. Thanks a lot.

852
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:18,905
Lights out!

853
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:20,623
Get him up and out.

854
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,822
- Let's go.
- Move!

855
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:29,898
Good luck.

856
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:31,989
You got a piece?

857
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:33,942
- A Smith & Wesson.
- Try this.

858
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,266
Safety's on. I'll collect it later.

859
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,543
Good luck.

860
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,309
All right, let's move.

861
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:54,783
Alone at last.

862
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,907
Why didn't they plant
the bomb in Trish's stove?

863
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,341
Think of all the needless suffering
that could have ended.

864
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,180
I'm gonna die on the toilet.

865
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,779
Guys like you don't die on toilets.

866
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,868
Anyway, I'm here, and I don't
plan on going just now.

867
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,389
Let's do it.

868
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:33,779
On "three."

869
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,265
Wait, let me get into the tub.

870
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,621
I'm just gonna give you the...

871
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,306
On "three," huh? What do you say?

872
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:44,825
One...

873
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,701
...two...
- Wait!

874
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,304
Do we do it on "three"...

875
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,581
...or "one, two, three"...

876
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,065
...then do it?
- Well, it's your ass.

877
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,305
It's up to you.

878
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:00,864
My ass, yeah.

879
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:02,259
"Three."

880
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:03,989
We go on "three"?

881
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,499
"One, two" and then "three"!

882
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:10,899
One...

883
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,549
- Martin?
- What?

884
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:20,179
I know.

885
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:22,823
I mean it, man.

886
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,944
I hear you.

887
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:31,780
We're not gonna fucking die,
all right?

888
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:34,065
On "three."

889
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,184
One...

890
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:37,979
...two...

891
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,459
...three!

892
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,109
I gotta go! I gotta go!

893
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,741
Get off me. I don't want
anybody to see us like this.

894
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:15,864
Mr. Jones?

895
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,581
Sit down, please.

896
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:23,146
What can I do for you today?

897
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:26,069
I have this problem,
this very delicate matter.

898
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,784
My friend wants to emigrate
to South Africa.

899
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:31,185
Of course, I can help him do that.

900
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:33,745
I want you to talk him out of it.

901
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:35,585
Talk him out of it?

902
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:37,309
Whatever for?

903
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:41,624
This is a bad time for him to go.
I mean, with all the trouble.

904
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,663
Ask your friend to come back
later in the week...

905
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,940
...we can sit down...
- No, he's here.

906
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,424
- He's here?
- He's here now.

907
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:49,540
Alphonse!

908
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:50,865
Alphonse?

909
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:59,218
How you doing?

910
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,261
There must be some mistake.

911
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,784
Say what?

912
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:10,426
Listen to your friend.
He knows what he's talking about.

913
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:13,389
I don't think you want
to go to South Africa.

914
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,625
Why not?

915
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:18,944
Because you're black.

916
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,065
You are.

917
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,704
He is.

918
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:28,068
Of course I'm black.
That's why I want to go.

919
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,140
To join my brothers in the struggle...

920
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,023
...against the tyranny
of the racist, fascist...

921
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,504
...white, minority regime!

922
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,745
Fascist regime!

923
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:37,985
One man, one vote!

924
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,100
One man, one vote!

925
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,460
Free South Africa, you son of a bitch!

926
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:42,898
You son of a bitch!

927
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:46,261
I've heard as much as I want to.
I demand that you leave.

928
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:49,862
What's happening here?

929
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,069
Back off!

930
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,979
Close the security gate! Quickly!

931
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,308
End apartheid now!

932
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:16,542
You're telling me to shut up?
You gonna arrest me?

933
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:36,778
You can't push me out!

934
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,582
You call this security?

935
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:43,749
More people come in and out of here
than Grand Central Station.

936
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:47,779
Wait, gentlemen!

937
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:51,463
Don't bother to call the police.
I'm here already.

938
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:54,628
I should have known.

939
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,429
Well, well.

940
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:01,300
It's the master race!

941
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:05,148
I hope you realize the trouble
you are in right now.

942
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:09,100
As usual, you have everything
upside down and turned around...

943
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:10,629
...and back to front.

944
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,183
Gentlemen...

945
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:15,065
...show Officer Riggs into the street.

946
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:21,259
Fingers off.

947
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:22,698
Hand off!

948
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,781
Let me look at that.

949
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,705
That's some piece of hardware.
Where the fuck do you get that stuff?

950
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:34,743
I've never seen that.
Where's it from? South Africa?

951
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:37,938
Don't move.

952
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:47,586
I'm surprised you haven't heard
about me. I got a bad reputation.

953
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,588
Sometimes I just go nuts.

954
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:51,984
Don't move.

955
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:59,149
I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.
Or is it Aryan?

956
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,420
Whatever the fuck your name is.

957
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:06,262
You fold up your tents, and get
the fuck out of my country...

958
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,621
...and I won't do anything to you.

959
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:10,742
I'll leave you alone.

960
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:14,102
If you stick around here,
I'm gonna fuck your ass.

961
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,782
Then I'll send you home
with your balls in a sling.

962
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:21,106
Just get out of here...

963
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:23,541
<i>... kaffir lover.</i>

964
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:30,825
Eenie...

965
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:32,265
...meenie...

966
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:34,264
...minie...

967
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:36,659
Hey, Moe!

968
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:41,989
Sorry, Adolf.

969
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:46,181
Pick them up with your hands.

970
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,102
Big smile.

971
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:50,663
Big smile!

972
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:55,025
Vorstedt, come over here!

973
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:56,379
Vorstedt!

974
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:03,024
- Hello. Officer...?
- Martin Riggs.

975
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,709
What are you doing here?

976
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:08,061
I've been with your boss.
You know, shooting the breeze.

977
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,828
Shooting his fish.

978
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,548
The guy goes, "But, but, but...

979
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,149
...you're black!"

980
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,309
He's black!

981
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:33,588
- I bet he was shitting.
- Started some shit with that!

982
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:35,303
You get into Rudd's office?

983
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,829
Yeah, I got up there.

984
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:39,669
Aryan Crud and his
Brown Shirts turned up...

985
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:42,179
...but I ripped this off a pad.
What's that?

986
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:45,700
- "Alba Varden, Thursday."
- What do you think?

987
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,548
Is that Hitler's girlfriend?

988
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:48,819
That's Eva Braun.

989
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,827
He has a date with her Thursday.

990
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:52,549
Her name sounds familiar.

991
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:55,344
- You know her?
- No. It just sounds familiar.

992
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:57,182
Alba Varden...

993
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:00,302
There's a deli. Pull over.
Let's eat, I'm starving.

994
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:01,619
I'll spring.

995
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:03,582
Let's go. Sounds good to me.

996
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,701
- Out the other side.
- Other door, Leo.

997
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:11,979
Out the other door.

998
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,066
No cars.

999
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:29,509
Vorstedt!

1000
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:34,988
That policeman.

1001
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:47,422
You should pick from the bottom.

1002
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,461
They put the old stock on top.

1003
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,659
Officer Riggs.

1004
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,666
I followed you from the consulate.

1005
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:55,939
You followed me?

1006
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:00,029
Well, I needed some pork chops
and a toilet brush too.

1007
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:03,748
I wanted to apologize...

1008
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:06,783
...for the other day,
in case we frightened you.

1009
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:09,823
I was a bit startled
by all those guns.

1010
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:13,023
I'm sorry.
And I wanted to thank you too.

1011
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,503
Thank me for what?

1012
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:22,669
You don't like your boss
very much, do you?

1013
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:26,427
There's a lot I don't like
about my boss and my country.

1014
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:29,062
But I like my job very much.

1015
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:31,386
It keeps me here in Los Angeles.

1016
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:32,665
You like this town?

1017
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:35,379
That's a new one.

1018
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:39,389
- I forgot your first name.
- It's Rika.

1019
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,023
Rika Van Häagen-Dazs.

1020
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:43,983
- Ice cream?
- No, Van Den Haas. It's Dutch.

1021
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:45,748
That's a real pretty name.

1022
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:52,703
- Got a rabbit or is that your dinner?
- It's mine.

1023
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:54,229
Shop one day at a time?

1024
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,943
Good police work.

1025
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,061
I get paid for that.

1026
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:00,147
I don't shop for the entire week.

1027
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:01,499
No? Why not?

1028
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:05,029
I never know what I'll be hungry for.

1029
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:08,786
Wait. Have dinner with me.

1030
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:14,581
I got a nice place on the beach.
A good view from every window.

1031
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:16,109
A beautiful sunset.

1032
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:19,586
Come on, be original, say yes.
Everyone else says no.

1033
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:21,826
Come to my place.
I'm a gourmet cook.

1034
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:23,418
Let go of the basket.

1035
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:24,540
I'll scream.

1036
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,660
- Don't.
- I will.

1037
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:26,746
Please...

1038
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:29,942
I'll embarrass you.
You'll turn red like that apple.

1039
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:32,186
- Come on with me.
- No. No, please.

1040
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:36,145
Lady, let go of my bag!
Hey, look! Somebody call a cop!

1041
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:39,023
What are you doing?

1042
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,460
Let's go before someone calls a cop.

1043
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,069
You are a cop.

1044
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:53,705
You must be an honest
cop, Martin Riggs.

1045
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:58,665
It ain't much, but it's everything
I said. Look at the view.

1046
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:03,105
I did exaggerate about one thing.

1047
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:06,541
I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.
I can only make chili.

1048
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,026
- Do you like it with or without Oreos?
- With, of course.

1049
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:11,868
A woman after my own heart.

1050
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:13,783
Careful. Watch your step.

1051
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:15,545
Sam wants in.

1052
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,739
Here, sit down.

1053
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,269
Wait a minute.

1054
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,269
It's a little filthy.

1055
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,660
I haven't got wine. How about a beer?

1056
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:32,859
That's fine.

1057
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:35,025
She drinks beer.

1058
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:53,664
What's wrong? You got a dirty glass?

1059
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:57,300
Oh, it's a wedding ring.

1060
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,183
I used to be married.

1061
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,379
But not anymore?

1062
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:04,862
No. Not anymore.

1063
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,584
I got something on the stove.

1064
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:16,748
Is Rudd hiding behind
his diplomatic credentials?

1065
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:18,178
What's that?

1066
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,788
Rudd's hiding behind
his diplomatic credentials.

1067
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:24,823
He's not a very nice guy.

1068
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:30,779
Then whatever he's doing,
he shouldn't get away with it.

1069
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:40,263
How's it hanging, Wyler?

1070
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:43,422
- What the hell do you want?
- I hope better than Murtaugh.

1071
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,262
Easy. Easy.

1072
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:49,299
Tell me, have your brains
ever seen the light of day?

1073
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:52,303
Who are you?
What do you want? I'm a cop!

1074
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:53,869
No, you were a cop.

1075
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:55,903
Honey, we're gonna be late.

1076
01:12:56,110 --> 01:13:00,023
I'm just gonna take a couple laps
before I go down to the station.

1077
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:55,066
<i>Sam, take a hike.
No Stooges tonight. Go on!</i>

1078
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:59,308
He's sweet.

1079
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:17,579
Get a beer, man.

1080
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,984
Don't worry about it.

1081
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:21,141
Cavanaugh, are you in or out?

1082
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,659
I'm out.

1083
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:24,503
Put some music on.

1084
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:36,460
- Who's not accounted for?
- Riggs and Murtaugh.

1085
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,628
Murtaugh's taking the witness
to a new location.

1086
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:41,866
- What about Riggs?
- Hasn't checked in.

1087
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:43,947
Get on the radio and find them!

1088
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:48,103
We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.
How many do we have to lose?

1089
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:51,985
Let's worry about the ones
that are alive, all right? Do it.

1090
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:54,069
Sorry, captain.

1091
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:01,909
Get me Riggs.

1092
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:10,189
I'll get that.

1093
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:29,346
Thanks to you, I missed my poker game.
And I was feeling real lucky.

1094
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:34,303
Okay. So what I see are nice
conservative tax returns.

1095
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:37,582
Everything by the book.
Everything black and white.

1096
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,264
You have to play around
in the gray areas...

1097
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:42,421
...if you want to see some bucks.

1098
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:45,986
Your salary's not much to work with.
You need deductions.

1099
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:47,589
- My boat.
- Can't deduct it.

1100
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:51,539
- No, it's the bill of sale.
- I know, but you can't deduct it.

1101
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:53,582
That's it, my boat! Let's go!

1102
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:55,058
- Go where?
- To my house.

1103
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:56,942
- For what?
- My boat, man.

1104
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,868
Look at this commercial!

1105
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:02,062
Look at the body on this kid.
She is so hot.

1106
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,465
What are you doing?
Look at the girl!

1107
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,467
You hit the button...

1108
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,901
- I didn't hear you say that.
- Say what? She's great.

1109
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:12,908
She has a great body.
Makes me want to buy rubbers.

1110
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:24,139
It's time for the
seventh-inning stretch.

1111
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:29,942
That's a baseball expression.

1112
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,663
I know.

1113
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:34,704
But we're only up
to the fourth inning.

1114
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,069
Batter up!

1115
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,588
Stay in the car.

1116
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:54,306
I'll only be a minute, okay?

1117
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:57,868
I don't want to stay.
It's cold. You have no door.

1118
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:01,745
You're the reason there's no door.
Turn on the heat if you're cold.

1119
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:05,989
Don't touch anything.

1120
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:08,181
Nothing. I mean nothing!

1121
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,902
Alba Varden...

1122
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:14,868
Why do I know the name?

1123
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:17,026
It's here. It's gotta be.

1124
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:21,185
<i>- Another day, another hobby.
- Yeah, what's new?</i>

1125
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:28,418
The day on my boat.

1126
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,821
Not there. Where is it?

1127
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:34,743
My birthday.

1128
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,668
I'll be damned.

1129
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:07,869
<i>Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.</i>

1130
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:10,186
Leo, I told you to stay in the car.

1131
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:11,819
Shit!

1132
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:16,820
Son of a bitch,
what are you doing here?

1133
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:16,303
Nailed them both.

1134
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:30,783
My car.

1135
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:34,829
Leo!

1136
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:32,183
Get up, get dressed.

1137
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:33,379
What is it?

1138
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:35,262
Get dressed. Trust me.

1139
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:41,028
- I don't understand.
- Trust me.

1140
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:43,505
Something's wrong.
I got a bad feeling.

1141
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,786
- I don't understand.
- Put this on.

1142
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,303
Get in the truck.
The keys are under the seat.

1143
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:53,308
When they stop to reload,
run for the truck.

1144
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,466
- What about you?
- I'll be okay.

1145
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:57,865
I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!

1146
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:59,503
Stay out of the light.

1147
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:46,262
Master race.

1148
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:08,345
It's all right.

1149
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,585
You shit! You shit!

1150
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:19,220
- Who were those people?
- You tell me. Was it your husband?

1151
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,068
What are you doing Saturday?

1152
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:32,624
It's Sam!

1153
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:37,708
Get your head down!

1154
01:23:54,350 --> 01:23:55,339
Come on, Sam!

1155
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,149
Come on, Sam!

1156
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:58,465
Come on, Sam.

1157
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,629
- Shake a leg.
- Come on, boy.

1158
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,067
Has he got any holes in him?

1159
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:11,181
You clever dog!

1160
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:20,749
I promised I'd have you home by 11:00.

1161
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:23,623
This is the most
incredible first date.

1162
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:25,627
Wait until the second.

1163
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:29,067
- No more helicopters, please.
- Okay, I promise.

1164
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,980
This is a nice building
you've got here.

1165
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,865
Any vacancies? I'm between homes.

1166
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,788
You can stay right here.

1167
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:38,620
I can?

1168
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,298
Yes, there's a vacant
apartment up there.

1169
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,823
I was kidding. You can stay with me.

1170
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:48,265
Tonight?

1171
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:52,099
Yes. Tonight and tomorrow night
and the night after that.

1172
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,260
And after that?

1173
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,267
Don't push your luck.

1174
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,262
I gotta go.

1175
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:08,059
- But you said...
- Go inside and lock all the doors.

1176
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,784
And you're not going to work tomorrow.

1177
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:14,027
There's better ways of staying
in L.A. Than that job.

1178
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:16,425
All right. I've just quit.

1179
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:44,582
I'll just grab a few things...
I forgot, I haven't got anything.

1180
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,826
Just bring yourself.

1181
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,743
I gotta go.

1182
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:52,469
Bye.

1183
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:09,259
Go home!

1184
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:10,778
Go!

1185
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,143
Go get the girl.

1186
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:48,826
I was going to offer you a drink,
but I understand...

1187
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:50,304
...you're on the wagon.

1188
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:52,307
That stuff will kill you quick.

1189
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:55,263
You know so much about me,
who the hell are you?

1190
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:02,149
I'm the guy that changed
the course of your life.

1191
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:04,662
Four years ago...

1192
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:07,219
...when you was a narc
down at Long Beach...

1193
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:10,581
...you were getting too close.
We put a contract on you.

1194
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:12,587
I handled it myself.

1195
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:15,298
Drove your car off the road, remember?

1196
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:18,020
But you weren't driving, were you?

1197
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:21,544
You can't imagine the surprise.

1198
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:26,460
I pulled back this matted mop of
bloody hair to see this woman's face.

1199
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,258
Your wife, right?

1200
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:33,546
She didn't die straight away.

1201
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:36,948
It took a bit of time.

1202
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:45,786
Don't have much luck
with women, do you?

1203
01:29:53,950 --> 01:29:55,941
<i>She's dead. They killed her.</i>

1204
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:57,378
Where are you?

1205
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:59,945
They killed her. She's dead.

1206
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,629
They killed them both.

1207
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:05,300
Slow down. Who are you
talking about? Where are you?

1208
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:07,660
<i>She's dead, Roger. She's dead.</i>

1209
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:12,905
Just calm down. We'll take
care of it. Where are you?

1210
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:16,900
I'm not a cop tonight.
It's personal. I'm not a cop.

1211
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:20,028
You don't know what happened tonight.
There's more.

1212
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:25,467
I'm gonna get those bastards
and fuck them! I'm going there now.

1213
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:29,948
We're not going to the fucking
stilt house. We're under orders!

1214
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:32,300
Then the stilt house will come to me.

1215
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,899
You don't understand.
They killed them both.

1216
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:37,465
<i>- They got Rika and my wife.
- Don't hang up!</i>

1217
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,549
Shit.

1218
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:58,419
What's the deal?

1219
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:02,228
You talk to the feds,
but you don't talk to me.

1220
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:03,465
That's not fair.

1221
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:08,908
We trusted you, Leo.

1222
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:11,945
You betrayed us.

1223
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:14,819
You took our money!

1224
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:21,866
We want it back now,
you slimy little shit.

1225
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:26,100
Give him some more.
He seems to like it.

1226
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:00,621
Don't try and stop me.

1227
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:03,219
I've seen that look
in your eyes before.

1228
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:06,783
They declared war on the police.

1229
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:08,983
You know about that?

1230
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:11,425
I heard it on the radio.

1231
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:14,021
We don't have the authority.

1232
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:15,464
Cavanaugh...

1233
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:17,581
...Wyler, Shapiro...

1234
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:22,949
...Rika, Vicki. How much
fucking authority do you need?

1235
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:26,103
You got a plan?

1236
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:32,864
If you drive around
the front of the house...

1237
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:35,106
...you wait for my signal...

1238
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:38,463
...and then just go in
and shoot those fuckers.

1239
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:39,659
They got Leo.

1240
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:43,258
Be careful.

1241
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:52,699
What's your signal?

1242
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:56,026
You'll know it when it happens.

1243
01:32:58,670 --> 01:33:01,059
Somehow I think I will know.

1244
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:33,664
Payday.

1245
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:48,582
Feel like talking, Leo?

1246
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:54,665
It's the big one!

1247
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:00,105
All right. Cool it.

1248
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:02,619
- Watch him.
- Move me away from the windows!

1249
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:35,625
Watch the glass!

1250
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:36,865
- Come on!
- I'll go.

1251
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:13,065
Riggs, you crazy mother...

1252
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:30,742
Holy Christ!

1253
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:35,825
You all right?

1254
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:37,059
I'm okay.

1255
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:38,305
Thanks.

1256
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:41,420
- Was Adolf in there?
- He got away.

1257
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:44,227
- I'm gonna find him.
- What about Leo?

1258
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:45,499
What about Leo?

1259
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:47,587
You're on your own now, Leo.

1260
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:49,189
What do you mean?

1261
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:52,700
Take my car to the station
and wait for the federal marshal.

1262
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:55,060
It's been an experience knowing you.

1263
01:35:59,230 --> 01:36:02,108
- I don't want a hug.
- Give the little fellow a hug.

1264
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:04,102
I had a lot of fun.

1265
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:06,348
You do your duty now.

1266
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:08,745
Don't worry.
I'll really get them now.

1267
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:11,259
- Listen! Wait!
- You know how to find him.

1268
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:13,461
Is it okay if I sound the siren?

1269
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:17,104
Loud as you want.

1270
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:18,339
Really?

1271
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,745
- Okay. Really?
- Bye, Leo.

1272
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:26,584
<i>Check it out.</i>

1273
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:30,266
<i>The Alba Varden is
a cargo ship, not a woman.</i>

1274
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:33,826
<i>The Port Authority said that
the Alba Varden arrived today...</i>

1275
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:36,783
<i>... and heads out tomorrow
to South Africa.</i>

1276
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:40,621
This is the 11 th dock.

1277
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:43,708
It must be here someplace.
I know I'm right.

1278
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:49,626
The ship.

1279
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:51,263
What did I tell you?

1280
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:55,629
That container there,
with three heavy hitters.

1281
01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:56,899
Let's have a look.

1282
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:00,900
I'll take two of them out.
You take one.

1283
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:06,338
Better yet, you take two,
I'll take one. Pull over.

1284
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:52,939
I can't see shit.

1285
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,947
Me either. What is this shit?

1286
01:37:55,150 --> 01:37:56,629
Got a light?

1287
01:37:58,150 --> 01:38:00,186
It's gotta be Rudd's, whatever it is.

1288
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:02,506
I still can't see shit.

1289
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:07,467
- You got something?
- I don't know. It's a car.

1290
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:14,779
Holy shit. Fort Kno x!

1291
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:19,821
Hell, how much is it?

1292
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:22,863
Thousands.

1293
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:26,227
Fucking millions!

1294
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:29,144
Billions!
A fucking Donald Trump lotto!

1295
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:39,865
Look at this.

1296
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:42,785
These are thousand-dollar bills.

1297
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:48,423
With what I'm holding, I could put
all three of my kids through college.

1298
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:50,699
Take it.

1299
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:59,423
Fucking drug money.

1300
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:01,222
Do something good with it.

1301
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:04,024
Rudd won't need it where he's going.

1302
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:17,788
Load the container.

1303
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:21,545
Next time the sun hits their bodies,
they'll be in Cape Town.

1304
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:28,149
- This thing's moving.
- It sure as hell is.

1305
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:30,984
- What are we gonna do now?
- I don't know.

1306
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:32,909
Let's shoot our way out.

1307
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:35,021
Don't do that. I got a better idea.

1308
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:28,823
Our money.

1309
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:33,940
Just make sure they're dead.

1310
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:47,785
- You go first. I'm too old.
- No, you go first. I'll cover you.

1311
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,620
- How do we get out?
- I'm going this way.

1312
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:06,980
I'll go this way.
I'll check over here.

1313
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:25,345
Rog!

1314
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:27,539
Rog!

1315
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:22,339
Shit!

1316
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:27,988
Riggs, you okay?

1317
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:45,219
Drop it, asshole!

1318
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:53,710
Diplomatic immunity!

1319
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:06,018
It's just been revoked.

1320
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:23,508
You're breathing. You're alive.
You're not dead.

1321
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:25,343
No, don't die.

1322
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:29,190
You're not dead until I tell you.

1323
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:33,178
You got that, Riggs?
You're not dead until I tell you.

1324
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:34,948
You got that, Riggs?

1325
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:37,903
You're not dead until I tell you.

1326
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:40,106
Now breathe with me. Breathe.

1327
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:41,868
- Now, breathe.
- Hey, Rog.

1328
01:46:46,830 --> 01:46:49,060
Rog, in my pocket.

1329
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:59,502
I want you to throw those things away.

1330
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:02,270
Those things will kill you. Really.

1331
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:09,861
You son of a bitch!

1332
01:47:11,230 --> 01:47:12,583
I thought you were dying.

1333
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:16,142
I didn't die on your toilet,
I'm not dying in your arms.

1334
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:17,863
You son of a bitch.

1335
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:25,986
Are they all gone? The bad guys?
Did you get them?

1336
01:47:26,350 --> 01:47:28,545
<i>They been de-kaffirnated.</i>

1337
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:39,589
Don't make me laugh! Oh, Jesus.

1338
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:44,060
Did anyone ever tell you...

1339
01:47:46,150 --> 01:47:48,584
...you really are a beautiful man?

1340
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:54,741
Give us a kiss before they come.

1341
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:58,906
Where'd that bullet hit you anyway?

1342
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:04,903
Don't make me laugh!

1343
01:52:36,870 --> 01:52:37,859
