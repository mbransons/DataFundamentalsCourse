1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,300
<i>Kilimanjaro
is a snow-covered mountain, 19,710 feet high...</i>

3
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,400
<i>and is said to be
the highest mountain in Africa.</i>

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,100
<i>Close to the western summit, there is
the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard.</i>

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,700
<i>No one has explained what the leopard
was seeking at that altitude.</i>

6
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
Look at 'em.

7
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,900
I wonder, is it sight or is it scent
that brings them?

8
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,700
<i>They've been about for ever so long.
They don't mean a thing.</i>

9
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,200
The marvelous thing is
that it's painless now.

10
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,300
- Is it really?
- Yes.

11
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,400
That's how you know when it starts.

12
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
<i>They're a filthy bird...</i>

13
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,100
but they know their business.

14
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
I used to watch the way they sailed
very carefully at first...

15
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,300
<i>in case I ever wanted to use
one of them in a story.</i>

16
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,500
<i>That's funny now.</i>

17
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,400
I've gotten so nervous,
not being able to do anything.

18
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,500
I think we might make it as easy as possible
until the plane comes.

19
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,200
Or until the plane doesn't come.

20
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,700
Mr.Johnson hasn't been a white hunter
for a quarter of a century...

21
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
not to know his way around.

22
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,200
If he can't get a plane,
he'll be back with another truck.

23
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,200
One way or another,
it's not very important.

24
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,200
I feel so helpless. I wish there was
something I could do.

25
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,000
You can take the leg off.

26
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,100
Or you can shoot me.
You're a good shot.

27
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,400
I taught you to shoot, didn't I?

28
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's not be melodramatic, Harry.
You're not going to die.

29
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,600
No? I'm dying now.
Ask those things.

30
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,900
<i>They're around every camp.
You never notice them.</i>

31
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,100
I don't see why this had to happen
to your leg in the first place.

32
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,500
What have we done... either one of us...
to have had this happen to us?

33
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,400
Well, I suppose that what I did...

34
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,500
was forget to put iodine on it
when I first scratched it.

35
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,900
We were after the impala,
in case you've forgotten.

36
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,900
<i>And with a camera, at that.</i>

37
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,900
Ow! Ow!

38
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,800
That isn't what I meant,
and it isn't how you got your leg.

39
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,900
- No?
- Not at all.

40
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
It was at the lake last week.

41
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,100
<i>It was a lovely, peaceful day...</i>

42
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,100
<i>and those enormous hippos
were having their own party.</i>

43
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,600
<i>We could've passed them by
without incident...</i>

44
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,300
<i>but... oh, no... you had to
get so awfully playful.</i>

45
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,300
Look at them.
There must be hundreds of them.

46
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Harry, look at that one!

47
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,500
Look at that big one over there!

48
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,600
Harry!
I wouldn't chance it any closer.

49
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,900
Harry! Be careful!

50
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,600
- Harry!
- What's the matter? You frightened?

51
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,600
- Not in the least.
- Well, let's go!

52
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,600
Come on. Come on!

53
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,400
Harry, easy.
You're asking for trouble.

54
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,700
Harry, look. Here. Here.

55
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,300
Harry! Harry, we've lost
one of our boatmen.

56
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,700
What?

57
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Harry!

58
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,500
<i>And you insisted on carrying the boy
in your arms all the way back to camp.</i>

59
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,500
And it was from all his blood and dirt
that you got that infection.

60
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,400
That could be the point of view.

61
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,000
From yours, it would be contact
with the lower classes.

62
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,900
Being a writer, I prefer to think
that it was a quirk of fate...

63
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,300
a mere prick of a thorn...

64
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,100
that laid the great man low.

65
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,700
A lot it matters now.

66
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,800
<i>Harry, please.!</i>

67
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,500
<i>- Molo!
- Bwana.!</i>

68
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,500
<i>- Whiskey soda. Make it pronto, Molo.
- It's bad for you.</i>

69
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,400
- No, it isn't. It's good for me.
- It's not good for you.

70
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,900
<i>No. It's Bad for Me.
Cole Porter wrote the words and music.</i>

71
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,200
There, that's poetry.
Oh, I'm full of poetry now.

72
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,100
- Rot and poetry... rotten poetry.
- Harry.

73
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Harry, it said in the first-aid book
to avoid all alcohol.

74
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,500
It's not good for you.
That's what I meant by giving up.

75
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,400
You must do everything you can.

76
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,000
Ah, you do it.
I'm too tired.

77
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,900
I'll take this,
if only to keep it away from you.

78
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,100
That's a pretty good rule for life:

79
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,800
Take everything you can,
if only to keep it from somebody else.

80
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,000
Wish I'd followed it.

81
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
I'm sure Molo understands more English
than you think he does.

82
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,400
- Molo.
- Bwana?

83
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Go away or stuff your ears so you won't
hear the civilized people fighting.

84
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,700
Harry, if you think
you have to die...

85
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,800
is it absolutely necessary for you
to kill off everything you leave behind?

86
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,600
You think this is any fun for me?

87
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,100
I don't even know why I do it.

88
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,100
Trying to kill
to keep yourself alive, I imagine.

89
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,800
- You won't die if you...
- It's not dying, not in itself, that matters!

90
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,200
It's dying of failure.

91
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,100
Leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

92
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,700
How does a man miss the boat?

93
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,300
Did I ever tell you
about my beginning...

94
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,600
when I was young?

95
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,100
- With my first love?
- No, you didn't.

96
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,200
And I'm not sure I want to hear it.

97
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,100
I'll tell you all about it
over this drink.

98
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,200
You'll tell me without.

99
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,600
There are plenty of things
you're lucky I haven't told you.

100
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,300
This little ditty had everything...

101
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,700
drama, tragedy...

102
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
love and poetry.

103
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,900
Simply everything.

104
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,800
<i>Cut the stall.!</i>

105
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,800
I'm done with you!
More big words!

106
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,200
Big words! I'm through being insulted
as if I were some tramp!

107
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,600
- You can fly a kite, both of you!
- Connie! Connie!

108
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,300
- Uncle Bill doesn't mean...
- Oh, yes, he does! You know he does!

109
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,900
The old mossback!
The nasty, dirty, stubborn old mossback!

110
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,900
- He only said we ought to wait.
- Ha! Wait? I like that, coming from you.

111
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,200
- I didn't say...
- You bet you didn't!

112
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,800
Not once all summer when you wanted
to hug and kiss me and get fresh.

113
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,100
And all those things about where
you'd take me and what we'd do.

114
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Not once did you yell to me to wait!

115
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
" I love you!"
You don't even know what love is!

116
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,100
- Connie!
- Oh! Go fly a kite!

117
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
Come in, Harry.
She'll recover.

118
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,800
- Connie, I'll shove off for you!
- You shoved off already!

119
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,300
<i>- You still intend to become a writer?
- Yes.</i>

120
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Well, there are different
kinds of writers...

121
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,100
just as there are different
kinds of everything.

122
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,500
You can become another hack.

123
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,500
It's easy...
peddle soap to housewives.

124
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,000
Nothing wrong with peddling soap.

125
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,100
Make a fortune.

126
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>But I'll tell you the only
right approach to real writing.</i>

127
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,200
It's like a hunt.

128
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,400
It's a hunt in which a man pits his brains
against the forces of ignorance and evil.

129
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,900
It's a lifelong and lonely safari.

130
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,100
The prey he seeks
is a truth worth telling...

131
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,500
a faith worth living by...

132
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,000
something worth
spilling his guts about.

133
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,000
He must track it down by himself.

134
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,200
I don't know if you'll be one
to have the fortitude to stick it...

135
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
to follow the spoor
no matter where it leads...

136
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,200
to what pain and suffering...

137
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,400
through hell and high water.

138
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,400
If you are, God help you.

139
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,800
God pity you.
And good luck.

140
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,900
<i>I beg you not to ruin yourselfbefore you start
by loading your pack with excess baggage.</i>

141
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,500
That's my business, isn't it?

142
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,300
Yes. Yes, it is.

143
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,700
You know, you're young.

144
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,100
You'll need to travel and learn.

145
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Education.

146
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,200
I'd like to help.

147
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,600
<i>I think I've made clear the conditions.</i>

148
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,800
Your birthday next week. Here.

149
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,500
From now on, you might regard
that Springfield as your own.

150
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,100
<i>Shall we have a try
for deer tomorrow?</i>

151
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
<i>Good weather for it.</i>

152
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
Oh, I've lived, all right...

153
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,400
but where has it got me?

154
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,300
To a camp in Africa with you...

155
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,300
my rich, beautiful wife.

156
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,600
Before you, how many others?

157
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's traveling alone...

158
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,200
in a pig's eye.

159
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, have it your way, Harry.

160
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,600
I'm gonna shoot some game.
The larder's almost empty.

161
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
I'll change into my boots
and call Molo.

162
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,300
Helen. You shouldn't pay
any attention to me really, darling.

163
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I love you, you know.

164
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,700
Why, I've never loved anyone
the way I loved you.

165
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,100
I won't take any more, darling.

166
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,900
Well, before you go...

167
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,400
come here, hmm?

168
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,900
Give me a kiss.

169
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,100
- And leave me this.
- Harry! Why do you have to turn into a devil?

170
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Because if I can't die happy,
I can try to die delirious.

171
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,200
How can I help you
if you won't help yourself?

172
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,800
By going to sleep?
No, thank you.

173
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,700
There'll be plenty of that
soon enough.

174
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,000
What time I've got left,
I've got plenty to think about.

175
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
I'll leave you to your thoughts.

176
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,900
Only this time,
try to get some of them straight.

177
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Just go do your killing.
That's what we're good at... both of us.

178
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,200
- Abdula!
- Abdula!

179
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,400
- Get out the Springfield!
- Get out the Springfield!

180
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
- And the solids!
- And the solids!

181
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
- Harry!
- Emile!

182
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,300
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.</i>

183
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,600
<i>Et, quelle est votre désir?</i>

184
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,800
In English, that's quite a question.

185
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Now, from other sources.

186
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,900
- Hi, Compton.
- Harry! How's the book?

187
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,600
How's anybody's book?
It isn't finished.

188
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,400
Harry, did you quit
your job to do it?

189
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Look, do you mind if I cut in?

190
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,700
Uh-uh-uh! Forage for yourself, chum.

191
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,200
Oh, Harry, you don't stay?

192
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,200
It's a case of avoiding
a broken nose, Emile...

193
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,600
mine or old Compton's...

194
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,900
because a laugh like hers would
just have to lead it to a lousy fight.

195
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,100
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

196
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,700
<i>Please.</i>

197
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Thanks. I'm Cynthia.
Cynthia Green.

198
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,400
Cyn. That's nice.

199
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,900
- When did you come in?
- Oh, minutes ago.

200
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,800
I'll be hanged.

201
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,300
The latest thing from home.

202
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,800
<i>- I'm, uh...
- Harry Street, Chicago Tribune. And you write.</i>

203
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,500
<i>Ex-Chicago Tribune.
And I'm trying to write.</i>

204
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,600
Well, they're telling it the other way.
Do you mind?

205
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,100
Well, everybody's trying
something over here.

206
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,400
Or at least trying to try.

207
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,100
What are you trying to do?
Are you trying to paint?

208
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,100
No, I'm not trying to paint.

209
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,000
- Are you trying to sculpt?
- No, I'm not trying to sculpt.

210
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,600
Then you must be trying
to write too.

211
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,800
No. I'm only trying to be happy.

212
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,900
Well, everybody's trying something.

213
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,500
I'll bet I'm the only person in the whole
darn place who's only trying to be happy.

214
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,500
You'd better take this from me.
I sometimes drink too much.

215
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Anything's fair
in the pursuit of happiness.

216
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Oh, I'm not completely idle.
I... I pose sometimes.

217
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,400
In what my maiden aunt calls
"the altogether"?

218
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Sometimes.

219
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We all have to make our way
with whatever we were given.

220
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,900
Oh, hasn't that African
got any piety at all?

221
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
Uh...

222
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,900
I'm remembering my manners.

223
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Are you... Compton's lady?

224
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,700
No. I'm not particularly
Compton's lady.

225
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm not Compton's lady at all.
I'm my own lady.

226
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,500
How would you like it if you and I
would just " piety" right out of here?

227
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,000
I expect I'd like it very much.

228
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,900
My father was a soldier.

229
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,100
He had the bad luck
to get himself killed in the Argonne.

230
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
So, after the war I came over...

231
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,400
to take him home to rest.

232
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,400
But once I saw France, I decided
that this is as good a place to rest as any...

233
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,700
for him and for myself.

234
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
So I stayed on.

235
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,100
- No mother?
- No, not for years.

236
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,600
I see.

237
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Well, uh...

238
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,200
where shall we go
and rest right now?

239
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,000
Would you like to go and rest
in another bar, have another drink?

240
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,800
No, I'm afraid I've gone
and had too many again.

241
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,400
You know, in Paris...

242
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,000
nobody ever thinks of suggesting
just going home... to rest.

243
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
May I have a cigarette?

244
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,300
Could you... conceivably
picture yourself as Harry's lady?

245
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Will you be kind to me?

246
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,600
I think I'm a little afraid of you.

247
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,100
<i>There are so many things
that I've not written...</i>

248
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,700
<i>and that I'll never write now.</i>

249
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,400
<i>I've written only
that first time in Paris...</i>

250
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,100
<i>the Paris that I loved.</i>

251
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,500
<i>The Place Contrescarpe...</i>

252
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,800
<i>where the flower sellers dyed
their flowers in the street.</i>

253
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,200
<i>The dye ran purple over the paving stones
where the autobus started.</i>

254
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,600
<i>And the children played in the streets
in the spring sunshine.</i>

255
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,500
<i>And the wood and coal man's place.</i>

256
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,000
<i>He sold wine too.
Bad wine.</i>

257
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,400
<i>And the golden horse's head
outside the Boucherie Chevaline...</i>

258
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,000
<i>where the carcasses hung yellow,
gold and red in the window.</i>

259
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,100
<i>And the green-painted cooperative
where we bought our wine.</i>

260
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,300
<i>Good wine, and cheap.</i>

261
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,000
<i>Our apartment was a room and a half.</i>

262
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,900
<i>There I did my work,
and Cynthia took up housekeeping.</i>

263
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,300
<i>And together we did all of the things
which go to make up living.</i>

264
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
Harry.

265
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,800
Harry.

266
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,700
Darling?
Your breakfast is ready.

267
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,800
Hello.

268
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Hello.

269
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,500
<i>We knew our neighbors
in that quarter. We were all poor.</i>

270
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,700
<i>And in that poverty
and in that quarter...</i>

271
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,700
<i>I finished that first book.</i>

272
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,500
<i>A good book...
the start of all I thought I was to do.</i>

273
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,400
<i>And I called it
The Lost Generation...</i>

274
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,400
<i>not knowing at the time
how much it was about my Cynthia.</i>

275
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,300
Harry!

276
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Harry!

277
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,700
<i>Harry.! Darling.!</i>

278
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,600
- Oh, Harry, darling, it's been accepted!
- What?

279
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,300
- Your very first book, and it's gonna be published.
- No!

280
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,300
- Yes, and now we can get that...
- How much is the advance?

281
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,700
- The check. Yeah. How much?
- Oh!

282
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,500
It isn't so very much,
but it isn't so little either.

283
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,600
Well, you're right.
It isn't so very much.

284
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
It'll do if we pinch.

285
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,600
Darling, now we can get
that lovely apartment on the Seine.

286
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,800
Now we can go to Africa.

287
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Oh!

288
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,600
<i>And there never was another time for me...</i>

289
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,400
<i>like that first time in Africa.</i>

290
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,800
Three of'em.
A bull and two cows.

291
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,300
Good!

292
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,600
- He says he's a fine bull.
- I know what he says. When do we get going?

293
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,200
We'll get downwind
and work up on 'im.

294
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,700
Don't you think it's time
the memsahib had the first shot?

295
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,900
- What?
- No, I don't want it.

296
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,900
- How correct you are, Mr.Johnson.
- I definitely don't want it!

297
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,700
- Come on. You'll do it marvelously.
- Come on. He's all yours!

298
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Now, take it easy.

299
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Just imagine
he's a tin can in the camp.

300
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,000
- But he's not a tin can. I don't want to do it.
- Shoot low at this distance.

301
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,600
Careful. Don't spook him.

302
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,600
Now!Just set him squarely
in your sights.

303
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,100
Brace yourself and squeeze.

304
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,300
Dearest Harry, please shut up.

305
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,200
Come on. Hurry up!

306
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,600
Will you shoot, for...

307
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,600
- You missed.
- I told you I didn't want to do it.

308
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
No harm done.
Everybody misses.

309
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,400
I never claimed I was a hunter.
You're the hunter.

310
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,800
Yes, and you,
the great white hunter.

311
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,100
Sure, sure. Come on, Annie Oakley.
Have yourself a drink.

312
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,800
- Don't let the master ride you.
- Shall we get going?

313
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,500
- He took cover there.
- What do you mean, " get going"?

314
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,000
- Where will he break out?
- I won't go, and I don't want you to. I'm frightened!

315
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,100
You scared him half to death.
There won't be anything to it.

316
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,300
All right.
Then if you're going, so am I.

317
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,800
- Oh, no, you're not. Is she, Mr.Johnson?
- You married her.

318
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,900
You're gonna stay here with Simba.
I was only having fun.

319
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,400
Harry. Don't you want to kiss me?

320
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,700
Kiss you good-bye?
Well, aren't you extravagant?

321
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,600
You stay here and be brave.

322
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,500
Harry! Harry!

323
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,800
<i>- Harry.!
- Go back.!</i>

324
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,000
- Go back!
- Harry!

325
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Look lively. Look lively.

326
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,100
Harry!

327
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,200
<i>Harry.!</i>

328
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,600
It's a funny moment when an animal
comes out of the bush at you.

329
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,800
A million things
seem to happen at once.

330
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,600
- Is it always like that?
- It's very simple.

331
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,600
Either you run or you get busy.

332
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,200
It's not at all simple.

333
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,700
You could write a lot about it
if you could get it just right.

334
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,900
Different feelings
at the different times.

335
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,600
Today it was like,
uh, an explosion...

336
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,000
of purest joy.

337
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,700
It was like a dam bursting.

338
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,300
Why is it everyone who comes to Africa
has to write a book about it?

339
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,500
One silly beggar
even dedicated his to me.

340
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,500
Never came back,
or I'd have shot him in the pants.

341
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,800
Can't you two let it alone,
even at night?

342
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,600
- Well, we're talking about your rhino.
- He wasn't mine.

343
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,000
He was all yours.
All we did was polish him off for you.

344
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,200
Anybody want another look
at that horn?

345
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,300
A pretty good horn.

346
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,100
What's the matter with me,
Mr.Johnson?

347
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Everybody isn't required
to like Africa, you know.

348
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,700
I try to put up a show
because I know he loves it so.

349
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,500
But all of it... the hunting, the killing...
it terrifies me.

350
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,100
See here. This thing
that he was talking about...

351
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,100
the excitement... call it courage.

352
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,700
The way he feels it is a man's feeling,
natural in a man.

353
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,600
<i>Grows in a man and makes him a man.</i>

354
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,600
Not particularly to his credit
if he has it...

355
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,400
but something lacking if he hasn't.

356
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,600
A woman shows her courage
in other ways, many ways.

357
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,300
I've got another fear now...worse.

358
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
I'm going to have a baby.

359
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,200
What?

360
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,400
We came to Africa for trophies.

361
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,000
Harry's got his, and I've got mine.

362
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,900
Well, it's natural enough, isn't it?

363
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,700
Shall I tell him?
What'll he think?

364
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,200
Mr.Johnson,
when I first met Harry...

365
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,900
- How's your drink?
- No, thanks.

366
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,000
I'll have some.

367
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,900
All my life, I'd just been drifting.
Nobody, no place.

368
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,500
I guess you'd say I had
no personal security.

369
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,400
But when I first
got to know Harry...

370
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,200
You should've seen him in Paris.
Have you ever been to Paris?

371
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,400
No. Unnatural maybe,
but I never had the desire.

372
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,100
Makes no difference.
You've seen him here.

373
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,500
There was I, weak and needy.

374
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,500
And there was he,
strong and confident.

375
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,200
Every bit of me said
this is all of it.

376
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,800
When we first went
to live at his place...

377
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,900
I was happy just to sit and watch him
as much as I could...

378
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,700
content to just sit still and hold on
to my feeling of safety.

379
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,400
But Harry was never still,
even when he worked.

380
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,500
No sooner had he finished his first book
than he said we were going to Africa.

381
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,000
I didn't want to stir,
but I felt that if I told him so...

382
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,300
I'd lose something.

383
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,000
And now he's... He's already talking
about other places.

384
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,900
If I tell him about this anchor,
this child...

385
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,300
this... this load of responsibility...

386
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,800
It isn't things I want... believe me,
nothing like it...

387
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,300
but only him as a rock
to hold on to.

388
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,500
So, shall I tell him now...

389
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,600
and risk beginning to lose him...

390
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,300
or put it off and see
if something happens?

391
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Isn't it enough I have to guide
you greenhorns on safari?

392
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,400
Am I hired to be an old nurse too?

393
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,400
Be Mr.Johnson, my friend.

394
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,800
- Really?
- Please.

395
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,600
Now, see here.
I'm just a hunter.

396
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,700
I can only say it
the way I know how.

397
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,700
It's when you run away,
you're most liable to stumble.

398
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,700
<i>Well, they may have
better horns in museums...</i>

399
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,800
but 33 inches is nothing
to be ashamed of.

400
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

401
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,100
- What's the matter with him?
- He's going to bed.

402
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
It's too early.
I feel too good.

403
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,500
Oh, I wonder if there'll ever be
another time as good as this.

404
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,000
- Harry...
- Listen.Just listen.

405
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,700
That's a bedtime lullaby, eh?

406
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
There's an awful lot
of everything there is in this...

407
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,400
hunger, love, hate, fright.

408
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,600
There's a wonderful book in it.

409
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,400
Maybe I'll write it someday.

410
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,300
Darling.

411
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Don't spoil it.

412
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,700
Don't talk it all away.

413
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,100
<i>Now, as soon as you reach Paris,
see your own physician.</i>

414
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,700
I'm sure he'll confirm
what I've told you.

415
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,700
You'll have to be quiet.
No running about. No excitement.

416
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,500
Probably means your spending much
of the time in bed.

417
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
- Clear?
- I understand.

418
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Some women are like that.

419
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,900
If you want the child
badly enough...

420
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,600
it won't seem
like such a sacrifice, now, will it?

421
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,900
Shall I have a talk
with your husband?

422
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,800
Oh, no. I'll tell him.
Thank you, Doctor.

423
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,100
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

424
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,600
Oh, I'll take that.

425
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,900
- Oh,just put it right there, please.
- Yes, darling.

426
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
Hmm? Oh!
I thought you were...

427
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
- On the table, sahib.
- Look what just arrived.

428
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
A letter from the publisher
and a check.

429
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,800
It isn't very much,
but it's a check.

430
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,900
- Everything's gonna work out all right.
- What will, darling?

431
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
All of it.

432
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,100
Say, what'd old sawbones say?

433
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,900
Nothing frightful?
Didn't pick up a fever?

434
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
- No, I...
- What did I tell you?

435
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,000
All you need's a change of climate.
We'll go directly to Madrid.

436
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,800
We'll have the bullfights,
the Grecos at del Prado...

437
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,300
then up to Pamplona
in time for the fiesta.

438
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,400
- Harry.
- Luckiest timing in the world.

439
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,300
Darling, couldn't we just go home?

440
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,600
Home?

441
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Where's that?

442
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,000
You mean back to Paris.

443
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,100
Well, why?

444
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,400
Just to go home.

445
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,400
Look, darling, we can get
a nice apartment with the check...

446
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
with a room for you to work in.

447
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,900
You don't have to go
to Spain, do you?

448
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,900
No, darling, I don't
have to go to Spain...

449
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
or anyplace else.

450
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,300
You just want to.

451
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,400
Look, Cynthia, if I have to sound
like a lousy stiff that had a mission.

452
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm trying to become a writer.

453
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,300
It's a writer's business
to buzz around...

454
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,900
find out about things for himself...

455
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,800
not sit on his can in a comfortable chair
and reach for a bookcase...

456
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
for something to crib from.

457
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,200
And after Spain?

458
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,100
How do we know?

459
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,300
I mean, you never want
this other normal thing?

460
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,600
I'm trying to explain
what is my normal thing.

461
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,200
- With maybe children?
- Children?

462
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,800
Darling, I want a child
more than anything in the world.

463
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,300
Something of my very own
to hold on to.

464
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,200
Well! Well, sure.

465
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,900
I love kids, but later.

466
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,300
We've got lots of time.

467
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,600
Look, Cyn, the world is a market...

468
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,100
in which you buy
what you want...

469
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,600
not just with money, but with your time,
with a lot of things.

470
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,300
It's an exchange.
You give something, and you get something.

471
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,400
I'm giving up a piece of my life...

472
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,200
to get something
that I need for my work.

473
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,600
Later on, we can afford what we can afford.
It's as simple as that.

474
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,800
I see.

475
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,100
Can I fix you a drink?

476
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,700
It's a little bit early, isn't it?

477
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,200
It seems to me to be just about
the right time. Do you object?

478
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
No.

479
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,700
Look, Cyn, if you have
this yen to go to Paris...

480
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,500
well, you can go there.

481
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,900
Without you?

482
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,800
I'm not saying that I want it.

483
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,200
I'm just saying
that you can go there.

484
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,200
Or if...

485
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,000
If it's a matter
of life and death...

486
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,700
okay, I'll go with you.

487
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,300
I'll go change the tickets.

488
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,300
Harry!

489
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,800
<i>Get a doctor.! Call an ambulance.!</i>

490
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,700
- Mr. Street?
- Yes.

491
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,100
- I'm Dr. Simmons.
- How do you do? How is she?

492
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,600
I'm sorry to have to tell you
she lost the child.

493
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,100
- The what?
- You didn't know, Mr. Street?

494
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,300
Exactly what happened?

495
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,600
They told me at the hotel that there'd...
been an accident. That's all.

496
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:49,200
A nasty fall. She'll be quite all right
after a few days' rest.

497
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,100
Do you actually mean
you didn't know about the child?

498
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,500
Don't you people talk to each other?

499
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,000
You did it deliberately.

500
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,000
- It was an accident.
- You did it because of what I said.

501
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,500
It was an accident.
I stumbled.

502
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,800
You didn't have any right to do it.

503
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,200
It was my child too, you know.

504
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,000
Don't, darling.

505
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,100
Oh, Cyn.

506
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,200
Oh, darling.

507
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,300
Stupid little idiot.

508
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,200
Now... we can go to the bullfights.

509
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,800
For this one,
I got seats way up here. Better?

510
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,900
Anything you say, darling.

511
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,300
From up here, you can see
the whole thing as a spectacle.

512
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,500
It's quite a sight.

513
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,600
<i>- ˇOlé!
- ˇToro!</i>

514
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,800
<i>ˇOlé.!</i>

515
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
<i>ˇOlé.!</i>

516
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,300
<i>ˇOlé.!</i>

517
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,300
ˇOlé! ˇOlé!

518
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,000
<i>- ˇOlé.!ˇOlé.!
- ˇToro.!</i>

519
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,500
<i>ˇOlé.!</i>

520
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,400
<i>ˇOlé.!ˇOlé.!</i>

521
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,600
<i>ˇOlé.!</i>

522
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,200
You know, darling,
I think that dancer likes me.

523
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,100
All right. The dancer likes you.
I like you too, darling.

524
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,900
Yes, but his liking is new,
and yours is old.

525
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,100
An old, old story that's ending.

526
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,600
What did the telegram say, Harry?

527
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,600
Darling, you don't want to be childish.
You've read it.

528
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,100
They offered me an assignment
to cover the fracas in Damascus...

529
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,300
between the Syrians and the French.

530
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,100
Yes, that's what it said,
but that isn't what it meant.

531
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,700
- It meant that I'm beginning a lifetime without you.
- That's real nonsense.

532
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,600
Then why didn't you ask me
to go with you?

533
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,100
Darling, there's a war
going on there.

534
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,200
There's a war going on here too...
right here at this table.

535
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,000
There's a dandy little war going on.

536
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,200
- Darling, you shouldn't drink too much.
- No, no.

537
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,800
I shouldn't do a lot of things too much.
I shouldn't love you too much.

538
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,300
I'm awfully bad for you.

539
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,200
We're so hopelessly in love,
and we can't make it work.

540
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,900
That's nonsense, darling.

541
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,800
I shouldn't have wanted
to be happy too much.

542
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,900
I expected it to come like a gift.

543
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,200
Then I shouldn't follow you around.

544
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,700
I'm a drag on you,
and I hate every bit of it.

545
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,700
I shouldn't even have wanted
to have your child.

546
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,300
- It wasn't fair to you.
- Cynthia. Cynthia.

547
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,000
Cynthia.

548
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,900
You've got to forget that.
You're driving yourself crazy.

549
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,600
Yes, I ought to forget.

550
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,400
I ought to just go back
to Paris alone, as you say...

551
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,800
and not drive myself crazy at all
while I wait for you and wait and wait.

552
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,500
Don't you even know you're lying?

553
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,500
- I'm not lying.
- No.

554
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,700
No, it isn't a lie yet.

555
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,600
It won't be a lie until you go away
and discover you're not coming back...

556
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,700
but are going on and on
and see the whole world...

557
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,600
even if you lose it for us.

558
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,400
You know, I think this dancer
likes me very much.

559
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,300
All right, the dancer
likes you very much.

560
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,300
It ought to make me very happy.

561
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,500
It makes me feel dreadful.

562
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,100
Shall we invite him
over to the table?

563
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,200
Do you think his manners
would be as nice as yours?

564
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,200
Do you think he'd ask me first
if I'm Harry's lady?

565
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,100
Women can pick the times
to start a row.

566
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,500
It's not a row, darling.
It's very sad.

567
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,400
You with your ambition,
me with my guilt.

568
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,900
A lot of things are sad.

569
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,100
Why do they put the pads on the horses
in the bullfights?

570
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,000
- I've told you that.
- Tell me again.

571
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,900
It isn't so the horses
won't feel the hurt, is it?

572
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,200
It's only for the spectators...

573
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,000
so they won't see
the horses' insides.

574
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,200
Yes, it is for the protection
of the spectators.

575
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,300
I knew you wouldn't like the horses.

576
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,700
But I desperately like the horses.

577
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,100
I know just how the horses feel,
with their nice pads to protect them from the spectators.

578
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,600
You ought to put some pads
on me to protect you, poor darling.

579
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,200
Cynthia, will you kindly,
kindly, kindly stop?

580
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,900
Yes. I shouldn't talk too much.

581
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,900
That's another of the things
I do too much.

582
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,500
Excuse me for a moment?

583
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,600
Excuse me for a moment?

584
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,300
Harry!

585
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,200
It's all right, dear.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

586
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,400
Bravo!

587
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,100
Will you send this
right away, please?

588
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,200
<i>Immediately, Seńor Street.</i>

589
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,500
<i>The lady left, seńor.</i>

590
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,800
Where did she go?

591
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,100
I don't know, inasmuch as she left
with the dancer.

592
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,600
She what?

593
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,700
She said to tell you, if you inquired,
there was no use of looking for her.

594
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,500
She said she is not coming back.

595
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Where's the mem?

596
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,500
She went out to kill something.

597
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,200
She's very good at killing.
I taught her.

598
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,700
Heigh-ho!

599
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,200
When the party's over, you're likely
to get left with your hostess.

600
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,700
Oh, yes.
Here she comes now.

601
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,400
Yeah. I suppose I'm as well off
with her as any other.

602
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,000
She's a splendid woman
by all standards.

603
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,100
Maybe if I close my eyes,
she'll go away.

604
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,200
- Make a good shot?
- Oh!

605
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

606
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,700
Rather a good shot...
through the shoulder.

607
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,800
You shoot marvelously, you know?

608
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,700
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

609
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,700
I thought maybe you would.
You were sleeping when I left.

610
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,400
- Shall I relieve Molo?
- No. He wants to shave me, and I want to talk.

611
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,200
- Well, everyone must have someone to talk with.
- He's the perfect audience.

612
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,200
Doesn't understand a word I tell him.
Therefore, we don't quarrel.

613
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,500
Let's not quarrel anymore,
no matter how nervous we get.

614
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,200
You needn't be afraid of me anymore.

615
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,600
I'm not afraid of you.
I never was.

616
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,100
- Will you call me if you need me?
- Sure.

617
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,700
Come back anytime
you feel like it. Molo.

618
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,400
You know...

619
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,000
you Africans may have the right system
with women at that.

620
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,300
Buy one for a few cows...

621
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,600
whatever it is you happen
to use for money.

622
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,200
And if she isn't satisfactory,
you get your money back.

623
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,200
We use our emotions.

624
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,200
And if it cracks up...

625
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,000
we don't get anything back.

626
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,500
Ouch!

627
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,700
Sure, sure.

628
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,200
Bwana's whiskers very tough.

629
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,400
<i>A lot of things are tough.</i>

630
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,400
You know, son,
there was one woman...

631
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,300
<i>And what a woman.</i>

632
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,300
<i>I wrote a book about her too.</i>

633
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,500
<i>Another woman, another book.</i>

634
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,900
<i>Wasn't about Spain or Africa
or anything that I cared about.</i>

635
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,700
<i>But into it I poured
the anger that I felt...</i>

636
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,900
<i>and some dirt
and belly-laugh humor...</i>

637
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,200
<i>Just right to tickle
the smart ones on the Riviera.</i>

638
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,100
<i>And I'd found something, son.</i>

639
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,800
<i>I'd found success.</i>

640
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,000
You swim very well.

641
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,800
Naturally, when I have
an incentive...

642
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,100
swimming to you, darling.

643
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,000
Do you do everything else as well?

644
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,000
I swam over... Don't, Harry!

645
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,400
What's the matter?

646
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,600
You afraid of startling the fish?

647
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,800
Afraid of you.

648
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,400
Frigid Liz.

649
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,100
I swam way over to tell you
that I've changed your plans.

650
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,800
- You are not going away tonight.
- No?

651
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,500
Well, swim around and tell me
why you think I'm not.

652
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:38,000
Because you run around,
and what does it get you? Only dizzy.

653
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,300
If you have to write, I have a typewriter
at home I'll let you call your own.

654
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:47,500
You've got a few other things at home
I'd like to call my own.

655
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,000
I can't let you go, darling.

656
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,400
I can't let go of you.

657
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,800
Countess, there's no one like you.

658
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,800
- Climb up here on this boat.
- I can't, Harry!

659
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,200
- I've hardly anything on.
- Get up here.

660
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,200
Please, lover. Not out here.

661
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,800
<i>I suppose it was the elusiveness of Liz...</i>

662
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,200
<i>which was her main attraction.</i>

663
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,300
<i>She was something to hunt down
and trap and capture.</i>

664
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,400
<i>The Countess Elizabeth...
"Frigid Liz. "</i>

665
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,500
<i>The semi-iceberg of the semi-tropics.</i>

666
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,200
It was fun, son.

667
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,500
It was just lousy with fun.

668
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,200
It would be much more polite
if you'd say it, darling.

669
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,400
For once, I'm speechless.

670
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,600
At least say that you don't like it.

671
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,400
But I do... immensely.

672
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,500
I admit that something
has me puzzled.

673
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,100
Would you mind
answering one question?

674
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,500
Not at all.
What's the question?

675
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:33,200
Well, why do you want her for this?

676
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,300
I admit she must be nice
to have around... for Harry.

677
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,300
Yes. I don't think I introduced you.

678
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:45,100
Beatrice, this is
my fiancé's nice uncle, Mr. Swift.

679
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,300
<i>Enchanté, monsieur.</i>

680
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,700
Beatrice? There's a fine lot
of divinity in that name.

681
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,300
- Dante, you know.
- Yes, darling, I know.

682
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,600
<i>- Beatrice, are you divine?
- Oui, monsieur.</i>

683
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,900
I'll just bet.

684
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:07,300
- Tell me, Uncle Bill... Oh, may I call you Uncle Bill?
- By all means.

685
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,700
Are you planning
a long visit with Harry...

686
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,300
now that you are back from India?

687
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,200
I'm afraid not.
Are you?

688
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,300
I'm not visiting Harry.
Harry is visiting me.

689
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,100
Well, whichever, it must be wonderful
for both of you.

690
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,200
We think so.

691
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,200
As I look at her again,
another question crosses my mind.

692
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,700
As interesting as the last one?

693
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,000
When you and Harry get married...

694
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,300
how many children will you have?

695
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,600
Why don't you go ask him?

696
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,700
I may.

697
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,900
By the way, where is genius
shining at the moment?

698
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,700
- In his study.
- Probably doing something constructive.

699
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,800
I like it here.

700
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,300
I don't bother you?
Just continue.

701
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,400
Tell me.
Have you named her yet?

702
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,500
You have a suggestion?

703
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,400
Ceres... the goddess of fertility.

704
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,700
<i>- Madame?
- Oui?</i>

705
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,600
<i>Merci.</i>

706
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,200
Excuse me.

707
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,900
Why don't you finish her
for me while I'm gone?

708
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,400
Oh, good. Come on in.

709
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,100
<i>- Now I can stop.
- If you do, I'll go away again.</i>

710
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,000
Just let me sit here, tidily in the corner.

711
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,600
- Fine view.
- It ought to be. Cost a pretty penny.

712
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,300
Did you see Liz?

713
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
Speaking of a pretty penny?

714
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,900
No,just speaking of Liz.

715
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,900
Marry her, my boy.
It's the surest cure.

716
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,500
<i>- What do you mean by that one?
- Lover, may I come in?</i>

717
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,300
You are everywhere,
aren't you, darling?

718
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,700
It's the only attribute
I share with the Almighty.

719
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,000
Angel, are you doing anything
that's stinkingly important?

720
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,000
Confidentially, Countess, it couldn't be
less important or more stinking.

721
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,200
What, silly?

722
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,300
I'm writing an interview with myself
on the subject of success.

723
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,100
- Hear! Hear!
- Your latest has sold another 100,000, it says here.

724
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,000
- Amazing.
- Hollywood wants it.

725
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,700
- They say they'll put Garbo in it.
- That should please you.

726
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,900
How did I get in the habit of becoming involved
with women who always open my mail?

727
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,000
You get such fascinating letters, darling.

728
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,200
<i>Cosmopolitan wants another series
of short stories. And Smart Set too.</i>

729
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,500
They pay the tops, it says.

730
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,300
<i>Well, why should a writer feel guilty...</i>

731
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,600
because people are willing to pay
good money for the sweat off his brow?

732
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,500
They shouldn't, my boy.
No one ever paid for a drop of mine...

733
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,800
except a few libraries and museums.

734
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,900
Which reminds me
to tell you...

735
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:56,300
- I've decided to settle down and take over that museum.
- That's wonderful news.

736
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,500
- Does that mean we'll see you often, darling?
- When you're in Paris.

737
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,500
My bones will be on display amongst the other
antiquities every day except Thursday...

738
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,400
on the Avenue President Wilson.

739
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,900
- Harry, dear boy.
- I'll walk out with you.

740
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,400
I'll find the door.
I imagine you're wanted in there.

741
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,000
Why the devil haven't you the grace
to tell me the truth?

742
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,000
- What truth?
- That you think my book stinks.

743
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,400
That everything I'm doing stinks.

744
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,500
I came to praise Caesar,
not to bury him.

745
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,100
Most men would envy you.
You make a handsome living.

746
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,600
You have the acquaintance of most
of the interesting people of the world.

747
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,100
All this and Liz too.

748
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,800
You're young. You have your health.
You look well.

749
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,000
Fairly well.

750
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,300
Come to see me soon, dear boy.

751
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,700
<i>Oh, Harry.
Have you done any hunting lately?</i>

752
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,700
- No. Why do you ask?
- Too bad.

753
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,200
A man should never
lose his hand at hunting.

754
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:08,600
<i>I had it all, and what did I have?</i>

755
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,500
<i>My name in the papers,
my face in the better magazines.</i>

756
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,200
<i>And where was Cynthia?</i>

757
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,600
<i>People asked for my autograph
and pointed me out.</i>

758
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,700
<i>Why didn't she come back to me?</i>

759
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,800
<i>At last, I made a cry for help...</i>

760
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,300
<i>getting her American address
from Emile.</i>

761
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,200
<i>And so, my darling Cynthia...</i>

762
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,300
<i>I've never been able
to kill the loneliness...</i>

763
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,500
but only made it worse.

764
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,100
Everyone I've been with
has only made me miss you more.

765
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,100
And what you did can never matter.

766
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,600
I cannot cure myself of loving you.

767
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,700
<i>Then one day outside the Ritz...</i>

768
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:00,200
<i>I followed a woman
whom I thought was you.</i>

769
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,100
<i>I follow any woman
who looks like you in some way...</i>

770
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,000
<i>afraid to see that it's not you...</i>

771
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,200
<i>afraid to lose
the feeling it gives me.</i>

772
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,300
- Yes?
- Oh...

773
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,900
I beg your pardon.
I thought you were someone else...

774
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:22,200
Someone I know. I'm really sorry.
I didn't know you were...

775
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,200
A woman with a family?
They're my brother's children.

776
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,100
Now, why did I tell you that?

777
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,500
Aren't you Mr. Harry Street,
the writer?

778
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,700
That's right, I'm afraid.

779
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,700
I think I'm rather sorry
I'm not the right one.

780
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,600
<i>- Anything interesting?
- Routine.</i>

781
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,600
<i>A few interesting bills
for you to foot.</i>

782
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,100
No, I mean that letter
you're trying to hide.

783
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,600
Darling!

784
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,900
- How are you? Poopie.
- Angel.

785
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,200
You came just at the right moment.
Now, let's see.

786
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,600
I don't think you've met
my fiancé, Mr. Street.

787
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,500
Contessa...

788
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,800
How do you do?
As a patron of the arts...

789
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Now sit down and let Charles
pour you a drink.

790
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,200
My devoted fiancé and I are just
in the middle of a little something.

791
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,300
Who is this... this Cynthia Green?

792
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,200
" Hotel Florinda, Madrid."

793
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,400
She must be a girl
named Cynthia Green.

794
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,800
Is she a fan of yours?

795
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,400
- Not the last I heard.
- From Madrid.

796
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,600
- My dear, devoted fiancé has so many fans.
- And I am one of them.

797
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,000
Oh, I just devoured your last book.

798
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,500
I hope it didn't
give you a bellyache.

799
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,000
Is this letter so important, Harry?

800
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:02,700
No. No, it isn't important at all.

801
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,300
Good. Then you shan't
be troubled with it.

802
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,800
Excuse me.

803
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,200
Harry.

804
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,700
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

805
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,800
- I won't let you go.
- Ah.

806
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,200
- I won't let you make a fool of me.
- Ah.

807
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,300
You said it was not important.

808
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,900
- The whole thing is not important.
- Harry, listen to me.

809
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:51,000
Lover, darling,
stop and listen to me.

810
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,800
Please, Harry,
stop and listen to me.

811
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,100
" Please, Harry."
I'm listening.

812
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,000
- I know that sometimes I must draw your nerves.
- Ho.

813
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,800
- And sometimes you are on my nerves too.
- Ho, ho.

814
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,000
I know that sometimes...

815
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,500
sometimes I'm inadequate for you.

816
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,599
I know my faults.

817
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,200
But I love you, darling.
Truly I do.

818
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,100
I love you as much as I can...

819
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,700
and if there is something
deeply troubling you...

820
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,500
- Yes, there is something troubling me.
- Then only tell me.

821
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,700
It may be the dawning
of suspicion...

822
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,300
but the fact that the airplane
is faster than the horse...

823
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,500
does not necessarily prove
that the world is getting any better.

824
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,700
No, I mean about us.

825
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:37,700
About us there is nothing
troubling me deeply at all.

826
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,300
Where are you going?
Are you going to Madrid?

827
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,800
Perhaps I'll go to Madrid.

828
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,400
I'll send you a postcard.

829
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,700
Oh, Harry, you look so silly.

830
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,300
Such a fool, trying to look...

831
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,700
like a knight questing
for the Holy Grail.

832
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,000
Maybe you're right.

833
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,500
Maybe I'll just have me
a good look-see for the Holy Grail.

834
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,300
- Horses, Harry!
- The same to you...

835
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,700
with tassels on 'em!

836
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,800
- Horses, Harry!
- The same to you, Countess.

837
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,200
<i>My Cynthia
was not at the Hotel Florinda in Madrid...</i>

838
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,500
<i>or anywhere else.</i>

839
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,400
<i>The lousy civil war
had fixed Madrid.</i>

840
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,500
<i>Before I knew it,
I was carrying a gun...</i>

841
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,700
<i>and I wished I weren't.</i>

842
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,500
Do you know an American driver
by the name of Cynthia Green?

843
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,700
<i>Yo no entiendo inglés, seńor.</i>

844
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,900
<i>Con permiso.</i>

845
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,500
Wish I was back in Detroit.

846
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,200
<i>- You're an American, huh?
- Yeah.</i>

847
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,400
Wish I was back in Detroit...

848
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,800
where I was when I got
sucked into this.

849
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,100
I just woke up
I got sucked into this.

850
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,900
You believe any of that bushwa?

851
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,700
- No.
- What are you doing here?

852
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,300
You'd die laughing if I told you.

853
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,200
<i>ˇCompańía, adelante.!</i>

854
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,900
Blessed Mary, Mother of God.

855
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,500
Blessed Mary, Mother of God.

856
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,200
Oh, please, let Harry find me.

857
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,800
In thy great bleeding heart...

858
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,300
please find room for my prayer.

859
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,300
<i>Cyn...</i>

860
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,500
- Cynthia! Cynthia!
- Oh, darling!

861
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,100
- You're...You're hurt.
- Only a little. Oh!

862
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:14,100
- You're very hurt.
- Only a little.

863
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,000
Not like the horses.

864
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,200
Harry.

865
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,700
- I'll get help.
- No. No.

866
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,800
Stretcher bearers!

867
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,700
Darling?

868
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,900
- Did you believe my letter?
- Every word.

869
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,000
About the child too?

870
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,300
Yes, about the child too.

871
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,900
Stretcher bearers!
Oh, God!

872
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,300
Darling, I was so wrong
about the child.

873
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,100
I know that God would punish me.

874
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,800
You? You...

875
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,400
In his infinite mercy.

876
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,100
You should spit on me.

877
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,600
Stretcher bearers!

878
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,900
<i>Here!</i>

879
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,100
They're coming.
Darling. Darling.

880
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,600
Will you excuse me...

881
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,800
of so many things?

882
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,300
Oh, it's funny.

883
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,800
When you touch me,
I still turn giddy.

884
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,300
I could be dying,
and if you touch me, I turn giddy.

885
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,500
You won't die.

886
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,900
<i>- Here. Here. Here.
- Vamos.</i>

887
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,000
<i>Vamos.</i>

888
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,000
<i>- Aprisa, aprisa.
- Careful.</i>

889
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:01,000
I knew you'd find me.

890
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,100
<i>Cobarde.</i>

891
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,900
<i>Monsieur Street.
Monsieur Street. Monsieur Street.</i>

892
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,700
Uncle Bill. I came as soon
as your letter caught up with me.

893
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,900
- My dear boy.
- What is all this?

894
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,300
We'll get you a good doctor.

895
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,500
Doctors.

896
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:27,900
It was a wise man who said that if all
the medicines were dumped into the sea...

897
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,000
it would be a horrible day for the fish.

898
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,700
But don't worry about me.

899
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,900
I shall be in excellent hands
before long.

900
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,200
What about yourself now?

901
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,600
- You don't look happy.
- I'm all right.

902
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:46,600
What have you been doing
with yourself all these years?

903
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,800
- You've traveled?
- Followed my nose.Just wandered.

904
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
- But about you...
- Where? Where? Where? Tell me where.

905
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,800
- Hmm?
- Nothing to brag about.

906
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,600
Oh, I've seen
the Seven Wonders of the World...

907
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,700
if that's what you mean...
or however many there are.

908
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,800
They're not very wonderful.

909
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Then you haven't really seen.

910
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,200
You haven't hunted.

911
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,100
Hunted.

912
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,900
- Yes.
- Well, why should I?

913
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:19,200
I'm exactly the way the world
pays me a very good living to be.

914
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,600
I amuse the people
with my little tales.

915
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
This I can do with my left hand...

916
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,100
which leaves my right hand
free for other things.

917
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,100
I've destroyed my talent...

918
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,700
by not using it...

919
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,300
by betrayals of myself...

920
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,500
the things I believed in.

921
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,600
By drink...

922
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,200
by laziness...

923
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,700
by pride and by prejudice...

924
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
by hook and by crook.

925
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:56,500
What is this, a catalog of old books?

926
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,600
Harry.

927
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,000
Once I hunted...

928
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,200
in Spain...

929
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,700
for the Holy Grail...

930
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,000
but they busted the Grail.

931
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,700
They busted her all to pieces.

932
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,500
The Grail...

933
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,100
Why should I blame them?
I killed her.

934
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,600
I... I don't understand.

935
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:29,000
Well, Harry, in your absence...

936
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,400
I've kept you with me
as well as I could.

937
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,900
My latest.
Did you hate it?

938
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:38,400
I love everything you write, Harry.

939
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,700
But you couldn't finish it.

940
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:44,800
Take out the envelope.
It's for you.

941
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,000
In it you'll find
the legacy I'm leaving you...

942
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,400
when I lay down my bones
amongst the other relics here.

943
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,600
But I don't need anything.

944
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,000
- Are you sure?
- Oh, the royalties are rolling in.

945
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,100
That's one thing
about success...

946
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:01,600
Even when it's a failure,
it snowballs for a while.

947
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,500
There's also one thing
about a snowball...

948
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,000
It has nowhere to go
except downhill.

949
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,200
Well, that's not money.

950
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,800
It isn't anything...

951
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,700
material.

952
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,200
Oh, I thought and thought
about what I might leave you.

953
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:25,200
Finally, I...
I wrote a little something.

954
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,400
A riddle.

955
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,800
A riddle?

956
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,700
<i>I don't want you to read it
until after I've gone.</i>

957
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,800
Because you might
ask me the answer...

958
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,300
and I don't know the answer.

959
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,700
<i>But if you can find it...</i>

960
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:46,100
it'll save you.

961
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:24,600
- What is that?
- It's a pretty fine place,Jake.

962
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,000
<i>Ah. Bonsoir, monsieur.</i>

963
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:31,300
<i>Is it... Harry.!</i>

964
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,700
Oh, young Harry.

965
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And this place looks wonderful.

966
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,200
It looks just the same.

967
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,300
The same...

968
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,400
dirty, smelly...

969
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,500
It's the same wonderful place.

970
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,100
Excuse me.
This new abomination...

971
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,300
Oh, no, no, no.
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

972
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,400
Why do you let 'em
change it out there?

973
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,600
Who gave 'em the right
to spoil it like that?

974
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,300
Here we don't change.
We have no business, but no change.

975
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,400
Oh, look. See?

976
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,100
- The same.
- Ah.

977
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:10,600
That's because
it's preserved in a bottle.

978
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,400
You know, Emile, it might be
a pretty good idea for us too.

979
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,400
Formerly, when you came here,
you were not bitter.

980
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,800
Formerly...

981
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:23,500
when I came here...

982
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,400
You know, there was one night...

983
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,700
when I came here...

984
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,700
No, no.

985
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,700
You're right, Emile.
You look behind you, and what do you see?

986
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,400
Only a backside.

987
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,100
We must think of the future.

988
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:20,100
I have been left... a legacy.

989
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,600
Yeah...
You too,Jake.

990
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,800
It is a riddle.

991
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,900
" Kilimanjaro...

992
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:38,500
" is a snow-covered mountain,
19,710 feet high...

993
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:43,900
" and is said to be
the highest mountain in Africa.

994
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,200
" Close to the western summit...

995
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:51,400
" there is the dried
and frozen carcass...

996
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,700
of a leopard."

997
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,800
In all that snow?

998
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,400
So they would have us believe.

999
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,000
Some lousy cat got cold feet.

1000
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,700
Oh, no, no.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1001
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,800
Here comes the kicker.

1002
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,200
" No one has explained
what the leopard was seeking...

1003
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,300
at that altitude."

1004
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,900
Is that all?

1005
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:28,000
It's an unsatisfactory story.
It ends badly.

1006
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,600
But what was the leopard
doing up there in the first place?

1007
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,300
That's the riddle.

1008
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,500
And if I can find the answer,
I'm supposed to win a prize.

1009
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,800
Come on. Let's put
our fine minds together,Jake.

1010
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,400
Perhaps he took the wrong turn
and followed the wrong scent...

1011
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,600
and so he got lost and died.

1012
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,000
Yeah.

1013
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,600
That's a very sensible solution, Emile...

1014
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,000
for him...

1015
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,400
and for me.

1016
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,300
<i>Please?</i>

1017
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,800
<i>Are you...</i>

1018
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,600
May I?

1019
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,700
Cyn?

1020
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:13,200
Thank you.
Am I mistaken?

1021
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:17,100
Aren't you Mr. Harry Street, the author,
whom I met in the Place Vendome?

1022
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,700
Yes, I'm Mr. Harry Street...

1023
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,100
and I'm lost.

1024
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,500
And you...

1025
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,100
Why, how...

1026
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,500
how very beautiful you are.

1027
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,200
Excuse me, my dear Cynthia...

1028
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,300
but tonight
I'm a little the worse...

1029
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,700
for many years of wear and tear.

1030
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:58,300
- You need rest, Mr. Street.
- Yes, I need rest, Mr. Street.

1031
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:04,200
I need a lot of things, Mr. Street.

1032
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,000
I...

1033
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,200
I need...

1034
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
you.

1035
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:33,500
Would you like a drink?

1036
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,900
- What did you say?
- Well, I'm going to have one.

1037
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,100
Why don't we have one together?

1038
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,200
Ask Molo.
You know I don't speak the lingo.

1039
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,400
Molo?

1040
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,000
Whiskey-soda.

1041
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,400
About which one have you
been thinking, Harry?

1042
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:54,500
- What do you mean, about which one?
- About Cynthia or about Liz?

1043
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,000
What makes you think
you know so much?

1044
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,100
Maybe I was thinking
about you and me.

1045
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:06,000
No. Never about you and me.

1046
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,100
At least, not with any honesty.

1047
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,300
Well, that just shows you
how wrong you can be.

1048
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,800
I was thinking
about the way we met...

1049
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,600
on the bridge near Notre-Dame.

1050
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:22,100
When you mistook me
for your Cynthia?

1051
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,300
You've never been able to forgive me
for not being her, have you?

1052
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,300
Do you really want
to go into that one?

1053
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,900
What else did you think
about you and me, Harry?

1054
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,600
Mmm...

1055
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,500
That we had a lulu of a beginning.

1056
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:46,600
It was really a lulu.

1057
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,800
Yes, we had that, all right.

1058
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,700
Well, neither of us were children.

1059
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,900
We both knew what we were getting.

1060
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:59,900
Why did you suddenly
want to come here?

1061
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,600
You owe me the courtesy
of being honest.

1062
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,300
All right.

1063
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,900
I'll be honest.

1064
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,000
Because why I wanted to come here...

1065
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:19,300
is the point
of the whole bloody joke.

1066
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:25,400
Because I'd found the answer to a riddle.
That's why.

1067
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,600
About a leopard...
who'd lost his way.

1068
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:37,100
And I thought that if I had
followed the wrong scent...

1069
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,500
and was going to perish...

1070
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:43,400
then I'd better get back
to the jungle from where I'd started.

1071
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,200
It had been good here.

1072
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,800
I had been right here.

1073
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:54,200
And I thought I could get back
to it that way...

1074
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,500
back into training...

1075
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,500
work the fat off my soul...

1076
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:02,000
<i>the way a fighter
goes into the mountains...</i>

1077
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,900
<i>to work the fat offhis body.</i>

1078
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,500
I might have made it, too...

1079
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:11,400
if two weeks ago
that thorn hadn't needled me.

1080
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:35,200
That foul smell
crosses here every night...

1081
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,700
every night for two weeks.

1082
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,800
He's the one who makes
all the noise at night.

1083
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,000
I don't mind him too much.

1084
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,500
<i>You know what that bad breath
just said to me?</i>

1085
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:52,100
- The hyena?
- That it's getting very late for me.

1086
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,100
- Aren't you funny?
- That lousy timepiece.

1087
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:00,000
Really, darling, aren't you be...

1088
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:06,200
Harry.

1089
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:10,800
- What is it?
- Huh?

1090
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,100
It's nothing.

1091
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,900
How do you feel?

1092
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:21,400
All right.

1093
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,800
A little wobbly.

1094
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,900
- Can you eat something now?
- No.

1095
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,900
A little broth
will keep your strength up.

1096
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,600
I don't need my strength up.

1097
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,400
Don't tell me you don't know.

1098
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:50,000
Well, I've known everything...

1099
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,900
except just when it would happen.

1100
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Try, darling.

1101
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,500
Helen.

1102
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,000
I want to write.

1103
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,500
I know.

1104
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:27,700
Do you really?

1105
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,500
I know almost all of it now...

1106
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:34,600
except one very important thing
which you must tell me.

1107
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,000
Harry, was it entirely
because of her...

1108
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:39,400
that it was the best time
for you here?

1109
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,100
- Who?
- Cynthia, whom twice you mistook me for.

1110
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,900
Was it only because
you were happiest here with her?

1111
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:50,800
If you thought all that,
why did you come along?

1112
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,500
Why do you think?

1113
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:58,600
You were always a considerate woman.

1114
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,300
You'd have bought me anything.

1115
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:06,000
You'd like anything new and exciting.
I don't know.

1116
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,700
I more than came along,
if you'll remember.

1117
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,900
I arranged with the publisher
for your advance.

1118
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:13,800
- I lied to you. I contrived it.
- Why?

1119
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,100
Because it was
the only chance for you.

1120
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,400
And because it might be
a chance for me.

1121
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:25,100
I thought that
if I was here with you...

1122
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:28,200
and your work came well
and you were happy here again...

1123
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,600
with me here...

1124
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,400
Don't make me lose all my pride.

1125
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:46,900
This is the first time
I've ever really seen you.

1126
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,200
You're not a failure, darling.

1127
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,300
Just because
you've disappointed yourself...

1128
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:55,100
with some of the things you've written,
that's not failure as a man.

1129
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:57,200
You've brought something
to everyone...

1130
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:00,900
just as you brought something to me.

1131
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,800
You're quite a woman.

1132
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,600
It's a pity
I'm finding it out only now.

1133
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,900
I love you, Harry.

1134
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:17,200
I love you with all my heart.

1135
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,500
We've got a whole lifetime
ahead of us.

1136
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,900
You had every card in the deck
stacked against you.

1137
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:30,900
- If we had the time...
- There'll be plenty of time.

1138
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,700
You're going to live.
You've got to live.

1139
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:36,700
Plenty of time...
That's what you think.

1140
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:40,000
That's what they all think.

1141
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,100
That's why they sit on their tails.

1142
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,500
Let's not kid ourselves.

1143
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:51,000
A door can open
suddenly into nothing...

1144
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,900
and death has been standing there
all the while.

1145
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:00,300
If a man hasn't done
what he intended to do...

1146
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:24,000
Who is he?

1147
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:28,300
One of the boys of the local clinic
of the Mayo brothers, I do believe.

1148
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,800
A witch doctor?

1149
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,900
That's right.

1150
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:45,000
He's the uncle of the boy
I tried to save from the hippo.

1151
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,100
Send him away.
We don't want him.

1152
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,400
He's heard that I'm sick
with the bad spirits.

1153
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,500
He wants to be in on the kill.

1154
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:07,300
- Get rid of him, Harry. He gives me the creeps.
- Ask Dr. Pasteur to sit down.

1155
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,800
Please send him away.

1156
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,900
He's eating a root of some special sort
to sharpen his wits.

1157
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,400
Now he's gonna roll the bones.

1158
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,600
No fooling.
In that stinking cat-skin bag...

1159
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,800
he's got a couple of dozen bits
of bones...

1160
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:52,200
from the hind legs of anteaters...

1161
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,800
and tortoises, baboons and whatnot.

1162
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,900
From the pattern
that they will make...

1163
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,100
when he throws them on the ground...

1164
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:02,200
he will be able
to diagnose what ails me.

1165
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,700
Go ahead.
You're faded, doc.

1166
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:09,300
<i>Boxcars.!</i>

1167
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:17,000
Mmm.

1168
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,100
A man finally gets tired.

1169
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:26,900
- In the tent.
- What are you gonna do?

1170
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:29,300
- I don't wanna go in the tent.
- In the tent.

1171
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,800
It's a clear night.
It's not going to rain.

1172
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,100
You'll do just as I say.

1173
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:38,400
What a life.
A man can't live as he pleases.

1174
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:41,000
Can't even die as he pleases.

1175
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:01,900
<i>Through the fields of poppies.</i>

1176
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:05,200
<i>Like opium.</i>

1177
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,400
<i>Opium.</i>

1178
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,300
<i>Makes you feel funny.</i>

1179
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:13,800
Where'd we go?

1180
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,000
Went off to that war.

1181
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,200
Water.

1182
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,300
Lousy war.

1183
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:40,300
Molo?

1184
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:48,100
Dead soldiers...

1185
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:51,400
wearing ballet skirts.

1186
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,500
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

1187
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,700
Meant to write about it.

1188
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,400
I've seen the world change.

1189
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,600
Seen not just the events...

1190
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,100
but the people.

1191
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,800
People change.

1192
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
It's my duty to write it.

1193
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,200
I've... Oh, God.

1194
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,200
Been in it. I've seen it.

1195
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:39,400
I've been in it. I've seen it.

1196
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:42,300
I've watched it.

1197
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,900
Darling?

1198
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,700
<i>Did I hurt you?</i>

1199
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,200
I don't want to hurt you.

1200
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,900
Helen.

1201
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:03,000
- I've been writing.
- I know, Harry.

1202
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,600
For a million years.

1203
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,600
- Can you take dictation?
- No. I never learned.

1204
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:14,700
Oh, that's all right.

1205
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,900
Wouldn't be time anyway.

1206
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,700
Seems that...

1207
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:23,800
if I could get it all into...

1208
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,100
one paragraph...

1209
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:29,400
if I could get it...

1210
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:31,600
just right...

1211
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,200
Hello, Molo,
you white man's burden, you.

1212
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,000
<i>Darling, I've only got the first-aid book.</i>

1213
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:47,000
What's he gonna do,
sprinkle me with monkey dust?

1214
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,300
- Darling...
- A hair from the tail of a leopard?

1215
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:53,400
- The poor, old...
- Darling, please try to listen.

1216
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:56,700
You told me in certain parts of your leg
there isn't any feeling.

1217
01:42:56,900 --> 01:43:00,400
- Wood. Funniest thing...
- It says in the book it's a kind of paralysis.

1218
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:04,500
The blood vessels. One should use
hot compresses to keep the circulation going.

1219
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,200
You tell 'em to use the lion medicine.
It's very potent.

1220
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,600
Don't make fun, even of him.
He only wants to do his best.

1221
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:16,600
And I'm trying to do my best.

1222
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:19,700
I'm trying to do
my best too, darling.

1223
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,300
If you'll only do that, Harry.

1224
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,200

<i>Fever.</i>

- Sure.
- There's a very large swelling on your leg.

I'm going to open it.

01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,300
Do you...

1240
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:08,100
feel something strange?

1241
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,500
Yes, darling.

1242
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:13,700
Death is near us.

1243
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,700
Do you think he could come so close
to you and I wouldn't know it?

1244
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,400
Don't ever believe...

1245
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:23,000
what they tell you about it.

1246
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,300
Not a scythe or a skull.

1247
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:29,500
Just now, it came with a rush.

1248
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:32,800
Not the rush of water...

1249
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,900
but of wind.

1250
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:38,100
And...

1251
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:42,600
And the funniest thing.

1252
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,300
The hyena...

1253
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:48,000
skipped lightly...

1254
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,700
along the edge of it.

1255
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,500
God help us.

1256
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:29,000
Go away.

1257
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,400
It's all right now.

1258
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,400
I don't understand.

1259
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:46,500
Go away.

1260
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:30,500
Oh!

1261
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,200
Harry! It's come!

1262
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:40,800
The plane... it's come.

1263
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,800
Darling, it's here.

1264
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,300
Darling, it's here.

1265
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,400
It's here... the plane.

1266
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,500
It's here.

1267
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:57,800
Darling, look.

1268
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,300
What do you see?

1269
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:05,800
It's Mr.Johnson.
Well, what do you know?

1270
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,400
No, I mean look at the tree.

1271
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,500
The tree!

1272
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,800
<i>Well, I'll be hanged.</i>

1273
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,100
They've gone.

1274
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
They have gone.

1275
01:53:27,305 --> 01:54:27,316
