1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,680
To the rear, march! To the rear, freeze!

3
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,280
Forward! To the right flank, freeze!

4
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
Forward! Platoon, halt.

5
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
At ease.

6
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,120
What was that number in Paris?

7
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,240
All heads up. Right face.

8
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,080
Forward march.

9
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,480
Extend. Hut!

10
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,440
Swing right. Hut!

11
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,120
"Merry Christmas." That's a crock.

12
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,360
Beats those replacement camps.

13
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,800
You said the war would be over
by Christmas.

14
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,960
What do you want, egg in your beer?
Here we are, two hours from Paris.

15
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,720
The spitting image
of Camp Wolters, Texas.

16
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,400
You know, they got a man in the army.
A two-star general.

17
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,720
But all he does is fly around
in a private plane looking for ugly places.

18
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,720
Flat, sandy places. No trees, no water.

19
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,120
Then he checks up on the climate.

20
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,800
If it's too hot in summer for human life
and too cold in winter...

21
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,880
and if it has more rain, fog, wind,
and snow...

22
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,560
than any other spot he can find,
then he plants the American flag...

23
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,280
and proclaims it a US Army camp.

24
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,120
Did they drill that way at Camp Wolters?

25
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,560
Bombshell.

26
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,400
Box steps.

27
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,320
To the rear, freeze! Forward!

28
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,600
To the right flank, freeze!

29
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,760
Forward! Platoon, halt!

30
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,640
At ease!

31
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
Forty-two sixty what?

32
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
- Forty-two sixty-ten.
- Seventy!

33
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,560
Platoon, attention. Right face.

34
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,960
Forward march!

35
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,080
The Screaming Eagle.

36
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,120
They know who you are
when you wear that on your sleeve.

37
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,680
It wasn't bad enough
being in Infantry Replacement.

38
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,960
We have to volunteer
for the 101st Airborne.

39
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,040
You go in gliders instead of trucks.
That's the only difference.

40
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,640
There must be a difference
or they wouldn't give you extra pay.

41
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,240
Hooper, I don't think
I'll take in that movie tonight.

42
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,760
I'll be kind of busy getting acquainted
and sewing on shoulder patches.

43
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,160
Why did they have to put us
in different companies?

44
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,840
- Lf we ask them, they might do something.
- No. There's another major general.

45
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,320
His job is to find out who your buddy is
and then to split you up.

46
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,440
- Don't forget, I'm in K Company.
- I won't.

47
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,440
And don't you forget, I'm in I Company.
Third platoon, second squad.

48
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,960
So long, Hooper.

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Thanks.

50
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,080
Remember that lieutenant in Normandy...

51
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,920
who said he'd court-martial the first man
who tossed his gas mask away?

52
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,360
We ripped out the masks...

53
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,320
and used the carriers
for toting that cognac we liberated.

54
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,160
"Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday."

55
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,000
- Hiya. How did you make out?
- The lights were pretty bad...

56
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,360
but I was really flipping them in there.
Six completed passes.

57
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,040
- I'll be hot in that game tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? You ain't going to Paris?

58
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
Him? He'd rather play football than eat.

59
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,440
With the chow we've been getting,
I don't blame him. But Paris...

60
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,080
It's gonna be lonesome here.
The whole platoon's going.

61
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,720
All except the replacements.

62
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,280
- Sgt. Wolowicz?
- Yeah?

63
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,680
My name is Layton.
I've been assigned to your squad.

64
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,960
Make yourself at home,
but on some other sack.

65
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,040
- That one's mine.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

66
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,800
Li'I Abner in Paris.
Boy, that's gonna be something.

67
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,840
Daisy Mae won't know you
when you get back to Dogpatch.

68
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,800
That's for dang sure.

69
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,000
Abner, will you please stop saying that?

70
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,200
Fellows, look what I found.

71
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,480
- Holley.
- The Purple Heart kid.

72
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
At ease, men.

73
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,800
I heard the war was on its last legs,
so I thought I'd come back.

74
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,680
Rough in the ETO.
A little scratch on his leg...

75
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,280
and a month later he comes back in time
for a three-day pass to Paris.

76
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,320
It was misery in that hospital, Kipp.

77
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,320
Passes every night, champagne, I'amour.

78
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,880
And me brooding all the time
about my dear buddies back there...

79
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,840
defending the Republic.

80
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,200
Will you look at that girl bait.

81
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,240
I'm getting me a mess of that fruit salad
just as soon as we hit Paris.

82
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
You can have the sack next to me.
Nobody's got it, have they?

83
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,560
No, I was just sitting here.

84
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,960
- That's a nice-looking little girl.
- It's a boy.

85
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,680
What's it like, Holley?

86
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,160
- Paris?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,920
I spent my spare time in the art galleries.

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,280
But I happened to hear about a place
that might interest you. Place Pigalle.

89
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,920
Pig Alley.

90
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,280
Be sure to bring your dog tags,
because one night in Pig Alley...

91
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,560
Excuse me.

92
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,960
Because you're going to think
you're the Caliph of Baghdad.

93
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,200
You guys talk about Piccadilly Circus.

94
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,640
Compared to Pig Alley,
it's like the quiet room in a limey YMCA.

95
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,240
How about you and me
boarding up in Paris?

96
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,360
What's the matter,
did Pop Stazak disown you?

97
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,880
Pop can't go on account of his arthritis.

98
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,520
I love you, Roderigues. I love all of you.

99
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,280
But I'm getting me a private room
and private bath in Paris...

100
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,080
if I have to get it at the point of a gun.

101
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,240
The big brain wants to get away
from us common people.

102
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,160
He hasn't got anybody around here
to chat with about the Einstein Theory.

103
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,400
What do you mean? He's got me.

104
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,640
There ain't nothing
we like to talk about better.

105
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,680
What happened to Lt. Belwick?
He was just your speed, Joe College.

106
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,320
He got hit in Holland.

107
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,200
It's all right, kid. Go right ahead.
Just brush me off when you're through.

108
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,840
- Holley, my boy, bonjour.
- Hiya. What are you busting out about?

109
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,520
It's nothing at all, son.
It's hardly worth mentioning.

110
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,480
They're just making me a civilian,
that's all.

111
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,560
- They what?
- I wish I had arthritis.

112
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,960
It ain't the arthritis.

113
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,040
They got a report from the Red Cross...

114
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,200
that my wife is too sick
to take care of the kids.

115
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,640
So I let them talk me into accepting
a dependency discharge.

116
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,400
Glad you made it, Pop.

117
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,400
Who's gonna adopt Roderigues?
He'd be lost without his Popsy Wopsy.

118
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,640
One of these days
you're going to get a GI bootsie wootsie...

119
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,640
right square in those GI teeth.

120
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,320
Such language. You should have
learned him better manners, Pop.

121
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,760
- Knock it off, will you?
- When do you leave?

122
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,760
Any day now. I have to sweat out
a letter of confirmation...

123
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,320
from our higher headquarters.
You'll be in Paris.

124
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,920
No, I decided to catch that football game.

125
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's swell. It'll be rugged
waiting around here all alone.

126
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,320
See you in the morning, Johnny.
You gonna miss me, Abner?

127
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,120
That's for dang sure.

128
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm glad to see you guys
finally got the junk off my cot.

129
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,560
How about dousing that light?

130
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,840
Paris trucks are leaving early.

131
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,600
Okay, douse it.

132
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,440
All right, roll out of them sacks.

133
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,280
Hit it.
Leave your cots and grab your socks.

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,160
Let's go, men. You're slow.
Get them up, Wolowicz.

135
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,480
- I ain't going to Paris.
- Nobody's going to Paris.

136
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,600
- We're moving up. On trucks.
- Moving up? Where to?

137
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,880
Beats me. The Krauts
made a breakthrough someplace.

138
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,760
They tell me it's gonna be cold...

139
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,480
so wear your long johns and two pairs
of pants. Three, if you can get them on.

140
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,080
But they told us yesterday
we'd be off the line for good.

141
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,080
They didn't get the order
till after midnight.

142
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,960
There's trucks this time instead of gliders.
That's a good sign, anyway.

143
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
This is strictly for the birds, brother.

144
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,040
Beats anything
ever I stuck my finger in before.

145
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,520
"General, I need a crack division
to plug up that gap."

146
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
"A crack division, General?
I'd be honored if you'd use the 101st."

147
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,880
"Awfully nice of you, old boy.
Thanks a lot."

148
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,360
"Not at all, General."

149
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,720
Maybe the adjutant
can put in a phone call.

150
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,560
Yeah. It's only a technicality.

151
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,280
- I forgot to tell you, men...
- Shut up!

152
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,200
It's a secret move,
so rip off your shoulder patches.

153
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,760
Sarge, you got any of them
rubber overshoes, them galoshes?

154
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,800
Can't fit you, Abner. Your feet's too small.

155
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,400
Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday.

156
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,200
Yeah, if you can find some cognac.

157
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,720
- No dice?
- I gotta wait for the letter. Regulations.

158
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
It's gonna be a cold trip.
Maybe you can ride in the driver's cab.

159
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,680
Wind it up.
Let's get this show on the road.

160
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,760
- That the new platoon leader?
- Yeah, fresh off the boat.

161
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,120
I understand your problems, men.

162
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,920
- I used to be an enlisted man myself.
- For six months, maybe.

163
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,040
And 17 weeks at OCS,
and he's an officer and gentleman...

164
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,720
- by special act of Congress.
- Sound off!

165
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,440
Shut up!

166
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,560
- What did he say? Where are we?
- Are you kidding?

167
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,200
Do you speak French, sir?

168
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Yes. Immediately.

169
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,160
- Cigarette?
- Thank you very much.

170
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,600
I don't smoke, but thanks anyway.
Thanks a lot.

171
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,040
What time is it, Hansan?

172
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,560
- 11:30.
- What?

173
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,640
It can't be that late. We left at 2:00.

174
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,440
11:30 a.m. Central Standard Time.

175
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,640
- Near lunchtime in Springfield.
- You never changed your watch?

176
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,920
What's the use of changing your watch?

177
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,440
What's the use? You're here,
you're not in Springfield, Illinois.

178
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,880
I hear you.

179
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,760
This is what I like about the infantry.
You always know just what's going on.

180
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,840
How do you like this guy?
He don't like the infantry.

181
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,440
- Must be off his nut.
- He never had it so good.

182
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,640
He found a home in the Army.

183
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,800
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?

184
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,320
Chocolate, please.

185
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,920
Isn't she cute?

186
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,200
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?

187
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,320
Here.

188
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,720
Get a load of mama!

189
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,480
I'd like to keep her in chocolate
for about a week.

190
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
What's she saying, Jarvess?

191
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,600
She wants to know
if we'd like to come inside and warm up.

192
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,880
- Yes. Warm up, please.
- Oh, brother!

193
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,200
- I like these secret moves.
- We sure slipped one over on the Krauts.

194
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,440
How do they find out these things?
Who tells them?

195
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,640
- I keep them posted. Short wave.
- Somebody does.

196
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,720
They only occupied France for four years.

197
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,160
Naturally they left a few spies
when they pulled out.

198
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,120
That's an idea.
Why don't us Gls hire some spies...

199
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,720
so we'll know what's going on
once in a while?

200
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,560
Get them inside! Come on!

201
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
On the double!

202
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,960
Kinnie, how about getting
these men in out of the hot sun?

203
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,080
Wolowicz, Garby,
in there with the second platoon.

204
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,600
This corner house.

205
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,560
I forgot to tell you.
Put those shoulder patches back on.

206
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,920
- Pop, I hear we're bedding down here.
- Overnight?

207
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,440
Yeah. Looks like a good house, too.
Smoke coming out of the chimney.

208
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
For once, we get a break.

209
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Bastogne. I won't be forgetting
this place in a hurry.

210
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,000
I wouldn't mind holing up here
till Christmas.

211
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,920
I hear tell we might.
All the rumors is good ones.

212
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,440
This is the United States Armed Forces
Radio Service broadcasting from London.

213
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,880
Let's see if we can get some news.

214
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,240
- What's he selling?
- Wait till he slows down.

215
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,880
Ask her. I'll guarantee you
she can sprechen sie Deutsch.

216
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,520
Let's live a little, Jarvess.

217
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,840
- Come on, mama, get yourself in gear.
- No, not mama.

218
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,760
These two little children,
they live with me, but...

219
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,800
Slowly, please.

220
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,920
She said she's not the mother
of the two little girls.

221
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,120
They're from a town near here.
Bombed out, both parents killed.

222
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
They all got a sob story.

223
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,280
- Let's cut a rug, Denise. Danser?
- No, we've cut enough.

224
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,640
You gotta keep paying these taxi dancers.
Fork over another chocolate bar.

225
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,880
What you say, please?

226
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,160
I said do you think
the rain'll hurt the rhubarb?

227
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,520
What he say?

228
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,600
Is there any coffee left?

229
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,280
- Yes, plenty of coffee. Immediately.
- Thank you.

230
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,320
Anything you want.
Sure, as long as you pay for it.

231
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,760
They're all alike here.

232
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,360
Yes, they're all alike, Kipp.
Scared, hungry, lonely.

233
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,200
Come on, stop beating your gums.
Let a guy get some sleep.

234
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,320
Yeah, it's about that time.

235
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,400
We sure come a far piece today.

236
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,160
- You okay, Kipp?
- Okay.

237
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,960
Poor tired soldiers.

238
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,760
- You want?
- Thank you.

239
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,400
I go now?

240
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
I guess so. I'm all beat-up.

241
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,800
It never fails.
Every time you meet a pretty babe...

242
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,600
you're either out on your feet
or you get the order to move.

243
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,320
- What you say, please?
- Nothing.

244
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,600
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

245
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,720
Good night.

246
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,400
- Where are you going?
- Guard.

247
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,000
What did she say?

248
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,960
She said she's gonna hide the chocolate
from the kids till Christmas.

249
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,080
I wish I knew for sure
we'd be here tomorrow.

250
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
- You'll be here.
- Are you sure?

251
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,560
All we do is lie around till the fog lifts...

252
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,960
so the air corps can come out
and win the war for us.

253
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,960
In that case, I guess I'll take a chance.

254
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,760
This may go down in history
as the greatest gamble of the war.

255
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,160
- Good night, Denise.
- Good night, soldier.

256
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
Wolowicz, are you absolutely sure?

257
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
Yeah, the C.O. Told us himself.

258
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,680
Wake me up early, will you?

259
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,160
Maybe.

260
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,600
I ought to report this
to the Inspector General.

261
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,160
There's supposed to be 18 inches
between bunks.

262
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,560
This is dangerous, spreads germs.

263
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,920
There's some hot coffee on the stove.

264
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,520
I can use it.

265
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,720
Don't worry about that plane.
It's one of ours, I think.

266
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,600
Halt. Password.

267
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
- Hamburgers.
- Onions.

268
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,800
I thought the 101st
was the only division here.

269
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,120
They will be
as soon as the rest of us can get out.

270
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,240
- What's up?
- We were a little over to the east.

271
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,640
Been there for weeks without firing a shot.
Then they started coming.

272
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,400
Tanks, planes. Everything
you ever heard of and then some.

273
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,840
A Jerry plane turned on a loudspeaker
in English.

274
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,120
It said Hitler will give Paris
to the Germans for a Christmas present.

275
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,000
But they told us
it was just a weak little counterattack.

276
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,760
They'll probably tell you
that this is a strategic withdrawal.

277
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,600
- Good morning, soldier.
- Bonjour.

278
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,640
I'll be back in a minute.

279
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,040
Keep an eye on... What's going on?

280
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,560
Me and Gen. McAuliffe decided to move
I Company up on the line.

281
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,760
- That is, if you agree.
- I should have known better.

282
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,280
Maybe she'll give you a refund
on those chocolate bars.

283
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,880
How much time have I got?
Ten minutes? Five minutes?

284
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,080
Anything you gotta do,
you better do in 30 seconds.

285
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,960
Saddle up. Let's go, Holley.

286
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,840
Drop your packs and rolls.

287
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,440
Third platoon, on your feet.
We've got that patch of woods to clear.

288
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,400
Third platoon,
any time there's a dirty detail.

289
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,440
Let's not be having
any talk like that, soldier.

290
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,040
Let's go.
Keep sight of the man on each side of you.

291
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,960
Watch out for snipers.

292
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,960
Snipers, the man says.

293
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Second squad, over here. Dig in.

294
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,960
You're in charge till I get back.
I'm going to see the Lieutenant.

295
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,440
- Don't go volunteer for any patrols.
- Who do I dig with, Sergeant?

296
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,960
That's right, we've got an odd man.
You can triple up with me and Hansan.

297
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,680
- Thanks. You want me to go with you?
- No, you stay and get the hole started.

298
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,720
Come on, Hansan, let's go.

299
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,000
Take ten, Jarvess.
Time for me to spare you.

300
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,600
Get out of here.

301
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
Let's not try to reach China this time.

303
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,240
There's no sense digging
if you don't go deep.

304
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,880
Last time we dug one together...

305
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,320
you went so deep that when I climbed out
I got the bends.

306
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,040
- How does it look?
- Great.

307
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,520
Only one thing wrong. We're moving.

308
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,280
- What?
- You heard me. It ain't my idea.

309
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,160
Saddle up, everybody, let's go.

310
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,920
Oh, no!

311
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,960
Just once I'd like to dig a foxhole...

312
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,480
and find out that's the one I'm sleeping in.

313
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,920
Will you stop yapping?

314
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,600
First and third squads
gotta run patrols all night.

315
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,880
- All we gotta do is...
- Standiferd, take over.

316
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,280
- I'm pulling the first shift on the roadblock.
- Okay.

317
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,720
You better take a blanket with you.
This fog...

318
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,240
really gets to you.

319
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,840
I feel kind of woozy myself.

320
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,120
Let's go, Hansan.

321
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,680
Just get it started. We'll finish it up.

322
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,040
When you were in that camp
in New York...

323
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,360
- did you ever phone your wife?
- Sure.

324
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,840
- What did it cost?
- A nickel. What did you think?

325
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,560
That's right. She came there to see you.

326
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,600
Did you phone your kids long distance?

327
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah, just before we shipped out.

328
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,200
- Why?
- What did that cost?

329
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,280
$2 for three minutes.

330
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,680
- Why, Johnny?
- I was thinking...

331
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,880
it's probably about as far from New York
to Wichita, where your kids were...

332
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,280
as it is from Wichita to Los Angeles,
where my folks are.

333
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,640
And when you get back home...

334
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,360
what would that be, about 200 francs?

335
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,680
I'll send you a bill, Johnny.

336
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,480
Tell them that I...

337
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,400
Well, you'll think of something.

338
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,520
And if it runs over three minutes, it's okay.

339
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,360
Put out that fire. It's getting dark, Holley.

340
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,000
Put on that steel pot
and get over to the roadblock.

341
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,240
Three on a shift at night:
You, Kipp, and the new man.

342
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,040
They said to look out
for Krauts wearing GI uniforms.

343
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,480
What about the password?

344
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,440
That might be nice to know,
in case somebody thinks we're Krauts.

345
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,920
- Bug-jitter.
- Thanks.

346
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,080
Here, don't get any dirt in these eggs.

347
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,600
Okay, you get half of them.

348
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,560
- How do you feel, Standiferd?
- Terrible.

349
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,480
It's settling down in my chest.
I'm almost sure I have a fever.

350
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,800
I had a fever in Holland, but the medics
wouldn't let me off the line.

351
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,600
You have to have 102. That's a regulation.

352
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,200
Listen to that voice. I can hardly talk.

353
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,800
Yeah, it sounds good.

354
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,280
Halt! Password!

355
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,840
- Bug.
- Jitter.

356
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,600
- What is this, Charlie Company?
- No, sir, ltem.

357
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,720
I Company?
This must be the road to Neufchateau.

358
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,280
- I think it is.
- You want to be sure of things, soldier.

359
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,080
- Is there a bridge up ahead?
- Yes, about half a mile out.

360
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,760
Good. Let's go.

361
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,000
Smart cookie. Wearing his bars on patrol.

362
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,640
Must be a new replacement.

363
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,200
Don't let that happen again.
Speak English.

364
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,480
Yes, sir.

365
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,160
Oh, no!

366
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,200
Look, Pop, it's snowing!

367
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,960
I never saw snow up close before.
It's beautiful.

368
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,440
You didn't, by any chance hear...

369
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,440
that it's kind of cold
and a little on the wet side, did you?

370
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,640
Man, it's really coming down.

371
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,600
Well, close the window, Johnny,
and fix that hole in the roof.

372
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,440
You should know better
than to take off your boots in a foxhole.

373
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,880
You might want to start running fast.

374
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,320
- I can't sleep with wet boots on.
- Then wear your galoshes until they dry.

375
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,360
I ain't got no galoshes.

376
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,320
- Where did you get those branches?
- Where do you generally get branches?

377
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,360
- I didn't know if the woods were cleared.
- Yeah, sure. K Company's in there.

378
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,080
- K Company?
- Yeah.

379
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,480
I got a buddy in K Company.

380
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,320
- Is this K Company?
- Yeah.

381
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,920
- Where will I find Hooper?
- Hooper? Never heard of him.

382
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,120
Bill Hooper. I know he's in K Company.

383
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,600
He's not in my platoon.
That first hole is the company C.P.

384
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,560
- They'll know where he is.
- Thanks.

385
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,080
What platoon is Hooper in,
William J. Hooper?

386
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,080
Nobody by that name in K Company.

387
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,840
Yes, there is. He came in with
the new replacements just the other day.

388
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,400
That was his name? Hey, Sergeant.

389
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,720
What's up?

390
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,520
That kid they got at last night,
name is Hooper. William J. Hooper.

391
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,120
Now I can finish
making out my morning report. Thanks.

392
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,120
Direct hit on his foxhole. A mortar.
You don't hear them coming.

393
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,880
You don't know what hit you.

394
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,800
You didn't even know his name.

395
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,480
We didn't even find his dog tags.

396
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,200
Chatsburg News.

397
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,320
Li'I Abner gets one: The Dogpatch Gazette.

398
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,800
I'll take it.

399
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,240
- Sorry, Pop.
- It'll probably come up in the next batch.

400
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,960
You act as if I want a discharge.

401
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,360
Man, I like it here.

402
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,640
Stick around, Kinnie. We're going
to choose up sides for a snowball fight.

403
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,640
Hand these letters out
with the rations, Hansan.

404
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,320
They're all dinner, for once without coffee.

405
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,760
Dinner rations, with that vitamin-packed
lemonade powder:

406
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,760
"Simply add water
and serve ice-cold. Delicious."

407
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,960
- About that patrol, Kinnie...
- I can't let you go on it, Wolowicz.

408
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,600
I want to be sure you'll be around to take
over the platoon if I have to go back.

409
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,320
My feet froze up pretty bad last night.

410
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,240
I want three volunteers
to go out on a patrol.

411
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,480
You, you, and you.
You're in charge, Holley.

412
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,400
Why am I always volunteering for patrol?

413
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,360
- I'm just a cowboy.
- All right, this is the deal, Holley.

414
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,760
G-2 says the Krauts
dropped some paratroops last night.

415
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,520
And they might be hiding in that patch
of woods on the other side of that farm.

416
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,840
G-2. Wonderful how
they always know what's cooking.

417
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,320
Well, I can tell you something
they do know.

418
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,200
Last night, some Krauts in GI uniforms
infiltrated right through this area.

419
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,400
They blew up a bridge
on the road to Neufchateau.

420
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,720
Was one of them wearing lieutenant bars?

421
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,720
- How did you know?
- We get all the latest rumors.

422
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,360
Rumor, my eye.
They captured one of them.

423
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,600
Spoke English perfect. Knew our
password, plan of deployment, everything.

424
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,000
Kinnie, how about showing me
the way to the aid station?

425
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,440
I'm freezing.

426
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,000
- Feeling any better?
- Worse. Much worse.

427
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,240
Never felt so sick in my life.

428
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,920
Maybe I've even got pneumonia.

429
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,640
He's really bad.

430
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,040
Yeah, he's a cinch to go back
to the field hospital. Maybe even to Paris.

431
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,360
I don't know. That penicillin...
He's liable to be back in a day.

432
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,280
Yeah, a good, clean flesh wound is better.
Then they got to send you back.

433
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,360
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

434
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,920
Guys get sick, guys get wounded,
and nothing ever happens to me.

435
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,640
Nothing except that time
you broke your faux choppers.

436
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,520
It was when you were back. Kipp found
out you can't keep a man on the line...

437
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,520
unless he's got
at least six teeth of his own.

438
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,040
I didn't know about that.

439
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,400
So he broke his GI teeth
with the butt of his rifle.

440
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,080
I ran into a tree trunk in the dark.

441
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,840
He was off the line for two weeks
getting a new set made.

442
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,240
Let's get this patrol on the road.

443
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,440
That's incoming mail.

444
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,880
Holley, I think your eggs are about done.

445
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,880
We've had good deals before,
but this is the best one yet.

446
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,800
This is great. I don't ever wanna go back.

447
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,280
I found a home in the Army.

448
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,920
Of course, you can see snow from LA.
Way off in the mountains.

449
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,720
They got us zeroed in.
I'm getting out of here.

450
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,320
I hope he makes it. They should
never have sent him back on the line.

451
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,520
Some guys just can't take it.

452
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,200
Wolowicz, there's something
I want you to know.

453
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,240
My name is Layton.

454
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,040
- I know it is.
- I just wanted to be sure.

455
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,920
Thanks.

456
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,840
This is what G-2 calls a patch of woods.

457
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,160
A whole division
could be hiding in that forest.

458
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,080
Nice job for a three-man patrol.

459
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,440
Yeah, if we don't get back, that's how
they'll know we ran into some Krauts.

460
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,680
- What's the password?
- Texas.

461
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,640
Keep them covered. They may be German.

462
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,520
- Any line on these woods, Major?
- I didn't hear the countersign.

463
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,120
Leaguer. Texas Leaguer.

464
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,600
Will this road take us
to Third Bat headquarters?

465
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,320
- Straight ahead.
- Get going.

466
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,160
- Just a minute. What is a Texas leaguer?
- How's that?

467
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,520
- I said what's a Texas leaguer?
- It's some kind of baseball term.

468
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,120
- What kind?
- A safe hit just over the infielder's head...

469
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,200
Nobody asked you.
How'd the Dodgers make out?

470
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,600
- Who's your commanding officer?
- He knows how the Dodgers made out.

471
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,960
- Let's see your dog tags.
- What?

472
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,600
We're not taking any chances.

473
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,400
What is this?

474
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,680
What kind of nonsense...

475
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,160
Drop those rifles.

476
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,040
- Who's Betty Grable going with?
- Cesar Romero.

477
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,880
- Quiet. Who's the Dragon Lady?
- She's in Terry and the Pirates.

478
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,560
- What's a hotrod?
- A hopped-up jalopy.

479
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,440
- Joe, what do you know?
- Just got back from a vaudeville show.

480
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,240
- I guess they're okay.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

481
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,600
PFC, Major. Praying For Civilian.
That's why I believe in being careful.

482
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,720
May I suggest, sir,
that you study up on baseball?

483
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,480
I guess I'd better.

484
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,200
By the way, you might tell your buddy
that Cesar Romero is out.

485
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,360
She's married to Harry James.

486
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,600
Let's go.

487
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,040
They really should have sent out
a bigger patrol.

488
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,720
- Lf you want to goof off...
- Who said anything about goofing off?

489
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,960
Nobody.

490
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,320
I'm just saying
the best way is to tell them...

491
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,760
you heard voices talking in German.

492
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,120
Let's say we heard voices talking
in Japanese and let G-2 figure that out.

493
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,640
That paper any good?

494
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,080
Best in the world. Sedalia News.

495
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,880
Keep your gloves off for two minutes and
you'd have Popsicles instead of fingers.

496
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,440
Get a load of this.

497
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,560
"Our Changing Times,
by Mrs. Donald Jarvess...

498
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,920
"pinch-hitting for your favorite columnist
and her favorite husband...

499
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,160
"now on active duty, US Army."

500
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,920
You knew I worked on a newspaper.

501
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,080
Yeah, but a column?
You must be pretty good.

502
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,760
I was too good. I wrote a piece
about the real meaning of the war...

503
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,480
the fight against Fascism, why every
American had to get in there and pitch in.

504
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,480
The logic was magnificent.
You couldn't resist it.

505
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,160
The next thing I knew,
I was in a troop train...

506
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,600
waving bye-bye to my wife.

507
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,960
- Came the dawn?
- Yeah.

508
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,560
Only one thing gets me.
When you work on a newspaper...

509
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,200
I'd get those wire releases...

510
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,440
and know that I was the first person
in town who had the news. All the news.

511
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,920
I'll guarantee you, my wife knows
what's going on in Bastogne.

512
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,200
All I know is
what's happening to the second squad...

513
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,400
in the third platoon of I Company.

514
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,280
Watch this one.

515
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,960
Strike!

516
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,280
Can't hit them if you can't see them.

517
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,880
Now the count's three and two.

518
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,120
Man on first and third.
Two out. This is the one that counts.

519
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,400
Foul ball. Come on, let's have a fast one.

520
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,560
Burn it in, boy. Come on.

521
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,960
A hit right over second base.

522
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,880
There, the center fielder
made a shoestring catch. You're out.

523
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,680
- How about it, ump?
- Sound off, pal. Password?

524
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,760
Don't you get it? Right over second base.

525
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,760
- Texas.
- Leaguer.

526
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,400
- You in charge?
- No, the lieutenant.

527
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,840
Hiya, fellows.

528
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,480
What's the situation, Lieutenant?

529
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,440
Nothing but pine trees in these woods.
We've been through them.

530
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,520
- I guess our mission's accomplished.
- Courtesy of K Company.

531
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,440
You can tell them to stop worrying
about this area.

532
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,200
Them and us both, Lieutenant. Thanks.

533
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,640
- I guess we might as well partie.
- So long.

534
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,640
- So long.
- So long, fellows.

535
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,120
Come on, on the double. They're Krauts.

536
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,160
Come on!

537
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,800
Kraut tanks!

538
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,720
No. Take off, will you?

539
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,960
If they think we're all getting away,
maybe I've got a chance.

540
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,320
- Go on.
- We'll send a patrol back.

541
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,720
- Don't forget the sulfa powder.
- Go on, get in there.

542
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,560
Let's go.

543
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,160
- You're sure they were enemy tanks?
- We saw them, Lieutenant.

544
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,200
Think we've got enough
antitank grenades to do any good?

545
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,840
We ain't got any.

546
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,200
Mind if I make a suggestion, Lieutenant?

547
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,720
What?

548
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,600
Sir, our usual defense against tanks
is to call for artillery...

549
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,680
and then run like a jackrabbit.

550
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,000
We've got orders to hold these positions.

551
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,080
All right, sir, but let's call for artillery
and keep our heads down.

552
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,400
We could send out some bazooka men,
if we had any bazookas.

553
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,640
- Put in a call for artillery.
- Yes, sir.

554
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,440
What a break.
Artillery's got that farmhouse zeroed in.

555
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,720
Concentration 17.

556
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,440
Item three to ltem:

557
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,640
Kraut tanks by burning farmhouse.

558
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,040
Concentration 17.

559
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,960
Roger. Start the fireworks.

560
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,960
That's great. Artillery can't miss.

561
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,080
They've got Roderigues to use
for an aiming stick.

562
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,920
Tell Wolowicz to send out for Roderigues
as soon as this barrage lifts.

563
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,840
With what, a sponge?

564
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,520
I've got to get me a rifle.
Any extra ones, Garby?

565
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,840
No, we haven't had any casualties yet.

566
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,280
There's a rifle waiting for you, Holley.

567
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,960
Your squad sent for the meat wagon
after the last shelling.

568
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
- Who was hit, Doc?
- Wolowicz.

569
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,680
Is he bad?

570
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,240
A shell landed
right on the edge of his foxhole.

571
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,240
His shoulder's like a sieve.

572
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,840
- Where's your steel pot, soldier?
- I lost it, Sergeant.

573
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,120
You can try mine on for size... Sergeant.

574
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,280
You're in charge now.

575
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,680
Leadership. That's what I got.

576
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,160
Where's Roderigues?

577
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,560
He'll be along, Pop.

578
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,000
Should have worn my shoulder pads.

579
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,200
In a couple of months you'll be flipping
those forward passes as good as ever.

580
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,760
Yeah, left-handed.

581
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,240
He's a good man, Holley...

582
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,120
but still a little jumpy.

583
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,560
He can move in with me.

584
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,480
You could do worse.

585
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,080
He sleeps warm and quiet.

586
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,760
His name's Layton. Jim Layton.

587
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,600
- So long, Wolowicz.
- Take it easy.

588
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,400
Say hello to Standiferd.

589
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,280
- Hansan, you can move in with Pop.
- What about Roderigues?

590
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,520
Is that incoming mail?

591
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,520
No, it's outgoing.
There'll be plenty more of it.

592
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,960
- What time is it, Hansan?
- 10:30. No, it must be 11:30 here.

593
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,920
Where's Roderigues?

594
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,400
Let's take a walk, Pop.

595
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,120
How much longer
are they going to leave him out there?

596
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,040
Let's partie.
We can carry him back in this blanket.

597
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,481
I want three volunteers.

598
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:33,561
It's a long walk, Pop.

599
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,521
- I need a fourth for bridge.
- I'll be the dummy.

600
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:44,041
You don't have to, Layton.

601
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:46,921
Maybe you'll find some more eggs.

602
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:53,721
What are you looking for, Kipp,
your discharge?

603
00:59:53,801 --> 00:59:55,841
- I lost my teeth.
- You lost them?

604
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:58,881
They were searching me on
a roadblock, so I put them in my pocket.

605
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:01,201
- And they jumped out?
- Dropped out.

606
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:04,921
I hope it's nice and warm
back where you're going.

607
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:08,561
I can't chew on K rations with my gums.

608
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:52,841
No! Keep your eye open.

609
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:42,601
He used to see snow
way off in the mountains.

610
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:47,921
They say it's just like going to sleep.

611
01:01:59,401 --> 01:02:01,201
He was a religious kid.

612
01:02:04,001 --> 01:02:05,801
When anyone got hit...

613
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:09,801
he used to say it was God's will.

614
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:55,281
- What's the Bulge?
- Search me.

615
01:02:56,361 --> 01:03:00,041
"Hitler's mighty counteroffensive swept on
yesterday under a news eclipse...

616
01:03:00,121 --> 01:03:04,481
"from which filtered the fact that German
armor had plunged 20 miles into Belgium."

617
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:06,241
We're in Belgium, aren't we?

618
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:08,801
Thought it was Luxembourg.
Let's see that.

619
01:03:09,961 --> 01:03:13,441
"War Department authorities report
that morale is high all along the front.

620
01:03:13,481 --> 01:03:16,281
"Battle-hardened doughboys
fresh from epic-making triumphs..."

621
01:03:16,361 --> 01:03:17,961
Skip the commercial, Jarvess.

622
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:21,121
"Air activity was halted by
thick, swirling fog.

623
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:28,361
"At Bastogne, the 101st Airborne..."

624
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:29,881
Hey, that's us.

625
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:35,041
Then you'll be proud to know
that you are making a heroic stand...

626
01:03:35,081 --> 01:03:38,681
"hurling back the best
that Von Rundstedt can throw at you."

627
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:42,841
- Who's Von Rundstedt?
- A Kraut general. The best they've got.

628
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:45,121
Is the 101st the only division up here?

629
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:47,641
It doesn't say.
We'll have to wait for the next edition.

630
01:03:47,721 --> 01:03:50,881
- Where's Pop Stazak?
- Him and Hansan are on a roadblock.

631
01:03:50,921 --> 01:03:53,601
Well, this might be it. It looks official.

632
01:03:54,321 --> 01:03:55,801
Chatsburg News.

633
01:04:03,721 --> 01:04:05,641
And The Dogpatch Gazette.

634
01:04:07,521 --> 01:04:11,241
Get back to the aid station, Kinnie,
before those feet of yours get any worse.

635
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:14,241
They won't take frozen feet
unless they start to change color.

636
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:18,481
No combat fatigue, no fever cases.
You have to be bleeding from a wound.

637
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:21,121
All they got at the aid station
is aspirin and iodine.

638
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:23,841
- What about the field hospital?
- Captured.

639
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:28,441
Medics, casualties, equipment, the works.

640
01:04:28,521 --> 01:04:31,321
It must have been after the meat wagon
got there with Wolowicz.

641
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:35,241
I guess Standiferd was there, too.
Some of the walking wounded were killed.

642
01:04:35,321 --> 01:04:38,441
They say the fight they put up
was one for the book.

643
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:58,761
Layton, you're learning too fast.
How about spelling me for a bit?

644
01:05:00,121 --> 01:05:02,921
The dreams are getting better all the time.

645
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:05,641
I was back home in Baltimore...

646
01:05:06,441 --> 01:05:09,841
Ioading up on hard-shell crabs and beer.

647
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:12,961
That dream's against regulation, soldier.

648
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:16,161
You know what our boys overseas
always dream about.

649
01:05:16,481 --> 01:05:19,201
- Mom's blueberry pie.
- Why, certainly!

650
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:22,881
That's what we're fighting for.
Boy, when I get home...

651
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:26,601
just give me a hot dog
and a slice of that pie.

652
01:05:26,961 --> 01:05:29,561
Am I gonna kick if I don't get my job back?

653
01:05:29,641 --> 01:05:32,641
No sirree. All I want is a...

654
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:38,561
So long, Holley.

655
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:40,841
So long, Pop.

656
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:43,841
- Au revoir.
- I found them!

657
01:05:43,881 --> 01:05:46,761
I found them in another pocket!

658
01:05:47,161 --> 01:05:50,841
You're just in time to work Pop's shift.
Go up and get Hansan.

659
01:05:51,561 --> 01:05:55,361
- Where you going?
- Special Orders, Number 1437:

660
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:58,561
"Private Ernest J. Stazak
will proceed to Paris...

661
01:05:58,641 --> 01:06:01,721
"where transportation to the US
will be arranged."

662
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,641
- Relax, chum. You ain't going no place.
- I ain't?

663
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:07,081
Here, read it yourself.

664
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:09,281
I don't care what it says.

665
01:06:09,321 --> 01:06:12,441
Nobody's leaving Bastogne,
and nobody's coming in...

666
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:16,921
except maybe some Krauts riding tanks.
We're surrounded.

667
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:18,961
Surrounded?

668
01:06:22,201 --> 01:06:24,001
If this is one of your crummy jokes...

669
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:26,801
I'll knock those GI teeth
right down your throat.

670
01:06:33,401 --> 01:06:35,321
Take it easy, Pop.

671
01:06:35,401 --> 01:06:39,281
He wouldn't have those teeth back
in his mouth if there was any way out.

672
01:07:00,601 --> 01:07:02,161
Tough break, Pop.

673
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:07,681
You know,
I can get them in a lot of trouble for this.

674
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:12,121
It's against the rules of war
to shoot at civilians.

675
01:07:16,521 --> 01:07:18,041
I'm sorry, Kipp.

676
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:48,001
Them poor devils
in the footslogging infantry...

677
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:51,041
nothing but walk, walk, walk.

678
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:53,041
The airborne, that's the life.

679
01:07:53,121 --> 01:07:57,121
It's great up here in these gliders,
drifting along over the clouds.

680
01:08:22,921 --> 01:08:25,641
They're liable to have you up
in juvenile court for smoking.

681
01:08:25,721 --> 01:08:27,841
This your first time
away from home, Layton?

682
01:08:27,881 --> 01:08:31,001
Basic training was.
That wasn't quite the same.

683
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:34,401
My folks stayed for a while
at a town near camp.

684
01:08:34,481 --> 01:08:38,441
Did Mama rub your little footsies
after those nasty 20-mile hikes?

685
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:42,841
She made me brush my teeth
twice a day...

686
01:08:43,321 --> 01:08:46,001
so I wouldn't have to
have them all pulled out.

687
01:08:54,441 --> 01:08:56,161
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

688
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,801
I thought it was a shadow.
It's just some burnt-out powder.

689
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:02,801
You'll die of old age
before you see a shadow around here.

690
01:09:02,881 --> 01:09:04,881
This fog ain't never gonna lift.

691
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:08,361
Did the planes have to wait?
Haven't they ever heard of flying blind?

692
01:09:08,401 --> 01:09:10,641
Nobody cares. They just don't care.

693
01:09:10,721 --> 01:09:12,361
I don't believe that, Kipp.

694
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:15,161
Reverend Layton
will now lead us in prayer.

695
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,321
Might not be a bad idea.

696
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:23,521
The C.O. Says you're to dig in
at that railroad embankment.

697
01:09:23,561 --> 01:09:25,841
The rest of the company's
moving back 500 yards.

698
01:09:25,921 --> 01:09:27,001
Right.

699
01:09:29,881 --> 01:09:34,041
Third platoon,
whenever there's a dirty detail.

700
01:09:36,121 --> 01:09:38,521
Let's go, men. On your feet.

701
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:56,281
Check your rifles. See if they're froze up.

702
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:58,921
Listen to Holley,
making a noise like a sergeant.

703
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:02,961
He's really GI now since he took over
the squad. Right on the ball.

704
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:05,801
Yeah. Strictly chicken, that's me.

705
01:10:06,401 --> 01:10:08,521
Let's be chicken those bolts.

706
01:10:14,761 --> 01:10:16,321
Check your rifles.

707
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:48,361
Why can't they pass down
some information?

708
01:10:49,081 --> 01:10:52,121
If a man gets hit, he must at least know
what country he's dying in.

709
01:10:52,201 --> 01:10:54,761
Now, that's for sure. That's for dang sure.

710
01:10:54,841 --> 01:10:56,441
I've asked you 800 times...

711
01:10:56,521 --> 01:10:59,841
I won't say that no more, Jarvess.
That's for sure.

712
01:12:09,401 --> 01:12:10,881
Can't see them.

713
01:14:36,361 --> 01:14:38,081
I'm with you, Holley.

714
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:41,081
Come on.

715
01:15:04,561 --> 01:15:08,001
Second squad! You, too, Mac! Follow me!

716
01:15:11,521 --> 01:15:12,921
Let's go, Abner!

717
01:15:24,681 --> 01:15:26,761
Mama.

718
01:15:43,521 --> 01:15:45,201
Wait till it clears.

719
01:16:46,121 --> 01:16:47,641
Hold your fire.

720
01:17:07,281 --> 01:17:10,001
Tell them to come out with their hands up.

721
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:44,361
Layton, you and Joe
check them for maps and papers.

722
01:17:46,081 --> 01:17:47,681
See if any of them are still kicking.

723
01:18:06,441 --> 01:18:09,321
Get the prisoners and wounded
back to Bastogne, Sergeant.

724
01:18:09,361 --> 01:18:11,481
See if we've got enough men left, Holley.

725
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:14,121
I'm going to put this man in
for a Silver Star.

726
01:18:35,721 --> 01:18:39,681
You know, a guy ought to be able to get
$100 for this back in Paris.

727
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:49,121
I thought Holley was running away.
That's why I ran after him.

728
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:50,881
How do you know
what Holley was thinking?

729
01:18:50,921 --> 01:18:53,321
How do you know if he was thinking at all?

730
01:18:53,401 --> 01:18:54,521
Things just happen.

731
01:18:54,601 --> 01:18:57,721
Afterwards you try to figure out
why you acted the way you did.

732
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:00,761
I know why I ran. I was scared to death.

733
01:19:00,921 --> 01:19:04,481
You just joined the biggest club
in the Army. Everybody belongs.

734
01:19:04,521 --> 01:19:08,801
Just drop me off at the psycho ward.
Why did I have to get up and start firing?

735
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:10,481
A good thing somebody did.

736
01:19:10,561 --> 01:19:13,561
Yeah. It didn't have to be me. A volunteer.

737
01:19:13,801 --> 01:19:16,641
It happened so fast,
you had no time to look at your watch.

738
01:19:16,681 --> 01:19:19,401
Yeah, sure forgot what time it was
in Springfield.

739
01:19:19,481 --> 01:19:22,601
- Hansan, I hate to ask you, but...
- You can have it.

740
01:19:29,601 --> 01:19:31,361
Let's get out of here, chum.

741
01:19:48,841 --> 01:19:50,241
Thanks, Pop.

742
01:19:51,801 --> 01:19:53,361
I'll drop back later.

743
01:19:53,441 --> 01:19:55,481
Just don't get carried back.

744
01:20:03,561 --> 01:20:06,641
Say, miss, how about giving him a shot?

745
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:11,521
Morphine. Him.

746
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,081
No more morphine?

747
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:20,641
That's great.

748
01:20:52,401 --> 01:20:55,481
She pours him one more,
I'm gonna get myself shot.

749
01:21:11,001 --> 01:21:12,641
They're way too big.

750
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:16,561
I wished we'd found them yesterday.

751
01:21:19,281 --> 01:21:20,801
Let's go, men. Chow!

752
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:23,561
- What?
- You heard me. Hot chow!

753
01:21:29,241 --> 01:21:32,521
I've been pulling KP ever since.
We was bombed out twice.

754
01:21:32,561 --> 01:21:34,761
I'm telling you,
I never saw so much incoming mail.

755
01:21:34,841 --> 01:21:37,161
Yeah, things are getting rough all over.

756
01:21:39,281 --> 01:21:41,041
I wanted to go back on the line.

757
01:21:41,121 --> 01:21:43,201
But they're short-handed
in the kitchen, see.

758
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:45,561
A couple more KPs got hit this morning.

759
01:21:46,121 --> 01:21:48,561
I wouldn't mind a little action
for a change.

760
01:21:50,001 --> 01:21:51,521
How about you and me switching?

761
01:21:51,561 --> 01:21:55,001
Oh, no. They'd never let me go.
I've been learning how to cook.

762
01:21:56,201 --> 01:21:59,361
- Bettis, anything left?
- No.

763
01:21:59,841 --> 01:22:01,921
But it's clean. It's only leftovers.

764
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:05,241
I don't even see those things.

765
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,561
I wanna see them.
I wanna remember them.

766
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:18,881
We'll start back in about an hour.
Better stick around this area.

767
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:21,161
Where's the kid?

768
01:22:21,401 --> 01:22:24,921
Who, Layton? He's in the barn, I guess,
putting on those dry clothes.

769
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:27,681
Bettis, how about breaking loose
with a bottle of cognac?

770
01:22:27,761 --> 01:22:28,881
We ain't got any.

771
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:31,321
I'll settle for some hot water
to wash my feet in.

772
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:32,921
Coming right up.

773
01:22:40,401 --> 01:22:42,841
Bettis, you got any trading material?

774
01:22:42,921 --> 01:22:46,441
The belly robber keeps everything locked.
But there's half a loaf of bread.

775
01:22:46,521 --> 01:22:48,201
A half a loaf is...

776
01:22:48,681 --> 01:22:50,041
Where is it?

777
01:22:51,241 --> 01:22:53,641
I could have sworn it was on that table.

778
01:23:05,561 --> 01:23:07,201
Hello, soldier.

779
01:23:16,441 --> 01:23:18,321
Pull up a chair, Holley.

780
01:23:22,921 --> 01:23:24,801
Today you are a man.

781
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:48,881
This is Antwerp, up here.

782
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:52,961
To the north and the east
are the British and the Canadians.

783
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:56,961
Down at Belfort, over 300 miles away,
is the French First Army.

784
01:23:57,641 --> 01:24:00,601
The Americans are stretched out
all the way in between.

785
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:03,801
If the supply line to Antwerp is cut...

786
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:07,041
at least 20 Allied divisions
will be strictly out on a limb.

787
01:24:07,281 --> 01:24:08,961
- Where's Bastogne?
- There.

788
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:13,681
This is where the Krauts
found a soft spot in our line.

789
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:16,521
You see why Bastogne is so important.

790
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:19,001
It's at the main intersection
of seven main highways...

791
01:24:19,081 --> 01:24:21,481
one of them leading straight to Antwerp.

792
01:24:21,601 --> 01:24:23,521
Don't know if we can hold out.

793
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:26,121
That sounds like ours.

794
01:24:28,881 --> 01:24:30,201
It is ours!

795
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:35,841
Can't see a thing.

796
01:24:35,881 --> 01:24:38,161
The supplies they've got to drop,
we wouldn't want.

797
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:39,921
A crate of eggs for Berlin.

798
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:42,401
If bombers can get through,
why can't C-47s?

799
01:24:42,481 --> 01:24:43,521
In this pea soup?

800
01:24:43,561 --> 01:24:46,361
- They're flying way over, you know that.
- The air corps.

801
01:24:46,441 --> 01:24:49,321
London this morning,
Berlin this afternoon. Headlines tomorrow.

802
01:24:49,401 --> 01:24:52,801
Fellows, come on back.
It's getting lonesome here!

803
01:24:53,241 --> 01:24:55,801
Nobody cares. They just don't care.

804
01:24:56,721 --> 01:24:58,281
You can say that again.

805
01:25:03,441 --> 01:25:05,761
I thought they had us surrounded.

806
01:25:06,161 --> 01:25:07,201
Halt.

807
01:25:14,601 --> 01:25:17,441
I speak English. Who is here in command?

808
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:20,001
I am here in command.

809
01:25:20,361 --> 01:25:22,841
We have a message
for the commanding general.

810
01:25:23,361 --> 01:25:26,281
I'll get a jeep and take the officers back.
Blindfold them.

811
01:25:46,361 --> 01:25:47,961
Try it again, Jarvess.

812
01:25:55,441 --> 01:25:58,121
All I can get out of them
is their name and rank.

813
01:26:00,081 --> 01:26:01,961
Loosen up, chum. Give us the lowdown.

814
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:04,001
You can talk now. Hitler kaput.

815
01:26:08,161 --> 01:26:10,401
How would you like some nice K rations?

816
01:26:27,441 --> 01:26:31,241
Now we're getting somewhere.
He says he'll talk for a pack of cigarettes.

817
01:26:40,201 --> 01:26:41,481
What did he say?

818
01:26:41,801 --> 01:26:43,441
They want us to surrender.

819
01:26:43,721 --> 01:26:45,641
"Surrender or be killed," he says.

820
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:46,921
Us?

821
01:26:47,441 --> 01:26:50,561
Tell him to go take a flying leap
at a rolling doughnut.

822
01:27:19,841 --> 01:27:22,441
The Major thinks General McAuliffe
must have misunderstood.

823
01:27:22,521 --> 01:27:24,841
We've appealed
to the well-known American humanity...

824
01:27:24,881 --> 01:27:27,681
to save the people of Bastogne
from further suffering.

825
01:27:27,721 --> 01:27:32,081
We have given you two hours to consider
before raining destruction upon you.

826
01:27:32,201 --> 01:27:35,081
We do not understand
General McAuliffe's answer.

827
01:27:35,441 --> 01:27:38,681
I'll be glad to repeat it.
The answer is, "Nuts!"

828
01:27:49,321 --> 01:27:52,081
Is that a negative or an affirmative reply?

829
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:54,241
"Nuts" is strictly negative.

830
01:28:01,321 --> 01:28:03,401
We will kill many Americans.

831
01:28:07,201 --> 01:28:08,761
On your way, bud.

832
01:28:35,401 --> 01:28:38,401
I feel better. For once we know
what's going on around here.

833
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:39,761
For once we get the story...

834
01:28:39,841 --> 01:28:42,961
before my wife writes it up
and it's the daily news.

835
01:29:25,721 --> 01:29:27,521
Here goes my last butt.

836
01:29:27,881 --> 01:29:30,801
Don't tell me your problems.
Tell the chaplain.

837
01:29:32,681 --> 01:29:34,601
Chaplain. I forgot.

838
01:29:35,441 --> 01:29:37,321
We've got nothing to worry about.

839
01:29:37,401 --> 01:29:40,841
Holy Joe is going to pray for us
at the Christmas services.

840
01:29:44,761 --> 01:29:48,161
"They that wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength.

841
01:29:48,881 --> 01:29:51,601
"They shall mount up
with wings as eagles."

842
01:29:53,361 --> 01:29:54,921
If the fog lifts.

843
01:29:56,321 --> 01:29:58,681
"They shall run, and not be weary."

844
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:01,881
Unless they have frozen feet.

845
01:30:03,121 --> 01:30:05,601
"And they shall walk, and not faint."

846
01:30:06,561 --> 01:30:09,721
If they don't lose too much blood
before the medics come up.

847
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:32,241
Another airmail message from the Krauts.

848
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,441
"Merry Christmas, soldier,
and our deepest sympathy.

849
01:30:36,881 --> 01:30:39,521
"It's tough being away from home
at this time of year...

850
01:30:39,561 --> 01:30:42,721
"especially when you're surrounded
and outnumbered 10-to-1.

851
01:30:43,641 --> 01:30:47,201
"Don't you feel your loved ones
worrying about you, praying for you?

852
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:50,561
"Yes, old boy, praying and hoping
you'll come home again.

853
01:30:51,161 --> 01:30:54,641
"Man, have you thought about it?
What if you don't come back?

854
01:30:55,041 --> 01:30:58,201
"Just remember this:
Where there's a will, there's a way.

855
01:30:58,761 --> 01:31:03,041
"Hot chow and safety are waiting for you
only 300 yards away."

856
01:31:51,201 --> 01:31:52,481
Anybody here from Ohio?

857
01:31:52,561 --> 01:31:54,041
- Buckeye Lake, sir.
- Cincinnati.

858
01:31:54,121 --> 01:31:55,921
- Maple Heights, sir.
- Tippecanoe City, sir.

859
01:31:56,001 --> 01:31:58,961
I'm from Chillicothe.
Any of you men Lutherans?

860
01:31:59,041 --> 01:32:00,641
Here, sir.

861
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:02,921
- I am, sir.
- My wife is, sir.

862
01:32:04,401 --> 01:32:05,601
So am I.

863
01:32:06,201 --> 01:32:10,161
These services aren't just for Lutherans,
any more than just for men from Ohio.

864
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:12,241
I merely happen to be in your area.

865
01:32:12,321 --> 01:32:16,481
In other areas, there are other chaplains
of various denominations and religions.

866
01:32:17,081 --> 01:32:19,401
All of us Holy Joes are switch-hitters.

867
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:23,321
Earlier this month in Holland,
I held Hanukkah services...

868
01:32:23,401 --> 01:32:25,561
for some of the men of the Jewish faith.

869
01:32:25,641 --> 01:32:27,281
How did I do, Levenstein?

870
01:32:27,361 --> 01:32:29,121
Not bad for a beginner, sir.

871
01:32:32,241 --> 01:32:33,681
Now it's nearly Christmas...

872
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:37,281
and here we are in beautiful Bastogne
enjoying the winter sports.

873
01:32:39,401 --> 01:32:41,441
And the $64 question is:

874
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:43,841
"Was this trip necessary?"

875
01:32:50,641 --> 01:32:52,521
I'll try to answer that.

876
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:54,961
But my sermons,
like everything else in the army...

877
01:32:55,041 --> 01:32:57,121
depend on the situation and the terrain.

878
01:32:57,161 --> 01:32:59,921
So I assure you
this is going to be a quickie.

879
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:02,041
Was this trip necessary?

880
01:33:04,201 --> 01:33:05,801
Let's look at the facts.

881
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:08,441
Nobody wanted this war but the Nazis.

882
01:33:08,841 --> 01:33:12,801
A great many people tried to deal
with them, and a lot of them are dead.

883
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:14,241
Millions have died...

884
01:33:14,281 --> 01:33:17,641
for no other reason
except that the Nazis wanted them dead.

885
01:33:17,721 --> 01:33:21,721
So, in the final showdown,
there was nothing left to do except fight.

886
01:33:23,001 --> 01:33:24,921
There's a great lesson in this.

887
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:28,481
Those of us who've learned it
the hard way aren't going to forget it.

888
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:33,081
We must never again
let any force dedicated to a super-race...

889
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:36,001
or a super-idea, or super-anything...

890
01:33:36,401 --> 01:33:39,401
become strong enough
to impose itself upon a free world.

891
01:33:40,201 --> 01:33:43,201
We must be smart enough
and tough enough in the beginning...

892
01:33:43,241 --> 01:33:45,921
to put out the fire
before it starts spreading.

893
01:33:46,761 --> 01:33:49,481
So my answer to the $64 question is:

894
01:33:50,161 --> 01:33:53,081
Yes, this trip was necessary.

895
01:33:54,761 --> 01:33:58,081
As the years go by,
a lot of people are going to forget.

896
01:33:58,281 --> 01:33:59,681
But you won't.

897
01:33:59,881 --> 01:34:02,041
And don't ever let anybody tell you...

898
01:34:02,121 --> 01:34:05,361
you were a sucker
to fight in the war against Fascism.

899
01:34:06,361 --> 01:34:08,961
And now, Jerry permitting, let us pray.

900
01:34:11,961 --> 01:34:14,161
Let us pray for this fog to lift.

901
01:34:15,361 --> 01:34:16,921
Almighty God...

902
01:34:22,401 --> 01:34:26,401
The organist is hitting those bass notes
a little too loud for me to be heard.

903
01:34:26,481 --> 01:34:29,881
So let us each pray in his own way,
to his own God.

904
01:35:09,761 --> 01:35:12,401
When you hear planes, men,
don't bother to look up.

905
01:35:12,481 --> 01:35:13,761
They'll be ours.

906
01:35:13,961 --> 01:35:16,361
Yeah, they'll all be going to Berlin.

907
01:35:19,201 --> 01:35:23,601
Layton, you haven't got
a beat-up, old chocolate bar, have you?

908
01:35:24,001 --> 01:35:26,161
I'm on that new lemonade diet.

909
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:29,361
Drop another nickel in the jukebox,
will you, chum?

910
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:36,321
We interrupt this program
with an important announcement.

911
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:39,241
A careful study of the most
scientific instruments and maps...

912
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:41,281
lead to the following weather forecast.

913
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:45,241
Continued cold, more snow,
and no sign of the fog lifting.

914
01:35:45,641 --> 01:35:48,641
And now an old favorite,
which is growing more and more popular...

915
01:35:48,721 --> 01:35:52,081
with the men of the 101st:
I Surrender, Dear.

916
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:15,681
Krauts walking around down there.
Tanks, too.

917
01:36:15,761 --> 01:36:18,601
What am I supposed to use
for ammunition? Spitballs?

918
01:36:18,641 --> 01:36:20,641
We've got 10 rounds left for Old Betsy.

919
01:36:20,681 --> 01:36:24,081
- What about the tank at the roadblock?
- Can't move up. They're out of gas.

920
01:36:24,161 --> 01:36:25,881
Try and get some news on that radio.

921
01:36:25,961 --> 01:36:29,841
Krauts have got it jammed up,
everything except their own wavelength.

922
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:31,361
I'll try again.

923
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:36,281
They ain't even dug in.

924
01:36:36,361 --> 01:36:37,681
- Holley.
- What?

925
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:41,081
Is there anything to those stories
about Krauts shooting prisoners?

926
01:36:41,161 --> 01:36:44,321
- Where'd you get that?
- It's going around.

927
01:36:44,681 --> 01:36:47,961
I heard that if you've got a Kraut pistol
on you when you're captured...

928
01:36:48,041 --> 01:36:49,601
they blow your brains out with it.

929
01:36:49,641 --> 01:36:51,721
Don't fall for them rumors, Layton.

930
01:36:53,481 --> 01:36:56,481
Anybody want a Luger?
It's worth $100 in Paris.

931
01:36:57,841 --> 01:36:59,241
Thanks a lot.

932
01:36:59,881 --> 01:37:03,601
It's a violation of the Sullivan Act
for a civilian to carry firearms.

933
01:37:17,881 --> 01:37:20,801
If I was you, Lieutenant,
I'd hightail it out of here.

934
01:37:22,081 --> 01:37:24,081
Other side of the hill! Dig in!

935
01:37:48,921 --> 01:37:52,081
A careful study of the most
scientific instruments and maps...

936
01:37:52,161 --> 01:37:55,721
leads me to believe
that German bombers are over Bastogne...

937
01:37:55,881 --> 01:37:57,321
fog or no fog.

938
01:37:59,481 --> 01:38:02,001
Kind of rough on rear echelon tonight.

939
01:38:02,441 --> 01:38:03,881
Yeah, I've been thinking...

940
01:38:03,921 --> 01:38:06,041
the Mess Sergeant, the Supply Sergeant...

941
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:09,121
the pill roller who gives us those shots
with a square needle...

942
01:38:09,161 --> 01:38:10,961
I'm bleeding for them.

943
01:38:31,881 --> 01:38:33,481
...let me avoid death...

944
01:38:33,561 --> 01:38:35,321
let me have forgiveness...

945
01:38:35,401 --> 01:38:37,041
the eternal farewell.

946
01:39:24,361 --> 01:39:26,401
Fall out in and draw a rifle!

947
01:39:26,481 --> 01:39:29,001
- A rifle?
- They just made you a rifleman. Me, too.

948
01:39:30,641 --> 01:39:33,841
The medics told me I wasn't supposed
to go up anymore. You can check.

949
01:39:33,921 --> 01:39:35,481
Get your blanket.

950
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:50,281
Fall out. Draw rifles and ammo right now!

951
01:39:52,401 --> 01:39:54,361
- Chow?
- You ain't even warm.

952
01:39:54,441 --> 01:39:56,841
Follow me, all of you, on the double!

953
01:40:03,161 --> 01:40:04,601
That's all, brother.

954
01:40:05,801 --> 01:40:07,921
Hey, you! Front and center!

955
01:40:11,241 --> 01:40:15,201
Good thing they didn't send me up.
I never even fired an M-1 rifle.

956
01:40:15,241 --> 01:40:18,721
Last time I was out on the range,
they were still using the.03.

957
01:40:19,601 --> 01:40:22,441
All litter cases will prepare
to be evacuated immediately...

958
01:40:22,521 --> 01:40:23,801
to air raid shelters.

959
01:40:23,881 --> 01:40:26,961
All walking wounded
will fall out and draw rifles.

960
01:40:57,001 --> 01:41:00,681
This is a.30-caliber, gas-operated,
clip-fed, semiautomatic rifle.

961
01:41:00,761 --> 01:41:04,121
Look, you ain't selling it to me.
You're only showing me how it works.

962
01:41:04,201 --> 01:41:08,001
To load it, you just pull the bolt back
like this, and stick the clip in.

963
01:41:16,121 --> 01:41:19,161
- What's up, Smitty?
- Battalion says to pull back.

964
01:41:20,001 --> 01:41:22,961
- Go ahead.
- You, too, sir. They said to tell you.

965
01:41:44,841 --> 01:41:47,281
It's a cinch we ain't pulling back that way.

966
01:41:52,521 --> 01:41:55,361
I guess maybe we ain't pulling back at all.

967
01:41:56,041 --> 01:41:58,081
Lieutenant, take the second squad.

968
01:41:58,201 --> 01:42:01,441
First squad! Third squad! Over here.

969
01:42:24,961 --> 01:42:26,481
Save it, Layton.

970
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:30,041
They'll be getting a lot closer,
and we'll still be here.

971
01:43:27,801 --> 01:43:29,241
It's shining!

972
01:43:49,881 --> 01:43:51,321
How have you been?

973
01:43:57,601 --> 01:44:01,521
Jarvess, look at them! They got here!

974
01:44:13,321 --> 01:44:15,681
Drive them out of there! Blast them!

975
01:44:20,521 --> 01:44:22,241
C-47s!

976
01:44:39,561 --> 01:44:40,961
What was that about eagles?

977
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:43,401
"They shall mount up
with wings as eagles.

978
01:44:54,241 --> 01:44:56,041
"They shall run and not be weary."

979
01:44:56,121 --> 01:44:58,801
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Let's go!

980
01:45:47,561 --> 01:45:50,841
- Save me a couple of drops for my lighter.
- Lighter?

981
01:45:51,121 --> 01:45:54,041
I got a little old lamp I got to fill
back in Bastogne.

982
01:46:10,881 --> 01:46:12,161
K rations.

983
01:46:13,201 --> 01:46:14,561
All dinners.

984
01:46:21,241 --> 01:46:23,081
Hey, fellows, here it is.

985
01:46:25,121 --> 01:46:27,361
Hey, fellows, come and get it.

986
01:46:39,081 --> 01:46:40,601
Here, take your watch.

987
01:47:56,961 --> 01:47:59,281
Daddy, what are them things?

988
01:48:00,881 --> 01:48:04,241
It's a new kind of warfare, son.
Mechanized, I think they call it.

989
01:48:04,321 --> 01:48:06,481
Read about it in the Stars and Stripes.

990
01:48:06,561 --> 01:48:08,681
What will they think of next?

991
01:48:09,401 --> 01:48:12,281
Tank job, cigarette for papa?

992
01:48:15,281 --> 01:48:17,161
Got a Stars and Stripes?

993
01:48:19,241 --> 01:48:22,281
It's two days old.
Heard it's been pretty rugged up here.

994
01:48:24,361 --> 01:48:27,241
That's for sure. That's for dang sure.

995
01:48:30,401 --> 01:48:31,801
Hey, handsome.

996
01:48:34,201 --> 01:48:35,481
Good luck!

997
01:48:42,201 --> 01:48:45,081
The folks back home
knew we'd get out of this.

998
01:48:45,441 --> 01:48:48,601
They heard relief was breaking through
two days ago.

999
01:48:49,001 --> 01:48:51,841
Fine. I'd hate to think
they'd been worrying.

1000
01:48:53,601 --> 01:48:56,801
You'll be happy to know we're in Belgium,
not Luxembourg.

1001
01:48:57,761 --> 01:49:00,681
Just so we're going back.
That's all that counts.

1002
01:49:00,761 --> 01:49:03,161
You mean you're not happy in the service?

1003
01:49:03,241 --> 01:49:05,641
I didn't say that. I love it.

1004
01:49:06,121 --> 01:49:07,841
You found a home in the Army, chum.

1005
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:10,561
Me, too. Never had it so good in my life.

1006
01:49:48,361 --> 01:49:51,641
Third platoon, on your feet.

1007
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:56,321
Fall in.

1008
01:49:58,121 --> 01:50:00,241
Oh, no!

1009
01:50:34,521 --> 01:50:36,641
About face.

1010
01:50:50,081 --> 01:50:52,001
Forward march.

1011
01:51:12,841 --> 01:51:14,761
Whatever happened to Jody?

1012
01:51:24,881 --> 01:51:26,561
All right. Come on.

1013
01:51:26,641 --> 01:51:29,441
What do you want these guys to think,
you're a bunch of WACs?

1014
01:51:29,521 --> 01:51:32,801
All right. Pick it up. Hut, two, three.

1015
01:51:33,305 --> 01:52:33,233
