1
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:44,361
- Ally, can we get a recap?
- You remember the Kowolskis.

2
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:47,376
They've owned this shop for 30 years,
and they are attempting to set a record...

3
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:51,524
by making Buffalo's largest cookie,
and you have to wear this.

4
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,204
- A hair net?
- Health department.

5
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:55,167
- You're kidding me.
- If you're working around the cookie...

6
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:56,624
 you have to have it on.
It's the law.

7
00:00:56,697 --> 00:00:59,382
I just did the hair.
The hair is perfect.

8
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,761
All right. Give it to me.

9
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:07,324
God, why do you hate me?

10
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:07,982
We're rolling.

11
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:10,352
And speed.

12
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:13,314
For three decades, the
Kowolski family bakery...

13
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,949
has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo...

14
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:20,020
known for their sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski pierogis...

15
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:23,815
and the occasional
sugar-induced coma that follows.

16
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:27,160
But today, in honor of
their 30th anniversary,

17
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:31,581
they've invited us to ride along
as they go for the record...

18
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:34,793
on Buffalo's biggest cookie.

19
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,710
Vol. Vol?

20
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,756
You need a tissue or something?

21
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:43,385
Can we get Vol a tissue or a spoon?

22
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,847
It's a good thing we're wearing these today,
'cause I wouldn't want any stray hairs...

23
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,849
to fall into the booger.

24
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:51,368
- Are we gonna do this again?
- No. We can cut to B-roll.

25
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:52,542
Moving on!

26
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:57,465
So tell me, Mama.
Why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?

27
00:01:57,524 --> 00:02:05,163
Well... man from health department
say he find rat pellet in our pastry

28
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:12,497
but I say "No. Is big chocolate
sprinkle." But he shut store down.

29
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,293
So we clean up, make big cookie...

30
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:19,314
for to bring customers back.

31
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:24,253
Well, I admire your candor.
Let's try that again, shall we?

32
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:29,214
So tell me, Mama. Why make
Buffalo's biggest cookie?

33
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:33,944
So the children of the
neighborhood will be happy?

34
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:38,823
That's right. It must be wonderful
seeing the smiles on their little faces.

35
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:41,910
I work in back. I see no smiles.

36
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,832
The previous Buffalo
record was eight feet, seven inches,

37
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:48,834
baked by Gladys Pelsnick.

38
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:51,962
If this cookie beats Gladys's,
it will prove once and for all...

39
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:54,181
that the Kowolskis have
much more free time.

40
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:56,368
And the cookie is...

41
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,200
10 feet, four inches.

42
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,971
We have a new record!

43
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:04,683
Cue the cheesy inspirational music!

44
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:24,577
But what are we really looking at here?

45
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:29,708
Is it just a big cookie, or does this
cookie represent the pride of Buffalo,

46
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,545
its dedicated and hardworking
citizens the key ingredient...

47
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:36,381
with a few nuts thrown in...

48
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:38,842
and, finally, the love of our families,

49
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,303
which provides the warm, chewy center,

50
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:45,766
making our beloved Buffalo
the sweetest place to live.

51
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,852
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.

52
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:52,574
I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News.

53
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,882
<i>And cut it.</i>

54
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:56,710
So, what do you think?

55
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,155
- I think it's really good.
- It sucks.

56
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:02,074
It's a story about a cookie.

57
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,493
The Pillsbury Doughboy will be riveted.

58
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:07,746
Honey, it was
funny. It made me laugh.

59
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:10,082
There's nothing wrong
with makin' people laugh.

60
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:12,208
I'll never be an
anchorman, not with this.

61
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:16,004
The job's right there, but I can't reach it, because
every time they make me do this kinda stuff,

62
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,924
I have to act like a total
goof in order to make it work.

63
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,228
I have no credibility. Not good. Not good.

64
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:24,830
- Ok, you know what? Now you're just sounding silly.
- You know what? Forget it.

65
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:27,182
It's not important,
right? It's not important.

66
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:29,434
- Let's watch it one more time.
- Oh, no.

67
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,149
- Just once more. Please?
- No.

68
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,422
No. Bruce, you promised that you
would help me with this photo album.

69
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,818
Now, you get your goofy butt over here.

70
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,909
Okay.

71
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:48,537
Okay. Okay. Now, you just
go through this stack,

72
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,748
and you pick your favorites.

73
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:57,671
Oh, come on. This is fun.
Right? Isn't this fun?

74
00:04:57,754 --> 00:05:00,131
This is nice.

75
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,175
Evan's gonna get that anchor job.
I just know it.

76
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,178
- Oh, Bruce!
- He's the favorite.

77
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:06,430
All right. You know what? Just
forget it. Let's just forget it.

78
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:11,018
This is just our life. We can always
just have some kid do it for us.

79
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:15,092
Whoa! Hold the phone! I like this one.

80
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:16,951
Our weekend at the lake.

81
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:19,648
How did you get that? That's
supposed to be in our private stash.

82
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,239
- You look perky, hon. It must've been cold.
- All right. Just give it to me.

83
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:25,368
 I think I'll put this on my
computer and use it as wallpaper.

84
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:27,361
- Okay. Give it to me. Come on!
- Hey, hey. No, no, no.

85
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:31,196
All right. Fine. Do with it
what you will. I don't care.

86
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:34,423
- I will do with it what I will.
- Jesus.

87
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:38,753
You know, I might even
send this in to Playboy.

88
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,674
- I hear their layouts can be quite tasteful.
- Give that to me right now!

89
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,185
Sweetie? Time to get up.

90
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:56,104
Uh-uh.

91
00:05:56,188 --> 00:06:00,359
Good dream. No. Uh-uh. No.

92
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:10,327
<i>Well, the Buffalo Sabres
lost again last night...</i>

93
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,370
<i>at the hands of the Toronto Maple Leafs.</i>

94
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:15,624
<i>- It was a shootout on the ice for our hometown...</i>
- Of course they did. They're my team.

95
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:18,178
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.

96
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,381
You know, I think there might be
something to this cookie line.

97
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:23,679
All the greatest anchors have
had their own signature sign-off.

98
00:06:24,214 --> 00:06:26,928
Like Wal-ter Cron-kite.

99
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:30,817
And that's the way it was.

100
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,790
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.

101
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,494
And that's the way,
uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it,

102
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,782
uh-huh, uh-huh.

103
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,634
Oh, no. Grace, the dog!

104
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,854
<i>I'm in the shower!</i>

105
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,851
No, Sam! Bad dog!

106
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:53,300
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

107
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:55,430
Inside, bad. Outside, good.

108
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,486
Oh, you're done now.

109
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:02,922
Great.

110
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:07,050
B-E-A-utiful.

111
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:10,888
Come on. Let's go back inside and have a shit.

112
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,563
- What is the deal-io?
- We are having a blood drive.

113
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:21,607
Creepy. Needles. Yuck.

114
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,902
Well, they need my blood.
I have a very rare blood type.

115
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:27,195
- I'm A.B.-Positive.
- Really?

116
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,860
I'm I.B.-Positive.

117
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:32,668
I be positive they ain't touchin'
me with no needle. It's just so...

118
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:36,463
- Helpful and lifesaving?
- No. It's your blood. It's blood.

119
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,499
Blood's supposed to stay inside the
body. That's where it's meant to be.

120
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,294
Besides, they stockpile this
stuff in a warehouse somewhere.

121
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:44,921
It's all frozen on ice, and they
tell everybody there's a shortage.

122
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,633
That's just not true.
Where did you hear that?

123
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,910
From a very reliable friend
of a friend of a girl...

124
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:53,147
whose sister's going out with someone
very high up in the government.

125
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,864
But for your own protection,
I cannot discuss it at this time.

126
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:59,017
- Now, get out before they see us together.
- Oh, no.

127
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:05,150
Oh. Here. Hold on a second.
You need these more than I do.

128
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,610
- What is these?
- Prayer beads.

129
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:11,615
The kids made 'em for me.
They will keep you safe.

130
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:16,338
I hope they're powerful. I'm gonna need
a friggin' miracle to get to work on time.

131
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,093
This isn't happening. Not now.
Not during sweeps week.

132
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:34,346
Not during sweeps week!

133
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:36,924
Oh, God.

134
00:08:37,814 --> 00:08:40,644
Yeah. Yeah. Meeting's
started without me.

135
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:43,730
This is my luck. This is my luck!

136
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,568
Shit.

137
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:52,781
Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

138
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,176
Jesus.

139
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,862
 Get out of there!

140
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:07,928
"Are you blind?"
 No, but I'm late.

141
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:12,134
Is your child in dire jeopardy?

142
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:16,096
- Find out tonight after the game.
- Okay. Promos are approved.

143
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:19,933
Uh, Jack, shouldn't we be focusing
on Pete's retirement?

144
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,521
- I mean, this is his last week.
- Yeah, Jack. Any word on the open anchor position?

145
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,940
Evan, when I know something, you'll
know something.

146
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:31,278
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was...

147
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,406
Did you guys already play the
spots? It's a nice story, Bruce,

148
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:38,535
but we're gonna go with Evan's piece... sex
scandal in the mayor's office... for sweeps.

149
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,999
Oh, yeah. Sweeps.

150
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,918
And that's the
way the cookie crumbles.

151
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:50,547
I'm just
messing with you, Bruce.

152
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,884
See, you just gotta
remember that the newsroom...

153
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:57,262
is like a big cookie.

154
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,758
- Do you like jazz, Evan?
- Yeah.

155
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:02,643
Let me play something for ya.

156
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:12,694
- I can hold that note all day, buddy.
- Knock it off, guys.

157
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,615
Bruce, we're gonna keep your story in
reserve. Now, can we get back to the board...

158
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:19,701
so we'll have something
to put on the air today?

159
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,955
Great choice, Jack. This
is the Cadillac of bolognas.

160
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,582
- Okay. Thanks.
- Jack, can I talk to you for a second?

161
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,961
- Yeah. Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
- Sweeps.

162
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,046
Jack! Hear me out here.

163
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:34,758
I'm startin' to get desperate, man. I'm
pushin' 40, and what have I got to show for it?

164
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:39,096
I've hit some kind of a ceiling here. There's
an anti-Bruce barrier I can't get past.

165
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,848
And Evan is lovin' it, by the way.

166
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:46,187
Lovin' it. He gets the stories. He gets on
sweeps. Maybe I should be more like Evan.

167
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,231
You don't wanna be like
Evan. Evan's an asshole.

168
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:52,025
- I can be an asshole.
- No, Bruce. You can't.

169
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,116
- You gonna pick that up?
- Yeah. I'm sorry. It's...

170
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:03,453
I'm losin' it. It's just this whole
anchor thing opening up has got me nuts.

171
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,165
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Susan.

172
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,798
 Hi, Jack.

173
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:10,460
Look, Bruce. You're a good
reporter. You make people laugh.

174
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:18,260
All right. I'll tell you what. Today is the
156th anniversary of the Maid of the Mist.

175
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:21,179
- I want you at Niagara Falls in an hour.
- Maid of the Mist?

176
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:24,182
- That's always live.
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:28,687
- But Evan always does live feeds.
- Now you and Evan get the live feeds.

178
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,941
- I'm going live? During sweeps?
- But watch your step, Bruce.

179
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,195
- I've seen your outtakes.
- Jack, you will not regret this.

180
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,949
And I won't forget you when
I go national. Uh, can you...

181
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:42,193
Thanks, pal.

182
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:45,493
Can I have your wish now?

183
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm gonna put it in
the wish jar. Thank you.

184
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,626
- Okay. Put your wish in there.
- Me too.

185
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,171
Put your wish in there.
Look at that. Looks like a big wish.

186
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:57,466
Oh, no, no. Oh, no. Martin, don't...
don't eat that. Don't eat that.

187
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:01,595
Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey. Ooh.

188
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:05,682
- That must've tasted awful.
- Mommy!

189
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,603
Oh, Zoe-Baboey! Did you have
a good time with Aunt Crazy today?

190
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:13,398
Mm-hmm. Yeah? See how nice
this is? Baby on the hip?

191
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:18,853
Oh, it's amazing. You've become
Mom. The transformation is complete.

192
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:20,613
I'll get it.

193
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,784
<i>- Small Wonders Day Care.</i>
- Grace?

194
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,586
No. It's Debbie, the sister
whose life you're not wasting.

195
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,996
- Oh, all right. Okay, okay, okay.
<i>- Bye, Debbie!</i>

196
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,165
Oops. Hi. Hi. Sorry.

197
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:33,334
Debbie forgot to take her
meds today. Where are ya?

198
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:38,650
Oh, a little place called the winner's
circle. I'm at the falls doing a live report.

199
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,428
- Live? That's great!
- Yeah! It's happening, hon. I got sweeps, and I'm live.

200
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:45,889
You know what that means? They're
seein' if I can think on my feet,

201
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,850
you know, like I might have to do
in a live news anchor situation.

202
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,188
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah. It's what we've always talked about, Grace.

203
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,899
- Jack practically came out and told me.
- Practically?

204
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,902
Well, he didn't spell it
out, but legally, he can't.

205
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:03,574
But this is exactly what happened to Susan
Ortega just before they bumped her up to the desk.

206
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,742
It's good. It's good.
It's good.

207
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,955
Okay. Well, honey, I just don't... I don't
want you to get too ahead of yourself.

208
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,374
Bruce? Oh, I gotta go.
They're callin' me in.

209
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,459
Oh. Okay, honey. Good luck. I love you.

210
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,878
Love, love, love, love, love.

211
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,964
Let's do it.

212
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:22,300
- They want you close to the falls.
- Really?

213
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,846
- I'm gonna get soaked.
- That's the point. They want you to put this on.

214
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,932
Part of the condition of
us getting the exclusive.

215
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,937
You know what? Nothin' can
bother me today. Nothin'.

216
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,982
Okay. Now, remember. It's their
156th-year anniversary.

217
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,359
- 149 capacity.
- Right.

218
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,947
- They cater to tourists, honeymooners...
- And people who are insanely thirsty.

219
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:43,876
- I get it.
- Okay.

220
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:46,766
And you are gonna be
interviewing Irene Dansfield.

221
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,786
Irene! Pleasure to meet you. Truly.

222
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,956
- You look beautiful.
- Irene's mother rode on the maiden voyage.

223
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,251
- Wow. Rub that in my face, why don't ya?
- Ninety seconds!

224
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,296
Ninety seconds? Holy hell. Uh,
yeah. Okay. Ninety seconds? Whoo.

225
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:04,092
Because of the fast response, the toxic
chemicals were cleaned up without incident.

226
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:08,347
- Susan?
- Bruce Nolan is standing by at Niagara Falls,

227
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,932
but before we go live to Bruce,
we have an announcement to make.

228
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,894
As everyone knows, after 33 years,

229
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,688
our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.

230
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,734
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible to fill,

231
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:24,112
But the show must go on, and we
could think of no one better...

232
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,776
than our very own...

233
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,440
Evan Baxter.

234
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:31,203
Ohh... Oh, boy.

235
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,289
- Congratulations, Evan.
- Thanks, Susan. I'm thrilled and honored.

236
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:39,086
And as you said, no one can replace the
great Pete Fineman, but I will do my best.

237
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,882
I have to say, I am so proud to be a
part of our local community of Buffalo,

238
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:49,096
and I think, in a lot of ways, a great
city is like a great recipe, really.

239
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,724
You take hardworking
citizens, add some caregivers,

240
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,893
maybe a few nuts,

241
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,650
All sprinkled with the love and
support of our good families.

242
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:05,696
Ultimately, that makes
one sweet place to live.

243
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,781
- That was amazing.
- I meant it.

244
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,492
- I wish I'd written something.
- And now let's go live...

245
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:13,203
to that wacky Bruce Nolan
out at Niagara Falls.

246
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,281
Hey! Wacky Bruce!

247
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,002
Bruce? Talk, Bruce. Hello?

248
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,026
Talk, honey. Talk.

249
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:24,466
- What's going on?
- We got a Walt Disney.

250
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:27,135
- He's frozen solid.
- We may not have audio. Check the feed

251
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,345
- We may be having a bit of technical difficulty.
- Feed's good, Jack.

252
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,637
Move. Come on. Come on. Come
on. Talk, Bruce, damn it!

253
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:35,295
All right. Get ready to pull the plug.

254
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:38,440
Oh Come on, baby. Say something.
Say something.

255
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,106
Bruce, talk.

256
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:44,818
- Hi, Susan.
- Oh, thank you, God.

257
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:49,990
<i>Bruce Nolan here aboard the Maid of
the Mist in fabulous Niagara Falls, New York.</i>

258
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:54,911
First off, let me just add another
congratulations to Evan Backstabber...

259
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,597
Pardon me. Bastard.
Baxter, rather.

260
00:15:57,598 --> 00:16:00,119
It is good to see what someone
with real talent can do...

261
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,239
when great opportunities are given to
them instead of me.

262
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:07,841
Anyway, I'm here with
Katharine Hepburn's mom.

263
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:12,720
Tell me. Why did you throw the blue Heart of
the Ocean jewel over the railing of the Titanic?

264
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,560
Did you feel bad at all letting Leo DiCaprio
drown while you were safe, floating on the big door?

265
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:23,691
Could you have taken turns, or were you just
too afraid to freeze your big, fat ass off?

266
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,051
I guess that's how life is, isn't it?

267
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,780
Some people are drenched, freezing
to death on a stupid boat...

268
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:34,659
with a stupid hat, while others are in a
comfy news studio, suckin' up all the glory.

269
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,890
Oh, well. No big deal.

270
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,457
Oh, look. It's the owner
of the Maid of the Mist.

271
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,582
Let's have a talk
with him, shall we?

272
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,834
- Come on in here, Bill.
- That's all right.

273
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,878
No, no, no, no. No, no.
Come on. Let's have a talk.

274
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,047
Come on. What are you doing?

275
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,258
Bill, you've been running the Maid
of the Mist for 23 years, now tell me.

276
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,929
- Why do you think I didn't get the anchor job?
- Hey, man. I don't want any problems.

277
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,681
Is it my hair, Bill?
Are my teeth not white enough?

278
00:16:56,723 --> 00:17:01,144
Or like the great falls,
is the bedrock of my life...

279
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,855
eroding beneath me?

280
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:09,069
Eroding! Eroding! Eroding!

281
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:11,989
Cut the feed. Go to black.

282
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,666
- Go to black.
- I'm on it.

283
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,870
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness
News. Back to you, fuckers!

284
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:22,291
Oh, my God.

285
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:32,050
That is perfect. That is
the motivation that I needed!

286
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,470
Right there! Thank you.

287
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,932
Thank you, W.K.B.W!

288
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,060
Wimpy Kitty Baby Whiners!

289
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,147
That's what that stands for!

290
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:50,819
I'll see you on Channel 5,
where they do the real news.

291
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:54,406
Do I look blind to you? Do I look blind to you?

292
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:59,619
- Hey.
- Let's go, man. Come on. Let's go.

293
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:04,583
What are you doing over there?
Come on. Leave the poor guy alone.

294
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,628
You okay, man?

295
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:10,922
Yeah, you better keep walkin'.

296
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,924
What? What'd you say, ese?

297
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:18,472
Run, man! Run! Oh, God!

298
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,562
Okay, okay, okay! I didn't
mean it! I was just kiddin'!

299
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,231
Hey, you forgot your things.

300
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,321
Say somethin' to that. Say somethin'.

301
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,870
B-E-A...

302
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,998
utiful.

303
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:49,503
That's what I get...

304
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:53,799
That's what I
get for trying to help someone.

305
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,970
Oh, don't look at me, Walter.

306
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,015
Oh, no!

307
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:06,436
Well, that's my payment, I guess.

308
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,606
That... That is my reward.

309
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:17,322
Just? Just get a clue!

310
00:19:18,695 --> 00:19:22,619
- Oh thank God you're all right.
- God, yeah. Let's thank God, shall we?

311
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,414
For his blessings are
raining down upon me.

312
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,417
- Wait! That's not rain!
- Bruce, please don't do that, honey.

313
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,670
You know that everything
happens for a reason.

314
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,798
That I don't need. That is a
cliche. That is not helpful to me.

315
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,966
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

316
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,928
I have no bird. I have no bush.
God has taken my bird and my bush.

317
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,682
Oh, I see. So God is picking on
you, is that what you're saying?

318
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,060
No. He's ignoring me completely.

319
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,439
He's far too busy giving Evan everything he wants.

320
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,608
Oh, that's great, Sam, but you
missed your target. I'm over here!

321
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,528
Don't get mad at the dog.
It's not the dog's fault.

322
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,364
No. It's God's fault. I gave
him the wrong coordinates.

323
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,534
All right. You know what? Enough. All
right? Will you stop being such a martyr?

324
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,120
I am not being a martyr. I'm a victim.

325
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:09,040
God is a mean kid sitting on an anthill
with a magnifying glass, and I'm the ant.

326
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,418
He could fix my life in
five minutes if he wanted to,

327
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,838
but he'd rather burn off my
feelers and watch me squirm!

328
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,299
Sweetheart, I know you're
mad. It's completely understandable.

329
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,844
What Evan did is slimy and wrong,

330
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,388
but this day could've
been so much worse.

331
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,060
- I'm just glad you're okay.
- Okay? News flash! I'm not okay.

332
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,605
I'm not okay with a mediocre job! I'm
not okay with a mediocre apartment.

333
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,066
I'm not okay with a mediocre life!

334
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,662
So is that what you think
that we have? A mediocre life?

335
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,792
- Don't make this about you.
- About me? How could I make this about me?

336
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,878
It's about you! It's always about you!

337
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,756
Perfect. Perfect.

338
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,636
I'll have the worst day of my life
with a side order of guilt, please!

339
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,311
Okay, God. You want me to talk to you?

340
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,815
Then talk back. Tell me what's going on.

341
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,734
What should I do? Give me a signal.

342
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:24,157
Oh, I need your guidance,
Lord. Please send me a sign.

343
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,581
Ah, what's this joker doin' now?

344
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,757
Okay. All right. I'll try it your way.

345
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,261
All right. Lord, I need a miracle.

346
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,641
I'm desperate. I need your help, Lord.

347
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:54,980
Please reach into my life. Hey!

348
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:59,151
What the he... I got ya!

349
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:46,031
Fine! The gloves are off, pal!

350
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,825
Come on! Let me see a little wrath.

351
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:53,288
Smite me, Oh mighty smiter!

352
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,083
You're the one who should be fired!

353
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:01,171
The only one around here
not doing his job is you!

354
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,633
Answer me!

355
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:21,817
Sorry. Don't know ya.

356
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,195
Wouldn't call you if I did.

357
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,783
Ohh.

358
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:40,419
Oh, God. Ohh.

359
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,843
Hello 555 0123.

360
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:12,826
Oh, no!

361
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,372
Sam, this has gotta stop.

362
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,793
All right. Now, get it straight here.

363
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,837
That's the house. This is
the bathroom. House. Bathroom.

364
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,299
Bathroom. House. House.
Bathroom. Bathroom. House.

365
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,137
What's the point?

366
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,002
Denied that promotion at work?
Is life unfair?

367
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:07,131
Is there someone less talented
than you reaping all the benefits?

368
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,218
Is your name Bruce? Then
do we have the job for you.

369
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,429
We're located at 77256 23rd Street.

370
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,892
So come on down, or we'll
just keep beeping you.

371
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,870
"Omni Presents"

372
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,832
Oh, yeah. The glass is half full.

373
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,085
Oh, geez!

374
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,338
Come on! Look! What is that?

375
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,592
What is that?

376
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:55,345
Ah, geez! Thank you. Thank you again.

377
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,563
What the...

378
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:14,406
You're looking for Room 7.

379
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,285
Yeah. I figured.

380
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,496
You want me to even those up for you?

381
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:25,918
How do I get to Room 7?

382
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,046
That'll be on the seventh floor.
Stairs are right over there.

383
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,424
- I'd rather take the elevator.
- Out of order.

384
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,510
I love the stairs though.
They were my second choice.

385
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,347
Do you mind giving me
a hand with this floor?

386
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,767
What? That's good.

387
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,813
Are you serious? Oh,
uh, I'm kind of busy.

388
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,943
- Um, rain check.
- I'll hold you to it.

389
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,823
I'm free on the seventh at 7:00.

390
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,911
Seventh at 7:00 it is.

391
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,123
This looks promising.

392
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,532
Hello?

393
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:17,135
Another "hugantic,"
"ginormic" waste of my life.

394
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,106
Hello?

395
00:27:21,176 --> 00:27:24,559
- Yo! I'm lookin' for whoever runs this joint.
- Be right with ya.

396
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm trying to fix a light.
Tell me if it's working.

397
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,815
Yeah. Seems to be.

398
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,444
- Kind of bright, though.
- Yeah. It is for most people.

399
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:39,658
Spend their lives in the
dark trying to hide from me.

400
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,411
Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?

401
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,581
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.

402
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:51,044
- You install the Clapper?
- No, but catchy jingle, isn't it?

403
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:53,655
"Clap on, clap off"

404
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,259
"Clap on, clap off the Clapper"

405
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,394
Just can't get it out of my head.

406
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:03,750
Well, good luck with that. I'm gonna go now.

407
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,185
Okay. But the boss'll be right out.

408
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:19,489
You must be Bruce.
I've been expecting you.

409
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:26,037
This is hilarious. So you're the boss
and the electrician and the janitor?

410
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,249
Must be a killer Christmas party.
Don't get drunk, though.

411
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,045
One of you might need a ride home.

412
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,882
You always were funny,
Bruce, just like your father.

413
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,884
He didn't mind rolling up
his sleeves, either, son.

414
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:43,639
People underestimate the
benefit of good old manual labor.

415
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,017
There's freedom in it. Some of
the happiest people in the world...

416
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,770
go home smelling to high
heaven at the end of the day.

417
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,564
All right. What is this?

418
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,150
How do you know my father, and
how did you get my pager number?

419
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,254
Oh, I know quite a
lot about you, Bruce...

420
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,574
Just about everything there is to know.

421
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:08,497
Everything you've ever said or
done or thought about doing...

422
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,874
Right there in that file cabinet.

423
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:13,752
Wow. A whole drawer just for me.

424
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,922
- Yeah.
- Mind if I take a look?

425
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:22,302
- It's your life.
- This oughta be good.

426
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:41,030
Now, this last entry
was a little disturbing.

427
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:53,425
"The gloves are off, God."

428
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,003
"God has taken my bird and my bush."

429
00:29:56,086 --> 00:30:00,007
"God is a mean kid with a magnifying glass."

430
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,635
"Smite me, Oh mighty smiter!"

431
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,806
Now, I'm not much for blaspheming,
but that last one made me laugh.

432
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,767
Are you spying on me?

433
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,444
Who are you?

434
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:17,048
I'm the one.

435
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,034
- Huh?
- Creator of the Heavens and the Earth...

436
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:21,611
Alpha and Omega.

437
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:25,157
Oh, I see where this is going.

438
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,243
Bruce, I'm God.

439
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,664
Bingo! Yahtzee! Is that your final answer?

440
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:35,751
Our survey says, "God!"
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing!

441
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,504
Well, it was nice to meet you, God.
Thank you for the Grand Canyon,

442
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,757
and good luck with the Apocalypse.

443
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,384
Oh, and by the way, you suck!

444
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:47,721
You know what would've been a
little more impressive, though?

445
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,724
If you hadn't used the
cheesy file cabinet illusion.

446
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,685
Anybody with a brain stem
can tell that that drawer...

447
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,063
is being fed through the
wall from the other side.

448
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,899
All you have to do is find
the crease, right around here.

449
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:03,070
There is a seam here...
or a hollow spot.

450
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:12,329
Where? Through the drywall and concrete?

451
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,835
Okay. That is a good one.
That is a good one.

452
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,547
- Okay. How many fingers am I holding up?
- Now, Bruce.

453
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,853
- Thou shalt not tempt the Lord...
- Hey, if you can't do it, man, that's cool.

454
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:27,928
Three. Two. Four. Nine. Six.

455
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,014
Eight. One.

456
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:35,852
Okay. How many now?

457
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,272
- Seven.
- Aha!

458
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:45,754
You've been doing a lot
of complaining about me, Bruce.

459
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,074
- And quite frankly, I'm tired of it.
- Wait. Don't come near me, seriously.

460
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,243
When I'm backed into a corner,
I'm like a wild animal.

461
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,579
- I don't wanna hurt you, but I will, out of instinct.
- You haven't won a fight...

462
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,498
since grade five, and
that was against a girl.

463
00:31:57,836 --> 00:32:00,719
Yeah, but she was huge.
She had been held back.

464
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:05,215
And the sun was in your
eyes. Oh, there you go.

465
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,885
Anyway, I brought you
here to offer you a job.

466
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,596
- Job? What job?
- My job.

467
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,099
You think you can do it
better, so here's your chance.

468
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:18,228
When you leave this building, you
will be endowed with all my powers.

469
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,380
Sure, whatever you say, pal.

470
00:32:24,302 --> 00:32:28,488
Okay. That did not happen, and
no one needs to hear about it.

471
00:32:28,588 --> 00:32:30,966
I'm deleting the program.

472
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:35,154
No. No. I'm having a
breakdown, that's what it is.

473
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:39,499
Normal, everyday psychotic episode
caused by a tumor or brain lesion.

474
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,127
Come on. Start!

475
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:45,555
That was lucky.

476
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:56,182
Come on, man. Calm down. You did not
meet God; you do not have his powers.

477
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,686
If that was God, then
I'm Clint Eastwood.

478
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,773
Holy hell!

479
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,197
Be careful what you wish for, punk.

480
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,367
No. Uh-uh! No. No.

481
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:19,289
I am a reasonable, sane
human being with a. 44 Magnum,

482
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,542
the most powerful handgun
in the wo...

483
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,170
I'm not Clint Eastwood. I'm Bruce Nolan.

484
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:29,591
Bruce Nolan. I'm Bruce No-lan!

485
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,648
Oh, it's not real. It's not real.

486
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:50,153
- Coffee?
- Yeah. Uh, coffee. Yeah.

487
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,573
- We have a special on soup today.
- No. That's fine. No, thank you.

488
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,285
It's tomato. I made it myself.

489
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,538
- Okay.
- Okay.

490
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,710
Excuse me. I need a sp...

491
00:34:42,982 --> 00:34:44,241
It's okay. I found one.

492
00:34:52,408 --> 00:34:53,892
Here's your soup.

493
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:58,138
Oh, soup. Right. Uh, yeah. Right.

494
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,815
Having fun?

495
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:53,193
Thy... Thou...

496
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:56,572
Come. Take a closer walk with me.

497
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,451
- Let me explain the rules.
- Rules?

498
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:05,455
Yeah. You left in such a rush,
I didn't get a chance to explain.

499
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,792
Two extra fingers freaked
me out a little bit.

500
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,836
I just figured I'd get your attention.

501
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,880
I did the same thing to Gandhi;
he didn't eat for three weeks.

502
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:17,551
Anyway, here's the deal.

503
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,637
You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.

504
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,099
There are only two rules. You
can't tell anybody you're God.

505
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,476
Believe me, you don't want
that kind of attention.

506
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:30,355
And you can't mess with free will.

507
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,025
Uh-huh. Can I ask why?

508
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:37,821
Yes, you can! That's the beauty of it!

509
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,456
- This is amazing.
- Speaking of amazing... Excuse me.

510
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,126
Oh.

511
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,714
Holy sh... cow.

512
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:59,051
Since you're through with
these, I think I'll keep 'em.

513
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,095
Might come in handy someday.

514
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:05,057
See you around, kid.

515
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,934
- Where you going?
- I'm taking a vacation.

516
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:12,898
God doesn't take vacations,
does he? Do... ye?

517
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,985
Did you ever hear of the Dark
Ages? Besides, I'm covered.

518
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:21,073
You can clear everything up in
five minutes if you want to, right?

519
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,034
Ciao.

520
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,447
<i>"I've got the power"</i>
Boom!

521
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,580
And he saw that it was good.

522
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:21,049
Whoa.

523
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:37,984
B-E-A-utiful.

524
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,993
- Hey. Check it out. Check it out.
- Hey. Check it out.

525
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,663
Oh, look. It's the hero.
What's up, homie?

526
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:54,166
Yo, brethren, what up with thee?

527
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,547
Blessings on your alley.

528
00:38:55,547 --> 00:38:58,003
Looking for another can of whoop-ass?

529
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:01,694
- You didn't get enough, Mr. Hero?
- He wants some more.

530
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:05,344
Surely I say unto you dudes,
I do not wish to fight.

531
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:09,181
So as soon as you apologize and make a
full reckoning of your transgressions,

532
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:12,809
I shall absolve you and continue
along the path of righteousness.

533
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:16,688
What are you talkin' about, man?

534
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,566
Straight up. You talk kind of
funny, you know what I mean?

535
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,653
I don't know if you've lost it all up in
here or what, but check this out, homie.

536
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,864
You want me and the homies
to apologize, right?

537
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:29,118
I'll tell you what. We'll apologize the
day a monkey comes out of my butt.

538
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,706
Then you get your "sorry."
How about that?

539
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:38,710
What a coincidence, because that's today.

540
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:57,579
Hey, did that monkey just
come out your crack, man?

541
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,655
This is some voodoo shit, man.

happy.

- They're a new breed.

Cross-pollination between

to rescue hundreds of people stranded by
a freak tidal wave that hit Kitamoto City.

- I made you grilled cheese.
- Ooh, my favey!

Ohh. I mean, do they look bigger to you?

Uh, what? Your, um, hmm? No. Uh...

599
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:26,618
- Bigger?
- Oh, come on! Look at them!

600
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:30,873
Please. They are definitely bigger.
I mean, look. They feel huge to me.

00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:33,709
Well, listen, I, uh, have to go,

602
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:38,130
but this has been the
breast bek... breast...

603
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,965
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?

604
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:44,344
To get my job back.

605
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:46,805
<i>"Yeah, yeah"</i>

606
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:51,476
<i>"I am great.
Yeah, yeah"</i>

607
00:46:51,602 --> 00:46:54,897
<i>"I am..."</i> Good grief.
Is that what I'm drivin'?

608
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:08,243
Whoa. Nice car, man.

609
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:11,664
Yeah. It gets me from "A" to "B."

610
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:27,304
Oh, darn. All this horsepower
and no room to gallop.

611
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,161
Heigh-ho, Silver, away!

612
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:45,197
I certainly wouldn't want to be
a fugitive on the run with Hank,

613
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,325
Buffalo's number-one
police dog on the job.

614
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:50,869
This is Phil Sidleman reporting from
the Police Canine Training Center,

615
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:53,038
Channel 5 News.

616
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:54,384
And cut it.

617
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:02,339
Hey, hey, hey!
Look what the cat coughed up!

618
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:05,183
Channel 7, right? You're
the guy that went crazy?

619
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:06,509
I had a bad moment.

620
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:10,013
- What are you doing here?
- Just looking for a story.

621
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:14,017
There's no story here.
This pond is all fished out.

622
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,187
- Standard stuff anyway.
- I don't know.

623
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:20,023
- My instinct tells me there's something more.
- Yeah? Well, go with that.

624
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:23,235
It served you well in the past, right?

625
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:32,277
Hey! Hank found something!

626
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:37,082
Hey, we got a body!
Over here!

627
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:40,002
Get the camera! Now!

628
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:44,423
- It's locked, and the keys are inside!
- I guess every dog has his day.

629
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,474
Hey, kid. You wanna
make 10 bucks?

630
00:48:46,499 --> 00:48:48,075
You know how to
use one of these things?

631
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:50,930
Duh.

632
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,932
Seems to be in tune. Let's do this.

633
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:56,860
The body of Jimmy Hoffa was
uncovered in a field today

634
00:48:56,944 --> 00:49:00,155
outside of a canine training
center in Buffalo, New York.

635
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:04,026
- Bruce Nolan was the first on the scene.
- Thank you, Jane.

636
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:07,237
As you can see behind us, the
body is being carefully exhumed...

637
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:09,781
and will be transported
to a medical facility,

638
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:11,950
where D.N.A. Testing
can confirm the identity.

639
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:14,911
That, however, merely a
formality at this point,

640
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:18,540
as in a bizarre twist, the body was
found buried with a birth certificate...

641
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:20,959
and complete set of dental records.

642
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:25,631
I'd call that a red-letter day for any K-9
unit, but was that enough for old Hank here?

643
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:29,468
No, sirree. Moments later, he
busted a local news camera crew...

644
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:33,221
With 220 pounds of marijuana.

645
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:36,369
I never saw it before, I
swear!

646
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:44,650
I'm Bruce Nolan, and that's
the way the cookie crumbles.

647
00:49:48,148 --> 00:49:50,892
Yeah! Did you like that?

648
00:49:52,535 --> 00:49:54,910
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

649
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:57,162
- Hi, Bruce.
- Oh, hi, Susan.

650
00:49:57,245 --> 00:50:00,308
Good work. I'm impressed.

651
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:07,297
- Jack, did you need me for something?
- Bruce! Bruce!

652
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:09,269
- Just the man I wanna see.
- Hey.

653
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:13,679
- Hoffa? What are the odds of that?
- What are the odds of that?

654
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:16,056
- Bruce, why don't you sit down?
- Okay.

655
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:19,810
I'm gonna be straight with
you. We want you back, Bruce.

656
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:23,438
But I want you to understand it
was not my decision to let you go.

657
00:50:23,522 --> 00:50:27,276
- When the big guy gives the order, you know...
- No harm, no foul, Jack.

658
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,529
I needed some time to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self.

659
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:33,156
- You did that in a day?
- Imagine what I could do with seven.

660
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,203
Look, Bruce. It is not in
my power to give you anchor.

661
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:41,206
Now, as far as field reporting
goes, if you're looking for a bump...

662
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:45,085
Jack, let's just cut the crap
and get down to brass tacks here.

663
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:49,673
I'm kidding
with you, and you...

664
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:55,095
I had you going, Jackie. Don't
even worry about it, my old friend.

665
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:59,266
You just give me a camera,
Jack; I'll give you the news.

666
00:51:06,523 --> 00:51:10,736
My secret is that I
let the jalapeños marinate...

667
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:16,617
in a spicy sauce for at least 24
hours before I stir it into the chili.

668
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,401
Then I let it all come to a
simmer b... Oh!

669
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:29,671
Hold that thought, Hazel! It seems as if
an asteroid or some kind of meteorite...

670
00:51:29,755 --> 00:51:34,043
has just hit ground right outside
the Mark Twain Chili Cook-Off.

671
00:51:34,226 --> 00:51:37,062
This should certainly
spice things up a bit.

672
00:51:37,346 --> 00:51:41,099
- His stories are all over town.
- From unearthing Jimmy Hoffa...

673
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,226
To a meteor crashing to earth...

674
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:46,647
Bruce Nolan is rapidly
becoming known as...

675
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,840
And that's the way the cookie crumbles!

676
00:52:09,374 --> 00:52:11,322
- Was this Bruce's idea?
- Uh-huh.

677
00:52:11,964 --> 00:52:16,301
He said he wanted me to have a day
of beauty and luxurious serenity.

678
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,806
I gotta tell you. He is really impressing me lately.

679
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:23,934
You know where he's taking
me to dinner tonight?

680
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,229
Hmm. Where?

681
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:32,192
- The Blue Palm?
- Mm-hmm.

682
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:35,362
- Oh, my gosh. I just got chills.
- I know.

683
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:39,324
And he told me to prepare for the most
memorable night of our entire lives.

684
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:42,119
Oh, my gosh. Grace, he's gonna propose.

685
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,997
Oh, stop it. No. Really?

686
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,375
Yeah. Really. Come on. You do the math.

687
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,043
He sends you all day
to a beauty spa.

688
00:52:50,068 --> 00:52:52,245
He's taking you to the most
romantic restaurant in town,

689
00:52:52,304 --> 00:52:54,515
where you had your first date.

690
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,302
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but Bruce is right. This is your big night.

691
00:52:58,385 --> 00:53:00,846
- Relax and enjoy it.
- Oh, God.

692
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:03,432
Ow. Wow.

693
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:09,813
<i>Welcome to Eyewitness
News at 6:00 with Susan Ortega,</i>

<i>Evan Baxter, Fred Donohue...

695

number-one news team.</i>

696
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:20,032
Good evening, and welcome to Eyewitness
News at 6:00. I'm Susan Ortega.

697
00:53:20,115 --> 00:53:22,534
And I'm Evan Baxter, and
here's what's making news.

698
00:53:22,618 --> 00:53:26,608
A potential scandal with the
Buffalo P.D. surfaced today...

699
00:53:26,608 --> 00:53:29,225
when the mayor...

700
00:53:38,008 --> 00:53:41,595
- I'm sorry. I'm seem to have something stuck in my...
- Somebody get him some water, please.

701
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:44,348
Looks like my new co-anchor
may need a glass of water.

702
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,730
Oh. There we go.
Sorry about that.

703
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:56,985
In other news, the prime minister
of Sweden visited Washington today,

704
00:53:57,069 --> 00:54:00,939
and my tiny little
nipples went to France.

705
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,283
What did he just say?
Check the prompter.

706
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:07,736
The prompter's fine.

707
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:11,608
Evan, read the copy, please.
The copy's good. Just read it.

708
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:15,796
The White House reception committee
greeted the prime rib roast minister,

709
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:19,466
and I do the cha-cha like a sissy girl.

710
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:25,430
I "lika" do the cha-cha.

711
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:34,189
I'm sorry. We seem to be having
some technical difficulties.

712
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:35,834
In other news...

713
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:40,737
My apologies.

714
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:07,366
- May I?
- Certainly.

715
00:56:13,062 --> 00:56:15,999
It's perfect. She'll love it.

716
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,445
You know, uh...

717
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:26,927
I was gonna, uh... I was gonna
wait until after the meal,

718
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,346
but i think it's gonna burst out of me
like an alien if I don't do it now.

719
00:56:30,347 --> 00:56:33,476
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Okay.

720
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:36,186
This is it, isn't it?

721
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:39,189
I don't know. I don't
know if I'm ready for this.

722
00:56:39,231 --> 00:56:41,650
I mean, I'm ready for this.
I just don't know if I would...

723
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:44,194
I didn't think I would
have... I'm sorry. Go on.

724
00:56:44,278 --> 00:56:46,238
I didn't know this was
so important to you.

725
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:49,032
Me neither. Me neither.

726
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:50,674
Oh.

727
00:56:51,952 --> 00:56:54,454
- Grace.
- Yes?

728
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,832
- Grace.
- Yes?

729
00:57:01,837 --> 00:57:04,423
I got anchor.

730
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:08,760
Yes.

731
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:11,847
Apparently, it wasn't
working out with Evan,

732
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:16,727
so he's gonna finish out the
week, and I go live on Monday.

733
00:57:18,228 --> 00:57:22,131
- That's great, honey. That's great.
- I know. I know.

734
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:24,443
Wow.

735
00:57:25,861 --> 00:57:27,779
So that's what this is all about?

736
00:57:27,863 --> 00:57:30,949
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

737
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:33,785
Grace, we got anchor. Jack's
throwing me a party Friday night...

738
00:57:33,827 --> 00:57:36,163
at the Vanderbilt estate to celebrate.

739
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:38,457
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

740
00:57:38,999 --> 00:57:41,460
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep.</i>

741
00:57:41,543 --> 00:57:44,087
Oh, I feel so stupid. I feel stupid.

742
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:46,298
Wow, it is kinda loud in here, isn't it?

743
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:49,885
- No, it's not loud.
- Geez, keep it down to a dull roar?

744
00:57:49,968 --> 00:57:51,887
- What are you...
- Thank you.

745
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,723
Is that supposed to be funny?
'Cause that is not funny.

746
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:56,767
What are you saying?

747
00:57:56,808 --> 00:58:00,690
What is wrong with you?
Stop yelling!

748
00:58:00,854 --> 00:58:02,731
Uh, would you excuse me?

749
00:58:02,814 --> 00:58:07,277
I think I'll take a little trip to
the, um...

750
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:10,238
The wine is
going right through me.

751
00:58:10,322 --> 00:58:13,158
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

752
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,744
- Keep going, Tony! You're great!
- Oh, God.

753
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:22,125
What is going on here? Oh, what is this?

754
00:58:22,209 --> 00:58:24,252
Give me a break!

755
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:31,969
Really something, isn't it?

756
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:36,014
Is this heaven?

757
00:58:36,098 --> 00:58:38,642
No, this is Mount Everest.

758
00:58:38,684 --> 00:58:41,937
You should flip on the Discovery
Channel from time to time.

759
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,941
But I guess you can't
now, being dead and all.

760
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:48,251
I'm dead?

761
00:58:48,252 --> 00:58:50,212
Nah, I'm just messin' with ya.

762
00:58:50,237 --> 00:58:53,240
That's not funny, man.
That is not funny!

763
00:58:53,323 --> 00:58:54,950
Okay.

764
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:57,286
And what about the voices in my head?

765
00:58:57,369 --> 00:59:00,455
- Is that part of the hilarity?
- No, those are prayers.

766
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:03,542
And you keep ignoring them, they're
gonna build up on you like that.

767
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,420
But it's just noise.
I can't understand them.

768
00:59:06,503 --> 00:59:08,588
Well, you're not listening, son.

769
00:59:09,899 --> 00:59:11,817
Let's see.

770
00:59:12,301 --> 00:59:14,845
You've had my powers for
a little over a week now.

771
00:59:14,886 --> 00:59:17,472
How many people have you helped?

772
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:25,981
I took care of a few things. I righted a
few wrongs in my own life first, okay?

773
00:59:26,064 --> 00:59:28,025
I was gonna help the others.

774
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:30,221
I think I could help the world.

775
00:59:30,246 --> 00:59:31,636
- The world?
- Mm-hmm.

776
00:59:31,695 --> 00:59:33,614
That wasn't the world.

777
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:36,908
That was just Buffalo between
57th Street and Commonwealth.

778
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:39,870
Oh.

779
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:42,664
I didn't want to start you off
with more than you could handle.

780
00:59:42,748 --> 00:59:47,836
Well, you took the job, Bruce,
so I suggest you get to it.

781
00:59:51,256 --> 00:59:53,884
Prayers, prayers. Okay, prayers. Oh!

782
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:57,054
This creepy whisper
thing has to end.

783
00:59:57,137 --> 00:59:59,181
Organization and
management is what I need.

784
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:01,892
I need a system.
Something concrete.

785
01:00:01,975 --> 01:00:04,561
Concentrate!

786
01:00:04,645 --> 01:00:06,605
Files.

787
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:09,733
Let all prayers be organized into files.

788
01:00:13,779 --> 01:00:15,697
Well, that takes care of the voices.

789
01:00:15,781 --> 01:00:18,909
Not exactly a space saver though.

790
01:00:18,992 --> 01:00:21,286
Grace might notice.

791
01:00:21,328 --> 01:00:24,081
I know. Prayer Post-Its!

792
01:00:38,637 --> 01:00:42,766
Okay, I need something with a lock,
security, combination, a password.

793
01:00:44,518 --> 01:00:46,478
A password.

794
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:51,776
You've got prayers.

795
01:00:52,818 --> 01:00:56,029
Welcome to the revelation superhighway.

796
01:00:56,113 --> 01:00:59,366
We bless. No mess. Downloading now.

797
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,413
It's good. It's good.

798
01:01:07,165 --> 01:01:10,294
This is gonna take a while.

799
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,469
1,527,503 prayer requests?

800
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:24,641
I'd better manifest some coffee.

801
01:01:27,405 --> 01:01:29,813
Hola! Juan Valdez.

802
01:01:30,856 --> 01:01:32,774
- Buenos días.
- Buenos días.

803
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:35,694
- Disfrute de un buen café!
- Gracias, senor.

804
01:01:35,736 --> 01:01:37,113
Adios.

805
01:01:37,738 --> 01:01:39,488
Adios!

806
01:01:43,035 --> 01:01:48,332
Ah! Now, that's fresh mountain-grown
coffee from the hills of Colombia.

807
01:02:10,232 --> 01:02:11,294
It's good.

808
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:12,980
It's good!

809
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:21,198
Okay, I had to have made some
kind of a dent by now.

810
01:02:22,768 --> 01:02:24,449
Oh, come on!

811
01:02:26,745 --> 01:02:30,290
What a bunch of whiners. This
is gonna suck up my whole life.

812
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,585
You know what?

813
01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:39,216
Yes, to all!

814
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:41,760
Yeah, there ya go.

815
01:02:41,802 --> 01:02:43,762
Now everybody's happy.

816
01:02:52,145 --> 01:02:56,149
I'll drink to that. My tech
stocks tripled in five days.

817
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:57,922
You know something, Joe?

818
01:02:57,947 --> 01:02:59,569
- You seem taller.
- I am.

819
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:01,488
My daughter pitched a no-hitter.

820
01:03:01,571 --> 01:03:04,366
I lost 47 pounds on
the Krispy Kreme diet.

821
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:07,703
Hey, there he is, the man of the hour!

822
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:11,540
Bless you. Bless all of you.

823
01:03:11,623 --> 01:03:16,461
Be fruitful and do long
division or something.

824
01:03:16,503 --> 01:03:18,839
Hey, try that. It's an excellent year.

825
01:03:18,922 --> 01:03:21,800
Hey, Bruce. Who do you like
in the game tonight?

826
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:24,962
I like the Sabres.
Coach prays a lot.

827
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:48,794
<i>Hey, this is Bruce, Grace and Sam.
Leave a message.</i>

828
01:03:49,634 --> 01:03:50,696
<i>Grace, are you there?</i>

829
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:53,123
Hello. It's me.

830
01:03:53,165 --> 01:03:55,917
<i>Hello? Hello, hello,
hello, hello, hello.</i>

831
01:03:56,001 --> 01:03:59,212
<i>Come on, Grace. Come to the party.</i>

832
01:03:59,296 --> 01:04:01,548
<i>I'll call you later, okay?</i>

833
01:04:03,383 --> 01:04:05,677
Come on, Sam.

834
01:04:08,288 --> 01:04:09,848
Help me out here.

835
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:14,787
Oh, Sam, don't! Come on!

836
01:04:15,228 --> 01:04:17,731
<i>- Come on. Tell me.
- If I told you, it might not come true.</i>

837
01:04:17,814 --> 01:04:20,317
<i>What is it you want,
Mary? What do you want?</i>

838
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,986
<i>You... You want the moon?</i>

839
01:04:23,028 --> 01:04:25,656
<i>Just say the word, and I'll throw
a lasso around it and pull it down.</i>

840
01:04:26,198 --> 01:04:28,325
<i>Hey, that's a pretty good idea.</i>

841
01:04:28,408 --> 01:04:30,702
<i>- I'll give you the moon, Mary.
- I'll take it.</i>

842
01:04:31,964 --> 01:04:32,988
<i>Then what?</i>

843
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:37,334
<i>Well, then you could swallow
it, and it'll all dissolve, see?</i>

844
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:40,420
<i>The moonbeams would shoot out of
your fingers and your toes...</i>

845
01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:42,089
<i>And the ends of your hair.</i>

846
01:04:54,226 --> 01:04:56,687
<i>Hey, this is Bruce, Grace and Sam...</i>

847
01:04:58,063 --> 01:05:00,065
Hi, Bruce.

848
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:04,695
What are you doing in here all alone?

849
01:05:04,736 --> 01:05:08,740
Oh, I was just gonna...
Oh, uh, I mean...

850
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:13,870
I was gonna, uh, give Grace a call.

851
01:05:13,954 --> 01:05:18,709
Yeah, I didn't see her in there.
So, how are you and Grace doing?

852
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,878
Well, actually, we
had a-a bit of a fight.

853
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,923
Kind of... I'm not
sure if she's...

854
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:27,551
- You're on fire, Bruce.
- Hmm?

855
01:05:27,634 --> 01:05:30,721
Some women can't handle the fire.

856
01:05:30,762 --> 01:05:33,598
Some can.

857
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,184
That's interesting, 'cause,
you know, I never thought...

858
01:05:36,226 --> 01:05:38,645
we would ever talk.

859
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:49,613
Grace!

860
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:53,717
Aah!

861
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:01,249
You might wanna stop touching me.
Now is not a good time.

862
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,802
Grace!

863
01:06:03,462 --> 01:06:07,382
Grace! Grace, come here!

864
01:06:07,466 --> 01:06:10,427
Grace, this is so weird.
I was just calling you.

865
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:13,680
Oh, yeah. What? And you thought,
like, Susan's mouth was the phone?

866
01:06:13,805 --> 01:06:17,233
I... She kissed me. I didn't...
I'm the "kissee" Grace...

867
01:06:17,233 --> 01:06:18,894
Oh, please. Yeah, you were
putting up a really big fight.

868
01:06:18,977 --> 01:06:21,855
I tried to fight her off. I tried
to stop her, but she's really strong.

869
01:06:21,939 --> 01:06:24,232
Okay, I screwed up.
Can I make it up to you?

870
01:06:24,316 --> 01:06:27,444
Yeah! Why don't you,
uh, get me a boat, Bruce.

871
01:06:27,486 --> 01:06:29,114
- What?
- Yeah, a big boat.

872
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:32,982
And then maybe two big bags of
cash. Then... Then I'll be happy.

873
01:06:32,991 --> 01:06:35,118
Lots of money and lots of stuff.

874
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,621
Other people want idiotic
crap like getting married...

875
01:06:37,663 --> 01:06:40,248
or having babies with the man
that they've loved for five years.

876
01:06:40,332 --> 01:06:43,543
But not me, Bruce.
Just gimme the boat.

877
01:06:43,627 --> 01:06:45,587
No wonder you stayed single!

878
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:48,632
- Oh! Grace, don't do this!
- I'm not doing this.

879
01:06:48,715 --> 01:06:50,926
I'm undoing it.
I'll be at Debbie's.

880
01:06:51,009 --> 01:06:53,095
You take care of Sam until
I can make arrangements.

881
01:06:56,139 --> 01:06:59,601
You can't leave me.

882
01:06:59,685 --> 01:07:01,561
I'm the Alpha, lady!

883
01:07:01,645 --> 01:07:04,898
I'm the Omega, baby!

884
01:07:04,982 --> 01:07:07,359
Okay, fine. I don't need you.

885
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:18,495
What's the matter, Bruce?
She can't handle a little competition?

886
01:07:19,621 --> 01:07:21,999
The game's been called
on account of rain.

887
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:40,058
<i>An unusually high number
of lottery winners...</i>

888
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,060
<i>has New York officials concerned.</i>

889
01:07:42,102 --> 01:07:44,855
<i>So far, 1,100 winning tickets
have been turned in,</i>

890
01:07:44,938 --> 01:07:47,217
<i>all strangely from the Buffalo area.</i>

891
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,153
<i>More on this story as it develops.</i>

892
01:07:52,418 --> 01:07:53,822
Enjoying your party?

893
01:07:53,905 --> 01:07:56,825
Nothing like spending quality
time with great friends, huh?

894
01:07:59,087 --> 01:08:01,163
Grace left me.

895
01:08:01,747 --> 01:08:03,665
Yeah, I know.

896
01:08:03,707 --> 01:08:06,126
She'll take me back.

897
01:08:07,919 --> 01:08:09,880
She'll take me back, right?

898
01:08:09,921 --> 01:08:12,233
Would you take you back?

899
01:08:17,929 --> 01:08:20,682
How do you make somebody love
you without affecting free will?

900
01:08:22,226 --> 01:08:24,394
Welcome to my world, son.

901
01:08:24,478 --> 01:08:27,522
You come up with an answer
to that one, you let me know.

902
01:08:37,157 --> 01:08:39,675
<i>Rise and shine, Buffalo.</i>

903
01:08:39,676 --> 01:08:43,622
<i>It's 70 and sunny, and the
perfect day to forgive Bruce.</i>

904

Bye.

- Have fun, you got it.

906
01:09:21,356 --> 01:09:22,302
Hi.

907
01:09:22,286 --> 01:09:25,038
- Can I get a small coffee to go?
- Sure, hon. Just a sec.

Oh, no, no, no. Honey, no, no. Oh, gosh,
please don't put that in your mouth.

917
01:10:27,601 --> 01:10:29,686
You don't eat that. Oh, that's not food.

918
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:32,230
Go to the bathroom,
please. Wash out your mouth.

Wash off your hands.

923
01:10:44,525 --> 01:10:45,525
Hi.

924
01:10:47,037 --> 01:10:50,540
I surrender! I surrender! I surrender.

- Hi.
- Hi.

926
01:11:00,425 --> 01:11:03,512
I'm, uh, doing my first anchor tonight.

927
01:11:03,595 --> 01:11:06,515
Oh, wow! That's great!

928
01:11:06,598 --> 01:11:08,338
- So how have you been doing?
- Good.

929
01:11:08,339 --> 01:11:10,907
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Good.

930
01:11:10,931 --> 01:11:13,254
Just, um... Debbie won the lottery.

931
01:11:13,355 --> 01:11:15,190
Oh, yeah? You're kidding.

932
01:11:15,274 --> 01:11:20,404
But I guess so did 400,000 other
people, so she only won, like, $17.

933
01:11:24,116 --> 01:11:26,618
I miss you.

934
01:11:28,954 --> 01:11:31,039
Okay.

935
01:11:31,123 --> 01:11:33,792
I took the first step.
Jumped out on the ledge.

936
01:11:36,461 --> 01:11:39,464
- Feeling pretty vulnerable too.
- I don't know what you want me to say.

937
01:11:39,506 --> 01:11:42,259
- Just say you love me and you want me back.
- No, Bruce.

938
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:44,594
Come on. What about all the signs?

939
01:11:44,636 --> 01:11:48,724
How did you know about that?
Did you talk to Debbie?

940
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:52,269
Look, would it help if I just
said that I was a complete ass?

941
01:11:52,311 --> 01:11:55,939
- Hey, you said "ass."
- Yeah, but it's okay if I'm talking about a donkey.

942
01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:59,151
- I didn't say "hole." If I said "ass"...
- Wait! Wait!

943
01:11:59,234 --> 01:12:01,361
Okay, you know what, honey?
Let's go. Let's go inside.

944
01:12:01,445 --> 01:12:04,573
All right, kids. Everybody
inside. Time to go inside.

945
01:12:04,656 --> 01:12:07,409
Grace, please...

946
01:12:07,492 --> 01:12:09,620
none of this seems right without you.

947
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:15,959
Yeah, I gotta go.

948
01:12:16,043 --> 01:12:18,003
Wait!

949
01:12:19,755 --> 01:12:21,673
Uh...

950
01:12:23,842 --> 01:12:25,761
How do you feel now?

951
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:32,142
Have you completely lost your mind?

952
01:12:32,225 --> 01:12:35,646
- What? Are you drunk?
- Yeah, I'm drunk. Drunk with power.

953
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:44,029
Love me. Love me.

954
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,951
Love me. Love me!

955
01:12:50,035 --> 01:12:51,995
I did.

956
01:13:04,257 --> 01:13:06,929
Yeah, I know... free will.

957
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,513
<i>More power outages reported today...</i>

958
01:13:09,554 --> 01:13:12,182
<i>caused by last week's meteorite strike.</i>

959

week's strange celestial events...</i>

964
01:13:28,991 --> 01:13:32,119
<i>as signs that prophesy
is now being fulfilled...</i>

965
01:13:32,244 --> 01:13:34,871
<i>and the world as we know
it may be coming to an end.</i>

966
01:13:36,305 --> 01:13:37,541
The world's gone mad.

967
01:13:37,582 --> 01:13:39,668
- Bruce, 30 seconds to air.
- Okay. Okay.

968
01:13:39,751 --> 01:13:42,796
There you are. It's your big
debut. How are you feeling?

969
01:13:42,879 --> 01:13:46,258
You know what? Fine. Never better.

970
01:13:46,341 --> 01:13:49,845
Show must go on, right?

971
01:13:51,763 --> 01:13:54,792
The Sabres just won the Stanley Cup.
- You're kidding me!

972
01:13:55,475 --> 01:13:58,729
Was that tonight?
That's great, isn't it?

973
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:00,231
- It's getting pretty crazy out there.
- Uh-huh.

974
01:14:00,305 --> 01:14:04,159
- We're gonna kick live to Fred at the stadium, okay?
- Five seconds to the open.

975
01:14:04,443 --> 01:14:07,904
- This is it. You ready?
- Born that way.

983

Ever since that damn meteorite hit.

984
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:33,889
It's okay. We're back up.

We apologize for the interruption.
And now back to the news. Bruce.

986
01:14:37,476 --> 01:14:41,438
- Thank you, Susan.
- I'm sorry. We're going live to H.S.B.C. Arena,

987

- Great.
- Fred?

989
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:48,654
We're about to uncork
some champagne because...

990
01:14:48,737 --> 01:14:53,283
the Sabres have won their
first championship in 22 years!

991
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,621
What in the blue blazes...

992
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:02,209
We'll be back with the Sabres' Stanley
Cup victory in just a hot second.

993

01:15:13,387 --> 01:15:17,240
the Gaza Strip today, as
Israelis and Palestinians...

998

- Bruce.
- What?!

999
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,138
We've got a situation here.

1000
01:15:20,143 --> 01:15:23,397
- They're rioting right outside the station.
- You're kidding.

1001

01:15:33,282 --> 01:15:36,994
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this just in.

1004
01:15:37,077 --> 01:15:39,371
Possibly...

1005
01:15:39,454 --> 01:15:43,750
the biggest breaking news
story this town has ever seen.

1006
01:15:50,048 --> 01:15:51,967
And I gotta go.

1007
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:54,611
I'm sorry, Jack.

1008
01:15:55,429 --> 01:15:57,306
Susan, it's all yours.

1009

Repent! The end is near! Repent!

1010
01:16:16,867 --> 01:16:19,286
Come back with my bubble gum machine!

1011
01:16:19,301 --> 01:16:20,655
Come back here!

1012
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:26,877
The lottery sucks!

1013
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,922
I only won 17 bucks!

1014
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:33,675
Channel 7 fries!

1015
01:16:33,759 --> 01:16:36,511
Oh! Oh, no!

1016
01:16:54,029 --> 01:16:56,123
God?

1017
01:16:56,907 --> 01:16:58,825
Are you here?

1018
01:17:00,994 --> 01:17:04,373
Hello? I need your help.

1019
01:17:04,456 --> 01:17:07,709
Clap on. Clap on.

1020
01:17:07,793 --> 01:17:12,547
Clap on! Clap on! Clap on!

1021
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:17,594
Figures!

1022
01:17:20,472 --> 01:17:23,433
Well, hello there, Bruce Almighty.

1023
01:17:26,645 --> 01:17:28,855
Not as easy as it looks, is it, son?

1024
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:32,276
- This God business.
- They're all out of control.

1025
01:17:33,986 --> 01:17:36,530
It's mayhem. I don't know what to do.

1026
01:17:36,613 --> 01:17:39,491
Well, you're right on time... 7:00.

1027
01:17:42,661 --> 01:17:45,289
The seventh at 7:00.

1028
01:17:59,428 --> 01:18:02,014
All righty then.

1029
01:18:03,849 --> 01:18:06,977
- There we are.
- It's good. It's good!

1030
01:18:08,993 --> 01:18:10,739
It's a wonderful thing.

1031
01:18:11,023 --> 01:18:13,609
No matter how filthy something gets,

1032
01:18:13,692 --> 01:18:16,987
you can always clean it right up.

1033
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:20,073
There were so many, I just
gave them all what they wanted.

1034
01:18:20,157 --> 01:18:23,118
Yeah, but since when...

1035
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:26,872
does anyone have a clue
about what they want?

1036
01:18:28,749 --> 01:18:30,792
So what do I do?

1037
01:18:34,254 --> 01:18:37,841
Parting your soup is not a miracle, Bruce.
It's a magic trick.

1038
01:18:39,343 --> 01:18:41,845
A single mom who's working two jobs...

1039
01:18:41,928 --> 01:18:46,099
and still finds time to take her kid
to soccer practice, that's a miracle.

1040
01:18:46,183 --> 01:18:50,354
A teenager who says 'no' to
drugs and 'yes' to an education,

1041
01:18:50,395 --> 01:18:52,356
that's a miracle.

1042
01:18:53,732 --> 01:18:55,651
People want me to do
everything for them.

1043
01:18:55,734 --> 01:18:59,947
But what they don't realize
is... They have the power.

1044
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:02,991
You wanna see a miracle, son?

1045
01:19:03,075 --> 01:19:06,411
Be the miracle.

1046
01:19:08,705 --> 01:19:11,375
Wait. Are you leaving?

1047
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:14,252
Yeah. I see that you
can handle things now.

1048
01:19:14,336 --> 01:19:17,255
But what if I need you.
What if I have questions?

1049
01:19:17,339 --> 01:19:21,843
That's your problem, Bruce.
That's everybody's problem.

1050
01:19:21,927 --> 01:19:24,262
You keep looking up.

1051
01:19:27,849 --> 01:19:29,768
<i>Order has
been restored in Buffalo...</i>

1052

<i>after this evening's downtown riot.</i>

01:20:29,494 --> 01:20:31,423
Okay.

1057
01:20:32,664 --> 01:20:34,004
Well, thanks a million.

1058
01:20:34,051 --> 01:20:35,358
- Oh, not a problem.
- God bless.

1059
01:20:41,593 --> 01:20:42,756
Bruce giveth...

1060
01:20:43,432 --> 01:20:45,302
and Bruce taketh away.

1061
01:20:45,385 --> 01:20:49,342
If you don't like it, megabyte me.

1062
01:20:57,356 --> 01:21:00,359
- Evan.
- Bruce.

1063
01:21:02,402 --> 01:21:04,988
I suppose you're here to gloat
about the anchor position.

1064
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:07,158
Go ahead. Take your best shot.

1065
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:10,161
Well actually, I, uh...

1066
01:21:10,702 --> 01:21:13,997
I just came to tell you
that I've been a royal prick.

1067
01:21:14,122 --> 01:21:18,126
The anchor position is yours.
I turned down the job.

1068
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:21,546
Oh, and I never really
congratulated you in the first place.

1069
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:24,128
Congratulations.

1070
01:21:26,273 --> 01:21:28,387
Thanks, Bruce.

1071
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:31,431
<i>In the financial world, things
are settling back to normal...</i>

1072
01:21:31,515 --> 01:21:34,059
<i>in what analysts are calling
a fluke market fluctuation.</i>

1073
01:21:34,142 --> 01:21:37,562
- You made the right move, Jack.
- So what about you?

1074
01:21:37,604 --> 01:21:40,691
Are you ready to go back out there?

1075
01:21:40,732 --> 01:21:43,443
And do the cutesy stuff?
The lighter side of the news?

1076
01:21:43,527 --> 01:21:47,447
Lower and debase myself for the
amusement of total strangers?

1077
01:21:47,572 --> 01:21:50,075
Yeah, I could do that.
Sounds like fun.

1078
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,743
Good.

1079
01:21:52,186 --> 01:21:55,872
Okay, Sammy, let's do it
right, like all the other dogs.

1080
01:21:55,956 --> 01:21:58,375
I don't wanna make you feel bad,
but they're laughing at you, pal.

1081
01:21:58,473 --> 01:21:59,203
They're laughing at you.

1082
01:21:59,355 --> 01:22:03,672
Ok, come on. Concentrate. There you go.
Come on. Pump it out if you have to.

1083
01:22:03,755 --> 01:22:06,667
What am I gonna do with you?

1084
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,930
I know this seems kinda crazy,

1085
01:22:12,014 --> 01:22:14,266
but desperate times...

1086
01:22:14,349 --> 01:22:16,268
calls for desperate measures.

1087
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:18,091
Yeah. Ok.

1088
01:22:18,116 --> 01:22:22,107
Ok, Sammy. Do your thing.

1089
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:25,235
That's it. That's it. Good boy!

1090
01:22:26,486 --> 01:22:28,447
Training my dog.

1091
01:22:49,134 --> 01:22:52,262
Yes, we did it! We did it!

1092
01:22:52,304 --> 01:22:57,309
Bow-wow-wow Yippee-yo, yippee-yay
We're doin'it doggy style

1093
01:22:59,686 --> 01:23:01,438
I'll alert Penthouse Forum.

1094
01:23:01,521 --> 01:23:03,294
Hi, Deb. How are ya?

1095
01:23:05,008 --> 01:23:06,043
How's Grace?

1096
01:23:06,463 --> 01:23:09,096
I really didn't come to chat, okay,
Bruce? I came for Grace's stuff.

1097
01:23:15,052 --> 01:23:16,120
You need, uh...

1098
01:23:16,662 --> 01:23:19,790
No, it's okay. I've got it.

1099
01:23:25,545 --> 01:23:27,589
I don't, uh... I don't know if she...

1100
01:23:27,673 --> 01:23:29,925
I don't know if she wants that or not.

1101
01:23:33,804 --> 01:23:37,265
This is full. You did all this?

1102
01:23:48,193 --> 01:23:51,613
You know what I do every night
before I go to bed? I tuck my kids in,

1103
01:23:51,697 --> 01:23:54,491
maybe have a scoop of
ice cream and watch Conan.

1104
01:23:56,034 --> 01:23:58,154
You know what Grace does?

1105
01:23:59,037 --> 01:24:01,164
She prays.

1106
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:04,668
Most of the time for you.

1107
01:24:26,523 --> 01:24:30,068
Find Grace Connelly.

1108
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:35,282
The woman does pray a lot.

1109
01:24:36,742 --> 01:24:40,203
Find Grace, then Bruce.

1110
01:24:40,329 --> 01:24:43,332
"Dear God,
please help Bruce find himself,

1111
01:24:43,415 --> 01:24:45,417
"find contentment, find you."

1112
01:24:45,459 --> 01:24:48,920
"Dear God, please help Bruce.
He seems to be struggling."

1113
01:24:48,962 --> 01:24:51,048
"Dear God, give Bruce strength."

1114
01:24:51,131 --> 01:24:53,091
"Dear God, bless Bruce."

1115
01:24:53,175 --> 01:24:56,094
"Bruce. Bruce. Bruce."

1116
01:24:57,804 --> 01:24:59,931
It's her.

1117
01:25:00,015 --> 01:25:03,769
Sammy, it's her. She's logging
on. She's praying right now.

1118
01:25:05,972 --> 01:25:06,997
Grace.

1119
01:25:10,943 --> 01:25:12,861
Please, God.

1120
01:25:14,404 --> 01:25:15,499
Please.

1121
01:25:16,045 --> 01:25:17,815
I still love him.

1122
01:25:20,145 --> 01:25:23,246
But I don't wanna love him anymore.

1123
01:25:23,288 --> 01:25:26,041
I don't wanna hurt anymore. Please.

1124
01:25:26,124 --> 01:25:28,043
Help me forget.

1125
01:25:29,252 --> 01:25:31,418
Please help me let him go.

1126
01:25:32,596 --> 01:25:34,693
Please help me let him go.

1127
01:25:56,138 --> 01:25:58,765
You win!

1128
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:00,067
I'm done!

1129
01:26:00,951 --> 01:26:04,439
Please, I don't wanna
do this anymore.

1130
01:26:05,622 --> 01:26:08,125
I don't wanna be God.

1131
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:11,412
I want you to decide
what's right for me.

1132
01:26:11,795 --> 01:26:14,824
I surrender to your will!

1133
01:26:44,941 --> 01:26:45,788
Am I...

1134
01:26:46,204 --> 01:26:50,626
You can't kneel down in the middle of a
highway and live to talk about it, son.

1135
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:52,570
But why?

1136
01:26:53,721 --> 01:26:55,071
Why now?

1137
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,408
Bruce...

1138
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:00,753
you have the divine spark.

1139
01:27:01,094 --> 01:27:06,183
You have the gift for bringing
joy and laughter to the world.

1140
01:27:06,224 --> 01:27:08,477
I know. I created you.

1141
01:27:09,853 --> 01:27:12,230
- Quit braggin'.
- See. That's...

1142
01:27:12,272 --> 01:27:14,483
That's what I'm talking about.

1143
01:27:14,566 --> 01:27:16,526
That's the spark.

1144
01:27:21,531 --> 01:27:23,434
What do you want me to do?

1145
01:27:24,544 --> 01:27:26,603
I want you to pray, son.

1146
01:27:26,787 --> 01:27:30,499
Go ahead. Use them.

1147
01:27:32,918 --> 01:27:34,920
Uhm...

1148
01:27:36,129 --> 01:27:38,882
Lord, feed the hungry.

1149
01:27:38,924 --> 01:27:42,678
And bring peace to...

1150
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:46,515
all of mankind.

1151
01:27:48,225 --> 01:27:50,519
- How's that?
- Great.

1152
01:27:50,602 --> 01:27:52,521
If you wanna be Miss America.

1153
01:27:53,919 --> 01:27:54,998
Now, come on.

1154
01:27:55,023 --> 01:27:57,484
What do you really care about?

1155
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:04,199
Grace.

1156
01:28:04,283 --> 01:28:08,412
Grace. You want her back?

1157
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:16,586
No.

1158
01:28:16,628 --> 01:28:19,589
I want her to be happy.

1159
01:28:21,133 --> 01:28:23,093
No matter what that means.

1160
01:28:23,135 --> 01:28:26,138
I want her to find someone...

1161
01:28:26,179 --> 01:28:30,684
who will treat her...
with all the love...

1162
01:28:32,019 --> 01:28:34,313
she deserved from me.

1163
01:28:36,565 --> 01:28:38,859
I want her to meet someone...

1164
01:28:43,905 --> 01:28:47,200
who will see her always...

1165
01:28:47,284 --> 01:28:49,494
as I do now...

1166
01:28:53,915 --> 01:28:56,251
through your eyes.

1167
01:28:56,335 --> 01:28:58,462
Now, that's a prayer.

1168
01:28:58,503 --> 01:29:00,547
Yeah?

1169
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,924
Yeah.

1170
01:29:03,008 --> 01:29:05,319
- It's good.
- It's good.

1171
01:29:05,844 --> 01:29:07,752
It's good!

1172
01:29:09,348 --> 01:29:12,309
I'm gonna get right on it.

1173
01:29:12,351 --> 01:29:14,111
- Clear!
- Whoa!

1174
01:29:14,243 --> 01:29:16,013
- That didn't feel very good.
- Clear!

1175
01:29:17,844 --> 01:29:19,399
Got a rhythm.

1176
01:29:19,483 --> 01:29:21,610
- All right. I got a pulse.
- All right. Let's set him up.

1177
01:29:21,693 --> 01:29:23,612
Yeah. Get the backboard and brace.

1178
01:29:27,991 --> 01:29:32,162
Bruce? Bruce?

1179
01:29:34,414 --> 01:29:36,583
Welcome back.

1180
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:38,752
You're lucky to be alive, son.

1181
01:29:38,877 --> 01:29:41,296
Someone up there must like you.

1182
01:29:56,228 --> 01:29:59,147
I hear all that stuff winds
up in a warehouse somewhere.

1183
01:30:02,234 --> 01:30:04,569
Grace.

1184
01:30:06,405 --> 01:30:08,407
Hi, baby.

1185
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:14,162
Oh. Oh, my God, look at you.

1186
01:30:14,246 --> 01:30:17,708
- I was such an idiot.
- It's okay.

1187
01:30:17,749 --> 01:30:19,335
It's okay.

1188
01:30:19,918 --> 01:30:21,537
It's okay.

1189
01:30:24,881 --> 01:30:27,884
I don't know what I would have done.

1190
01:30:27,926 --> 01:30:30,095
Oh, God.

1191
01:30:30,178 --> 01:30:33,348
I swear I wanted to
be mad at you forever.

1192
01:30:45,193 --> 01:30:47,446
Now you're just showing off.

1193
01:30:58,665 --> 01:31:02,753
This is Bruce Nolan here at Buffalo's
First-Annual "Be the Miracle" Blood Drive.

1194
01:31:02,794 --> 01:31:06,548
It's a B-E-A-utiful day,
so come on down here.

1195
01:31:06,632 --> 01:31:08,550
Because the life you save could be mine.

1196
01:31:08,634 --> 01:31:10,552
- Ha, ha.
- Let's go over here,

1197
01:31:10,636 --> 01:31:14,431
where the Kowolskis have baked a very
special cookie just for this occasion.

1198
01:31:14,514 --> 01:31:17,559
Sure, it's a little creepy and a
shameless plug, but we love 'em.

1199
01:31:17,643 --> 01:31:20,504
Thank you, Mama.
Vol, finger... nose.

1200
01:31:22,356 --> 01:31:24,733
I, myself, will have given
blood twice this week.

1201
01:31:24,816 --> 01:31:26,944
For those of you who haven't heard,

1202
01:31:27,027 --> 01:31:31,531
I'd like to introduce you to the
future Mrs. Exclusive... Grace Connelly.

1203
01:31:32,563 --> 01:31:33,676
There she is.

1204
01:31:33,859 --> 01:31:35,583
Look at her!

1205
01:31:35,785 --> 01:31:38,104
Isn't she beautiful?

1206
01:31:38,664 --> 01:31:42,501
She just gave blood, and she still
has enough left to fill up her face.

1207
01:31:42,584 --> 01:31:46,546
Yes, behind every great man, there's
a woman rolling her eyes, folks.

1208
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:48,448
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News,

1209
01:31:48,474 --> 01:31:51,310
with all the folks down here at
the blood drive, reminding you to...

1210
01:31:51,593 --> 01:31:53,595
<i>Be the miracle!</i>

1211
01:31:55,097 --> 01:31:57,015
You heard 'em.

1212
01:31:57,099 --> 01:31:59,226
Okay, cut it. Thank you, Bruce.

1213
01:31:59,309 --> 01:32:00,647
Thanks, Ally.

1214
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:02,586
Hey.

1215
01:32:03,297 --> 01:32:05,434
- How was that?
- That was great.

1216
01:32:05,602 --> 01:32:08,318
That was really great. Now, you
still have to go over there.

1217
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,445
- The nurse is waiting.
- Oh, do I have to?

1218
01:32:10,529 --> 01:32:14,324
Oh, it's not gonna hurt. In fact, I
think you'll find it quite pleasurable.

1219
01:32:14,408 --> 01:32:16,952
Ooh, baby.

1220
01:33:13,759 --> 01:33:16,261
Who can take a rainbow,

1221
01:33:16,345 --> 01:33:18,847
wrap it in a sigh?

1222
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:24,269
"Soak it in the sun and
make a groovy lemon pie"

1223
01:33:24,353 --> 01:33:28,440
- Oompah.
- Loompah.

1224
01:33:28,565 --> 01:33:31,068
Doompah.
Oh, geez.

1225
01:33:34,033 --> 01:33:35,113
I'm sorry.

1226
01:33:35,155 --> 01:33:38,241
I'm a very rare blood
type. I'm A.B.-Positive.

1227
01:33:38,325 --> 01:33:40,702
Hmm. Sounds delicious.

1228
01:33:44,831 --> 01:33:47,668
Yeah, well, there, you know, there
are storehouses all over the world.

1229
01:33:47,751 --> 01:33:50,754
You know, all over the...
with... with tons of stuff on ice.

1230
01:33:50,837 --> 01:33:53,507
- And it's... Sorry.
- You're like this.

1231
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:56,593
Sorry. Go on. Okay.

1232
01:33:56,677 --> 01:33:59,221
Positive. I.B.-Positive.
Okay, sorry.

1233
01:33:59,304 --> 01:34:02,265
- I have a "rarey"...
- Oh!

1234
01:34:02,349 --> 01:34:05,185
She has a "rarey." Okay.

1235
01:34:05,269 --> 01:34:07,646
Well, they need my blood.
I have a very rare blood type.

1236
01:34:07,729 --> 01:34:10,440
- I'm A.B.-Negative.
- I'm I.B.-Positive.

1237
01:34:10,524 --> 01:34:13,777
- Am I A.B.-Negative or am I...
- I don't know what you are anymore.

1238
01:34:13,819 --> 01:34:17,030
I'm gonna need a frickin'
miracle to get to work on time.

1239
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:31,628
Shit.

1240
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:36,451
Shit!

1241
01:34:40,262 --> 01:34:42,180
That won't work.
