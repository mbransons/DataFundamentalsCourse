1
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,078
<i>There was me.</i>

2
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,114
<i>That is, Alex,</i>
<i>and my three droogs.</i>

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,875
<i>That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.</i>

4
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,676
<i>And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,</i>
<i>trying to make up our rassoodocks...</i>

5
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,070
<i>... what to do with the evening.</i>

6
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,678
<i>The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.</i>

7
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,390
<i>Milk plus vellocet or</i>
<i>synthemesc or drencrom...</i>

8
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,551
<i>... which is what we were drinking.</i>

9
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,399
<i>This would sharpen you up...</i>

10
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,394
<i>... and make you ready for a bit</i>
<i>of the old ultra-violence.</i>

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,956
<i>In Dublin 's fair city</i>

12
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,559
<i>Where the girls are so pretty</i>

13
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,512
<i>I first set my eyes</i>

14
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,996
<i>On sweet Molly Malone</i>

15
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,551
<i>As she wheeled her wheelbarrow</i>

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,998
<i>Through streets broad and narrow</i>

17
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,518
<i>Crying, "Cockles and mussels..."</i>

18
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,391
<i>One thing I could never stand...</i>

19
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,949
<i>... was to see a filthy,</i>
<i>dirty old drunkie...</i>

20
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
<i>... howling away at the</i>
<i>filthy songs of his fathers...</i>

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,230
<i>... and going "blerp blerp"</i>
<i>in between...</i>

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,553
<i>... as it might be a filthy old</i>
<i>orchestra in his stinking guts.</i>

23
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,236
<i>I could never stand to see anyone</i>
<i>like that, whatever his age.</i>

24
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,517
<i>But more especially when he</i>
<i>was real old, like this one was.</i>

25
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,719
Can you spare some cutter,
me brothers?

26
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,629
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to live anyway.

27
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,599
Not in a stinking world
like this.

28
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,277
And what's so stinking about it?

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,593
It's a stinking world because
there's no law and order anymore!

30
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,798
It stinks because it lets
the young get onto the old...

31
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,996
...like you done!

32
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,870
It's no world
for an old man any longer.

33
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,716
What kind of a world is it
at all?

34
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,757
Men on the moon.

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,389
Men spinning around the earth.

36
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,552
And there's not no
attention paid...

37
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,150
...to earthly
law and order no more.

38
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,988
<i>Oh, dear land</i>

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,590
<i>I fought for thee</i>

40
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,029
<i>It was at the derelict casino</i>
<i>that we came across Billy-boy...</i>

41
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,236
<i>... and his four droogs.</i>

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,869
<i>They were about to perform</i>
<i>a little of the old...</i>

43
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,908
<i>... in-out, in-out on a weepy</i>
<i>young devotchka they had there.</i>

44
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,753
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking...

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,118
...billy goat
Billy-boy in poison.

46
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,478
How are thou...

47
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,349
...thou globby bottle of cheap,
stinking chip-oil?

48
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,508
Come and get one in the yarbles...

49
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,557
...if you have any yarbles...

50
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,678
...you eunuch jelly, thou.

51
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,592
Let's get them, boys!

52
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,633
The police!

53
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,792
Come on. Let's go!

54
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,237
<i>The Durango 95 purred away</i>
<i>real horrorshow.</i>

55
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,553
<i>A nice, warm vibratey feeling</i>
<i>all through your guttiwuts.</i>

56
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,837
<i>Soon it was trees and dark,</i>
<i>my brothers...</i>

57
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,514
<i>... with real country dark.</i>

58
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,917
<i>We fillied around with other</i>
<i>travelers of the night...</i>

59
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,390
<i>... playing Hogs of the Road.</i>

60
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,551
<i>Then we headed west.</i>

61
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,315
<i>What we were after now</i>
<i>was the old surprise visit.</i>

62
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,754
<i>That was a real kick...</i>

63
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,278
<i>... and good for laughs and</i>
<i>lashing of the old ultra-violent.</i>

64
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,631
Who on earth could that be?

65
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,873
I'll go and see.

66
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,792
Yes, who is it?

67
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,879
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!

68
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,993
My friend's bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone?

69
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,357
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

70
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,194
But, missus, it's a matter
of life and death!

71
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,668
Who is it, dear?

72
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,354
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.

73
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
He wants to use the telephone.

74
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,509
I suppose you better let him in.

75
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,232
Wait a minute, will you?

76
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,471
I'm sorry, but we don't usually
let strangers in...

77
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,877
What do you want from me?

78
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,119
Pete, check the rest
of the house. Dim...

79
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,950
<i>I'm singing in the rain</i>

80
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,791
<i>Just singing in the rain</i>

81
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,318
<i>What a glorious feeling</i>

82
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,633
<i>I'm happy again</i>

83
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,712
<i>I'm laughing at clouds</i>

84
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,119
<i>So dark up above</i>

85
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,993
<i>The sun 's in my heart</i>

86
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,112

87
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,830
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

88
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,511
<i>Everyone from the place</i>

89

<i>Come on with the rain</i>

90
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,996
<i>I've a smile on my face</i>

91
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,916
<i>I'll walk down the lane</i>

92
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,757
<i>With a happy refrain</i>

93
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,597
<i>And I'm singing</i>

94
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,599
<i>Just singing...</i>

95
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,795
<i>... in the rain</i>

96
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,239
Viddy well, little brother.

97
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,072
Viddy well.

98
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,275
<i>We were all feeling a bit</i>
<i>shagged and fagged and fashed...</i>

99
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,911
<i>... it having been an evening</i>
<i>of some small energy expenditure.</i>

100
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,915
<i>So we got rid of the auto and</i>
<i>stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.</i>

101
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,399
Hello, Lucy.

102
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,118
Had a busy night?

103
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,035
We've been working hard too.

104
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,072
Pardon me, Luce.

105
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,836
<i>There was some sophistos from</i>
<i>the TV studios around the corner...</i>

106
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,196
<i>... laughing and govoreeting.</i>

107
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,435
<i>The devotchka smeched away, not</i>
<i>caring about the wicked world one bit.</i>

108
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,431
<i>Then the disk on the stereo</i>
<i>twanged off and out.</i>

109
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,831
<i>And in the short silence</i>
<i>before the next one came on...</i>

110
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,117
<i>... she suddenly came</i>
<i>with a burst of singing.</i>

111
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,030
<i>And it was like, for a moment,</i>
<i>O my brothers...</i>

112
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,397
<i>... some great bird</i>
<i>had flown into the milk bar.</i>

113
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,757
<i>And I felt all the malenky</i>
<i>little hairs on my plott...</i>

114
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,797
<i>... standing endwise.</i>

115
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,073
<i>And the shivers crawling up</i>
<i>like slow, malenky lizards...</i>

116
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,878
<i>... and then down again.</i>

117
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,714
<i>Because I knew what she sang.</i>

118
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,236
<i>It was a bit from</i>
<i>the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.</i>

119
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,716
What did you do that for?

120
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,916
For being a bastard
with no manners.

121
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,790
Without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourself public-wise.

122
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,673
I don't like you should
do what you done.

123
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,396
And I'm not your brother no more
and wouldn't want to be.

124
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,994
Watch that.

125
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,875
Do watch that, if to continue
to be on live thou dost wish.

126
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,954
Yarbles!

127

Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!

128
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,789
I'll meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

129
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless.

130
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,793
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

131
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,596
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

132
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,518
Doobidoob.

133
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,557
A bit tired maybe.

134
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,312
Best not to say more.

135
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,995
Bedways is rightways now.

136
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,512
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

137
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,153
Right, right?

138

<i>It was like a bird</i>

147
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,830
<i>Or like silvery wine</i>

It's past eight, Alex.

Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

156
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,754
Leave us be,
and I'll try and sleep it off.

157
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,639
And then I'll be as right
as dodgers for this after.

158
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,518
But you've not been
to school all week, son.

159
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,875
Got to rest, Mum.

160
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,112
Got to get fit.

161
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,916
Otherwise, I'm liable
to miss a lot more school.

162
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,029
I'll put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meself now.

163
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,113
All right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.

164
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,272
He's not feeling too good
again this morning, Dad.

165
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,272
Yes. Yes, I heard.

166
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,159
You know what time he got in?

167
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,273
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.

168
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,273
I wonder...

169
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,559
...where exactly is it
he goes to work of evenings.

170
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,993
Like he says...

171
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,470
...it's mostly odd things he does.

172
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,835
Helping-like...

173
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,640
...here and there, as it might be.

174
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,471
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

175
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,551
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

176
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,554
Alex-boy!
Awake at last, yes?

177
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,038
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

178
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,236
She gave me the key.

179
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,036
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

180
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,113
Hence, not at school, yes?

181
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,477
A rather intolerable pain
in the head, brother sir.

182
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,756
It should be clear
by this afterlunch.

183
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,068
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

184
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,392
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, Alex-boy?

185
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,030
- Cup of the old chai, sir?
- No time, no time.

186
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,793
Sit, sit, sit!

187
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,959
To what do I owe
this extreme pleasure, sir?

188
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,795
Anything wrong, sir?

189
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,715
Wrong? Why should you
think of anything being wrong?

190
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,235
Have you been doing
something you shouldn't?

191
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,708
Just a manner of speech.

192
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,872
Yes, well, it's just a manner
of speech from your...

193
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,237
...post-corrective advisor to you
that you watch out, little Alex.

194
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,870
Because next time it's not
going to be the corrective school.

195
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,238
Next time it'll be the Barley place,
and all my work ruined.

196
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,198
If you've no respect
for yourself...

197
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,398
...you at least might have some
for me, who sweated over you.

198
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,553
A big, black mark, I tell you,
for every one we don't reclaim.

199
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,872
A confession of failure
for every one of you...

200
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,918
...who ends up in the stripy hole.

201
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,912
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

202
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,674
The millicents have nothing
on me, brother.

203
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,148
Sir, I mean.

204
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,834
Cut out this clever talk
about millicents.

205
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,196
Just because the police
haven't picked you up...

206
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,512
...doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

207
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,675
There was a bit of nastiness last night.
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?

208
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,913
A few of a certain Billy-boy's
friends were ambulanced off late.

209
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,513
Your name was mentioned.

210
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,876
The words got to me
by the usual channels.

211
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,839
Certain friends of yours
were named also.

212
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,152
Nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usual.

213
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,913
I'm warning you, little Alex...

214
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,310
...being a good friend
to you as always...

215
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,199
...the one man in this
sore and sick community...

216
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,034
...who wants to save you
from yourself!

217
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,278
What gets into you all?

218
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,671
We've been studying the problem
for damn well near a century.

219
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,956
But we get no farther
with our studies.

220
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,589
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.

221
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,876
You've got not too bad of a brain.

222
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,157
Is it some devil
that crawls inside of you?

223
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,197
Nobody's got anything on me.

224
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,079
I been out of the millicents'
rookers for a long time.

225
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,632
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.

226
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,632
You're about due, by my reckoning.

227
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,108
That's why I'm warning you...

228
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,716
...to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

229
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,234
Do I make myself clear?

230
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,833
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

231
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,311
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

232
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,755
You can rely on me, sir.

233
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,713
Excuse me, brother.

234
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,430
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?

235
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,988
Just a minute.

236
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,792
Pardon me, ladies.

237
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,554
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

238
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,237
A bit cold and pointless,
isn't it, my lovely?

239
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,198
What's happened to yours,
my little sister?

240
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,679
Who you getting, bratty?

241
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,956
Goggly Gogol?
Johnny Zhivago?

242
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,997
The Heaven 17?

243
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,795
What you got back home
to play your fuzzy warbles on?

244
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,113
I bet you've got little
pitiful, portable picnic players.

245
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,430
Come with Uncle
and hear all proper.

246
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,592
Hear angel trumpets
and devil trombones.

247
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,796
You are invited.

248
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,710
Hi, hi, hi, there.

249
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,915
Well, hello.

250
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,674
He are here!
He have arrived!

251
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,433
Hooray!

252
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,753
Welly, welly, welly,
welly, welly, welly, well!

253
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,911
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure
of this surprising visit?

254
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,678
We got worried.

255
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,116
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the old knifey moloko...

256
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,791
...and you had not turned up.

257
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,316
And we thought
you might have been, like...

258
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,790
...offended by something
or other.

259
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,315
So around we come to your abode.

260
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,636
Appy polly loggies.

261
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,912
I had something of a pain
in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

262
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,879
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

263
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,429
Sorry about the pain.

264
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,509
Using the gulliver
too much-like, maybe.

265
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,910
Giving orders and
discipline and such, perhaps.

266
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,590
You sure the pain is gone?

267
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,998
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

268
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,718
Let's get things nice
and sparkling clear.

269
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,315
This sarcasm,
if I may call it such...

270
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,199
...does not become you,
my little brothers.

271
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,952
As I am your droog and leader
I'm entitled to know what goes on.

272
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,909
Now then, Dim.

273
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,153
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

274
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,675
All right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

275
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,229
That's part of the new way.

276
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,474
New way?
What's this about a new way?

277
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,430
There's been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back, I know it.

278
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,558
If you must have it,
have it, then.

279
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,840
We go around shop crasting
and the like...

280
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,516
...coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each.

281
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,990
And Will the English
in the coffee mesto...

282
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,710
...saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast.

283
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,791
The shiny stuff. The ice!

284
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,919
The big, big money's available,
is what Will the English says.

285
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,031
And what will you do
with the big, big, big money?

286
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,111
Have you not everything you need?

287
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,158
If you need a motorcar,
you pluck it from the trees.

288
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,312
If you need pretty polly,
you take it.

289
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,951
Brother, you think and talk
sometimes like a little child.

290
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,234
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

291
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,310
Good! Real horrorshow!

292
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,835
Initiative comes
to thems that wait.

293
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,358
I've taught you much,
my little droogies.

294
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,951
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

295
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,232
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?

296
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,109
- Something to sharpen us up.
- Some moloko plus.

297
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,196
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!

298
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,155
<i>As we walked along</i>
<i>the flatblock marina...</i>

299
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,473
<i>... I was calm on the outside,</i>
<i>but thinking all the time.</i>

300
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,154
<i>So now it was to be</i>
<i>Georgie the General...</i>

301
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,755
<i>... saying what we should do</i>
<i>and what not to do.</i>

302
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,754
<i>And Dim as his mindless,</i>
<i>grinning bulldog.</i>

303
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,515
<i>But suddenly I viddied that</i>
<i>thinking was for the gloopy ones...</i>

304
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,675
<i>... and that the oomny ones used, like,</i>
<i>inspiration and what Bog sends.</i>

305
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,835
<i>For now it was lovely music</i>
<i>that came to my aid.</i>

306
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,038
<i>There was a window open</i>
<i>with a stereo on...</i>

307
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,431
<i>... and I viddied right at once</i>
<i>what to do.</i>

308
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,716
<i>I had not cut into any</i>
<i>of Dim's main cables.</i>

309
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,110
<i>And so with the help</i>
<i>of a clean tashtook...</i>

310
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,635
<i>... the red, red kroovy</i>
<i>soon stopped.</i>

311
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,395
<i>And it did not take long to</i>
<i>quieten the two wounded soldiers...</i>

312
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,200
<i>... down in the snug</i>
<i>of the Duke of New York.</i>

313
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,470
<i>Now they knew who was</i>
<i>master and leader.</i>

314
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,791
<i>Sheep, thought I.</i>

315
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,110
<i>But a real leader knows</i>
<i>always when, like...</i>

316
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,477
<i>... to give and show generous</i>
<i>to his unders.</i>

317
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,110
Now we're back to where we were.

318
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,634
Yes?

319
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,635
Just like before,
and all forgotten?

320
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,438
Right, right, right?

321
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,189
Right.

322
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,035
Right.

323
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,349
Right.

324
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,230
Well, Georgie-boy...

325
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,309
...this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.

326
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,955
Not tonight.

327
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,792
Not this nochy.

328
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,868
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

329
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,597
You're a big, strong chelloveck,
like us all.

330
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,991
We're not little children,
are we, Georgie-boy?

331
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,110
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

332
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,517
<i>It's this health farm.</i>

333
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,511
<i>A bit out of the town.</i>

334
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,913
<i>Isolated.</i>

335
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,397
<i>It's owned by this rich ptitsa</i>
<i>who lives there with her cats.</i>

336
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,312
<i>The place is shut down for a week</i>
<i>and she's completely on her own.</i>

337
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,149
<i>It's full up with, like,</i>
<i>gold and silver...</i>

338
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,311
<i>... and, like, jewels.</i>

339
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,429
<i>Tell me more, Georgie-boy.</i>
<i>Tell me more.</i>

340
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,154
Oh, shit!

341
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,036
Who's there?

342
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,511
Excuse me, can you please help?

343
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,193
There's been a terrible accident!

344
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,238
Can I please use your telephone
for an ambulance?

345
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,157
I'm frightfully sorry.

346
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,436
There's a telephone in the
public house a mile down the road.

347
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,398
I suggest you use that.

348
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,596
But missus, this is an emergency!

349
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,558
It's a matter of life and death!

350
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,429
Me friend's lying in the middle
of the road, bleeding to death!

351
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,155
I'm very sorry, but I never open
the door to strangers after dark.

352
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,118
Very well, madam.

353
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,636
You can't be blamed
for being suspicious...

354
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,509
...with so many scoundrels
and rogues of the night about.

355
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,194
I'll try and get help
at the pub, then.

356
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,795
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

357
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,998
Thank you very much.
Good night.

358
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,479
Dim, bend down.

359
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,518
I'll get in that window
and open the front door.

360
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,678
Radlett Police Station?

361
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,674
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere Health Farm.

362
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,388
I'm sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd just happened.

363
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,359
It's probably nothing at all,
but you never know.

364
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,471
A young man rang the bell,
asking to use the telephone.

365
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,870
He said there's been
some kind of accident.

366
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,475
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

367
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,429
His words sounded like those quoted
in the papers this morning...

368
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,719
...in connection with the writer
and his wife who were assaulted.

369
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,916
Just a few minutes ago.

370
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,798
If you think that's necessary.

371
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,634
But I'm quite sure
he's gone away now.

372
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,838
All right, fine.

373
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,796
Thank you very much.

374
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,718
Hi, hi, hi, there.

375
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,234
At last we meet.

376
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,951
Our brief govorett through the
letter-hole was not satisfactory.

377
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,394
Who are you?

378
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,477
How the hell did you get in here?

379
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,517
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

380
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,078
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

381
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,834
You filthy old soomaka.

382
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,516
Now listen here,
you little bastard!

383
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,070
Just turn round and walk out
of here the same way you came in.

384
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,593
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!

385
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,149
It's a very important work of art.

386
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,875
What the bloody hell do you want?

387
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,913
To be perfectly honest, madam...

388
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,357
...I'm taking part in an
international students' contest...

389
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,195
...to see who can get the most
points for selling magazines.

390
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,476
Cut the shit, sonny...

391
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,077
...and get out of here before you
get yourself into serious trouble.

392
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,312
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here...

393
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,357
...before I throw you out!

394
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,559
Wretched, slummy bedbug!

395
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,629
I'll teach you to break
into real people's houses.

396
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,716
Fucking...

397
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,915
...little...

398
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,913
...bastard!

399
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,553
- Let's go. The police are coming!
- One minoota, droogie.

400
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,673
You bastards! I'm blind!

401
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,799
I'm blind, you bastards!
I can't see!

402
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,152
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my little brothers.

403
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,512
I won't say a single solitary
slovo unless I have my lawyer here.

404
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,274
I know the law, you bastards.

405
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,432
Righty-right, Tom.

406
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,589
We'll have to show our friend Alex
here that we know the law too.

407
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,394
But that knowing the law
isn't everything.

408
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,200
Nasty cut you've got there,
little Alex.

409
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,031
Shame, isn't it?

410
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,836
Spoils all your beauty.

411
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,313
Who gave you that, then?

412
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,352
How'd you do that, then?

413
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,791
What's your point, you bastard?

414
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,156
That is for your lady victim.

415
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,594
You ghastly...

416
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,512
...wretched scoundrel.

417
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,909
Get him off me!

418
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,876
You rotten little bastard!

419
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,994
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

420
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,832
Good evening, Sergeant.

421
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,115
They're in room B, sir.

422
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,952
Thank you very much.

423
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,989
Sergeant...

424
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,150
Good evening.

425
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,833
Good evening, Inspector.

426
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,878
- Would you like your tea now, sir?
- No, thank you, Sergeant.

427
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,997
May I have some
paper towels, please?

428
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,390
We're interrogating
the prisoner now.

429
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,076
- Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
- Thank you very much.

430
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,513
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all.

431
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,398
Oh, dear! This boy
does look a mess, doesn't he?

432
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,432
Just look at the state of him.

433
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,557
Love's young nightmare-like.

434
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,631
Violence makes violence.

435
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,791
He resisted his lawful arrestors.

436
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,357
This is the end of the line for me.

437
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,637
The end of the line, yes.

438
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,359
And what of me, brother sir?

439
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,192
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.

440
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,357
I was led on by
the treachery of others.

441
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,359
Sings the roof off lovely,
he does, sir.

442
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,757
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

443
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,752
It was all their idea, brothers.

444
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,560
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!

445
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,639
You are now a murderer,
little Alex.

446
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,554
A murderer.

447
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,231
Not true, sir.

448
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,198
It was only a slight tolchok.

449
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,874
She were breathing, I swear it.

450
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,430
I've just come from the hospital.

451
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,875
Your victim has died.

452
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,157
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.

453
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,277
This is some new form of torture.

454
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,671
- Say it, brother sir.
- It'll be your own torture.

455
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,549
I hope to God
it'll torture you to madness.

456
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,278
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

457
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,238
We'll hold him down.

458
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,992
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

459
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,755
<i>This is the real weepy and tragic</i>
<i>part of the story beginning...</i>

460
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,116
<i>... O my brothers and only friends.</i>

461
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,715
<i>After a trial,</i>

462
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,033

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,193
<i>... he was sentenced to 14 years</i>
<i>in Staja Number</i> 8<i>4- F...</i>

464
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,830
<i>... among smelly perverts</i>
<i>and hardened prestoopniks.</i>

465
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,755
<i>The shock sending my dada beating</i>
<i>his bruised and krovvy rookers...</i>

466
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,230
<i>... against unfair Bog</i>
<i>in His Heaven.</i>

467
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,552
<i>And my mum boo-hoo-hooing</i>
<i>in her mother's grief...</i>

468
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,075
<i>... at her only child</i>
<i>and son of her bosom...</i>

469
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,834
<i>... like, letting everybody down</i>
<i>real horrorshow.</i>

470
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,833
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.

471
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,398
Right! Open up the cell!

472
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,993
Yes, sir.

473
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,790
Here are the prisoner's
committal forms.

474
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,473
Thank you, mister.

475
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,634
- Name?
- Alexander DeLarge.

476
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,711
You are now in
H.M. Prison Parkmoor.

477
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,350
From this moment, you will address
all prison officers as "sir."

478
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,396
Name?

479
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,875
Alexander DeLarge, sir.

480
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,109
Sentence?

481
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,509
14 years, sir.

482
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,590
Crime?

483
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,909
Murder, sir.

484
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,993
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.

485
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,115
You are now 655321.

486
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,511
It is your duty
to memorize that number.

487
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,716
Thank you, mister. Well done.

488
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,598
- Thank you.
- Let the officer out.

489
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,109
All right, empty your pockets.

490
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,672
Are you able to see the white line
painted on the floor...

491
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,194
...directly behind you...

492
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,714
...655321?

493
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,473
Then your toes belong...

494
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,597
...on the other side of it!

495
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,958
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

496
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,634
Carry on.

497
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,156
Pick that up...

498
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,073
...and put it down properly.

499
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,351
One half-bar of chocolate.

500
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,113
One bunch of keys
on white metal ring.

501
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,917
One packet of cigarettes.

502
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,991
Two plastic ball pens.

503
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,231
One black, one red.

504
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,392

00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,317
One address book,
imitation red leather.

506
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,597
One ten-penny piece.

507
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,520
One white metal wristlet watch...

508
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,548
...Timawrist, on a white metal
expanding bracelet.

509
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,511
Anything else in your pockets?

510
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,953
- No, sir.
- Right.

511
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,192
Sign here for your
valuable property.

512
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,671
The tobacco and chocolate
you brought in...

513
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,148
...you lose that...

514
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,391
...as you are now convicted.

515
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,312
Now over to the table
and get undressed.

516
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,991
Were you in police custody
this morning?

517
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,673
One jacket, blue pinstriped.

518
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,955
Prison custody?

519
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,189
Yes, sir, on remand.

520
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,192

00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,352
Do you mean the Church of England?

523
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,272
Yes, sir.
The Church of England.

524
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,475
Brown hair, isn't it?

525
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,835
Fair hair, sir.

526
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,035
Blue eyes?

527
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,633
Blue, sir.

528
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,348
Do you wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses?

529
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,396
No, sir.

530
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,517
One shirt, blue.
Collar attached.

531
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,355
Have you been receiving medical
treatment for any serious illness?

532
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,989
One pair of boots, black leather.
Zippered. Worn.

533
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,674
Have you ever had
any mental illness?

534
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,629
Do you wear any false teeth
or any false limbs?

535
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,996
One pair of trousers,
blue pinstriped.

536
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,471
Have you ever had any attacks
of fainting or dizziness?

537
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,199
One pair of socks, black.

538
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,112
Are you an epileptic?

539
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,794
One pair of underpants,
white with blue waistband.

540
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,549
Are you now, or have you ever been,
a homosexual?

541
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,830
Right.

542
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,514
- The mothballs, mister.
- Mothballs, sir.

543
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,759
Now then, face the wall...

544
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,720
...bend over and touch your toes.

545
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,519
Any venereal disease?

546
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,193
Crabs? Lice?

547
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,318
- Through there for the bath.
- One for a bath.

548
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,508
What's it going to be, eh?

549
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,716
Is it going to be in and out
of institutions like this...

550
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,871
...though more in than out
for most of you?

551
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,033
Or are you going to attend
to the divine word...

552
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,829
...and realize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners...

553
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,071
...in the next world
as well as this?

554
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,276
A lot of idiots you are...

555
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,991
...selling your birthright
for a saucer of cold porridge.

556
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,878
The thrill of theft.

557
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:21,916
Of violence.

558
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,720
The urge to live easy.

559
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,520
Well, I ask you what is it worth...

560
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,990
...when we have undeniable proof...

561
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,232
...yes, incontrovertible
evidence...

562
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,754
...that hell exists?

563
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,149
I know!

564
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,834
I know, my friends.

565
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,071
I have been informed...

566
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,753
...in visions...

567
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,399
...that there is a place...

568
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,949
...darker than any prison...

569
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,079
...hotter than any flame
of human fire...

570
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,594
...where souls...

571
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,879
...of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves...

572
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,195
Don't you laugh, damn you!
Don't you laugh.

573
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,318
I say, like yourselves...

574
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,068
...scream...

575
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,995
...in endless and
unendurable agony.

576
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,039
Their skin...

577
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,669
...rotting and peeling.

578
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,592
A fireball...

579
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,070
...spinning in their
screaming guts!

580
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,596
I know. Yes, I know!

581
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,518
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258...

582
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,988
...in the prisoner's hymnal.

583
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,312
And let's have a little reverence,
you bastards!

584
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,071
<i>I was a wandering sheep</i>

585
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,634
- Sing up, damn you!
<i>- I did not love the fold</i>

586
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,233
Louder!

587
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,270
<i>I did not love my shepherd's voice</i>

588
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,078
<i>I would not be controlled</i>

589
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,229
Louder!

590
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,592
<i>It had not been edifying.</i>
<i>Indeed not.</i>

591
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,594
<i>Being in this hellhole</i>
<i>and human zoo for two years now.</i>

592
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,832
<i>Being kicked and tolchoked</i>
<i>by brutal warders...</i>

593
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,913
<i>... and meeting leering criminals</i>
<i>and perverts...</i>

594
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,639
<i>... ready to dribble all over...</i>

595
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,678
<i>... a luscious young malchick</i>
<i>like your storyteller.</i>

596
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,873
<i>It was my rabbit...</i>

597
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,759
<i>... to help the prison charlie</i>
<i>with the Sunday service.</i>

598
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,912
<i>He was a bolshy,</i>
<i>great burly bastard.</i>

599
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,072
<i>But he was very fond of myself,</i>
<i>me being very young...</i>

600
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,596
<i>... and also now very interested</i>
<i>in the Big Book.</i>

601
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,515
<i>I read all about the scourging</i>
<i>and the crowning with thorns.</i>

602
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,557
<i>And I could viddy myself</i>
<i>helping in...</i>

603
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,588
<i>... and even taking charge of</i>
<i>the tolchoking and the nailing in.</i>

604
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,037
<i>Being dressed in the height</i>
<i>of Roman fashion.</i>

605
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,869
<i>I didn 't so much like</i>
<i>the latter part of the Book...</i>

606
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,156
<i>... which is more like</i>
<i>all preachy talking...</i>

607
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,470
<i>... than fighting</i>
<i>and the old in-out.</i>

608
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,712
<i>I like the parts where these old</i>
<i>yahoodies tolchok each other...</i>

609
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,110
<i>... and then drink</i>
<i>their Hebrew vino...</i>

610
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,392
<i>... and getting onto the bed</i>
<i>with their wives ' handmaidens.</i>

611
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,596
<i>That kept me going.</i>

612
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,438
"Seek not to be like evil men.

613
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,876
Neither desire to be with them...

614
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,078
...because their minds
studieth robberies...

615
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,118
...and their lips speak deceits."

616
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,716
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress...

617
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,110
...thy strength
shall be diminished.

618
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,952
Fine, my son. Fine.

619
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,394
Father?

620
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,952
I have tried, have I not?

621
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,235
You have, my son.

622
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,710
- I've done my best, have I not?
- Indeed.

623
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,191
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have I?

624
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,592
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.

625
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,593
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

626
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,068
Father...

627
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,153
...can I ask you
a question in private?

628
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,551
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

629
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,754
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

630
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,955
Don't be shy to speak up.

631
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,634
Remember...

632
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,757
...I know of the...

633
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,675
...urges that can
trouble young men...

634
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,353
...deprived...

635
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,511
...of the society of women.

636
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,510
It's nothing like that, Father.

637
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,351
It's about this new thing
they're all talking about.

638
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,472
About this new treatment.

639
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,950
It gets you out of prison
in no time.

640
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,668
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

641
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,590
Where did you hear about this?

642
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,400
Who's been talking
about these things?

643
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,989
These things get around.

644
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,390
Two warders talk, as it might be.

645
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,552
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

646
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,311
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops...

647
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,028
...and the newspaper
tells all about it.

648
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,429
How about putting me in
for this new treatment?

649
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,515
I take it you are referring...

650
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,910
...to the Ludovico technique.

651
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,870
I don't know what it's called.

652
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,917
I just know it
gets you out quickly...

653
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,549
...and makes sure you
never get back in again.

654
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,959
That is not proven, 655321.

655
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,193
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

656
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,279
It has been used, hasn't it?

657
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,159
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

658
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,755
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

659
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,549
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers involved.

660
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,199
I don't care about the dangers.

661
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,910
I just want to be good.

662
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,680
I want for the rest
of my life to be...

663
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,911
...one act of goodness.

664
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,559
The question is...

665
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,397
...whether or not this technique
really makes a man good.

666
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,395
Goodness comes from within.

667
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,709
Goodness...

668
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,279
...is chosen.

669
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,676
When a man cannot choose...

670
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,956
...he ceases to be a man.

671
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,390
I don't understand about
the whys and wherefores, Father.

672
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,358
I only know I want to be good.

673
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,231
Be patient, my son.

674
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,630
Put your trust in the Lord.

675
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,916
Instruct Thy Son
and He shall refresh thee...

676
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,913
...and shall give delight
to thy soul.

677
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,714
Amen.

678
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,237
- Mister!
- All present and correct, sir!

679
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,469
Right!

680
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,991
All present and correct, sir!

681
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,759
Prisoners, halt!

682
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,838
Now pay attention!

683
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,192
I want you in two lines...

684
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,000
...up against that wall,
facing this way.

685
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,719
Go on, move!

686
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,155
Hurry up!

687
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,628
Stop talking!

688
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,708
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

689
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,155
How many to a cell?

690
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,197
Four in this block, sir.

691
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,190
Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

692
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,477
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

693
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,235
I agree, sir. We need
larger prisons, more money.

694
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,198
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

695
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,670
The government can't be
concerned any longer...

696
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,558
...with outmoded
penalogical theories.

697
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,310
Soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders.

698
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,950
Common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis.

699
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,794
Kill the criminal reflex,
that's all.

700
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,156
Full implementation
in a year's time.

701
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,550
Punishment means nothing to them.

702
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,598
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

703
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,949
You're absolutely right, sir.

704
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,668
Shut your bleeding hole!

705
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,759
Who said that?

706
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,713
I did, sir.
