00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:15,607
<i>This is Hollywood,
land of stars and stories.</i>

3
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:18,948
<i>But our story does not take place here.</i>

4
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:23,525
<i>So we will now leave Hollywood
and go to Beverly Hills...</i>

5
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,923
<i>...where the stars live.</i>

6
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,721
<i>But our story
does not take place here either.</i>

7
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,300
<i>The people in our story
live not far away...</i>

8
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:37,371
<i>...in a small town called Los Angeles.</i>

9
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,839
<i>It's a nice little place
with plenty of climate...</i>

10
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,604
<i>...many fine public parks...</i>

11
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,238
<i>...full of playgrounds
and swimming pools.</i>

12
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:52,787
<i>And in one of these parks
is a pool with a very pretty teacher.</i>

13
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:54,719
- Are you all ready?
Yes, Miss Glenn.

14
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,324
All right, let's go then.
Come on.

15
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:59,689
Johnny, Michael, Lois...

16
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,991
...Jimmy, Billy, Julio.

17
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:12,170
What's the matter, Julio?
Don't you want to dive?

18
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:16,005
No, seńorita, I do not like to do it.
But for you, I do it.

19
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,284
Oh, now, don't laugh at Julio.
He did his best. Come on, Julio.

20
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,516
I'm sorry, seńorita.

21
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,126
I wanna be good like you,
but I am bad like me.

22
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,821
You'll be a good diver some day,
off the high board too.

23
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,125
I do not think so.

24
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,734
Won't you try to learn?
It'd make me very happy.

25
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:42,235
Then I will try.

26
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,732
It's not very hard if you practice.
I'll show you.

27
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,849
- Now, you watch me.
- Do you mind if I watch too?

28
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,514
Not at all.

29
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:05,650
- I'd like to see you do a swan dive.
- All right.

30
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:23,339
There, Julio. See how easy it is
if you practice?

31
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:24,907
Thank you.

32
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,348
- Now what are you going to do?
- Go home.

33
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,713
- Class dismissed.
Goodbye, seńorita.

34
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:31,911
Goodbye.

35
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:36,392
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

36
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,930
Julio.

37
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,594
Julio.

38
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:54,409
- How would you like to have a dollar? Hmm?
- A dollar? I do not know. I never had one.

39
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,135
Well, here's the deal, Julio.

40
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,644
I want to find out some things
about your teacher.

41
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:01,249
She is very pretty.
She is very nice.

42
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,648
Once she takes us to her house on picnic
with ice cream.

43
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:07,722
She show us her cups,
she has many cups for loving.

44
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:11,784
- For loving?
- Big silver cups with ears.

45
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,929
She win them
in swimming and diving.

46
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:17,629
- Uh, what's her name?
- Seńorita Cynthia Glenn.

47
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,324
Cynthia?

48
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:22,938
<i>- Do you know where she lives?
- Si, seńor, with her uncle and aunt.</i>

49
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,698
Well, where do they live?

50
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,865
- Are you a policeman?
- No.

51
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,841
- Are you a villain?
- No. I'm a businessman.

52
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:31,776
Uh, where does Miss Glenn live?

53
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:34,576
- Are you gonna do any badness to her?
- No.

54
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:40,519
Then I will tell you.
She live 14422 Mariposa Avenue.

55
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,202
- Hello, Aunt Nona.
- Hello, dear.

56
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:02,803
Oh, dear.

57
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,413
Oh, I forgot it was so late.

58
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,573
I sat down to play Chopin,
one piece led to another.

59
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,083
But, darling,
dinner will be ready in just a jiffy.

60
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:12,414
Thank you, dear.

61
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:15,386
- Oh, Cynthia.
- Something's happened.

62
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:16,684
Uh-huh.

63
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:19,487
Oh, I wanted you to have
such a nice, hot dinner.

64
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,892
You need one
after a day of such damp work...

65
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:24,260
...but something went wrong
with the gas range.

66
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,926
- What?
- The gas. It stopped coming out.

67
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:30,197
It was on, and then, pfft...

68
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,000
...it was off.

69
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,574
- Aunt Nona, did you pay the bills?
- Of course, I did... Why, didn't I?

70
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:42,479
Oh, I'm sure I did.
Well, almost sure.

71
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:47,919
I know I deposited my annuity check.
So I must have plenty of money in the bank.

72
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:51,993
And anyway, dear, if I haven't,
they always tell me.

73
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,458
Oh, that's where that was.

74
00:06:55,631 --> 00:07:00,694
I know I wrote checks for all the bills
and sent them off.

75
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,997
Yes, I distinctly remember
licking the stamps.

76
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,440
Oh, darling, I'll go see
about dinner right away.

77
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:08,975
- It'll be cold, I'm afraid.
- Oh, that's all right.

78
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,943
Oh, by the way, I think I found
a rather interesting headline...

79
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:13,776
...for Uncle Hoby's collection.
Is he home?

80
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,078
Uh-huh. In the study. He's pasting away.

81
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:22,185
- Hello, mermaid. Have a good day?
- Swell.

82
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,882
Got a pretty good headline for you.

83
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,652
- Yeah? Ha, ha.
- Mm-hm.

84
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:30,197
"Man with Three Wives Asks 'Why Not?"'
Fair question.

85
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,596
Thank you, dear.
I'll put it right in the book.

86
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,737
Cynthia, in the headlines,
you find all the wisdom...

87
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:39,306
...and all the foolishness
of the alleged human race.

88
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,875
I collect the foolishness.
There's more of it.

89
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,138
Uncle Hoby, what are these?

90
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,013
- They look like letters.
- Mm-hm. They are.

91
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,550
The gas company, phone company,
light company...

92
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,087
I meant to mail them
but I didn't happen to pass a mailbox.

93
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,191
In more than a month?

94
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:59,021
Put them right back in my pocket,
I'll mail them tomorrow.

95
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:03,325
- Oh, no. I'll mail them myself.
- Now, don't you forget.

96
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:10,299
I just remembered the electricity is on.
We're going to have such a nice dinner.

97
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:13,067
Tea, and toast, and jam,
and beans, and salad...

98
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,734
Oh, you'd better punch holes in the tops
of those bean cans, they'll blow up.

99
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,814
Oh, I know that. So will canned corn.
Remember?

100
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:24,017
Now, where did I put that can opener?

101
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,884
Oh, thank you, dear.

102
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,254
- What's in this box?
- Oh, your flowers.

103
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,488
- My flowers?
- Didn't I tell you about them...

104
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:37,132
...when you first came in?
- No.

105
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,268
Oh, dear me.
I must be getting fuzzy in the head.

106
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,562
- Ah.
- They came a little while ago.

107
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:46,068
Now, did I invite anybody to dinner?

108
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:49,439
Oh, aren't they lovely?

109
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,443
- Who are they from?
- Well, I don't know.

110
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,081
- Doesn't it say on the card?
- No.

111
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:55,410
All it says is, "Thanks for the swan dive. "

112
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:58,986
Cynthia, you've got a beau.
Who is he? Tell me.

113
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:02,454
Well, I don't know who he is
or anything about him.

114
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,890
Except that he was rather attractive
and important-looking.

115
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:11,090
<i>- Do we take Fortune Magazine?
- Fortune Magazine? No, I don't think so.</i>

116
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,531
This copy just came
by special messenger.

117
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:17,230
- Oh, it's for you, Cynthia.
- For me? I don't subscribe to it.

118
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:20,466
- Maybe they'd like you to.
- No. Here's something written here.

119
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,170
It says, "Dear Miss Glenn,
please see page 98."

120
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,343
Look for me, will you, Uncle Hoby?

121

123
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:38,421
Pygmy business? Why, I didn't know
they ever sold them.

124
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:39,754
Shh, shh.

Lots of flowers.

This is to be an all-out sales campaign.

135
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,720
Precisely. Where'd be a good place
to take her to today?

136
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:19,295
Well, how about the races?

I know. It's 300 a month and they pay
their bills when they remember to...

152
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:55,794
...so their credit is good.

153
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,330
I know all about you too.

154
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,492
You were born here in Los Angeles.
Your father was a doctor.

155
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,432
Your parents died when you were 7.

156
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,596
You attended high school
and the university.

157
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,765
You got fairly good marks.
You were popular.

158
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:10,173
- How do you know so much about me?
- I made it my business to find out.

159
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:11,711
And...

160
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:17,014
Everything I found out about you,
Cynthia, I like.

161
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,984
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, Mr. Delbar.

162
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:29,357
- Well, there's J.P. Bancroft.
- Really?

163
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:31,666
Will you excuse me?

164
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,427
- Well, hello, Bob.
- Hello, J.P.

165
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:38,732
Mr. Carker, gas and oil.
Mr. Delbar, Praktikon.

166
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,341
I've heard of you.

167
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,171
- Ha-ha-ha. Sit down. Sit down.
- Thank you.

168
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,245
When can you and I get together,
tomorrow?

169
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:46,779
No. I'm afraid not.

170
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:49,144
I'm flying back East
first thing in the morning.

171
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,786
There's nothing we can do
until we've had a meeting...

172
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,889
...with that fellow in Washington.
- When will that be?

173
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:59,221
Well, as soon as I've arranged an interview,
I'll let you know. And you'd better be there.

174
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:02,660
Don't worry, I'll be there.
Nothing could stop me.

175
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:07,058
- Well, very pretty.
- I think so.

176
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:12,440
- See you in Washington. Goodbye, J.P.
- Goodbye, Bob.

177
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,906
Nice to have met you, Mr. Carker.

178
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,676
Yeah.

179
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:19,712
There's a very able fellow.

180
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,043
He'll be right up there on top
someday too.

181
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,947
Great man, J.P. I suppose
he's the richest man in the country today.

182
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,592
- More wine?
- No, thank you.

183
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,159
He and I have a big deal on.

184
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:36,093
If it goes through, it'll mean a lot
to Praktikon and to me.

185
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,325
What were you and Mr. Bancroft
saying about me?

186
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,095
He asked me who you were.

187
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,536
And I told him
you're the girl I'm going to marry.

188
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:49,573
Congratulations.

189
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,515
Relatives of the bride.

190
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:06,355
I guess Bob was right about wanting
to have the wedding in his house.

191
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:10,693
- It is nicer than ours.
- Well, anyway, it's bigger.

192
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,960
We could have rented chairs,
but he insisted and insisted.

193
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:16,696
Yeah, he's quite an insister.

194
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,304
- I do hope Cynthia will be happy.
- Yeah, I hope so too.

195
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:25,709
You know, dear, I don't think I'd like
to be married to Bob, would you?

196
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:29,510
Well, I haven't given the matter
much thought, but offhand, I'd say no.

197
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,188
Lady?
- Yes.

198
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,194
- I would like to see Seńorita Glenn.
- Well, she's busy getting married.

199
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:45,925
Yes, I know. But please,
will you say to her that Julio's here?

200
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:50,162
- Ju... Julio? Where?
- Here.

201
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,136
Oh.

202
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,369
Cynthia, Julio's here.

203
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:57,478
- Oh, where?
- Out there.

204
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,671
- Where are you going, dear?
- To see somebody.

205
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:02,646
We ought to get started if we're going
to get to the hotel before dark.

206
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,809
This is an old friend,
a gentleman friend.

207
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,454
Oh, who is he?

208
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,647
Bob, you don't need to be jealous
of him.

209
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,815
He's one of the boys
from my swimming class.

210
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,019
- But, Cynthia, you haven't time...
Yes, I have.

211
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,797
- Hello, Julio.
- Hello, Seńorita Glenn.

212
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,198
- I'm Mrs. Delbar now, Julio.
- Yes, Seńorita Glenn.

213
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,837
I have brought to you a present.

214
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,406
Thank you. Where is it?

215
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:27,870
It is not very nice.

216
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:32,343
I could not buy anything
very nice, or anything.

217
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,846
Come with me, please,
I will show you.

218
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:08,579
Julio.

219
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,382
Julio, that was perfect.
You did learn.

220
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,084
- For you, seńorita, that is my present.
- Oh.

221
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,292
Cynthia, you'll ruin your dress.

222
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,125
I won't need it again.

223
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:54,752
Good evening, Mr. Delbar.
- Good evening.

224
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:57,760
Hmm. I see you're using my pen.

225
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,298
- Your pen, sir?
- One of them.

226
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:00,696
Look, dear. Praktikon.

227
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:03,861
Pens are just a sideline,
we'll sell millions of them this year.

228
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,973
Suite 44.
- Thank you.

229
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,824
Darling, people.

230
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:32,262
- Huh? What?
- People.

231
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:34,527
Oh, oh, yes. How do you do?

232
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:35,727
Uh...

233
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:38,236
Goodbye. We're just going.

234
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:41,137
We're so sorry.
We meant to leave sooner but...

235
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,834
Oh, that's all right.
We understand.

236
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:48,178
- Are you...? Have you...?
- Yes, we've just been married too.

237
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,650
Wonderful, isn't it?

238
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,254
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

239
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,582
- Weren't they sweet?
- Very.

240
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:03,489
Well, I'II, uh... I'll go get ready for dinner.

241
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,330
Here you are, boys.
- Thank you.

242
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,567
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

243
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:18,540
How do you do? I'm Mrs. Fenway.
May I come in? Thank you.

244
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:22,650
I'm extremely sorry that your suite
has not been tidied up. May we do it now?

245
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:24,911
- Ha, ha, yes.
- Thank you. Come along, girls.

246
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:28,454
And do get a wiggle on.
There simply wasn't a chance till now.

247
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:32,355
The other couple stayed and stayed.
I do hope we're not inconveniencing you.

248
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,588
It really doesn't matter, we're going down
to dinner in a moment.

249
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,096
When you come back,
everything will be perfect.

250
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:41,759
- Business is good here at the hotel.
- Splendid. Every bed is taken.

251
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:45,065
We've had a rather tempting offer
for the use of the billiard table.

252
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,867
Anyone special staying here?

253
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,102
Well, we have Major Thomas Milvaine...

254
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,372
...the flyer who shot down
all those Japs.

255
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,812
And then we have the daughter
of J.P. Bancroft.

256
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:57,383
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, she just arrived. Do you know her?

257
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,817
No, I know her father.
We'll have to look her up.

258
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:02,218
Then we have... Uh, who else? Let me see.

259
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,789
Oh, of course, the Great Dane.
Nils Knudsen of the Metropolitan Opera.

260
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,628
He's one of our regular patrons.

261
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:48,852
He comes here to take off weight,
a hundred pounds.

262
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:52,364
A very nice man, but a bit
of a problem child when he's on a diet.

263
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,161
I have to be quite severe with him.

264
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,770
Pardon me.
- Oh, there's my wife. Will you excuse me?

265
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:59,203
Of course, I do hope
you'll enjoy your stay here.

266
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:01,274
I expect to.

267
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:18,655
Bob, look, Tommy Dorsey,
the same orchestra.

268
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,226
Same as what?

269
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:22,920
Don't you remember
the first evening we spent together?

270
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:25,532
Of course, I do.
I remember every second of it.

271
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,760
But that night,
I wasn't noticing orchestras.

272
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,200
What is the name, if you please?
- Robert Delbar.

273
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,307
Oh, yes, Mr. Delbar.
This way, if you please.

274
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,378
- Bob, I've seen that man somewhere.
- In opera probably. That's Nils Knudsen.

275
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,245
Oh, of course.

276
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:40,039
Is that all I get?
- Yes, sir, that is all.

277
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,402
No dessert?

278
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:44,044
Well, I could maybe
bring you another carrot.

279
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:47,477
Oscar, do I even look a little like a rabbit?

280
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:50,846
No. Oh, no, no, sir.
But your diet says only vegetables.

281
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:55,820
Vegetables. The only vegetables I like
are steak and beer.

282
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:58,482
- Bring me some right away.
- No, sir.

283
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,684
You heard what I said.

284
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:02,523
But you said that no matter what you say,
I am to say, "No, sir. "

285
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:08,101
- But, Oscar, only a little steak. A little beer.
- No, sir.

286
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:13,003
But look at me.
I am so empty, so thin.

287
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:18,606
- I could ask maybe Mrs. Fenway.
- Never mind. She'd say no.

288
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:25,947
- It's funny.
- What?

289
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:28,316
- Our being married.
- You're not sorry already?

290
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,823
Oh, no, darling.
When I said, "I do," I meant it.

291
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,019
But after all, Bob, we really don't know
each other so very well.

292
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:38,826
Well, we should.
We've had time to study each other.

293
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,832
Yes, a whole month.
And what a month.

294
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,871
You know, being courted by you was like
being swept over Niagara Falls in a canoe.

295
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,953
Good evening, John.
- Good evening, Mrs. Fenway. Good evening.

296
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:07,286
- Oh, Nils, good evening.
- Good evening.

297
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:11,023
- And how are you tonight?
- Oh, same as last night, Sara.

298
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,599
Healthy, but hungry.

299
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:16,596
Oh, Oscar, I think I'll take
the noodle soup...

300
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:20,730
...roast duck with lots of dressing,
asparagus with hollandaise sauce...

301
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:23,309
...potatoes au gratin
and a double-chocolate sundae.

302
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:25,446
And take away those dishes.

303
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:32,781
Oh, Oscar.

304
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:37,482
Can you tell me who that beautiful...
Uh, those people are over there?

305
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:43,295
No, Major Milvaine, they just arrived.

306
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:49,562
Major, the next time you come in,
try the boiled beef and potatoes.

307
00:24:57,145 --> 00:25:00,012
- Telephone call for you, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

308
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:02,673
Excuse me, dear. Hello.

309
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:06,184
Oh, hello, J.P. It's Bancroft.

310
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:09,189
You have? Oh, that's fine.

311
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:13,921
I see. I see.

312
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:18,659
I see. I see.

313
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,164
Hold the wire, please.

314
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,031
It's about that big deal.
He wants me to fly to Washington.

315
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:26,402
They've got a place for me on a plane,
one place.

316
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,635
I hate to go, darling, but...
Wait a minute.

317
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:33,269
Hello, J.P., can you get them to postpone
that meeting a few days?

318
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:37,850
Ah, well, for me to leave right now
would be awfully inconvenient.

319
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,078
I'm on my honeymoon.

320
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:46,125
He says the appointment won't wait.
I guess I'll have to go.

321
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,687
All right, Bob.

322
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:54,066
Okay, J.P., I'll be on that plane.
I'll see you in the morning. Goodbye.

323
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:56,704
I'm sorry, darling,
but it's such a big deal.

324
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:58,736
I'll go and throw some things
into a bag.

325
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:01,637
- You didn't unpack.
- Oh, that's a break.

326
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:12,485
- They're on their honeymoon.
- I'm glad somebody's happy.

327
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,350
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for your pleasure, I hope...

328
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:17,514
...but chiefly
to keep peace in my family...

329
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:19,956
...you're about to witness
the first appearance...

330
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:22,688
...of a young lady very close to my heart.
Miss Susan Dorsey.

331
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,726
- Scared?
- Uh-huh.

332
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,300
- Then I'll do it.
- No, I will.

333
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,270
All right.
But try not to be too hammy.

334
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,050
<i>Once upon a groovy time</i>

335
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:33,922
<i>There lived a prince without a dime</i>

336
00:28:34,095 --> 00:28:37,895
<i>The princess was his favorite chick
But with no dough, they couldn't click</i>

337
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,524
<i>Seems he played a slide trombone
And had a knockout mellow tone</i>

338
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:45,139
<i>The kingdom nearly fell apart
When he'd start</i>

339
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,476
<i>He played it low, he played it high
He sent it clear up to the sky</i>

340
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,882
<i>The people loved to hear the guy
With the slide trombone</i>

341
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:11,329
<i>So one bright and sunny day
He packed his horn and went away</i>

342
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,196
<i>He formed a band and got a job
The cats all named them Dorsey's Mob</i>

343
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,931
<i>He got the gal and what is more
Folks the king and queen adore</i>

344
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:22,543
<i>The way he sends their regal feet
It's sweet</i>

345
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:32,386
<i>- He played it low
He played it high</i>

346
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,385
<i>He sent it clear
Up to the sky</i>

347
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:36,353
<i>The people loved to hear the guy</i>

348
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:42,520
<i>With the slide trombone</i>

349
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:03,611
Excuse me of watching.

350
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:12,725
Now, Nils, they're only carrying out
your orders.

351
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,828
You can always change your mind,
you know.

352
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:19,695
- What I want to change is my figure.
- Well, then don't be grumpy about it.

353
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:23,895
Let me be grumpy please.
It takes my mind off my stomach.

354
00:30:25,273 --> 00:30:27,434
Mrs. Fenway, I've been called unexpectedly
on business.

355
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:31,636
- I'll be back in a few days.
- Yes, Mr. Delbar.

356
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,638
Hmm.

357
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:36,312
- I beg your pardon?
- Hmm.

358
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:37,610
Hmm, what?

359
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:39,150
What has happened to romance?

360
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,346
He goes to make money
when he could stay and make love?

361
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:46,460
I'm glad I can still be romantic, Sara.

362
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:22,889
<i>Heart of hearts
Awake from thy dreaming</i>

363
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:27,626
<i>Wake, oh, wake for love</i>

364
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:37,210
<i>Can't thou hear me softly paining?</i>

365
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:41,542
<i>Answer to my call</i>

366
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:46,915
<i>Answer to my call</i>

367
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:52,116
<i>Heed me while the stars are shining</i>

368
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:57,026
<i>Come and be my all</i>

369
00:31:57,198 --> 00:32:03,228
<i>Come and be my all</i>

370
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:06,896
<i>Fast the shades of night are falling</i>

371
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:10,670
<i>Soon the day will end</i>

372
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:17,341
<i>Hear the song my heart is calling</i>

373
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:25,992
<i>Love for you and me</i>

374
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,493
<i>Love for you</i>

375
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:33,623
<i>And me</i>

376
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:37,168
<i>For you</i>

377
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:41,104
<i>And me</i>

378
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,187
Excuse me.
Is there anything I can do?

379
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:03,353
Oh, no. No, thanks.

380
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:05,692
I'm sorry if I bothered you.
I'll go inside.

381
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:09,769
- Oh, but not to cry, please.
- You won't hear me.

382
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:12,929
- What's the matter? Have bad news?
- No.

383
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:16,042
- Trouble?
- No.

384
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,577
- Love?
- Does it matter?

385
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:22,983
No, but I'd like to know.

386
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:26,213
Well, my husband's gone away.

387
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:29,413
- Left you? For good?
- Oh, no, no.

388
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,858
He had business in Washington.

389
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:35,860
- Oh, that doesn't sound so very bad.
- No?

390
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:39,259
No, he's left you alone before,
hasn't he?

391
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:41,592
Never for a moment.

392
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,330
Well, how long have you been married?

393
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,970
Not long.

394
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:49,803
How long?

395
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:52,771
You're very curious.

396
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:56,941
Yes, yes. I'd like to know, how long?

397
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:00,613
Since noon today.

398
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,120
- What?
- High noon.

399
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,623
And he went away and left you?

400
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:08,419
Oh, he had to go.

401
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:11,087
He had a big deal, a very big deal.

402
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:15,065
- Will it make him $20 billion?
- No, of course not.

403
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:17,227
Then I don't understand it.

404
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,832
Thank you.

405
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:23,038
Well, good night.

406
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:26,840
- Uh, you're not gonna cry anymore?
- No.

407
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:30,643
- Then good night.
- Good night.

408
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:07,479
Put it down right over here
by the chair, Lyonel.

409
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:13,149
That's fine. Thank you.

410
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:33,641
- He looks like one, doesn't he?
- One what?

411
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:35,180
One hero.

412
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,613
Oh, is that Major Milvaine?

413
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:41,084
- Must be. Don't you think so?
- Could be.

414
00:35:41,255 --> 00:35:42,779
I heard he was here at the hotel.

415
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:44,788
I don't know what he looks like though.

416
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,689
Like that, he's got to.

417
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:02,772
He seems to be a bit
of a show-off, doesn't he?

418
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:07,005
Well, look what he's got to show.
And look what he did.

419
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:11,015
He shot down 16...
Or was it 26 Jap planes?

420
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:12,243
Got shot down at sea.

421
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,752
Paddled 200... Or was it 2000?

422
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,187
I don't know... Miles in a life raft,
spent a month on a jungle island.

423
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:19,917
Oh, sad, very sad.

424
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:23,258
Well, he got back safe and sound.
What's so sad about it?

425
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:26,625
On the island, he was alone.

426
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,429
Something tells me
he's not gonna be alone here.

427
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,800
Oh?

428
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,201
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll match you for him.

429
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:39,005
Oh, no. I don't want him.
He's all yours.

430
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:41,139
Thanks. Uh...?

431
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:44,944
- Cynthia. Cynthia Delbar.
- I'm Maude Bancroft.

432
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,283
Oh, really? I wanted to meet you.
Bob knows your father.

433
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,891
- Bob?
- Yes, that's my husband.

434
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:55,053
Oh, so that's it.
There's a husband.

435
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:56,821
Yes, there is.

436
00:36:57,698 --> 00:37:01,031
This, uh, is a nice place
to spend a honeymoon, isn't it?

437
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,133
Yes, it is.

438
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,469
Uh, which is your Bob?

439
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:11,334
Well, uh, you see, Bob isn't here,
he's in Washington.

440
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,639
- And it's your honeymoon?
- Yes.

441
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,346
Well, I doubt
if it'll ever become popular.

442
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,734
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right, babe.

443
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:37,336
- Some spot they got here, huh?
- Yes, it is.

444
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,804
- You gonna stay here long?
- Oh, as long as I find it amusing.

445
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:43,443
- What about you?
- I'll be around for a couple weeks.

446
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:46,273
- Then I got to go and do some fighting.
- Oh, I know.

447
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:48,915
Don't worry, babe. I'll win.

448
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:53,184
I'm good.

449
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,413
I win 22 battles in a row.

450
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:57,716
Nine of them by knockout.

451
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:04,727
Hey, there's another good physique.

452
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:55,472
Oh.

453
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:59,244
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.

454
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,037
- You can't swim?
- No, I can't swim.

455
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:19,832
- I can.
- Ah, but can you do this?

456
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:22,373
Can you pat your head
and rub your stomach at the same time?

457
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:25,478
- Oh, of course, I can.
- Oh, so can I.

458
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:28,240
Well, let's see you do it.

459
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:29,974
There, you see.

460
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:32,483
Pooh-pooh to you, ladies.

461
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,615
- Oh, I must be doing something wrong.
- Ha.

462
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,479
- You really can't swim, can't you?
- No.

463
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,848
But can you pat your head
and rub your stomach?

464
00:40:09,223 --> 00:40:11,589
At the same time?

465
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,655
There, you needn't be so snooty
just because you can swim.

466
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,491
- Any fish can do that.
- Ha-ha-ha.

467
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,599
I wasn't being snooty.

468
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:22,065
Look, I could teach you to swim
in no time at all.

469
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:25,171
Oh, take all the time you want.
I'll be here a couple of weeks.

470
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,034
First we'll float.

471
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,369
One of us will float.

472
00:40:29,543 --> 00:40:30,805
Oh, now, you can float.

473
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:32,570
That's easy. It's natural.

474
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:34,907
- Well, not to me, I crash-dive.
- Ah, ha.

475
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:36,777
Oh, you don't know how to relax.
Come on.

476
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:39,442
You just relax
as if you were going to sleep.

477
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,020
Fill your lungs with a little air,
now come on.

478
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,955
And when your feet start going down,
now just gently wiggle your toes.

479
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:49,528
- Come on, wiggle them.
- Gently wiggle toes.

480
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,766
Hey, look, I'm doing it. I'm floating.

481
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,173
- My old trouble, I just don't stay up.
- Come on, we'll try again.

482
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,213
- Lovely day, isn't it?
- Now, don't talk.

483
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,612
Why not?

484
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,953
Come on, once more.

485
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,322
- There now.
- Oh.

486
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:28,628
- See? You're doing it. It's easy, isn't it?
- It's a cinch.

487
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,578
Oh, Major Tommy.
Sit yourself down here.

488
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,077
Thank you, Mr. Knudsen.

489
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:44,650
- Had your lunch?
- Lf you call an apple a lunch, I've had it.

490
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:48,413
Pretty soon now I've got to take my walk.

491
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:52,855
- You'll walk with me maybe after you eat?
- Sure, I'd love to.

492
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:55,120
Say, Major Tommy, uh, could you...

493
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,129
...maybe arrange for me
to take swimming lessons?

494
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:02,235
Oh, now, Mr. Knudsen,
I've seen you swim and very good too.

495
00:42:02,403 --> 00:42:06,669
I would swim better with such a teacher.

496
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:12,106
- Hello, teacher.
- Hello.

497
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,144
- Here, take my place.
- Oh, no.

498
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:15,907
Oh, yes. I'm finished with it.

499
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:18,176
I'd like to introduce you,
but I don't know your name.

500
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:21,014
- Mrs. Delbar.
- Mrs. Delbar, this is Mr. Knudsen.

501
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,656
Oh, how do you do?
I've enjoyed your singing.

502
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:26,224
- And I have enjoyed your swimming.
- Thank you.

503
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:29,328
<i>Au revoir, I'll see you some more.</i>

504
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:33,726
This champ can punch a little,
but if we meet, he'll never hit me.

505
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:35,493
Hey, you try it. Go on, Maude.

506
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:38,638
Right here, right here.
Hey. Oh.

507
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:45,537
Oh, by the way,
my name is Milvaine, Thomas.

508
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,672
You know, I rather thought it might be.

509
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:53,045
- What would you like?
- How did it feel?

510
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,051
- When?
- Oh, when you were drifting around...

511
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:57,816
...on the ocean on a tiny raft
for days and days.

512
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,323
Uncomfortable.

513
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,688
Mm, chicken salad.
Would you like that?

514
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:05,161
We got some very nice
boiled beef and potatoes.

515
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,357
But we don't like
boiled beef and potatoes.

516
00:43:07,534 --> 00:43:09,468
It's just like your mother used to make.

517
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:12,333
My mother never cooked
boiled beef and potatoes.

518
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:17,301
- Chicken salad?
- Yes, please.

519
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:20,106
- Weren't you scared?
- Not a bit.

520
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:23,580
Scared? Of course, I was scared.
Wouldn't you be?

521
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:25,742
Certainly, and I can swim.

522
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:28,581
Well, I'm taking lessons.

523
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:31,316
How about iced coffee
and huckleberry pie?

524
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:32,550
Fine.

525
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:37,795
You should have ordered
the boiled beef and potatoes.

526
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:43,833
- What did you think about on the raft?
- Iced coffee and huckleberry pie...

527
00:43:44,004 --> 00:43:45,801
...and the girl I hope to marry.

528
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:47,372
Tell me about her.

529
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:51,577
- I can't.
- Why not? Who is she?

530
00:43:51,745 --> 00:43:55,374
I don't know, I haven't met her yet.
I've just thought about her.

531
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,813
You know what bothered me
when I was out there...

532
00:43:57,985 --> 00:44:00,215
...bobbing around on the waves?
- What?

533
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,914
It was the thought that I might never
meet her. You see, it got to be night.

534
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:07,652
There were no stars, it began to look
as if she were gonna be a widow...

535
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:12,128
...before she ever was a wife.
I got to feeling pretty sorry for myself.

536
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:15,632
- Did you pray?
- Oh, yes, I prayed and I paddled...

537
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:19,136
...and I paddled and I prayed
and then I looked up and there was George.

538
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:20,898
So I knew I'd be all right.

539
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,269
George? Who's George?

540
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:25,571
My star, we all have stars.
Didn't you know that?

541
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,543
- No.
- You didn't?

542
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:30,650
Why, my mother told me about it
when I was that high.

543
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:32,649
Maybe when I was that high.

544
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:36,282
She said we each have our own star
that watches over us.

545
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:40,359
And we can call on it for help
when we really need help.

546
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:43,860
Well, she showed me my star
and I named it George.

547
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:48,199
Oh, I haven't asked him for help very much,
but that night I did.

548
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:50,234
And there he was.

549
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:52,804
You don't really believe that, do you?

550
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:56,431
Well, all I know is here I am.

551
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,142
You know, you remind me
very much of someone.

552
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:03,249
- Do I? Who? Your husband?
- Oh, no, not at all.

553
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,942
- There's a call for you, Mrs. Delbar.
- From Washington?

554
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,452
- I don't know, ma'am.
- Pardon me.

555
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,283
Hello, is that you, Bob?

556
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,290
Why, no, this is your Uncle Hoby.
How could I be Bob?

557
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,859
He's there with you, isn't he?

558
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:18,657
Oh, uh, yes. Yes, of course,
Bob's here with me.

559
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:21,699
We're eating our swimming pool
by the lunch.

560
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:24,235
She's so happy she doesn't know
what she's saying.

561
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:26,934
Cynthia, dear...

562
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:29,598
...I'm sorry to have to call you
at a time like this.

563
00:45:29,777 --> 00:45:31,938
But your Aunt Nona's
in such a dither...

564
00:45:32,112 --> 00:45:35,138
- Oh, I am not, Cynthia. Don't...
- She is so.

565
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,782
She's lost her spectacles...

566
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,713
...and thought you might know
where they are.

567
00:45:38,886 --> 00:45:41,286
Well, I'm afraid I don't, darling.

568
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:43,320
Uh, did she look in her pockets?

569
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,856
Yes, I looked in all my pockets.

570
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:49,424
- Did you look in the icebox?
- No.

571
00:45:49,596 --> 00:45:52,463
- Do you think they're there?
- Well, that's where they were...

572
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:53,895
...last time you lost them.

573
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,501
Oh, thank you, dear.
I'll look in the icebox.

574
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,299
Goodbye, kiss Uncle Hoby for me.

575
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:04,043
They're such children.

576
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:08,880
You said that I reminded you
of somebody. Who?

577
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:11,074
Oh, that's who, Uncle Hoby.

578
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:15,552
- Do you like your Uncle Hoby?
- Oh, yes, I adore him.

579
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:36,867
Young people.

580
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,410
I think I'm going to sit myself down here.

581
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,241
Is that all the exercise
you're gonna take?

582
00:46:41,415 --> 00:46:44,873
Unh, exercise is only for athletes.

583
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,681
You go on with your walk,
and on the way back, you wake me up.

584
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:52,553
- Okay.
- And you don't need to hurry.

585
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:01,063
I think he's a darling.

586
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:05,137
So do I. He and I have become
very good friends.

587
00:47:05,305 --> 00:47:08,172
Growing wild.
They're a garden flower back home.

588
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:12,339
- Where's back home?
- Omira, Nebraska.

589
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:15,812
<i>- What did you do in Omira, Nebraska?
- I ran the Express.</i>

590
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:18,645
Oh, it wasn't this kind
of an express: Toot, toot.

591
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:20,116
Oh, a newspaper.

592
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:24,246
Yep, the biggest and only newspaper
in Omira, Nebraska.

593
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:28,192
Published every Friday, some Fridays.

594
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:32,264
- Are you going back there?
- Oh, I hope so, some day.

595
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,798
Don't you want a bigger paper
in a bigger city?

596
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:36,435
Ha, ha, no.

597
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,764
- You'd make more money.
- I'd have less fun.

598
00:47:40,207 --> 00:47:42,675
You know, I know you'd like
my Uncle Hoby.

599
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:44,902
You two would get along
very well together.

600
00:47:45,078 --> 00:47:48,673
- What does he do?
- He collects headlines.

601
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:51,044
- He does, really.
- Funny ones?

602
00:47:51,218 --> 00:47:52,845
Maybe I'll send him some of mine.

603
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,887
Here's one I remember about
a cattle stampede:

604
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:57,956
"Colonel Unhorsed by a Cow. "

605
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:00,850
Think he'd like being unhorsed
by a cow?

606
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,389
He'd love it. Thank you...

607
00:48:05,732 --> 00:48:07,597
Shall we canter?

608
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,020
<i>You</i>

609
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:35,627
<i>You came to me</i>

610
00:48:35,796 --> 00:48:42,668
<i>In my long, lonely night</i>

611
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:47,000
<i>When I could not see</i>

612
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:53,636
<i>Without love's magic light</i>

613
00:48:54,414 --> 00:48:58,009
<i>Radiant and fair</i>

614
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:02,679
<i>Stars in your hair</i>

615
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:08,817
<i>You lit my way</i>

616
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:13,262
<i>Into heaven</i>

617
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:19,099
<i>That sweet heaven</i>

618
00:49:19,272 --> 00:49:25,040
<i>Of your arms</i>

619
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:32,209
<i>And that's where I'll stay</i>

620
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:38,552
<i>Radiant and fair
Stars in your hair</i>

621
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,889
<i>You lit my way</i>

622
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:47,898
<i>Into heaven</i>

623
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:54,763
<i>Lord, sweet heaven</i>

624
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:59,844
<i>Of your arms</i>

625
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:08,111
<i>And that's where I stay</i>

626
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:13,258
Oh, thank you, Mr. Knudsen.

627
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:17,693
- Now, why can't I sing like that?
- At your age, you don't need to.

628
00:50:19,332 --> 00:50:23,632
- Now, watch me, it's easy.
- Yeah, it's easy to watch you.

629
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,702
First of all, you mustn't be afraid
of the water.

630
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:29,433
Put your hands over your head
when you start to dive...

631
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,101
...and then give yourself a little lift
just before you go into the water...

632
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,645
...and then fall.

633
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:39,018
There, you see?

634
00:50:39,419 --> 00:50:43,116
Now, when you swim,
lift your elbows high...

635
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,656
...your hand goes in the water first.

636
00:50:46,426 --> 00:50:48,621
First, before your elbow.

637
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,159
Palms are down...

638
00:50:52,866 --> 00:50:55,164
...then turn to your back.

639
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:06,205
Hands first here,
and your feet go all the time.

640
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,307
- Elbows high in this too.
- Oh.

641
00:51:21,795 --> 00:51:23,922
Most of all, you gotta relax.

642
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:27,293
Relax.

643
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:39,906
- There. Now you do it.
- Oh.

644
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:57,594
<i>I should care</i>

645
00:51:58,565 --> 00:52:02,797
<i>I should let it upset me</i>

646
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:07,929
<i>I should care</i>

647
00:52:09,142 --> 00:52:13,943
<i>But it just doesn't get me</i>

648
00:52:14,114 --> 00:52:18,517
<i>Maybe I won't find someone</i>

649
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:23,918
<i>As lovely as you</i>

650
00:52:24,124 --> 00:52:29,585
<i>But I should care</i>

651
00:52:29,763 --> 00:52:34,928
<i>And I do</i>

652
00:52:46,613 --> 00:52:49,844
- Good evening, Mr. Knudsen.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Dorsey.

653
00:52:50,016 --> 00:52:53,713
I am enjoying very much your music,
maybe.

654
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,913
Thank you. But I'm sure we'd enjoy
very much some of your music.

655
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,524
I'm sorry.
I am too weak to sing.

656
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:03,686
- Even one song?
- Even one note.

657
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,163
Uh, wait, I might sing for a price.

658
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:09,461
Well, I'm afraid we can't pay
your regular fee.

659
00:53:09,636 --> 00:53:11,228
Uh... Uh.

660
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:15,500
Is... Is... Is Mrs. Fenway around?

661
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:17,802
No, I think she went to bed.

662
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:21,072
Then my price for a song
shall be a steak.

663
00:53:21,248 --> 00:53:24,740
- No.
- As big as that one. Uh, bigger.

664
00:53:24,918 --> 00:53:26,579
Mr. Knudsen, I'll meet your terms.

665
00:53:26,753 --> 00:53:32,089
And there must also be mashed potatoes,
and onions and beer.

666
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:33,521
It's a deal.

667
00:53:33,727 --> 00:53:35,422
What are you gonna sing for us,
Mr. Knudsen?

668
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:37,825
<i>Jeg Elsker Dig, by Grieg.</i>

669
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:40,831
<i>- Jeg Elsker Dig.
- And please make it rare.</i>

670
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:42,832
<i>Jeg Elsker Dig.</i>

671
00:53:43,003 --> 00:53:48,566
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Knudsen
has consented to sing Jeg Elsker Dig.</i>

672
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:53,902
<i>Uh, Jeg Elsker Dig, fellas.</i>

673
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,284
<i>Jeg Elsker Dig.</i>

674
00:54:04,322 --> 00:54:07,018
<i>Oh, Susan, Jeg Elsker Dig, by Grieg.</i>

675
00:54:07,192 --> 00:54:10,650
- What key?
D Major, please.

676
00:54:16,735 --> 00:54:18,703
So that's what you call "I love you. "

677
00:55:11,356 --> 00:55:18,262
<i>For thee alone my every thought is burning</i>

678
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:26,727
<i>Happy my heart if good I bring to thee</i>

679
00:55:31,443 --> 00:55:37,473
<i>Where'er God wills
My path in life be turning</i>

680
00:55:37,649 --> 00:55:43,110
<i>I love but thee
I love but thee</i>

681
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:49,318
<i>I love but thee
Through all eternity</i>

682
00:55:49,494 --> 00:55:56,229
<i>I love</i>

683
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:59,529
<i>But thee</i>

684
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:06,701
<i>Through all eternity</i>

685
00:56:24,062 --> 00:56:27,054
- Nils, did you order this?
- Yes.

686
00:56:27,232 --> 00:56:28,529
How thoughtful of you.

687
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,864
Thank you so much,
a steak is just what I wanted.

688
00:56:36,274 --> 00:56:38,367
Excuse me.

689
00:56:44,783 --> 00:56:46,683
Here's another one.

690
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:51,647
<i>I arise from dreams of thee
In the first sweet sleep of night</i>

691
00:56:51,823 --> 00:56:56,590
<i>When the winds are breathing low
And the stars are shining bright</i>

692
00:56:56,761 --> 00:57:00,288
<i>I arise from dreams of thee
And a spirit in my feet</i>

693
00:57:00,465 --> 00:57:05,402
<i>Had led me... Who knows how?
To thy chamber-window, sweet!</i>

694
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:08,004
- Well, you know that one?
- Shelley.

695
00:57:08,173 --> 00:57:12,439
- Right, you're wonderful.
- Thank you. Got anymore?

696
00:57:13,011 --> 00:57:14,035
Mm-hm.

697
00:57:15,346 --> 00:57:18,008
Yeah. Yeah, here's one.

698
00:57:19,684 --> 00:57:23,916
<i>The moon belongs in the sky
The water in the sea</i>

699
00:57:24,522 --> 00:57:29,323
<i>But to be honest, I don't greatly care
If they are where they ought to be</i>

700
00:57:29,494 --> 00:57:30,620
<i>If you are with me</i>

701
00:57:31,496 --> 00:57:34,590
- I don't know that one. Who wrote it?
- Milvaine.

702
00:57:34,766 --> 00:57:37,234
- Who?
- T. Milvaine.

703
00:57:37,402 --> 00:57:39,370
- You?
- Me.

704
00:57:40,772 --> 00:57:43,263
- When?
- Just now.

705
00:57:47,378 --> 00:57:50,870
It's getting a little chilly.
I think I'll go inside.

706
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:56,518
- Good night, Tommy.
- Good night.

707
00:58:07,198 --> 00:58:11,225
- Oh, hello, Mr. Knudsen.
- Hello, Major Tommy.

708
00:58:11,402 --> 00:58:14,064
I know just how you feel.

709
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:16,799
Was the one you couldn't have
very beautiful?

710
00:58:16,975 --> 00:58:20,001
The most beautiful thing I ever saw.

711
00:58:20,178 --> 00:58:21,805
With a husband?

712
00:58:22,247 --> 00:58:25,375
With onions and mashed potatoes.

713
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,460
- Mr. Knudsen?
- Yes, Lyonel.

714
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:15,360
- You were in fine voice the other night.
- Thank you.

715
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,626
- Mr. Knudsen.
- Yes.

716
00:59:17,802 --> 00:59:20,794
- I sing too.
- You do? Good.

717
00:59:20,972 --> 00:59:25,409
I'd like to hear you. Well, go ahead.

718
00:59:25,576 --> 00:59:27,669
Now?

719
00:59:27,845 --> 00:59:29,472
Here?

720
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:31,706
In front of you?

721
00:59:43,628 --> 00:59:45,357
L... I... Excuse me.

722
01:00:15,026 --> 01:00:18,928
What time does, uh,
Bob get in tomorrow?

723
01:00:19,597 --> 01:00:22,157
He said he's be here in time for dinner.

724
01:00:22,567 --> 01:00:25,468
Cynthia, I wanna thank you
for a very pleasant week.

725
01:00:25,636 --> 01:00:30,096
I wasn't having much fun here,
then you arrived and you were very friendly.

726
01:00:30,274 --> 01:00:32,572
Oh, you were a big help to me too,
Tommy.

727
01:00:32,744 --> 01:00:36,145
I'd have been quite lonely
if I hadn't picked you up in the pool.

728
01:00:36,314 --> 01:00:39,943
- Oh, but I picked you up.
- Well, we picked each other up.

729
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:42,742
And now we have to put
each other down.

730
01:00:43,921 --> 01:00:45,445
Of course.

731
01:00:45,957 --> 01:00:48,892
But we did have a very amusing week,
didn't we?

732
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,960
I had a very beautiful week.

733
01:00:51,129 --> 01:00:54,189
And it's not quite over.
There's still tonight.

734
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,196
- Well, time for your swimming lesson.
- My graduation exercises.

735
01:01:00,371 --> 01:01:02,202
- Are you ready?
- Fairly ready.

736
01:01:02,373 --> 01:01:03,840
All right, let's go.

737
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:06,973
Let's go.

738
01:02:19,884 --> 01:02:24,378
You see, he swings and I duck,
and then I... Hey, you're not listening.

739
01:02:24,555 --> 01:02:27,820
No. I've heard it all twice.
Now, go away.

740
01:02:27,992 --> 01:02:29,482
- Huh?
- Far away.

741
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,220
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- You're the matter.

742
01:02:32,396 --> 01:02:33,761
What?

743
01:02:35,566 --> 01:02:38,228
Oh, no. He's the matter with you.

744
01:02:38,402 --> 01:02:40,267
It's a case of sour apples,
that's what it is.

745
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:41,462
Oh, go away.

746
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:44,005
- Go away and knock yourself out.
- Now...

747
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:52,582
Oh, but it is nice to be in love.

748
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,775
- Sometimes.
- Always.

749
01:02:54,952 --> 01:02:58,888
- You speak as an expert.
- I do. An expert is what I am.

750
01:02:59,056 --> 01:03:01,354
You should be.
You've been in love often enough.

751
01:03:01,526 --> 01:03:04,927
Not often enough,
but as often as possible.

752
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:08,554
I remember every girl
as if she were yesterday.

753
01:03:08,733 --> 01:03:11,566
What a memory.
And I daresay, there were...

754
01:03:11,736 --> 01:03:13,704
Dozens and dozens.

755
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:17,068
You see, I went on long tours
with opera companies.

756
01:03:17,241 --> 01:03:19,368
Could I sing all the time?

757
01:03:19,544 --> 01:03:23,173
I'm glad I fell in love so much.
It's good for the voice.

758
01:03:23,347 --> 01:03:27,647
Besides, it gives me something
to think about now.

759
01:03:29,887 --> 01:03:34,915
Now, stop looking wistful.
You know you can't have any beer.

760
01:03:37,395 --> 01:03:41,354
- People can love what they can't have.
- Yes. But they shouldn't.

761
01:03:41,532 --> 01:03:45,662
- And don't you be a gossip.
- I just made a remark.

762
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:54,102
- What time are you leaving tomorrow?
- In the morning, early, quite early.

763
01:03:54,278 --> 01:03:55,643
Where are you going?

764
01:03:55,813 --> 01:03:59,647
Oh, I thought I'd spend the rest of my leave
at some place by the ocean.

765
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:02,479
I wanna see if I can swim
in salt water too.

766
01:04:02,653 --> 01:04:06,020
- Telegram for you, Mrs. Delbar.
- Thank you.

767
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,885
- Excuse me.
- Uh-huh.

768
01:04:20,004 --> 01:04:24,703
- Not bad news, I hope.
- No, no. Not at all.

769
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:27,844
- You sure?
- Yes.

770
01:04:28,412 --> 01:04:32,314
- You seem upset.
- Well, I'm not. Not a bit.

771
01:04:32,483 --> 01:04:36,078
- Why should I be?
- I don't know. I didn't see the telegram.

772
01:04:36,254 --> 01:04:38,188
You're not going to.

773
01:04:40,491 --> 01:04:43,824
Tommy, what kind of a telegram
would you send your bride?

774
01:04:43,995 --> 01:04:46,964
Not any kind. Not on our honeymoon.

775
01:04:47,965 --> 01:04:50,991
Oh, I'm sorry. I know he had to go.

776
01:04:51,602 --> 01:04:52,626
Hey, wait a minute.

777
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,602
Help, Maude.

778
01:05:03,447 --> 01:05:04,471
Poor K.O.

779
01:05:04,649 --> 01:05:07,049
Muscles, muscles, everywhere,
but none in his head.

780
01:05:07,218 --> 01:05:08,810
- What happened?
- I pushed him in.

781
01:05:08,986 --> 01:05:10,214
Oh.

782
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:12,617
Uh... Uh.

783
01:05:15,926 --> 01:05:21,091
- I think you know Major Milvaine.
- Yes, as well as can be expected.

784
01:05:21,265 --> 01:05:23,961
Anyhow, let's all have
a small but powerful drink.

785
01:05:24,135 --> 01:05:26,797
Oh, not for me, thank you.
I was just going up to my room.

786
01:05:26,971 --> 01:05:28,632
Good night, Maude.
Good night, Tommy.

787
01:05:28,806 --> 01:05:30,865
- But, Cynthia...
- I'll see you in the morning.

788
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:34,034
- I'm leaving very early.
- I'll be up very early. Good night.

789
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:35,610
All right.

790
01:05:40,017 --> 01:05:44,511
- Do you have to go tomorrow?
- Oh, yes.

791
01:05:44,689 --> 01:05:47,749
- For good?
- Yes.

792
01:05:47,925 --> 01:05:49,654
Whose good?

793
01:05:50,828 --> 01:05:53,388
- You are, aren't you?
- I'm what?

794
01:05:53,564 --> 01:05:54,588
In love with her.

795
01:05:54,765 --> 01:05:56,596
Ha, ha. No.

796
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:59,395
Scotch and soda, please.
- The same for me.

797
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:02,368
- She's very attractive.
- She's very married.

798
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,940
Oh, I'm talking about love.

799
01:06:05,242 --> 01:06:06,504
Please get this straight.

800
01:06:06,677 --> 01:06:10,374
- I am not in love with Mrs. Delbar.
- All right. I believe you.

801
01:06:10,548 --> 01:06:13,540
Not because you say so,
but because you're passing up a chance...

802
01:06:13,718 --> 01:06:16,152
...to be with her for another week,
maybe longer.

803
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,413
When I talked to my father
on the telephone...

804
01:06:18,589 --> 01:06:20,750
...he didn't know
when he could get out here.

805
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:23,655
But I don't quite understand
what your father has to do with this.

806
01:06:23,828 --> 01:06:26,058
That's why Bob Delbar's waiting,
isn't it?

807
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,993
So that he can come out with Dad?

808
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:32,294
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

809
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:36,899
<i>Please don't say no</i>

810
01:06:37,074 --> 01:06:40,066
<i>Say maybe</i>

811
01:06:40,244 --> 01:06:43,771
<i>Or say come back in the spring</i>

812
01:06:43,948 --> 01:06:50,114
<i>Say any old thing
But don't say no</i>

813
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:54,148
<i>Please don't say no</i>

814
01:06:54,325 --> 01:06:57,294
<i>'Cause, baby</i>

815
01:06:57,461 --> 01:07:01,022
<i>I've so much love to impart</i>

816
01:07:01,198 --> 01:07:05,828
<i>It's making my heart overflow</i>

817
01:07:06,103 --> 01:07:09,300
<i>Be sweet and kind</i>

818
01:07:09,473 --> 01:07:13,307
<i>And keep this thought in mind</i>

819
01:07:13,477 --> 01:07:16,173
<i>While you think it over</i>

820
01:07:16,347 --> 01:07:20,545
So it is you. I thought so.
Come on.

821
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:24,313
Now, what are you going to sing for us,
Lyonel?

822
01:07:24,488 --> 01:07:25,648
"Because. "

823
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:28,917
- Is that okay with you?
- Surely. We'll follow him.

824
01:07:37,768 --> 01:07:42,933
<i>Because you come to me</i>

825
01:07:43,107 --> 01:07:47,134
<i>With naught save love</i>

826
01:07:47,311 --> 01:07:49,370
<i>And hold my hand</i>

827
01:07:49,547 --> 01:07:53,711
<i>And lift mine eyes above</i>

828
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:59,651
<i>A wider world of hope and joy I see</i>

829
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:03,687
<i>Because</i>

830
01:08:03,861 --> 01:08:08,594
<i>You come to me</i>

831
01:08:15,372 --> 01:08:21,072
<i>Because you speak to me
In accents sweet</i>

832
01:08:21,245 --> 01:08:26,808
<i>I find the roses
Wakening by my feet</i>

833
01:08:27,251 --> 01:08:31,017
<i>And I am led through tears</i>

834
01:08:31,188 --> 01:08:34,646
<i>And joy to thee</i>

835
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,626
<i>Because</i>

836
01:08:38,796 --> 01:08:45,793
<i>You speak to me</i>

837
01:08:50,007 --> 01:08:55,775
<i>Because God made thee mine</i>

838
01:08:55,946 --> 01:09:00,645
<i>I'll cherish thee</i>

839
01:09:00,818 --> 01:09:03,651
<i>Through light and darkness</i>

840
01:09:03,821 --> 01:09:07,257
<i>Through all time to be</i>

841
01:09:07,992 --> 01:09:14,625
<i>And pray his love
May make our love divine</i>

842
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:18,325
<i>Because</i>

843
01:09:18,502 --> 01:09:22,268
<i>God made thee</i>

844
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:28,708
<i>Mine</i>

845
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:47,121
Cynthia.

846
01:09:49,967 --> 01:09:52,128
Cynthia, you come out
or I'll come in.

847
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,435
Tommy, let's say goodbye in the morning.

848
01:09:58,609 --> 01:10:01,806
- May I come over there?
- No. You know the rule. No hedgehopping.

849
01:10:01,979 --> 01:10:04,675
- Oh, Cynthia. You know, you...
- Now, you stay right there...

850
01:10:04,848 --> 01:10:06,577
...and not so loud, please.

851
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:08,650
Well, can you hear me
way over there?

852
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:11,287
Perfectly. Well?

853
01:10:12,389 --> 01:10:14,914
Well, I'm not going away tomorrow.

854
01:10:15,092 --> 01:10:17,890
I've decided to stay another week.
Maybe longer.

855
01:10:18,062 --> 01:10:20,622
In fact, just as long as I can.

856
01:10:21,765 --> 01:10:25,166
Oh, say you're glad or sorry
or something.

857
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:28,666
I'm glad or sorry or something.

858
01:10:28,839 --> 01:10:31,933
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- You'll see me now.

859
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,571
You know Bob won't be here,
don't you?

860
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:39,910
I heard so. No, not from you.
Why didn't you tell me?

861
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:42,643
I knew you'd stay.

862
01:10:43,854 --> 01:10:45,685
You don't want me to?

863
01:10:46,523 --> 01:10:49,356
- Yes, Tommy, I want you to stay.
- Well...

864
01:10:49,526 --> 01:10:50,754
On your side of the hedge.

865
01:10:51,662 --> 01:10:56,895
- Oh, always?
- Always.

866
01:10:57,067 --> 01:11:00,036
So you see, you might just as well leave
as soon as you can.

867
01:11:02,139 --> 01:11:04,539
No. I don't quite see it that way.

868
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:08,043
Tommy, no matter how long
my husband's away...

869
01:11:08,212 --> 01:11:10,203
...I'm not going to let you make love
to me.

870
01:11:11,849 --> 01:11:15,945
Oh, Cynthia, I love you too much
to want you for just a little while.

871
01:11:19,556 --> 01:11:21,922
Please remember what I said
if you do stay.

872
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:25,595
All right, but I'm going to stay.

873
01:11:28,332 --> 01:11:31,597
All right, but don't forget the hedge.

874
01:11:51,488 --> 01:11:54,685
I wanna make a long-distance call
to Washington.

875
01:11:54,858 --> 01:11:57,759
Mr. Robert G. Delbar
at the Hotel Grand View.

876
01:12:01,665 --> 01:12:04,657
Hello? Hmm?

877
01:12:05,135 --> 01:12:06,727
Oh, Cynthia. Hello, dear.

878
01:12:06,904 --> 01:12:09,600
Bob, can you come back right away?

879
01:12:10,107 --> 01:12:11,301
Huh?

880
01:12:11,475 --> 01:12:13,102
Why? Anything the matter?

881
01:12:13,877 --> 01:12:17,438
No, no, everything's fine. I'm fine. But...

882
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:20,911
- Oh, Bob, I'm lonesome.
- Well, so am I, darling.

883
01:12:21,085 --> 01:12:24,612
But I'll have to ask you to be patient
just a little longer.

884
01:12:24,788 --> 01:12:28,121
But you can't expect me to leave
in the middle of a big deal.

885
01:12:28,592 --> 01:12:31,254
The sensible thing for you to do
is to meet some people...

886
01:12:31,428 --> 01:12:34,864
...and find some things to do.
And I'll be with you just as soon as I can.

887
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,563
All right, Bob. Good night.

888
01:15:03,046 --> 01:15:05,844
- Oh, hello.
- Hello, Mr. Knudsen.

889
01:15:06,016 --> 01:15:09,975
- I'm awfully happy to find you here.
- I am happy myself to be here.

890
01:15:10,153 --> 01:15:13,418
- Maybe I can get you a drink.
- Oh, yes, please.

891
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:17,788
And hold my hand and don't let it go
until it's another day.

892
01:15:17,961 --> 01:15:21,294
- It is sweet and it is sad.
- What is?

893
01:15:21,465 --> 01:15:26,164
That a beautiful woman should look at me
as a perfect chaperone.

894
01:15:26,336 --> 01:15:28,702
Oh, come on, darling.

895
01:15:29,806 --> 01:15:34,539
Darling, meet the boys.
Boys, meet Mrs. Delbar.

896
01:15:34,711 --> 01:15:37,771
How do you do?
- Mrs. Delbar.

897
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:41,042
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you. To you.

898
01:15:41,218 --> 01:15:43,083
Good cheer.

899
01:15:51,194 --> 01:15:54,220
No. Don't look like that.

900
01:15:54,798 --> 01:15:58,325
Look like this.
I'm going to cheer you up.

901
01:15:58,502 --> 01:16:00,163
<i>Let's all drink a toast</i>

902
01:16:00,337 --> 01:16:02,066
<i>And be happy and gay</i>

903
01:16:04,308 --> 01:16:07,368
<i>I'll sing you a song
And the music will play</i>

904
01:16:19,256 --> 01:16:22,783
<i>Let's have a good time
And let's everyone sing</i>

905
01:16:25,162 --> 01:16:28,359
<i>For we never know
What tomorrow may bring</i>

906
01:16:40,544 --> 01:16:44,310
<i>We'll drown all our sorrows
And be of good cheer</i>

907
01:16:46,516 --> 01:16:50,213
<i>Who cares if it's wine
Or a big stein of beer</i>

908
01:17:02,332 --> 01:17:05,733
<i>Now this is the night
For us all to rejoice</i>

909
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:11,432
<i>So you raise your glasses
And I'll raise my voice</i>

910
01:17:13,443 --> 01:17:16,640
<i>Drink up everybody
If you're feeling dry</i>

911
01:17:16,813 --> 01:17:20,044
<i>Come on, bottoms up
Here is mud in your eye</i>

912
01:17:34,264 --> 01:17:39,292
<i>Hurray</i>

913
01:17:46,543 --> 01:17:49,808
- Good morning, Mr. Knudsen.
- Good morning.

914
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:52,005
- Lovely night, wasn't it?
- Lovely.

915
01:17:52,182 --> 01:17:55,777
- Oh, and it's such a lovely day.
- Ah, lovely.

916
01:17:57,154 --> 01:17:59,622
- Good morning, Maude.
- Good morning.

917
01:18:00,057 --> 01:18:02,184
- Good morning, Oscar.
- Good morning.

918
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:06,227
- Lovely day, isn't it?
- It might rain yet.

919
01:18:08,231 --> 01:18:10,859
Uh, has Major Milvaine
been down to breakfast yet?

920
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:14,094
No, Mrs. Delbar,
I haven't seen him today.

921
01:18:26,049 --> 01:18:29,143
Will you ring Major Milvaine's room
please?

922
01:18:31,354 --> 01:18:33,117
Checked out?

923
01:18:33,623 --> 01:18:35,488
Last night?

924
01:18:36,726 --> 01:18:38,353
Thank you.

925
01:18:57,747 --> 01:19:01,114
- He will not be here?
- No.

926
01:19:01,284 --> 01:19:02,876
Won't you have breakfast with me?

927
01:19:03,053 --> 01:19:08,252
I've had mine. One glass of orange juice.
A little one.

928
01:19:08,425 --> 01:19:10,950
One egg. A little one.

929
01:19:11,128 --> 01:19:13,153
He has gone away?

930
01:19:14,664 --> 01:19:17,326
Mr. Knudsen,
do you really have to diet?

931
01:19:17,501 --> 01:19:20,197
A doctor said I would be weller.

932
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:22,964
Just bring me some coffee, Oscar.

933
01:19:23,607 --> 01:19:25,700
See that man over there?

934
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,673
Who couldn't?

935
01:19:30,113 --> 01:19:32,013
Why don't you ask him
if you have to diet?

936
01:19:32,182 --> 01:19:34,173
He's one of the biggest stomach men
in the country.

937
01:19:34,351 --> 01:19:37,650
- I can see that.
- No, I mean he's a doctor, and a good one.

938
01:19:37,821 --> 01:19:41,917
Oh, he looks like a man
who would understand me.

939
01:19:42,092 --> 01:19:45,960
Now, maybe I can help you, maybe.

940
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:49,860
I don't want to butt my nose
into none of my business...

941
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:52,467
...but you have got trouble too.

942
01:19:52,636 --> 01:19:56,003
- No.
- Yes, I know.

943
01:19:56,173 --> 01:19:58,937
I have lived a lot and looked a lot...

944
01:19:59,109 --> 01:20:02,601
...and felt a lot and I know.

945
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:04,679
Please ask me something.

946
01:20:04,915 --> 01:20:07,315
I'll be all right. I've made up my mind.

947
01:20:07,484 --> 01:20:12,512
Your mind, what's minds?
Just things to think with.

948
01:20:12,689 --> 01:20:15,988
It's here you feel.
Have you made up your heart?

949
01:20:18,328 --> 01:20:22,924
Little young Mrs. Delbar,
in my life I have done good things...

950
01:20:23,099 --> 01:20:24,828
...and I have done bad things.

951
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:28,937
But I am only a little sorry
now for the things I did.

952
01:20:29,105 --> 01:20:32,939
I am very sorry for the things I didn't did.

953
01:20:36,146 --> 01:20:42,949
Oh, that is all I will say.
Forgive me for saying so much. Will you?

954
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:45,053
Of course. Excuse me.

955
01:21:02,305 --> 01:21:08,107
- To your very good health.
- To yours. I love you.

956
01:21:09,112 --> 01:21:11,740
Nils, what are you doing?

957
01:21:11,915 --> 01:21:13,746
Doctor's orders.

958
01:21:14,084 --> 01:21:17,611
<i>Ooleeay, ooleeay, ooleeay</i>

959
01:21:17,787 --> 01:21:19,311
<i>Some more beer</i>

960
01:21:19,489 --> 01:21:21,252
<i>Ooleeay, ooleeay</i>

961
01:21:21,424 --> 01:21:24,120
<i>More beer right away</i>

962
01:21:24,294 --> 01:21:28,958
<i>For I want what I want when I want it</i>

963
01:21:29,132 --> 01:21:33,865
<i>That's all that makes life worthwhile</i>

964
01:21:34,037 --> 01:21:39,942
<i>For the wine that tonight
Fills my soul with delight</i>

965
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:45,138
<i>On the morrow may seem to me vile</i>

966
01:21:45,315 --> 01:21:50,514
<i>There's no worldly pleasure myself I deny</i>

967
01:21:50,687 --> 01:21:57,559
<i>There's no one to ask me
Wherefore or why</i>

968
01:21:57,927 --> 01:22:04,799
<i>I eat when I'm hungry</i>

969
01:22:04,968 --> 01:22:09,598
<i>And drink when I'm dry</i>

970
01:22:09,773 --> 01:22:14,733
<i>For I want what I want when I want it</i>

971
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:19,780
<i>I want what I want</i>

972
01:22:19,949 --> 01:22:25,478
<i>When I want it</i>

973
01:22:28,491 --> 01:22:31,722
Major Milvaine,
are you going to be back with us again?

974
01:22:31,895 --> 01:22:35,262
- For a while, I hope. Hello, Mr. Knudsen.
- Hello.

975
01:22:35,432 --> 01:22:36,729
Mm-hm.

976
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,061
- Doctor's orders.
- Will you join us?

977
01:22:39,235 --> 01:22:41,328
No, thank you, Mrs. Fenway.

978
01:22:43,306 --> 01:22:45,365
Excuse me.

979
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:48,937
Hello, Major Tommy.

980
01:22:49,713 --> 01:22:54,082
Why don't you go for a walk
on the sunset trail?

981
01:22:55,452 --> 01:22:57,079
Thank you.

982
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:05,151
<i>I eat when I am hungry</i>

983
01:23:05,328 --> 01:23:07,762
Some of your boiled beef and potatoes.

984
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:12,459
Yes, sir, boiled beef and...
Boiled beef and potatoes?

985
01:23:12,635 --> 01:23:15,536
Ooh, one boiled beef coming up.

986
01:23:15,705 --> 01:23:18,503
One boiled beef coming up.

987
01:23:23,113 --> 01:23:27,140
I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Delbar
is not in the hotel right now.

988
01:23:27,317 --> 01:23:31,185
I believe she went out for a walk.
May I take a message?

989
01:23:32,122 --> 01:23:34,147
You will arrive here tomorrow morning?

990
01:23:34,324 --> 01:23:35,348
Yes, Mr. Delbar.

991
01:23:35,525 --> 01:23:38,688
I'll see that she gets your message.
Goodbye.

992
01:23:44,901 --> 01:23:47,028
Cynthia!

993
01:23:51,908 --> 01:23:53,899
Tommy.

994
01:24:00,483 --> 01:24:02,007
Well, hello.

995
01:24:02,519 --> 01:24:06,011
I had to come back.
Please let me stay, on your terms.

996
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:08,350
No, hedgehopping, no, no anything.

997
01:24:08,525 --> 01:24:11,119
We won't talk about us.
If you just let me see you...

998
01:24:11,294 --> 01:24:15,128
...and be near you and walk with you,
I won't talk at all.

999
01:24:16,299 --> 01:24:18,324
You could say a word or two.

1000
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:28,943
How was the ocean?

1001
01:24:29,112 --> 01:24:31,740
Very large and very lonesome.

1002
01:24:31,915 --> 01:24:33,348
Now, Tommy.

1003
01:24:33,516 --> 01:24:35,746
Well, you asked for it.

1004
01:24:53,903 --> 01:24:57,430
Oh, look, what a darling little brook.

1005
01:24:59,108 --> 01:25:00,166
Shh.

1006
01:25:00,543 --> 01:25:02,773
It thinks it's a waterfall.

1007
01:25:02,946 --> 01:25:04,345
Maybe we discovered it.

1008
01:25:04,514 --> 01:25:06,539
Yeah, maybe.

1009
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:15,723
I don't remember this part of the woods.

1010
01:25:15,892 --> 01:25:18,725
I don't think we ever came this far before.

1011
01:25:18,895 --> 01:25:21,125
We'd better be turning back pretty soon.

1012
01:25:21,297 --> 01:25:24,130
I guess so, before the light goes.

1013
01:25:26,903 --> 01:25:29,030
Look, somebody's been here before.

1014
01:25:29,973 --> 01:25:33,932
A loves E.
That's the history of the world.

1015
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:36,943
Adam loves Eve. Albert loves Emily.

1016
01:25:37,113 --> 01:25:38,341
Alice loves Eddie.

1017
01:25:38,515 --> 01:25:43,043
Yes, that happens too.
This was done years ago.

1018
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,547
I wonder where they are now.
Did they marry and live happily ever after?

1019
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:49,817
Do they still love each other?

1020
01:25:51,127 --> 01:25:52,754
Or did they part?

1021
01:25:55,532 --> 01:25:58,558
Oh, Tommy, Tommy.

1022
01:26:00,303 --> 01:26:02,533
- You love me.
- No, no.

1023
01:26:02,705 --> 01:26:04,229
Yes, you do.

1024
01:26:04,407 --> 01:26:06,807
Yes, no, I don't know.

1025
01:26:06,976 --> 01:26:09,137
You know I love you.

1026
01:26:09,312 --> 01:26:11,143
Tommy, what am I gonna do?

1027
01:26:11,314 --> 01:26:12,508
Tell Bob about us.

1028
01:26:12,682 --> 01:26:14,946
- No, I can't.
- Then I will.

1029
01:26:15,118 --> 01:26:17,109
- No, no, you mustn't.
- Why not?

1030
01:26:17,921 --> 01:26:21,550
Because I'm not sure about us.
I'm not sure about anything.

1031
01:26:21,724 --> 01:26:27,128
I am. I'm sure you're the girl
I've always thought about, waited for.

1032
01:26:28,131 --> 01:26:31,532
Oh, I've got to be fair to Bob.
Give our marriage a chance...

1033
01:26:31,701 --> 01:26:33,931
...give him a chance and I'm going to.

1034
01:26:34,103 --> 01:26:36,128
But, Cynthia darling.

1035
01:26:36,306 --> 01:26:40,936
No, Tommy.
There's only one way out of this.

1036
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:44,170
We've got to say goodbye
and mean it.

1037
01:26:45,281 --> 01:26:47,545
I couldn't mean it.

1038
01:26:47,717 --> 01:26:51,380
I can because I know I must.

1039
01:26:52,121 --> 01:26:54,112
Now, we're going back to the hotel...

1040
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:59,125
...and just as soon as we get there,
I want you to go away...

1041
01:26:59,295 --> 01:27:01,786
...and I don't want you to come back
ever.

1042
01:27:03,533 --> 01:27:08,266
Please don't, Tommy.
Take me back now.

1043
01:27:10,306 --> 01:27:12,103
All right.

1044
01:27:26,856 --> 01:27:29,347
We came past this tree.

1045
01:27:29,525 --> 01:27:31,516
Now we go to the left.

1046
01:27:31,694 --> 01:27:34,822
- No, to the right.
- No, the left.

1047
01:27:35,665 --> 01:27:37,929
Tommy, I think
we're going in the wrong direction.

1048
01:27:38,101 --> 01:27:39,932
No.
We came from the east, didn't we?

1049
01:27:40,103 --> 01:27:42,537
- Yes.
- Obviously we must go east.

1050
01:27:42,705 --> 01:27:44,332
But are we going east?

1051
01:27:44,507 --> 01:27:46,372
Sure we are.

1052
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:03,090
Now we'll try your way.

1053
01:28:16,172 --> 01:28:17,196
Oh.

1054
01:28:17,373 --> 01:28:19,034
Wait.

1055
01:28:19,509 --> 01:28:22,376
Let's sit down and rest a moment.

1056
01:28:23,312 --> 01:28:25,212
- You know what?
- Hmm.

1057
01:28:25,381 --> 01:28:27,349
I think we're just a little bit lost.

1058
01:28:27,517 --> 01:28:30,384
Oh, no, of course not.

1059
01:28:30,553 --> 01:28:35,115
Can't be much further.
We ought to be there pretty soon now.

1060
01:28:35,758 --> 01:28:39,091
I was sure
that if we just turned right, that...

1061
01:28:42,098 --> 01:28:47,126
Yup. Same old tree.
Well, anyway, we're holding our own.

1062
01:28:47,303 --> 01:28:50,329
And you found your way
out of the jungle?

1063
01:28:50,907 --> 01:28:53,705
Well, it took me a month.

1064
01:28:54,911 --> 01:28:57,311
Let's be on our way.

1065
01:29:07,724 --> 01:29:11,160
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't go another step.

1066
01:29:11,327 --> 01:29:14,228
Well, we'll just camp here till morning.

1067
01:29:14,397 --> 01:29:16,957
I guess we'll have to.

1068
01:29:18,735 --> 01:29:20,202
Oh, no, you take it.

1069
01:29:20,369 --> 01:29:22,234
No, you take it.

1070
01:29:25,141 --> 01:29:26,768
What time do you want to be called?

1071
01:29:27,677 --> 01:29:28,871
Daybreak.

1072
01:29:29,045 --> 01:29:31,104
Daybreak.

1073
01:29:35,118 --> 01:29:36,847
Good night, Tommy.

1074
01:29:38,287 --> 01:29:40,118
Good night.

1075
01:30:07,683 --> 01:30:10,208
Hey, look, there's George!

1076
01:30:38,815 --> 01:30:40,510
- Good morning, Mr. Bancroft.
- Good morning.

1077
01:30:40,683 --> 01:30:42,947
- I'm Robert Delbar.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Delbar.

1078
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:45,144
Look, J.P., Praktikon.

1079
01:30:45,321 --> 01:30:48,188
- Well, thank you, thank you.
Hello, Father.

1080
01:30:48,357 --> 01:30:52,521
Hello, Maude, well, did you get up early
or stay up late?

1081
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:54,959
- Both.
- Oh, this is Mr. Delbar. Bob, my daughter.

1082
01:30:55,131 --> 01:30:56,530
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1083
01:30:56,699 --> 01:30:59,634
I've wanted to meet you.
I met your wife. She's very attractive.

1084
01:30:59,802 --> 01:31:01,167
Glad she got to know someone.

1085
01:31:01,337 --> 01:31:04,465
- I didn't want her to be lonesome.
- Oh, I don't think she was too lonesome.

1086
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:08,576
Ha, ha. Bob, why don't you and Mrs. Delbar
have breakfast with us in our suite?

1087
01:31:08,744 --> 01:31:10,371
Thank you. We'd like to very much.

1088
01:31:10,546 --> 01:31:13,310
- I'll get Cynthia and we'll be right in.
- Okay.

1089
01:31:33,302 --> 01:31:35,099
Cynthia.

1090
01:31:37,306 --> 01:31:38,898
Cynthia.

1091
01:32:10,907 --> 01:32:13,307
Well, come in, Bob. Where's the bride?

1092
01:32:13,476 --> 01:32:14,738
- I don't know.
- What?

1093
01:32:14,911 --> 01:32:15,935
I can't find her.

1094
01:32:16,112 --> 01:32:18,307
Well, she's probably
in the hotel somewhere.

1095
01:32:18,481 --> 01:32:20,949
No, she isn't. I asked everybody.
I looked everywhere.

1096
01:32:21,117 --> 01:32:23,278
- Nobody has seen her.
- Wasn't she in her room?

1097
01:32:23,452 --> 01:32:24,942
No, she was not.

1098
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:28,750
It looks very much as though she hadn't
been in her room at all last night.

1099
01:32:28,925 --> 01:32:31,086
- Really?
- Are you sure?

1100
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:34,718
Her bed hadn't been slept in and my phone
message was still under the door.

1101
01:32:34,897 --> 01:32:35,989
What does it look like?

1102
01:32:36,165 --> 01:32:39,328
Well, now, don't upset yourself
by imagining things. Sit down.

1103
01:32:39,502 --> 01:32:42,403
In this case, I'm sure
there's a perfectly simple explanation.

1104
01:32:42,571 --> 01:32:44,971
- Yes, I'm sure there is.
- Yes.

1105
01:32:45,141 --> 01:32:48,406
Miss Bancroft, if you know anything
I should know, please tell me.

1106
01:32:48,577 --> 01:32:51,171
I don't know anything. Really, I don't.

1107
01:32:51,347 --> 01:32:53,372
When did you last see my wife?

1108
01:32:53,549 --> 01:32:56,541
Early last evening, she was starting out
for a walk in the woods.

1109
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:00,382
- Was she alone?
- Yes, she started out alone.

1110
01:33:00,556 --> 01:33:02,319
Maybe she's still in the woods.

1111
01:33:02,491 --> 01:33:05,016
All this time? No, it's not very probable.

1112
01:33:05,194 --> 01:33:06,718
Well, it's possible.

1113
01:33:06,896 --> 01:33:10,059
I think you should send out
searching parties. Don't you, Maude?

1114
01:33:10,232 --> 01:33:13,258
Uh, no, I don't think so. Look.

1115
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:37,516
- Bob.
- Good morning.

1116
01:33:37,693 --> 01:33:41,151
- Oh, Bob, I didn't know you were back.
- Evidently.

1117
01:33:42,198 --> 01:33:44,166
This is Major Milvaine.

1118
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:46,858
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1119
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:50,332
- We got lost.
- Uh, in the woods.

1120
01:33:50,506 --> 01:33:53,339
It got dark and we got lost.

1121
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:56,706
Good and lost.
We walked and walked and...

1122
01:33:56,879 --> 01:33:59,541
- All night?
- No, not all night.

1123
01:33:59,715 --> 01:34:02,878
Oh, we did stop to rest. We had to.

1124
01:34:03,319 --> 01:34:06,618
I'm very sorry this had to happen,
but we couldn't help it.

1125
01:34:06,789 --> 01:34:08,780
Mrs. Delbar went out for a little walk...

1126
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:12,416
...and I went out for a little walk
and we met in the woods.

1127
01:34:12,595 --> 01:34:14,563
So we started walking along together...

1128
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:18,222
...got to talking and didn't watch
the time or notice where we were going...

1129
01:34:18,401 --> 01:34:20,665
...and we finally turned around
and started back.

1130
01:34:20,836 --> 01:34:24,328
It was still light but we didn't know
where we were or where the hotel was.

1131
01:34:24,507 --> 01:34:27,908
She thought it was that way
and I thought it was that way.

1132
01:34:28,077 --> 01:34:29,772
It was neither way.

1133
01:34:29,945 --> 01:34:31,742
Then it got to be pretty dark...

1134
01:34:31,914 --> 01:34:34,280
...and you know how dark
it can get in those woods.

1135
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:36,441
So what could we do?

1136
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:40,516
Now look, Delbar, I don't care
how it looks to you or to anybody else...

1137
01:34:40,689 --> 01:34:44,352
...this was an accident and you have no
right to think it was more than that.

1138
01:34:44,527 --> 01:34:46,495
If you have any sense,
you'll believe me...

1139
01:34:46,662 --> 01:34:49,028
...and you'll believe your wife.
I assure you...

1140
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:51,598
There's no need to assure me anything
about my wife.

1141
01:34:51,767 --> 01:34:53,325
Come, Cynthia.

1142
01:34:55,504 --> 01:34:59,304
- Goodbye, Major Milvaine.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Delbar.

1143
01:35:03,379 --> 01:35:06,473
- Here's your coat.
- Thanks.

1144
01:35:22,098 --> 01:35:24,191
Bob, I'm sorry
I wasn't here to meet you.

1145
01:35:24,366 --> 01:35:26,231
So am I.

1146
01:35:28,704 --> 01:35:31,730
Well, I'll go make myself
more presentable.

1147
01:35:31,907 --> 01:35:35,809
Cynthia, that Major Milvaine,
isn't he the fellow...

1148
01:35:35,978 --> 01:35:39,209
...that had all those things happen to him
in the South Pacific?

1149
01:35:39,381 --> 01:35:40,939
Yes.

1150
01:35:41,117 --> 01:35:43,312
He, uh, got lost in the jungle, didn't he?

1151
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,144
Yes.

1152
01:35:45,321 --> 01:35:48,484
And found his way out of the jungle?

1153
01:35:50,493 --> 01:35:52,893
Yes, took him a month.

1154
01:35:53,496 --> 01:35:56,056
Quite an experience.
Did he tell you much about it?

1155
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,128
No, not much.

1156
01:36:00,302 --> 01:36:02,395
Tommy doesn't talk much about himself.

1157
01:36:02,571 --> 01:36:06,439
Oh, Tommy is an old friend
of yours, hmm?

1158
01:36:07,343 --> 01:36:09,538
No, I...
I met him the night you went away.

1159
01:36:09,712 --> 01:36:11,339
Who introduced you?

1160
01:36:11,881 --> 01:36:13,143
Well, nobody really.

1161
01:36:13,315 --> 01:36:18,582
I was out here on the balcony
and he spoke to me and...

1162
01:36:20,122 --> 01:36:21,817
Neighbors, hmm?

1163
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:23,754
Well, I really must change my clothes.

1164
01:36:23,926 --> 01:36:28,659
Cynthia, he fell in love with you,
didn't he?

1165
01:36:29,331 --> 01:36:30,423
Well, didn't he?

1166
01:36:30,599 --> 01:36:34,228
Bob, please don't cross-examine me
like this. You'll have to trust me.

1167
01:36:34,403 --> 01:36:37,065
You don't expect me to believe
that you and that fellow...

1168
01:36:37,239 --> 01:36:39,537
- Yes, I do.
- Do you think I'm a fool?

1169
01:36:39,708 --> 01:36:41,300
No. No, I don't.

1170
01:36:41,477 --> 01:36:43,843
But I am beginning to think
you're a stuffed shirt.

1171
01:36:44,013 --> 01:36:45,947
- I could call you names.
- You better not.

1172
01:36:46,115 --> 01:36:50,108
I'm glad I found out in time
just how little our marriage meant to you.

1173
01:36:51,921 --> 01:36:54,321
Bob, our marriage
did mean something to me.

1174
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:55,718
It meant a lot.

1175
01:36:55,891 --> 01:36:57,791
I wanted to make a go of it.
I tried to.

1176
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,928
Yes, by falling in love with another man.

1177
01:37:00,095 --> 01:37:03,292
Why don't you tell me the truth?
That is the truth, isn't it?

1178
01:37:05,501 --> 01:37:08,937
Yes. Yes, it is.

1179
01:37:09,104 --> 01:37:12,938
I'll tell you and I'll tell myself.
I am in love with Tommy.

1180
01:37:13,509 --> 01:37:15,909
I'm going to get an annulment
just as soon as I can.

1181
01:37:16,078 --> 01:37:20,481
- You'll be given an adequate settlement.
- No. I don't want any settlement.

1182
01:37:20,649 --> 01:37:25,484
- You don't?
- No. But I'll take that annulment, thank you.

1183
01:37:28,123 --> 01:37:29,818
Bob...

1184
01:37:31,527 --> 01:37:33,324
...don't forget your briefcase.

1185
01:37:50,713 --> 01:37:53,307
Oh, Lyonel, would you,
uh, get my bag please?

1186
01:37:53,482 --> 01:37:56,144
- Yes, major. Major Milvaine?
- Yes.

1187
01:37:56,318 --> 01:37:58,718
You're coat is dirty.
You want me to brush you off?

1188
01:37:58,887 --> 01:38:01,355
No, thanks. I've been brushed off.

1189
01:38:01,523 --> 01:38:03,252
Hello, Major Tommy.

1190
01:38:03,425 --> 01:38:06,121
Oh, hello, Mister Knudsen,
and goodbye.

1191
01:38:06,295 --> 01:38:07,922
- Where do you go?
- To Darwin Field.

1192
01:38:08,097 --> 01:38:09,564
I'm going to be stationed there.

1193
01:38:10,499 --> 01:38:11,727
My young friend...

1194
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:15,233
...I know that you will be unhappy
for a while...

1195
01:38:15,404 --> 01:38:17,804
...but you mustn't be unhappy for long.

1196
01:38:17,973 --> 01:38:20,134
- You must fall in love again.
- Yeah.

1197
01:38:20,309 --> 01:38:22,106
And you will.

1198
01:38:22,278 --> 01:38:24,746
Anyhow, you'll try to.

1199
01:38:24,913 --> 01:38:27,143
Yes, yes, I'll try.
Goodbye, Mister Knudsen.

1200
01:38:27,316 --> 01:38:30,945
- Goodbye and good luck, Major Tommy.
- Thank you.

1201
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:38,719
- Oh, Mr. Delbar. Come in.
- May I use your phone?

1202
01:38:38,894 --> 01:38:40,327
Of course.

1203
01:38:42,698 --> 01:38:46,725
Hello. Hello, get me Austin Demmering
in Los Angeles...

1204
01:38:46,902 --> 01:38:50,167
...Kimball 2-8-9-8.
I'll hold the wire.

1205
01:38:50,572 --> 01:38:52,335
Oh, thanks.

1206
01:38:53,342 --> 01:38:55,310
Get that other little matter settled?

1207
01:38:55,477 --> 01:38:57,502
This is it. I'm getting an annulment.

1208
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:00,148
Yeah, I thought you would.

1209
01:39:00,316 --> 01:39:02,944
- What's it going to cost you?
- Nothing.

1210
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:04,380
Hmm. That's fair enough.

1211
01:39:04,553 --> 01:39:06,384
Uh, hello, Austin, Bob Delbar.

1212
01:39:06,555 --> 01:39:08,955
What do I have to do
to get my marriage annulled?

1213
01:39:09,124 --> 01:39:12,116
Oh, Bob, you are not married again?

1214
01:39:12,294 --> 01:39:15,354
You can't be married.
You aren't divorced.

1215
01:39:15,531 --> 01:39:17,795
You got the divorce a year and a half ago.

1216
01:39:17,966 --> 01:39:21,231
I know, but I never picked up
the final papers and...

1217
01:39:21,403 --> 01:39:24,304
No, no, it's not as bad
as you think it is.

1218
01:39:24,473 --> 01:39:27,135
Now, uh,
take care of this for me right away.

1219
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:30,278
Both, the final decree and the annulment.

1220
01:39:30,446 --> 01:39:31,936
You need a drink.

1221
01:39:32,114 --> 01:39:34,105
Oh, thanks.

1222
01:39:34,283 --> 01:39:36,410
Well, better luck next time.

1223
01:39:36,585 --> 01:39:38,416
Thanks.

1224
01:39:44,626 --> 01:39:46,025
All right.

1225
01:39:48,063 --> 01:39:50,554
- Will you get a car for me, Lyonel?
- Yes, Mrs. Delbar.

1226
01:39:50,733 --> 01:39:53,133
I'll be out as soon as I say goodbye
to Mr. Knudsen.

1227
01:39:53,302 --> 01:39:56,169
He's going to buy me singing lessons.
Isn't he the nicest man?

1228
01:39:56,338 --> 01:39:57,703
Indeed, he is.

1229
01:39:58,307 --> 01:40:01,435
Well, goodbye, Mr. Knudsen.
You've been very kind.

1230
01:40:01,610 --> 01:40:04,704
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

1231
01:40:05,481 --> 01:40:07,073
Alone?

1232
01:40:07,683 --> 01:40:09,776
Everything's over.

1233
01:40:12,621 --> 01:40:15,283
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1234
01:40:16,492 --> 01:40:19,427
Oh, uh, Mrs. Delbar...

1235
01:40:20,095 --> 01:40:22,325
...excuse my curiosity.

1236
01:40:22,498 --> 01:40:24,329
But where do you go?

1237
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:25,933
Home.

1238
01:40:26,101 --> 01:40:29,332
On your way home,
you pass Darwin Field?

1239
01:40:29,505 --> 01:40:30,938
Yes.

1240
01:40:31,106 --> 01:40:34,098
You are stopping there maybe?

1241
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:36,837
No, I think not.

1242
01:40:37,012 --> 01:40:38,604
I think I'll wait a while.

1243
01:40:38,781 --> 01:40:41,716
Then someday, when everything
gets straightened out...

1244
01:40:41,884 --> 01:40:44,876
...maybe Darwin Field
will come to me.

1245
01:40:45,053 --> 01:40:46,714
Goodbye.

1246
01:40:46,889 --> 01:40:48,857
Goodbye.

1247
01:40:52,494 --> 01:40:54,689
It's your move now.

1248
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:08,337
Hello, give me Darwin Field.

1249
01:41:08,510 --> 01:41:12,105
I want to talk to Major Thomas Milvaine.

1250
01:41:20,122 --> 01:41:21,612
Where shall I stand?

1251
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,519
Right inside the gate.

1252
01:41:23,692 --> 01:41:28,129
And please, don't forget to move
your mouth and your arms.

1253
01:41:29,498 --> 01:41:32,399
- Ready?
- Contact.

1254
01:41:32,568 --> 01:41:35,662
- Hit it.
Okay.

1255
01:41:47,883 --> 01:41:51,410
Hoby, turn off the radio, dear.

1256
01:41:51,987 --> 01:41:54,319
- Huh?
- The radio.

1257
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:56,924
Oh, yes, dear.

1258
01:42:02,464 --> 01:42:03,522
It's turned off.

1259
01:42:03,699 --> 01:42:05,462
Well, I can still hear it.

1260
01:42:05,634 --> 01:42:07,465
So can I.

1261
01:42:07,636 --> 01:42:12,073
- Funny.
- Funny? It's uncanny.

1262
01:42:17,913 --> 01:42:21,644
<i>Please don't say no</i>

1263
01:42:21,817 --> 01:42:24,285
<i>Say maybe</i>

1264
01:42:24,453 --> 01:42:27,581
<i>Or say come back in the spring</i>

1265
01:42:27,756 --> 01:42:33,786
<i>Say any old thing
But don't say no</i>

1266
01:42:33,962 --> 01:42:37,523
<i>Please don't say no</i>

1267
01:42:37,699 --> 01:42:40,429
<i>'Cause, baby</i>

1268
01:42:40,602 --> 01:42:44,038
<i>I've so much love to impart</i>

1269
01:42:44,206 --> 01:42:48,939
<i>It's making my heart overflow</i>

1270
01:42:49,111 --> 01:42:52,137
<i>Be sweet and kind</i>

1271
01:42:52,314 --> 01:42:55,750
<i>And keep this thought in mind</i>

1272
01:42:55,918 --> 01:42:57,852
<i>While you think it over</i>

1273
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:04,892
<i>Great loves from little friendships grow</i>

1274
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:10,930
<i>Don't, please don't say no
Say maybe</i>

1275
01:43:11,099 --> 01:43:13,431
- There's a man singing.
- He may be crazy.

1276
01:43:13,602 --> 01:43:15,331
No, it's Tommy.

1277
01:43:15,504 --> 01:43:17,563
You didn't tell us he could sing too.

1278
01:43:17,739 --> 01:43:21,539
<i>Right now I'd settle for less</i>

1279
01:43:21,710 --> 01:43:24,543
<i>Because in time, baby</i>

1280
01:43:24,713 --> 01:43:25,873
He has an accent.

1281
01:43:26,048 --> 01:43:28,243
What does it matter
if they love each other?

1282
01:43:37,659 --> 01:43:41,857
How do you suppose he does that?
Sings and kisses at the same time?

1283
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:43,463
I have no idea.

1284
01:43:48,704 --> 01:43:52,140
<i>Come on, baby</i>

1285
01:43:52,307 --> 01:43:57,677
<i>Don't say no
And don't say maybe</i>

1286
01:43:57,846 --> 01:44:01,782
<i>Make up your mind and say</i>

1287
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:07,650
<i>Yes</i>

1288
01:44:08,305 --> 01:45:08,325
