Hey-o. Check it out. [laughs]

156
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,211
What the hell is this?

157
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:27,560
It's Dee's replacement.

158
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:29,257
Why did you get a monkey?

159
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:32,652
Well, you know, we're gonna hire
a girl to do Dee's job.

160
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:35,525
We're gonna have to pay her. You
don't have to pay a monkey shit,

161
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,483
so I got a monkey instead.

162
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:40,356
It's like I said,
a monkey could do her job.

163
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,705
Okay, but that's
just an expression, Frank.

164
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:43,271
We need an actual person.

165
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:45,361
Oh, yeah? Check this out.

166
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:47,624
-Monkey, beer.
-[monkey chittering]

167
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,411
[Frank laughs]

168
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:54,979
See? Great, huh?

169
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,590
No. No, not great. Ridiculous.

170
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:59,200
You think a monkey
can run a bar?

171
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:00,898
Run a bar?

172
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:03,422
I thought it was just
to do Dee's job.

173
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:05,032
Oh, yeah. We need someone
to watch over the bar

174
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,077
-'cause we're gonna
go on vacation now.
-Right.

175
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,731
-Ooh, vacation?
-Mm-hmm.

176
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:10,211
-Has anybody floated out
Pittsburgh?
-Ah.

177
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:11,517
What is with you guys
and Pittsburgh?

178
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,258
Okay, we're not going
to Pittsburgh.

179
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:14,999
If we're gonna go on vacation,
we're gonna go someplace good.

180
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,261
-[monkey chittering]
-Yeah, thanks.

181
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:17,828
[chuckles]

182
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,220
I mean, we've got
the whole world to choose from,

183
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:20,918
and you guys want to go
to the second-best city

184
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,702
in-in Pennsylvania?
It's crazy. [slurping]

185
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:23,877
Well, I don't know, like,
are we in Pittsburgh right now?

186
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:25,270
Pretty nice. We like Pittsburgh.

187
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:26,402
Like, you know, how does
Pittsburgh work, you know?

188
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:28,447
Whoa, hang on a second now.

189
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,145
That is really good.
What'd the monkey put in this?

190
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,712
[laughs] Beats me.

191
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:34,975
-[chittering]
-DENNIS: Okay, well,

192
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,456
it's-it's very, very delicious,
uh... [laughs]

193
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,457
What's the deal
with this monkey, anyway?

194
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:40,241
He some kind of mixologist?

195
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:41,504
He used to work in the movies.

196
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,375
He comes from a long line
of movie monkeys.

197
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:44,811
Rumor has it

198
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:46,552
that he also did a short stint

199
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:48,598
making drinks for Kitty Dukakis.

200
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,947
-Wow.
-Yeah.
-Okay, okay. Interesting.

201
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,731
You know those were stiff.
[laughs]

202
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:53,341
Eventually, we're gonna need
an actual person

203
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:54,952
to run the bar
if we're gonna go on vacation,

204
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:57,041
you know, but, uh,
while we're landing

205
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,651
on where exactly to go,
let's, uh... [slurps]

206
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:00,392
Mmm.

207
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,481
Let's keep the monkey
around 'cause that is

208
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:05,092
the best beer I've ever had in
my entire life, I swear to God.

209
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:06,485
Dee has never made a beer
that tastes like that.

210
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:07,617
-You guys got to try this.
-[laughs]
-Really?

211
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,314
-I bet, yeah.
-Monkey.

212
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:12,143
-Three more.
-Yeah. All right.

213
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:13,361
-[chittering]
-Look at that.

214
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,061
Hello. Good afternoon.

215
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,280
I'm Deandra Reynolds,

216
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:23,502
and thank you all so much
for joining my acting class.

217
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:24,982
For starters...

218
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:28,115
I don't have a limp.

219
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:30,683
[laughs] Right?

220
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:32,337
Don't be shy.

221
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,600
-Thank you.
-[scattered applause]

222
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:36,950
Thank you so much. Thank you.

223
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:38,778
Oh, here's the thing,

224
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:41,085
the first order of business,

225
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,436
and perhaps the most
important thing, is payment.

226
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,178
Now, did everyone have a chance
to get cash or cashier's check?

227
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:49,006
Okay, good. Great.

228
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:50,573
Great, wonderful.
Okay, well, let's get started.

229
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:51,965
-[pen clicks]
-Chain saw,

230
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,794
avocado, marlin.
What'd I just say? You.

231
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:58,581
Um... chain saw,
avocado, marlin?

232
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:00,104
Right!

233
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,540
Which is wrong.

234
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:05,239
You just violated
the first rule of acting.

235
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:06,458
You listened.

236
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:07,894
When you are listening,

237
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:09,417
you are not talking,

238
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,245
and if you're not talking,
you're not getting paid.

239
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:14,074
You know who doesn't talk
throughout an entire movie?

240
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,336
An extra.

241
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,035
Which brings me
to rule number two,

242
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:20,080
acting is...

243
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,908
Oh, um, reacting.

244
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:25,085
Wrong again. Acting is ignoring.

245
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,478
Think about it.

246
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:27,914
Ignore reality.

247
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,090
You're in a casting office,
not Jurassic Park.

248
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,788
Ignore your scene partner

249
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,964
because you better goddamn
believe they're ignoring you.

250
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:37,010
And, for Christ's sake,
ignore the script, okay?

251
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,186
[chuckles] You're better
than a writer, right?

252
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,231
Writers are dorks, okay?

253
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:42,842
Any questions?

254
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:45,149
No! Put your hands down!

255
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,629
No.

256
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:47,934
Don't ask questions.

257
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:49,370
That shows
you don't know something,

258
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:50,546
which makes you look weak.

259
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,548
Got it?

260
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:54,941
Now, if we could circle back
on the payment thing again,

261
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:57,074
it's pretty important
to me, okay?

262
00:08:57,117 --> 00:08:58,597
'Cause I'm-I'm dead serious,

263
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:02,383
you're not walking out of here
without the payment.

264
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:03,602
Oh, my God, Charlie,

265
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:05,561
we're not going to Scranton.

266
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:07,563
All right, fine. What about
Harrisburg? Williamsport?

267
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:08,738
Altoona? You know...

268
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,435
Okay, will you at least consider

269
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:12,132
going someplace
outside of Pennsylvania?

270
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,222
All those cities
are in Pennsylvania?

271
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,659
Are you kidding me?
Like, you don't want to know--

272
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:17,964
thank you, monkey--
you don't want to know, like,

273
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:19,618
how this shit works, man?

274
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:22,795
No. I don't want to find out
how zoning districts work.

275
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,841
I don't care about that.
Thank you, monkey.

276
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:26,407
I want to go somewhere exotic.

277
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:27,670
Baltimore?

278
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:29,628
-Baltimore is not exotic, Frank.
-DENNIS: No.

279
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:32,283
I'll tell you, I've seen shit
happen in Baltimore

280
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:34,241
-that would blow your mind.
Thank you, monkey.
-Wow.

281
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:35,939
You know what, guys?
I'll tell you what.

282
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:36,896
Regardless of where
we decide to go,

283
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,463
we're taking this goddamn monkey

284
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:40,204
-because I love this guy.
I love him.
-Oh, yeah.

285
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,162
It would be great
if we could hire more monkeys

286
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,164
to do our job for us
while we're gone.

287
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,471
Like, a team of monkeys who run
the bar, you know what I mean?

288
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:49,082
-Mm.
-Oh, yeah, 'cause they're all
out of work now, you know?

289
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:51,041
-CHARLIE: Yeah.
-Yeah, because Hollywood decided

290
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:53,652
you can't beat 'em no more, so
they had to set 'em all free.

291
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:55,132
-What?
-Are you seriously?
-You can't beat monkeys?

292
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,307
-No, you can't.
-At all?

293
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,874
Those monkeys don't even
have jobs anymore

294
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,049
-'cause of these snowflakes?
-Not allowed to do it no more.

295
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,877
-These Hollywood...
-Oh, my God.

296
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,052
I do have to admit, though,

297
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:04,532
it-it is a little
disappointing to, um,

298
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:07,710
discover that a team of primates
could do our jobs for us, but...

299
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:09,320
[stammers]
I'm gonna blow past it

300
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:10,626
because I really do
want to come up

301
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:11,931
with a vacation spot
for us, you know?

302
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,846
So, here's what
I'm thinking, guys.

303
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,631
E-Everybody grab a napkin
there, okay?

304
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:16,457
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Grab a napkin.

305
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:18,416
And, uh, everybody

306
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:21,288
write down a destination
on the napkin,

307
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:22,899
and then we'll put
that destination

308
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:25,075
in this bowl right here,

309
00:10:25,118 --> 00:10:26,729
I'll pick one out,

310
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:28,600
-and that way
not one of us decides...
-Oh.

311
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:30,689
...but we let fate take over.

312
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,473
-What do you guys think
about that plan?
-Okay.

313
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:34,040
KIKI:
I didn't say that

314
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,173
-I don't love you.
-Then what is it?

315
00:10:36,216 --> 00:10:37,827
Is it my gang ties?
Because I don't need that shit.

316
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,132
I'll leave it all behind.

317
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:41,352
-Just tell me what's wrong.
-[mouthing along]

318
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:42,570
KIKI:
The baby...

319
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:45,182
It's not yours. It's my...

320
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,184
my...

321
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,273
-my father's.
-Bigger.

322
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,188
-[inhales] My father's!
-N-- louder.

323
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:54,147
-[yelling] My father's!
-Yes!

324
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:55,366
Good. Now you go.

325
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:59,152
-Your father's?!
-Louder.

326
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,677
[yelling] Your father's?!

327
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,810
Okay! Now, this is what
I'm talking about.

328
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,682
Nice work. [applauds]
Do you all see that?

329
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,771
Goddamn, that's what I want.
I want to be able

330
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:10,642
to see your performance
from the fucking moon.

331
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,818
Guys, the louder you are,

332
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:15,342
the more people have
to pay attention to you.

333
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:18,258
Yeah... [sighs] Yeah,
I-I don't understand the script.

334
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,564
What movie did you say
this was from?

335
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:21,827
I-I didn't. I wrote it.

336
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:23,960
It's a mash-up of Chinatown

337
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:26,179
and Tupac Shakur's
Poetic Justice.

338
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:28,616
Oh. Are you, are you gonna
write all the scenes?

339
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,750
Well, there you go asking a
bunch of questions again, Tony.

340
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,012
[laughs] Uh, Kiki,

341
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:34,797
how does that
make him seem to you?

342
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,234
Um... weak?

343
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:39,062
Weak! Good. Very good.

344
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:40,846
Now, you, Kiki,
you're really getting this.

345
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,282
But did you feel that?

346
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,980
Did you feel how he went
from, like, a hot stud

347
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:46,199
you'd like to bang
to a weak little bitch

348
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:48,027
right before your eyes? Right?

349
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:49,899
I mean, that doesn't mean
I still wouldn't do him,

350
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,465
but that's between him and me.

351
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,076
Tony, see me after class.

352
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,774
Um... Okay.

353
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:58,603
Wrong! Wrong! Okay.

354
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:00,997
People in power
will try and bang you.

355
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,435
Now, sometimes it will be
necessary to get the part,

356
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:06,524
but assess the situation.

357
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,569
Why go all the way when
a simple hand job will suffice?

358
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:12,878
Tony, do see me after class.

359
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:14,619
DENNIS:
And the place

360
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:16,447
that we're going to is...

361
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:20,973
[sighs] "Yell"... "Yellow"?

362
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:23,193
What is, what is this?
Who, who wrote this?

363
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:26,370
Uh... [stammers] Me. Yeah.

364
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,676
W-Were you trying to
s-say Yellowstone or...?

365
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,636
Uh... no. Uh, just yellow.

366
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,072
-Just yellow?
Just the color yellow?
-Uh, well, I panicked.

367
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:34,421
You know, you were shooting down
all the other places

368
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:35,988
I've been naming, so I-I
couldn't think of something.

369
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:38,121
Okay, well, that's not
a goddamn place, you idiot, so..

370
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:39,600
[groans]
We're gonna try this again.

371
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:41,515
Next place I pick out,
that's where we're gonna go.

372
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,387
Mm-hmm.

373
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,780
-"Purple."
-Mm.

374
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:46,216
What is happening?

375
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:48,305
[burps] That was me.
Yeah, I did purple.

376
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:49,567
-You did purple?
Two of you wrote colors?
-Yeah, I...

377
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,047
Okay, so you thought
of a color, too?

378
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,657
I didn't understand
the assignment either.

379
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,528
-It-it was not clear.
-I said write down
a destination,

380
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:55,703
-and two people
wrote down colors?
-We're sorry, we're sorry.

381
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:57,183
-I don't understand...
-I like purple.

382
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:58,881
I like purple, too, Frank.
That's why I wrote it down.

383
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:00,708
Well, maybe we could go there.
That could be pretty.

384
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:02,972
Go where?! Purple?
That's not a place!

385
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,148
-That-- All right, you know...
-CHARLIE: Okay, you're right.

386
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:08,368
I think, um...
these beers are a little strong.

387
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,893
-Are you drunk?
-I-- these beers
are a little strong...

388
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:12,764
I will admit that the beers
are also stronger

389
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:14,461
-than I was anticipating.
-I like this beer.

390
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:15,549
You know what, guys?

391
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:17,508
I'm having a lot of fun here.

392
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:19,510
Uh, but I do want to
figure this out, so, new plan.

393
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:20,946
All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

394
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,079
Instead of writing down places,

395
00:13:23,122 --> 00:13:26,125
why don't we write down
key words?

396
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:27,648
Or phrases, you know?

397
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:28,998
Let's go with our instincts,
you know?

398
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,260
Whatever we want to feel,

399
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:31,870
what-whatever
we want to experience

400
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,350
on the vacation, okay? And then

401
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:34,742
we'll put it up on a board.

402
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:36,309
We'll look at it all together
and then maybe

403
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:39,051
the destination will just
reveal itself to us.

404
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:42,141
And... we can drink
more monkey beer.

405
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:43,751
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

406
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:45,928
-Monkey!
-We'll drink monkey beer
while we're doing it.

407
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:48,017
-Monkey.
-Four more monkey beers, monkey.

408
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,845
-Monkey, monkey, monkey beer!
-Monkey! Four more!

409
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,327
Ms. Reynolds, can I talk
to you for a second?

410
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,808
Oh, God, what's this? Listen,
if you don't have the cash,

411
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:59,332
you're gonna want to borrow it
from, like, an uncle or a friend

412
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:00,943
or something 'cause I don't make
exceptions. [chuckles]

413
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,902
No. It's, uh, it's not
the money, um...

414
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:06,687
I just wanted to say...
thank you.

415
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,515
It feels

416
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,561
so good to be seen like that.

417
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:12,737
My parents don't really
believe in me, so...

418
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,261
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Stop talking.

419
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,960
Holy shit. [gasps]

420
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:20,571
You're making me
realize something here.

421
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:21,920
Maybe this doesn't
have to be a scam.

422
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:22,965
What?

423
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:24,183
Well, what I mean is,

424
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,924
I-I was just able
to give you something

425
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,186
your parents never did,

426
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,797
and all-all I had to do
was... [chuckles]

427
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:32,452
toss you a single
compliment. [gasps]

428
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,280
I can control you.

429
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:37,544
I can make you feel
however I want you to feel,

430
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,895
which will help you
be a better actor.

431
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,027
-Oh, I do want to be a better...
-Shh. I'm not done.

432
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:45,944
[gasps] Oh, that's-that's
real power.

433
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:48,773
Way more power than just acting,
and I think that's what it was

434
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:50,470
probably all about
for me, you know?

435
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,777
I just... I was searching
for a sense of control.

436
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,865
Oh, Kiki...

437
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,432
[laughing]
you were...

438
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:57,129
terrible.

439
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:59,088
Wait, I-I was?

440
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,959
No. No. [laughs]

441
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:02,656
-[sighs]
-I'm kidding.

442
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,703
[gasps] You were amazing.

443
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:08,488
And you're going to make it.

444
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,925
I believe in you.

445
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:11,970
Oh, you do?

446
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:13,885
Maybe.

447
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,713
I'm not going
to tell you right now.

448
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:19,325
But yes.

449
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,197
[both laughing]

450
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,634
Oh, my God! This is... [gasps]

451
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:25,636
This is amazing. Yes, Kiki, yes.

452
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,377
I'm going to be there for you.

453
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,248
I'm going to be the mother
and father that you never had.

454
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,859
-I'm only going to take 35%...
-[phone buzzing]

455
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:32,904
...of all your future earnings,

456
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:34,645
and I will never, never

457
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:37,343
turn my back on you,
do you understand?

458
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,737
-Yes.
-Because you--
Can you give me one second?

459
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,521
-My phone is buzzing
off the hook in my pocket.
-Oh, yeah.

460
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,349
One sec. Hello?

461
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:45,090
No! I'm gonna see the director.

462
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:48,006
Um, hi, yes. Uh, is this
Deandra Reynolds?

463
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,095
-Yup.
-[over phone] Right. Well, uh,

464
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:51,923
-I'm so sorry to just call you
out of the blue like this...
-Faster.

465
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,707
-What?
-Faster.

466
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:55,927
Right. Brilliant. Um,

467
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,798
well, I am the director
of the TV show

468
00:15:57,842 --> 00:15:58,886
that you crashed
the audition on the other day,

469
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,280
and we have a role that...

470
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:03,674
-Slower.
-[laughs]

471

473

the... director...

474
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,246
Too slow. Don't start over.

475
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:13,379
[chuckles] Okay.
Uh, well, I saw your tape,

and, based on what I saw,
and this conversation,

477

I think we have a part
that might be right for you.

Do you guys have that?

The monkey got us drunk,

506
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:20,403
assaulted us,

507
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:21,795
robbed the bar,

508
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,667

-Yeah, he did.
That is what happened.

511
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:30,282
Yeah, the guy who sold him to me

512
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:31,892
did say something
like this could happen.

513

He did?!

514
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,374
Yeah. Apparently,
the monkey's grandfather

515
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:37,811
was Fatty Arbuckle's monkey,

516
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:38,899
and you know
how these things go.

517
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:40,727

to the next,

to think about this. All right,

on our vacation.

I think we landed on a

Yeah, we did, we did.
Look, look, look.

-Oh, look at the board.
-We did?
-Yeah.

530
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:06,231
We got something on here.
Let's um...

Okay, should we see
where we're going?

of four men

540

who got very, very drunk last
night on a mystery concoction

541

-That is what it is.
-That's so weird.

544
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:33,040
Why would we do that?

545
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:35,130
Because the monkey beers
were so delicious.

546
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:37,219
All right? That-that-that monkey
may have been a pervert,

547
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,960
but he was also a genius, which
is often the case in Hollywood.

'Cause I'm seeing a lot of empty
whiskey bottles around,

550
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,792
I'm thinking maybe that monkey
was just pouring, like,

551
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:47,185
half a bottle of whiskey
in each beer.

552

-You know?
-That could be.

553
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,318
Based on my hangover, I think

00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,667
that's what I'm,
that's what I'm feeling.

So, monkey beer

557
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,672
is just whiskey...
