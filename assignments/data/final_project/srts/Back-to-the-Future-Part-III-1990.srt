1
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:24,374
Doc.

2
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:28,480
Doc.

3
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,315
- Doc!
- What?

4
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,444
Relax, Doc. It's me! It's Marty.

5
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:37,072
It can't be.
I just sent you back to the future.

6
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:40,367
You did send me back to the future,
but I'm back.

7
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,452
I'm back from the future.

8
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,415
Great Scott!

9
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:07,639
<i>- Hey, kids, what time is it?
- Howdy Doody time!</i>

10
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:11,476
<i>"It's Howdy Doody time"
Great Scott!</i>

11
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:22,946
Howdy Doody time?

12
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:32,122
Sunday, November 13, 1955, 7:01 a.m.

13
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:35,834
Last night's time travel experiment
was apparently a complete success.

14
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:38,336
Lightning struck the clock tower
at 10:04 p. M...

15
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:40,714
sending the necessary 1.21 gigawatts...

16
00:05:40,797 --> 00:05:44,050
into the time vehicle,
which vanished in a flash of light...

17
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:48,638
leaving a pair of fire trails behind.
I assumed Marty and the time vehicle...

18
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:52,058
were transported forward through time
to the year 1985.

19
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:56,438
After that, I can't recall what happened.

20
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:59,316
In fact, I don't even remember
how I got home.

21
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:03,195
Perhaps the gigawatt discharge
and the temporal displacement field...

22
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,781
generated by the vehicle caused
a disruption of my own brain waves...

23
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,492
resulting in a condition
of momentary amnesia.

24
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:12,996
I now recall that moments
after the time vehicle disappeared...

25
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,706
into the future...

26
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:18,585
I saw a vision of Marty
saying he had come back from the future.

27
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,544
Hey, Doc.

28
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:22,088
Undoubtedly, this was some residual image.

29
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:31,264
Doc, calm down. It's me. It's Marty.

30
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,059
It can't be you. I sent
you back to the future!

31
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:37,729
That's right, but I came back again
from the future. Don't you remember?

32
00:06:37,854 --> 00:06:39,439
You fainted. I brought you home.

33
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,900
This can't be happening! You can't be here!

34
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:45,695
It doesn't make sense!
I refuse to believe you are here!

35
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,200
I am here, and it does make sense.
I came back to 1955 again with you.

36
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:53,161
The you from 1985
is waiting to get a book from Biff!

37
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:56,706
Once I got the book,
the you from 1985 were in the DeLorean...

38
00:06:56,831 --> 00:07:00,085
and it got struck by lightning,
and you got sent back to 1885!

39
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,795
1885?

40
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:06,716
It's a very interesting
story, future boy...

41
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:09,261
but there's one thing
that doesn't make sense.

42
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:14,057
If the me of the future is now in the past,
how could you possibly know about it?

43
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:15,934
You sent me a letter.

44
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:18,144
<i>"Dear Marty, if my
calculations are correct..."</i>

45
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,524
<i>"you will receive this letter immediately
after the DeLorean's struck by lightning."</i>

46
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,318
<i>"First, let me assure you
I am alive and well."</i>

47
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:29,155
<i>"I've been living happily
these past eight months in the year 1885."</i>

48
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,074
<i>"The lightning bolt that
hit the DeLorean..."</i>

49
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:34,119
<i>"caused an overload
which scrambled the time circuits..."</i>

50
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:38,290
<i>"activated the flux capacitor
and sent me back to 1885."</i>

51
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,917
<i>"The overload shorted out
the time circuits..."</i>

52
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:45,338
<i>"and destroyed the flying circuits.
Unfortunately, the car will never fly again."</i>

53
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:46,756
It actually flew?

54
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:49,968
Yeah. We had a hover conversion done
in the early 21st century.

55
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:51,511
Incredible!

56
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:55,182
<i>"I set myself up as a blacksmith
as a front..."</i>

57
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,393
<i>"while I attempted to repair the damage
to the time circuits."</i>

58
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:00,478
<i>"Unfortunately, this proved impossible..."</i>

59
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:05,317
<i>"because suitable replacement parts
will not be invented until 1947."</i>

60
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:10,322
<i>"However, I've gotten quite adept
at shoeing horses and fixing wagons."</i>

61
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:14,618
1885! Amazing!

62
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:18,163
I actually end up as a blacksmith
in the Old West.

63
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:19,706
Pretty heavy.

64
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,834
<i>"I have buried the DeLorean
in the abandoned Delgado Mine...</i>

65
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,255
<i>" adjacent to the old Boot Hill Cemetery
as shown on the enclosed map.</i>

66
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:32,511
<i>"Hopefully, it should remain undisturbed
and preserved until you uncover it in 1955.</i>

67
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:37,307
<i>"Inside, you will find repair instructions.</i>

68
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:40,685
<i>"My 1955 counterpart..." That's me.</i>

69
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:45,440
<i>"Should have no problem repairing it so
that you can drive it back to the future."</i>

70
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:49,361
<i>"Once you have returned to 1985,
destroy the time machine."</i>

71
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:53,532
- Destroy it?
- It's a long story, Doc.

72
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:59,120
<i>"I repeat, do not attempt
to come back here to get me."</i>

73
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:02,165
<i>"I am perfectly happy
living in the fresh air..."</i>

74
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,875
<i>"and wide-open spaces."</i>

75
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,628
<i>"I fear that unnecessary time travel..."</i>

76
00:09:06,753 --> 00:09:10,423
<i>"only risks further disruption
of the space-time continuum."</i>

77
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,927
<i>"And please take care of Einstein for me."</i>

78
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:16,513
Einstein?

79
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:21,393
He's your dog, Doc.
Einstein is what you call your dog in 1985.

80
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,981
<i>"I know you will give him a good home."</i>

81
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:30,151
<i>"Remember to walk him twice a day
and that he only likes canned dog food."</i>

82
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:33,446
<i>"These are my wishes.
Please respect and follow them."</i>

83
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:37,784
<i>"And so, Marty, I now say farewell
and wish you Godspeed."</i>

84
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:40,495
<i>"You've been a good,
kind, and loyal friend to me..."</i>

85
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:43,248
<i>"and you made a real difference
in my life."</i>

86
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:47,836
<i>"I will always treasure our relationship
and think of you with fond memories..."</i>

87
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,672
<i>"warm feelings and a special place
in my heart."</i>

88
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:56,511
<i>"Your friend in time, Doc Emmett L. Brown."</i>

89
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:59,598
<i>"September 1, 1885."</i>

90
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:03,435
I never knew I could write
anything so touching.

91
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:04,978
I know, it's beautiful.

92
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:11,318
It's all right, Copernicus.
Everything will be fine.

93
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:14,237
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault you're stuck back there.

94
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:16,031
I never should've let Biff get to me.

95
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:18,825
There are plenty worse places to be
than the Old West.

96
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,952
I could have ended up in the Dark Ages.

97
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:24,122
They probably would have burned me
at the stake as a heretic.

98
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,916
Let's look at the map.

99
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:30,003
According to this, the time vehicle
is sealed off in a side tunnel.

100
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:33,048
We may have to blast.

101
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:49,814
I think you woke up the
dead with that blast.

102
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,609
Take this camera. I want
to document everything!

103
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:58,865
This reminds me of the time I attempted
to reach the center of the Earth.

104
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,660
I'd been reading my favorite author,
Jules Verne.

105
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:05,247
I spent weeks preparing that expedition.
I didn't even get this far.

106
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,457
Of course, I was only 12 at the time.

107
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:11,127
You know, it was the
writings of Jules Verne...

108
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,797
that had a profound effect on my life.

109
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:17,592
<i>When I was 11, I first read
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.</i>

110
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:22,013
It was then that I realized
I must devote my life to science.

111
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,058
Check it out. Look at this.

112
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,272
My initials!

113
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,858
<i>Just like in
Journey to the Center of the Earth!</i>

114
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,111
<i>That means the time machine
must be right through this wall!</i>

115
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:02,345
It's been buried in here for 70 years,
two months and 13 days.

116
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,847
Astounding!

117
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:09,186
<i>"As you see, the lightning bolt
shorted out the time-circuit control chip."</i>

118
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,148
<i>"The attached..."</i>

119
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,482
Schematic.

120
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:18,695
<i>"Schematic diagram will allow you
to build a replacement unit..."</i>

121
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,158
<i>"with 1955 components, thus restoring
the time machine to perfect working order."</i>

122
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:27,370
Unbelievable that this little piece of junk
could be such a big problem.

123
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,919
<i>No wonder this circuit failed.
It says, "Made in Japan."</i>

124
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,381
What do you mean, Doc?
All the best stuff is made in Japan.

125
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:41,718
Unbelievable!

126
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:52,562
You know, when I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a cowboy.

127
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:56,274
<i>Now, knowing I'm spending my future
in the past...</i>

128
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,528
<i>it sounds like a wonderful way
to spend my retirement years.</i>

129
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:02,989
It just occurred to me,
since I end up in 1885...

130
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:06,409
perhaps I'm now in the history books.
I wonder.

131
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:10,872
Could I look myself up
in the old newspaper archives?

132
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,290
I don't know.

133
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:15,919
You always say it's not good
to know too much about your own destiny.

134
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:19,214
You're right, Marty. I
know too much already.

135
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:23,718
Better that I not attempt to uncover
the circumstances of my own future.

136
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:28,139
Copernicus. Come on, boy!

137
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:29,516
I'll get him.

138
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:30,851
Copernicus!

139
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:34,145
Come on. Let's go home, boy.

140
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:36,731
What's wrong?

141
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,317
<i>What's wrong, Copernicus?</i>

142
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,613
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

143
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:50,537
Doc, come here!

144
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,080
<i>Quick!</i>

145
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:56,960
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

146
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,212
You're not far off, Doc.

147
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,968
Great Scott!

148
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,179
Check this out.

149
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:12,184
<i>"Died September 7, 1885."
That's one week after you wrote the letter!</i>

150
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,562
<i>"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara."</i>

151
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,105
Who the hell is Clara?

152
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,026
- Please don't stand there!
- Right. Sorry.

153
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,986
I have to get another picture.

154
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:28,950
<i>"Shot in the back by Buford Tannen
over a matter of $80"?</i>

155
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,244
What kind of a future do you call that?

156
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:34,831
<i>"Buford Tannen was a notorious gunman..."</i>

157
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,751
<i>"whose short temper and
a tendency to drool..."</i>

158
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,753
<i>"earned him the nickname 'Mad Dog.'"</i>

159
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:43,089
<i>"He was quick on the trigger
and bragged he had killed 12 men..."</i>

160
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,258
<i>"not including Indians or Chinamen."</i>

161
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:48,094
- Does it name me? Am I one of the 12?
- Wait.

162
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,723
<i>"This claim cannot be proven
since precise records were not kept..."</i>

163
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:53,725
<i>"after Tannen shot a newspaper editor..."</i>

164
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,311
<i>"who printed an unfavorable story
about him in 1884."</i>

165
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,813
- That's why we can't find anything.
- Look.

166
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,068
William McFly and family.
Your relatives?

167
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:08,365
My great-grandfather's name
was William. That's him. Good-looking guy.

168
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,327
McFlys, but no Browns.

169
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,996
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe that grave wasn't yours.

170
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:17,374
There could've been
another Emmett Brown in 1885.

171
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,543
Did you have any relatives here back then?

172
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:23,713
The Browns didn't come to Hill Valley
until 1908. Then they were the von Brauns.

173
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,299
<i>My father changed our name
during World War I.</i>

174
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:27,342
Look.

175
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,805
Great Scott, it's me!

176
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,891
<i>Then it is true, all of it.</i>

177
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:38,603
<i>It is me who goes back there and gets shot.</i>

178
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,981
It's not gonna happen, Doc.

179
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,901
After you fix the time circuits
and put new tires on the DeLorean...

180
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:48,405
I'm going back to 1885,
and I'm bringing you home.

181
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,585
The clothes fit?

182
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:05,297
Everything except the boots.
They're kind of tight.

183
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,757
<i>Are you sure this stuff is authentic?</i>

184
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,802
Of course.
Haven't you ever seen a Western?

185
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:13,763
Yeah, I have.

186
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,058
Clint Eastwood never
wore anything like this.

187
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:22,063
- Clint who?
- Right. You haven't heard of him yet.

188
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,815
You have to wear the boots.

189
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,776
You can't wear those futuristic things
back in 1885.

190
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,070
You shouldn't be wearing them
here in 1955.

191
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,656
- As soon as I get there, I'll put them on.
- Okay.

192
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:34,284
I think we're about ready.
I put gas in the tank.

193
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,119
Your future clothes are packed.

194
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:40,081
Just in case,
fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies.

195
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,626
What about that floating device?

196
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,878
- Hoverboard.
- All right.

197
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:49,508
It's gonna be a long walk
back to Hill Valley from here.

198
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,551
It's still the safest plan.

199
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,513
We can't risk sending you back
into a populated area...

200
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,890
or to a spot that's
geographically unknown.

201
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,310
You don't want to crash into some tree
that existed in the past.

202
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:02,729
<i>This was all completely open country...</i>

203
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:05,649
so you'll have plenty of runout space
when you arrive.

204
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,568
Remember, where you're going,
there are no roads.

205
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:12,906
There's a small cave over there which will
be a good place to hide the time vehicle.

206
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:16,451
The new time-circuit control tubes
are warmed up.

207
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,747
Time circuits on.

208
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:23,834
I wrote the letter on September 1,
so we'll send you to...

209
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,546
September 2, that's a Wednesday.
September 2, 1885, 8:00 a.m.

210
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,632
I get shot on Monday the 7th.
You have five days to locate me.

211
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:34,636
According to my letter, I'm a blacksmith,
so I probably have a shop somewhere.

212
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,930
All you got to do is drive
the time vehicle...

213
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:40,392
directly toward that screen,
accelerating to 88 miles an hour.

214
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,560
Wait a minute.

215
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:45,105
If I drive straight towards the screen,
I'll crash into those Indians.

216
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,191
Marty, you're not thinking
fourth dimensionally.

217
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:53,321
You'll instantly be transported to 1885
and those Indians won't even be there.

218
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:55,156
Right.

219
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:00,203
Good luck, for both of our sakes.

220
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,622
See you in the future.

221
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,250
- You mean the past.
- Exactly.

222
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,842
Happy trails, Marty!

223
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,640
Ready, Marty?

224
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,143
Ready!

225
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,229
- Set!
- Hi-ho, Silver.

226
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,726
Indians!

227
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,059
The cave!

228
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:23,221
Charge!

229
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,018
Shit! The cavalry!

230
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,945
Damn, I ripped the fuel line.

231
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,869
Maggie! Fetch some water!
We got a hurt man here.

232
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,587
Mom.

233
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,298
- Mom, is that you?
- There, there.

234
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,384
You've been asleep for nearly six hours.

235
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,137
I had this horrible nightmare.

236
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,142
I dreamed I was in a Western.

237
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,105
I was being chased by all these Indians...

238
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,108
and a bear.

239
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,486
You're safe and sound now
here at the McFly farm.

240
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,072
<i>"McFly farm"?</i>

241
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,785
You're my...

242
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,037
You're my...

243
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,335
- Who are you?
- The name is Maggie McFly.

244
00:22:58,793 --> 00:22:59,794
McFly?

245
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,380
Maggie?

246
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,675
<i>And that's Mrs. McFly,
and don't you be forgetting the "Mrs."</i>

247
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,470
- What might your name be, sir?
- It's...

248
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,850
Eastwood.

249
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,646
Clint Eastwood.

250
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,106
You hit your head, Mr. Eastwood.

251
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,818
Not too serious, but lucky for you
Seamus found you when he did.

252
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:24,945
Seamus.

253
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,280
Me husband.

254
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,993
You'll be excusing me,
while I tend to William.

255
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,329
William.

256
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,914
That's okay, Will.

257
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,924
- That's William?
- Aye.

258
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:50,262
William Sean McFly, the first of
our family to be born in America.

259
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:55,016
It's okay, Will.
This here is Mr. Clint Eastwood visiting.

260
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,978
He sure likes you.

261
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,980
Maggie.

262
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,650
I've got supper.

263
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,486
I'm not one to pry
into a man's personal affairs...

264
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,991
but exactly how is it
you came to be way out here...

265
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:14,786
without a horse, or boots, or a hat?

266
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,622
Well, my...

267
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,084
horse broke down and
a bear ate my boots...

268
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,878
and I just forgot my hat.

269
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,755
How could you forget a thing like your hat?

270
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,341
- Would you like some water?
- Yeah.

271
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,396
I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Eastwood.

272
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,274
I'll help you find your blacksmith friend.

273
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,277
<i>You can stay the night in the barn...</i>

274
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,489
<i>and tomorrow I'll take you
as far as the railroad tracks.</i>

275
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,367
<i>You can follow them straight into town.</i>

276
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,497
I'll even give you a hat.

277
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,877
That's great. Thanks.

278
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,050
That's my William.

279
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,219
<i>Wee Willy.</i>

280
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,474
Yes.

281
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,144
I think you'll find the barn comfortable.

282
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,939
Never had any complaints about it
from the pigs.

283
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,315
Seamus.

284
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,818
- A word with you.
- Aye.

285
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,115
Will you hold him for a minute?

286
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,457
Are you sure you're not bringing a curse
on this house taking him in like that?

287
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,087
- He's such a strange young man.
- Aye, but I've just got a feeling about him.

288
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,383
Looking after him is the right thing to do.
That's important.

289
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,968
Hey, buddy.

290
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,262
Look how the baby takes to him.

291
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,473
Little Will never takes to strangers.

292
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,602
It's almost as if he's connected to us.

293
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,728
Hey, Will.

294
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,356
So you're my great-grandfather.

295
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,442
The first McFly born in America.

296
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,658
And you peed on me.

297
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,045
- Give us some soap.
- Here you go.

298
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,697
Take a look and see
what just breezed in the door.

299
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,285
I didn't know the circus was in town.

300
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,914
Must have got that shirt
off a dead Chinese.

301
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,144
What will it be, stranger?

302
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,356
I'll have...

303
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,734
- Ice water.
- Ice water?

304
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,779
Water?

305
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:45,200
You want water, you better dunk your head
in the horse trough out there.

306
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,662
In here, we pour whiskey.

307
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,383
- Excuse me.
- For what?

308
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,927
I'm trying to find a blacksmith.

309
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,055
Hey, McFly!

310
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,726
<i>Thought I told you never to come in...</i>

311
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,564
You ain't Seamus McFly.

312
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,694
You look like him, though,
especially with that dog-ugly hat.

313
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,824
You kin to that hay barber?

314
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,369
- What's your name, dude?
- Marty...

315
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,454
Eastwood.

316
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,833
Clint Eastwood.

317
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:41,006
- What kind of stupid name is that?
- He's the runt of the litter.

318
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,800
Boys, would you look-see
at these pearly whites?

319
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,845
I ain't seen teeth that straight
that weren't store-bought.

320
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,098
Take a gander at them moccasins.
What kind of skins is them?

321
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,935
<i>- What's that writing mean?
- "Nike"? Is that Indian talk?</i>

322
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,151
Bartender, I'm looking for that no-good,
cheating blacksmith.

323
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,613
- You seen him?
- No, sir, Mr. Tannen. I have not.

324
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:06,990
Tannen.

325
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,118
You're Mad Dog Tannen.

326
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,250
<i>"Mad Dog"?</i>

327
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,377
I hate that name.

328
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,880
<i>I hate it, you hear?</i>

329
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,799
<i>Nobody calls me "Mad Dog"!</i>

330
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,138
Especially not some duded-up,
egg-sucking gutter trash.

331
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,226
Dance! Come on!

332
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:40,148
Come on, runt!
You can dance better than that!

333
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,535
Shit.

334
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,684
- You better run, squirrel.
- Get him!

335
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:24,544
We got ourselves a new courthouse.
It's high time we had a hanging!

336
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,066
Look at him sway.

337
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,531
Yeah, haven't had a hanging in a long time!

338
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,788
I shoot the fleas off a dog's back
at 500 yards, Tannen...

339
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,374
and it's pointed at your head!

340
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,011
- You owe me money, blacksmith.
- How do you figure?

341
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,763
My horse threw a shoe.

342
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,474
You done the shoeing,
so that makes you responsible.

343
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,812
Since you never paid me for the job,
I'd say that makes us even.

344
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:24,896
Wrong!

345
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,983
I was on my horse when it happened,
and I got throwed off!

346
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:32,612
<i>That caused me to bust a perfectly
good bottle of fine Kentucky redeye.</i>

347
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,533
The way I figure it, blacksmith,
you owe me $5 for the whiskey...

348
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,702
and $75 for the horse!

349
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,246
That's the $80.

350
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,417
If your horse threw a shoe,
bring him back and I'll reshoe him.

351
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,085
I shot that horse!

352
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,548
- That's your problem, Tannen.
- Wrong. That's yours.

353
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:56,344
From now on, you better be looking
behind you when you walk.

354
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,306
Because one day you're gonna get
a bullet in your back.

355
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:09,733
Doc!

356
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,863
Marty, I gave you explicit instructions
not to come here...

357
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,324
<i>but to go directly back to 1985.</i>

358
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,534
I know, but I had to come.

359
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,746
It's good to see you, Marty.

360
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,586
You've got to do something
about those clothes.

361
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,590
- Dressed like that, you're liable to get shot.
- Or hanged.

362
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,134
What idiot dressed you in that outfit?

363
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,178
You did.

364
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:45,519
<i>"Shot in the back by Buford Tannen
over a matter of $80"?</i>

365
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,312
<i>"September 7"?</i>

366
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,773
That's this Monday!

367
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,234
Now I wish I'd paid him off.

368
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:56,446
<i>Who's this "beloved Clara"?
I don't know anyone named Clara.</i>

369
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,448
I don't know, Doc.

370
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,952
I thought maybe she was
a girlfriend of yours.

371
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:05,205
My involvement in such a
social relationship...

372
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,040
here in 1885...

373
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:11,044
<i>could result in a disruption
of the space-time continuum.</i>

374
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,129
<i>As a scientist...</i>

375
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,882
I can never take that risk.

376
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,636
Certainly not after
what we've already been through.

377
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,014
- Emmett! Hello, Emmett.
- Hubert.

378
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:24,808
It's the mayor.

379
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,268
Excuse me, Emmett.

380
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,105
Do you remember last week
when you volunteered...

381
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,858
to meet the new schoolteacher
at the station?

382
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:33,859
Yes, quite so.

383
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,111
We just got word she's coming in tomorrow.

384
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,154
<i>Here are the details for you.</i>

385
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,283
- Thanks for all your help.
- Anytime, Hubert.

386
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,868
Oh!

387
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,912
Her name's Miss Clara Clayton.

388
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,964
Well, Doc...

389
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:59,217
now we know who Clara is.

390
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,512
Marty, it's impossible.

391
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:06,892
The idea that I could fall in love
at first sight is romantic nonsense.

392
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,811
There's no scientific rationale
for that concept.

393
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,229
It's not science.

394
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,107
You meet the right girl, it
hits you like lightning.

395
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,775
Please, don't say that.

396
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,278
That's the way it was for me and Jennifer.

397
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,780
<i>We couldn't keep our eyes off each other.</i>

398
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,491
God, Jennifer, I hope she's all right.

399
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,952
I can't believe we just
left her on the porch.

400
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,038
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

401
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:32,000
When you burned the almanac in 1955,
the normal timeline was restored.

402
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,793
Once we're back in 1985...

403
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,713
you just have to go to her house
to wake her up.

404
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:41,301
Turn that valve over there,
all the way to the right.

405
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,386
<i>Yeah, pull it all the way around.</i>

406
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,679
<i>Let's go!</i>

407
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,987
- Ice tea?
- No, thanks.

408
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,324
It's a refrigerator.

409
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,953
I guess Miss Clayton
will have to find other transportation.

410
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:11,665
If I never meet her, there's no possibility
of a romantic infatuation.

411
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,166
- You're the doc.
- All right.

412
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,086
We'll get the DeLorean and
get back to the future.

413
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,880
I tore a hole in the gas tank
when I was landing...

414
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,424
so we'll have to patch it up
and get some gas.

415
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,218
You mean, we're out of gas?

416
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,596
Yeah. It's no big deal.
We've got Mr. Fusion, right?

417
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,475
Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits
and the flux capacitor.

418
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,603
But the internal combustion engine
runs on ordinary gasoline.

419
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,230
It always has.

420
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:39,568
There won't be a gas station around here
until sometime in the next century.

421
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:45,156
Without gasoline,
we can't get the DeLorean up to 88 mph.

422
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,035
So what do we do?

423
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,757
- Twenty-four!
- It's no use, Marty!

424
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:07,387
Even the fastest horse in the world
won't run more than 35, 40 miles an hour!

425
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,067
Bartender said that's the
strongest stuff they got.

426
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,819
Try it, Marty.

427
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,499
Give it more gas!

428
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,968
Damn!

429
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,891
It blew the fuel injection manifold.
Strong stuff, all right.

430
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,727
It will take me a month to rebuild it.

431
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,854
A month?

432
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,900
- You're gonna get shot on Monday!
- I know!

433
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,652
I wish...

434
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:04,694
<i>Wait.</i>

435
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:08,114
I've got it! We can roll
it down a steep hill!

436
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,201
We'll never find a smooth enough surface.
Unless...

437
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,119
Of course! Ice!

438
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,039
We'll wait until winter
when the lake freezes over.

439
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,292
Winter? What are you saying?
Monday is three days away!

440
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,213
All right. Let's just think
this thing through logically.

441
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,967
We know it won't run under its own power.
We know we can't pull it.

442
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,804
But if we could figure out a way...

443
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,349
to push it up to 88 miles an hour...

444
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,068
That's it.

445
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,822
How fast can she go?
Why, I've had her up to 55 myself.

446
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,493
I heard that Fearless Frank Fargo
got one of these up to near 70...

447
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:54,953
out past Verde Junction.

448
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,164
Do you think it's possible
to get it up to 90?

449
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,960
Ninety? Tarnation.
Who would ever need to be in such a hurry?

450
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,462
Just a little bet he and
I have, that's all.

451
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,965
Theoretically speaking, could it be done?

452
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:11,011
I suppose, if you had a straight
stretch of track with a level grade...

453
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,388
and you weren't hauling no cars...

454
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,557
and if you could get
the fire hot enough.

455
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:19,060
I'm talking about hotter than the blazes
of Hell itself.

456
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,938
It might be possible to
get her up that fast.

457
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,982
When does the next train come through?

458
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,650
Monday morning at 8:00.

459
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:29,529
Here. This spur that runs off the main
line 3 miles out to Clayton Ravine.

460
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:33,533
It's a long stretch of level track
that will still exist in 1985.

461
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:36,745
This is where we'll push the DeLorean
with the locomotive.

462
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,957
<i>Funny. This map calls Clayton Ravine
"Shonash Ravine."</i>

463
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,002
That must be the old Indian name for it.
It's perfect.

464
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,172
A long run that goes
across the bridge over the ravine...

465
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,674
over near that Hilldale
housing development.

466
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,219
Right, but according to this map...

467
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,262
there is no bridge.

468
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,849
Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea.

469
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,810
<i>We can't wait for this
thing to get finished.</i>

470
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,145
Marty, it's perfect.

471
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,481
You're not thinking fourth dimensionally.

472
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,316
Right. I have a problem with that.

473
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:10,028
Don't you see? The bridge
will exist in 1985.

474
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,821
<i>It's safe and still in use.</i>

475
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,783
As long as we get the DeLorean
up to 88 miles an hour...

476
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:16,952
before we hit the edge of the ravine...

477
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:21,331
we'll instantaneously arrive at a point
in time where the bridge is completed.

478
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:26,211
We'll have track under us
and coast safely across the ravine.

479
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:30,507
- What about the train?
- It will be a spectacular wreck.

480
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,926
Too bad no one will be around to see it.

481
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:37,430
- Help me!
- Great Scott!

482
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,474
Hurry!

483
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,519
Jump!

484
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,162
Thank you, sir. You saved my...

485
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:45,916
life.

486
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,088
Emmett Brown at your service, Miss...

487
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,219
Clayton.

488
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,222
Clara Clayton.

489
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:02,307
Clara?

490
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,771
What a beautiful name.

491
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,249
May I help you inside with these?

492
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,752
That won't be necessary.
I can take care of it.

493
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:34,589
- You've done more than enough already.
- But it's really no trouble.

494
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,551
She says it's fine, and
we have to get going.

495
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,971
Ma'am, good luck
with your school teaching and everything.

496
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:42,889
Clara.

497
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,393
I'll straighten everything out
for the buckboard rental.

498
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:50,564
Don't worry about that. I feel somewhat
responsible for what happened.

499
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:55,360
That would be very gentlemanly of you,
Mr. Brown. Emmett.

500
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,534
You know, I'm almost glad
that snake spooked those horses.

501
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:05,078
Otherwise, we might never have met.

502
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,372
I suppose it was destiny.

503
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:12,836
Thank you for everything.

504
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,172
You're quite welcome.

505
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,759
I will see you again, won't I?

506
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:22,971
Of course. You'll see lots of me.
I have a shop in town.

507
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:26,183
I'm the local scientist,
I mean, blacksmith.

508
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,186
What sort of science?

509
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,438
Astronomy? Chemistry?

510
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:34,024
Actually, I'm a student of all sciences.

511
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:36,902
Doc, we have to get going.

512
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:39,863
Yes. Excuse us, Clara.

513
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,616
We have to get going.

514
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,246
Toodle-oo.

515
00:45:56,213 --> 00:45:58,715
What do you mean,
you'll be seeing lots of her?

516
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,176
I might see her again just in passing.

517
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:04,638
Did you see the way she was looking at you?

518
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,766
She did have quite a scare, right?

519
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,229
Miss Clayton almost ended up
at the bottom of Clayton Ravine.

520
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:17,859
Holy shit.
Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher.

521
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:22,197
- They say she fell in there 100 years ago.
- 100 years ago!

522
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:24,908
- That's this year!
- Every kid knows that story.

523
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:27,911
We all have teachers we'd like to see
fall into the ravine.

524
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,454
Great Scott!

525
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,583
Then she was supposed to go over
in that wagon.

526
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:37,879
Now I may have seriously altered history.

527
00:46:39,256 --> 00:46:42,175
Look, Doc, what's the
worse that can happen?

528
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,594
So they don't name the ravine after her.

529
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,222
Let's get the DeLorean ready
and get out of here.

530
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:50,559
I wish I'd never invented
that infernal time machine.

531
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,188
It's caused nothing but disaster.

532
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,484
Doc, this is Marty.

533
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:00,735
<i>Do you read me? Over.</i>

534
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:01,987
Check, Marty.

535
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:03,905
<i>Great. These things still work.</i>

536
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:08,368
All right. Once more,
let's go over the entire plan and layout.

537
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:14,457
- I apologize for the crudity of this model...
- Yeah, it's not to scale. It's okay.

538
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,544
All right. Tomorrow night, Sunday...

539
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:21,548
we load the DeLorean
onto the tracks here, on the spur...

540
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,425
<i>by the abandoned silver mine.</i>

541
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,428
The switch track is where the spur runs
off the main line...

542
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:29,973
three miles out to Clayton...
Shonash Ravine.

543
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,976
The train leaves the station
at 8:00 Monday morning.

544
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,772
We'll stop it, uncouple the cars,
throw the switch track and then hijack...

545
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:41,568
borrow the locomotive and use it
to push the time machine.

546
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:45,447
According to my calculations we'll reach
88 mph just before we hit...

547
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:50,619
the edge of the ravine, at which point
we'll be transported back to 1985...

548
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:53,413
and coast safely across
the completed bridge.

549
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,790
<i>What does this mean? "Point of no return."</i>

550
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,834
That's our fail-safe point.

551
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:01,963
Till there, we have time to stop the
locomotive before it plunges into the ravine.

552
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:05,425
But once we pass this windmill,
it's the future or bust.

553
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:10,722
Here you go.
Connect that to the positive terminal.

554
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:14,935
- All right, you all set?
- Yeah. Go!

555
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,354
Train pulling out of the station!

556
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:19,731
<i>Coming up to the switch track!</i>

557
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,525
<i>Stop at the switch track!</i>

558
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:24,194
<i>Throw the switch!</i>

559
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:26,905
<i>Pull up to the DeLorean!</i>

560
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:29,032
<i>Pushing the DeLorean...</i>

561
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:32,744
up to 88 miles per hour!

562
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,709
It couldn't be simpler.

563
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:47,425
Emmett?

564
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:49,928
It's Clara.

565
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:52,639
Quick, cover the DeLorean!

566
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:01,648
- Hello.
- Why, hello.

567
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:04,276
This is quite a surprise.

568
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:08,697
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

569
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:11,908
We were just doing a
little model railroading.

570
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:17,497
When my bags were thrown from the wagon...

571
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,875
my telescope was damaged.

572
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,170
Since you mentioned an
interest in science...

573
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:26,298
I thought you might be
able to repair it for me.

574
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:29,551
I would pay you, of course.

575
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,013
I wouldn't think of charging you for this.

576
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:34,806
Let's have a look at it.

577
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:38,518
I think a lens may be out
of alignment because...

578
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:42,772
if you move it this way
the image turns fuzzy.

579
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,357
See?

580
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:48,111
But if you turn it the other way...

581
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:50,155
then...

582
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,157
Everything becomes...

583
00:49:55,202 --> 00:49:56,286
clear.

584
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,003
I could repair it right away
and have it for you tonight.

585
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,214
Tonight is the town festival.

586
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:11,718
I wouldn't dream of having you work
on my telescope during such an occasion.

587
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:15,263
You are planning on attending, aren't you?

588
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:19,142
- Actually, ma'am...
- Yes, of course. The festival.

589
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:25,232
In that case,
I'll see you this evening at the festival.

590
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:28,193
- Mr. Eastwood.
- Ma'am.

591
00:50:31,488 --> 00:50:33,823
Thank you for taking care of my telescope.

592
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:35,825
You're quite welcome.

593
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:43,291
It's a nice telescope.

594
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:45,544
Ladies and gentlemen...

595
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,963
as mayor of Hill Valley...

596
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:52,050
it gives me great pleasure
to dedicate this clock...

597
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,803
to the people of Hill County!

598
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:57,848
May it stand for all time!

599
00:50:58,557 --> 00:50:59,891
<i>Tell me when, gentlemen.</i>

600
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:05,063
Three! Two! One!

601
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:07,065
<i>Now!</i>

602
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:14,781
Let the festivities begin!

603
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:26,126
In a way, it's fitting that you and I
are here to witness this.

604
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:28,587
It's too bad I didn't bring my camera.

605
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:37,095
Ready, gentlemen?

606
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:41,433
The only problem is,
we'll never be able to show it to anybody.

607
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:42,934
Smile, Doc.

608
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,169
What great music!

609
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:12,672
Yeah, it's got a beat,
and you can dance to it.

610
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:15,842
Step right up and test your mettle
with the latest products...

611
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:19,846
<i>from Col. Samuel Colt's Patent
Firearms Manufacturing Company...</i>

612
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:21,848
of Hartford, Connecticut.

613
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,309
<i>Now, take this model, for example.</i>

614
00:52:24,768 --> 00:52:27,979
<i>The new,
improved and refined Colt Peacemaker...</i>

615
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:33,944
<i>selling to you tonight
for the low price of $12.</i>

616
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:51,753
- Good evening.
- 'Evening.

617
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:55,006
You look very nice.

618
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,842
Thank you.

619
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:07,435
Would you like...

620
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:12,232
- Would you care to...
- I'd love to.

621
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:32,586
Young man, you want to give it a try?

622
00:53:32,711 --> 00:53:34,087
No, thanks.

623
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:35,839
Doc, this...

624
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:44,890
Son!

625
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,268
- Sonny boy!
- Doc can dance?

626
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:53,023
Son.

627
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:59,279
I just told you that even a baby
could handle this weapon.

628
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:03,575
- Surely you're not afraid to try.
- I'm not afraid of nothing.

629
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,661
Come on, then.
Just step up here like a man.

630
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:11,333
<i>Now, young man, what you do
is just ease that hammer back and...</i>

631
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,503
squeeze off a round.

632
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:17,547
Right on out there and be real smooth.

633
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:19,549
That's the way you do it.

634
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:26,598
- Can I try that again?
- Yeah, go ahead.

635
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:42,197
Tell me one thing.
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

636
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,407
7-Eleven.

637
00:54:49,162 --> 00:54:52,249
Buford, you sure that blacksmith
will be at this shindig?

638
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:55,418
Sure he's here. Everybody's here tonight.

639
00:54:57,671 --> 00:55:01,842
You'll have to check your firearms
if you want to join in on the festivities.

640
00:55:03,552 --> 00:55:06,596
- Who's gonna make us, tenderfoot?
- I am.

641
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,227
Marshal Strickland.
I didn't know you was back in town.

642
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:15,939
If you can't read the sign,
I presume you can read this.

643
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:19,526
<i>Pretty tough hombre when you're pointing
a gun at a man's back.</i>

644
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:22,404
Just like you, I take every
advantage I can get.

645
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:24,447
You gonna check your iron?

646
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:28,326
I was just joking with your deputy.

647
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:30,495
Of course, I'm gonna check my iron.

648
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,415
- We all were, weren't we, boys?
- Yeah, right.

649
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:35,917
Tannen.

650
00:55:37,544 --> 00:55:39,462
Your knife, too.

651
00:55:46,136 --> 00:55:47,596
Smile, Marshal.

652
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:49,472
After all, this is a party.

653
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:51,975
Only party I'll be smiling at...

654
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:55,103
is the one that sees
you at the end of a rope.

655
00:55:57,522 --> 00:55:58,940
Have fun!

656
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:05,280
That's how you handle them.
Never give them an inch...

657
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:07,616
and maintain discipline at all times.

658
00:56:07,741 --> 00:56:10,410
Discipline.

659
00:56:10,744 --> 00:56:12,329
I will, Pa.

660
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:19,002
Thank you very much.

661
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:23,256
Mr. Eastwood, nice to see you.

662
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:27,886
I see you got yourself
some respectable clothes and a fine hat.

663
00:56:28,261 --> 00:56:31,640
A couple people didn't like the way
the other one looked on me.

664
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:33,433
That one suits you.

665
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:35,477
- It's very becoming.
- Thanks.

666
00:56:36,645 --> 00:56:39,147
<i>"Frisbee." Far out.</i>

667
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,445
- What was the meaning of that?
- It was right in front of him.

668
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:01,503
- That's mine!
- Not anymore.

669
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:04,422
- Give me that.
- There he is, Buford.

670
00:57:05,841 --> 00:57:07,175
- Where?
- There.

671
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:09,803
Dancing with that piece of calico.

672
00:57:09,928 --> 00:57:11,888
What are you gonna do, boss?

673
00:57:14,224 --> 00:57:19,104
I figure if I bury this muzzle deep enough
in his back nobody will hear the shot.

674
00:57:19,396 --> 00:57:21,690
Careful. You've only got
one bullet with that.

675
00:57:21,815 --> 00:57:23,608
I only need one.

676
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:37,789
I told you to watch your back, smithy.

677
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:39,583
You're early.

678
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:41,877
It's a Derringer. Small but effective.

679
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:44,713
The last time I used it,
fella took two days to die.

680
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:47,883
Bled to death inside. It was real painful.

681
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:51,178
That means you'll be dead
by about supper time Monday.

682
00:57:51,303 --> 00:57:54,514
Excuse me. I don't know
who you think you are, but we're dancing.

683
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,058
Look what we have here.

684
00:57:57,184 --> 00:57:59,978
Ain't you gonna introduce me?
I'd like a dance.

685
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:03,607
I wouldn't give you the pleasure.
You'll have to go ahead and shoot.

686
00:58:03,857 --> 00:58:06,193
- All right.
- I'll dance with him.

687
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,363
Boys, keep the blacksmith company
while I get acquainted with the filly!

688
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:14,034
Yeah!

689
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:19,289
I don't dance very well
when my partner has a gun in his hand.

690
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,832
You'll learn.

691
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:25,420
Maybe I'll just take
my $80 worth out of her!

692
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,297
Leave her alone!

693
00:58:30,342 --> 00:58:34,012
Yeah, I bet there's something you can do
that's worth $80.

694
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:37,599
I believe you've underestimated me, mister.

695
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,226
Have I?

696
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:47,651
Stop it!

697
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:49,277
Damn you!

698
00:58:50,946 --> 00:58:52,572
No, I damn you!

699
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:56,368
<i>I damn you to hell!</i>

700
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,961
- You.
- Lighten up, jerk!

701
00:59:10,006 --> 00:59:11,925
Mighty strong words, runt!

702
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:16,012
<i>You man enough to back them up
with more than just a pie plate?</i>

703
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:20,517
Just leave my friends alone.

704
00:59:21,393 --> 00:59:23,854
What's wrong, dude? You yellow?

705
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:34,573
That's what I thought. A yellow-belly.

706
00:59:40,704 --> 00:59:43,415
Nobody calls me yellow.

707
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:47,419
Then let's finish it. Right now.

708
00:59:47,544 --> 00:59:50,005
Not now, Buford. Marshal's got our guns.

709
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:52,591
Like I said, we'll finish this tomorrow!

710
00:59:52,716 --> 00:59:55,302
Tomorrow we're robbing the Pine City stage.

711
00:59:55,677 --> 00:59:58,054
What about Monday?
We doing anything Monday?

712
00:59:58,263 --> 01:00:00,599
Monday would be fine.
You can kill him on Monday.

713
01:00:00,724 --> 01:00:04,060
I'll be back this way on Monday.
We'll settle this then.

714
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:07,022
Right there, out in the street...

715
01:00:07,564 --> 01:00:09,691
<i>in front of the Palace Saloon.</i>

716
01:00:10,442 --> 01:00:12,527
Yeah, right. When?

717
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:14,654
- High noon?
- Noon?

718
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:18,950
I do my killing before breakfast. 7:00!

719
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:25,874
8:00. I do my killing after breakfast.

720
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:27,876
Marty!

721
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:33,298
Break it up.

722
01:00:33,423 --> 01:00:36,593
What's all this about?
You causing trouble here, Tannen?

723
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,720
No trouble, Marshal.

724
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:42,557
Just a little personal matter
between me and Eastwood.

725
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,267
<i>This don't concern the law.</i>

726
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:47,187
Tonight, everything concerns the law.
Break it up.

727
01:00:47,312 --> 01:00:50,941
Any brawling, it's 15
days in the county jail.

728
01:00:51,066 --> 01:00:55,320
All right, folks. This is a party.
Come on! Let's have some fun!

729
01:01:00,367 --> 01:01:01,910
8:00 Monday, runt.

730
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:07,082
If you ain't here, I'll hunt you
and shoot you down like a duck.

731
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:10,669
<i>It's "dog." Shoot him down like a dog.</i>

732
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:13,255
Let's go, boys!

733
01:01:13,964 --> 01:01:16,216
Let these sissies have their party!

734
01:01:17,384 --> 01:01:20,053
What are you doing, saying
you'll meet Tannen?

735
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:24,391
Don't worry about it.
Monday morning we'll be gone.

736
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:27,352
Theoretically, yes. But
what if the train's late?

737
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:29,938
- We'll discuss this later.
- We'll discuss it now.

738
01:01:30,063 --> 01:01:32,607
- Thank you for your gallantry.
- Ma'am.

739
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:35,318
Had you not interceded,
Emmett might have been shot.

740
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:38,154
Marty... Clint, I'm gonna take Clara home.

741
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:40,740
- Right. Good night.
- You sure set him straight.

742
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:43,910
I'm glad somebody finally stood up
to that son of a bitch.

743
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:47,080
You're all right in my book.
I'd like to buy you a drink.

744
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:50,458
You don't have to buy me anything.
It was no big deal...

745
01:01:50,584 --> 01:01:54,796
You can have this brand-new Colt
Peacemaker and gun belt, free of charge.

746
01:01:56,214 --> 01:01:57,465
Free?

747
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:00,802
I want everybody to know
the gun that shot Buford Tannen...

748
01:02:00,927 --> 01:02:02,971
was a Colt Peacemaker!

749
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,973
No problem. Thanks a lot.

750
01:02:05,724 --> 01:02:09,811
Of course, if you lose, I'm taking it back.

751
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:14,357
Thanks again.

752
01:02:17,694 --> 01:02:18,945
You had him.

753
01:02:19,362 --> 01:02:22,741
You could have walked away and nobody
would have thought less of you.

754
01:02:22,866 --> 01:02:26,119
All it would have been was words,
hot air from a buffoon.

755
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,872
Instead, you let him rile you...

756
01:02:28,997 --> 01:02:32,959
into playing his game,
his way, by his rules.

757
01:02:33,168 --> 01:02:35,420
Seamus, relax. I know what I'm doing.

758
01:02:35,545 --> 01:02:37,422
- He reminds me of poor Martin.
- Aye.

759
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:38,924
- Who?
- Me brother.

760
01:02:39,049 --> 01:02:42,010
Wait a minute.
You have a brother named Martin McFly?

761
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:43,470
Had a brother.

762
01:02:44,513 --> 01:02:47,224
Martin used to let men
provoke him into fighting.

763
01:02:47,349 --> 01:02:50,393
He was concerned people
would think him a coward if he refused.

764
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:55,273
That's how he got a knife shoved through
his belly in a saloon in Virginia City.

765
01:02:55,649 --> 01:02:59,611
Never considered the future, poor Martin.
God rest his soul.

766
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:04,366
Sure, and I hope you're
considering the future, Mr. Eastwood.

767
01:03:08,286 --> 01:03:10,497
I think about it all the time.

768
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:15,877
That crater all by itself,
like a starburst.

769
01:03:16,002 --> 01:03:18,588
- Yeah.
- That one's called Copernicus.

770
01:03:19,464 --> 01:03:23,301
Listen to me. I feel like
I'm teaching school.

771
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:25,554
Please, continue the lesson.

772
01:03:26,012 --> 01:03:28,807
I never found lunar
geography so fascinating.

773
01:03:29,182 --> 01:03:30,934
You're quite knowledgeable.

774
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:35,063
When I was 11, I had diphtheria.
I was quarantined for three months.

775
01:03:35,188 --> 01:03:38,733
<i>My father brought this telescope
and put it next to my bed...</i>

776
01:03:38,859 --> 01:03:41,152
<i>so I could see
everything out the window.</i>

777
01:03:42,654 --> 01:03:45,866
Do you think we'll ever
travel to the moon...

778
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:48,952
the way we travel
across the country on trains?

779
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,414
Definitely. Although not for 84 years,
and not on trains.

780
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:56,168
We'll have space capsules sent aloft
with rockets...

781
01:03:56,668 --> 01:04:00,714
devices that create giant explosions
so powerful they just...

782
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:05,552
That they break the pull of gravity
and send the projectile to outer space.

783
01:04:07,554 --> 01:04:08,763
Emmett!

784
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:10,348
I read that book, too!

785
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:13,852
<i>You're quoting Jules Verne,
From the Earth to the Moon.</i>

786
01:04:13,977 --> 01:04:16,062
You've read Jules Verne?

787
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:20,233
- I adore Jules Verne.
- So do I.

788
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:23,612
<i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
My absolute favorite.</i>

789
01:04:23,737 --> 01:04:28,033
The first time I read that as a little boy,
I wanted to meet Captain Nemo.

790
01:04:28,158 --> 01:04:31,369
Don't tease. You couldn't have read that
when you were a boy.

791
01:04:31,494 --> 01:04:34,080
It was only first published 10 years ago.

792
01:04:34,206 --> 01:04:38,835
Yes. I meant it made me feel like a boy.

793
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:45,175
I never met a woman
who liked Jules Verne before.

794
01:04:47,177 --> 01:04:50,555
I never ever met a man like you before.

795
01:05:42,524 --> 01:05:43,775
Doc?

796
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:49,739
<i>Doc?</i>

797
01:05:53,118 --> 01:05:55,161
Hope you know what you're doing.

798
01:06:08,466 --> 01:06:10,510
You talking to me?

799
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:14,890
You talking to me, Tannen?

800
01:06:19,144 --> 01:06:20,729
I'm the only one here.

801
01:06:21,813 --> 01:06:25,358
Go ahead! Make my day.

802
01:06:31,948 --> 01:06:34,284
- Good morning.
- 'Morning.

803
01:06:34,993 --> 01:06:38,997
Have a cigar. Anything I
can do for you today?

804
01:06:39,206 --> 01:06:42,375
- No, that's fine.
- Good luck tomorrow.

805
01:06:42,501 --> 01:06:45,212
- We'll be praying for you.
- Thanks.

806
01:06:46,463 --> 01:06:50,634
Good morning.
Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?

807
01:06:51,718 --> 01:06:54,888
I'm fine. Thanks.

808
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,277
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

809
01:07:09,402 --> 01:07:11,738
I was just out enjoying the morning air.

810
01:07:11,863 --> 01:07:14,574
It's really lovely here in the morning.
Don't you think?

811
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:18,620
Yes. We've got to load the DeLorean
and get ready to roll.

812
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:21,331
Look at that, the tombstone.

813
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:25,335
Let me see that photograph again.

814
01:07:27,921 --> 01:07:29,923
My name, it's vanished.

815
01:07:30,382 --> 01:07:31,925
That's great, Doc.

816
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,470
We're going back to the future tomorrow,
so everything's being erased.

817
01:07:35,595 --> 01:07:37,180
But only my name is erased.

818
01:07:37,305 --> 01:07:40,976
The tombstone itself and the date still remain.
That doesn't make sense.

819
01:07:41,101 --> 01:07:43,645
We know this photograph represents
what will happen...

820
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:47,148
if the events of today continue
to run their course into tomorrow.

821
01:07:47,274 --> 01:07:49,484
- Right. So?
- Excuse me, Mr. Eastwood.

822
01:07:49,609 --> 01:07:53,989
- I just need to take your measurements.
- Look, pal, I don't want to buy a suit.

823
01:07:54,322 --> 01:07:57,534
- This is for your coffin.
- My coffin?

824
01:07:57,659 --> 01:08:00,328
The odds are running 2-1 against you.

825
01:08:00,495 --> 01:08:02,455
Might as well be prepared.

826
01:08:02,622 --> 01:08:04,499
So it may not be my name...

827
01:08:04,624 --> 01:08:08,211
that's going to be on this tombstone.
It may be yours.

828
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:11,464
- Great Scott.
- I know, this is heavy.

829
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:15,677
Why are you wearing that gun? You're
not considering going up against Tannen?

830
01:08:15,802 --> 01:08:18,513
Tomorrow morning I'm going
back to the future with you.

831
01:08:18,638 --> 01:08:21,850
But if Buford Tannen comes looking
for trouble, I'll be ready for him.

832
01:08:21,975 --> 01:08:24,269
You heard what that son
of a bitch called me.

833
01:08:24,394 --> 01:08:27,147
You can't lose your judgment over names.

834
01:08:27,272 --> 01:08:31,151
That's exactly what causes you
to get in that accident in the future.

835
01:08:33,028 --> 01:08:36,156
What? What about my future?

836
01:08:36,948 --> 01:08:40,076
I can't tell you. It
might make things worse.

837
01:08:40,243 --> 01:08:41,703
Wait a minute.

838
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,164
What is wrong with my future?

839
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:48,960
We all have to make decisions
that affect the course of our lives.

840
01:08:49,753 --> 01:08:52,339
You've got to do what you've got to do...

841
01:08:52,589 --> 01:08:55,091
and I've got to do what I've got to do.

842
01:09:05,936 --> 01:09:07,646
- Marty.
- Yeah?

843
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:09,814
I've made a decision.

844
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:12,067
I'm not going with you tomorrow.

845
01:09:12,192 --> 01:09:14,110
I'm staying here.

846
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,407
What are you talking about?

847
01:09:19,991 --> 01:09:22,035
There's no point in denying it.

848
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,579
- I'm in love with Clara.
- Oh, man.

849
01:09:24,788 --> 01:09:26,623
We don't belong here.

850
01:09:27,249 --> 01:09:28,875
Neither one of us.

851
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,795
It could still be you
that gets shot tomorrow.

852
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,589
This tombstone could
still be in your future.

853
01:09:34,673 --> 01:09:37,092
Marty, the future isn't written.

854
01:09:38,051 --> 01:09:40,720
It can be changed. You know that.

855
01:09:41,555 --> 01:09:45,350
Anyone can make their future
whatever they want it to be.

856
01:09:45,642 --> 01:09:49,563
I can't let this one little photograph
determine my entire destiny.

857
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:53,942
I have to live my life
according to what I believe is right...

858
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:55,318
in my heart.

859
01:09:57,445 --> 01:10:00,657
Doc, you're a scientist.

860
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:06,955
So you tell me.
What's the right thing to do, up here?

861
01:10:20,844 --> 01:10:22,304
You're right, Marty.

862
01:10:45,035 --> 01:10:48,496
- That worked great.
- I've at least got to tell her good-bye.

863
01:10:50,081 --> 01:10:51,333
Come on, Doc.

864
01:10:52,584 --> 01:10:54,586
Think about it. What will you say to her?

865
01:10:54,711 --> 01:10:58,381
<i>"I've got to go back to the future"?
She won't understand that.</i>

866
01:10:58,507 --> 01:11:01,593
Hell, I'm in it with you,
and I don't even understand it.

867
01:11:04,596 --> 01:11:05,597
Doc.

868
01:11:06,264 --> 01:11:07,474
<i>Listen.</i>

869
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:10,352
<i>Maybe we...</i>

870
01:11:10,685 --> 01:11:13,188
Maybe we can just take Clara with us.

871
01:11:15,106 --> 01:11:16,358
To the future?

872
01:11:20,862 --> 01:11:25,325
As you reminded me, I'm a scientist,
so I must be scientific about this.

873
01:11:26,284 --> 01:11:29,621
I cautioned you about disrupting
the continuum for your own benefit.

874
01:11:29,746 --> 01:11:31,623
Therefore, I must do no less.

875
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,293
We shall proceed as planned,
and as soon as we return to 1985...

876
01:11:35,418 --> 01:11:37,754
we'll destroy this infernal machine.

877
01:11:38,839 --> 01:11:41,716
Traveling through time
has become much too painful.

878
01:12:12,706 --> 01:12:14,457
It's Emmett, Clara.

879
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:21,256
Emmett, won't you come in?

880
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,342
No, I better not. I...

881
01:12:26,887 --> 01:12:28,346
What's wrong?

882
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:31,266
I've come to say good-bye.

883
01:12:32,976 --> 01:12:35,187
Good-bye? Where are you going?

884
01:12:36,271 --> 01:12:37,480
I'm going away.

885
01:12:38,481 --> 01:12:41,067
I'm afraid I'll never see you again.

886
01:12:42,277 --> 01:12:43,278
Emmett.

887
01:12:43,695 --> 01:12:48,867
Clara, I want you to know
that I care about you deeply.

888
01:12:49,951 --> 01:12:54,206
But I've realized that I don't belong here,
and I have to go back where I came from.

889
01:12:55,457 --> 01:12:57,250
Where might that be?

890
01:12:58,210 --> 01:12:59,878
I can't tell you.

891
01:13:03,798 --> 01:13:06,176
Then wherever you're
going, take me with you.

892
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:08,470
I can't, Clara.

893
01:13:09,387 --> 01:13:11,431
I wish it didn't have to be this way...

894
01:13:11,556 --> 01:13:14,601
but believe me when I tell you
that I'll never forget you...

895
01:13:14,726 --> 01:13:17,103
and that I love you.

896
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:21,441
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

897
01:13:21,525 --> 01:13:22,567
Clara.

898
01:13:23,193 --> 01:13:25,987
I don't think there's any way
that you can understand it.

899
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:28,114
Please, I have to know.

900
01:13:28,698 --> 01:13:32,118
If you sincerely do love me,
then tell me the truth.

901
01:13:33,703 --> 01:13:34,955
All right then.

902
01:13:36,414 --> 01:13:38,208
I'm from the future.

903
01:13:39,668 --> 01:13:42,671
I came here in a time machine
that I invented...

904
01:13:42,796 --> 01:13:46,842
and tomorrow I have to go back
to the year 1985.

905
01:13:53,181 --> 01:13:54,432
Yes, Emmett.

906
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:57,269
I do understand.

907
01:14:00,105 --> 01:14:04,776
I understand that because you know I'm
partial to the writings of Jules Verne...

908
01:14:04,901 --> 01:14:08,697
you concocted those mendacities
in order to take advantage of me.

909
01:14:09,531 --> 01:14:11,658
I've heard some whoppers in my day...

910
01:14:11,783 --> 01:14:14,703
but the fact that you'd expect me
to believe this...

911
01:14:14,786 --> 01:14:17,539
is so insulting and degrading!

912
01:14:19,082 --> 01:14:22,961
<i>All you had to say is, "I don't love you
and I don't want to see you anymore."</i>

913
01:14:23,044 --> 01:14:25,839
That, at least, would have been respectful!

914
01:14:26,506 --> 01:14:27,966
But that's not the truth.

915
01:15:07,506 --> 01:15:08,840
Good to see you, too.

916
01:15:10,717 --> 01:15:14,179
Emmett. What can I get you, the usual?

917
01:15:14,262 --> 01:15:18,016
No, Chester, I'll need something
a lot stronger than that tonight.

918
01:15:18,141 --> 01:15:20,977
- Sarsaparilla.
- Whiskey, Chester.

919
01:15:21,895 --> 01:15:24,147
Whiskey? Are you sure?

920
01:15:24,272 --> 01:15:26,733
You know what happened to you
on the Fourth of July.

921
01:15:26,858 --> 01:15:28,109
Whiskey.

922
01:15:29,528 --> 01:15:31,530
Okay, I ain't your papa.

923
01:15:32,614 --> 01:15:35,825
Just don't want to see
you do the wrong thing.

924
01:15:37,077 --> 01:15:39,162
You can leave the bottle.

925
01:15:41,164 --> 01:15:42,958
It's a woman, right?

926
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:46,920
I knew it. I've seen that look
on a man's face...

927
01:15:47,045 --> 01:15:49,506
a thousand times all across the country.

928
01:15:49,589 --> 01:15:53,051
All I can tell you, friend,
is you'll get over her.

929
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,887
Clara was one in a million.

930
01:15:56,888 --> 01:16:00,600
One in a billion. One in a googolplex.

931
01:16:01,268 --> 01:16:04,855
The woman of my dreams,
and I've lost her for all time.

932
01:16:06,106 --> 01:16:09,192
I can assure you, sir,
there are other women.

933
01:16:09,484 --> 01:16:12,028
Peddling this barbed wire
across the country...

934
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:14,698
has taught me one thing for certain...

935
01:16:14,823 --> 01:16:17,784
it's that you never know
what the future might bring.

936
01:16:17,868 --> 01:16:21,788
The future. I can tell
you about the future.

937
01:16:32,674 --> 01:16:34,467
Man, did I sleep.

938
01:16:37,345 --> 01:16:39,181
What time is it, Doc?

939
01:16:43,059 --> 01:16:44,060
Doc!

940
01:16:55,363 --> 01:16:56,656
Wake up!

941
01:16:58,658 --> 01:17:00,410
<i>Get up! Let's go!</i>

942
01:17:01,786 --> 01:17:03,622
I got me a runt to kill.

943
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:06,750
It's still early, boss. What's your hurry?

944
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:08,960
I'm hungry.

945
01:17:09,878 --> 01:17:13,548
And in the future, we don't need horses.

946
01:17:14,758 --> 01:17:17,969
We have motorized carriages
called automobiles.

947
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:22,516
If everybody's got one of
these auto whatsits...

948
01:17:22,724 --> 01:17:25,310
does anybody walk or run anymore?

949
01:17:25,894 --> 01:17:29,648
Of course they run, but
for recreation, for fun.

950
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:33,485
Run for fun?
What the hell kind of fun is that?

951
01:17:43,828 --> 01:17:45,997
Doc!

952
01:17:52,879 --> 01:17:54,631
How much has he had?

953
01:17:54,714 --> 01:17:58,009
None. That's the first one,
and he hasn't touched it yet.

954
01:17:58,802 --> 01:18:00,303
<i>He just likes to hold it.</i>

955
01:18:03,932 --> 01:18:05,267
Doc!

956
01:18:06,059 --> 01:18:07,435
What are you doing?

957
01:18:07,978 --> 01:18:11,189
I've lost her, Marty.
There's nothing left for me here.

958
01:18:11,314 --> 01:18:13,108
That's why you gotta come back with me.

959
01:18:13,233 --> 01:18:15,527
- Where?
- Back to the future!

960
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:22,367
- Right! Let's get going!
- Great.

961
01:18:23,118 --> 01:18:26,329
Gentlemen, excuse me.
My friend and I have to catch a train.

962
01:18:26,454 --> 01:18:27,998
Here's to you, blacksmith.

963
01:18:28,081 --> 01:18:30,458
- And to the future.
- Amen.

964
01:18:30,959 --> 01:18:33,086
- Amen.
- Emmett, no!

965
01:18:40,594 --> 01:18:42,179
Doc!

966
01:18:44,556 --> 01:18:47,559
Come on, Doc. Wake up! Wake up, Doc!

967
01:18:48,685 --> 01:18:51,229
- How many did he have?
- Just the one.

968
01:18:51,354 --> 01:18:55,317
- Just the one? Come on, Doc.
- There's a fellow that can't hold his liquor.

969
01:18:55,442 --> 01:18:58,278
- Get me some black coffee!
- Joey, coffee!

970
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,748
Ma'am?

971
01:19:10,457 --> 01:19:14,794
- How far does the 8:00 train go?
- San Francisco is the end of the line.

972
01:19:16,546 --> 01:19:18,340
I'll take a one-way ticket.

973
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:24,346
To sober him up in a hurry, you need
something a lot stronger than coffee.

974
01:19:24,429 --> 01:19:26,056
What do you suggest?

975
01:19:26,932 --> 01:19:30,060
Joey, let's make some wake-up juice.

976
01:19:30,268 --> 01:19:32,145
Come on, Doc, swallow.

977
01:19:37,943 --> 01:19:39,361
In about 10 minutes...

978
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:43,615
he's gonna be as sober
as a priest on Sunday.

979
01:19:44,115 --> 01:19:45,116
Ten minutes!

980
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:47,869
Why do we cut these things so damn close?

981
01:19:47,994 --> 01:19:50,539
Here, stick this clothespin on his nose.

982
01:19:52,457 --> 01:19:56,753
<i>When he opens up his mouth,
go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.</i>

983
01:19:58,004 --> 01:19:59,381
Stand back.

984
01:20:18,316 --> 01:20:21,528
- He's still out!
- That was just a reflex action.

985
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:25,240
It'll take a few more minutes
for the stuff to clear up his head.

986
01:20:25,365 --> 01:20:26,324
Perfect.

987
01:20:47,596 --> 01:20:49,848
Come on, Doc. Wake up, buddy.

988
01:20:49,931 --> 01:20:51,266
<i>Wake up, Doc!</i>

989
01:20:52,767 --> 01:20:55,604
Seamus? Wouldn't expect to
see you here this morning.

990
01:20:55,729 --> 01:20:59,316
Aye. Something inside me told me
I should be here...

991
01:21:00,442 --> 01:21:03,320
as if my future had
something to do with it.

992
01:21:05,405 --> 01:21:08,241
He'll come around in a minute. Come on.

993
01:21:08,366 --> 01:21:10,952
Come on, Doc. Let's go!
Let's wake up now, buddy.

994
01:21:19,002 --> 01:21:20,879
Are you in there, Eastwood?

995
01:21:23,173 --> 01:21:26,468
It's 8:00 and I'm calling you out.

996
01:21:31,264 --> 01:21:32,807
It's not 8:00 yet!

997
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,060
It is by my watch!

998
01:21:35,352 --> 01:21:38,230
Let's settle this once and for all, runt!

999
01:21:39,856 --> 01:21:42,150
Or ain't you got the gumption?

1000
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,953
Listen.

1001
01:21:55,413 --> 01:21:57,874
I'm not really feeling up to this today.

1002
01:21:59,751 --> 01:22:04,214
- So I'll have to forfeit.
- Forfeit?

1003
01:22:05,257 --> 01:22:06,550
<i>What's that mean?</i>

1004
01:22:07,968 --> 01:22:12,097
- It means that you win without a fight.
- Without shooting? He can't do that.

1005
01:22:12,222 --> 01:22:13,557
You can't do that!

1006
01:22:14,391 --> 01:22:16,017
<i>You know what I think?</i>

1007
01:22:16,142 --> 01:22:19,563
I think you ain't nothing but a gutless,
yellow turd!

1008
01:22:19,646 --> 01:22:23,817
<i>I'm giving you to the count of 10
to come out here and prove I'm wrong!</i>

1009
01:22:24,776 --> 01:22:25,902
<i>One!</i>

1010
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:28,905
Doc, come on, sober up, buddy.

1011
01:22:28,989 --> 01:22:31,366
- Two!
- You better get out there, son.

1012
01:22:31,491 --> 01:22:34,744
I got $20 gold bet on you,
so don't let me down.

1013
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:35,745
Three!

1014
01:22:35,871 --> 01:22:40,166
I got $30 gold bet against you,
so don't let me down.

1015
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:41,126
Four!

1016
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:45,755
You better face up to it, son,
because if you don't go out there...

1017
01:22:45,881 --> 01:22:47,299
- What?
- Five!

1018
01:22:48,758 --> 01:22:51,803
- What if I don't go out there?
- You're a coward.

1019
01:22:51,887 --> 01:22:52,804
Six!

1020
01:22:52,971 --> 01:22:56,099
And you'll be branded a coward
for the rest of your days!

1021
01:22:56,183 --> 01:23:00,353
Everybody everywhere will
say Clint Eastwood...

1022
01:23:00,478 --> 01:23:03,190
is the biggest yellow-belly in the West!

1023
01:23:08,361 --> 01:23:09,821
Seven!

1024
01:23:10,322 --> 01:23:11,323
Here!

1025
01:23:15,619 --> 01:23:16,786
Eight!

1026
01:23:25,629 --> 01:23:27,088
I already got a gun.

1027
01:23:28,924 --> 01:23:30,050
Nine!

1028
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,264
Ten!

1029
01:23:41,228 --> 01:23:42,854
Do you hear me, runt?

1030
01:23:42,979 --> 01:23:46,650
I said that's 10,
you gutless, yellow pie-slinger!

1031
01:23:50,904 --> 01:23:52,322
He's an asshole!

1032
01:23:53,114 --> 01:23:55,158
<i>I don't care what Tannen says!</i>

1033
01:23:55,283 --> 01:23:57,869
I don't care what anybody else says either.

1034
01:23:59,287 --> 01:24:02,457
- Doc, you okay?
- I think so.

1035
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:04,501
What a headache!

1036
01:24:04,668 --> 01:24:07,379
- You got a back door to this place?
- It's in the back.

1037
01:24:07,504 --> 01:24:08,672
Let's go.

1038
01:24:09,005 --> 01:24:12,551
Are you coming out here
or do I have to come in after you?

1039
01:24:13,969 --> 01:24:16,471
The thing I really miss here is Tylenol.

1040
01:24:17,138 --> 01:24:18,139
Hey!

1041
01:24:24,062 --> 01:24:25,772
Reach, blacksmith!

1042
01:24:42,497 --> 01:24:45,250
Yes, sir, that poor fellow last night...

1043
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:49,004
had the worst case of broken heart
I have ever seen.

1044
01:24:49,129 --> 01:24:52,424
When he said he didn't know
how he could live the rest of his life...

1045
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:55,302
knowing how much hurt
he'd caused that little girl...

1046
01:24:55,427 --> 01:24:59,264
I really felt for
him, I did, right here.

1047
01:25:04,269 --> 01:25:06,021
Listen up, Eastwood!

1048
01:25:06,229 --> 01:25:09,524
I aim to shoot somebody today,
and I prefer it'd be you.

1049
01:25:09,608 --> 01:25:11,818
But if you're just too damn yellow...

1050
01:25:12,277 --> 01:25:14,654
it'll just have to be
your blacksmith friend.

1051
01:25:14,738 --> 01:25:17,699
Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself!

1052
01:25:22,245 --> 01:25:26,750
You got one minute to decide.
You hear me, runt? One minute!

1053
01:25:30,045 --> 01:25:32,964
I've never seen a man so broken up
over a woman.

1054
01:25:33,089 --> 01:25:35,717
What did he say her name was?
Cara? Sara?

1055
01:25:35,842 --> 01:25:37,010
- Clara.
- Clara.

1056
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,390
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am?

1057
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:46,728
Was this man tall,
with great big brown puppy-dog eyes...

1058
01:25:46,853 --> 01:25:48,980
and long silvery, flowing hair?

1059
01:25:49,606 --> 01:25:50,899
You know him.

1060
01:25:53,777 --> 01:25:55,195
Emmett!

1061
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:11,336
Time's up, runt!

1062
01:26:17,592 --> 01:26:20,011
Prepare to meet your maker, blacksmith.

1063
01:26:20,428 --> 01:26:22,222
Right here, Tannen!

1064
01:27:00,093 --> 01:27:01,261
Draw!

1065
01:27:04,598 --> 01:27:05,599
No!

1066
01:27:20,906 --> 01:27:23,408
I thought we could settle this like men.

1067
01:27:25,076 --> 01:27:27,162
You thought wrong, dude.

1068
01:27:49,434 --> 01:27:50,852
Thank you.

1069
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,084
That was good.

1070
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,755
You know what I think?

1071
01:29:01,047 --> 01:29:03,133
- I think Buford's going to jail.
- Yeah.

1072
01:29:09,014 --> 01:29:10,974
Get him out of that shit.

1073
01:29:11,433 --> 01:29:12,642
Get them!

1074
01:29:16,938 --> 01:29:21,651
Buford Tannen, you're under arrest
for robbing the Pine City stage.

1075
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:23,486
You got anything to say?

1076
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,452
I hate manure.

1077
01:29:30,911 --> 01:29:31,995
Look!

1078
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:36,791
Yes!

1079
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:40,462
- The train!
- Can we make it?

1080
01:29:40,587 --> 01:29:42,839
We'll have to cut them off at Coyote Pass.

1081
01:29:45,258 --> 01:29:47,469
Hey, mister. Mr. Eastwood.

1082
01:29:47,928 --> 01:29:50,639
- Here's your gun, mister.
- Thanks, kid.

1083
01:29:55,644 --> 01:29:56,645
Seamus.

1084
01:29:58,438 --> 01:30:00,941
It's worth $12. Never been used.

1085
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:06,154
- Maybe I'll trade it for a new hat.
- Right! Take care of that baby!

1086
01:30:07,781 --> 01:30:09,032
I will!

1087
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:16,581
Emmett!

1088
01:30:19,209 --> 01:30:20,210
Emmett!

1089
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:22,921
Emmett!

1090
01:30:27,759 --> 01:30:29,219
<i>"Time machine."</i>

1091
01:31:13,138 --> 01:31:14,514
Come on!

1092
01:31:17,976 --> 01:31:20,228
- Go!
- Give me your hand!

1093
01:31:50,884 --> 01:31:52,135
Come on!

1094
01:31:56,306 --> 01:31:57,766
Come on, Marty.

1095
01:32:02,229 --> 01:32:03,688
Come on. Let's go!

1096
01:32:12,447 --> 01:32:14,115
Masks on.

1097
01:32:28,797 --> 01:32:31,383
- Reach!
- Is this a holdup?

1098
01:32:33,218 --> 01:32:35,303
It's a science experiment.

1099
01:32:35,428 --> 01:32:38,515
<i>Stop the train just before you hit
the switch track up ahead.</i>

1100
01:32:54,406 --> 01:32:57,701
- Doc!
- Uncouple the cars from the tender!

1101
01:33:24,311 --> 01:33:26,563
I've wanted to do that all my life.

1102
01:34:00,305 --> 01:34:01,640
What are these things?

1103
01:34:01,765 --> 01:34:05,018
My version of Presto Logs.
Compressed wood with anthracite dust...

1104
01:34:05,143 --> 01:34:07,270
chemically treated to
burn hotter and longer.

1105
01:34:07,395 --> 01:34:09,648
I use them so I don't
have to stoke my forge.

1106
01:34:09,773 --> 01:34:11,900
These three will ignite sequentially...

1107
01:34:12,025 --> 01:34:14,778
make the fire hotter,
kick up the boiler pressure...

1108
01:34:14,903 --> 01:34:16,321
and make the train go faster.

1109
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,334
Ready to roll!

1110
01:35:01,533 --> 01:35:02,534
Emmett!

1111
01:35:07,539 --> 01:35:09,249
Marty, are the time circuits on?

1112
01:35:11,084 --> 01:35:12,002
Check!

1113
01:35:12,669 --> 01:35:14,713
Input the destination time:

1114
01:35:14,838 --> 01:35:18,300
October 27, 1985, 11:00 a.m.

1115
01:35:19,968 --> 01:35:23,805
Check. We're cruising
at a steady 25 miles an hour.

1116
01:35:24,556 --> 01:35:26,266
<i>I'm throwing in the Presto Logs.</i>

1117
01:35:35,859 --> 01:35:39,446
<i>The new dashboard gauge
will tell us the boiler temperature.</i>

1118
01:35:39,571 --> 01:35:42,824
<i>It's color-coded to indicate
when each log will fire.</i>

1119
01:35:42,949 --> 01:35:44,826
Green, yellow and red.

1120
01:35:45,327 --> 01:35:48,788
<i>Each detonation will be accompanied
by a sudden burst of acceleration.</i>

1121
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:55,670
<i>Hopefully we'll hit 88 miles per hour
before the needle gets much past 2,000.</i>

1122
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:58,340
Why? What happens after it hits 2,000?

1123
01:35:58,673 --> 01:36:00,467
The whole boiler explodes!

1124
01:36:01,885 --> 01:36:02,761
Perfect!

1125
01:36:18,193 --> 01:36:21,112
<i>- We just hit 35!
- Okay, Marty.</i>

1126
01:36:21,488 --> 01:36:23,490
I'm coming aboard!

1127
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,251
Emmett!

1128
01:36:39,214 --> 01:36:40,340
Come on.

1129
01:36:50,267 --> 01:36:53,687
You better hold onto something!
The yellow log is about to blow!

1130
01:36:58,692 --> 01:36:59,943
Golly.

1131
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,447
We just passed 40!

1132
01:37:37,939 --> 01:37:38,940
Emmett!

1133
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:44,237
We just passed 45! Go for it!

1134
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:55,540
Fifty.

1135
01:38:06,718 --> 01:38:07,719
Emmett!

1136
01:38:07,886 --> 01:38:08,887
Clara!

1137
01:38:09,888 --> 01:38:11,264
I love you!

1138
01:38:13,475 --> 01:38:18,522
- What's happening?
- It's Clara! She's on the train!

1139
01:38:19,481 --> 01:38:20,815
Clara? Perfect.

1140
01:38:21,566 --> 01:38:24,653
She's in the cab! I'm going back for her!

1141
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:26,571
The windmill!

1142
01:38:26,738 --> 01:38:30,242
Doc! We're going past 50!
You'll never make it!

1143
01:38:32,452 --> 01:38:36,248
Then we'll have to take her back with us!
Keep calling out the speed!

1144
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:39,835
Clara, climb out here to me!

1145
01:38:40,293 --> 01:38:43,129
- I don't know if I can!
- You can do it!

1146
01:38:43,547 --> 01:38:45,173
Just don't look down!

1147
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:50,554
That's it!

1148
01:39:04,359 --> 01:39:05,944
Sixty miles an hour!

1149
01:39:09,322 --> 01:39:12,325
You're doing fine! Nice and steady!

1150
01:39:15,704 --> 01:39:17,122
Come on!

1151
01:39:17,914 --> 01:39:21,877
- Just a little further!
- I can't! I'm scared!

1152
01:39:24,337 --> 01:39:28,049
- Seventy!
- Keep coming, Clara!

1153
01:39:29,342 --> 01:39:32,179
Come on! You're doing fine!

1154
01:39:34,139 --> 01:39:37,684
<i>Come on! Nice and easy!</i>

1155
01:39:38,643 --> 01:39:42,063
<i>Don't look down! That's it!
You're doing fine!</i>

1156
01:39:44,608 --> 01:39:46,985
The red log is about to blow!

1157
01:39:56,411 --> 01:39:57,412
Clara!

1158
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:02,000
Emmett!

1159
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,762
I'm trying to reach you!

1160
01:40:13,929 --> 01:40:15,764
- Clara, hold on!
- I can't!

1161
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:28,485
I'll slip you the Hoverboard!

1162
01:40:36,034 --> 01:40:37,827
Marty, watch out!

1163
01:40:45,836 --> 01:40:47,462
Emmett, help!

1164
01:40:50,215 --> 01:40:51,508
Hold on!

1165
01:40:55,178 --> 01:40:57,055
Ready, Doc?

1166
01:40:57,931 --> 01:40:58,932
<i>Catch it!</i>

1167
01:41:00,684 --> 01:41:01,768
Yes!

1168
01:41:12,904 --> 01:41:13,905
Emmett!

1169
01:41:14,489 --> 01:41:15,490
Clara!

1170
01:44:00,447 --> 01:44:01,573
Well, Doc...

1171
01:44:03,533 --> 01:44:04,951
it's destroyed.

1172
01:44:07,495 --> 01:44:08,872
Just like you wanted.

1173
01:44:28,391 --> 01:44:30,602
- Hey, butthead, get away...
- Watch it, Biff!

1174
01:44:30,727 --> 01:44:33,438
I didn't mean to scare you.
I didn't recognize you.

1175
01:44:33,563 --> 01:44:37,609
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just putting on the second coat.

1176
01:44:39,361 --> 01:44:40,695
You going cowboy?

1177
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:43,573
Come on, guys. We'll be late for brunch.

1178
01:44:44,741 --> 01:44:47,536
Dad, they won't hold your
reservations all day.

1179
01:44:47,661 --> 01:44:48,995
I can't find my glasses.

1180
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:52,624
- Have you seen them?
- They're in your suede jacket.

1181
01:44:52,749 --> 01:44:55,418
Marty? What's wrong?
We thought you went to the lake.

1182
01:44:55,544 --> 01:44:58,755
- You wore that to the lake?
- Thank God you guys are back to normal.

1183
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,550
Who are you supposed to be? Clint Eastwood?

1184
01:45:01,967 --> 01:45:04,469
Right. I have to go get Jennifer.

1185
01:45:08,765 --> 01:45:11,351
- I really like that hat.
- Thanks, Biff.

1186
01:45:26,324 --> 01:45:27,325
Jennifer.

1187
01:45:29,911 --> 01:45:30,912
Jen.

1188
01:45:35,375 --> 01:45:36,376
Jennifer.

1189
01:45:59,858 --> 01:46:00,859
Marty.

1190
01:46:02,319 --> 01:46:03,320
Marty!

1191
01:46:05,322 --> 01:46:06,781
I had the worst nightmare.

1192
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:15,790
That dream I had is so real.

1193
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:18,752
It was about the future.

1194
01:46:19,836 --> 01:46:21,046
About us.

1195
01:46:21,713 --> 01:46:23,173
And you got fired.

1196
01:46:24,132 --> 01:46:26,510
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, I got fired?

1197
01:46:27,552 --> 01:46:28,386
<i>Hilldale.</i>

1198
01:46:29,846 --> 01:46:31,723
<i>Hilldale! This is where we live.</i>

1199
01:46:33,391 --> 01:46:36,311
I mean, this is where we're going to live.

1200
01:46:38,104 --> 01:46:39,189
Someday.

1201
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:45,195
It was a dream, wasn't it?

1202
01:46:50,575 --> 01:46:51,993
The big M.

1203
01:46:53,161 --> 01:46:56,248
- How's it hanging, McFly?
- Hey, Needles.

1204
01:46:56,373 --> 01:47:00,377
Nice set of wheels.
Let's see what she can do.

1205
01:47:00,502 --> 01:47:03,088
- Next green light.
- No, thanks.

1206
01:47:04,089 --> 01:47:06,591
What's the matter? Chicken?

1207
01:47:11,346 --> 01:47:14,057
- Marty, don't.
- Grab hold of something.

1208
01:47:14,975 --> 01:47:16,893
- Come on!
- Get on!

1209
01:47:18,562 --> 01:47:19,855
Yeah, go!

1210
01:47:43,086 --> 01:47:44,713
Did you do that on purpose?

1211
01:47:44,838 --> 01:47:47,632
Yeah. You think I'm stupid enough
to race that asshole?

1212
01:47:53,263 --> 01:47:56,224
Jeez! I would have hit that Rolls-Royce.

1213
01:48:06,234 --> 01:48:07,694
It erased.

1214
01:48:21,791 --> 01:48:24,085
You're right. There's not much left.

1215
01:48:26,421 --> 01:48:28,089
Doc's never coming back.

1216
01:48:43,021 --> 01:48:44,564
I'll sure miss him, Jen.

1217
01:48:57,244 --> 01:48:58,828
What the hell?

1218
01:49:15,971 --> 01:49:18,557
- Doc!
- Marty!

1219
01:49:18,849 --> 01:49:21,268
- Doc!
- Marty!

1220
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:23,436
It runs on steam!

1221
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:32,070
Meet the family. Clara, you know.

1222
01:49:32,237 --> 01:49:34,781
- Hi, Marty!
- Ma'am!

1223
01:49:35,991 --> 01:49:37,534
These are our boys:

1224
01:49:38,869 --> 01:49:42,497
Jules and Verne.

1225
01:49:45,667 --> 01:49:48,461
Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.

1226
01:49:51,756 --> 01:49:55,760
- Doc, I thought I'd never see you again.
- You can't keep a good scientist down.

1227
01:49:56,011 --> 01:49:58,054
I had to come back for Einstein...

1228
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:01,057
and I didn't want you
to be worried about me.

1229
01:50:02,058 --> 01:50:05,437
I brought you a little souvenir.

1230
01:50:22,746 --> 01:50:23,955
It's great, Doc.

1231
01:50:25,081 --> 01:50:26,333
Thanks.

1232
01:50:28,293 --> 01:50:32,005
Dr. Brown, I brought this note
back from the future...

1233
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:34,382
and now it's erased.

1234
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:36,760
Of course it's erased.

1235
01:50:38,553 --> 01:50:39,888
What does that mean?

1236
01:50:40,013 --> 01:50:43,308
It means your future
hasn't been written yet.

1237
01:50:43,808 --> 01:50:45,352
No one's has.

1238
01:50:45,477 --> 01:50:50,524
Your future is whatever you make it.
So make it a good one, both of you.

1239
01:50:53,777 --> 01:50:55,028
We will, Doc!

1240
01:50:55,153 --> 01:50:56,613
Stand back!

1241
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:59,074
<i>All right, boys, buckle up!</i>

1242
01:51:04,162 --> 01:51:09,167
Where are you going now?
Back to the future?

1243
01:51:10,043 --> 01:51:12,838
No. Already been there.
