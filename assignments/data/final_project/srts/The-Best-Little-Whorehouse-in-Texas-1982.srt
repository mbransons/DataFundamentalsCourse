253
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,624
My girls would love to show

262
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,937
You're in bed already. So?

263
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:56,356
So, I told you 100 times,

264
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,441
watching you get
undressed is the best part.

265
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,402
The best part?

266
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:03,405
Well, maybe not the best part,
but in the top two.

267

Now, would I wanna disappoint
my little honey?

Me too! You just hold your horses.
I got a surprise for you.

270
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,509
I went by the post office this morning.

271
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:24,138
I picked up a package. The very latest
thing from Frederick's of Hollywood.

272
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,309
Yeah?
- Just a little something sexy

273
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,058
I thought you might like.

274
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,176

275
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,514

276
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:30,974
Well, it certainly
ain't a trainin' bra,

277
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,775
but I do believe I can fill it out.

278
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,193
I don't think you
got any problem there.

279
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:36,145
I'll be back with more.

280
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:39,316
You know, Mona,

281
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,651
I've known a lot of women in my life.

282
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,829
None of 'em has ever been
exciting to me like you are.

283
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,492
Really? Even after all these years
we've been meetin' like this?

284
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,038
I'll tell you something.

285
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:57,922
A year with you is like
a minute of sheer happiness.

286
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:02,339
Well, now, that is just about
the sweetest thing anybody ever said to me.

287
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,473
I know.

288
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,302
You know, honey,

289
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:10,897

290
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:22,154
You did that real fast.

291
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,114
Well, honey, I've had a lot of practice

292
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:25,695
gettin' in and out of my clothes.

293
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,914
How do you like the outfit?

294
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:30,283
Hot damn.

295
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:32,793
Makes me feel real sexy.

296
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,715
Well, you don't look real sexy.

297
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:43,922
What do you mean?
I look like I always look.

298
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:45,264
That's just it.

299
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:46,761
It's them damn droopy boxer drawers.

300
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:48,388
I just hate the looks of them things.

301
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:50,436
I've worn boxer shorts for years!

302
00:17:50,511 --> 00:17:52,058
And they look like it.

303
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,232
These are a brand-new pair.

304
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:56,476
I don't know what you're talkin'
about, "I don't look sexy."

305
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,779
People tell me I have a real
sexy quality about me.

306
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:02,194
Well, you do,
but them boxer shorts don't.

307
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:06,073
But when I was gettin' me some
sexy things, I thought about you,

308
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,496
because they have a his 'n' hers
sexy department at Frederick's

309
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:10,744
and I thought you
might try that on for size.

310
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,168
What the hell is it,
a Japanese slingshot?

311
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:19,295
No, it's jockey shorts with
little silver snaps on the side.

312
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:23,595
Little is the key word here.
They are real little.

313
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,717
In fact, a guy could hurt
himself wearin' those things.

314
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:27,423
I don't think so, thank you very much.

315
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:32,346
Ed Earl, I paid $20 for these, plus
postage. And I want you to wear it.

316
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,897
Aw, you paid $20 for these?

317
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:36,064
Yes!

318
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:37,441
Well, you got screwed.

319
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,228
Come on, Ed Earl!

320
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:41,775
No!

321
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,982
If they look half as good on you
as I think they're going to

322
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:46,284
you ain't gonna have to
wear 'em but a second.

323
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,527
Maybe less.

324
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,572
They're ridiculous. They're impossible.

325
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:51,702
They're sexy.

326
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:53,328
No, no, no!

327
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:56,457
Well, fine! Then I'm gettin'
dressed and goin' home.

328
00:18:56,619 --> 00:19:00,465
Well, fine! I'm goin' in
the bathroom and... Put these on.

329
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:07,843
Be like puttin' two bowling
balls in a marble bag.

330
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:11,051
Braggin', braggin', braggin'.

331
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:17,808
Well, I saw Dulcie Mae in town today.

332
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:19,058
Yeah?

333
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,815
I guess you'll be goin' over
there for Thanksgivin' dinner.

334
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:23,358
Don't I always?

335
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:25,989
You know, you better check
that turkey of hers,

336
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,658
because there's a hook
in there that's gonna

337
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,485
drag your ass to a wedding chapel.

338
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:32,580
No way.

339
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:39,500
I don't believe in matrimony.
It screws up a relationship.

340
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,456
Amen to that, Ed Earl.

341
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:44,000
Ready?

342
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,343
I'm always ready.

343
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:54,511
Well, hellfire. Is that it?

344
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:55,803
How'd you like it?

345
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,680
I didn't hardly get to even see them!

346
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:00,270
That's all you're gonna see,

347
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,101
'cause I ain't gonna parade
around like no model.

348
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,487
Come on, Ed Earl. For me.

349
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:05,859
No! No.

350
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,324
Come on. One itsy-bitsy peek?

351
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:09,946
What are you doin'? Man!

352
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:14,873
Now, that's what
the little silver snaps are for.

353
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:17,117
Work, don't they?

354
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,410
Just like a snap.

355
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:22,914
Come on over here and give me
a little lip-lock.

356
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,331
Gotta brush my teeth.

357
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,921
You know how I am about my breath.

358
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:38,597
Ed Earl, I like a lot of things,

359
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,977
but these afternoons with you
have got to top the list.

360
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,602

Sheriff!

406
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:50,019
It's Deputy...
- Fred.

407
00:22:54,648 --> 00:22:59,529
Hold that position?

408
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,456
Don't move. Be right back.

409
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,549
This better be important.

410
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:16,720
Well, I think it is.

411
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,298
I saw your car parked from the highway

412
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,802
and I figured your
phone was out, because...

413
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,259
What are you wearin' that for?

414
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,435
Takin' a shower.

415
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:24,511
Really?

416
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:25,725
I always take my shower in the mornin'.

417
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,603
<i>I read in the Reader's Digest...

418
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:29,228
I don't care!

419
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,185
What do you want?

420
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:33,145
It's the mayor.
He wants to speak to you.

421
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:35,231
Rita's been callin' all
over the county for you.

422
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,903
He wants a meeting right away.

423
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,029
Can't it wait?

424
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,827
You mean till after your shower?

425
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:42,284
You go to your radio.

426
00:23:42,613 --> 00:23:44,240
Tell him I'll be
there when I get there.

427
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:47,243
Nothing can be that important that
it can't wait till this afternoon.

428
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:48,577
Right, Sheriff.

429
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,414
Nice man, but dumb.

430
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:01,925
Mona?

431
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:03,717
Mona?

432
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:42,855
Ain't that funny?
All this time Miss Mona

433
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:44,925
was at the back
knockin' on the screen door.

434
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:47,849
She said she's in a real big hurry but
just dropped by to give you this.

435
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,726
It's a Japanese slingshot.

436
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:59,698
Well, look at that! At last!

437
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:01,992
Okay, Rufus. What's on your mind?

438
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,239
Something that could have serious

439
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,912
implications to
the health of this town!

440
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:06,705
Tell him, C.J.! Just like you told me.

441
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,140
Well, Sheriff, I have this friend
that works in a TV station

442
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,246
down in Houston.

443
00:25:10,326 --> 00:25:12,579
He tipped me off
that Melvin P. Thorpe's

444
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:15,084
plannin' an expose
on the Chicken Ranch.

445
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:16,589
Who?

446
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:18,008
Melvin P. Thorpe!

447
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,630
He's that crazy consumer advocate.

448
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,883
Has a report on the late night news.

449
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,757
He's got a new show now,
a half hour once a week,

450
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,138
<i>The Watchdog Report.</i>
It's on tonight.

451
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,559
The Chicken Ranch on TV.
Now, come on, fellas.

452
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:33,224
Television is a family medium.

453
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:34,934
But he's a sensationalist, Ed Earl.

454
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:38,191
He shows up with his TV cameras every
time a consumer has a complaint.

455
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,113
He's a menace to
the business community.

456
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:43,158
He's that feller that put
the peanuts back in the chocolate bar.

457
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:45,910
What?

458
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:47,988
He made the makers of
the Peanut Delight candy bar

459
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:50,291
admit that they put less peanuts

460
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:51,993
in each bar than they advertised.

461
00:25:52,076 --> 00:25:53,316
He made them change their ways.

462
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,321
Sounds like a tough customer.

463
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,268
He's got a lot of influence out there.

464
00:25:57,665 --> 00:25:59,545
If he brings cameras out
to the Chicken Ranch...

465
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,970
Come on, Rufus!
I'll make some phone calls.

466
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:06,799
I got a little influence
around this state myself.

467
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:12,935
Well, it's no use talkin'
to me about it, Sheriff!

468
00:26:13,263 --> 00:26:16,312
Melvin P. Thorpe is now the biggest
attraction at this station.

469
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:21,071
High ratings. Lots of letters.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

470
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:23,486
Hell, he wants to go national!

471
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,943
Wants to be watchdog
for the whole U.S. of A.

472
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:27,703
Love to help you, Ed Earl,

473
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:30,138
but just like you don't want to
mess with the Chicken Ranch,

474
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:32,199
I don't wanna ruffle
this old bird's feathers.

475
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,874
Here in Houston, he's becomin'
a regular Texas attraction.

476
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:38,168
Well, now, wait a minute, Ed Earl.

477
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:42,218
I'd tread easy on this one. Them
TV boys can be mighty powerful.

478
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:44,549
And mighty useful,
if you get my meaning.

479
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:46,005
Senator, roll call.

480
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:48,682
Excuse me, Ed Earl. I gotta go.

481
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:51,135
It's that damn
bilingual bullshit again.

482
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,012
Let me give you a word of advice from

483
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:55,310
one elected official to another.

484
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:58,066
Be careful of the box*.
* TV.

485
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,115
Son of a bitch.
What the hell's going on?

486
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,942
This goddam Melvin P. Thorpe's
got the whole state bamboozled.

487
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:09,279
This is serious, Ed Earl.
You gotta do something.

488
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:11,367
I intend to.

489
00:27:12,322 --> 00:27:15,371
Deputy Fred. I want you to hold
down the fort for a while.

490
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:16,869
Me? Yeah, you.

491
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:18,374
Where you goin'?

492
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:19,626
I'm goin' to Houston.
I'm gonna take care

493
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,207
of that little peckerwood* myself.
* White trash.

494
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:44,313
This is it. Thank you.

495
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,696
Come in.

496
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,447
Mr Thorpe?

497
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:53,868
I know you.

498
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:55,495
You do?

499
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:59,454
Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd. They told
me you were here. Come on in.

500
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:02,498
I hope I'm not...

501
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:04,917
Interrupting anything.

502
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,044
Please! It's my pleasure, my honor.

503
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:08,629
What brings you here to Houston?

504
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:10,305
Sit down. Anywhere over here.

505
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,803
I'm gettin' dressed.

506
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,678
Sit down. I've got my TV show to do,

507
00:28:15,803 --> 00:28:17,350
and I'm runnin' a bit behind time.

508
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:19,848
It's your show I want
to talk to you about, Mr Thorpe.

509
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:22,392
Melvin.

510
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:24,436
Please. You watch the show, Ed?

511
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,692
Well...
- Last week

512
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,574
was the best ratin' we ever had.

513
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:31,906
The city planning commissioner
was drivin' a city car...

514
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:33,487
Just hold that for me, will you?

515
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:37,742
While he was on vacation.
Caught him dead to rights.

516
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:40,081
That pitiful putz.
Would you just pull that up?

517
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,128
What?
- Just pull that up.

518
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:45,795
And we broke a 30 share.

519
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,876
It's affectin' my pieces
on the late night news.

520
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:51,259
Up, up, up. They just
love my little report.

521
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:54,932
I hear you're very popular.

522
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:00,766
The power of television, of public
exposure, is so great it scares me.

523
00:29:01,014 --> 00:29:03,517
I swear, I could get
the mayor's own children

524
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,601
to throw rocks at him.

525
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,400
Which show did you like best, Ed?

526
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,276
I think the one about the...

527
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,523
Nuts in the chocolate bar.

528
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:14,662
That's one of my favorites.

529
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:18,202
"Threescore" means 60,
like the Bible says.

530
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:21,377
So, if it says "60
nuts" on the wrapper,

531
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:24,500
I wanna see 60 nuts inside.

532
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,379
And I'm talkin' full nuts.
I'm not talkin' a half nut,

533
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:29,751
or nut bits or nut chips.

534
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:32,971
I'm talkin' a full nut.

535
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:38,806
I can see that.

536
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:43,516
Thank God we still live in
a society where anything

537
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,693
that's phony or dishonest
can't stand the light of day.

538
00:29:47,477 --> 00:29:49,445
Sock. Beg your pardon?

539
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,818
Sock.

540
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:52,991
Thank you. Yeah.

541
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,905
Most corporations involved
in false advertisin'

542
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,624
would just laugh at a $50 fine.

543
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,331
But you show up with your TV camera

544
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,708
and give them a little bad publicity

545
00:30:05,996 --> 00:30:09,967
and they shape up faster than goose
shit slides through a tin horn.

546
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:17,926
Well, Melvin, it's that bad publicity
I want to talk to you about.

547
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:20,428
That could hurt people.
You take that report

548
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,057
you're doin' on the Chicken Ranch.

549
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,682
That place is older
than rocks and water.

550
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:28,060
I wouldn't be surprised if your
granddaddy took your daddy out there

551
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:29,690
to learn about the birds and the bees.

552
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,525
I'm from New Jersey.

553
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:37,486
See, I moved to Houston six years ago.

554
00:30:37,694 --> 00:30:39,492
Texas suits my style.

555
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:42,749
The point I'm tryin' to make is

556
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:45,168
that every schoolboy in
the state knows about it.

557
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,754
Most of the politicians
have slept there.

558
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:49,957
And the mayor and the people of
my county that voted for me,

559
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,667
they want to keep
things just the way they are.

560
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:55,679
You know something,
Sheriff, it just struck me.

561
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,182
We are in the same profession.

562
00:30:58,257 --> 00:30:59,304
What's that?

563
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:00,760
Law enforcement.

564
00:31:00,842 --> 00:31:03,686
I'm out there fightin' for
the rights of the public, just like you.

565
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:06,390
Both of us are interested
in protectin' the public.

566
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:10,152
You in the old way, and me in the new.

567
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:11,903
The new?

568
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:13,697
Television.

569
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:16,404
I'm the electronic bounty hunter.

570
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:18,702
I use a camera, you use a gun.

571
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,196
Yeah.

572
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:21,747
Well, Melvin, everybody'd be happy

573
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:23,119
if you'd just drop the whole thing.

574
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,123
I mean, those ladies out there,

575
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,504
they perform a necessary function.

576
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:30,626
I mean, right or wrong...

577
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:32,208
Right or wrong don't interest me!

578
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:36,212
I'm no moralizer. I leave
all that to the preacher.

579
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,217
Well, I'm glad.

580
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,341
Anyway, the mayor was thinkin' maybe

581
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:41,767
you'd want a little
unnecessary publicity.

582
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:45,813
Unnecessary publicity?
He's got me all wrong!

583
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:49,517
I'm not one of those sensation
mongers out to boost his own ego!

584
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,642
Clear.

585
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,487
How do you like it?

586
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:54,688
It's different.

587
00:31:55,063 --> 00:31:57,486
I designed this myself.

588
00:31:57,607 --> 00:32:02,238
No, you tell your mayor he's got
nothing to fear from me on that score.

589
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:04,323
He'll be happy to hear that.

590
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:06,124
I'm a lawman. That's my interest.

I don't think I'm the type.

Nonsense! You're exactly what

welcome to The Watchdog Report,

620
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:34,163
that has been allowed to exist
for close to a 100 years.

I'm talkin' about

is Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd!

627

00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,416
is that headed out
for the Chicken Ranch.

789
00:41:50,491 --> 00:41:52,038
Right, Sheriff?

790
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:56,665
Little fat buddy,
up to now you got two tickets.

791
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:59,964
One for paradin' without a license
and the other for insultin' me.

792
00:42:00,627 --> 00:42:02,675
Now, you better get that
travellin' circus out of town

793
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:05,223
or I'm gonna lock you up so
fast your corset's gonna pop!

794
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:08,260
Yeah? We're perfectly within the law.

795
00:42:08,551 --> 00:42:11,350
As a newsman, I have
First Amendment protection.

796
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:13,477
Get this.

797
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:17,269
The public has a right to know
what is goin' on out there

798
00:42:17,352 --> 00:42:20,606
and what kind of pay-off
you're acceptin' to protect

799
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:22,816
that notorious house of ill repute.

800
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:41,467
First thing. First thing is you're
standin' in Lanville County,

801
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:44,216
which, by my figurin',
is about a 100 miles west

802
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,343
of that stink hole you call Houston.

803
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,558
So I can't see
it's any of your business

804
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:50,101
what goes on out here.

805
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:53,138
Yeah? Please...

806
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:57,643
Number two. You ain't
the law around here and I am.

807
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:00,945
So don't be tellin' me what
my goddamn job is,

808
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,070
or I'll whip your butt so bad it'll
look like the stripes on a barber pole.

809
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:06,317
Get him, Sheriff.

810
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:07,869
May be mean, but he's ours!

811
00:43:07,944 --> 00:43:10,663
Number three.
No sawed-off little pecker

812
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:13,833
is gonna accuse me of takin'
a bribe and live to tell about it

813
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:16,457
'cause I wear the badge
in this goddamn county.

814
00:43:16,536 --> 00:43:20,291
So you listen and listen good, you
over-padded, televisin' turd.

815
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,626
If I ever see you or any
of those little bastards

816
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,627
that work for you in my town again,

817
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:26,880
I'm gonna knock you
so flat you're gonna

818
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:28,510
have to roll down your socks to shit!

819
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:31,851
That's tellin' him, Sheriff!

820
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:33,223
My goodness!

821
00:43:33,428 --> 00:43:35,101
So get outta here, you goddamn,

822
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,808
wig-wearin', citified son of a bitch!

823
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:46,700
Holy shit! My God, that man's crazy!

824
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:55,249
Move, you schmuck!

825
00:43:57,952 --> 00:43:59,795
Move this mother! Come on!

826
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:04,129
Get outta here! Move this thing!

827
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,337
Come on, move this thing!
I'll get you for this.

828
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:10,466
You son of a bitch!
You'll pay for this.

829
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,560
You're in trouble, Sheriff!
You're in big trouble!

830
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,846
So long, partner.

831
00:44:43,664 --> 00:44:47,419
Boy, you sent him hightailin'.
I was so proud of you!

832
00:44:47,502 --> 00:44:48,628
Didn't I?
- Yeah.

833
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:55,681
Look at them stars.

834
00:44:57,762 --> 00:45:00,015
Well, there ain't nothin'
prettier than a Texas sky.

835
00:45:00,807 --> 00:45:02,024
Ain't that the truth.

836
00:45:05,144 --> 00:45:06,646
Hey, look! Did you
see that shootin' star?

837
00:45:08,689 --> 00:45:11,112
That could've been a spaceship, you know.
- Yeah.

838
00:45:11,192 --> 00:45:12,232
You believe in spaceships?

839
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,368
Sure.

840
00:45:13,986 --> 00:45:15,784
I saw a picture once.

841
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:17,991
Them fellers that's supposed
to be from up there.

842
00:45:18,074 --> 00:45:19,496
Fly around.

843
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:22,750
Tiny little fellers, bald-headed.

844
00:45:22,995 --> 00:45:25,248
Little feet,
little hands, got no peckers.

845
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:27,754
Got no peckers?

846
00:45:29,168 --> 00:45:32,092
Well, I ain't interested.

847
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,553
I don't think my girls would be either.

848
00:45:36,551 --> 00:45:39,976
When I was a little kid,
I used to imagine a flyin' saucer

849
00:45:40,054 --> 00:45:43,558
swoopin' down and pickin' me up
and takin' me off to heaven.

850
00:45:43,724 --> 00:45:45,351
Like the angels.

851
00:45:46,894 --> 00:45:50,023
"I looked, and behold,
a whirlwind comin' out of the north.

852
00:45:50,106 --> 00:45:51,574
"And out of the midst
of the fire came
the
853
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,276
"likeness of four living creatures."

854
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:56,182
What the hell you talkin' about?

855
00:45:56,237 --> 00:45:57,409
Well, that's from the Bible.

856
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,707
That's what the Bible says
about spaceships in Ezekiel.

857
00:45:59,782 --> 00:46:01,159
Don't you know nothin' about the Bible?

858
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:02,664
Yeah, I know about the Bible!

859
00:46:02,743 --> 00:46:04,943
I just don't know nothin'
about no Ezekiel in the Bible.

860
00:46:05,538 --> 00:46:08,917
I knew Ezekiel Peebles
once in the eighth grade.

861
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,344
Think I busted his jaw.

862
00:46:13,629 --> 00:46:15,472
Well, that was very Christian of you.

863
00:46:15,548 --> 00:46:17,971
Well, most of my family was Baptist.

864
00:46:19,093 --> 00:46:21,437
Well, I never stayed
with one family long enough

865
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,001
to become anything in particular.

866
00:46:23,472 --> 00:46:25,941
But I read the Bible.
I believe in Jesus.

867
00:46:26,726 --> 00:46:28,478
I think Jesus was...

868
00:46:28,895 --> 00:46:30,647
Was a real good man.

869
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:32,569
And he was a heck of a speaker.

870
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:36,946
Yep. I knew a woman once
that had a vision of Jesus.

871
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:40,578
He came right in her house, set
right down at the foot of her bed.

872
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:44,209
I don't know what I'd do
if that happened to me.

873
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:46,041
I'll tell you something, honey.

874
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,873
If Jesus comes to your house,
all hell's gonna break loose.

875
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:53,711
You got a point there, Ed Earl.

876
00:46:54,003 --> 00:46:55,300
But you know, Jesus was really good

877
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,131
to Mary Magdalene, the fallen woman.

878
00:46:57,632 --> 00:46:59,600
He was always bein' very sociable.

879
00:47:00,134 --> 00:47:03,855
He went to this big weddin'
once and they ran out of wine.

880
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,182
You know what he did?
Turned the water into wine.

881
00:47:07,183 --> 00:47:09,811
Well, that's a man that knows
how to throw a party.

882
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:12,439
Now, don't be sacrilegious.

883
00:47:12,772 --> 00:47:16,026
I'm not. I'm not. He forgives me.

884
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:18,653
He knows I was kiddin'.

885
00:47:18,778 --> 00:47:20,246
Yeah, I know he forgives you.

886
00:47:20,321 --> 00:47:22,915
That's funny, now,
how God can forgive you,

887
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,788
and people can't. Now why is that?

888
00:47:25,493 --> 00:47:29,714
Well, because people are not
very God-like, Mona.

889
00:47:30,623 --> 00:47:31,840
I know.

890
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,967
I know.

891
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:36,337
Yeah.

892
00:47:51,018 --> 00:47:52,395
What is it?

893
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,031
Melvin P. Thorpe

894
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:58,868
is a sorry son of a bitch.

895
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,540
You reckon he's gonna
run for the legislature?

896
00:48:08,077 --> 00:48:09,169
Why?

897
00:48:12,206 --> 00:48:14,709
I never told anybody this, Mona, but...

898
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:19,498
I was thinkin' of runnin'
for the legislature someday.

899
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,342
Are you serious, Ed Earl?

900
00:48:22,425 --> 00:48:23,551
Yeah.

901
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,855
They say an honest man can't be
elected in this country anymore.

902
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,641
But I don't believe that.

903
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:33,269
This is a good country.

904
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,397
I believe I could win.

905
00:48:36,564 --> 00:48:39,443
Well, you got my vote.
I might even go register.

906
00:48:40,443 --> 00:48:42,696
Boy, I sure didn't know
you had dreams that big.

907
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:45,497
People really do like you, though.

908
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:46,699
They like you, too.

909
00:48:46,782 --> 00:48:47,908
Really?
- Sure.

910
00:48:48,743 --> 00:48:50,711
You ask anybody in town about you.

911
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,338
Say, "How do you like Miss Mona?"

912
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:57,089
They say, "Shoot, she's a fine woman.
Fine, friendly and nice."

913
00:48:58,586 --> 00:49:01,965
Well, I always just thought if you
see somebody without a smile,

914
00:49:02,298 --> 00:49:03,766
you give 'em yours.

915
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:05,263
I like that.

916
00:49:06,427 --> 00:49:07,804
I like that.

917
00:49:08,888 --> 00:49:10,936
Think I'll use that
as my campaign slogan.

918
00:49:12,266 --> 00:49:15,270
If you see somebody without
a smile, give 'em yours.

919
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,650
I'm gonna have that
printed up on a little card.

920
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:20,942
You're kiddin' me. You smart-ass.

921
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:23,327
I had a dream once.

922
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:25,237
Yeah?

923
00:49:25,446 --> 00:49:26,914
I'll tell you if you won't laugh.

924
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:28,662
I won't laugh.

925
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:31,290
Well, I used to dream
of bein' a ballerina.

926
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,878
Now, Ed Earl,
I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

927
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:38,959
A ballerina?

928
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,170
Yes, a ballerina!

929
00:49:41,295 --> 00:49:45,516
Well, I think that's wonderful.

930
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,280
And I think you still could be
a ballerina if you wanted to be.

931
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:50,388
No, you could! Don't be ridiculous!

932
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:53,520
Go into training right now.
Just start jumpin' up and down.

933
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,818
Me? Jumpin' up and down?
I'd black both my eyes.

934
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,856
I couldn't be a ballerina now.
I'm too top-heavy.

935
00:49:59,939 --> 00:50:01,539
I have a hard enough
time balancin' these

936
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,533
things now, without gettin' on my toes.

937
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:13,286
You know something?

938
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:14,541
What?

939
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:18,007
You know that, I don't
see anybody but you anymore.

940
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:21,427
Course, now, you can't
say the same, can you?

941
00:50:25,673 --> 00:50:29,177
I haven't been to bed with another
woman besides you in three years.

942
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:32,179
You didn't know that, did you?

943
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,687
No, I didn't know that.

944
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,687
Nothin' better,
once you've had the best.

945
00:50:41,188 --> 00:50:42,610
Hey, I like that.

946
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:43,862
I thought you would.

947
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:45,488
Reckon if I was to
run for the legislature,

948
00:50:45,568 --> 00:50:48,287
I could, put that on my card?

949
00:51:04,253 --> 00:51:08,599
Up next, Melvin P. Thorpe continues
his expose of the Chicken Ranch

950
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:12,019
<i>with a violent demonstration
in the Gilbert town square.

951
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,305
Great God from Goldsboro!

952
00:51:22,605 --> 00:51:23,697
Yeah?

953
00:51:23,772 --> 00:51:26,400
Ed Earl, you better turn on Channel 4.

954
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:29,490
<i>That Melvin P. Thorpe idiot's
got you on TV again.

955
00:51:30,112 --> 00:51:32,331
Well, I don't give a shit, Rufus!

956
00:51:32,406 --> 00:51:34,909
<i>It's all very well to
take that attitude, Ed Earl,

957
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,072
<i>but this is serious!</i>
Honey.

958
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,664
Put on the television. Channel 4.

959
00:51:40,915 --> 00:51:43,885
That Melvin P. Thorpe is
shootin' off his mouth again.

960
00:51:43,959 --> 00:51:47,259
How could what he's sayin'
be so goddamn important?

961
00:51:47,379 --> 00:51:51,100
Calm down, Rufus! It can't
be as bad as all that.

962
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:55,729
What happened to me as an
individual is not important.

963
00:51:56,305 --> 00:51:59,275
Is this the kind of man we want
runnin' our law enforcement?

964
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:01,727
<i>Is this the kind of
foul-mouthed example

965
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,438
we wanna set for our young,
innocent children?

966
00:52:05,648 --> 00:52:06,945
Run the film.

967
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:10,198
Number three. No sawed-off little ...

968
00:52:10,277 --> 00:52:12,826
is gonna accuse me of takin'
a bribe and live to tell about it

969
00:52:12,905 --> 00:52:14,999
because I wear the badge
in this ... county!

970
00:52:15,074 --> 00:52:18,749
So you listen and you listen good! You ...!

971
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:20,579
If I ever see you or any of those ...

972
00:52:20,663 --> 00:52:22,165
that work for you in my town again,

973
00:52:22,248 --> 00:52:25,047
I'm gonna knock you so flat
you're gonna ...!

974
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:34,635
Ed Earl, that man has
made a fool out of you.

975
00:52:38,806 --> 00:52:40,649
I've had calls from four preachers,

976
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,022
six deacons, and the presidents
of two garden clubs!

977
00:52:43,102 --> 00:52:44,274
Thank you for callin'.

978
00:52:44,353 --> 00:52:45,650
The phones have been ringin' like that

979
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,152
all mornin' long. Sheriff's office.

980
00:52:48,232 --> 00:52:50,655
I don't know why I let people
talk me into serving as mayor

981
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,078
of this incorporated sand trap anyway!

982
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:54,809
What in the heck is keepin' him?

983
00:52:54,863 --> 00:52:55,910
He'll be along.

984
00:52:56,782 --> 00:52:58,534
Well, he'd better!

985
00:52:58,617 --> 00:53:00,870
My wife couldn't believe
what she saw last night.

986
00:53:00,953 --> 00:53:03,081
They bleeped him out,
but she read his lips

987
00:53:03,163 --> 00:53:05,006
on every "hell," "goddamn," and "shit."

988
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:11,639
There's some folks gettin' up
a petition to close the Chicken Ranch.

989
00:53:12,006 --> 00:53:14,680
All we wanted to do was keep it quiet.

990
00:53:14,842 --> 00:53:17,061
Now, thanks to Ed Earl,
it's the hottest thing

991
00:53:17,136 --> 00:53:19,104
on the air since The Gong Show.

992
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:21,482
I'll tell him you called.
Bye. Mornin', Sheriff.

993
00:53:21,557 --> 00:53:23,355
Mornin', Rita.
- Here's your calls.

994
00:53:23,726 --> 00:53:25,319
Reckon you fellas are
waitin' to talk to me.

995
00:53:25,394 --> 00:53:26,395
We sure are!

996
00:53:26,478 --> 00:53:27,946
You don't know the trouble you caused

997
00:53:28,022 --> 00:53:29,069
on this Chicken Ranch business!

998
00:53:29,148 --> 00:53:32,448
Dad-gum it, Ed Earl! If you
ain't a pluperfect fool!

999
00:53:32,693 --> 00:53:34,946
You may be right. I got over a dozen

1000
00:53:35,029 --> 00:53:36,702
messages here from outraged citizens,

1001
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,329
tellin' me that we got
a whorehouse in Lanville County.

1002
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,953
Only been one here for about 150 years.

1003
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:45,040
Ed Earl, now, you can set up speed
traps to catch the tourists.

1004
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:48,631
You can look the other way when
the wrong kid swipes a car to go joyriding.

1005
00:53:49,335 --> 00:53:51,508
Hell, you can even let Miss
Mona run her place out there!

1006
00:53:51,587 --> 00:53:55,433
But there's one thing you can't do and
that's broadcast gutter talk on TV.

1007
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:57,306
I didn't know they was takin' pictures.

1008
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:59,812
What did you figure
the cameras were for?

1009
00:54:00,054 --> 00:54:03,308
Damn it, C.J.! You pious pissant.

1010
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:06,944
I don't have one-tenth the trouble
from Miss Mona's that I have from you

1011
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:10,398
for one of your all-night stag parties
over at the Legionnaire Hall.

1012
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:12,366
That ain't fair, dang it!

1013
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:13,488
There's just one thing to do.

1014
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:14,989
And that's close the place down before

1015
00:54:15,069 --> 00:54:16,321
we all go to hell in a hand basket.

1016
00:54:16,403 --> 00:54:20,124
Close it down! She was just fine as
long as she was bringin' in the money

1017
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:21,542
and makin' civic contributions,

1018
00:54:21,617 --> 00:54:24,461
but the moment her luck ran sour,
you want to run out on her.

1019
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:27,631
Run out on her like
rats from a burnin' barn!

1020
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:31,753
That's just it, Ed Earl.
Who's gonna put out that fire?

1021
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:33,470
Look, if you won't
close her down, at least

1022
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:35,225
tell her to lay low
for a couple of months!

1023
00:54:35,297 --> 00:54:38,221
Yeah, just until the heat
wears off a little bit.

1024
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,223
Give it two months. What's two months?

1025
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:43,848
Nobody tells me how
to run my goddam job,

1026
00:54:43,931 --> 00:54:45,729
and nobody gives me advice!

1027
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:50,571
I'll do things my own way. I'm
gonna make up my own damn mind!

1028
00:54:51,563 --> 00:54:53,486
Two months. What's two months?

1029
00:54:53,565 --> 00:54:55,818
Shut down for two months!

1030
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,660
That is a hell of a lot
to ask somebody, Ed Earl.

1031
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:01,369
And that's a hell of a lot of overhead

1032
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:03,701
to pay out when cash ain't comin' in.

1033
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:05,874
What d'you think
I ought to tell my girls?

1034
00:55:05,953 --> 00:55:07,671
Well, maybe it won't be two months.

1035
00:55:07,746 --> 00:55:09,214
The holidays are comin' up.

1036
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:11,132
Maybe in a couple of weeks
the whole thing will blow over

1037
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:12,505
and then you can let
your regular customers...

1038
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:16,805
I warned you yesterday about losin'
your temper and carryin' on.

1039
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,845
Last night you said
you was proud of me.

1040
00:55:19,007 --> 00:55:21,977
Last night I wasn't on the 11:00 news!

1041
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:25,685
Well, I didn't know that son of a bitch
was gonna make an idiot out of me.

1042
00:55:25,848 --> 00:55:27,942
I don't know anything about
that electronic bullshit!

1043
00:55:28,016 --> 00:55:29,859
How was I supposed to
handle that situation?

1044
00:55:30,352 --> 00:55:33,902
That's your job, Ed Earl. Ain't
that what they pay you for?

1045
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,443
I know what my job is! Don't be
tellin' me what my goddamn job is!

1046
00:55:37,526 --> 00:55:39,995
I could close this place down
in a New York minute!

1047
00:55:40,612 --> 00:55:43,240
All I'm askin' for is for you
to give me a little cooperation

1048
00:55:43,323 --> 00:55:45,325
so I can get through
a difficult situation

1049
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:47,244
with as little trouble as possible!

1050
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:50,456
Okay, okay, okay! I'll shut it down.

1051
00:55:50,706 --> 00:55:51,707
You will?

1052
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:54,172
What do you want, a written contract?

1053
00:55:54,877 --> 00:55:55,969
You promise?

1054
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:58,839
Ed Earl, I am givin' you my word.

1055
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:06,017
I'm sorry, Mona,
about the whole situation.

1056
00:56:06,889 --> 00:56:08,857
Don't feel sorry for me.

1057
00:56:09,725 --> 00:56:13,775
I started out poor, and
I worked my way up to outcast.

1058
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:18,609
I know what I'm
askin' you to do is gonna

1059
00:56:18,692 --> 00:56:20,452
turn out to be
the best thing for both of us.

1060
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:22,571
Just trust me.

1061
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:28,410
You know what burns my ass?

1062
00:56:28,494 --> 00:56:29,620
What?

1063
00:56:29,703 --> 00:56:32,081
A flame about three feet high.

1064
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:36,628
Of course I trust you, you big cowboy.
Ain't I always?

1065
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:40,047
No need to stop now.

1066
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,850
Now get out of here.

1067
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:45,891
Everything's gonna turn out just fine.

1068
00:56:46,178 --> 00:56:48,180
Don't you worry about a thing, honey.

1069
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:51,100
Everything's gonna turn out
slicker than cat shit

1070
00:56:51,225 --> 00:56:53,023
on a linoleum floor.

1071
00:56:58,941 --> 00:57:00,659
Well, if it ain't the celebrated

1072
00:57:00,734 --> 00:57:02,657
cussin' sheriff of Lanville County.

1073
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,325
How are you, Sheriff?

1074
00:57:04,404 --> 00:57:06,122
I'm fine. How are you, Porky?

1075
00:57:06,198 --> 00:57:10,169
Sheriff! I been real good all week.
I've lost six pounds.

1076
00:57:10,244 --> 00:57:13,874
Yeah? Well, don't take
nothin' off them cheeks.

1077
00:57:13,956 --> 00:57:15,299
Go on.

1078
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:22,514
Well, Jewel,
I just promised the sheriff

1079
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:24,387
that we're gonna shut
down for two months.

1080
00:57:25,217 --> 00:57:27,345
What? How can you promise that?

1081
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:30,264
What about the football game
celebration tomorrow night?

1082
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:33,646
I forgot all about that.

1083
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:36,987
It's the Thanksgiving game, Miss Mona.
And that's real special.

1084
00:57:37,104 --> 00:57:38,344
Well I know it's special, Jewel!

1085
00:57:38,397 --> 00:57:39,523
But I don't know what to do now.

1086
00:57:39,606 --> 00:57:41,108
I did promise.

1087
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,068
You think if we just close
the doors to the regular customers,

1088
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:45,700
just went on with the party as
planned, that'd be all right?

1089
00:57:45,946 --> 00:57:50,122
I'm sure it will, honey. That party
is a bigger tradition than the game.

1090
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:01,379
65,000-plus on hand here at Kyle Field,

1091
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:03,964
and we have seen an amazing ball game.

1092
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:07,719
Texas A&M heavily favored,
but we're tied 12-12.

1093
00:58:07,801 --> 00:58:09,644
<i>Aggies have the ball,

pictures, invadin' my privacy,

1254
01:15:51,155 --> 01:15:53,533
and you wanna know what
the law's gonna do about that?

1255
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:54,868
I can tell you. Nothin'!

1256
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:56,669
They'd have no reason to do nothin'

1257
01:15:56,744 --> 01:15:58,291
if you'd done what you
said you were gonna do!

1258
01:15:58,371 --> 01:16:00,669
I trusted you. That's what hurt.
I trusted you!

1259
01:16:00,748 --> 01:16:04,798
Don't you talk to me about trust!
I trusted you to protect me!

1260
01:16:04,877 --> 01:16:07,596
I made a mistake tonight, okay?

1261
01:16:08,005 --> 01:16:11,384
If that's your idea of an apology,
it ain't worth armadillo crap.

1262
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:12,889
Well, I ain't apologizin'!

1263
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:15,313
I'm a business woman
payin' out double taxes!

1264
01:16:15,388 --> 01:16:18,062
I expect a little
protection for my money!

1265
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,268
Where were you tonight?
I couldn't get you on the phone...

1266
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,024
I was home in bed, because you gave me

1267
01:16:22,103 --> 01:16:23,605
your word you were closin' down.

1268
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:25,652
Well, if Sheriff Jack
Roy Wallace was here,

1269
01:16:25,731 --> 01:16:27,011
none of this would have happened.

1270
01:16:27,066 --> 01:16:28,568
Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace couldn't

1271
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:30,449
hold my jock!
- You can't handle the job!

1272
01:16:30,528 --> 01:16:33,122
God damn it, Mona,
you're makin' me mad!

1273
01:16:33,197 --> 01:16:37,748
Listen at him cuss and shout.
Just like on TV!

1274
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:40,629
You're just a kid
playin' at bein' a cowboy.

1275
01:16:40,705 --> 01:16:42,924
You ain't never gonna grow up!

1276
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,259
You use me as your mistress.

1277
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,383
You use that damn Dulcie Mae
as your in-town wife.

1278
01:16:48,462 --> 01:16:50,885
And you even use
that little boy of hers

1279
01:16:50,965 --> 01:16:52,842
so you can play weekend daddy!

1280
01:16:52,925 --> 01:16:54,017
Leave that boy out of it!

1281
01:16:54,093 --> 01:16:55,390
You're playin', Ed Earl.

1282
01:16:55,469 --> 01:16:58,723
You're just a big, overgrown
kid playin' at bein' a man!

1283
01:16:59,098 --> 01:17:03,103
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Damn it! I'm the law.

1284
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:06,485
If I choose to, I'll close this
place down till hell freezes over.

1285
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:10,697
Don't you threaten me.
I'm tellin' the truth, and you know it!

1286
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:14,865
And all of your big dreams of
goin' to the legislature.

1287
01:17:15,448 --> 01:17:17,246
That's all they are.
They're just dreams,

1288
01:17:17,658 --> 01:17:20,537
'cause you ain't never gonna be
no more than you are right now.

1289
01:17:20,619 --> 01:17:23,623
A chicken-shit sheriff
in a chicken-shit town.

1290
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:28,177
You may be right.

1291
01:17:28,252 --> 01:17:30,092
It's a hell of a lot better
than bein' a whore.

1292
01:18:33,526 --> 01:18:37,201
Legalized prostitution, pro or con,
is in the news today.

1293
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:41,079
For a report, here is Jeff
Gerald in Gilbert, Texas.

1294
01:18:42,368 --> 01:18:45,212
The Chicken Ranch, the legendary,
long-running bawdy house,

1295
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,790
is showing little activity
after the disclosure yesterday

1296
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:49,250
of the Thanksgiving night raid.

1297
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:50,709
Get away!

1298
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:52,136
<i>The deputy at the front
gate keeps away onlookers

1299
01:18:52,211 --> 01:18:53,212
<i>and potential customers,

1300
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:55,142
<i>while up at the house,
the doors are closed

1301
01:18:55,172 --> 01:18:56,765
<i>and the principals are not talking.

1302
01:18:58,175 --> 01:19:00,849
<i>The sheriff of Gilbert, Ed
Earl Dodd, refused interviews,

1303
01:19:00,928 --> 01:19:03,147
<i>while in Houston, the man
who launched the campaign,

1304
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:05,065
<i>consumer advocate Melvin P. Thorpe,

1305
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:06,661
<i>held a press conference this afternoon.

1306
01:19:07,059 --> 01:19:09,482
I have a report here that
says that the Chicken Ranch

1307
01:19:09,562 --> 01:19:13,612
is involved with and under
the influence of organized crime.

1308
01:19:13,899 --> 01:19:16,948
I myself am gonna take
this report to Austin

1309
01:19:17,027 --> 01:19:18,745
in the hopes that the Governor himself

1310
01:19:18,946 --> 01:19:20,698
will come out of his long silence

1311
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:23,292
on this issue and uphold the law.

1312
01:19:24,451 --> 01:19:26,169
And... Thank you. Thank you very much.

1313
01:19:27,037 --> 01:19:29,005
<i>At the capitol today,
the Governor made no statement,

1314
01:19:29,081 --> 01:19:30,628
<i>but Senator Charles Wingwood,

1315
01:19:30,749 --> 01:19:32,829
<i>who was a principal figure
in the Watchdog news raid,

1316
01:19:33,043 --> 01:19:35,421
<i>also held a press conference
explaining his involvement.

1317
01:19:35,921 --> 01:19:39,516
I have no independent recollection
of going to the Chicken Ranch.

1318
01:19:39,592 --> 01:19:42,015
And I can only say,
as the most dedicated

1319
01:19:42,094 --> 01:19:44,472
anticommunist in the state legislature,

1320
01:19:44,555 --> 01:19:46,102
that I must have been drugged

1321
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:48,526
by communists or communist sympathizers

1322
01:19:48,601 --> 01:19:52,447
and placed there to harm
my reputation and good name.

1323
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:55,111
Reaction across
the state is split 50-50.

1324
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:56,363
But here in the town of Gilbert,

1325
01:19:56,442 --> 01:19:58,115
the Chicken Ranch has many supporters.

1326
01:19:58,611 --> 01:20:01,114
I ain't never seen anything
bad come out of there yet,

1327
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:02,949
and I've lived here all my life.

1328
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:06,377
Why, they attract a lot of
business to the community.

1329
01:20:06,452 --> 01:20:09,331
They pay their taxes.
Just like you and me!

1330
01:20:09,914 --> 01:20:13,293
No one. No one was ever
forced to go up there.

1331
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:17,005
My Frank, when he was alive, used
to go up there every Saturday.

1332
01:20:17,087 --> 01:20:21,058
I took it as a blessin'. Of course,
things were different then.

1333
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:25,058
Nowadays women enjoy doin'
that sort of thing themselves.

1334
01:20:25,638 --> 01:20:27,766
At least, so I've been told.

1335
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:31,061
The Chicken Ranch?
I think it's a good idea.

1336
01:20:31,143 --> 01:20:32,440
See, you take a lot of young boys

1337
01:20:32,519 --> 01:20:34,362
and they're gonna be out
there lookin' for women.

1338
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:36,315
If they can't find 'em,
they'll rape 'em.

1339
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:39,778
And if they don't do that, they'll
run to other women and get diseases!

1340
01:20:40,152 --> 01:20:41,745
Those girls went to doctors.

1341
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:45,165
Although petitions are being
circulated to save the Chicken Ranch,

1342
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:48,085
already this bumper sticker is
beginning to appear around the state.

1343
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:51,005
<i>And so, as feminists
line up behind the bill

1344
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,753
<i>for the decriminalization
of prostitution

1345
01:20:52,831 --> 01:20:56,085
<i>already in the legislature, while
traditionalists and fundamentalists

1346
01:20:56,168 --> 01:20:58,512
<i>lobby for its defeat,
the fate of the Chicken Ranch

1347
01:20:58,587 --> 01:20:59,713
<i>rests with the Governor,

1348
01:20:59,797 --> 01:21:01,265
<i>who today, again,
was unavailable for comment.

1349
01:21:02,675 --> 01:21:04,677
<i>Jeff Gerald, ABC News, Gilbert, Texas.

1350
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:07,012
<i>Thank you, Jeff.
If there are further developements...

1351
01:21:09,056 --> 01:21:11,150
Well, I hate admitting
I was wrong, Miss Mona.

1352
01:21:11,642 --> 01:21:14,395
But with television broadcasting
this from hell to breakfast,

1353
01:21:14,687 --> 01:21:17,861
we should've done what the sheriff
said and kept this place closed.

1354
01:21:18,857 --> 01:21:22,327
It was my fault, Jewel.
It was my decision.

1355
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,446
He ain't gonna be able to
stop it this time, is he?

1356
01:21:25,406 --> 01:21:29,036
No. He'd like to,
but he's out of his league.

1357
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:30,586
He don't know how to fight 'em.

1358
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:34,874
He's just a good old boy that
ain't never gonna grow up.

1359
01:21:35,582 --> 01:21:37,710
Honey, we see
everything in this profession.

1360
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:41,848
But one thing I ain't never seen,
man nor woman, is a grown-up.

1361
01:21:41,922 --> 01:21:45,017
Don't be too hard on him. He loves you.

1362
01:21:48,887 --> 01:21:50,560
Well, he ain't never said it.

1363
01:21:52,099 --> 01:21:54,318
Some men can't say the words, honey.

1364
01:21:55,144 --> 01:21:57,272
But that don't mean they
don't feel it in their heart.

1365
01:21:59,106 --> 01:22:01,780
Well, it's just as well anyhow, Jewel.

1366
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:05,078
I set my course a long time ago

1367
01:22:05,904 --> 01:22:08,077
and I can't go changin' now.

1368
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:14,769
Well, I don't know what to do.

1369
01:22:14,955 --> 01:22:18,425
Seems like folks got nothin' else to
talk about but this Chicken Ranch mess.

1370
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:21,504
Like a broken record. Chicken Ranch!

1371
01:22:21,587 --> 01:22:25,182
And all of this bad publicity's
flat ruinin' business.

1372
01:22:25,257 --> 01:22:26,457
I haven't sold a car in a week.

1373
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,385
It's ruinin' the town.

1374
01:22:28,802 --> 01:22:31,976
No one's blamin' you, Ed Earl.
It ain't your fault.

1375
01:22:32,139 --> 01:22:34,517
But we can't just sit around
here waitin' to grow tits!

1376
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:38,195
Now, now, the way I see it,
the Chicken Ranch served a purpose once.

1377
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:40,272
But now everything's openin' up.

1378
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:44,114
Do you know we are in the middle
of a worldwide sexual revolution?

1379
01:22:44,234 --> 01:22:47,238
Why, Miss Mona's ain't obscene.
It's just obsolete.

1380
01:22:47,321 --> 01:22:50,541
She ain't got a handful
of supporters left, Ed Earl.

1381
01:22:50,616 --> 01:22:53,119
All this publicity's
makin' folks think twice

1382
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:55,580
about signin' that
petition to keep her open!

1383
01:22:55,788 --> 01:22:58,041
Why the hell can't
that station in Houston

1384
01:22:58,123 --> 01:23:00,717
turn its cameras to
the cesspool in their own backyard?

1385
01:23:00,793 --> 01:23:03,797
And how about Austin? Why, two
blocks from the state capitol,

1386
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:04,971
you can have anything done to you

1387
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:07,300
for money that you can get in Tangier!

1388
01:23:07,508 --> 01:23:09,886
Well, there's naked massages,
there's tongue baths,

1389
01:23:09,968 --> 01:23:12,562
there's somebody ticklin'
your ass with a feather.

1390
01:23:12,638 --> 01:23:16,688
If you know that for a fact,
Mr. Newspaper Editor,

1391
01:23:16,767 --> 01:23:18,690
it's your duty to expose it!

1392
01:23:18,769 --> 01:23:20,237
Well, now, you see here, C.J.!

1393
01:23:20,312 --> 01:23:21,404
I don't give a damn

1394
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,903
if folks want their ass
tickled with a feather!

1395
01:23:23,982 --> 01:23:26,906
I kind of like to think that
that's what heaven is all about.

1396
01:23:29,947 --> 01:23:32,996
Boys, I got myself a pretty
good bullshit detector.

1397
01:23:33,992 --> 01:23:36,040
And I can tell when
somebody's peein' on my boots

1398
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,713
and tellin' me it's a rainstorm.

1399
01:23:38,705 --> 01:23:41,925
Now, this thing's gotten way out of hand.
I don't know how.

1400
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,424
But I figure there's
only one thing left to do.

1401
01:23:44,711 --> 01:23:46,008
Close it down!

1402
01:23:46,505 --> 01:23:49,179
No. I'm goin' to Austin.

1403
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:53,683
See the Governor, tell him Miss
Mona's side of the situation.

1404
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,149
He sure as hell ain't gonna hear
about it from anybody in this room.

1405
01:23:57,224 --> 01:23:58,976
You can't go up and see the Governor!

1406
01:23:59,059 --> 01:24:00,857
He don't see anybody!

1407
01:24:01,019 --> 01:24:02,487
He'll see me.

1408
01:24:15,742 --> 01:24:17,710
Feel like the country dog in the city.

If I stand still, they screw me.

there was somethin' I could do.

Thank you.

1414
01:24:32,718 --> 01:24:34,265

1415

line comin' up here like this,

01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:23,827

The Chicken Ranch has been in

1520
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:50,517
I've known Miss Mona for 12 years.

She never refuses a charity.
The whole town likes her.

have to play in their overalls.

Well.

1526
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:09,706
I wasn't aware of her civic generosity.

1527

Sometimes it's gotta be changed.

1529
01:31:14,786 --> 01:31:16,288
I been fightin' crime all my life,

1530
01:31:16,371 --> 01:31:18,465
but let's not confuse crime
with committin' a sin.

1531
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:20,463
You can't legislate morality.

1532
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:23,091
Those girls out there have never
caused any trouble to anybody.

1533
01:31:23,169 --> 01:31:26,264
They're healthy, taxpayin',
law-abidin' citizens

01:31:27,841 --> 01:31:29,343
an economic asset to the community.

1536
01:31:30,343 --> 01:31:32,766
Ed Earl.

1537
01:31:33,555 --> 01:31:38,026
You ever think about runnin' for office?
I swear.

1538
01:31:38,143 --> 01:31:40,145
You make that whorehouse sound like

1539
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:41,730
a damn nonprofit recreational facility.

1540
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:45,943
Governor, if the citizens who elected me

1541
01:31:46,026 --> 01:31:48,074
found it necessary
for me to close it down,

1542
01:31:48,153 --> 01:31:49,826
I would close it down.

1543
01:31:49,905 --> 01:31:54,251
If Miss Mona and the girls that work
for her were jeopardizin' the health,

1544
01:31:54,326 --> 01:31:57,580
wealth or moral scruples of
the community, I would close it down.

1545
01:31:57,996 --> 01:31:59,998
If the place was just
a piddlin' nuisance,

1546
01:32:00,332 --> 01:32:03,427
an eyesore, a fire hazard,
I would close it down!

1547
01:32:03,501 --> 01:32:04,501
But there's nothin'.

1548
01:32:04,544 --> 01:32:07,297
No reason except the goddam cries

1549
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,133
of a muckrakin'
sensationalist on television.

1550
01:32:10,926 --> 01:32:13,179
Here they are, Governor.
What you've been waitin' for.

1551
01:32:16,348 --> 01:32:18,316
Aha. I'm sorry, Ed Earl.

1552
01:32:18,391 --> 01:32:21,895
But the Chicken Ranch loses,
42 to 37, with 21% undecided.

1553
01:32:22,312 --> 01:32:23,438
What is that?

1554
01:32:23,521 --> 01:32:25,944
The polls. You can't expect

But it's not what my people want.

Hello?

1583
01:34:53,171 --> 01:34:55,048
Mona, this is an official call.

1584
01:34:56,341 --> 01:34:58,014
As the Sheriff of Lanville County,

1585
01:34:58,093 --> 01:34:59,265
it's my duty to tell you that...

1586
01:34:59,344 --> 01:35:01,847
Why don't you just get
to the point, Sheriff?

1587
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,983
I gotta close you down.

About the other night.

01:35:24,869 --> 01:35:26,542
I lost my temper.

1595
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:30,338
I said some things
I shouldn't have said.

1596
01:35:32,418 --> 01:35:34,216
I want to apologize.

1597
01:35:35,088 --> 01:35:36,965
It's all right, Ed Earl.

1598
01:35:37,048 --> 01:35:40,518

1603
01:36:25,638 --> 01:36:27,185

Well, Las Vegas, here I come.

1610

1612

It's kinda like the end of an era.

You know, like when you

Things are just never the same again.

01:41:37,116 --> 01:41:39,869
Ed Earl's up in

1670
01:41:40,578 --> 01:41:42,580
and I became the Sheriff.

1671
01:41:50,004 --> 01:41:52,124
I suppose you're wonderin'
what happened to Miss Mona.

1672
01:41:52,507 --> 01:41:55,807
Well, Ed Earl drove up
there on her last day.

1673
01:42:12,151 --> 01:42:13,528
Hey, Sheriff.

1674
01:42:13,611 --> 01:42:14,783
Good morning, Jewel.

1675
01:42:14,862 --> 01:42:18,457
I'm so pleased to see ya.
I knew you couldn't let me leave

1676
01:42:18,533 --> 01:42:21,161
without a sweet
goodbye for your old Porky.

1677
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,297
Goodbye, Jewel.

1678
01:42:25,373 --> 01:42:26,465
Goodbye, Sheriff.

1679
01:42:26,541 --> 01:42:29,044
I sure hope you come up north
to visit Miss Mona and me.

1680
01:42:29,794 --> 01:42:31,046
Where is she?

1681
01:42:31,128 --> 01:42:32,345
Inside.

1682
01:42:34,215 --> 01:42:35,842
See you're takin'
the old juke with you.

1683
01:42:36,008 --> 01:42:40,058
You know I couldn't
leave without my bell and my box.

1684
01:43:24,348 --> 01:43:25,600
Ed Earl?

1685
01:43:28,853 --> 01:43:30,651
This old place looks
kinda funny, don't it?

1686
01:43:31,897 --> 01:43:34,446
Ben Sawtuck bought all
my furniture and fixtures

1687
01:43:34,525 --> 01:43:36,994
and Langston downtown
is gonna sell the rest.

1688
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:43,758
Mona, there's
something I wanna tell you.

1689
01:43:44,035 --> 01:43:45,708
I want you to thank your boys for me.

1690
01:43:46,037 --> 01:43:47,380
Those sightseers and
reporters would have

1691
01:43:47,455 --> 01:43:48,752
got all out of hand if it hadn't been

1692
01:43:48,831 --> 01:43:50,458
for your deputies down at the gate.

1693
01:43:52,752 --> 01:43:54,174
Mona, you know me better than that.

1694
01:43:54,253 --> 01:43:56,013
Ed Earl, I believe
the thing for you to do is

1695
01:43:56,047 --> 01:43:57,765
just to put this whole thing behind you

1696
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,842
just as quick as you can.

1697
01:43:59,925 --> 01:44:03,304
I've made a little money, I've laughed
some, I've danced to the music.

1698
01:44:03,387 --> 01:44:05,481
It's just time to pay
the fiddler, that's all.

1699
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:10,687
Mona, we've been together a long time.

1700
01:44:12,229 --> 01:44:14,527
Sometimes I think you know me
better than I know myself.

1701
01:44:17,193 --> 01:44:18,991
So you know how hard
this is for me to say.

1702
01:44:21,572 --> 01:44:22,915
I love you.

1703
01:44:25,743 --> 01:44:27,416
Will you marry me?

1704
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:31,503
Ed Earl, I've loved you
since I was 16-years-old.

1705
01:44:32,041 --> 01:44:34,590
But I've thought about
this for a long time.

1706
01:44:35,002 --> 01:44:36,720
And as much as I'd love for it to work,

1707
01:44:37,463 --> 01:44:40,262
I know deep down in my heart
it ain't never gonna be.

1708
01:44:40,966 --> 01:44:42,684
Didn't you hear what I said?

1709
01:44:42,927 --> 01:44:44,019
I did, darlin'.

1710
01:44:44,095 --> 01:44:46,598
But it's gonna
