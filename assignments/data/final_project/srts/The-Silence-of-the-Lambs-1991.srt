1
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:38,570
WOODS NEAR QUANTICO, VA

2
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,208
Starling!

3
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:52,836
Starling!

4
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,842
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

5
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,009
Thank you, sir.

6
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:49,387
- Clarice.
- Hey.

7
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:44,692
You looking for Crawford? He should
be back in a minute. Wait in his office.

8
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,705
Starling.

9
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,254
- Clarice M. Good morning.
- Morning, Mr Crawford.

10
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:50,764
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice.

11
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:54,102
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.

12
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:57,355
I hope so. They haven't
posted any grades yet.

13
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:00,229
A job's come up and I thought about you.

14
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:04,778
Not a job, really. More of
an interesting errand. Sit down.

15
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:06,739
Yes, sir.

16
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:12,956
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

17
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:17,083
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years. I gave you an A.

18
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,670
A-minus, sir.

19
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:24,468
Double major: Psych and criminology.
Graduated magna.

20
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:27,383
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

21
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:32,391
It says, when you graduate, you wanna
work for me in Behavioural Science.

22
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

23
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:40,934
We're interviewing all serial killers now in
custody for a psycho-behavioural profile.

24
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,690
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.

25
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,359
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

26
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:50,952
- Do you spook easily, Starling?
- Not yet, sir.

27
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,864
See, the one we want most
refuses to cooperate.

28
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,784
I want you to go after him
again today in the asylum.

29
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,961
- Who's the subject?
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

30
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,329
Hannibal the Cannibal.

31
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,134
I don't expect him to talk to you.

32
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,876
But I have to be able to say we tried.

33
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,131
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

34
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:16,848
How does he look? How does
his cell look? Is he sketching, drawing?

35
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:19,646
If he is, what's he sketching?

36
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,402
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

37
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:31,164
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

38
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:33,963
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

39
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:36,127
OK.

40
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:42,715
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?
Lecter's been in prison for so many years.

41
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:46,178
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

42
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:51,051
I wish there were.
Now, I want your full attention, Starling.

43
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:54,637
- Yes, sir.
- Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

44
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:59,691
Dr Chilton at the asylum will go over all
the physical procedures used with him.

45
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,436
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

46
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:06,145
And you're to tell him nothing personal.

47
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:09,865
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

48
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:13,031
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

49
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:14,195
And what is that?

50
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:18,662
Oh, he's a monster. A pure psychopath.

51
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,328
So rare to capture one alive.

52
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:25,959
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

53
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:34,928
We get a lot of detectives here, but
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

54
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:39,806
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

55
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:45,063
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

56
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:47,399
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr Chilton,

57
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,948
but my instructions are to talk to Dr Lecter
and report back this afternoon.

58
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,407
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

59
00:08:56,535 --> 00:09:01,281
We've tried to study him, but he's much
too sophisticated for the standard tests.

60
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,704
Oh, my, does he hate us!

61
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,084
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

62
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,303
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

63
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:14,729
- What do you mean, sir?
- A pretty, young woman to turn him on.

64
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,936
I don't believe Lecter's
seen a woman in eight years.

65
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:21,935
And are you ever his taste! So to speak.

66
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:25,072
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It's not a charm school.

67
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,817
Good. Then you should
be able to remember the rules.

68
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:35,369
Do not touch or approach the glass.
You pass him nothing but soft paper.

69
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,249
No pencils or pens.
No staples or paperclips in his paper.

70
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:44,171
Use the sliding food carrier. If he attempts
to pass you anything, do not accept it.

71
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,965
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

72
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:51,424
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

73
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:57,144
On July 8, 1981, he complained of chest
pains and was taken to the dispensary.

74
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,939
His restraints were removed for an EKG.

75
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:03,812
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

76
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:10,523
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less, save one of her eyes.

77
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:15,236
His pulse never got above 85,
even when he ate her tongue.

78
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,949
- I keep him in here.
- Dr Chilton.

79
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:24,492
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

80
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:29,585
then maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself. What do you think?

81
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:37,754
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

82
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:43,131
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

83
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:48,146
When she's finished, bring her out.

84
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:20,354
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you,
don't get near the glass?

85
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:23,518
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

86
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,648
Nice to meet you, Clarice. You can
hang your coat up there if you like.

87
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,234
Thank you. I will.

88
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:33,856
He's past the others, the last cell.

89
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,449
You keep to the right.

90
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:42,327
- I put out a chair for you.
- That's very good. Thank you.

91
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,544
I'll be watchin'. You'll do fine.

92
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:59,304
Hi.

93
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,946
I can smell your cunt!

94
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:36,844
- Good morning.
- Dr Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

95
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:38,853
May I speak with you?

96
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:41,602
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

97
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:45,981
- I am, yes.
- May I see your credentials?

98
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:48,652
Certainly.

99
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:57,409
Closer, please.

100
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:00,075
Closer.

101
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:20,390
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

102
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:23,341
I'm still in training at the academy.

103
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:27,432
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

104
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:31,776
Yes, I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.

105
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:36,860
Maybe you can decide whether or not
I'm qualified enough to do that.

106
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:41,653
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

107
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:47,703
Sit, please.

108
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:58,212
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

109
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,048
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

110
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,382
He hissed at you. What did he say?

111
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:08,726
He said "I can smell your cunt."

112
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:11,612
I see.

113
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:14,198
I myself cannot.

114
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,250
You use Evyan skin cream.

115
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:30,877
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

116
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:34,674
But not today.

117
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:38,684
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

118
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:44,138
That is the Duomo
seen from the Belvedere.

119
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:50,274
- Do you know Florence?
- All that detail just from memory, sir?

120
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:54,447
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

121
00:14:54,573 --> 00:15:00,446
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

122
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:03,283
Oh, no, no, no, no.

123
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:08,290
You were doing fine. You had been
courteous and receptive to courtesy.

124
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,879
You had established trust, with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

125
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:17,751
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

126
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:22,546
- It won't do.
- I'm only asking you to look at this.

127
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,721
Either you will or you won't.

128
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,634
Yeah. Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed

129
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:31,558
if he's recruiting help
from the student body.

130
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,477
Busy hunting that new one: Buffalo Bill.

131
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,850
What a naughty boy he is.

132
00:15:37,277 --> 00:15:40,527
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

133
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:44,071
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.

134
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,781
It started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

135
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:52,005
They said
"This one likes to skin his humps."

136
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:58,719
Why do you think he removes
their skins, Agent Starling?

137
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:01,093
Thrill me with your acumen.

138
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:07,316
It excites him. Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

139
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:11,521
- I didn't.
- No. No, you ate yours.

140
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:16,320
You send that through now.

141
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:48,426
Oh, Agent Starling, you think you can
dissect me with this blunt little tool?

142
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:51,516
No. I thought that your knowledge...

143
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:53,890
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

144
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:57,894
Do you know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

145
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,105
You look like a rube.

146
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,319
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube,
with a little taste.

147
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,449
Good nutrition's given you length of bone,

148
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,822
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash, are you?

149
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,953
And that accent you've tried so
desperately to shed: Pure West Virginia.

150
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,252
What is your father, dear? Is he
a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp?

151
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:25,136
How quickly the boys found you.

152
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:28,880
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

153
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:32,527
while you could only dream of
getting out, getting anywhere,

154
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:36,818
getting all the way to the FBI.

155
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:42,539
You see a lot, Doctor.

156
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:48,750
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

157
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:54,547
What about it? Why don't you look at
yourself and write down what you see?

158
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,130
Or maybe you're afraid to.

159
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:09,061
A census taker once tried to test me.

160
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,473
I ate his liver with some fava beans

161
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,063
and a nice Chianti.

162
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,868
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

163
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:28,574
Fly, fly, fly.

164
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,800
I bit my wrist so I can die.

165
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:51,181
Look at the blood!

166
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,224
- Got ya!
- Miggs, you stupid fuck!

167
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:01,065
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Agent Starling! Come back!

168
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:05,107
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!
I would not have had that happen to you.

169
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:08,275
- Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly.
- Then do this test.

170
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:11,540
No, but I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

171
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:14,508
- And what is that?
- Advancement. Listen carefully.

172
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:17,255
Look deep within yourself,
Clarice Starling.

173
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:21,254
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

174
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,597
I don't think Miggs could manage again
so soon, even though he is crazy. Go!

175
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:10,554
Hey, Bill.

176
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:16,851
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

177
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:25,650
- Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away today.

178
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:48,250
FBI. Hands up. Don't move.

179
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:52,347
Turn around.
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

180
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,234
You're dead, Starling.

181
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:02,493
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

182
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:04,030
- The corner.
- Did you check?

183
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,870
- No.
- That's why you're dead.

184
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,240
3109.

185
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,624
3109. Breaking doors or windows

186
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:14,586
to enter or exit.

187
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:16,088
Rule 404.

188
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:39,144
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

189
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:42,106
- Starling?
- Sir?

190
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:44,645
Miggs is dead.

191
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:46,525
Dead?

192
00:21:46,658 --> 00:21:48,116
How?

193
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:51,777
They heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon and Miggs crying.

194
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:56,075
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

195
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:00,876
- Starling?
- Yeah. I'm still here, sir.

196
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:04,170
I just... I don't know how to feel about this.

197
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:09,300
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

198
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:15,181
Look, I know it got ugly today, but
you mentioned a name at the end: Mofet.

199
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:17,763
Any follow-up on her?

200
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:21,178
Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories,

201
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:24,812
so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet, but

202
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:29,188
I thought the "yourself" reference
was too hokey for Lecter,

203
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:33,377
so I figured he's from Baltimore
and I looked in the phone book

204
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:39,505
and there's a "Your Self" storage facility
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

205
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:47,633
Unit 31 was leased for ten years,
pre-paid in full.

206
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:52,761
The contract is in the name
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

207
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:56,518
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

208
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:58,938
Not to my knowledge.

209
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:02,852
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

210
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:08,360
Yes. I won't disturb anything, I promise.
I'll be outta here before you know it.

211
00:23:08,494 --> 00:23:10,783
- May I help you?
- Yes, actually.

212
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:21,248
- It's stuck.
- We could return tomorrow with my son.

213
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:24,167
What about him?

214
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:29,091
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labour.

215
00:23:30,096 --> 00:23:34,010
Right. Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

216
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:10,385
It's stuck. Hand me that flashlight, sir.

217
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,153
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

218
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:32,703
this is the number for
our Baltimore field office.

219
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,744
Now they know that you're with me.
Call them if anything should happen.

220
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,331
Yes, Miss Starling.

221
00:27:09,651 --> 00:27:13,316
Clarice. They're waiting for you.
Watch your step.

222
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:19,068
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram,
isn't it, Doctor?

223
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:22,321
Hester Mofet. "The rest of me."

224
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:26,867
"Miss the rest of me."
Meaning that you rented that garage?

225
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:06,084
- Thank you.
- Your bleeding has stopped.

226
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:10,589
How did you...?

227
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:14,464
It's nothing. It was just a scratch.

228
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:18,803
Dr Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

229
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:22,183
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

230
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:26,440
- Do you know something about him?
- I might if I saw the case file.

231
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:30,149
- You could get that for me.
- Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

232
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:32,566
You wanted me to find him.

233
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:38,117
His real name is Benjamin Raspail,
a former patient of mine,

234
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:42,821
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

235
00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:47,542
I did not kill him, merely tucked him
away very much as I found him,

236
00:28:47,668 --> 00:28:51,332
after he'd missed three appointments.

237
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:56,882
- If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?
- Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

238
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:59,416
His therapy was going nowhere.

239
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:02,591
His dress, make-up...

240
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:07,594
- Raspail was a transvestite?
- In life? Oh, no.

241
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:12,614
Garden-variety manic-depressive.
Tedious, very tedious.

242
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:15,199
I now just think of him
as a kind of experiment.

243
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:18,948
A fledgling killer's
first effort at transformation.

244
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,953
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

245
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:26,671
Scared at first, then exhilarated.

246
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:33,009
Jack Crawford is helping your career.
Apparently he likes you and you like him.

247
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,177
I never thought about it.

248
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:38,094
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

249
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:43,432
True, he is much older, but do you think
he visualises scenarios, exchanges,

250
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:46,019
fucking you?

251
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:53,814
That doesn't interest me and, frankly,
it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

252
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,404
Not any more.

253
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:06,578
Thank you, Barney.

254
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:12,209
What happened to your drawings?

255
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:17,668
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel programme.

256
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:20,803
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

257
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,263
Dr Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

258
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:28,594
What did you mean
by "transformation", Doctor?

259
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:39,985
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

260
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:44,194
I know they will never ever
let me out while I'm alive.

261
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:46,532
What I want is a view.

262
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:50,541
I want a window where I can
see a tree, or even water.

263
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:54,177
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr Chilton.

264
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:58,967
What did you mean by "fledgling killer"?
Are you saying that he's killed again?

265
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:04,806
I'm offering you a psychological profile of
Buffalo Bill, based on the case evidence.

266
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:12,441
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

267
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,366
You know who he is, don't you?

268
00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:24,826
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

269
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:27,994
All good things to those who wait.

270
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:32,540
I've waited, Clarice, but how long
can you and old Jackie Boy wait?

271
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:38,297
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady.

272
00:31:42,098 --> 00:31:45,799
MEMPHIS, TN

273
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,579
Hey, little cheeper.

274
00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:54,041
I'll be right there.

275
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,488
Can I help you with that?

276
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,239
- Would you?
- Sure.

277
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:29,157
- Thank you.
- You look kinda handicapped.

278
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:33,832
Yeah. I got it this far. I just can't
get it up in the truck by myself.

279
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:37,210
- Here. Grab this.
- OK.

280
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:39,829
Just set it down. That's good.

281
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:44,010
Get in the truck.
I wanna push it all the way up.

282
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:47,719
I really appreciate this.
Thank you. Thank you.

283
00:33:48,182 --> 00:33:50,221
Push it all the way back.

284
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:54,016
- Is this good?
- Yeah.

285
00:33:56,397 --> 00:33:58,935
- That's great.
- OK.

286
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:01,605
Say, are you about a size 14?

287
00:34:01,736 --> 00:34:03,775
Sorry?

288
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:26,141
Good.

289
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,700
Oh, good.

290
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:47,865
Good.

291
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:18,939
Starling!

292
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,859
Outside. Let's go.

293
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:27,404
Cindy. In the ring for Starling. Let's go.

294
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:36,872
FBI!

295
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,573
Pack your field gear.
You're going with Crawford.

296
00:35:39,711 --> 00:35:41,868
- Where?
- They found a girl's body.

297
00:35:42,004 --> 00:35:44,874
Been in the water a week.
It's a Buffalo Bill situation.

298
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:50,141
CLAY COUNTY, W VA

299
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,988
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

300
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,152
No evidence of rape
or physical abuse prior to death.

301
00:36:03,285 --> 00:36:06,570
All the mutilation
you see there is postmortem.

302
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:09,741
OK, three days. Then he shoots them,

303
00:36:09,874 --> 00:36:14,252
skins them and dumps them,
each body in a different river.

304
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:17,463
The water leaves us
no trace evidence of any kind.

305
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,046
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

306
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:23,211
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

307
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:26,215
so actually she was the third girl found.

308
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:29,384
After her, he got lazy.

309
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:33,141
OK, let's see.

310
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:37,934
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.

311
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:42,812
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.

312
00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:06,290
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

313
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:11,765
He's a white male. Serial killers tend
to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

314
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,598
He's not a drifter. He's got his own
house somewhere, not an apartment.

315
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:20,096
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

316
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,773
He's in his thirties or forties.
He's got real physical strength,

317
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:27,606
combined with
an older man's self-control.

318
00:37:27,738 --> 00:37:29,896
He's cautious, precise...

319
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:34,086
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

320
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:36,918
Why not?

321
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,426
Got a real taste for it now
and he's getting better at his work.

322
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:45,057
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

323
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:50,675
Yes, sir. You haven't mentioned anything
about the information in my report

324
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,969
or Dr Lecter's offer, sir.

325
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,813
- I'm considering it.
- That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

326
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,860
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

327
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:08,778
Well, if that was the case, then
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

328
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:13,247
If I'd sent you in with an actual agenda,
Lecter would have known it instantly.

329
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:17,122
He would have toyed with you
then turned to stone.

330
00:38:50,574 --> 00:38:53,824
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.
These are the FBI people.

331
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:58,030
Sheriff Perkins - Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry.

332
00:38:58,162 --> 00:39:01,863
Agent Starling. We appreciate
being invited into your jurisdiction.

333
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:05,451
I didn't call you. That was
the state attorney's office.

334
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:09,714
- We'll extend you every courtesy, but...
- Sheriff.

335
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:14,763
This type of sex crime has certain aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

336
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:16,938
Know what I mean?

337
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,712
- Oscar, fetch Dr Akins from the chapel.
- Starling, we're back here.

338
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:14,217
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

339
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:17,601
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

340
00:41:19,063 --> 00:41:21,768
I need a six-way linkup.

341
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,975
Chicago, Detroit...

342
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,150
What?

343
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:33,857
Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You officers and gentlemen,

344
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:36,698
listen here now.
There's things we need to do for her.

345
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,456
I know that y'all brought her this far and
her folks would thank you if they could

346
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,825
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

347
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:47,294
But now please go on now
and let us take care of her.

348
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,255
Go on now.

349
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,676
Thank you.

350
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,598
Thank you.

351
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,849
OK, good.

352
00:42:10,485 --> 00:42:13,154
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.

353
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,735
Stand by for transmission.

354
00:42:19,158 --> 00:42:21,198
Ray.

355
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:36,093
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

356
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:03,082
OK, Starling.

357
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,630
Bill.

358
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:29,357
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.

359
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:33,568
A muzzle stamp at the top.

360
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:35,856
Wrongful death.

361
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:40,450
She'll have to go to
the state pathologist at Claxton.

362
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:44,789
Well, I'd better get back to that service.
Lamar'll help you.

363
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:46,955
Lord Almighty.

364
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:54,047
What else do you see, Starling?

365
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:56,630
Well, she's not local.

366
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:03,010
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's glitter nail polish.

367
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,596
That looks like town to me.

368
00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:16,864
Two of her fingernails are broken off
and there's dirt or grit under them.

369
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:20,497
It looks like she's tried
to claw her way through something.

370
00:44:20,626 --> 00:44:25,287
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax 'em for Missing Persons.

371
00:44:34,554 --> 00:44:36,593
Let's do another.

372
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:47,810
She's got something in her throat.

373
00:44:47,942 --> 00:44:52,817
When a body comes out of the water,
lots of times there's leaves in the mouth.

374
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:27,221
What is that? Some kind of seed pod?

375
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,261
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

376
00:45:30,982 --> 00:45:33,686
There's no way that could
get way down in there.

377
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:36,735
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

378
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:42,611
She'll be easier to print when we turn
her over. Lamar, give me a hand.

379
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:44,781
Yes, sir. I will.

380
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:54,465
- Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?
- Different configuration than the others.

381
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:57,266
- Get close-ups.
- The victim's skin removed,

382
00:45:57,392 --> 00:46:00,926
this time in two large diamond-shaped
sections above the buttocks.

383
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:04,645
Exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae,

384
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:07,347
six inches from the right shoulder blade.

385
00:46:07,485 --> 00:46:13,237
Starling, when I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

386
00:46:13,365 --> 00:46:15,404
that really burned you, didn't it?

387
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:19,116
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

388
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:23,539
It matters, Mr Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.

389
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:26,122
- It matters.
- Point taken.

390
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:36,630
Ligature marks found around the wrists,
not around the ankles.

391
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:40,805
This would indicate that
the skinning was postmortem.

392
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:06,487
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- You lured him with produce.

393
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:10,119
Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

394
00:47:10,248 --> 00:47:12,537
Nice and slow, baby.

395
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:16,581
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

396
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,836
Course it counts. How do you play?

397
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,797
Agent Starling?

398
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:27,587
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

399
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:32,231
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim in the Elk River.

400
00:47:32,364 --> 00:47:35,449
- It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
- I can't tell you any more.

401
00:47:35,576 --> 00:47:39,157
- We heard about it on the radio.
- This is a clue from a real murder case?

402
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:42,952
- Cool.
- Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.

403
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:46,328
Sphingid ceratomia, maybe.

404
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:49,212
Boy, he's a big sucker.

405
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,164
OK. Let's check morphology.

406
00:48:01,598 --> 00:48:06,011
What do you do when you're
not detecting, Agent Starling?

407
00:48:06,145 --> 00:48:08,600
I try to be a student, Dr Pilcher.

408
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:12,438
Ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

409
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:14,773
The amusing house wine?

410
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:17,436
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

411
00:48:17,572 --> 00:48:18,651
Yes.

412
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:20,572
- Gotcha.
- What have you got?

413
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,611
Agent Starling, meet Mr Acherontia styx.

414
00:48:26,122 --> 00:48:27,117
Weird.

415
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:30,450
Better known to his friends
as the death's-head moth.

416
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:34,747
- Where does it come from?
- It's strange. They only live in Asia.

417
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,714
Here they'd have to be
raised from imported eggs.

418
00:48:37,841 --> 00:48:43,843
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey
and nightshade, kept him warm.

419
00:48:43,972 --> 00:48:46,544
Somebody loved him.

420
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:21,970
Where are you?

421
00:49:22,934 --> 00:49:24,973
Let me outta here!

422
00:49:25,937 --> 00:49:27,976
Help me!

423
00:49:31,317 --> 00:49:33,356
Please!

424
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:35,941
Please help me.

425
00:49:39,282 --> 00:49:41,156
Please!

426
00:49:41,284 --> 00:49:43,821
Why won't you answer me? Please!

427
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:50,122
- Good morning. I'm Donna Feruchi.
- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

428
00:49:53,753 --> 00:49:57,620
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

429
00:49:57,757 --> 00:50:01,090
listed as missing, is now
believed to have been kidnapped

430
00:50:01,218 --> 00:50:04,089
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

431
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:07,755
Police indicate that the girl's
blouse has been identified,

432
00:50:07,891 --> 00:50:12,516
sliced up the back, in what has become
a grim, all-too-familiar calling card.

433
00:50:12,644 --> 00:50:16,428
Young Catherine Martin is the only
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

434
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:18,807
the Republican senator from Tennessee.

435
00:50:18,942 --> 00:50:22,394
Her kidnapping is not considered
to be politically motivated,

436
00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:25,696
but it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.

437
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:30,366
Reached for comment on the ski slopes
of Vermont, the president is said to be,

438
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,701
and I quote, "intensely concerned".

439
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:37,408
Just moments ago Senator Martin
taped this dramatic personal plea.

440
00:50:37,543 --> 00:50:42,004
I'm speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter.

441
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:45,548
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

442
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:48,923
Talk to her and you'll see.

443
00:50:50,017 --> 00:50:53,109
You have the power. You are in charge.

444
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:59,774
I know you can feel love and compassion.

445
00:51:01,243 --> 00:51:05,075
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

446
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:08,739
that you can be merciful
as well as strong,

447
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:14,116
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.

448
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:16,329
You have that power.

449
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:18,539
Please.

450
00:51:18,674 --> 00:51:20,631
My daughter is Catherine.

451
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:24,591
Boy, that's smart.
Jesus, that's really smart.

452
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:26,963
She keeps repeating the name.

453
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:33,018
If he sees Catherine as a person and not
just an object, it's harder to tear her up.

454
00:51:33,146 --> 00:51:35,553
Release my little girl.

455
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:39,224
You're coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

456
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,274
and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

457
00:51:43,406 --> 00:51:47,699
Sir, I told you, this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

458
00:51:47,827 --> 00:51:51,325
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

459
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:55,997
Look, I am not just
some turnkey, Miss Starling.

460
00:51:57,043 --> 00:52:00,127
This is the number
for the US attorney's office.

461
00:52:00,255 --> 00:52:05,593
Either you discuss this with him or you
let me do my job, do you understand?

462
00:52:09,346 --> 00:52:15,716
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill
in time to save Catherine Martin,

463
00:52:15,852 --> 00:52:18,307
the senator promises you a transfer

464
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:22,684
to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New
York, with a view of the woods nearby.

465
00:52:22,816 --> 00:52:25,816
Maximum security still applies, of course.

466
00:52:25,944 --> 00:52:29,229
You'd have reasonable access to books.

467
00:52:29,364 --> 00:52:31,617
Best of all, though,

468
00:52:31,753 --> 00:52:35,880
one week of the year,
you get to leave the hospital

469
00:52:36,006 --> 00:52:38,046
and go here.

470
00:52:40,802 --> 00:52:43,589
Plum Island.

471
00:52:43,721 --> 00:52:48,430
Every day of that week you may walk on
the beach, you may swim in the ocean,

472
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,221
for up to one hour, under SWAT team
surveillance, of course.

473
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,395
And there you have it.

474
00:52:58,526 --> 00:53:02,026
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

475
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,987
A copy of the senator's offer.

476
00:53:06,117 --> 00:53:10,031
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

477
00:53:10,163 --> 00:53:13,247
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

478
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:26,499
"Plum Island Animal Disease
Research Centre."

479
00:53:29,304 --> 00:53:31,545
Sounds charming.

480
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,298
That's only a part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.

481
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:39,052
- Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
- Terns?

482
00:53:41,023 --> 00:53:44,189
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us too.

483
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,402
Suid pro quo. I tell you things,
you tell me things.

484
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:50,280
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

485
00:53:50,406 --> 00:53:53,442
Suid pro quo. Yes or no?

486
00:53:55,953 --> 00:53:59,488
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

487
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,996
Go, Doctor.

488
00:54:03,127 --> 00:54:05,877
What is your worst memory of childhood?

489
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,306
The death of my father.

490
00:54:10,437 --> 00:54:13,473
Tell me about it and don't lie, or I'll know.

491
00:54:14,566 --> 00:54:16,605
He was a town marshal.

492
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:21,147
One night he surprised two burglars

493
00:54:21,281 --> 00:54:23,735
coming out the back of a drugstore.

494
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:27,031
They shot him.

495
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,319
Was he killed outright?

496
00:54:29,454 --> 00:54:33,403
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

497
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:37,579
My mother died when I was very young.

498
00:54:39,254 --> 00:54:43,797
My father had become the whole world to
me, and, when he left me, I had nothing.

499
00:54:43,925 --> 00:54:46,167
I was ten years old.

500
00:54:46,678 --> 00:54:49,632
You're very frank, Clarice.

501
00:54:49,764 --> 00:54:54,592
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

502
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:59,098
Suid pro quo, Doctor.

503
00:54:59,231 --> 00:55:03,809
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

504
00:55:06,655 --> 00:55:10,024
- Yes.
- Big through the hips? Roomy?

505
00:55:10,158 --> 00:55:13,360
- They all were.
- What else?

506
00:55:13,494 --> 00:55:17,538
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

507
00:55:17,665 --> 00:55:22,160
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

508
00:55:22,293 --> 00:55:25,247
Was it a butterfly?

509
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,419
Yes. A moth.

510
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:34,135
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

511
00:55:34,262 --> 00:55:37,097
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

512
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:41,171
The significance of the moth is change.

513
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:44,760
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa,

514
00:55:44,896 --> 00:55:47,849
and from thence into beauty.

515
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:50,947
Our Billy wants to change, too.

516
00:55:51,622 --> 00:55:54,825
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence.

517
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:58,208
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.

518
00:55:58,337 --> 00:56:02,002
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him, do you realise that?

519
00:56:02,132 --> 00:56:04,622
No. Tell me why.

520
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:09,717
After your father's murder you were
orphaned. What happened next?

521
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:17,011
I don't imagine the answer is
on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

522
00:56:17,146 --> 00:56:22,732
I lived with my mother's cousin and her
husband in Montana. They had a ranch.

523
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:26,310
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.

524
00:56:26,738 --> 00:56:30,237
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.

525
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,820
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.

526
00:56:33,953 --> 00:56:37,902
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

527
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,578
Did he sodomise you?

528
00:56:40,709 --> 00:56:44,208
No. He was a very decent man.

529
00:56:45,546 --> 00:56:48,002
Suid pro quo, Doctor.

530
00:56:49,508 --> 00:56:54,050
Billy is not a real transsexual.
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

531
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:57,345
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

532
00:56:57,473 --> 00:57:01,305
You said that I was very close to the way
we would catch him. What did you mean?

533
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:04,970
There are three centres for
transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,

534
00:57:05,106 --> 00:57:08,522
the University of Minnesota
and Columbus Medical Centre.

535
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:13,442
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied
for sex reassignment at all of them

536
00:57:13,572 --> 00:57:15,944
and been rejected.

537
00:57:16,074 --> 00:57:18,779
On what basis would they reject him?

538
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:23,453
Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.

539
00:57:23,582 --> 00:57:26,535
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

540
00:57:26,668 --> 00:57:30,842
He was made one through years
of systematic abuse.

541
00:57:30,975 --> 00:57:34,391
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

542
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,307
and he thinks
that makes him a transsexual.

543
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,437
But his pathology is
a thousand times more savage

544
00:57:41,569 --> 00:57:44,023
and more terrifying.

545
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:51,402
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

546
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:57,371
Mister, my family'll pay cash. Whatever
ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

547
00:57:57,498 --> 00:58:02,075
It rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again.

548
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:07,581
Yes, it will, Precious. It will get the hose.

549
00:58:07,715 --> 00:58:09,754
OK, OK.

550
00:58:16,098 --> 00:58:21,055
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges, I promise.

551
00:58:22,395 --> 00:58:24,886
See, my mom is a real important woman.

552
00:58:25,022 --> 00:58:27,228
I guess you already know that.

553
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:30,561
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

554
00:58:30,694 --> 00:58:32,105
Please!

555
00:58:32,696 --> 00:58:34,735
Please!

556
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:38,817
I wanna go home, please!

557
00:58:38,952 --> 00:58:41,277
It places the lotion in the basket.

558
00:58:42,246 --> 00:58:44,286
I wanna see my mommy!

559
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:46,958
Please!

560
00:58:47,085 --> 00:58:49,124
I wanna see my...

561
00:58:51,338 --> 00:58:53,544
I wanna see my mommy.

562
00:58:54,257 --> 00:58:56,713
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

563
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:36,629
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

564
00:59:36,767 --> 00:59:39,388
I don't think so.

565
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:42,009
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

566
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:44,815
She never heard of any deal with you.

567
00:59:45,691 --> 00:59:48,360
They scammed you, Hannibal.

568
00:59:49,695 --> 00:59:52,067
Stand outside.

569
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,779
And shut the door.

570
01:00:01,956 --> 01:00:06,332
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

571
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:11,583
I designed it. Of course, I worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well.

572
01:00:11,714 --> 01:00:17,087
Identify Buffalo Bill by name
and, if the girl is found in time,

573
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:22,639
Senator Martin will have you transferred
to the state prison in Tennessee.

574
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:25,552
Answer me, Hannibal.

575
01:00:26,561 --> 01:00:31,223
You answer me now or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

576
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,189
Who is Buffalo Bill?

577
01:00:36,361 --> 01:00:38,733
His first name is Louis.

578
01:00:38,863 --> 01:00:42,279
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,
but only in Tennessee.

579
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:45,279
And I have a few conditions of my own.

580
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:49,864
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

581
01:00:50,845 --> 01:00:54,130
Jack, Hannibal Lecter's
being transferred to Memphis.

582
01:00:54,265 --> 01:00:55,593
Transferred?

583
01:00:55,724 --> 01:01:00,184
Did you have a trainee make a phoney
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

584
01:01:00,311 --> 01:01:02,434
Yeah, I rolled the dice. I had to.

585
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:06,643
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

586
01:01:06,775 --> 01:01:09,692
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis.

587
01:01:16,158 --> 01:01:19,907
MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

588
01:01:34,425 --> 01:01:38,968
Welcome to Memphis. I'm Lieutenant
Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

589
01:01:39,097 --> 01:01:41,172
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

590
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:45,470
You be a gentleman, you're gonna
get three hots and a cot.

591
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:49,647
Sir. You sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

592
01:01:52,192 --> 01:01:53,651
Where's...?

593
01:01:54,778 --> 01:01:56,816
Here, sir. Use mine.

594
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:47,663
Senator Martin, Dr Hannibal Lecter.

595
01:02:52,841 --> 01:02:58,428
Dr Lecter, I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

596
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:01,591
You'll wanna read it before I sign.

597
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:09,187
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time, bargaining for petty privileges.

598
01:03:09,315 --> 01:03:13,608
Clarice Starling and that awful Jack
Crawford have wasted far too much time.

599
01:03:13,736 --> 01:03:17,187
I only pray they haven't
doomed the poor girl.

600
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:21,446
Let me help you now and I will
trust you when it is all over.

601
01:03:21,576 --> 01:03:24,031
You have my word. Paul?

602
01:03:26,037 --> 01:03:28,742
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

603
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:34,116
I met him just once. He was referred
to me in April or May 1980

604
01:03:34,254 --> 01:03:37,041
by my patient, Benjamin Raspail.

605
01:03:37,173 --> 01:03:39,331
They were lovers, you see.

606
01:03:39,466 --> 01:03:43,546
But Raspail had become very frightened.

607
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:47,129
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient

608
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:50,515
and done things with the skin.

609
01:03:51,602 --> 01:03:55,385
We need his address
and a physical description.

610
01:03:55,522 --> 01:04:00,231
Tell me, Senator. Did you
nurse Catherine yourself?

611
01:04:00,735 --> 01:04:03,061
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

612
01:04:03,196 --> 01:04:05,865
- Now, wait a minute.
- Yes, I did.

613
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:09,865
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!

614
01:04:09,998 --> 01:04:13,789
Amputate a man's leg
and he can still feel it tickling.

615
01:04:13,926 --> 01:04:19,003
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab, where will it tickle you?

616
01:04:19,848 --> 01:04:22,885
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

617
01:04:24,186 --> 01:04:27,270
Five foot ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

618
01:04:27,398 --> 01:04:30,066
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.

619
01:04:30,191 --> 01:04:34,603
He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived
in Philadelphia but may have lied.

620
01:04:34,736 --> 01:04:40,690
That's all I can remember, Mom, but if
I think of any more, I will let you know.

621
01:04:41,909 --> 01:04:44,234
And, Senator, just one more thing.

622
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:49,159
Love your suit.

623
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:53,833
In a meeting this evening
with Senator Ruth Martin,

624
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:57,081
Dr Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation

625
01:04:57,215 --> 01:05:00,169
of trying to find the abductor, Buffalo Bill.

626
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:03,052
- How do you fit in?
- My insight into Lecter's mind

627
01:05:03,178 --> 01:05:06,629
- made this breakthrough possible.
- Buffalo Bill's real name?

628
01:05:06,765 --> 01:05:10,264
That is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities.

629
01:05:10,393 --> 01:05:14,142
- My name is Dr Frederick Chilton.
- How do you spell that?

630
01:05:15,899 --> 01:05:20,560
- Are you with Dr Chilton's group?
- Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

631
01:05:20,694 --> 01:05:24,110
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've been getting death threats.

632
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:26,695
I understand, sir.

633
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:34,494
Log in and check your weapon.

634
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:38,996
I can't take all the credit.
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,

635
01:05:39,127 --> 01:05:42,163
people at the FBI, folks
at the Baltimore state hospital.

636
01:05:42,297 --> 01:05:45,666
And now for the hard part:
Apprehending the suspect.

637
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,418
Excuse me, folks.
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

638
01:06:03,245 --> 01:06:05,321
Is it true what they're sayin'?

639
01:06:07,249 --> 01:06:09,407
He's some kind of vampire?

640
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:14,747
They don't have a name for what he is.

641
01:06:14,881 --> 01:06:17,288
You do know the rules, ma'am?

642
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:21,209
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

643
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:25,387
Go ahead.

644
01:07:01,629 --> 01:07:03,871
Good evening, Clarice.

645
01:07:05,174 --> 01:07:09,172
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

646
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:13,259
Just until you get your view.

647
01:07:13,391 --> 01:07:16,060
How very thoughtful.

648
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,430
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

649
01:07:19,562 --> 01:07:22,184
before you're both booted off the case?

650
01:07:22,315 --> 01:07:25,067
No, I came because I wanted to.

651
01:07:29,155 --> 01:07:31,575
People will say we're in love.

652
01:07:35,756 --> 01:07:38,294
Anthrax Island.

653
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:41,510
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

654
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:44,389
- Yours?
- Yes.

655
01:07:44,515 --> 01:07:46,673
Yeah.

656
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:50,592
That was good.
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

657
01:07:50,728 --> 01:07:53,349
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

658
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,683
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

659
01:07:56,817 --> 01:07:58,939
Louis Friend?

660
01:07:59,069 --> 01:08:02,188
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

661
01:08:02,614 --> 01:08:06,528
Oh, Clarice, your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

662
01:08:06,952 --> 01:08:12,075
You were telling me the truth back in
Baltimore, sir. Please continue now.

663
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:14,993
I've read the case files. Have you?

664
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:18,162
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages.

665
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:23,087
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

666
01:08:23,217 --> 01:08:28,340
Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each
particular thing, ask what is it in itself?

667
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:30,547
What is its nature?

668
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:34,596
What does he do, this man you seek?

669
01:08:36,103 --> 01:08:40,481
- He kills women.
- No. That is incidental.

670
01:08:41,566 --> 01:08:46,607
What is the first thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

671
01:08:47,155 --> 01:08:49,194
Anger.

672
01:08:50,074 --> 01:08:52,114
Social acceptance.

673
01:08:53,494 --> 01:08:57,824
- Sexual frustrations.
- No. He covets.

674
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:03,119
That is his nature.
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

675
01:09:03,919 --> 01:09:06,919
Do we seek out things to covet?

676
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:09,086
Make an effort to answer now.

677
01:09:09,215 --> 01:09:11,849
No. We just...

678
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,312
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day.

679
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:18,726
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

680
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:22,855
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

681
01:09:23,656 --> 01:09:26,230
All right, yes. Now please tell me how...

682
01:09:26,367 --> 01:09:30,235
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

683
01:09:30,371 --> 01:09:33,537
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

684
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:36,286
Why did you leave that ranch?

685
01:09:36,418 --> 01:09:40,581
Doctor, we don't have
any more time for any of this now.

686
01:09:40,714 --> 01:09:43,287
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

687
01:09:43,425 --> 01:09:47,754
- This is all the time you'll ever have.
- Later. Listen to me. We've only got five...

688
01:09:47,887 --> 01:09:51,220
No. I will listen now.

689
01:09:53,559 --> 01:09:56,476
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

690
01:09:56,603 --> 01:10:00,304
You went to live with cousins on
a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

691
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,480
And?

692
01:10:03,777 --> 01:10:05,898
And one morning I just ran away.

693
01:10:06,695 --> 01:10:10,277
Not "just", Clarice. What set you off?

694
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:14,025
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.

695
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:18,110
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

696
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:22,453
I heard a strange noise.

697
01:10:22,584 --> 01:10:24,577
What was it?

698
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:27,915
It was screaming.

699
01:10:30,133 --> 01:10:33,253
Some kind of screaming.
Like a child's voice.

700
01:10:33,387 --> 01:10:35,344
What did you do?

701
01:10:35,472 --> 01:10:38,093
I went downstairs.

702
01:10:38,225 --> 01:10:40,263
Outside.

703
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:44,479
I crept up into the barn.

704
01:10:44,605 --> 01:10:48,472
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

705
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:52,240
What did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

706
01:10:53,751 --> 01:10:56,075
Lambs.

707
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:58,287
They were screaming.

708
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,173
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

709
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:04,627
And they were screaming.

710
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:09,637
- And you ran away?
- No. First I tried to free them.

711
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:13,512
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

712
01:11:13,643 --> 01:11:17,343
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

713
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,516
But you could - and you did, didn't you?

714
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:24,349
Yes. I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

715
01:11:24,486 --> 01:11:28,780
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know. I didn't have any food,

716
01:11:28,907 --> 01:11:32,191
any water and it was very cold, very cold.

717
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:36,362
I thought...

718
01:11:36,497 --> 01:11:39,581
I thought if I could save just one, but...

719
01:11:41,001 --> 01:11:43,574
He was so heavy.

720
01:11:43,712 --> 01:11:45,752
So heavy.

721
01:11:50,551 --> 01:11:55,343
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

722
01:11:57,683 --> 01:12:02,559
The rancher was so angry, he sent me
to live at the orphanage in Bozeman.

723
01:12:02,688 --> 01:12:04,929
I never saw the ranch again.

724
01:12:05,398 --> 01:12:08,103
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

725
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:13,894
- He killed him.
- You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

726
01:12:14,031 --> 01:12:16,522
Wake up in the dark

727
01:12:16,658 --> 01:12:19,409
and hear the screaming of the lambs?

728
01:12:19,994 --> 01:12:22,032
Yes.

729
01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:26,915
And you think, if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

730
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,200
You think if Catherine lives,

731
01:12:29,335 --> 01:12:32,716
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

732
01:12:32,851 --> 01:12:35,686
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

733
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:38,265
I don't know.

734
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:40,813
I don't know.

735
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:43,982
Thank you, Clarice.

736
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:49,114
- Thank you.
- Tell me his name, Doctor.

737
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:58,033
Dr Chilton, I presume.

738
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,621
I think you know each other.

739
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,126
OK.

740
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:08,457
- Let's go.
- It's your turn, Doctor.

741
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,668
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

742
01:13:10,802 --> 01:13:14,930
Sorry, ma'am. I've got orders. I have
to put you on a plane. Come on now.

743
01:13:15,056 --> 01:13:17,345
Brave Clarice.

744
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:21,058
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

745
01:13:21,187 --> 01:13:25,730
- Tell me his name, Doctor.
- Clarice.

746
01:13:25,858 --> 01:13:28,561
Your case file.

747
01:13:32,738 --> 01:13:35,490
Goodbye, Clarice.

748
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:44,272
- Ready when you are, doc.
- Just another minute, please.

749
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:57,949
Son of a bitch demanded a second
dinner. Lamb chops, extra rare.

750
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:02,904
I wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?

751
01:15:24,143 --> 01:15:27,890
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- OK, doc. Grab some floor.

752
01:15:28,021 --> 01:15:30,060
Same drill as before, please.

753
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:39,691
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

754
01:15:55,724 --> 01:15:57,763
OK.

755
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:05,770
Hand me that, would ya?

756
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:13,111
Thanks.

757
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:18,862
Mind the drawings, please.

758
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,119
Thank you.

759
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:49,475
Watch it. He's cuffed me!

760
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,068
Jesus Christ!

761
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,107
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

762
01:18:28,248 --> 01:18:30,324
What is this shit?

763
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:36,458
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.

764
01:18:36,589 --> 01:18:39,708
Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

765
01:18:41,218 --> 01:18:45,382
CP. Shots fired on five.
Repeat: Shots fired on five.

766
01:18:45,514 --> 01:18:47,554
Sergeant Tate.

767
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:52,264
- Holy shit.
- What the hell...?

768
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:56,094
Shut up. Bobby, get the vest.

769
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:59,067
- Right, sarge.
- Brady, Howard, cover...

770
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:01,232
Look!

771
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:07,656
- It's stopped.
- Seal off a ten-block radius.

772
01:19:07,783 --> 01:19:10,547
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

773
01:19:10,673 --> 01:19:12,630
We're goin' up.

774
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,152
Pembry!

775
01:19:44,121 --> 01:19:46,160
Boyle!

776
01:19:58,592 --> 01:20:00,834
Oh, God.

777
01:20:07,016 --> 01:20:09,056
Go.

778
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:19,144
- Clear.
- Command post.

779
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:21,732
Two officers down.

780
01:20:23,072 --> 01:20:26,275
- Lecter's gone, sarge.
- Prisoner is missing.

781
01:20:26,408 --> 01:20:30,868
- Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
- Repeat: Lecter is missing and armed.

782
01:20:30,995 --> 01:20:35,372
He's stripped the bed. Might be
makin' a rope. Check all windows.

783
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:38,407
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

784
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:43,255
He's alive. Sergeant Tate, he's alive.

785
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:47,172
Get a hold of him
and feel his hand. Talk to him.

786
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:51,097
- What do I say?
- It's Jim Pembry. Talk to him, dammit!

787
01:20:52,443 --> 01:20:54,566
Lecter is missing and armed.

788
01:20:54,695 --> 01:20:56,902
Pembry, can you hear me?

789
01:20:57,031 --> 01:21:01,942
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one
round. There's a chance Lecter was hit.

790
01:21:02,078 --> 01:21:05,908
Keep breathin' in and out.
That's it. You're doing a good job.

791
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:08,411
You look real good.

792
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:11,412
Yeah, you look real good.

793
01:21:28,392 --> 01:21:30,266
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

794
01:21:30,394 --> 01:21:32,434
Let's go.

795
01:21:42,739 --> 01:21:46,902
Looking good, Pembry. You're gonna
make it. You're doin' just fine.

796
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:49,442
I need that IV now!

797
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:53,658
Can we get the straps?
Where's the fucking oxygen?

798
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:56,246
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

799
01:21:57,294 --> 01:21:59,749
We're losin' him. Downstairs.

800
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,953
And up.

801
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:05,131
Elevator!

802
01:22:10,723 --> 01:22:12,549
CP to Tate.

803
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:15,553
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

804
01:22:15,686 --> 01:22:18,640
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.

805
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:21,262
He seems to be hangin' on.

806
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:23,890
Top three floors secured.

807
01:22:24,026 --> 01:22:26,066
Main stairwell secured.

808
01:22:27,112 --> 01:22:29,151
We think he's on two.

809
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:44,634
Tate, are you still with me?

810
01:22:46,266 --> 01:22:51,508
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two,
sir. That's all for now. Over.

811
01:23:10,205 --> 01:23:12,660
He's on the roof of the elevator.

812
01:23:15,293 --> 01:23:17,286
OK, guys.

813
01:23:33,391 --> 01:23:34,766
I see him.

814
01:23:34,892 --> 01:23:37,181
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

815
01:23:37,978 --> 01:23:40,813
- One warning: We need him alive.
- Got it.

816
01:23:41,857 --> 01:23:44,728
Lecter, put your hands on your head.

817
01:23:47,696 --> 01:23:49,736
One in the leg.

818
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:02,408
No movement.

819
01:24:03,002 --> 01:24:06,122
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're comin' into the car.

820
01:24:06,255 --> 01:24:08,543
We're openin' the hatch.

821
01:24:08,673 --> 01:24:11,888
Watch his hands.
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.

822
01:24:12,022 --> 01:24:14,098
- Affirm.
- Got it.

823
01:24:40,214 --> 01:24:42,253
Memphis General, medical unit 26.

824
01:24:42,382 --> 01:24:46,795
We're inbound with a male police officer
with severe facial lacerations.

825
01:24:46,928 --> 01:24:51,554
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal
seizure activity but he's post-ictal now.

826
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:54,636
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

827
01:24:54,768 --> 01:24:57,176
- 90?
- Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 84.

828
01:24:57,313 --> 01:25:02,270
We got him on lactated Ringer's and
the patient is on ten litres of oxygen...

829
01:25:09,073 --> 01:25:14,530
They found the ambulance in a parking
garage at the airport. Crew was dead.

830
01:25:14,996 --> 01:25:18,743
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

831
01:25:19,165 --> 01:25:22,416
- By now he could be anywhere.
- He won't come after me.

832
01:25:22,544 --> 01:25:24,833
- Oh, really?
- He won't.

833
01:25:24,963 --> 01:25:29,506
I can't explain it.
He would consider that rude.

834
01:25:29,634 --> 01:25:33,500
- It's over. She's dead.
- It's not your fault it worked out like this.

835
01:25:33,637 --> 01:25:38,050
The thing is that Lecter said everything
we need to catch him is in these pages.

836
01:25:38,183 --> 01:25:40,673
Dr Lecter said a lot of things.

837
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:43,265
He's here, Ardelia.

838
01:26:11,809 --> 01:26:14,264
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

839
01:26:15,645 --> 01:26:20,141
"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random,

840
01:26:20,274 --> 01:26:24,105
like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Hannibal Lecter."

841
01:26:24,236 --> 01:26:26,940
Desperately random?
What does he mean?

842
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,568
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

843
01:26:31,701 --> 01:26:34,905
But there is no pattern
or the computers would have nailed it.

844
01:26:35,038 --> 01:26:39,664
- They were even found in random order.
- Random because of the one girl.

845
01:26:39,792 --> 01:26:43,789
- The one he weighted down.
- Fredrica Bimmel.

846
01:26:44,129 --> 01:26:47,295
From Belvedere, Ohio.

847
01:26:47,423 --> 01:26:50,377
First girl taken, third body found.

848
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:53,427
- Why?
- She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

849
01:26:53,554 --> 01:26:56,922
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

850
01:26:57,057 --> 01:27:02,217
- Simplicity.
- What does this guy do? He covets.

851
01:27:02,354 --> 01:27:04,892
How do we first start to covet?

852
01:27:05,272 --> 01:27:08,688
- We covet what we see...
- Every day.

853
01:27:10,611 --> 01:27:13,895
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

854
01:27:18,576 --> 01:27:22,276
BELVEDERE, OHIO

855
01:28:29,027 --> 01:28:31,067
- Mr Bimmel?
- That's me.

856
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,812
I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.

857
01:28:38,744 --> 01:28:42,327
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr Bimmel.

858
01:28:42,456 --> 01:28:44,698
I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.

859
01:28:44,834 --> 01:28:48,250
Police been back here
so many times already.

860
01:28:48,379 --> 01:28:52,542
Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

861
01:28:52,675 --> 01:28:56,208
She left the interview OK.
She never come home.

862
01:28:59,097 --> 01:29:01,503
Her bedroom's how she left it.

863
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,260
Upstairs. Door to the left.

864
01:31:50,023 --> 01:31:53,474
He's making himself a "woman suit",
Mr Crawford, out of real women.

865
01:31:53,609 --> 01:31:56,147
He can sew, this guy. He's very skilled.

866
01:31:56,279 --> 01:31:58,651
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker.
- Starling...

867
01:31:58,781 --> 01:32:02,398
That's why they're so big. He has to
keep them alive so he can starve them,

868
01:32:02,534 --> 01:32:06,199
- so that he can loosen their skin.
- Starling, we know who he is.

869
01:32:06,329 --> 01:32:08,405
And where he is.
We're on our way right now.

870
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:11,494
- Where?
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

871
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:14,378
Be on the ground in 45 minutes.

872
01:32:14,504 --> 01:32:16,710
That's great news, sir, but how...

873
01:32:16,839 --> 01:32:20,421
Johns Hopkins came up with some
names. We fed 'em into Known Offenders.

874
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:24,630
Subject's name
is Jamie Gumb, a.k. A John Grant.

875
01:32:24,929 --> 01:32:28,464
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.

876
01:32:28,599 --> 01:32:30,853
Customs had some paper on him.

877
01:32:30,988 --> 01:32:36,527
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX. Live caterpillars from Surinam.

878
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:39,577
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

879
01:32:40,163 --> 01:32:43,034
Chicago's only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in...

880
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:47,579
No, Starling. There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

881
01:32:47,712 --> 01:32:51,756
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl.
See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.

882
01:32:51,882 --> 01:32:54,088
Yes, sir, you bet. I'll do my best.

883
01:32:54,218 --> 01:32:57,883
Starling, we wouldn't
have found him without you.

884
01:32:58,013 --> 01:33:01,512
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

885
01:33:02,893 --> 01:33:06,641
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr Crawford.

886
01:33:07,897 --> 01:33:09,308
Mr Crawford?

887
01:33:21,869 --> 01:33:24,324
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

888
01:33:24,454 --> 01:33:26,909
I got a better idea.

889
01:33:47,767 --> 01:33:50,636
OK, Precious. Time for a little treat.

890
01:34:03,322 --> 01:34:05,361
Precious!

891
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,824
Come on, girl!

892
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:12,456
Come on, Precious.

893
01:34:21,726 --> 01:34:23,599
Come on, Precious!

894
01:34:23,728 --> 01:34:27,975
I got a yummy snack for ya!
Come on. Come and get it.

895
01:34:34,945 --> 01:34:37,103
Precious!

896
01:34:37,239 --> 01:34:39,481
Are you up there, you little shit?

897
01:34:40,533 --> 01:34:43,238
Come and get it, pretty girl.

898
01:34:49,874 --> 01:34:53,540
Precious, please come. Come on.

899
01:35:15,148 --> 01:35:16,691
Would you fuck me?

900
01:35:17,109 --> 01:35:19,350
Come on. Take that bone.

901
01:35:23,948 --> 01:35:25,228
I'd fuck me.

902
01:35:26,075 --> 01:35:28,364
Come on.

903
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:33,370
I'd fuck me hard.

904
01:35:33,499 --> 01:35:35,538
I'd fuck me so hard.

905
01:35:40,213 --> 01:35:41,374
No.

906
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:31,762
AIR NATIONAL GUARD HQ
CHICAGO, IL

907
01:36:42,573 --> 01:36:46,404
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

908
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:48,656
I mean, better places than this?

909
01:36:50,454 --> 01:36:52,742
Sometimes you do.

910
01:36:52,873 --> 01:36:57,285
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

911
01:36:57,419 --> 01:37:01,464
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

912
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:04,376
She thought it was such hot shit.

913
01:37:04,508 --> 01:37:06,964
What did she know? Big dummy.

914
01:37:07,094 --> 01:37:13,049
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

915
01:37:13,851 --> 01:37:16,140
- How about John Grant?
- No.

916
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,105
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know about?

917
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:21,472
If she had a guy,
I'd have known, believe me.

918
01:37:21,607 --> 01:37:25,522
- Sewing was her life.
- Did you two ever work together?

919
01:37:25,653 --> 01:37:30,824
Sure. Me and Pam Malavesi used to help
her do alterations for old Mrs Lippman.

920
01:37:30,961 --> 01:37:34,579
Can you give me Mrs Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

921
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:38,790
CALUMET CITY, IL

922
01:38:02,781 --> 01:38:05,699
So powerful. So beautiful.

923
01:38:11,247 --> 01:38:13,286
Precious?

924
01:38:18,504 --> 01:38:21,788
- Precious?
- She's down here, you sack of shit!

925
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:35,100
- Put her in that bucket.
- Get me a telephone and lower it down.

926
01:38:38,355 --> 01:38:40,680
Poodlie-poo. Precious.

927
01:38:40,816 --> 01:38:45,393
- Darling heart, are you all right?
- She's in a lot of pain. She needs a vet.

928
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:52,693
She broke her leg
on the way down. I know it.

929
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:56,694
- Don't you hurt my dog!
- Don't you make me hurt your dog!

930
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:59,037
You don't know what pain is!

931
01:39:12,523 --> 01:39:16,852
- Oh, fuck!
- You better be gettin' me that telephone!

932
01:39:17,194 --> 01:39:19,648
I'm gonna do it, mister!

933
01:39:23,866 --> 01:39:25,859
All right, mister! I'm doin' it!

934
01:39:49,182 --> 01:39:51,221
OK, I'm coming.

935
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:55,099
We're goin' in.

936
01:39:59,232 --> 01:40:04,025
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for Mrs Lippman's family.

937
01:40:04,696 --> 01:40:07,269
FBI! Everybody down!

938
01:40:07,407 --> 01:40:09,978
No, Lippmans don't live here any more.

939
01:40:10,116 --> 01:40:12,358
Excuse me.
I really need to speak with you.

940
01:40:13,578 --> 01:40:15,321
Clear!

941
01:40:16,164 --> 01:40:18,202
What's the problem, officer?

942
01:40:18,331 --> 01:40:21,083
I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

943
01:40:24,671 --> 01:40:27,126
There's no one here, Jack.

944
01:40:28,716 --> 01:40:29,914
Clarice.

945
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:32,802
- Your name is?
- Jack Gordon.

946
01:40:32,928 --> 01:40:38,088
Mr Gordon. Good. Well, Fredrica used to
work for Mrs Lippman. Did you know her?

947
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,176
No. Uh-uh.

948
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:42,969
Oh, wait.

949
01:40:43,103 --> 01:40:45,261
Was she a great, big, fat person?

950
01:40:46,189 --> 01:40:49,605
- She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I may have...

951
01:40:49,735 --> 01:40:52,237
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

952
01:40:54,209 --> 01:40:56,747
Mrs Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

953
01:40:56,879 --> 01:40:59,831
I got his card here someplace.
Come in while I look for it.

954
01:40:59,964 --> 01:41:02,419
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

955
01:41:21,316 --> 01:41:24,816
Are you close to catchin'
somebody, you think?

956
01:41:24,945 --> 01:41:26,984
Yes. We may be.

957
01:41:29,366 --> 01:41:34,442
Did you take over this place
after Mrs Lippman died, is that right?

958
01:41:36,455 --> 01:41:40,784
Yeah, I bought this house two years ago.

959
01:41:42,002 --> 01:41:45,454
Did she leave any records?
Any business records?

960
01:41:45,589 --> 01:41:48,875
Tax forms? List of employees?

961
01:41:49,884 --> 01:41:52,340
No, nothin' like that at all.

962
01:41:54,305 --> 01:41:57,223
Say, has the FBI learned something?

963
01:41:57,350 --> 01:42:01,182
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

964
01:42:10,278 --> 01:42:16,233
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

965
01:42:16,368 --> 01:42:18,407
No.

966
01:42:19,996 --> 01:42:22,035
No, we don't.

967
01:42:32,727 --> 01:42:35,016
Here's that number.

968
01:42:35,772 --> 01:42:39,472
Very good, Mr Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

969
01:42:47,616 --> 01:42:49,654
Sure, you can use my phone.

970
01:42:51,035 --> 01:42:54,155
Freeze! Put your hands over your head.

971
01:42:54,788 --> 01:42:57,907
And turn around. Spread your legs.

972
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:01,583
Spread your legs.
Put your hands in the back. Thumbs up.

973
01:43:01,711 --> 01:43:03,751
Freeze!

974
01:44:37,852 --> 01:44:40,472
Hello? Are you there?

975
01:44:41,562 --> 01:44:44,018
I'm down here!

976
01:45:03,832 --> 01:45:06,502
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!

977
01:45:08,754 --> 01:45:11,589
FBI. You're safe.

978
01:45:11,715 --> 01:45:14,170
Safe, shit! Get me outta here!

979
01:45:29,898 --> 01:45:33,231
- You're all right. Where is he?
- How the fuck should I know?

980
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:37,488
- Just get me outta here!
- You gotta be quiet. Shut that dog up.

981
01:45:38,406 --> 01:45:40,482
Just get me outta here!

982
01:45:41,534 --> 01:45:43,573
Oh, my God.

983
01:45:45,245 --> 01:45:49,408
Catherine, I'm gonna get you outta there,
but right now you listen to me.

984
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:51,794
I've gotta leave this room. Be right back.

985
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:55,760
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fuckin' bitch!

986
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:59,758
Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fuckin' crazy!

987
01:46:02,813 --> 01:46:04,687
Please!

988
01:46:04,815 --> 01:46:07,602
I gotta get outta here!

989
01:46:10,196 --> 01:46:14,941
Catherine, the other officers'll
be here any minute now.

990
01:46:15,075 --> 01:46:19,025
Wait! Don't go! Please!

991
01:46:19,163 --> 01:46:20,407
Quiet!

992
01:50:21,279 --> 01:50:24,363
- You OK?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm OK.

993
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:26,779
How did you track Buffalo Bill here?

994
01:50:33,164 --> 01:50:35,204
Clarice M Starling.

995
01:50:38,044 --> 01:50:40,084
Congratulations.

996
01:51:13,631 --> 01:51:15,836
Special Agent Starling.

997
01:51:15,966 --> 01:51:18,587
- Special Agent Mapp.
- Phone call.

998
01:51:18,718 --> 01:51:20,758
- Excuse me.
- Starling.

999
01:51:23,722 --> 01:51:26,178
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1000
01:51:26,308 --> 01:51:28,348
Yeah. Sure.

1001
01:51:29,269 --> 01:51:32,305
Look, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

1002
01:51:32,438 --> 01:51:36,139
I'm not much good at this kinda thing,
so I'm gonna duck outta here.

1003
01:51:36,275 --> 01:51:38,315
OK. Sure.

1004
01:51:39,278 --> 01:51:41,733
Thank you, Mr Crawford.

1005
01:51:49,036 --> 01:51:52,239
Your father would have been proud today.

1006
01:51:54,416 --> 01:51:56,871
Don't forget your phone call.

1007
01:52:00,922 --> 01:52:04,006
- Starling.
- Well, Clarice?

1008
01:52:04,592 --> 01:52:07,047
Have the lambs stopped screaming?

1009
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:09,842
- Dr Lecter.
- Don't bother with the trace.

1010
01:52:09,972 --> 01:52:11,846
I won't be on long enough.

1011
01:52:15,435 --> 01:52:19,646
- Where are you, Dr Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1012
01:52:19,773 --> 01:52:22,725
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1013
01:52:22,858 --> 01:52:25,894
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

1014
01:52:26,028 --> 01:52:28,483
You know I can't make that promise.

1015
01:52:28,947 --> 01:52:31,330
I do wish we could chat longer but...

1016
01:52:32,754 --> 01:52:35,624
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1017
01:52:36,841 --> 01:52:39,379
- Bye.
- Dr Lecter?

1018
01:52:42,388 --> 01:52:44,428
Dr Lecter?

1019
01:52:52,314 --> 01:52:55,268
Excuse me. You got
the security system all set up?

1020
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:59,611
- We have the big-shot security.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
