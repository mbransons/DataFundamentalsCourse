1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,186
There'll be none of that. No trays.

3
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,566
<i>The Star-Telegram has you quoted
quite definitely:...</i>

4
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,867
..."Before departing by plane
for New York, Mr. Cheyne stated...

5
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:47,032
...that the new equipment is to be
provided by the present bond issue".

6
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,856
The other papers have virtually the same.

7
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,931
What does the confidential bulletin say?

8
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,181
"Tuesday morning. Paris wires...

9
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,900
...the President will probably sign
the Bannerman Mining Bill today".

10
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:56,146
Van Wyck's London cable says:...

11
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:58,104
..."Conservatives will support
the new air program".

12
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:01,232
Tokyo: "Mr. Gordon's condition
excellent. Appendix had not burst.

13
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:04,683
"Our property loss in our tuna-factory fire
will amount to not more than $15,000".

14
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,446
8:45, Mr. Cheyne.

15
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:11,535
- Our guests still asleep?
- Yes, sir.

16
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,487
Reynolds will drive them
out to Connecticut at 11:00, sir.

17
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,306
- Well, let them sleep an hour more.
- Very good, sir.

18
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,748
- Will you be dining at home tonight?
- I don't know.

19
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:19,180
- You can call me at the office.
- Very good, sir.

20
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:22,440
Burns, give this to my son. Have him
call me at the office on a private wire.

21
00:02:22,507 --> 00:02:24,067
Very well, sir.

22
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:28,102
Shall I waken them now, Mr. Burns?

23
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:30,752
No, Mr. Cheyne wants the dear things
to sleep an hour longer.

24
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:32,545
They can never wake up,
as far as I'm concerned.

25
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,111
Yes, Master Harvey?

26
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,184
Well, Burns said that...

27
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:41,849
Oh, here he is now.

28
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:43,834
Yes?

29
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:48,374
Your breakfast will be ready
in the dining room, Master Harvey.

30
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,523
Yes, but...

31
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:50,579
But...

32
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:52,376
Oh, very well.

33
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:55,922
It wants its breakfast in its rooms.
Prepare the tray.

34
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,990
Why can't I go downstairs
and eat my breakfast if I'm hungry?

35
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,909
Is that the way you act
in people's houses?

36
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,394
In people's houses,
they let you eat when you're hungry.

37
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,410
Well, you're my guest,
and you'll do as I say.

38
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:08,752
Besides, I bet you never had
breakfast in bed.

39
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,298
My mother has it, but it's sissy for
a fellow to have it, unless he's sick.

40
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:13,994
Who are you calling a sissy?

41
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:15,492
I'll take care of it.

42
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:16,973
Did you say I was a sissy?

43
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,004
I said some people might think
eating off of trays was sissy.

44
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:22,051
Well, let's get something to eat anyway,
huh, Harvey?

45
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:23,367
You heard me order it.

46
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:25,376
Go ahead, Charles. It'll be in your room.

47
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:26,944
You want to have some breakfast,
don't you?

48
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:28,130
Yes.

49
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:29,574
I like to eat the way people eat.

50
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,720
Will mine be in my room?

51
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,278
Sure. Think we only got one servant?

52
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,171
Wait a minute, Pogey.

53
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:37,146
Why do you want to go around
making him mad for?

54
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,364
What if he is?

55
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,507
You just can't remember one single thing.

56
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:42,039
Getting my father to get his father...

57
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:44,185
...to make him spend the Easter with us
was a plot, wasn't it?

58
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,630
- Yes.
- Come in.

59
00:03:45,696 --> 00:03:47,997
Well, then, what do you want to go around
spoiling plots for?

60
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:51,377
I just wanted to make him feel
he owed you something.

61
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,868
- Could you get coffee if you wanted it?
- Sure. I just don't like it.

62
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,458
- Do you want some?
- No, I like cocoa.

63
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:03,285
Your father instructed me
to give you this.

64
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,357
- What for?
- He didn't confide in me.

65
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,371
You're to telephone him, if you get up.

66
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:10,193
- Is there anything more you wish?
- Yes. You can fill my bath for me.

67
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,371
With pleasure.

68
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,195
We thought you were in bed.

69
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,501
No, and I'm going to eat mine
on that desk.

70
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,901
- Are you sorry Easter's over?
- I don't know.

71
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,690
Haven't you been having a lot of fun?

72
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:20,772
I guess so.

73
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:22,700
You're the one that's from Providence,
aren't you?

74
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:23,746
Uh-huh.

75
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:27,166
Why, I'd think a boy from Providence'd
be very happy to make a trip to New York.

76
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:28,867
I'm from way out in Indiana.

77
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:29,918
All right.

78
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:33,406
I've got a little brother that I bet'd be
happy to have all the luxuries you've had.

79
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,266
He can have my room.

80
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,760
Hello. Hello, Father?

81
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,832
Just a moment.
I'll see if your father's in.

82
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,202
Morning, Son. What?

83
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:52,537
I'm going back to school now.

84
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,521
Yes, sir. $40.

85
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:57,332
That's it. I thought you might
have to stop for lunch somewhere...

86
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:59,409
...before you get back to school.
You can treat the boys.

87
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:01,303
Have a good time, Son.
See you in June. Goodbye.

88
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:03,409
Goodbye, Father.

89
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:06,771
He's a wonderful boy.

90
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,527
He was 5 here.

91
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:10,698
I wish his mother had lived
to see him now.

92
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:13,225
10 years old and yet he's one
of the editors of his school paper.

93
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:14,410
Think of that.

94
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:18,188
Now, watch.

95
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:19,848
Sit up, Conrad.

96
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,859
Do you hear me? Sit up!

97
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,654
Sit up! Move.

98
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:26,886
<i>This isn't the way
my Treasure Island looks.</i>

99
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:30,498
<i>It's the very first way
anybody ever saw Treasure Island.</i>

100
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,153
Gee, it's very valuable, huh?

101
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,711
Sure. Would you like to have it?

102
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:38,268
- It belongs to your father.
- It does not.

103
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:40,924
My father gave it to me
so as I could have it when I grow up.

104
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:43,416
- You take it as a present, Charles.
- You're going now.

105
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,831
Gee whiz!

106
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,486
I'm glad you like the book, Charles.

107
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,859
Look, Harvey,
maybe I oughtn't to take it.

108
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,169
That's all right.

109
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:56,123
That's just an act of friendship.

110
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,798
Sometime, maybe, you'll want to do
an act of friendship for us.

111
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,011
What?

112
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,920
Oh, maybe we might like
to join the Buffaloes.

113
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:05,900
You're the president of the Buffaloes,
aren't you?

114
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:08,527
Yeah, but there's 15 other fellows
in the club.

115
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:11,891
Yeah, but when you get together
in Mr. Tyler's room...

116
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:13,514
...and toast marshmallows and things...

117
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,724
...you talk about who you're going
to let in, don't you?

118
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,702
I'm not allowed to tell what we do.

119
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:19,979
That's all you do.
You sit around Mr. Tyler's fireplace...

120
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,053
...and talk about camping
and things like that.

121
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:24,264
Well, do you want to do
an act of friendship?

122
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,917
What if the others don't want you in?

123
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:28,709
Now look here, Charles...

124
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,600
...you like being the president,
don't you?

125
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,250
Certainly I do. It's an office of honor.

126
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,977
And what if you weren't
the president anymore?

127
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:37,534
- You can't do anything about it.
- Oh, yes, I can.

128
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,165
What if you weren't
at the school anymore?

129
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:40,284
I'm going to be at the school.

130
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:42,657
Harvey could buy the school
and shut it up. Couldn't you, Harvey?

131
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:44,926
No. That isn't what would happen.

132
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:48,440
Your father sells my father's automobiles
in Providence, doesn't he?

133
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:49,495
Yes.

134
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:51,422
Well, then, do you think he'd like it
if you had a chance...

135
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,875
...to do me an act of friendship
and didn't do it?

136
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,956
What if he woke up one day,
and my father took away...

137
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,810
...all the automobiles he let him
have to sell and said:...

138
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,434
..."You're fired".

139
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:03,055
You know how many people
are out of jobs?

140
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:04,503
Millions of people.

141
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:06,706
And they're all hungry and in rags.

142
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,911
They can't send their sons to school.

143
00:07:08,982 --> 00:07:10,094
You're not old enough to work...

144
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,848
...so you'd have to go out
with your mother and father and beg.

145
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,257
And that certainly would be awful...

146
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:17,136
...to have your mother sitting there,
all dressed up in rags...

147
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:19,437
...and eating rotten bread
and things like that.

148
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,195
Wouldn't that be terrible?

149
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,051
Your father can't do that.

150
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,484
Now look, Charles,
I don't want him to do it.

151
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:28,581
I just say I don't want him
to have to do it.

152
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:30,657
I know they won't let you in.

153
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:32,833
Monsieur Gattard will continue with...

154
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:35,075
...second and third form French
on Thursdays...

155
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:37,761
...which will replace Dr. Spitzer's
science section...

156
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:39,423
...moved up to Friday afternoon.

157
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:42,526
That will give Dr. Spitzer
more time for golf.

158
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,253
- Thank you.
- That covers everything, gentlemen.

159
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:47,638
We'll reconvene at tomorrow night's
regular faculty meeting.

160
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,652
- Oh, Mr. Tyler.
- Yes, sir?

161
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,173
Harrison's doctor feels he needs
another month's rest.

162
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:56,125
Could you possibly take over
first form Latin?

163
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:57,334
Oh, I think so.

164
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:00,370
I thought you might like what added
salary the extra work would bring.

165
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:01,849
Well, that's very kind of you,
Dr. Finley.

166
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,728
Did you get straightened away from
last winter's difficulties all right?

167
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:06,930
Yes, and now that
you've brought that up...

168
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,933
- I don't know quite how to thank you...
- Oh, don't mention it, Bob.

169
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:11,696
This ought to make things easier
from now on.

170
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:13,837
- Yes, sir. And thank you very much, sir.
- Glad to do it, Bob.

171
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:19,850
Hello, Charles. What's the matter?

172
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,468
Can Harvey Cheyne make his father
do anything he wants?

173
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,070
I don't think so. Why?

174
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:26,629
He says if we don't let him
and Pogey Williams and Alvin Savage...

175
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:27,878
...join the Buffaloes...

176
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:29,638
- I'll have to leave school.
- What?

177
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,162
I don't know what to do with this.
He gave it to me.

178
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:35,201
It's awful valuable,
and he won't take it back.

179
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:37,126
He gave you this?

180
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:38,914
He says if he doesn't get
in the Buffaloes...

181
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,796
...he'll get his father to take away
my father's automobile business.

182
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:43,388
Well, that's absurd, Charles.

183
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,434
Well, he wanted to be
on the school paper...

184
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,874
...and he got his father to give
a new printing press, didn't he?

185
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:49,629
So they had to let him on, didn't they?

186
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:51,868
- He's always...
- Come in here, Charles. Come in here.

187
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:11,601
Come on. We've got to set type up now.

188
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,808
- There isn't room for any more.
- What did he write?

189
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:16,080
- It's about his vacation.
- I want more than this in.

190
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,424
There isn't room for any more.

191
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,377
If you wanted more,
you ought to write it sooner.

192
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,751
Give it here.

193
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,720
Hey, give that here!
I want to write some more.

194
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:26,246
We told Mr. Tyler
he could read proof at 5:00.

195
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:29,448
I don't care. You treat me
like I wasn't one of the editors here.

196
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,109
Oh, you used "like" as a conjunction.

197
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,186
- I did not.
- Oh, yes, you did.

198
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,167
That makes 10 cents more
you owe to the dunce box.

199
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,662
Yeah, and you still haven't paid up
for saying "either, or"...

200
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:40,037
...instead of "neither, nor"
down at the dining hall this noon.

201
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:41,412
I did not...

202
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:43,557
Come on.
You're awful slow with that proof.

203
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,108
- It's not ready yet, Mr. Tyler.
- Yes, so I assume.

204
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,423
You have half an hour.

205
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,879
Come here, Harvey.
I want to talk with you.

206
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,183
It's their fault it's late.
They wouldn't let me...

207
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:55,898
<i>Harvey, I put that first edition
of Treasure Island in your room.</i>

208
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,982
Oh, you did? Thanks.

209
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,388
It was a nice gift, but Charles
didn't think he ought to take...

210
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:01,689
...such an expensive present,
and I'm inclined to agree with him.

211
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:03,828
Oh, that's all right.
I want him to have it.

212
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:05,076
Why, Harvey?

213
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:06,355
Well, it's...

214
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:08,622
We don't need it. We've got lots of them.

215
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:11,280
Harvey, you know
that's a silly answer, old man.

216
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:14,164
- Well, it was an act of friendship.
- You mean a bribe, don't you?

217
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,400
- What's a bribe?
- A bribe's a dishonest gift.

218
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:19,598
A person who accepts it knows that
he must do something dishonest in return.

219
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,040
Be honest, Harvey.

220
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:23,560
All I wanted was to belong
to the Buffaloes.

221
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,631
Look, people give presents after
someone's been nice to them, don't they?

222
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:29,669
So what's dishonest with giving presents
before someone's nice to you?

223
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:31,748
Harvey, why do you think
you don't belong to the Buffaloes?

224
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:33,097
'Cause Charles don't want me in.

225
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,551
It isn't Charles that kept you out.
I kept you out.

226
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,632
What? You said you were a friend of mine.

227
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,071
I am, but sometimes
we have to do things for friends...

228
00:10:40,136 --> 00:10:42,502
...that we don't particularly like to do.

229
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,580
Harvey...

230
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:46,402
...do you remember me saying it hadn't
been wise for you to tell the boys...

231
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:49,119
...that you ought to be a member simply
because your father was so important?

232
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:50,136
Yes.

233
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,119
And I said the way to get in
was for you to be important...

234
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,142
...to stand on your own feet...

235
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,907
...not depend on your father
for everything you want.

236
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:56,634
My father gives me everything I want.

237
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:58,459
Did you talk this over
with your father, Harvey?

238
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,664
No. He's got more important things to do.

239
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,293
He's anxious for your happiness,
isn't he?

240
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:03,542
Sure.

241
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:05,815
- I'm perfectly happy.
- Oh, no, Harvey, you're not...

242
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:07,889
...because you know
you've been dishonest.

243
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:09,935
- Well, so were you dishonest.
- Now, Harvey.

244
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:11,469
Well, you took a bribe.

245
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:12,623
What are you talking about?

246
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,101
Didn't you find some money
in your room...

247
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,856
...a couple of days
before Christmas vacation...

248
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,291
- ...lying on your table in an envelope?
- What?

249
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:20,330
Yes. Only it wasn't a bribe.
It was a present...

250
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:22,028
...because I thought
you were a friend of mine.

251
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,072
- Did you put that $50 there?
- Yes.

252
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:25,900
I was going to tell you it was from me.

253
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,942
I thought maybe you'd make
the history exam easier.

254
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:31,210
You went to the dentist and came back
late, and I didn't get a chance to tell you.

255
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:33,218
- I had no idea it was from you.
- You kept it, though.

256
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,949
It'll be returned, Harvey.

257
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:37,919
I'm afraid you need a little
sterner lesson than I can give you.

258
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:38,975
What are you going to do?

259
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:42,244
I'm going to talk it over with Dr. Finley
and see what he thinks ought to be done.

260
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:43,359
You hate me.

261
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,132
- Where's Coventry?
- It isn't a place.

262
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,887
It means he can't talk to anybody,
and you can't talk to him.

263
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:51,864
You just have to pretend
he doesn't exist.

264
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:54,719
And if he tries to talk to you,
you have to report it to a master.

265
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,214
What did he do?

266
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,872
I don't know. He's a fresh kid.
That's all.

267
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:00,982
"Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere

268
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,225
Take thou there from my brand, Excalibur

269
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:05,299
And fling him far into the middle mere

270
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:07,737
Watch what thou seest
and lightly bring me word

271
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:10,190
To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere"

272
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:14,293
- Well, what did Sir Bedivere say?
- That's all I was supposed to commit, sir.

273
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,787
Ten lines.

274
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:19,540
Does anybody know what Sir Bedivere
replied? We'll have to find out tomorrow.

275
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:20,912
I know what he said, sir.

276
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,840
Persons in Coventry do not speak
after a class is dismissed.

277
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,041
Kind of funny about Eddie
stopping where he did.

278
00:12:35,116 --> 00:12:36,522
Yes. Yes, it was.

279
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,727
I guess I got a right to look at it,
haven't I?

280
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,929
The only reason you got your old paper
was 'cause I got it for you.

281
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:05,523
You make me sick.

282
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:07,450
Punching somebody
isn't speaking to him, is it?

283
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:08,693
No.

284
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:14,449
All you got to do is say
he tried to break Coventry with you.

285
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:19,022
Takes some people an awful long time
to learn something.

286
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:49,890
- It'll only cost $10 if you want to go back.
- I'm never going back.

287
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:57,561
- Why, Son. What's happened?
- I just got here.

288
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,542
I'm all right, I guess.

289
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:04,281
- What's the matter with your leg?
- Oh, it's all right, I just sprained it a little.

290
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:06,099
Here, here. Sit down.

291
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:11,638
<i>- Yes, Mr. Cheyne?
- Ask Dr. Walsh to come in.</i>

292
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:13,908
Oh, I don't need a doctor, Father.

293
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:16,461
- What's all this? Tar?
- It's ink from the printing press.

294
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:18,869
A little of it got on me. I left school.

295
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:21,424
Dick, I wish you'd see
if this boy of mine is all right.

296
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:25,070
- Well, well, son. Been in a fight?
- I fell down trying to escape.

297
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,640
Take a look at that right leg.

298
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:30,282
- What do you mean trying to escape?
- It doesn't hurt now.

299
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:33,326
- Can you walk on it?
- Yes, sir.

300
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:36,643
It was just a lingament or something.

301
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:38,149
I think you'll pull through.

302
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,520
- What happened to him?
- I'm trying to find out.

303
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:41,961
Why do you say you escaped, Harvey?

304
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:44,840
Because they had me prisoner
at the school. Nobody could talk to me.

305
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:47,238
- I guess they were scared I would talk.
- Who was scared?

306
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,710
That old Tyler and all of them.

307
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:50,683
- Who's old Tyler?
- He's a master.

308
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:52,895
He kept me out of the Buffaloes
and took a bribe.

309
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:55,167
- What bribe?
- I gave him $50 at Christmas...

310
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,576
...to make the history exam easier.

311
00:14:56,643 --> 00:14:58,649
And yesterday
I found out he wasn't a friend of mine.

312
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:01,622
- He fixed it so as I couldn't tell anyone.
- Let me get this straight, Son.

313
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:03,484
Do you mean to say
that a teacher let you give him $50?

314
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:04,925
- Yes.
- And then locked you up...

315
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,364
...because you threatened
to tell about it?

316
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,567
Yes, in the basement.
I had to fight my way out.

317
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:11,090
- Good heavens, what school is this?
- Green Hill, Connecticut.

318
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:13,071
- Does Dr. Finley know about this?
- Sure he does.

319
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,520
He's trying to keep it quiet, too.

320
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:17,333
He's scared
because you gave so much to the school.

321
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,925
It's very important that Dr. Finley
be at my house this evening.

322
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,356
- I also want to see that teacher, Tyler.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,841
Maybe you oughtn't have anything at all
to do with them, Father.

324
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,192
You just let me handle this, Son.

325
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,040
I bet they make up
some awful lies about it.

326
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:33,195
I must point out the extraordinary sums
of money that he's had at his disposal.

327
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:35,332
Very large sums for a small boy.

328
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:37,128
Well, the boy was confused...

329
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,750
...bewildered, almost terrified
when he came into my office.

330
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:42,819
Your mere assertion that I give him
overlarge sums of spending money...

331
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,224
...in no way seems to justify
the severe treatment...

332
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,750
...to which he's obviously
been subjected.

333
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:50,783
Mr. Cheyne, Harvey's "severe treatment"
came from no member of the faculty.

334
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:54,946
I've told you of his attempt to bribe
Mr. Tyler. Here's the $50, by the way.

335
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:57,313
Behind that lies a long list
of infractions...

336
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:00,760
...based on his attitude that he's
a special, privileged character.

337
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:04,823
His attempt to resist the normal, healthy
discipline of being put into Coventry...

338
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:06,869
...brought no further discipline from us.

339
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:10,683
But it did bring him a solid bash
on the nose from one of his fellows.

340
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:14,324
It was a blow, I am sorry to say,
that any one of the other 120 boys...

341
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:17,262
...in the school
would have been glad to deliver.

342
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:18,350
Oh.

343
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:22,668
Well, in that case...

344
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:26,801
- ...have some coffee, Dr. Finley.
- Thanks.

345
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:30,346
Now, tell me.
This bash on the nose came from a Bison?

346
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:33,829
- A Buffalo. Wellman is a Buffalo, isn't he?
- Yes, sir.

347
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:38,371
Perhaps you will accept
some coffee, too, Mr. Tyler.

348
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:39,689
Thank you, sir.

349
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,892
Really, Mr. Cheyne,
Harvey is great material.

350
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:43,556
He's simply been misdirected, that's all.

351
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,854
Smart. Why he has a mind
as fine as any in the school.

352
00:16:46,953 --> 00:16:48,359
Well, he certainly fooled me.

353
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,554
It seems that I have begotten
a sort of junior Machiavelli.

354
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:53,957
Perhaps it's not my place to say this,
Mr. Cheyne...

355
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,802
...but it's simply because you and he
have never had any relationship.

356
00:16:56,868 --> 00:17:00,183
To him, you're just a machine pouring out
money, a machine he's trying to imitate.

357
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:03,421
If you take time out from being a tycoon
in big business and spend more time...

358
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,081
...getting to know your own son,
you'll realize...

359
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:07,900
I'm sure Mr. Cheyne realizes that
very clearly now.

360
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,858
I can see that the school would do with
a little more cooperation with me, yes.

361
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,077
But you gentlemen must realize...

362
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:16,049
...that besides being
both father and mother to Harvey...

363
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,325
...I'm tied up in my own work...

364
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,621
...in matters that also relate
to his future welfare.

365
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:24,497
I suppose what you want from me,
Dr. Finley...

366
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,539
...is permission to deal as drastically
with Harvey...

367
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,172
...as his future conduct might deserve.

368
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:31,658
I'm afraid we'll have to leave that
in your hands for a while, Mr. Cheyne.

369
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,176
For the rest of the spring term at least,
Harvey will have to be rusticated.

370
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:36,328
Rusticated?

371
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:39,848
"Temporarily canned,"
I believe the boys call it.

372
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:43,971
Well, that is news. And here I'm trying
to put you on the carpet.

373
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:45,221
It seems a bit thick...

374
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,875
...after the printing press
and all your other generosities...

375
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:51,239
...but for that very reason,
for the effect on the other boys.

376
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:54,181
Oh, I understand perfectly, Doctor.
You've no other course.

377
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,612
Well, Bob, if we're going to catch
that train, we must be off.

378
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:57,757
Goodbye, Mr. Cheyne.

379
00:17:57,829 --> 00:17:59,715
I'm sure that when Harvey comes back
in the fall...

380
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,233
...he will be a boy
that we can all be proud of.

381
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:04,894
Well, good luck.

382
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:08,409
My young Mr. Tyler is pretty intense,
but he's quite right.

383
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:11,445
You're rather a nice fellow for a...
What did he call you?

384
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:12,727
- A tycoon.
- Oh, yes.

385
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:14,900
Well, you're rather a nice fellow
for a tycoon.

386
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:17,458
So take the boy in with you
for the next few months, will you?

387
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,074
You won't mind the extra work. If
you give him a chance to live up to you...

388
00:18:21,144 --> 00:18:24,558
we're liable to have
another splendid citizen on our hands.

389
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:27,050
- Good night.
- Good night, Doctor. Thank you.

390
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:49,795
Harvey.

391
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,545
Don't, Mr. Tyler, please don't. Don't.

392
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,016
Two hours ago, you might have gotten
away with that very nicely, Harvey.

393
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:06,812
From now on, it doesn't go.

394
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:10,420
That's all we'll have to say tonight,
Son.

395
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:24,972
- Elliot, I am going to be a father again.
- Good heavens, Mr. Cheyne.

396
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,834
No, no, no, Elliot.

397
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:29,551
No, it's just that it seems
that smart little boys...

398
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:32,521
...from so-called wealthy,
well-bred parents...

399
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,958
...don't grow up very successfully
by themselves.

400
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:37,894
- Lf you're speaking of Harvey, sir...
- Yes, I am.

401
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:41,964
<i>- Did you get passage for next week?
- Yes, the Queen Anne on the 7th.</i>

402
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,389
You wanted to go over
the London corporation papers...

403
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:45,670
- ...before you retire.
- Yeah.

404
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,495
Well, get a larger suite.
Harvey's going with us.

405
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,221
It seems that he's been...

406
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,354
- ...rusticated.
- Oh, I am sorry, sir.

407
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,845
Will you be taking a tutor
along with him?

408
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:56,837
So how the deuce did you know
what that meant?

409
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:59,290
Frankly, I jumped
at an obvious conclusion.

410
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,211
Well, you're smarter than I was, Elliot.

411
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:05,535
No, no tutors.
I've got to get closer to that boy.

412
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:09,111
I'm darned if I know just where to begin.

413
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,209
Poor kid, maybe it's all my fault.
I don't know.

414
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:14,739
Oh, well.

415
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:17,874
I'll make it somehow.

416
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,233
If the radio tells them where
every ship is, why do they have to...

417
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:28,084
- Radiogram, Mr. Cheyne.
- Oh, thanks. What, Harvey?

418
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,353
I said, if the radio tells them
where all the ships are...

419
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:33,453
...why do they have to keep on blowing
that old foghorn all the time for?

420
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,173
We're off the Grand Banks now.
A lot of small fishing boats out there.

421
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:39,055
Too small for a radio.
They don't want to hit any of them.

422
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:41,869
I bet this boat
could go right through one of them.

423
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,256
Why do they have to come so far out
from land to fish for?

424
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:49,026
This is where they get all the codfish
and halibut off these banks.

425
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:51,683
Those boys wouldn't believe
you own this boat.

426
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:54,086
I don't, Harvey. I am just one
of the directors of the line.

427
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,355
Well, you're the chairman,
so that's the boss, isn't it?

428
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,040
Look, Son, why don't you have
some fun with these kids for a while?

429
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,833
I've got a radio to send and then...

430
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:04,958
...well, later on I'll pick you up, and
we'll go up on the Captain's bridge, huh?

431
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:06,842
Hear that?

432
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:08,473
My father's taking me
up to see the Captain...

433
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:10,845
...when he gives him some orders,
later on.

434
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:12,699
- Oh, bushwah.
- I'll play you both.

435
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,425
Can't you see we're already playing?

436
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:16,532
All right, then,
I think I'll get an ice-cream soda.

437
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,644
You can't.
The soda fountain doesn't open till noon.

438
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:20,951
Oh, no? We'll see about that.

439
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,025
Hey, Purser. Hey, you, come here.

440
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,382
Well, are you
the three important customers?

441
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:27,884
Yes. Have you any money?

442
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:30,063
- I've got a dime.
- That's not enough.

443
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:32,948
We'll have three chocolate
ice-cream sodas. Make them big ones.

444
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:35,248
You know we're not supposed
to open till noon, don't you?

445
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:36,875
You've got nothing else to do.

446
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,312
Oh, of course, you'd know all about that.

447
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:42,222
I know everything about this ship.
I've been all over it.

448
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:44,839
- Meet with your approval?
- It's all right.

449
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,243
Crew would be glad to know that.

450
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,427
All right, drink them up, boys,
and don't take all day, huh?

451
00:21:55,496 --> 00:21:57,154
There's no hurry.
We're going to have another.

452
00:21:57,224 --> 00:21:59,394
- This will be enough for me.
- Me, too.

453
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:02,047
What's the matter with you?
I could have five or six of these.

454
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:04,985
- Yes, you could.
- You bet I can. Make another.

455
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,025
But I'll be glad to make them for you,
even though I know you can't.

456
00:22:08,098 --> 00:22:09,853
Yeah, I'll show you.

457
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:24,980
There. You didn't think I could do it,
did you?

458
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:27,568
That's fine, you certainly surprised me.

459
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,835
I think I'll go meet my father now.

460
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,872
That's a boy,
and go and eat a great big lunch now.

461
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,816
Look, he's getting sick.
He's gonna be sick.

462
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:44,713
- Uh-oh. I hadn't counted on that.
- I am not. I feel fine.

463
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,361
I can go and meet my father if I want to,
can't I?

464
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,671
Come on, I'll bet you anything.

465
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:58,369
Which way is it to the deck?
How do I get outdoors?

466
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,868
First to your right.

467
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:02,463
There he goes, come on.

468
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,706
He came out here.

469
00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:15,227
Hey, Harvey!

470
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:37,007
You try run Manuel down, huh?

471
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,049
You big killer whale with smoke spout.

472
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:41,903
You try swallow Manuel
like he little smelt, huh?

473
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:49,832
That's all you ever got to say.

474
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,594
<i>On the Isle of Fishamingo</i>

475
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,112
<i>Lived a chief called Bingo-Bingo</i>

476
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:00,159
What's this?

477
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:15,676
That whale she have calf, huh?
Little bull calf, too.

478
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:17,561
All full of ocean inside.

479
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,862
Here. Here, come on now.

480
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:24,086
I pull you out of ocean, now you give
some of that ocean back. Come on now.

481
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:25,300
Give back.

482
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:27,800
Come on, give back.

483
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:34,892
Fifteen years I've been fisherman.
First time I ever catch a fish like you.

484
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:48,266
Hey! Aboard the vessel!

485
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:49,382
Hey.

486
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:51,624
I bring you new kind of fish.

487
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:53,129
What'd you get?

488
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,132
I've got new kind of fish.

489
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,321
He got no tail.
He got pants on his dorsal fin.

490
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:04,836
- I think maybe he about 10 year old.
- Oh, it's a kid, ain't it?

491
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:06,427
Go on, tend your bell.

492
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,769
- But, Dad...
- You know better than leave your watch...

493
00:25:08,836 --> 00:25:11,355
...especially in the fog.
Go on, tend your bell.

494
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,275
Lend a hand here, Olley!

495
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:16,601
I pump him out a little bit.

496
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,293
I guess maybe he need more pumping yet,
I think, huh?

497
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,820
Get a buoy-keg.

498
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:23,355
Roll him.

499
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:26,421
He must have fell off that liner.

500
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:30,198
Sure. He no like that big foolish...
He come visit Manuel.

501
00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:33,269
He got more salt water in him, ain't he?

502
00:25:50,222 --> 00:25:51,204
Where...

503
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:56,938
- Where is this?
- Oh, you's awake?

504
00:25:57,675 --> 00:25:59,648
How's you feeling, boy?

505
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:01,855
I...

506
00:26:02,152 --> 00:26:03,842
I fell, didn't I?

507
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:08,475
- Did you pull me out of the water?
- No, Manuel, he fished you aboard.

508
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,553
Who are you?

509
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,506
I's Doc. I's the cook.
How does your throat feel?

510
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,511
- Awful.
- Always do.

511
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:18,300
Take some of this and you'll feel better.

512
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:21,337
Oh, that's worse.

513
00:26:22,686 --> 00:26:24,954
- What smells so bad?
- Smells?

514
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:27,606
Ain't nothing smells bad around here.

515
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:30,903
Oh, you means the fish.
But they ain't got no smell.

516
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,824
Them's nice, clean salt fish.

517
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,886
70 quintals already done salted down
in that forehold.

518
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:39,979
Is this the bottom of the ship?
Well, where's my father?

519
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:42,989
Was your pappy overboard with you, too?

520
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:47,111
- Oh, this is some other boat.
- That's it. We done picked you up.

521
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:50,317
Oh, where are my shoes?
I've got to see the Captain.

522
00:26:50,447 --> 00:26:51,756
Back here.

523
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:57,057
Here you is.

524
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:00,965
You reckon you're pert enough
to hop on deck?

525
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,454
You find the Captain
and tell him to come down here.

526
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:05,862
I reckon you're lucky
he didn't hear you say that.

527
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:08,413
- Where are my clothes?
- Here they is and they ain't dry.

528
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:10,340
- Boy, you...
- Where is the Captain?

529
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:11,899
Up on deck.

530
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:15,514
You sure is a tonic to yourself.

531
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:21,750
How do you do, son?
So you slipped from your mooring.

532
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,611
Going to stay with us awhile.

533
00:27:23,678 --> 00:27:25,782
You look like a spring herring now...

534
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,470
...but you're going to fatten up
before the fall.

535
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,637
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where's the Captain?

536
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:33,112
Aft.

537
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:46,800
- How do I get to the Captain?
- You got to him.

538
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:50,408
- Well, how are you feeling, sonny?
- You mean you're the Captain of this boat?

539
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,202
That's the general opinion.

540
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:54,308
How long would it take you
to get to Europe?

541
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,130
Well, I don't know, sonny.
I never tried to sail there.

542
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:59,683
But I want you to take me there.
I've got to meet my father.

543
00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:02,950
Well, that's a pity,
because I'm afraid it can't be done.

544
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,641
All right, then, take me to New York.

545
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:07,166
I don't think you understand, sonny.

546
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:09,507
We're working off the Grand Banks.

547
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,319
This schooner
is from Gloucester, Massachusetts.

548
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:14,721
We'll take you there
when we're through fishing.

549
00:28:14,788 --> 00:28:16,445
I don't want to go to Gloucester.

550
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:18,685
You don't? Well, now.

551
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:21,785
- Is he the Captain?
- We let him think he is.

552
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:25,595
- Maybe he'd like to be captain, Dad.
- Oh, I don't know, Dan-o.

553
00:28:25,758 --> 00:28:29,815
I know you want to get home, son,
but we're out here to catch fish.

554
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,255
We ain't going to leave here till we catch
enough to fill the fore and after hold.

555
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:37,621
Say, look,
my father is Frank Burton Cheyne.

556
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:40,492
Don't you believe me?

557
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:43,215
I don't doubt
you know your own daddy's name.

558
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:46,446
But we'll pay you if you take me to him.
Don't you want to make some money?

559
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:49,099
That's what we're hoping to do
catching fish.

560
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,786
But he's rich.
He can buy more fish than you ever saw.

561
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,743
Why, he owns the boat I fell off.

562
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:57,122
- You mean the liner?
- Yes, he practically owns it.

563
00:28:57,645 --> 00:28:59,880
It might have been the fall that done it.

564
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,408
Dories in, sir.

565
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,462
Now you take it easy, son.

566
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,569
- Now you've got to listen to me...
- Dan-o.

567
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:07,811
Uncle Salters'll take the bell.

568
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:11,683
You take him down below
and let him bend on some of your clothes.

569
00:29:11,782 --> 00:29:15,708
No matter what course we take, son,
you can't tack around like that.

570
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:17,665
Then you go and rest a little more.

571
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,118
- Now, what's your name?
- Harvey Ellsworth Cheyne.

572
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:22,494
Well, mine's Dan. Come on down below.

573
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:29,812
So, how'd you fall off
that boat in a calm?

574
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,160
There was a storm coming down.

575
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,008
This morning? There wasn't no storm
this morning. It was a flat calm.

576
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:35,088
Well, I ought to know.

577
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:37,070
There ain't been
no more than a little swell all day.

578
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:38,573
Wait'll we get a rough day out here.

579
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:39,857
What do you call a rough day?

580
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:42,260
When she's putting
most of her cabin house under water.

581
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:43,699
Here, put these on.

582
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:45,771
Wait till you see some of the places
we go.

583
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:46,924
What places?

584
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:50,856
Stone Fence, St. Pierre's Bank,
Whale Deep, Virgin Rock.

585
00:29:50,961 --> 00:29:53,829
Pop gets a ride along with the fish.
Folks say he thinks like a codfish.

586
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:56,684
Well, if thinking like a codfish
is gonna get me where I want to get...

587
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:57,928
I don't care how he thinks.

588
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,752
Pop don't make no hasty judgments.

589
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:02,307
Hey, these are the worst clothes
I ever saw. This stuff itches.

590
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:05,029
Wait'll you wear them for a little while.
They'll shrink to your tonnage.

591
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:07,268
- Round to port.
- Come on, get this stuff on. Dories in.

592
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,408
That's got nothing to do with me.

593
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:13,534
<i>For those 850-pounders</i>

594
00:30:13,606 --> 00:30:15,841
<i>They're more than out-floundered</i>

595
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:20,889
- Did you bring them in better?
- Lean to port, man.

596
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:24,538
- Hey, Dave, hoist away.
- Starboard bin, and pull up.

597
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:27,606
Got plenty of coffee boiling, Doc?

598
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:30,808
- Yes, sir, Capt. Disko.
- Look at Long Jack.

599
00:30:30,877 --> 00:30:33,625
He's got such few fish
they die of loneliness, I think.

600
00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:35,446
You did better, maybe?

601
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,444
Wait till you see what I get.
I get fish with hair on him.

602
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:45,232
There my new kind of fish!
How you feel, little fish?

603
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:48,817
Hey, are you gonna cut up all these
old fish and stuff before we get going?

604
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:50,256
I want to get to my father.

605
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:54,827
Well, it'll be some little time, yet, son.
Easy on that salt, Henry.

606
00:30:54,928 --> 00:30:57,796
- When?
- It's just like you said, Tom.

607
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,203
They're running kind of smallish.

608
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:02,787
- About three months, son.
- Three months?

609
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,761
When we head into Gloucester
with a full load of fish...

610
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:07,427
...we'll help you find your folks.

611
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,984
- But I want to get going right away.
- Excuse me, son.

612
00:31:10,056 --> 00:31:12,924
Was them sharks ravenous today.
Right stole all my gear.

613
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:15,169
- Hey, can't you understand me...
- Now, look here, sonny.

614
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:19,064
I've been close-hauling your problem,
and I want to help you...

615
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,407
...but we've got our problems, too.

616
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,804
All of us here share in the fishing...

617
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:25,726
...and heading back to Gloucester now...

618
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:30,197
...we'd maybe lose all next winter's
daily bread for us and our folks.

619
00:31:30,301 --> 00:31:32,504
You wouldn't want that now, would you?

620
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:36,694
Are you crazy?
I told you my father had more money...

621
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:37,972
Hoist away, Jack!

622
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:40,212
Are you going to listen to me,
or don't you understand...

623
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:41,687
Stand away, boy.

624
00:31:46,965 --> 00:31:50,192
Hey, if you think I'm going to stay
on this boat for three months...

625
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:52,113
Now, look here, son...

626
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:54,092
I don't blame you none.

627
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:57,771
Now you won't me either
after the bile's out of your system.

628
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,685
And even if your daddy
was half what you say...

629
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,522
...it wouldn't be right nor just
to gamble two weeks good fishing...

630
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:07,782
...against a yarn give out
by an upset boy.

631
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:11,142
But I am a fair-minded man...

632
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,620
...and while you're aboard,
I'll pay you wages. $3 a month.

633
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:17,539
- $3...
- Now come on, sonny.

634
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:21,181
You start helping Dan
with them cod livers.

635
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:22,941
Here's a pair of gloves.

636
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,830
We wash them out first,
then we put them in there...

637
00:32:24,897 --> 00:32:27,285
...and after we get the bucket full,
then we put them in the barrel.

638
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,603
That's how we get cod-liver oil.

639
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:32,793
- You think I'd do that?
- Here, they won't hurt you, little fish.

640
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:35,194
Yeah, you heard pop's orders.
You're one of the crew now.

641
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,487
I am not and I'm not going to work on
this boat and nobody can make me, either.

642
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:41,848
Hey, Disko, you hear this?
Come on now, don't be scared, little fish.

643
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:44,496
You keep away from me.
All of you keep away from me.

644
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:46,355
None of you can make me do anything.

645
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,657
Hey, Disko. You got mutiny on board.

646
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:52,018
If you don't want to help,
just keep quiet.

647
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:55,180
When I get off this boat, I'm going to
get my father to put you all in jail.

648
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:56,493
You're all kidnappers.

649
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:59,276
Well, I guess there ain't
nothing else to do.

650
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:01,097
I'll bet they put you all in jail.

651
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:04,547
In jail for the rest of your lives,
and I'm going to do it, too.

652
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:07,967
You hit me.

653
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:11,554
Now you just sit there
and think about it, sonny.

654
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:19,069
Look at Manuel. He's saving fish
to sleep on. Catch up, there!

655
00:33:19,173 --> 00:33:22,945
Hey, I do more work as you do
with your best girl's six brothers.

656
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:29,593
Who in the tarnation
laid that bucket there? Dag-diggit!

657
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:36,340
Now, mind what I told you, son.

658
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,668
You're too young
to be telling a crew of men...

659
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:42,257
...what you'll do and what you won't do.

660
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:45,556
But you might as well
start in learning a few things.

661
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,665
You see that gurry?

662
00:33:47,862 --> 00:33:50,316
Well, when you've hove
them fish heads overside...

663
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:52,689
...you can come below
and get some supper.

664
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,240
Until you do, you get nothing.

665
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:57,232
I'm not going to eat, either.

666
00:34:01,135 --> 00:34:03,784
You do as you mind to about that.

667
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:10,438
Let it rain some more coffee, huh, Doc?

668
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:13,919
Fog's lifting. It'll be clear in an hour.

669
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,472
How is my little fish? Smiling and happy?

670
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:21,533
No, he's still sulking.
He's the orneriest kid I ever seen.

671
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:25,214
Maybe his papa's got so much money
he don't want that little boy no more.

672
00:34:25,282 --> 00:34:29,437
- Maybe he throw him overboard.
- He sure spins a yarn for a kid.

673
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:33,691
- Aye, his papa own that boat.
- Yeah, interesting talker, all right.

674
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:36,178
Why, he's a good enough liar
to write books.

675
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,007
A rope's end, that's what I'd give him.

676
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,206
I'm telling you, it's the fall he took
that did it. It plumb distracted him.

677
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:43,761
My cousin Eben
back from Vermont was like that.

678
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:48,435
He fell off of a barn, and he played
with rag dolls for 30 years.

679
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:54,091
If you want what I think, as soon as this
fog lifts we'll take him into Saint John's.

680
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,072
- I mean it.
- And lose two weeks good fishing, huh?

681
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:59,624
Better than taking a chance
on three months bad luck.

682
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,117
Now we have plenty sunshine
for Mr. Happy Face.

683
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:05,321
He's a passenger on a fishing schooner,
and you know that's bad luck.

684
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,818
<i>What happened to the Orinoco
last year...</i>

685
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:08,746
...when they took on the passenger
at Newfoundland?

686
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:12,192
On the way home, two men get killed and
they don't get hardly a quintal of fish.

687
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,632
<i>- By golly, that true.
- My brother was on the Bedford...</i>

688
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,322
<i>There was a passenger
on the Dorothy Clemens...</i>

689
00:35:16,392 --> 00:35:17,668
...when she got rammed by the liner.

690
00:35:17,736 --> 00:35:19,426
Well, that's nothing.

691
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:21,763
There's lots of vessels
lost out of Gloucester...

692
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,966
...never had no passenger on board.

693
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:27,001
I was a passenger on my father's boat...

694
00:35:27,106 --> 00:35:29,560
...and I never brought him no bad luck.

695
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:32,565
- Daniel, here...
- Your own son ain't being a passenger.

696
00:35:32,768 --> 00:35:34,709
Skipper,
when we trawled this bank last year...

697
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:36,886
...there was nothing but dories
loaded to the gunwales.

698
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:39,738
This kid comes aboard this morning
and look at today's catch.

699
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,007
Now, look here. Wait a minute.

700
00:35:42,394 --> 00:35:45,840
- There ain't no passenger on board.
- Why not?

701
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:48,562
Well, I made him a member of the crew.

702
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:53,069
Well, it stands to reason if I'm paying him
wages, he ain't no passenger, don't it?

703
00:35:53,173 --> 00:35:56,554
No, sir.
You can't just buy Jonahs off that way.

704
00:35:56,627 --> 00:35:59,560
I hold, he's still a passenger
as long as he ain't done no work.

705
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:01,160
Yeah, and Jack's right.

706
00:36:01,232 --> 00:36:03,882
Well, he'll work
as soon as he gets hungry.

707
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:06,791
What's going to happen
between now and the time he does?

708
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:09,828
Now look here. I decided this.

709
00:36:10,028 --> 00:36:14,630
Manuel's responsible for him being
on board. So you got to put him to work.

710
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:16,584
- Me?
- You got to, Manuel.

711
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,948
Yes, sir.
Manuel, that's only fair and just.

712
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:22,145
- I stick his face in that gurry.
- You got to do it.

713
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,206
Please do, Manuel. We don't want
no Jonahs happenings aboard.

714
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:30,844
- You gonna do it now?
- I go stand my watch.

715
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:33,562
- I mean it, Manuel.
- All right.

716
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:36,436
I think I pay doubles
for my mistake, huh?

717
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:40,086
Me, what likes kids like tub of
rat poison. And that kid, two tubs.

718
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,081
He just say one word to me,
I throw him right back to the fish.

719
00:36:51,062 --> 00:36:53,395
Ah, the supper
she is great tonight, Olley.

720
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,348
Doc has fish cakes like the stars.

721
00:36:55,412 --> 00:36:57,964
I sure could stow away
about a dory-load.

722
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:03,878
I never taste such fish cake.
And this raisin bread...

723
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:05,806
Just like cake.

724
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:10,152
Say, look, you could get me some food,
couldn't you?

725
00:37:11,884 --> 00:37:14,501
- But I'm sick and I'm hungry.
- Go away from me.

726
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:17,732
- Do you want to make some money?
- Go away from me, I break your neck.

727
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:19,294
Why do you want to be a kidnapper?

728
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:21,156
Look, do me a favor, huh? Shut your face.

729
00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:24,604
- You're just as bad as the rest of them.
- You crazy. Nobody bad round here.

730
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:26,138
You just bad luck.

731
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,546
Listen. Listen, you.

732
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:32,572
You clean up gurry little bit,
I give you a nickel, huh?

733
00:37:32,737 --> 00:37:35,452
See, look,
I'm trying to give you $10,000, maybe.

734
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:38,965
You get out one of those boats
and take me back to New York.

735
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:41,587
You and me in that dory, huh?

736
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:44,888
Yes. How far are we from New York?

737
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:47,732
<i>You want row a Nova Iorque,
now, huh?</i>

738
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,581
Well, I know how.
I've been taught in school.

739
00:37:51,032 --> 00:37:55,601
Now, look. You clean up little bit, huh?
Anything. Just so little work.

740
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:58,225
You want nice boat look nice, huh?

741
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:00,778
It's a dirty rotten little boat
I wouldn't even spit at.

742
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:04,678
Say, you... Say, this is finest schooner
out from Gloucester.

743
00:38:13,036 --> 00:38:16,350
Jonah, for the last time.
You gonna work or no?

744
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,245
I'm not gonna have
anything more to do with you.

745
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:19,720
That is good here.

746
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:34,528
Hey, Jonah. Hey, kid.

747
00:38:36,672 --> 00:38:38,045
Where you hiding?

748
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,748
Hey! What you doing?

749
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:44,698
- I'm going to New York.
- You what?

750
00:38:44,764 --> 00:38:46,650
- I'm going to get away from here.
- Why, you...

751
00:38:46,714 --> 00:38:49,266
- You keep away from me.
- Hey, you.

752
00:38:49,337 --> 00:38:50,798
- Put down that oar.
- I won't.

753
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:55,310
Put down... Hey, put...
You bad luck, all right! You...

754
00:39:06,064 --> 00:39:08,485
I can do this long as you can.

755
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:15,169
Oh, you crybaby, too, huh?

756
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:16,905
I am not.

757
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,518
No? Good. Now look...

758
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:23,551
<i>- ...you still want row a Nova Iorque?
- Yes.</i>

759
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:25,596
- You still hungry?
- Yes.

760
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,454
Then come here.

761
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:45,299
Now. Now you can go below and eat.

762
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:51,511
That man said I could eat.

763
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:54,833
- Manuel?
- It's okay, he do some work.

764
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:57,684
- I did not.
- You clean something off deck, no?

765
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,498
- You made me do something.
- That was work.

766
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:02,504
That's fine. Sit right here.

767
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:04,398
- Yes, sir.
- How did you get him to do it?

768
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:06,953
He do anything for me.

769
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:10,891
Even break my leg, maybe, too.

770
00:40:16,076 --> 00:40:20,165
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

771
00:40:20,266 --> 00:40:24,541
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

772
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:32,091
<i>Once Doc baked some biscuit
And throw them away</i>

773
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:36,416
<i>Next day no more fish
Come around boat to play</i>

774
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:40,733
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

775
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:45,179
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

776
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:53,010
<i>Said cabbage to fish cake
Who lay on one dish</i>

777
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:57,331
<i>I beautiful cabbage
You only poor fish</i>

778
00:40:57,399 --> 00:41:01,587
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

779
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:06,060
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

780
00:41:07,282 --> 00:41:09,069
- Who's that?
- Me.

781
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,143
The food was awful.

782
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:18,665
But it was better than nothing, I guess.

783
00:41:20,682 --> 00:41:23,201
If you hadn't choked me,
I wouldn't have had to kick you.

784
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,377
You kick me? I feel nothing.

785
00:41:27,623 --> 00:41:29,313
All cleared up, hasn't it?

786
00:41:29,702 --> 00:41:31,392
The weather, it's nice now.

787
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:33,793
- It was till you come up.
- Well, they sent me up.

788
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,379
No. No, I bet they ask you stay.

789
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,383
They said you wanted to show me
how to go on watch.

790
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:41,302
Nice fellows.

791
00:41:41,472 --> 00:41:43,445
- All right. Go ahead, watch.
- How?

792
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,859
Just keep quiet.

793
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:48,818
Go someplace.
Go look for iceberg or boat or something.

794
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:53,648
Is that all there is to watching?
That seems like a lot of hooey.

795
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,122
Hooey?

796
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:57,616
What kind smart talk that "hooey"?

797
00:41:58,102 --> 00:42:01,548
You better tell sailor's angel that smart
talk. He like to hear that, I think.

798
00:42:01,621 --> 00:42:04,489
- Who's he?
- I guess you don't know nothing, huh?

799
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:07,535
Sailor's angel,
he fly around up there all time.

800
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:09,926
You watch here,
look out for 25 men below.

801
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:11,975
He watch up there, he look out for you.

802
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:14,915
You go sleep, maybe. He tap you
on shoulder with his wing and he say:...

803
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,217
..."Hey, Manuel, wake up.
What's the matter? I ashamed for you".

804
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:22,723
He very nice fellow. Everybody know that.

805
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:24,384
Oh.

806
00:42:26,312 --> 00:42:29,180
Well, nothing on the port side.

807
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,832
That fine. Anything on starboard?

808
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,182
No. Nothing on the starboard, either.

809
00:42:38,274 --> 00:42:40,062
And nothing in the head.

810
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:42,558
That port, that starboard.

811
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,990
I bet I know a lot of things
you don't know.

812
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:50,577
I know that's not French you're singing.

813
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:54,065
That's right. About 10 million people
know it's Portuguese.

814
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:58,061
- I bet you can't speak French.
- Right now I sorry I speak English.

815
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,568
What's this?

816
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,656
That's a boat, that's easy to see.

817
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:15,502
Yes, maybe your father come back
see if you good and drowned, huh?

818
00:43:15,695 --> 00:43:18,214
Yeah, that boat's no bigger
than this one.

819
00:43:20,716 --> 00:43:23,617
- What do you keep singing for?
- Because I like to sing.

820
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:29,697
- I've never heard that song before.
- Me, neither. I just make him up.

821
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:33,539
You can't write songs.

822
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:35,644
I don't write them.
I just find them in my mouth.

823
00:43:35,717 --> 00:43:38,082
A song can't be any good like that
when you just make it up.

824
00:43:38,146 --> 00:43:40,000
Say, that's best kind songs.

825
00:43:40,065 --> 00:43:43,413
When you feel good inside,
like trade wind, she just come out.

826
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,788
<i>O my beautiful lady</i>

827
00:43:45,887 --> 00:43:49,398
People learn songs. Songs aren't
just inside of people like that.

828
00:43:49,725 --> 00:43:53,978
Say, sometimes a song so big and sweet
inside, I just can't get him out.

829
00:43:54,586 --> 00:43:57,901
And then I look up at stars
and maybe cry. It feels so good.

830
00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:01,172
Don't you never feel like this?

831
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,971
- No, I guess you don't.
- Nobody else ever did, either.

832
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:09,198
Say, my father, when he alive,
he made better songs than me.

833
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,432
And what kind of songs did he sing?

834
00:44:11,506 --> 00:44:14,570
Songs about the sun and the sea.
Songs about the clouds.

835
00:44:14,896 --> 00:44:17,480
Big songs about the wind and the storms.

836
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:20,966
And little songs, too,
about the tip of my mother's nose.

837
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:24,009
Oh, my father, he feel beautiful inside.

838
00:44:24,491 --> 00:44:27,337
- Is that all he did, was sing?
- Is that...

839
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:29,789
My father was the best fisherman
in the whole Madeira Islands...

840
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:32,229
- ...and that's every place.
- Well, that's not so much.

841
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,821
How you mean, not so much?

842
00:44:33,894 --> 00:44:37,951
Well, I mean, he didn't do much for you.
I mean, he didn't leave you anything.

843
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,324
He didn't leave...

844
00:44:39,395 --> 00:44:42,558
He leave me this hurdy-gurdy
that his grandfather leave him.

845
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,728
He teach me how to fish,
how to sail a boat.

846
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:47,417
He gave me arms and hands and feet,
feeling good outside...

847
00:44:47,486 --> 00:44:49,787
...and he teach me
how to feel good inside.

848
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:53,461
My father do all this.
He have 17 other kids, beside.

849
00:44:53,532 --> 00:44:55,255
What else a father do, huh?

850
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:57,784
- Oh, I don't know.
- Say, listen, my...

851
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:01,456
Capt. Disko!

852
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:03,952
Capt. Disko!

853
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,637
<i>That Jennie Cushman,
she is even now under our stern!</i>

854
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,715
She come make you happy, I think!

855
00:45:09,715 --> 00:45:13,837
<i>The Jennie Cushman?
I might've known it.</i>

856
00:45:15,153 --> 00:45:16,297
Yes, sir.

857
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,904
That's her nosy, long topmast
prying into our wake.

858
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:26,020
<i>Hey, there!
On the Cushman!</i>

859
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:29,918
Where's that poor excuse for a skipper
you got aboard?

860
00:45:30,376 --> 00:45:32,383
And who is it might be wanting him?

861
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:37,123
You know consarned well who wants him,
you bilge-raised haddock!

862
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:39,838
Well, if it ain't Disko Troop.

863
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:43,100
And me thinking
I was gonna fish here all alone.

864
00:45:43,585 --> 00:45:47,511
Who passed you the word I was here
so you could follow me, Disko?

865
00:45:47,616 --> 00:45:49,655
Now look here, Walt Cushman.

866
00:45:49,822 --> 00:45:51,763
I'm sick near to retching...

867
00:45:51,837 --> 00:45:55,251
...at you using my brains
to catch a trip of fish.

868
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:59,443
Sailing under my wake
every time I find a good spot.

869
00:45:59,577 --> 00:46:01,267
Why, Capt. Troop.

870
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:06,223
Now, is that the way for one gentleman
to talk to his colleague in commerce?

871
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:08,910
You're trailing me
'cause I can find cod...

872
00:46:09,012 --> 00:46:12,589
...where you can't find
half a pound of sick squid.

873
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,791
I'll do the fishing, Disko...

874
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:19,948
...you just get out that checkerboard and
try to figure out how really smart you are.

875
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:23,175
So what, he beat you at checkers
last winter, huh?

876
00:46:23,245 --> 00:46:25,218
Yeah, and he cheats at that, too.

877
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,201
He'll beat us into Gloucester
this trip, too, I think.

878
00:46:28,267 --> 00:46:29,891
Oh, you think so, do you?

879
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:32,349
Well, now, listen to me,
I'm gonna tell you something.

880
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:33,852
I ain't so dumb.

881
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:38,266
Fussing around like that will make him
think the fishing is good here.

882
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:41,089
Then, in the morning,
when the fog banks roll in...

883
00:46:41,188 --> 00:46:45,855
...we'll sneak out and leave him sitting
here baiting big and catching small...

884
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:48,123
...while we're out finding fish.

885
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:52,275
We'll have a full hold
and be tied up in Gloucester...

886
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,869
...by the 1st of August,
and he'll still be out here...

887
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:57,361
...floundering around,
trying to catch fish...

888
00:46:57,531 --> 00:47:00,115
...or I'll look more like a halibut
than he does.

889
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:04,559
They sure are mad at each other,
aren't they?

890
00:47:04,663 --> 00:47:07,531
No, no, no. They're not mad.
They just make it up.

891
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:09,164
They do that all time.

892
00:47:09,717 --> 00:47:11,854
About everybody's crazy here.

893
00:47:11,923 --> 00:47:14,257
You make up your songs,
they make up they're mad.

894
00:47:14,323 --> 00:47:16,362
You got bunk, you better go below.

895
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:18,830
- No, I'd rather stay here.
- You go below.

896
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:22,123
- No, I'm gonna stay here and watch.
- I watch here. You go there, watch.

897
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,971
Go sleep. Do something.
I no understand you.

898
00:47:35,047 --> 00:47:40,511
<i>There's a place in my heart
For the one I love best</i>

899
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:46,393
<i>And I still keep her picture
Tattooed on my chest</i>

900
00:47:46,977 --> 00:47:52,474
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

901
00:47:52,543 --> 00:47:58,290
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

902
00:48:09,814 --> 00:48:14,252
Well, I stole a march on Walt Cushman
all right, I reckon, that time.

903
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:16,231
Yes, we did that, certain sure.

904
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,180
We did, you darned old farmer.

905
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,854
Go on, hold her to her course,
northeast by east.

906
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:24,235
She heels over so much.

907
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:28,162
Well, leave her heel. You ain't steering
no mowing machine, now.

908
00:48:28,651 --> 00:48:30,472
Heave that lead, Manuel.

909
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,926
He think he got hold stern end
of cow, maybe, huh?

910
00:48:38,279 --> 00:48:41,092
Hey, kid. Hey, wake up.

911
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:43,171
Come on, wake up, little fish.

912
00:48:44,707 --> 00:48:46,168
Hey, wake up, wake up.

913
00:48:46,242 --> 00:48:48,794
Somebody think you dead,
they have celebrations.

914
00:48:48,865 --> 00:48:50,773
So that's your tub of rat poison.

915
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:52,789
You tucked him in his little bunk
last night, huh?

916
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,967
What do you mean?
This foolish kid, he bother me.

917
00:48:55,038 --> 00:48:57,851
I don't know. He fall asleep,
pulled tarpaulin over him, I guess.

918
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:00,020
And me, I look all over for this.

919
00:49:00,155 --> 00:49:03,415
You did, huh? I suppose
he pulled your coat around him, too.

920
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:05,236
I look for my coat, too.

921
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,403
- So you stole my coat, too, huh?
- Why, no, I...

922
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:10,673
Sure, he stole it right off your back.

923
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:14,865
So big tough fisherman is gonna
throw him back to the fishes, huh?

924
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:19,083
Some day, I think I...

925
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:36,640
Ten fathom.

926
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:40,385
Thanks. Thanks for covering me up
with your coat and everything.

927
00:49:40,454 --> 00:49:41,664
That's all right.

928
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:46,465
Would you by any chance be showing
any blue pebbles from the bottom?

929
00:49:47,523 --> 00:49:50,205
I never did thank you for saving my life.

930
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:51,798
I ought to thank you for that, all right.

931
00:49:51,873 --> 00:49:54,260
You feel better this morning, huh?

932
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:55,479
I guess so.

933
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:59,258
Well, when you got it figured out,
you come and let somebody know, huh?

934
00:50:00,475 --> 00:50:02,329
Blue pebble, she is.

935
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:05,044
By golly, I think that
Disko know this ocean better...

936
00:50:05,113 --> 00:50:06,770
...as I know inside my shirt.

937
00:50:07,064 --> 00:50:09,267
- Are you fishing now?
- Sure.

938
00:50:09,847 --> 00:50:12,497
I fish for bottom,
so she don't fish for us.

939
00:50:13,205 --> 00:50:16,203
Go away with your foolish questions,
which don't have no brain.

940
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:19,121
All right, then,
if that's the way you feel about it.

941
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:29,512
Fifteen fathom and clear away!

942
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:33,065
By golly, I beat you this time.

943
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,782
<i>He who has a daughter
Oh, what a terrible man</i>

944
00:50:39,848 --> 00:50:41,440
<i>Oh, what a terrible man</i>

945
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,690
<i>Speaking in his native lingo
He said, "Marry Bingo-Bingo"</i>

946
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,436
<i>Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man</i>

947
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:53,882
<i>He will bring you beans and sorrows
Yes, I know about his morals</i>

948
00:50:54,047 --> 00:50:57,755
<i>Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man</i>

949
00:50:58,078 --> 00:51:02,167
<i>Bingo-Bingo came to woo her
Brought a lot of presents to her</i>

950
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:07,448
<i>Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man</i>

951
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:12,461
Dag-gummit, of all the consarned...

952
00:51:12,566 --> 00:51:14,867
What's the matter, farmer?
Think you're sticking hogs?

953
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:18,346
This dad-bitted boat keeps bouncing
around under me, of all...

954
00:51:19,442 --> 00:51:20,968
- What you laughing at?
- Him.

955
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:23,659
- Well, don't laugh.
- Why? Everybody else did.

956
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,279
It's all right, they got right to laugh.
They know how chop bait.

957
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:28,455
- You know how?
- Doesn't look like anything.

958
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:30,664
Go ahead, chop. Tail first.

959
00:51:35,754 --> 00:51:37,476
Try it again, harder.

960
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,437
You fish for sperm whale, maybe.

961
00:51:42,151 --> 00:51:44,539
Don't laugh. Beside, you laugh no good.

962
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:46,846
Like seagull.

963
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:50,137
I guess I want to do something.

964
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,380
Yes, but you wanna do
just what you want to do.

965
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:55,066
I tell you what you do.
You go below in galley and help Doc.

966
00:51:55,136 --> 00:51:56,313
You carry slops.

967
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:59,382
You sweat in galley like Dan did
before you talk about being fisherman.

968
00:51:59,454 --> 00:52:01,492
- Go on now, go on.
- All right.

969
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,705
You think Manuel soft with that kid, huh?

970
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:10,256
You think 'cause I catch him
I let him still be Jonah, huh?

971
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:11,756
Not on your livings.

972
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:15,115
Kid, he drive me crazy.
Think I break his neck.

973
00:52:48,324 --> 00:52:49,305
Kid.

974
00:52:50,243 --> 00:52:51,671
- Spit.
- What?

975
00:52:52,066 --> 00:52:53,658
- Spit first.
- Why?

976
00:52:54,018 --> 00:52:55,326
You'll find out.

977
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:57,686
Oh.

978
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:00,157
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

979
00:53:17,589 --> 00:53:20,686
- You go out fishing?
- Sure, sometimes me and Uncle Salters.

980
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:21,931
Who goes with Manuel?

981
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:24,009
Nobody. You don't see him
baiting a trawl, do you?

982
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:26,731
- You mean, he doesn't fish?
- Sure he does. He fishes hand line.

983
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:29,865
He ain't used a trawl
or had a dorymate since his pop died.

984
00:53:29,934 --> 00:53:30,948
Oh.

985
00:53:31,246 --> 00:53:35,041
- Did you start fishing with your father?
- Sure, that's natural, ain't it?

986
00:53:56,481 --> 00:53:58,552
Get your dories ready!

987
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:00,987
Come on, boys, step lively.

988
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:06,578
Get your dory to the rail.
Lower your dory to the rail.

989
00:54:12,312 --> 00:54:14,580
Keep well to the westward, Tom.

990
00:54:14,935 --> 00:54:19,689
We'll head straight down the road
as soon as we got all the dories spilled.

991
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,312
Come on, get her in the water.

992
00:54:30,383 --> 00:54:33,447
Don't crack that one on me.
Ease a little.

993
00:54:43,657 --> 00:54:46,022
- Thank you, Uncle Salters.
- Manuel, he all set.

994
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:47,297
Here's a hook.

995
00:54:56,449 --> 00:54:58,968
Isn't it too rough to go out
in that little boat?

996
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,461
- What do you mean?
- I mean, to go out alone.

997
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,826
I not go alone. Five minutes,
I have 100 fish keep me company.

998
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:08,055
I mean, wouldn't it be better
if you had someone to row, maybe?

999
00:55:08,123 --> 00:55:09,878
Who I get to row? Doc? Disko?

1000
00:55:09,947 --> 00:55:11,800
You very foolish this morning.

1001
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:14,262
Well, I rowed a boat at school.
I could row...

1002
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:16,334
Oh, I see. You row this boat, huh?

1003
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:19,155
What you know about boats
when you cannot even chop bait?

1004
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:20,814
I know lots about boats, see?

1005
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,607
I know that's the jib,
and that's the jumbo...

1006
00:55:22,676 --> 00:55:24,814
...and that's the fore rig,
and that's the fore topmast...

1007
00:55:24,883 --> 00:55:26,670
...and that's the foremast,
and that's the triadic stay.

1008
00:55:26,738 --> 00:55:28,560
That's the main topmast,
and that's the main mast...

1009
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,511
...and that's the main rigging,
and that's the gurry kit.

1010
00:55:30,576 --> 00:55:32,964
<i>That's the Duncan Street,
and anything else you want to know?</i>

1011
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:34,183
Where you learn all this?

1012
00:55:34,254 --> 00:55:37,220
I read a book on it in Capt. Disko's
cabin, and I don't care who knows it.

1013
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:39,147
And you can go row your old boat
all by yourself.

1014
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:41,382
I wouldn't go out in it for anything.

1015
00:55:48,487 --> 00:55:50,242
By golly, that's smart kid.

1016
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:53,566
About time to break his neck, ain't it?

1017
00:55:53,763 --> 00:55:56,860
I got no time break necks.
I got fishing to do.

1018
00:55:57,122 --> 00:55:58,234
Lower away.

1019
00:56:14,073 --> 00:56:17,235
Hard alee. Stand by the headsail!

1020
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:20,878
Twenty-eight fathom.
She's shoaling fast, Capt. Disko.

1021
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,506
We're getting to her.

1022
00:56:23,189 --> 00:56:25,643
Twenty-six fathoms, bottom rock.

1023
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:29,583
We're on the bank. Let go your anchor.

1024
00:56:32,592 --> 00:56:34,795
Tie up your jib and jumbo!

1025
00:56:35,022 --> 00:56:36,843
Stand by your foresails.

1026
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:41,413
Bait them snug, boys,
bait them for home and mother.

1027
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:44,547
- This fog is going to lift for you.
- Well, that's something.

1028
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:47,266
Oh, what do you care, Jack?
Pop could find fish in a graveyard.

1029
00:56:47,336 --> 00:56:49,506
There's a run of cod on this bank...

1030
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:52,257
...that Walt Cushman
won't know nothing about.

1031
00:56:52,357 --> 00:56:55,073
Ahoy there, on the mud scow.

1032
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,771
Whose anchor chain is that a-rattling
like it's full of rust and roaches?

1033
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:04,502
Well, if it ain't Disko Troop.

1034
00:57:04,607 --> 00:57:08,217
Did you spring your fore stick
trying to follow me, Disko?

1035
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:13,680
I suppose you'll deny
I showed you the road to this spot...

1036
00:57:13,818 --> 00:57:18,572
...a year ago this very day,
you cross-eyed mackerel.

1037
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:21,972
You want to row over
for a game of checkers?

1038
00:57:22,326 --> 00:57:24,397
Fishing is mighty sparse here.

1039
00:57:24,757 --> 00:57:27,887
We'll never sink under the weight
of fish we been catching.

1040
00:57:28,243 --> 00:57:31,144
Well, I ain't doing so good myself.

1041
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:34,125
I can lay it to your presence, maybe.

1042
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,904
He's lying, the same as me.

1043
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:41,066
He's a plank deeper in the water
than he was the last time we seen him.

1044
00:57:41,196 --> 00:57:43,748
I think that Walt Cushman,
he smart fisherman.

1045
00:57:44,234 --> 00:57:46,688
Maybe we better sail after him
all time, huh?

1046
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,842
Well, boys.

1047
00:57:52,262 --> 00:57:55,228
You gotta start
in filling fish from now on.

1048
00:57:55,716 --> 00:57:59,292
That meddling buoy-tender's
near as full up as we are.

1049
00:57:59,395 --> 00:58:03,451
We'd be way up around Virgin Rocks by
now if it weren't for picking up Jonahs.

1050
00:58:03,616 --> 00:58:05,590
He's been working mighty hard, Mr. Jack.

1051
00:58:05,664 --> 00:58:08,248
I don't think there's much Jonah
left in him. Honest.

1052
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,651
Or we might fill faster
if our Jonah-catcher...

1053
00:58:10,716 --> 00:58:13,268
...would throw away his hand line
and bend on a trawl for once.

1054
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,794
You don't think I catch as much fish
as you, huh, Jack?

1055
00:58:15,865 --> 00:58:17,294
I ain't saying that.

1056
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,722
Maybe you just bump your head on bunk
when you get up this morning, huh?

1057
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:24,335
Or maybe you Portuguese just don't know
nothing about trawl-fishing.

1058
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:26,666
I tell you what I do.

1059
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,928
I take Jonah kid with me tomorrow.

1060
00:58:30,003 --> 00:58:32,336
I fish hand line, I show him same time.

1061
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:35,595
I bet you we bring in more fish
as you and Nate toguessers.

1062
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:38,381
"Toguessers". Speak English, will you?

1063
00:58:38,478 --> 00:58:40,714
More fish as me and Nate together.

1064
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:42,983
More fish than you and Nate together.

1065
00:58:45,451 --> 00:58:46,977
Reckon we take that, Nate?

1066
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,674
You mean I'm going to be your dorymate?

1067
00:58:48,744 --> 00:58:50,304
I mean nothing of kind.

1068
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,308
You just sit in boat and be Jonah.
I do fishing.

1069
00:58:53,414 --> 00:58:56,413
- I'm going out with Manuel in the morning.
- That's fine.

1070
00:58:56,613 --> 00:58:59,546
Did you say you'd like to bet
a little something on that, Manuel?

1071
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,887
Oh, you think you scare me on bet, huh?

1072
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,064
I tell you what I do with you.

1073
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:07,960
I bet you my brand-new
safety razor I buy last Christmas.

1074
00:59:08,031 --> 00:59:10,419
98 cents, mail-order house, I...

1075
00:59:11,229 --> 00:59:14,261
You put up 50 cents piece.
Brand-new, this year's.

1076
00:59:14,363 --> 00:59:15,475
That's a wager.

1077
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:17,880
You sure
you didn't bump your head, Manuel?

1078
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:20,562
I no bet on sure thing. I bet on myself.

1079
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:22,544
Just as good.

1080
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,028
I guess I didn't mean what I said
about going in your boat.

1081
00:59:39,023 --> 00:59:41,160
Make no difference what you mean.
You in it now.

1082
00:59:41,229 --> 00:59:44,740
I'm awful glad I am, Manuel.
I don't think I'll be a Jonah, honest.

1083
00:59:46,155 --> 00:59:47,715
What your name? Harvey?

1084
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:52,478
Well, I gotta call you something.
I'll call you Harvey.

1085
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:54,884
Oh, that's better.

1086
00:59:55,653 --> 00:59:57,562
You no laugh like seagull now.

1087
00:59:58,565 --> 01:00:01,018
Come on now, I feel tired.
You gotta help row.

1088
01:00:01,091 --> 01:00:02,945
Really? Gee!

1089
01:00:03,106 --> 01:00:04,382
Put in the pins.

1090
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,324
Put the oars in the pins.

1091
01:00:07,456 --> 01:00:10,803
We gotta go someplace.
Now, when I say three, you row.

1092
01:00:11,517 --> 01:00:13,339
All right. I'm ready.

1093
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,127
One, two, three.

1094
01:00:17,722 --> 01:00:20,623
That fine school you go to,
you row on your back, huh?

1095
01:00:20,793 --> 01:00:22,614
I was too anxious, I guess.

1096
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,362
Never mind anxious,
you leave me be anxious.

1097
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:26,831
Now, come on.

1098
01:00:27,158 --> 01:00:29,546
One, two, three. Row!

1099
01:00:31,508 --> 01:00:32,554
Row!

1100
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:37,484
We get someplace.

1101
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:40,714
Bottom of the ocean, I think, maybe.

1102
01:00:44,556 --> 01:00:46,279
Now we fish.

1103
01:00:50,825 --> 01:00:52,515
Well, go on. Bait your hook.

1104
01:00:52,584 --> 01:00:55,616
How you think you gonna fish
sitting there looking at me?

1105
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,175
You bait just like you row boat. Here.

1106
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,397
Look, you must put barb all way through.
Like this.

1107
01:01:09,663 --> 01:01:12,858
Otherwise that fish he spit that out
six, seven times when he feel something.

1108
01:01:12,925 --> 01:01:14,451
You know this fish,
he don't go to school...

1109
01:01:14,525 --> 01:01:17,109
...he don't know French,
but he pretty smart, too.

1110
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:20,406
Now drop him down to bottom.

1111
01:01:20,506 --> 01:01:22,359
Then pull up about six inches, maybe...

1112
01:01:22,425 --> 01:01:26,645
...so he look fish straight in eye and say,
"Look here. I got corn beef and cabbage".

1113
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:31,602
Hey, I've got one.

1114
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:40,903
You got new idea, maybe, too, huh?

1115
01:01:41,806 --> 01:01:44,805
What you think,
we just feed fish free here for nothing?

1116
01:01:44,973 --> 01:01:46,914
I guess I was too anxious again.

1117
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,190
I told you,
stay away from that anxious business.

1118
01:01:49,259 --> 01:01:52,040
Let the fish be anxious. Here, look.

1119
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:55,903
One, two...

1120
01:01:56,455 --> 01:01:57,981
...now it's in his mouth.

1121
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,705
Now up he comes.

1122
01:02:01,348 --> 01:02:03,997
Gosh. Can I take him off the hook?

1123
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:08,634
We got no time for that.
We don't know this fish personal.

1124
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:11,802
- Hey, I've got one now.
- All right, pull him up.

1125
01:02:11,871 --> 01:02:14,520
Don't let him stay down there
and tell all other fish what going on.

1126
01:02:14,589 --> 01:02:17,141
Pull him up! Hey, wait a minute. Hey...

1127
01:02:17,245 --> 01:02:19,764
...you gonna bring fish up see you,
you going down to see him?

1128
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:21,622
- Pull him up!
- I will.

1129
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:25,550
Oh, the boat tipped and I...

1130
01:02:29,302 --> 01:02:30,512
Oh, he got off.

1131
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,241
How you expect catch fish,
falling on your backside all time?

1132
01:02:35,347 --> 01:02:36,590
Bait your hook.

1133
01:02:37,617 --> 01:02:40,202
Don't look like
they was jumping in your dory.

1134
01:02:40,336 --> 01:02:43,465
I wait till I get
soft place for them to land in first.

1135
01:02:44,526 --> 01:02:46,118
I'll catch the next one.

1136
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:48,261
You'll beat Long Jack and Nate.
Don't you worry.

1137
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:49,924
He won't get your razor.

1138
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:51,657
You think so, huh?

1139
01:02:52,682 --> 01:02:54,404
Nothing going on here now.

1140
01:02:55,048 --> 01:02:56,935
That fish, he have meeting down below.

1141
01:02:56,999 --> 01:03:00,314
He tell all other fish
there's something not so funny going on.

1142
01:03:00,645 --> 01:03:03,808
Has your father been dead a long time?

1143
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,193
Six year, next month.
Seem a long, long time.

1144
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,529
How did he die?

1145
01:03:10,113 --> 01:03:12,413
He drown off Cape Sable in storm.

1146
01:03:12,959 --> 01:03:15,325
Wave come at night
and wash him overboard.

1147
01:03:15,486 --> 01:03:17,721
- Didn't they find him?
- No.

1148
01:03:19,036 --> 01:03:21,653
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What you sorry about?

1149
01:03:22,202 --> 01:03:24,786
Well, I mean your father.
They didn't find him.

1150
01:03:24,953 --> 01:03:27,254
What they need find him for?
He all right.

1151
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,515
Well, but, drowning out in the ocean,
all alone at night...

1152
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:33,422
Well, what's trouble about that?
That fine way.

1153
01:03:34,964 --> 01:03:37,167
The Savior, he take my father
up to fisherman's heaven...

1154
01:03:37,235 --> 01:03:38,990
...up with all his old friends.

1155
01:03:41,009 --> 01:03:42,699
Quick he take him up. Quick.

1156
01:03:42,768 --> 01:03:45,254
Just like I pull up this 35-pound fish.

1157
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,567
The Savior, He see my father all tired
and wet down there in the water.

1158
01:03:54,858 --> 01:03:57,126
So he light the harbor buoy
and he say:...

1159
01:03:57,512 --> 01:03:59,234
..."Come on up, old Manuel...

1160
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:02,171
I so happy you come up here
to help us fish".

1161
01:04:02,981 --> 01:04:04,868
And my father, he say, "Thank you.

1162
01:04:04,932 --> 01:04:06,906
I very happy to come up, too.

1163
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:10,589
And maybe I show you something
about fishing up here, huh?"

1164
01:04:11,105 --> 01:04:12,446
And then they all laugh.

1165
01:04:12,512 --> 01:04:14,584
And the Savior,
He put his arm around my father...

1166
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:16,509
...and He give him
brand-new dory to fish in.

1167
01:04:16,574 --> 01:04:18,745
You think they really fish in heaven?

1168
01:04:18,845 --> 01:04:22,105
Why, sure they fish in heaven.
What else they do?

1169
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,530
The Apostles, they all fishermen,
I think.

1170
01:04:24,602 --> 01:04:26,576
You remember that Simon,
called Peter?

1171
01:04:26,649 --> 01:04:27,990
Remember that time when...

1172
01:04:28,056 --> 01:04:30,510
...he don't catch no fish
in the sea of Galilee?

1173
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:33,069
And the Savior, He stand
on the shore and He say:...

1174
01:04:33,142 --> 01:04:36,271
..."Simon, you throw your net
on the right side".

1175
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,444
And Simon, he throw his net
on the right side...

1176
01:04:38,514 --> 01:04:41,644
...and he catch so many fish,
his net, it almost break in two.

1177
01:04:43,089 --> 01:04:45,476
I think the Savior,
He the best fisherman.

1178
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:47,466
But my father, he come next.

1179
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:50,724
And not fishing like this. Oh, no, no.

1180
01:04:50,892 --> 01:04:52,266
Fish bite all time.

1181
01:04:52,332 --> 01:04:54,916
When no more fish,
the Savior, He make more fish.

1182
01:04:54,986 --> 01:04:57,057
He make more fish. He make more bread.

1183
01:04:57,129 --> 01:04:58,470
He make more wine.

1184
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,308
And at night He stand watch
all by Himself.

1185
01:05:03,206 --> 01:05:04,187
He say:...

1186
01:05:04,325 --> 01:05:06,495
..."Good night, fishermen.
You tired now.

1187
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:08,344
Go to your bunks.

1188
01:05:08,675 --> 01:05:10,616
And no snorings, please.

1189
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:14,046
Good night, Manuel's father".

1190
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,952
Oh, that very nice place.

1191
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:18,037
Oh.

1192
01:05:18,622 --> 01:05:20,890
Sometimes I think I go there right now.

1193
01:05:21,469 --> 01:05:23,737
Then I say, "Now, whoa, Manuel.

1194
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:26,389
You gotta be better fisherman first.

1195
01:05:26,585 --> 01:05:30,642
That Savior, He only give dories to
first-class fishermen, like your father".

1196
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:33,103
So I keep on fishing. I no hurry.

1197
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:36,175
I know my father keep place for me
in his dory.

1198
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:40,201
Hey, sleepy-face, look.

1199
01:05:40,307 --> 01:05:42,859
- You log on a bump.
- Oh, say. I didn't...

1200
01:05:43,153 --> 01:05:45,541
Easy now, easy. He's a big one.

1201
01:05:45,616 --> 01:05:48,876
And stay off your backside, you hear me?
Come on, pull him up.

1202
01:05:49,134 --> 01:05:50,595
I'm trying to...

1203
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:53,569
You want Manuel help, huh?
I think you get blisters.

1204
01:05:53,644 --> 01:05:56,959
Blisters good for fishermen. Come on.
Pull him up, pull him up.

1205
01:05:58,505 --> 01:06:00,260
- Hey, what's this?
- Yeah.

1206
01:06:02,183 --> 01:06:04,669
- Pull him up. Pull him up.
- What is he?

1207
01:06:04,774 --> 01:06:06,082
He's a halibut.

1208
01:06:06,181 --> 01:06:08,601
Big, like mainsail, huh?

1209
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:14,555
The boat tipped again.

1210
01:06:16,512 --> 01:06:18,300
Gosh, I told you I'd get one, didn't I?

1211
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:21,082
By golly. My little fish catch
fish bigger than he is.

1212
01:06:21,149 --> 01:06:22,937
I feel my whiskers disappear now.

1213
01:06:23,004 --> 01:06:25,010
I told you we'd beat Long Jack and Nate,
didn't I?

1214
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:26,512
Sure, we beat everybody.

1215
01:06:26,586 --> 01:06:29,073
Manuel and his little fish,
they beat everybody.

1216
01:06:29,146 --> 01:06:31,730
We make fisherman out of you,
huh, little fish?

1217
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:36,338
What chicken-livered squid done this?

1218
01:06:37,429 --> 01:06:39,916
Easy, Jack, them hooks!

1219
01:06:40,404 --> 01:06:42,988
Hey, Long Jack. What's the matter?

1220
01:06:43,058 --> 01:06:46,536
We were putting out our second tub,
and Jack was snagged overside.

1221
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:49,671
He might as well
have fastened to an octopus.

1222
01:06:49,774 --> 01:06:51,912
- Get him a knife.
- Cut him off.

1223
01:06:56,075 --> 01:06:58,278
Nate, I think
you need new dorymate, maybe.

1224
01:06:58,346 --> 01:07:00,003
One what's good fisherman.

1225
01:07:00,297 --> 01:07:02,914
Maybe next time you get one
what ain't old lady...

1226
01:07:02,984 --> 01:07:05,700
...what gets all mixed up
with knitting needles, huh?

1227
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:08,606
- That Long Jack, he is mad.
- I knew he would be.

1228
01:07:08,677 --> 01:07:11,097
That will stop him fishing for a while,
I guess.

1229
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:12,632
What you mean you knew?

1230
01:07:12,707 --> 01:07:14,942
When I heard you betting last night
with Long Jack...

1231
01:07:15,009 --> 01:07:17,626
...I sneaked up on deck
and tangled up his trawl.

1232
01:07:17,696 --> 01:07:18,677
What you do?

1233
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:22,197
Sure. I put some knots in it
and took a lot of bait off the hooks.

1234
01:07:27,867 --> 01:07:29,524
What are you going to do?

1235
01:07:31,705 --> 01:07:34,453
You still alive and strong, huh?
That good.

1236
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:36,431
You go back. You tell other fish:...

1237
01:07:36,502 --> 01:07:38,290
..."Manuel ain't got no fisherman
in his boat.

1238
01:07:38,357 --> 01:07:40,690
He got no dorymate.
He just got cheat".

1239
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,853
And I no catch big, strong, honest fish
like you that way.

1240
01:07:45,457 --> 01:07:47,212
Tell them good and loud.

1241
01:07:47,569 --> 01:07:51,757
Oh, but, Manuel, I just wanted us...
I just wanted you to win. That's all.

1242
01:07:58,155 --> 01:08:00,325
Well, what have we got here?

1243
01:08:00,394 --> 01:08:04,582
What's the matter? I don't remember
hoisting no signal to come aboard.

1244
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,231
We lose something.
Something we never have, I think.

1245
01:08:07,302 --> 01:08:10,083
This kid, he no like our way fishing.
He want come back.

1246
01:08:10,149 --> 01:08:12,319
Manuel, won't you listen?

1247
01:08:12,387 --> 01:08:15,288
You give him hand, maybe.
He got no way cheat himself overside.

1248
01:08:15,362 --> 01:08:17,499
Come on, son. Kid, come here.

1249
01:08:26,876 --> 01:08:28,468
Don't like fishing, son?

1250
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:33,198
What happens... What do you do when
people don't speak to you around here?

1251
01:08:33,273 --> 01:08:35,693
Now, you have
to settle that yourself, son.

1252
01:08:36,151 --> 01:08:39,249
I'm skipper to a crew,
but I ain't dry-nursing them.

1253
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:41,355
I don't take no part in squabbles.

1254
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:44,775
They settle that between themselves,
just like everything else.

1255
01:08:45,298 --> 01:08:48,166
Whatever's foul between you
and Manuel...

1256
01:08:48,241 --> 01:08:50,727
...you will have to free
and clear yourself.

1257
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:02,177
Hey, Doc.

1258
01:09:31,962 --> 01:09:33,935
Yes, sir, that sure do beat all.

1259
01:09:34,073 --> 01:09:36,974
- What was he saying about me?
- He don't say nothing about you.

1260
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:39,316
Just got a new funny story, that's all.

1261
01:09:52,496 --> 01:09:55,080
You should have come
aboard this morning, Jack.

1262
01:09:55,182 --> 01:09:57,669
These things are worked in
pretty deep now.

1263
01:09:57,741 --> 01:09:59,779
And lose a day's fishing? No, sir.

1264
01:09:59,851 --> 01:10:01,639
That's what somebody expected me to do.

1265
01:10:01,706 --> 01:10:04,039
No yellow-livered job is going to keep me
from doing my share...

1266
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:05,217
...or winning a bet, either.

1267
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:07,295
I can pull this one through, Jack...

1268
01:10:07,367 --> 01:10:09,471
...but I'm afraid
I'm going to have to cut the others.

1269
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:10,556
Fine.

1270
01:10:11,686 --> 01:10:14,880
Here's the bet, Jack. I pay prompt, huh?

1271
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,215
I'll take it
'cause I won it fair and square.

1272
01:10:17,282 --> 01:10:19,648
That's a sight more than you tried to be.

1273
01:10:19,778 --> 01:10:20,987
You crazy, Jack.

1274
01:10:21,056 --> 01:10:23,030
You don't think I fouled your trawl?

1275
01:10:23,104 --> 01:10:24,696
That trawl fouled itself, maybe?

1276
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,067
I been handling trawl for 20 years,
Portegoosie...

1277
01:10:27,133 --> 01:10:30,645
...and I never seen line snarl itself
that way, except by human hands.

1278
01:10:31,419 --> 01:10:33,687
Well, maybe you too anxious
to win bet, Jack, huh?

1279
01:10:33,754 --> 01:10:35,608
Maybe you no keep your mind on things.

1280
01:10:35,673 --> 01:10:37,047
Listen, Portegoosie.

1281
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:39,500
Either you or that kid done it.
It stands to reason.

1282
01:10:39,575 --> 01:10:41,647
If I found he put
his Jonah flippers into my trawl...

1283
01:10:41,718 --> 01:10:45,513
...I'll wind him twice around
the capstan and break him off short.

1284
01:10:46,323 --> 01:10:49,671
I think you put hooks in yourself
so you got chance to drink more rum, huh?

1285
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,174
You call me a cheat?

1286
01:10:53,904 --> 01:10:57,284
Jack, you talk too loud,
you drink too much rum, huh?

1287
01:10:57,357 --> 01:10:58,818
I'll discover right now who done it.

1288
01:10:58,893 --> 01:11:01,379
Or, by thunder, I'll cut hooks out of you
where there ain't none.

1289
01:11:01,451 --> 01:11:02,760
Jack, you hurt your arm.

1290
01:11:02,827 --> 01:11:04,004
Don't, Long Jack, don't.

1291
01:11:04,074 --> 01:11:07,367
It wasn't Manuel. I did it. I did it last
night while you were having supper.

1292
01:11:07,432 --> 01:11:09,798
But I didn't mean you should get
the hooks in your arm this way.

1293
01:11:09,863 --> 01:11:10,877
Honest, I didn't.

1294
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:12,804
I just thought we'd have a little fun
and win...

1295
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:14,691
- Why, you sneaking little...
- Jack, what you do?

1296
01:11:14,757 --> 01:11:15,869
You keep out of this, Portegoosie.

1297
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,393
Oh, Long Jack, what do you worry about?

1298
01:11:18,466 --> 01:11:20,953
He admit the whole thing
like regular grown fella.

1299
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:23,032
He say he sorry.
Everything all right now.

1300
01:11:23,105 --> 01:11:26,234
Nothing's all right till I beat
his ears off. Get out of my...

1301
01:11:26,302 --> 01:11:28,756
- You touch that kid, I tear you apart, see?
- Yeah?

1302
01:11:28,829 --> 01:11:31,511
Me, Manuel talking.
I tear you apart, see?

1303
01:11:32,379 --> 01:11:35,760
So don't get me mad, Long Jack.
I get all crazy and sick inside.

1304
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,828
All right, start cutting, Disko.

1305
01:11:45,812 --> 01:11:48,746
Maybe he cut picture of your girl
out there. Huh, Jack?

1306
01:11:48,883 --> 01:11:51,369
I am telling you, Manuel,
keep that kid away from me.

1307
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:52,455
He's a...

1308
01:11:52,721 --> 01:11:55,272
He's a Jonah, and you'll find
this is only the beginning.

1309
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:23,776
What's the matter, little fish,
you sleepy?

1310
01:12:23,841 --> 01:12:26,228
- I'm so ashamed, Manuel.
- Sure.

1311
01:12:26,591 --> 01:12:28,216
We all got be ashamed once.

1312
01:12:28,286 --> 01:12:31,252
So we don't do things again
what we got be ashamed of, see?

1313
01:12:31,325 --> 01:12:33,560
Yes, but you not speaking to me...

1314
01:12:33,627 --> 01:12:35,731
...and those hooks in Jack's arm...

1315
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:40,109
Jack, he very tough man.

1316
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:42,961
All fishermen have hooks in them.

1317
01:12:43,031 --> 01:12:45,331
Oh, sure. Two, three, four hooks.

1318
01:12:45,781 --> 01:12:48,081
My father,
he have hook in his arm right here.

1319
01:12:48,148 --> 01:12:50,798
And three year later, he think
he have pimple on back of his neck.

1320
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:52,208
You know what was it?

1321
01:12:52,274 --> 01:12:53,996
Hook coming out.

1322
01:12:54,736 --> 01:12:58,728
And my father, he say, "So that's what's
been in Denmark all this time, huh?"

1323
01:13:02,029 --> 01:13:03,076
That fine.

1324
01:13:06,987 --> 01:13:10,945
<i>There's a school of fish
Way down deep in the sea</i>

1325
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:14,560
<i>Where the little fish
Studied geography</i>

1326
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:16,738
My father, he teach me this song.

1327
01:13:16,805 --> 01:13:18,876
And I put your kind of words to it.

1328
01:13:19,363 --> 01:13:23,038
<i>There they write on a slate
And they read from a book</i>

1329
01:13:23,138 --> 01:13:26,682
<i>Learn to run with the bait
Then just leave them the hook</i>

1330
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,827
I got to sing every time I get mad.

1331
01:13:28,895 --> 01:13:31,992
It drive those flying fish
out of my stomach, do you know?

1332
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:36,280
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

1333
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:39,987
<i>You'll be a baleia
By-and-by</i>

1334
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,939
<i>Baleia, that mean big fish...</i>

1335
01:13:42,008 --> 01:13:43,567
...like whale, you know?

1336
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:48,147
<i>With fins and a tail
To help you sail</i>

1337
01:13:48,245 --> 01:13:51,592
<i>And maybe some wings
To help you fly</i>

1338
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:55,243
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

1339
01:13:55,313 --> 01:13:58,312
<i>Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry</i>

1340
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:33,401
Here's Disko. Cod must be coming.
Hello, friend!

1341
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,217
- Hiya, James!
- Come on over.

1342
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:40,853
<i>There the Blue Gill.
She's from Gloucester, same as us.</i>

1343
01:14:41,721 --> 01:14:45,778
<i>And there's the Elizabeth K. Brown.
She sail good when the skipper he is sober.</i>

1344
01:14:45,847 --> 01:14:49,042
<i>There the Flying Swan.
She drag her anchor all time.</i>

1345
01:14:49,141 --> 01:14:51,115
Everybody comes here
and fishes last...

1346
01:14:51,188 --> 01:14:53,227
...because it's the biggest
and best bank, huh?

1347
01:14:53,299 --> 01:14:55,915
Sure. Only some come too soon,
some come too late.

1348
01:14:55,985 --> 01:14:58,406
Disko, he come right with codfish, see?

1349
01:14:59,888 --> 01:15:01,294
- Say...
- Look, look, look!

1350
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:04,969
There Virgin Rock I tell you about.
Now watch, watch, she gonna roar.

1351
01:15:06,476 --> 01:15:08,329
Say, that's the bottom of the ocean.

1352
01:15:08,395 --> 01:15:12,102
Sure. She get lonesome sometimes.
She come up for a little look around.

1353
01:15:12,201 --> 01:15:16,389
Yes, sirs, by thunder, there she is.

1354
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:20,004
<i>I think that Jennie Cushman
she filled with fish already.</i>

1355
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:21,693
She beat us home, huh, Disko?

1356
01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:26,235
He got here too early.
The real run ain't started yet.

1357
01:15:26,306 --> 01:15:30,875
By this time tomorrow, we'll be fishing
72-hour stretches, hand line.

1358
01:15:31,264 --> 01:15:34,426
The cod will be covering
this bank like herring.

1359
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:39,576
Walt Cushman beats me into Gloucester,
I'll hang myself with an eel.

1360
01:15:40,027 --> 01:15:44,726
Hey, at the wheel, there. Downwind!

1361
01:15:53,012 --> 01:15:57,581
All right, up, up, up. Hurry.

1362
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:36,182
Pick it up. That thing's squirming.

1363
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:39,894
Bring him in, Danny boy, bring him in.

1364
01:17:39,964 --> 01:17:42,930
In case some of them
ain't expecting this.

1365
01:17:43,003 --> 01:17:45,554
We're full up and ready for home.

1366
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:53,620
Hey, little fish, that's for us. Disko say
we all full up and we go home. Come on.

1367
01:17:58,195 --> 01:18:01,063
Hey, pitch up that last fish, Manuel.

1368
01:18:01,169 --> 01:18:04,331
Then you and Harvey's
going to take me a-visiting.

1369
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:05,893
- Hey, Daniel?
- Yes, sir.

1370
01:18:05,966 --> 01:18:09,543
As soon enough hands come aboard,
tell them to turn to...

1371
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:12,032
- ...and heave up that anchor short.
- Yes, sir.

1372
01:18:12,267 --> 01:18:14,567
Hey, aboard the vessel.

1373
01:18:14,794 --> 01:18:19,461
<i>Would anyone on the Flying Swan be
wanting to send any mail to Gloucester?</i>

1374
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:22,403
We got sickness aboard.
We're heading for home.

1375
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,672
Go on, Disko Troop.
You and your sickness.

1376
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,649
You're just crowing, that's all.

1377
01:18:26,755 --> 01:18:29,656
No, we all catch too many fish, too soon.

1378
01:18:29,762 --> 01:18:31,136
We all sick about it.

1379
01:18:31,201 --> 01:18:32,956
Well, some of the lads
expected you, Disko.

1380
01:18:33,024 --> 01:18:34,267
You could mail those, if you will.

1381
01:18:34,336 --> 01:18:36,571
It's a pleasure
to be postman to you, Benjamin.

1382
01:18:36,639 --> 01:18:38,842
Why don't you
sign up with me next season...

1383
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:41,942
...and get home
before the snow flies?

1384
01:18:42,588 --> 01:18:45,074
I know what you're going to say, Disko.

1385
01:18:45,402 --> 01:18:47,343
I don't want none of your sarcasm.

1386
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:49,968
We heard your bell and saw your flag.

1387
01:18:50,072 --> 01:18:52,176
I hope you founder with all hands.

1388
01:18:52,759 --> 01:18:55,179
It's nice to have your good wishes, John.

1389
01:18:55,349 --> 01:18:56,428
Hey, Disko.

1390
01:18:57,459 --> 01:18:59,433
If our new baby is born
before I get back...

1391
01:18:59,507 --> 01:19:01,710
...talk Molly out of naming him
Hubert will you?

1392
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:05,071
- She wants to call him Hubert.
- Another baby, Martin?

1393
01:19:05,168 --> 01:19:07,622
Well, you ought to stay at sea
all the time.

1394
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,502
That's what he do if he stay
on this boat.

1395
01:19:11,148 --> 01:19:14,442
<i>Hey, there! Aboard the Bluegill.</i>

1396
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:16,512
Any mail for Gloucester?

1397
01:19:16,746 --> 01:19:19,527
Kind of late starting the crew,
ain't you, Disko?

1398
01:19:19,816 --> 01:19:23,328
Well, I just thought
I'd like to carry your mail, Peter.

1399
01:19:23,654 --> 01:19:27,002
<i>We just come back from rowing our mail
over to the Jennie Cushman.</i>

1400
01:19:27,076 --> 01:19:30,490
- That's a poor attempt at a joke, Peter.
- Yeah?

1401
01:19:31,074 --> 01:19:32,830
Does that look like a joke?

1402
01:19:35,712 --> 01:19:39,125
Why the sneaking sand shark.

1403
01:19:39,518 --> 01:19:41,525
Never ring a bell nor nothing.

1404
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:45,460
Never give us no sign
he was going to swing off today.

1405
01:19:45,787 --> 01:19:48,437
Get back to the vessel.
Give me them oars.

1406
01:19:48,506 --> 01:19:51,374
- But I can...
- Well, go on then. Put your back into it.

1407
01:19:51,832 --> 01:19:53,936
Hey, aboard the vessel.

1408
01:19:54,742 --> 01:19:58,515
- Get that anchor in!
- Hey, what's eating Disko?

1409
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:01,840
<i>- Is he liquored?
- Aye on that. It's the Cushman.</i>

1410
01:20:04,305 --> 01:20:06,541
Pull up your foresail.

1411
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:11,844
<i>Hey, Disko.
Here comes the Cushman.</i>

1412
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:15,363
You don't think I took it
for a waterspout, do you?

1413
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:17,731
Hey, get that anchor in.

1414
01:20:17,834 --> 01:20:22,566
A-heave, a-ho. A-heave, a-ho.
A-heave, a-ho. A-heave, a-ho.

1415
01:20:23,943 --> 01:20:28,163
Goodbye, Disko. What's the matter?
Have you run aground?

1416
01:20:29,252 --> 01:20:32,698
You haven't any mail for Gloucester,
have you, sir?

1417
01:20:34,114 --> 01:20:37,374
If you'd save your wind
to fill your sails...

1418
01:20:37,472 --> 01:20:40,089
...you might keep us
from passing you.

1419
01:20:40,286 --> 01:20:42,870
<i>- We're going to race the Jennie Cushman?
- Sure.</i>

1420
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:51,535
Come on.
This fine kind racing business.

1421
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,938
You got that
backside anxious business, huh?

1422
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:56,275
You gonna row or swim
to Gloucester, maybe.

1423
01:20:56,342 --> 01:20:58,729
This fine time diving and swimming.

1424
01:21:03,251 --> 01:21:05,355
Put your back into that windlass.

1425
01:21:05,522 --> 01:21:09,480
You don't think that anchor's going
to float up out of the water, do you?

1426
01:21:10,511 --> 01:21:12,266
Sway up on them halyards...

1427
01:21:12,366 --> 01:21:14,753
...and you needn't be afeared
of parting them.

1428
01:21:15,212 --> 01:21:19,520
Wipe down them dories.
We're going to bury her nose this trip.

1429
01:21:22,984 --> 01:21:25,983
I can't work with this in me.
Pull it through, will you?

1430
01:21:30,117 --> 01:21:33,050
- Start hollering. Nobody hear you.
- I haven't the time.

1431
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:46,645
Now stick that in your face
and suck blood out.

1432
01:21:46,716 --> 01:21:47,795
Anchor all clear.

1433
01:21:47,867 --> 01:21:49,971
Get it aboard and cathead it.

1434
01:21:50,425 --> 01:21:52,661
On your main halyards now.

1435
01:21:57,622 --> 01:21:59,247
Sway up that mainsail!

1436
01:21:59,349 --> 01:22:01,258
Come on, sway her up.

1437
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:05,961
Two blocks is where I want to see her.
Come on!

1438
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:19,048
She's got a good lead on us, Capt. Disko.

1439
01:22:19,115 --> 01:22:22,113
Yeah. Got his topsails set already.

1440
01:22:22,217 --> 01:22:24,899
Running like a scared sardine.

1441
01:22:25,288 --> 01:22:29,628
I'll climb over his stern rail
or sail the bottom out of us.

1442
01:22:31,525 --> 01:22:33,280
She's stepping now.

1443
01:22:35,043 --> 01:22:37,376
Just look at this lady go.

1444
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,496
It's awful heavy going, Disko.

1445
01:22:49,563 --> 01:22:52,409
If a big one ever hits her
when she's heeled over like this...

1446
01:22:52,474 --> 01:22:56,149
Don't you worry about this little lady.
She can take care of herself.

1447
01:23:04,019 --> 01:23:06,407
I told you so. Now what'll I do?

1448
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:10,158
Ease her off a bit. Give her a hand.

1449
01:23:10,224 --> 01:23:11,598
She'll right herself.

1450
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,281
Disko must have
picked up an engine someplace.

1451
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,832
Yeah. Well, wait till tonight.

1452
01:23:39,937 --> 01:23:42,325
I'm shortcutting across Franklin Shoals.

1453
01:23:42,624 --> 01:23:44,924
He won't dare follow me with his draft.

1454
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:50,004
- Six fathom.
- Six fathom. Yes, sir...

1455
01:23:50,075 --> 01:23:54,067
...he's taking a shortcut across this bank,
and thinking I'm going to get scared...

1456
01:23:54,138 --> 01:23:57,170
...and swing her off.
Well, I'll cut shorter.

1457
01:23:57,496 --> 01:24:00,047
Five fathom.

1458
01:24:00,886 --> 01:24:03,274
They're feeling for the bottom,
all right.

1459
01:24:03,764 --> 01:24:07,024
- Five fathom.
- He can do it with that hull of his, Disko.

1460
01:24:07,123 --> 01:24:09,195
<i>But we draw more water
than the Cushman, don't we?</i>

1461
01:24:09,265 --> 01:24:11,719
I know what water we draw.
You keep her to it.

1462
01:24:11,792 --> 01:24:13,318
Three-and-a-half fathom.

1463
01:24:13,391 --> 01:24:16,204
Hey, Disko, you ain't been looking down
the neck of a jug again, have you?

1464
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:19,018
Now listen here, farmer,
I can draw 16 feet of water...

1465
01:24:19,085 --> 01:24:20,993
...and not find bottom, can't I?

1466
01:24:21,164 --> 01:24:24,839
I ain't ripping out no keels,
but I'm going to beat Walt Cushman...

1467
01:24:24,905 --> 01:24:28,994
...into Gloucester and that's all there
is to it. So don't you swing her off.

1468
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:34,179
Why, I know this bottom
as well as my wife knows her own kitchen.

1469
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:37,627
- You keep her to it now.
- I'm with you, Capt. Troop.

1470
01:24:38,722 --> 01:24:39,966
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1471
01:24:51,036 --> 01:24:53,904
I'll bet old Walt's hot
under his hatches.

1472
01:24:56,665 --> 01:24:59,533
- Shake your bustle, little woman.
- Yes, sir.

1473
01:25:09,106 --> 01:25:12,236
Manuel, we're gonna pass them soon.

1474
01:25:12,657 --> 01:25:16,364
Oh, sure. That Disko, he pass anything.
He half porpoise, I think, huh?

1475
01:25:16,622 --> 01:25:18,050
What are you doing?

1476
01:25:18,797 --> 01:25:21,643
I figure up how much
I get my share fish in there.

1477
01:25:21,772 --> 01:25:25,861
If market price good, say four-and-a-half,
five cents pound, Manuel, he get...

1478
01:25:27,976 --> 01:25:29,863
By golly, I gonna have lots of money.

1479
01:25:29,928 --> 01:25:32,447
And with my $3 a month,
I'll have $9, won't I?

1480
01:25:32,519 --> 01:25:34,306
Sure. We very rich men, now, huh?

1481
01:25:34,373 --> 01:25:36,609
We have fun spending it
when we go ashore, you and me, huh?

1482
01:25:36,676 --> 01:25:39,740
- What will you do ashore?
- Well, first I gotta go church store.

1483
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:43,224
You know, where you buy
a crucifix and Madonna and things.

1484
01:25:43,713 --> 01:25:47,027
And I buy a little two-place
gold candlestick I see there...

1485
01:25:47,103 --> 01:25:50,069
...that I take to church, and I light
candles for my father's birthday.

1486
01:25:50,142 --> 01:25:51,897
3rd this month, August.

1487
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:53,882
Oh, that's very nice, Manuel.

1488
01:25:54,427 --> 01:25:56,946
Not so nice as my father
should have, maybe.

1489
01:25:57,241 --> 01:25:58,899
It's nice in small way.

1490
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,871
I think maybe
I light candle for myself, too.

1491
01:26:01,943 --> 01:26:05,237
- I have few bad thoughts this trip.
- You never had any bad thoughts.

1492
01:26:05,301 --> 01:26:07,056
- Oh, sure.
- What were they?

1493
01:26:08,212 --> 01:26:11,723
- I forget them now but I have them I think.
- Then what will you do?

1494
01:26:13,105 --> 01:26:16,235
Oh, then I get dressed up.
Oh, I go to get nifty suit.

1495
01:26:16,336 --> 01:26:18,985
You know, purple-colored.
Oh, very nifty suit.

1496
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:22,980
With cloth-topped shoes to match,
you know? And big pearl buttons.

1497
01:26:23,148 --> 01:26:25,732
And then I get new tie
with big yellow flowers.

1498
01:26:27,306 --> 01:26:31,046
Then I walk up and down Duncan Street,
and I say, "Hey, girls, girls...

1499
01:26:31,463 --> 01:26:34,691
- ...hey, look, look. Manuel is in town".
- Girls?

1500
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:38,944
Oh, sure. Beautiful girls. I got
maybe five, six girls in Gloucester.

1501
01:26:39,012 --> 01:26:41,858
I tell each one I like her best.
You gotta tell big lies to girls...

1502
01:26:41,922 --> 01:26:44,604
- ...to make them happy.
- You don't go with the girls?

1503
01:26:44,705 --> 01:26:47,518
Oh, sure I go with girls.
Every man go with...

1504
01:26:50,718 --> 01:26:53,716
I guess maybe you're right.

1505
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:56,536
- I don't go with girls.
- I kind of thought you were kidding.

1506
01:26:56,603 --> 01:27:00,213
Oh, sure, sure.
That girl business is all kidding. Sure.

1507
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,107
I think maybe I gotta do
some more kidding from now on, huh?

1508
01:27:07,573 --> 01:27:10,288
Here we talk all time about what I do.
What you do?

1509
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:14,248
You talk to your father on telephone, huh?
You tell him you live and happy, huh?

1510
01:27:14,322 --> 01:27:15,663
My father?

1511
01:27:16,688 --> 01:27:19,436
You forgot about your father
what own that big boat you fall off...

1512
01:27:19,503 --> 01:27:22,371
...and he think maybe you swallowed up
by shark or something.

1513
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,354
Oh, well, I don't know.

1514
01:27:25,099 --> 01:27:27,041
You don't know how happy he be, huh?

1515
01:27:27,114 --> 01:27:31,335
- Oh, I guess he'll be glad, all right.
- He leave his skin, I think.

1516
01:27:31,464 --> 01:27:34,310
He hug you to pieces and take
those pieces back home with him, huh?

1517
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:36,763
But I don't want to go back home, Manuel.

1518
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:38,912
You don't want go home?

1519
01:27:39,013 --> 01:27:41,084
Well, I mean...

1520
01:27:42,978 --> 01:27:44,865
What do you mean, little fish?

1521
01:27:45,217 --> 01:27:49,209
I want to stay here with you in Gloucester
and go out fishing again this way.

1522
01:27:50,207 --> 01:27:51,962
You want be fisherman?

1523
01:27:52,542 --> 01:27:55,388
I want to be a better fisherman
than Tom Platt or Dan.

1524
01:27:55,452 --> 01:27:57,458
I want to be as good as you are.

1525
01:27:57,883 --> 01:27:59,289
As good as me, huh?

1526
01:28:00,378 --> 01:28:03,158
Oh, that very nice, little fish.

1527
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,973
But how about your father? He come, too?

1528
01:28:06,518 --> 01:28:10,891
Oh, well, I could see him between trips,
if he wants to see me.

1529
01:28:11,763 --> 01:28:14,544
What you mean,
if he want to see you, little fish?

1530
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:18,764
Oh, well, he's got his business
and everything. He'd be all right.

1531
01:28:25,484 --> 01:28:27,370
I want to be with you, Manuel.

1532
01:28:31,977 --> 01:28:33,024
Please.

1533
01:28:40,196 --> 01:28:41,657
My little fish.

1534
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:48,057
If you all want to see a boat what's
going to be passed, come and see one.

1535
01:28:56,764 --> 01:29:00,952
Hold her to it, Manuel.
We'll lay her right alongside them.

1536
01:29:04,184 --> 01:29:06,670
It will be the best boat from here in.

1537
01:29:07,734 --> 01:29:11,693
I'll take a reach for his beard
as we pass by.

1538
01:29:16,274 --> 01:29:18,826
Them topsails will carry away
if we keep this up.

1539
01:29:18,897 --> 01:29:22,604
I'll take the lower spars out of her
before I'll let Walt Cushman...

1540
01:29:22,702 --> 01:29:25,156
...work the windward of me.

1541
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:27,397
She's driving now.

1542
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:31,455
Yes, sir! Walk along, little girlie.

1543
01:29:38,566 --> 01:29:41,314
They're coming now, Walt!
I guess they got us.

1544
01:29:41,605 --> 01:29:45,247
No, he ain't! There's more than one way
to open a clam.

1545
01:29:45,538 --> 01:29:47,610
Stand by to come about!

1546
01:29:54,398 --> 01:29:57,626
What's this? Disko, he coming about.

1547
01:29:58,012 --> 01:30:00,083
For more funny business, I think.

1548
01:30:02,042 --> 01:30:04,790
Why, the calm-weather coward!

1549
01:30:05,017 --> 01:30:09,422
Can't take an honest licking.
Try and bluff me, will he?

1550
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,637
Stand by the main sheet!

1551
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:13,616
Steady, Manuel.

1552
01:30:16,242 --> 01:30:19,470
Now watch him jump and holler
when he has to give way.

1553
01:30:20,209 --> 01:30:22,477
I'm gonna cut plumb across his bow!

1554
01:30:28,684 --> 01:30:32,228
- Give away to her, Disko.
- Well, I ain't giving way, neither.

1555
01:30:32,362 --> 01:30:35,590
- You've got to budge.
- I'll budge like a barnacle.

1556
01:30:35,657 --> 01:30:37,030
She'll cut us down, sure.

1557
01:30:40,582 --> 01:30:44,835
- Steady as you go!
- Hold her to it, Manuel! Don't lose an inch.

1558
01:30:50,145 --> 01:30:52,446
Land sakes, Disko, here she comes!

1559
01:30:55,615 --> 01:30:57,075
Hard to starboard!

1560
01:31:04,057 --> 01:31:07,089
I had the right of way,
you old beach goat!

1561
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:11,860
- You must have mislaid it somewhere!
- Still riding anchor, ain't you?

1562
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:17,328
Well, we ain't to Gloucester yet. I'll do
more than keep you in sight, Disko!

1563
01:31:17,779 --> 01:31:21,868
<i>Capt. Cushman is a sailor
But he should have been a tailor</i>

1564
01:31:21,969 --> 01:31:25,927
<i>Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man</i>

1565
01:31:26,286 --> 01:31:30,724
<i>Cushman might have been a grocer
But a first-class seaman, no, sir</i>

1566
01:31:30,796 --> 01:31:34,177
<i>Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man</i>

1567
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:02,227
Poor old Walt broke his jib,
and he's checking his topsails.

1568
01:32:02,299 --> 01:32:05,876
You'll best do the same, Disko.
That main top'll go if you don't.

1569
01:32:05,977 --> 01:32:10,612
Well, since you're such a nervous galoot,
and we got old Walt licked to a frazzle...

1570
01:32:10,712 --> 01:32:12,598
I'll mind what you say.

1571
01:32:21,266 --> 01:32:24,647
Go aloft with Jack, Manuel.
Stand by to try the topsails.

1572
01:32:24,752 --> 01:32:27,239
I go up to get a little air,
I think, maybe?

1573
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:28,836
Want to luff her first?

1574
01:32:28,909 --> 01:32:31,363
I'll luff her when you reach
the masthead.

1575
01:32:34,219 --> 01:32:37,119
Somebody open window
and let in nice breeze, eh, Jack?

1576
01:32:37,705 --> 01:32:40,835
I'll bet Manuel is the best fisherman
in the whole fishing fleet, isn't he?

1577
01:32:49,891 --> 01:32:52,672
Stand by to clue up the fore topsails!

1578
01:32:56,319 --> 01:33:00,092
- Step lively up there now!
- Slack away below!

1579
01:33:10,488 --> 01:33:12,626
Hey! Look out for yourselves!

1580
01:33:12,727 --> 01:33:14,068
- Watch it!
- Manuel!

1581
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:18,318
Jump down!

1582
01:33:23,185 --> 01:33:24,559
Manuel!

1583
01:33:27,312 --> 01:33:28,740
Luff her, Nate!

1584
01:33:28,815 --> 01:33:31,115
In heaven's name, Nate, luff her.

1585
01:33:31,181 --> 01:33:32,587
I can't, she's jibing!

1586
01:33:32,653 --> 01:33:34,823
Hold fast, Manuel!

1587
01:33:48,388 --> 01:33:49,881
Manuel! Manuel!

1588
01:33:51,491 --> 01:33:53,759
Get a dory overside!

1589
01:33:54,465 --> 01:33:56,220
Are you all right, Manuel?

1590
01:33:56,672 --> 01:33:58,045
Can you work free?

1591
01:34:02,173 --> 01:34:04,059
Doc!

1592
01:34:11,384 --> 01:34:12,561
Capt. Disko!

1593
01:34:12,664 --> 01:34:14,867
We'll get you out of this
in a minute, Portegoosie!

1594
01:34:14,935 --> 01:34:18,795
He says he's good as dead. Gone.
He knows it.

1595
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,426
Why, Doc? Why?

1596
01:34:20,532 --> 01:34:23,759
He's stove in.
All the bottom half of him's gone.

1597
01:34:23,858 --> 01:34:25,864
But he don't want the kid to know.

1598
01:34:25,937 --> 01:34:28,783
You're all right, aren't you, Manuel?
You aren't hurt, are you?

1599
01:34:28,847 --> 01:34:30,951
I all right, little fish.

1600
01:34:31,086 --> 01:34:33,224
What's holding up that dory?

1601
01:34:33,357 --> 01:34:37,316
Disko, don't put dory overside!
You hear what Doc...

1602
01:34:37,387 --> 01:34:39,458
But we've got to free you, Manuel.

1603
01:34:39,562 --> 01:34:42,244
No. I say don't put dory overside!

1604
01:34:42,313 --> 01:34:44,995
What's he mean?
What's the matter, Manuel? Manuel!

1605
01:34:45,063 --> 01:34:47,745
Hey, Harvey! Harvey, mind the boy!

1606
01:34:47,845 --> 01:34:50,659
No, not out here. Go back.

1607
01:34:50,884 --> 01:34:53,730
You're all right, aren't you?
You aren't hurt, are you, Manuel?

1608
01:34:53,794 --> 01:34:54,841
I all right.

1609
01:34:54,914 --> 01:34:56,887
Get that dory in the water.

1610
01:34:57,632 --> 01:35:01,111
I can't do nothing, Disko.
He's fouled in the backstay.

1611
01:35:01,183 --> 01:35:02,970
Manuel!

1612
01:35:03,422 --> 01:35:05,243
The drift's tightening, Disko.

1613
01:35:05,308 --> 01:35:08,154
You'll have to cut him loose,
or it'll take him in half.

1614
01:35:08,219 --> 01:35:09,201
No.

1615
01:35:09,434 --> 01:35:13,425
We ain't cutting loose unless
it's going to help you free Manuel.

1616
01:35:13,496 --> 01:35:15,764
You cut him away, Disko, you hear me?

1617
01:35:15,991 --> 01:35:17,267
Get me an ax!

1618
01:35:17,334 --> 01:35:19,340
No, Capt. Disko. No!

1619
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:21,551
You cut that line, it'll carry him under.

1620
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:26,090
We can't just keep him out there
till the line saws him in half.

1621
01:35:26,161 --> 01:35:28,167
Get me an ax.

1622
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:38,282
I sorry about race, Disko.

1623
01:35:38,379 --> 01:35:40,352
You beat him next year, huh?

1624
01:35:45,767 --> 01:35:46,879
Manuel!

1625
01:35:46,951 --> 01:35:48,325
Now listen, little fish...

1626
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:50,909
I go now and fish with my father.

1627
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:55,488
You remember I tell you
he keep seat for me in his dory.

1628
01:35:55,554 --> 01:35:58,520
What are you talking about?
You're not going. We'll save you.

1629
01:35:58,592 --> 01:36:01,112
We have good times together,
eh, little fish?

1630
01:36:01,535 --> 01:36:04,600
We laugh, we sing, so you smile now.

1631
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,354
Come on, smile.

1632
01:36:06,429 --> 01:36:10,201
Long Jack can fix it.
You'll be all right. See, Manuel?

1633
01:36:10,394 --> 01:36:11,473
Good.

1634
01:36:13,241 --> 01:36:17,908
Manuel, he be watching you. You'll
be best fisherman ever, little fish.

1635
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:22,036
No, no, Manuel. No.

1636
01:36:25,427 --> 01:36:27,760
Manuel!

1637
01:36:52,485 --> 01:36:54,622
Well, goodbye again, Harvey.

1638
01:36:54,979 --> 01:36:56,472
So long, sailor.

1639
01:37:06,877 --> 01:37:08,818
Going down to get your pay, Harv?

1640
01:37:08,892 --> 01:37:11,924
I guess so.
You're leaving too, huh, Long Jack?

1641
01:37:11,995 --> 01:37:13,204
Yep.

1642
01:37:14,617 --> 01:37:17,965
You'll begin to grow whiskers right soon,
and I thought maybe this might be...

1643
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:20,242
...a good thing for you to start in with.

1644
01:37:20,566 --> 01:37:22,834
Thanks. Thanks, Long Jack.

1645
01:37:22,933 --> 01:37:26,411
You've just got fuzz now, but if you start
scraping them off they'll toughen up...

1646
01:37:26,483 --> 01:37:28,522
...and get like... Get like...

1647
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:30,764
Fair weather, Harv.

1648
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,999
Goodbye, Long Jack.

1649
01:37:43,146 --> 01:37:45,033
I got everything, I guess.

1650
01:37:45,129 --> 01:37:48,705
Yeah. Say, Dan, these clothes...

1651
01:37:48,839 --> 01:37:50,660
I guess I kind of wore them out some.

1652
01:37:50,727 --> 01:37:52,002
Oh, that's all right.

1653
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:54,970
Well, Dan, I'd like to keep them...

1654
01:37:55,075 --> 01:37:57,114
...but I can't pay you
out of my pay yet because...

1655
01:37:57,187 --> 01:38:00,088
...well, there's something I sort of
wanted to do. So I was just thinking...

1656
01:38:00,162 --> 01:38:03,324
There ain't no hurry. Your pop can settle it
with my mom when he gets here.

1657
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:06,260
Say, is he really flying out here
all that way? All in one day?

1658
01:38:06,335 --> 01:38:07,578
I guess so.

1659
01:38:07,677 --> 01:38:09,270
You sure got the laugh on all of us...

1660
01:38:09,341 --> 01:38:11,761
...him having all that money
you said he had and everything.

1661
01:38:11,836 --> 01:38:13,744
Say, Dan, when somebody...

1662
01:38:13,818 --> 01:38:15,857
...I mean,
when something happens to somebody...

1663
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,838
...what do they do
with the rest of their things?

1664
01:38:17,912 --> 01:38:21,041
Their family get them, I suppose,
or whatever kin they have.

1665
01:38:21,622 --> 01:38:23,531
Well, did he have any kin?

1666
01:38:23,669 --> 01:38:25,610
No, not that anybody knowed of.

1667
01:38:25,748 --> 01:38:28,016
Well...

1668
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:30,471
If someone liked someone a great deal...

1669
01:38:30,577 --> 01:38:34,797
...and he didn't have any kin, that would
sort of make him a kin almost, wouldn't it?

1670
01:38:35,055 --> 01:38:39,308
And, well, if they had something like
this, for instance, that wasn't worth a lot...

1671
01:38:39,373 --> 01:38:41,411
I don't know, Harvey.
You better ask Pop about that.

1672
01:38:41,483 --> 01:38:42,977
He'd know more about that.

1673
01:38:43,051 --> 01:38:44,032
Oh.

1674
01:38:46,409 --> 01:38:48,645
Well, boy, come to get your pay?

1675
01:38:48,712 --> 01:38:49,791
Why...

1676
01:38:49,895 --> 01:38:52,993
There you are,
our deal when you signed on.

1677
01:39:01,441 --> 01:39:02,717
Fisherman's Home?

1678
01:39:02,848 --> 01:39:06,425
Yeah, that's where the poor and old
and crippled of us...

1679
01:39:06,527 --> 01:39:10,137
...set on a sunny porch
and try to out-lie each other.

1680
01:39:10,268 --> 01:39:12,504
Manuel would want it that way.

1681
01:39:12,699 --> 01:39:15,861
You wouldn't have a better idea,
you think?

1682
01:39:15,994 --> 01:39:20,661
Well, he wanted to get a candlestick
for his father with two places.

1683
01:39:21,143 --> 01:39:22,549
How much would that cost?

1684
01:39:22,614 --> 01:39:25,133
Oh, $2 or $3, I reckon. Here.

1685
01:39:25,237 --> 01:39:26,927
Oh, then that's all right.

1686
01:39:27,028 --> 01:39:28,435
I have enough.

1687
01:39:28,692 --> 01:39:32,301
What'll you do with the rest
of Manuel's things, Capt. Disko?

1688
01:39:32,369 --> 01:39:35,717
Oh, we'll send them up along to the Home,
I guess.

1689
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:37,741
Does this have to go?

1690
01:39:38,702 --> 01:39:42,529
Why, no, Harvey.
I thought maybe you'd like to keep that.

1691
01:39:44,747 --> 01:39:47,167
Your daddy will be here directly.

1692
01:39:47,689 --> 01:39:50,470
You're kind of stretching to see him.
Ain't you?

1693
01:39:50,536 --> 01:39:51,812
Yes, sir.

1694
01:39:52,103 --> 01:39:54,557
When are you going out fishing again?

1695
01:39:54,661 --> 01:39:58,205
Oh, in about six weeks,
when we're shipshape aloft.

1696
01:39:58,308 --> 01:40:00,129
Well, will Dan go, too?

1697
01:40:00,227 --> 01:40:04,731
No, that's the winter season.
Dan'll stay here ashore, school.

1698
01:40:04,801 --> 01:40:07,516
Then you'll need someone
to take his place, won't you?

1699
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:10,964
Yes, sir, I need a good hand
to take Dan's place.

1700
01:40:11,197 --> 01:40:13,563
Well, I was thinking...

1701
01:40:13,692 --> 01:40:15,764
Maybe I'm not quite good enough yet...

1702
01:40:15,835 --> 01:40:18,997
...but Manuel said I was getting...
Manuel said...

1703
01:40:19,129 --> 01:40:20,241
Well, son?

1704
01:40:20,312 --> 01:40:23,310
Well, Manuel taught me so much,
I know I could.

1705
01:40:23,446 --> 01:40:25,714
And if you'll take me along, I'll...

1706
01:40:25,814 --> 01:40:30,285
Well, now, there's nobody
I'd rather sign than you, Harvey.

1707
01:40:30,355 --> 01:40:32,242
But ain't you kind of forgetting...

1708
01:40:32,306 --> 01:40:36,363
...all the lost time you and your daddy
have to catch up with each other?

1709
01:40:36,592 --> 01:40:40,845
You'll want to berth alongside him
for some time to come, won't you?

1710
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:42,851
- Yes, sir, but...
- Harvey!

1711
01:40:43,085 --> 01:40:46,912
...he has lots to do.
And I like being a fisherman.

1712
01:40:46,986 --> 01:40:50,596
I've been thinking about it.
I want to be as good a one as...

1713
01:40:51,176 --> 01:40:54,491
<i>I mean, I want to stay here with you
on the We're Here.</i>

1714
01:40:54,599 --> 01:40:57,859
Harvey! Hi, Harvey! Where are you?
It's Father.

1715
01:40:58,021 --> 01:40:59,743
There's your daddy now, ain't it?

1716
01:40:59,811 --> 01:41:01,818
Yes, sir.
So if you'll tell me now...

1717
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:03,646
- ...whether I can...
- Harvey!

1718
01:41:05,025 --> 01:41:06,966
Hello, Father.

1719
01:41:08,991 --> 01:41:10,365
Harvey, Son.

1720
01:41:12,349 --> 01:41:15,479
Well, well. My boy again.

1721
01:41:16,507 --> 01:41:18,743
So you see, Harvey,
by leaving early tomorrow morning...

1722
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:20,664
...we can get the sleeper plane
out of Boston.

1723
01:41:20,729 --> 01:41:23,248
- Yes, sir.
- You'll like the sleeper plane.

1724
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,417
It's great. Big berths and everything,
just like a Pullman.

1725
01:41:26,486 --> 01:41:29,005
- I know. But, look, Father.
- What?

1726
01:41:29,237 --> 01:41:33,293
I was thinking that if...
Maybe I could go somewhere on a boat.

1727
01:41:33,458 --> 01:41:36,239
All right. I was going to put
the yacht up for the winter...

1728
01:41:36,305 --> 01:41:38,028
...but we might take her out
and go to Bermuda.

1729
01:41:38,096 --> 01:41:41,029
I didn't mean the yacht, I meant the...

1730
01:41:41,806 --> 01:41:43,878
Oh, well, I don't know.

1731
01:41:44,173 --> 01:41:46,473
Well, you see,
the plane would get us to the ranch...

1732
01:41:46,539 --> 01:41:50,018
...in time for the rodeo after the roundup.
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Son?

1733
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:52,064
But there's no fishing out there,
is there?

1734
01:41:52,136 --> 01:41:53,924
The best trout fishing in the world.

1735
01:41:53,991 --> 01:41:57,851
And if I do say it myself, I can teach you to
cast a fly wherever you want to put one.

1736
01:41:57,926 --> 01:42:00,314
Yeah, I read about that kind of fishing
once in a magazine.

1737
01:42:00,388 --> 01:42:03,005
Manuel said that any fish
that ate a bug was some kind of a frog.

1738
01:42:04,387 --> 01:42:07,320
Who's Manuel? He sounds like
a pretty funny sort of person.

1739
01:42:07,393 --> 01:42:10,587
He's the man that picked Harvey
out of the water.

1740
01:42:11,518 --> 01:42:14,364
Well, I certainly want to meet that man,
Capt. Troop.

1741
01:42:14,429 --> 01:42:17,624
- Where is he?
- He's dead, Mr. Cheyne.

1742
01:42:19,962 --> 01:42:21,619
Where are you going, Son?

1743
01:42:22,041 --> 01:42:25,236
Just out. I'll be back in a little while.

1744
01:42:25,303 --> 01:42:27,669
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- No.

1745
01:42:27,798 --> 01:42:31,342
I mean, I'll be back in a little while.
Really, I will.

1746
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,936
Well, I guess that's all the vittles.

1747
01:42:34,035 --> 01:42:37,863
Will you come in the parlor
and chat a while?

1748
01:42:38,097 --> 01:42:39,176
Yes.

1749
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:43,491
Where was he going, Capt. Troop?

1750
01:42:43,566 --> 01:42:47,012
Oh, I reckon he has
a couple of errands to do.

1751
01:42:47,084 --> 01:42:50,879
Will you have a pipe?
I got some pretty fairish tobacco here.

1752
01:42:51,018 --> 01:42:52,991
- No, thanks.
- Have a chair.

1753
01:42:53,161 --> 01:42:55,200
That was fine pie, Mother.

1754
01:42:55,303 --> 01:42:58,368
Thank you, Discobolus.
I'll leave the dishes awhile.

1755
01:42:58,982 --> 01:43:01,599
Dad, is this boom set in here just right?

1756
01:43:01,701 --> 01:43:03,936
Well, let's see now.

1757
01:43:05,762 --> 01:43:09,535
Capt. Troop, tell me, that hurdy-gurdy...

1758
01:43:10,048 --> 01:43:12,348
...and the razor,
were they Manuel's?

1759
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:14,997
Yes, they was, Mr. Cheyne.

1760
01:43:16,093 --> 01:43:18,263
He must have been a pretty fine man.

1761
01:43:18,876 --> 01:43:22,038
Harvey's a fine boy now,
the kind of boy I'd always hoped he'd be.

1762
01:43:22,106 --> 01:43:25,999
Yes. They was real dorymates,
Mr. Cheyne.

1763
01:43:26,167 --> 01:43:28,076
Yes, I had that chance once.

1764
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:30,705
I'm afraid I threw it away.

1765
01:43:31,797 --> 01:43:34,927
Now that I got the chance again, I...

1766
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:39,209
Well, I guess I'm just getting
what I deserve.

1767
01:43:40,081 --> 01:43:43,014
Well, as long as you set your course
a little too late...

1768
01:43:43,087 --> 01:43:45,474
...maybe Manuel sailed it for you.

1769
01:43:46,029 --> 01:43:48,843
But that don't say
you can't sail it after him.

1770
01:43:49,387 --> 01:43:51,655
You're still the boy's dad, man.

1771
01:43:52,394 --> 01:43:55,654
A boy is never too old not to need a dad.

1772
01:43:55,912 --> 01:43:58,332
You just hold a hawser out to him.

1773
01:43:58,663 --> 01:44:02,458
Someday he's going to lay onto it
and pull you right into his heart.

1774
01:44:03,461 --> 01:44:08,215
And when you do get in there, you'll find
Manuel mighty satisfactory company.

1775
01:44:09,378 --> 01:44:10,904
Yes, sir.

1776
01:44:12,352 --> 01:44:15,547
Sure you won't change your mind,
have a pipe, Mr. Cheyne?

1777
01:44:16,349 --> 01:44:18,420
No thanks, Capt. Troop. I...

1778
01:44:18,973 --> 01:44:21,393
I think I'll take a little walk,
if you'll excuse me.

1779
01:44:21,467 --> 01:44:23,408
Yeah, why don't you do that?

1780
01:44:23,482 --> 01:44:25,488
Stroll up by the church, maybe?

1781
01:44:25,561 --> 01:44:28,341
Yes, it's mighty pretty there
this time of evening.

1782
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:41,384
That one is from Manuel to his father.

1783
01:44:41,489 --> 01:44:43,276
Yes, my son.

1784
01:44:45,198 --> 01:44:48,841
And that one is from me to Manuel.

1785
01:44:53,386 --> 01:44:56,581
Do you think they're good enough?
I only had $9.

1786
01:44:56,681 --> 01:44:58,109
Oh, I know they are.

1787
01:45:07,619 --> 01:45:11,228
- What do I do now?
- Would you like to kneel here and pray?

1788
01:45:12,224 --> 01:45:14,711
- Can I say anything?
- Anything.

1789
01:45:16,383 --> 01:45:18,007
Do you have to stay here?

1790
01:45:19,133 --> 01:45:20,408
No, my son.

1791
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,928
Look...

1792
01:45:39,315 --> 01:45:42,608
...I guess you have
an awful lot of things to do...

1793
01:45:42,737 --> 01:45:44,907
...taking care of everybody.

1794
01:45:45,743 --> 01:45:49,635
Look, if it is that way,
the way Manuel said...

1795
01:45:50,284 --> 01:45:52,520
...could you fix it so someday...

1796
01:45:52,779 --> 01:45:55,560
...there'll be an extra seat
in Manuel's father's dory...

1797
01:45:55,626 --> 01:45:57,447
...with him and Manuel?

1798
01:45:57,801 --> 01:46:01,694
Because I just got to be with Manuel.
I got to.

1799
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:08,027
I guess that's all I wanted to ask.

1800
01:46:08,803 --> 01:46:10,907
So, please.

1801
01:46:35,477 --> 01:46:36,785
Harvey.

1802
01:46:43,633 --> 01:46:45,192
Harvey, Son.

1803
01:46:47,823 --> 01:46:51,170
I just wanted to get out in the air
for a little while.

1804
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:55,844
Go ahead, Son, let it go.
I know about it.

1805
01:46:56,267 --> 01:47:00,094
- I know about Manuel.
- Please, please go away.

1806
01:47:01,256 --> 01:47:05,531
Harvey, we haven't talked much before,
have we?

1807
01:47:06,022 --> 01:47:08,442
But we can start now.
We can talk this over.

1808
01:47:08,612 --> 01:47:11,360
We can talk over everything from now on,
can't we, Son?

1809
01:47:11,906 --> 01:47:16,214
You better go up to the house.
I'll be back in a little while.

1810
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:19,221
- Really, I will.
- No, let me stay here with you.

1811
01:47:19,582 --> 01:47:21,207
Maybe I can help.

1812
01:47:22,429 --> 01:47:25,330
Come here to your dad, Son.
I don't mind your crying.

1813
01:47:25,499 --> 01:47:30,101
Please don't get in this boat.
This is Manuel's dory. Manuel's and mine.

1814
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:35,635
I know it hurts, Son,
but you won't always feel like this.

1815
01:47:36,341 --> 01:47:39,536
Just think, tomorrow you'll be
on that big sleeper plane.

1816
01:47:39,636 --> 01:47:43,311
Before you know it, you'll be flying right
over the tops of the Rocky Mountains.

1817
01:47:43,378 --> 01:47:47,053
I don't want to go anywhere but here.
I want to stay here...

1818
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,515
...and go fishing, the way Manuel did.

1819
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:52,706
- I want to be where Manuel is.
- Harvey.

1820
01:47:52,909 --> 01:47:55,428
Son, won't you listen?

1821
01:47:56,587 --> 01:48:00,513
- I'm lonely, too.
- Please, please go away.

1822
01:48:00,713 --> 01:48:04,988
I'll be all right,
if you'll please let me alone. Please.

1823
01:49:01,897 --> 01:49:03,968
And so we are met here today...

1824
01:49:04,807 --> 01:49:08,154
...facing the open sea
on three points of the compass...

1825
01:49:08,678 --> 01:49:12,450
...to pay tribute to the men
who have sailed from this port...

1826
01:49:12,643 --> 01:49:15,391
...and gone down to that sea,
never to return.

1827
01:49:15,522 --> 01:49:16,699
For three centuries...

1828
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:20,794
...women and children of Gloucester men
have stood upon this shore and cried:

1829
01:49:20,895 --> 01:49:22,301
..."There go the ships".

1830
01:49:22,367 --> 01:49:25,049
This year, as every year...

1831
01:49:25,308 --> 01:49:27,696
...there are those that have waited
in vain.

1832
01:49:28,347 --> 01:49:32,120
It shall be ever thus.
In years to come...

1833
01:49:32,633 --> 01:49:35,381
...women of Gloucester
shall watch and wait...

1834
01:49:35,671 --> 01:49:40,109
...sending their prayers and faith
to men over the horizon.

1835
01:49:41,076 --> 01:49:45,449
Men whose every day
is one of life and labor uncertain...

1836
01:49:45,555 --> 01:49:50,254
...but men of strong faith
in themselves...

1837
01:49:50,704 --> 01:49:52,426
...in their ships...

1838
01:49:52,911 --> 01:49:56,389
...and in the God who is on land and sea.

1839
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:58,724
So to those of these men...

1840
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:02,021
...whose last resting place
is beneath the sea they loved...

1841
01:50:02,506 --> 01:50:04,806
...we pay our humble tribute...

1842
01:50:05,064 --> 01:50:08,161
...as we cast these wreaths
and flowers...

1843
01:50:08,486 --> 01:50:12,608
...upon the waters
of their outgoing tide.
