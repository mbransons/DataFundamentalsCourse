1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:07,299


2
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,907
Whoa, nelly! Whoa!
Right here.

3
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,666
- Hi, Jim.
- Hello, Bill. Cold enough?

4
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,211
You're darn right.
You got any passengers?

5
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,463
No. Just a few actors.

6
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,465
- Hiya, neighbor.
- Hiya.

7
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,759
- You a couple of actors?
- That's right.

8
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,928
You don't look like actors.

9
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,598
I got a piece of news for you.
This doesn't look like a town.

10
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,059
- Say, that's a nifty!
- You like that?

11
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,270
What do you think of this?
Know what Julius Caesar said...

12
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,105
...when Brutus stabbed him?
- No.

13
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,858
- Ouch!
- Ouch.

14
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,277
That's all right.
Where did you get that?

15
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,113
That's one of my father's jokes.

16
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,699
What are you, one of your mother's?

17
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,827
Say, he looks like an actor.

18
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,872
You called it, friend.
Harry Palmer, single O.

19
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,166
- How you doing?
- Hi. I'm Jimmy Metcalfe...

20
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,252
How you doing? Glad to see you.

21
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,214
Well, hiya, chicks.
Meet Harry Palmer, headliner.

22
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,634
- Do we have to answer that?
- Bus for the hotel! The hotel bus!

23
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,010
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

24
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,639
Go ahead, kids. Get in the bus.
Sid and I will bring the bags.

25
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,979
Hello, Springtime.

26
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,815
Aren't you a little out of season?

27
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,528
Who's the guy with the squirrel
around his neck?

28
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,824
- Single act, name of Palmer.
- His act can't be as funny as that coat.

29
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,915
Hey, how do you like this billing?

30
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:31,461
"Harry Palmer, America's
foremost comedy juggler and dancer."

31
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,631
That's the way it's gonna read
someday at the Palace too.

32
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,301
Say, how long you been
with this stale act?

33
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,970
Are you kidding?
Jimmy Metcalfe has a great act.

34
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,847
And it's gonna be better too.

35
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,975
Wait till you hear the terrific arrangement
he's buying.

36
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,020
- Arrangement? Where?
- Right here. The orchestra leader.

37
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,023
He writes sensational stuff.

38
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,943
Thanks, kid.
I'll give you a joke sometime.

39
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,531
Lou, you can't expect my girls to dress
way up on the third floor.

40
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,450
- They got changes.
- Sorry, Jimmy.

41
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,077
I hand out dressing rooms
according to billing.

42
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,206
I know, but Palmer won't mind.
He looks like a swell guy.

43
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,083
- Lf it's okay by Palmer, it's okay by me.
- Thanks!

44
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,545
Hey, kids! Kids, it's okay!
We're moving!

45
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,174
- Hiya, maestro. I'm Harry Palmer.
- How do you do?

46
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,510
I hear you got a terrific arrangement.

47
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,929
- How did you hear?
- Jimmy Metcalfe told me.

48
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,639
- He did?
- Sure.

49
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,266
Look, I'm breaking in a new act.

50
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,061
If the arrangement's good,
I'll give you 50 bucks.

51
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,897
- I promised it to Jimmy.
- He won't be needing it.

52
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,233
- That act is gonna fold any day.
- It is?

53
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,276
- Sure.
- Gee whiz.

54
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,612
- What do you say?
- I promised it to Jimmy.

55
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,032
- Fifty bucks.
- I sure can use that 50.

56
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,076
When Jimmy gets the act fixed up...

57
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,912
...we're not gonna have to play
these dumps anymore.

58
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,918
What's the idea of putting her
in my dressing room?

59
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,421
I'm sorry. The young ladies
in Mr. Metcalfe's act got changes.

60
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,925
I know when to be nice to young ladies.
I'm topping this bill...

61
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,763
...and I rate the number one room!
- Okay, Mr. Palmer. Okay.

62
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,727
Sorry, kids. Mr. Palmer insists
on having this room.

63
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,896
You'll have to dress upstairs.

64
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,483
Let's not keep the gentleman waiting.

65
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,612
- After all, he's number one.
- Yeah.

66
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,408
There's nothing lower than number one.

67
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,332
- I bet he bows every time he hears thunder.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,209
- See what I mean?
- I see what you mean. Go, Lily.

69
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,795
- Say, you know, I was...
- Pardon me.

70
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,283
- We weren't a three-alarm fire.
- Don't worry.

71
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,910
- We'll be a hit in bigger places.
- Hope so.

72
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,288
- Danny!
- Jo.

73
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,124
I'm glad to see you.
How'd you get out of school?

74
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,335
I told the dean you were playing.
He let me cut classes.

75
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,214
Well, that's wonderful! I'm sorry.
Jimmy, this is my brother, Danny.

76
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,633
- How do you do?
- Oh, glad to see you.

77
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,262
And I'm sure glad you're her brother.
Well, I'll see you later.

78
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,472
- Oh, don't go.
- Oh, no. You two go on.

79
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,852
Have a good talk. I'll see you in a while.
It's awfully nice to know you, Danny.

80
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,813
- He's a nice guy.
- He's the nicest fella you'll meet.

81
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,482
Come on. Sit down.
Now, tell me something.

82
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,652
- Same old thing.
- You beginning to feel like a doctor?

83
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,988
Well, I can spell "stethoscope."

84
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:26,825
Well, stand up. Well, stand up.
Come on.

85
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,746
Oh, boy! You're gonna be
a tall doctor.

86
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:35,000
Tell me, when do you
have to go back to school?

87
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,710
Jo...

88
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,838
I'm not going back.

89
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,884
- What?
- I'm not going back.

90
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:48,055
Why? What's the matter?
Did something happen at school?

91
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,600
- Oh, no, no. Nothing like that.
- Well, then what is it?

92
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,520
Well, it just doesn't make sense.

93
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,814
I sit in a nice, warm dormitory,
and you wear yourself out...

94
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,110
...in a lot of Clifton Junctions.
- What kind of talk is that?

95
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,197
- I just saw your act.
- What's the matter with our act?

96
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,408
Oh, nothing. Nothing's the matter with it.
You're great.

97
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,662
It just seems to me
the act isn't getting anywhere.

98
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,748
- Lf you didn't have me around your neck...
- Listen to me.

99
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,459
You ought to be ashamed,
talking to me like that.

100
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:20,504
Didn't we make a deal once?
Well, didn't we?

101
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,924
You go through medical school
and pay me back with interest.

102
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,553
This is a fine time to quit.
Your last year. You're doing great.

103
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,639
- I'm not gonna let you quit.
- But, Jo...

104
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,767
What do you want to be?
A no-good tramp or something?

105
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,770
Danny.

106
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,357
You're not working any hardship on me.

107
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:44,152
Don't you see, honey?
I love it. I'd be doing it anyway.

108
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,822
And you're gonna stay in medical school.

109
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:50,659
I gotta make sure somebody in this family
is a success.

110
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,330
All aboard!

111
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,293
- So long.
- Don't forget to send that picture.

112
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,711
- Yeah.
- All aboard!

113
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,171
- I better be going.
- Bye.

114
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,964
Goodbye.

115
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,551
We're gonna be all right, you and I.

116
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,721
Goodbye. Goodbye, honey.

117
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,892
- See you at the Palace, kid.
- All right, doctor. It's a date.

118
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,644
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

119
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,863
Hiya, Springtime. Going my way?

120
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,617
Say, you know it's not safe
for a pretty girl to be walking around...

121
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,118
...by herself.

122
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,953
Oh, why don't you come off it?

123
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,789
You know you're gonna wind up
calling me pet names.

124
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,291
Well, of all the...

125
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,919
Tempo, Springtime!
Tempo, tempo!

126
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,839
I didn't like you at 7:00 this morning
and I don't like you now.

127
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,134
If you keep playing your cards right,
I'm gonna hate you.

128
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:52,930
So why don't you just evaporate,
fade away, dissolve?!

129
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,140
I want to talk to you about business.

130
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,476
- Write me a letter.
- It's too important.

131
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,270
Fancy face, I caught you on-stage
this afternoon.

132
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,982
You sing like a bird, dance like a deer,
look like a wedding ring...

133
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,984
...but that act you're with...

134
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,820
- That's two pins and a lollipop.
- What do you mean?

135
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,114
It's murder. That's what I mean.

136
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,493
Why don't you get bright?
You're too fast for that buggy.

137
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,246
And why don't you mind
your own business?

138
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,332
That's just the point.
It is my business.

139
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,628
Next season, I'm doing a double act,
throwing away the baggy pants.

140
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,840
Don't look now, Springtime.
You're gonna be my partner.

141
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,466
- Oh, I am, huh?
- You said it.

142
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:33,554
Standing next to me, you'll look
like a million bucks in nickels and dimes.

143
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,223
I can see those three-sheets:
Palmer and Hayden!

144
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,476
- We'll tear down theaters...
- I wouldn't be your partner...

145
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,604
...if they booked us into the Palace
for 51 weeks a year.

146
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,858
- I don't get it. Why?
- Oh, so many reasons.

147
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,694
But you wouldn't understand
any of them.

148
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,697
Gee, I feel sorry for you.

149
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,200
Hey, wait a minute.

150
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,245
Look, Miss Hayden.
I'm sorry.

151
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:03,000
Your act is all right. Oh, it needs
a little punching up here and there, but...

152
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,377
- Why don't you take this?
- What's that?

153
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:09,548
It's the arrangement I bought. The one
you and Metcalfe were supposed to get.

154
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,050
- But you were...
- No. Go ahead.

155
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,095
All that big talk about me
breaking down theaters...

156
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,640
...that's strictly small-town talk
on a cold night.

157
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:23,103
- Oh, I'm sorry. I spoke so...
- No. Forget it. You had me pegged.

158
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,149
I'm never gonna win any blue ribbons
for being a nice guy.

159
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:31,320
- Well, I...
- Say, would you...?

160
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,239
- Oh, skip it.
- What?

161
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:38,118
I was gonna ask you to have a cup
of coffee, but after the way I...

162
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,454
Well, I'd love to have a cup of coffee.

163
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,248
- You would?
- Sure.

164
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,426
- Two coffees, please.
- Two coffees. Yes.

165
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,762
How long you been in show business?

166
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,848
I wasn't really in it until Jimmy
gave me a chance. You?

167
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,893
- All my life. Do you like it?
- I love it.

168
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,562
I'd rather sing and dance than, well...

169
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,649
...eat.
- I can tell that by the way you work.

170
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,984
- You're good.
- No. I'm not good yet.

171
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:15,239
But I will be someday.
You know, I've got kind of a...

172
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,327
- You'd probably laugh at me if I told you.
- No, I wouldn't. What?

173
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,871
Well, I've got kind of a goal
in my mind.

174
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,541
It's the same goal
every vaudeville actor has...

175
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,960
...only I'm really going to get there.

176
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,338
I used to think I'd play the Palace
someday too.

177
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,007
- Well, maybe you will.
- Not me.

178
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:38,554
You had my number, all right.
Just a cheap tramp comic.

179
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,641
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- Why not? It's the truth.

180
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,978
Take that stuff, for instance.
I'm not so sure I can do it.

181
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,273
- Then why'd you buy it?
- I liked it.

182
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,733
It sure is a knockout.

183
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,610
- Want to hear it?
- Sure. Love to.

184
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,820
Okay.

185
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,868
If you've heard my kind of voice before,
stop me.

186
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,870
All right.

187
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,508
Wait a minute.
You better let me do it.

188
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,635
Okay.

189
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,848
Now...

190
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,321
Here's the church.

191
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:23,033
And here's the steeple.

192
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,745
Open the door...

193
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,290
...and there's the people.

194
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,874
Remember this one?

195
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,545
And this.

196
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,190
You know what I can't eat for breakfast?

197
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,860
Why, no. I haven't the slightest idea.

198
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:07,614
- Tell me, what can't you eat for breakfast?
- Luncheon and dinner.

199
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,517
Here comes that Loveland again.

200
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:47,946
Oh, yes.

201
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:50,199
Thank you.

202
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,534
Thank you.

203
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:56,121
- Do we click or don't we?
- That was wonderful! You were perfect!

204
00:24:56,288 --> 00:25:00,292
- What a great finale for a double act!
- We'd have to get a different opening.

205
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,461
- A slower one.
- We come on together.

206
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:06,965
You go off for a quick change.
I do my soft-shoe routine, and then we...

207
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,845
What's the matter?

208
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,226
I guess I forgot.

209
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:51,301
- Twenty-six, please.
- Oh, yes.

210
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,471
Thank you.

211
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:01,520
- Well, it was fun while it lasted.
- Yeah. Here.

212
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:04,106
No. You keep it. You can do it.
You proved it.

213
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,525
Nope. It takes two.

214
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,861
- Well, please. L...
- It's yours.

215
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,697
Do it with Metcalfe or tear it up.

216
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:14,241
Anyway, it's yours, nobody else's.

217
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,535
Well, thank you.

218
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:20,122
- Good night.
- Good night.

219
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,586
Wait a minute.

220
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:30,215
I played a dirty trick on you.

221
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:33,260
You better know.
Then you won't feel so bad.

222
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,971
When I offered to give you that song...

223
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:40,058
...I really didn't mean it.
I was playing you for a sap.

224
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,687
I wanted to fix it so you'd give me
a chance to try out with you.

225
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:47,232
And all that sob stuff
about me being ashamed of myself...

226
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:51,069
...that was just a bid for sympathy.
I wasn't ashamed.

227
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,447
I thought I was being pretty cute.

228
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,744
I'm ashamed now though.

229
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:02,164
And this time, when I say I'm a heel...

230
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:06,084
...well, I'm not kidding.

231
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,593
Well, I'm glad you told me.

232
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,763
Good night.

233
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,476
Good night.

234
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,615
Hi.

235
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:40,118
- Well, make yourself at home.
- Thanks. I already have.

236
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,621
Danny get off all right?

237
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,582
He sure took his time about it.
I began to think...

238
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,459
...they were holding you ransom.

239
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:51,088
Well, I stopped in to get some coffee.

240
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:54,633
When you didn't come back,
I walked by the station.

241
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,469
I thought maybe I might run into you.

242
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,347
I saw you through a window.

243
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:02,474
I heard you too.

244
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:06,103
Gosh, you two were swell together.
Terrific!

245
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,313
Weren't we, Jimmy?

246
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,650
But those after-the-show acts,
they never hold up.

247
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:15,779
Jo. Did Harry Palmer ask you
to team up with him?

248
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:18,282
- How'd you know?
- He'd be crazy if he didn't.

249
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,994
I saw you together.
You're a natural for each other.

250
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,706
Look, Jimmy.
I'm kind of sleepy.

251
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,958
What...?

252
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,336
What did you tell him, Jo?

253
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,047
I told him I already had a job.

254
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,799
Yeah?

255
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,552
Well, you haven't.

256
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,182
- What do you mean?
- I'm breaking up the act, Jo.

257
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,309
Oh, no, you're not.

258
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:48,854
I'm not gonna have you making
noble sacrifices on my account.

259
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:53,942
Who said anything about your account? And
who said anything about noble sacrifices?

260
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,904
I'm a comic.
I should have known that before.

261
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:02,159
I don't know what I was messing up my act
with girls and music and stuff like that.

262
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,827
Besides...

263
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:07,623
...l've got a new idea
that I'd like to try out with Sid.

264
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,750
Just the two of us.

265
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:15,130
Well, what made you decide all this
tonight?

266
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:19,343
I should have thought of it long ago,
but you know me, putting things off...

267
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,346
You know how it's been.
The act's not doing well.

268
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:25,390
I had a wire from Eddie,
said he can't get us bookings.

269
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,476
Lily's talking about leaving, and...

270
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:30,437
Well, it's the only thing to do, that's all.

271
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:34,566
If I thought you were trying
to pave the way for me...

272
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:38,362
Now, wait a minute. What are you
talking about? This is business.

273
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,242
No fooling. I wouldn't joke
about a thing like that.

274
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,954
It's good business too.

275
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,122
For everybody.

276
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,844
Oh, Jimmy. You're sweet.

277
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,973
- You're just as sweet as they come.
- Do you want to know something?

278
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:09,101
That goes for you too, double.

279
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,814
I'm gonna kind of miss you, kiddo.

280
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:16,483
Working with you hasn't been
like working at all.

281
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,404
- It's been more like...
- Palmer and Hayden.

282
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:23,282
Gee, think of that.

283
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:26,493
Palmer and Hayden.
It's the way we're gonna bill ourselves.

284
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,620
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Sounds swell.

285
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:32,583
Oh, I gotta tell him now, right away.

286
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:38,125
- Don't you think you better go to bed?
- Yeah. I guess so.

287
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:43,005
- How I hate those man-traps.
- Oh, well, you take the lower tonight.

288
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,632
I wouldn't know how to act in one.
Hey, George.

289
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,343
- Whenever you're ready.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,598
Hey, listen to this.

291
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:55,350
"Eddie Melton has booked Jimmy Metcalfe,
comic...

292
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,769
...with Sid Simms
on the Orpheum circuit.

293
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,939
Metcalfe opens the 19th in Minneapolis."

294
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:05,485
Isn't that wonderful? Look.
See? Here.

295
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:12,117
- I'd like a crack at some Orpheum time.
- Oh, now, Harry.

296
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,661
Well, I'm sick of playing
these two-bit towns.

297
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:17,956
- Chicago isn't a two-bit town.
- The part we're playing is.

298
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:21,585
Why must everything happen here
and now? You think that we have...

299
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,921
Yes, sir. I'll make it right up for you.

300
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,926
- I'll take that.
- I'll go back and have a cigarette.

301
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,054
- Let me know when he's finished, will you?
- Yeah.

302
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:59,456
- This a private car, sir.
- Excuse me. I was looking for the club...

303
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,921
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just
on my way back for a cigarette.

304
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:10,676
- I must have got off at the wrong floor.
- Why don't you have your cigarette here?

305
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:14,179
- Well, thanks a lot, but I...
- Please.

306
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:18,517
- I'd like one myself.
- Well, thanks. That's mighty nice of you.

307
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:21,562
- That's all, Celeste.
- Yes, ma'am.

308
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,109
Oh, excuse me.

309
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,491
Drink?

310
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,037
- Sure.
- Chartreuse, creme de menthe, vieille cure?

311
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,581
Surprise me.

312
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,752
- There you are.
- Thanks.

313
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,715
Say, this sure beats a club car, all right.

314
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:53,343
And better-looking people too.

315
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:05,189
Say! You're not...?

316
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:09,568
Well, I'll be darned. Imagine me,
sitting here with Eve Minard!

317
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,528
Say, you're not really...?

318
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,783
How do you like that? Guess you
never heard of me. Harry Palmer.

319
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:20,078
- Harry Palmer?
- Of Palmer and Hayden.

320
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:23,749
Oh, yes, certainly.
A fellow artist.

321
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,460
Nothing less. Get a load of this.

322
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,975
- Very nice.
- You get the rough idea.

323
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,937
- I must come and see you.
- I open in Chicago tomorrow.

324
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:48,232
- A full week too.
- Really? I open there tomorrow.

325
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,859
- At the Majestic?
- Well, no.

326
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:53,445
They booked me into
a smaller house this time.

327
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:56,698
- It's a good one though, for its size.
- Oh, that's fine.

328
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:59,993
Chicago seems to be much
more inviting now.

329
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,499
Well, the pleasure's all mine. If you want
to see the town, I'm your man.

330
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,837
Chicago, Boston, Detroit,
they're all the same. Except New York.

331
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:13,674
- That is a city.
- I suppose you've played the Palace.

332
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:16,343
Palace? Which one?

333
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:20,556
Which one?
Oh, there's only one real Palace.

334
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:23,976
- New York.
- Oh, yes. Yes, I've played there.

335
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:26,687
And I have a return engagement
before I sail.

336
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,480
Do you like to play there?

337
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:33,735
Yes. I like to play there very much.

338
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,534
- More?
- Sure. Why not?

339
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:44,079
Come to think about it,
I never caught your act.

340
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:46,957
- No?
- I know that you sing and all that...

341
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,168
...but what kind of stuff?
- Many kinds.

342
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:53,714
- Rags or ballads?
- As you like. I have it!

343
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:57,176
You danced for me,
I will sing for you, if I may.

344
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,803
- That'd be great.
- What will you like to hear?

345
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,473
Don't make it too highbrow.
You gotta gauge your audience.

346
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,895
- Give them something they'll understand.
- I think you'll understand this.

347
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:10,063
Most people do.

348
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:48,287
- Say, that's wonderful!
- You like that?

349
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,081
Do I? It's terrific!
Let's have an encore.

350
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:54,835
- Lf you wish.
- Certainly, I wish.

351
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,387
- Oh, hello, Jo. How do you feel?
- How do you feel?

352
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:30,973
Here's the other half of my act,
Miss Hayden.

353
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,559
- Won't you come in?
- Jo, this is...

354
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:37,604
Yes. Miss Minard.
I play your records over and over again.

355
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:39,439
- I love them.
- Thank you.

356
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,276
Well, I was just about
to come on back and turn in.

357
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:45,654
- Thanks for the song. It was swell.
- I hope you won't forget.

358
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:48,824
- I'll be at the Majestic.
- Forget?

359
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:52,411
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

360
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,414
- Good night.
- Good night.

361
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,377
- Quite a dame, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

362
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,755
Four grand a week. Oh, boy.

363
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:09,178
- Well, good night, kid.
- Good night, Harry.

364
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:38,373
- Come in.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

365
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,294
...I now give you Jimmy Metcalfe!
- Jimmy, darling!

366
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:46,089
How are you, Jo? Let me look at you.
My golly, you look swell!

367
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:50,385
- You're supposed to be in Minneapolis.
- We closed last night. A mild sensation.

368
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:53,430
- How is your act?
- Oh, fine.

369
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,767
Come on. Sit here, Jimmy.
Gee, it's good to see you.

370
00:41:56,934 --> 00:42:00,270
Well, it's good to see you...
Say, who's this, General Pershing?

371
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,814
No. That's Danny.
He's enlisted.

372
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,900
No! What about the medical career?

373
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:08,111
- He's going back after the war.
- Doesn't he look swell?

374
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:09,530
- Yeah.
- Where's Harry?

375
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:11,198
Harry?

376
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:15,244
He's out with a friend.

377
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,996
You'll never guess who either.

378
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:21,375
- Eve Minard.
- Eve Minard!

379
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:24,503
Say, he's traveling
in pretty fast company, isn't he?

380
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,506
Yeah. Well...

381
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,633
...you know Harry.

382
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:32,511
She's a big success...

383
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:34,847
...and she's pretty...

384
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:36,723
...and, well...

385
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,519
Jo, you're in love
with that guy, aren't you?

386
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:44,773
Harry? Oh, no.

387
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:49,778
- I'm not in love.
- Hey, hey, shorty.

388
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:56,243
Remember me? Jimmy Metcalfe, the fella
that played Clifton Junction with you?

389
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,787
Oh, Jimmy.

390
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:03,000
It's way down deep inside of me.

391
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:08,505
He's wrong, and I love him.
He's right, and I love him.

392
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:11,383
It's no good.

393
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:17,431
Gee, what do you do
when you love somebody so much...

394
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:20,559
...and they don't
even know you're around?

395
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:24,521
I don't know, Jo.

396
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:28,400
I guess you just
keep right on loving them.

397
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:37,242
Watch your step.

398
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:49,171
I forgot to ask you.
When do you open in St. Paul?

399
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:51,965
- St. Paul?
- Say, Jo.

400
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:54,593
- Well, hello, stranger.
- Hi, Harry.

401
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,095
- I hear you're doing all right.
- Not so bad.

402
00:43:57,262 --> 00:44:00,224
- Like to see a fella get ahead.
- You've got a few minutes.

403
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,268
You better go on first
and give me a chance to change.

404
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:05,729
All right. But hurry, please.

405
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:12,194
Jo. How about having supper with me
after the show tonight?

406
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:16,323
Fine. We have to catch a train at midnight.
We open tomorrow in Milwaukee.

407
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,243
- Do you suppose he'd like to come?
- I'll ask him.

408
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,453
- I'll see you later.
- All right, Jimmy.

409
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,498
Make it good, shorty.
I'll be out front watching you.

410
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:36,552
Harry? Jimmy wants to know if we
can have supper later. Can you make it?

411
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:39,429
I'd like to,
but I got a date with Eve.

412
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:44,142
Oh, well, you better hurry
or you'll miss your cue.

413
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:06,034
- That will be all, Celeste.
- Yes, ma'am.

414
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,186
Miss Minard.

415
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:34,813
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

416
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:39,026
- Could I see you a moment, please?
- I'm sorry, but I...

417
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:41,612
I expect a guest.

418
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:46,825
Yes, I know, but this will
only take a moment. Please.

419
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:01,173
Well, what is it, my dear?

420
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:05,552
Well, I wanted to talk to you...

421
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:09,348
Yes?

422
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,352
I thought...

423
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:18,148
I'm sorry.

424
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:23,362
- Lf you'll excuse me.
- Wait a moment.

425
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:28,408
I know you have something to say,
and I would like to hear it.

426
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:30,702
What is it?

427
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:33,330
Sit down, please.

428
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:41,922
I had my speech all memorized, and it
was gonna be pretty dramatic, I guess.

429
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,884
But I got stage fright.

430
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,763
It's about Harry.

431
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:54,351
You see, I love him.

432
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:59,648
And you're such a big person,
that I thought...

433
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:03,944
Well, it's hard to say, but...

434
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:05,445
...I love him.

435
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:08,866
And you're worried about me?

436
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:13,495
No. It's not that.

437
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:16,748
- But...
- You needn't worry, my dear.

438
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,251
I have no designs on him.

439
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:24,381
Thank you.

440
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:29,261
- I hope you don't think that I just...
- Don't apologize, Miss Hayden.

441
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:36,268
I loved someone like you love Harry, and I
didn't realize it until a long time afterwards.

442
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:38,395
Much too long.

443
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,607
But I should have done
what you're doing now.

444
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:44,610
Thank you.

445
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:51,241
- But I'm sorry you love him so much.
- Why?

446
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:55,120
- Because he isn't worth it.
- Oh, no, you're wrong. He's...

447
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:57,998
- He's...
- He's an opportunist...

448
00:49:58,165 --> 00:50:02,794
...an egotistical actor who
will do anything to get what he wants.

449
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:06,131
He'll make you very unhappy
one day, my dear.

450
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:09,801
Oh, no, you're wrong.
Harry isn't bad.

451
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:13,096
I know because
I'm closer to him than anyone.

452
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:16,350
- I know.
- You know.

453
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:20,270
He'd leave you in a minute
if I made him an offer.

454
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:25,609
- Oh, I don't believe that.
- Would you like to have me try?

455
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:29,071
Oh, no, I don't believe that.

456
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:36,119
It might be better to get hurt
all at once and get it over with.

457
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:39,289
- I'm not afraid.
- Shall I ask him?

458
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:41,291
Well, I...

459
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:44,461
You can get to the elevator this way.

460
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:51,009
- I am afraid.
- Go on. Quickly!

461
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,440
- Hello, Eve. Here's Adam.
- Good evening, Harry.

462
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:17,661
- Say, what are we celebrating?
- Harry, I have a surprise for you.

463
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:22,332
- Well, come on. Let's have it.
- How would you like to join my act?

464
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:27,671
- What?
- How would you like to join my act?

465
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,925
- Come on, Eve. You're giving it to me.
- No, no. I'm very serious.

466
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:35,012
You are?

467
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:39,183
You're asking if I want to tour with you
and play the Palace?

468
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,684
Yes.

469
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:43,520
Holy...

470
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,859
Hallelujah! Wait till I tell Jo!

471
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,028
Jo.

472
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:53,113
You want her to go too, don't you?

473
00:51:53,697 --> 00:52:00,162
Well, she's probably very talented,
but, after all, I'm a singer myself.

474
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:08,587
Oh, well,
that's a different proposition.

475
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,967
- Gee, I...
- Well, then let's forget about it.

476
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:17,596
Hey, wait a minute.
Who said anything about forgetting?

477
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,890
You don't know Jo.

478
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:25,395
She's the top of the deck. She wouldn't
stand in my way. She's a trouper.

479
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:28,106
When do we start?

480
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:32,319
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

481
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:41,662
Well, what's holding us up?
Come on. Let's have a drink on it.

482
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:49,878
Here's to Harry Palmer,
heading for the Palace.

483
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:54,675
- Harry.
- Yeah?

484
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,761
When you see Miss Hayden,
tell her something for me.

485
00:52:57,928 --> 00:52:59,513
Sure.

486
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:02,558
Tell her...

487
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:05,894
...l'm sorry.

488
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:21,451
Come in.

489
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:23,704
- Hello.
- Hello.

490
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,999
- You packed?
- No.

491
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:31,295
- Train leaves at 12:30, you know.
- Yeah, I know.

492
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:34,131
Look at this.
Looks like the rats have been at it.

493
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:36,550
You'd think that in a city like Chicago...

494
00:53:36,717 --> 00:53:40,679
...they'd know how to launder a blouse.
- Yeah.

495
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:44,349
Say, Jo.

496
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:48,937
I want to ask you sort of a question.

497
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:53,025
Supposing somebody had been offered
a chance...

498
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:56,486
...to do something they'd been wanting
to do for a long time.

499
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,489
Yeah?

500
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:05,579
Well, supposing their accepting this offer
meant hurting somebody else maybe.

501
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:15,422
Well, what would you do?

502
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,343
Oh, I don't know.

503
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:24,598
I guess it would depend on how important
the thing was to me.

504
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,311
And if it was really important...

505
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:34,316
...I guess I'd go ahead and do it.

506
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:40,364
- You would?
- Sure.

507
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:44,826
- You only live once, you know.
- Yeah, I know...

508
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:48,163
...but it's kind of hard making
up your mind.

509
00:54:56,755 --> 00:55:00,050
It's funny, you bringing up
a question like that.

510
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,471
I've got kind of the same problem.

511
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:09,810
- And it is hard too.
- What do you mean?

512
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:13,188
- Harry...
- Yeah?

513
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:17,401
...Jimmy wants me
to come back in his act.

514
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:19,236
Yeah?

515
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:23,532
Do you want to go back to him?

516
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:27,327
Well, I don't know. I...

517
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:30,080
He made me
a pretty good offer.

518
00:55:31,707 --> 00:55:35,294
Well, after all, we...

519
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,547
We all want to get ahead,
you know?

520
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:43,927
- I mean, that's only human.
- Well, look, Jo.

521
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:49,308
I don't want to stand in your way.
If you want to go, go ahead and go.

522
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:53,395
- Honest?
- Sure. Go right ahead.

523
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:58,400
You're not just trying to be nice,
are you?

524
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:02,362
No, of course not!
Look, there's no use kidding ourselves.

525
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:05,866
We both know things haven't panned out
as well as we thought.

526
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:09,286
So if you can get a break,
go ahead, take it.

527
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:17,002
Oh, come on, Springtime.
No hearts and flowers. Not from you.

528
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:21,006
- Look, we're both gonna be on top.
- Sure.

529
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:23,800
Good luck, Jo...

530
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,761
...and lots of it.

531
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,349
Hey, what's the big idea?

532
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:34,811
Say, you're not crying
because you feel sorry for me, are you?

533
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:39,816
There's no need to do that because tonight
I was over at Eve's, and she asked...

534
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,530
Oh, Jo, please don't cry.

535
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:48,325
- Please. I'm not worth it, I tell you.
- I can't help it.

536
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:51,161
Honey, I wish you'd stop.

537
00:56:51,328 --> 00:56:54,164
Oh, please, darling, please.

538
00:56:56,208 --> 00:57:00,003
- Harry, Harry.
- Oh, honey.

539
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,855
Say, what hit us?

540
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:21,942
Oh, it hit me a long time ago.

541
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:26,530
Well, I'll be darned.

542
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,287
- Harry.
- Yeah.

543
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:37,624
What was it Eve asked you to do tonight?

544
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:41,712
Oh, forget it.

545
00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:46,884
We gotta get going! We gotta make
that train, and you gotta help me pack!

546
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:50,554
The nerve of that Metcalfe,
trying to break up my act...

547
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:54,766
...and trying to steal my girl too.
I'll push his face in.

548
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:58,645
The time I've wasted. Why didn't you
tell me I was in love with you?

549
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:01,565
I didn't know,
and I can hardly believe it now.

550
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:04,484
I'll make you believe it, all right.

551
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:08,780
Hey, what's this?

552
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:18,790
Look! "Palmer and Hayden
booked into Palace New York...

553
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:21,668
...first week in September.
Congratulations, Eddie."

554
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:24,296
- Harry!
- Is this our lucky day, or isn't it?

555
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:28,592
First we fall in love, and now this!
We're on the big time, baby.

556
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,595
We're on the big time.
We're gonna play the Palace!

557
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:34,431
- The Palace!
- It would have been wonderful anyway...

558
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,309
...but now it's even more wonderful!

559
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:40,604
Oh, Harry, look out!

560
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,981
Know what we'll do
after the first matinee?

561
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:45,275
- Have dinner?
- We're gonna get married.

562
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:48,278
Married. Harry!

563
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:54,451
Oh, darling!

564
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:20,519
- Well, here you are at last.
- Take a look at it. Amateur night is over.

565
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,863
Take the elevator
to your dressing room.

566
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:32,614
- Thank you very much.
- Jimmy!

567
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:34,408
- Hey, Jo!
- Hello!

568
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:37,452
- Well, I'll be two ifs and a but.
- Hello!

569
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:40,372
- Glad to see you!
- Are you opening here today too?

570
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:42,833
- What do you mean, "too"?
- What do you know?

571
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,627
After all this time,
we're all playing the Palace.

572
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:48,463
- I hope you have to follow us on!
- Listen to him.

573
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,966
We'd better get
our dressing room key.

574
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:52,551
Palmer and Hayden, please.

575
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:56,722
And after the matinee,
we'll just be using one dressing room.

576
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:02,686
Say, you don't mean to tell me
you're gonna marry this lug?

577
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:06,231
- Well, only for 150 years or so.
- What do you know?

578
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:10,027
Open at the Palace, and close
at the little church around the corner.

579
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:14,031
My gosh, Harry, that's swell.
And I hope you're a hit in both places.

580
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:16,325
Thanks, Jimmy.

581
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:20,204
- Isn't anybody gonna give a party?
- Sure, somebody's gonna give a...

582
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:22,539
I'm gonna give a party after the show.

583
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:27,836
- Wonderful! Danny will be in from camp too.
- There's no Palmer and Hayden here.

584
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:29,671
- What?
- I don't see the name.

585
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,840
It's gotta be, we open this afternoon.

586
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:36,345
Well, it is not on my list...
Oh, Mr. Waring?

587
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:39,723
- He won't give us our keys.
- We're Palmer and Hayden.

588
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:42,351
Palmer and Hayden?
You're not booked in here.

589
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:45,896
- We're not booked?
- There must be some mistake.

590
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:49,107
- Well, so here we are.
- Eddie.

591
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:52,569
Hello, Harry. Hello, Jo.
Say, you must have got in early.

592
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,696
What do you think of our big boy?

593
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:58,158
You wired us we were to play here,
and they never heard of us.

594
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:02,538
- I wired you what?
- Go on, show it to him.

595
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:04,122
Here.

596
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:08,585
This says "Palmer and Hayden booked
into the Palace New York."

597
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:11,421
- I know it does.
- Would I say the Palace New York?

598
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:14,925
Would anybody except a stenographer
who wasn't paying attention?

599
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:17,928
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's only one Palace.

600
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:20,264
Nobody has to tell you where that is.

601
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:22,516
You meant...

602
01:01:24,518 --> 01:01:28,939
- You meant some other Palace?
- Certainly. I said it. The girl got it wrong.

603
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:33,610
It's the Palace over in Newark.
You open there Wednesday for a split week.

604
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:46,957
A split week.

605
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:49,459
In Newark.

606
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:55,048
It's all right.

607
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:59,011
Why did you say "congratulations,"
"great opportunity," and build it up?

608
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:02,014
Because it is a great opportunity.
Newark's so close.

609
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:05,642
These circuits send scouts.
One might catch your act and like it.

610
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:08,687
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a great chance.

611
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:10,814
Don't give me that.

612
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:18,739
Gee, I'm sorry, kiddo.

613
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:25,245
Gee.

614
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:26,872
Gee, Jo.

615
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:34,171
Maybe you should have stayed with him.
You could be going up in that elevator too.

616
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:38,133
I'd rather stay
on the ground floor.

617
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:45,766
Well, they still got us booked
at the little church around the corner.

618
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:48,810
Still want to?

619
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:51,396
We gotta open somewhere.

620
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:57,778
Harry...

621
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:03,700
I'll marry you now.
I'll marry you anytime you say, but...

622
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:09,122
...we always agreed that we'd get married
after our first matinee at the Palace.

623
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:11,750
Let's keep it that way, huh?

624
01:04:10,267 --> 01:04:12,853
She said, "Where'd you
ride horses this summer?"

625
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,481
I said, "The same place
I did my ice skating last winter."

626
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:21,278
Well, fellas, here's to...

627
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:25,490
Well, here's to...

628
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:27,993
Here's to.

629
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,747
Say, I wonder where Danny is.

630
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:35,292
I don't know. He was supposed
to be here a long time ago.

631
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:39,004
Here he is now!
Hiya, Danny.

632
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:41,548
You know everybody, don't you?

633
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:45,135
- What kept you so long?
- Why, we got our sailing orders.

634
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:48,096
- When do you have to go?
- Right away.

635
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:54,978
- Right away?
- Yeah, I just got time to say goodbye.

636
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:58,482
Well, I guess I'm holding up the Army.

637
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,776
So long, Danny.

638
01:05:00,943 --> 01:05:02,986
- Good luck to you, kid.
- Thanks.

639
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:05,531
- Bye, corporal.
- Bye, Sid. Goodbye.

640
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:16,375
- Take care of yourself, soldier.
- Yeah.

641
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,504
I sure wish I could postpone
the war long enough...

642
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:22,798
...to hear you sing again.

643
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:24,925
Well...

644
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,845
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Danny.

645
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:20,063
See you at the Palace, kid.

646
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:22,149
It's a date...

647
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:24,318
...doctor.

648
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:33,577
Till we meet

649
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:38,457
Again

650
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:21,792
- Boy, is he hokey.
- But they like it.

651
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:36,974
They're yours.
What's left of them.

652
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:40,018
- Come on, let's show them.
- You bet we'll show them.

653
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:21,054
- Guys, I'm tired...
- Hey, you were great!

654
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:24,391
Yeah, in Newark. Where are the scouts
you said were coming?

655
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:27,519
- Well, here's one.
- Hey, were you out front?

656
01:10:27,686 --> 01:10:29,855
You wanted the Palace.
Now you've got it.

657
01:10:30,022 --> 01:10:32,858
The Palace, New York.
Keep it straight this time.

658
01:10:33,025 --> 01:10:35,944
- Hey, you mean it?
- Your audience out there meant it.

659
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:37,362
Oh, boy!

660
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:39,865
If they cheer in Newark,
you can phone it in.

661
01:10:40,032 --> 01:10:42,409
- Second week in October?
- Over a month away!

662
01:10:42,576 --> 01:10:44,620
- I won't be able to sleep!
- All right?

663
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:47,414
- You bet it is!
- Bert, about the kids' salary...

664
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:50,542
I never discuss details
in front of the artists.

665
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:53,170
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. And thanks.

666
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:57,508
- It's here, honey. This time it's the McCoy.
- Yes, darling!

667
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:01,094
Say...

668
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:03,847
Wasn't there some kind of talk
about a wedding?

669
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:07,267
Stupid, why do you think I've been
anxious to make the Palace?

670
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:10,187
- Get dressed. We gotta celebrate.
- All right.

671
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,856
You can celebrate in Newark,
can't you?

672
01:11:13,065 --> 01:11:15,859
I could lead a parade
in a telephone booth.

673
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:18,028
A month is a chance
to polish the act.

674
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:20,030
- Right.
- We can dig up a new song.

675
01:11:20,197 --> 01:11:22,783
Yeah. What kind of a song, Harry?

676
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:25,619
Harry, what kind of a song?

677
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:28,163
Honey, what kind of...?

678
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:33,210
What's the matter?

679
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:45,556
You've been drafted.

680
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:47,683
Not yet, I'm not.

681
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:51,979
- Well, Harry, it says...
- I don't care what it says there!

682
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:56,733
Think anything's gonna stand in the way
of playing the Palace?

683
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,528
Oh, no. Not even a war!

684
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:08,704
I know how you feel.

685
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:11,123
After all the plans we'd had.

686
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:17,546
- What can you do?
- Plenty.

687
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:20,799
I can do plenty!

688
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:22,301
I'll beat this.

689
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:45,365
There must be somebody else
you can try.

690
01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:47,659
Look, do you want
us both in jail?

691
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:51,246
I got two postponements.
Nothing I can do about the one tomorrow.

692
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:53,624
You have to take
your physical examination.

693
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:57,794
- But we open Monday.
- Now, look, I've done all I can do.

694
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:00,464
I got you the Palace.
I ain't booking the war!

695
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:01,715
Goodbye!

696
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:13,143
- Well?
- Nothing.

697
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,812
He says he can't do
anything about it.

698
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:28,575
I guess I'll write a letter to Danny.

699
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:31,495
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
I'll see you later.

700
01:13:31,662 --> 01:13:33,038
All right.

701
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:20,252
Harry, could I use your pen?

702
01:14:20,419 --> 01:14:22,421
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

703
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:24,214
- Nothing.
- There is something.

704
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:27,259
Well, what if there is?
Nagging me won't help!

705
01:14:27,426 --> 01:14:30,762
Kid, I wanna be alone.
Why don't you go back to your room?

706
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:33,140
I gotta think by myself.

707
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:38,353
- All right.
- Jo. Look, baby, I didn't mean it.

708
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,148
I've got the jitters, that's all.
I'm sorry.

709
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:43,567
It's all right. I understand.

710
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:42,543
- Just take a chair, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

711
01:15:44,837 --> 01:15:46,505
Temporary physical disability.

712
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:49,466
He's to return in six weeks
for final classification.

713
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:51,176
Very well, doctor.

714
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,475
Next.

715
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:03,564
Come on, Jo! Say something.
Tell me, how do I look?

716
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:06,817
Very brave, Mr. Metcalfe.
Very brave.

717
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:10,195
- Finish this for me.
- Who's ahead?

718
01:16:10,362 --> 01:16:12,906
If I don't start cheating,
I'll never get even.

719
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:14,867
- Telegram, Ms. Hayden.
- Thank you.

720
01:16:15,742 --> 01:16:19,830
You don't have to cheat if you see
the moves. You missed one right here.

721
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:36,722
Hey, Jo, what is it?

722
01:16:39,558 --> 01:16:41,185
What's wrong?

723
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:43,478
It's...

724
01:16:44,938 --> 01:16:48,400
- It's Danny.
- Danny?

725
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:52,863
Oh, Jo.

726
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,866
My brother.

727
01:16:56,658 --> 01:17:00,621
Relax, baby, the Palace is okay!
We're gonna kill them.

728
01:17:00,787 --> 01:17:02,581
What's the matter, Jimmy?

729
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:04,041
Danny.

730
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,293
- Oh, not Danny.
- He's gone.

731
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,337
There, there, now.

732
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:13,717
Oh, darling, if I could
only make it easier for you.

733
01:17:13,884 --> 01:17:16,720
You don't rate a rotten break like this.

734
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:24,228
He could have been
such a great doctor.

735
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:26,688
Great doctor.

736
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:30,734
But Danny wouldn't
want you to cry.

737
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:34,988
If he could speak to you now,
he'd tell you he was happy.

738
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,325
Remember, Jo,
Danny did what he wanted to do.

739
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:45,332
Harry.

740
01:17:45,499 --> 01:17:46,959
What happened to your hand?

741
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:49,962
It's nothing. An accident.
I caught it in my trunk.

742
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:53,507
Don't worry, baby.
It won't keep us from playing the Palace.

743
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:01,890
It was an accident.

744
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:08,188
Jo, don't you believe me?

745
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:13,151
All right then, I did do it!
But I only did it for us.

746
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,280
Well, you believe that, don't you?

747
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:22,995
Oh, I feel sorry for you.

748
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:27,124
Terribly, desperately sorry.

749
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:29,293
Jo, if you'd only listen to me.

750
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:31,879
You're always acting.

751
01:18:33,297 --> 01:18:36,800
But you'll never make
the big time.

752
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:40,512
Because you're small-time
in your heart.

753
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:48,478
There's only one thing
you can do for me.

754
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:53,025
Leave me alone.

755
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:59,531
I never want to see you again,
as long as I live.

756
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:04,828
Never.

757
01:19:38,362 --> 01:19:40,239
But it's just stiff, that's all.

758
01:19:40,405 --> 01:19:41,823
No.

759
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:44,409
It's crippled permanently.

760
01:19:44,576 --> 01:19:47,079
You mean they won't take me?

761
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:48,705
Couldn't I enlist?

762
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:51,750
No, the Army won't take you.
The tendons are severed.

763
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,878
- It won't bother you much...
- They've gotta take me.

764
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:57,047
- You can do something.
- I'm afraid not.

765
01:19:57,256 --> 01:19:59,091
Then send me to some specialist.

766
01:19:59,258 --> 01:20:01,927
Doc, I gotta get it fixed.
I gotta get in the Army!

767
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:04,930
I'm sorry. There's nothing
anybody can do to help you.

768
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:06,723
Next.

769
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:12,354
Sit down.

770
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:18,837
- Hello, Harry. How are you?
- Eddie, where's Jo?

771
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:22,591
You have to tell me. Where is she?
I have to see her.

772
01:21:23,509 --> 01:21:27,846
I'm going out of my mind. People cross
the street like I'm a house on fire.

773
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:31,308
Do something. Call someone.
Say I didn't know what I was doing.

774
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:33,769
Tell them I don't care
about the Palace.

775
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:36,855
Tell them I hope
it burns to the ground.

776
01:21:37,648 --> 01:21:41,026
Eddie, listen, you're my friend.
You can't shut me out.

777
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:44,613
All right, I made a mistake.
I did the wrong thing.

778
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,241
All right, I did the worst thing
in the world.

779
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:49,284
But I know I did it.

780
01:21:49,868 --> 01:21:53,872
Eddie, somebody's gotta believe me.
I wasn't trying to duck the draft.

781
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,168
I wanted a postponement
so Jo and I could play the Palace...

782
01:21:58,335 --> 01:22:01,505
...and get married after the first matinee,
like we planned.

783
01:22:01,672 --> 01:22:03,340
That's all I wanted.

784
01:22:03,924 --> 01:22:08,178
Eddie, look at my hand!
You don't think I wanted that, do you?

785
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:18,939
They can't shut me out.
I owe those guys that are fighting.

786
01:22:21,775 --> 01:22:23,235
Eddie.

787
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:24,862
What am I gonna do?

788
01:22:25,028 --> 01:22:27,573
I don't know, kid. It's your package.

789
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:30,033
You bought it and wrapped it up.

790
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,996
Guess you'll just have
to untie it yourself.

791
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:16,747
- Who will be the first to buy a bond?
- I will!

792
01:23:16,914 --> 01:23:19,208
- So will we!
- That's it. Step to the table.

793
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:21,585
Who wants a share of the future
of America?

794
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:23,587
Come on, folks.

795
01:23:23,754 --> 01:23:27,424
Everybody can help over there.
The nicest part of being an American.

796
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:30,427
Folks, put your hands in your pockets
and be a hero.

797
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,471
Can I have somebody...?

798
01:23:32,638 --> 01:23:34,848
Hey, Harry. How are you?

799
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:37,184
Hello, Sid. What are you doing?

800
01:23:37,351 --> 01:23:39,603
Y.M.C.A.
Going to France in two weeks.

801
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:42,272
- I thought you were drafted.
- I was, but...

802
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:46,193
Got my physical exam. They said
they'd take me after women and children.

803
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,694
Say, Harry...

804
01:23:48,987 --> 01:23:51,031
Why don't you join up
and come with us?

805
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:55,702
I'm not going over there to sing
while guys are getting their heads shot off.

806
01:23:55,869 --> 01:23:58,664
- Funny, that's not the way I look at it.
- Well, I do.

807
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:03,377
You're a good performer. Those fellas
could use a song and dance, and you...

808
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:07,673
I just thought maybe you
want to go over there.

809
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:10,467
See you around
the stage door.

810
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:39,246
Come on, fellas. Everybody out.

811
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,832
Pile out. Pile out there.

812
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,043
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

813
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,713
We don't wanna spend our last day
on leave here.

814
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,965
- I wanna go to one of them...
- Not today.

815
01:24:50,132 --> 01:24:52,259
- I got drinking to do.
- I'll take charge.

816
01:24:52,426 --> 01:24:56,513
Fall in, everybody.
Attention! Right face!

817
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,973
Forward...

818
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:59,683
What?

819
01:25:00,684 --> 01:25:03,103
C'est la guerre, old boy.

820
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:04,938
Oh, I see.

821
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:08,192
- Money.
- Oh, money. That's what you want.

822
01:25:08,358 --> 01:25:12,696
- Johnny, got any of that special money left?
- Yes, sir. I'm loaded.

823
01:25:12,863 --> 01:25:14,198
There you are, my friend.

824
01:25:17,075 --> 01:25:19,912
Ah, that's fine.
There you go.

825
01:25:22,497 --> 01:25:24,750
Wait a minute.
What about my change?

826
01:25:33,717 --> 01:25:35,761
That goes for you too.

827
01:25:35,928 --> 01:25:37,804
All right, everybody. Fall in.

828
01:25:38,931 --> 01:25:41,099
Attention! Right face!

829
01:25:41,266 --> 01:25:43,143
Forward march!

830
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:52,945
Detail, halt. Left face.
Fall out.

831
01:27:43,847 --> 01:27:45,098
Jimmy!

832
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:48,143
Come and let me put my arms
around the Palace Theatre!

833
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:49,770
How are you, baby?

834
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:54,399
- There are a lot of strangers in the world.
- My golly, let me look at you.

835
01:27:54,566 --> 01:27:56,401
- You look sensational!
- Thank you.

836
01:27:56,568 --> 01:28:00,030
How about we step out on the town
and show these Frenchmen...

837
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,823
...what you can do in Paris?

838
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:04,409
Okay, but I got a number to do.
Will you wait?

839
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:06,537
Sure, I'll wait.
You know something?

840
01:28:06,745 --> 01:28:09,706
We're a cinch to win this war
now that you're here.

841
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:11,250
I'll only be a minute.

842
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:14,461
- You sure you don't mind waiting?
- You know me, Jo.

843
01:28:14,628 --> 01:28:16,713
I'm a good waiter.

844
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:24,179
Hey!

845
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:25,639
Harry!

846
01:28:25,806 --> 01:28:28,475
- Jimmy!
- How are you, kid?

847
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:31,770
Gee, I didn't expect to see you.

848
01:28:32,104 --> 01:28:35,357
- How long you been over here?
- I just landed a few hours ago.

849
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:37,109
What do you know about that?

850
01:28:37,276 --> 01:28:40,404
It's good to see you, Harry.
How's it going?

851
01:28:42,865 --> 01:28:44,199
Not good.

852
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:48,036
I thought it'd be better over here, but...

853
01:28:48,996 --> 01:28:51,039
...it's not.

854
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:53,250
It's not better.

855
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:55,669
Well, what's the trouble, kid?

856
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:04,761
I'm in the right Army,
but I got the wrong suit on.

857
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:16,315
You got the right suit,
and the right fella's wearing it.

858
01:29:16,481 --> 01:29:19,193
- Lf you're gonna...
- I wanna tell you something.

859
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:21,945
Know what's the matter?
You walk around with...

860
01:29:22,154 --> 01:29:25,866
...a picture-book villain in your pocket.
You look at it like a mirror.

861
01:29:26,033 --> 01:29:27,784
- Look, Jimmy...
- Cigarette?

862
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:35,542
Here's something else
you can put in your book, Harry.

863
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:38,962
Here, there aren't any heroes
and there aren't any cowards.

864
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:43,717
Believe me. I've been to the place.
I've seen them.

865
01:29:43,884 --> 01:29:45,469
- Jimmy...
- Light?

866
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:52,643
They're all just regular guys.

867
01:29:52,851 --> 01:29:55,646
And they all love someone.

868
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:58,857
That's what makes them
do good things or bad things.

869
01:29:59,024 --> 01:30:02,611
You did something because you thought
it was the right thing to do.

870
01:30:02,778 --> 01:30:05,197
And you had two good reasons
for doing it:

871
01:30:05,364 --> 01:30:10,160
You wanted to get someplace that meant
more to you than anything in the world...

872
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:13,163
...and because you loved someone
an awful lot.

873
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:16,792
And those are two
pretty good reasons, Harry.

874
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:19,002
Especially the last one.

875
01:30:29,805 --> 01:30:31,473
Thanks, actor.

876
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:34,726
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Can you?

877
01:30:34,893 --> 01:30:37,020
You can buy me the biggest drink...

878
01:30:37,229 --> 01:30:41,108
Say, I just happened to think.
I got a date to meet a fella.

879
01:30:41,275 --> 01:30:44,027
Tell you what.
Sit in that chair and wait for me.

880
01:30:44,236 --> 01:30:46,613
Wait here.
I won't be gone 10 minutes.

881
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,365
Okay.

882
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:53,036
Here I come, Jimmy.
All signed, sealed and deliv...

883
01:30:56,623 --> 01:30:58,458
Harry.

884
01:30:59,585 --> 01:31:02,421
- What are you...?
- Jo.

885
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,302
Gosh.

886
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:11,221
I never expected...

887
01:31:12,431 --> 01:31:14,224
Jo.

888
01:31:16,018 --> 01:31:20,230
I certainly am surprised to see you.
For a minute, I thought...

889
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:23,400
Jo, don't talk. Just stand there.

890
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:31,992
Okay. I've got it.

891
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:39,583
How have you been, Harry?
How's everything in New York?

892
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:41,960
It's a funny thing. The other day, I was...

893
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:43,504
Jo.

894
01:31:45,297 --> 01:31:48,425
You don't have to skip rope for me.

895
01:31:48,634 --> 01:31:51,637
I know the boat has sailed
as far as we're concerned.

896
01:31:51,803 --> 01:31:56,517
And I'm not gonna tell you
the bells are ringing for me and my gal.

897
01:31:56,683 --> 01:32:01,271
I know I'm not a great guy
in a lot of people's books, but...

898
01:32:01,688 --> 01:32:04,441
...I don't care
about a lot of people.

899
01:32:06,068 --> 01:32:07,819
Jo...

900
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:10,113
...you're looking the other way.

901
01:32:13,158 --> 01:32:15,494
Coming over in the boat,
I took an inventory.

902
01:32:15,661 --> 01:32:17,746
And you know something?

903
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:22,334
Right up to this minute,
my only claim to fame:

904
01:32:23,877 --> 01:32:26,213
You were once my girl.

905
01:32:27,506 --> 01:32:29,174
Jo.

906
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,135
You have to tell me...

907
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:35,722
...not a million other people,
but you, have to tell me...

908
01:32:37,599 --> 01:32:39,810
...that I'm not a coward...

909
01:32:40,686 --> 01:32:43,438
...and that you don't hate me.

910
01:32:44,982 --> 01:32:47,860
That's the medal I want to win
in this war.

911
01:32:50,612 --> 01:32:53,240
You're not a coward, Harry.

912
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:55,409
And you know that...

913
01:32:57,786 --> 01:33:00,205
That I'd never hate you.

914
01:33:02,374 --> 01:33:03,917
Thanks, Jo.

915
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,172
Thanks an awful lot.

916
01:33:09,673 --> 01:33:12,634
And I'll take good care
of that medal.

917
01:36:52,771 --> 01:36:54,439
It's still raining.

918
01:36:54,606 --> 01:36:57,484
Let me know when it stops!

919
01:37:00,988 --> 01:37:04,741
- Cheerful little bin.
- I'd like to settle down here after the war.

920
01:37:04,908 --> 01:37:09,454
- Nurse, here are the men for the stretchers.
- I didn't think we looked that bad.

921
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:13,709
Get those stretchers. There are eight
wounded, got to be moved immediately.

922
01:37:13,876 --> 01:37:16,587
Get them into your ambulance!
Get them out of here.

923
01:37:16,795 --> 01:37:20,424
Ambulance? I'm sorry, sir.
We came here to do a show.

924
01:37:22,259 --> 01:37:24,595
- You in command here? How many hurt?
- Eight.

925
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:28,432
- Eight?! What happened to the rest?
- I sent 50 off before the barrage.

926
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:31,310
- You did? Where's the phone?
- Over there.

927
01:37:31,476 --> 01:37:34,479
Eight more ambulances are on the way.

928
01:37:34,646 --> 01:37:37,691
What? You better go back
and tell them to stop.

929
01:37:37,858 --> 01:37:40,944
- I can't. They're starting a barrage.
- Get these wounded out.

930
01:37:41,153 --> 01:37:43,614
- I can't...
- Do as I say! You, give him a hand.

931
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:47,659
You, call Belle Terre. Tell them to stop
those ambulances!

932
01:37:47,826 --> 01:37:49,453
Yes, sir.

933
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:53,457
Calling Belle Terre.
Calling Belle Terre.

934
01:37:53,624 --> 01:37:58,003
Belle Terre?! Emergency field hospital
calling Belle Terre.

935
01:38:00,255 --> 01:38:02,508
Belle Terre! Calling Belle Terre!

936
01:38:07,387 --> 01:38:08,805
- Did you get through?
- Sir?

937
01:38:08,972 --> 01:38:11,141
- Did you get through?
- Everything's fine.

938
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:12,809
Good.

939
01:38:13,018 --> 01:38:14,728
- Did you get through?
- Yeah.

940
01:38:14,895 --> 01:38:17,648
- Oh, great.
- Nice going, Harry.

941
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:38,418
Hey, that's our jalopy!

942
01:38:38,585 --> 01:38:41,213
- Where's Harry?
- I guess he's just a telephone hero.

943
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,382
I can't believe he'd run out.

944
01:38:45,968 --> 01:38:47,886
I wish I was with him.

945
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:24,942
Turn back! You'll never get through!

946
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:26,860
Look out!

947
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:20,474
Harry!

948
01:43:22,661 --> 01:43:24,204
Or more.
