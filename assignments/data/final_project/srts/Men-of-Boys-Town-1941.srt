1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,803
All right, fellows.
There'll be no more classes today.

3
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,641
Quiet down! Not so fast.

4
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,880
You've all got to be back here in an hour.

5
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,186
Now I want the band in their uniforms
and everybody cleaned up.

6
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,658
We're going to welcome home
Dave Morris.

7
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,719
Now I don't have to tell you older boys
who Dave Morris is.

8
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,731
But the new citizens ought to know that...

9
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,859
he's the best friend Boys Town has,
next to Father Flanagan.

10
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,735
And I don't have to tell any of you
who Father Flanagan is, I hope.

11
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,737
And I guess there's no doubt
that I'm the mayor around here?

12
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,173
So that's the orders now, fellows.
Everybody back here in an hour.

13
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,614
Give out with everything you've got...

14
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,617
when Dave Morris drives up
with Father Flanagan.

15
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,279
Make it sound like we just beat
Notre Dame at football.

16
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,186
- We'll shout our lungs out.
- All right, buddy.

17
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,691
- You bet your life.
- All right. Dismissed!

18
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,086
- Hello, Father.
- Good morning, Roger.

19
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,689
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Bradford.

20
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,495
I'm sorry, Father.
This letter requires your attention.

21
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,470
From the contractor,
about his last payment.

22
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,865
Well, it looks like today is my day.

23
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,644
Due on the day
the interior plastering is finished, huh?

24
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,275
The amount is $200,000.

25
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,912
$200... That much?

26
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,692
The $300,000 we underwrote originally
would have been enough...

27
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,060
if there hadn't been
those few little improvements.

28
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,962
Well, we need those two new wings,
you know. There are so many boys.

29
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,472
And, of course, that extra dormitory.

30
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,907
Don't overlook that extra dormitory.

31
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,436
We may be cramped even with that.

32
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,376
Well, I'm afraid we've gone
as far as we can.

33
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,543
After all, the bank's money belongs
to the depositors. It's not ours.

34
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,813
Excuse me, gentlemen.

35
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,855
Father, you're gonna be late for the train
if you don't hurry.

36
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,322
I made out a new basketball
schedule for you to look over, too.

37
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,087
There it is. But after you get back.
That can wait. You're late now.

38
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,186
The car's waiting outside.

39
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,163
Whitey, you're the most tyrannical mayor
that Boys Town has ever had.

40
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,996
You see, gentlemen,
I'm absolutely helpless.

41
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,502
Honest, Father. You're gonna miss
Mr. Morris if you don't hurry.

42
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,595
What do you suggest Burton write
to the contractor?

43
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,641
I'll take the finances up with Dave.
After all, that's his department.

44
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,971
Goodbye, gentlemen.

45
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,341
It'll be nice to have Dave home again.

46
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,208
A year is too long to be
without a friend like he is.

47
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,182
Yes, Father, but he needed the rest.

48
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,583
It's been a long time
since you've had a vacation yourself.

49
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,213
Whitey, my whole life is a vacation.

50
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:21,089
Father, you didn't write Mr. Morris
about the new buildings, did you?

51
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,522
No, I didn't, Whitey, I...

52
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,565
I thought I'd let Dave see
what the new buildings looked like first.

53
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,592
- You know, sort of surprise him.
- He'll be surprised, all right.

54
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:33,996
Yes.

55
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,313
- Hey, Dave!
- Eddie!

56
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,212
- I'm glad to see you.
- Hello, Mr. Morris.

57
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,444
- Hello, Whitey.
- Well, you're back at last, Dave.

58
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,985
I've missed you. We've all missed you.

59
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,783
If you don't think it took all
my willpower to stay away for a year.

60
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,551
I wanted to start home
after the first week.

61
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,148
And we wanted you to.

62
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,783
Eddie, you didn't write me
about Boys Town.

63
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,022
I've been anxious about the place.
What goes on out there?

64
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,031
Everything's the same.
No great change, Dave.

65
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,195
We're glad to see you back, Mr. Morris.
Every one of us.

66
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,727
That goes double in spades for me.
Well, what about Boys Town?

67
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,105
Well, the boys are waiting.
They want to give you a little reception.

68
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,314
- It's beautiful.
- Thanks, Dave.

69
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,580
Eddie, what about Boys Town?
What's happened there?

70
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,749
It's been a very quiet year, Dave.

71
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,056
No year is quiet where you are.
And I've been away, you know.

72
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,720
How well I know.

73
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,354
But I haven't been away long enough
to forget how you work.

74
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,560
And when you start stalling...

75
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,196
Tell me, Eddie,
what trouble have you got into?

76
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,332
Eddie, I know you've done something.

77
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,434
And when you do something
it always means money.

78
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,810
What have you really been doing?
Anything new about the place?

79
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,212
Well, we've made a few little
improvements here and there.

80
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,412
Those shrubs, for example.

81
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,323
Some new trees and some other items.

82
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,622
You know, a few little improvements
here and there.

83
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,289
Well, shrubs are all right
and trees are all right.

84
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,229
But those other items,
those few little improvements...

85
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,326
could you give me an idea?

86
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,503
- Well, Dave, here we are.
- Yes, here we are.

87
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,295
Thanks, boys.

88
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,360
It's good to be home again.

89
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,826
And it's very good
to get a welcome like this...

90
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,426
which I know comes from your hearts.

91
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,632
Put it up, Pee Wee. Put it up.

92
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,543
Well, I'm glad to see
that during the year I've been away...

93
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,741
Boys Town hasn't stood still.

94
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,220
Seem to have made a few little
improvements here and there.

95
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,454
Yeah, a few little improvements.

96
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,089
How was South America?
Magnificent, I hear.

97
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,131
Some of the most beautiful buildings
in the world, I understand.

98
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,690
Well, I didn't see any buildings down there
to compare with the new ones up here.

99
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,062
Eddie, I've got to take my hat off to you.

100
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,665
I've got some excellent cigars here.

101
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,468
Someone sent them to me, and I've been
saving them especially for you.

102
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,515
They're the finest Havanas.

103
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,176
- Those new buildings are honeys.
- Yes.

104
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,220
When we get them opened up
there'll be room for twice as many boys.

105
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,052
More boys waiting
than we'll have room for even at that.

106
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,285
I never thought you could do it
without me, Eddie.

107
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,385
Those new buildings must cost
half a million, if they cost a cent.

108
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,694
You've got a great eye for figures.
You hit the nail right on the head.

109
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,132
Well, how did you get all the money?

110
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,461
Is it true that there's a difference in the
quality of cigars as you smokers say?

111
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,235
- Or is that...
- You didn't get the money.

112
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,137
Eddie, look me in the eye.
Are those buildings paid for?

113
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,711
Now, Dave, don't make
a mountain out of a molehill.

114
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:08,948
After all, it's only $200,000.
We borrowed the other $300,000.

115
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,989
$300,000 you borrowed!

116
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,583
Well, with you, when it's borrowed,
it's nothing.

117
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,991
It's no worry. It's paid back already.

118
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,657
So there's $200,000 you
haven't even got a smell of borrowing.

119
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,997
Eddie, that's no mountain, that's the
whole Rockies and the Alleghenies...

120
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,434
thrown in.

121
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,200
Now, Dave, more boys need this place.

122
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,036
Boys need! Who doesn't need?

123
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,440
If there's any place in this world,
where people don't need...

124
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,411
tell me where it is, and I'll go there.

125
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,108
I can't turn them away, Dave.
If you could see their poor, pinched faces...

126
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,879
and their shivering bodies.
Every day they come, every night.

127
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,544
Well, I'm not in on this.

128
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,215
That's $200,000 somebody else
can start looking for.

129
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,383
Not me, not Dave Morris. So help me.

130
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,359
It isn't looking for the money
that bothers you.

131
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,453
It's the fact that you can't give it yourself,
that's what makes you angry.

132
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:56,025
I wouldn't give a penny, not a red cent.
Do you think money grows on trees?

133
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,366
Sometimes the way you manage to get it,
I think it does.

134
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,965
Now listen, Eddie.
Don't try any of your schmooze on me.

135
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,814
Hello? Where?

136
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,614
All right, put him on.

137
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,083
Yes, Judge?

138
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:20,591
Well, if it's about taking a boy in here,
I couldn't do that, Judge.

139
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,688
Not until the new buildings are opened.

140
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,297
I haven't got room for a canary right now.

141
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,098
Well, if I could be any help.

142
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,870
All right, I'll leave on the night train.
You're welcome. Bye.

143
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,939
That wouldn't be a couple of $100,000
somebody wants to give you, would it?

144
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,777
A poor boy accused of manslaughter
up in Marysport.

145
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,307
Manslaughter! I'm surprised
I'm not accused of murder.

146
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,082
$200,000.

147
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,515
Now, Dave, you'll have plenty of time
to think that over while I'm away.

148
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,255
Somebody else should think, Eddie,
not me. Include me out.

149
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,589
There aren't enough troubles
around here...

150
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,225
you've got to go a 1,000 miles
to find more.

151
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,097
The Judge thinks maybe I can help.

152
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,661
Hey, what are you doing? Get out of there.

153
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,606
- I ain't doing nothing.
- I know it. But you can't hang around here.

154
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,906
- I thought this place is for homeless kids.
- It is, but it's jam-pack full.

155
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,446
What about all them buildings?

156
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,208
As soon as they're open, there'll be room.

157
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,910
Look, there's kids come around here
all the time. Dozens every night.

158
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,749
But we just can't take care of them yet.
It's tough luck, that's all.

159
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,722
- What right you got to kick us out?
- I'm the mayor of Boys Town.

160
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,951
Mayor or no mayor,
we want to see Father Flanagan.

161
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,085
- You can't.
- Why not? He's the headman. Ain't he?

162
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,890
I'll get you some grub, that's all I can do.

163
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,488
But if you talk to him,
he's liable to give up his own bed to you.

164
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,931
Wait a minute, boys.

165
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,434
Whitey, that's a good idea of yours.

166
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,062
Have the housekeeper put the boys
in my room till I get back.

167
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,039
And give them my supper, too.
No sense in wasting food.

168
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,473
- Thanks, Father.
- Thanks a lot.

169
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,203
This way, fellows.

170
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,473
Whitey, introduce them
to the washroom, too.

171
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,948
Now I'm sure I'm home.
Never a dull moment.

172
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,351
Got any money for your railroad fare?

173
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,391
- Good thing you reminded me.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,821
- Here.
- Thanks, Dave.

175
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,554
I'll stop by the bank in the morning
and have a talk with Gorton.

176
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,533
- Maybe we can do something.
- I'm sure you'll do whatever you can.

177
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,763
I go away a year for a rest.

178
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:16,068
In one hour I'm back with you and already
I've got another nervous breakdown.

179
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,267
Has the jury reached a verdict?

180
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,201
We have.

181
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,078
The jury will rise
and look upon the accused.

182
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,949
The defendant will...

183
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,689
The defendant will face the jury.

184
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,387
In the case of the
<i>People v. Theodore Martley...</i>

185
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,195
how says the jury, guilty or not guilty?

186
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,536
Guilty of murder in the second degree,
Your Honor.

187
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,700
And if it please Your Honor, the jury
earnestly recommends mercy.

188
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,409
The court will take
your recommendation into account.

189
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,573
I realize that the members of the jury
have performed a highly distasteful duty...

190
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,844
as good and earnest citizens.

191
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,280
Because of the onerous nature
of your service...

192
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,187
I will release you from further jury duty.

193
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:43,024
If there is any reason at this time why
a sentence should not be pronounced...

194
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,496
Ted, there must be something you can say
that will help me.

195
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:55,572
There must be some reason why
you killed that guard at the reformatory.

196
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,042
Tell me why you did it.

197
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,172
Ted, can't you see that the court
is trying to help you?

198
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:07,115
I hate to think you committed this crime
without some reason.

199
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,628
Theodore Martley, you've been found
guilty of murder in the second degree.

200
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,062
According to the laws of this state,
I have no alternative...

201
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,033
but to sentence you
to imprisonment in the penitentiary...

202
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:27,095
for a term of not less than 10 years.
No more than 20 years.

203
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,333
But I will suspend execution of sentence...

204
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,004
pending consultation with
Father Flanagan and Mrs. Maitland...

205
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,570
Chairman of the State Parole Board.

206
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,543
Court will recess.

207
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,091
Ted, I want to be your friend.
I've come here to help you.

208
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,130
I've come over a 1,000 miles
just to see you.

209
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,063
Then go on back there!

210
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,398
I will after you talk to me, not before.

211
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,873
You know, there are other boys who are
waiting for me to come back to them.

212
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,409
I'm neglecting my job to be here with you.

213
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,374
And I'm going right on neglecting it
until you let me help you.

214
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,745
I don't want your help!
I don't want anybody's help!

215
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:26,060
Well, I can wait just as long as you can.
But you're going to let me help you.

216
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,798
Don't be afraid, boy.

217
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,673
You know, Ted, you've got beautiful eyes.

218
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:39,142
Why don't you look up
and let the world see how nice they are?

219
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,508
What good is helping me now?

220
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,275
Why didn't somebody help me when that
drunken guard broke my back...

221
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,748
with a two-by-four?

222
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,445
Why didn't somebody help me
when he beat me so I couldn't walk?

223
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,987
Why didn't somebody help me
when that doctor cut me up?

224
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,286
And now, I can't move my legs at all!

225
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,122
Why didn't somebody help me then?

226
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,186
So that's why you shot the guard?
He beat you, broke your back?

227
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,358
Sure. That's why! And I'd kill him again.
Do you hear that? Any time.

228
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,891
- I'd kill him again.
- No, you wouldn't, Ted.

229
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,967
What you've done,
no matter what the provocation...

230
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,341
will rest heavily upon you
for a long time to come.

231
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,673
I'm going to tell the Judge about this.
He should know.

232
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,717
I didn't tell you anything!
I didn't say anything.

233
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,046
What are you afraid of?

234
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,849
I didn't tell you anything, you hear me?
You can't say I did because I didn't!

235
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,857
lt'd only get those other kids
at the reform school in trouble...

236
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,019
- with the guards.
- I see.

237
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:35,827
Ted, how would you like to go to a place
where there are no guards? No walls?

238
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,661
There isn't any such place.

239
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,632
You said you wanted to help me.
Well, if you do, prove it.

240
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,141
Promise me you won't say anything.

241
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,380
I won't say a word to anybody
until you tell me I may.

242
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,226
That's the boy, Ted. Have a good cry.

243
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,722
That's the first step back.

244
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,956
I'm not crying.

245
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,199
I'm just tired, that's all.

246
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,670
Just tired.

247
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,066
Sure. Sure you are.

248
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,143
Take Ted into the anteroom.

249
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,987
I thought he was as hard as granite.

250
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,063
No boy is.

251
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,664
I hate to shift the natural burdens
of society to you, Father.

252
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,104
But you can see what I'm up against.

253
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:52,769
I can either parole him in your custody,
or send him to state's prison.

254
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,704
Maybe this is a judgment.

255
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,513
The only empty bed in Boys Town
is in the infirmary.

256
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,194
Where are the guards?

257
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,932
I told you, Ted, there were
no guards here and no walls.

258
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,630
Any boy is free to leave here
any time he wants to.

259
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,036
How would I leave? Roller skate?

260
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,074
Well, you might roller skate sometime
if a really fine doctor looked you over.

261
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,203
Doctors! I won't have any part of them.

262
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,182
All they do is cut you up and hurt you.
They never do you any good.

263
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,686
I knew you had some racket
getting me here. Them doctors again.

264
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,382
Well, you can have them, all the doctors!

265
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:15,557
Don't you worry, Ted. You'll never see
a doctor unless you want to.

266
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,322
You sent for us, Father?

267
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,956
- Yes.
- Hello, Mr. Morris.

268
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,364
Hello, Whitey, Pee Wee.

269
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,458
Hello, Mr. Morris.

270
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,435
Pee Wee, were you a good boy
while I was away?

271
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,938
- Yes, Father.
- Okay, go.

272
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,071
You're cold, Pee Wee.

273
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,508
Whitey, if you had something
to work out, you couldn't quite do it...

274
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,775
but you had a good friend,
what would you do?

275
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,249
Why, I'd ask my friend to help me.

276
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,343
Getting warm now, Pee Wee.

277
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:45,320
- Well, I know that you're my friend.
- You bet I am.

278
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,358
You're hot now, Pee Wee.
You're getting very hot.

279
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,929
Whitey, I've got a problem.
I want you to help me.

280
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,097
The boy that came here in the ambulance?

281
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,265
Yes.

282
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,670
Oh, you're hot now.

283
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,937
You're hot as a firecracker.
You're burning up.

284
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:28,032
Well, go on. Take a piece for every day
you were a good boy.

285
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,227
That makes six pieces, doesn't it?

286
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,226
Whitey...

287
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,273
what you do for this boy may determine...

288
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,435
whether he's going to be a cripple
for the rest of his life, or not.

289
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,035
He's had terrible things done to him.

290
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,707
He has no faith in anybody
and I don't blame him.

291
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:44,908
That's tough.

292
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,146
He won't laugh, he won't smile.
That's where you come in.

293
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,854
Anything you want, Father,
but what do you think I can do?

294
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,449
Help make him believe in people again.

295
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,517
Try to get him to smile.

296
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:00,357
If you can get him to smile,
maybe I can do him some good.

297
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:05,098
If that's the job, I'll get the gang together
and we'll make him smile, all right.

298
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,967
It's not gonna be an easy job.

299
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,803
Father, we'll have him laughing
out loud in no time.

300
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,605
- Just a smile will be all right.
- All right. Goodbye, Father.

301
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,976
- Goodbye, Mr. Morris.
- Goodbye, Whitey.

302
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,814
Pee Wee!

303
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,159
How many days was I away?

304
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,448
Pee Wee.

305
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,524
Hold out your hands.

306
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,903
Thank you!

307
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,203
- Eddie, you really think Whitey can help?
- I hope so.

308
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,770
At least he may make Ted feel
that he's part of a community.

309
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,839
That he belongs with other boys.

310
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,579
And it won't hurt Whitey any to realize
he's doing a little job of reclamation.

311
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,181
Doing some good for somebody else
will help build his character.

312
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,126
- Ted's a tough problem.
- I'm not worried.

313
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:39,220
There's no problem you can't solve,
except financial.

314
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,800
Yeah, I know.

315
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,628
The real problem is the reform school
like the one at Marysport.

316
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,139
That place neither reforms nor schools.
It maims and destroys.

317
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,198
Look at that boy, Ted.

318
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,940
His idea of society is that it's a monster
which lashes boys with a whip.

319
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,107
Beats them into submission.

320
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,379
He's a terrible example
of places like Marysport.

321
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,387
And those places have got to be
cleaned out.

322
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,821
If there were 250 Boys Towns...

323
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,427
I don't mean Catholic Boys Towns,
or Jewish Boys Towns...

324
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,488
or Protestant Boys Towns,
just places run by men of good will.

325
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,194
We could stop that factory-made
output of criminals...

326
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,830
and make good, useful,
self-respecting citizens instead.

327
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,805
Two hundred and fifty Boys Towns
he wants. Listen to him.

328
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,072
Outside are five new buildings,
not even all finished yet.

329
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,082
$200,000 we need
before we can open them up.

330
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,788
Right here we have enough worries
to take 10 years off your life and mine.

331
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,948
And 250 Boys Towns you want.

332
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,190
Youth is the greatest natural resource
of the country.

333
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,228
Whatever it costs to preserve it,
it's worth it.

334
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,527
Eddie, Boys Town was Boys Town
when it was only a shack.

335
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,057
It isn't buildings makes a place like this.
It's a man.

336
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,971
You show me 250 Father Flanagans
and I'll get you 250 Boys Towns.

337
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:03,246
<i>Don't forget, the grand prize</i>
<i>for the winner is $5,000.</i>

338
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,715
<i>Wouldn't you like to have a check</i>
<i>for $5,000?</i>

339
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,718
<i>Of course you would. Well, it's simple.</i>

340
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,187
<i>All you've got to do is write</i>
<i>the best letter of 50 words telling why...</i>

341
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,588
<i>Gossamer Soapies are kindest</i>
<i>to your dainty undies...</i>

342
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,956
<i>and win $5,000.</i>

343
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,928
This ought to win the contest, all right.

344
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,558
- Are you going into the contest, too?
- Sure.

345
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,432
This is the best job of typography
of any school paper in the state.

346
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,735
- We're a cinch to win this year's award.
- Oh, that contest!

347
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,401
I'm going to win $5,000 in a radio contest.

348
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,001
You are? And what are you
going to do with all that coin?

349
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,071
I thought we could give it
to Father Flanagan.

350
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,640
And he could maybe
buy something to help Ted with.

351
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,119
You know... like something.

352
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,053
Yeah, I guess something
would help at that.

353
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,252
Would you set my letter up
on the Linotype? Would you?

354
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:53,058
- It'll look better that way.
- You let me hear it first, huh?

355
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,770
"Dear Gossamer Soapies,
in reply to yours of even date"...

356
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,102
Wait a minute. Where'd you learn that?

357
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,337
I saw it on a letter
in Father Flanagan's office.

358
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,875
You did? Was the letter addressed to you?

359
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,675
No, to Father Flanagan.

360
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,141
Well, go ahead.

361
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,316
"Would state as follows:

362
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,721
"My dainty undies always itched
and scratched when worn...

363
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,692
"and especially the long woolly ones
in winter.

364
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,559
"Since washing them
in Gossamer Soapies...

365
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:30,201
"they don't itch me at all. Only
when I run around a lot and get sweaty."

366
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:35,672
Do you think maybe I'd better say
"Perspirey"? It's more elegant-like.

367
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,509
I'll make it "perspirey," if you can spell it.

368
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,504
Better leave it "sweaty."

369
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,708
Go put it on the Linotype.

370
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:53,351
- Hello, Whitey.
- Look, everybody, sit down.

371
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,359
We're going to have
an informal council meeting.

372
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:59,090
No parliamentary procedures.
And look, Slim, no yelling this time.

373
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,029
I can't. I got a cold.

374
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,501
I've been waiting for you guys
to pop up with a suggestion...

375
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,764
about going to work on Ted Martley,
and not a peep.

376
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,328
Now, I'm giving you one more chance...

377
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:11,102
before I take the whole situation
into my own hands.

378
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,167
Well, who's got an idea?

379
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,142
- Yes, Pee Wee?
- What about a broadcast?

380
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:20,275
I fixed him a radio extension, and he
won't even laugh at Charlie McCarthy.

381
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,442
Yes, Pee Wee?

382
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,582
I mean, we can make up a fake broadcast,
you know, and you be the announcement.

383
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,183
- I think Pee Wee's got something there.
- He has at that.

384
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,253
- You bet he has.
- That's it, Pee Wee.

385
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,922
You're a genius!

386
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,691
Mo.

387
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,040
Our last hope is to do the slow motion
rassling match, so, we'll get ready.

388
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,770
- Frank.
- All right.

389
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:34,351
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the main event of the evening.

390
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,752
A wrestling match for the
catchweight championship of the ashcan.

391
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,651
In this corner, the Maston Mopper!

392
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,230
Weighing two tons, four ounces!

393
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,924
Introducing at this time, the titleholder:

394
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,594
The Mosquito Menace!

395
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,006
Weighing four ounces, two tons!

396
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,842
All right, boys, right here. Now, look!
I want no fair wrestling in this match.

397
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,973
Biting, butting, gouging, everything goes.

398
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,146
And may the worst man win.

399
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,255
All right, boys, go to your corners
and come out fainting.

400
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,488
Say, who do you think you are, anyway?

401
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,581
Don't you realize we went
to all that trouble for you...

402
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,956
- rehearsing and everything?
- Nobody asked you to.

403
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,587
I know, but you didn't even give us
a tumble, not even a snicker.

404
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,154
And some of the stuff
was pretty good, too.

405
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,867
Now you sent all of them out of here
down at the mouth.

406
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,335
As far as I'm concerned,
you're all washed up with me.

407
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,895
And if you never laugh, it'll be too soon.

408
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,944
- Big car.
- Yeah.

409
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,584
It ain't so hot. I seen better.

410
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,881
Be swell to take Ted out
driving in that bus.

411
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,129
Stay where you are, Brian Boru.

412
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,757
Don't you go looking for any lions
to fight while we're away.

413
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,562
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland
to see Father Flanagan.

414
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,162
All right.

415
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,436
Nice pup. Good dog.

416
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:33,746
Say, you're a swell guy, doggie.
You've got plenty of what it takes.

417
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,184
You'd make friends with anybody.

418
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,054
That tickles!

419
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,655
Say, it might work at that.
Come on, we'll try it.

420
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,786
Gee, he sure likes you.

421
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,620
- You think he does?
- Sure.

422
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:51,884
- You like him?
- Yeah. He's friendly.

423
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,359
Like to have him?

424
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,927
- Could I?
- He's yours.

425
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,938
Really mine?

426
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,710
Thanks!

427
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,352
Why, you, you're...

428
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,329
Nice pup.

429
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,563
- He likes you.
- I like him.

430
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,401
- I like you, too.
- Whitey's a good guy.

431
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,442
You got to like him, too.

432
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,003
- He bawled me out the other night.
- He's my pal.

433
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,812
Do you think he'd be my pal, too?

434
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,015
Sure he will. I'll lend him to you.

435
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,320
- He smiled, Father! He smiled.
- Ted.

436
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,729
Sure he smiled, and he talked to me, too.
He said, "Thanks."

437
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,823
It's Ted Martley.

438
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,733
You'll have to excuse me.
I guess we're on our way at last.

439
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:24,049
- Pee Wee's a great lad, isn't he?
- Yeah, swell.

440
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,289
How about Whitey?
How do you get along with him?

441
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,122
He gave me this pup.

442
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,219
- Looks like a great pup.
- He is. Ain't you, fella?

443
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,759
Ted, I'd like to make a little deal with you.

444
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,174
You've been manhandled by a lot of people
who didn't know their business.

445
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:48,474
I'd like to have you looked over
by two of the best doctors in the country.

446
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,480
No. No doctors!

447
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,581
I see you're interested in football.

448
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,387
- Yeah.
- Do you know Trem Fellows?

449
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,359
Yeah, I know him. He was all-American.
Played for Nebraska.

450
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,459
Read all about him in a magazine.
He was great.

451
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,629
Yeah.

452
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,863
Just as great a surgeon
as he was a football player, too.

453
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:20,377
- Then that makes him tops, huh?
- He's tops, all right, Ted.

454
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,409
Yeah...

455
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,385
but I guess he costs a lot of money
and I haven't any.

456
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,148
I think maybe that could be handled.

457
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,693
Now, Ted, I want you to be
the boss of this thing.

458
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,700
Just let Trem Fellows look you over.
Talk to him.

459
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,293
He'll tell you
whether he can help you or not.

460
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,804
And send for me,
and I'll abide by your decision.

461
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,205
I won't try to force you
one way or the other.

462
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,642
Whatever you say goes.
What do you say, Ted?

463
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,753
Bring on Trem Fellows.

464
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,555
We'd better leave them alone.

465
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,454
I'm beginning to believe in miracles.

466
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,229
Father Ed can pull any kind of a miracle
out of an old boot.

467
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,499
Except if it has to do
with meeting a contractor's bill.

468
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,063
- And that, I suppose, is your department.
- Strictly.

469
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,541
Well, we contributed to this one.

470
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,508
You did, or you will?

471
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,707
We did. At least, it's our dog
the boy's playing with.

472
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,483
I wonder how the pup got up here.

473
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,751
I took him. Excuse me.

474
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,519
I didn't know he was anybody's
and then I thought of Ted and...

475
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:45,323
so that's how it was. I didn't really mean
to keep him for good or for keeps.

476
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,921
- I see.
- And then Ted asked me for him...

477
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,162
and I told him, yes, he could keep him.
And I...

478
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,404
- Look Mr...
- Maitland.

479
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,500
Mr. Maitland, I can't ask Ted
to give him back now.

480
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,635
It's the only thing
that ever made him smile.

481
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,145
That's an awful funny-looking dog.

482
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,116
I'll pay you for the dog.
I've got about $4 saved up...

483
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:14,419
and I make a little
doing extra printing jobs around...

484
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,791
and I'll send it to you, every cent,
if you'll only let me buy him, please.

485
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,489
- What is he worth?
- That pup?

486
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,326
About $100, I guess.

487
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,390
A hundred dollars?

488
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,935
He's worth a lot more than that
to you though, isn't he, dear?

489
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,301
Not as much as he's worth to Ted.

490
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:32,274
We'll call the deal then,
just as it stands now, even-steven.

491
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,072
You mean he can keep him for nothing?

492
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,136
I'd like to see somebody
try to take him away.

493
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,080
Thank you, sir. And thank you.

494
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,914
I mean, isn't that swell of them. Yeah.

495
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,750
I gave him a tough moment there
about the $100.

496
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,556
- But he stood up to it well.
- Very well.

497
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,290
You know, dear...

498
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,093
he's about the same age
our boy would have been.

499
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,669
Yes, about the age.

500
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,041
Whitey's a fine boy.

501
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:12,212
Of course, Whitey could never take
the place of your own son, no boy could.

502
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:16,014
He's an individual with his own character,
a very well-defined character.

503
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,555
He's a manly boy,
and if he can learn to love us...

504
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,647
we're both only too ready to love him.

505
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,955
It will make room here for one more boy.

506
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,190
I understand from Mr. Morris
that you need room badly.

507
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,731
If Whitey weren't the mayor
of Boys Town...

508
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,962
People have to get over giving up
lots of things.

509
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,499
He edits the school paper, too, you know.

510
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,906
I'm sure you've taught some other boy
here how to write English, Father.

511
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:42,241
And he's a great quarterback.
He's the best we've had here in years.

512
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,804
They play football up our way, too.

513
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,644
We've tried to do
what we could for people...

514
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,314
and there's a satisfaction in knowing
that we have accomplished something.

515
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,154
There's so much of a case history
about them.

516
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,127
And I'm selfish enough
to want something warmer...

517
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,095
something closer to me.

518
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,998
Of course, the final decision rests
with the boy himself.

519
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,404
Naturally.

520
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,844
<i>- Yes, Father?</i>
- Send Whitey Marsh in right away.

521
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,313
<i>Yes, Father.</i>

522
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,519
Of course, the boy will have to
readjust himself to...

523
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,884
a wholly new environment and...

524
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,757
that's something that he couldn't do
in a minute.

525
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,156
Who could?

526
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,690
I think it would be fairer
to you and to him...

527
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,564
if we fixed a sort of trial period...

528
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,435
of about three months.

529
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,939
That seems very fair to everyone.

530
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,804
There's something else
I think I ought to tell you.

531
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,507
And that's about Whitey's older brother.

532
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,982
He was in trouble all of his life.

533
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,509
As a matter of fact,
he was sent to the electric chair.

534
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,115
You think a lot of that boy, Father.

535
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,424
Yes, I do.

536
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:09,692
Yes. You're painting so black a picture
I suspect you of wanting to hold onto him.

537
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,001
- Whitey is...
- Anything wrong, Father?

538
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,866
No, Whitey.

539
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,406
How long have you been here now,
Whitey?

540
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,511
Three years. You know that, Father.

541
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:25,481
I suppose sometimes you've thought of
the day when you'd leave Boys Town?

542
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,449
After I graduate, sure.

543
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:34,853
Yes, others have gone before you,
others will go after you.

544
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,685
What do you mean, Father?

545
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,657
There comes a...

546
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,894
I guess you'd better tell him.

547
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,139
Whitey, my husband and I had a boy...

548
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,667
about your age.

549
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,805
- We lost him two years ago.
- I'm very sorry.

550
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,677
We're very lonesome without him...

551
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:06,382
and we have many advantages to offer
a boy who could take his place with us.

552
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,923
Yes, ma'am. I see.

553
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,058
You remind us very much of him.

554
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,726
About the same age. And Father Flanagan
tells me you're very interested in radio.

555
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:22,200
Yes. I've had the radio bug
for a long time now.

556
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,507
There's a set up over the garage
of our home. It can get anything.

557
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,238
If there are any more gadgets you want,
we'll get them.

558
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,577
We want you to come home
with us, Whitey. Will you?

559
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,108
- And leave Boys Town?
- Yes.

560
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,254
- For good?
- We hope so, Whitey.

561
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:48,321
- It's up to Father Flanagan, isn't it?
- No.

562
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,361
No, I think that's up to you, Whitey.

563
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,740
You always told me
what to do before, Father.

564
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,441
About important things, I mean.

565
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:06,076
I think this is too important.
I think this decision rests with you.

566
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:12,046
What do you feel?
What do you think I should do about it?

567
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,790
Do you want me to leave here?

568
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,850
Whitey, it isn't a question
of what I want you to do.

569
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,953
It's what's best for you.

570
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,595
I thought I was doing pretty good here.

571
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,604
You are doing good. Splendidly, Whitey.

572
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,106
You're the best helper I ever had.

573
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,271
About six months I'd graduate.

574
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:41,617
You can carry on your studies
in another school.

575
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,610
Another school?

576
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:48,548
Different fellas, everything.

577
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,188
You'll never have any trouble
making friends now, Whitey, ever.

578
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:57,666
If you don't like it with us after a fair trial,
you can come back here.

579
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,794
Is that the way you want it, Father?

580
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,500
Yes, Whitey, I do. I think that's best.

581
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,990
I'll be ready tomorrow.

582
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,888
- You found a name for him yet?
- Yeah.

583
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,458
- I call him Bohunk.
- Bohunk. That's pretty good.

584
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,532
Where you going to?

585
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,101
It's a place about a 1,000 miles
away from here.

586
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,770
- Marysport.
- Yeah.

587
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,506
I know. I was there.

588
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,283
Sorry, Ted.

589
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:55,180
- Say, could you do me a favor?
- You know I would.

590
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,753
I got a pal in the Reform School up there,
Miles Fenely.

591
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,994
- Would you go up and see him?
- Sure I will.

592
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:06,730
He can have visitors
if he hasn't lost privileges.

593
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,238
- What was the name again?
- Miles Fenely.

594
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,434
- F-A-N?
- F-E-N-E-L-Y.

595
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,477
Gee, I sure wish we could get him up here.

596
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,345
I'll look him over
and then I'll write Father Flanagan.

597
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,883
That's great.

598
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,548
- Now take good care of yourself, Ted.
- Sure.

599
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,215
You too, Whitey.

600
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,958
Bohunk.

601
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:43,332
Tell the new editor, I guess it'll be Mo,
to put this in the next issue of the paper.

602
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,068
It's my farewell to the gang.

603
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:46,905
I'll take care of it.

604
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,946
There's no nonsense in it
or any of that softie stuff.

605
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,607
I don't go for none of that crying
or any of that.

606
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:53,877
Me, neither.

607
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:57,114
I'll write you when I feel like it, see?
Just when I feel like it.

608
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,415
Me, too.

609
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,117
Writing letters is a pain in the neck.

610
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:06,719
- Yeah, I got a big set where I'm going.
- Yeah.

611
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,123
Now I know why I worked on you
to get your license...

612
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,192
- so you can keep this heap going.
- Sure.

613
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,768
I'll call you at 6:00
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday...

614
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,106
- just so you won't get stale.
- Yeah, I know.

615
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,679
- You'll listen for me?
- I'll be on.

616
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,385
It's not like I wasn't going to have
a swell time.

617
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:33,619
Gee, I wish they wanted me, too.

618
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:38,761
When you're old enough to get adopted,
I'll be rich enough to adopt you.

619
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,026
You'll remember that?

620
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:44,590
When I'm old enough
and you're rich enough...

621
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:47,795
- you'll remember, Whitey?
- I'll remember.

622
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,436
- Honest, I will.
- Whitey.

623
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,515
I'll give some thought to your problem
when I get home, Mr. Morris.

624
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,153
I hope you can see your way clear
to help us.

625
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,356
Good day, Mr. Morris.

626
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,593
A pleasant trip
to you and to Mrs. Maitland.

627
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,896
Thank you.

628
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,436
You won't forget about us, Whitey?

629
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,165
No, I won't, Father.

630
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,507
I'll try to be a credit to you
and Boys Town.

631
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,680
The Maitlands are fine people, Whitey.

632
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,390
Think of them as the mother and father
from whom you've been separated...

633
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,484
and have just found again.

634
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,028
Yes, Father.

635
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,198
Good luck, Whitey.

636
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,903
Bye, Mo.

637
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,743
You better be a good mayor
if they elect you...

638
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,441
or I'll come around and beat your ears off.

639
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,710
I've got to be elected first.

640
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,920
Hop in. My arm's getting cramps.

641
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:21,856
Okay, tough guy.

642
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,986
You can't hold onto them forever, Eddie.

643
00:49:20,113 --> 00:49:23,640
Say, wouldn't you like to sit this one out
and get a cold drink or something?

644
00:49:23,716 --> 00:49:25,183
I'd adore it.

645
00:49:31,691 --> 00:49:34,956
- Will you finish this one with me, Agnes?
- I'd adore it.

646
00:49:35,028 --> 00:49:37,326
No, that's all right, go right ahead.

647
00:49:37,397 --> 00:49:40,230
- You don't mind? You're sure?
- No. Not at all.

648
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,293
I've been much too busy all my life
to pay much attention to dancing, anyway.

649
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,737
- You know, more important things to do.
- Thanks, bud.

650
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:07,384
- Who's that homely-looking girl out there?
- That's my sister.

651
00:50:10,763 --> 00:50:13,561
- She's a swell dancer.
- Yeah.

652
00:50:25,011 --> 00:50:26,205
Look.

653
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,345
- Excuse me, dear.
- Of course.

654
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:35,209
Isn't it about time you danced
your duty dance with me?

655
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:37,351
- Yes, ma'am.
- "Mother."

656
00:50:38,224 --> 00:50:39,418
Mother.

657
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,669
- Never hit a golf ball in your life, Whitey?
- No, sir.

658
00:50:57,744 --> 00:51:01,976
At Boys Town, we always kind of thought
this was sort of a sissy game.

659
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:06,579
- Sissy game?
- That is, you played it when you got older.

660
00:51:07,086 --> 00:51:10,886
As the old Scotsman said, Whitey,
"Golf is a humbling game."

661
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:19,558
All right. Go ahead.
You take a sock at one.

662
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:23,465
You'll find out what a softie game it is.

663
00:51:24,237 --> 00:51:25,499
Yes, sir.

664
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:41,084
Here it is.

665
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,051
- I missed it.
- Yeah.

666
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:04,638
- Just put it on my bill.
- Okay, Mr. Maitland.

667
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:07,843
Sissy game? Try another.

668
00:52:07,914 --> 00:52:10,348
As the old Scotchman said,
"Golf is a humbling game."

669
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:13,146
I think I'll just walk around with you.

670
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,284
- Any news yet, Father?
- What did the doctors say, Father?

671
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,351
- Can they do anything for Ted?
- Can they fix him up?

672
00:52:22,428 --> 00:52:24,089
Is he gonna be all right?

673
00:52:24,163 --> 00:52:25,653
Doctors are with Ted now.

674
00:52:25,732 --> 00:52:29,031
We'll know as soon as they finish
their examination.

675
00:52:29,769 --> 00:52:32,636
- How about a little game of handball, Mo?
- Okay.

676
00:52:32,705 --> 00:52:34,900
- How many points will you give me?
- Eleven.

677
00:52:34,974 --> 00:52:37,465
- Twelve and I serve.
- Twelve and you serve.

678
00:52:45,418 --> 00:52:46,783
Here we go.

679
00:52:50,923 --> 00:52:52,117
Ready?

680
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:54,458
- Ready.
- Okay.

681
00:52:54,527 --> 00:52:55,755
Service.

682
00:53:04,003 --> 00:53:05,368
Your serve.

683
00:53:06,105 --> 00:53:07,834
I got him, Pee Wee.

684
00:53:08,975 --> 00:53:10,203
Service.

685
00:53:12,011 --> 00:53:14,206
I don't know how Father Ed stands it.

686
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,011
Night and day, a few hours for sleep,
that's all the free time he has.

687
00:53:18,084 --> 00:53:22,180
Me, I wouldn't work that hard to make
a million a year, net, clear of taxes.

688
00:53:22,255 --> 00:53:25,281
I've got to get in my two golf games
a week, or no go.

689
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:28,725
But all work and no play
seems to be Father Flanagan's routine.

690
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:30,023
Service.

691
00:53:40,573 --> 00:53:44,805
You're right, Dave, I don't see
how he stands up under this drudgery.

692
00:53:45,578 --> 00:53:46,738
Eddie.

693
00:53:48,247 --> 00:53:49,714
I'm sorry, Mo. We'll finish it later.

694
00:53:49,782 --> 00:53:52,342
I'm not sorry,
I wouldn't have made a point.

695
00:53:52,418 --> 00:53:55,285
- Pee Wee, come on. You want to play?
- Sure.

696
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:58,457
I'll spot you 15 points.

697
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:01,791
And probably beat you.

698
00:54:02,962 --> 00:54:03,986
I serve.

699
00:54:04,063 --> 00:54:06,156
- Roger, how are you?
- Splendid, thanks.

700
00:54:06,232 --> 00:54:07,460
You're looking well.

701
00:54:07,533 --> 00:54:10,627
Nothing like regular exercise
for keeping a man fit, Father?

702
00:54:10,703 --> 00:54:12,898
- It doesn't hurt the boys, either.
- You must be right.

703
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:15,372
I haven't seen one of them
without a big smile on his face.

704
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:17,807
If they weren't smiling,
our work would be a failure.

705
00:54:17,877 --> 00:54:19,970
There's Dr. Fellows. I want to see him.

706
00:54:23,116 --> 00:54:25,175
Father, I believe we can help him.

707
00:54:25,251 --> 00:54:29,745
It will require a very delicate operation.
In fact, two operations in one.

708
00:54:29,822 --> 00:54:32,985
I doubt if any man in America can do it
as well as Trem Fellows.

709
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:34,526
No advertising, Doctor.

710
00:54:34,594 --> 00:54:37,062
There'll be some tragically painful weeks
for the boy...

711
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,394
but the usefulness of his leg
can be restored.

712
00:54:39,465 --> 00:54:41,399
I'll be on hand for the surgery, Father...

713
00:54:41,467 --> 00:54:44,163
but the boy himself
will have to supply the faith.

714
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:47,832
You're going to fix up the boy with
the broken back so he can walk again?

715
00:54:47,907 --> 00:54:50,068
I think so, if he'll help us.

716
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:52,168
Well, I sincerely hope so.

717
00:54:52,545 --> 00:54:55,036
And, Dave, you're still going to raise
the $200,000...

718
00:54:55,114 --> 00:54:57,207
to meet the contractor's payment?

719
00:54:57,283 --> 00:54:59,308
- Leave that to me.
- Gladly.

720
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,348
Two miracles at the same time?

721
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:05,584
Well, I'll be very interested
in seeing them done. Very.

722
00:55:05,658 --> 00:55:09,025
Let's hope the day of miracles
hasn't passed. Excuse me, gentlemen.

723
00:55:11,397 --> 00:55:12,591
Sister.

724
00:55:22,608 --> 00:55:23,666
Ted?

725
00:55:23,976 --> 00:55:26,968
- How'd you like Dr. Fellows, Ted?
- He's swell.

726
00:55:27,313 --> 00:55:28,871
Do you know what he told me?

727
00:55:28,948 --> 00:55:31,644
He told me he was always scared
before a football game.

728
00:55:31,717 --> 00:55:34,015
You don't believe that, do you?

729
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:40,350
I don't think Dr. Fellows would lie to you.
Do you, Ted?

730
00:55:42,128 --> 00:55:43,789
Well, I guess not.

731
00:55:44,096 --> 00:55:47,190
But he looks to me
like he wasn't scared of anything.

732
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:50,258
Well, it's being afraid of something
and then going right ahead...

733
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:53,669
and doing what you're supposed to do
even though you are afraid...

734
00:55:53,739 --> 00:55:56,537
that's what makes
a really brave man, Ted.

735
00:55:57,243 --> 00:55:59,108
Yeah. I see.

736
00:55:59,345 --> 00:56:02,974
Like being hurt a lot and still...

737
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:07,809
What did Dr. Fellows tell you, Ted?

738
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:11,817
He said it would hurt a long time...

739
00:56:12,158 --> 00:56:15,559
worse than having your arm broken
in a football game.

740
00:56:15,628 --> 00:56:18,791
But he said he could fix me up
so I could walk...

741
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:21,428
if I wanted him to.

742
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:26,135
It must be great to be able to do things
like that for people.

743
00:56:31,143 --> 00:56:35,341
Do you think maybe it'd be a good idea
now for Bohunk to go out for a little walk?

744
00:56:35,414 --> 00:56:38,975
Yeah. Pee Wee ought to be coming
along after him pretty soon now.

745
00:56:39,051 --> 00:56:43,613
I think maybe Pee Wee might be a little
late today. Do you mind if I take him out?

746
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:46,487
No, I'd like you to.

747
00:56:47,393 --> 00:56:48,985
Come on, Bohunk.

748
00:56:56,736 --> 00:56:58,203
Here, Bohunk.

749
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:01,197
Come on, Bohunk.

750
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:06,937
He doesn't like to go out with anybody.
Pee Wee has to carry him sometimes.

751
00:57:09,415 --> 00:57:11,815
I guess I'll have to get well...

752
00:57:11,918 --> 00:57:14,318
so I can take him out for a walk.

753
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:17,111
Shall I tell Dr. Fellows that, Ted?

754
00:57:18,925 --> 00:57:21,018
Tell him I'm scared, too...

755
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:24,386
but I ain't that scared.

756
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:26,257
He'll be proud of you.

757
00:57:26,332 --> 00:57:29,392
But you'll be here when they do it,
won't you, Father?

758
00:57:29,468 --> 00:57:33,871
You promise me that, don't you?
You'll be right alongside me, won't you?

759
00:57:35,274 --> 00:57:37,242
I'll be right here, Ted.

760
00:57:41,614 --> 00:57:44,481
Go on, Bohunk.
Go out with Father Flanagan.

761
00:58:22,755 --> 00:58:25,223
W7BDF calling W9YDK.

762
00:58:27,226 --> 00:58:30,627
- Come in.
- I was waiting, Whitey. How are you?

763
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:33,824
Couldn't be better.
Say, how's Ted coming along?

764
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,664
- They're going to operate soon.
- They are?

765
00:58:37,737 --> 00:58:39,102
Pee Wee, you be sure and call me...

766
00:58:39,171 --> 00:58:41,799
the minute you find out
how everything comes out.

767
00:58:41,874 --> 00:58:43,364
Sure. I will.

768
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:48,206
Ted told me to ask you if you saw
his pal yet. Miles Fenely, he says.

769
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,249
Tell him I was over there twice,
but they wouldn't let me in.

770
00:58:51,317 --> 00:58:54,616
Tell Ted that I'm going to drive over there
again tomorrow...

771
00:58:54,687 --> 00:58:56,848
and this time I'll get in all right.

772
00:58:56,922 --> 00:58:59,755
Drive over? You mean hitchhike.

773
00:58:59,825 --> 00:59:03,261
<i>No, drive.</i>
<i>I've got my own car now, a roadster.</i>

774
00:59:04,096 --> 00:59:05,859
With a grumble seat?

775
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:09,158
Yeah, with a grumble seat.

776
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:13,069
Quit kidding me, Whitey, that ain't right.

777
00:59:14,106 --> 00:59:16,666
Wait just a minute, will you, Pee Wee?

778
00:59:16,742 --> 00:59:17,970
Come in.

779
00:59:22,248 --> 00:59:23,613
Beg pardon, Master Whitey...

780
00:59:23,682 --> 00:59:25,912
but would that be Master Pee Wee
you're communicating with?

781
00:59:25,985 --> 00:59:27,384
Nobody else.

782
00:59:27,787 --> 00:59:31,848
Pee Wee, wait just a minute.
Parsons wants to say a few words to you.

783
00:59:31,924 --> 00:59:33,949
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.

784
00:59:34,293 --> 00:59:38,730
Master Pee Wee, this is Parsons calling.
How did you fare in the radio contest?

785
00:59:39,598 --> 00:59:43,432
I didn't win it. They're a bunch of gyps.

786
00:59:44,737 --> 00:59:48,639
What? You didn't win the $5,000?
That's very regrettable.

787
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:53,675
Yes, I'm afraid the Gossamer Soapies are,
as you say, a bunch of gyps.

788
00:59:54,413 --> 00:59:57,143
And, Master... Just one moment, please.

789
00:59:57,817 --> 01:00:00,285
The master asked me to tell you, sir,
to dress this evening.

790
01:00:00,352 --> 01:00:01,819
The family is going out for dinner.

791
01:00:01,887 --> 01:00:03,980
What? I've got to put on
one of those monkey suits again?

792
01:00:04,056 --> 01:00:06,183
- That's what the master said.
- Twice in one week.

793
01:00:06,258 --> 01:00:09,386
Some night they'll find me strangled
to death by one of those stiff collars.

794
01:00:09,462 --> 01:00:10,690
Pee Wee.

795
01:00:11,864 --> 01:00:14,492
Pee Wee, I've got to get myself
wrapped up in a straitjacket.

796
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,967
So tell Ted I'm gonna go over
to that place again tomorrow...

797
01:00:17,036 --> 01:00:18,594
and I'm going to see his pal for sure.

798
01:00:18,671 --> 01:00:22,198
So long, Pee Wee, and don't let
Father Flanagan work too hard.

799
01:00:22,274 --> 01:00:24,742
All right, go ahead, you can
monkey around with it a little more.

800
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:26,243
Thank you, sir.

801
01:00:26,312 --> 01:00:29,509
- And don't "sir" me, will you, please?
- No, sir, I won't.

802
01:00:29,582 --> 01:00:32,107
Are you still there, Master Pee Wee?

803
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:49,224
- Well, if it ain't fancy-pants again.
- Yep, again.

804
01:00:49,435 --> 01:00:53,963
You're getting to be part of the scenery,
ain't you? And not very pretty, either.

805
01:00:54,206 --> 01:00:56,606
Look, I want to see Miles Fenely.

806
01:00:56,775 --> 01:00:59,073
You ain't his father,
and you ain't his mother...

807
01:00:59,145 --> 01:01:00,442
and you ain't a relative.

808
01:01:00,513 --> 01:01:04,040
This is the third time I've told you that,
and three strikes is out in any league.

809
01:01:04,116 --> 01:01:07,677
- I want to talk to the Superintendent.
- Write him a letter.

810
01:01:07,753 --> 01:01:10,381
- I did.
- Did you now?

811
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,618
And you mean to say you got no answer?

812
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:17,192
You're a great kidder, aren't you?

813
01:01:17,263 --> 01:01:19,925
If a certain friend of mine was here now
I'd get in there all right.

814
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,297
And I'm going to talk to him tonight
and tell him about this.

815
01:01:22,368 --> 01:01:25,769
Unless your pal's
the Governor of the State, don't bother.

816
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:28,636
Fenely's in solitary section for 30 days.

817
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:30,908
And nobody can see him.

818
01:01:31,443 --> 01:01:33,673
Solitary section? What's that?

819
01:01:34,146 --> 01:01:37,843
It's something that's just as well for you
that you ain't in.

820
01:01:40,152 --> 01:01:43,280
How I'd like to bend a crowbar
over your thick skull!

821
01:01:43,355 --> 01:01:46,552
- That's enough of those kind of cracks.
- Leave me go, will you?

822
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:49,992
Here, I don't have to take any guff
from you or any other brat.

823
01:01:50,062 --> 01:01:53,691
You been around here enough pestering
me. If you come back here again...

824
01:01:53,766 --> 01:01:57,964
I'll lay this across your nose so hard
I'll split it into toothpicks.

825
01:01:58,537 --> 01:02:01,028
And after this, stay clear of here.

826
01:02:27,366 --> 01:02:29,459
Come on, step on it, buddy.

827
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,441
What are you stopping for? Get going.

828
01:02:37,509 --> 01:02:41,001
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere. I just broke out of the can.

829
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,072
But don't be worried.
They won't miss me till checkup at 6:00.

830
01:02:44,149 --> 01:02:45,377
We got two, three hours.

831
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:46,941
- What's your name?
- Flip Bryer.

832
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:49,647
- What were you in the can for?
- I had a gang.

833
01:02:49,722 --> 01:02:53,180
- You had a gang of what?
- Of guys. Good, tough guys.

834
01:02:53,259 --> 01:02:54,886
I was the leader.

835
01:02:55,995 --> 01:02:58,623
- You were the leader?
- Sure, I give the orders.

836
01:02:58,697 --> 01:03:01,723
I had it all set to stick up
a swell pawn shop...

837
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,927
when some rat stooled on me.

838
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,295
Where were your folks
when all this was going on?

839
01:03:06,372 --> 01:03:08,272
All I had was Grandpop.

840
01:03:08,874 --> 01:03:11,342
They didn't give you much of a chance,
I can see.

841
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:14,106
But stickups at your age aren't so hot.

842
01:03:14,913 --> 01:03:16,881
- They never are.
- So what?

843
01:03:16,949 --> 01:03:19,281
Are you a man or a stool pigeon?

844
01:03:22,154 --> 01:03:24,622
- I'm no stool pigeon.
- All right then, step on it.

845
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:26,555
Let's get out of here.

846
01:03:26,992 --> 01:03:28,823
Not so fast.

847
01:03:29,995 --> 01:03:32,691
If it was just myself,
I might take the chance.

848
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:35,393
Who's holding you? Come on, get going.

849
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:38,864
If they caught you, there'd be a jam.
It'd get in the papers.

850
01:03:38,937 --> 01:03:40,336
What's wrong with that?

851
01:03:40,406 --> 01:03:44,240
Dillinger and Pretty Boy Floyd
got their names in the papers plenty, too.

852
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,504
Plenty.

853
01:03:45,944 --> 01:03:47,411
It wouldn't be right.

854
01:03:47,479 --> 01:03:51,313
They must feed you canary seed,
you're so yellow.

855
01:03:55,921 --> 01:03:58,253
Look, tell you what.

856
01:04:00,426 --> 01:04:03,224
I've got a good friend,
he can help you, see?

857
01:04:03,295 --> 01:04:05,320
You go back to the reformatory
for a week or two...

858
01:04:05,397 --> 01:04:08,457
You or nobody else
is gonna send me back there.

859
01:04:09,435 --> 01:04:11,232
See that? Them marks?

860
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:16,866
You want me to get 20 lashes again?
Not me, brother.

861
01:04:16,942 --> 01:04:19,410
- Not Flip Bryer.
- They do that to you?

862
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:22,879
Plenty times. Plenty.
And rub salt in afterwards.

863
01:04:22,948 --> 01:04:25,439
So, if you're scared,
I'll hop out and thumb a ride.

864
01:04:25,517 --> 01:04:28,384
- No.
- But I ain't going back there.

865
01:04:30,923 --> 01:04:32,185
No, you're not.

866
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,932
Is this the dump where you flop?

867
01:04:46,271 --> 01:04:47,602
Hey, Flip...

868
01:04:48,507 --> 01:04:50,338
are you always as tough as this?

869
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:55,176
Say, with the guys I hang out with,
you're either tough, or you're out of town.

870
01:04:55,714 --> 01:04:59,150
And I don't suppose it hurts any
in the reformatory, either?

871
01:04:59,218 --> 01:05:03,177
You bet it don't. If you turn soft in there,
you're a dead fish.

872
01:05:05,424 --> 01:05:06,584
I see.

873
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:09,223
You certainly put on a swell act.

874
01:05:09,294 --> 01:05:12,559
If you think it's an act,
put them up and find out.

875
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,667
Okay, so you're tough.

876
01:05:21,673 --> 01:05:22,799
What's that?

877
01:05:22,975 --> 01:05:25,569
<i>Tommy-gun Tomcats.</i> It's great.

878
01:05:25,644 --> 01:05:29,637
It's all about stickups and bank jobs
and shooting it out with the law.

879
01:05:29,715 --> 01:05:33,173
You can learn plenty from a book like this.
Plenty.

880
01:05:33,252 --> 01:05:35,186
Yeah, sure you can.

881
01:05:35,254 --> 01:05:38,519
How to get back to the reformatory,
and then to the penitentiary.

882
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:41,684
Don't worry about me. I'm bad medicine.

883
01:05:41,827 --> 01:05:44,796
- I started bad and I'm gonna end bad.
- No.

884
01:05:45,164 --> 01:05:46,631
No, you're not.

885
01:05:46,698 --> 01:05:49,690
- There's no such thing as a bad boy.
- Baloney.

886
01:05:49,802 --> 01:05:52,032
Yeah, that's what I said once, too, but...

887
01:05:52,104 --> 01:05:54,595
- somebody taught me different.
- Who?

888
01:05:54,673 --> 01:05:57,039
A great guy. A priest.

889
01:05:57,309 --> 01:06:01,040
- A Holy Joe.
- You can't talk...

890
01:06:03,382 --> 01:06:04,713
Forget it.

891
01:06:04,983 --> 01:06:06,814
You know, I'd like to get you to a school...

892
01:06:06,885 --> 01:06:08,910
where there's no guards or fences
or punishment.

893
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:11,512
What brand do you smoke, sweetheart?

894
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,653
I'm going over to the house
for a few minutes.

895
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:20,755
Now, don't poke your nose outside
till I get back.

896
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:24,701
Go ahead, ankle out.
I gotta catch up on my reading.

897
01:06:25,604 --> 01:06:28,835
I'll be back in a few minutes
with something to eat.

898
01:06:28,907 --> 01:06:30,397
And some milk.

899
01:06:53,665 --> 01:06:55,394
There we are, Flip.

900
01:06:56,134 --> 01:06:57,226
Flip?

901
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,138
Why, you bone-headed numbskull!

902
01:07:37,943 --> 01:07:41,470
Turned copper?
Fine business. I'll square this with you.

903
01:07:41,547 --> 01:07:43,242
- Why you...
- What's going on here?

904
01:07:43,315 --> 01:07:44,782
Nothing, mister.

905
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:47,148
Okay, Flip. You don't have to do any more.

906
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:49,847
You're initiated. You're in the club.

907
01:07:50,522 --> 01:07:52,888
I didn't think he'd have nerve enough
to get to the door even.

908
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:56,325
What do you mean, nerve?
I got in here all it takes for anything.

909
01:07:56,395 --> 01:07:58,829
What do you know?
He's still putting on the act.

910
01:07:58,897 --> 01:08:01,832
- It don't seem like an act to me.
- He was being initiated.

911
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,926
We thought he'd lose his nerve.
He sure surprised me.

912
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:07,267
- Imagine what he would have done to me?
- Yeah.

913
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:09,830
I've sure got to hand it to you.
You've got what it takes, Flip.

914
01:08:09,908 --> 01:08:12,069
Hope he didn't scare you too much.

915
01:08:16,515 --> 01:08:20,212
- What right you got, queering my racket?
- I'm only trying to keep you out of jail.

916
01:08:20,285 --> 01:08:22,776
Thanks for nothing.
After this, keep your own nose clean.

917
01:08:22,854 --> 01:08:24,219
- Understand?
- Sure, I understand.

918
01:08:24,289 --> 01:08:27,349
You're going to be up to your neck
in trouble unless I get you out of here.

919
01:08:27,426 --> 01:08:30,589
And I'm going to do
something about that tonight.

920
01:08:30,862 --> 01:08:32,193
No tricks.

921
01:08:35,701 --> 01:08:37,726
Sorry we bothered you. So long, mister.

922
01:08:42,574 --> 01:08:45,907
<i>W9YDK. Come in, Whitey.</i>

923
01:08:47,879 --> 01:08:52,339
W7BDF back to W9YDK.
I thought I'd find you on, Pee Wee.

924
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:55,909
Listen, can you get Father Flanagan
to talk to me now? It's important.

925
01:08:55,988 --> 01:08:57,785
Not tonight, Whitey.

926
01:08:57,856 --> 01:09:01,587
He went in to Omaha.
He's got to make a speech or something.

927
01:09:02,027 --> 01:09:04,757
I'll ask him to talk tomorrow night though.

928
01:09:05,197 --> 01:09:09,429
Tomorrow morning. The first thing.
It's very important. Now, don't forget.

929
01:09:09,501 --> 01:09:11,492
<i>I'll remember, all right.</i>

930
01:09:12,904 --> 01:09:16,601
Go to bed. You're up awful late.
Good night, Pee Wee.

931
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,183
What are you trying to hide? Money?

932
01:09:30,255 --> 01:09:32,883
If you don't ask questions,
you won't get answers.

933
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:35,483
And if you don't get answers,
you'll never know anything...

934
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,425
that'll hurt you, see?

935
01:09:38,163 --> 01:09:40,961
- Did you steal it?
- No, I won it in a crap game.

936
01:09:41,033 --> 01:09:43,797
- Crap game.
- So it was a poker game.

937
01:09:44,736 --> 01:09:47,830
- Come on. Give me the money.
- What do I look like, a chump?

938
01:09:47,906 --> 01:09:49,840
Give me the money
or I'll take it away from you!

939
01:09:49,908 --> 01:09:52,138
- Hijacking a pal.
- I'm going to give it back...

940
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:55,407
- to whoever you took it away from.
- You and what regiment?

941
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:58,907
Where'd you get it? Tell me!

942
01:09:59,017 --> 01:10:01,918
- A gas station.
- We're gonna take it right back now.

943
01:10:02,287 --> 01:10:04,687
A copper. A double-crossing copper.

944
01:10:04,756 --> 01:10:07,554
Why, I'll copper you.

945
01:10:27,612 --> 01:10:30,604
Pull over to the curb
and turn your lights on.

946
01:10:32,851 --> 01:10:35,046
Come on, get out of that car.

947
01:10:38,356 --> 01:10:39,345
Are these the ones?

948
01:10:39,424 --> 01:10:41,858
- That's them.
- The little one's him, all right.

949
01:10:41,927 --> 01:10:44,327
- Stuck a gun in my ribs, he did.
- How much you missing?

950
01:10:44,396 --> 01:10:45,886
- Eighty-eight dollars.
- Reach.

951
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:51,726
It ought to be all here.
They haven't had time to spend any yet.

952
01:10:51,803 --> 01:10:53,202
- Here.
- Not yet. Evidence.

953
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:54,602
He didn't cop that dough.

954
01:10:54,673 --> 01:10:56,903
He ain't got the nerve
to pull a job like that.

955
01:10:56,975 --> 01:10:59,170
Okay, baby face. You can straighten it out
with the judge.

956
01:10:59,244 --> 01:11:02,236
Don't listen to him. He likes to talk tough.
He had nothing to do with it.

957
01:11:02,314 --> 01:11:05,283
Anybody you want to pick up
before we go to the precinct?

958
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:06,749
No. Nobody.

959
01:11:06,818 --> 01:11:09,810
Get in the car. We're going for a little ride.

960
01:11:10,655 --> 01:11:12,122
Come on, you.

961
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:14,756
Come on, get in there.

962
01:11:19,431 --> 01:11:21,899
Hey, broadbeam, quit crowding.

963
01:11:29,441 --> 01:11:30,965
Straight ahead.

964
01:11:37,849 --> 01:11:39,976
You knew that he escaped
from the reformatory?

965
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:41,109
Yes, sir.

966
01:11:41,186 --> 01:11:43,381
- And you had him living in your den?
- I did.

967
01:11:43,455 --> 01:11:46,185
- Good evening, Lieutenant.
- How do you do, Mr. Maitland?

968
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:49,659
- How are you, Whitey?
- I'm sorry this had to happen, sir.

969
01:11:49,728 --> 01:11:52,925
I have the records
if you'd like to look at them.

970
01:11:52,998 --> 01:11:54,863
Whitey Marsh's brother.

971
01:11:54,933 --> 01:11:58,562
Reformatory, one trick in the penitentiary,
and then the chair.

972
01:11:58,637 --> 01:12:01,731
Yes, I knew about that.
Father Flanagan told me.

973
01:12:02,407 --> 01:12:04,568
And the little boy's record.

974
01:12:10,048 --> 01:12:13,506
- That baby?
- Hey, watch what you're saying.

975
01:12:14,486 --> 01:12:17,478
Associating with young criminals
of 14 and 16.

976
01:12:17,989 --> 01:12:19,217
Amazing.

977
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:24,089
- Did you know about this?
- When he told me, I wouldn't listen to him.

978
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:26,392
I just thought
he was shooting his mouth off.

979
01:12:26,464 --> 01:12:27,726
Oh, sure.

980
01:12:28,099 --> 01:12:30,431
All those reform school kids
stick together...

981
01:12:30,502 --> 01:12:32,367
just like their older brothers.

982
01:12:32,437 --> 01:12:34,632
I was never in reform school.

983
01:12:34,706 --> 01:12:37,937
- You were at Boys Town, weren't you?
- Boys Town isn't a reform school.

984
01:12:38,009 --> 01:12:40,034
It's as good as any school in the country.
Better.

985
01:12:40,111 --> 01:12:43,205
When a school's got a lot of kids in it
with criminal records...

986
01:12:43,281 --> 01:12:45,511
- it's reform school to me.
- You're a liar!

987
01:12:45,584 --> 01:12:47,848
Perhaps you'd better let me
talk to him alone.

988
01:12:47,919 --> 01:12:49,716
All right, sir. In there.

989
01:12:49,788 --> 01:12:51,221
- This way, Whitey.
- Yes, sir.

990
01:12:59,865 --> 01:13:03,562
He sure told you off.
How do you like them onions?

991
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:11,934
Why didn't you tell me about the boy?

992
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,205
Why, I wanted to keep you and Mrs...

993
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:15,712
Mother, out of it.

994
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:17,907
It's developed into quite a mess, Whitey.

995
01:13:17,983 --> 01:13:21,942
I tried to get Father Flanagan on the radio,
but he wasn't at Boys Town.

996
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,284
You were going to ask Father Flanagan
for advice?

997
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:25,846
Yes, sir. He'd know what to do.

998
01:13:25,924 --> 01:13:28,256
There isn't very much he could do,
or anyone else...

999
01:13:28,326 --> 01:13:30,590
for such an incorrigible little thief.

1000
01:13:30,662 --> 01:13:33,529
- That young scamp is thoroughly bad.
- Oh, no, sir.

1001
01:13:33,598 --> 01:13:35,657
There is no such thing as a bad boy.

1002
01:13:35,734 --> 01:13:38,134
That, I suppose, is something you learned
from Father Flanagan.

1003
01:13:38,203 --> 01:13:40,171
Yes, sir.
That's why I was trying to help Flip.

1004
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:42,263
You see,
I wanted to keep you out of it altogether.

1005
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,968
I was going to handle it.
Just me and Father Flanagan.

1006
01:13:45,043 --> 01:13:48,877
That attitude is completely wrong
for any member of my family, Whitey.

1007
01:13:48,947 --> 01:13:52,110
You belong with me,
on the side of law and order.

1008
01:13:52,183 --> 01:13:54,777
You mean
that I shouldn't try to help people?

1009
01:13:54,853 --> 01:13:56,912
No, Whitey, that isn't what I mean.

1010
01:13:56,988 --> 01:13:59,047
But you should pick people worthy of help.

1011
01:13:59,124 --> 01:14:00,455
Nobody needs it more than Flip.

1012
01:14:00,525 --> 01:14:02,720
Why, he'll become a criminal
if they keep him in Marysport.

1013
01:14:02,794 --> 01:14:04,819
That's where he learned
about sticking people up.

1014
01:14:04,896 --> 01:14:06,887
The boy was born
with criminal tendencies.

1015
01:14:06,965 --> 01:14:09,331
- I won't believe that.
- You must.

1016
01:14:09,935 --> 01:14:12,768
After all, you should accept my standards.

1017
01:14:13,171 --> 01:14:16,732
And forget everything
that Father Flanagan has taught me?

1018
01:14:17,676 --> 01:14:22,238
Whitey, you have a strange idea that
yours is a mission to reform humanity.

1019
01:14:23,048 --> 01:14:27,178
That's wrong, as many of
Father Flanagan's ideas are equally wrong.

1020
01:14:28,086 --> 01:14:31,021
Don't you say anything
about Father Flanagan.

1021
01:14:31,356 --> 01:14:32,880
Don't you ever.

1022
01:14:37,862 --> 01:14:40,194
You did that all by yourself?

1023
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:41,926
Come on, let's go.

1024
01:14:42,734 --> 01:14:45,931
- Where do you think you're going?
- Downstairs to my cell.

1025
01:14:46,004 --> 01:14:49,701
But we can only keep one houseguest
and that's the big boss, not you.

1026
01:14:49,774 --> 01:14:52,675
You can't do that to me.
I got a right to a cell.

1027
01:14:52,744 --> 01:14:54,837
I'm the real boss. I did all the work.

1028
01:14:54,913 --> 01:14:58,440
You ain't going to make me no softie
sitting around here with a bunch of bulls.

1029
01:14:58,516 --> 01:15:01,246
Sling me into a cell.
I can do time standing on my head.

1030
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:03,787
Now, look,
you're going to do time right here...

1031
01:15:03,855 --> 01:15:06,688
until the bus comes to take you back
to the reform school.

1032
01:15:06,758 --> 01:15:09,124
- Joe, get the kid a glass of milk.
- Yes, sir.

1033
01:15:09,194 --> 01:15:10,491
Hot milk.

1034
01:15:21,606 --> 01:15:24,268
- How does it look?
- Dark. Very dark.

1035
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:28,438
- Whitey's story is difficult to believe.
- That's terrible.

1036
01:15:28,913 --> 01:15:30,904
Don't you think
that my being on the parole board...

1037
01:15:30,982 --> 01:15:34,918
No, dear, he's the one boy
you can't possibly use your influence for.

1038
01:15:34,986 --> 01:15:36,817
We've got to do something.

1039
01:15:36,888 --> 01:15:39,789
I'm afraid Whitey's in the position
of the general's son...

1040
01:15:39,858 --> 01:15:41,758
he'll have to face the music.

1041
01:16:03,381 --> 01:16:05,872
All out. Come on, follow me.

1042
01:16:13,892 --> 01:16:15,655
Hey, what's that?

1043
01:16:17,762 --> 01:16:19,662
Duck waddle. Punishment.

1044
01:16:19,731 --> 01:16:23,258
- Yeah? How long do they keep it up?
- Till they drop.

1045
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:25,632
Here, what's all the gab about?

1046
01:16:26,337 --> 01:16:28,897
Well, if it ain't fancy-pants.

1047
01:16:29,174 --> 01:16:33,838
Helped the kid get away, didn't you?
And got me fined three days' pay.

1048
01:16:41,152 --> 01:16:43,484
If you didn't have that club...

1049
01:16:43,855 --> 01:16:45,413
This is elegant.

1050
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:53,024
Get up!

1051
01:17:01,106 --> 01:17:03,097
Here, fall in there, you.

1052
01:17:03,508 --> 01:17:06,568
We'll start cutting you down to size
right now.

1053
01:17:09,481 --> 01:17:13,008
- Flip, where's Miles Fenely?
- In solitary.

1054
01:17:13,084 --> 01:17:14,984
Watch out for the guard, he's tough.

1055
01:17:15,053 --> 01:17:19,217
Sure, he's tough in here with plenty of
other guards and clubs to back him up.

1056
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:20,314
Jiggers.

1057
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:21,483
Halt!

1058
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,720
- What were you saying?
- I was talking to myself.

1059
01:17:24,796 --> 01:17:28,288
Well, quit talking to yourself.
Quit thinking to yourself, remember that.

1060
01:17:28,366 --> 01:17:31,335
Around here we don't tell anybody
anything twice.

1061
01:17:31,402 --> 01:17:33,267
All right, get moving!

1062
01:17:34,339 --> 01:17:37,001
You know, Whitey ain't so bad
when you get to know him.

1063
01:17:37,075 --> 01:17:39,270
Of course,
he's got a little stool pigeon in him...

1064
01:17:39,344 --> 01:17:41,642
but after he's done some time
he'll get over that.

1065
01:17:41,713 --> 01:17:43,044
Jiggers.

1066
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,721
Still the wise guy, ain't you?

1067
01:17:57,795 --> 01:17:59,626
No, I'm no wise guy.

1068
01:18:03,735 --> 01:18:05,327
Hey, lay off me.

1069
01:18:07,572 --> 01:18:10,132
Say, why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

1070
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,301
I've been waiting for this.

1071
01:18:38,403 --> 01:18:40,394
You can talk all you want to in here.

1072
01:18:40,471 --> 01:18:43,304
Shout your head off.
Nobody will ever hear you.

1073
01:18:44,676 --> 01:18:46,769
Whitey, I'm scared.

1074
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:54,415
It's Fenely, Miles Fenely!

1075
01:18:59,591 --> 01:19:02,059
This kid's hurt. He's dead.

1076
01:19:02,393 --> 01:19:04,486
They beat him and beat him.

1077
01:19:07,966 --> 01:19:10,434
You kids ain't seen nothing, I tell you.

1078
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:13,095
He's dead. That's what he is, dead.

1079
01:19:13,571 --> 01:19:15,198
You killed him.

1080
01:19:15,273 --> 01:19:16,865
You're only imagining things.

1081
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:20,138
Kids always think they see something
when they first come in here.

1082
01:19:20,211 --> 01:19:23,203
I saw it, I tell you. I can still see it.

1083
01:19:23,281 --> 01:19:26,808
We'll go to the Superintendent.
He'll convince you, you're wrong.

1084
01:19:26,884 --> 01:19:28,977
You're just seeing shadows.

1085
01:19:29,754 --> 01:19:31,153
You killed him.

1086
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:35,856
Yes, that's too bad about Fenely.
But he always did have a weak heart.

1087
01:19:35,927 --> 01:19:38,054
You know he didn't. He was beaten up.

1088
01:19:38,129 --> 01:19:40,324
The doctor reported heart failure,
didn't he?

1089
01:19:40,398 --> 01:19:42,593
That's right. Signed the death certificate.

1090
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:45,101
- You must have been imagining things.
- No, I wasn't.

1091
01:19:45,169 --> 01:19:46,295
Or seeing shadows.

1092
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:48,896
Fenely was dead for hours, poor boy.

1093
01:19:49,073 --> 01:19:51,041
You know what happened to him.

1094
01:19:51,109 --> 01:19:54,101
I saw him beat up, all right! I saw him.

1095
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:58,340
Now, look, Whitey.
You seem to be an intelligent boy.

1096
01:19:58,716 --> 01:20:01,879
I could use you doing clerical work
in my office.

1097
01:20:02,453 --> 01:20:04,853
No, you don't. That boy was beaten up.

1098
01:20:04,922 --> 01:20:08,551
You're smart enough to take
a doctor's report about how he died.

1099
01:20:08,626 --> 01:20:11,254
You've got the doctors bulldozed, too.

1100
01:20:11,429 --> 01:20:15,229
Things can be easy for an inmate here,
or very tough...

1101
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,665
just as he makes them himself.

1102
01:20:17,735 --> 01:20:21,262
I saw him keel over, and you can't talk me
out of it, you can't buy me off.

1103
01:20:21,339 --> 01:20:22,670
Take him back to solitary.

1104
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:25,072
Think it over, all by yourself.

1105
01:20:25,143 --> 01:20:28,738
And when you realize that
you've been seeing things, send me word.

1106
01:20:28,813 --> 01:20:29,871
Come on.

1107
01:20:29,947 --> 01:20:32,108
Flip. I want to talk to you some more.

1108
01:20:32,183 --> 01:20:35,311
You're just covering up,
trying to keep it quiet to save your job.

1109
01:20:35,386 --> 01:20:37,650
Trying to scare Flip into lying.
Well, you can't scare me!

1110
01:20:37,722 --> 01:20:40,555
- Do you hear that? You can't scare me.
- Take him away.

1111
01:20:41,993 --> 01:20:43,324
Now, Flip.

1112
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,137
I'd like to see Whitey Marsh.

1113
01:20:56,207 --> 01:20:58,141
- Got a pass?
- No, I haven't.

1114
01:20:58,209 --> 01:21:01,178
You can't go in then.
The rules call for a pass.

1115
01:21:01,245 --> 01:21:05,204
- Well, where can I get a pass?
- The Superintendent, I guess.

1116
01:21:05,283 --> 01:21:07,751
Well, then,
I'd like to see the Superintendent.

1117
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:10,344
He ain't seeing anybody just now.

1118
01:21:10,421 --> 01:21:13,982
- When does he see people?
- Well, now, that's hard to say.

1119
01:21:16,127 --> 01:21:18,789
- You'd better let me see him.
- I can't.

1120
01:21:19,097 --> 01:21:22,396
- Why not?
- He's away on vacation.

1121
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,863
I want to see Whitey Marsh.

1122
01:21:28,806 --> 01:21:31,536
I said I want to see Whitey Marsh.

1123
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:36,709
- Who did you say?
- Whitey Marsh.

1124
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:48,357
I don't care what he's in,
I want to see Whitey Marsh.

1125
01:21:48,426 --> 01:21:51,884
I'm telling you, he's in solitary.
Nobody can see him.

1126
01:21:51,963 --> 01:21:56,229
And I'm telling you, and I'm telling you
for the last time, I want to see him.

1127
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:00,202
If you was the President... He's in solitary.
Nobody can see him.

1128
01:22:00,905 --> 01:22:05,342
And if you had that collar turned around,
I'd convince you pretty quick.

1129
01:22:18,055 --> 01:22:20,717
I told you I want to see Whitey Marsh.

1130
01:22:22,059 --> 01:22:23,151
Okay.

1131
01:22:49,086 --> 01:22:52,453
- I came as soon as I heard, Whitey.
- I knew you would, Father.

1132
01:22:52,523 --> 01:22:53,922
How did all this happen?

1133
01:22:53,991 --> 01:22:55,982
Well, there was a kid.
He thought he was tough.

1134
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:58,756
His name was Flip Bryer,
and I tried to help him.

1135
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:00,058
There's no crime in that.

1136
01:23:00,131 --> 01:23:02,497
Yeah, but I didn't want to drag
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland into it.

1137
01:23:02,567 --> 01:23:05,934
- They've been so good to me, in a way.
- Sure. I know.

1138
01:23:06,003 --> 01:23:08,938
Well, this kid had my gun,
he got it out of my den.

1139
01:23:09,006 --> 01:23:12,237
He had it at the pawn shop,
he'd already held up the gas station...

1140
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:14,335
and I had the money on me.

1141
01:23:14,912 --> 01:23:19,246
Well, you certainly fixed yourself up right
while you were about it, didn't you?

1142
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:21,944
Yeah, I didn't do any credit to you
or Boys Town...

1143
01:23:22,019 --> 01:23:24,715
getting it in the papers and everything.

1144
01:23:24,989 --> 01:23:27,355
I don't blame you if you're sore at me,
Father.

1145
01:23:27,425 --> 01:23:29,552
Why should I be sore at you?

1146
01:23:29,627 --> 01:23:31,822
On the contrary, I'm proud of you.

1147
01:23:31,896 --> 01:23:33,796
If you had turned your back on that boy...

1148
01:23:33,865 --> 01:23:35,958
if you had played safe
and ignored the plea for help...

1149
01:23:36,033 --> 01:23:38,433
I'd have been ashamed of you,
but you didn't.

1150
01:23:38,503 --> 01:23:40,300
You may not have been wise, Whitey...

1151
01:23:40,371 --> 01:23:43,738
but you certainly lived up
to the best teachings of Boys Town.

1152
01:23:43,808 --> 01:23:46,038
Then you're not ashamed of me?

1153
01:23:46,644 --> 01:23:49,738
I'm prouder of you
than any boy I've ever known.

1154
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:52,049
Gee, you're a great guy.

1155
01:23:54,585 --> 01:23:57,748
I think this is about enough
of the mutual admiration, don't you?

1156
01:23:57,822 --> 01:23:58,811
Yeah.

1157
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:00,983
- Yeah, let's see what we can do for Flip.
- Yeah.

1158
01:24:04,095 --> 01:24:07,064
Mrs. Fenely's inside.
She wants to see you.

1159
01:24:07,131 --> 01:24:09,622
- How is she?
- Taking it hard.

1160
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:10,997
No wonder.

1161
01:24:11,068 --> 01:24:14,731
I thought that maybe...
Well, a man of your cloth...

1162
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:17,433
Perhaps you could talk to her, Father.

1163
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:23,203
Get Whitey and Flip ready.
I'm taking them over to see the Judge.

1164
01:24:23,281 --> 01:24:25,146
All right. Come on.

1165
01:24:47,672 --> 01:24:50,698
I heard you were here, Father.
I just had to see you.

1166
01:24:50,775 --> 01:24:53,972
This horrible place,
it must be wiped out, Father.

1167
01:24:54,478 --> 01:24:57,208
You must stay here and help wipe it out.

1168
01:24:58,249 --> 01:25:01,343
Then I'll know that my boy went
for some reason.

1169
01:25:02,253 --> 01:25:04,050
You'll do it, Father?

1170
01:25:04,455 --> 01:25:07,913
You won't leave Marysport
till you've done it, promise?

1171
01:25:10,127 --> 01:25:13,096
Well, I'm needed at Boys Town at present.

1172
01:25:13,798 --> 01:25:15,595
- A promise l...
- No, no.

1173
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:19,033
If you go, something else,
there'll be something else.

1174
01:25:19,737 --> 01:25:23,332
You must help the boys here, Father.
You must.

1175
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:34,612
I have learned that boys
have an inflexible sense of honor.

1176
01:25:35,052 --> 01:25:37,577
And that they never betray a trust.

1177
01:25:38,022 --> 01:25:41,458
Give them confidence
and they will return you loyalty.

1178
01:25:42,727 --> 01:25:46,128
And that is why this system
of punishment for boys is wrong.

1179
01:25:46,197 --> 01:25:48,461
It's based upon the wrong principle.

1180
01:25:48,532 --> 01:25:51,467
It's based upon suspicion
rather than belief.

1181
01:25:51,769 --> 01:25:54,704
There is no redemption for youth
in the lash.

1182
01:25:55,306 --> 01:25:57,774
There is no healing of the wounded spirit...

1183
01:25:57,842 --> 01:26:01,107
in lonely confinement in a cell
on bread and water.

1184
01:26:01,312 --> 01:26:04,304
Such institutions
cannot bring about reform.

1185
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:09,818
They feed their victims on the poison
of revenge, on the red lore of criminality.

1186
01:26:10,021 --> 01:26:14,151
They turn out youths who are resolved
to take vengeance on society.

1187
01:26:15,559 --> 01:26:18,027
Such misnamed reform schools...

1188
01:26:18,095 --> 01:26:20,825
which are really prisons for boys...

1189
01:26:20,898 --> 01:26:23,332
should be wiped out of existence!

1190
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:29,866
Father, this now paroles Flip
into your custody.

1191
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,237
Thank you, Your Honor.

1192
01:26:31,308 --> 01:26:34,471
You can go back to Boys Town
proud of the work you've started here.

1193
01:26:34,545 --> 01:26:37,639
- I promise you we'll carry it on.
- Well, I am proud of the work.

1194
01:26:37,715 --> 01:26:40,775
It's a crusade that must be stirred
in every section of the country.

1195
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:43,649
- We'll keep it going here, Father.
- I'm sure you will.

1196
01:26:43,721 --> 01:26:46,884
Whitey, are you still determined
to go back to Boys Town?

1197
01:26:46,957 --> 01:26:48,083
Yes, sir, I am.

1198
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:49,524
But think, Whitey...

1199
01:26:49,593 --> 01:26:53,962
do you want to give up golf and tennis
and your car, and everything?

1200
01:26:54,632 --> 01:26:57,931
I want to be with Father Flanagan,
Mother... Ma'am.

1201
01:27:00,938 --> 01:27:03,930
Well, thanks again. Goodbye. Thank you.

1202
01:27:08,813 --> 01:27:12,180
Dave, my boy, there's a great decency
inherent in the human race.

1203
01:27:12,249 --> 01:27:14,911
Well, I'm glad to hear you think so.
Personally, I've got my doubts.

1204
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,953
Dave,
the people of Marysport are aroused.

1205
01:27:17,021 --> 01:27:19,012
There'll be a Boys Town there
one of these days...

1206
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:20,717
and that's a start, Dave, a great start.

1207
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:23,385
So that's where you were all this time,
starting another Boys Town.

1208
01:27:23,461 --> 01:27:27,192
- Trying to. What about you?
- Me? I've been trying to keep one open.

1209
01:27:27,264 --> 01:27:29,630
Now, Dave, no mountains, just molehills.

1210
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,725
I'm going to run over
and have a little talk with Ted.

1211
01:27:31,802 --> 01:27:34,930
You're not going to find him very talkative,
Eddie.

1212
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:37,667
Why, you wired me
that the operation was successful.

1213
01:27:37,742 --> 01:27:40,438
- The surgery was.
- Then what went wrong?

1214
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:44,213
- You, Eddie, you.
- Me?

1215
01:27:45,015 --> 01:27:47,415
You promised the boy you'd be here.

1216
01:27:47,485 --> 01:27:50,352
Well, I know, but I had to stay
at Marysport, Dave.

1217
01:27:50,421 --> 01:27:52,616
It meant so much to so many boys.

1218
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:55,022
It meant a lot to this boy, too.

1219
01:27:55,993 --> 01:27:59,190
Come on,
I'll walk down to the infirmary with you.

1220
01:28:01,532 --> 01:28:03,124
- Father.
- Sister.

1221
01:28:05,136 --> 01:28:06,899
Well, Ted, I'm back.

1222
01:28:09,573 --> 01:28:13,737
I had to help another boy, Ted.
As a matter of fact, a lot of boys.

1223
01:28:15,312 --> 01:28:16,904
Ted, look at me.

1224
01:28:18,582 --> 01:28:22,040
Don't you know that I wanted to be here
with you, Ted?

1225
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,385
Please try.

1226
01:28:24,989 --> 01:28:26,616
Please have faith, Ted.

1227
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:29,784
I promise you
that everything will be all right.

1228
01:28:30,861 --> 01:28:32,226
Please try.

1229
01:28:52,216 --> 01:28:55,379
That's the works, Eddie.
The court has shut down.

1230
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:56,978
Yes.

1231
01:28:59,723 --> 01:29:02,817
I tried to get the bank
to put me on the cuff...

1232
01:29:03,127 --> 01:29:05,561
but my cuff is too frayed, Eddie.

1233
01:29:05,963 --> 01:29:09,330
You did your best, Dave.
That's what I expect of you.

1234
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:14,001
That's what I expect of you, too, Eddie,
the best you can do.

1235
01:29:14,071 --> 01:29:16,301
But this time I didn't get it.

1236
01:29:16,507 --> 01:29:17,667
I see.

1237
01:29:18,175 --> 01:29:21,542
I warned you not to go dreaming
about 250 Boys Towns...

1238
01:29:21,612 --> 01:29:24,342
when you didn't have one all fixed yet.

1239
01:29:24,481 --> 01:29:27,177
I couldn't refuse a cry for help, Dave.

1240
01:29:27,852 --> 01:29:30,320
When you're trying to save someone
from drowning...

1241
01:29:30,387 --> 01:29:32,514
you've got to concentrate on him.

1242
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:34,683
If you help too many, you lose them all.

1243
01:29:34,758 --> 01:29:37,989
Maybe hopping about all over the ocean
proves what a great swimmer you are...

1244
01:29:38,062 --> 01:29:41,190
but it isn't helping the poor guy
that's going down for the third time.

1245
01:29:41,265 --> 01:29:42,630
You're right, Dave.

1246
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:47,000
What I wouldn't give to be wrong.
Just 10 years off my life, that's all.

1247
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:50,097
- I was thinking, Father...
- Yes, Pee Wee?

1248
01:29:51,108 --> 01:29:53,906
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Pee Wee, what is it?

1249
01:29:54,245 --> 01:29:56,270
I've been holding out on you.

1250
01:29:57,414 --> 01:29:59,712
Oh, well, we'll both overlook it.

1251
01:29:59,783 --> 01:30:02,115
I won $5 in the Soapies Contest.

1252
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:04,449
It was a consternation prize.

1253
01:30:04,889 --> 01:30:08,757
- A consolation prize.
- Yeah, a consternation prize.

1254
01:30:09,426 --> 01:30:13,021
I was going to buy you and Whitey
something for Christmas.

1255
01:30:13,097 --> 01:30:15,691
But Boys Town needs it more. Here.

1256
01:30:26,777 --> 01:30:28,802
The wormwood and the gall.

1257
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:36,244
- Wanna play a game?
- I don't play with children.

1258
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,249
Drift away, infant.

1259
01:30:39,089 --> 01:30:40,750
It's a good game.

1260
01:30:40,824 --> 01:30:45,022
I never felt my knuckles itch
like they do right now.

1261
01:30:46,563 --> 01:30:50,124
It's candy. You guess what pocket it's in
and you get to keep it.

1262
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,497
Oh, I do?

1263
01:30:52,236 --> 01:30:53,533
That one.

1264
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:59,136
And that one and that one and that one.

1265
01:31:01,645 --> 01:31:04,512
Talk about taking candy from a baby.

1266
01:31:05,082 --> 01:31:09,280
Where I come from, Curly Locks,
we play that game for eating tobacco.

1267
01:31:21,765 --> 01:31:23,733
- Mr. Morris.
- Yes, Whitey?

1268
01:31:24,535 --> 01:31:27,732
What's the matter with Father Flanagan?
He looks awfully worried.

1269
01:31:27,805 --> 01:31:31,832
- Well, he's been worried before.
- But not the way he is now.

1270
01:31:31,909 --> 01:31:34,605
I guess you and I are two people
he can't fool.

1271
01:31:34,678 --> 01:31:37,511
Since he came home,
he looks like he lost his best friend.

1272
01:31:37,581 --> 01:31:40,049
Whitey, I guess you're the only one
who's got a right to know.

1273
01:31:40,117 --> 01:31:42,176
He's come pretty close
to losing Boys Town.

1274
01:31:42,252 --> 01:31:44,277
But he can't lose Boys Town.
They can't do that to him.

1275
01:31:44,355 --> 01:31:46,186
He's never done anything wrong in his life.

1276
01:31:46,256 --> 01:31:48,281
Sometimes you can be wrong
without doing it.

1277
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:49,383
How?

1278
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,894
Like counting too much on other people...

1279
01:31:51,962 --> 01:31:54,760
thinking you can do too much by yourself.

1280
01:31:55,632 --> 01:31:58,829
- It's the money, isn't it?
- It's a big part of it.

1281
01:31:59,169 --> 01:32:02,730
Did my not staying with the Maitlands,
I mean, was he counting on them...

1282
01:32:02,806 --> 01:32:05,969
Well, the Maitlands
might have helped Boys Town...

1283
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:08,742
but then again, they might not.

1284
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,209
Thanks, Mr. Morris.

1285
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:14,041
Mr. Maitland, Father...

1286
01:32:14,118 --> 01:32:16,609
I wanna come back home
and live with you.

1287
01:32:16,687 --> 01:32:19,417
This is quite a change in your attitude.

1288
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:22,857
I know, but I've had a chance
to think it over since then.

1289
01:32:22,926 --> 01:32:24,860
And what have you thought?

1290
01:32:24,928 --> 01:32:27,158
About playing golf with you...

1291
01:32:27,564 --> 01:32:29,464
and tennis, and my car.

1292
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:31,434
<i>And your car?</i>

1293
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:33,970
And Mother, and all the kids at school.

1294
01:32:34,038 --> 01:32:37,235
If you'll only take me back,
I'll do anything you want me to.

1295
01:32:37,307 --> 01:32:39,673
I'll be around every minute. Honest, I will.

1296
01:32:39,743 --> 01:32:42,906
What's become of your devotion
to Father Flanagan?

1297
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:45,881
<i>Well, things aren't</i>
<i>quite the same here now.</i>

1298
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:50,376
I didn't realize how great it was with you.
What a fine chance I had.

1299
01:32:50,454 --> 01:32:52,581
If you'll only take me back.

1300
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:57,120
<i>You change your mind very rapidly,</i>
<i>Whitey. It's a quality I don't admire.</i>

1301
01:32:57,194 --> 01:33:00,493
I won't change it again, honest I won't.
On my word.

1302
01:33:00,864 --> 01:33:03,128
No, Whitey, you made your decision.

1303
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,930
I think it's best to let matters rest
just as they are.

1304
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:07,231
Good night.

1305
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:09,499
Mr. Maitland, don't go. Wait!

1306
01:33:11,942 --> 01:33:13,534
You're taking over Boys Town.

1307
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:16,636
Oh, well, now, you'll stay on in charge,
of course.

1308
01:33:16,713 --> 01:33:18,840
In charge of my own failure.

1309
01:33:22,886 --> 01:33:27,721
Eddie, in five years, maybe, 10, anyway...

1310
01:33:28,992 --> 01:33:31,324
we'll be free and clear of debt.

1311
01:33:32,196 --> 01:33:34,858
You'll have Boys Town back like it was.

1312
01:33:48,278 --> 01:33:52,408
- Somebody will have to tell the boys.
- I'll do that for you, Eddie.

1313
01:33:53,517 --> 01:33:55,280
No, Dave, thank you.

1314
01:33:56,854 --> 01:33:59,948
<i>- Yes, Father?</i>
- Have the bugler blow Assembly.

1315
01:34:00,190 --> 01:34:01,589
<i>Yes, Father.</i>

1316
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:08,061
If you don't think I've been hoping
for some miracle for you...

1317
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:12,635
Miracles only come
to those who deserve them.

1318
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:28,945
Boys...

1319
01:34:29,653 --> 01:34:31,120
this place...

1320
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:33,287
Boys Town...

1321
01:34:34,424 --> 01:34:36,153
was my first dream.

1322
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:39,191
It has been a dream come true.

1323
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:41,794
It has made many boys happy.

1324
01:34:41,865 --> 01:34:44,766
More than 4,000 boys
have gone through here.

1325
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:49,899
And gone out into the world
to become good citizens.

1326
01:34:51,275 --> 01:34:53,766
Not one of them has failed me.

1327
01:34:54,144 --> 01:34:55,475
Not one...

1328
01:34:56,246 --> 01:34:58,146
of all those thousands.

1329
01:34:58,882 --> 01:35:03,080
No one has ever failed Boys Town, ever.

1330
01:35:05,923 --> 01:35:07,254
Until now.

1331
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,191
And now...

1332
01:35:12,196 --> 01:35:13,993
the failure is here.

1333
01:35:15,098 --> 01:35:17,259
Someone has failed Boys Town.

1334
01:35:19,036 --> 01:35:20,503
Failed badly.

1335
01:35:21,338 --> 01:35:22,600
Horribly.

1336
01:35:27,644 --> 01:35:29,009
Bohunk!

1337
01:35:36,787 --> 01:35:37,981
Bohunk?

1338
01:35:49,933 --> 01:35:51,662
That big old skunk.

1339
01:35:52,536 --> 01:35:54,902
Why couldn't he look where he was going?

1340
01:35:54,972 --> 01:35:58,635
Well, he couldn't see him, Pee Wee,
it's around a curve.

1341
01:35:58,909 --> 01:36:00,934
I didn't even see the dog.

1342
01:36:01,078 --> 01:36:03,603
He must've run under my rear wheels.

1343
01:36:03,814 --> 01:36:06,339
- I'm sorry for it.
- That's all right.

1344
01:36:10,287 --> 01:36:12,619
I didn't go up to take him out.

1345
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:16,616
That's why it happened. I forgot.

1346
01:36:18,428 --> 01:36:21,795
He got out without his leash.

1347
01:36:25,002 --> 01:36:27,732
Pee Wee, a dog has to run free sometimes.

1348
01:36:28,338 --> 01:36:31,330
You can't keep anyone on a leash
all the time.

1349
01:36:34,911 --> 01:36:37,004
Whitey, you and the boys...

1350
01:36:37,614 --> 01:36:41,141
go over and dig a grave for Bohunk,
over there by the statue.

1351
01:36:41,218 --> 01:36:42,617
Yes, Father.

1352
01:36:43,553 --> 01:36:45,282
And you help Whitey.

1353
01:37:10,347 --> 01:37:11,871
Where's Bohunk?

1354
01:37:13,784 --> 01:37:17,515
Ted, you've stood so much pain,
do you think you could stand a lot more?

1355
01:37:17,587 --> 01:37:20,454
Why doesn't somebody else
have to stand it?

1356
01:37:21,191 --> 01:37:24,092
Everybody does have to go through pain,
Ted.

1357
01:37:25,028 --> 01:37:27,963
Some seem to have more to endure
than others.

1358
01:37:28,098 --> 01:37:29,998
And you're one of them.

1359
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:31,562
And I...

1360
01:37:31,802 --> 01:37:36,102
I can't tell you why, either,
unless it's that suffering seems to...

1361
01:37:37,007 --> 01:37:39,805
forge such a fine man, that in the end...

1362
01:37:40,977 --> 01:37:43,275
you'll be better than the rest of us.

1363
01:37:43,347 --> 01:37:44,939
No more doctors?

1364
01:37:48,118 --> 01:37:51,485
Ted, I'm going to let you have it
square on the chin.

1365
01:37:51,555 --> 01:37:53,682
But I think you can take it.

1366
01:37:58,695 --> 01:38:00,993
Bohunk was run over by a truck.

1367
01:38:01,098 --> 01:38:04,499
The boys are burying him.
I thought you'd like to go.

1368
01:38:04,668 --> 01:38:07,102
Bohunk, dead?

1369
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:55,383
Put me down.

1370
01:39:52,542 --> 01:39:55,306
We're all saying goodbye to you, Bohunk.

1371
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,581
You're the only one
who could make a fellow smile...

1372
01:39:59,649 --> 01:40:02,243
that had been kicked around too much.

1373
01:40:02,586 --> 01:40:05,714
You did your job, and you did it well.

1374
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:10,824
We all loved you, and we always will.

1375
01:41:01,444 --> 01:41:03,776
That's enough for now, huh, Ted?

1376
01:41:04,748 --> 01:41:05,874
Yeah.

1377
01:41:06,416 --> 01:41:10,284
Take me back now, Father.
I'll try some more tomorrow.

1378
01:41:27,671 --> 01:41:29,263
Sit down, Eddie.

1379
01:41:31,575 --> 01:41:34,408
Father, did you know that
Whitey wanted to come back with us?

1380
01:41:34,477 --> 01:41:37,310
No, he didn't say anything to me about it.

1381
01:41:37,847 --> 01:41:40,543
- I forgot.
- You're not usually forgetful.

1382
01:41:40,617 --> 01:41:43,017
Well, he spoke to me over the radio.

1383
01:41:43,086 --> 01:41:47,489
He told me the worst, most bare-faced
collection of lies I've ever heard in my life.

1384
01:41:47,557 --> 01:41:48,649
Lies?

1385
01:41:49,659 --> 01:41:51,718
What's come over you, Whitey?

1386
01:41:51,795 --> 01:41:54,286
I guess, I'm just naturally bad, Father.

1387
01:41:54,364 --> 01:41:55,854
That's not fair.

1388
01:41:55,932 --> 01:42:00,096
Whitey was really offering himself to us
as a hostage for Boys Town.

1389
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:02,434
Yes, when I had a chance to think it over...

1390
01:42:02,505 --> 01:42:06,134
I realized that
Whitey was selling himself down the river.

1391
01:42:06,943 --> 01:42:09,036
- Whitey.
- Yes, Father?

1392
01:42:11,881 --> 01:42:15,248
- Did you want to do this for me?
- No, not particularly. I guess...

1393
01:42:15,318 --> 01:42:17,684
He did it because he knew
you were in trouble.

1394
01:42:17,754 --> 01:42:20,154
Trouble? That's a mild word for it.

1395
01:42:20,457 --> 01:42:22,857
As Dave says, we're out of business.

1396
01:42:22,926 --> 01:42:24,393
No, you are not.

1397
01:42:24,461 --> 01:42:27,294
Any place that can inspire loyalty
like Whitey's...

1398
01:42:27,364 --> 01:42:29,059
faith like Ted's...

1399
01:42:29,132 --> 01:42:32,431
a friendship as fine as Dave's,
mustn't go out of business.

1400
01:42:32,502 --> 01:42:35,699
I know that Dave has gone
half as deep as Boys Town...

1401
01:42:35,772 --> 01:42:40,368
but we'll put our heads together and find
some way to pull both of them out.

1402
01:42:41,144 --> 01:42:42,475
Thank you.

1403
01:42:44,681 --> 01:42:47,775
Today another class has graduated.

1404
01:42:49,953 --> 01:42:52,513
Another group is leaving Boys Town...

1405
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:55,255
and going into manhood.

1406
01:42:55,759 --> 01:42:58,728
It is not an easy world
they're going out to.

1407
01:42:59,696 --> 01:43:04,099
The coddled, the weak, the doubting
will fall.

1408
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:07,226
But the men will survive.

1409
01:43:08,304 --> 01:43:11,205
And great will be the honor they shall win.

1410
01:43:14,678 --> 01:43:16,976
You graduates must be such men.

1411
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,107
Men of Boys Town.

1412
01:43:19,549 --> 01:43:23,246
You must realize
that the inheritance of your generation...

1413
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:25,549
is toil and sweat and sorrow.

1414
01:43:26,623 --> 01:43:28,614
But you must also know...

1415
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:33,054
that out of the bitterest battle,
the sweetest victory is won.

1416
01:43:33,797 --> 01:43:37,494
I envy you the glory
of solving the problems you will meet...

1417
01:43:37,567 --> 01:43:39,865
for the tasks of youth today...

1418
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:42,267
are tasks for giants.

1419
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:45,838
But the time that awaits you...

1420
01:43:46,643 --> 01:43:48,167
is the time...

1421
01:43:48,878 --> 01:43:51,506
when giants will walk again in the land.

1422
01:43:53,149 --> 01:43:54,616
Be staunch...

1423
01:43:55,385 --> 01:43:57,012
keep the faith...

1424
01:43:59,355 --> 01:44:00,686
and you...

1425
01:44:02,459 --> 01:44:04,552
will walk among the giants.

1426
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:09,020
God bless you.
