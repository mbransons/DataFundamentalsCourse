1
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:10,344


2
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:12,431


3
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:19,583


4
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,180
It's beautiful here.

5
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,008
It was our aunt's.

6
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:40,196
We used to come here
as kids.

7
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,391
The Order uses it now
as a safe house.

8
00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:46,914
What's left of us, at least.

9
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,453
Muggles think these keep
evil away,

10
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:53,399
but they're wrong.

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,547
I need to talk
to the goblin.

12
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:10,961
How are you?

13
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,321
Alive.

14
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:20,995
You probably don't remember...

15
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,236
That I showed you
to your vault

16
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:23,992
the first time
you came to Gringotts?

17
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:27,867
Even amongst goblins
you're famous, Harry Potter.

18
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:33,336
You buried the elf.

19
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,969
Yes.

20
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:36,875
<font color="#00ff00">GRIPHOOK:</font> And brought me
here.

21
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:40,344
You are...

22
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,711
..a very unusual wizard.

23
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,397
How did you come
by this sword?

24
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:00,600
It's complicated.

25
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,264
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange
think

26
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:06,201
it should be in her
vault at Gringotts?

27
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:09,358
It's complicated.

28
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,803
The sword presented itself
to us

29
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,350
in a moment of need.

30
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:18,295
We didn't steal it.

31
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,449
There is a sword
in Madam Lestrange's vault

32
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:24,784
identical to this one...

33
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:26,334
..but it is a fake.

34
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:28,551
It was placed there
this past summer.

35
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,272
And she never suspected
it was a fake?

36
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,851
The replica is
very convincing.

37
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:33,537
Only a goblin would
recognize that

38
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,694
this is the true sword
of Gryffindor.

39
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,475
Who is the acquaintance?

40
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,708
A Hogwarts professor.

41
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:42,576
As I understand it,
he's now headmaster.

42
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,475
Snape?

43
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,873
He put a fake sword
in Bellatrix's vault?

44
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:49,756
Why?

45
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:51,178
There are more than
a few

46
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:54,100
curious things in the vaults
at Gringotts.

47
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:58,155
And in Madam Lestrange's vault
as well?

48
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:02,365
Perhaps.

49
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:06,487
I need to get into Gringotts.

50
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,381
Into one of the vaults.

51
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:10,028
This is impossible.

52
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:11,508
Alone, yes.

53
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,670
But with you,
no.

54
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,588
<font color="#00ff00">GRIPHOOK:</font> Why should I
help you?

55
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,490
I have gold.
Lots of it.

56
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:26,467
- I have no interest in gold.
- <font color="#00ff00">HARRY: </font>Then what?

57
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,037
That.

58
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:35,655
That is my price.

59
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,865
<font color="#00ff00">HERMIONE: </font>Are you thinking
there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

60
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:54,426
<font color="#00ff00">HARRY: </font>She was terrified
when she thought we'd been in there.

61
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:56,459
She kept asking you
what else we'd taken.

62
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,442
I bet you there's a Horcrux
in there,

63
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,753
another piece of his soul.

64
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,881
Let's find it and kill it,
we're one step closer to killing him.

65
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,545
<font color="#00ff00">RON: </font>And what happens
when we find it?

66
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,085
How are we supposed
to destroy it now,

67
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,772
you've given the
sword to Griphook?

68
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:10,564
<font color="#00ff00">HARRY: </font>I'm still working
on that part.

69
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,045
He's weak.

70
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,075
Yes?

71
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:30,911
Mr. Ollivander,
I need to ask you a few questions.

72
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:33,364
<font color="#00ff00">OLLIVANDER: </font>Anything, my boy,
anything.

73
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,153
<font color="#00ff00">HARRY: </font>Would you mind
identifying this wand?

74
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,802
We need to know
if it's safe to use.

75
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:47,575
Walnut.

76
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:50,778
Dragon heartstring.

77
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,232
Twelve and three-quarter inches.

78
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,427
Unyie...

79
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:01,107
..Unyielding.

80
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:06,614
This belonged
to Bellatrix Lestrange.

81
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:09,068
Treat it carefully.

82
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:11,686
And this?

83
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,419
Hawthorn.

84
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,372
And unicorn hair.

85
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:25,318
Ten inches.
Reasonably pliant.

86
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:33,333
This... was the wand
of Draco Malfoy.

87
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:37,044
Was?
Is it not still?

88
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,739
Well, perhaps not,
if you won it from him.

89
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:46,591
I sense its allegiance has
changed.

90
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:56,380
You talk about wands
as if they have feelings...

91
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,169
..can think.

92
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:07,411
The wand chooses the wizard,
Mr. Potter.

93
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,724
That much has always
been clear to

94
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:13,450
those of us
who have studied wandlore.

95
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:18,193
And... what do you know
about the Deathly Hallows?

96
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:25,755
It is rumored
there are three:

97
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:30,607
The Elder Wand...

98
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:33,251
..the Cloak of Invisibility

99
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:36,048
to hide you
from your enemies...

100
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:41,837
..and the Resurrection Stone
to bring back loved ones from the dead.

101
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:46,915
Together,
they make one the master of death.

102
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:53,634
But few... truly believe
that such objects exist.

103
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,064
<font color="#00ff00">HARRY: </font>Do you?

104
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:57,845
Do you believe they exist,
sir?

105
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:03,946
I see no reason
to...

106
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:07,509
..put stock into
an old wives' tale.

107
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:09,950
You're lying.

108
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,970
You know one exists.

109
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:15,204
You told him
about it.

110
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,150
You told him about
the Elder Wand

111
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,157
and... where he could go
looking for it.

112
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,384
He tortured me.

113
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,986
Besides...

114
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,345
..I only conveyed rumors.

115
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:38,153
There's...

116
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:42,470
..there's no telling
whether he will find it.

117
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:47,392
He has found it,
sir.

118
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:54,736
We'll let you rest.

119
00:09:57,637 --> 00:10:00,118
<font color="#00ff00">OLLIVANDER: </font>He's after you,
Mr. Potter.

120

If it's true,
what you say,

121
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,947
and he has
the Elder Wand...

122
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:09,962
..I'm afraid...

123
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,329
..you really don't stand
a chance.

124
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:16,065
Well, I suppose
I'll have to kill him

125
00:10:16,152 --> 00:10:17,407
before he finds me,
then.

126
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,126
<font color="#00ff00">RON: </font>Are you sure that's hers?

127
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:28,642
Positive.

00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,259
Well?

129
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:39,157
How do I look?

130
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:41,353
<font color="#00ff00">RON: </font>Hideous.

131
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:45,611
You can give that to Hermione to hold,
all right, Griphook?

132
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:06,810
We're relying on you.

133
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,867
If you get us past the guards
and into the vault,

134
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:10,367
the sword's yours.

00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:41,469
we might as well use that sword
to slit our own throats.

Understand?

143
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,648
No, he's right.

Identification?

I hardly think
that'll be necessary.

Madam Lestrange.

152

Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?

And why should I do that?

160

It's the bank's policy.

I'm sure you understand

Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding themselves.

312
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:23,363
We need to get into Hogwarts,
tonight.

313
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,464
Dumbledore gave us
a job to do.

314
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:27,066
Did he now?

315
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:29,910
Nice job?
Easy?

316
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:32,535
We've been hunting
Horcruxes.

317
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:35,290
We think the last one's
inside the castle,

318
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:36,775
but we'll need help
getting in.

319
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:38,792
That's not a job
my brother's given you.

320
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,597
It's a suicide mission.

321
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:42,988
Do yourself a favor, boy,
go home.

322
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,251
Live a little longer.

323
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:46,121
Dumbledore trusted me
to see this through.

324
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:48,308
What makes you think
you can trust him?

325
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:52,033
You think you can believe anything
my brother told you?

326
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:55,730
In all the time you knew him,
did he ever mention my name?

327
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,566
Did he ever mention hers?

328
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:02,652
- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.

329
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:06,667
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

330
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,707
A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes
on the word of a man...

331
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,626
..who wouldn't even tell him
where to start. You're lying!

332
00:29:14,192 --> 00:29:17,992
Not just to me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

333
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:20,071
That's what a fool does.

334
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:24,251
You don't strike me as a fool,
Harry Potter.

335
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:28,517
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.

336
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,446
I'm not interested in
what happened

337
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:33,720
between you
and your brother.

338
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:36,978
I don't care
that you've given up.

339
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,688
I trusted the man
I knew.

340
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,649
And we need to get into
the castle tonight.

341
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,688

That's your sister, Ariana,

She died very young,
didn't she?

346
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:26,307
My brother sacrificed many things,
Mr. Potter...

347
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,630
..on his journey
to find power...

348
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:30,598
..including Ariana.

349
00:30:31,812 --> 00:30:33,927
And she was devoted to him.

350
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:36,997
He gave her everything...

351
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:40,036

We?

I'm just saying,
that's the Elder Wand,

the most powerful

Dad,
what if I am put in Slytherin?

1079
01:56:26,453 --> 01:56:29,048
Albus Severus Potter...

1080
01:56:30,298 --> 01:56:33,290
..you were named after two
headmasters of Hogwarts.

1081
01:56:33,989 --> 01:56:35,616
One of them was Slytherin...

1082
01:56:35,727 --> 01:56:38,861
..and he was
the bravest man I've ever known.

1083
01:56:41,059 --> 01:56:42,484
But just say that I am.

if it really means that much to you,
you can choose Gryffindor.

The Sorting Hat takes
