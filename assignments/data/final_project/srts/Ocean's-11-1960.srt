1
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,112
Christmas in Beverly Hills, California.

2
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,189
A time when everyone thinks
only kind, tolerant, generous thoughts.

3
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:41,347
- I went looking for you.
- What, what, what? What is it Mushy?

4
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:44,168
- I went to the house looking for you.
- Why? What happened?

5
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,890
Nothing happen, I thought
maybe you needed me for something.

6
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,228
Heart attacks, that's
what I need all of you for.

7
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:55,822
Phoenix, Arizona calling Mr. Acebos.

8
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,223
Hello? Yes, yes operator, speaking.

9
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:06,729
Mr. Ocean doesn't answer?
Still doesn't answer and Mr. Foster?

10
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:13,638
Of course, keep calling.
They got to come in sometime.

11
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,717
- Hello? Jimmy, are you in yet?
- You don't even expect me.

12
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:31,489
Sorry operator, Mr. Foster is out.
Yeah, so is Mr. Ocean.

13
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:37,458
I made a cardinal rule not to answer the
telephone during the month of December.

14
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,411
That's crazy, why?

15
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:44,813
Because one December, only
time I picked up the phone they...

16
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:48,068
sent me out in the snow
to play with my little friends.

17
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:51,942
That was at the Bulge.

18
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,399
Clowns they got to be.

19
00:04:55,321 --> 00:05:00,226
I like clowns but they should be funny.
It's a clown's business being funny.

20
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,631
And I ask you...

21
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,716
what is funny about going
to the pokey for 10 years?

22
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:09,111
To me in all sincerity, nothing.

23
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:13,196
Greed, yet that's exactly
where we'll be unless every...

24
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:15,757
bit of time is checked and checked.

25
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,379
One more question, inform me frankly.

26
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,764
What have I done to earn contempt?

27
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:28,038
Why should I be treated
like I'm stupid and there are smart?

28
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,786
That's right, was
your scheme in the first place.

29
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:34,166
So was the Hialeah racetrack job,

30
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:38,290
Hegel's supermarket and the
hit switch on Nelson's Armors cars.

31
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:40,596
All my inspirations.

32
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:44,049
There isn't a man in
the country with my reputation.

33
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:48,140
So, why don't those fellows respect me?

34
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:51,041
Maybe because you
don't do nothing, just get ideas.

35
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:56,917
I just get ideas.

36
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:04,694
If you're not careful
Buddybosch, she'll rub you out.

37
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:07,332
Acebos, he's insistent.

38
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,429
This is a recording,
you dialed the right number.

39
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,290
Now please hang up and don't do it again.

40
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,076
- Where were we?
- Right here.

41
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:18,027
That man is going to flip.

42
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:21,264
Well, he sell us into
the deal, let him sweat.

43
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:26,244
He didn't silver tongue you
for long, 30 seconds if he take a few.

44
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:30,637
You couldn't expect me to turn down a nice
conservative business opportunity like this.

45
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:35,715
- Especially where is no risk factor.
- I wouldn't have anything another way.

46
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:41,015
- And it's time we looked up Vince Massler.
- I saw him, he doesn't want in.

47
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:46,435
- Why not?
- Beats the hell out of me, sergeant.

48
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,227
I took him by the ears and dragged
him from Solano to Siegfried line.

49
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:55,110
And I may have to do it again.
Maybe this time he'll come gently.

50
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:00,437
Alright girls, time for your nap, beat it.

51
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,590
- Hey.
- See you later.

52
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:10,924
- Get up, lover boy, get up, get up.
- You're a spoilsport.

53
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:15,482
San Harmon is coming in the 3 o'clock,
shouldn't I go down to the airport?

54
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,166
I sent Steffans to the airport.

55
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,696
Everything to the last minute.

56
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:29,147
This Harmon should've
been in the scam weeks ago.

57
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,949
The whole crew should.

58
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,629
What about this Sam Harmon?

59
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:38,794
Why all the way from
Hawaii, he was so special?

60
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,756
And who says he can be trusted?

61
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:45,780
Sam Harmon is Ocean's closest friend.

62
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:48,276
- Another closest friend?
- Yeah.

63
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:51,419
- What about Foster?
- Before Foster, from way back.

64
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:55,420
We were all in the commandos
together and Ocean save Harmon's life.

65
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:00,426
Hey Sam, Sam Harmon.

66
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,567
Alright, that takes care
of me. Now, let's get to you.

67
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:08,728
George Steffans. Curly, Curly Steffans.

68
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:11,488
Curly, of course, I'd know you anywhere.

69
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:14,108
You haven't changed
either, you look great kid.

70
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:18,898
Hey listen, is Danny really going to go
through with this commando raid?

71
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:22,952
- Just like the old days.
- Who is this Acebos guy? What is he?

72
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,960
Planning division, he
dreamed it up. Not the tactics though,

73
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,361
Jimmy and Danny workout the coordination job.

74
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,010
What is he, a con?

75
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:33,070
- Leavenworth.
- Where Danny meet him?

76
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:36,221
Who knows?
A racetrack, a nightclub, Disneyland.

77
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:39,593
- Same old Danny.
- Yeah, he likes action.

78
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:42,924
- Still married?
- Yeah, but he's not working at it.

79
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:48,419
That figures. Soldier, fatigue detail.
Put this footlocker in my car,

80
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:49,807
Hold it.

81
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:10,900
What can I do for you?

82
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,870
- I would like to see the proprietor.
- You're looking at him.

83
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:18,419
- Well, doesn't Tony Bergdorf own this shop?
- Not anymore.

84
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,820
Can you tell where can
I find him? I'm a friend of his.

85
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:24,712
That's him, that's me.

86
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,554
I'm afraid what I'm
going have to tell you isn't a...

87
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:32,777
very nice thing to hear, he's in prison.

88
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:35,721
- Shorty Bergdorf?
- San Quentin.

89
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:40,456
- Won't you tell me were can I find his wife?
- I have her address here some place.

90
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:43,313
If you excuse me,
I'll get it for you in a minute.

91
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,541
May I use your phone
for a long distance call?

92
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:48,330
- Long distance?
- I'll have it reverse.

93
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,056
- Alright.
- Thank you.

94
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,278
- Hello.
- Collect call.

95
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:04,288
- Yes operator, I'll take the call.
- Go ahead please.

96
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:07,201
- Hello Corneal, it's me Mushy.
- Forget, it's not Phoenix.

97
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:09,788
This is Acebos, go ahead Corneil.

98
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:13,374
Tony Bergdorf is in
San Quentin, doing from one to five.

99
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:23,391
He's in prison, the electrician.

100
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:28,502
Our master electrician is doing one to five.

101
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,962
Make it a little short, will you please.

102
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,744
Here we are Miss Allenby.

103
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:38,957
Oh, thank you so much Mrs.
Bergdorf, Mr. Allenby will be so pleased.

104
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:42,461
- They're our very own children, you know.
- Oh, I know.

105
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:44,420
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, thank you so much.

106
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,741
- Mommy is so pleased to have you home.
- Gracie...

107
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:51,327
Roger Corneal...

108
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:55,199
- Oh, where the world did you come from?
- Been a long time, how are you?

109
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:58,797
It's been a lifetime.
Was our first anniversary, wasn't it?

110
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:01,894
You remember those
rum drinks that betrayed us?

111
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:03,755
I haven't had rum since.

112
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:06,977
Oh, those were the old and
golden days, weren't they?

113
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,059
- You know about Tony?
- Yes, it's a shame.

114
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,671
He's getting out tomorrow morning.

115
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,799
Tomorrow? I thought
they gave him one to five.

116
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:18,758
Yeah, they did but they gave
him an amnesty, I don't know why.

117
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:21,503
- Oh, that Danny, always a step ahead.
- Pardon?

118
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:23,058
Oh, I'm just mumbling.

119
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:26,972
Will you have Tony call me when
he gets home? Tell him to call me at...

120
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:29,584
He won't be coming home, that's all finished.

121
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:32,836
Oh, I didn't know that.
Well, won't he see the kid?

122
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:36,536
Oh yes sure see Timmy, but he'll see
him in the Peninsular military school.

123
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,194
In the presence of Major Taylor.

124
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:41,247
- Can I use your phone Gracie?
- Sure.

125
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:45,711
Oh look Rog, I just
can't ignore the possibility of...

126
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:48,273
of him being a bad influence on little Timmy.

127
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,180
This time it must be Ocean.

128
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:11,545
- Hello.
- Mr. Corneal call...

129
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:12,913
- Who?
- Mr. Corneal.

130
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,575
- Corneal again.
- Will you accept the call?

131
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,336
- Will you accept the call?
- Yes, I'll accept the call.

132
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:24,654
That man sure likes telephones.

133
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:26,994
Come on in boys, I'll be right with you.

134
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:30,486
Hey Sam, get them up, get them up.

135
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:35,882
You look great. Is that what
a diet of wahines does for a guy?

136
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:38,689
- You get them up now.
- Come on, shoot one in there.

137
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:41,257
Fellows, I can't hear.

138
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:43,729
Hey Mushi, you look
almost human, you quit fighting?

139
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,855
Yes Sam, I'm running out of scar tissue.

140
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:49,265
Yeah, hold it a minute, Corneal.

141
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:51,859
Avail yourself of my hospitality Mr. Harmon.

142
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:53,417
Scotch.

143
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,893
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow morning.

144
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:58,903
Tomorrow morning?
Yeah, wait, wait. Yes, proceed, proceed.

145
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:00,811
- Just listen.
- Sure, I'm listening.

146
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,223
And I'm a very happy man.

147
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,322
No, no, I said I'm a, never mind,
never mind, go on. Thanks, Corneal.

148
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:12,388
It's excellent what you did,
yes, excellent, yes. Goodbye,

149
00:13:13,388 --> 00:13:15,477
Another crisis lived through.

150
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,766
They're letting Bergdorf
out, giving him an amnesty.

151
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:23,359
Some joke.

152
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,451
I bet Ocean knew it all
the time but he wouldn't tell me.

153
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:32,186
No, no, he wouldn't. He's got to torture me.

154
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:35,877
Eat my heart out, he likes it of you, tutti.

155
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:38,365
You're not make yourself
popular knocking Danny.

156
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:44,266
Who's knocking him?
I love him, I respect talent.

157
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:47,465
All I'm asking is he should love me a little.

158
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,563
Too tough, don't ask.

159
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:32,607
How about that, fellows?
A little hand for Lolita.

160
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:39,063
And now a sweet bundle from
Texas, sweet as chocolate candy.

161
00:14:39,352 --> 00:14:42,590
The tantalizing, Honeyface.

162
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:08,246
Sorry about the interruption
boys, I got a job to do.

163
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,793
What's the word Vince,
we got to catch a plane?

164
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,814
Danny, I never figured you'd go this route.

165
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:15,853
Vince, the plan is
foolproof take my word for it.

166
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,990
You know I lie to girls.

167
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:20,928
But Tim, if is so fool proof why
hasn't somebody done it yet?

168
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,785
Same reason nobody is gone
to the moon yet, no equipment.

169
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:28,315
And we're equipped, it's going to be a
military operation executed by trained men.

170
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:31,770
Why waste all those cute little
tricks that the army taught us...

171
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,635
just because its sort of peaceful now?

172
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,636
You remember a little bit
called Operation Gold in Oran?

173
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,602
Do I? Eleven of us on
a beach with a rubber boat...

174
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:45,488
and six million in gold bars.

175
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:50,835
- We should've buried them.
- No shovels but we got shovels this time.

176
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:52,546
What do you say Vince?

177
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,357
I can't do it boys,
I got my wife to think of.

178
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:58,412
- Think of her rich.
- Think of me dead.

179
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,504
Stop talking like a kid.

180
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:03,198
You went through the
whole war without getting dead.

181
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,276
Why suddenly should
you get dead in peacetime?

182
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:07,138
Vince, you're indestructible.

183
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:10,336
I'm sorry folks, I'd go along
with you in a minute, but my wife...

184
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:14,643
- When she come on?
- She's on.

185
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,362
Is that her?

186
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:29,243
- Yeah, why? What are you thinking?
- She's a very lovely girl.

187
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:34,455
Honeyface, I'd like to grab you, take you
home and spread you on my waffle.

188
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,352
Its only two of them.

189
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:52,179
First he comes around begging for a
job, now he's duping pay customers.

190
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,162
- Let's get the bum out.
- Ok Al.

191
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:56,235
- Now?
- Now is the time.

192
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,791
- What's matter with you boys?
- Hold it pal.

193
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,028
Hey, what's the big idea?

194
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,724
- Oh, stop it.
- Go that way.

195
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,823
- Come on boys.
- Voila.

196
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:40,052
I didn't figure to come across a
pierce set brawl like this so far in land.

197
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,252
You still want me Danny, I'm in.

198
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:46,928
Alright, you're in. Could be a little itchy.

199
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:50,901
I don't care, I'm tired of having
those bums yelling at my wife.

200
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,923
I don't want her have to
take it one more lousy night.

201
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,726
Neither do I, Vince.

202
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,905
Now, take that.

203
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,757
- Oh, shucks Danny.
- How cut out the gun's smoke dialog?

204
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:05,739
This a plane ticket.
Now, when you get up there...

205
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:08,901
Go to this address, ask for Josh
Howard, he'll tell you what to do.

206
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,255
- Josh Howard is in with you?
- Yeah.

207
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:13,850
- I feel better already.
- Good.

208
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:18,585
Heard anything about Louis
Jackson? Where he might be?

209
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,944
- Salt Lake City last I heard.
- We heard that too.

210
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:27,672
- Ok, we'll see you in a couple of days.
- What I may tell my wife?

211
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:33,409
- Tell you love her.
- That will hold her for a couple of weeks.

212
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:46,894
It's fun time Jimmy boy. I'll give
him a party, you make the drinks.

213
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:54,877
Hello, Jimmy Foster here are you there?

214
00:18:55,368 --> 00:19:00,396
How can you do this to me?
You, I relied on, I had confidence in you.

215
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:03,065
From the other one I knew what to expect.

216
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:07,480
He's hopeless, hopeless, undisciplined.
That's why I sent you with him.

217
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:10,059
Hello Spyros, how are you?

218
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:14,046
Get away from that phone.
I won't talk to you. I won't...

219
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:17,930
I won't, all you know is to give
me heartache, better get shot.

220
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:21,408
Spyros, I got good news and bad.

221
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:26,133
Don't tell me the bad, bad news I got
plenty, all I want. Just tell me the good.

222
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:28,662
We're leaving Phoenix.

223
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,936
They're leaving Phoenix.
Danny darling, that's wonderful.

224
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:38,774
Oh, why didn't you tell me the first place?
Alright, now tell me what's the bad news.

225
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,827
We're going to Salt Lake City.

226
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,320
They're going to Salt Lake City.

227
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:58,086
Well, say hello to your father Timmy.

228
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:09,638
- Hi.
- Hello sir.

229
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:16,001
Don't I get a kiss or are
you grown too old for that?

230
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,629
Sorry sir.

231
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,938
Your clothes smell funny.

232
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:31,966
- I came from a faraway place.
- I know sir, Japan.

233
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:33,739
That's right, Japan.

234
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,614
I didn't stop to change
because I was afraid I'd miss you.

235
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:42,477
- Miss me sir?
- Yeah, don't you go home on weekends?

236
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:46,410
I do sir, but mother said you'd come
to see me and then I had to stay.

237
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:49,246
Oh, I'm sorry if I spoiled your
weekend with your mother.

238
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,819
But maybe you and I
can do something together.

239
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,103
Maybe we can go to a movie
and have some ice cream, eh?

240
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,867
How would you like to go to a football game?

241
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:03,261
- Oh, I would like that sir.
- Good, I'll call for you next Saturday.

242
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:05,824
- Yes sir.
- Right?

243
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:10,844
Dad.

244
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:15,963
- You won't forget Dad?
- No, no Timmy, I won't forget.

245
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:19,901
Merry Christmas Dad, I made it myself.

246
00:21:20,206 --> 00:21:21,246
Well.

247
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:36,645
- Wait a minute, Corneal, Roger Corneal.
- That's me.

248
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:41,077
First man in the 82nd to be fined
for fraternizing with the Fraulein.

249
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:43,788
And the first man to greet
me in graduation day, how come?

250
00:21:43,818 --> 00:21:47,606
I saw Grace, your kid glad to see you?

251
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:50,211
- Yeah, look what he made me.
- What's that? Beads?

252
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,830
No, it's Japanese abacus,
you can add and subtract on it.

253
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,856
- Oh, that is clever.
- Yeah.

254
00:21:56,046 --> 00:22:01,193
Grace told him I was in Japan, she
couldn't tell the kid where I really was.

255
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,957
- No, I guess not.
- How things with you?

256
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,819
We need a master electrician.

257
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,121
- Who's we?
- Our old outfit.

258
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:13,004
- You mean Jimmy Foster and...
- Danny Ocean, Sam, Josh, all of them.

259
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:15,377
How they all got together? What's up?

260
00:22:15,577 --> 00:22:18,109
It's a reunion.

261
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:21,380
We have been getting things ready for weeks.

262
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:26,129
- Sounds like a whale of a party.
- Bigger than Anzio or Raimac.

263
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:29,179
Only this time you won't
get paid in invasion money.

264
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:34,314
- It'll be the real long green, stacks of it.
- Oh, hold it.

265
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:38,201
Sounds like the kind of reunion that
can put me back in the Calendar Hall.

266
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,855
Tony. Tony.

267
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:44,977
Hup, two, three, four.

268
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:46,428
Tony?

269
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:50,030
You don't get rich if
you don't take a chance.

270
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:55,193
Look Rog, the last joker who fed me
that line was a wholesale jeweler.

271
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:58,625
He wanted me to short circuit his
burglar alarm so he can rob his own store.

272
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:03,782
It worked out fine, he got sixty grand, I
got one to five and I lost my wife and kid.

273
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:07,697
And the funny part of it
I thought I was doing it for her.

274
00:23:08,627 --> 00:23:11,009
She always wanted a white fox stole.

275
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:15,321
This time it'll take you one
to five just to count your loot.

276
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:19,303
No, sorry Rog, I got
things to do in the outside.

277
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:20,988
And I'm going to stay there.

278
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:24,447
Besides, if I went in on it, you'd
be licked before you started.

279
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,255
I'm hard luck, I used
to be unlucky only for myself.

280
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,785
Now I'm unlucky
for everybody, see you around.

281
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:36,868
Didn't you get medical
attention on the penitentiary?

282
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:40,368
- Yes sir.
- Then what made you come to me?

283
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:44,049
When I was leaving Dr. Griffin said
I ought to see a specialist right away.

284
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,581
He made the appointment for me.

285
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:56,675
Look doc, give it to me straight.

286
00:23:58,369 --> 00:23:59,768
Is it the big casino?-

287
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:03,303
I can't tell until
I've seen the biopsy report.

288
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,816
What if the report says it is? How long?

289
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,101
Well, I...

290
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:11,757
How long doc?

291
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:34,066
What do you say Tony?
You can still change your mind.

292
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,441
Will my cut be big enough
to send the kid through college?

293
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,836
Big enough to buy your kid a college.

294
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:10,001
- Come on Josh, your turn.
- Alright.

Vince, Vincerinio, how are you?

308
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:12,884
You're a tough guy to catch up with Josh.

309
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:15,954
Trash is where you find
him, you got to fallow this lead.

310
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:18,385
What happened to ball-playing? No hit?

311
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:20,540
No see remember.

312
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:24,154
You know, when I got out of the Army the
only club that was open was down South...

313
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,870
no spot in the outfield spot.

314
00:27:27,383 --> 00:27:31,690
Could you imagine how I would've made
out, a one-eyed third baseman in Mobile?

315
00:27:32,472 --> 00:27:35,281
I always leveled with you, didn't I Josh?

316
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,702
Well, I'm stringing along
with this operation but I'm scared.

317
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:43,786
And it's no panic, just is this little
something gets me up in here.

318
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:47,421
That's the only way to be, makes you careful.

319
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:52,628
Look Vince, the brave ones
don't come home, you stay scared.

320
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:56,669
Yeah, you were always guys didn't want any
brave ones on patrol with you, weren't you?

321
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,487
That's simple enough, in my book,
bravery rhymes with stupid and still does.

322
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:08,279
Yeah, you were some yellow belly, imagine
the damn fool Army giving you the DSM.

323
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:10,983
I know, don't think I
wasn't scared the day I won that.

324
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:13,437
And do me a favor, will you? No even
mention it know because my knees...

325
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:14,672
start to shake all over again.

326
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:18,654
How come this operation
of Danny's isn't make you shake?

327
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:20,041
It does.

328
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:25,366
A million bucks apiece, I guess
you figure the odds are right?

329
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,703
Vince, baby boy,
the way I figure it is like this...

330
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:33,197
The 11 of us cats
against this one little city.

331
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,535
We're an overlay.

332
00:28:36,227 --> 00:28:40,543
- Ok little pal, I'm ready for the briefing.
- Then step into my office.

- Merry Christmas Mrs. Ocean.

336
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:15,811
What are you doing here?

337
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:19,719
Hey, you better stop getting prettier
every day, you'll turn into a monopoly.

338
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,347
I asked you a question, why are you here?

339
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,519
Well, I got scared I'd gets two shorts from
all those leis hanging around my neck.

340
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:32,100
- Same sweet talking Sam, Danny still in bed?
- No, not exactly.

341
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,908
- In the hospital, see?
- Oh, no, no.

342
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:38,301
Because some doctor called the place
I work and said Danny is very sick.

343
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,075
- Frankly, that doctor was me.
- In fact the message said he was dying.

344
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,575
I wanted to make sure you'd come over.

345
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:50,750
- Dying was the touch that gave it away.
- You knew it was a gag?

346
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:54,204
It's the sort of stunt Danny usually
pulls when he wants to see me.

347
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,881
Why you come over if you knew was a gag?

348
00:29:58,165 --> 00:30:03,110
Oh, it's Christmas. I have a
present for him, simple as that.

349
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:05,343
Now what's your excuse?

350
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:11,613
I was wondering what it is, I come to the
conclusion it must be love, mother love.

351
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:18,107
I'll consider mistress, play thing, toy for
a night but I refuse to be your mother.

352
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:21,067
- And that's out.
- No, you got it all wrong, I'm the mother.

353
00:30:21,097 --> 00:30:23,835
I just don't like you and Danny busting up.

354
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:26,199
Yeah.

355
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,169
We're sort of eye to eye there.

356
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:31,866
I'd like to straighten him out.

357
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:37,340
No Mother, he's the
only one that can do that.

358
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,724
What happened to your marriage Bea?

359
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,545
It drowned in champagne.

360
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,633
With both of you on cloud nine,
I didn't think it got boring out there.

361
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,511
Boring, no.

362
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:55,032
I just woke up one morning and realized
there's nothing of any prospect, thin air.

363
00:30:55,938 --> 00:31:00,111
So I got off at the next
mountain, walked down, got a job.

364
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:02,844
Danny didn't like that very well.

365
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:06,057
And a little later I left him.

366
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,576
How he feel about that?

367
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,534
Oh he, he wants me back, but not
enough to give me what I want.

368
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:15,545
Such as?

369
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:18,639
I want a life that doesn't
depend on the color of...

370
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,776
a card or the length of a horse's nose.

371
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:24,422
Danny ran into a little bad luck, eh?

372
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,528
If only he had.

373
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:32,349
A little bad luck might've made him realize
what things may mean when you earn them.

374
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,315
We didn't have a home Sam,
we had a floating crap game.

375
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,383
That's no life, it's a
way of running away from it.

376
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,729
- I better be going.
- Danny will be here any minute.

377
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,827
I have a job to get back to.

378
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:52,326
I don't really want see him
anyway Sam, there's no point in it.

379
00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:56,733
Danny is not the only one who's running away,

380
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,785
Don't hack at me Mother, his luck is
bound to run out one of this days.

381
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,667
When it does, if he
still wants me, I'll be around.

382
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:08,862
- Hello Danny.
- Hey Bea, wait a minute.

383
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,427
- Hold it.
- Down please.

384
00:32:11,726 --> 00:32:13,551
Oh, that make it, I came in with a fellow.

385
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:17,349
A fickle fellow, you stick
with me lieutenant, I'm sincere.

386
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,811
I got great news for you.

387
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:24,220
- Auburn beat Alabama by 12 points.
- No, this is important, honestly.

388
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,348
Hold it, come on back upstairs
at least for five minutes.

389
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:31,227
- No Danny. Down please.
- Up, all the way.

390
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:33,383
The Sky-room is not open
yet, there's no one serving.

391
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:35,497
- Fine.
- Why do I always give in?

392
00:32:35,762 --> 00:32:38,584
Not like not starting another round.
Now, I'm out of training.

393
00:32:38,614 --> 00:32:43,195
- It's a truce, peace talk, so help me.
- You always start that way.

394
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,102
Now, just sit there and don't interrupt me.

395
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:00,682
I got a very big deal
going on, lots of chips, carloads.

396
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:04,717
- That sounds familiar.
- That might be so but this time it's true.

397
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,470
Oh good, I'd like to have rich friends.

398
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,821
This is one of its friend that
wants to spend a bundle on you.

399
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,287
- Gee, thanks.
- Ok, that's settled.

400
00:33:14,551 --> 00:33:19,501
On January 2nd, I'll pick you up
and we're going to hop down to Rio.

401
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,571
You're serious?

402
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:25,127
- I honestly think you're serious.
- Yes, of course I'm serious.

403
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,640
- A week's trip to Rio.
- Yes.

404
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,095
Oh Danny, what a prize you are.

405
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:34,715
The only husband in the world
who proposition his wife.

406
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:38,581
Well, I married you once and
it didn't work out to well, so...

407
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:42,564
- what's wrong with a little hey-hey?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

408
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:46,276
I'd never knock it as long
there is a little love involved.

409
00:33:47,845 --> 00:33:51,401
- You mean there isn't?
- On your part, not much.

410
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:55,537
There's only one thing
you love Danny, that's danger.

411
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,571
Cliffhanging.

412
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:01,034
You can never love a
woman like you love danger.

413
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:05,122
And as long as you're luck goes
up you'll stay in love with danger.

414
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:08,134
As long as it keeps coming up heads.

415
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,262
Let's say you're right,
let's say you're absolutely right.

416
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,553
- But remember I did not invent myself.
- What's that suppose to mean?

417
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,847
That's mean I do not own the patent.

418
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,878
And I can't change it any
more than you change yours...

419
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,756
and anyone who says he can is a liar.

420
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:26,108
I didn't expect you to be perfect
just because I fell in love with you.

421
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,397
- Going down.
- Just a second.

422
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,149
And it wouldn't hurt you
to give me the same break.

423
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:37,575
I don't expect you to be perfect,
I want you to be my husband.

424
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:46,362
- Going down.
- Going down.

425
00:34:46,392 --> 00:34:48,714
- Where they serve the drinks?
- To the bar.

426
00:35:02,954 --> 00:35:04,971

- Mrs. Restes' residence.

433
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,659
- Is it Mother there?
- Oh yes Mr. Foster.

434

- Another innocent touch.

Oh, it was wicked of
you not at least to have telephoned.

437
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,547
- We've been home 3 whole days.
- What you mean we?

438
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:49,651
We? We means your poor
lonely mother and Mr. Santos.

439
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:51,916
I wrote you about him, I think.

440
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:55,470
He's been very kind to me
and he's a financial genius.

441
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,598
- Just what I always hoped you'd be.
- Yes Mother. Speaking of finances...

442
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,423
- Could you let me have some more?
- Some more what?

443
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,832
Money. M - O - N - Y.

444
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:10,955
- E.
- Yeah, M - O - N - E - Y.

445
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:14,297
Oh yes, of course darling.
If you tell me what you want it for.

446
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,095
I plan to paper the walls with it.

447
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:22,220
Oh Jimmy, shall I try and take an interest
in your affairs just snap my head off.

448
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:24,566
Oh mother, how do I know
what I'm going yo spent it on?

449
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:26,558
It just goes, you know what I mean?

450
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:30,892
Oh, you mean spending money.
Oh, why didn't you say so?

451
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:33,861
I was afraid you might be
considering some foolish investment.

452
00:36:34,473 --> 00:36:36,661
No Mother, nothing foolish.

453
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,651
Alright darling, hurry
over and bring me a big kiss.

454
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:44,849
- I want to see my big tall boy.
- Yes, yes Mother, I'll be there around 5.

455
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,000
What a way to make a living?

456
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:53,122
Alright Sam, let's have
a quick briefing on Hawaii.

457
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:56,763
Hawaii? Oh, great sunsets.

458
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,643
Only one a day but they're working on it.

459
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:02,865
Weather good enough
to get me up in the daytime?

460
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:05,104
Sometimes it rains, sometimes the sun is out.

461
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:06,643
And how about the women?

462
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:09,923
Sometimes it rains, sometimes the sun is out.

463
00:37:09,953 --> 00:37:13,139
Oh, speaking of women,
did you take a good look at Bea?

464
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:16,370
No really, no.
The play went around the other end.

465
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:21,405
- She's still in love with Danny, you know..
- And what's the problem? He's up too.

466
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:25,464
- Yeah, I'm worried about him.
- Worried?

467
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:30,953
- Maybe you mean is the project worries you.
- Can be part of it.

468
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:37,584
You trying to salt the
clouds, maybe spoil the picnic?

469
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:41,268
Jimmy, what do you need this picnic for?

470
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:44,048
If you want money all
you have to do is yell for Mother.

471
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,218
You haven't met Mother, have you?

472
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,188
No, but I gather she's very generous.

473
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,760
Generous to a fault.
Especially when it comes to husbands.

474
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,483
She only had five.

475
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:03,326
Oh, that must left you
pretty much out in the cold, eh?

476
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,076
No such luck.

477
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,803
Would you mind spelling that out?

478
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:15,084
I had so much mother love,
you'd thought I was quintuplets.

479
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:17,983
She wouldn't let me out of her
sight, everything was done for me.

480
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,590
After the war I tried to break away from her.

481
00:38:22,649 --> 00:38:25,111
Plenty of money is a hard habit to kick.

482
00:38:27,363 --> 00:38:29,307
That's why I;M going to our picnic.

483
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:35,165
- Well, the Hawaiian hotshot.
- Hi Danny.

484
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:36,495
Hello Sam, how are you?

485
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:42,223
Oh, same as always, I move, I breath, I seem
to feel the thrill of life along the keel.

486
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,725
You sound like a ferryboat.

487
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:47,353
I'm not a ferryboat, I'm a very manly slope.

488
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:49,913
Where I go people stare
at me in at dumb admiration.

489
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:51,316
And what happens when they speak?

490
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:54,714
And never mind that, let's get back to
where you ask me how I was, I was fine.

491
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,216
Will you get Spyros on the phone?

492
00:38:57,484 --> 00:38:58,438
You know something?

493
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:01,284
I think the only reason why I got into
this caper so I could see you again.

494
00:39:01,314 --> 00:39:04,466
Sounds like a hell of a price
and I agree with you, I'm worth it.

495
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:06,297
It is in time for the jokes.

496
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:10,299
For you Mr. Acebos, very important.

497
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:18,643
- Hello.
- This is the Los Angeles County morgue.

498
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:21,402
Los Angeles County morgue. Yes?

499
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,955
We have a couple of men down here...

500
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:26,501
one is well muscled and the
other one is rather slender build.

501
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:28,247
Oh my goodness, my...

502
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,277
These two young fellows
were traveling mighty fast...

503
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:33,026
in an automobile, look like their try
to keep an engagement somewhere,

504
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,899
Their names are...

505
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:39,576
Never mind, never mind
their names, I know, I knew them.

506
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,550
Would you be willing to identify them?

507
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:47,789
I'm willing. I'll, I'll
come down, I'll be right there.

508
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:52,143
Oh my goodness, yes.
And what is your name please?

509
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:55,411
Just ask for Detective Lieutenant Brannigan.

510
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,149
Detective Bra...

511
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:08,951
How did he get my name?

512
00:40:11,944 --> 00:40:13,823
Let's saddle up, let's go.

513
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:20,296
I finally caught up with you,
where you've been for days and days?

514
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:22,711
And what you doing back with your wife?

515
00:40:22,741 --> 00:40:27,096
I know she was here, in this hotel
with you, not more than an hour ago.

516
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:31,711
You're two-timing me,
and I'm warning you Danny Ocean.

517
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:36,392
I'm one girl you can't treat this way.
I won't be pushed around and neglected.

518
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:42,486
- What exactly you plan to do about it?
- Plenty, I'm going to do just plenty.

519
00:40:43,323 --> 00:40:47,016
- Isn't it about time you got started?
- Now wait a minute big buster...

520
00:40:47,046 --> 00:40:49,956
No, you wait a minute and
listen to me very carefully my dear.

521
00:40:50,687 --> 00:40:52,621
I picked you up at
the Biltmore Bar because I...

522
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:54,511
thought you were attractive
and I had nothing better to do.

523
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:57,575
And I made a pass at you
for the very same reasons.

524
00:40:57,697 --> 00:41:00,559
Now, I don't know what's your reason
were but nobody twisted your arm...

525
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:05,290
made you any promises.
So what is this act? Not outraged virtue.

526
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,636
You really are a rat.

527
00:41:10,732 --> 00:41:12,319
Why don't you let it go Adele?

528
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:15,351
I know all about the guys you had on a
string, you told me about it, remember?

529
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:17,421
And why you treating me
this way, I didn't do anything.

530
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:19,849
Neither did I, so why
don't just say goodbye nicely?

531
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:24,932
Surely. And maybe I should say
thank you, for being humiliated.

532
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,282
Well, put this in your pipe.

533
00:41:27,877 --> 00:41:33,095
One of these days I'll
break your back, I swear it.

534
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:41,279
- Is a good thing she doesn't pack a knife.
- How do you know she doesn't?

535
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:48,717
To the morgue.

536
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:52,463
You...

537
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,455
You low, miserable...

538
00:41:57,485 --> 00:42:03,053
I cry but not for you or you or you.
For my money you could drop dead.

539
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,901
I think he's mad at us,
let's go back to the hotel driver.

540
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:07,904
You stay right here.

541
00:42:08,877 --> 00:42:13,906
You, come out of that cab.
So I'm mad, I'm entitled.

542
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,900
Ok Spyros, we accept your apology.

543
00:42:22,294 --> 00:42:23,811
No phone call.

544
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:27,973
With all these jokes for
messages maybe you forgot...

545
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,905
to call everybody they
should be here for the meeting.

546
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:32,777
No, not at all, I just wanted to check
on you to see if you're still alive.

547
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,350
Me alive?

548
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,551
Well, you know how it is? You so apoplectic.

549
00:42:36,606 --> 00:42:41,478
My health is my greatest
virtue, every day I do exercises.

550
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:44,007
No, everybody is going to be
here at 9 o'clock for the meeting.

551
00:42:44,037 --> 00:42:47,631
Yeah, then you can entertain us by doing
some these deep knee bends push-ups.

552
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:51,306
- Good evening.
- Evening Marie, my mother at home?

553
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:53,648
She's expecting you
Mr. Foster but she's upstairs.

554
00:42:53,678 --> 00:42:54,588
Thank you.

555
00:42:56,549 --> 00:42:58,654
- Oh, you must be Jimmy.
- That's correct.

556
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:01,802
Your mama be down
in a minute, I'm Duke Santos.

557
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:04,588
I'll wait in here.

558
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:09,563
Must be a funny feeling meeting a total
stranger who's going to be your stepfather.

559
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:14,161
I mean, I think it's only natural
if you resent me a little.

560
00:43:17,443 --> 00:43:20,059
Then you won't mind if I don't call you Dad.

561
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,025
Duke is Ok.

562
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:27,614
Oh, it's the engagement
ring I bought your mama.

563
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,896
That's nice. Zircon, isn't it?

564
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:33,921
- Zircon? That's a diamond.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

565
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:36,775
You probably thought it was
a Zircon because it's so big.

566
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:41,425
It isn't too big, is it? Your
mama is got an wonderful taste.

567
00:43:41,761 --> 00:43:42,946
Has she?

568
00:43:46,527 --> 00:43:51,170
Alright, rich boy.
You want it that way, you got it.

569
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:53,981
Let's see how fat you get tangling with me.

570
00:43:54,186 --> 00:43:57,006
No, I know your record
Santos and your connections.

571
00:43:57,562 --> 00:44:03,117
A lot of loot and a rough guy to cross.
But I still reserve the right to dislike you.

572
00:44:04,587 --> 00:44:06,980
Well, sure, sure.

573
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:11,322
A man marries your mama, like I said,
it's only natural, takes a little time.

574
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,296
But you find out I can be a pretty good Joe.

575
00:44:14,326 --> 00:44:16,980
Yeah, I'll tell the FBI.

576
00:44:17,493 --> 00:44:19,865
They're not looking for
me anymore, I'm clear now.

577
00:44:20,603 --> 00:44:22,279
That's one point for Mother.

578
00:44:24,888 --> 00:44:27,475
Easy for you to
look down on people, isn't it?

579
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:34,107
All this ever since he was a baby.
You ever make a buck yourself?

580
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:36,005
No, but I have plans.

581
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:39,594
Know what I had when I
was a kid? A lot of nothing.

582
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:45,226
Nobody to help me either.
Now I got a lot of everything.

583
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,381
Got a lot of years too and a sick stomach.

584
00:44:50,526 --> 00:44:52,685
Proves that my way is better.

585
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:55,552
- What way?
- Choose rich parents.

586
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:01,569
Yeah, you bet that's better.

587
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:06,765
My folks are so poor I used to walk
New York barefoot winter and summer.

588
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:09,586
One day I'm swimming in the East river...

589
00:45:09,996 --> 00:45:12,765
when I come out I seen
a row of shoes in the wharf.

590
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:16,578
One pair brand new, I put them on, they fit.

591
00:45:17,857 --> 00:45:22,338
Then some kid yells, hey them
is my shoes, so we fight. I win.

592
00:45:23,244 --> 00:45:26,226
It's been that way ever since.
Fight, fight, all the time.

593
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:28,885
- And you always win?
- Sure, I got the guts.

594
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:33,159
Like you when you was in the
82nd Airborne, your mama told me.

595
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:38,954
You know, I've often wondered if
I'd have the guts to jump out of a plane.

596
00:45:42,048 --> 00:45:45,740
Only for money or if I was young.

597
00:45:47,762 --> 00:45:50,064
You got to be young to do anything.

598
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,462
Come on, loosen up.
Have a drink to my wedding.

599
00:45:53,492 --> 00:45:54,492
Why not?

600
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:01,671
- Soda?
- What about you?

601
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,988
- No, not me, I told you, delicate.
- Come on Mr. Santos, fight, always fight.

602
00:46:06,768 --> 00:46:08,397
You got the guts, you look at me win.

603
00:46:08,616 --> 00:46:12,317
- Yeah, but...
- What's the matter? Run out of guts?

604
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:37,926
- Darling, at last.
- Hello Mother.

605
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,118
What's wrong with Duke?

606
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:42,987
He'd a slight attack of courage.
We had a drink to your wedding.

607
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:44,867
He knows he can't touch it, poor darling.

608
00:46:44,897 --> 00:46:47,061
Yes, so he told me,
was naughty of me, won't me?

609
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:50,596
Indeed it was and not
congratulating me is naughty too.

610
00:46:50,626 --> 00:46:53,534
Oh, I'm sorry. Bon voyage.

611
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:56,967
Oh, I know must think you that
I'm on a marital merry-go-round...

612
00:46:56,997 --> 00:47:00,051
trying for all the brass
rings but this time is different.

613
00:47:00,502 --> 00:47:01,777
You can say that again.

614
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:05,094
Oh, I realizes his
background is impossible but...

615
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:07,196
please don't judge
him from that point of view.

616
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:10,531
Oh, what view do you suggest mother?

617
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:13,709
- A woman's.
- Oh, I find that highly impractical.

618
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,845
You can understand if you try.

619
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:19,712
Since your father died Duke Santos is
the only man who's ever needed me...

620
00:47:19,948 --> 00:47:22,011
really needed me, no, not my money.

621
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:26,095
Alright alright, I won't be critical.
And now speaking of money...

622
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,171
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

623
00:47:29,656 --> 00:47:34,014
A woman loves to be needed Jimmy, Duke
is the most important thing in my life now.

624
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:37,398
Outside of you of
course, so please be nice, eh?

625
00:47:37,428 --> 00:47:40,986
As soon I get back to town I'll butter
him up, tell him I'm sorry I needled him.

626
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:42,164
Oh, but where are you going?

627
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:45,446
I, I'm going skiing with, with
Danny Ocean, with the square ballet.

628
00:47:45,476 --> 00:47:47,243
But you won't miss the wedding?

629
00:47:47,273 --> 00:47:49,770
Mother, have I ever
missed one of your weddings?

630
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,736
Yes, the first one.

631
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:54,933
- Bye.
- Bye darling.

632
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,839
It's after 9, everybody
is here but this Jackson.

633
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:10,557
Shall we start the meeting without him?

634
00:48:11,463 --> 00:48:17,107
Lack of organization, it's a poison, it
poison enterprise, kills it dead, dead. Dead.

635
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:22,562
You know, all point in having money, is
so that other people know that you got it.

636
00:48:23,161 --> 00:48:26,989
I want to get me a big 50 foot
Chris-Craft and not even put it in the water.

637
00:48:27,502 --> 00:48:29,169
Just going to leave it in my driveway...

638
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,370
maybe give it to the
mailman or somebody like that.

639
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:35,191
Well, that's sound real stupid like,
why don't you use it to improve yourself?

640
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:38,703
I don't need no improving,
I'm alright the way I am.

641
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:40,372
Gin.

642
00:48:41,807 --> 00:48:43,842
Can understand that, I played it like a god.

643
00:48:43,872 --> 00:48:46,176
Well, don't you finish
the sentence, how many points?

644
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:49,602
They get 10 points.
Why don't you guys be smart?

645
00:48:49,632 --> 00:48:52,970
Won't you put your loot in with me, eh?
You know what I'm going to do with my money.

646
00:48:53,346 --> 00:48:54,987
I'm going to produce my own pictures.

647
00:48:56,645 --> 00:49:01,107
I got to listen to all this,
they're rotting my brain.

648
00:49:01,873 --> 00:49:07,073
So where is this Jackson?
Where's some sort of organization?

649
00:49:07,568 --> 00:49:09,072
Don't panic, will you?

650
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:14,617
You know, it's a good idea.

651
00:49:15,428 --> 00:49:18,785
Take a couple of hundred big ones
and do something for world peace.

652
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:23,175
Like buying out the Miss Universe contest.
Get rid of all the parade and all that jazz.

653
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:25,959
And just sit around and
talk to the girls, one by one.

654
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,842
Find out how things are in Sweden.

655
00:49:28,983 --> 00:49:31,055
Or invite them for a weekend to New Orleans.

656
00:49:31,085 --> 00:49:35,090
- Ramos gin fizz's, oysters Rockefeller...
- No, I don't like that good well approach.

657
00:49:35,774 --> 00:49:39,637
Use your loot right, you can order
them to New Orleans for the weekend.

658
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:44,492
- You like to explain that professor?
- Very simple, by turning money into power.

659
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:48,607
I go buy me some votes and go into politics.

660
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:52,786
Hey, that's a good idea big boy.
You'd make a good notary public.

661
00:49:53,049 --> 00:49:55,775
He'd make a better coroner.
One of laughing coroner.

662
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:59,929
- I'm going into going in politics.
- What's going to be your platform Big Sam?

663
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:02,596
Repeal the 14th and 20th amendment.

664
00:50:02,835 --> 00:50:05,130
Take the vote away from the
women, make slaves out of them.

665
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,124
Hey now, that's
something is real constructive.

666
00:50:07,355 --> 00:50:11,297
- Hey, will it cost much?
- Oh No, we'd have the price controlled.

667
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,142
No inflation on slaves,

668
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:16,253
Vote for Sam Harmon,
help stamp out mental health.

669
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:18,527
- You got a better platform?
- Sure.

670
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,272
Pay off your own party,
settle for an appointment.

671
00:50:21,494 --> 00:50:26,099
Yeah, that's real deep thinking. Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet our latest senator.

672
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:28,252
What a terrible thought.

673
00:50:28,816 --> 00:50:31,671
Why don't you become an ambassador, you
could be a big men some foreign country?

674
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:34,827
Make that a little foreign country,
we don't want a big enemy.

675
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:37,496
Yeah, little country like Andorra.

676
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:40,355
- Or Pomona.
- What about Little Rock?

677
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:44,779
Hey fellas, you have any idea how
much money a man can steal...

678
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:48,291
if he was something like
Commissioner of Indian Affairs?

679
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:50,235
That's what I'll be,
Commissioner of Indian Affairs.

680
00:50:50,265 --> 00:50:52,034
- That you'll never be.
- For what.

681
00:50:52,064 --> 00:50:55,431
Because I'm going to be secretary of
the interior and I won't appoint you.

682
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:57,709
- This commissions is a snobbish idea.
- -You won't?

683
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:58,578
No, I won't.

684
00:50:58,608 --> 00:51:02,726
Certitude, my dear fellow, went
out with equestrian statuary.

685
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:06,351
- Now, what kind of language is that?
- Beats me, that's not on me.

686
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:09,692
I don't know, but If you ask me,
I think that cat is a spy there.

687
00:51:13,644 --> 00:51:17,077
So where is this horse-wrangler? 9:30.

688
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:21,740
Still running around Salt Lake City
I'll bet, saying goodbye to his wives.

689
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,135
- And his horses.
- Yeah.

690
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:29,700
Up and down after up and down.
And the houseboy's night off yet.

691
00:51:50,997 --> 00:51:52,997
- Mr. Acebos?
- Who's asking?

692
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:55,350
He is, you know him?

693
00:51:55,588 --> 00:51:59,103
Oh Jackson, Louis, my boy, I...

694
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:01,815
What's wrong officer?
Louis, you did something?

695
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:05,415
Oh no sir, he didn't do anything, we just
want to be sure he got in the right place.

696
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:10,512
That's the Beverly Hills police for you, the
best in America, they pro, protect us...

697
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:12,798
night and day, thank you officer.

698
00:52:12,828 --> 00:52:16,871
Thank you, good night. You, you're crippled.

699
00:52:16,992 --> 00:52:19,056
Oh, no, it's not well,
that's the way we found him.

700
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:21,510
- Good night.
- Good night.

701
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:24,195
Oh Louis my boy, come in.

702
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:31,416
I couldn't be in error...

703
00:52:34,419 --> 00:52:36,437
I couldn't be in error, could I?

704
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:39,463
Your name couldn't be otherwise than Jackson?

705
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:43,228
No, I reckon that's my name partner.

706
00:52:43,697 --> 00:52:48,350
Don't please tell me why you had to
come in such a pitiable condition, don't.

707
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,973
Suits me Mr. Acebos.

708
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:53,813
- Hello Danny.
- Hello cowboy.

709
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:55,675
What took you so long?
You come on a horse back?

710
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:59,398
Hot damn, what a foxhole? Howdy, you all.

711
00:53:00,383 --> 00:53:02,292
- Hello, Josh.
- How are you?

712
00:53:02,322 --> 00:53:03,655
- Good, great.
- Hi.

713
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:08,226
So what's for you to be funny of?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

714
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:11,785
Enticing a broken armed man
into a project of such precision.

715
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:15,815
You know what your problem is? You
underestimate people, Louis, grab it.

716
00:53:15,845 --> 00:53:16,687
But...

717
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,165
What's, what's with the broken arm?

718
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:23,832
Why shucks Mr. Acebos? Is all healed now.

719
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:32,876
You knew this, you Dracula, you
want to worry me into an early grave.

720
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,049
Lieutenant, brief your group.

721
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:38,011
Anyone not at ease, get that way.

722
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:44,113
Some of you already have a general
idea the plan of this operation.

723
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:49,309
Before I give you the full picture, I
want to point out that everyone turned up.

724
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:51,724
Not one goof off.

725
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:55,110
I say this is a hell of a good sign.

726
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,738
Lieutenant, I think you and the sergeant
ought to be very proud of yourself.

727
00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:02,568
And you give us the good news,
how about the bad news?

728
00:54:03,174 --> 00:54:04,870
Sergeant Ocean.

729
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:20,814
This is our objective. Las Vegas, Nevada.

730
00:54:21,818 --> 00:54:25,446
Mission? To liberate millions of dollars.

731
00:54:28,985 --> 00:54:30,684
Now these are the 5 casinos we hit.

732
00:54:31,156 --> 00:54:35,054
Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn,
the Sands and the Flamingo.

733
00:54:35,415 --> 00:54:37,173
H hour is New Year's Eve.

734
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:42,446
Units involve, special combat teams made
up of former members of the 82nd Airborne.

735
00:54:43,673 --> 00:54:47,709
Just for curiosity, how did you figure
this is a job for old paratroopers?

736
00:54:47,739 --> 00:54:49,946
Why you didn't just
get some regular heist guys?

737
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,292
For the best of reasons Mr. Harmon.

738
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:57,389
A man with a criminal record can't get
near Las Vegas, might less the casinos.

739
00:54:58,359 --> 00:54:59,850
I guess that lets me out.

740
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,364
Don't be ridiculous, you're no hoodlum.
You got no connection to the underworld.

741
00:55:03,528 --> 00:55:05,552
Hoods always mix with other hoods.

742
00:55:06,237 --> 00:55:11,870
Where there're hoods, there stool pigeons.
But with us, no stool leads, no leaks.

743
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,941
Now you five guys working
on the hotels, which hotels you in?

744
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:17,860
- Flamingo.
- The Sands.

745
00:55:18,124 --> 00:55:19,554
- Desert Inn.
- Riviera.

746
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:20,608
Sahara.

747
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:24,863
Now, there'll be 5 more men working as
floaters with you inside guys as 2 men teams.

748
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,927
Sam, you've been in Vegas many times.

749
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:29,993
Give me a rundown on exact
action takes place New Year's Eve.

750
00:55:30,595 --> 00:55:33,952
Come midnight they go nuts.
Everybody kisses anybody.

751
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:37,960
Then because they just met each other, they
sing Should auld acquaintance be forgot.

752
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,766
How long you figure take to sing that song?

753
00:55:41,003 --> 00:55:42,425
Oh, I don't know, about...

754
00:55:42,455 --> 00:55:45,744
One minute and 38
seconds exactly, we timed it.

755
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,692
Now, one minute and 38
seconds after midnight we black out...

756
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,717
the whole town and hit
the 5 casinos at the same time.

757
00:55:53,895 --> 00:55:57,592
Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn...

758
00:55:57,737 --> 00:56:01,606
the Sands and the Flamingo.
Nobody will even see us.

759
00:56:03,795 --> 00:56:07,597
- You got a question Tony?
- How you figure to black out a whole town?

760
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:12,415
Let me ask you one, what happens
if you knock out one of these towers?

761
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,007
You'll get a short circuit as
soon as the cable touches the ground.

762
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:16,279
It's interesting.

763
00:56:16,867 --> 00:56:20,259
Reimer and Josh are the
demolition men, what's my job?

764
00:56:20,937 --> 00:56:24,339
We need you to open the doors for the
cashiers' cages for that where the loot is.

765
00:56:24,608 --> 00:56:26,671
Now, those doors are controlled electrically.

766
00:56:26,901 --> 00:56:29,695
The cashier can open them
by pushing a button from the inside.

767
00:56:30,446 --> 00:56:33,052
But if the button is on the inside
I can't push it from the outside.

768
00:56:33,283 --> 00:56:36,390
But that's exactly where you
going to push it from, the outside.

769
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:41,164
Now, every casino is got an auxiliary motor
That generates enough power to light up...

770
00:56:41,194 --> 00:56:44,524
the gambling tables and cashiers'
cages whenever the main cable fails...

771
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,616
which happens quite often.

772
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:51,396
The auxiliary motor kicks in automatically,
20 seconds and they're back in business.

773
00:56:51,426 --> 00:56:54,727
Except they won't quite be back
in business on account of you Tony.

774
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,127
Now, let me ask you a question...

775
00:56:57,386 --> 00:57:00,327
What happens if you cross
the wires that operate lights...

776
00:57:00,357 --> 00:57:02,624
with wires that open the cage doors?

777
00:57:03,021 --> 00:57:07,424
Well, when the auxiliary motor
kicks in, instead of the lights going on...

778
00:57:08,806 --> 00:57:12,909
- the doors of the cages will click open.
- As simple as that.

779
00:57:13,702 --> 00:57:17,681
Yes, in theory, but to be sure I have to
study the main switch box in each casino.

780
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:20,148
Oh, but you will, you will.

781
00:57:22,248 --> 00:57:26,858
- Is this the only road in or out Vegas?
- Yeah, that's route 91, why?

782
00:57:26,888 --> 00:57:29,826
Oh, I remember reading
about this guy in Perth.

783
00:57:29,856 --> 00:57:32,199
Is this going to be
another of your long stories?

784
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:36,308
- Who cut up his grandmother.
- Cut up his grandmother?

785
00:57:36,338 --> 00:57:37,854
Come on fellows, let him talk.

786
00:57:38,018 --> 00:57:41,259
Who cut up here
grandmother and mailed her out of town.

787
00:57:42,094 --> 00:57:44,486
Everything went find
until he ran out of stamps.

788
00:57:44,992 --> 00:57:46,813
Which proves something very crucial, right?

789
00:57:46,814 --> 00:57:49,314
Now, wait a minute, there
Pete is got a very good point.

790
00:57:49,343 --> 00:57:52,869
Now, getting you missing as though is
wanting but getting out of town is another.

791
00:57:53,655 --> 00:57:56,381
- Yeah, that's where Josh comes in.
- I was wonder.

792
00:57:56,411 --> 00:58:00,997
But don't wonder. He's the
main cog, if he goofs, it's over.

793
00:58:02,182 --> 00:58:06,452
- What's wrinkling you Curly?
- How long can we depend on a staying dark?

794
00:58:06,618 --> 00:58:09,281
- 10, 15 minutes.
- It's not much time.

795
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:12,100
It's plenty of time if everyone
does what he's suppose to do.

796
00:58:12,674 --> 00:58:18,319
Danny is right. You should all
move like clockwork, seventeen jewel.

797
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:24,200
Boys, I wanted you should think
of this as a full fledged battle.

798
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:27,933
Leap into it with same high pride hearts...

799
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:31,243
that got you across the Rhine River and...

800
00:58:32,277 --> 00:58:34,313
other historical places.

801
00:58:34,535 --> 00:58:40,848
Just think, think how proud all the big
brass in the Pentagon would be, would be...

802
00:58:40,878 --> 00:58:46,142
knowing that their labors made
this, this beautiful operation possible.

803
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,241
You know, I think they all sit right...

804
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:52,771
down in the officers' mess
and have a good cry from happiness.

805
00:58:54,386 --> 00:58:57,686
Even I myself am little bit tempted.

806
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:03,156
- Any further questions?
- Yeah, what's your job Acebos?

807
00:59:03,725 --> 00:59:07,002
Yeah Mr. Acebos, what you all going to do?

808
00:59:07,634 --> 00:59:09,993
Our modest friend here is a known felon.

809
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:12,950
They take one look at him
up in Vegas and we're kaput.

810
00:59:13,276 --> 00:59:15,498
- That's it.
- Any more questions?

811
00:59:15,528 --> 00:59:18,847
- Comments, anybody worried?
- I got a suggestion.

812
00:59:19,115 --> 00:59:21,156
- What is it Sam?
- Forget it.

813
00:59:21,816 --> 00:59:24,862
- Forget? Why...
- The whole deal, forget the whole deal.

814
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:27,241
And believe me, I'd like to swing
like the rest of you guys, but...

815
00:59:27,271 --> 00:59:29,429
you haven't got a plan
here, you got a pipe blow.

816
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:34,481
Is this another of your
morbid jokes Danny, you sadist?

817
00:59:35,757 --> 00:59:41,082
- What's wrong with our story Sam?
- For one thing, 15 years.

818
00:59:41,554 --> 00:59:44,376
This ain't a combat
team, it's a long night meeting.

819
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:48,377
Any of you lairs want to claim
you're half the man you were in '45?

820
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,625
Can you run as fast? Can you think as fast?

821
00:59:50,897 --> 00:59:53,682
Can you mix it up as good
you used to? Well, I sure can't.

822
00:59:53,846 --> 00:59:56,716
And Danny, if you want to try and
catch lightning in a ball you go ahead...

823
00:59:56,746 --> 01:00:00,698
but don't try and catch yesterday.
Old times are only good when you've had them.

824
01:00:01,696 --> 01:00:02,954
Sam...

825
01:00:04,103 --> 01:00:06,687
some guys grow old without turning chicken.

826
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,650
Did you hear about it?

827
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:14,112
Ok, Lieut Lionheart, I grant you're brave.
But the question now is, how dumb are you?

828
01:00:14,142 --> 01:00:17,375
I'm the only one here that knows Las Vegas.
Why don't you guys believe me when I...

829
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:20,883
tell you the percentage is always
with the house? With the house.

830
01:00:21,143 --> 01:00:24,204
The percentage is with the people
rigging the game and in this case is us.

831
01:00:25,267 --> 01:00:29,746
- Deserter under fire, a traitor.
- Oh, shut up or I'll step on you.

832
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:35,080
You can't let him walk out like
this, it disrupts the entire plan.

833
01:00:35,352 --> 01:00:37,554
Maybe you got an idea on how to stop him?

834
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:42,354
- He owes you, you saved his life.
- And I'm trying to save his life.

835
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:43,544
Sam.

836
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,131
Thank you Danny.

837
01:00:46,161 --> 01:00:49,206
You don't owe me a thing Sam,
and you're entitled to your opinion.

838
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,161
Anybody agree with him?

839
01:01:00,268 --> 01:01:03,153
What about you Josh? You got brains.

840
01:01:03,469 --> 01:01:06,917
Yeah, I got brains Sam,
but I got to go with Danny.

841
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:10,755
Well, at least it only
leaves us one man short.

842
01:01:10,977 --> 01:01:14,844
One man short? Oh, that's nothing, nothing.

843
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:17,935
Danny darling, just run a want ad.

844
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:22,853
This means we have to leave out one of the
casinos, which one you think it ought to be?

845
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:25,265
By way, way, hold it, hold it.
Nobody is walking out.

846
01:01:25,366 --> 01:01:28,393
So I can't talk you guys out of it, I can't.

847
01:01:28,543 --> 01:01:32,279
I'm certainly not going let you boobs,
trying pull this job without your best man.

848
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:36,322
So go ahead, let's me have it.
When do we blow this mausoleum?

849
01:01:36,352 --> 01:01:37,755
Cuckoo.

850
01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:43,037
The day after tomorrow
gentleman, we'll be in Las Vegas.

851
01:01:53,104 --> 01:01:55,335
Happy New Year.

852
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:39,832
You spray the stuff on your shoes yet?

853
01:02:39,862 --> 01:02:43,389
I did, but that infrared paint you
gave me isn't ready for the public yet.

854
01:02:43,611 --> 01:02:48,592
- I can't see a single footprint.
- Of course you can, try this.

855
01:02:49,988 --> 01:02:52,401
Still nothing Danny must be off his rocker.

856
01:02:52,431 --> 01:02:56,728
Cool it. Put these on. Go ahead, put them on.

857
01:02:57,509 --> 01:02:58,946
Now look.

858
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:05,573
Wow.

859
01:03:06,356 --> 01:03:08,079
I got an extra can of this jazz.

860
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,680
I want you to do me a
favor, don't be stingy with it, Ok?

861
01:03:12,051 --> 01:03:13,119
- Hey.
- What?

862
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:18,238
They ought to mix this with dames makeup.
It would make for interesting midnights.

863
01:03:18,268 --> 01:03:19,524
Yeah, I'm hipped.

864
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:39,838
One, two, three, four. Two, two,
three, four. Three, two, come on kids.

865
01:03:43,962 --> 01:03:48,047
Hup, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four. One...

866
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:51,399
Hey, kill it, kill it. Go on,
Helen, get in there, take her place.

867
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:52,920
You got a tough job.

868
01:05:07,587 --> 01:05:08,938
Why so many barrels?

869
01:05:09,314 --> 01:05:13,416
I don't know, is a whole of dinners, when
is a la carte, then we get sensible garbage.

870
01:05:15,142 --> 01:05:16,732
We'll have none of that.

871
01:05:48,546 --> 01:05:50,297
- Sorry.
- Hi you.

872
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:53,459
- Oh hello Mr. Skelton.
- So you remember me, eh?

873
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:56,605
- I remember what you told me too.
- What I told you?

874
01:05:56,844 --> 01:06:00,006
Oh, about putting limit on myself? But
you don't take that seriously, did you?

875
01:06:00,225 --> 01:06:04,126
You said you'd break me like a dry twig
if I cashed another one of your checks.

876
01:06:04,314 --> 01:06:08,879
Oh well, don't pay any attention to that kind
of talk, is all solid flab, you know, eh?

877
01:06:08,909 --> 01:06:11,544
I actually haven't got the strength
to pull a wing over a dead bee.

878
01:06:11,574 --> 01:06:14,570
- Here cash the check.
- No use arguing.

879
01:06:14,774 --> 01:06:18,552
- We won't let you exceed your limit.
- Oh, this is unbelievable.

880
01:06:19,474 --> 01:06:22,525
Get a load of this guy, the way he acts
he thinks we're going to stick up the joint.

881
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:24,747
- We wouldn't do that, would we?
- No.

882
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:26,274
Ridiculous, cash the check.

883
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:29,527
Please Mr. Skelton,
this gentleman is waiting.

884
01:06:29,629 --> 01:06:32,704
Like a tree, buddy
boy, I'm standing right here...

885
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:35,918
like an leafy elm until you
cash that perfectly good check.

886
01:06:36,845 --> 01:06:38,550
You ought to be a little more careful.

887
01:06:38,738 --> 01:06:40,872
You know, I may hit a
lucky streak and win this casino.

888
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:43,063
It can happen you know,
the whole joint could be mine.

889
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,764
Then wonder what cashier's
little old nose would be out of joint?

890
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:48,418
- Let me tell you pal.
- Oh, no guts, eh?

891
01:06:48,678 --> 01:06:51,676
- Had send for Wyatt Earp little fat brother.
- It's Ok.

892
01:06:51,706 --> 01:06:54,172
Watch my arm, that's my old slot machine arm.

893
01:06:55,088 --> 01:06:56,986
Silver dollars please.

894
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:30,411
- Coffee please.
- Could you light me up please?

895
01:09:41,112 --> 01:09:44,935
I had the key made, be
careful with it, cost me two bits.

896
01:09:44,965 --> 01:09:48,398
I hope somebody is keeping an
eye on all this reckless spending.

897
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:50,777
- Here's, here's one for the Sahara.
- Right.

You look like you
getting a combat fatigue girls...

915
01:12:34,144 --> 01:12:36,185
you've been up on that line a long time.

916
01:13:53,698 --> 01:13:57,198
- Everything alright Joe?
- Like tulips in July Mac.

917
01:14:17,472 --> 01:14:19,821
- You want to get a split, don't you?
- - Come on Josh.

918
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:23,979
- I can do it if you cool it just a second.
- Be sure you let go of the ball hard.

919
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:33,191
- What you find out last night?
- Casinos don't like to be robbed.

920
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:37,308
It's a pretty narrow minded aptitude,
Go right wire-crossing work?

921
01:14:37,537 --> 01:14:39,749
Technically yes,
technically everything works.

922
01:14:40,034 --> 01:14:41,742
How long will it take you to rig them?

923
01:14:41,906 --> 01:14:46,237
Oh, 5 casinos, 15
minutes each, that's 75 minutes.

924
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:50,062
Traveling time 25 minutes,
that's an hour and 40 minutes.

925
01:14:50,588 --> 01:14:53,194
And that's when I'll rig them.
One hour and 40 minutes before we get.

926
01:14:53,224 --> 01:14:57,343
- Can't you preset them so it's ready?
- Can't take the chance.

927
01:14:58,763 --> 01:15:00,999
If the main cable should
fails legitimately, those doors...

928
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,046
spring open like a set of false thief.

929
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:06,418
- Did you pick a tower?
- The biggest.

930
01:15:06,626 --> 01:15:08,126
Josh will give me a hand.

931
01:15:10,338 --> 01:15:11,531
What about the Sahara?

932
01:15:13,206 --> 01:15:17,014
One security cop really got me
bugged, the guy sits in front of the cages.

933
01:15:17,044 --> 01:15:19,763
Must've arthritis or something,
sun of a gun, he never moves.

934
01:15:19,993 --> 01:15:21,855
A left hook will keep him that way.

935
01:15:23,163 --> 01:15:25,844
- Sam?
- Steady as down country loving.

936
01:15:25,874 --> 01:15:26,858
Good boy.

937
01:15:28,418 --> 01:15:29,760
Louis, what about the Desert Inn?

938
01:15:30,295 --> 01:15:33,460
Why, it'll be just as easy
as riding a stuffed horse.

939
01:15:34,048 --> 01:15:35,698
- How's that?
- It'll be as...

940
01:15:35,728 --> 01:15:37,008
Just forget it.

941
01:15:38,585 --> 01:15:40,567
- Jimmy?
- Flamingo is all set.

942
01:15:41,973 --> 01:15:43,041
What about the Sands?

943
01:15:44,893 --> 01:15:46,523
Smooth and level.

944
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,669
Alright, nobody carries
identification until the job is done.

945
01:15:52,337 --> 01:15:54,471
Everybody got an
inside job, you go back to work.

946
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:57,077
The rest of us will wait
outside, mingle with the crowd.

947
01:15:57,198 --> 01:15:59,913
Stand in front of your respected
casinos until Jimmy and I contact.

948
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:04,238
What are we going to do with our self
till we hit? We have all today and tomorrow.

949
01:16:05,038 --> 01:16:07,610
Hey, I got an idea, therapeutic idea.

950
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,888
Forget it. No, no.

951
01:16:09,918 --> 01:16:13,873
Today Tonight and all day tomorrow
we rehearse and keep rehearsing until H hour.

952
01:16:14,606 --> 01:16:17,737
- Transportation?
- Have no fear, little Josh is here.

953
01:16:18,175 --> 01:16:20,759
- Let's go, Mushy is up.
- Come on, you make it.

954
01:16:21,186 --> 01:16:23,102
- I never bowled in my life.
- Fake it.

955
01:16:35,652 --> 01:16:39,922
- Do we have time for another show?
- What about the lounge at the Sands?

956
01:16:39,952 --> 01:16:42,249
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah, it's my lucky spot.

957
01:16:57,465 --> 01:16:58,831
Someone you know?

958
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:02,031
I just thought that I recognized
somebody I know from the profession.

959
01:17:02,262 --> 01:17:04,370
Yours or his? Come on.

960
01:17:30,832 --> 01:17:35,723
- Well, well, well.
- What are you doing here?

961
01:17:35,753 --> 01:17:38,285
Same thing you are, cheating.

962
01:17:38,464 --> 01:17:41,116
Ah no, you got
me wrong, I'm here on business.

963
01:17:41,342 --> 01:17:43,197
I expect my party any minute.

964
01:17:43,891 --> 01:17:48,078
I'd like to see her
and I'll bet your wife would too.

965
01:17:48,558 --> 01:17:52,318
Now, you don't understand,
I'm all alone, cross my heart.

966
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,472
I hope you die.

967
01:17:55,276 --> 01:17:58,884
Take your hands off me or I'll call that cop.

968
01:17:59,152 --> 01:18:00,643
Let's not panic.

969
01:18:12,156 --> 01:18:16,771
When you realize how wrong you are, use that.

970
01:18:34,646 --> 01:18:35,566
Hello?

971
01:18:35,897 --> 01:18:40,472
Mrs. Ocean? This is a friend.
I'm calling from Las Vegas.

972
01:18:41,611 --> 01:18:45,976
I just think you'd be interested
to know that your husband...

973
01:18:46,626 --> 01:18:48,972
is up to in Vegas.

974
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:54,454
That's funny, I was taught that creature
like you always rattled before they struck.

975
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:57,393
- And I didn't hear a thing.
- I thought I was doing you a favor.

976
01:18:57,992 --> 01:19:02,317
- Sorry I disturbed you.
- No Malicious, I'm not disturbed.

977
01:19:02,787 --> 01:19:05,824
When I learn Danny has
an enemy as venomous as you...

978
01:19:06,292 --> 01:19:08,446
it just makes me love him a little more.

979
01:19:09,642 --> 01:19:12,462
Call me anytime, love
to have you waste your money.

980
01:19:24,404 --> 01:19:26,923
Happy burial, dead dog.

981
01:19:44,382 --> 01:19:47,283
- Are you all ready Pete?
- Just a second.

982
01:19:52,015 --> 01:19:55,042
- What time is it set-up?
- One minute, 38 seconds past midnight.

983
01:19:55,072 --> 01:19:56,736
- It's five after 6.
- Right.

984
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:01,454
One minute and 38 seconds past 12 o'clock.

985
01:20:01,484 --> 01:20:05,048
Big Daddy and then happy New Year.

you always run into people you know.

- And usually wish you hadn't.
- My sentiment is exactly.

1001
01:21:21,229 --> 01:21:23,960
Excuse me a second, will you honey?
I want to go bar side a minute.

No, he's shivering in Squaw valley.

- But he's here.
- Here, in Vegas?

1006
01:21:36,786 --> 01:21:39,642
Here at the Flamingo, I saw him last night.

1007
01:21:39,843 --> 01:21:42,414
Oh dear, don't tell me
he broke something skiing.

Nothing that showed.

1009
01:21:44,669 --> 01:21:46,707
Oh, why would he tell
me he was going to Squaw?

01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:49,839
Oh, I'm stupid, it's simple.

1011
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,121
He ran into some jiggly little
number who was Vegas bound.

Jiggly little number isn't the way

I got a date in the casino, here's your key.

1028
01:25:31,729 --> 01:25:36,977
You're wasting, wasting your time with
that Clyde honey, he's a loser, he's a loser.

1029
01:25:44,036 --> 01:25:47,831
Oh, I'm so drunk I don't think I
could lie down without holding on.

1030
01:26:00,429 --> 01:26:02,087
Get her out of here.

1031
01:26:06,931 --> 01:26:10,613
Here you are Missy, happy New Year to you.

1032
01:26:10,643 --> 01:26:14,197
It so happens that I do not
know who you are my good fellow.

1033
01:26:14,227 --> 01:26:17,794
Oh well now, who do I have to be
to wish you a happy New Year?

1034
01:26:19,325 --> 01:26:20,451
Ricky Nelson.

1035
01:26:21,393 --> 01:26:23,909
I used to be Ricky
Nelson, I'm Perry Como now.

1036
01:26:24,468 --> 01:26:26,459
No, you're not, you moved.

1037
01:26:27,035 --> 01:26:31,240
Smart girl, smart girl. Now, about this
night air, let's get in out of it, come on.

1038
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,088
- Come on.
- Is it New Year's yet?

1039
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,395
Too close for comfort, come on.

1040
01:26:36,425 --> 01:26:40,495
I hate it too, I hate holidays.
Do you like the holidays?

1041
01:26:40,673 --> 01:26:42,715
Hey, give me a little kiss, how about it, eh?

1042
01:26:42,745 --> 01:26:44,531
Sound idea, it's good talking. Yeap.

1043
01:26:44,561 --> 01:26:47,441
- Right there and I'll be there in a minute.
- And I'll wait for you.

1044
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:05,215
You know something? I think I kiss better
when I'm drunk than I do when I'm sober.

1045
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,826
- Some other time.
- Where you going?

1046
01:27:08,012 --> 01:27:12,050
Oh, after all that we've meant
to each other, I must leave you.

1047
01:27:12,288 --> 01:27:16,020
- Hey now, this is a dirty deal.
- Our first quarrel.

1048
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:21,052
- I don't fit into your picture?
- From here on in you don't sweetheart.

1049
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:24,111
- Good night.
- Good night.

1050
01:27:25,677 --> 01:27:26,916
It's Ok man.

1051
01:27:27,971 --> 01:27:32,375
It's Ok, it so happens
I'm very much in demand.

1052
01:27:34,394 --> 01:27:39,173
Maestro, if you please.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's almost midnight.

1053
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:43,531
So pucker up your
lips ladies, 20 seconds to go.

1054
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:54,368
20, 19, 18, 17, 16...

1055
01:27:54,783 --> 01:28:00,783
15, 14, 13, 12, 11...

1056
01:28:01,381 --> 01:28:07,005
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

1057
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:13,022
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1058
01:28:13,224 --> 01:28:15,671
Happy New Year.

1059
01:29:14,706 --> 01:29:16,672
Lights, lights.

1060
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:20,152
Darn that cable,
it's the second time this month.

1061
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:23,447
Stay where you are, the
lights will be back on any minute.

1062
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:28,324
Once more George, from the top and
keep playing until the lights come on.

1063
01:29:34,211 --> 01:29:36,638
Oh, pardon me, wrong girl.

1064
01:29:55,185 --> 01:29:59,185
Douse those lights. Now sing loud and clear.

1065
01:30:06,808 --> 01:30:08,227
Sing louder.

1066
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,526
With the music now,
when shouldn't it be forgot?

1067
01:30:17,415 --> 01:30:19,723
Blow out the candle. Blow.

1068
01:30:21,352 --> 01:30:24,550
Alright now, sing.
It's a party, loud and clear.

1069
01:30:24,772 --> 01:30:26,731
Do what he says Charlie, trick or treat.

1070
01:30:27,432 --> 01:30:29,756
You too, let's make it a duet.

1071
01:30:31,996 --> 01:30:33,397
Little louder.

1072
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:11,286
We've been hit.

1073
01:33:26,603 --> 01:33:28,362
- We've been tapped.
- What?

1074
01:33:28,392 --> 01:33:30,022
We've been held up, robbed.

1075
01:33:32,252 --> 01:33:34,232
Give me the sheriff's office, hurry.

1076
01:33:35,764 --> 01:33:37,252
- Hello.
- Sheriff Wimmer?

1077
01:33:37,282 --> 01:33:38,875
Yeah, this is sheriff Wimmer speaking.

1078
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:43,251
- Flamingo speaking, we've been tapped.
- What? We'll be right over.

1079
01:33:44,824 --> 01:33:47,987
The Flamingo, roll cars 620, 622 and 624.

1080
01:33:48,017 --> 01:33:50,384
You can roll some more,
they just knocked over the Sands.

1081
01:33:50,603 --> 01:33:52,333
Happy New Year.

1082
01:33:52,363 --> 01:33:55,011
- How it come off?
- Like a charm.

1083
01:33:55,233 --> 01:33:56,824
Same here, fantastic.

1084
01:33:58,055 --> 01:34:01,389
Attention all cars,
cover all entrances and exits.

1085
01:34:01,573 --> 01:34:04,850
Sands, Sahara, Flamingo,
Desert Inn and Riviera.

1086
01:34:05,218 --> 01:34:06,534
Check everyone who leaves.

1087
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,243
Don't you get a look
at them? Any kind of them?

1088
01:34:10,273 --> 01:34:11,406
What? In the dark?

1089
01:34:11,713 --> 01:34:14,722
I see, it was dark, don't
you hear anybody say anything?

1090
01:34:14,752 --> 01:34:18,194
- Yeah, he said we should sing.
- He said you should sing.

1091
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:22,739
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Don Murphy...

1092
01:34:22,769 --> 01:34:26,111
speaking for station
KLAS-TV, here in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1093
01:34:26,141 --> 01:34:28,521
We're standing in front
of the famous Hotel Riviera.

1094
01:34:28,808 --> 01:34:32,218
In just a few moments, you'll hear
some reports of this fantastic robbery...

1095
01:34:32,248 --> 01:34:35,309
from the spot eyewitnesses.
Yes, do you have something you want to say?

1096
01:34:35,339 --> 01:34:42,472
Say, do me a favor, if you going to
interview people, pick elderly couples.

1097
01:34:42,502 --> 01:34:44,637
Some of the others don't
always belong together.

1098
01:34:49,342 --> 01:34:52,837
- Don't look now, it's little old me.
- Hoops, how your action go?

1099
01:34:52,867 --> 01:34:55,628
If it were any easy, I
might ashamed to take the money.

1100
01:34:55,658 --> 01:34:57,073
Good boy, get lost now.

1101
01:34:58,588 --> 01:35:03,984
Cars 305 and 309, reinforce roadblocks
extending to Barstow, acknowledge.

1102
01:35:04,177 --> 01:35:08,099
Get a rundown on every train leaving
Vegas, passenger and freight, east and west.

1103
01:35:19,265 --> 01:35:20,325
Things went too easy.

1104
01:35:22,769 --> 01:35:23,760
Tony.

1105
01:35:29,294 --> 01:35:32,054
Never the luck, never the luck.

1106
01:35:39,003 --> 01:35:40,933
- Tony.
- Tony.

1107
01:35:46,135 --> 01:35:48,385
Ok folks, get back. Ok.

1108
01:35:57,691 --> 01:36:01,725
- Call for an ambulance quick.
- Ok, but this guy is dead.

1109
01:36:07,089 --> 01:36:10,007
Look Danny Tony is just
another guy died in the street.

1110
01:36:10,785 --> 01:36:13,641
- Lot of guys die in the street.
- Sure they do.

1111
01:36:13,872 --> 01:36:15,170
Happens all the time.

1112
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:18,970
- No sweat.
- No sweat.

1113
01:36:20,461 --> 01:36:23,664
Yes, I heard you,
check all out going flights.

1114
01:36:23,798 --> 01:36:26,118
Car 306, 306, come in please.

1115
01:36:26,228 --> 01:36:28,252
I want every piece of luggage examined.

1116
01:36:28,376 --> 01:36:31,122
306, proceed with plan 22. Over.

1117
01:36:31,324 --> 01:36:34,988
Ask them, they don't
cooperate, fine, let's find out why.

1118
01:36:35,018 --> 01:36:38,466
- I haven't a man to spare and we can do it.
- What you mean you can't do it?

1119
01:36:39,272 --> 01:36:42,299
- How it go?
- Smooth as a peeled egg, how about you?

1120
01:36:42,519 --> 01:36:45,271
Well, things happen can break you up,
things you don't expect, you know.

1121
01:36:45,301 --> 01:36:47,237
- Like what?
- Tony is dead.

1122
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:48,929
Bergdorf?

1123
01:36:49,117 --> 01:36:51,237
Heart attack, I guess,
he drop crossing the street.

1124
01:36:51,425 --> 01:36:54,724
- Cops got to him before we did.
- They'll check up on him.

1125
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:59,015
Sure they will, what they going to find?
Nothing, nobody will ever know.

1126
01:36:59,542 --> 01:37:01,409
Yeah, no one but us.

1127
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:06,282
Don't hit me on the head with that,
will you? I'll tell the other men about Tony.

1128
01:37:06,312 --> 01:37:10,012
Maybe by tell them, they won't panic.
Meantime the plan remains the same.

1129
01:37:10,042 --> 01:37:13,752
The money stays where it is until the heat is
off, nobody takes out until we get a word.

1130
01:37:13,782 --> 01:37:16,796
Maybe you better go back
to your job, I'll contact you later.

1131
01:37:16,826 --> 01:37:17,599
Ok.

1132
01:37:20,198 --> 01:37:21,702
He's taking it hard.

1133
01:37:21,941 --> 01:37:25,497
Yeah, long time since
he lost a man in combat.

1134
01:37:30,591 --> 01:37:33,001
Is it true somebody
stole millions of dollars?

1135
01:37:33,031 --> 01:37:37,462
Oh yes ma'am, but there's still some
left. Would you move along please?

1136
01:38:04,315 --> 01:38:06,932
The sheriff's office and the State police...

1137
01:38:06,944 --> 01:38:10,777
have assured us we're going to have
a round down and capture by morning.

1138
01:38:11,656 --> 01:38:15,189
Thank you very much sir.
And there you have it.

1139
01:38:15,326 --> 01:38:19,792
Millions of dollars are missing,
stolen by an unknown number of men, but...

1140
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:23,297
at this very minute they're being tracked
down as they skulk through the night...

1141
01:38:23,327 --> 01:38:27,877
down dark roads and lonely alleys where
the long arm of the law is reaching out.

1142
01:38:47,442 --> 01:38:49,374
- Happy New Year officer.
- Yeah, Happy new year.

1143
01:38:49,404 --> 01:38:51,557
Say, what's going on before leaves Santa?

1144
01:38:51,779 --> 01:38:54,226
Will you get this
garbage truck on out of here?

1145
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,597
I'll be glad to do that there.

1146
01:39:03,476 --> 01:39:05,630
Happy New Year.

1147
01:40:28,459 --> 01:40:31,264
Oh, my goodness.

1148
01:40:32,504 --> 01:40:34,094
He Danny.

1149
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:46,464
Before I'll tell you why I called this
meeting, I want to get one point straight.

1150
01:40:46,686 --> 01:40:48,917
We're not the sole owners of our casinos.

1151
01:40:49,147 --> 01:40:52,174
We all have partners that
we have to answer to, right?

1152
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:56,124
- You can say that again.
- Mine are coming after me with a robe.

1153
01:40:56,154 --> 01:40:57,796
Mine are not too happy either.

1154
01:40:58,114 --> 01:41:00,766
But they gave me a free hand
to make the best deal I can.

1155
01:41:01,257 --> 01:41:03,018
What deal? For what?

1156
01:41:03,828 --> 01:41:07,419
To get our money back. Now, how about it?

1157
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:09,573
You boys empowered to make a deal?

1158
01:41:09,603 --> 01:41:11,765
- I am.
- I am too.

1159
01:41:11,795 --> 01:41:15,319
Good, Duke Santos is coming in to see us.

1160
01:41:15,349 --> 01:41:18,768
- Duke Santos?
- Just doesn't figure.

1161
01:41:19,052 --> 01:41:22,901
If Santos wanted to pull a
robbery, he had his lawyers do it.

1162
01:41:22,931 --> 01:41:25,203
Yeah, I know the firm.

1163
01:41:27,644 --> 01:41:29,073
- Yes?
- Mr. Santos.

1164
01:41:29,103 --> 01:41:31,067
Send him in please.

1165
01:41:32,007 --> 01:41:35,443
I don't know how you fellows feel
about it but I'm glad he's interested.

1166
01:41:43,604 --> 01:41:47,300
- Mr. Santos, my name is Strager.
- Glad to meet you Strager.

1167
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:49,246
I want you to meet some of my friends.

1168
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:54,983
Mr. Brice Mr. Gillette,
Mr. Freeman Mr. McCoy.

1169
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,280
- Hi.
- Won't you sit down?

1170
01:41:58,647 --> 01:42:02,305
We were just talking, saying how
mighty happy we are to get your call.

1171
01:42:02,335 --> 01:42:03,699
It's our first ray of sunshine.

1172
01:42:03,729 --> 01:42:05,511
Don't worry, I'll get
your money back for you.

1173
01:42:05,541 --> 01:42:07,622
You heard that fellows, our trouble are over.

1174
01:42:07,947 --> 01:42:10,281
Mr. Santos doesn't make
a promise he can't keep.

1175
01:42:10,311 --> 01:42:12,066
- No doubt about it.
- Good deal.

1176
01:42:12,096 --> 01:42:16,756
- First time I relax today.
- How much is it going to cost us Mr. Santos?

1177
01:42:17,443 --> 01:42:20,425
Oh, let's say I wanted a third and...

1178
01:42:20,864 --> 01:42:23,168
you fellows beat me down to 30 percent.

1179
01:42:25,201 --> 01:42:26,225
Ok?

1180
01:42:26,786 --> 01:42:29,407
And if he doesn't deliver, he gets nothing.

1181
01:42:30,091 --> 01:42:31,697
- That right?
- Naturally.

1182
01:42:32,193 --> 01:42:36,987
Oh, I'll certainly go for that. Our insurance
won't even pay 20% of what we lost.

1183
01:42:37,355 --> 01:42:40,536
Neither ours, but that's
a whale of a finder's fee.

1184
01:42:41,193 --> 01:42:44,646
I'd say that all depends on
what the finder is looking for.

1185
01:42:45,847 --> 01:42:47,882
- Ok, I'll go along.
- Me too.

1186
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:49,004
So will I.

1187
01:42:50,059 --> 01:42:54,201
Alright, but how about taking
some of it in chips Mr. Santos?

1188
01:42:54,397 --> 01:42:56,304
We would like a chance to win it back.

1189
01:42:57,775 --> 01:42:59,030
Would you now?

1190
01:43:00,047 --> 01:43:01,979
Ok, you got it.

1191
01:43:05,158 --> 01:43:08,440
For 30 percent of what they took
out you joint, call it, heads or tails.

1192
01:43:12,123 --> 01:43:16,320
No, no thanks Mr. Santos. I got partners.

1193
01:43:16,637 --> 01:43:19,821
They wouldn't want me to make a
bet like that without consulting them.

1194
01:43:20,298 --> 01:43:21,823
So if you can put up, what do you do?

1195
01:43:22,311 --> 01:43:25,012
- Shut up and that's what I'm doing.
- Good.

1196
01:43:26,721 --> 01:43:30,169
I'll expect the cooperation
of the local sheriff.

1197
01:43:30,475 --> 01:43:33,740
- You'll arrange it for me?
- Consider it done.

1198
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:35,250
Mr. Santos...

1199
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,704
- may I ask a question?
- If it's the right one.

1200
01:43:41,194 --> 01:43:44,157
We know you're not getting
involved in this because of the dough.

1201
01:43:44,516 --> 01:43:46,123
What's your real reason?

1202
01:43:46,991 --> 01:43:48,687
Well Frankly I'll tell you.

1203
01:43:49,354 --> 01:43:52,704
Whoever pulled this job, he shouldn't
have done it while I was in town.

1204
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:54,909
It's embarrassing.

1205
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:59,319
- You call the sheriff for me?
- It will be taken care Duke.

1206
01:44:06,761 --> 01:44:09,093
- The report on Bergdorf.
- Who?

1207
01:44:09,123 --> 01:44:10,849
The dead man we brought in last night.

1208
01:44:12,767 --> 01:44:17,310
- The guy got a Silver Star, Purple Heart.
- Sheriff Mr. Strager on three.

1209
01:44:20,066 --> 01:44:23,498
- Yes Mr. Strager?
- We made a deal with Duke Santos...

1210
01:44:23,528 --> 01:44:26,417
- Duke Santos.
- We get our money back, I told you.

1211
01:44:26,447 --> 01:44:29,893
- Good, I'm very pleased for all of you.
- He's at the Riviera, talk to him.

1212
01:44:29,923 --> 01:44:32,560
Sure Mr. Strager.
Of course, I'll talk to him.

1213
01:44:35,165 --> 01:44:38,269
Locate the dead's man
wife, tell her about her husband.

1214
01:44:38,299 --> 01:44:39,825
Pump her, she may know something.

1215
01:44:39,855 --> 01:44:42,692
I'll be over to Riviera with Mr. Duke Santos.

1216
01:44:42,922 --> 01:44:45,953
- Call me if you find out anything.
- Ok skipper.

1217
01:44:56,936 --> 01:44:58,328
Come in.

1218
01:44:59,898 --> 01:45:02,585
- Hello?
- Mr. Ritsik doesn't answer.

1219
01:45:03,371 --> 01:45:05,183
Joe Ritsik don't answer?

1220
01:45:05,987 --> 01:45:08,809
Operator honey baby,
darling, you're wasting my time.

1221
01:45:09,032 --> 01:45:11,318
I don't want to know about
guys who don't answer.

1222
01:45:11,985 --> 01:45:16,583
Try the Terre Haute Cad Manny
Ruditski or Willy Henshaw in Detroit.

1223
01:45:17,053 --> 01:45:21,278
Yeah, he's listed, so is Fred
Cusik in Palm Beach. Try them all.

1224
01:45:21,283 --> 01:45:22,319
I'll do my best.

1225
01:45:22,545 --> 01:45:24,772
Thattagirl, now get me
some numbers that answer, will you?

1226
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:31,100
- Mr. Santos, I'm sheriff Wimmer.
- Nice of you to drop by so soon sheriff.

1227
01:45:31,669 --> 01:45:32,304
Sit down.

1228
01:45:33,264 --> 01:45:36,712
I guess you understand
my position Mr. Santos.

1229
01:45:36,935 --> 01:45:39,052
We're all grateful for your cooperation...

1230
01:45:39,053 --> 01:45:41,253
but I want to warm
you, don't cut out on your own.

1231
01:45:41,294 --> 01:45:43,944
Whatever I get goes straight
to you, I'm a great collaborator.

1232
01:45:44,547 --> 01:45:46,619
- So what's new on your end?
- Not a clue.

1233
01:45:46,649 --> 01:45:49,433
We had a net over the highway
3 minutes after we got the alarm.

1234
01:45:49,656 --> 01:45:51,609
If that mob got out it was only by seconds.

1235
01:45:52,492 --> 01:45:55,934
So they made it by seconds it
don't count? They get disqualified?

1236
01:45:57,288 --> 01:45:59,572
Only shows they're
a highly professional outfit.

1237
01:45:59,602 --> 01:46:02,226
- Is there another kind?
- Now look mister Santos...

1238
01:46:02,256 --> 01:46:04,710
Alright alright Sheriff,
don't get your feathers ruffled.

1239
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:08,201
Mr. Strager says your sources
can check any outfit in the country.

1240
01:46:08,231 --> 01:46:09,973
You bet your boots they can.

1241
01:46:15,081 --> 01:46:16,373
- Hello?
- Duke is Manny.

1242
01:46:16,599 --> 01:46:20,331
- Yeah Manny, what you hear?
- Nothing, nobody got a smell.

1243
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,214
Nothing? Not a smell?

1244
01:46:24,781 --> 01:46:28,088
What's this nothing gotten? You
keep nosing around till you do get a smell.

1245
01:46:35,243 --> 01:46:39,374
Takes time, you know how it is.
You got to give it a little time.

1246
01:46:41,833 --> 01:46:43,387
- Hello.
- Sheriff Wimmer please.

1247
01:46:43,792 --> 01:46:46,803
- Just a second. It's for you sheriff.
- Thanks.

1248
01:46:47,589 --> 01:46:48,774
- Hello.
- This is Joe.

1249
01:46:48,775 --> 01:46:50,415
- Yeah Joe.
- I talked to Bergdorf wife.

1250
01:46:50,445 --> 01:46:52,979
- Good, does she know anything?
- She hasn't seen him.

1251
01:46:53,392 --> 01:46:56,922
She hasn't seen him? Not
the whole time he was in prison?

1252
01:46:57,265 --> 01:46:58,956
But she's coming
to claim the body, isn't she?

1253
01:46:58,986 --> 01:47:00,778
- Yes, she's claiming it.
- Good.

1254
01:47:01,478 --> 01:47:03,810
Yeah, she can take it back to San Francisco.

1255
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:07,515
Turn him over to Cohen's Mortuary.
They'll ship him out for here, good bye.

1256
01:47:09,354 --> 01:47:10,462
What was that about all about?

1257
01:47:10,611 --> 01:47:13,178
Old guy drop dead last
night, right in front of this hotel.

1258
01:47:13,281 --> 01:47:17,694
Quite a hero. Purple Heart,
Silver Star, served with the 82nd Airborne.

1259
01:47:19,162 --> 01:47:20,844
Say with the 82nd Airborne?

1260
01:47:21,011 --> 01:47:25,197
Yeah, served in San Quentin too.
Well, I got to get back to the office.

1261
01:47:25,227 --> 01:47:27,650
So long Mr. Santos, keep in touch.

1262
01:47:28,272 --> 01:47:29,787
And is it vice versa sheriff?

1263
01:47:30,548 --> 01:47:32,535
Now that we understand each other, certainly.

1264
01:47:34,385 --> 01:47:36,722
So long sheriff, you'll hear from me.

1265
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,804
- Hello.
- Mr. Henshaw is not expected soon.

1266
01:47:40,834 --> 01:47:43,352
Well, never mind
operator, Ill call him later.

1267
01:47:43,611 --> 01:47:47,202
Oh, don't make any more of
them calls for about an hour.

1268
01:47:56,777 --> 01:47:57,802
Mr. Cohen?

1269
01:47:58,451 --> 01:48:02,621
No, I'm Mr. Kelly Mr. Cohen
is my associate, he's occupied.

1270
01:48:02,831 --> 01:48:07,731
- May I be of some service to you?
- The sheriff had sent over a body?

1271
01:48:08,142 --> 01:48:13,021
Yes, a Mr. Bergdorf, must've
been a fine looking fellow in life.

1272
01:48:14,551 --> 01:48:16,998
With the compliments of Mr. Jack Strager.

1273
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:20,247
I'm helping him with the
investigation of last night's robbery.

1274
01:48:20,473 --> 01:48:22,328
- A shocking thing.
- Yeah.

1275
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,657
Well anyway, if somebody
shows an interest in the late...

1276
01:48:24,687 --> 01:48:27,194
Bergdorf Jack want that
you should call me right away.

1277
01:48:27,397 --> 01:48:29,844
My name is Duke Santos. I'm at the Riviera.

1278
01:48:29,993 --> 01:48:33,340
And you can tell Mr. Strager
he can depend on us Mr. Santos.

1279
01:48:33,471 --> 01:48:39,881
He said he could, yeah. And Mr. Kelly please,
not a word about this to anyone, eh?

1280
01:48:41,452 --> 01:48:43,307
Not even to Mr. Cohen.

1281
01:48:46,255 --> 01:48:49,918
But Fred it can't be a job this big is pulled
and nobody in the world knows who did it?

1282
01:48:49,948 --> 01:48:52,783
It's what we got, but we're digging so far.

1283
01:48:52,813 --> 01:48:55,448
- There ain't a single break?
- Not a break, nothing.

1284
01:48:55,478 --> 01:48:56,849
Ok Fred, keep listening.

1285
01:49:03,183 --> 01:49:05,061
- Hi honey.
- Hello darling.

1286
01:49:06,019 --> 01:49:10,047
Excuse me messing in, but this is
the first opportunity I've had.

1287
01:49:13,318 --> 01:49:16,174
Hello operator, get me the Flamingo please.

1288
01:49:16,446 --> 01:49:20,048
I had a date with Adele but as usual she
was late, poor Duke you must be starved.

1289
01:49:20,078 --> 01:49:22,768
I got other problems besides
food, I can't have lunch with you.

1290
01:49:22,798 --> 01:49:24,740
Oh, but darling I
asked some friends to join us.

1291
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:26,019
Well, that's great, you won't be lonesome.

1292
01:49:26,049 --> 01:49:29,438
Look, make it quick, will you? I got a
lot of important calls coming through.

1293
01:49:30,314 --> 01:49:33,906
Hello Flamingo? I'd like to
speak to Mr. James Foster please.

1294
01:49:34,797 --> 01:49:35,867
Who did you say?

1295
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:39,538
Oh, didn't I tell you? Jimmy is at the
Flamingo, he didn't go to Squaw valley.

1296
01:49:39,761 --> 01:49:43,384
Operator, if his room doesn't
answer please have him paged.

1297
01:49:43,897 --> 01:49:47,609
Wouldn't you think he'd call his own
mother? He knows very well I'm here.

1298
01:49:47,849 --> 01:49:50,398
Wait he hits the crap
tables, you'll hear from him.

1299
01:49:50,603 --> 01:49:53,597
Yeah, the only time he give a
thought is when he needs something.

1300
01:49:53,973 --> 01:49:57,845
Oh, what he see in that vulgar little Danny
Ocean and all those other Army cronies?

1301
01:49:58,071 --> 01:50:00,133
They hold more meetings
than the American Legion.

1302
01:50:00,163 --> 01:50:02,728
- I'm paging him.
- Yes operator, I'll wait.

1303
01:50:02,951 --> 01:50:06,900
They having a meeting here? Then why
he say he was going to Squaw valley?

1304
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:09,611
I don't know but Adele told
me he was here and and...

1305
01:50:09,641 --> 01:50:12,793
Ocean is with him and Heaven
knows how many other ex-Army pals.

1306
01:50:13,711 --> 01:50:18,785
Foster, Ocean and Bergdorf All 82nd Airborne.

1307
01:50:18,815 --> 01:50:20,919
Yeah, I wonder what they doing here.

1308
01:50:20,949 --> 01:50:23,900
Maybe it's the anniversary
of one of their commando raids.

1309
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:27,968
The Little Scorpions.
Very well, it's all very mysterious.

1310
01:50:28,977 --> 01:50:31,851
- Hey, what you doing?
- Not any longer it ain't mysterious.

1311
01:50:32,312 --> 01:50:33,920
- Hello operator?
- Yes sir?

1312
01:50:34,143 --> 01:50:37,555
Cancel all the calls I put in.
Yeah, cancel them all.

1313
01:50:41,910 --> 01:50:46,181
No wonder I couldn't find out nothing.
A work of art, a real work of art.

1314
01:50:46,411 --> 01:50:49,384
- But darling, what you so excited about?
- This honey.

1315
01:50:49,414 --> 01:50:51,144
- The robbery?
- Yeah.

1316
01:50:52,292 --> 01:50:54,656
Duke, don't tell me you
had anything to do with this?

1317
01:50:54,686 --> 01:50:58,443
No, no, relax sweetheart, I'm clean.
But I know who pulled that job.

1318
01:50:58,673 --> 01:50:59,902
- You do?
- Yeah.

1319
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,560
- But shouldn't you tell the police?
- Oh, no.

1320
01:51:03,107 --> 01:51:06,751
And you want to know why not?
Because I love you too much.

1321
01:51:07,633 --> 01:51:09,806
May I learn what's so amusing?

1322
01:51:10,524 --> 01:51:12,509
Your Jimmy, your innocent.

1323
01:51:14,522 --> 01:51:16,666
Oh, I knew he had guts the minute I met him.

1324
01:51:17,025 --> 01:51:17,898
Please, Duke.

1325
01:51:18,193 --> 01:51:22,176
Sweetheart, this job was cooked
up by Jimmy and his soldier boy pals.

1326
01:51:22,447 --> 01:51:25,842
Oh but, but that's ridiculous Jimmy
has all the money he could spend.

1327
01:51:25,872 --> 01:51:27,422
Why, why would he rob anyone?

1328
01:51:27,452 --> 01:51:29,978
Hitler had Europe.
Why did he want Russia too?

1329
01:51:30,008 --> 01:51:34,095
Oh, you can't compare my Jimmy with that
monster, why, he actually fought Hitler.

1330
01:51:34,125 --> 01:51:36,157
He and his paratroopers overran Germany.

1331
01:51:36,187 --> 01:51:40,362
Yeah, but last night him and his
paratroopers overrun a hunk at Las Vegas.

1332
01:51:41,424 --> 01:51:45,267
Oh, it's a real shame that boy wasn't born
poor, what a career he could've had.

1333
01:51:45,925 --> 01:51:49,027
- I think you're serious.
- That's right honey, they hijacked the town.

1334
01:51:49,057 --> 01:51:53,461
Jimmy and his little paratroopers, well,
this won't take long. I'll see you at lunch.

1335
01:51:54,145 --> 01:51:57,626
- Want some lunch?
- No, you go ahead, I may not eat for weeks.

1336
01:52:04,906 --> 01:52:08,888
Hello Danny. Hey, nice room you got here.

1337
01:52:11,218 --> 01:52:14,270
- I don't think I know your friend.
- You don't know me either.

1338
01:52:14,467 --> 01:52:17,629
Sure I do, I'm a pal of Jimmy Foster's.

1339
01:52:17,919 --> 01:52:19,801
I know some of your other buddies too.

1340
01:52:20,630 --> 01:52:23,965
Like Tony Bergdorf.

1341
01:52:24,843 --> 01:52:26,733
Poor Tony died, you know.

1342
01:52:27,178 --> 01:52:31,064
It's too bad, his wife is
coming over to claim his body.

1343
01:52:31,808 --> 01:52:34,674
Yeah Tony is going home in a pine box.

1344
01:52:36,688 --> 01:52:40,887
Yes, a beautiful job you
boys pulled, a real work of art.

1345
01:52:42,737 --> 01:52:46,347
- You a cop?
- Me? Duke Santos, a cop?

1346
01:52:48,224 --> 01:52:52,516
I only wish I was in on it with you.
Oh, I envy you, your youth.

1347
01:52:53,978 --> 01:52:56,626
You're not get any younger
hanging around here, what do you want?

1348
01:52:57,303 --> 01:53:00,410
If you guys had been pros,
I had put you out of business.

1349
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:05,322
But new talent needs
encouraging, I want half.

1350
01:53:07,833 --> 01:53:11,465
- Half of what?
- You tell me, you got the money.

1351
01:53:13,683 --> 01:53:16,005
You talking on a dead phone Charlie.

1352
01:53:16,227 --> 01:53:18,992
Well, suit yourself, there's a
live one at the sheriff's office.

1353
01:53:19,522 --> 01:53:20,717
So you are a cop?

1354
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:24,998
No, I made a deal with the casino
owners to get their money back for them.

1355
01:53:27,238 --> 01:53:29,122
And now you're ready to double cross them?

1356
01:53:29,319 --> 01:53:31,628
Well, they only going to pay me 30 percent.

1357
01:53:32,518 --> 01:53:33,780
You're going to give me 50.

1358
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:37,364
- Playing both ends from the middle.
- Sure, I can't lose.

1359
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:39,640
You've already lost.

1360
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:44,487
- The money is sent out of town, long gone.
- If you're here, the money is here.

1361
01:53:46,697 --> 01:53:49,282
We couldn't make a deal with you if
we wanted to too many people involved.

1362
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,559
So talk to them.

1363
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:56,007
That's to take a little time.

1364
01:53:58,162 --> 01:53:59,639
I'll give you till tomorrow.

1365
01:54:01,006 --> 01:54:02,822
I know you won't try anything cute.

1366
01:54:03,733 --> 01:54:06,411
50% of something is
better than 100% of nothing.

1367
01:54:07,259 --> 01:54:09,163
One o'clock tomorrow, here.

1368
01:54:10,448 --> 01:54:11,427
By-bye.

1369
01:54:14,786 --> 01:54:15,858
Hold it.

1370
01:54:19,749 --> 01:54:21,980
What's your relationship to Jimmy Foster?

1371
01:54:23,169 --> 01:54:24,699
I'm going to marry his mama.

1372
01:54:28,466 --> 01:54:32,302
Tell me? Jimmy sold us out.
Your best friend sold us out.

1373
01:54:35,344 --> 01:54:38,921
You believe that? You want
the facts tattooed on your nose?

1374
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:42,796
I'll admit I don't like Foster, much that
now we found out he's turned canary.

1375
01:54:42,826 --> 01:54:45,627
You got to stand up for the slob.
You always have to be different.

1376
01:54:45,769 --> 01:54:48,734
- Always on the opposite side.
- And you always have to jump to conclusions.

1377
01:54:48,764 --> 01:54:51,294
What do you think the others are
going to be jumping to when they find?

1378
01:54:51,305 --> 01:54:54,861
Just a minute, let me ask you one question.
Does Jimmy know where we hid the money?

1379
01:54:54,862 --> 01:54:55,762
You know it.

1380
01:54:55,767 --> 01:54:58,816
Eh? Then why he isn't tell Santos about and
go out and pick it up and split it with him?

1381
01:54:59,905 --> 01:55:00,707
Eh?

1382
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:07,736
- Go ahead, right on the chin.
- Yeah, forget about it.

1383
01:55:08,173 --> 01:55:10,779
I've been making a couple of mistakes myself.

1384
01:55:13,636 --> 01:55:16,409
Oh Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy.

1385
01:55:18,725 --> 01:55:22,028
Oh, mother what is it? I
came as quickly as I could, you ill?

1386
01:55:22,058 --> 01:55:24,508
You fool, you complete utter ass.

1387
01:55:24,538 --> 01:55:28,023
- Oh, that's good, you're not ill.
- I could slap you face roar.

1388
01:55:28,156 --> 01:55:29,884
Oh, what is it? Mother's Day? I forget?

1389
01:55:30,071 --> 01:55:34,464
You dare to be sarcastic after what
you've done? No, it's not mother's day.

1390
01:55:34,908 --> 01:55:36,840
But how you plan to celebrate Mother's Day?

1391
01:55:37,015 --> 01:55:39,454
Perhaps you and you're
kin soldiers will rob Fort Knox?

1392
01:55:39,484 --> 01:55:40,157
What's that?

1393
01:55:40,187 --> 01:55:42,324
Well, after stealing
all the money in Las Vegas...

1394
01:55:42,354 --> 01:55:44,542
that's the next logical step for a maniac.

1395
01:55:44,572 --> 01:55:46,281
- But how in the...
- Amazed, aren't you?

1396
01:55:46,456 --> 01:55:49,662
You probably thought you
had committed the perfect crime.

1397
01:55:50,362 --> 01:55:54,566
- You moron, I could die.
- Mother, who's been talking to you?

1398
01:55:54,596 --> 01:55:57,434
- Duke, he knows all about it.
- But that's impossible.

1399
01:55:58,556 --> 01:56:00,815
I mean, why would
you believe what Santos says?

1400
01:56:00,954 --> 01:56:03,907
Because you're an
amateur thief, he's a professional.

1401
01:56:04,349 --> 01:56:06,613
Oh please, don't try to lie.
Your face gives you away.

1402
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:10,394
- Even as a liar, you're an amateur.
- Where's Santos now?

1403
01:56:10,610 --> 01:56:13,096
He's going to see your confederates
to take the money away from them.

1404
01:56:14,189 --> 01:56:16,279
Now he's going to get mixed up in this too.

1405
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:20,830
Oh Jimmy Jimmy, how
could you treat me this way?

1406
01:56:36,928 --> 01:56:39,135
I think now is a nice time to tell him.

1407
01:56:41,766 --> 01:56:46,124
I owe an apologize, I thought for
a minute you blew the whistle on us.

1408
01:56:46,322 --> 01:56:48,980
But Clarence Darrow
here, he proved otherwise.

1409
01:56:51,109 --> 01:56:53,411
What do we do now that Santos knows?

1410
01:56:54,789 --> 01:56:58,072
Wish I knew, I just don't know where to
bind and we haven't got much time left.

1411
01:57:00,118 --> 01:57:01,245
I got an idea.

1412
01:57:06,457 --> 01:57:10,425
Come on, I'll paint you a picture on
the way out. Come on Clarence.

1413
01:57:31,609 --> 01:57:32,780
What's so funny?

1414
01:57:33,349 --> 01:57:36,387
I knew this color would
come in handy one day.

1415
01:57:37,287 --> 01:57:39,143
- Oh, Josh.
- Yeah?

1416
01:57:39,365 --> 01:57:42,188
- How you get this stuff off?
- What I usually...

1417
01:58:52,814 --> 01:58:55,370
Hold it, you count it
when it get to San Francisco.

1418
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:58,275
It's for Tony's widow and
he's kid, it's only 10 grand Danny.

1419
01:58:58,305 --> 01:59:00,490
Good boy Josh,
I should've thought of that myself.

1420
01:59:50,622 --> 01:59:55,245
- Operation Pine Box.
- Danny? The widow just arrived.

1421
01:59:55,543 --> 01:59:58,490
I figure she'll ship the body
to San Francisco on the 11:40.

1422
01:59:58,713 --> 02:00:01,319
It's the only train today, they
got plenty of time, over an hour.

1423
02:00:01,809 --> 02:00:03,844
Ok, you stay with her.
We'll phone the others.

1424
02:00:07,847 --> 02:00:11,130
- Operator?
- Operator, get me Dudley 26969.

1425
02:00:23,033 --> 02:00:24,724
- Vince Massler.
- Vince...

1426
02:00:25,792 --> 02:00:27,914
watch the 11:40 Tony may go out on it.

1427
02:00:30,174 --> 02:00:32,078
Mr. Santos will get his.

1428
02:00:35,917 --> 02:00:38,499
Sorry to keep you
waiting ma'am, I'm Mr. Cohen.

1429
02:00:38,529 --> 02:00:39,626
How do you do?

1430
02:00:39,768 --> 02:00:43,311
I came to make arrangements to ship my
husband's body back to San Francisco.

1431
02:00:43,465 --> 02:00:46,211
Oh yes Mrs. Bergdorf, may I?

1432
02:00:46,627 --> 02:00:50,368
May I ask Mrs. Bergdorf,
in my professional capacity...

1433
02:00:50,730 --> 02:00:53,016
are you a woman of means?

1434
02:00:53,968 --> 02:00:55,138
Oh, no.

1435
02:00:56,199 --> 02:01:00,789
No, my husband, my
late husband left me $10,000.

1436
02:01:01,317 --> 02:01:03,092
I received it this morning.

1437
02:01:03,736 --> 02:01:07,040
But that's all I have and I'd like to
keep that for my son's education.

1438
02:01:07,448 --> 02:01:08,893
I understand, now...

1439
02:01:09,868 --> 02:01:13,626
- if I may make a suggestion Mrs. Bergdorf?
- Of course.

1440
02:01:14,086 --> 02:01:18,419
The services in Las Vegas are no
different from the same rites San Francisco.

1441
02:01:18,751 --> 02:01:20,500
Your late husband was a war hero.

1442
02:01:20,915 --> 02:01:23,333
And we have a chapter
of the American Legion here.

1443
02:01:23,464 --> 02:01:26,211
The legionnaires will be
happy to serve as pallbearers.

1444
02:01:27,927 --> 02:01:31,331
Why waste money on needless transportation?

1445
02:01:32,390 --> 02:01:36,320
- Well, I guess you right Mr. Cohen.
- Good, good.

1446
02:02:01,503 --> 02:02:03,114
- Danny?
- Yeah Corneal?

1447
02:02:03,144 --> 02:02:06,065
Something is going on in
there, but I don't know just what.

1448
02:02:06,341 --> 02:02:09,743
- You mean the box hasn't left yet?
- No and I don't think it's going to.

1449
02:02:09,969 --> 02:02:13,192
- Why not?
- A bunch of legionnaires just showed up.

1450
02:02:13,348 --> 02:02:15,374
Must be they're going to attend the services.

1451
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:18,481
So looks like the widow is
going tot Tony here in Vegas.

1452
02:02:20,688 --> 02:02:24,261
Ok, you wait right there.
'll round up the boys, we'll be over.

1453
02:03:14,367 --> 02:03:17,666
- Hello, who is it?
- Kelly of Kelly and Cohen Morticians.

1454
02:03:17,837 --> 02:03:22,570
You asked me to call you if something unusual
happened in regards of out client Bergdorf.

1455
02:03:23,153 --> 02:03:24,689
Bergdorf? Yeah, go ahead.

1456
02:03:24,919 --> 02:03:29,294
Well, about a dozen men arrived to attend
the services which are being held in our...

1457
02:03:29,324 --> 02:03:33,781
beautiful chapel which serves
all denominations, faiths and creeds.

1458
02:03:33,811 --> 02:03:35,623
Yeah, yeah, skip the commercial, will you?

1459
02:03:35,972 --> 02:03:38,669
These men don't look like the usual mourners.

1460
02:03:39,434 --> 02:03:41,209
Mr. Santos is something else.

1461
02:03:41,436 --> 02:03:45,635
I made a discovery in the
waiting chapel that's most unusual.

1462
02:03:45,857 --> 02:03:47,554
I could call it incredible.

1463
02:03:48,234 --> 02:03:51,557
Mr. Santos, I will call it incredible.

1464
02:03:52,005 --> 02:03:57,146
- What is it?
- A money band, a $10,000 money band.

1465
02:03:57,176 --> 02:04:00,896
Which lying by the coffin and it
certainly wasn't there last night.

1466
02:04:01,873 --> 02:04:04,706
- By the coffin, eh?
- Right beside it.

1467
02:04:04,876 --> 02:04:07,523
I, I hardly know what to think.

1468
02:04:08,087 --> 02:04:10,244
I do. I'll be right over.

1469
02:04:10,945 --> 02:04:14,484
How do you like that? A dead
delivery boy, cony characters.

1470
02:04:15,553 --> 02:04:19,110
We are gathered together
today to pay honor and tribute...

1471
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:22,228
to the memory of Anthony Raymond Bergdorf.

1472
02:04:23,184 --> 02:04:28,466
At such a time as we all together fitting
that we recall the psalm of David.

1473
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:33,047
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

1474
02:04:33,822 --> 02:04:36,724
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

1475
02:04:37,534 --> 02:04:39,869
He leadeth me besides still waters.

1476
02:04:40,673 --> 02:04:42,758
He restoreth my soul.

1477
02:04:43,873 --> 02:04:47,972
He guideth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name is sake.

1478
02:04:49,337 --> 02:04:53,160
Yeh, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1479
02:04:53,373 --> 02:04:57,475
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

1480
02:04:57,804 --> 02:05:00,501
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1481
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:06,210
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

1482
02:05:06,687 --> 02:05:11,880
Thou anointest my head
with oil, my cup runneth over.

1483
02:05:12,152 --> 02:05:15,304
Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow me all...

1484
02:05:15,713 --> 02:05:19,129
- What's that noise?
- What's that noise?

1485
02:05:19,159 --> 02:05:23,277
- The Lord forever.
- What's that noise?

1486
02:05:24,867 --> 02:05:27,243
The deceased is being cremated.

1487
02:05:27,695 --> 02:05:32,379
Verily, verily, the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

1488
02:05:32,893 --> 02:05:38,859
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1489
02:05:40,013 --> 02:05:44,370
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection unto eternal life.

1490
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,884
The Lord lift up His face upon you...

1491
02:05:47,914 --> 02:05:52,106
and give you peace, this day and always.

1492
02:05:52,893 --> 02:05:54,311
Amen.
