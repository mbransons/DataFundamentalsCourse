Thank you, Miss Langford.

35
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,364
Ladies and gentlemen, you have just
heard Miss Frances Langford singing:

36
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,764
"You Are My Lucky Star" from
the forthcoming musical production...

37
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,427
<i>...Broadway Rhythm.</i>

38
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,439
And now the Apex Brush Company again
brings to you that cracked columnist...

39
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,512
...of the New <i>York World Tribune,</i>
Bert Keeler, the voice of Broadway.

40
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,581
Giving you the inside dope
on what's what among the who's who.

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,651
- Take it, Bert.
- Good evening, you little scandal lovers.

42
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,220
This is Bert Keeler speaking,
the voice of Broadway.

43
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,857
Coming to you with all the late
indoor-sport results.

44
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,150
And am I hot tonight.

45
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,627
Flash. New York, New York.

46
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,823
The Park Avenue Bradley Masons
are anticipating a blessed event.

47
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,092
It's a boy at the William Tuckers.

48
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,135
Flash. Two dozen safety pins were ordered
this morning by the Howard Van Pelts.

49
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,669
Washington, D.C.

50
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,036
There's a rumor that Congress,
to help balance the national budget...

51
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,007
...will put a tax on all divorces.

52
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,078
Are you listening, Reno? Heh, heh.

53
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,409
Imagine all those lawyers
going back to work.

54
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,132
<i>It's good? Flush.</i>

55
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,519
<i>Or flash: It's quintuplets at the
Tenth Avenue Angelo Pasquales.</i>

56
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,485
<i>This is their 16th blessed event.</i>

57
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,784
<i>Hmm, the stork must be using
the spare room.</i>

58
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,519
<i>Crash. It's a 72-pound boy at the home
of the Leslie, Park Avenue, Rockfords.</i>

59
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,323
<i>Flash: The stork left
by aeroplane at midnight...</i>

60
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,867
<i>...for the home of the Sidney O'Hares
in Baltimore-Happy landing.</i>

61
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:08,739
Boy. Call Bert Keeler. Tell him to see me
as soon as he finishes his broadcast.

62
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,434
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,847
- Hi, chief. How'd you like the broadcast?
- Rotten.

64
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,853
Can't you write or talk about anything
else except who's gonna have a baby?

65
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,151
Why, chief, don't you like my baby talk?

66
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,158
No. Your column reads like
a clinical report.

67
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,730
Listen to this, "The stork is flying
high over the Conrad Barnums.

68
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,128
A bundle of joy
from heaven at the Bartons.

69
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,236
A blessed event threatens
the Campbells." It's old stuff.

70
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,701
But the public loves babies.

71
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,240
So do I, but I'm running a newspaper,
not a birth forecast.

72
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,107
Don't you think it gives my column
a homey feeling, sort of a domestic touch?

73
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,543
That's not Broadway.
Now get this, Keeler.

74
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,447
I want the stuff you get looking over
transoms and peeking through keyholes.

75
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,919
You can't get stuff through keyholes.
Sometimes the people aren't home.

76
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,319
Then you find out where they went and why.

77
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,691
Suppose I find them
and they're doing nothing wrong?

78
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,627
People are always doing something
wrong for a good reporter.

79
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,926
I see. You want the kind of stuff
that'll get me a sock in the nose.

80
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,468
That's right. And you won't be
making good until people hate you.

81
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,629
I want everybody in this
town looking for your scalp.

82
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,798
Mmm, nice journalistic future I have.

83
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:19,913
Don't worry. The minute I hear people
calling you a rat, I'll raise your salary.

84
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,243
All right, I'll be so big a rat
you can put a saddle on me.

85
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,044
Give that stork a rest.
Put your nose to the ground...

86
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,654
...and dig up some news that's hot,
and remember:

87
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,917
One more blessed event in your column
and you're through.

88
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:36,654
Okay, chief. The only births I'll mention
from now on will be on Pullmans.

89
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,323
Bert, who do you think is gonna
have a baby?

90
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,592
- Who?
- My mother.

91
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:45,636
- From now on nobody's gonna have babies.
- You can't stop my mother...

92
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,604
- ...from having a baby.
- I can stop it from having it in my column.

93
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,439
What I'm driving at is we gotta stop
watching the stork and pay attention...

94
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,205
- ...to keyholes and transoms.
- Why?

95
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,749
Because I'll lose my job.
And if I lose my job I've got to let you go.

96
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,317
- Why?
- Why?

97
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,353
Because when I'm out of work,
I don't need an assistant.

98
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,149
Oh.

99
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,620
I gotta get the lowdown
on something important.

100
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,421
- Well, ain't babies important?
- The boss don't think so.

101
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,260
We gotta dig up some dirt. What banker
was seen with what chorus girl.

102
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,424
Does it have to be a banker
or a chorus girl?

103
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,300
No, but it's gotta be somebody important
who's doing something he shouldn't do.

104
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,212
Hey, looks like there's
something hot going on down there.

105
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,295
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

106
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,200
It's Bob Gordon, the guy who's
producing <i>Broadway Rhythm.</i>

107
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,605
- He's talking to a dame.
- Who is she?

108
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,211
I think it's Lillian Brent.

109
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,778
- Lillian Brent?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,383
Say, she's got more dough
than you and I will ever have.

111
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,777
I'd like to help you out.

112
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,943
Investing money in a show
is risky business.

113
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,112
- I wouldn't advise it.
- I like taking chances.

114
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,157
- I'd get a kick out of it.
- I can't let you do it, Lillian.

115
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,124
- Don't you believe in your show?
- I do.

116
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,095
- It's the best thing I've ever written.
- That's good enough for me.

117
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,065
Look...

118
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,201
...who told you that I needed money?

119
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,736
What's the difference?

120
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,535
Well, I just didn't want you to think
I'd take advantage of our friendship.

121
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,973
You haven't.
You had nothing to do with it.

122
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:35,740
I like the idea of putting money
into your show and I'm going to do it.

123
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,041
But...

124
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,983
...we don't have to be too brutally
businesslike about it, do we?

125
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,747
It's a business proposition.

126
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,525
- Won't there be anything personal in it?
- Mm-hm.

127
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,128
- What?
- Your personal check.

128
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,320
Oh, Bob.

129
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,631
I know the show's gonna be a great
success and I want it to be, for your sake.

130
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,105
But, darling, please don't
become so interested in it...

131
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,209
...that you'll forget all about me?

132
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,205

- Snooper, do you know what this means?
- What?

181
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,606
Anytime a wealthy Park Avenue widow
gets chummy with a Broadway guy...

182
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,371
...the public wants to know why.

183
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,640
- Why, is that wrong?
- Not at all.

184
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,284
But one of them's got something
the other one wants.

185
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,818
It's the same in the Bronx.

186
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,569
- See Mr. Newcombe.
- Thank you.

187
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:19,108
- Is this Robert Gordon's office of Albany?
- What's that?

188
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,152
I say, is this Robert Gordon
of Albany's office?

189
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,847
Albany office? No, no. New York office.

190
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,282
Yes, I know. But what I mean is...

191
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,486
...is this Robert Gordon's office
in New York of Albany?

192
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,687
See if this is it.

193
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,357
You wanna know if this is Albany's
office of Robert Gordon's New Yor...

194
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,559
Now you got me doing it.

195
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,737
Don't go away.
I'll unravel you in a minute.

196
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,404
Hello? No, sorry, he isn't in.

197
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,404
Now then, let's start from scratch.

198
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,877
- Just who did you want to see?
- Bob.

199
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,042
Bob? You mean Mr. Gordon?

200
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,548
Yes.

201
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,686
- What's your name?
- Irene Foster.

202
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,948
- Of Albany.
- Why, yes.

203
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,284
How did you know?

204
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,051
- I'm psychic.
- Really?

205
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,320
- You know, Bob's from Albany too.
- Is that so?

206
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,930
We haven't seen each other
since he left high school.

207
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,292
For heaven's sake.

208
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,400
We were sort of...

209
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,396
- You know what I mean.
- Oh, you weren't.

210
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,836
Mm-hm. See this?
It's his school fraternity pin.

211
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,068
- Hmm.
- He gave it to me five years ago.

212
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,077
Gee, I'm dying to see him again.
Is he in?

213
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,772
Not yet. Have you an appointment?

214
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,816
Oh, no. I wanna surprise him.

215
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,851
He may not remember you after five years.

216
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,354
Oh, he'll remember me, all right,
especially this.

217
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,516
- What's that?
- We used to do that in school.

218
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,095
- You did that to each other?
- Uh-huh.

219
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,526
Why?

220
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,928
Well, because we were both born
in January.

221
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,069
Oh, I get it, the goat sign.

222
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,864
- A couple of goats.
- That's right.

223
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,666
Excuse me. I'm Bert Keeler
of the <i>World Tribune.</i>

224
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,277
- I'd like to see Bob Gordon.
- Oh, Mr. Gordon isn't in right now.

225
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,311
Well, maybe you can help me out.

226
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,744
You ought to know something about this.

227
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,545
Confidentially, who's banking
Gordon's show?

228
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,779
Mr. Gordon isn't in right now.

229
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,617
It's, uh... It's Lillian Brent, isn't it?

230
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,391
- Mr. Gordon isn't in right now.
- Mr. Gordon isn't in right now.

231
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,519
All right, I'll wait.

232
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:17,129
That's the eyes and ears of Broadway,
with his nose in everybody's business.

233
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,090
Hey, pardon me.

234
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,661
If you're asleep, you forgot
to close your eyes.

235
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,321
Oh, I'm not sleeping.

236
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:51,335
I'm just practicing my...
Rehearsing my specialty.

237
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,733
What specialty?

238
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:57,502
Well, I'm sort of an expert on snores.

239
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:01,944
I've been trying to see
Mr. Gordon for a month.

240
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,377
What about?

241
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,381
Snoring.

242
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,444
I want to get into his show.

243
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,644
Snoring?

244
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:09,913
Precisely.

245
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,750
Of all the human sound phenomena...

246
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,692
...perhaps the most inhuman...

247
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,763
...to other people are the snorers.

248
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,733
Well, I agree with you.
It is a very unpopular indoor sport.

249
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:30,968
In discussing the human snore,
or what we call in scientific terms...

250
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,578
...soft-palate calisthenics...

251
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:37,808
...I need scarcely point out
that the basic snore...

252
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:41,579
...is the common or Pullman car form.

253
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,188
Like this:

254
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,053
Just an ordinary snore.

255
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,758
Yeah, it would be silly to waste
a good snore in a Pullman.

256
00:18:55,935 --> 00:19:01,203
Snores are produced
by two movements of the breath...

257
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:06,403
...and so they may be classified
under two general headings...

258
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:10,913
...varied inspirational forms
and varied expirational forms.

259
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,109
We'll take up the latter first.

260
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,085
Go right ahead. It's very interesting.

261
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,553
All of these expirational forms
are dependent upon type one...

262
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:26,687
...which you've just heard,
for their inspirational element.

263
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,803
And so we have type 2-A...

264
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,929
...the labial or "ah-poo" variety.

265
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:44,049
You know, my... My grandmother
used to snore like that.

266
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:50,349
And 2-8 is the frictional
or non-lubricated form.

267
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,488
A little oil would help that one.

268
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:02,157
And 3-A is the sad or melancholy form.

269
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,207
Which often merges into 3-B...

270
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,508
...the conversational
or troubled-conscience variety.

271
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,925
I'm sorry, but I don't think my readers
would be interested in an organ recital.

272
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:33,191
But you haven't heard
the air-brake whistle snore...

273
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,756
- Hello, Gordon.
- Good morning.

274
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,369
Good morning, Mr. Gordon.

275
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,868
Good morning, Mr. Gordon.

276
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,674
Call the costumers and have them send
over the sketches for that ballet number.

277
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:50,544
Get in touch with Basil. I'd like to
start rehearsing as soon as possible.

278
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,983
Oh, yes. Yes, Mr. Gordon.

279
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,182
He just didn't recognize you.

280
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,754
I know he didn't.

281
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,585
Why didn't you give him this?

282
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,319
I forgot to.

283
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,692
Well, it... It's always best to write
for an appointment.

284
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,592
I guess you're right.

285
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:12,329
Ask Mr. Gordon if he'll see me.
I gotta get back to the office.

286
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,265
Bert Keeler of the <i>World Tribune</i>
wants to see you.

287
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,600
Yes, sir.

288
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,839
He said he saw you on the way in.

289
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,238
Yeah? Well, ask him how I looked.

290
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,612
No, wait. Tell him I want some news
on the show. This is publicity.

291
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,084
He wants some news on the show,
Mr. Gordon.

292
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,189
He said it's publicity.

293
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,950
Yes, sir, I'll tell him.

294
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,354
What did he say?

295
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,019
He said when he wants publicity
he'll hire a publicity man.

296
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,092
Mm-hm. Well, he won't need one.

297
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,566
This is one thing Lillian Brent won't have to
pay for. Tell him to read my column.

- Hello.

306
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,687
Oh, please go right ahead.

307
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,797
We were just working up
a little appetite for breakfast.

308
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,161
I didn't mean to interrupt, I'm sorry.

309
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,099
That's all right.
Come on over and join us.

310
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,931
Thanks.

311
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,832
This is my sister, Sally Burke.

312
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,204
- How do you do?
- Hello.

313
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,277
And my name is Theodore.

314
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,278
But just call me Ted.

315
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,974
- What's your name?
- Irene Foster.

316
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,381
That's a good name. For a girl.

317
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,521
- Have you had breakfast?
- Oh, yes.

318
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,384
Well, sit down and have some more.

319
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,787
I usually eat breakfast in the morning.

320
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,830
Well, we usually eat breakfast at noon,
it saves lunch. It's cheaper that way.

321
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,092
- You just moved here today, didn't you?
- Yes.

322
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,826
- Where you from?
- Albany.

323
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,026
Albany?

324
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,467
Hey, that's a swell town.

325
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,868
We played there once.

326
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,408
- Were we a panic in Albany.
- I'll say.

327
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,545
- What'd I do with those clippings?
- Ted?

328
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,011
Remind me to show you
those clippings. Terrific.

329
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,116
Oh, then you're in show business?

330
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,548
Yeah. What line are you in?

331
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,848
Well, I really came to New York
to see Robert Gordon.

332
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:54,015
- I thought he might give me a chance.
- Did you see him?

333
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,820
Yes, I saw him.

334
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,429
But he didn't remember me.

335
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,325
Was he, uh, supposed to?

336
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,728
Well, he should.
We went to school together.

337
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,200
Oh, I get it.
You're kind of that way over him, huh?

338
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,362
Well, kind of.

339
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,031
You're going back to see
Mr. Gordon again, aren't you?

340
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,610
- Never.
- Oh, you've got to.

341
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:13,970
Yeah, you got to.

342
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:17,241
Look, you can't let a little thing
like that upset you.

343
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,578
- Coffee?
- Thanks.

344
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:25,321
- Well, I really don't feel much like eating.
- Oh, trouble never upsets my appetite.

00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,184
Yes, sir.

376
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,988
Miss Corbett, where did this come from?

377
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:52,560
A girl left it. Said to give it to you.

378
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,165
A girl?

379
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,529
Mr. Gordon, are you from Albany?

380
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:57,931
Yes, I am. Why?

381
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,698
And did you use to do this
to a girl you went to school with?

382
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,277
Sure, I remember.

383
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,709
- Irene Foster.
- That's it.

384
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,609
- Where is she?
- She's gone.

385
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,840
Gone? Where did she go?

386
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,676
- I don't know.
- Where's she stopping?

387
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,855
- I don't know.
- Didn't you get her address?

388
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,287
- No.
- That's a fine way to conduct an office.

389
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,928
Find out where she lives.
Go on, get busy, find her.

390
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,654
And hurry it up.

391
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,229
- Is Bob Gordon in?
- Yes.

392
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,925
Thank you.

393
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,701
- Have you seen Bert Keeler's column?
- No. Why?

394
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,136
Well, listen to this:

395
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:40,142
Flash: Dan Cupid shoots a Park Avenue
arrow into the heart of Broadway.

396
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,804
Lillian Brent and Bob Gordon
are billing and cooing.

397
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,245
He's cooing until the billing
for his new show...

398
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,011
...is backed by cash in the bank."
How do you like that?

399
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,881
Wait a minute.

400
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:53,123
Get Bert Keeler on the phone
and tell him I want to see him.

401
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,953
Right away, Mr. Gordon.

402
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,095
How dare Bert print
such a thing in the paper.

403
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,323
That guy's been getting away
with murder lately by guessing lucky.

404
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:03,093
Somebody told him I was putting money
in the show.

405
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,758
- Did you?
- Don't look at me.

406
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,405
- I didn't crack to anybody.
- It won't happen again.

407
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,233
- But the damage is done.
- I'll say.

408
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,311
Oh, Mr. Gordon,
Mr. Keeler says if you wanna see him...

409
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,913
...you'll have to come to his office.

410
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,050
Oh, he did, did he?

411
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,707
All right, I'll do that.

412
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,182
Don't go, I'll be right back.

413
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,486
How do you like that? Ha!

414
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,524
Gordon wants me to come up to his office.

415
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:31,391
- He's a big guy in this town, isn't he?
- So am I.

416
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,624
The secret is to write
about big shots, not mingle with them.

417
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,633
I wonder if he'd be mad about that sock
you took at him.

418
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:41,103
Who cares? The more those guys burn,
the bigger I become.

419
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,208
Snoop, you know when a columnist
is sure he's a success?

420
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,276
- When?
- When the people he writes about...

421
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,380
...get sore and wanna see him.
Scully is right. Get them mad.

422
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,676
Make them tremble
when they pick up the paper.

423
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,717
- And that makes you a success, huh?
- That's right.

424
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,981
And furthermore, I'm doing a lot of good.

425
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,887
You may not realize it but I am.
People aren't likely...

426
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,153
- ...to go wrong for fear I'll print it.
- Yeah?

427
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,489
Yeah.

428
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,223
You know, Snoop.
I'm a reformer in a sense.

429
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,368
What sense?

430
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,401
Copy boy.

431
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,370
Copy boy.

432
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,072
Copy boy.

433
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,843
Copy boy.

434
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,526
Hello, Gordon.
How is the show coming along?

435
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,662
Glad to hear it. You know Snooper...

436
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,234
- ...my assistant that digs up the dirt for me?
- Not all of it.

437
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,531
Keeler, I want a retraction of that item.

438
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:49,766
You mean that, uh... That little boost
I gave you in today's column?

439
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:53,036
I mean this cheap attack
you made against a friend of mine.

440
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,236
Why, Bob, that's publicity.

441
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,712
I usually get something
for that kind of stuff.

442
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,146
That's okay with me.

443
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,580
All right, Keeler, put that in your column.

444
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,520
Listen, when you hit him,
you gotta hit me too.

445
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,528
- Hey, Snoop.
- Yeah?

446
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,603
Remind me to ask for a raise tomorrow.

447
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,715
- Give me a napkin, will you?
- What's the matter with you?

448
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:38,823
- Don't you know how to dunk a doughnut?
- Sure, I just lost control, that's all.

449
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,789
- Look, what do you think that hole is for?
- Ventilation.

450
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,952
No, you're thinking of the holes
in cheese. It's for your thumb.

451
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,155
- Now, look, you put your thumb here...
- Yeah.

452
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,962
...your forefinger here and you do this.

453
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,407
I gotta run down to the office.

454
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,441
- If you hear any news give me a buzz.
- You forgot your check.

455
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,078
Yeah.

456
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,274
Uh, excuse me, that was Bert Keeler
sitting here, wasn't it?

457
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,645
Yeah, why?

458
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,311
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Sure, Keeler and I are like that:

459
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,014
This is me on the bottom.

460
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,386
- He could do me a big favor, if he would.
- Yeah?

461
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,727
- Your order, please?
- Coffee and doughnut.

462
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,924
What about a favor Keeler could do you?

463
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:22,158
Well, the girl my boss is looking for
reads his column.

464
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,826
- Who's your boss?
- Robert Gordon. Do you know him?

465
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,994
- Oh, yes, <i>we've</i> met.
- Good.

466
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:31,006
- And who's the girl?
- Irene Foster and I've got to locate her.

467
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:35,044
Listen, Keeler's a great guy, he'll help you.
And besides, he does anything I say.

468
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,648
Then will you please tell him
to put in his column...

469
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:40,877
...that Robert Gordon
would like to locate Irene Foster?

470
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,419
- Listen. Do you wanna be a regular guy?
- Give me a match. What is it?

471
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,425
Put in your column that Bob Gordon is
anxious to get in touch with Irene Foster.

472
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,085
- Who's Irene Foster?
- A girl.

473
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:53,891
Yeah, I imagine that. Now what?

474
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,693
You see, she's from Albany.
That's Bob Gordon's hometown.

475
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,428
She checked out of high school
and came to see Gordon...

476
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:03,199
...but he didn't recognize her. So she
ankles out of his office feeling bad.

477
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,968
High-hatting his old friends, eh?

478
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,441
- No, he's sorry now.
- Where did you get all this?

479
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,512
- I got a connection in the office.
- Yeah?

480
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:13,049
Look, will you put it in your column
and mark it down as a favor to me?

481
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,879
The pleasure is all mine.

482
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,385
- Gee, you're a regular guy at that, Bert.
- Thanks.

483
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,924
And everybody in town
thinks you're a heel, but I don't anymore.

484
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,322
Well, thanks, Snoop. I...

485
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,595
Come in.

486
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,698
Mr. Keeler?

487
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,172
- Yeah.
- You remember me?

488
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,975
Oh, yeah, you're the guy
that goes around snoring at people.

489
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:47,107
Snoop. Snoop.
I want you to meet Mr., uh...

490
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,343
Mr...

491
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,084
- What's his first name?
- I don't know.

492
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,022
- He wants to get into Gordon's show.
- Yeah? What do you do?

493
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,558
I snore.

494
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,527
Oh, you're part of the audience.

495
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:06,263
No, I... You see, I'm really a research
professor of sound phenomena.

496
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:10,667
Hey, why don't you give him a sample
of whatever you're talking about?

497
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,241
Well, certainly.

498
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,936
Well, for instance, there's...

499
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,947
...the light and thin
or blond type of snore:

500
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:25,780
Or the larger and fuller
or brunette variety:

501
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,859
And there's the ascending diapason:

502
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,064
And the descending diapason:

503
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:41,031
And of course the double diapason:

504
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,238
- That's good.
- Yeah.

505
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,277
But, uh...

506
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:52,747
The evident sign of the experienced
and accomplished snorer...

507
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,820
...is type seven,
the interrupted inspiration...

508
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,685
...or static lag variety:

509
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,929
You know, I've been all through this.

510
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:10,159
Which merges and extends itself
ultimately...

511
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:14,738
...and I think I may say, without fear
of successful contradiction...

512
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,206
...almost inevitably into type eight...

513
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,073
...which might be called
the last word in snoring.

514
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:27,618
This is the auto-resuscitation,
or self-awakening variety:

515
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,521
Uh, shall I go on?

516
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,394
No, you stay and I'll go on.

517
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,331
I'll go with you.

518
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,870
Hey, why don't you come too?

519
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,370
'The Main Stem' by Bert Keeler.

520
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:57,038
"Gardenias to Irene Foster for
walking out on Bob Gordon.

521
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:01,311
Cabbages to him for not
recognizing the Albany beauty.

522
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:02,976
<i>Some</i> guys are like that.

523
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:07,216
They prefer widows,
especially if they are rich."

524
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,285
How do you suppose
he ever got a hold of that?

525
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,897
What do you care, as long
as your name's spelt right?

526
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,998
You can't keep any secrets from Keeler.

527
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,431
- Oh, I think that's awful.
- What do you mean awful?

528
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,697
Yeah. Say, onions from that guy...

529
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,398
...are better than chrysanthebubs
from anybody else.

530
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:25,834
Better than what?

531
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,104
Chrysanthemums.

532
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,616
- Why don't you go back and see Gordon?
- I will not.

533
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,512
You came here to see him, didn't you?

534
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,847
Yes, but I still have a little pride left.

535
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,853
So has Gandhi but he's getting awful thin.

536
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,857
You know, if you could only
do something besides dance.

537
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:48,090
Gordon can buy hoofers a dime a dozen,
but if you could do, say, a bubble dance...

538
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,133
...or a dance on a tightrope.

539
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,202
I remember a fellow once that had an act.

540
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:57,001
He used to dance and while he was
dancing he'd spin a rope with one hand...

541
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,542
...and play a saxophone with the other.

542
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:00,803
And in the meanwhile...

543
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,607
Oh, hello, what's your name?

544
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,648
My name is Eva Lovelace.

545
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:09,219
Of course I haven't done very much,
just a little stock in Boston.

546
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,980
Oh, that isn't really my name.

547
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,487
I just use that for the theater.

548
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,923
But it does have a sort of
melodious sound, don't you think?

549
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:21,032
Eva Lovelace.
Oh, I can see my name in lights now.

550
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,190
Oh, I do so wanna be a great actress.

551
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,393
A really, truly great actress.

552
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,733
Tell me, did you know
Ellen Terry and Sarah Bernhardt?

553
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:31,342
How I should love to be
like Sarah Bernhardt...

554
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,739
...and have my name in the hall of fame.

555
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,971
That's Katharine Hepburn in <i>Morning Glory.</i>

556
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,979
Who do you think it is, Shirley Temple?

557
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,949
Tell him that he'll never know
what he's done for me. Not really.

558
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,216
Our lives are like two rivers now,
running into one sea.

559
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:51,386
And that to be a great actress,
one must experience every emotion in life.

560
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:54,555
Oh, I know, don't ask me.

561
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,861
I just do know that I love him.

562
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,663
Really, I do.

563
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:04,566
That's very good. Now, with this fellow
with the rope and the saxophone.

564
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:05,942
In the meanwhile, the girl...

565
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,841
Oh, you.

566
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:12,040
And another thing, the circulation
of the paper is growing and what's doing it?

567
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:14,049
- Your column.
- Right.

568
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,745
You know, Snoop.
I'm gonna be syndicated.

569
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,117
Spread all over the country.

570
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,863
Hey, listen, if you hit him
you gotta hit me too.

571
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,201
Keeler, I'm warning you.

572
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,970
One more crack like that in your column
and I won't be so easy with you.

573
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,547
- Hey, Snoop.
- Yeah?

574
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,884
I can take it, can't I?

Girls, leave your name
and address with Miss Corbett.

592
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,738
Those we select will be notified later.

593
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,932
All right, line up down front here.
Come on, now.

594
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,840
All right, can you sing or dance?

595
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,709
I sing but I can dance in a pinch.

596
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,443
This is not a pinch, this is a show.

597
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,284
I'll take your name
and we'll call you in a pinch.

598
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,216
All right, next.

599
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,088
- Well, how tall are you?
- Oh, about up to here.

600
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:04,854
Okay, see Miss Corbett.

601
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,497
But I've had no experience.

602
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,689
You won't need any. Name, please.

603
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,097
My name is Irene Foster.
I'm 5'5" in my stocking feet...

604
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,500
...and I've had one
very unpleasant experience.

605
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,039
- What are you...?
- Shall I see Miss Corbett?

606
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,074
No. You better
come over here and see me.

607
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,733
Thanks.

608
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,874
Hmm. Looks like that's all
for today, girls.

609
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,026
- Well...
- Well?

610
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,033
Well.

611
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,165
- Well...
- You just said that.

612
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,826
Yeah, I know, but...

613
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,838
You're all grown up now.
I mean, you look older.

614
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,169
Well, I am older.

615
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:55,301
That usually happens to a girl
between the ages of 16 and 22.

616
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,313
Yeah, now that I look at you,
you haven't changed so much.

617
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,315
I recognized you instantly.

618
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,476
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that.

619
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:06,055
My office is the last place in the world
that I'd expect to run into you.

620
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:07,885
You knew I'd get there someday.

621
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,720
We used to talk about it.

622
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:13,922
You were going to be the great producer
and I'd be a great star.

623
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,295
What funny, goofy dreams kids have.

624
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,369
That is a great gag,
your standing in line with those girls.

625
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,700
That wasn't any gag. I wanted a job.

626
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,276
Say, did you ever run into my friend,
Henry Schultz? What's he doing now?

627
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,674
Oh, he's running a delicatessen store.

628
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,042
Bob, won't you give me a chance?

629
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,643
You didn't come to New York to become
that great actress you talked about?

630
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,551
- That was one of the reasons.
- What was the other?

631
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:43,351
- I... I've forgotten.
- Well, I'll bet it was a lot more important.

632
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,156
Remember that summer in the Adirondacks
when we lived next door to each other?

633
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,732
I remember every day and...

634
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,562
And every night of that summer.

635
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,103
Up to five minutes ago,
I'd forgotten all about it.

636
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,899
Now I can't remember anything else.

637
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,634
Bob, you came to New York
and you made good.

638
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,108
Now, I've come to New York
and I wanna make good.

639
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:04,943
I want everything we ever planned
and dreamed about to come true.

640
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:09,314
So do I, Irene, but New York and Broadway,
they're not what we thought they were.

641
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:10,977
They're hard and cold.

642
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,647
A lovely creature like you
wouldn't have a chance here.

643
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,726
- Oh, Bob, you're wanted in the office.
- Later. I'm busy now.

644
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,226
It's important.

645
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:24,092
- Okay. Don't run away. I'll drive you home.
- All right.

646
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,597
- Basil.
- Yes.

647
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:30,536
Who is it?

648
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,302
- Lillian Brent.
- Listen, tell her I'll see her later.

649
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:35,037
She's been waiting all afternoon.

650
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:38,672
- She has, huh?
- And she's plenty burned up.

651
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,443
- Well, what'll I tell her?
- Never mind. I'll see her.

652
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,759
- Sorry to keep you waiting so long.
- You should be.

653
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,157
- Well, I was detained.
- So I understand.

654
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,321
In an empty theater with a chorus girl.

655
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:57,730
She isn't a chorus girl.
She's an old friend from my hometown.

656
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:00,337
Don't you think I'm more
important than anyone else?

657
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:03,065
Yeah, sure I do, Lillian.
You ought to know that.

Miss Foster.

691
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,732
- Miss Foster.
- Oh.

692
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,200
- Oh, hello.
- Boy, I wish I could concentrate like that.

693
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,203
- Is Mr. Gordon still busy?
- Oh, yes, he is.

694
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,239
He sent me to tell you that he's busy...

695
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,740
...and he won't be able
to take you home.

696
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,812
Oh.

697
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:21,111
- He's terribly sorry and so am I.
- Thanks.

698
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,877
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

699
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:27,857
And another thing,
if I'm to be in your new show...

700
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,188
...I demand all the attentions
a leading lady deserves.

701
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,160
- Leading lady?
- Yes.

702
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,162
You haven't one, have you?

703
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:38,768
- No, not yet.
- Well, darling, you have now.

704
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:40,131
Now, wait a minute.

705
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,204
Wait a minute.

706
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,931
You know as well as I do
that this part needs a name.

707
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,441
If I can only get a star,
the show's bound to click.

708
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,612
And if you don't?

709
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:51,109
What then?

710
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:54,081
Well, I'll postpone production.
Why take a chance?

711
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,346
Listen. If I'm willing to take a chance,
you should be.

712
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:00,821
After all, darling.
I am putting up the money.

713
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,152
Mm-hm.

714
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:05,728
- Is that the way you feel about it?
- Exactly.

715
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,256
All right.

716
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,168
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll gamble with you.

717
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:16,933
If I don't get a star for this show
in two weeks, I'll give you the part.

718
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,500
Do you really mean it?

719
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:21,839
- Positively.
- Oh, Bob.

720
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,847
Did you ring?

721
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,243
Yes.

722
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:29,250
Book passage for me on the first plane
leaving New York for Los Angeles.

723
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,184
- Yes, sir.
- But, Bob, why?

724
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:35,588
I'm going to Hollywood. I'm gonna find
a star for this show if I have to steal Garbo.

725
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:39,293
- There's a plane leaving for the coast at 9.
- And I'll be on it.

726
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,192
- Anything else?
- No, that'll be all.

727
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:44,096
Lillian, I've got an awful lot to do.
May I take you somewhere?

728
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:47,101
Yes. You can take me home.

729
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,008
- Oh, Miss Corbett.
- Yes, sir.

730
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:57,811
Don't tell anyone that I'm leaving.

731
00:51:57,982 --> 00:52:00,144
- I want that kept quiet.
- Yes, Mr. Gordon.

732
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,115
- Good night.
- Good night.

733
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:05,079
Hello.

734
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,414
- I ought to have you arrested.
- For what?

735
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:10,219
- For snooping.
- I didn't hear anything, honest, I didn't.

736
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:12,362
Except why Bob was talking to Lillian...

737
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,760
If you tell Bert Keeler what you heard,
I'll choke the socks off you.

738
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:18,664
- I never tell Bert Keeler anything.
- Promise me.

739
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:21,396
Well, I will if you'll have dinner
with me tonight.

740
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,734
I'll do it just for meanness.

741
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:27,039
Is this your idea of a dinner?

742
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:30,237
We'll have more doughnuts
and then I'll take you to a restaurant.

743
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:32,473
Oh, you're too good to me.

744
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:35,276
Hello, Snoop.

745
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,544
Hi, Bert.

746
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,119
- Hello.
- Hello.

747
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,814
- Well, any news?
- No.

748
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:45,892
- Oh, secrets, huh?
- Honest, it's nothing you ought to know.

749
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:48,088
Just the kind of stuff I print. What is it?

750
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,528
Why don't you shut up?

751
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,998
Well, I ain't said nothing. Yet.

752
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,399
I guess you're looking for
another punch in the nose.

753
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,699
Yeah? Gordon won't ever do that again.

754
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:59,070
- Not if he's in California.
- No.

755
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:01,610
Oh, so that's it.
Gordon's going West, huh?

756
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,247
What did you promise me, Snoop?

757
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,712
Yes, Snoop.
what did you promise the lady?

758
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:09,615
I promised Kitty I wouldn't tell you
that Gordon had a fight with Lillian Brent.

759
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,414
- Snoop.
- What about?

760
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,956
It's nothing, it's just that he can't
get a leading lady for his show.

761
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,184
Mmm.

762
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,634
You ought to have a zipper on your mouth.

763
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:26,361
I don't know how to play one.

764
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,639
So Gordon can't get a leading lady?

765
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:38,180
Yeah. If he can't get one,
he's gonna let Lillian Brent play the part.

766
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:42,546
Well, why doesn't he get that French star?

767
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,681
- What French star?
- That... Oh, what's her name again?

768
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,960
La Belle Arlette, that's it.

769
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:54,098
- La Belle Arlette?
- Yes, Mademoiselle La Belle Arlette...

770
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,198
...from the Comédie Française in Paris.

771
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,390
Never heard of her.

772
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:00,538
Oh, my dear child, don't say that.

773
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,264
Everybody's heard of Arlette.
Haven't they, Snoop?

774
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,874
Oh, yeah, sure, certainly.

775
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:07,875
- What's she like?
- Tall, beautiful, blond.

776
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:10,480
Maybe Mr. Gordon'd be interested.
I have to be going.

777
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,878
Oh, thanks for the banquet, Snoop.

778
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,576
Anytime at all, Kitty.

779
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:18,154
Don't forget to tell Gordon about Arlette.

780
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:21,121
Hey, Bert, who's Mademoiselle Arlette?

781
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:23,259
Just a cigar.

782
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:26,087
Well, I can't get the angle of you
trying to kid her.

783
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,425
It isn't her. It's Gordon I want to rib.

784
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,000
She'll go back and tell Gordon
all about Arlette.

785
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:35,036
- Then I'll build her up in my column.
- But there is no Mademoiselle Arlette.

786
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,264
Nobody knows it but you and me.

787
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,739
Now I'm sorry you know it.

788
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:45,574
Not since the arrival of the Statue of Liberty
has France sent to this country...

789
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,514
...such a glamorous, beautiful
and talented personality...

790
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,017
...as Mademoiselle La Belle Arlette.

791
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:52,849
In this correspondent's opinion...

792
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:57,119
...it won't belong before Mademoiselle
La Belle Arlette's beauty, talent...

793
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,126
...charm and, uh...

794
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,066
...mildness will make her
the talk of the town.

795
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,668
Flash.

796
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,740
- Hello. Glad to see you back.
- Thanks. Anything new?

797
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:13,206
- Plenty. Hello.
- Hi, Bob. Have a good trip?

798
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:15,812
Terrible. Come on inside.

799
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:24,081
Miss Corbett, will you come in, please?

800
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,715
- Well, what happened in Hollywood?
- Nothing.

801
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,020
Those movie stars are guarded
like a Turkish harem.

802
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:33,391
That makes things tough.
What are you gonna do?

803
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:36,590
That's what I'd like to know.
Everybody's in pictures.

804
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,758
It's impossible to cast a show anymore.

805
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:41,428
Why, haven't you heard
about Mademoiselle Arlette?

806
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,767
- Who?
- Here, look.

807
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:46,838
- Haven't you read about her?
- No. Who is she?

808
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,002
I don't know, but Keeler's been
giving her boost in his column.

809
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,581
Why, every manager in town's after her.

810
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:53,841
Arlette?

811
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,576
- Where's she from?
- Paris.

812
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,743
- What's she look like?
- I don't know.

813
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,889
- You haven't seen her?
- No.

814
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,889
- Where's she stopping?
- I don't know.

815
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:04,187
Why? What have you been doing
while I was away?

816
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,295
Nobody knows where she is.
It's a mystery.

817
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:09,364
We've gotta get in touch with her.
Check every hotel in town.

818
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,092
Yes, sir.

819
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:21,103
All right, mademoiselle. Relax.

820
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:25,810
Hey, when can I get out of this harness?

821
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:28,074
My feet hurt.

822
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,524
You look about as effeminate
as Wallace Beery.

823
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:42,495
Now, look, Snoop, all you have to do
is sit here all day and answer the phone.

824
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,725
- Now, can you talk like a dame?
- I can try.

825
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,495
Let's hear it.

826
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,438
Buy me a Rolls-Royce, Daddy.

827
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:56,034
You're thinking like one anyway, but you
gotta get your voice higher, higher, way up.

828
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:59,672
Look, Snoop, if there's any soprano
in you, this is the time to bring it out.

829
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,512
- Now, try it again.
- Buy me... Ahem.

830
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:04,654
Buy me a Rolls-Royce...!

831
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,289
I can't.

832
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,087
Then we're stuck.

833
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,458
Say, maybe you better be a man.

834
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,360
What do you mean maybe?

835
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,021
- As Arlette's secretary.
- I'll feel more natural.

836
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:16,927
All right. What are you going to say?

837
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,432
- Remember, you're a French secretary.
- Yeah.

838
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,629
What are you gonna say when Gordon
asks for Mademoiselle Arlette?

839
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:26,640
- What are you going to say?
- Well, I'll say, <i>"Bonjour, oui, oui.</i>

840
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,045
Mademoiselle Arlette, she is busy.

841
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:32,641
She is very, very busy
with the rehearsal."

842
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,066
How's that?

843
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:35,380
Very good.

844
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,419
The other 50 million Frenchmen
must be wrong.

845
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,647
Well, does the dame
have to come from Paris?

846
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,122
Certainly, the publicity is out.

847
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,057
Gee, I wish you could speak French.

848
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,720
I speak French. <i>Si, Si, señor.</i>

849
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:50,060
That's Spanish.

850
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:53,134
Imagine that. I speak Spanish too.

851
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,467
Hello? Hotel Carlton?

852
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:03,341
Have you a Mademoiselle Arlette
registered there?

853
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,373
Oh, may I speak to her?

854
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:12,351
Wait. Wait a minute.

855
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,949
Now, hold it.

856
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,154
- Now, listen, you talk just like a secretary.
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

857
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,925
This is Robert Gordon's office.

858
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,433
May I speak to Mademoiselle Arlette?

859
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:27,627
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

860
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,205
Mademoiselle Arlette, she is busy.

861
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:35,005
She is very, very busy rehearsing.

862
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,189
- Hello.
- Oh, Mr. Gordon...

863
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,552
...Arlette's on the wire. She's singing.

864
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,468
It's Arlette. Shh.

865
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,741
It's a cinch, it's not Crosby.

866
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,385
<i>Hello?</i>

867
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:19,319
Hello, this is Robert Gordon speaking.

868
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,617
May I speak to Mademoiselle Arlette?

869
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,624
Hey, it's Gordon.

870
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:28,392
I am sorry. Mademoiselle Arlette,
she is busy.

871
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:33,298
She is very, very busy rehearsing.

872
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,634
- Oh, Mr. Gordon.
- Miss Corbett.

873
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:41,904
I want you to send a telegram to Arlette.
Arrange for an interview.

874
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,843
Tell her that I must see her.

875
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:47,348
Yes. sir.
And, Mr. Gordon, Miss Foster's here.

876
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:51,147
Oh. Well, yeah, all right.
Have her come in.

877
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,087
All right, Miss Foster.
You can come in now.

878
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:59,393
- Hello, Irene.
- Hello, Bob.

879
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:02,663
Gee, I'm glad you dropped in. I've been
wondering if you were still in town.

880
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,994
Oh, I want you to meet
two friends of mine.

881
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,433
- Ted and Sally Burke.
- How do you do?

882
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,235
The Burkes?

883
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:11,806
Say, I remember you.

884
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,639
I caught your act in Detroit. You used
to work with a trained duck, didn't you?

885
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,247
- That's right.
- You still got that act together?

886
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:20,213
Everything but the duck.

887
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:23,284
You know, it's been
a kind of a tough winter.

888
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:27,253
- You mean you ate the act?
- Last Christmas.

889
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:30,758
- Oh, what are you doing now?
- Nothing since the duck died.

890
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:33,555
Mr. Gordon, this is Irene's appointment.

891
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,198
We just came with her.

892
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:36,764
She wants to go in your show.

893
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,129
She's got talent, plenty of it.

894
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,066
All she needs is a chance.

895
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:43,070
And you can give it to her.

896
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,574
- That's quite a compliment, Irene.
- Really, Mr. Gordon, Irene is clever.

897
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,177
We know. Don't we, Ted?

898
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:51,280
- Sure do.
- Well, I'd like to think it over, Irene.

899
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:54,315
- Casting a show is a very important matter.
- That's right.

900
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:58,443
Say, how'd you like to go
in my new show, both of you?

901
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:01,222
Take it easy, Mr. Gordon.
I got a weak heart.

902
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,985
Really, we didn't come
here to talk about ourselves.

903
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,562
- It's about Irene.
- Oh, that's all right, Sally.

904
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:09,461
- But you don't understand...
- Wait. I'm offering you a job.

905
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:11,032
- Don't you want it?
- We do.

906
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:14,603
- Well, then, it's settled.
- Oh, I think it's wonderful, Sally.

907
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,170
But what about you?

908
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,398
Mr. Gordon, what about Irene?

909
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:20,168
I'll talk with Irene alone.

910
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:24,041
- Come back, Ted. We'll talk about money.
- You won't find us hard to deal with.

911
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,114
That's fine. I'm glad you dropped in.

912
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,047
See you at the house, Irene.

913
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:30,585
- Goodbye, Sally.
- Goodbye.

914
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,419
- Goodbye, Mr. Gordon.
- Goodbye, Ted.

915
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:42,060
Well, how do you feel now?

916
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,859
I feel terrible.

917
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,661
Terrible about what?

918
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:49,601
We go in to get her a job
and we come out with it.

919
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:53,505
I told you we didn't need that duck.

920
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,869
Well, I don't know what to say, Irene.

921
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:02,349
I want you to... Well, I want you
to understand how I feel about all this.

922
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,387
I want you to go back to Albany.

923
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:08,252
- But why, Bob? I've just come from there.
- That's what you gotta understand.

924
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:11,053
I know how it is.
You worked hard at what you were doing...

925
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:14,755
...saved your money and deprived yourself
of a lot of things you should've had.

926
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,832
So you could come to New York
and get a chance at what you wanted.

927
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,332
- I did that.
- I know you did.

928
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:20,663
But it isn't worth it.

929
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,999
What you get isn't what you came after.

930
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:25,107
I know that too.

931
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:27,840
Look, there's nothing for you here
in New York.

932
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:31,242
I could give you a bit in my show
and maybe you'd get another and another...

933
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,714
- That's all I want. That's enough for me.
- Yeah, but not for me.

934
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,683
If you were anyone else, okay.
But you're not.

935
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:40,681
I know what'd happen to you
here in New York.

936
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:44,487
I know how cheap and selfish this town is.
The easiest thing for me to do...

937
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:47,722
...is to give you the chance
and put you away and forget about it.

938
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:48,921
But I can't.

939
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,931
So I'm taking the hard way.

940
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:52,665
Won't you go back to Albany?

941
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:56,272
- Without even one try of what I want?
- Without even one try.

942
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:00,000
- Bob, do you honestly think it's best?
- I know it is.

943
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:03,575
All right, I'll go home.

944
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:06,142
Oh, say, by the way...

945
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,514
...whatever happened
to the fellow who gave you this?

946
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,719
I don't know.
I haven't seen him for years.

947
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:18,725
He's probably forgotten all about me.

948
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:22,525
Well, I imagine he ran off
and died somewhere, don't you?

949
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,724
I imagine so.

950
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,629
Well, uh...

951
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,803
...will you wear it for me?

952
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,780
Uh, I think you'd better go home and pack.

953
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,585
I'll pick you up in an hour
and drive you to the station.

954
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:02,568
Well, did you do yourself any good?

955
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:06,671
- I'm going back home.
- Why?

956
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,742
Well, he thinks it's best for me.

957
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:12,675
Oh, that's too bad.

958
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,716
But that's the way it goes in this racket.

959
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:20,823
- Are you sure you're not just stage-struck?
- Of course not.

960
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,522
Oh, I know I could do something
if I only had the chance.

961
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,256
You know.
I've heard that a million times but...

962
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,891
Well, for some reason or other,
I believe you.

963
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,559
You're the only one that does.

964
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:39,909
- Yes, sir?
- Why don't you answer when I ring?

965
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,306
- Come in here.
- Coming.

966
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:55,087
Oh. Stick around a few minutes, honey.
I wanna talk to you.

967
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,686
Yes, sir.

968
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:01,693
Miss Corbett,
get me a ticket and a compartment...

969
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:04,732
...on the afternoon train for Albany.
It's for Miss Foster.

970
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,335
Oh.

971
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:10,098
- She's an awful nice kid, isn't she?
- Of course she is.

972
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,940
Mr. Gordon,
why are you sending her back?

973
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:17,136
You don't think I want her
to stay around this place, do you?

974
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:18,474
I think she'd like to.

975
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:22,382
Listen, will you stop worrying
about my private affairs?

976
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:24,452
Yes, sir.

977
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:26,885
Have you been able to get in touch
with Arlette?

978
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:28,751
I've been ringing her all morning.

979
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,154
All her secretary can say is:

980
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,728
"Mademoiselle, she is busy rehearsing.

981
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:35,096
Mademoiselle,
she is having her face lifted."

982
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,427
She's the busiest dame I ever saw.

983
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,090
All right, ring her again.

984
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:42,204
- I've gotta get in touch with her.
- Yes, sir.

985
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:54,750
Hello.

986
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,045
Hello.

987
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:00,053
I'd like to speak to Mademoiselle Arlette
if she's not baking a cake.

988
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:03,625
<i>Bonjour. Oui, our”.</i>
Mademoiselle Arlette, she is busy.

989
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:08,526
She is very, very busy rehearsing.

990
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,829
Doesn't that dame do anything
but rehearse?

991
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,130
I wanna talk to her. It's urgent.

992
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,865
<i>This is Robert Gordon's secretary.</i>

993
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,241
Hi, Kitty.

994
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,469
Say that again, you.

995
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:27,944
Hello!

996
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:54,134
- Good luck with the show, Bob.
- Thanks, Irene, I need it.

997
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:57,797
- I wish I were going back to Albany too.
- Oh, Albany is no place for you.

998
01:07:57,974 --> 01:08:01,103
An amateur like me, maybe, but not you.
You've arrived in New York.

999
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:04,941
- That's where you belong.
- I know. I'd like to see the old place again.

1000
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,446
What could possibly interest you
in Albany?

1001
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,346
Well, you're going to be there.

1002
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:12,955
Well, it's nice to know I'd interest you
in Albany anyway.

1003
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:16,023
Do you know my address,
in case you come up for a visit...

1004
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:19,628
- ...or if you wanna write or something?
- 560 Washington Avenue.

1005
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:23,255
- Hmm! Quite a memory.
- I spent all last night trying to remember it.

1006
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:26,068
Board!

1007
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,863
- Goodbye, Irene.
- Goodbye, Bob.

1008
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,697
Board!

1009
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:32,432
- You know something?
- What?

1010
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,543
I wish this train weren't pulling out.

1011
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:37,544
Oh, I bet you tell that to all the girls.

1012
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:03,368
- Mail this letter when you arrive in Albany.
- Yes, ma'am.

1013
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,007
- You won't forget?
- No, ma'am, I won't.

1014
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,506
Thank you.

1015
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:11,537
Come on. Hurry. I've got a taxi waiting.

1016
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:17,944
<i><i>It's time for promenading</i>

1017
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:21,421
<i>And I'll be with you soon</i>

1018
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:28,429
<i>All the best folks are parading
On a Sunday afternoon</i>

1019
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:35,470
<i>We'll rent a horse and carriage
And I'll be proud of you</i>

1020
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:42,374
<i>We'll talk about a marriage
On the busy avenue</i>

1021
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:49,417
<i>And then we'll ride To the countryside</i>

1022

1026
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:38,794

<i>On a Sunday afternoon</i>

1030
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,906
Well, Bob, what do you think of it?

1031
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:01,049
Well, the routine's okay.

1032
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:04,312
What I'm worried about
is finding a star for this show.

1033
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:08,615
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Hi, Lilly.

1034
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,954
I just found a very cute little poem
about us in Keeler's column.

1035
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:14,028
I'd like to read it to you.

1036
01:12:14,197 --> 01:12:16,632
<i>Lilly was an amateur
Who had a lot of dough</i>

1037
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,461
<i>Bob was just another guy
Who longed to do a show</i>

1038
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:23,037
<i>Now Lil has the role she wants
And Bobby has his million</i>

1039
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:27,439
<i>The woman pays, the woman plays
And Bob is stuck with Lillian</i>

1040
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:31,308
Can't you stop Keeler
from printing such stuff in his column?

1041
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:35,410
If I continue writing this column,
I'll need a bodyguard.

1042
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:36,677
- You're not yellow?
- No.

1043
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,379
But can't you put me
on "Advice to the Lovelorn"

1044
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:40,886
...or "How to Bake a Cake"?

1045
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:43,822
Listen, your column's going strong.
You're a success.

1046
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:45,825
People hate the ground you walk on.

1047
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:48,896
Everybody in town wants to see you
hit by a taxi. Think of it.

1048
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:51,193
Boy, am I hot. Everybody hates me.

1049
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,835
- Ain't that swell, Snoop?
- Yeah.

1050
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:55,596
Five people phoned me today
and called you a rat.

1051
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,570
Isn't that sweet?
That entitles me to that raise, doesn't it?

1052
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:01,540
- You get your raise.
- Fine. I'll buy some accident insurance.

1053
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:04,510
Keep up the good work, my boy.
I may give you a bonus.

1054
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,614
Thanks. Looks like I'll die a rich man.

1055
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:08,648
If I live long enough.

1056
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:11,378
Well, Snoop, here's another boost
for my friend Gordon.

1057
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,488
This is the crowning point of our career.

1058
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:15,420
Say, we've been crowned twice already.

1059
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,889
That's applause to a good newspaperman.
Get this.

Arlette for his new play have failed.

1061
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,400
People are asking why.
Maybe she read his play.

1062
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:28,765
It's our guess that he will have to sign up
Lillian "No Talent" Brent as his lucky star.

1063
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:32,101
This move should make Gordon
Broadway's public enemy number one."

1064
01:13:32,275 --> 01:13:35,404
- How do you like that? Right on the nose.
- Yeah, but whose nose?

1065
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,478
Oh, you're not a bit optimistic.

1066
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,248
That man is here again.

1067
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:53,461
Hello, we were expecting you.

1068
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,258
What's on your mind, Gordon? Unh!

1069
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:00,033
Hey, listen...

1070
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:09,405
- Hey, Snoop.
- What?

1071
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,445
Get off. This is as far as we go.

1072
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:14,879
What's the matter, hedging?

1073
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:17,679
No, I'm not.
But this show means everything to me.

1074
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:20,550
Oh, come on. Be regular.
Give me a few more days.

1075
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,855
Listen, you promised me the lead...

1076
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:25,722
...if you weren't able to find anybody
in two weeks.

1077
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:27,863
Your time is up.

1078
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,794
- Be reasonable, Lillian.
- No.

1079
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:33,197
We made a bargain
and I expect you to live up to it.

1080
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:38,068
All right.

1081
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,337
There's your contract.

1082
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:44,206
Sign here.

1083
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:49,681
I suppose you know that if the show flops,
I'm ruined and you're out 60,000 bucks.

1084
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,822
Yes, my sweet. I know all about that.

1085
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,924
Now you sign, right under mine.

1086
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,427
- Mr. Gordon.
- Yeah?

1087
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:05,329
Mademoiselle Arlette,
she wishes to see you.

1088
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,329
- Arlette? You mean she's here now?
- Yes, sir.

1089
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,233
Sign this contract and stop stalling.

1090
01:15:10,406 --> 01:15:12,966
Not if there's a chance
of getting her for the part.

1091
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:17,473
- All right, you have her come in now.
- Yes, sir.

1092
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:21,683
- Oh!
- Oh! Don't you get jittery.

1093
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,149
- What'd he say?
- Don't you begin getting nervous.

1094
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,379
I've lost 8 pounds
since we started this thing.

1095
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:29,320
- Who's nervous?
- We'll both get the electric chair for this.

1096
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:31,358
What's worse, I'm liable to lose my job.

1097
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,792
Forget about that. I'm all right.
You'll see the best Frenchwoman...

1098
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:37,365
...any high school dramatic society
ever turned out.

1099
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,594
If this were only a high school society.
Do you know your name?

1100
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:43,501
- Irene Foster.
- Oh, no, you're Mademoiselle Arlette...

1101
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:46,801
...and you're from Paris
and you've been very busy rehearsing.

1102
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:51,311
Mr. Gordon, you sent for me, yes?

1103
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:55,978
Yeah, well, it sounds a little Swedish
but I guess you'll get by, I hope.

1104
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:05,484
Mr. Gordon, you sent for me, yes?

1105
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:08,187
Yes, of course, I did, mademoiselle,
some time ago...

1106
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,890
...but, well, I'd given up hope
of ever seeing you.

1107
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,628
You see, I have been very,
very busy rehearsing.

1108
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:17,967
Yeah. Pardon me.
May I present Miss Lillian Brent?

1109
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,835
And why not?

1110
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,242
I am always happy to meet people.

1111
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,515
- How do you do?
- Delighted.

1112
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,242
If you don't mind, Bob, I'll run along.

1113
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:38,223
Would you kindly ask Mr. Gordon
to call me tonight if he's not too busy?

1114
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:41,056
- I'll make a note of that.
- Thanks.

1115
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,401
- Snoop.
- Yeah?

1116
01:16:51,574 --> 01:16:53,167
Get a load of this.

1117
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:57,438
"Bob Gordon signs Mademoiselle Arlette
for new show <i>Broadway Rhythm.</i>

1118
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,048
The beautiful and talented
French actress, Arlette...

1119
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:03,709
...has signed a contract to star in Bob
Gordon's <i>Broadway Rhythm</i> production.

1120
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:07,982
The young producer is to be complimented
for having secured the services of Arlette.

1121
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:11,127
Rehearsals start today."
What do you think of that?

1122
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:15,695
Hey, that's a beautiful dame.

1123
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,698
But how can Gordon sign Arlette
when there is no Arlette?

1124
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,895
That's what I'd like to know.

1125
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,875
- Snoop.
- What?

1126
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,845
Have you spoken to anyone
since the last time I was here?

1127
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:33,682
Yeah, a lot of people.

1128
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:34,873
What did you say?

1129
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,385
"Mademoiselle Arlette, she is busy... "

1130
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:39,377
No, no, no, Snoop.
Did you say anything else?

1131
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:40,716
- Yeah.
- What?

1132
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:42,824
- "She is very, very busy."
- No, no. Look.

1133
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:45,427
Look, Snoop, I want you to think.

1134
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:48,962
Look, I don't want you to strain yourself.
I just want you to think.

1135
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,381
About what?

1136
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:54,494
Is there anyone in particular you remember
speaking to while I was away?

1137
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,865
- Yeah.
- Who?

1138
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:58,166
Kitty Corbett, Bob Gordon's secretary.

1139
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,364
What did you say?

1140
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:01,977
"Mademoiselle Arlette, she... "

1141
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,207
Besides that?

1142
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,576
I said, "Hi, Kitty."

1143
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:08,308
- What?
- But I hung right up.

1144
01:18:08,484 --> 01:18:11,078
- You know me, trigger judgment.
- Oh, you hung up?

1145
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,753
Whenever I'm through with the phone,
I hang up the receiver.

1146
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:15,789
That's smart. Have you seen her since?

1147
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,756
- Yeah, she was here.
- Here?

1148
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:19,088
What did she say?

1149
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,593
I don't know. I was asleep.

1150
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:23,391
Asleep?

1151
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:28,166
- She was here and you were asleep?
- Yeah, I dozed off.

1152
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:30,362
She left this.

1153
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,845
- Well, of all the dumb guys...
- Don't worry about Corbett.

1154
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:42,848
She won't tip the gag off. She said so.

1155
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:46,818
Just the same, I gotta find out who this
dame is that Gordon's got signed up.

1156
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:48,289
What do you want me to do?

1157
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:51,359
Go down to the ocean
and pull a wave over your head.

1158
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,436
Well, that's not so good,
but I guess it'll have to do.

1159
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:11,774
Take five minutes' rest.

1160
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,540
Five minutes' rest.

1161
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:23,891
Who is it?

1162
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:26,018
- Mademoiselle Arlette?
<i>- Oui,</i> monsieur.

1163
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:28,163
Mr. Gordon's ready to see your number.

1164
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,458
<i>Très bien,</i> I come, <i>toute de suite.</i>

1165
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:31,930
All right.

1166
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:37,904
Hey, keep your fingers crossed.

1167
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,106
Oh, my.

1168
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:53,483
Ah, <i>ban/our,</i> Monsieur Gordon,
you ready for me, yes?

1169
01:19:53,656 --> 01:19:56,819
- Yes, mademoiselle. All ready.
<i>- Merci beaucoup.</i>

1170
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,961
You know Mademoiselle
Arlette's music, yes?

1171
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,827
Why, no, mademoiselle, I don't.

1172
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,594
Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk. Too bad.

1173
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:11,832
Then you play for me something like...

1174
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,742
How you say, like...?

1175
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,439
Like:

1176
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:22,240
- Oh, no, no, no, monsieur, no.
- No?

1177
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:25,080
Something with the... Ah!

1178
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:27,120
With rhythm, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1179
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,018
- Yes?
- You mean hot.

1180
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:31,182
Yes.

1181
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:35,262
Oh, no, no, no.

1182
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:36,921
No.

1183
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:44,536
Ah! Very good.

1184
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,063
No, no, no. No.

1185
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:18,964
That is all wrong. Don't play anything.

1186
01:21:20,743 --> 01:21:23,337
Oh, monsieur, I am so sorry.

1187
01:21:23,512 --> 01:21:25,640
You see, he does not understand.

1188
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:28,545
Well, mademoiselle,
may I get you another pianist?

1189
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,952
Oh, no, no, no.

1190
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:38,356
I tell you, I do for you like I did in Paris
without any music.

1191
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:40,928
It is much better that way.

1192
01:21:56,512 --> 01:22:00,005
Ah! You like this one, no?

1193
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:54,557
You got him, sister. You got him.

1194
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,661
This Arlette you've been spreading
all over your column...

1195
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:00,063
...do you know who she is?

1196
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:05,935
Yeah. She's a 5-cent cigar
and a very bad smoke.

1197
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:09,271
Maybe so. But there
is a Mademoiselle Arlette living in Paris...

1198
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:11,003
...and she threatens suit.

1199
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:13,045
Read that cable.

1200
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,209
What are you gonna do about that?

1201
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,887
Don't worry, chief.
I'm killing Arlette tonight.

1202
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,354
- Killing her?
- Everything will be taken care of.

1203
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:27,359
There won't be any bloodshed,
just a nice quiet assassination.

1204
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:29,657
And don't send orchids.

1205
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:34,564
Oh, no, no, no, Monsieur Gordon,
I never, never go out in public.

1206
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,602
Tonight you've got to make an exception.

1207
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:40,037
I've invited the press and the cast.
The whole party is for you.

1208
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,404
Why, the publicity alone
will put the show over.

1209
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,410
Oh, come on, please say you'll go.

1210
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,481
<i>Très bien,</i> if you insist.

1211
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:48,673
Ha, ha, swell.

1212
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,221
Hello?

1213
01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:55,382
It's for you, mademoiselle.

1214
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:57,218
<i>Merci.</i>

1215
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:01,022
<i>- Hello? Oui?</i>
-This is Bert Keeler of the <i>World Tribune.</i>

1216
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,026
<i>I wanna see you at my office right away.</i>

1217
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,761
If you're as smart as I think you are,
you'll grab a taxi and hurry over.

1218
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,065
I come at once.

1219
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:13,932
Anything wrong?

1220
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:18,444
- No, no, no, nothing of importance.
- Oh, whatever it is, I'd like to help you.

1221
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:24,109
Monsieur Gordon,
you will excuse me, please. I must go.

1222
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:25,747
Can't I go with you?

1223
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:30,222
Oh, no, man <i>chéri,</i> this is one time,
Arlette, she must be alone.

1224
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:31,951
All right.

1225
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:35,462
Au revoir, until tonight.

1226
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:42,102
Monsieur Keeler, you sent for me, no?

1227
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:45,365
I'm Keeler and I sent for you, yes.

1228
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,134
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1229
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:51,803
You see, I have been very, very busy...

1230
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,414
- ...rehearsing.
- Rehearsing.

1231
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:55,311
If you're a French, I'm a Chinaman.

1232
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:58,510
- That is possible.
- Sit down.

1233
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:05,488
You know, I'm very happy to meet you.

1234
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:08,528
- Oh, monsieur.
- You can call me mister.

1235
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:11,097
What made you think you could
get away with a gag like this?

1236
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,964
Gag? Well, what is it, gag?

1237
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:18,130
Now listen, sister, if you wanna play games
with me, I'll send out for some Parcheesi.

1238
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:19,432
I don't like cheese.

1239
01:26:22,778 --> 01:26:25,042
- Well?
- Well?

1240
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:26,813
All right, I'll handle it another way.

1241
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:31,347
Get Bob Gordon on the phone.

1242
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,220
Don't do that, please.

1243
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:34,916
Okay, skip it.

1244
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,282
Now, talk fast.

1245
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:39,587
I wanted to get into Bob's show
and this was the only way to do it.

1246
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:41,561
- Why?
- He wouldn't give me a chance...

1247
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:44,860
...under my right name.
But as Arlette, he thinks I'm terrific.

1248
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,297
He may be right
and that's what I'm afraid of.

1249
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:48,732
Well, the party's over.

1250
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:51,236
I'm sorry I have to ruin
a perfectly good racket.

1251
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:52,874
- Why?
- Why?

1252
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,873
I build up a phony Arlette as a gag.

1253
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,171
You step in,
Gordon cashes in on the publicity...

1254
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:59,109
...and I'm the biggest chump
on Broadway.

1255
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:02,444
- And everybody lived happily ever after.
- But not on me.

1256
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:04,813
Now, listen, I made Arlette
and I can break her.

1257
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:07,614
I got a paper behind me
that'll print anything I write.

1258
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:09,814
Here's my column for tomorrow. Get this.

1259
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:13,791
"Arlette refuses Gordon's ridiculous offer
and sails for France today."

1260
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:16,932
And everybody lived happily ever after.

1261
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:18,396
Without Arlette.

1262
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:20,797
You'd deliberately ruin
Bob Gordon's show...

1263
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,836
...just to get even for a couple of harmless
blows on the jaw?

1264
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:25,063
Harmless?

1265
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,733
My getting into this show means a lot to me
but it means much more to Bob.

1266
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,241
And I'm going to protect him.

1267
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:34,110
I don't care what you write about me
in that column of yours. Get this straight.

1268
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:37,377
You can't stop Arlette from opening
in that show tomorrow night.

1269
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:39,452
- Oh, excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.

1270
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,783
Wait a minute.

1271
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:45,893
If you don't think I can do it,
maybe the real Arlette can stop you.

1272
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:48,826
The real Arlette?
There isn't any real Arlette.

1273
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:50,726
That's what I thought.

1274
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:55,063
Here's a cablegram we got from Paris.
"Unless you discontinue publicity...

1275
01:27:55,237 --> 01:27:58,104
...in your column and expose person
masquerading as Arlette...

1276
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,970
...my attorneys will bring suit
against you and Gordon.

1277
01:28:01,143 --> 01:28:02,440
Mademoiselle Arlette."

1278
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:03,806
What do you think of that?

1279
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:07,380
Gordon's giving her a banquet.

1280
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:10,780
If she doesn't show as Arlette,
we're in for another sock in the nose.

1281
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,681
I can't help that.

1282
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,613
I'm sorry, kid, I had to do this.

1283
01:28:26,568 --> 01:28:28,127
Just a minute.

1284
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,829
You know, you're not in such
a healthy spot yourself.

1285
01:28:31,006 --> 01:28:34,067
Whatever Bob and I have done
was based on your phony information.

1286
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:36,574
Now, you listen to me.

1287
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,860
- I can't understand why she isn't here.
- I can't understand...

1288
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:57,727
- ...why she didn't come with you.
- She'd rather come alone.

1289
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:01,233
- Go phone the hotel. See if she's left yet.
- Right-o.

1290
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:05,235
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1291
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,506
- Good evening, Mr. Keeler.
- Good evening.

1292
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:09,576
This way, please.

1293
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:18,411
- Good evening, Mr. Gordon.
- Hello.

1294
01:29:18,587 --> 01:29:20,112
Irene.

1295
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:21,887
Oh, hello, Bob.

1296
01:29:22,057 --> 01:29:24,116
What on earth are you doing
back in New York?

1297
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:26,386
I didn't go home.
I've been here all the time.

1298
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,518
Why didn't you let me know?

1299
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:31,132
I really didn't think you were interested.

1300
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:34,667
Pardon me, Bob, but Miss Foster
is my guest for this evening.

1301
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:35,928
Come, Irene.

1302
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,799
Sorry, Bob.

1303
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:44,673
I'm terribly nervous, Mr. Keeler.

1304
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:47,713
Yeah? How do you think I feel?
You know, this wasn't my idea.

1305
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:51,285
Bob, get a load of this
in Keeler's column.

1306
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:02,628
- Another one of Keeler's ribs.
- At your expense.

1307
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:05,459
- What?
- I've checked everywhere. I can't locate her.

1308
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:08,695
- Call her hotel. She's there.
- I've called twice. She's not there.

1309
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:11,498
They said she checked out
late this afternoon.

1310
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:17,208
Don't you think we ought to tell him?

1311
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:19,609
Say, how would you like a sock
in the nose?

1312
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:21,909
Now, go ahead.
You've just got time to make it.

01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:42,603
"What Bob Gordon will lead
which Irene Foster down the bridal path...

Oh, Mr. Keeler, you're both wrong.
