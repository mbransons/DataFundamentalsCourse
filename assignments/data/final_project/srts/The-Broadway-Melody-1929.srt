1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,695
There it is, Herb.
One verse and two choruses.

3
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:32,561
- Is this a good song, Eddie?
- It's a good song, Herb.

4
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:35,225
- It's as good as the doll-dance number.
- All right.

5
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,348
Skip the verse, do the chorus, tempo.

6
00:02:08,936 --> 00:02:10,301
Hot, eh?

7
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:17,574
- Good morning.
- Hello, Jimmy.

8
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:20,509
I've got the hottest song
you ever heard in your life.

9
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,845
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

10
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,878
Got it? Have you got it?

11
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:29,283
Jimmy, if you can get this crowd
to keep quiet, I'll sing it for you.

12
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:31,584
- How about a little harmony?
- All right.

13
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,852
Listen, let's go through it.
One and two.

14
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:36,924
The second chorus,
a little jazz, a little pep.

15
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:39,258
Come on, I'll vamp until ready.
Let's go.

16
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,129
Go on, Herb.

17
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:43,600
- That's it.
- The chorus in F-sharp.

18
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:11,324
Hot dog!

19
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:18,025
Listen, kid, if we can get that number,
we're a cinch for the Palace.

20
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,629
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Eddie.

21
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:24,531
Listen, Eddie, we'll take that song
and smack it over for you.

22
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:25,766
Sure!

23
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:29,934
Oh, no. Not this song, babies.
Zanfield's bought it for his new revue.

24
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:33,577
And the Mahoney Sisters are coming
from the West to put it over for me.

25
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:37,514
Listen, Eddie, you're not gonna waste
a swell number like that...

26
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,383
...on a smalltime sister act, are you?

27
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:42,955
Nix cracking, Rosie.

28
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:47,387
Half of that sister team is going to be
the future Mrs. Eddie Kearns.

29
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:49,462
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Eddie.

30
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,259
If you wanna be made overnight,
just give us a crack at that number.

31
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,835
Oh, no. Oh, no.

32
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,434
No, no. Positively not.

33
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:01,633
I've gotta get back to the hotel.
The girls are waiting for me.

34
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,810
Oh, but listen,
if you want a song...

35
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:06,704
...see Georgie Cohan.

36
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,242
He writes good music too.

37
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,285
How about it, Jimmy?

38
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:22,387
Oh, I'll take that, thank you.

39
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:26,358
Gee, this is elegant, ain't it?

40
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,935
Tell you better when
I get a peek at the beds.

41
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:37,335
Quiet. I told you to pack
that cooking outfit in the trunk.

42
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:39,844
Yeah? Well, I'm taking no chances.

43
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:44,481
If we can't pay our bill and the hotel
holds the trunks, we still eat.

44
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:47,645
And, baby, when you don't eat,
you lose a lot of calories.

45
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:50,188
Calories? What are they?

46
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:52,315
Oh, acrobats, you big sap.

47
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,690
- Well, I never got fat on your cooking.
- No?

48
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:57,320
You never got that complexion
from the Greeks.

49
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:59,626
- Don't talk to me like...
- Ixnay, ixnay.

50
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,769
- Leave us plenty of towels too.
- I did.

51
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:04,393
And I counted them.

52
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,301
How high can you count?

53
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:10,535
Well, everything's okay.
Will there be anything else?

54
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:12,574
Yeah, food.

55
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:20,310
I think he may stall for a tip. Get to the
window and give me the high sign.

56
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,912
Hank, I don't wanna do that.
Don't be such a cheapskate.

57
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:24,723
Screw.

58
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,925
Say, did they run out of everything
but dollar signs on this thing?

59
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:40,705
One coffee, one order of fried eggs.
There's two in an order, ain't they?

60
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:43,366
- Yep.
- And one order of rolls.

61
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,905
- Hank.
- Yes?

62
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:46,736
Come look at the elegant view.

63
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:49,577
Oh, that will be all, thank you.

64
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:57,313
Cup of coffee, order of rolls,
a couple of eggs.

65
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:00,150
It worked.

66
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,954
Oh, Queenie, New York.

67
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,562
The place we've dreamed
and talked about.

68
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,464
- Ain't it swell?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:11,366
But there's something about it
that scares me, Hank.

70
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:14,838
Scares you?
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of.

71
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:19,206
Well, it seems like we're taking
an awful chance.

72
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,644
We were getting along so well out west.

73
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:25,477
Plenty of work, small jumps,
a chance to save money.

74
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:28,545
And the act always went over big.

75
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:31,886
But here, nobody knows us.

76
00:07:32,193 --> 00:07:33,820
Oh, I'm afraid.

77
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,924
Now don't lose your nerve, honey.

78
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:38,563
But we haven't got much money.

79
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,725
Oh, Hank, couldn't we go back,
just for one more year?

80
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:44,598
Back to those opera houses
and town halls?

81
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:48,937
Those cheap hotels
and their lobby comics?

82
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,203
Cooking our own food...

83
00:07:53,414 --> 00:07:57,441
...washing our own clothes
and ironing them on mirrors.

84
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:02,420
Riding in those smelly day-coaches.

85
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,357
Going ragged all summer and then darn near
freezing in the winter. And why?

86
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:11,329
Just to save money enough
to get to New York and show our act.

87
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:12,762
Oh, honey.

88
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,766
With your looks and my ability...

89
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:19,868
I wouldn't steer you wrong.

90
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,506
Now don't worry.

91
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:26,238
You see that electric sign
of the fellow in BVDs?

92
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:27,846
- Yeah.
- Well, right there...

93
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:30,246
...they're gonna have
the Mahoney Sisters.

94
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,919
- In BVDs?
- Yes, in BVD...

95
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:38,191
Baby, they were plenty smart
when they made you beautiful.

96
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,859
Come on, let's get cleaned up
before Eddie gets here.

97
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:43,395
I'll run a tub for you.

98
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:52,263
The Mahoney Sisters in BVDs.

99
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:10,421
Hey, what are you singing?

100
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:11,923
The bubble song from Lux.

101
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:13,488
Will you join me?

102
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:15,618
No use of us both getting wet.

103
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,229
Will you wash mine?

104
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:21,323
I might as well. You never wash
anything but your neck.

105
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:29,638
I not only wash them.
I gotta pick them up.

106
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,506
Oh, Hank, I didn't think.

107
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,237
Oh, you never do.

108
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,440
Oh, don't strain yourself.
I'll get them.

109
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,481
Oh, boy, this is going to be good.

110
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,217
Oh, I'll go.

111
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:49,791
Can you imagine my embarrassment?

112
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,241
Uncle Jed!

113
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:13,580
Hello, honey. How are you?

114
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:15,585
- Fine, and you?
- Great.

115
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:19,489
- Gee, I'm glad to see you, Hank.
- Oh, Queenie, hurry up. It's Uncle Jed!

116
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:20,924
Uncle Jed?

117
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:22,422
I'll be right out.

118
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,223
What a break for you.

119
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:28,267
- I'll be with you in just a minute.
- All right, honey, but hurry.

120
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,164
What do you know, Uncle Jed?

121
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,676
I've got you booked for 30 weeks
over at the Manley Time.

122
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,874
Nothing doing.
We're in New York to stay.

123
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,448
Say, listen, girls...

124
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:49,352
...you know, I know this town better
than you do. And there are more sisters...

125
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,391
...doing their acts over the lunch counters
in New York than over the...

126
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:56,921
Than in the theaters.

127
00:10:57,398 --> 00:10:59,559
You're just a crapehanger.

128
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:04,235
Maybe, but let me tell you...

129
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:08,171
...tell you, tell you, tell you...

130
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:10,674
What's the name of that record
you're playing?

131
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:13,477
Say, listen, girls...

132
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,639
Yeah?

133
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:19,215
Well, what is it?

134
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,947
I love both you girls,
and I want to see you get along.

135
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:26,922
Sure, Uncle Jed, we know that.

136
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:32,255
But we aren't leaving this town till we
get a flash at Babe Ruth and Grant's Tomb.

137
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:37,235
- Oh, will you get that, Uncle Jed?
- You bet.

138
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,248
Oh, girls, your break... Your break...

139
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,214
Your coffee's here.

140
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:58,582
Bring the toothbrush glass
when you come.

141
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,353
- All right.
- Will you have some coffee, Uncle Jed?

142
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:04,896
No, thanks. I just had my breakf...
I just ate.

143
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:06,460
- Yeah?
- Uncle Jed!

144
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,259
Queenie!

145
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:11,202
Gosh, what a big girl you are.

146
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:14,830
- And so beautiful.
- Ain't she, though?

147
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:18,406
Well, I suppose you've decided
to stay in New York.

148
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,437
Yeah, we're all set.
But thanks for the offer, Uncle Jed.

149
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:24,583
That's all right.
I'll keep it open for a few days.

150
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,346
- All right.
- Goodbye.

151
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:31,449
- Oh, goodbye, Uncle Jed.
- If you wanna see me, just call me up.

152
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,819
Yeah, all right.
You're in the phone book?

153
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:35,657
You bet.

154
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:43,795
I think we're making an awful mistake
not to take that work.

155
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:48,402
I know what I'm doing.
We stand as big a chance as anybody else.

156
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:51,743
What did the Duncans have
when they hit Times Square?

157
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,675
"My Patio."

158
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:56,915
Say, we've got more than the Duncans
ever had.

159
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:59,776
Well, the Duncans are pretty good too.

160
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,819
Say, what'd we do to them
on the Gus Sun Time?

161
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:06,187
We knocked them off their seats.
Come in.

162
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:10,822
- Eddie!
- Hank!

163
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,495
Oh, baby.

164
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,736
Let me have a good look at you.

165
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,876
- Gee, but it's good to see you.
- Oh, boy, is it good to see you! Oh, gee!

166
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,906
That's my Queenie!

167
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:35,051
- Queenie? You don't mean to tell me it's...
- Sure.

168
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,519
Queenie, all grown up and everything.

169
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:40,855
Ain't she? That sisterly kiss
won't be so hard to take now.

170
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:42,458
I'll say it won't.

171
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,927
- Take it big.
- I did.

172
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:48,230
You were a funny-looking thing
the first time I saw you...

173
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:50,859
...with those gangly legs and freckles.

174
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:55,130
But you certainly turned out to be
a beautiful girl.

175
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:57,402
Well, I'll go get some clothes on.

176
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,713
I'm just crazy about her, Eddie.
She's so young and beautiful.

177
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,680
Of course she is.

178
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:10,790
Well, Hank, now that you're here,
when are we going to get married?

179
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:14,587
Oh, not till we've put this act over.
I'm gonna give Queenie a break.

180
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:17,922
Always doing something
for somebody else.

181
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:20,462
No wonder I love you.

182
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:23,900
- I kind of got a weakness for you too.
- Yeah?

183
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:25,694
Mrs. Eddie Kearns?

184
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,773
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

185
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:29,506
Swell, Eddie.

186
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:33,602
Yeah, and you can feature
that anytime in the electric lights.

187
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,552
- Gee, still the same sweet kid, ain't you?
- Why, certainly.

188
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,684
Hank, did you pack my new dress
in the trunk?

189
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,824
I'll get it for you in a minute.

190
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:48,222
Come here, Queenie.

191
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:54,596
- Gee, I can't get over how she's changed.
- Well, you sure look elegant, Eddie.

192
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:56,762
- Doesn't he, Hank?
- He's an eyeful.

193
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:58,531
Three carats.

194
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,137
Platinum.

195
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:03,639
And here's the payoff.
Look, but don't laugh.

196
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:05,911
Gold garters!

197
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,408
Oh, Eddie, I always knew
you'd make good.

198
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:13,213
Yeah, and I ain't forgetting that you're the
little girl that made me come to New York.

199
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:16,413
Remember when I wanted to quit
and give the whole thing up...

200
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,423
...and you made me stick it out?

201
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,790
Well, now I'm gonna do
something for you.

202
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,762
Zanfield's bought my new song,
"The Broadway Melody."

203
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:26,798
And he's naming his revue after it.

204
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:30,802
- But I've already spoken to him about you.
- You think we've got a chance?

205
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:34,203
Chance? Don't be silly.
One word from me, and you're in.

206
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:37,468
- Queenie, ain't that great?
- Sure, if it's true.

207
00:15:37,544 --> 00:15:40,308
True? You don't know
how I stand with Zanfield.

208
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:43,211
- If we're in, what do we do?
- When do we start?

209
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,816
And how much do we get?

210
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:47,887
You're gonna sing
my "Broadway Melody" with me.

211
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:50,554
The Mahoney Sisters and Eddie Kearns.

212
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:53,558
Yeah, Eddie Kearns
and the Mahoney Sisters.

213
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:55,924
Well, how does it go?

214
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:59,892
How's it go? Now, listen, I sing a verse,
and you come in on the chorus.

215
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,294
Then we do another chorus,
and then go into a little dance.

216
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,371
- Give us an idea of the dance.
- I'll give you an idea.

217
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:57,717
- Good?
- Swell, Eddie, do it again.

218
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,486
Let's move back this table, kids.
We'll do our dance.

219
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:35,889
All ready, girls?

220
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:38,664
Come on, now, let's go.
There you are.

221
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,733
Queenie, why don't you look at my feet?

222
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:45,835
Look at her.

223
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:50,308
Attagirl!

224
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,675
You like that?

225
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,731
Don't do that.

226
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,544
Don't do that!

227
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:31,708
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!

228
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:35,279
- What's the matter with the left leg?
- I've got a headache.

229
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:37,583
Go on, sit down,
take a load off your mind.

230
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:42,525
- Don't talk to me like that. I don't feel well.
- Listen, don't answer me back, understand?

231
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:44,593
Come here.

232
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:48,594
There's Eddie. Hello, hey!

233
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:51,533
Your rhythm is all wrong.
Nothing like I showed you.

234
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:53,298
All right, now watch.

235
00:18:57,878 --> 00:18:59,937
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, how are you?

236
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,216
We had a tough time getting in!
When do we show the act?

237
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,840
In a few minutes.

238
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:07,652
I haven't had a chance
to talk to Zanfield yet.

239
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:09,653
- It's okay, ain't it?
- We're in?

240
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,122
Sure, it's in the bank.

241
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:15,151
- Whatever I say goes.
- Hey, Kearns!

242
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,491
Yes, sir?

243
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:23,497
We don't wanna take all afternoon
to set one dance.

244
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,830
Yes, sir.

245
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:27,333
Maybe we'd better get undressed.
Come on.

246
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,370
All right, Sam, let it go.

247
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:37,443
- Oh, George.
- Wait a minute, hold it there. Hold it, Sam.

248
00:19:37,617 --> 00:19:40,381
The sets are all ready
for your okay, Mr. Zanfield.

249
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:42,955
That's just an idea
of what it's gonna be.

250
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,884
I can see that. It's just an idea.

251
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:47,888
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

252
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,390
But don't worry, I'll fix it.

253
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,724
- Okay on those sets.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:57,770
Remind me to see that rehearsal
in the morning. Make a note of that.

255
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:00,134
I'm having lunch at the Knickerbocker.

256
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:05,210
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, this material, I couldn't
get it in the gold design, only in the silver.

257
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:08,939
- Isn't it lovely?
- It's fine. Get it in the gold.

258
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,683
- Remember, I want that in the gold.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:16,585
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, pardon me, will you take
a look at the Mahoney Sisters right now?

260
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:19,453
- The Maloney Sisters?
- No, the Mahoney Sisters.

261
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,652
- Who are they? I never heard of them.
- It's the sister act I told you about.

262
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:26,596
- Where are they?
- Right over there, across stage.

263
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:48,845
All right, wheel them in.

264
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:52,919
- Tell George I'll take a look at the act.
- Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.

265
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:57,629
Well, kids, you all set?
Got your music?

266
00:20:57,797 --> 00:21:00,425
Well, go over there and tell him
what you want.

267
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,926
The Baloney Sisters.

268
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:10,699
Give us the introduction pickup
and some choruses. And swell to the finish.

269
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,641
- But you follow us.
- Yes, ma'am.

270
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:16,215
Sam, looks like some carnival
lost a good act.

271
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:23,181
I'm gonna lay that dame
like a roll of linoleum.

272
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:27,316
- Hank, you can't pull that around here.
- Hank, don't start anything now.

273
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,793
- Get her in the dressing room.
- Sure. Now, come on. Get together.

274
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,426
- All set now?
- Oh, wait a minute.

275
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,928
- Don't mind if I put this down?
- No, ma'am.

276
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:39,967
I'll vamp till ready, and don't forget:
We do things intimately.

277
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,198
- All set.
- All set, fine. Babies, smack it over big.

278
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:48,177
You ain't got nothing to worry about.
You're as good as in now.

279
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:51,148
- I'll go and see how the boss likes it.
- All right.

280
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:53,181
Well, all right, shoot.

281
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:19,871
- Play it, will you?
- Something wrong with the piano.

282
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:23,438
- Do I have to come over and play it for you?
- Okay, go ahead.

283
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:37,695
What's the matter with them?

284
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:40,357
There's something wrong with the piano.

285
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:43,925
- Say, are you trying to crab our act?
- No, I'm not.

286
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:47,569
- Well, will you play it then, hot or cold?
- Well, go ahead then.

287
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,601
All right. All right, girls.

288
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:55,940
Mr. Zanfield's seen enough.
He'll let you know. Come in next Friday.

289
00:22:56,216 --> 00:23:00,710
- But he ain't seen the finish yet.
- Yes. I know, all right. Line up, girls.

290
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:04,721
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, please give them a break.
You haven't seen their act.

291
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:06,621
I saw enough.

292
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,590
I can use the blond,
but that little cluck is out.

293
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,322
But don't you know it's tough
to put comedy over on a bare stage?

294
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:17,825
They'll be all right at the performance.
Give them another chance.

295
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:19,433
I know, Eddie.

296
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:24,736
Gee, kid, that's a tough break. Even if the
act is a louse, he should've seen the finish.

297
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:26,743
It ain't a louse. It's a good act.

298
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,179
We stopped the show
every performance we did for Jake Wells.

299
00:23:30,317 --> 00:23:32,877
Yeah, the one I saw would stop a tank.

300
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:36,212
Say, you've been asking for trouble,
and now you're gonna get it.

301
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:40,689
You great big peroxide-headed dizzy blond,
you! What do you think of this act?

302
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,821
Hey, come here! Come here, girls!

303
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:47,890
Come here!

304
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:53,630
Let me at her, will you?
Let me at her!

305
00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:56,574
Next time I'll give you a facial
instead of a scalp treatment.

306
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,702
- Yeah, and I'll fix you, you little peanut.
- Let go of me!

307
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:03,508
- Oh, boy, I'll sock her...
- Stop it, Hank, you're crabbing everything.

308
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:05,878
Go get your clothes on.
I'll fix everything.

309
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:10,121
The big blond baboon! Why'd she pick
on me? I didn't start any fight with her.

310
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:12,247
- Where's my music?
- Here's your music.

311
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:15,883
- Well, where's my bag?
- Now, be quiet. Be quiet, Hank!

312
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:20,188
Get in there. Straighten it out.
Let's get smart, Sam. Where are you?

313
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,324
Don't let them throw you
up in the air.

314
00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:26,200
I'm not gonna waste all day at it.
Give me a pickup and two choruses.

315
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:31,242
And let me tell you dames something:
If I get ahold of her, I'll rip her wide open.

316
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,676
Flo, what was the trouble about?

317
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:38,909
- I was beside the piano, not doing a thing...
- Wait a minute.

318
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:41,812
- I can't stand for quarreling.
- I didn't start it.

319
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:45,516
Never mind who started it. Now
run along and be a good little girl.

320
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,559
- Oh, all right.
- And remember, no more quarreling.

321
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:54,791
- Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
- Well?

322
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,329
I heard what you said about me.

323
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:01,872
Please, couldn't you use the both of us
at the same salary?

324
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:05,835
I might.
I think I can slip her in somewhere.

325
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,546
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Zanfield!
- All right.

326
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,315
My sister is the business manager
of the act.

327
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:21,452
You won't let on that it ain't
the both of us you want, will you?

328
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:22,992
Of course not.

329
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:26,665
- You send her over, and I'll talk to her.
- Oh, thank you!

330
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,297
All right.

331
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,503
Oh, Hank!

332
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:39,803
He can take his old show and put it
where it'll do him the most good!

333
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:43,313
Don't act like that, Hank.
He didn't see your act, that's all.

334
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,475
- He's a very busy man.
- Oh, he's busy?

335
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:48,313
Well, so am I busy,
with 30 weeks waiting for me.

336
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,219
- Now, don't get so excited over nothing.
- Hank, quick!

337
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:52,881
Mr. Zanfield wants to see you.

338
00:25:53,193 --> 00:25:55,286
- Oh, yeah?
- On the level?

339
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,362
- Maybe we're in after all.
- Sure!

340
00:25:57,497 --> 00:26:02,127
Let me handle this. I can always take care
of these things better with nobody around.

341
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:04,133
I'll talk to him.

342
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,502
All right, girls, we'll take this right from
the beginning. Okay, Sam, let it go.

343
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,433
I heard what you said to Zanny.

344
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:16,747
- You won't let on to Hank, will you, Eddie?
- Of course not.

345
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,851
Gee, that was wonderful of you,
Queenie.

346
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:23,545
I could kiss you for that.

347
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:33,756
You mustn't do that, Eddie.

348
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,264
I guess I shouldn't.

349
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:39,294
I never realized you were...

350
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,874
Gee, you're the sweetest little girl
I ever knew.

351
00:26:45,745 --> 00:26:47,975
You mean next to Hank.

352
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:51,212
Yeah, sure.

353
00:26:52,252 --> 00:26:56,245
You know, Hank's been everything
in the world to me.

354
00:26:56,422 --> 00:27:02,361
She's looked after me and worked for me,
and fought for me, protected me.

355
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:07,228
I could never repay her
for all her love and care.

356
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,592
Of course you love her, Queenie.

357
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:12,704
And you're gonna be everything
that she wants you to be.

358
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,364
And I don't blame her for loving you.

359
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:19,710
Gee, but you're a cute kid.

360
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,941
And she loves you, Eddie.

361
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:27,445
I guess you and me are about all
she ever thinks of.

362
00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:32,854
Oh, I never wanna hurt her, Eddie.
And I want her to be happy with you.

363
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:36,860
Why, Queenie, I'd rather lose my pipes
so I couldn't sing...

364
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:41,497
...and go lame so I couldn't dance
than to hurt Hank.

365
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:43,761
- Sure you would. So would I.
- Can you imagine?

366
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:46,633
- We're in! Rehearsal in the morning!
- That's great!

367
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:49,832
- I knew you'd put it over, Hank!
- Oh, just leave it to me!

368
00:27:49,943 --> 00:27:53,435
I ain't booked acts for 10 years
and not know how to handle them!

369
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,946
- You bet you haven't!
- You're both swell kids!

370
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:58,511
- And plenty smart!
- And how!

371
00:27:58,585 --> 00:28:01,679
- Gee, rehearsal in the morning! Ain't it great?
- Yeah!

372
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:04,449
Come on.
I got a lot of washing and ironing to do.

373
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:08,152
- You have?
- I want you to look your best, honey.

374
00:28:08,328 --> 00:28:11,627
But tell me, how did you put it over?
What did you say to him?

375
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:16,359
I said to him, "Now, you listen here,
Mr. Zanfield, this is a sister team.

376
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:18,336
And we splits up for nobody!"

377
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:21,132
And with that,
he smiled as nice as you please...

378
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:24,469
...and said, "That's all right, Miss Maloney."

379
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:28,570
Can you imagine calling me Maloney?
And everybody knows our name's Mahoney.

380
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:31,240
- Yeah, can you imagine that?
- Imagine that.

381
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,816
"Maloney"!

382
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,639
Hey, come on and get those
clothes on, will you?

383
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:58,174
- Hurry up!
- Well, are we all set?

384
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:01,212
Yes, sir, everything ready to go
when you say the word.

385
00:29:01,347 --> 00:29:02,837
All right.

386
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:05,250
- Are you safe up there, Audrey?
- Okay.

387
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:06,818
Yes, that's perfectly safe.

388
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,614
- You get the orchestra in the pit.
- Yes, sir.

389
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:11,589
- Oh, Hagerty.
- Yes?

390
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:15,585
- That looks very good.
- I think it'll be very effective.

391
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:18,255
- So do I.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:23,432
Can you imagine? Putting on all this makeup
for just one show a day?

393
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,805
Oh, dear! I'm just shaky all over.

394
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:30,804
Queenie, will you stop?
You're getting me nervous now.

395
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:34,441
It ain't a bit different
than it was in Reading, PA.

396
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,571
And we're going over just as big.

397
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:40,947
- Oh, Hank, do you think so?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.

398
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,123
- Are you decent, girls?
- Yeah, come in.

399
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:46,282
Oh, Hank, get a load of this.

400
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:50,153
"Big mammoth appearance
of the Mahoney Sisters on Broadway.

401
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:53,896
Zanfield saw them once,
and they were in.

402
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:58,267
With appreciation and regards
to our agent, Uncle Jed."

403
00:29:58,404 --> 00:30:00,668
- Is that a pippin or not?
- You care for that?

404
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,331
- Do I?
- Hank, will you get Eddie out of here?

405
00:30:03,576 --> 00:30:05,339
I'm nervous!

406
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:07,140
What's eating her?

407
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,911
Eddie, you gotta run along now.
We're nervous.

408
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,581
I get you.

409
00:30:18,257 --> 00:30:20,452
Now, Queenie, don't be nervous.

410
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:24,324
- Remember, this is your big opportunity.
- Will you get out of here?

411
00:30:24,464 --> 00:30:27,922
- Beat it, Eddie, will you?
- Now, don't forget, a lot depends on this.

412
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:30,167
- Oh, get out!
- Get out!

413
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:40,045
Stop, stop! Girls, girls!

414
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:43,306
- Be careful of my hats!
- We gotta get down on the stage!

415
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:45,713
I don't care!
I won't allow you to ruin them.

416
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,615
I told you they were
too high and too wide.

417
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:52,691
Well, big woman, I design
the costumes for the show...

418
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:54,622
...not the doors for the theater.

419
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:58,253
I know that. If you had,
they'd have been done in lavender.

420
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,806
Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield, but the orchestra's
killing my "Broadway Melody" number.

421
00:31:14,947 --> 00:31:18,815
- Too much brass. They can't hear me.
- Kearns, tell them to keep it down.

422
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:21,215
Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.

423
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:24,417
- All right, boys, I think we can go.
- Yes, sir!

424
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,724
Hey, you!

425
00:31:31,864 --> 00:31:35,595
When you get through with that noise,
try and play my number.

426
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:39,136
Cut out the brass,
and keep it very piano.

427
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,671
Are you back again?

428
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,434
Yes, and I'm telling you
how I want my music played.

429
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:46,406
I've conducted opera.
What do you know about music?

430
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:49,937
- Nothing. I only wrote it, that's all.
- Then you have the best of me.

431
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:51,546
You don't have to listen.

432
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:54,311
I'll tell Zanny what a sap he was
for buying it.

433
00:31:54,453 --> 00:31:57,183
Maybe he'll get you
to write the music for the show.

434
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:59,154
If I couldn't do better than this...

435
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,783
If you could,
you wouldn't be waving a stick!

436
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:06,322
Electrician!
A little more this way with that spotlight.

437
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:09,298
What are you trying to do,
ruin my profile?

438
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:11,800
Your profile was ruined the day
you were born.

439
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:16,341
That's a smart crack.
Hit me with it and keep it here.

440
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:19,602
Hey, put that spotlight
over here on this girl!

441
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:23,313
- He wants it over there.
- But it goes over here.

442
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:26,850
That spotlight goes here.
I can't sing without a spotlight.

443
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,620
Say, you couldn't sing
if you had a searchlight.

444
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:32,781
- Did you get everything you wanted?
- Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield.

445
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:35,826
Would you okay this bill
for Miss William's second act?

446
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:40,563
What's the idea? Two grand for a coat worn
for less than three minutes? I won't pay it!

447
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:42,601
But you said ermine.

448
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,671
You'll giggle yourself
right out of here one day.

449
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:48,468
Yes, sir.

450
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:52,237
- It's a gorgeous garment, isn't it?
- Isn't it gorgeous?

451
00:32:52,378 --> 00:32:57,247
In fact, it's the gorgeous-est thing
I have ever seen. You sweet little cutie!

452
00:32:57,416 --> 00:33:00,385
- There you are.
- Thank you, Mr. Zanfield.

453
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:02,953
- Come here, Unconscious.
- Hello, boys.

454
00:33:03,256 --> 00:33:07,386
Say, Joe LeBlanc saw the rehearsal,
and he says there's a fortune in the show.

455
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:11,257
- Yes, sir!
- We ought to know. We put it in.

456
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,729
- You think it's a good show then, Zanny?
- It's just an oil well.

457
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,461
- Let's see your gusher.
- Looks like a mine to me.

458
00:33:17,637 --> 00:33:19,832
From all the gold-diggers
you got in the troupe.

459
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:25,575
Any old time one of them can pry a nugget
off of his ledge, they're going some!

460
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:27,909
Come on, Unconscious, put the load down.

461
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:31,849
Overture, girls.
This is the "Broadway Melody" number.

462
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,685
Get out of here and hurry up.

463
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:38,814
Come on. Come on. Get out of here.
Come on. Go on, get out.

464
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:42,853
Oh, there's the overture.
Oh, where's my hat?

465
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:44,687
Where's my hat?

466
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,162
Where's my hat?
Oh, where's my hat?!

467
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:49,598
- Over there!
- Over where?

468
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:52,737
- On the floor, under the clothes.
- Oh, yes. The clothes carton.

469
00:33:52,805 --> 00:33:55,899
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
And make it snappy.

470
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,800
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

471
00:33:57,944 --> 00:34:00,674
Now, honey, remember:
The dress rehearsal is tougher...

472
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:03,440
...than a first-night performance.
So don't be nervous.

473
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:05,447
- I'm not nervous.
- Neither am I.

474
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:11,222
No, it's over that shoulder.
That's the idea.

475
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:13,349
More. With those beads.

476
00:34:13,826 --> 00:34:16,920
That's it. That's better.
That's the idea. In this...

477
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:26,805
All right! Out of the way.
Clear the way.

478
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,834
Elgin, call a doctor.

479
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:32,338
Elgin! Call a doctor! Elgin!

480
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:36,577
What are we gonna do?

481
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:50,181
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold it!

482
00:35:50,456 --> 00:35:52,822
That number's too slow.
Cut out the Maloney Sisters.

483
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,820
- Cut out the whole first chorus?
- Yes.

484
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,889
Why, has he cut us out altogether?

485
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,529
Ain't it awful, the way
they cut out these big stars?

486
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,634
I'll get to you in a minute.

487
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:05,532
Listen here, Mr. Zanfield,
you can't cut us out like that.

488
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:07,263
We've got equity contract.

489
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,967
Kearns, go into the dance
on the first chorus and end it there.

490
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:14,735
One more cut for you, dearie,
and you'll be holding a spear.

491
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:18,542
And one more crack from you, bimbo,
and you'll be holding a lily.

492
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:20,312
Listen to me, Mr. Zanfield, we...

493
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:23,854
Keep quiet. Will you cut it out
and give me a chance to do my number?

494
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:26,751
But he cut us out of the whole show.
He can't do that.

495
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:54,431
Did you hear that, Mr. Zanfield?
They're trying to drown me out.

496
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:58,270
- Are you trying to drown him out?
- We're doing our best.

497
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,203
Mr. Zanfield, would you come backstage
a moment? It's very important.

498
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:05,545
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

499
00:39:10,623 --> 00:39:11,681
What's the trouble now?

500
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:14,384
The other dame flopped.
How about this one?

501
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:21,330
No, sir.

502
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,594
- Terrible.
- What are we gonna do about her?

503
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:27,763
There he is now.
I'm gonna give that guy an earful.

504
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:30,407
Where's that blond McGinty sister?
Use her.

505
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:33,706
Mahoney's the name,
and let me tell you something...

506
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:36,311
Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
I'll get her up there.

507
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:39,715
You may not know it, but we've
played some of the very best...

508
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,480
Listen, we want you
on the prow of that boat.

509
00:39:42,621 --> 00:39:44,680
Come on now.
Let's get your clothes off.

510
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:47,291
But I don't want
to take my clothes off.

511
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:48,960
No, that'll be all right.

512
00:39:49,194 --> 00:39:52,220
But listen to me. I've never taken
my clothes off in my life.

513
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:53,965
I know all about that. Come on.

514
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:56,930
- How've you got this thing hooked?
- I don't know.

515
00:39:57,236 --> 00:39:59,329
Over here.

516
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:02,631
Say, do I get that spot, or don't I?

517
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,378
That's tough. I missed him.

518
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:15,685
- How's everything going, Zanny?
- Very smoothly. Very, very smoothly.

519
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:17,550
- That's fine.
- Great.

520
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:19,156
Sit down with us.

521
00:42:31,657 --> 00:42:33,625
Oh, Jules. Jules.

522
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:37,126
I like that number.
That's a very good arrangement.

523
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:39,389
How do you do it?
Where do you pick them?

524
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:40,862
I guess it's just a gift.

525
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,896
By the way, what's the name
of that little beauty on the boat?

526
00:42:44,203 --> 00:42:45,864
Ask her.
It'll give you something to do.

527
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:48,571
- That's a great idea.
- Come on, Unconscious.

528
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:50,504
Yes, sir.

529
00:42:51,143 --> 00:42:53,338
- You were great, Mahoney.
- I'll say you were.

530
00:42:53,512 --> 00:42:56,743
- You'll be in a Rolls-Royce by Thursday.
- Go on.

531
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:59,579
What a flock of Johns will
be waiting at that stage door!

532
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:02,345
- Go on. You can't kid me.
- I'm not kidding you.

533
00:43:02,521 --> 00:43:04,716
I may be there myself.

534
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:07,849
- Oh, Queenie.
- Go in and change.

535
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,288
Hank, did you see Queenie?

536
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:14,755
What's the matter, Hank?
Aren't you happy?

537
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:18,298
Wasn't Queenie great?
Aren't you proud of her?

538
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:22,205
Of course, Eddie.
I'm glad to see her make good.

539
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:26,710
Oh, but gee, we ain't never had
to get by on our legs before.

540
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:28,904
Oh, that don't mean nothing, Hank.

541
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:32,274
Those guys are not gonna pay 10 bucks
to look at your face.

542
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:33,907
This is Broadway.

543
00:43:34,253 --> 00:43:37,313
Yeah. Broad's way.

544
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:41,319
Now, run along and change.
I'll get Queenie.

545
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,391
Attagirl.

546
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:49,431
Queenie, everybody is raving about you.

547
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:53,504
- Gee, but you're a beautiful kid.
- I'm glad you like me, Eddie.

548
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:57,632
Like you? Oh, boy. When I got a peek
at you up there on that boat...

549
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:01,336
- Isn't this the beautiful lady of the boat?
- Yes.

550
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,879
- Kearns. They're waiting for you.
- Yes, sir.

551
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:08,485
- I'm Jock Warriner.
- How do you do?

552
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,589
- And this is Stew and Bay.
- How do you do?

553
00:44:11,757 --> 00:44:16,353
I bet them that the most beautiful girl
in New York will have supper with us.

554
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:20,224
- You've got to help me win that bet.
- What have I got to do with that?

555
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:24,633
- Well, you see, you're the girl.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

556
00:44:27,472 --> 00:44:30,930
- I guess we win that bet, Jock.
- Now, wait a minute. Not yet.

557
00:44:31,243 --> 00:44:34,644
- Hey, Unconscious, where you going?
- I'm gonna get on that boat.

558
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,943
Come here, sap. You can't get on that.
That's not a real boat.

559
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,652
Please.
Please, won't you change your mind?

560
00:44:43,221 --> 00:44:47,385
- I'm sorry, but really, I can't.
- Oh, come on. Please do.

561
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:50,993
- No. Not tonight.
- No?

562
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:59,266
- Come on. Slip us the 50.
- Wait a minute. I haven't lost yet.

563
00:44:59,404 --> 00:45:01,804
Oh, yeah...?
Come here, Unconscious, come here.

564
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,899
You can't go up there, you'll get kicked out.
It's a ladies' dressing room.

565
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:10,307
- Let's go on the boat.
- On the boat. Get out of here.

566
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:19,646
Don't worry, Hank.
They only cut one number.

567
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,884
We got a couple of others.

568
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:27,288
"Zanny saw them once,
and they were in."

569
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:29,599
Zanny saw me once, and I was out.

570
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:32,363
Not altogether. And what of it?

571
00:45:32,504 --> 00:45:34,233
Yeah, I know.

572
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:39,366
Do you think that's all I'll get to do,
go on without any clothes on?

573
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:42,275
Not if I can help it.
But you don't need to worry.

574
00:45:42,414 --> 00:45:44,882
You got a lot more on
when you ain't got anything...

575
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:47,549
...than most of the dames
I've seen around here.

576
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:52,254
Well, I guess I'll go get
undressed again.

577
00:45:58,363 --> 00:45:59,955
Come in.

578
00:46:00,365 --> 00:46:02,833
- Hello, kids. Are you all ready?
- Yep. All ready.

579
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,571
Well, listen. Zanny is giving
a big party at his apartment tonight.

580
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:10,163
- Let's go over.
- Gee, that's great. Did he invite us?

581
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:14,539
Not exactly, but what's the difference?
Ain't I the star of this troupe?

582
00:46:14,613 --> 00:46:16,672
That guy threw me out
of your song tonight.

583
00:46:16,882 --> 00:46:20,249
I ain't gonna give him a chance
to throw me out of a window.

584
00:46:20,385 --> 00:46:25,254
Let's get a bowl of chop suey,
and we'll rewrite the show.

585
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:28,757
If it'll write me back in the show,
I'd go for a bowl of anything.

586
00:46:28,894 --> 00:46:32,330
Well, you can get most anything
out of a bowl of chop suey.

587
00:46:32,464 --> 00:46:33,897
Oh, cutie!

588
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:36,298
Come on, Queenie.

589
00:46:37,402 --> 00:46:38,835
You two run along.

590
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:42,670
I've got some things to do,
and I'll join you later.

591
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:45,535
Why, what's the matter?

592
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:49,636
Well, I've...
I've got an awful headache.

593
00:46:49,781 --> 00:46:52,750
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll go straight home if you'd rather.

594
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:56,854
Oh, no, Hank. You two run along.
You'll have a lot of fun, anyway.

595
00:46:57,222 --> 00:47:00,714
Come on, Queenie.
We don't wanna go without you.

596
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:03,724
Get your hat. You'll feel better
when you get out of here.

597
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:05,695
Oh, sure, honey, come on.

598
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:08,690
I can't go.

599
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:13,430
- You got a date with somebody, huh?
- Of course not.

600
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:17,701
- Who, Queenie? You're crazy.
- Crazy, am I?

601
00:47:17,943 --> 00:47:20,878
You've got a date
with that Jock Warriner, I'll bet.

602
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:24,478
- Well, and what if I have?
- Well, I don't like it.

603
00:47:24,616 --> 00:47:27,141
Oh, you can't go out with that bird.

604
00:47:27,285 --> 00:47:30,379
I'll have to show you
whether I can or not.

605
00:47:32,657 --> 00:47:34,386
Come in.

606
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,291
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

607
00:47:37,362 --> 00:47:40,820
Well, here I am again.
You can't get rid of me.

608
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:43,863
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Warriner.
- All right.

609
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:52,742
Maybe you had better wait for me
just a few minutes down on the stage.

610
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:54,946
- Shall I wait at the stage door?
- Please.

611
00:47:55,147 --> 00:47:56,705
- Now, don't be long.
- No, I won't.

612
00:47:56,982 --> 00:47:58,847
- Hurry.
- I will.

613
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,616
Now, Queenie, don't act this way.

614
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,924
He ain't the right kind of a guy
for you to go out with.

615
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,166
What difference does it make
what kind of a guy he is?

616
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:20,704
I'm going out with him because I...
Well, because I want to.

617
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,467
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.

618
00:48:23,608 --> 00:48:25,599
You're not! You're gonna listen to me.

619
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:29,612
I can take care of myself. And you
can both mind your own business.

620
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:38,689
Why don't you mind your sister?
She knows best.

621
00:48:38,857 --> 00:48:40,347
You keep out of this.

622
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:43,756
I've got my own life to live,
and I'm gonna live it.

623
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:50,598
I'm not gonna be the third wheel
to anybody's bicycle!

624
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,467
Oh, Queenie!

625
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,333
Oh, Eddie, what'll we do?

626
00:48:58,543 --> 00:49:01,205
Why, she's never gone
against my advice before.

627
00:49:01,346 --> 00:49:04,577
Don't worry, Hank. She's only a kid.
She'll snap out of it.

628
00:49:04,749 --> 00:49:07,718
I guess the bright lights
got under her skin.

629
00:49:07,853 --> 00:49:10,583
Come on, let's go
and get a bowl of chili.

630
00:49:31,443 --> 00:49:32,842
Queenie!

631
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,776
- Oh, you didn't go. You didn't go!
- I couldn't, Hank.

632
00:49:39,918 --> 00:49:43,251
Oh, dear! I'm so glad.

633
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:58,955
Oh, they're elegant.

634
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:02,792
- Yeah. Where do I park them?
- Wait a minute. Put them over there.

635
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:38,225
Good morning, beautiful lady.

636
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:40,598
Oh, you frightened me.

637
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:42,569
Good morning.

638
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:48,539
- Oh, they're elegant. Thanks.
- Just a little birthday card.

639
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:53,108
Yes, well, they're lovely.
You'll excuse me now?

640
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:59,749
You have some place to go, haven't you?

641
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:02,222
Are you putting me out?

642
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:05,422
What's the matter?
Don't you like the flowers?

643
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:10,661
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- They're not half so beautiful as you.

644
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:14,303
Any girl that can look beautiful
so early in the morning...

645
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,532
That sounds like you know
a lot about girls.

646
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:18,337
I do. I'm an expert.

647
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,842
- Much obliged for the compliment.
- You're welcome.

648
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:22,511
Well, so long.

649
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:25,445
- Must I go?
- Please do.

650
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:30,577
- And thank you for being so nice to me.
- Not half so nice as I'd like to be.

651
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:34,283
I'm arranging a little party tonight
for your birthday.

652
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:36,154
- A party for me?
- Yes.

653
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,819
Come in.
But you mustn't do that.

654
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:40,188
- But why not?
- Because I don't want you to.

655
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:42,831
That's silly. Everything's arranged.
You must come.

656
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:44,858
Please don't.
Hello, Eddie.

657
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:46,898
- Hello, Queenie.
- Oh, hello.

658
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:50,504
- How are you? Where's Hank?
- She's out.

659
00:51:50,642 --> 00:51:53,702
Then I'm gonna wait right here
till she gets back.

660
00:51:57,482 --> 00:52:00,383
Well, it looks as if I'd better
take the air.

661
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:03,481
I'll give you a ring a little later,
shall I?

662
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:04,883
Fine.

663
00:52:16,368 --> 00:52:18,768
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

664
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:24,899
And thank you again for the flowers.

665
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:30,479
Well, I've got my suspicions about
any guy that kisses a girl's hand.

666
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:34,880
- What do you mean?
- He'll give you a ring later.

667
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:38,883
He'll give you a ring.
On the telephone, but not here.

668
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,657
What are you burned up about?

669
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:43,385
- He hasn't done anything to you.
- No.

670
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:47,589
- And what's more, he ain't going to.
- Sit down and cool off.

671
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:51,259
Hank'll be here in a minute,
and you can start raving to her.

672
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:57,264
Oh, Eddie, don't be such a crab.

673
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:15,958
Why do you let a guy like that
hang around you?

674
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:20,790
Say, will you lay off him? I'm sick
of hearing you crab all the time.

675
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:26,333
- I'll give him a sock in the nose.
- You and how many others?

676
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:29,134
I don't need any others.
I can do it all by myself.

677
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:31,299
What do you think of that?

678
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:36,370
I know. But you haven't anything
to do in the show.

679
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:41,177
I can team you up with this blond
and still book you as the Mahoney Sisters.

680
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:44,346
Nope. I've gotta stick around
and keep an eye on Queenie.

681
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:46,989
Queenie? What has she been doing?

682
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:50,854
She's changed, Uncle Jed.
She don't tell me things anymore.

683
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:54,154
Night after night,
she's out with Jock Warriner.

684
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:58,599
If it wasn't for Queenie,
I'd be the happiest girl in the world.

685
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,533
With Eddie?

686
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:06,402
Now, now listen, Hank.

687
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:10,604
Why don't you give Eddie a break
and marry him?

688
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:13,617
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe.

689
00:54:13,752 --> 00:54:16,619
Maybe that's just what Queenie needs:

690
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:20,486
- To see you and Eddie happy.
- Do you think so?

691
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:25,187
It's exactly what
I've been trying to... Sure!

692
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,798
- You see, it's very simple.
- Rolling his own.

693
00:58:24,936 --> 00:58:27,928
That's it.
Now, watch this one.

694
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:39,777
Boy, if you could do that
with my wife.

695
00:58:40,151 --> 00:58:42,915
Say, give us something good,
something new.

696
00:58:43,221 --> 00:58:46,315
Say, can you pull a rabbit from that?

697
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,190
Hello, everybody.

698
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:57,360
- I brought the radio with me.
- Joe, what have you got there?

699
00:58:57,535 --> 00:59:00,800
- Gee, I can get Chicago with that.
- Chicago? Why, that's nothing.

700
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:04,464
- I got Scotland last night.
- How do you know you got Scotland?

701
00:59:04,609 --> 00:59:09,171
Why, I heard the guy singing
"The Best Things in Life Are Free."

702
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:17,185
Take this cake in the other room,
and when you hear us yell "surprise"...

703
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:20,119
...bring it back lighted.
Now, don't forget.

704
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:24,194
Hey, give me a few of those things.
Give me a few of them.

705
00:59:25,797 --> 00:59:28,391
Someone's coming. Are you all set?

706
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:30,397
Quiet, quiet.

707
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:33,566
Surprise!

708
00:59:33,705 --> 00:59:36,333
Surprise! Surprise!

709
00:59:39,277 --> 00:59:42,269
- Well, where's Queenie?
- Yeah, where's Queenie?

710
00:59:42,513 --> 00:59:46,847
Why, there was another party,
and I forgot to tell her about this one.

711
00:59:47,118 --> 00:59:50,417
I thought she'd have more fun there.
I'm sorry.

712
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:56,184
Jock Warriner, huh.

713
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,590
Say, listen, I've got an idea.

714
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,391
Let's give the party...

715
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:02,897
Let's give the party...

716
01:00:03,301 --> 01:00:05,531
- For Hank.
- Great!

717
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:10,430
Wait a minute, folks.
Just a second.

718
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:13,634
Take all the things down to my room.
We'll hold our party there.

719
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:15,369
Hank doesn't feel very well.

720
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,280
Well, all right,
we'll go down to your room.

721
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:28,155
Good night. I hope you feel better.

722
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,522
Look, Hank, I'm awfully sorry.

723
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:35,126
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- I left a present for you.

724
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:38,929
- I hope you're feeling better, Hank.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

725
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,830
You see what you're missing?

726
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:47,200
Why don't you have a little drink?
It might buck you up.

727
01:00:50,448 --> 01:00:52,814
- Good night, Hankie.
- Good night, Uncle Jed.

728
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:54,345
Good night, dear.

729
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:16,135
Hey, Eddie.
Ain't you coming down?

730
01:01:16,274 --> 01:01:20,142
You run along, Jed.
I've got to tell Hank something.

731
01:01:20,311 --> 01:01:22,302
- I'll see you in a little while.
- Sure.

732
01:01:22,613 --> 01:01:26,947
But don't make it too long. You know
that bottle won't last very long.

733
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:39,262
Queenie and me have always been
on the level.

734
01:01:39,397 --> 01:01:41,558
And now I'm fronting for her.

735
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:46,362
Won't you please give her
all the best of the breaks?

736
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,766
What's the matter, Hank?

737
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:58,138
I lost something.

738
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:08,116
Oh, Eddie.
At least I've still got you.

739
01:02:08,259 --> 01:02:10,284
That's one break.

740
01:02:20,438 --> 01:02:22,338
Goodbye, baby.

741
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:42,358
Happy birthday.

742
01:03:28,406 --> 01:03:31,398
Queenie, aren't you
having a good time?

743
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:33,907
I'm having a marvelous time,
Mr. Warriner.

744
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:36,772
Now don't call me Mr. Warriner.

745
01:03:36,948 --> 01:03:40,440
Call me Jock, won't you?

746
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:42,381
All right.

747
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:47,520
Mr. Warriner.

748
01:05:56,387 --> 01:06:00,221
- Wait a minute, everybody. Queenie.
- Oh, I can't.

749
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:03,827
I want you to stand up here
where everyone can see you.

750
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:07,492
- A toast!
- A toast to Queenie!

751
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:11,260
A happy birthday to Queenie,
the queen of New York's beautiful girls.

752
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:15,236
- Many happy returns!
- Happy birthday!

753
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:22,772
I can't say anything
but thanks, everybody. A lot.

754
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:26,280
Oh, it's a lovely surprise... Jock.

755
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,817
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Will you dance now?

756
01:06:53,244 --> 01:06:56,145
That cake is just elegant...

757
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,248
...but I can't eat it all.

758
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:02,408
Well, you eat as much as you can,
and we'll save the rest.

759
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:13,357
Please, Mr. Warriner,
ask them to play something else.

760
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:17,194
- I hate sentimental music.
- All right.

761
01:07:17,968 --> 01:07:19,959
"Broadway Melody."

762
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:24,906
Don't wear a frown on old Broadway.

763
01:07:28,312 --> 01:07:29,677
Tell me...

764
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,441
...why don't you like that song?

765
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:34,777
I don't know.

766
01:07:35,653 --> 01:07:37,780
Well, what do you like?

767
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:40,521
I like cake.

768
01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:45,351
Won't you tell me that you like me a little?

769
01:07:45,863 --> 01:07:47,490
Maybe.

770
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:50,791
You mean it?

771
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:53,197
Maybe.

772
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:57,637
Will you tell me why you're so nice to me?

773
01:07:57,775 --> 01:07:59,470
Maybe.

774
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:03,271
Please, I wanna dance.

775
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,880
Oh, no, come on.
Let's sit this one out.

776
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:11,213
But look, everybody's dancing,
and the music is playing and everything.

777
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:21,726
Mr. Warriner.
You don't mean this for me?

778
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:23,697
Why, of course.

779
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:27,201
Diamonds should only
be worn by beautiful girls.

780
01:08:27,338 --> 01:08:29,533
Oh, it's just adorable.

781
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:32,608
I'd like to do a lot of things
for you, Queenie.

782
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:35,470
How would you like
an apartment all your own?

783
01:08:35,646 --> 01:08:37,705
Say, on Park Avenue.

784
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:40,408
And a car all your own.

785
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:45,181
Perhaps a Rolls-Royce.
Oh, and a lot of nice things.

786
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:49,921
Well, I'd have to think about that.

787
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:52,358
Say, where have you been?

788
01:08:52,563 --> 01:08:54,963
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

789
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:57,394
You would come in at a time like this.

790
01:08:57,568 --> 01:09:00,537
Certainly. Come on, little love boat.

791
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:03,172
Let's have this dance.

792
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,795
- Were you asleep, Hank?
- No, honey.

793
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:35,700
Well, that's swell,
because I wanna to tell you...

794
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,275
...about the grandest party
that ever happened to me.

795
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:03,731
Look at that. Look at that. Did you ever see
anything more beautiful in all your life?

796
01:10:04,268 --> 01:10:08,637
No, sirree. Because that's class, that is.

797
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:12,433
And Eddie said he wouldn't
even give me a ring.

798
01:10:14,411 --> 01:10:17,107
What would I want with his ring?

799
01:10:18,449 --> 01:10:22,112
There's more diamonds in a bracelet,
ain't they? Ain't they?

800
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:25,383
Honey, I don't know what
you're saying this for...

801
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:29,390
...but I know you don't mean it.
You can't mean it.

802
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:33,485
- It ain't in you to mean it.
- Sure I mean it.

803
01:10:34,732 --> 01:10:37,200
Why shouldn't I mean it?

804
01:10:38,469 --> 01:10:41,495
And that ain't all I'm gonna have, either.

805
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:46,608
I'm gonna have a Rolls-Royce.

806
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:51,676
And an apartment on Park Avenue.

807
01:10:53,217 --> 01:10:57,176
And everything that goes with it.
That's what I'm gonna have.

808
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:59,721
Now, honey, listen to me.

809
01:11:00,491 --> 01:11:04,325
I know we ain't had the greatest break
in the world since we hit New York.

810
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:06,725
But that's gonna change.

811
01:11:06,897 --> 01:11:08,831
That's got to.

812
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:12,632
And you're gonna meet
somebody that's right.

813
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:17,833
Somebody you can be proud of,
who'll just be crazy about you.

814
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:21,735
Somebody who's really worthy of you.

815
01:11:23,213 --> 01:11:25,340
Somebody like Eddie.

816
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:29,443
Yeah? Well, that's all right for you...

817
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,245
...but I ain't craving any hall-rooms...

818
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:35,190
...with some song-and-dance guy...

819
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,192
...who expects me to cook
his meals over a gas-jet...

820
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:43,322
...listen to a lot of smart
wisecracks and bum songs.

821
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:47,295
- No, sir.
- Oh, Queenie.

822
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:11,319
Move over.

823
01:12:23,774 --> 01:12:27,141
No more of these
kind of dumps for mine.

824
01:12:27,411 --> 01:12:31,575
I'm gonna have everything
in the world I want.

825
01:12:31,782 --> 01:12:33,875
That's me.

826
01:12:34,418 --> 01:12:38,650
And you're gonna have Eddie.

827
01:18:28,171 --> 01:18:30,605
Queenie, I don't want you
to answer me like that again.

828
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:34,437
- Then keep your nose out of my business.
- Well, your business is my business.

829
01:18:34,644 --> 01:18:36,635
That package is from Warriner, ain't it?

830
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:40,205
- What if it is?
- I won't let you keep it, that's all.

831
01:18:40,684 --> 01:18:42,618
How are you gonna stop me?

832
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:46,882
Oh, Queenie, don't you see what
I'm doing is for your own good?

833
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,750
And don't you see
what I'm doing is for your...

834
01:18:51,461 --> 01:18:54,658
Oh, what are you talking about?
Now you listen to me.

835
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:56,925
You're not gonna go out
with that guy, hear me?

836
01:18:57,234 --> 01:18:59,896
I'll stop you if I have to
tie you up to do it. You hear me?

837
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:03,229
Cut it out. Be quiet.
They can hear you out front.

838
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:05,840
Well, you hear me. I'm
going out with whoever I want...

839
01:19:06,176 --> 01:19:08,303
...and I won't hear orders
from anyone about it.

840
01:19:08,445 --> 01:19:10,936
- Now get that and get it straight.
- Queenie!

841
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:15,308
You ain't my boss. So mind your
own business and shut up.

842
01:19:15,452 --> 01:19:17,818
Oh, Queenie.

843
01:19:18,688 --> 01:19:21,122
I won't shut up.
And you're gonna listen to me.

844
01:19:21,258 --> 01:19:25,217
I won't listen to you any more than
I will to her. So you needn't get started.

845
01:19:25,362 --> 01:19:28,456
- Getting near you, Kearns.
- All right.

846
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,903
Hank, you run along. I'll talk to her.

847
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:05,830
Now, listen, Queenie. You're young yet,
and you don't know things.

848
01:20:06,136 --> 01:20:08,627
What Hank has been saying
to you is for your own good.

849
01:20:08,772 --> 01:20:12,299
Yeah, and I suppose what you're
saying is for my own good too.

850
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:14,705
As far as that goes, yes, it is.

851
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:19,611
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm saying this because I...

852
01:20:19,749 --> 01:20:23,276
- Hank finished that. Got nowhere with it.
- Well, I'm gonna get somewhere.

853
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:26,787
And whether you like me or hate me,
you're gonna pay attention to me...

854
01:20:26,923 --> 01:20:29,323
...because I'm...
Well...

855
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:32,586
Me and Hank won't let you
go out with that guy. He's no good.

856
01:20:32,762 --> 01:20:35,356
- He wants girls who...
- You never went out with girls...

857
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:39,264
...like he does.
- Plenty, but none since I met you.

858
01:20:39,769 --> 01:20:41,566
You and Hank...

859
01:20:41,771 --> 01:20:45,366
Get me right, sweetie.
I'm being on the level with you.

860
01:20:45,475 --> 01:20:47,409
Here's your pants, sir.

861
01:20:52,816 --> 01:20:55,614
- Hurry up, Kearns.
- All right.

862
01:20:55,785 --> 01:20:59,414
Oh, can't I say nothing that will
make you see what I mean?

863
01:20:59,556 --> 01:21:02,889
You're wasting time talking against
Mr. Warriner, if that's what you mean.

864
01:21:03,293 --> 01:21:05,761
Mr. Warriner. Do you know
what they say about that guy?

865
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:08,525
I don't care what they say.
They're jealous, that's all.

866
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:10,690
- You and the rest.
- Me, jealous?

867
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:13,325
What are you so interested for?

868
01:21:13,436 --> 01:21:16,371
What business is it of yours
where I go and who I go with?

869
01:21:16,506 --> 01:21:18,599
It's my business because...

870
01:21:18,808 --> 01:21:20,435
Well, because it is.

871
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,875
Oh, you ought to know
why I'm doing this.

872
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:26,171
- It's because I...
- No, no, Eddie. Don't say it.

873
01:21:26,316 --> 01:21:29,285
Oh, I gotta say it, Queenie.
I can't stop from saying it now.

874
01:21:29,419 --> 01:21:31,148
And you gotta hear it.

875
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:33,221
I love you, Queenie.

876
01:21:33,356 --> 01:21:35,449
I love you, and you know it.

877
01:21:35,592 --> 01:21:37,890
I can't help it. I tried, but I can't.

878
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:40,162
But it's easy to say now.

879
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,423
I love you, dear.

880
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:45,398
And I love you, Eddie. Never forget it.

881
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:48,469
- No matter what happens.
- Do you, Queenie?

882
01:21:48,605 --> 01:21:50,470
Yes, Eddie.

883
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:54,241
And that's why we can't...

884
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:56,811
Oh, don't you see now why...

885
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:58,671
Why what?

886
01:21:59,449 --> 01:22:02,145
- I'm going out with Jock Warriner...
- No, you're not.

887
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:05,150
Don't try to stop me, Eddie.
It's the best way.

888
01:22:05,355 --> 01:22:06,549
Here's your coat, sir.

889
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:09,649
- If you go out with that guy, I'll...
- There's a stage wait, Kearns.

890
01:22:09,859 --> 01:22:11,827
Let it wait.
Queenie, I gotta go on now.

891
01:22:11,895 --> 01:22:15,490
- Promise me you won't go out with him.
- Are you trying to ruin the show?

892
01:22:15,632 --> 01:22:18,192
- Promise me, Queenie.
- Oh, I can't promise.

893
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:20,359
- Then you won't?
- Well, then I won't.

894
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:24,303
I'll murder that guy. I'll tear him apart.
Go on out with him. Go ahead.

895
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:25,908
Get on there, Kearns.

896
01:22:26,242 --> 01:22:29,734
Queenie, you better
be here when I get off.

897
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,878
- Get up to your dressing room.
- All right.

898
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,130
Oh, Queenie. You ain't got
no idea what you're doing.

899
01:22:59,309 --> 01:23:02,642
Oh, yes, I have. Can't I have a little fun
without you trying to stop me?

900
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:05,280
Oh, I ain't trying
to stop you having fun...

901
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:07,416
...but this thing will turn out bad.

902
01:23:07,617 --> 01:23:11,644
That guy don't mean to marry you.
His kind don't never marry.

903
01:23:11,754 --> 01:23:14,484
He ain't the type to take
a girl out and buy her drinks...

904
01:23:14,624 --> 01:23:19,721
...and let it go at that. You know that.
And you know what the finish will be.

905
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:23,194
Now listen to me, Hank.
Get this straight, once and for all.

906
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:25,561
I'm old enough to know
what I'm gonna do.

907
01:23:25,735 --> 01:23:29,535
And I don't want no more cracks from you
and Mr. Wise-Guy Kearns about it either.

908
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,606
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.

909
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:33,606
What I'm saying's for your own good.

910
01:23:33,776 --> 01:23:37,837
- Tell it to somebody you don't know.
- I ain't gonna let you get away with it.

911
01:23:38,148 --> 01:23:40,241
- Give me that. That's mine.
- It's not yours...

912
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:43,614
- Well, it is mine, and you will give it...
- No, I won't.

913
01:23:43,887 --> 01:23:46,481
You will give it to me.

914
01:23:47,924 --> 01:23:49,687
Queenie.

915
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:53,260
Queenie, you mustn't go.
Queenie, you can't go.

916
01:23:53,396 --> 01:23:55,227
Eddie, stop her.
Do something, will you?

917
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:59,425
- Queenie, just a moment, Queenie.
- Get your hands off me.

918
01:23:59,936 --> 01:24:02,200
You're not gonna leave
except with me and Hank.

919
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:04,738
- You get out of my way.
- You heard what I said.

920
01:24:04,908 --> 01:24:08,344
You can't get away with it.
I'll kill that guy just as sure as anything.

921
01:24:08,478 --> 01:24:10,742
I'll make him suffer the way
he's making me suffer.

922
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,438
Shut up!

923
01:24:12,916 --> 01:24:14,884
- I'm going.
- You can't go, Queenie.

924
01:24:15,185 --> 01:24:16,777
Gonna stay right here. No.

925
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,115
Let go of me.

926
01:24:19,289 --> 01:24:22,452
I've heard all I'm gonna hear from
either of you. You've said enough.

927
01:24:22,692 --> 01:24:24,683
- I'd like to see you kill anybody.
- Queenie.

928
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:26,820
You dirty, cheap little songwriter, you.

929
01:24:27,197 --> 01:24:29,597
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!

930
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:32,497
Queenie, Queenie!

931
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:39,893
- Say, what kind of a sap are you, anyway?
- What do you mean?

932
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:44,639
You gonna let a john like that steal her from
you because he's got a little more jack?

933
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:49,206
Well, if you do, all I can say
is you're a rotten quitter.

934
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,909
You love her, don't you?

935
01:25:52,448 --> 01:25:54,609
Oh, don't lie to me. I know you do.

936
01:25:54,784 --> 01:25:56,911
Say, if I loved a girl
like you do Queenie...

937
01:25:57,287 --> 01:26:00,518
...l'd fight for her. What's the
matter with you? Where's your nerve?

938
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:03,889
- But, Hank, you don't...
- Oh, don't pass the buck to me.

939
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:14,336
What do you think I've been meaning all
along? I was on the level with this thing?

940
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:17,803
That I was in love with you?
That's a hot one.

941
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:21,205
I just been playing you for all
I could get out of you for the act.

942
01:26:21,344 --> 01:26:24,745
- You been kidding me all the time?
- Sure, I been kidding you.

943
01:26:24,881 --> 01:26:28,408
Say, I wouldn't marry you
if you was the last man on earth.

944
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:31,746
And at that, I ain't so sure
you're the right guy for her.

945
01:26:31,888 --> 01:26:33,822
You're a coward.

946
01:26:34,157 --> 01:26:37,320
You're afraid of Jock Warriner,
or you'd go out and fight for her.

947
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,553
- But you're just yellow.
- You think I'm yellow?

948
01:26:39,829 --> 01:26:42,627
- Sure, you're yellow.
- I'll show you how much I'm yellow.

949
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:44,667
You're yellow. You hear me?
You're yellow.

950
01:26:44,834 --> 01:26:47,234
- I'm yellow?
- Yes, you are. You're yellow!

951
01:26:47,337 --> 01:26:49,669
You're yellow. Do you hear me?

952
01:26:55,878 --> 01:27:00,144
Oh, Eddie, you're not yellow.

953
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:02,448
You're white.

954
01:28:17,627 --> 01:28:21,688
Murray Hill-8400. Yes, please.

955
01:28:28,604 --> 01:28:29,798
Hello.

956
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:34,137
Hello, Uncle Jed?

957
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:35,937
It's Hank.

958
01:28:36,312 --> 01:28:39,748
Say, I've decided
to take those 30 weeks.

959
01:28:39,916 --> 01:28:42,885
You can team me up with that blond.

960
01:29:15,685 --> 01:29:18,313
I'm breathless.

961
01:29:18,488 --> 01:29:21,889
Oh, I don't know what to say.
It's wonderful.

962
01:29:22,191 --> 01:29:24,182
Oh, I can't thank you enough.

963
01:29:24,327 --> 01:29:26,386
It's not half good enough for you.

964
01:29:26,562 --> 01:29:29,395
I want you to have
everything in the world.

965
01:29:29,565 --> 01:29:31,294
Thank you.

966
01:30:02,498 --> 01:30:04,227
- Hello, Eddie.
- Where's Queenie?

967
01:30:04,367 --> 01:30:07,165
I want you to meet my girlfriend.

968
01:30:10,206 --> 01:30:14,768
- Come on, let's go back to the party.
- Oh, Queenie, not yet.

969
01:30:15,144 --> 01:30:18,636
Why, I haven't had you
to myself for a moment tonight.

970
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:21,710
Oh, but I'd rather go back, please.

971
01:30:21,817 --> 01:30:23,682
Wait, Queenie.

972
01:30:24,887 --> 01:30:28,846
I have so many things
I want to tell you alone.

973
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:32,819
Oh, well, you can tell me out there.

974
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:36,589
Wait a minute, Queenie.

975
01:30:36,699 --> 01:30:40,226
I've done all these things for you.
Aren't you going to be nice to me?

976
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:42,837
- Oh, Jock, let me go.
- Why should I let you go?

977
01:30:43,139 --> 01:30:45,607
- Please let me go, please.
- No, I won't let you go.

978
01:30:45,775 --> 01:30:47,743
You're going to stay right here with me.

979
01:30:47,877 --> 01:30:50,402
- No, I'm not gonna stay here with you.
- Yes, you are.

980
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:52,445
- No, I'm not.
- I will keep you here.

981
01:30:52,582 --> 01:30:55,278
You won't keep me here,
do you hear me? You won't.

982
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:57,316
- Let me go.
- I won't let you go.

983
01:30:57,553 --> 01:30:59,418
I won't stay with you another minute.

984
01:30:59,555 --> 01:31:01,921
- Let me go.
- I told you not to come here.

985
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:04,182
- Why did you come?
- Oh, Eddie, take me away.

986
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,260
What do you mean
coming in here? Get out.

987
01:31:06,395 --> 01:31:09,558
- I won't before I'm finished with you.
- Oh, Eddie, let's go.

988
01:31:09,732 --> 01:31:12,428
- I've been looking for you.
- Now that you've found me...

989
01:31:12,568 --> 01:31:15,662
...what do you want?
- I'll show you what I want.

990
01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:20,164
Oh, Eddie.

991
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:21,901
What's the matter?

992
01:31:22,211 --> 01:31:24,145
Oh, darling, let me see you.

993
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,181
Oh, Eddie. Have they
hurt you, sweetheart?

994
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:28,806
Have they?

995
01:31:29,585 --> 01:31:32,782
You just hit him again if you dare.
Just try it, that's all.

996
01:31:32,822 --> 01:31:36,883
- Eddie, let me see you.
- Queenie, Queenie.

997
01:31:37,693 --> 01:31:39,558
You don't realize what you're doing.

998
01:31:39,729 --> 01:31:43,221
You let me go. And you can take
your jewelry and your presents...

999
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:46,334
...and everything. I don't want
anything to do with you.

1000
01:31:46,469 --> 01:31:47,902
Let me get a sock at that guy.

1001
01:31:48,237 --> 01:31:51,206
- No, Eddie don't...
- Let me get at him, just let me get at him.

1002
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,638
- I wanna get at that guy.
- Throw him out.

1003
01:31:53,809 --> 01:31:56,243
- Out he goes.
- No, don't.

1004
01:31:57,446 --> 01:31:59,539
Don't let them. They're going to kill him.

1005
01:31:59,682 --> 01:32:01,912
Oh, Eddie. Don't you do that to him.

1006
01:32:03,152 --> 01:32:04,881
And stay out.

1007
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:06,677
What do you know about that guy?

1008
01:32:06,856 --> 01:32:08,551
Got rid of that guy anyhow.

1009
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:11,159
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, dear.

1010
01:32:11,293 --> 01:32:13,193
You dirty bums, you.

1011
01:32:13,329 --> 01:32:15,923
- Oh, Eddie, have they hurt you?
- What do you think?

1012
01:32:16,232 --> 01:32:18,700
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll bet you are.

1013
01:32:18,868 --> 01:32:20,358
I am.

1014
01:32:20,503 --> 01:32:23,233
I don't know why you feel
sorry for anybody like me.

1015
01:32:23,406 --> 01:32:24,896
I'm no good.

1016
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:26,868
I can't even scrap a little.

1017
01:32:27,176 --> 01:32:31,135
I let a heel like that take a sock
at me and get away with it.

1018
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,475
Well, Eddie, he's bigger than you are.

1019
01:32:33,649 --> 01:32:37,244
- Yeah, a little bigger.
- And he's awfully strong.

1020
01:32:37,386 --> 01:32:39,752
I suppose you found
that out from his hugs.

1021
01:32:39,889 --> 01:32:42,517
Well, if you couldn't stop
them from throwing you out...

1022
01:32:42,692 --> 01:32:45,160
...how could I stop him from hugging me?

1023
01:32:45,294 --> 01:32:48,422
Well, there's something in that.
I guess you'd better go home.

1024
01:32:48,664 --> 01:32:51,258
Oh, Eddie, aren't you
gonna take me home?

1025
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:54,792
- I'll take you home.
- Don't you like me anymore?

1026
01:32:54,937 --> 01:32:58,737
Like you? Why, Queenie, I...

1027
01:32:58,874 --> 01:33:01,342
Oh, what is it? They've
hurt you, I know they have.

1028
01:33:01,477 --> 01:33:03,672
Oh, I'm all right, Queenie.
Come on, let's go.

1029
01:33:03,813 --> 01:33:06,611
Now understand, it took
six of them to throw me out.

1030
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:08,750
Yes, Eddie.

1031
01:33:09,485 --> 01:33:11,214
Oh, what is it?

1032
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,487
Oh, they'll be here any minute.

1033
01:33:20,696 --> 01:33:24,257
What does it...? What does it...?
Read it.

1034
01:33:24,366 --> 01:33:27,392
"Arriving 2:30, wonderful honeymoon.
See you the minute we get in.

1035
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:32,598
Love to our Hank, Queenie and Eddie."
Oh, I'm so excited. What time is it?

1036
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,635
- 12:00 last night.
- It's what?

1037
01:33:36,812 --> 01:33:38,780
Well, what's the matter with this thing?

1038
01:33:39,215 --> 01:33:40,375
See who that is.

1039
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:45,446
- Hello, Jed.
- Hank!

1040
01:33:51,227 --> 01:33:53,320
Oh, gee.

1041
01:33:55,731 --> 01:33:58,598
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Hank.

1042
01:33:58,734 --> 01:34:00,929
Oh, come here.

1043
01:34:01,237 --> 01:34:04,604
Well, well, Queenie. Congratu...

1044
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:07,538
- How are you?
- Oh, fine, Uncle Jed. How are you?

1045
01:34:07,743 --> 01:34:11,474
Oh, I'm great. What's it going to be
in the electric lights this time?

1046
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:14,105
Queenie Kearns and Company?

1047
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,842
No, sirree.

1048
01:34:16,152 --> 01:34:20,350
I'm only gonna be connected
with the stage by marriage.

1049
01:34:20,523 --> 01:34:24,186
Oh, Hank, we found the cutest
little home down on Long Island.

1050
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,191
- Yeah?
- Where Eddie can work.

1051
01:34:26,362 --> 01:34:30,298
And say, when you're finished with
this tour, you're coming to live with us.

1052
01:34:30,432 --> 01:34:34,528
Oh, nothing doing. Hotels for mine,
where I can get service.

1053
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:38,297
- I'd be all out of step in a real home.
- What do you mean?

1054
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:42,800
- You're coming to live with us, all right.
- I should say she is.

1055
01:34:44,446 --> 01:34:48,712
Just like a trouper.
Troupers are all tramps.

1056
01:34:48,851 --> 01:34:51,718
Here today and gone tomorrow.

1057
01:34:51,854 --> 01:34:55,153
No home, no nothing.

1058
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:59,691
Hank, you're just a born trouper.

1059
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:14,173
Doggone this weather. It certainly
is tough on colds, isn't it?

1060
01:35:16,512 --> 01:35:19,913
Well, say, I want Queenie
and Eddie to see the act.

1061
01:35:20,316 --> 01:35:22,216
Say, where is that blond, anyway?

1062
01:35:22,318 --> 01:35:24,809
I don't know. She's always late.

1063
01:35:28,324 --> 01:35:30,451
Hank, you're a sight for sore eyes.

1064
01:35:30,559 --> 01:35:33,119
- Hello, Uncle Jed.
- Oh, hello, Flo.

1065
01:35:33,329 --> 01:35:36,492
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Hello, darling.

1066
01:35:36,565 --> 01:35:39,329
- Oh, Eddie.
- Hello, Flo.

1067
01:35:39,468 --> 01:35:43,700
Oh, Eddie, tell me, did you have
a good time on your honeymoon?

1068
01:35:46,342 --> 01:35:48,401
Yeah, great.

1069
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:52,274
Oh, Eddie, when you
open your new show...

1070
01:35:52,448 --> 01:35:55,474
...gonna give me a job, aren't you?
- Why, certainly.

1071
01:35:55,651 --> 01:35:57,551
Oh, you're grand.

1072
01:35:57,686 --> 01:36:00,416
Say, come on, stupid.
Let's run through the act for them.

1073
01:36:00,556 --> 01:36:02,456
Okay.

1074
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:05,725
But, say, you know something?
She's a born trouper.

1075
01:36:05,861 --> 01:36:08,557
We're gonna break in the act
and bring it to New York.

1076
01:36:08,664 --> 01:36:10,564
- That's great.
- Say, step on it, will you?

1077
01:36:10,733 --> 01:36:12,428
- I've got a matinee.
- Sure.

1078
01:36:12,568 --> 01:36:13,557
I want two choruses...

1079
01:36:13,736 --> 01:36:16,170
...and you follow us, not us you.
- Come on, Flo.

1080
01:36:16,405 --> 01:36:20,432
Say, listen. There's gonna be no part
in your show for that dame, get me?

1081
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:23,339
Of course not, honey.

1082
01:37:01,884 --> 01:37:05,820
It's kind of rough yet, but don't
you say it's pretty good for an opening?

1083
01:37:07,323 --> 01:37:10,190
You know, if you don't hurry,
you're gonna miss that train.

1084
01:37:10,326 --> 01:37:12,726
- Oh, the train.
- Sure, the train.

1085
01:37:12,861 --> 01:37:15,295
Oh, Hank. Hank, can I help you?

1086
01:37:15,431 --> 01:37:19,765
Yes, you could hold my coat for me.
I forgot all about the thing.

1087
01:37:22,604 --> 01:37:24,629
Oh, Hank.

1088
01:37:31,447 --> 01:37:33,506
That's all right, Queenie.

1089
01:37:37,653 --> 01:37:41,680
- Goodbye, Eddie.
- Goodbye, Hank.

1090
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:53,198
Oh, you'll write to me soon, won't you?

1091
01:37:53,335 --> 01:37:57,704
Yeah, I'll write you from Peoria.
Now, where's my hat? Where's my hat?

1092
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,274
- Oh, where's my hat!
- Here's your hat.

1093
01:38:03,312 --> 01:38:06,110
Here. Here. Here's your valise.

1094
01:38:06,248 --> 01:38:09,308
- All right. Bring it, Uncle Jed. Come on.
- It's pretty heavy.

1095
01:38:09,485 --> 01:38:11,510
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.

1096
01:38:11,653 --> 01:38:15,919
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Don't forget to write. Goodbye.

1097
01:38:26,235 --> 01:38:29,329
Oh, don't cry, dear.
Hank won't be gone long.

1098
01:38:29,471 --> 01:38:33,567
The season will be over before you
know it, and she'll be back here with us.

1099
01:38:33,742 --> 01:38:35,403
It ain't that, honey.

1100
01:38:35,544 --> 01:38:40,379
But it seems like Hank
ain't never had a real break.

1101
01:38:40,516 --> 01:38:44,748
And I guess I haven't done much
to make her any happier.

1102
01:38:44,887 --> 01:38:47,447
I wouldn't feel that way about it, dear.

1103
01:38:47,689 --> 01:38:51,216
Hank'll be much happier back on the road.
Why, she couldn't give it up.

1104
01:38:51,326 --> 01:38:55,126
It's her life.
She couldn't live without it.

1105
01:38:56,732 --> 01:39:00,190
And now that she knows
you're taken care of...

1106
01:39:01,603 --> 01:39:03,935
Don't cry, honey.

1107
01:39:04,373 --> 01:39:07,308
People can't help falling in love.

1108
01:39:07,709 --> 01:39:10,735
It comes to you no matter what you do.

1109
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:13,571
And I love you, dear.

1110
01:39:13,749 --> 01:39:16,115
Oh, and I love you, Eddie.

1111
01:39:16,285 --> 01:39:19,379
You were just meant for me.

1112
01:39:25,227 --> 01:39:27,320
Opening in Peoria.

1113
01:39:27,563 --> 01:39:30,293
Four shows a day.

1114
01:39:30,365 --> 01:39:33,198
Zanny said he'd make me
a star in six months.

1115
01:39:33,569 --> 01:39:37,528
Say, listen, it's better to star in...

1116
01:39:39,575 --> 01:39:43,602
In Oshkosh than to starve on Broadway.

1117
01:39:43,779 --> 01:39:45,474
That's a bunk.

1118
01:39:45,614 --> 01:39:49,573
Say, now you listen to me,
stupid. I'll handle things.

1119
01:39:49,751 --> 01:39:54,347
Yes, and I'll have you back on Broadway
and in the Palace in less than six months.

1120
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:57,718
- No fooling?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.

1121
01:39:57,793 --> 01:40:00,591
Sure, it's...

1122
01:40:01,697 --> 01:40:04,791
It's... It's in the can.

1123
01:40:16,145 --> 01:40:18,113
