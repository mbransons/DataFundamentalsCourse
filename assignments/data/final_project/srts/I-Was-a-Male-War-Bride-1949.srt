2
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:45,278
Sergeant.

3
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,740
Which is the quickest way
to Heidelberg?

4
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:53,703
Down here four blocks, turn right and
straight on until the autobahn.

5
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:55,455
There are signs,
you can't miss it.

6
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:57,081
Thank you, sergeant.

7
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:02,003
What have you decided?

8
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:04,214
We don't know.

9
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:06,466
I know. Drive.

10
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:34,981
If you want,
I can take you to the town hall.

11
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:36,149
Wait here.

12
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:39,277
I know the mayor...

13
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,486
Wait here.

14
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:43,614
I can help you...

15
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,658
Wait here!

16
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,935
Capt. Rochard, French Economic Mission.
Joe, you'll need to interpret.

17
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:00,770
Never mind,
we'll get along all right.

18
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,522
Sorry, sir.
Who did you wish to see?

19
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:07,444
The O.I.C.A.M.G.W.A.C.

20
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:10,030
First floor, turn to your right.

21
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:11,406
Thank you.

22
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:27,228
"War Administration

I beg your pardon, I'm looking for
Lieutenant Gates' office.

27
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,019
This isn't it.

28
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,187
Isn't it?

29
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:57,939
Right over there, Captain.

30
00:04:58,147 --> 00:04:59,357
Thank you.

31
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:05,071
Yes.

32
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,533
Yes, Colonel.
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:10,743
Yes, sir, yes, sir...

34
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:13,760
Oh, it's you.
What do you want?

35
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:18,557
One nightshirt.
What do you call this thing? Gown.

36
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:23,687
One pair of bloomers, two pairs
of stockings...

37
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:26,356
Just a moment.
One slip.

38
00:05:26,565 --> 00:05:30,819
Sorry I couldn't get them to you
sooner. Goodbye Lieutenant Gates.

39
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:40,051
What a stinker you are.

40
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,385
Did I forget something?

41
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:44,180
Dirty stinker, get right back
in there and explain to them

42
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:47,433
how you got my laundry by mistake
and forgot to give it back to me.

43
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,977
It's such a dull story.
Who would care?

44
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:51,395
You know what they think.

45
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:53,356
I don't understand...

46
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:56,651
Oh, no...
You mean you and me?

47
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:59,278
I'll explain that the idea
is revolting.

48
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:01,697
Oh, no you don't.
Never mind.

49
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:05,298
I'd be delighted to explain
that I think you're repulsive.

50
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:09,052
Never mind. Forget it.
You've had your joke, now beat it.

51
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,304
I'm here on official business.

52
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:13,098
Don't tell me.
Another mission?

53
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,517
Don't get your hopes up.
You're not coming with me.

54
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:17,644
Thank heavens.
Who is your victim?

55
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:21,606
My interpreter and aide
is Lieutenant Eloise Billings,

56
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:25,819
who I'm reliably informed
is intelligent, pretty

57
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:28,168
and, as you Americans say,
stacked.

58
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:30,087
That she is.
You haven't met her?

59
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:34,967
No, that will occur in Major
Prendergast's office in 30 seconds.

60
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,303
Goodbye again, lieutenant Gates.

61
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:41,432
- Where are you going?
- Major Prendergast's office.

62
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,851
There's nothing for you to do
there. Wait...

63
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,394
I'm in a hurry.

64
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,271
- Hello, Eloise.
- Hi, honey.

65
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,025
Capt. Rochard, Lieutenant Billings.
You'll work together.

66
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,234
Enchanted.

67
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:53,499
How do you do...

68
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,044
We have a mutual friend,
Alex Brissac.

69
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:58,421
Sure, I remember him.

70
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,258
As I was on previous missions
with Capt. Rochard,

71
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:05,303
he just returned some of my things.
Perhaps I can help.

72
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:09,390
I can explain. Don't you
have somewhere to go?

73
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,850
No, I'm free until 2.30.

74
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:12,143
About this mission...

75
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:16,731
It's simple. We have to go to
Bad Nauheim, a pleasant village...

76
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,914
Till you get there.

77
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:22,250
I can explain better
when we're alone.

78
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,337
Better wear side arms.
He uses maps instead of etchings.

79
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,882
I've so looked forward
to going to Bad Nauheim.

80
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:32,970
The French army shoe
is slightly different.

81
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:34,972
Hold the foot, junior.

82
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,598
Yes, yes.

83
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,559
As shown by the captain's foot
and my thigh.

84
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:40,769
For goodness sake!

85
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,742
That was purely accidental.

86
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:45,663
The mark on my chin...
May I have my foot?

87
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:49,750
Thank you. The mark under my chin
was an accident.

88
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,503
My fault entirely.
I tripped while he was chasing me.

89
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:54,505
Will you shut up?

90
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:58,384
See? Something I'd never have
mentioned, his temperament.

91
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:01,929
But he's not to blame,
more like a form of epilepsy.

92
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,056
- Will you shut up?
- I tell you...

93
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,766
Will you sh...?

94
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:07,907
Henri, I'm talking.

95
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,201
Yes, you are.

96
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,705
I tell you because we're members
of the same army and the same sex.

97
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:17,459
It's only fair to warn you that
Jack the Ripper is up that alley.

98
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,462
In case anything happens, would you
give me your mother's address?

99
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,674
I've been trying to tell you,
I'm not going on this mission.

100
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:27,510
I'm going to Frankfurt
with Colonel Bliven.

101
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:28,928
But who?

102
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:30,347
You're going with him.

103
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,349
Who is Jack the...?

104
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:36,825
Honey, maybe you better leave me
your mother's address.

105
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,167
Hello, Captain Rochard. I was going
to send for you, Gates. Come in.

106
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:46,919
You too, Captain.

107
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:51,882
This shouldn't take long.

108
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:56,261
Gates, Billings is needed elsewhere.
You'll go with Captain Rochard.

109
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,262
Thank you, no.

110
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:00,697
If I may suggest, Lieutenant Perry
has almost finished her assignment...

111
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,741
No experience. The captain
wants our best, don't you?

112
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,328
Well, Major, this is not
an important mission.

113
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:10,623
My government request for an officer
is only a technicality...

114
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:14,419
Your orders call for our full
co-operation, I'll see you get it.

115
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:18,631
Here's your identity card,
security pass and ration card.

116
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,093
Gates, Captain Rochard
will brief you on the mission.

117
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:23,275
Yes, Major.

118
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:27,279
Major, this Lieutenant Perry,
she ought to do.

119
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:30,741
You're very kind, but we're used
to being short-handed.

120
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:32,826
Besides, if I remember,

121
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:38,165
you've had assignments with Gates
before, and very successfully.

122
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:43,795
"Recovered art treasures stolen
by the Nazis from the Lille Museum".

123
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:48,022
"Located hidden documents
relating to rocket research.

124
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:50,441
Received Legion of Merit..."

125
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,151
She's your man.

126
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,944
- Wish she were.
- Pardon?

127
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:55,363
Nothing.

128
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:56,739
Is there anything else?

129
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:59,658
No, thank you.
You've done more than you realise.

130
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,077
Good luck then.

131
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,621
Goodbye, Major.

132
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,543
Jack the Ripper
was a famous...

133
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:10,961
Thank you.

134
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,063
Thank you, Captain.

135
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,443
I wonder what the army would do
if I deserted?

136
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:23,363
They'd shoot you. The thought
makes my mouth water.

137
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:25,156
I'd almost prefer it myself.

138
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:26,950
Which way do we go?

139
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:33,373
Well, let's get the briefing over.
What's the job?

140
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:34,916
You don't need to know.

141
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,633
Come on, what's the job?

142
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:41,061
To keep your mouth shut
and do as I tell you.

143
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:46,775
I need to know what equipment
to draw from the quartermaster.

144
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:48,694
See if they have a spare head.

145
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:53,615
I warn you, bubble mouth, I'll carry
a revolver and a trench knife.

146
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:58,704
If you touch me, you'll go back
minus a lot of parts you value.

147
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:02,291
There you go again, you idiot.
I didn't touch you.

148
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:07,560
I'm sorry, but we're stuck together.
Why not make the best of it?

149
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:08,728
There is no best.

150
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:10,897
I'll go crazy if you...

151
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:15,860
We turn here. I'll go crazy if you
keep losing your maniac temper.

152
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,530
Let's grow up.
I'm sorry about the wine cellar.

153
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:23,326
I have no temper.
No one ever accused me of that!

154
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:24,786
They didn't?

155
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,670
Do you remember the last time
I saw you?

156
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:30,555
You were chasing me around
Düsseldorf

157
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,891
swearing you'd tear my head off
and make me eat it.

158
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,062
And what colour was I?
I was a lovely robin's egg blue.

159
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,146
You looked so funny.

160
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:40,857
On account of being pushed
into a vat of dye by you!

161
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,193
I didn't know,
I thought it was water.

162
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:46,113
Water...
Blue, all over, blue.

163
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:52,624
It's your own fault. Drinking free
wine and turning into an octopus...

164
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,262
You misunderstood.
I was trying to be friendly.

165
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,764
I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

166
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:02,101
Let's forget it,
the dye has come off.

167
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:03,310
No, it hasn't.

168
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,354
- It hasn't?
- No.

169
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:07,022
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:10,109
That's all right, there's
an advantage in being an oddity.

171
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:11,694
In here, Henri.

172
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:18,131
Hello, Jack.

173
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:20,300
Hello. What's so funny?

174
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:25,221
It's difficult to describe.
Captain Rumsey, Captain Rochard

175
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,223
of the French Economic Mission.

176
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:30,852
Je suis enchanté de faire
votre connaissance.

177
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:32,479
Hiya.

178
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:34,272
Have you some orders for me?

179
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:38,902
All ready, Burns... Cathy, this means
no dance for me Saturday night.

180
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,570
Don't be silly, take Kitty.

181
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:44,671
I'd rather sit in my room and think
of you. Wouldn't you, Captain?

182
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,590
Alone, in my room.

183
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,966
Take good care of her.

184
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:50,511
- I'll watch her every moment.
- That's fine.

185
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,971
We better be going.
Bye, Jack.

186
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,348
How about dinner the night
you get back?

187
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:55,933
It's a deal.

188
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,519
Alors, mon capitaine...

189
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:01,772
Avez...
Avez de bonne chance.

190
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,273
See you in church.

191
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,775
Sure. So long.

192
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:05,984
So long.

193
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:14,173
That linguist is stuck on you.
What's the matter with him?

194
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:16,843
It's only natural that you
wouldn't understand.

195
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:18,010
It certainly is.

196
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:22,682
You chase after anything in skirts.
They're all the same to you.

197
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,601
But lots of men can tell them apart.

198
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:30,148
Sometimes they find one they like more
than the others. That's called love.

199
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:33,540
You probably haven't experienced it,
but you must've read about it.

200
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:35,208
Where are we going?

201
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,377
I go that way,
I have to get my stuff.

202
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:39,713
Where do I go?
I have to pay off my cab.

203
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,507
I'll meet you at the motor pool
in twenty minutes.

204
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:46,970
Before you go. Why did you say
I run after everything in skirts?

205
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:49,764
I didn't.
I said anything.

206
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:51,600
That's different, then.

207
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:55,562
American women...

208
00:13:56,605 --> 00:14:00,539
For weeks, you've been talking about
the man as if he had jaundice.

209
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,582
He did.

210
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:05,336
Now you're over the moon because
you'll be alone with him three days.

211
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,837
You can do a lot in three days.

212
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,424
If you work at it.
What about the dye? Is he still blue?

213
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:14,428
He's still mad, but he's fun
to fight with. Bring that, will you?

214
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:15,846
Sure.

215
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,579
Are you ready, Captain?

216
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:29,082
Quite ready, Lieutenant.

217
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:40,134
Morning, Sergeant. We need
transportation to Bad Nauheim.

218
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:43,179
Sorry, you're all out of luck.

219
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:44,430
We'll settle for a jeep.

220
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,016
All we've got are motorcycles
and side cars.

221
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,699
Come on, sergeant.

222
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:50,659
Did you look at your orders?

223
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,452
What about those cars?

224
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:54,746
You've got priority 4.
That's bottom.

225
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:57,374
Well, Captain, what do we do?

226
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,001
We'll have to take a motorcycle.

227
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:01,795
- Are you checked out on motorcycles?
- I can drive one.

228
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:04,464
If you ain't checked out, you can't.

229
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,425
I have a motorcycle licence.

230
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:08,760
Well, I guess that fixes you up.

231
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:10,888
We'll wait for a car.

232
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:12,347
I can drive one.

233
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:13,654
I'm sure.

234
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:17,575
I'm good on a motorcycle. My brother
had one, we went hill climbing.

235
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:20,703
- I can even ride standing up.
- What for?

236
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:24,790
I can still ride a motorcycle.
Or are you afraid?

237
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,628
We'll take it, Sergeant.
And I am afraid.

238
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:31,881
- Any one of these?
- Sure, take your pick.

239
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,134
Remember, she has to drive.
That's regulations.

240
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,677
Thank you.

241
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:43,031
Sergeant, can we have
a helmet and goggles?

242
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,450
In the toolbox, lieutenant.

243
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,202
Yes. Thanks.

244
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:51,414
What are you laughing at?

245
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:54,960
Begging your pardon, how do you
intend to ride? Side saddle?

246
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:57,837
No. Begging your pardon,
astride.

247
00:15:58,046 --> 00:16:00,298
- It's a shame.
- Excuse me.

248
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,241
How far is it to Bad Nauheim?

249
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,410
About 120 kilometres.

250
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:16,662
Do you know the way?

251
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,163
I've got a map.

252
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:19,498
Of Germany?

253
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:21,959
Yes, Captain, of Germany.

254
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:32,900
You'll be all right.

255
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,281
Lieutenant!
You forgot something!

256
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:42,035
Never mind,
let her go.

257
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,751
Sorry, I took it off for oiling
and forgot to hook it up.

258
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:53,060
Take this one,
it's all in one piece.

259
00:16:53,268 --> 00:16:55,604
It would be better,
don't you agree?

260
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:57,689
- I don't know.
- You don't?

261
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,775
Yes, I don't know.

262
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:04,613
You know how silly you look
sitting there?

263
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,498
Is it still so funny?

264
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:17,209
No, I was just thinking

265
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:21,686
how nice it'd be if this one
came off while we were driving.

266
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:34,801
Oh, I dropped my lipstick.

267
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,177
It rolled over there.

268
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:37,762
Get it, will you?

269
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:41,849
It's a pleasure to get out
of this portable bathtub.

270
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:46,979
I can't reach it.
It's over there.

271
00:18:47,188 --> 00:18:48,856
Climb over the top.

272
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,106
Let me down! Let me down!

273
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,942
Henri, what are you doing
up there?

274
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,866
- What's the deal?
- The area's sealed off from here to Battenberg.

275
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:49,244
- What for?
- Rounding up a gang of black market dealers.

276
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:51,538
- I have a pass.
- Sorry, it's no good.

277
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:52,831
I've got a general pass.

278
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:55,000
Keep it.
All passes are suspended.

279
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:59,963
- For how long?
- 8 to 12 hours, maybe 24. I'm sorry.

280
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:03,592
- Well?
- I might've known.

281
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:06,637
Don't blame me. It's not my fault.
What'll we do?

282
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:11,614
I can't wait here. I've got to be
in Bad Nauheim at 3 pm tomorrow.

283
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:13,825
If this thing had wings,
we could...

284
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:15,993
What's wrong with that?

285
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:18,371
- What?
- That boat.

286
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:21,457
It should say U.S. Navy on it.

287
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,461
Why not put the motorcycle on it
and row down past Battenberg?

288
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,797
It's not far.
We can pick up the road there.

289
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:29,048
Do you think they'll let us?

290
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:34,303
We can try. Lieutenant, can we take
that boat and row past Battenberg?

291
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,154
So long as you don't row on the road,
it's none of my business.

292
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,864
Can we have some help?
Thanks.

293
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,949
- Sergeant Christian!
- Yes?

294
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,909
Bring some men over here.

295
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,120
Watch your feet.
Put it in gear.

296
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,206
Thanks. Lieutenant,
tell the O.I. C

297
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,501
we'll return the boat or
telegraph him where to pick it up.

298
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,796
Will you help us to shove off?
Thanks.

299
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:55,964
Have a nice trip.

300
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,174
Thanks.

301
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,815
- Grab an oar.
- Me?

302
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:03,194
Yes, you. An oar.

303
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:08,115
Pull, pull.

304
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:11,118
Pull.

305
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:23,881
What's that ahead?

306
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,301
A bridge.

307
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:28,316
It's not on the map, though.

308
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:29,526
Where are we?

309
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:31,569
A couple of miles should do it.

310
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:34,572
What's that noise?

311
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:38,159
Sounds like a C-47.

312
00:21:38,368 --> 00:21:41,121
It's bigger than that,
must be a C-54.

313
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,915
Must be a lot of C-47s.

314
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:45,625
C-54s!

315
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,690
Whatever kind of planes the are,
they make a lot of noise.

316
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:57,442
It doesn't...
Henri, row for shore, quick!

317
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,611
- Why?
- Don't argue, row!

318
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,158
Let me tell you something.
I'm going straight down this river.

319
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,743
You sure are, but you're going
over a waterfall first.

320
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,745
That's different...

321
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:27,695
Henri, stop playing ostrich!
Hold this!

322
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,116
Let's try to pull ourselves free!

323
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:33,618
All right.

324
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:35,912
Come on, pull, pull hard!

325
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,371
I'm pulling!

326
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,166
Now we're getting it!
Danke!

327
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:44,226
Now row.

328
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:45,644
I'm rowing.

329
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:48,438
Come on, Henri, pull.

330
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:52,734
- Row hard.
- I am!

331
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,363
Now, turn it around.

332
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:58,073
I'll turn it.

333
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:03,537
You're so clumsy!

334
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,348
Have you got it?

335
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,814
A bit more.

336
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,741
That's awfully wet ground
you're sitting on.

337
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:30,754
At the moment,
I can't feel anything,

338
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:33,887
but, when I do, I'm going to
kick you bowlegged.

339
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:35,597
For what?
For saving your life?

340
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:38,016
Oh, yes.
You did catch that rope.

341
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,893
I did.

342
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:41,102
Convenient, wasn't it?

343
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,229
They always are.

344
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,607
I suppose I owe you something.

345
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:50,653
I'll call it square if you explain
the mission. Come on, Henri.

346
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,625
There's a man there who grinds
lenses. His name is...

347
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:58,634
- What's the matter?
- Charley horse.

348
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:00,677
Roll over,
I can fix that.

349
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:02,971
Never mind.
Go ahead with the story.

350
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,682
- His name's Schindler.
- A lens grinder.

351
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:11,021
I have to persuade him that we'll pay
more than the black market.

352
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:12,272
That's sore.

353
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:14,399
Roll over, I'm good at that.

354
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,443
All right.

355
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:19,988
What's our problem?

356
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:25,174
No problem. A few well-chosen words,
a contract, a passport and then home.

357
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,093
That's the whole plot.
Simple, isn't it?

358
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,470
I don't see why they assigned me
to this mission.

359
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,806
They didn't want to make it
too easy.

360
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,393
How is my leg?

361
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,312
Not bad,
better than I remembered.

362
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,231
Perhaps the other...

363
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,067
No, never mind. That'll do.
Help me up.

364
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,711
I was just being friendly.

365
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,547
But you're never friendly
from a distance.

366
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:55,093
Henri, one move, and it won't be
a vat of dye, it'll be the river.

367
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:57,512
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

368
00:24:58,471 --> 00:24:59,764
I think you would.

369
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,105
Catherine, your lack of co-operation
is amazing!

370
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:11,040
I'll co-operate by
finding out where we are.

371
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,000
Who put us on the river?

372
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,003
I knew you'd say that.
You're tiresome.

373
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:19,590
You're subnormal.
I don't propose to argue any further.

374
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:23,677
That darn road doesn't come within
10 kilometres of here.

375
00:25:23,886 --> 00:25:26,013
Across open country in that thing?

376
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:30,059
It'll be a little bumpy,
but we'll make it by 3 o'clock.

377
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:33,354
We won't get there before dark,
if we get there at all.

378
00:25:33,562 --> 00:25:38,373
This motorcycle will go anywhere, if
you help me get it out of the boat.

379
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:39,749
We'll be on the road in no time.

380
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,292
Pitch dark.

381
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:09,376
We're lost,
absolutely lost.

382
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:10,752
Is there a difference?

383
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:13,171
Haven't you got a bump
of direction?

384
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,132
It's the only kind
I haven't got.

385
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,884
Come on, you drive.
My back hurts.

386
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:21,805
You're the one who
checked out on the motorcycle.

387
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,975
Stop being so cute.
I hate you when you...

388
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:27,199
What's that?
Listen.

389
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:40,546
We must've been driving alongside
that road for the last hour.

390
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:42,131
Perhaps they just moved it there.

391
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,758
Oh, shut up.

392
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:56,034
There's a sign back there.
See what it says.

393
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:00,997
I don't suppose you have
a flashlight?

394
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:02,791
No, I haven't.

395
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:13,551
What does it say?

396
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,803
I can't see!

397
00:27:15,011 --> 00:27:17,027
Well, climb up, silly.

398
00:27:18,612 --> 00:27:20,739
Hurry up, it's starting
to rain.

399
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,163
What does it say?

400
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,040
I can't tell.
It's in German.

401
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,001
Well, move your arm!

402
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:36,296
You can come down now, Henri.

403
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:43,484
- What does it say?
- Never mind, get in.

404
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:45,778
- What does it say?
- "Wet paint".

405
00:27:45,987 --> 00:27:47,280
How many miles...?

406
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:52,952
No, Henri. No, no.
You'll get wet. Get in the sidecar.

407
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:54,787
I know.

408
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:56,414
Hurry up.

409
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:23,663
All right, we're in Bad Nauheim.
You can come out.

410
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:25,123
Are you sure?

411
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:28,043
Yes, I'm sure.
And bring my bag.

412
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:31,435
Good evening, come in.

413
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:34,522
Do you have any free rooms
for this evening?

414
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,567
Of course.
Do you want a one or two rooms?

415
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:41,445
- Two, please.
- What are you talking about?

416
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,364
He wanted to know if we want
one room or two.

417
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:45,616
- You told him?
- I told him.

418
00:28:47,118 --> 00:28:48,411
Come this way.

419
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:53,165
What's the matter?

420
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,548
My back, I think it's broken.
And it's all your fault.

421
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,437
If you'd got that cow out of the way,
we needn't have taken that detour.

422
00:29:00,645 --> 00:29:02,230
- It was a bull.
- Cow.

423
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:05,316
You said you couldn't tell
at 20 yards away.

424
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:10,238
I know, but it couldn't be a bull,
he would've had horns.

425
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:23,015
- Who is it?
- Cinderella.

426
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:24,224
What do you want?

427
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:25,476
My slipper.

428
00:29:25,684 --> 00:29:27,102
Well, open the door.

429
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:32,983
What do you want?

430
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:35,486
You just said that.
How's your back?

431
00:29:35,694 --> 00:29:37,821
Awful. It hurts.

432
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,656
Get into bed.

433
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:43,994
I will not get into bed.
What are you doing? What's that?

434
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:45,205
I brought you a drink.

435
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:47,470
I thought so.
I knew you'd get up to your...

436
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:50,932
And some liniment to rub your back.
Get into bed.

437
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:58,564
We'll need some water.

438
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:04,195
Take your shirt off too.

439
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:07,198
I am not going to take my shirt off.

440
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:09,575
How am I going to rub your back
through it?

441
00:30:09,784 --> 00:30:13,385
You won't rub my back through
anything, including my foolishness.

442
00:30:13,593 --> 00:30:14,928
Here, drink this.

443
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:19,224
Want some water?

444
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,435
No. It's good.

445
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:29,317
My back...

446
00:30:30,402 --> 00:30:32,154
Do you want it rubbed or not?

447
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:34,156
Is that stuff any good?

448
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:36,129
Turn over.

449
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,260
Wait a minute.

450
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:50,561
Stop bawling. I don't want them
to think we smuggled in a cow.

451
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,937
It stings.

452
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:53,773
It's supposed to.

453
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:56,484
Let it soak in for a while.

454
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:02,128
Relax.

455
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:04,881
You're dislocating everything.

456
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,508
Relax.

457
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:08,468
I hurt further up.

458
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:10,804
How can you relax
if you won't co-operate?

459
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:13,807
I said I hurt further up.

460
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:23,233
That's better.
Makes me feel sleepy.

461
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:24,943
Good.

462
00:31:29,044 --> 00:31:30,754
That's nice, Henri.

463
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:37,052
I'm sorry I thought when you came in
you were behaving like a stinker.

464
00:31:37,469 --> 00:31:39,471
You've been a stinker for so long,
I just didn't...

465
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:41,723
I know. Go to sleep.

466
00:31:42,015 --> 00:31:43,559
With you in the room?

467
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,061
I can't rub you from the hallway.

468
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:52,623
If I go to sleep,
will you promise to leave.

469
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,250
I'll go now.

470
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:55,543
No...

471
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,044
Feels good.

472
00:31:57,253 --> 00:31:59,130
Go to sleep, I'll be gone
in a minute.

473
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:05,178
Henri, about this mission...

474
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:06,679
Never mind.

475
00:32:06,888 --> 00:32:09,182
I just want to ask you a question.

476
00:32:09,807 --> 00:32:10,933
What?

477
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:13,936
Is this mission so important?

478
00:32:14,187 --> 00:32:18,038
It is to me. It's my last
assignment for the army.

479
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:20,081
I'm getting out next week.

480
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,043
I didn't know that.

481
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:26,713
Then, it is important,
isn't it?

482
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:33,053
Henri, I...

483
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:37,265
I'm so sleepy...

484
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:56,423
Good night.

485
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:09,121
She'll never believe me.

486
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,836
What happened? What happened?

487
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:15,383
You unspeakable weasel, I knew
you'd be up to your old tricks.

488
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:17,134
- That's ridiculous.
- Get out.

489
00:38:17,635 --> 00:38:19,512
- I said get out.
- I can't.

490
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,806
- Why not?
- The door handle came off.

491
00:38:22,014 --> 00:38:25,768
What an excuse.
Couldn't you think of a better one?

492
00:38:25,976 --> 00:38:28,646
- I don't believe you.
- You try to open the door.

493
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:30,442
All right, I will.

494
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:32,288
Try to open the door.

495
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:36,751
How did you do that?

496
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,837
You liar, you...

497
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,885
You're worse than I thought.
Put on your shoes and get out.

498
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:47,762
Don't speak to me.

499
00:38:47,971 --> 00:38:49,556
Do you understand?
Don't speak to me again.

500
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:51,474
Ever!

501
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:07,796
I don't want to talk to you.
Don't speak to me.

502
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:23,701
Stop banging on that door!

503
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:32,418
You can't come in!

504
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:34,003
I'm in.

505
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:36,756
Magic.

506
00:39:36,964 --> 00:39:40,927
Henri, I told you not to speak to me.
Someone's out there.

507
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:42,678
Perhaps they'll let me out.

508
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,014
Who is it?
Wer ist da?

509
00:39:45,224 --> 00:39:48,073
It's me, the innkeeper's wife.

510
00:39:49,116 --> 00:39:53,870
Ein Moment. We must do something.
I know, get out that window.

511
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:57,916
You can't be found here.
Don't argue.

512
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:00,544
American women...

513
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:06,842
But...

514
00:40:16,991 --> 00:40:18,242
Come in.

515
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:20,786
Guten Morgen.

516
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:24,915
Morgen, Fraulein.
The door handle came off.

517
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:29,211
It's happened before.
I put it back. I'm very sorry.

518
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:48,244
Climbing in the nice
young lady's room?

519
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:49,537
Raus hier!

520
00:40:49,704 --> 00:40:51,164
Raus hier!

521
00:40:53,124 --> 00:40:54,334
Henri!

522
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:08,445
Come in.

523
00:41:09,571 --> 00:41:12,157
Excuse me, I was looking for
Captain...

524
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:14,451
Henri. No...

525
00:41:16,578 --> 00:41:17,579
What do you want?

526
00:41:17,788 --> 00:41:19,414
You look like an organ grinder.

527
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:23,877
Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

528
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,812
- What was that?
- The innkeeper. I've borrowed his clothes.

529
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,313
Why?

530
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,650
I came here to find
Herr Schindler.

531
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:37,196
I'm going to the black market
hangouts to see what I can find out.

532
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:41,033
If I'm in uniform, no one will
tell me anything. Is that reasonable?

533
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:42,785
See you later.

534
00:41:43,494 --> 00:41:45,621
- Don't you want any help?
- No.

535
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,540
Oh, now, Henri...

536
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:52,642
I'm sorry about the door handle.
You were telling the truth.

537
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:54,769
Nice of you to apologise.
That fixes everything.

538
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:56,229
What more can I do?

539
00:41:56,438 --> 00:41:57,397
I often wonder.

540
00:41:57,606 --> 00:42:00,859
Henri, stop being like that.
You're behaving like a little boy.

541
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:03,820
- I know it.
- You said it was important, I just want to help.

542
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:07,908
- Never mind.
- Can I try to find Schlindler on my own?

543
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,661
- I could do something...
- Don't do anything.

544
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,497
You make me so mad,
you don't want my help.

545
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:16,722
Don't do anything. If you see me,
don't speak to me, you don't know me.

546
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:17,890
Why not?

547
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:21,727
You're in uniform. They'll think
I'm a stool pigeon.

548
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:23,854
Can't I go out by myself?

549
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:26,106
Just take orders.
Remember, you don't know me.

550
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:28,067
- All right.
- You can't speak to me.

551
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:30,820
- Okay.
- I'm transparent, you can't see me.

552
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:33,197
I never could,
not for sour apples.

553
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:35,407
You stubborn...

554
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,205
He makes me so mad, I could...

555
00:42:43,012 --> 00:42:44,973
Catherine.
Catherine Gates.

556
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:47,642
Jowitt, how are you?
Good to see you.

557
00:42:47,851 --> 00:42:49,269
What are you doing here?

558
00:42:49,477 --> 00:42:52,981
I'm on a mission. I'll tell you
about it. Shall we get breakfast?

559
00:42:53,189 --> 00:42:54,566
I know where we can get
real coffee.

560
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:57,277
Come on.
Will you be here long?

561
00:42:57,485 --> 00:42:58,653
Just for a couple of days.

562
00:42:58,862 --> 00:43:00,071
Fine.

563
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,338
Here we are.
Bill Trumble, Catherine Gates.

564
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:07,926
Hello. How are you?

565
00:43:08,427 --> 00:43:09,761
Sit down.

566
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,307
- Catherine just got in.
- Guten Morgen.

567
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:15,392
Want anything besides coffee?

568
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:17,019
Jam rolls, anything.

569
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,146
- Make it for two.
- Jawohl.

570
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:20,689
How long will you be here?

571
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,940
Just a couple of days.

572
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:23,609
You haven't said
why you're here.

573
00:43:23,817 --> 00:43:26,236
It's not much of a story...

574
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:33,591
Isn't that the fellow you were
talking to at the inn?

575
00:43:33,841 --> 00:43:35,051
Yes, that's him.

576
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:38,638
He's going into the wrong place.
That's a black market hangout.

577
00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:40,932
Bill has a friend
in the MPs.

578
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,643
The German police are going
to raid that place this morning.

579
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:45,728
The place he just went into?

580
00:43:46,062 --> 00:43:49,524
- That's why we're here for breakfast.
- Get a floor show for free.

581
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:52,151
You couldn't have chosen
a better spot.

582
00:43:54,403 --> 00:43:57,379
Here they are now.
Watch them operate.

583
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:29,967
She can identify me, an officer
of the U.S. army. Come here.

584
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:33,888
Catherine, tell these men who I am.
Identify me, please.

585
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:35,389
Is something wrong, officer?

586
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:38,893
Lieutenant, he says he's a French
officer and you know him.

587
00:44:39,101 --> 00:44:41,020
I never saw him before in my life.

588
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:42,354
That's what I thought!

589
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:45,948
You shouldn't have done this.
I'll get even!

590
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,373
I'll get even!

591
00:44:50,084 --> 00:44:52,378
I'll get even, traitor!
I'll get even!

592
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:56,466
What is going on here?

593
00:44:57,425 --> 00:44:58,927
I'll tell you later.

594
00:44:59,135 --> 00:45:02,722
Could you help me find a German
lens grinder named Schindler?

595
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:05,308
- Sure.
- We ought to be able to help.

596
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:06,768
Think so?

597
00:45:15,332 --> 00:45:16,375
Is this the man?

598
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:18,669
Yes, that's Captain Rochard.
Good morning, Henri.

599
00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:21,838
I trust you understand.
There was nothing else we could do.

600
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,383
No identity card...
It was not really our fault.

601
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:27,469
Don't worry, I'm entirely aware
of whose fault it was.

602
00:45:27,678 --> 00:45:29,554
Henri, I did exactly as you told me.

603
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:31,932
Thank you, Captain.

604
00:45:32,307 --> 00:45:35,396
One question.
Why have you no beds here?

605
00:45:35,606 --> 00:45:36,784
Didn't you have a bed?

606
00:45:36,993 --> 00:45:40,621
You see, when we had beds,
everyone wished to be arrested.

607
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,542
It was terrible. People did anything,
just so they could have a bed.

608
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:45,918
I know how they felt.

609
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:47,545
Poor dear,
you haven't had a wink...

610
00:45:47,753 --> 00:45:50,381
Shut up.
May I go now?

611
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:51,799
Of course.

612
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:55,344
Thank you very much.
I'd like a word with you, outside.

613
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:58,097
Of course,
I want to talk to you, too.

614
00:46:01,446 --> 00:46:02,782
I want you to meet this...

615
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:06,077
Listen, you bug-eyed traitor,
remember this:

616
00:46:06,286 --> 00:46:10,707
I'll get even, I swear. Even if
it takes years, if it takes forever.

617
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:13,918
Go away, I'm busy.
I'll break you...

618
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:18,465
like a dry twig, I'll turn you
into a shaky old woman...

619
00:46:18,673 --> 00:46:20,717
I said I was busy.
...with tin cup.

620
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:21,926
This is the man...

621
00:46:22,135 --> 00:46:26,316
I understand you can be a rat, but
there's one thing that baffles me...

622
00:46:26,526 --> 00:46:28,072
There's no pleasing some people.

623
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,741
It's your job.
The army gave you an assignment.

624
00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:32,952
You took an oath as an officer,
the oath of duty.

625
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,370
I followed your orders.

626
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,164
We'll never find Schindler.
Where is he now?

627
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:41,168
He'll have heard I'm looking for him
and gone underground.

628
00:46:41,377 --> 00:46:44,588
I know how those fellows work.
What do you want? Who are you?.

629
00:46:44,797 --> 00:46:48,008
- Schindler.
- Fine. Will you please stop...?

630
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:51,566
You're Schindler?
Why didn't you say so?

631
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:54,278
You wouldn't give anyone a chance
to say a word.

632
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:59,575
Button your big lip so he can talk.
He hasn't much time before his train.

633
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:04,956
I just wanted to say I'm so glad,
so grateful, so full of happiness.

634
00:47:05,248 --> 00:47:07,041
Thank you.
Well, goodbye.

635
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,043
- Wait, I want to talk to you.
- He'll miss his train.

636
00:47:09,252 --> 00:47:12,255
I'm going to Paris,
French Economic Bureau.

637
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:15,174
I have my passport,
documents and contract.

638
00:47:15,385 --> 00:47:16,647
I took them out of your briefcase.

639
00:47:16,857 --> 00:47:20,152
This wonderful lady
gave and told me everything.

640
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,196
So, I leave Germany now.

641
00:47:24,114 --> 00:47:26,450
I never wanted to be
in the black market.

642
00:47:26,658 --> 00:47:27,909
I'm a scientist.

643
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:31,621
Now, I'll work for science
and for France.

644
00:47:32,581 --> 00:47:35,167
No more like a thief
in the night.

645
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,878
Thank you. Thank you.

646
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:39,504
Goodbye.

647
00:47:43,105 --> 00:47:44,899
Thank you again.
Goodbye.

648
00:47:47,026 --> 00:47:48,486
Nice little guy.

649
00:48:00,873 --> 00:48:02,083
So, you found him...

650
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:05,169
I ran into him.
Someone I knew, knew him.

651
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,686
He was very anxious to go,
as you heard.

652
00:48:07,894 --> 00:48:09,187
It was easy.

653
00:48:09,396 --> 00:48:10,855
Yeah, easy.

654
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:12,857
Easy.

655
00:48:36,895 --> 00:48:39,398
Go ahead, start hollering,
calling me names...

656
00:48:39,606 --> 00:48:41,442
Guten Morgen.
Was darf sein, bitte?

657
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,110
Bitte, haben Sie kaffee?

658
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:44,486
Zwei, bitte.

659
00:48:44,695 --> 00:48:46,530
Just a minute,
do you speak English?

660
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:47,990
Sure.

661
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:52,077
You know, there's nothing I've ever
really wanted in life.

662
00:48:52,286 --> 00:48:56,005
Fame, money, position.
Nothing, until now.

663
00:48:56,384 --> 00:49:00,850
There's just one thing: never
to see you again as long as I live.

664
00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:05,730
That was a rotten thing to say...
Will you get the coffee, please?

665
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:08,066
That was mean rotten.

666
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:13,404
Maybe, but it wasn't accidental.
Fortunately, I'm leaving the army.

667
00:49:13,738 --> 00:49:17,867
I'll be a civilian. Never again
can they order me to work with you.

668
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:20,624
I'm going back to Heidelberg
by train.

669
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:24,679
Get some other chump to torture
in that sidecar.

670
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,809
I know why you're mad. I don't
blame you, I would be too.

671
00:49:29,017 --> 00:49:32,938
I knew it was your last job.
I didn't think, I spoiled it for you.

672
00:49:33,146 --> 00:49:36,483
I'd give anything if I hadn't.
I'd cut off my arm, almost.

673
00:49:36,691 --> 00:49:39,111
I like you, Henri.
I can't help it.

674
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:42,197
You're stubborn
and you don't know anything,

675
00:49:42,406 --> 00:49:46,294
but I don't want you to disappear
without saying you'll write,

676
00:49:46,504 --> 00:49:49,677
or kick me, or use my toothbrush.

677
00:49:49,885 --> 00:49:53,097
I wouldn't put it past you.
After all we've been to each other.

678
00:49:53,305 --> 00:49:54,432
And all we haven't been.

679
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,352
After all we've done together.
And all we haven't.

680
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:02,523
I know that's not your fault.
It's mine and I feel...

681
00:50:02,857 --> 00:50:07,194
I'm making a fool of myself.
Now, get out or say something nice.

682
00:50:09,363 --> 00:50:10,829
I don't know, Catherine...

683
00:50:10,997 --> 00:50:14,174
That was nice, Henri.
Please, say more.

684
00:50:16,968 --> 00:50:19,429
If we're going to get back
before dark, we better be going.

685
00:50:19,637 --> 00:50:21,181
Henri...

686
00:50:22,182 --> 00:50:25,977
But, Catherine, just one thing.
Pay for the coffee.

687
00:50:26,811 --> 00:50:28,188
Yes, Henri.

688
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:53,018
What happened?

689
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:58,607
You went to sleep so I pulled over.
I thought this would be better.

690
00:50:58,816 --> 00:50:59,858
Thank you.

691
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:03,292
I've been thinking.
Why do we fight all the time?

692
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:04,710
You tell me.

693
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:06,963
Sex antagonism, I guess.

694
00:51:07,171 --> 00:51:08,214
What does that mean?

695
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:12,051
I think it means just the opposite
of what it sounds like.

696
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,886
I can't even think
what it sounds like.

697
00:51:14,095 --> 00:51:18,015
Henri, I think it means we like
each other, but won't admit it.

698
00:51:18,224 --> 00:51:22,687
I'd like it distinctly understood...
If I weren't so sleepy...

699
00:51:22,895 --> 00:51:24,647
Don't do it. Go to sleep.

700
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,619
I will.

701
00:51:44,862 --> 00:51:45,989
Are you all right?

702
00:51:46,197 --> 00:51:47,907
- Go back to sleep.
- Why are we stopping?

703
00:51:48,116 --> 00:51:50,827
I want to see a man about a road.
I'll be back in a minute.

704
00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:52,623
Take your time.

705
00:52:14,156 --> 00:52:15,532
Aufwiedersehen!

706
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,714
Henri! Henri!

707
00:52:20,259 --> 00:52:24,722
You know, Catherine, I don't mind
being the first to say it:

708
00:52:25,056 --> 00:52:27,141
I like you very much.

709
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:30,436
In fact, I'd miss you
if you weren't here.

710
00:52:31,312 --> 00:52:32,772
Henri, stop!

711
00:52:33,064 --> 00:52:35,483
Come back! Henri!

712
00:52:46,049 --> 00:52:47,300
Oh, no...

713
00:52:53,223 --> 00:52:56,268
Catherine, now that I've told you
how I feel...

714
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:57,978
My, this is terribly bumpy.

715
00:52:59,354 --> 00:53:00,689
Look out!

716
00:53:05,443 --> 00:53:07,153
Catherine! Catherine!

717
00:53:07,405 --> 00:53:10,004
Darling, are you all right?
Where are you?

718
00:53:10,212 --> 00:53:12,256
Yes, I'm here. I'm coming.

719
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,805
I can hear you,
but I can't find you.

720
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,599
Darling, are you all right?
Where are you?

721
00:53:22,808 --> 00:53:24,101
Here I am, over here.

722
00:53:25,477 --> 00:53:26,729
There you are.

723
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:30,232
Darling,
thank goodness you're safe.

724
00:53:31,483 --> 00:53:33,117
How did you get out there?

725
00:53:35,126 --> 00:53:36,794
Wait a minute.

726
00:53:37,003 --> 00:53:39,339
I'm all out of breath
from chasing you.

727
00:53:40,048 --> 00:53:43,259
Chasing me?
You weren't on the motorcycle?

728
00:53:43,468 --> 00:53:45,637
You were by yourself.

729
00:53:46,095 --> 00:53:47,639
You got off and left me.

730
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:52,352
Henri, what's all this "darling"
business you were mumbling about?

731
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:54,354
Darling?
Did I say that?

732
00:53:54,562 --> 00:53:55,647
I heard you.

733
00:53:55,855 --> 00:53:57,568
Probably fright, it's natural.

734
00:53:57,778 --> 00:53:59,581
Did you mean me?

735
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:02,584
I think I was stunned
momentarily.

736
00:54:02,793 --> 00:54:07,005
Maybe, but you looked like you were
going to kiss me when you saw me.

737
00:54:07,089 --> 00:54:08,131
I what?

738
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:11,510
I wish you had. I've never
been kissed by a Frenchman.

739
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,513
What's so strange about that?

740
00:54:14,721 --> 00:54:16,556
You know what people say.

741
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:17,933
That's nonsense.

742
00:54:18,141 --> 00:54:19,518
You hear people talk...

743
00:54:19,726 --> 00:54:21,561
We're no different than
anybody else.

744
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:24,870
- I don't know, I've just heard talk.
- That's silly.

745
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,041
- Why don't you try it and let me see?
- Catherine...

746
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,002
It's the only way to find out.

747
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:32,461
But it's so silly.

748
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,047
No harm in trying,
is there?

749
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:36,924
I suppose not.

750
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:38,592
All right, go ahead.

751
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:43,014
- Are you ready?
- Sure.

752
00:54:47,857 --> 00:54:50,910
That was no good,
that wasn't different at all.

753
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,329
I told you it wouldn't be.

754
00:54:53,538 --> 00:54:55,582
I thought it'd be better than that.

755
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:59,169
You didn't give me
much of a chance.

756
00:54:59,377 --> 00:55:00,420
That wasn't fair.

757
00:55:00,628 --> 00:55:02,255
Of course it wasn't.

758
00:55:02,464 --> 00:55:03,548
I ought to give you
another chance.

759
00:55:03,757 --> 00:55:04,758
Yes, you ought.

760
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:06,885
Go ahead, try again.

761
00:55:07,093 --> 00:55:08,303
All right.

762
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:11,056
Come here.

763
00:55:16,241 --> 00:55:19,078
Well, that was a little better.

764
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:23,123
See? Could've been even better
if I'd had some co-operation.

765
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,833
If I'd had a French girl here...

766
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:27,419
What do you mean
by that remark?

767
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:30,464
You haven't been giving me
much help.

768
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:33,759
- You think a French girl could do better?
- Yes, I do.

769
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:36,303
- Do you want to try again?
- Yes.

770
00:55:36,512 --> 00:55:38,145
So do I.

771
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:43,074
Wait a minute. Lean back.
Comfortable?

772
00:55:43,282 --> 00:55:44,492
Yes.

773
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:49,247
Major, we want to get married.

774
00:55:49,455 --> 00:55:51,958
When did you reach that decision?

775
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:54,085
This afternoon, about 2:30.

776
00:55:54,293 --> 00:55:56,713
In a haystack,
Henri was on the motorcycle...

777
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:59,465
I don't think the major will be
interested in the details.

778
00:55:59,674 --> 00:56:02,344
And you two didn't want
to go away together.

779
00:56:02,554 --> 00:56:04,901
It would seem your mission
was very successful.

780
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:07,154
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

781
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:08,405
You're the first to know.

782
00:56:08,613 --> 00:56:12,117
I guessed as much. As to getting
married, there's one hitch.

783
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:14,453
- Itch?
- It's probably the haystack...

784
00:56:14,578 --> 00:56:15,537
I don't...

785
00:56:15,662 --> 00:56:20,083
Hitch. Marriages between American
military personnel and aliens,

786
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:24,421
and you come under that heading,
must be approved by the general.

787
00:56:24,629 --> 00:56:26,715
There's a set procedure.

788
00:56:26,923 --> 00:56:28,056
It's only red tape.

789
00:56:28,266 --> 00:56:29,398
Do you itch, Catherine?

790
00:56:29,607 --> 00:56:33,069
She said "hitch".
We've got to get things approved.

791
00:56:33,277 --> 00:56:37,239
Here are the forms.
Fill them out in quadruplicate.

792
00:56:37,448 --> 00:56:41,243
When completed, send them to
the Colonel's office. And good luck.

793
00:56:45,081 --> 00:56:46,123
Goodbye, Captain.

794
00:56:46,332 --> 00:56:47,333
Yes.

795
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:52,548
Is she always so confusing?

796
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:56,523
No, but this will be. Look at
all this stuff we've got to fill in.

797
00:56:56,731 --> 00:56:58,066
She said there were only four.

798
00:56:58,274 --> 00:57:02,362
You misheard. She said four of each.
Let's go to my room to work.

799
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:04,364
Fine. Wait a minute.

800
00:57:08,326 --> 00:57:09,452
Souvenir.

801
00:57:09,661 --> 00:57:11,996
You'll end up with a pocketful.

802
00:57:17,504 --> 00:57:18,975
This is impossible.

803
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:21,228
Don't give up now,
we're half way through.

804
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:24,440
My uncle's politics, my aunt's
religion, any warts...

805
00:57:24,648 --> 00:57:27,818
By the way, my Aunt's name is Fanny.
Put that down.

806
00:57:28,485 --> 00:57:31,864
Any identifying scars on
my second cousin's clavicle...

807
00:57:32,197 --> 00:57:36,827
We'll never get this done. Look
at this: "Name your father's gender".

808
00:57:37,035 --> 00:57:38,245
No...

809
00:57:38,495 --> 00:57:39,621
It says so.

810
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:43,635
No, father's birthplace.
Gender belongs to this question.

811
00:57:43,846 --> 00:57:45,349
I thought there was
something wrong.

812
00:57:45,558 --> 00:57:48,895
Idiot. Were you ever captured
by Peruvian Indians?

813
00:57:48,978 --> 00:57:49,937
No, why?

814
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:53,357
I understand they do a good job
of shrinking heads.

815
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:57,445
Come on, let's take time out.

816
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,577
There are a lot of things
I'd rather do than answer questions.

817
00:58:04,786 --> 00:58:06,537
This, for instance?

818
00:58:10,096 --> 00:58:12,599
Maybe I better go back and see
another double feature.

819
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:14,309
No, come on in.

820
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:17,062
We're still filling out forms.

821
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,066
If anyone wants to do that with me,
let me know. I'm going to sleep.

822
00:58:21,274 --> 00:58:24,402
Good night.
We've got to get busy.

823
00:58:26,947 --> 00:58:28,782
Why do we have to go through
all this?

824
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:32,077
It's the army's way of finding out
if you really want to get married.

825
00:58:32,285 --> 00:58:34,050
I know a much better way.

826
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:38,268
Mayor Prendergast. Yes.

827
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:41,688
At ease, Gates.
That'll be all right.

828
00:59:42,814 --> 00:59:43,774
Well, Gates?

829
00:59:43,774 --> 00:59:48,622
I'm sorry to bother you, but we
haven't heard a word in over a week.

830
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:50,628
Your papers must've bogged down.

831
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:55,132
Isn't there something you can do?
He's getting nervous, and so am I.

832
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,385
I'll see what I can do.
I'll let you know.

833
00:59:57,593 --> 00:59:59,011
Thank you, Major.

834
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,972
- Gates...
- Yes?

835
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,307
He is worth waiting for,
isn't he?

836
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:07,854
He is now. I don't know what
he'll be like by the time I get him.

837
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:23,374
I can't understand her marrying
a foreigner she hardly knows.

838
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:27,378
- It's ridiculous and disgraceful.
- I can't see why she wants to.

839
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:29,297
You better get glasses.

840
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:33,050
Why are you women such pushovers for
this parlez-vous hand kissing?

841
01:00:33,259 --> 01:00:35,678
Hand kissing?
He does more than that.

842
01:00:35,887 --> 01:00:40,614
Catherine told me he was plum crazy,
chasing her and beating her up.

843
01:00:40,822 --> 01:00:43,366
He left marks all over her,
I saw them.

844
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:45,869
He could leave marks on me any time.
I'd bring the stick.

845
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:48,872
It wasn't a stick.
He kicked her right in the...

846
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,582
- What?
- He did.

847
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:53,168
- Hi, Catherine.
- We were just talking about you.

848
01:00:53,376 --> 01:00:54,336
I bet you were.

849
01:01:02,218 --> 01:01:04,103
Well, say something.
Did you see her?

850
01:01:04,313 --> 01:01:07,196
Don't lose your temper.
The papers are stuck somewhere.

851
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:08,280
Stuck how?

852
01:01:08,322 --> 01:01:10,532
Bogged down,
lying on someone's desk.

853
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:11,784
What for?

854
01:01:11,992 --> 01:01:13,827
Henri, please.
I don't know.

855
01:01:14,036 --> 01:01:16,455
They let other people get married.
What've they got against you?

856
01:01:16,664 --> 01:01:19,208
Me? It'll be you
they're investigating.

857
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:20,626
Nonsense. Why should they?

858
01:01:20,834 --> 01:01:22,253
Please.
There are other people here.

859
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:23,837
Why should they investigate me?

860
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:26,840
Because the American army
is very careful.

861
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:30,108
They better be, or they won't have
any American children.

862
01:01:30,316 --> 01:01:31,985
Will you lower your voice?

863
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:34,612
I'll do better.
I'll take it somewhere else.

864
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:37,073
Do that. And while you're
about it, go bag your oars.

865
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:39,492
Bag your oars? What's that?
More army talk?

866
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:42,370
- Navy.
- Naval talk. Charming.

867
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:44,497
- You make me sick.
- Good.

868
01:01:44,706 --> 01:01:45,790
Henri...

869
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:51,921
Excuse me.

870
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,566
Catherine, let me ask you something
like a brother.

871
01:01:57,774 --> 01:01:59,318
Do you really want to marry
that phoney joker?

872
01:01:59,526 --> 01:02:01,111
- Certainly not.
- You're kidding?

873
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,697
I hope he chokes, slowly.
Very slowly.

874
01:02:03,905 --> 01:02:07,826
That's what I said. A girl like you
couldn't make a mistake like that.

875
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:09,745
Thank heavens for army red tape.

876
01:02:09,953 --> 01:02:12,205
Don't thank the army.
Thank me, personally.

877
01:02:12,414 --> 01:02:13,415
You? Why?

878
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,668
I hid the papers.
I knew you'd change your mind.

879
01:02:17,002 --> 01:02:19,809
- You hid the papers?
- I knew I was doing you a favour.

880
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:21,145
You hid the papers...

881
01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:24,565
I filed them. I don't mind
going out on a limb for a friend.

882
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,193
It was taking a chance, sure...

883
01:02:41,999 --> 01:02:46,351
Now, your marriage. Catherine, you
want me to marry you in my church.

884
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,313
And you, Henri, promised the pastor
of your parish he'd do the job.

885
01:02:50,522 --> 01:02:52,691
- Yes.
- You better have both marriages.

886
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:55,193
I think he's right, Henri.
Let's get started.

887
01:02:55,402 --> 01:02:57,237
Just a moment.
There's more to it.

888
01:02:57,445 --> 01:03:01,032
Under German law, recognised
by the occupying army,

889
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:05,453
you have to go through a civil
ceremony before the church ceremony.

890
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:09,384
So you have to be married by
the Burgermeister in Heidelberg

891
01:03:09,593 --> 01:03:11,807
and then, come to me,
and then go to Henri's pastor.

892
01:03:12,016 --> 01:03:13,142
That makes three times.

893
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,560
Three?

894
01:03:14,893 --> 01:03:20,065
In China, the bride and groom drink
tea out of the same bowl, that's it.

895
01:03:20,357 --> 01:03:22,359
- Are you Chinese?
- Of course not.

896
01:03:22,568 --> 01:03:25,279
- I thought not. I'm not.
- What brought that up?

897
01:03:25,487 --> 01:03:27,948
- You mentioned drinking tea.
- I was telling the chaplain...

898
01:03:28,157 --> 01:03:30,659
I'll drink tea with you.

899
01:03:30,868 --> 01:03:32,119
Stop it.

900
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:35,011
Perhaps I shouldn't go through
with this.

901
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:36,888
You can still say no.

902
01:03:37,096 --> 01:03:39,140
We'll go to the Burgermeister
and come back.

903
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:41,517
- I'll be ready, any time.
- Thank you.

904
01:03:41,726 --> 01:03:43,770
Don't pay any attention to her.

905
01:03:44,896 --> 01:03:46,939
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

906
01:03:48,566 --> 01:03:52,403
Captain Henri Rochard,
Catherine Gates...

907
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:00,676
You've decided to live
your future life together.

908
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:13,814
...and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto him,

909
01:04:14,022 --> 01:04:15,857
so long as you both shall live?

910
01:04:16,066 --> 01:04:17,109
I will.

911
01:04:17,317 --> 01:04:18,860
Please join right hands.

912
01:04:21,655 --> 01:04:23,956
Henri, will you repeat after me,

913
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,132
I, Henri...

914
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:29,218
take thee, Catherine...

915
01:04:29,552 --> 01:04:31,220
to be my wedded wife...

916
01:04:47,862 --> 01:04:49,498
He wants the ring.

917
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,129
I haven't got it.

918
01:04:51,337 --> 01:04:52,338
Here.

919
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:01,931
Je t'épouse avec cet anneau.

920
01:05:34,186 --> 01:05:35,938
Well, like it?

921
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:39,367
I like it.

922
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:45,962
It's been quite a day.

923
01:05:46,462 --> 01:05:48,798
We're a lot married,
three times.

924
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:50,675
It was worth it.

925
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:55,096
I don't see how we could ever
get a divorce.

926
01:05:55,304 --> 01:05:58,724
It would be like unwinding
the inside of a golf ball.

927
01:05:59,142 --> 01:06:00,601
Want some more coffee?

928
01:06:00,935 --> 01:06:04,574
I just had four cups.
Besides, it keeps me awake.

929
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:10,959
What's the matter?

930
01:06:11,877 --> 01:06:14,713
I'm just thinking about
a friend on his wedding night.

931
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,298
What happened?

932
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,050
You see, he was...

933
01:06:34,246 --> 01:06:38,793
Pardon, monsieur. Il y a
quelque chose que vous voulez?

934
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:41,003
Non, non, non.
Bon soir.

935
01:06:49,845 --> 01:06:51,931
- Tell me about it.
- What?

936
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:54,485
Your friend,
on his wedding night.

937
01:06:54,736 --> 01:06:56,032
I'm not so sure I can tell you.

938
01:06:56,241 --> 01:06:57,659
Of course you can.

939
01:06:57,867 --> 01:07:00,203
That's right,
I can now, can't I?

940
01:07:00,954 --> 01:07:02,914
Well, here's what happened...

941
01:07:06,459 --> 01:07:08,545
This is just like
my friend's story.

942
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:18,642
- Now what?
- Can I come in?

943
01:07:18,853 --> 01:07:21,488
- You're in.
- I didn't want to come, but...

944
01:07:21,864 --> 01:07:23,323
Then go away.

945
01:07:23,532 --> 01:07:26,326
Kitty, why are you here?
I thought you'd gone back.

946
01:07:26,535 --> 01:07:28,912
Of all the times...
What do you want, anyway?

947
01:07:29,121 --> 01:07:31,415
- I certainly didn't want to come here.
- Then go away.

948
01:07:31,623 --> 01:07:33,876
I've got something to tell you
and you're not going to like it.

949
01:07:33,959 --> 01:07:34,710
What?

950
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:38,672
The Colonel gave orders you're to
leave for Heidelberg in 20 minutes.

951
01:07:38,881 --> 01:07:42,384
- You're kidding!
- The whole outfit's going back to America.

952
01:07:42,593 --> 01:07:46,903
America? Well, not right away.
We don't have to leave tonight.

953
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:49,655
Maybe you don't, but Catherine does.
Those are orders.

954
01:07:49,864 --> 01:07:51,908
- When do I have to report?
- Not until morning.

955
01:07:52,116 --> 01:07:55,161
Then we stay here, fly back
and report in the morning.

956
01:07:55,369 --> 01:07:57,705
Tell the Colonel
you couldn't find us.

957
01:07:57,914 --> 01:08:00,875
He said if I tried to pull that one,
we'd both be sorry.

958
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,752
I'm in a spot,
so are you.

959
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,714
Get working on Henri's passport,
or he won't be able to sail with you.

960
01:08:06,923 --> 01:08:08,385
Henri, we're dead.

961
01:08:09,183 --> 01:08:11,233
This is a fine wedding night!

962
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:14,402
Find a place to stay in Heidelberg,
it's better than nothing.

963
01:08:14,611 --> 01:08:15,695
What do you mean, nothing?

964
01:08:15,904 --> 01:08:18,198
Start packing.
You've only got 20 minutes.

965
01:08:18,406 --> 01:08:19,741
How do we get back from here?

966
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,202
Plane to Frankfurt,
there'll be a jeep there.

967
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:23,411
See you later.

968
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:26,289
Orders are I'm to stick with you
till you get back to Heidelberg.

969
01:08:26,498 --> 01:08:27,666
Orders...

970
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:29,209
Orders?

971
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:32,420
Orders...

972
01:08:34,137 --> 01:08:36,355
They wouldn't do this
in the French army.

973
01:08:37,189 --> 01:08:38,566
Poor Henri...

974
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:58,128
- Want me to wait for you?
- What do you mean?

975
01:08:58,338 --> 01:09:01,519
- All night?
- I don't think it'll be that long.

976
01:09:02,937 --> 01:09:05,106
What trouble
are you dreaming up now?

977
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:10,403
Where you're going it says B.O. Q:
Bachelor Officers' Quarters.

978
01:09:10,778 --> 01:09:14,908
I don't care. That's where I live
and where I'll take my wife.

979
01:09:15,116 --> 01:09:16,492
It's against regulations.

980
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:19,704
Who cares about regulations
at a time like this?

981
01:09:19,913 --> 01:09:23,461
Besides, I know the sergeant
and he always looks the other...

982
01:09:25,432 --> 01:09:27,935
He's a very nice fellow
from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

983
01:09:28,143 --> 01:09:30,854
Please take the lieutenant home.
Goodnight, Kitty.

984
01:09:31,063 --> 01:09:32,773
- Goodnight.
- Come along.

985
01:09:32,981 --> 01:09:34,650
- But...
- Please.

986
01:09:34,858 --> 01:09:37,653
- Goodnight, Kitty.
- Goodnight. Hope it works.

987
01:09:37,861 --> 01:09:39,613
Leave it to me.

988
01:09:52,848 --> 01:09:53,891
It's just us.

989
01:09:54,016 --> 01:09:56,352
B.O. Q means.
Bachelor Officers' Quarters.

990
01:09:57,436 --> 01:10:01,899
We went to six hotels, and
they're all against regulations...

991
01:10:02,108 --> 01:10:03,109
What's the matter?

992
01:10:03,317 --> 01:10:06,112
Billings is on the couch.
Thompson and Kay are in the bedroom.

993
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,406
- What are they doing here?
- Sleeping.

994
01:10:09,073 --> 01:10:11,117
- Come on.
- Where?

995
01:10:11,325 --> 01:10:15,175
Since time began, man has always
found a place for his mate,

996
01:10:15,343 --> 01:10:16,720
even if it was a cave.

997
01:10:16,928 --> 01:10:21,975
Tonight, mankind's a flop.
You haven't a cave or even a bed...

998
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:25,687
It's 3 am
and it's my wedding night...

999
01:10:25,896 --> 01:10:29,274
My feet hurt,
I couldn't walk another step...

1000
01:10:29,649 --> 01:10:32,277
Yes, darling, yes.
Do you want to sleep here?

1001
01:10:32,485 --> 01:10:36,823
No. I mean yes, but I want you
to sleep here too.

1002
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:40,173
You can bunk up with me
and he can sleep in the bathroom.

1003
01:10:40,674 --> 01:10:41,842
Sitting up?

1004
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:44,428
It's not so bad.
I slept in a bathtub once.

1005
01:10:44,637 --> 01:10:46,013
On your wedding night?

1006
01:10:46,221 --> 01:10:48,891
No. I'll get you some blankets
and a pillow.

1007
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:51,602
Come along, dear.

1008
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:58,275
How could it turn out like this?
I always planned a wonderful...

1009
01:10:58,484 --> 01:11:00,444
I know, I know.
Come on.

1010
01:11:12,762 --> 01:11:16,933
The bathroom's there.
Goodnight, Henri.

1011
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,895
Good night, dear.

1012
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,067
Oh, everything's wrong.

1013
01:11:26,484 --> 01:11:30,377
I can't wear my new nightgown,
there isn't any rice...

1014
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:32,963
Maybe Kitty has some mothballs.

1015
01:11:33,839 --> 01:11:35,924
I don't think it's funny.

1016
01:11:36,174 --> 01:11:37,968
Me, in one room
and you, in a bathtub...

1017
01:11:38,176 --> 01:11:40,679
Yes, dear,
but never mind.

1018
01:11:42,055 --> 01:11:45,142
Goodnight, darling.
Don't cry, I'll be all right.

1019
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:47,811
I'll be quite comfortable.

1020
01:11:48,395 --> 01:11:50,397
I'll just turn on the cold water.

1021
01:12:37,305 --> 01:12:40,600
Come on, Henri, hurry up.
We've a lot to do.

1022
01:12:40,809 --> 01:12:43,691
I am hurrying.
This is as fast as I can go.

1023
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:46,704
Straighten up, you look like
a question mark.

1024
01:12:46,912 --> 01:12:48,664
- Thank you.
- That's better.

1025
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:53,669
What a place to put a faucet,
in the middle of my back.

1026
01:12:54,044 --> 01:12:57,631
It is unusual. Cheer up, tonight
you'll have a bed to sleep on.

1027
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,425
That's just it.

1028
01:12:59,758 --> 01:13:04,471
I don't mean to sound cranky,
but this is so unnatural...

1029
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,227
I'll be at B.O. Q and you'll be
miles away. All because the army...

1030
01:13:08,437 --> 01:13:12,910
We haven't time to look for somewhere
else, we have to see the Consul.

1031
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:14,746
Come on.
What are you doing in the gutter?

1032
01:13:14,954 --> 01:13:16,622
Where else would I be?

1033
01:13:18,624 --> 01:13:22,128
I know it's very important
and you're in a hurry,

1034
01:13:22,337 --> 01:13:23,755
but it won't be easy.

1035
01:13:23,963 --> 01:13:27,633
Take the matter of support: Captain,
have you any money in the US?

1036
01:13:27,759 --> 01:13:28,676
No.

1037
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:33,308
And the laws of your country only
allow you to take a nominal amount.

1038
01:13:33,517 --> 01:13:35,070
Yes, that's right.

1039
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,201
A visitor's visa is no good,
you couldn't take a job.

1040
01:13:39,409 --> 01:13:42,704
And unless your wife can prove
she's able to support you,

1041
01:13:42,913 --> 01:13:44,456
you couldn't get
a permanent visa.

1042
01:13:44,665 --> 01:13:48,418
Catherine isn't going to support me.
Is there any other kind of visa?

1043
01:13:48,627 --> 01:13:50,379
What about the French quota?

1044
01:13:50,587 --> 01:13:54,007
- It's filled up for this year and next.
- What'll we do?

1045
01:13:54,216 --> 01:13:58,976
I was wondering if public law 271
would apply.

1046
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:02,279
That's the one regulating
immigration of war brides.

1047
01:14:02,488 --> 01:14:04,865
Catherine doesn't have to immigrate,
she's an American citizen.

1048
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,284
I was thinking of you
as the bride.

1049
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,163
That's a good imagination
you have there.

1050
01:14:11,372 --> 01:14:13,916
It says "spouses",
it doesn't mention sex.

1051
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,752
I'm convinced the American army
doesn't believe in it.

1052
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:20,339
This is going to work.
Yes, I think this will work.

1053
01:14:20,548 --> 01:14:22,258
Sure it will.
This is wonderful.

1054
01:14:22,466 --> 01:14:23,429
What?

1055
01:14:23,638 --> 01:14:27,610
Spouses means mates. It doesn't say
male or female. We're mates, right?

1056
01:14:27,819 --> 01:14:29,738
I really wouldn't know...

1057
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:33,158
You're a spouse of a member
of the American Expedition.

1058
01:14:33,366 --> 01:14:38,538
Therefore, you're eligible to travel
under section 271, as her bride.

1059
01:14:38,872 --> 01:14:39,998
As her bride?

1060
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:42,125
- Henri...
- Your bride?

1061
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:45,420
It'll be fun. I know
it's ridiculous, but it'll work.

1062
01:14:45,628 --> 01:14:47,172
It's the only way.

1063
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,307
Here's the application.

1064
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:53,817
I'm not going to travel as her bride.
Besides, her name's Rochard.

1065
01:14:54,026 --> 01:14:57,863
Excuse me, but officially,
it's still Gates.

1066
01:14:58,072 --> 01:15:02,534
No, officially, it is Rochard.
I have 3 certificates to prove it.

1067
01:15:02,743 --> 01:15:05,537
- Henri...
- I don't care. Rochard. Rochard.

1068
01:15:05,746 --> 01:15:07,998
Pay no attention.
What do we have to do?

1069
01:15:08,207 --> 01:15:12,503
Fill out your name, rank,
organisation, wife's maiden name...

1070
01:15:12,711 --> 01:15:15,686
- She hasn't got a wife.
- Just for the time being.

1071
01:15:15,895 --> 01:15:18,856
- Have you got a wife?
- No, but it's only a piece of paper.

1072
01:15:19,065 --> 01:15:23,319
Obviously, these applications
are intended for the husband.

1073
01:15:23,528 --> 01:15:25,071
I can write.

1074
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:27,573
We know, dear.
You can write.

1075
01:15:27,782 --> 01:15:31,411
No, this doesn't apply to you.
Just make the proper adjustments.

1076
01:15:31,619 --> 01:15:33,830
- What?
- On these papers.

1077
01:15:34,455 --> 01:15:37,625
You want to go, don't you?
Well, it's the only way.

1078
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:40,851
Hand them over to the Immigration
Officer when you've filled them out.

1079
01:15:42,102 --> 01:15:43,562
- Thank you.
- Catherine...

1080
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:45,272
It'll be simple, you'll see.

1081
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,568
On the contrary, turning a man into
a woman is enormously complicated.

1082
01:15:50,902 --> 01:15:53,613
But, I'll do my best.
Thank you, good day.

1083
01:15:53,822 --> 01:15:55,991
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1084
01:15:56,199 --> 01:15:57,993
Just a moment.
Brides first.

1085
01:15:58,201 --> 01:16:00,662
- I beg your pardon.
- That's all right.

1086
01:16:09,018 --> 01:16:10,311
Hello, Henri.

1087
01:16:10,895 --> 01:16:12,480
Well, nothing happened.

1088
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:15,775
- Hasn't it come yet?
- I wonder if it even arrived.

1089
01:16:15,983 --> 01:16:19,487
I handed it to the immigration
officer myself.

1090
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:22,198
Henri, brace yourself.
I'm leaving.

1091
01:16:22,406 --> 01:16:24,325
Our whole outfit leaves tonight.

1092
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:25,701
Tonight?

1093
01:16:26,786 --> 01:16:28,121
That does it. We're cooked.

1094
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:30,260
The application will come
this afternoon.

1095
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:35,016
It won't. You'll go and I'll
sit here, wondering which sex I am.

1096
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:39,729
A marriage of solitary confinement.
I've never been so lonely.

1097
01:16:39,938 --> 01:16:41,523
If I have to leave you,
I'll shoot myself.

1098
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:43,024
Shoot me too.

1099
01:16:43,233 --> 01:16:45,026
I think this is it.
It came to the office.

1100
01:16:45,235 --> 01:16:46,528
Thank you, Kitty.

1101
01:16:49,781 --> 01:16:51,032
At last...

1102
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:55,383
"Dear madam..."
That's me.

1103
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:58,720
"Following application
of your husband..." That's you.

1104
01:16:58,929 --> 01:17:02,641
"...permission to enter the US
as a war bride has been granted".

1105
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,977
I've got to go, see you later.

1106
01:17:05,185 --> 01:17:06,436
I'm so happy.
Kiss me.

1107
01:17:06,645 --> 01:17:09,648
We've time, that can wait.
Or maybe not.

1108
01:17:09,857 --> 01:17:12,526
No, Henri, the letter.

1109
01:17:13,152 --> 01:17:16,488
"Please fill in a test form
and bring to this office..."

1110
01:17:16,697 --> 01:17:20,087
Another form.
Will they ever run out?

1111
01:17:24,385 --> 01:17:27,096
I won't.
I won't answer those questions.

1112
01:17:27,597 --> 01:17:30,725
- This isn't so bad.
- I won't answer those questions!

1113
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:33,811
- You've got to. You don't want to stay, do you?
- No.

1114
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,938
- Then you've got to answer.
- How can I?

1115
01:17:36,147 --> 01:17:39,275
You can. Perhaps the man
at the office will help you.

1116
01:17:39,317 --> 01:17:40,151
Impossible.

1117
01:17:40,193 --> 01:17:44,498
Control yourself and be nice.
Everything will be all right.

1118
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:47,380
Read it on the way.
Goodbye and good luck.

1119
01:17:48,381 --> 01:17:51,593
- I tell you, there isn't another form.
- I told you first.

1120
01:17:51,802 --> 01:17:54,221
This form is for a woman.

1121
01:17:55,305 --> 01:17:58,141
On the other hand, if you don't
fill it out, you can't go.

1122
01:17:58,350 --> 01:17:59,559
That's right.

1123
01:17:59,768 --> 01:18:01,770
I've got to use this form.

1124
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:06,691
I felt the same way, but if it's
the only form, let's fill it out.

1125
01:18:08,027 --> 01:18:09,830
Well, let's see.

1126
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:12,002
Age and birth place,
we've got.

1127
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:16,590
Here's the first:
Are you an expectant mother?

1128
01:18:19,593 --> 01:18:20,678
Yes...

1129
01:18:21,929 --> 01:18:23,264
How many months?

1130
01:18:23,973 --> 01:18:25,224
20.

1131
01:18:25,933 --> 01:18:28,018
20? 20 months...

1132
01:18:29,228 --> 01:18:32,398
Any female trouble?

1133
01:18:33,234 --> 01:18:35,078
Nothing but, Sergeant.

1134
01:18:39,586 --> 01:18:41,713
Have you had children before?

1135
01:18:42,046 --> 01:18:45,300
My aching back... You know
that awful feeling before breakfast?

1136
01:18:45,508 --> 01:18:47,594
- No, I don't.
- You're lucky.

1137
01:18:47,802 --> 01:18:49,721
This doesn't make any sense.

1138
01:18:49,929 --> 01:18:54,642
I know, but we've got to fill it out.
Ask another, there are some good ones.

1139
01:18:59,237 --> 01:19:01,580
Attention, please.
Attention, please.

1140
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,708
Will Mrs Milton come to the desk,
please?

1141
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:11,256
Take seat 18
in bus number 3.

1142
01:19:15,177 --> 01:19:21,183
- Mrs. Rochard. Take seat 19 in bus number 3.
- Thank you.

1143
01:19:21,391 --> 01:19:24,193
Wait a minute.
You're not Mrs. Rochard.

1144
01:19:24,444 --> 01:19:25,450
I'm Mr. Rochard.

1145
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:28,538
It's your wife who must report
for transportation to Bremerhaven.

1146
01:19:28,746 --> 01:19:30,998
According to the War Department,
I am my wife.

1147
01:19:31,207 --> 01:19:32,959
You can't be your wife.

1148
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:36,587
If the American army says I can be,
who am I to dispute that?

1149
01:19:36,796 --> 01:19:38,214
This is all wrong.

1150
01:19:38,422 --> 01:19:41,300
Major, for your information,
I am a war bride.

1151
01:19:41,509 --> 01:19:43,261
A war bride?

1152
01:19:44,053 --> 01:19:45,304
I'm slightly confused.

1153
01:19:45,513 --> 01:19:48,519
I don't blame you,
but the official wording says:

1154
01:19:48,728 --> 01:19:52,784
"I am a alien spouse of female
personnel, en route to the US

1155
01:19:52,993 --> 01:19:55,495
under public law 271
of the Congress".

1156
01:19:55,704 --> 01:19:59,583
This is a strange situation,
but I suppose it's legal.

1157
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:02,043
- Yes, it is.
- Well, Mrs...

1158
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:07,340
Mr. Rochard, it won't be necessary
for you to stop at the nurse's desk.

1159
01:20:07,757 --> 01:20:08,884
No?

1160
01:20:15,771 --> 01:20:17,315
Attention, please.

1161
01:20:17,648 --> 01:20:21,986
All passengers must have their
baggage checked before boarding.

1162
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:26,991
All passengers must have their
baggage checked before boarding.

1163
01:20:27,366 --> 01:20:31,162
Mrs. Turner,
please come to the desk.

1164
01:20:31,787 --> 01:20:34,123
Mrs. Turner,
please come to the desk.

1165
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,564
He's crying, the baby.

1166
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,358
Is that what he's doing?

1167
01:20:46,733 --> 01:20:48,526
He wants water, yes?

1168
01:20:48,735 --> 01:20:52,280
I wouldn't know. When I want water,
I ask for it differently.

1169
01:20:52,489 --> 01:20:54,908
He's a baby.
You are a man.

1170
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:56,743
Thanks.

1171
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,871
I'll get him some water.
You hold the baby.

1172
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,122
I...

1173
01:21:01,331 --> 01:21:02,624
I'll only be a minute.

1174
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:04,720
I don't know anything...

1175
01:21:05,474 --> 01:21:06,976
Oh, my God.

1176
01:21:07,267 --> 01:21:08,602
Yes, yes...

1177
01:21:10,354 --> 01:21:12,064
Yes, yes...

1178
01:21:23,075 --> 01:21:24,535
Attention, please.

1179
01:21:24,994 --> 01:21:29,591
Ladies, please stop moving and
stay where you are till I finish.

1180
01:21:30,388 --> 01:21:34,976
This is the first leg of your journey
to the US as guests of the army.

1181
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:40,106
Arrangements have been made for
your comfort at the Dependents Hotel.

1182
01:21:40,481 --> 01:21:43,443
You'll be able to get all you need
at the PX there,

1183
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:48,823
such as lipstick, hairnets, garter
belts, foundation garments...

1184
01:21:49,991 --> 01:21:54,253
A lot of you have asked about
the latest styles in the US.

1185
01:21:54,547 --> 01:21:58,013
Hair is being worn shorter,
close to the head.

1186
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:03,602
Skirts are long and rather hippy,
the full blown look.

1187
01:22:04,144 --> 01:22:07,689
The trend is to the natural
bust line.

1188
01:22:08,482 --> 01:22:13,278
Between us, girls, looking around,
I don't think any of you need worry.

1189
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:17,074
Now, if you'll move out in order,
the buses are ready.

1190
01:22:17,282 --> 01:22:18,999
Happy journey, ladies.

1191
01:22:29,225 --> 01:22:30,935
He has to be here somewhere.

1192
01:22:32,186 --> 01:22:33,562
Look.

1193
01:22:37,942 --> 01:22:39,527
Henri, you look so maternal...

1194
01:22:39,735 --> 01:22:41,195
What is that?

1195
01:22:41,445 --> 01:22:43,913
A human fire extinguisher.
Want to try?

1196
01:22:44,123 --> 01:22:45,338
Come on...

1197
01:22:45,547 --> 01:22:48,133
- He's cute. What's his name?
- Niágara.

1198
01:22:48,341 --> 01:22:51,052
- Henri, what a thing to do.
- Where's the mother?

1199
01:22:51,261 --> 01:22:53,179
- She went to get more water.
- She ought to get a plumber.

1200
01:22:53,388 --> 01:22:54,556
You've got to get out.

1201
01:22:54,764 --> 01:22:57,851
How can we...?
There's the mother.

1202
01:22:58,059 --> 01:23:01,021
I'm sorry.
Oh, darling...

1203
01:23:01,229 --> 01:23:03,440
Mr. Rochard.

1204
01:23:03,773 --> 01:23:06,192
Your seat on the bus
has been changed.

1205
01:23:06,526 --> 01:23:08,281
You're sitting with the driver.

1206
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:10,293
I thought I could sit
with you.

1207
01:23:10,502 --> 01:23:14,298
You can't, Kitty and I are flying.
The whole outfit's going. Come on.

1208
01:23:14,506 --> 01:23:17,217
- No!
- I'll be there to meet you.

1209
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:19,428
Will we be together
in Bremenhaven?

1210
01:23:19,636 --> 01:23:20,888
I hope so. I'll try.

1211
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:23,265
If not, I won't sit
with the driver.

1212
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:24,625
Do you want me to carry that?

1213
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,152
No, thank you...

1214
01:23:46,603 --> 01:23:48,313
Darling, was it bad?

1215
01:23:48,563 --> 01:23:52,650
30 women. With the exception of you,
I may never talk with another.

1216
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:54,444
Poor Henri...

1217
01:23:54,819 --> 01:23:56,529
Let's get away.
Where do we go?

1218
01:23:56,738 --> 01:23:58,118
You don't, Henri.

1219
01:23:58,328 --> 01:24:00,756
I don't?
You couldn't fix it?

1220
01:24:00,964 --> 01:24:03,759
They wouldn't hear of it.
I'm in building 11 and you stay here.

1221
01:24:03,967 --> 01:24:05,177
Isn't there any chance?

1222
01:24:05,385 --> 01:24:07,095
I've argued for an hour.

1223
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:10,516
I'm learning what it is
to be a soldier's wife.

1224
01:24:10,724 --> 01:24:12,643
I know, dear.
I feel the same way.

1225
01:24:12,851 --> 01:24:16,438
Tomorrow on the boat, it'll be
different. I've got to go now.

1226
01:24:16,647 --> 01:24:18,065
Come on, Kitty.

1227
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:21,527
I'll meet you on the dock tomorrow.
Get a good night's sleep.

1228
01:24:21,777 --> 01:24:23,869
- That's all I'll be getting.
- Hello and goodbye.

1229
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:26,754
Hello and goodbye,
hello and goodbye...

1230
01:24:34,262 --> 01:24:38,516
...your name on the list,
you understand there'll be a wait,

1231
01:24:38,724 --> 01:24:40,393
because we've a lot of people
to attend to.

1232
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:44,397
Fill out the form and bring it back,
and I'll see what I can do.

1233
01:24:45,731 --> 01:24:47,902
I'm sorry, visiting hours
are over.

1234
01:24:48,113 --> 01:24:50,124
You can see your wife tomorrow.

1235
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:54,254
My wife will have to visit me,
I'm billeted here.

1236
01:24:54,462 --> 01:24:55,547
You are?

1237
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:57,090
But you can't...

1238
01:24:57,549 --> 01:25:00,552
Lieutenant.
There must be some mistake.

1239
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:04,389
No mistake. I'm an alien spouse
of female military personnel

1240
01:25:04,598 --> 01:25:08,518
en route to the US, under
public law 271 of the Congress.

1241
01:25:08,727 --> 01:25:12,230
- Good grief.
- The record shows 139 war brides,

1242
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:15,873
126 children of war brides,
9 dogs,

1243
01:25:16,081 --> 01:25:18,292
3 cats, 2 canaries,
one parrot...

1244
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,377
- Oh, yes. Here you are.
- Then, me.

1245
01:25:20,586 --> 01:25:23,923
You must've been added later.
"One war bride, male".

1246
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:27,134
- Is that you?
- That's me.

1247
01:25:27,343 --> 01:25:29,678
- There's a problem.
- Why?

1248
01:25:29,887 --> 01:25:31,430
You can't stay here.

1249
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:33,849
I have to, I'm billeted here.

1250
01:25:34,058 --> 01:25:37,604
If you insist. We already have
3 to 10 women in every room.

1251
01:25:37,813 --> 01:25:41,496
To say nothing of the dogs and cats.
I mean, you can't stay here.

1252
01:25:42,789 --> 01:25:44,457
I can't stay here.

1253
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:48,670
The place for you is the officers'
billet in the staging area.

1254
01:25:48,878 --> 01:25:50,255
It won't be half as interesting.

1255
01:25:50,463 --> 01:25:53,258
It's just down the street,
the third building on the left.

1256
01:25:53,466 --> 01:25:55,176
Thank you very much.

1257
01:25:55,718 --> 01:25:56,970
Thank you.

1258
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:17,421
- Hello.
- Hello.

1259
01:26:17,629 --> 01:26:19,840
I suppose you wonder
what I want here.

1260
01:26:20,591 --> 01:26:22,342
I will, if you want me to...

1261
01:26:24,344 --> 01:26:28,478
I'm an alien spouse of female
military personnel en route to the US,

1262
01:26:28,688 --> 01:26:33,659
under public law 271 of the Congress.
I'm a war bride.

1263
01:26:34,827 --> 01:26:37,079
No kidding?
That's interesting.

1264
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:41,959
Would it interest you enough
to give me a bed?

1265
01:26:42,168 --> 01:26:44,503
- You can't sleep here, Mack.
- Why not?

1266
01:26:44,712 --> 01:26:46,464
- Are you an American officer?
- No.

1267
01:26:46,672 --> 01:26:50,343
You can't sleep here.
Go to the Dependents Hotel.

1268
01:26:51,093 --> 01:26:53,560
I have just come from
the Dependents Hotel.

1269
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:57,364
The one in Bremerhaven? I mean
the one down at the staging area.

1270
01:26:57,572 --> 01:27:00,533
I'm too tired to walk
all that distance.

1271
01:27:00,867 --> 01:27:03,286
Suit yourself, Mack,
but you can't sleep here.

1272
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:08,416
There must be a bed that's free.
You must have one, where is it?

1273
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:11,795
Across the street.
My wife's in it.

1274
01:27:12,212 --> 01:27:13,213
And you can't...

1275
01:27:13,421 --> 01:27:16,091
Of course not. Quite right.
Naturally.

1276
01:27:17,761 --> 01:27:19,143
Well...

1277
01:27:21,944 --> 01:27:23,320
Oh, brother.

1278
01:27:26,573 --> 01:27:28,075
Down this way.

1279
01:27:28,367 --> 01:27:30,077
This is awfully kind of you,
sergeant.

1280
01:27:30,285 --> 01:27:33,580
I'm a private, but you've
got to sleep somewhere.

1281
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:36,041
You won't get in trouble,
will you?

1282
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:40,254
What can they do? Bust me to civilian?
It ain't the Ritz, but it should do.

1283
01:27:40,462 --> 01:27:41,672
It's fine.

1284
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:46,733
I'm grateful to find a friend
like you. Where do you live?

1285
01:27:46,941 --> 01:27:49,152
- Brooklyn.
- I'll look you up when I get there.

1286
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,987
Get a good sleep.

1287
01:28:07,546 --> 01:28:09,641
- No, thank you.
- Wake up.

1288
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:11,480
No, thank you.

1289
01:28:11,688 --> 01:28:13,357
What are you doing here?

1290
01:28:14,441 --> 01:28:16,193
I had a feeling.

1291
01:28:19,571 --> 01:28:23,825
I'm an alien spouse of female
military personnel en route to the US,

1292
01:28:24,034 --> 01:28:26,328
under public law 271
of the Congress.

1293
01:28:26,536 --> 01:28:29,247
Why aren't you at
the Dependents Hotel?

1294
01:28:29,456 --> 01:28:34,010
I am writing a book about that.
You see, I'm not a woman.

1295
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:38,896
That's too bad. But I tell you
one thing: you can't sleep here.

1296
01:28:39,772 --> 01:28:44,902
Note I have not taken off my clothes
in anticipation. Where will I go?

1297
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:46,612
I don't know, but you...

1298
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:49,699
...can't sleep here.
We're agreed.

1299
01:28:49,907 --> 01:28:51,075
Where will I go?

1300
01:28:51,283 --> 01:28:55,788
The only place left is a German
hotel, but you're a dependent.

1301
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,141
You come under military law
and German hotels are out of bounds.

1302
01:29:01,558 --> 01:29:02,600
Where will I go?

1303
01:29:02,809 --> 01:29:06,980
I don't know. I'm sorry,
but there's an army rule and you...

1304
01:29:07,188 --> 01:29:09,315
...can't sleep here.

1305
01:29:13,445 --> 01:29:14,738
I beg your pardon.

1306
01:29:17,407 --> 01:29:18,950
Where will you go?

1307
01:29:19,367 --> 01:29:20,744
I don't know.

1308
01:29:21,661 --> 01:29:26,346
It's a shame. If we was in Brooklyn,
you could've slept with the old man.

1309
01:29:47,577 --> 01:29:48,792
Hiya.

1310
01:29:50,217 --> 01:29:51,427
Oh, hi.

1311
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:55,932
What can I do for you?

1312
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,268
I'm looking for a place to sleep.
Can you help me?

1313
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:02,063
Afraid not. Nothing but women
sleeping in there.

1314
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,565
I know, building 11.
My wife's in there.

1315
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:07,193
A lot of people's wives
are in there.

1316
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:11,614
Have you ever noticed women always
get a place to sleep. Why is that?

1317
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,376
I suppose it's because
they're the weaker sex.

1318
01:30:14,585 --> 01:30:18,051
I believe they're stronger.
Do you know why?

1319
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:20,387
Because they get enough sleep.

1320
01:30:21,054 --> 01:30:23,140
I'm sorry I can't help you.

1321
01:30:24,558 --> 01:30:26,351
Very kind of you, Corporal.

1322
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,979
Good night.
Are you from Brooklyn?

1323
01:30:29,187 --> 01:30:30,564
Yonkers.

1324
01:30:31,732 --> 01:30:33,191
What are those?

1325
01:30:35,819 --> 01:30:37,279
Good night, buddy.

1326
01:30:48,012 --> 01:30:51,891
I'm am an alien spouse of female
military personnel en route to the US,

1327
01:30:52,099 --> 01:30:56,228
under public law 271. I've been all
over looking for a place to sleep.

1328
01:30:56,437 --> 01:30:57,813
You poor man.

1329
01:30:58,022 --> 01:31:00,608
You can't stay here.
This is a female building.

1330
01:31:00,816 --> 01:31:02,109
It is?

1331
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:05,292
Another women's building.

1332
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,797
I've come to the conclusion
that American men don't sleep.

1333
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,132
Well, not in this building.

1334
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:14,636
Would there be any objection
to me sitting here for a while?

1335
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:17,847
Imagine I'm waiting
for something.

1336
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,559
It depends on what you imagine
you're waiting for.

1337
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:24,562
I don't want to send you out
on a night like this.

1338
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:26,606
Very kind. That's nice.

1339
01:31:27,776 --> 01:31:31,041
Tell me, what part of the US
do you come from?

1340
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,960
Boston, Massachusetts.

1341
01:31:33,168 --> 01:31:34,586
Massachuchu...

1342
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:38,298
Is there a place called Yonkers?

1343
01:31:38,549 --> 01:31:40,259
Sure, it's in New York.

1344
01:31:40,467 --> 01:31:41,802
I was wondering...

1345
01:31:42,553 --> 01:31:45,806
I'm a little mixed up.
May I hold that for you?

1346
01:31:46,014 --> 01:31:47,266
Thanks.

1347
01:31:48,725 --> 01:31:50,394
I just got married.

1348
01:31:50,602 --> 01:31:51,854
Where's your wife?

1349
01:31:52,062 --> 01:31:55,162
She's in a female building,
building 11.

1350
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:56,873
And you couldn't find
a bed anywhere?

1351
01:31:57,123 --> 01:31:59,959
No. Well, almost.

1352
01:32:00,168 --> 01:32:02,545
There was one in Brooklyn,
and another with a woman in it.

1353
01:32:02,753 --> 01:32:04,922
He was a very disagreeable man.

1354
01:32:05,131 --> 01:32:06,215
Who was?

1355
01:32:06,424 --> 01:32:09,802
Her husband. It would've been
nicer in Brooklyn.

1356
01:32:10,052 --> 01:32:12,930
- With the husband?
- No, the old man.

1357
01:32:14,223 --> 01:32:15,600
You are tired, aren't you?

1358
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:27,542
There he is.
See you on the boat.

1359
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:28,794
Okay.

1360
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:30,712
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

1361
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:32,380
Pardon me.

1362
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:40,096
I was afraid you'd missed the bus.
Could you take these bags, please?

1363
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:42,432
Thank you.

1364
01:32:42,768 --> 01:32:45,030
Henri, you look awful.
What have you been doing?

1365
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,577
Sitting up all night
with a redhead, knitting.

1366
01:32:48,786 --> 01:32:51,705
You ought to see me pearl.
You want to see her pearl.

1367
01:32:51,914 --> 01:32:53,499
What are you talking about?

1368
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:58,212
Attention all passengers.
Get on board as soon as possible.

1369
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:00,256
I'd like to show you
how to do that.

1370
01:33:00,464 --> 01:33:03,008
We've got to go.
Have you got your papers?

1371
01:33:03,259 --> 01:33:04,218
Right here.

1372
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:08,645
We just have to get aboard.
Remember, no back talk, no argument.

1373
01:33:08,855 --> 01:33:09,943
Keep your temper. Promise?

1374
01:33:10,153 --> 01:33:11,447
I promise.

1375
01:33:11,656 --> 01:33:12,907
Come on.

1376
01:33:14,742 --> 01:33:16,411
Here's your boarding card.

1377
01:33:17,287 --> 01:33:19,539
Your orders, Lieutenant?
Thank you.

1378
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:22,625
- Lieutenant Gates.
- Right.

1379
01:33:23,918 --> 01:33:26,546
- Your boarding card.
- Thank you.

1380
01:33:26,796 --> 01:33:28,882
- What do you want?
- To go aboard.

1381
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:32,135
Sorry, this ship is for war brides
and a few military personnel...

1382
01:33:32,343 --> 01:33:35,150
I know. Here are my orders.

1383
01:33:36,737 --> 01:33:40,741
- Have you a Rochard on your list?
- Yes, Mrs. Henri Rochard.

1384
01:33:40,866 --> 01:33:41,825
That's me.

1385
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,869
- You're not a woman.
- We want your wife.

1386
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:46,538
You can't have her.
I'm particular about that.

1387
01:33:46,747 --> 01:33:47,956
Henri...

1388
01:33:48,332 --> 01:33:49,875
Yes, Catherine.
I'll remember.

1389
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:53,754
There's been a misunderstanding.
My name is Henri Rochard.

1390
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:56,340
Have you ever heard of a woman
called Henri?

1391
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:59,267
I'm trying to think... You know
a lot of dames, Sam.

1392
01:33:59,477 --> 01:34:02,068
- I know a Billie...
- Maybe he's right.

1393
01:34:02,276 --> 01:34:06,280
I am a war bride.
This is my wife.

1394
01:34:06,531 --> 01:34:08,866
It's a natural mistake,
you're not the first to make it.

1395
01:34:09,075 --> 01:34:11,702
If my papers are in order,
may I go aboard?

1396
01:34:11,911 --> 01:34:13,871
We'll have to let him on.

1397
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:15,998
Your boarding card.

1398
01:34:16,207 --> 01:34:17,333
Thank you, good day.

1399
01:34:17,542 --> 01:34:18,960
Good day.

1400
01:34:19,502 --> 01:34:23,175
You were wonderful. I knew if you
kept your temper it'd be all right.

1401
01:34:23,385 --> 01:34:24,725
I thought I behaved quite well.

1402
01:34:24,935 --> 01:34:26,481
You did.

1403
01:34:29,234 --> 01:34:30,193
Room B14, Lieutenant.

1404
01:34:30,402 --> 01:34:31,736
Thank you.

1405
01:34:34,906 --> 01:34:38,034
How did you get here? This is for
war brides and military personnel.

1406
01:34:38,243 --> 01:34:40,745
I know.
My name is Rochard.

1407
01:34:40,954 --> 01:34:43,123
You'll think I'm a bride,
but actually I'm a husband.

1408
01:34:43,331 --> 01:34:47,168
There'll be some confusion, but
if we keep our heads, it'll be fine.

1409
01:34:47,377 --> 01:34:51,437
I don't think it will.
I've got a Mrs. Rochad on my list.

1410
01:34:51,645 --> 01:34:52,855
Rochard.

1411
01:34:53,063 --> 01:34:55,566
She's in A88, with two brides
and three children.

1412
01:34:55,774 --> 01:34:57,484
That will have to be altered.

1413
01:34:57,693 --> 01:34:59,278
Not by me.

1414
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:03,699
I've just explained to the army,
they understood and passed you.

1415
01:35:03,908 --> 01:35:07,786
The army passed you. That's fine,
that's just dandy.

1416
01:35:07,995 --> 01:35:10,998
Did you hear? The army
understood and passed him.

1417
01:35:11,248 --> 01:35:12,961
This is the Navy, bud.

1418
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:16,226
I have had weeks
of the US army

1419
01:35:16,434 --> 01:35:19,812
and am quite prepared
to take on the US navy.

1420
01:35:20,188 --> 01:35:24,025
And the Navy is quite prepared
to take you on.

1421
01:35:24,484 --> 01:35:26,110
- Get this guy off.
- Get going.

1422
01:35:26,319 --> 01:35:28,655
Just a minute. Have you eve heard
of a women called Henri?

1423
01:35:28,863 --> 01:35:31,783
Yeah, Henrietta, from San Francisco.
Take him.

1424
01:35:31,991 --> 01:35:34,744
Never mind, never mind.

1425
01:35:36,663 --> 01:35:38,293
Just go on about your business.

1426
01:35:45,852 --> 01:35:47,980
You shouldn't have lost your temper.
Where are you going?

1427
01:35:48,188 --> 01:35:52,150
To change back into a man.
I'm tired of being my own wife.

1428
01:35:52,359 --> 01:35:54,236
Wait, you can't give up now.

1429
01:35:54,444 --> 01:35:56,738
Make them give up
Someone has to.

1430
01:35:56,947 --> 01:35:59,825
Once on board, everything will be
over and you'll be a man forever.

1431
01:36:00,033 --> 01:36:01,451
It's worth a try, isn't it?

1432
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,249
- How can we?
- I don't know...

1433
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:06,512
Would you take this bag?
I left something on the bus.

1434
01:36:06,721 --> 01:36:09,432
- I'll have someone put it in the mess hall.
- Thanks.

1435
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:12,059
- What were you saying?
- Do you love me?

1436
01:36:12,268 --> 01:36:15,021
- Of course.
- You'll make one more try to get aboard?

1437
01:36:15,229 --> 01:36:16,689
- If you say so...
- Promise?

1438
01:36:16,897 --> 01:36:18,107
- Promise.
- You'll keep it?

1439
01:36:18,316 --> 01:36:20,526
- I promised, didn't I?
- Come on.

1440
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:23,613
Here, hold these.

1441
01:36:24,113 --> 01:36:25,531
Whoa boy.

1442
01:36:26,073 --> 01:36:29,168
No, that won't do.
Here's a better one.

1443
01:36:30,299 --> 01:36:31,885
Whoa, boy.

1444
01:36:32,427 --> 01:36:34,554
- What are you doing?
- Come on, lean down.

1445
01:36:34,763 --> 01:36:36,890
Lean down.
I want to see something.

1446
01:36:37,098 --> 01:36:38,683
- That goes perfectly.
- With what?

1447
01:36:38,892 --> 01:36:41,811
- Give me your knife.
- You're not going to...? I won't do it.

1448
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:45,815
It'll make a perfect wig.
And we've got the clothes.

1449
01:36:46,024 --> 01:36:47,192
I will not do it.

1450
01:36:47,317 --> 01:36:49,444
- You said you loved me.
- I'm not so sure.

1451
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:51,780
You promised.
Give me your knife.

1452
01:36:53,202 --> 01:36:55,380
Come on,
there's not much time.

1453
01:36:58,717 --> 01:37:00,552
This is ridiculous.

1454
01:37:01,762 --> 01:37:04,348
Can't you at least
cut it off the mane?

1455
01:37:04,556 --> 01:37:09,019
You're taking this too personally.
Stand so no one can see.

1456
01:37:26,884 --> 01:37:28,303
It's a little thick.

1457
01:37:31,264 --> 01:37:35,184
It won't be so bad when I get
your bangs rolled. Want to see?

1458
01:37:38,396 --> 01:37:39,731
Horrible.

1459
01:37:40,231 --> 01:37:42,609
I don't think I'll have to
defend my honour.

1460
01:37:42,819 --> 01:37:45,165
- I doubt it.
- A pity.

1461
01:37:45,499 --> 01:37:47,169
I wonder if some lipstick
would help.

1462
01:37:47,377 --> 01:37:49,629
- No.
- Why not?

1463
01:37:49,838 --> 01:37:54,593
I'm the outdoor type.
Seabiscuit, bangtail, you know.

1464
01:37:55,385 --> 01:37:57,429
Silly. Hold still.
Let me roll these.

1465
01:38:07,858 --> 01:38:10,623
Wait, I forgot something.
Can you talk like a woman?

1466
01:38:10,706 --> 01:38:11,791
Like this?

1467
01:38:11,874 --> 01:38:14,043
- Awful. Can't you do any better?
- No.

1468
01:38:14,251 --> 01:38:17,004
All right, then not a word,
leave everything to me.

1469
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:18,923
And keep your head down.

1470
01:38:23,344 --> 01:38:27,348
Would you put this in the mess hall
for me, please. Thank you.

1471
01:38:28,933 --> 01:38:30,643
Wait a moment.

1472
01:38:33,233 --> 01:38:35,704
Did you hear that?
I must look pretty good.

1473
01:38:35,912 --> 01:38:38,581
Don't be silly,
that was for me.

1474
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:39,874
I ought to punch him in the nose.

1475
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:42,043
Remember, you're a lady.

1476
01:38:42,293 --> 01:38:43,461
Oh, yeah...

1477
01:38:48,842 --> 01:38:50,885
We have our boarding cards.
We've been up before.

1478
01:38:51,094 --> 01:38:52,303
Go ahead.

1479
01:38:56,266 --> 01:39:00,784
- I don't remember the tall one.
- It's hard to forget a face like that.

1480
01:39:00,993 --> 01:39:01,994
Yeah.

1481
01:39:04,163 --> 01:39:06,290
Lieutenant Gates, B14.
I was up before.

1482
01:39:06,498 --> 01:39:08,542
Yes.
Your orders, please.

1483
01:39:10,836 --> 01:39:13,547
This is funny.
Rochard...

1484
01:39:13,964 --> 01:39:15,799
Why aren't you listed
among military personnel?

1485
01:39:16,008 --> 01:39:19,887
Save your voice, dear. Excuse her,
she has laryngitis. What was that?

1486
01:39:20,095 --> 01:39:21,930
Why isn't she listed
among the military personnel?

1487
01:39:22,139 --> 01:39:23,479
She was just married.

1488
01:39:23,687 --> 01:39:27,241
That may be, but...
Red, come here.

1489
01:39:29,202 --> 01:39:32,288
- What's the trouble?
- This lieutenant's listed as a Mrs.

1490
01:39:34,082 --> 01:39:35,750
Why did they put you down as...?

1491
01:39:37,251 --> 01:39:38,669
How do you do?

1492
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:42,340
Why did they put you down as Mrs
instead of lieutenant?

1493
01:39:42,548 --> 01:39:47,261
She has laryngitis, she can't talk.
Maybe it was because of her husband.

1494
01:39:47,513 --> 01:39:49,983
- Who did she marry?
- Admiral Rochard.

1495
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:52,447
- Who?
- Admiral Rochard.

1496
01:39:52,656 --> 01:39:55,200
The name's familiar,
but I don't remember an admiral.

1497
01:39:55,409 --> 01:39:57,702
You never heard of her husband?
He won't like that.

1498
01:39:57,911 --> 01:39:59,830
Florence, if I were you,
I wouldn't say a word.

1499
01:40:00,038 --> 01:40:04,626
- You heard him, Red, Admiral Rochard.
- Yeah, maybe I have.

1500
01:40:04,876 --> 01:40:07,045
- All right.
- Room A88, Lieutenant.

1501
01:40:07,254 --> 01:40:08,380
Get your instructions
in the mess hall.

1502
01:40:08,588 --> 01:40:10,549
Thanks.
Come, Florence.

1503
01:40:16,193 --> 01:40:18,821
First time I ever felt sorry
for an admiral.

1504
01:40:19,238 --> 01:40:20,948
Cams aren't bad.

1505
01:40:21,282 --> 01:40:23,701
Now, I'm beginning
to feel sorry for you.

1506
01:40:28,664 --> 01:40:30,249
- In here, please.
- We were...

1507
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:32,293
Please, your instructions first.

1508
01:40:32,501 --> 01:40:33,919
Come on, Florence.

1509
01:40:36,088 --> 01:40:37,381
I don't like that name.

1510
01:40:37,591 --> 01:40:38,889
Shut up.

1511
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:44,903
- Kitty...
- No...

1512
01:40:45,111 --> 01:40:47,322
Stand on the other side
so they can't see.

1513
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:50,325
They wouldn't let him on...
Henri, duck down.

1514
01:40:50,533 --> 01:40:52,994
- I can hear.
- You're too tall. Duck down.

1515
01:40:53,203 --> 01:40:54,287
He looks awful.

1516
01:40:54,412 --> 01:40:58,166
I didn't have much to work with.
Have you got a room?

1517
01:40:58,374 --> 01:41:00,251
Yes, but they wouldn't
let a thing like that in.

1518
01:41:00,418 --> 01:41:02,923
We've got to hide him somewhere
till the boat sails.

1519
01:41:03,551 --> 01:41:05,938
We better not stand here.

1520
01:41:06,563 --> 01:41:07,815
Someone's spotted him.

1521
01:41:08,023 --> 01:41:11,652
We need a nurse. It's an emergency.
Will you come with me?

1522
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:14,321
I'm a nurse.

1523
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,697
Come along.

1524
01:41:15,906 --> 01:41:17,616
I hadn't counted on this.

1525
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:33,187
- Very lucky to find a nurse.
- What's the matter?

1526
01:41:33,396 --> 01:41:34,939
My wife's expecting a baby.

1527
01:41:35,148 --> 01:41:36,983
What? Oh, no...

1528
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:39,485
It isn't very convenient, is it?

1529
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:41,320
You can say that again.

1530
01:41:41,904 --> 01:41:43,573
It isn't very convenient, is it?

1531
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:45,366
No, no it isn't.

1532
01:41:46,284 --> 01:41:48,035
I wonder if it'll be a girl.

1533
01:41:48,244 --> 01:41:49,787
I'll be grateful
if it's a baby.

1534
01:41:49,996 --> 01:41:52,415
You will?
You're very kind.

1535
01:41:54,468 --> 01:41:56,683
I wish I knew what was going on.

1536
01:41:56,892 --> 01:41:57,976
You won't have long to wait.

1537
01:41:58,185 --> 01:41:59,436
I won't?

1538
01:42:00,353 --> 01:42:03,857
Gee whiz, I don't think
I can stand this.

1539
01:42:04,065 --> 01:42:05,108
You've got a bigger shock coming.

1540
01:42:05,317 --> 01:42:06,735
I have?

1541
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,905
She got dizzy.

1542
01:42:10,113 --> 01:42:13,408
Thank you, I'll take care of her.
I'll get you some water.

1543
01:42:13,617 --> 01:42:15,869
- Pardon me.
- This is the father.

1544
01:42:16,077 --> 01:42:17,245
How do you do.

1545
01:42:18,166 --> 01:42:20,763
Is it a boy, or a girl?

1546
01:42:25,476 --> 01:42:27,394
What happened to him...?

1547
01:42:28,312 --> 01:42:30,439
Well, if it isn't Florence...

1548
01:42:33,734 --> 01:42:35,319
Arrest that man.

1549
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:38,447
It's all right, Henri.
The ship has sailed.

1550
01:42:40,324 --> 01:42:41,867
Come on, Flo.

1551
01:43:01,526 --> 01:43:02,777
Florence...

1552
01:43:20,517 --> 01:43:21,810
May we come in?

1553
01:43:22,019 --> 01:43:25,105
I don't see how I can stop you,
the key's on the outside.

1554
01:43:27,941 --> 01:43:31,570
Henri, this is Lieutenant Perkins
and Commander Willis, the chaplain.

1555
01:43:31,778 --> 01:43:33,158
Chaplain? Oh, no...

1556
01:43:33,367 --> 01:43:36,589
- No, nothing doing. I'm sorry, chaplain.
- Nothing doing what?

1557
01:43:36,797 --> 01:43:40,176
No more marriages.
I won't marry her again.

1558
01:43:40,843 --> 01:43:44,847
That won't be necessary, Mr. Rochard.
Everything's straightened out.

1559
01:43:45,056 --> 01:43:48,142
Sorry about the mix up,
but your case was unusual.

1560
01:43:48,351 --> 01:43:52,104
You're an alien spouse of female
personnel en route to the US,

1561
01:43:52,313 --> 01:43:56,150
under public law 271 of the Congress.
- Am I now?

1562
01:43:56,359 --> 01:44:00,501
Under the circumstances, the Captain
would like to forget the whole thing.

1563
01:44:00,752 --> 01:44:03,588
- Don't you understand? You're free to go.
- Where?

1564
01:44:03,797 --> 01:44:06,007
- Anywhere on the ship.
- You're bunked in with an officer.

1565
01:44:06,216 --> 01:44:07,634
He doesn't mind.

1566
01:44:07,842 --> 01:44:12,514
I think he would mind. He won't
like that. I snore terribly.

1567
01:44:12,764 --> 01:44:14,140
You don't snore.

1568
01:44:14,349 --> 01:44:15,851
How would you know?

1569
01:44:16,059 --> 01:44:20,188
Couldn't we do something simple?
Couldn't I just stay here?

1570
01:44:20,814 --> 01:44:23,279
- I suppose...
- I don't see why not.

1571
01:44:23,487 --> 01:44:25,623
Thank you, that's very nice.
You've been a great help.

1572
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,042
Good night.

1573
01:44:27,251 --> 01:44:28,711
Thank you very much.

1574
01:44:45,227 --> 01:44:46,478
You wouldn't.

1575
01:44:46,687 --> 01:44:47,899
Yes, I would.

1576
01:44:48,736 --> 01:44:50,286
I believe you would.

1577
01:44:54,834 --> 01:44:57,378
How will we ever get out of here?

1578
01:44:58,004 --> 01:45:02,300
I'm not gonna worry about that until
the Statue of Liberty goes by that porthole.

1579
01:45:03,305 --> 01:46:03,860
