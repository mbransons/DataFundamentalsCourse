1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:03,469
Neighbors, may I have your attention?

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:06,077
All you folks that have come
from far and wide...

3
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:09,478
Henry here wants me to thank you
for coming to help him raise his barn.

4
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:10,777
Thanks, folks.

5
00:00:10,883 --> 00:00:13,784
And he thanks the ladies
for all the fancy victuals.

6
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:19,416
Since the barn's got four sides,
there's going to be four teams.

7
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:22,484
The team that gets their side up first
wins the little heifer.

8
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:24,291
Henry, show them Annabel.

9
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:31,831
Now, get your teams set up, neighbors,
and lets see who wins the little lady.

10
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:34,733
Adam, we could use her on the farm.

11
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,641
How about it, boys?

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,405
Mr. Perkins, put the seven of us brothers
down for one team.

13
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:44,348
Milly says she's taken a fancy to Annabel.

14
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,578
You hear, boys? That was Adam Pontipee.

15
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:50,281
Last time he came to town, he bragged
how he always got what he set out for.

16
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:51,482
And danged if he didn't.

17
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:53,388
He's a hard one to beat, I'm warning you.

18
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:55,154
- Don't worry.
- We'll handle them.

19
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:56,490
That's the spirit.

20
00:00:56,562 --> 00:00:58,393
We got a team all set up here, Pete.

21
00:00:58,464 --> 00:00:59,795
And here's your fourth, Pete.

22
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:02,357
- That's fine. Got your hammers and all?
- Yeah!

23
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:03,595
Then take your positions.

24
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:07,127
The sooner you raise the barn,
the sooner you get the victuals.

25
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:15,110
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

26
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:16,908
Let's go!

27
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:29,454
Come on, Adam.

28
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:31,053
Come on, Frank.

29
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:52,114
My fault. Sorry,
I shouldn't have had my hand there.

30
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,243
What happened?

31
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,445
Nothing.

32
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:00,816
Caleb, get that board up there.

33
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:04,056
Now what happened?

34
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,627
I stubbed my big toe.

35
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:07,961
Come on, let's get going.

36
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:10,468
Hey, Frank, get those sideboards up here.

37
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:14,973
Hurt yourself, Frankincense?

38
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:22,070
Well, come on, let's go!

39
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:23,775
What's wrong with you boys today?

40
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,545
Just a little dizzy spell.

41
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:33,389
Hold it! Take it easy!

42
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,324
He didn't drop that hammer. He threw it!

43
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,328
- We don't want no fight!
- We promised Milly.

44
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:39,626
We're gonna keep it calm,
so don't start anything.

45
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,098
Come on, we're way behind now.

46
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,328
She's made you
into a bunch of momma's boys.

47
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,427
They're out to murder you,
and what do you do?

48
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:48,871
Apologize for living! You're a disgrace
to the Pontipee name!

49
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:52,667
You're a bunch of lily-livered,
chicken-hearted, lick-spittles.

50
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:57,941
Serves you right!
I hope they break your necks!

51
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,425
All right, Gideon, let's go!

52
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:13,991
Why're you doing that?

53
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,658
He ain't done nothing!

54
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:20,657
Boys! Stop the fight!

55
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,000
Witch hazel.

56
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,070
Split lip.

57
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:43,843
Don't smile for a few days.

58
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:44,974
Next.

59
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:48,678
Two beefsteaks. Frank?

60
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,489
A kick in the pants.

61
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,815
Next?

62
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,523
A loose tooth and swolled-up knuckles.

63
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:59,262
A wonder you have any teeth left at all.
Witch hazel, please.

64
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:00,590
I'm sorry, Milly, honest.

65
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,362
But when that fella took after Adam,
an innocent bylooker...

66
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:04,926
I understand, Gideon.

67
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:07,028
You all did your best, I guess.

68
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:09,838
Good night, boys.

69
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,677
Good night, Milly.

70
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,144
- Good night, Milly.
- Good night, Milly.

71
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,782
I feel awful strange-like, Milly. Here.

72
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:29,960
If it's what I think ails you, Gideon,
witch hazel's not going to help.

73
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,931
Alice is sweet, isn't she?

74
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,263
Good night.

75
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:57,919
What's the matter with you?
Somebody butt you in the breadbasket?

76
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,314
No.

77
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:02,456
I felt this way even afore the fight.

78
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:04,495
Ever since I seen Alice.

79
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:07,725
Adam?

80
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,159
Yeah?

81
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,365
Do you reckon I could be in love?

82
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:18,870
Well, Pa used to say, love's kind of like
the measles. You only get it once.

83
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:21,610
The older you are, the tougher it goes.

84
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:25,048
Young fella like you
ought to get it kind of light.

85
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,286
No, I guess not.

86
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,034
I don't know as I can answer
your question, Gideon.

87
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:47,866
But according to Milly, and she's had
a heap of book-learning:

88
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,533
<i>When you're in love</i>

89
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:55,236
<i>When you're in love</i>

90
00:07:56,982 --> 00:08:01,976
<i>There is no way on earth to hide it</i>

91
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,881
<i>When you're in love</i>

92
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,752
<i>Really in love</i>

93
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:17,225
<i>You simply let your heart decide it</i>

94
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,831
<i>How can you tell</i>

95
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:27,575
<i>What's in its spell</i>

96
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:33,441
<i>How can you tell until you've tried it</i>

97
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:40,848
<i>Wait for that kiss you're certain of</i>

98
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:50,368
<i>And let your heart decide</i>

99
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:55,730
<i>When you're in love!</i>

100
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,976
I guess I got the beginnings.

101
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:12,786
But them townspeople will never
let us court them gals now.

102
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,119
Not after today.

103
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:16,786
Don't let it fret you.

104
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:19,897
If you don't get this one,
there'll be another to come along.

105
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:22,263
One woman's pretty much like the next.

106
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,626
Come on, let's go feed the stock.

107
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:26,588
<i>I'm a lonesome polecat</i>

108
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:35,262
<i>Lonesome, sad, and blue</i>

109
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:43,038
<i>'Cause I ain't got no</i>

110
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:47,211
<i>Feminine polecat</i>

111
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:53,151
<i>Vowing to be true</i>

112
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,269
<i>Can't make no vows</i>

113
00:11:07,673 --> 00:11:11,234
<i>To a herd of cows</i>

114
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:23,811
<i>I'm a mean old hound dog</i>

115
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:33,220
<i>Baying at the moon</i>

116
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:39,734
<i>'Cause I ain't got no</i>

117
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,270
<i>Lady friend hound dog</i>

118
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:50,141
<i>Here to hear my tune</i>

119
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:04,126
<i>A man can't sleep</i>

120
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:08,190
<i>When he sleeps with sheep</i>

121
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:21,001
<i>I'm a little old hoot owl</i>

122
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,249
<i>Hooting in the trees</i>

123
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:37,159
<i>'Cause I ain't got no</i>

124
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:41,595
<i>Little gal owl fowl</i>

125
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:47,566
<i>Here to shoot the breeze</i>

126
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,150
<i>Can't shoot no breeze</i>

127
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:05,748
<i>With a bunch of trees</i>

128
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,396
It is beautiful, isn't it?

129
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:51,628
Not to me.

130
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,966
I've seen too much of it.

131
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:56,238
I'm getting out.

132
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:57,772
Why, Benjamin!

133
00:13:57,843 --> 00:14:01,540
I'm not gonna spend another winter here,
snowed in for three, four months.

134
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:05,014
What would we do without you?
We'd miss you so.

135
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:08,581
There's plenty here
to take care of the farm without me.

136
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,123
- Adam.
- Yeah?

137
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:27,064
- Benjamin says he's leaving.
- What?

138
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:29,536
He says it's the winter,
but I know it's not that.

139
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:32,600
He's grieving for his girl.
They're all grieving for their girls.

140
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:35,841
Why grieve for them?
They hardly saw them more than once.

141
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:39,444
Once is all it takes if it's the right one.

142
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:42,619
I had such dreams
about all of them living around...

143
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:44,779
dozens of babies and children...

144
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:47,985
visiting back and forth
at Christmas time and birthdays.

145
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,028
If Benjamin goes, then another will go...

146
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,289
and another.

147
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:55,830
I'll talk to him.

148
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:16,180
If you could just get a look at yourselves.

149
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:19,854
You look like a bunch of lovesick
bull calves.

150
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:27,225
If you're so sweet on those girls,
do something about it.

151
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:28,829
Why don't you go marry them?

152
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,664
Sure, just go marry them, as easy as that.

153
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:34,931
They'd never let us marry them,
not in a thousand years.

154
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:37,474
Then do like the Romans did
with the "sobbing women"...

155
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:40,238
or, "Sabine women"
or whatever they called them.

156
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:42,870
Those Romans were in the same fix
you're in.

157
00:15:42,948 --> 00:15:46,679
They was opening up new territory,
women were scarce, just like here.

158
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,455
And there were these "sobbing women"
in town, so what did the Romans do?

159
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,486
They went down there
and they carried them off.

160
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:59,429
Now, if you can't do as good as a bunch
of old Romans, you're no brothers of mine.

161
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:03,028
'Course, this being Oregon
and God-fearing territory...

162
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:05,530
you'd have to capture
a parson along with them.

163
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:06,866
Hey, them Romans...

164
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:08,735
they the ones settled up north of here?

165
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:12,573
No, this was in olden days.
I read about it here in Milly's book.

166
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:13,970
Oh, a book.

167
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:17,138
Why, this is history! This really happened.

168
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:21,718
<i>Tell you about them sobbing women</i>
<i>Who lived in the Roman days</i>

169
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,884
<i>It seems that they all went swimming</i>
<i>While their men was off to graze</i>

170
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:31,961
<i>Well, a Roman troop was riding by</i>
<i>And saw them in their me-oh-my</i>

171
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,490
<i>So they took them all back home to dry</i>
<i>Least, that's what Plutarch says</i>

172
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:41,538
<i>Oh, yes, them a-women was sobbing</i>
<i>Sobbing, sobbing fit to be tied</i>

173
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:46,634
<i>Every muscle was throbbing, throbbing</i>
<i>From that riotous ride</i>

174
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:50,047
<i>Seems they cried and kissed</i>
<i>And kissed and cried</i>

175
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:52,413
<i>All over that Roman countryside</i>

176
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:56,887
<i>So don't forget that</i>
<i>When you're taking a bride</i>

177
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:01,755
<i>Sobbing fit to be tied</i>
<i>From that riotous ride</i>

178
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:05,487
- So, then what happened?
- Gather around, I'll tell you.

179
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:09,863
<i>They never did return their plunder</i>
<i>The victor gets all the loot</i>

180
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:14,533
<i>They carried them home, by thunder</i>
<i>To rotundas, small, but cute</i>

181
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:20,008
<i>And you've never seen, so they tell me</i>
<i>Such downright domesticity</i>

182
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:24,445
<i>With a Roman baby on each knee</i>
<i>Named Claudius and Brute</i>

183
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:29,609
<i>Oh, yes, them a-women was sobbing</i>
<i>Sobbing, sobbing, passing them nights</i>

184
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:33,919
<i>While the Romans was going out</i>
<i>Hobnobbing, starting up fights</i>

185
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:34,981
Is that so?

186
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,997
<i>They kept occupied by sewing lots</i>
<i>Of little old togas for them tots</i>

187
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:44,664
<i>And saying, "Some day, womenfolks</i>
<i>Will have rights</i> <i>"</i>

188
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:47,870
<i>- Passing all of their nights</i>
<i>- Just sewing</i>

189
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:49,702
<i>While the Romans had fights</i>

190
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,207
Hey, listen to this.

191
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:56,009
<i>When the men folk went to fetch them</i>
<i>The women would not be fetched</i>

192
00:17:56,081 --> 00:18:00,017
<i>It seems when the Romans catch them</i>
<i>Their lady friends stay catched</i>

193
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,109
<i>Right!</i>

194
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:05,384
<i>Now, let this be because it's true</i>
<i>A lesson to the likes of you</i>

195
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,754
<i>Rough them up like them there Romans do</i>
<i>Or else they'll think you're tetched</i>

196
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:14,623
<i>Oh, yes, them women were sobbing</i>
<i>Sobbing, sobbing buckets of tears</i>

197
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:15,859
<i>Mighty sad!</i>

198
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:19,368
<i>On account of old dobbin, dobbin</i>
<i>Really rattled their ears</i>

199
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:23,406
<i>And that ain't all</i>
<i>Oh, they acted angry and annoyed</i>

200
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:26,008
<i>But secretly they was overjoyed</i>

201
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:29,877
<i>You might recall that</i>
<i>When corralling your steers</i>

202
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:32,348
<i>Oh, oh, oh, them poor little dears</i>

203
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:35,008
What are you sitting there for?
Let's go get them.

204
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:39,580
<i>Oh, yes, them a-women was sobbing</i>
<i>Sobbing, sobbing, weeping a ton</i>

205
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:44,626
<i>Just remember what Robin, Robin</i>
<i>Robin Hood would have done</i>

206
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:50,624
<i>We'll be just like them there merry men</i>
<i>And make them all merry once again</i>

207
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:54,335
<i>And though they'll be a-sobbing</i>
<i>for a while</i>

208
00:18:54,406 --> 00:18:59,366
<i>Oh, yes, we're gonna make them</i>
<i>Sobbing women smile!</i>

209
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:16,024
Whoa, there!

210
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:19,363
Go get them. Be quiet about it.

211
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:21,658
I'll wait for you here.

212
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,371
Dan! Eph!

213
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:34,802
Your two's in here.

214
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,073
They're coming out.

215
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:41,084
- Good night, Liza.
- Good night.

216
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,026
Hey, you got mine.

217
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:57,067
- How about my good night kiss, Sarah?
- Oh, Carl! You're so persistent.

218
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:59,033
Be a sport. Just one kiss.

219
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:02,835
Maybe just a little one. Close your eyes.

220
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:09,578
Why, Carl!

221
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:14,580
Frank! What are you doing? Put me down.

222
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:20,515
That a boy, get them in.

223
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:23,691
Come on, Frank.

224
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:26,794
Where's Gideon?

225
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:33,301
I hear the cat outside.

226
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,271
I'll go, Mrs. Elcott.

227
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:38,571
Poor Pansy, out on a night like this.

228
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:56,418
Hurry it up, will you?

229
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:05,330
Sounds like Pansy has the croup.

230
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:07,098
I'll look out in back.

231
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:13,269
It's all right, Alice, she's here.

232
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:28,252
Dorcas!

233
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:32,695
Pa! Pa, come quick!

234
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:35,732
That a boy, Gideon.

235
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:53,315
- What's keeping Benjamin?
- I don't know.

236
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:56,818
Keep them quiet.

237
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:00,483
Let's go!

238
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:02,450
Come on!

239
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,990
Hey, there, come on!

240
00:22:13,738 --> 00:22:15,933
- Sarah Kines! She's gone!
- So is Alice.

241
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:18,441
- Ruth Jebson, too!
- Where's Dorcas?

242
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:21,568
It was them Pontipees.
The whole seven of them jumped me!

243
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:23,341
Come on, we'll get them.

244
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:17,593
Make them stop that yelling.
We're coming to the Pass.

245
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,695
Keep them quiet or we'll have
an avalanche down on us.

246
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,767
All right. Here we go. Hold your breath.

247
00:23:43,094 --> 00:23:44,493
Keep her quiet!

248
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,763
Hurry up, Adam. I can hear them coming.

249
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:23,994
All right, let them go!

250
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:38,912
There she goes!

251
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:05,234
<i>On account of old dobbin, dobbin</i>
<i>Really rattled their ears</i>

252
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:10,239
All right, boys, line them up.

253
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:11,798
Milly! Milly!

254
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:15,077
What have you done?

255
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:18,115
- Milly, help us, please!
- Milly, we've been kidnapped.

256
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:19,706
Make them take us back!

257
00:26:19,784 --> 00:26:22,252
You take these girls back at once,
do you hear?

258
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,685
- Can't.
- There was an avalanche.

259
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:26,451
I guess they'll just have to wait till spring.

260
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:29,090
It was your idea, wasn't it?

261
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,627
I'd say it was more yours.

262
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:33,562
It all came out of that book
about them "sobbing women."

263
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:35,724
What kind of men are you, anyway?

264
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,233
Are you animals that you'd do
a thing like this?

265
00:26:38,302 --> 00:26:40,998
Swooping down like hawks,
carrying off poor innocents.

266
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:43,370
They're just young boys in love, that's all.

267
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:47,104
Didn't you tell me today you wanted them
all married with wives of their own?

268
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:48,975
I want my mother!

269
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:52,706
Please don't cry, Alice. I'm sorry, honest...

270
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:55,582
but it was the only way
I could get to marry you.

271
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:57,816
- Adam!
- What?

272
00:26:57,922 --> 00:26:59,913
We forgot to get the parson!

273
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:04,059
Now, don't worry. Go on in the kitchen.
Nothing's going to happen.

274
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:06,187
Cheer up. You've got them, haven't you?

275
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:08,596
Everything's going to turn out all right.

276
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,566
This house is for the girls...

277
00:27:10,668 --> 00:27:14,104
and you're not gonna set foot in it
as long as they're here.

278
00:27:14,172 --> 00:27:17,733
You're gonna eat and sleep in the barn
with the rest of the livestock.

279
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:20,505
Now, get out of here. I'm ashamed of you.

280
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:22,939
Go ahead, boys, go on.

281
00:27:24,715 --> 00:27:26,342
- Now, Milly...
- You, too!

282
00:27:26,684 --> 00:27:28,549
You're taking this too hard.

283
00:27:28,686 --> 00:27:32,383
It'll work out fine. Me and the boys'll
get a parson here some way.

284
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,486
Do you think those girls
would marry them now?

285
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:39,062
You think because you got a wife
so easily...

286
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,328
'cause I didn't make you court me
and coax me, that that's all there is to it.

287
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:45,801
I said yes to you
'cause I fell in love with you...

288
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,464
the first time I saw you standing there.

289
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:51,264
- I thought it was the same with you.
- Milly...

290
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:53,776
You think a wife is just to cook and clean.

291
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:56,746
You got no understanding,
you got no feelings.

292
00:27:57,215 --> 00:27:59,740
How could you do a thing like this?

293
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:03,114
When I think of these poor girls,
sick with fright...

294
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:05,587
and their families crazed with <i>worry...</i>

295
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,251
I can't abide to look at you!

296
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:26,566
This isn't exactly the way we'd planned
on spending the night, in a barn!

297
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:32,182
- What do you think you're doing?
- Getting out of here.

298
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,684
Going up to the trapping cabin
to wait out the winter.

299
00:28:34,752 --> 00:28:37,721
You can't do it, Adam.
You can't stay up there alone.

300
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:39,847
The cabin's got enough supplies
for six months.

301
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:42,188
Don't go, Adam. It's us she's mad at.

302
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:46,952
It's more than that.
It's something goes a lot deeper.

303
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:48,692
Suppose you get sick...

304
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:51,462
or break a leg or something,
up there all alone?

305
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:53,970
And the wolves are mighty bad this year.

306
00:28:54,205 --> 00:28:58,164
The wolves will seem like good company
after what I've just been through.

307
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:09,878
Nothing like a nice, hot cup of tea
when you're all tuckered out.

308
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:13,651
Milly, it's me, Gideon.
I gotta speak to you.

309
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:17,351
Oh, Milly! Please, Milly,
don't open the door!

310
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:19,420
What is it?

311
00:29:19,497 --> 00:29:20,589
It's about Adam.

312
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:24,192
He's going away up into the mountains,
up to the trapping cabin.

313
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:26,362
Milly, can you hear me?

314
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:27,795
I hear.

315
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:30,500
If you'd just speak to him,
ask him not to go.

316
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:32,139
Please, Milly.

317
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:36,908
He's gotta learn
he can't treat people this way.

318
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:00,934
Now, Eph, let's start here.

319
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:43,003
You afraid of a little snowball?

320
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:52,180
Snowballs with rocks in them!

321
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,324
"Them poor little dears,
sobbing buckets of tears."

322
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:03,029
"When the sign was given,
drawing their swords...

323
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,761
"and falling with a great shout...

324
00:31:04,835 --> 00:31:07,599
"they ravished away
the daughters of the Sabine."

325
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:09,231
Who is it?

326
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:12,542
It's me, Caleb.

327
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:15,576
What do you want?

328
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:20,209
It's a mighty cold night, Milly.
I need an extra blanket.

329
00:31:22,987 --> 00:31:24,284
Go and get one.

330
00:31:33,464 --> 00:31:35,364
"It continues the custom to this day...

331
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,869
"for the bride, not of herself,
to pass her husband's threshold...

332
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:40,096
"but to be lifted over...

333
00:31:40,171 --> 00:31:43,572
"in memory that the Sabine women
were carried in by violence."

334
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:46,440
Who is it?

335
00:31:47,078 --> 00:31:48,170
Benjamin.

336
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:51,079
What do you want?

337
00:31:51,615 --> 00:31:55,551
My leg is feeling poorly.
I need some liniment.

338
00:31:58,155 --> 00:32:00,180
Go ahead, but be quick about it.

339
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:01,721
Yes, Milly.

340
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:17,002
"Some say, too, the custom
of parting the bride's hair...

341
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:19,599
"with the head of a spear
was in token of..."

342
00:32:24,715 --> 00:32:26,273
I got me a stiff neck.

343
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:27,817
That's enough of this nonsense.

344
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:29,375
- We just wanted to...
- Look, Milly...

345
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:33,617
Go on out to the barn, all of you.
Go to sleep, or I'll bolt the door on you.

346
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:47,065
"...was in token of their marriages.

347
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:50,938
"It began at first by wars
and acts of hostility...

348
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:52,504
"and <i>then..."</i>

349
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:13,591
Doesn't it do anything but snow up here?

350
00:33:13,697 --> 00:33:16,564
We've had a blizzard every day
for the past two months.

351
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:19,397
I'm going crazy, shut up in this house!

352
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,001
- Alice, why don't you read out loud to us?
- No.

353
00:33:23,073 --> 00:33:25,200
We've heard that book
three times already.

354
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:28,005
Yes, go on. Read us
about the "sobbing women."

355
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:30,545
- Please, Alice.
- I can't stand it again.

356
00:33:30,647 --> 00:33:33,172
Then go get the dress Milly promised,
and I'll fit you.

357
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,684
What's the use
when there's no one to see it?

358
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:36,844
No one?

359
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,588
Well, I like that! We're no one.

360
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:40,980
Where's Milly?

361
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:43,253
Out in the barn, hunting eggs.

362
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:47,422
I wish I could hunt eggs.
I love to hunt eggs.

363
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:50,957
Which boy slept in this bed,
do you suppose?

364
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,131
Dorcas Galen!

365
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:58,001
What's the matter?
Didn't you ever think of that...

366
00:33:58,075 --> 00:34:00,669
that you're sleeping in one of their beds?

367
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:04,011
Well, I certainly never thought
any such thing.

368
00:34:04,514 --> 00:34:08,382
Liza, Alice. Come away
from that window this minute.

369
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:13,020
I think it's disgusting standing there
where they can see you.

370
00:34:13,457 --> 00:34:17,393
I notice that you peek out often enough
when you think no one's looking.

371
00:34:17,461 --> 00:34:19,292
- I never!
- I saw you!

372
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:20,587
So did I!

373
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:21,824
You take that back!

374
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:23,593
You hear?

375
00:34:24,134 --> 00:34:26,728
How could you dare say a thing like that
about Martha?

376
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:29,829
And what were you doing last night,
out at the woodpile?

377
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:30,930
Oh, you!

378
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:32,235
Girls! Girls!

379
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:40,905
Girls!

380
00:34:42,486 --> 00:34:43,953
Stop it this minute!

381
00:34:44,688 --> 00:34:45,916
Dorcas! Alice!

382
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,388
Alice, get up!

383
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:51,154
Girls, please don't squabble.
Not now, not when I need you so much.

384
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,561
You see, I'm counting on all of you
to help me.

385
00:34:55,732 --> 00:34:57,666
'Cause I'm gonna have a baby.

386
00:34:58,068 --> 00:35:00,332
Milly! Come sit down!

387
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:02,204
Are you comfortable?

388
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,502
You're not going to lift a finger
from now on.

389
00:35:04,574 --> 00:35:06,064
We'll take over everything.

390
00:35:06,143 --> 00:35:09,112
We'll do your chores,
cleaning, cooking, everything.

391
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:11,079
No, really. That'd be silly.

392
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:12,342
Where are you going?

393
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:13,883
I have a few things to do.

394
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,747
When's the baby coming?

395
00:35:15,952 --> 00:35:17,419
You have to be patient.

396
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:18,954
But when?

397
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:20,820
In the spring.

398
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:27,894
- I wish it was me.
- Dorcas!

399
00:35:28,598 --> 00:35:30,998
I've always wanted to be a June bride...

400
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,197
and have a baby right off.

401
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,503
In the spring, maybe.

402
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:41,569
<i>Oh, they say when you marry in June</i>

403
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:46,206
<i>You're a bride all your life</i>

404
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:50,179
<i>And the bridegroom who marries in June</i>

405
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,622
<i>Gets a sweetheart for a wife</i>

406
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:58,859
<i>Winter weddings can be gay</i>

407
00:35:59,229 --> 00:36:03,097
<i>Like a Christmas holiday</i>

408
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:07,503
<i>But the June bride hears the song</i>

409
00:36:08,004 --> 00:36:11,906
<i>Of a spring that lasts all summer long</i>

410
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:16,211
<i>By the light of the silvery moon</i>

411
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,739
<i>Home you ride</i>
<i>Side by side</i>

412
00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:25,053
<i>With the echo of Mendelssohn's tune</i>

413
00:36:25,388 --> 00:36:29,324
<i>In your hearts</i>
<i>As you ride</i>

414
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:33,628
<i>For they say when you marry in June</i>

415
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:37,999
<i>You will always be a bride</i>

416
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:46,965
<i>The day a maiden marries</i>
<i>Is the day she carries through the years</i>

417
00:36:47,844 --> 00:36:52,611
<i>The church is full of flowers</i>
<i>Bridal showers are passé</i>

418
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:58,284
<i>The groom 's waiting at the altar</i>
<i>Here comes the bride</i>

419
00:36:58,488 --> 00:37:02,754
<i>They're each promising to love and obey</i>

420
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:08,854
<i>Best man is celebrating</i>
<i>Every bridesmaid's waiting just to see</i>

421
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:13,964
<i>Which one of them will catch</i>
<i>The wedding bouquet</i>

422
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:08,413
<i>For they say when you marry in June</i>

423
00:38:09,593 --> 00:38:12,391
<i>You will always</i>

424
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:20,926
<i>Always be a bride</i>

425
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:42,855
<i>In November the snow starts to fly</i>

426
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:46,660
<i>Piling up, ankle-high</i>

427
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:51,161
<i>Come December it's up to your knees</i>

428
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:55,301
<i>Still a bride's a bride-to-be</i>

429
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,470
<i>January, higher still</i>

430
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:03,606
<i>Through the parlor windowsill</i>

431
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,516
<i>February finds a drift</i>

432
00:39:08,184 --> 00:39:11,984
<i>And a storm that seems never to lift</i>

433
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:16,122
<i>March comes in like a lion, what else</i>

434
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:20,660
<i>Still the snow never melts</i>

435
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:24,964
<i>April showers will come, so they say</i>

436
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:28,927
<i>But they don't and it's May</i>

437
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:33,541
<i>You're about to forget the whole thing</i>

438
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:46,488
<i>All at once, one day it's spring!</i>

439
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:26,255
<i>Oh, the barnyard is busy</i>
<i>In a regular tizzy</i>

440
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:30,663
<i>And the obvious reason</i>
<i>Is because of the season</i>

441
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:34,969
<i>Ma Nature's lyrical</i>
<i>With her yearly miracle</i>

442
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:38,197
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

443
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:42,938
<i>All the hen-folk are hatching</i>
<i>While their menfolk are scratching</i>

444
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:47,312
<i>To ensure the survival</i>
<i>Of each brand-new arrival</i>

445
00:40:47,717 --> 00:40:51,744
<i>Each nest is twittering</i>
<i>They're all baby-sittering</i>

446
00:40:51,988 --> 00:40:55,048
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

447
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:59,393
<i>It's a beehive of budding son</i>
<i>And daughter life</i>

448
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:03,428
<i>Every family has plans in view</i>

449
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,734
<i>Even down in the brook</i>
<i>The underwater life</i>

450
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:11,871
<i>Is forever blowing bubbles, too</i>

451
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:16,269
<i>Every field wears a bonnet</i>
<i>With some spring daisies on it</i>

452
00:41:16,346 --> 00:41:20,840
<i>Even birds of a feather</i>
<i>Show their clothes off together</i>

453
00:41:21,017 --> 00:41:25,010
<i>Sun's getting shinery</i>
<i>To spotlight the finery</i>

454
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:28,247
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

455
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:32,453
<i>From his aerie the eagle</i>
<i>With his eagle eye</i>

456
00:41:32,996 --> 00:41:35,829
<i>Gazes down across his eagle beak</i>

457
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:40,933
<i>And affixing his lady with a legal eye</i>

458
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:44,570
<i>Screams, "Suppose we set</i>
<i>The date this week?"</i>

459
00:41:49,612 --> 00:41:53,742
<i>Yessiree, spring discloses</i>
<i>That it's all one supposes</i>

460
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:58,082
<i>It's a real bed of roses</i>
<i>Wagging tails, rubbing noses</i>

461
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:02,481
<i>Each day is Mother's Day</i>
<i>The next is some other's day</i>

462
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,222
<i>When love is king</i>

463
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:08,229
Frank, Dan, Ben, Caleb!

464
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:09,554
Everybody!

465
00:42:09,632 --> 00:42:11,793
Milly's having her baby!

466
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:40,655
Liza, Martha, Ruth, hurry!

467
00:42:40,897 --> 00:42:42,228
Hurry!

468
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:11,120
I'm an uncle.

469
00:44:10,486 --> 00:44:12,351
Adam!

470
00:44:13,456 --> 00:44:14,980
Hey, Gideon!

471
00:44:15,825 --> 00:44:18,259
Couldn't stand the barn any longer?

472
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:21,921
I've come to get you, Adam,
take you back with me.

473
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,092
Yeah?

474
00:44:26,035 --> 00:44:29,596
Well, Milly has a baby.
It come day before yesterday.

475
00:44:32,508 --> 00:44:34,100
I don't believe it.

476
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,638
- It's as true as I'm standing here.
- I don't believe it!

477
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:40,345
Just one of her tricks to get me back.

478
00:44:40,683 --> 00:44:41,741
Tricks?

479
00:44:42,018 --> 00:44:45,579
You lived with Milly as man and wife,
and you don't know nothing about her.

480
00:44:45,655 --> 00:44:47,885
She's got pride and she's spunky.

481
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:50,316
She'd never bring herself to ask you back.

482
00:44:50,393 --> 00:44:52,224
She'd be wasting her breath.

483
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,163
I don't figure to go.

484
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:59,224
Not even to see the baby?
Your own kin? Your own little girl?

485
00:44:59,902 --> 00:45:00,960
A girl?

486
00:45:02,005 --> 00:45:04,166
I might've known she'd have a girl.

487
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,570
I'll be back when the Pass is open.

488
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:10,237
And I'll stay away till the shooting's over.

489
00:45:10,313 --> 00:45:11,371
Adam...

490
00:45:13,082 --> 00:45:15,050
you're my eldest brother.

491
00:45:15,785 --> 00:45:18,549
I've always looked up to you,
tried to ape you...

492
00:45:19,655 --> 00:45:21,646
but today I'm ashamed for you.

493
00:45:23,192 --> 00:45:26,218
Now, I know you can lick me,
lick the tar out of me...

494
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:30,288
but I wouldn't hold myself no kind
of man unless I showed you how I felt.

495
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:40,667
Now, get!

496
00:45:55,124 --> 00:45:57,684
The Pass is open! The Pass is open!

497
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,023
All able-bodied men gather
at the Meeting House.

498
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,700
Bring your rifles, your knives,
your guns, axes, any kind of weapon!

499
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:11,366
The Pass is open! The Pass is open!

500
00:46:12,141 --> 00:46:13,267
Are you ready, men?

501
00:46:13,342 --> 00:46:15,071
Yeah! Let's go!

502
00:46:39,735 --> 00:46:41,726
Well, what are you staring at?

503
00:46:42,071 --> 00:46:44,369
I told you I'd be back
when the Pass was open.

504
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,464
The Pass?

505
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,975
Milly! What are we going to do?

506
00:46:48,044 --> 00:46:50,638
Go upstairs, girls. Go on. Quickly.

507
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:55,182
Let's get the guns.

508
00:46:57,487 --> 00:46:59,250
Tell them to hitch up the wagon.

509
00:46:59,322 --> 00:47:00,346
The wagon?

510
00:47:00,423 --> 00:47:03,324
Put plenty of blankets and straw in it.
Go ahead.

511
00:47:37,026 --> 00:47:38,550
What do you call her?

512
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:42,022
I was thinking of some name like...

513
00:47:42,098 --> 00:47:44,123
Hannah or Hagar or Hephzibah.

514
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:47,728
Picking up where your mother left off.

515
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:50,765
Hannah.

516
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:58,306
I got to thinking up there
in the mountains...

517
00:47:59,115 --> 00:48:00,912
thinking about the baby.

518
00:48:03,953 --> 00:48:07,650
About how I'd feel if somebody
came sneaking in and carried her off.

519
00:48:09,025 --> 00:48:11,220
I'd string him up the nearest tree...

520
00:48:11,294 --> 00:48:14,024
shoot him down
like I would a thieving fox.

521
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,030
I thought about you, too,
while I was up there.

522
00:48:22,371 --> 00:48:25,204
It seemed like I couldn't get you
off of my mind.

523
00:48:28,544 --> 00:48:30,409
Milly, when you're in love...

524
00:48:31,614 --> 00:48:33,605
when you're really in <i>love...</i>

525
00:48:48,564 --> 00:48:50,259
The wagon's ready, Adam.

526
00:48:50,933 --> 00:48:52,025
All right.

527
00:48:52,768 --> 00:48:56,226
Now, get the girls. I want to take them
back to their families.

528
00:48:58,608 --> 00:48:59,700
Oh, Adam!

529
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,778
Adam, you will be careful?

530
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,911
We're not letting you
take them back, Adam.

531
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:16,390
We've talked it over amongst us,
and we're all agreed. They ain't going.

532
00:49:16,459 --> 00:49:18,051
They're our girls now.

533
00:49:21,397 --> 00:49:25,026
I say I'm taking them back.
I'm still head of this family.

534
00:49:26,168 --> 00:49:28,193
Then I reckon you'll have to show me.

535
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:29,499
Likewise.

536
00:49:32,241 --> 00:49:35,506
What do I have to do,
beat some sense in your dumb heads?

537
00:49:35,811 --> 00:49:38,405
Taking them back is the only way
you'll ever get them.

538
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:39,880
The whole town's coming up here.

539
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:42,179
Let them come! We'll fight them all.

540
00:49:43,286 --> 00:49:44,378
Sure.

541
00:49:44,854 --> 00:49:47,414
Sure you will. And who'll you be fighting?

542
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,057
The girls' kinfolk.

543
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,486
Someone's bound to get hurt,
a father, a brother, maybe.

544
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:56,458
Think they'll marry you after that?

545
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:04,901
Adam's right.

546
00:50:05,975 --> 00:50:07,340
I stand with Adam.

547
00:50:08,544 --> 00:50:10,375
Well, don't stand too close.

548
00:50:10,913 --> 00:50:13,746
Adam, the girls have gone.
They've run away!

549
00:50:14,216 --> 00:50:15,683
Go get them, get them back! Go on!

550
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:17,912
- Ruth!
- Dorcas! Come back here!

551
00:50:17,987 --> 00:50:19,682
- Sarah, where are you?
- Ruth!

552
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,288
Dorcas! Come back! You'll get hurt!

553
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:33,328
Now, let's keep it quiet.
They can hear us from here.

554
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:35,063
We'll creep up on them.

555
00:50:35,738 --> 00:50:36,762
Alice!

556
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:38,604
Please, Alice!

557
00:50:38,674 --> 00:50:40,073
Martha, where are you?

558
00:50:40,142 --> 00:50:42,440
Come back, Martha. Don't run away.

559
00:50:44,847 --> 00:50:47,907
I'm not going back!
I want to stay with you!

560
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:49,610
You've got to. It's the only way.

561
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:50,913
I won't! No!

562
00:50:53,122 --> 00:50:54,521
It's Alice!

563
00:50:54,623 --> 00:50:55,988
Come on, Ruth!

564
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:05,794
Hey, there they are!

565
00:51:13,342 --> 00:51:14,400
Let me go!

566
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:17,770
No!

567
00:51:18,214 --> 00:51:19,306
Let me go!

568
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,679
Don't! You'll hit Dorcas!

569
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:35,020
Oh, no!

570
00:51:36,132 --> 00:51:37,156
Not that!

571
00:51:49,779 --> 00:51:51,269
Grab her dress, Ben!

572
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:54,239
In the barn!

573
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:56,246
Ruth!

574
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:10,896
Why, Pa!

575
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:12,194
Get up!

576
00:52:16,439 --> 00:52:17,599
Alice!

577
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:23,669
Get off of her!

578
00:52:26,315 --> 00:52:28,306
What are you going to do to him?

579
00:52:28,384 --> 00:52:32,081
We're going to hang him with
the rest of them from the nearest tree.

580
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:37,691
Just a minute!

581
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,786
Before we go, there's one thing
we've got to know from our girls.

582
00:52:40,863 --> 00:52:42,353
Girls! Girls!

583
00:52:42,765 --> 00:52:45,063
Now, Reverend,
what is it you want to know?

584
00:52:45,134 --> 00:52:48,968
We're all fathers here, and we love you,
so don't be afraid to answer.

585
00:52:49,705 --> 00:52:52,606
A while back I heard a wee babe
crying in the house.

586
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:53,868
Whose is it?

587
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:57,809
Whose is it? Don't be afraid to tell.

588
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:01,777
Mine!

589
00:53:06,622 --> 00:53:09,523
Do you, Alice, Ruth, Martha,
Liza, Sarah, Dorcas...

590
00:53:09,592 --> 00:53:12,459
take these men to be
your lawfully wedded husbands?

591
00:53:17,399 --> 00:53:18,627
We do.

592
00:53:18,701 --> 00:53:21,693
Do you, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel,
Ephraim, Frankincense, Gideon...

593
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:24,671
take these girls to be
your lawfully wedded wives?

594
00:53:30,112 --> 00:53:31,170
We do.

595
00:53:31,413 --> 00:53:33,142
I now pronounce you men and wives.
