0
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,228
Men are haunted by the vastness
of eternity.

1
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,592
And so we ask ourselves...

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,757
... will our actions echo
across the centuries?

3
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,633
Will strangers hear our names
long after we're gone...

4
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,031
...and wonder who we were...

5
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,431
...how bravely we fought...

6
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,391
...how fiercely we loved?

7
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,113
Good day for the crows.

8
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,389
Remove your army from my land.

9
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,312
I like your land.

10
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,872
I think we'll stay. I like your soldiers too.

11
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,513
They won't fight for you.

12
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,631
That's what the Messenians said.

13
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,678
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.

14
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,713
Now they all fight for me.

15
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,309
You can't have the whole world,
Agamemnon.

16
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,710
It's too big, even for you.

17
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,428
I don't want to watch another massacre.

18
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,673
Let's settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.

19
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,671
And if my man wins?

20
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,751
We'll leave Thessaly for good.

21
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,031
Boagrius!

22
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,510
Achilles!

23
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,229
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.

24
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,397
Careful who you insult, old king.

25
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,632
My king, Achilles is not with the army.

26
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,473
-Where is he?
-I sent a boy to look for him.

27
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,236
I was having a good dream.

28
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,673
Very good dream.

29
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,836
King Agamemnon sent me.
He needs to--

30
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,070
I'll speak to your king in the morning.

31
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,151
But my lord, it is morning.

32
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,430
They're waiting for you.

33
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,990
Are the stories about you true?

34
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,433
They say your mother is
an immortal goddess.

35
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,593
They say you can't be killed.

36
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,513
I wouldn't be bothering
with the shield then, would I?

37
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,910
The Thessalonian you're fighting. . .

38
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,232
. . .he's the biggest man I've ever seen.
I wouldn't want to fight him.

39
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,954
That's why no one will remember
your name.

40
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,036
Perhaps we should have our war
tomorrow, when you're better rested.

41
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,634
I should have you whipped
for your impudence!

42
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,399
Perhaps you should fight him.

43
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,312
Achilles.

44
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,792
Achilles.

45
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,115
Look at the men's faces.
You can save hundreds of them.

46
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,877
You can end this war
with a swing of your sword.

47
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,236
Let them go home to their wives.

48
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,271
Imagine a king who fights his
own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight.

49
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,076
Of all the warlords loved by the gods,
I hate him the most.

50
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,551
Is there no one else?

51
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,512
Is there no one else?

52
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,878
Who are you, soldier?

53
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,673
Achilles. Son of Peleus.

54
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,834
Achilles?

55
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,312
I'll remember the name.

56
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,671
The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter.

57
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,674
Give it to your king.

58
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,679
He's not my king.

59
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,434
Brothers in arms!

60
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,716
-Friendship!
-Friendship!

61
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,237
Princes of Troy,
on our last night together. . .

62
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,797
. . .Queen Helen and I salute you.

63
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,670
We've had our conflicts before, it's true.

64
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,912
We fought many battles,
Sparta and Troy. And fought well!

65
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,349
But I have always respected your father.

66
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,954
Priam is a good king, a good man.

67
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,999
I respected him as an adversary.
I respect him now as my ally.

68
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,753
Hector, Paris,
young princes, come. Stand.

69
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,514
Drink with me.

70
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,314
Let us drink to peace.

71
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,556
To peace between Troy and Sparta.

72
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,834
May the gods keep the wolves
in the hills and the women in our beds.

73
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,470
-For the gods.
-For the gods.

74
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,918
You shouldn't be here.

75
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,389
That's what you said last night.

76
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,910
Last night was a mistake.

77
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,991
And the night before?

78
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,429
I've made many mistakes this week.

79
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,190
Do you want me to go?

80
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,271
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.

81
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,998
They're beautiful.

82
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,512
But I can't wear them.

83
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,715
Menelaus would kill us both.

84
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,472
Don't be afraid of him.

85
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,590
I'm not afraid of dying.

86
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,396
I'm afraid of tomorrow.

87
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,513
I'm afraid of watching you sail away
and knowing you'll never come back.

88
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,433
Before you came to Sparta,
I was a ghost.

89
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,237
I walked, and I ate,
and I swam in the sea. . .

90
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,356
. . .but I was just a ghost.

91
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,438
You don't have to fear tomorrow.

92
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,512
Come with me.

93
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,068
Don't play with me. Don't play.

94
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,232
If you come, we'll never be safe.

95
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,911
Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us.

96
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,274
But I'll love you.

97
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,391
Till the day they burn my body. . .

98
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,111
. . .I will love you.

99
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,279
A beautiful morning.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.

100
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,714
Sometimes the gods bless you in the
morning and curse you in the afternoon.

101
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,394
Drop sail!

102
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,479
Do you love me, brother?

103
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,990
Would you protect me
against any enemy?

104
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,956
The last time you spoke to me like this. . .

105
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,317
. . .you were 10 years old,
and you'd just stolen Father's horse.

106
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,550
What have you done now?

107
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,839
I must show you something.

108
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,674
Where is she?

109
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,113
I swear by the father of the gods,
I will gut you here if you don't tell me!

110
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,998
My king!

111
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,199
She left.

112
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,634
With the Trojans.

113
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,393
The fisherman here saw her
board their ship.

114
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,999
The Trojans?

115
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,836
With the young prince, Paris. She. . . .

116
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,630
Get my ship ready.

117
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,110
Turn us round. Back to Sparta.

118
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,554
High on the sail!

119
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,153
-Wait, wait.
-You fool!

120
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,550
-Listen to me.
-Do you know what you've done?

121
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,996
Do you know how many years our father
worked for peace?

122
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,311
I love her.

123
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,272
It's all a game to you, isn't it?

124
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,069
You roam from town to town, bedding
merchants' wives and temple maids.

125
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,276
You think you know
something about love.

126
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,839
What about your father's love?

127
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,514
You spat on him when you
brought her on this ship!

128
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,548
What about the love for your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman?

129
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,190
I won't let you start a war for her.

130
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,793
May I speak?

131
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,833
What you're saying is true. I've wronged
you. I've wronged our father.

132
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,958
If you want to take Helen
back to Sparta, so be it.

133
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,358
But I go with her.

134
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,672
To Sparta? They'll kill you.

135
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,070
Then I'll die fighting.

136
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,676
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you,
doesn't it? To die fighting.

137
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,718
-Little brother, have you ever killed a man?
-No.

138
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,871
-Ever seen a man die in combat?
-No.

139
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,113
I've killed men, and I've heard them
dying. And I've watched them dying.

140
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,953
And there's nothing glorious about it.
Nothing poetic.

141
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,271
You say you want to die for love.
You know nothing about dying.

142
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,510
And you know nothing about love!

143
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,478
All the same, I go with her.

144
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,756
I won't ask you to fight my war.

145
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,558
You already have.

146
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,919
To Troy!

147
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,992
About ship! Set sail!

148
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,636
-I want her back.
-Well, of course you do.

149
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,393
She's a beautiful woman.

150
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,996
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands.

151
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,358
I won't rest till I've burned Troy
to the ground.

152
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,556
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.

153
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,517
I should have listened to you.

154
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,830
Peace is for the women. . .

155
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,151
. . .and the weak.

156
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,999
Empires are forged by war.

157
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,075
All my life, I've stood by your side,
fought your enemies.

158
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,036
You're the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.

159
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,676
But have I ever complained?
Have I ever asked you for anything?

160
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,513
Never. You're a man of honor.

161
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,311
Will you go to war with me, brother?

162
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,195
I always thought my brother's wife
was a foolish woman. . .

163
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,079
. . .but she's proved to be very useful.

164
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,790
The Trojans have never been conquered.

165
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,436
Some say they can't be conquered.

166
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,752
Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable
behind his high walls.

167
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,793
He thinks the sun god will protect him.

168
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,514
But the gods protect only. . .

169
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,112
. . .the strong!

170
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,990
If Troy falls. . .

171
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,197
. . .I control the Aegean.

172
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,954
Hector commands the finest army
in the east.

173
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,430
I'll attack them with the greatest force
the world has ever seen.

174
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,672
I want all the kings of Greece
and their armies.

175
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,678
Send emissaries in the morning.

176
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,478
One last thing.

177
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,837
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.

178
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,313
Achilles.

179
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,958
He can't be controlled.
He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans.

180
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,396
We don't need to control him,
we need to unleash him.

181
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,389
That man was born to end lives.

182
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,792
Yes, he's a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I've built.

183
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,758
Before me, Greece was nothing.

184
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,195
I brought all the
Greek kingdoms together.

185
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,109
I created a nation out of fire worshipers
and snake eaters!

186
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,919
I build the future, Nestor. Me!

187
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,996
Achilles is the past.

188
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,312
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.

189
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,870
How many battles have we won
off the edge of his sword?

190
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,157
This will be the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

191
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,629
We need the greatest warrior.

192
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,115
There's only one man he'll listen to.

193
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,873
Never hesitate.

194
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,872
Nervous?

195
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,116
Petrified.

196
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,113
You told me never
to change sword hands.

197
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,918
Yes. When you know how to use it,
you won't be taking my orders.

198
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,515
Your reputation for hospitality
is fast becoming legend.

199
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,037
Patroclus, my cousin.

200
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,437
Odysseus, king of lthaca.

201
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,277
Patroclus. I knew your parents well.

202
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,793
I miss them.

203
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,118
Now you have this one
watching over you, eh?

204
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,669
Learning from Achilles himself.

205
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,351
Kings would kill for the honor.

206
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,034
Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding?

207
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,274
We need to talk.

208
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,632
I will not fight for him.

209
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
I'm not asking you to fight for him.

210
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,431
I'm asking you to fight for the Greeks.

211
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,830
Are the Greeks tired of fighting
each other?

212
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,151
-For now.
-The Trojans never harmed me.

213
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,032
They insulted Greece.

214
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,909
They insulted a man who couldn't hold
on to his wife. Is that my business?

215
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,435
Your business is war, my friend.

216
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,556
Is it? The man has no honor.

217
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,951
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.

218
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,078
And let the gods decide
which man to glorify.

219
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,874
-For the Greeks!
-Forget Agamemnon.

220
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,753
Fight for me.

221
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,317
My wife will feel much better
if she knows you're by my side.

222
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,913
I'll feel much better.

223
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,878
We're sending the largest fleet
that ever sailed.

224
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,553
A thousand ships.

225
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,440
Prince Hector.
Is he as good a warrior as they say?

226
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,909
The best of all the Trojans.

227
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,637
Some say he's better
than all the Greeks too.

228
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,711
Even if your cousin doesn't come. . .

229
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,356
. . .I hope you'll join us.
We could use a strong arm like yours.

230
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,675
Play your tricks on me,
but not my cousin.

231
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,798
You have your swords. I have my tricks.

232
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,991
We play with the toys the gods give us.

233
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,472
We sail for Troy in three days.

234
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,711
This war will never be forgotten.

235
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,828
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.

236
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,670
I knew they would come for you.

237
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,675
Long before you were born. . .

238
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,238
. . .I knew they would come.

239
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,956
They want you to fight in Troy.

240
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,953
I'm making you
another seashell necklace.

241
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,835
Like the ones I made you
when you were a boy.

242
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,399
Do you remember?

243
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,439
Mother. . .

244
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,032
. . .tonight, I decide.

245
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,156
If you stay in Lárisa. . .

246
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,958
. . .you will find peace.

247
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,951
You will find a wonderful woman.

248
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,271
You will have sons and daughters,
and they will have children.

249
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,557
And they will love you.

250
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,280
When you are gone,
they will remember you.

251
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,588
But when your children are dead
and their children after them. . .

252
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,671
. . .your name will be lost.

253
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,634
If you go to Troy. . .

254
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,830
. . .glory will be yours.

255
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,757
They will write stories about your
victories for thousands of years.

256
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,438
The world will remember your name.

257
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,276
But if you go to Troy. . .

258
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,835
. . .you will never come home.

259
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,749
For your glory walks hand in hand
with your doom.

260
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,235
And I shall never see you again.

261
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,955
-My son.
-Father.

262
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,915
Paris.

263
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,594
Father.

264
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,110
-This is Helen.
-Helen?

265
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,673
Helen of Sparta?

266
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,237
Helen of Troy.

267
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,796
I've heard rumors of your beauty.

268
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,473
For once. . .

269
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,951
. . .the gossips were right.

270
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,388
Welcome.

271
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,269
Come, you must be tired.

272
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,038
Look.

273
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,478
He's grown.

274
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,313
He is strong.

275
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,516
-Briseis!
-Paris!

276
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,516
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows
with each new moon.

277
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,151
Briseis.

278
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,312
A servant of Apollo now.

279
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,234
The young men of Troy were devastated
when Briseis chose the virgin robes.

280
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,354
Father. . .

281
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,988
. . .I know this is the last thing we need.

282
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,517
It is the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.

283
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,318
-But I'm surprised you let him bring her.
-lf I'd let him fight Menelaus for her. . .

284
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,472
. . .you'd be burning a son's body,
not welcoming a daughter.

285
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,108
We could send peace envoys
to Menelaus.

286
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,999
You know Menelaus.
He'd spear their heads to his gate.

287
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,031
What would you have me do?

288
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,438
Put her on a ship and send her home.

289
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,391
Women have always loved Paris,
and he has loved them back.

290
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,118
But this is different.

291
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,510
Something has changed in him.

292
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,355
If we send her home to Menelaus,
he will follow her.

293
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,038
This is my country,
and these are my countrymen.

294
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,590
I don't want to see them suffer
so my brother can have his prize.

295
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,590
It's not just the Spartans
coming after her.

296
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,910
By now, Menelaus has gone
to Agamemnon.

297
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,640
And Agamemnon has wanted
to destroy us for years.

298
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,431
Enemies have been attacking us
for centuries. Our walls still stand.

299
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,993
Father, we can't win this war.

300
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,070
Apollo watches over us.

301
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,677
Even Agamemnon
is no match for the gods.

302
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,479
And how many battalions
does the sun god command?

303
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,039
Do not mock the gods.

304
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,592
They're coming for me.

305
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,712
The wind is bringing them closer.

306
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,472
What if we left?

307
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,710
Tonight. Right now.

308
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,189
What if we went down to the stables,
took two horses and left?

309
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,231
Ride east, keep riding.

310
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,480
-And go where?
-Away from here.

311
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,270
I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us.

312
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,359
But this is your home.

313
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,557
You left your home for me.

314
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,590
Sparta was never my home.

315
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,993
My parents sent my there when I was 16
to marry Menelaus.

316
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,912
But it was never my home.

317
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,798
We'll live off the land.

318
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,396
No more palaces for us. No more
servants. We don't need any of that.

319
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,834
And your family?

320
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,675
We'd be protecting my family. If we're
not here, what's the need for war?

321
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,469
Menelaus won't give up.
He'll track us to the end of the world.

322
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,349
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.

323
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,476
You don't know Menelaus.

324
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,193
You don't know his brother.

325
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,716
They'll burn every house in Troy
to find us.

326
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,876
They'll never believe we've left.

327
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,030
And even if they do,
they'll burn it for spite.

328
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,629
Then I'll make it easy for him to find me.

329
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,760
I'll walk right up to him
and tell him you're mine.

330
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,791
You're very young, my love.

331
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,153
Look at that.

332
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,189
Take up your positions!

333
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,074
My lord?

334
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,591
Should we wait for the others?

335
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,677
-They brought us here for war.
-Yes, but Agamemnon's orders--

336
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,195
You fight for me, Eudorus,
or Agamemnon?

337
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,634
For you, my lord.

338
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,032
Then fight for me. And let the servants
of Agamemnon fight for him.

339
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,394
Black sail.

340
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,198
It's Achilles.

341
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,839
What's the fool doing?

342
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,759
He's going to take the beach of Troy
with 50 men?

343
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,917
Make way there! Make way!

344
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,637
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?

345
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,997
-Waiting at the city gates.
-Good. I'll be right there.

346
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,473
Lysander, how long
before the army is ready?

347
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,712
Half of our men are still coming.
We have to arm them--

348
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,313
-How long?
-Noon.

349
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,038
Make it sooner.

350
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,272
Patroclus!

351
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,632
Put down your spear.

352
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,791
-I'm fighting the Trojans.
-Not today.

353
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,916
I'm ready. You taught me how to fight.

354
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,829
And you're a good student.
But you're not a Myrmidon yet.

355
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,953
Look at these men.

356
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,272
They are the fiercest soldiers in all
of Greece. Each of them has bled for me.

357
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,351
-Guard the ship.
-But this is a war.

358
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,638
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans if I'm
concerned for you. Guard the ship.

359
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,638
Trojans!

360
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,273
All my life, I've lived by a code.

361
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,516
And the code is simple:

362
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,399
Honor the gods, love your woman. . .

363
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,599
. . .and defend your country.

364
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,717
Troy is mother to us all.

365
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,474
Fight for her!

366
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,037
Myrmidons. . .

367
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,512
. . .my brothers of the sword.

368
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,190
I'd rather fight beside you
than any army of thousands.

369
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,477
Let no man forget how menacing we are.
We are lions!

370
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,796
Do you know what's there, waiting,
beyond that beach?

371
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,997
lmmortality! Take it! It's yours!

372
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,357
Fight positions!

373
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,398
Archers!

374
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,878
Forward!

375
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,036
The man wants to die.

376
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,999
On my command!

377
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,632
Break off! Break off!

378
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,874
Look at him.

379
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,874
Look.

380
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,876
Row, you lazy whores, row!

381
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,879
Greeks are dying! Row!

382
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,232
Those men down there need help. Now!
Tecton, with me.

383
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,468
Flank! To the flank!

384
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,157
Achilles! Achilles!

385
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,597
Back to the city! Back to the city!

386
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,275
The sun god is a patron of Troy,
our enemy.

387
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,000
Take whatever treasure you can find.

388
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,638
With your permission, my lord.

389
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,193
-Speak.
-Apollo sees everything.

390
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,033
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.

391
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,233
Warn the men.

392
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,918
Wait.

393
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,873
You are very brave or very stupid
to come after me alone.

394
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,832
You must be Hector.

395
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,474
Do you know who I am?

396
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,318
These priests weren't armed.

397
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,276
Fight me!

398
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,629
Why kill you now, prince of Troy. . .

399
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,234
. . .with no one here to see you fall?

400
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,394
Why did you come here?

401
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,194
They'll be talking about this war
for 1000 years.

402
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,238
In 1000 years, the dust
from our bones will be gone.

403
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,755
Yes, prince. But our names will remain.

404
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,834
Go home, prince. Drink some wine,
make love to your wife.

405
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,798
Tomorrow, we'll have our war.

406
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,351
You speak of war as if it's a game.

407
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,195
How many wives wait at Troy's gates
for husbands they'll never see again?

408
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,839
Your brother can comfort them.

409
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,037
I hear he's good at charming
other men's wives.

410
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,352
My lord, you let him go?

411
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,033
It's too early in the day
for killing princes.

412
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,191
Achilles! Achilles!

413
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,515
-Achilles.
-Ajax.

414
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,431
You're as fearless as the gods.
I'm honored to go to war with you.

415
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,953
As am I.

416
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,110
If you sailed slower,
the war would be over.

417
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,840
I'll miss the start as long as I'm here
at the end.

418
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,196
I've got something to show you.

419
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,558
The men found her
hiding in the temple.

420
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,279
They thought she'd. . .

421
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,913
. . .amuse you.

422
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,279
What's your name?

423
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,038
Did you not hear me?

424
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,992
You killed Apollo's priests.

425
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,674
I've killed men in five countries,
never a priest.

426
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,637
Well, then your men did.

427
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,831
The sun god will have his vengeance.

428
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,754
What's he waiting for?

429
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,036
The right time to strike.

430
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,198
His priests are dead,
and his acolyte's a captive.

431
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,920
-I think your god is afraid of me.
-Afraid?

432
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,117
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.

433
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,840
-Where is he?
-You're nothing but a killer!

434
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,639
You wouldn't know anything
about the gods.

435
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,238
I know more about the gods
than your priests.

436
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,273
I've seen them.

437
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,118
You're royalty, aren't you?

438
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,030
Spent years talking down to men.

439
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,632
You must be royalty.

440
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,153
What's your name?

441
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,280
Even the servants of Apollo
have names.

442
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,712
Briseis.

443
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,151
Are you afraid, Briseis?

444
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,633
Should I be?

445
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,593
My lord.

446
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,319
Agamemnon requests your presence.

447
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,633
The kings are gathering
to celebrate the victory.

448
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,638
You fought well today.

449
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,638
My lord.

450
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,436
What do you want here in Troy?

451
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,316
You didn't come
for the Spartan queen.

452
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,152
I want what all men want.

453
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,232
I just want it more.

454
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,391
You don't need to fear me, girl.

455
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,470
You're the only Trojan
who can say that.

456
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,396
You have won a great victory,
my king of kings.

457
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,318
No one thought the Trojan beach
could be captured so easily.

458
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,070
A beautiful gift, Triopas.

459
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,708
You will be among the first to walk
in the streets of Troy tomorrow.

460
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,393
My father, Neleus, had this urn made to
commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.

461
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,312
I present it to you. . .

462
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,279
. . .in honor of an even more
memorable victory.

463
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,038
Thank you, old friend.

464
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,355
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper
in the gardens of Troy.

465
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,634
Leave us.

466
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,877
War is young men dying
and old men talking. You know this.

467
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,031
Ignore the politics.

468
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,591
Apparently, you won
some great victory.

469
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,232
Perhaps you didn't notice. The Trojan
beach belonged to Priam in the morning.

470
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,153
It belongs to Agamemnon
in the afternoon.

471
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,515
Have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.

472
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,954
No.

473
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,795
You came here because you want
your name to last through the ages.

474
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,758
A great victory was won today.

475
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,475
But that victory is not yours.

476
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,074
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.

477
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,153
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.

478
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,869
Perhaps the kings were too far behind
to see. Soldiers won the battle.

479
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,235
History remembers kings!

480
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,352
Not soldiers.

481
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,868
Tomorrow, we'll batter down
the gates of Troy.

482
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,679
I'll build monuments
on every island of Greece.

483
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,957
I'll carve " Agamemnon" in the stone.

484
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,874
Be careful, king of kings.
First, you need the victory.

485
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,709
Your men sacked the temple
of Apollo, yes?

486
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,472
You want gold? Take it.

487
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,552
It's my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.

488
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,551
I already have.

489
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,472
Aphareus!

490
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,394
Haemon!

491
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,114
The spoils of war.

492
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,114
No argument wit you, but if you don't
release her, you'll never see home again.

493
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,714
-Decide.
-Guards!

494
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,633
Stop!

495
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,797
Too many men have died today.

496
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,078
If killing is your only talent,
that's your curse.

497
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,874
I don't want anyone dying for me.

498
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:03,031
Mighty Achilles,
silenced by a slave girl.

499
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,792
Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath.

500
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,718
And then. . .

501
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,080
-. . .who knows?
-You sack of wine!

502
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,792
Before my time is done, I will look
down on your corpse and smile.

503
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,916
If they want a war,
we will give them a war.

504
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,996
I would match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day.

505
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,469
The best of Greece outnumber
the best of Troy two to one.

506
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,392
Glaucus.

507
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,469
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?

508
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,234
Our walls have never been breached.

509
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,635
We have the finest archers
in the world.

510
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,871
And we have Hector.

511
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,759
Yes, we can win.

512
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,670
I spoke to two farmers today.

513
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,835
They saw an eagle flying
with a serpent clutched in its talons.

514
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,392
This is a sign from Apollo.

515
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,676
We will win a great victory tomorrow.

516
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,353
Bird signs.

517
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,279
You want to plan a strategy
based on bird signs.

518
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,873
Hector, show respect.

519
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,953
The high priest
is a servant of the gods.

520
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,395
And I am a servant of Troy.

521
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,630
I've always honored the gods, Father.

522
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,713
But today I fought a Greek
who desecrated the statue of Apollo.

523
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,916
Apollo didn't strike the man down.

524
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,514
The gods won't fight this war for us.

525
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,477
There won't be a war.

526
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,271
This is not a conflict of nations.

527
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,590
It is a dispute between two men.

528
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,113
I don't want to see another Trojan die
because of me.

529
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,918
Paris.

530
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,550
Tomorrow morning, I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen.

531
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,998
The winner will take her home.
The loser will burn before nightfall.

532
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,953
Father. . .

533
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,680
. . .I'm sorry for the pain
I've caused you.

534
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,271
Do you love her?

535
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,913
You are a great king because you love
your country so much.

536
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,192
Every blade of grass.

537
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,031
Every grain of sand.

538
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,719
Every rock in the river.

539
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,915
You love all of Troy.

540
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,437
That is the way I love Helen.

541
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,718
I've fought many wars in my time.

542
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,470
Some were fought for land,
some for power, some for glory.

543
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,759
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest.

544
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,673
But I won't be the one fighting.

545
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,552
The sword of Troy.

546
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,755
My father carried this sword,
and his father before him. . .

547
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,434
. . .all the way back
to the founding of Troy.

548
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,559
The history of our people
was written with this sword.

549
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,910
Carry it with you tomorrow.

550
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,193
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.

551
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,432
So long as a Trojan carries it. . .

552
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,468
. . .our people have a future.

553
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,277
The man who killed Tecton
outside Apollo's temple. . .

554
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,839
. . .I've never seen a spear
thrown like that.

555
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,757
An impossible throw.

556
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,598
Don't go tomorrow.

557
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,199
-Please don't go.
-Paris fights tomorrow, not me.

558
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,035
Fifty thousand Greeks didn't cross
the sea to watch your brother fight.

559
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,553
You know this.

560
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,517
You'd make a fine general, my love.

561
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:33,071
You've been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.

562
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,756
You know I don't want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.

563
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,309
I want to see the girls chasing after him.

564
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,276
I can't lose you.

565
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,518
I won't survive.

566
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,512
I must see Paris.

567
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,559
Wait.

568
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,879
Wait!

569
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,433
Helen, what are you doing?

570
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,636
-Let me go.
-No.

571
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,630
I saw them burn.

572
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,434
I saw them burning on the pyres.

573
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,158
That's my fault.

574
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,515
It is. You know it is.

575
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,358
All those widows.

576
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,595
I still hear them screaming.

577
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,237
Their husbands died because I'm here.

578
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,718
I'm going down to the ships.

579
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,472
No, you're not.

580
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,150
-I'm giving myself back to Menelaus.
-It's too late for that.

581
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,232
Do you think Agamemnon cares
about his brother's marriage?

582
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,789
This is about power. Not love.

583
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,151
Paris is going to fight in the morning.

584
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,074
-Yes.
-Menelaus will kill him.

585
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,593
I won't let that happen.

586
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,031
-It's his decision.
-No.

587
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,914
I can't ask anyone to fight for me.

588
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,510
I'm no longer queen of Sparta.

589
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,910
You're a princess of Troy now. . .

590
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,674
. . .and my brother needs you tonight.

591
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,912
My lord.

592
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,791
My lord, the army is marching.

593
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,514
-Let them march. We stay.
-But the men are ready.

594
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,399
We stay till Agamemnon groans
to have Achilles back.

595
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,554
As you wish.

596
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,953
Are you ready to fight?

597
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,755
Are you ready to kill? To take life?

598
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,392
I am.

599
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,995
At night, I see their faces,
all the men I've killed.

600
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,311
They're standing there on the far bank
of the River Styx.

601
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,472
They're waiting for me.

602
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,471
They say, " Welcome, brother. "

603
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,237
We men are wretched things.

604
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,709
I taught you how to fight,
but I never taught you why to fight.

605
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,154
I fight for you.

606
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,231
Who will you fight for when I'm gone?

607
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,077
Soldiers, they fight for kings
they've never even met.

608
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,634
They do what they're told,
die when they're told to.

609
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,119
Soldiers obey.

610
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,951
Don't waste your life following
some fool's orders.

611
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,279
Go.

612
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,637
Are you sure you want to do this?

613
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,358
I started this war.

614
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,071
Helen. . .

615
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,753
. . .sit with me.

616
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,678
Prepare to halt!

617
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,512
Prepare to halt!

618
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,353
Halt!

619
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,512
Move.

620
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,672
I see you're not hiding behind
your high walls. Valiant of you.

621
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,559
Ill-advised, but valiant.

622
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,315
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.

623
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,391
We've come too far, Prince Hector.

624
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,915
Prince? What prince?

625
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,799
What son of a king would accept
a man's hospitality. . .

626
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,112
. . .eat his food, drink his wine, then steal
his wife in the middle of the night?

627
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,431
The sun was shining
when your wife left you.

628
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,993
She's up there, watching,
isn't she? Good.

629
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,310
I want her to watch you die.

630
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,554
Not yet, brother.

631
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,278
Look around you, Hector.

632
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,876
I brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores.

633
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,951
You can still save Troy, young prince.

634
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,519
I have two wishes.

635
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,877
If you grant them,
no more of your people need die.

636
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,918
First, you must give Helen
back to my brother.

637
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,517
Second, Troy must submit
to my command. . .

638
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,274
. . .to fight for me whenever I call.

639
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,352
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble?

640
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,993
Well, I see them.

641
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:33,996
I see 50,000 men brought here
to fight for one man's greed.

642
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,079
Careful, boy.

643
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,998
My mercy has limits.

644
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,469
And I've seen the limits of your mercy.

645
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,918
And I tell you now, no son of Troy
will ever submit to a foreign ruler.

646
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,278
Then every son of Troy shall die.

647
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,991
There is another way.

648
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,556
I love Helen. I won't give her up
and neither will you.

649
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,952
So let us fight our own battle.

650
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,795
The winner takes Helen home.
And let that be the end of it.

651
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,396
A brave offer, but not enough.

652
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,512
Let me kill this little peacock.

653
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:21,231
I didn't come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.

654
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,550
I came for my honor.

655
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,075
His every breath insults me.

656
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,910
Let me kill him. When he's lying
in the dust, signal to attack.

657
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,117
You'll have your city.
I'll have my revenge.

658
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,839
So be it.

659
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,118
I accept your challenge. And tonight,
I'll drink to your bones.

660
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,317
-My lord.
-Back to the line!

661
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,550
Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.

662
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,519
Brother. . .

663
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,592
. . .if I fall, tell Helen-- Tell her--

664
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,432
I will.

665
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,591
Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he--

666
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,036
You think of your sword and his sword
and nothing else.

667
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,352
Get up.

668
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,358
Come on.

669
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,199
See the crows?

670
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,116
They never tasted prince before.

671
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,278
Is this what you left me for?!

672
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,032
Fight!

673
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,634
Fight me!

674
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,954
You coward!

675
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,348
Fight me!

676
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,795
We have a pact! Fight!

677
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,153
Fight him, son. Fight him.

678
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,949
-Fight me!
-The Trojans have violated the agreement!

679
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,554
Prepare for battle!

680
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,519
This is not honor!

681
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,109
This is not worthy of royalty!

682
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,478
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.

683
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,434
The fight is over.

684
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,670
The fight is not over.

685
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,478
Stand back, Prince Hector.

686
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,154
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.

687
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,594
He is my brother.

688
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,792
Paris!

689
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,238
Go!

690
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,552
Get inside, Paris!

691
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,354
Archers!

692
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,990
-Our men are too close to the walls.
-Pull back, you fool!

693
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,434
For Troy!

694
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,435
-Now!
-Loose!

695
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,033
Get them in line!

696
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,958
Get the men back into lines!

697
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,395
Front line, push!

698
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,553
Forward.

699
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,994
Forward!

700
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,834
Forward!

701
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,235
Apollonians! Now!

702
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,794
Prince Hector!

703
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,828
We need to retreat!

704
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,910
My army's never lost a battle yet!

705
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,469
You won't have an army
if you don't fall back!

706
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,350
Back to the ships!

707
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,158
-Back to the ships!
-Retreat!

708
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,309
-Back!
-Retreat!

709
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,118
Go back!

710
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,079
Back. Back to the ships!

711
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,953
Fall back!

712
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,714
-Men, fall back!
-Halt!

713
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,039
Halt!

714
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,679
But we have them on the run!

715
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,956
We're in range of their archers.

716
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,951
Have our men gather our fallen.

717
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,918
Send an emissary to them.
They can collect their dead.

718
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,469
Would they have done the same for us?

719
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,878
Go! Back!

720
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,318
Fall back into line!

721
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,552
You think I'm a coward.

722
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,358
I am a coward.

723
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,871
I knew he would kill me.

724
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,159
You were watching.

725
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,553
My father.

726
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,238
My brother.

727
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,995
All of Troy. Shame didn't matter.

728
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,437
I gave up my pride. . .

729
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,752
. . .my honor. . .

730
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,153
. . .just to live.

731
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,159
For love.

732
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,316
You challenged a great warrior.
That took courage.

733
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,118
I betrayed you.

734
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,710
Menelaus was a brave man.

735
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,757
He lived for fighting.

736
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,513
And every day I was with him, I wanted
to walk into the sea and drown.

737
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,631
I don't want a hero, my love.
I want a man I can grow old with.

738
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:29,714
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!

739
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,873
They think I'll sail home at first light.

740
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,359
Maybe we should.

741
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,715
Flee? Like a whipped dog?

742
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,350
The men believe we came here
for Menelaus' wife.

743
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,118
Won't be needing her anymore.

744
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,317
My brother's blood still wets the sand,
and you insult him!

745
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,040
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.

746
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,192
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.

747
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:56,638
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?

748
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,078
If we stay, we stay here
for the right reasons.

749
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,356
To protect Greece, not your pride.

750
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,080
Your private battle with Achilles
is destroying us.

751
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,514
Achilles is one man.

752
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,955
Hector is one man.

753
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,959
Look what he did to us today.

754
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,829
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!

755
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:20,636
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.

756
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,233
He's right.

757
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,913
The men's morale is weak.

758
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,790
Even if I could make peace with Achilles,
the man won't listen to me!

759
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,798
He's as likely to spear me
as to speak to me!

760
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,394
I'll talk to him.

761
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,959
He'll want the girl back.

762
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,759
He can have that damn girl.

763
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,194
I haven't touched her.

764
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,634
Where is she?

765
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,432
I gave her to the men.

766
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:51,511
They need some amusement after today.

767
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,635
Come on, give the bitch to me!

768
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,719
Who's first?

769
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,759
Trojan whore!

770
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,831
What's this? A virgin's robe?

771
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,038
-You won't be needing that much longer!
-Hold her.

772
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,556
Better to be a Spartan slave
than a Trojan--

773
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,676
Achilles!

774
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,872
Are you hurt?

775
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,110
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.

776
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:57,637
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.

777
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,593
Eat.

778
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,559
I've known men like you my whole life.

779
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,074
No, you haven't.

780
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,879
You think you're so different
from 1000 others?

781
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:41,389
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.

782
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,910
-And you hate these soldiers.
-I pity them.

783
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,394
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.

784
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,552
Perhaps they deserve
more than your pity.

785
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,952
Why did you choose this life?

786
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,588
-What life?
-To be a great warrior.

787
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,555
I chose nothing. I was born,
and this is what I am.

788
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,992
And you? Why did you choose
to love a god?

789
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,758
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.

790
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,792
Do you enjoy provoking me?

791
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,670
You've dedicated your life to the gods.

792
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,310
Zeus, god of thunder. Athena,
goddess of wisdom. You serve them.

793
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,914
-Yes, of course.
-And Ares, god of war?

794
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,958
Who blankets his bed with the skin
of men he's killed?

795
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,319
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

796
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,553
I'll tell you a secret. . .

797
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,680
. . .something they don't teach you
in your temple.

798
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,035
The gods envy us.

799
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,750
They envy us because we're mortal.

800
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,958
Because any moment might be our last.

801
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,391
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

802
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,398
You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

803
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,192
We will never be here again.

804
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,231
I thought you were a dumb brute.

805
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,591
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.

806
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,114
Do it.

807
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,799
Nothing is easier.

808
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,234
Aren't you afraid?

809
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,791
Everyone dies. Today or 50 years
from now. What does it matter?

810
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,118
Do it.

811
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,710
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.

812
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,393
Many.

813
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,633
My lord, there's--

814
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,509
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We're going home.

815
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,992
Gather the stores.

816
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,109
Agamemnon is a proud man.

817
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,469
But he knows
when he's made a mistake.

818
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,790
The man sends you
to make his apologies?

819
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,434
What are you doing enthralled
to that pig of a king?

820
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,595
The world seems simple to you,
my friend. . .

821
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:28,116
. . .but when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.

822
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,759
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy
like Agamemnon.

823
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,512
Are we supposed to fear him?

824
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:39,356
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem. Fear is useful.

825
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,833
We need you back.

826
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,758
Greece needs you.

827
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,119
Greece got along fine before I was born.

828
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,430
Greece will be Greece
long after I'm dead.

829
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,551
I'm not talking about the land.

830
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,836
The men need you.

831
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,679
Stay, Achilles.

832
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,278
You were born for this war.

833
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,638
Things are less simple today.

834
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,633
Women have a way
of complicating things.

835
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,357
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.

836
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,511
But in this war, you're a servant.

837
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,672
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

838
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:30,873
I hope you understand that one day.

839
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,677
We're going home?

840
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,239
We sail in the morning.

841
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,710
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can't just sail away.

842
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,634
If it's fighting you still long for,
there will always be another war.

843
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,074
These are our countrymen.

844
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,118
You betray all of Greece
just to see Agamemnon fall.

845
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,272
Someone has to lose.

846
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,119
The gods favor our cause.

847
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,238
Now is the time to destroy
the Greek army.

848
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,909
Their morale is battered.

849
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,117
Hit them now. Hit them hard.

850
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,032
And they will run.

851
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,915
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday.

852
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,798
There must be dissension
among the Greeks.

853
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,520
But if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

854
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,111
If they decide to attack us, let them.

855
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,113
Our walls can't be breached.
We'll beat them back again.

856
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,429
Yesterday, the Greeks
underestimated us.

857
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,396
We should not return the favor.

858
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,079
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

859
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,630
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo.

860
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,633
The gods have cursed the Greeks.

861
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,360
Prepare the army.
We attack at daybreak.

862
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,391
Am I still your captive?

863
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,673
You're my guest.

864
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,152
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

865
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,912
You should leave then.

866
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,511
Would you leave this all behind?

867
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,392
Would you leave Troy?

868
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,632
Hold those barricades!

869
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,517
Archers to the rear.

870
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,430
Achilles.

871
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,592
Achilles.

872
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,953
Now!

873
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,913
Forward!

874
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,833
Enough for one day.

875
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,672
Yes.

876
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,033
Back to the ships!

877
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,509
Back to the ships!

878
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,912
It was his cousin.

879
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,599
To Troy!

880
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:58,313
-Back to the city!
-Back to the city!

881
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,799
To Troy!

882
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,870
We were going to sail home today.

883
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,160
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.

884
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:28,637
Achilles.

885
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,117
You violated my command.

886
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:46,510
No, my lord. There was a mistake.

887
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:49,114
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.

888
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,316
You led them into combat.

889
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:58,239
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.

890
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:07,630
Where's Patroclus?

891
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,392
Patroclus!

892
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,710
We thought he was you, my lord.

893
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:18,956
He wore your armor, your shield,
your greaves, your helmet.

894
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,838
He even moved like you.

895
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,271
Where is he?

896
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,837
-Where?
-He's dead, my lord.

897
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,753
Hector cut his throat.

898
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,035
Don't!

899
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,272
Where are you taking me?

900
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,757
Do you remember how to get here?

901
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,872
Yes.

902
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,992
The next time you come here,
follow the tunnel.

903
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:36,232
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.

904
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,789
When you get to the end,
you'll be by the river.

905
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,269
Follow the river until you get
to Mount Ida.

906
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,032
Why are you telling me this?

907
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,551
-lf I die. . .
-No.

908
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:53,234
. . .I don't know how long
the city will stand.

909
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,994
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over.

910
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,391
They'll kill all the men, throw
the babies from the city walls.

911
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:01,835
-Please.
-The women, they'll take as slaves.

912
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,709
-That, for you, will be worse than dying.
-Why are you saying such things?

913
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,918
Because I want you to be ready.

914
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:13,673
I want you to get our boy,
and I want you to bring him here.

915
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:18,237
You save as many people as you can,
but you get here. And you run.

916
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,392
I killed a boy today.

917
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,832
And he was young.

918
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,712
He was much too young.

919
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,680
That boy has just saved this war for us.

920
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,670
-Eudorus.
-My lord.

921
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,512
I need my armor.

922
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:37,473
No.

923
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,994
Don't go!

924
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:42,756
Rope!

925
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:45,195
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.

926
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,397
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.

927
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,631
Please.

928
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,274
No.

929
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,231
Hector!

930
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,838
Hector!

931
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,317
Hector!

932
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,553
Hector!

933
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:40,117
Father. . .

934
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:42,555
. . .forgive me for any offenses.

935
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:46,470
I've served you as best as I could.

936
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,632
Hector!

937
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,035
May the gods be with you.

938
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,718
Hector.

939
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,237
No father ever had a better son.

940
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,153
Hector!

941
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,598
Apollo guard you, my prince.

942
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,913
You're the best man I know.

943
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,677
You're a prince of Troy.

944
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,879
I know you'll make me proud.

945
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,840
Hector!

946
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:04,230
Remember what I told you.

947
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,878
You don't have to go. You don't.

948
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,878
You remember what I told you.

949
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,749
Hector!

950
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:47,108
Hector!

951
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:01,120
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

952
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:04,439
I'll make a pact with you.

953
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,356
With the gods as our witnesses. . .

954
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:11,991
. . .let us pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral rituals.

955
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:15,038
There are no pacts
between lions and men.

956
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,915
Now you know who you're fighting.

957
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,799
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.

958
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:39,954
And I wish it had been you. But I gave
the dead boy the honor he deserved.

959
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:42,031
You gave him the honor of your sword.

960
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:45,751
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.

961
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,913
You'll wander the underworld, blind, deaf,
and dumb, and all the dead will know:

962
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,755
This is Hector, the fool who thought
he killed Achilles.

963
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,154
Get up, prince of Troy.

964
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:53,513
Get up. I won't let
a stone take my glory.

965
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:21,477
You lost your cousin.

966
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:24,992
Now you've taken mine.

967
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:29,878
When does it end?

968
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:33,472
It never ends.

969
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:29,873
Who are you?

970
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:35,672
I have endured what no one
on earth has endured before.

971
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:41,394
I kissed the hands of the man
who killed my son.

972
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:49,752
Priam?

973
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:52,399
How did you get in here?

974
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:56,348
I know my own country better
than the Greeks, I think.

975
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:02,995
You're a brave man.

976
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:08,957
I could have your head on a spit
in the blink of an eye.

977
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:12,949
Do you really think death
frightens me now?

978
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:17,108
I watched my eldest son die. . .

979
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:20,989
. . .watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

980
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,830
Give him back to me.

981
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:30,793
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.

982
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:34,236
Give him to me.

983
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,312
He killed my cousin.

984
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:38,391
He thought it was you.

985
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:43,474
How many cousins have you killed?

986
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,669
How many sons and fathers
and brothers and husbands?

987
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,349
How many, brave Achilles?

988
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:55,231
I knew your father.

989
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:58,550
He died before his time.

990
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:04,754
But he was lucky not to live long enough
to see his son fall.

991
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:12,000
You have taken everything from me.

992
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:15,759
My eldest son. . .

993
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,118
. . .heir to my throne. . .

994
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,437
. . .defender of my kingdom.

995
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:26,831
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.

996
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:31,277
But give me this small mercy.

997
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:36,955
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes. . .

998
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:40,157
. . .till the moment you closed them.

999
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:45,358
Let me wash his body.

1000
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:49,997
Let me say the prayers.

1001
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:55,876
Let me place two coins on his eyes
for the boatman.

1002
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,630
If I let you walk out of here. . .

1003
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:06,717
. . .if I let you take him. . .

1004
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:11,196
. . .it doesn't change anything.

1005
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:15,280
You're still my enemy in the morning.

1006
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:19,272
You're still my enemy tonight.

1007
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:23,716
But even enemies can show respect.

1008
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:43,999
I admire your courage.

1009
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,078
Meet me outside in a moment.

1010
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:35,878
We'll meet again soon, my brother.

1011
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,829
Your son was the best I've fought.

1012
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:01,480
In my country, the funeral games
last for 12 days.

1013
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,831
It is the same in my country.

1014
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,070
Then the prince will have that honor.

1015
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:09,596
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.

1016
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:16,799
Briseis?

1017
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:22,035
I thought you were dead.

1018
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,554
You are free.

1019
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:49,118
If I hurt you. . .

1020
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:53,350
. . .it's not what I wanted.

1021
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,879
Go.

1022
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:12,077
No one will stop you.
You have my word.

1023
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:14,398
Come, my girl.

1024
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:26,149
You're a far better king than the one
leading this army.

1025
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,357
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I
have to honor it? What treason is this?

1026
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:50,559
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.

1027
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:52,756
Peace!

1028
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:55,634
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.

1029
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:57,552
This is the time to attack!

1030
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:01,679
Even with Hector gone, we have
no way to breach their walls.

1031
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,434
I will smash their walls to the ground. . .

1032
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:07,068
. . .if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.

1033
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:09,754
Hear me, Zeus!

1034
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:14,152
I will smash their walls to the ground.

1035
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:27,993
That's good.

1036
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:30,191
For my son back home.

1037
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:56,199
Well, Odysseus.

1038
02:07:57,160 --> 02:08:01,631
You found a way to make the sheep
invite the wolves to dinner.

1039
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:20,155
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.

1040
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:24,358
You've been a loyal friend all your life.

1041
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:28,480
I hope I never disappoint you again.

1042
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,189
It's I who have been the disappointment.

1043
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:35,360
Rouse the men.
You're taking them home.

1044
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,592
Aren't you coming with us?

1045
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:40,476
I have my own battle to fight.

1046
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,552
Let me march beside you.

1047
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:46,793
No. I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

1048
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,992
It's a beautiful night.

1049
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:57,837
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.

1050
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:06,312
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

1051
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:14,632
Open the gates!

1052
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:29,992
Here.

1053
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,872
Plague.

1054
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:59,988
Don't go too close, my king.

1055
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,710
This is the will of the gods.

1056
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:04,871
They desecrated the temple of Apollo. . .

1057
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,713
. . .and Apollo desecrated their flesh.

1058
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:11,668
They thought they could come here
and sack our city in a day.

1059
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:15,515
Now look at them,
fleeing across the Aegean.

1060
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:20,638
What is this?

1061
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:25,476
An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks
are praying for a safe return home.

1062
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:30,470
This is a gift. We should take it
to the temple of Poseidon.

1063
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:32,871
-I think we should burn it.
-Burn it?

1064
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:35,196
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.

1065
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,789
Father, burn it.

1066
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:37,639
Look at them.

1067
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:41,435
You'd think their prince had never died.

1068
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:45,511
You are the prince now.

1069
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:48,196
Make your brother proud.

1070
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:18,512
Briseis. Where is she?

1071
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:20,830
-Where?
-I don't know.

1072
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,672
Please. I have a son.

1073
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:25,475
Then get him out of Troy.

1074
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:40,954
Briseis!

1075
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:26,638
Paris! Andromache!

1076
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,752
Helen. We must go.

1077
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:31,672
-Where?
-I'll show you. Now. Hurry.

1078
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:33,558
Paris.

1079
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:36,154
It's a long way. Quick. We must go now.

1080
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:37,878
Briseis!

1081
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:42,638
Paris!

1082
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:56,952
Let it burn!

1083
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:59,350
Let Troy burn!

1084
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:02,717
Burn it! Burn it all!

1085
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:05,237
Burn Troy!

1086
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:07,915
Burn Troy!

1087
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:10,596
It's a long way. Quick.

1088
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:15,833
-Come.
-I stay.

1089
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,150
-No.
-My father will never abandon the city.

1090
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:19,639
I can't leave him.

1091
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:23,156
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.

1092
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,710
-What's your name?
-Aeneas.

1093
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:29,758
-Do you know how to use a sword?
-Yes.

1094
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,831
The sword of Troy.

1095
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,390
As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan,
our people have a future.

1096
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:38,028
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.

1097
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:39,832
-I will.
-Hurry.

1098
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:43,029
Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.

1099
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:44,633
I'll find her.

1100
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:48,552
Go.

1101
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,872
-I'll stay with you.
-Go.

1102
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:52,359
Please don't leave me.

1103
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:54,431
How could you love me if I ran now?

1104
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:59,037
We will be together again, in this world
or the next. We will be together.

1105
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:06,798
Go.

1106
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:12,310
To the gate!

1107
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:25,031
Soldiers of Troy. . .

1108
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:27,515
. . .you men are warriors!

1109
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:30,240
To lead you has been my honor!

1110
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:33,550
My prince!

1111
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:36,437
The boatman waits for us.

1112
02:19:36,640 --> 02:19:39,996
I say we make him wait a little longer!

1113
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,153
Paris!

1114
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,517
Paris!

1115
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:41,391
Have you no honor?

1116
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:43,958
Have you no honor?

1117
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:16,834
Too late for prayer, priestess.

1118
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:27,990
I almost lost this war
because of your little romance.

1119
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:43,194
You'll be my slave in Mycenae.

1120
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:47,512
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.

1121
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:50,754
And at night. . . .

1122
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,392
Get up!

1123
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:10,357
Hold her.

1124
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:19,434
Come with me.

1125
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,479
No!

1126

Paris!

No!

1128
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:50,078
Stop! Please!

1129
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:57,630
Paris! Don't!

1130
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:23,873
It's all right.

1131
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:26,277
It's all right.

1132
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,877
You gave me peace. . .

1133
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,596
. . .in a lifetime of war.

1134
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:53,273
Briseis, come.

1135
02:23:53,480 --> 02:23:54,913
Go.

02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:57,194
You must.

1137
02:23:57,640 --> 02:23:59,073
No.

1138
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:00,992
Troy is falling.

1139
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:03,312
Go.

1140
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:09,757
We must go. I know a way out.

1141
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:15,114
It's all right.

1142
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,158
Go.

1143

. . .my brother.

1147
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:14,997
If they ever tell my story, let them say...

1148
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:17,549
...I walked with giants.

1149
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:21,510
Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...

1150
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:24,075
...but these names will never die.

1151
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:29,510
Let them say I lived
in the time of Hector...

1152
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:31,716
... tamer of horses.

1153
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:33,951
Let them say...

1154
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:37,635
...I lived in the time of Achilles.
