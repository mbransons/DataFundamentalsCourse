1
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,607
Hey, watch it.

2
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:36,463
Oh, come on.

3
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:45,767
Hey, Mike!

4
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,569
- Hey, Larry.
- How you doing?

5
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:49,938
Have you seen Nicky?

6
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,672
I'm pretty sure he went with Erica.
It was half day today.

7
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:55,043
Parent Career Day.

8
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,414
- Hey.
- Hey. Come on in.

9
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:07,619
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

10
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:10,087
Why didn't anybody tell me
it was Career Day?

11
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:12,529
What do you mean?
Nicky said he was gonna tell you.

12
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:16,495
Oh, okay, I guess he forgot.

13
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,004
There he is. How are you, Larry?

14
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,199
Good. How are you doing, Don?

15
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:23,544
Good.

16
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,376
Can you believe this weather?

17
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:32,349
Chilly, right? Chilly, chilly,
Chilly Willy the penguin.

18
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:37,888
Leave me alone. Hey, why don't I go tell
the little corncob you're here.

19
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,257
Great. Great, that's great. Yeah, thanks.

20
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:46,063
Wow, your fiance really manages
to squeeze a lot onto that belt.

21
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,565
- Stop it.
- What?

22
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:50,671
What? No, it's like he's...

23
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,500
...the Batman of stockbrokers.

24
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:55,643
- Bond trader.
- Bond trader. Sorry.

25
00:04:55,811 --> 00:05:00,180
Hey, how's it going with that virtual-reality
driving range that you wanted to open?

26
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:03,409
Getting there, still waiting for
the technology to catch up.

27
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,815
It's not easy,
there are a lot of moving parts.

28
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:10,422
Hey, do you think Nick
would like Queens?

29
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:14,084
Oh, no, Larry. You didn't get evicted again,
did you?

30
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:16,358
I didn't...

31
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:19,523
...get evicted. I didn't get evicted, no.
I mean, I didn't...

32
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:22,727
- No, I didn't get evicted yet. It's like--
- Larry, listen to me.

33
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:24,769
I don't know how much more
Nicky can take.

34
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,568
Every couple months, it's a new career,
a new apartment.

35
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:31,008
If it wasn't for Nicky, I wouldn't
say anything, I would stay out of it.

36
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,875
It's just, it's too much instability.
It's not good for him.

37
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:36,573
I'm trying to figure things out
right now, okay?

38
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:42,846
You know...

39
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,519
...I don't think that Nicky
should stay with you.

40
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:50,256
- What?
- Just until you get really settled.

41
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,825
Hey, Dad.

42
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:56,061
- Hey, ready to carve it up?
- Cool.

43
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:04,539
All right, good!
Take it, Nicky! Break away!

44
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,275
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Nicky! Are you all right?

45
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:15,815
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Would you get off the ice?

46
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:18,425
Listen. Their left defenseman
is a very weak skater.

47
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:21,426
So you go left side, you got
a clear shot at the goal. Okay?

48
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:23,757
- Cool, thanks.
- All right, man.

49
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:29,869
We're good here. We're good.
All right. As you were, skaters.

50
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:32,168
Game on!

51
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:34,899
I'm good.

52
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:37,340
I'm telling you,
you tore it up out there today.

53
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:40,003
Thinking the NHL is a serious possibility.

54
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:43,515
I don't really wanna be
a hockey player anymore.

55
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:48,782
- All right. What do you wanna be?
- A bond trader.

56
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:50,886
A bond trader?

57
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:54,995
Yeah, it's what Don does.
He took me to his office last week.

58
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:57,128
That's cool.

59
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:59,961
So you wanna dress up
in a monkey suit and tie every day?

60
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:03,002
Like an automaton robot?

61
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:06,872
Trust me, you can't play hockey
in a cubicle. Kind of awkward.

62
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:09,369
Well, he's got a pretty big office.

63
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:12,445
That's not the point.
Come on, you love hockey.

64
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:15,742
I still like it,
but bond trading's my fallback.

65
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,680
Your fallback?

66
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:20,617
Wait a minute. You're too young
to have a fallback, okay?

67
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,724
And also, where did you ever
even hear that word?

68
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:26,952
Mom was talking to Don
about all your different schemes.

69
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:28,493
She called them schemes?

70
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:31,564
She said it was time
you found a fallback.

71
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,234
Are you really moving again?

72
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:42,606
I don't know. We'll see. I mean...

73
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:45,211
...there's some pretty cool places
out in Queens.

74
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,974
- Yeah.
- Hey.

75
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:50,845
Hey, Nicky, look at me.

76
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:53,517
Look at me, man.
I wanna tell you something.

77
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:56,919
I know that things have been kind of
up and down for me lately...

78
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:58,855
...and that's been hard for you.

79
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,957
But I really feel like my moment's coming
and when it does...

80
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,122
...everything's just gonna come together,
you know?

81
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,562
What if you're wrong...

82
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:10,330
...and you're just an ordinary guy
who should get a job?

83
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,342
All right, well...

84
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:23,750
You know what,
we'll figure it out, okay?

85
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,884
All right? Come on,
let's get you back to Mom's.

86
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:38,628
Mr. Daley, I can honestly say,
in 43 years at this agency...

87
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,530
...I've never seen a resume
quite like yours.

88
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:43,832
All right.

89
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:47,605
That wasn't a compliment.

90
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:50,074
It says here you were the CEO...

91
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:52,770
...of Snaptime lndustries.

92
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:54,472
Care to elaborate on that?

93
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:59,586
Sure. Well, that was the umbrella
corporation for my invention, the Snapper.

94
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:03,281
You know, you snap, the lights come on.
Snap, they come off.

95
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,086
Didn't they already make that?

96
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:11,025
No, no, that's the Clapper,
which, obviously...

97
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,826
...stole a bit of our thunder.

98
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:16,402
Personally, I don't really see
what the big difference is, I mean:

99
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,971
You know, whatever, but...

100
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,442
...apparently there is a significant portion
of the population that has trouble actually...

101
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:27,605
- ...snapping.
- Clapping's easier.

102
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,542
Debatable.

103
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:32,715
I can't help you.

104
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:34,682
Debbie?

105
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:36,619
Can I call you Debbie? Because...

106
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,089
...I felt a connection
when I entered this office...

107
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,626
...and I don't know,
I feel like you did too.

108
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:44,725
I didn't feel a connection.

109
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:48,699
Look.

110
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:53,569
I need a job tomorrow, okay?

111
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,607
If I don't have one...

112
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,575
Well, I just need it, okay?

113
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,111
Well, I don't know.

114
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,681
I might have one thing.

115
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:08,351
They've turned down everyone
I've sent over there, but--

116
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:09,990
Great.

117
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,189
-- who knows?

118
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,192
You might get lucky.

119
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:51,525
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

120
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,364
I'm Larry Daley. I've got a job interview
with Cecil Fredricks.

121
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:59,965
- Right. He should still be in his office.
- Great.

122
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:03,599
- I'm Rebecca Hutman. I'm a docent here.
- Hi.

123
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:07,043
- Let me point you in the right direction.
- Great.

124
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,612
Teddy Roosevelt, right?

125
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:14,448
- Yes, a great visionary.
- Yes, definitely.

126
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,681
He was our 4th president, right?

127
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,088
- Twenty-sixth.
- Twenty-sixth.

128
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,229
Please don't touch the exhibits!
I mean...

129
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:23,694
Riffraff.

130
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:27,158
Miss Hutman.
I cannot tolerate this type of chaos.

131
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:30,532
I mean, this is a museum, not a...

132
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,838
Do you know what "museum" means?

133
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:38,507
It doesn't mean,
"Daddy, it's a big Tyrannosaurus thing.

134
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,308
Can I touch its leg? " No!

135
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,414
Work it out, please.

136
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,349
- Will do, sir.
- Thank you.

137
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:48,982
Dr. McPhee, the museum director.

138
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:50,954
Seems like a fun guy.

139
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:54,152
Control your young, please. Can we?

140
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,037
Hello? Just kidding.

141
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,839
Hi. I'm Larry Daley.
Are you Mr. Fredricks?

142
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:15,175
Mr. Fredricks was my father.

143
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,683
I am Cecil. Good to meet you, Larry.
Nice firm handshake.

144
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:22,380
I like that. Tells a lot about a man.
Come on in.

145
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:29,629
Let's talk turkey here.

146
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:35,161
The museum is losing money,
hand over fist.

147
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:39,636
I guess kids today don't care about
wax figures or stuffed animals.

148
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:43,805
So they're downsizing,
which is code for firing...

149
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:45,946
...myself and the other two night guards.

150
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:48,407
They want to replace us
with one new guard.

151
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:52,110
- Oh, sorry.
- Well, what are you gonna do?

152
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:55,848
I'd like you to meet
my two colleagues here.

153
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:58,458
Reginald? Gus?

154
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,220
Where is he? I'll beat him with my fist!

155
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:06,693
Gus, this is Larry Daley, the kid who
wants to be the new night guard.

156
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:09,358
Night guard?

157
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:12,700
No, the lady at the agency said
this was a museum position.

158
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:16,002
Most important position
in the museum, Larry.

159
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,974
He looks like a weirdie.

160
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:21,146
Wonderful guard, terrible people skills.

161
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:24,649
Now, listen, lunch box.
Don't try anything funny.

162
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:28,016
I once went nine rounds
with John L. Sullivan.

163
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:30,986
You never fought John L. Sullivan
in your life.

164
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,753
Gentlemen, we have
a job candidate here.

165
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:36,453
He's got an excellent resume,
a winning attitude...

166
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:38,997
...and I say let's give him a shot.
What do you say?

167
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:43,228
Hang on a sec. I think I might wanna
have a little time just to think it over.

168
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:46,669
Do you want the job or not, snack shack?

169
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:52,945
- No, no, I want the job--
- Welcome to the night guards, Larry.

170
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,941
Larry, meet me up on the second floor.

171
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:59,883
I'll slip into my orthopedics and
give you a little tour. Arthritic knees.

172
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:04,054
Not fun getting old, my friend. Go on.

173
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:12,398
You really think he's the one?

174
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:15,563
Oh, yes.

175
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:17,671
He's the one.

176
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:34,844
Gotta keep it moving, Larry.
I'm pretty spry for an old man.

177
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:38,186
This is the Diorama Room.

178
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,350
Oh, yeah.

179
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:45,563
I remember these little guys. Cute.

180
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,836
Cecil!

181
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,767
Hey, Cecil!

182
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:10,447
- Did I get you good?
- Yeah.

183
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,957
You got me.

184
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:21,430
Seriously, though, no fooling around
in here. This stuff is really old.

185
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:26,630
All right, then. As you can see,
it's pretty quiet in here these days.

186
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:30,535
On the left there is your Attila the Hun.

187
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:35,042
And here we have our Easter lsland head.

188
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,414
Hey, Cecil.

189
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:44,983
And this, of course,
is the Hall of African Mammals.

190
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,525
Ah, yes.

191
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:51,955
Monkeys. I love monkeys.

192
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:55,129
- Yeah.
- Guy's cute.

193
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:59,103
Yeah, we call him Dexter.
He's quite a little...

194
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:02,003
...ball of fun, aren't you, Dexter?

195
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:06,408
Moving on.

196
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:13,384
And, finally, this is the temple
of the Pharaoh Ahkmenrah.

197
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:20,355
And in that tomb right down there,
the pharaoh himself.

198
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:21,825
Neat.

199
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,191
And hanging on the wall behind him...

200
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:29,803
...was his most prized possession,
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

201
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:33,538
Twenty-four-carat gold.
It's worth a fortune.

202
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,437
Very cool.

203
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,237
It is indeed, Larry.

204
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:40,246
Very cool.

205
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:48,482
All right. Report here at 5 tomorrow.
We'll walk you through your duties.

206
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:50,521
Okay, 5. I'll be here.

207
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:52,591
Moving on.

208
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:57,156
Hey, it's me. So I got a job.

209
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:59,663
Larry, that's great. What is it?

210
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:02,997
It's a job...

211
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:06,436
...at the Museum of Natural History.

212
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:09,235
Yeah, so you can tell Nicky
that we won't be moving.

213
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,638
Larry, this is good news.

214
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:13,474
Yeah, no, definitely.
So I'll see you tomorrow?

215
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:16,116
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

216
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,859
Larry?

217
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:29,991
Your keys. Your torch.

218
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:32,962
- Right.
- You'll wanna strap those to your belt.

219
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,398
It can get a little spooky
around here at night...

220
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,061
...so you might wanna
put a few lights on.

221
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:42,134
All right, flashlight, keys.
What am I for-- ?

222
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:46,643
The instruction manual.

223
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:48,076
Instructions.

224
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:51,480
You start with one, two, three...

225
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:52,983
Four?

226
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,951
Are you cracking wise?

227
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:58,024
I ought to punch you
in the nose, hopscotch.

228
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:01,184
Leave him alone, Gus.
You got it covered, right, Larry?

229
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,489
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

230
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:06,064
- You better get it!
- Gus.

231
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:09,726
Larry, do them in order,
do them all and do them quick.

232
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:15,103
And the most important thing of all
to remember: Don't let anything in or out.

233
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:16,504
Out?

234
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:18,372
Good luck, son.

235
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:21,447
- Night, Gus.
- Young buck. Cracking wise.

236
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:23,243
Moving on.

237
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:59,710
Hello?

238
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,718
Hello!

239
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,618
Check!

240
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,453
Check.

241
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:10,153
I am Larry.

242
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:14,324
Check! Larry! Larry.

243
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:22,108
Monday! Monday! Monday!

244
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:24,836
Monster Truck Rally.

245
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:47,590
Cecil?

246
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:53,525
Okay, very funny, Cecil!

247
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:57,961
What is this, like a
David Copperfield thing?

248
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,412
This is weird.

249
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:18,787
Cecil?

250
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:13,139
Come on. Revolve. Revolve!

251
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:28,995
- Name, please?
- Cecil...

252
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:32,998
- ...Fredricks!
- One moment. Connecting.

253
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,226
- Hello.
- Cecil! It's Larry Daley!

254
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:37,394
Larry. Yes, how can I help you?

255
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:40,199
The dinosaur-- The dinosaur is alive!

256
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:42,501
I'm having a little trouble
hearing you, friend.

257
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:43,973
Tequila.

258
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:45,942
The dinosaur's alive!

259
00:22:46,113 --> 00:22:47,546
What do I do?
Tell me what to do!

260
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:50,878
Read the instructions.
It explains everything.

261
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:54,582
Okay, I got them!

262
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:57,648
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Wait! What-- ?

263
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:08,895
What bone?

264
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:08,490
Fetch?

265
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,795
Play fetch?

266
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:38,688
No way.

267
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,194
- Dum-dum.
- Yes?

268
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:54,398
- You give me gum-gum.
- I give you gum-gum?

269
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:57,567
You new dum-dum.
You give me gum-gum.

270
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:01,412
Okay, you know what?
I have no gum-gum. Sorry.

271
00:25:01,582 --> 00:25:03,447
And my name isn't dum-dum,
my name's Larry.

272
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:06,245
No, your name dum-dum.

273
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:10,523
Oh, you in trouble, dum-dum.

274
00:25:10,691 --> 00:25:13,524
You'd better run-run
from Attila the Hun-Hun.

275
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:19,360
See you later, dum-dum.

276
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:57,461
What is happening?

277
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:38,675
Hey.

278
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:41,437
How you doing?

279
00:26:44,652 --> 00:26:46,210
Are you...?

280
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:48,283
You're...

281
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:51,317
..."Sakagahwahwaya"?

282
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:52,959
You're "Sakagawaya"?

283
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,958
Oh, Sakagawea. You're Sakagawea?

284
00:26:56,563 --> 00:26:59,225
The glass. I can't...

285
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,958
...hear you.

286
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:04,695
You can't...? You can't hear me?

287
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:07,340
Excuse me.
"Who assisted the Lewis and Clark-- "

288
00:27:07,641 --> 00:27:10,838
Right, so that's Lewis and Clark
and you're... Right.

289
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:13,138
You seem-- I'm Larry.

290
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:17,214
What's going on? What's-- ?
Do you know what's going on here?

291
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:21,144
Huns. I gotta--

292
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:08,965
Hey. Hi.

293
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:11,536
Tin Man. Hey. Hi. How you doing?

294
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:14,868
I'm new. It says I'm supposed to
lock up the lions or they'll eat me.

295
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:19,574
You're Galileo? No?

296
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:42,901
Okay...

297
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:44,900
Hey, I'm the...

298
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:51,010
Hi. I'm the new guy
and I'm just locking up, so...

299
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:56,438
If it's cool with you
I'm just gonna get my paperwork...

300
00:28:57,985 --> 00:28:59,782
...and be out of your hair, okay?

301
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:59,809
"Double-check your belt.
The monkey probably stole your keys."

302
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,675
Monkey.

303
00:30:04,484 --> 00:30:08,420
Hey. Hey there. Hi.
What's your name? Your name is...

304
00:30:09,189 --> 00:30:11,419
No, no, no. Come back. Come back.

305
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,560
Dewey? Is that your name, Dewey?

306
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:17,686
No, no, no. What's-- ? Dewey?
Dexter? Dexter. Dexter, right?

307
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:20,060
Hey, Dexter,
you wanna give me those keys?

308
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:22,464
I just want to lock up.

309
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:24,763
Yes. Oh, good. Come to Papa.

310
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:29,602
Oh, thank you. Can I have those keys?
Oh, good. What a good boy.

311
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:31,710
That's okay. Oh, thank you.

312
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:35,713
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Thank you very, very much.

313
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,602
Bad monkey. Stop that.

314
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:02,867
That's not right. Are you done?

315
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:06,705
Do you have an issue with me?
Do you have an issue with me?

316
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,940
Because if I have a problem with somebody,
I don't pee on them, okay?

317
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:13,416
And also-- Let me tell you something.
These keys?

318
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:16,719
Hey. Dexter, that's not funny.
Give it back.

319
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,721
Dexter. Give--

320
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:24,925
Don't. I know what you're thinking.
Don't do it. Not a good idea.

321
00:31:25,098 --> 00:31:26,656
Not-- Dexter, I need those.

322
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:30,562
Don't encourage him. You think
you're funny for your friends, huh?

323
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:33,797
You three guys-- What, he's the ringleader,
you're the audience?

324
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:35,669
Yeah, no. Don't do it, okay?

325
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:37,469
Lookit-- You!

326
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,490
Oh, this is not happening.

327
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,303
Oh, man.

328
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:31,292
What are you guys doing?

329
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:33,860
I can't feel my lip.

330
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:36,896
Oh, shit.

331
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:42,299
Man.

332
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:08,690
Hey. Hey.

333
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,395
Hey, stop that.

334
00:33:17,377 --> 00:33:19,208
Hog-tie him, boys.

335
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:24,441
- Get him, that big old Bocephus of a man.
- Hey, what are you doing?

336
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:26,950
Cinch him up good.
You ain't so big now, are you?

337
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,111
Hey. Hey, stop that.

338
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:35,453
Every night, year after year...

339
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:39,121
...one of you guards
locks us up in these boxes.

340
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,530
Well, I hereby say, sir, enough!

341
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:46,434
Fire up the iron horse, boys.

342
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:57,210
- Hey, blondie?
- Name's Jedediah.

343
00:33:57,384 --> 00:33:59,375
All right, Jedediah. Stop the train, please.

344
00:33:59,553 --> 00:34:03,148
- That's a big no-can-do, Cracker Jack.
- What's going on here, huh?

345
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:05,553
- Somebody's gotta pay.
- Pay for what?

346
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:10,560
I don't know. Just pay. Now, stop whining
and just take it like a man.

347
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:16,762
Seriously, stop the train.

348
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:19,770
- All right, stop the train.
- Thank you.

349
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:21,998
Now full speed ahead and ram him!

350
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:23,972
Split his head like a watermelon!

351
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,840
For crying out loud.

352
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:29,504
All right, that's enough.

353
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:32,481
We got a breach.

354
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,554
I got him. I got him. I got him, guys.
I got him--

355
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:52,760
- Oh, my...
- Prepare the catapults.

356
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:57,501
Octavius, hold on. This ain't your fight.
This here giant's on our land.

357
00:34:57,677 --> 00:35:00,168
Hey, little guy. Jed? Yeah.

358
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:03,282
Sorry, look. I just-- I'm not a giant.
I'm just an average-sized--

359
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,145
Don't talk down to me.

360
00:35:05,318 --> 00:35:08,344
I'm not a giant, guys. All right?
You guys are really little.

361
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:12,820
We may be small,
but our hearts are large...

362
00:35:12,993 --> 00:35:14,984
...metaphorically speaking.

363
00:35:15,162 --> 00:35:17,494
Don't take that wrong.
I'm saying you're miniatures.

364
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:20,565
Silence! The Roman Empire
knows no boundaries.

365
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:23,328
- Don't you do it, son.
- Do what?

366
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:24,902
- Octavius.
- Don't do what?

367
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:28,529
- Unleash hell!
- Don't--

368
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:41,081
Climb aboard, boy.

369
00:35:41,254 --> 00:35:43,347
Take the hand, son.

370
00:35:45,592 --> 00:35:46,923
Onboard.

371
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:52,430
That's right. You better run, boy.
You hear Jedediah?

372
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,059
That mustachioed horseman ain't always
gonna be there to protect you, you hear me?

373
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,598
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

374
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:03,640
Theodore Roosevelt,
26th president...

375
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,176
...of these United States of America
at your service.

376
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:11,243
Okay. I'm Larry Daley,
the new night guard.

377
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:17,251
Pleasure to me you, Lawrence Daley.
You'll have to excuse me, though.

378
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:19,955
The hunt is afoot.

379
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:22,793
Hunt's afoot.

380
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,863
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Could I ask you something?

381
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:29,092
- Yes, but just one question.
- All right.

382
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:32,466
Okay, why? Is it just some, like,
three-wishes kind of deal, or-- ?

383
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:37,506
Not at all. Self-reliance
is the key to a vigorous life.

384
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:41,875
A man must look inward to find
his own answers. How can I be of help?

385
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:45,575
I don't really know how to put this,
and please don't take it the wrong way...

386
00:36:45,852 --> 00:36:49,310
...but isn't everything in this museum
supposed to be, you know...

387
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:51,047
- ...dead?
- Dead?

388
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:55,057
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

389
00:36:57,964 --> 00:36:59,522
Yell all you want, pharaoh.

390
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:03,658
You've been in there 54 years.
You're not getting out tonight.

391
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,734
There's the source of all this commotion.

392
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:10,137
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

393
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:14,905
Arrived here in 1952
from the Nile expedition.

394
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:21,284
On that night,
everything in this museum came to life.

395
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,945
And every night since.

396
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:31,897
So everything in the museum
comes to life every night?

397
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:33,555
Exactly.

398
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,762
And I'm supposed to do what?

399
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:42,033
You're the night watchman, Lawrence.
A venerable position in this institution.

400
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:47,106
- Come on, lad.
- All right. Okay. This is impossible.

401
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:50,112
Nothing's impossible.
If it can be dreamed, it can be done.

402
00:37:50,283 --> 00:37:53,275
Hence the 20-foot jackal staring at you.
Don't make eye contact.

403
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:56,820
Your job is to make sure that everyone
stays inside the museum...

404
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,618
...because if the sun rises
and anyone's on the outside...

405
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:01,852
...we turn to dust.

406
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:04,795
- You turn to dust?
- Dust.

407
00:38:04,964 --> 00:38:06,727
- Really?
- Really.

408
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:10,335
Now, it's almost dawn.
I shall help you restore order tonight.

409
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:14,064
But mark my words, it's the last time
I shall ever do so. Is that clear?

410
00:38:15,408 --> 00:38:18,673
Yeah. I mean-- I mean, I guess. I don't...

411
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:21,814
Stop babbling, boy! Yes or no?

412
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:23,642
- Yes.
- Good.

413
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:25,808
Let's ride.

414
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:39,362
All right. So the Hall of Reptiles is secure.

415
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:49,672
What are you looking at?

416
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:54,411
I'm tracking, dear boy.

417
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:58,414
Man's got to track.
Welcome to the family, Lawrence.

418
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:01,445
See you tomorrow night.

419
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:04,385
Actually, I gotta be honest.
I don't think I'm coming back.

420
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:06,821
What? You've only just begun.

421
00:39:06,993 --> 00:39:09,427
Yeah, well, this is not exactly what l--

422
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:10,790
- Lawrence?
- Yeah?

423
00:39:10,964 --> 00:39:13,091
What did you do
before you took this post?

424
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:17,362
Well, I've done a lot of different things.
I invented this thing called the Snapper.

425
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:19,129
Did you give up on that as well?

426
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:22,536
No, I just hit a few roadblocks.
You might have heard of The Clapper?

427
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:23,903
- Lawrence.
- Yes, sir?

428
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:29,515
Some men are born great.
Others have greatness thrust upon them.

429
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:33,716
For you, this is that very moment.

430
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,078
Bully. Got you, boy.

431
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:04,682
Yeah. You got me.

432
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:10,854
Say hello to your little friend.

433
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:14,355
- What are you doing?
- Put me down.

434
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:16,688
I don't like to be manhandled.

435
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:20,060
- Just calm down, Jed.
- lt doesn't feel good.

436
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:23,828
- lt makes me feel small and powerless.
- You done?

437
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:28,463
I'm gonna shoot you in your dang eye.
In your dadgum eye.

438
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:31,508
Yeah, keep shooting.
Nothing's gonna happen.

439
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:34,146
Now you know my shame.

440
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:39,809
Jedediah's impotent rage.
His guns don't fire. Take me away.

441
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,547
This ain't over.
You ain't seen the last of me.

442
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:44,781
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

443
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,516
Duck!

444
00:40:50,196 --> 00:40:52,357
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

445
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:54,022
This is not worth 11.50 an hour.

446
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,398
Look, the giant's scared.
There's a bigger giant running around.

447
00:41:35,408 --> 00:41:37,171
Hello.

448
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:38,901
Larry?

449
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:42,314
Larry?

450
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,953
Oh, don't do that.
We're too old for surprises.

451
00:41:51,124 --> 00:41:54,093
Really? I thought you liked surprises.
Like how you surprised me...

452
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,161
...with the fact everything in
the museum comes to life at night.

453
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,797
That little sweetheart.

454
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:01,525
We wanted to tell you.
You never would have believed us.

455
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:03,862
- You have any idea what I've been through?
- What?

456
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:08,269
- You have any idea what I've been through?
- Keep a lid on it, butterscotch.

457
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:12,036
I don't know if what happened last night
was real, but I didn't sign up for this.

458
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:16,238
I just need a regular job that
is not life-threatening and pays my bills.

459
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:20,113
So thank you very much
and I left my uniform in the office...

460
00:42:20,286 --> 00:42:22,652
- ...and I will be seeing you.
- Larry!

461
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:31,029
- Dad?
- Hey.

462
00:42:31,197 --> 00:42:33,495
Hey, buddy.
What are you guys doing here?

463
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:37,500
Oh, Erica had to be in court early,
so I'm taking Mr. Big Stuff here to school.

464
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,968
But he wanted to swing by,
see you in the new job.

465
00:42:41,307 --> 00:42:43,434
It's so awesome
that you're working here.

466
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,701
Hey, Niko, you wanna take
a little look-a-doo inside?

467
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:48,847
Maybe your dad will give you a VlP tour.

468
00:42:49,015 --> 00:42:51,449
You know what?
We're pretty slammed this morning.

469
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:56,146
Yeah, but Nicky, I promise,
I'll show you around soon, okay? Deal?

470
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:57,983
- Deal.
- All right.

471
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:00,148
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

472
00:43:00,326 --> 00:43:01,987
- Love you.
- Love you too, buddy.

473
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:03,958
Bye, now. All right.

474
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,487
Hey, Larry.

475
00:43:35,662 --> 00:43:38,130
So I was thinking
maybe I'll give it one more night.

476
00:43:38,297 --> 00:43:40,288
I'm glad you came around.
Welcome back.

477
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:43,560
You. New night guard, here, now.

478
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:53,939
- What's up?
- "What's up? "

479
00:43:54,113 --> 00:43:57,640
Oh, well, take a walk with me
and I'll show you, Mr. "What's up? "

480
00:43:57,817 --> 00:43:59,250
Come on.

481
00:44:00,753 --> 00:44:05,383
So would you kindly do me the favor
of explaining this?

482
00:44:09,095 --> 00:44:11,689
Okay. I'm guessing--

483
00:44:11,864 --> 00:44:16,528
And I'm just spitballing here,
but looks like that Roman dude got cocky...

484
00:44:16,703 --> 00:44:18,534
...and climbed over into the Wild West.

485
00:44:18,705 --> 00:44:21,833
And the cowboy knows Roman dude
wants to take over his territory...

486
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:24,499
...so he rounded up a posse
and put him in the stockade.

487
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:28,944
"Let's all laugh at me,
the comedy night guard."

488
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:31,907
"No" is the answer.

489
00:44:32,085 --> 00:44:35,543
Sarcasm back at you,
with your humor box.

490
00:44:36,355 --> 00:44:38,255
I wasn't laughing. Pretending to laugh...

491
00:44:38,424 --> 00:44:41,860
...if that's what you want,
some sort of battle of humor.

492
00:44:42,028 --> 00:44:43,461
Do you?

493
00:44:44,997 --> 00:44:46,430
No.

494
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,760
I don't want--
No, I don't want a battle of humor.

495
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:52,871
No, you don't,
because it would be a bloodbath.

496
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:55,464
Nothing funny about Little Bighorn.

497
00:44:58,177 --> 00:45:02,443
No. I find it about as funny
as a "fancist."

498
00:45:03,116 --> 00:45:08,179
It's not funny. Okay? And I will not
stand for this type of blatant...

499
00:45:09,622 --> 00:45:12,147
If I'm not clear, tell me.

500
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,891
Am I clear?

501
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:18,559
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

502
00:45:22,702 --> 00:45:24,033
Hey, Cecil?

503
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:28,068
You got an extra copy
of that instruction manual?

504
00:45:28,241 --> 00:45:32,337
Oh, no. I'm afraid not, Larry.
Listen, I'll tell you what you do.

505
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:35,072
Read some books.
Brush up on your history.

506
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:37,512
Helped me a lot when I first started out.

507
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:42,986
This museum was originally dedicated
to that man on the horse up there...

508
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:44,680
...President Theodore Roosevelt.

509
00:45:44,857 --> 00:45:48,918
He absolutely loved history and believed
that the more you know about the past...

510
00:45:49,095 --> 00:45:51,996
...the better prepared you are
for the future.

511
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:57,094
Okay, kids. Who can tell me
what this room's called?

512
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,670
Very good. The Hall of African Mammals.

513
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,672
Right here we have the king of the jungle,
the lion.

514
00:46:03,276 --> 00:46:07,372
Up ahead is one of my favorite creatures
in the whole museum, the capuchin monkey.

515
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:12,507
A highly intelligent primate
known for its loving and generous nature.

516
00:46:16,455 --> 00:46:17,786
Excuse me?

517
00:46:17,957 --> 00:46:20,949
I just thought that was...

518
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:23,823
I just was laughing in agreement.

519
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,795
Happy monkey.

520
00:46:29,602 --> 00:46:31,331
All right, kids. This way.

521
00:46:36,642 --> 00:46:38,769
Let me tell you something.
I'm not buying it.

522
00:46:38,945 --> 00:46:42,437
You might have them fooled,
you might have the kids fooled. Not me.

523
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:46,016
Can't get past me.
There's a storm coming, buddy.

524
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:47,675
There's a storm coming.

525
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:53,820
One of the most famous trackers
in history, Sakagawea was the woman...

526
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:57,257
...who led Lewis and Clark on
their expedition to find the Pacific Ocean.

527
00:46:57,429 --> 00:47:00,694
You guys have heard the saying,
"Actions speak louder than words."

528
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:02,891
And yet they wrote--

529
00:47:03,068 --> 00:47:05,798
- Yes, Mr. Daley?
- Yes. Was she deaf?

530
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:10,906
Was she deaf? No. She was not.
But she--

531
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:16,378
Yeah, because-- Just-- She does seem
a little bit sort of unresponsive.

532
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:18,175
That's because she's a statue.

533
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:24,118
Kids, could you give me one sec?
Go check her out. She's really cool.

534
00:47:26,158 --> 00:47:28,592
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna be here every night.

535
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,593
I wanted to learn a little bit more
about what I'm guarding.

536
00:47:31,763 --> 00:47:33,754
Actually, I've got a bunch of questions.

537
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:36,833
Maybe when you have a break,
could I buy you a cup of coffee?

538
00:47:37,002 --> 00:47:38,333
A cup of coffee?

539
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:40,733
Yeah, I mean, just purely a, you know...

540
00:47:40,906 --> 00:47:45,400
...colleague-to-colleague,
information-download sort of coffee.

541
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:48,502
I finish in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you outside.

542
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,170
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

543
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:53,147
- And have a good rest of your--
- All right. Okay, kids.

544
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:55,747
It was incredible what she did.

545
00:47:55,921 --> 00:47:59,118
She literally led these men
across rivers, up mountains...

546
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:02,852
...all with her newborn baby on her back.
She was the ultimate working mother.

547
00:48:03,028 --> 00:48:05,360
Wow, you are quite
the Sakagawean expert.

548
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,589
- Sakagawean.
- Sakagawean?

549
00:48:07,766 --> 00:48:12,032
Yeah. I should be, I've been writing
my dissertation on her for four years.

550
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:16,140
You've been working on one paper
for four years? That would drive me crazy.

551
00:48:16,308 --> 00:48:20,404
Actually, it's more like a 900-page book.

552
00:48:21,013 --> 00:48:24,972
So, what's your story? Have you
always wanted to be a security guard?

553
00:48:25,817 --> 00:48:29,014
- Oh, I didn't mean to--
- No, no, no.

554
00:48:29,187 --> 00:48:33,021
No, I'm divorced
and I have a 10-year-old son...

555
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:36,991
...so I needed to find
a more steady situation.

556
00:48:37,162 --> 00:48:40,188
Got it. So, what can I tell you
about the museum?

557
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:43,391
Okay, Attila the Hun.
What is that guy's problem?

558
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:46,628
Attila was considered the only
genuine threat to the Roman Empire.

559
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:50,072
" Known as the 'Scourge of God'...

560
00:48:50,242 --> 00:48:54,838
...Attila and his Huns would often
tear off the limbs of their helpless victims.

561
00:48:56,882 --> 00:48:59,214
Attila was famous
for his superstitious beliefs.

562
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:03,445
He surrounded himself with a phalanx
of sorcerers and magicians...

563
00:49:03,622 --> 00:49:06,853
...who advised and mystified him
with their dark arts."

564
00:49:59,544 --> 00:50:01,034
Larry?

565
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,007
Just wanted to say good luck, son.

566
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:05,773
And goodbye.
We're clocking out for the last time.

567
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,543
If you're ever in Boca, look us up.

568
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:10,916
Wait, you guys are going out of town?
What if this doesn't work out?

569
00:50:11,089 --> 00:50:13,614
Smart fellow like you? You'll be fine.

570
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:18,320
Yeah. We'll just be a phone call away.
Come on, walk us out.

571
00:50:18,497 --> 00:50:21,364
You fellas go ahead.

572
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:24,228
I need a moment.

573
00:50:24,402 --> 00:50:29,066
He's very emotional.
A lot of memories in this room.

574
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:27,424
Go crazy, big guy.

575
00:51:32,604 --> 00:51:34,265
Hey, guys.

576
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:36,407
Quest for fire...

577
00:51:36,908 --> 00:51:40,105
...over. Knock yourselves out.

578
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:43,278
Morning, dum-dum.

579
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:47,145
Me no dum-dum. You dum-dum.
You bring me gum-gum?

580
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:51,380
Yes, I did, fathead.
Lots and lots of gum-gum.

581
00:52:11,176 --> 00:52:16,307
What's that?
I can't hear you through the glass.

582
00:52:18,216 --> 00:52:19,808
Sorry.

583
00:52:20,418 --> 00:52:22,113
Heave.

584
00:52:22,587 --> 00:52:25,522
Heave. Heave.

585
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,250
Hey, what's going on over here?

586
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:30,758
We expand or we die.

587
00:52:31,062 --> 00:52:33,223
Heave.

588
00:52:33,398 --> 00:52:34,922
- Heave.
- On the count of three...

589
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,536
...you blow this anthill to kingdom come.

590
00:52:39,104 --> 00:52:42,505
- And a one and a two--
- Hey, Jed. Stop that.

591
00:52:42,674 --> 00:52:46,508
No, no. You blow a hole in your mountain,
all you're gonna hit is a wall.

592
00:52:46,678 --> 00:52:51,012
Step aside, Gigantor. We got us a railroad
to build. We're blowing a hole in that thing.

593
00:52:51,182 --> 00:52:54,515
Okay, first of all, enough with
the Gigantor giant stuff, okay?

594
00:52:54,686 --> 00:52:58,452
- I'm just trying to close up shop.
- We're gonna blow it anyway. And a three!

595
00:52:59,925 --> 00:53:03,520
Yeah. What are you doing?

596
00:53:03,828 --> 00:53:06,956
What's it look like we're doing?
It's manifest destiny.

597
00:53:07,132 --> 00:53:10,932
You can't fight it and neither can l.
Go! More dynamite.

598
00:53:11,136 --> 00:53:13,604
- Yeah, use it all.
- All right. Okay.

599
00:53:13,772 --> 00:53:16,434
Listen, "Octavus"? You gotta stop that.

600
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:18,542
It's Octavius, mary.

601
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,373
Okay, you know what? Fine. Great.
Here you go. This is what happens.

602
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:24,777
- You cannot do this. I am a Roman general.
- Sorry.

603
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,212
- I have rights.
- And you.

604
00:53:26,384 --> 00:53:28,875
- Hey, no! Put me down!
- Keep heaving, men.

605
00:53:29,054 --> 00:53:30,351
You can't stop progress!

606
00:53:30,522 --> 00:53:32,717
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?

607
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,892
I told you, I don't like to be manhandled.

608
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:39,656
No, I will manhandle you, Jedediah.
Now, listen, guys.

609
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:42,391
What is your problem, huh?
Why can't you just get along?

610
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:44,966
Look, we're men. We fight, okay?
That's what we do.

611
00:53:45,136 --> 00:53:46,728
It's kind of how we pass the time.

612
00:53:46,972 --> 00:53:51,272
You're, like, a giant. A freak, if you will.
We can't expect you to understand that.

613
00:53:51,443 --> 00:53:55,106
You got the whole room to run around in.
You don't have to be near each other.

614
00:53:55,714 --> 00:53:59,411
- What, you mean...?
- You're gonna let us out?

615
00:53:59,951 --> 00:54:02,317
What, and just roam free?

616
00:54:03,054 --> 00:54:05,614
Yeah. Yeah, I might,
if you promise to behave.

617
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,918
That means no fireballs,
no explosions, okay?

618
00:54:09,094 --> 00:54:10,322
You have my word, my liege.

619
00:54:10,495 --> 00:54:13,157
Yeah, no problemo, Gigantor.

620
00:54:13,331 --> 00:54:17,233
My name's Larry, first of all. Okay, Jed?

621
00:54:17,402 --> 00:54:20,132
So I call you Jed.
I don't call you Tiny, right?

622
00:54:20,305 --> 00:54:21,863
What's that supposed to mean?

623
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:27,637
- "Hey, Teeny." How does that sound?
- I don't like it. It hurts my feelings.

624
00:54:27,812 --> 00:54:30,542
"Gigantor" makes me feel
like some sort of freak, so...

625
00:54:30,715 --> 00:54:33,183
I don't. I just call you Larry.

626
00:54:33,351 --> 00:54:35,342
Don't be a kiss-ass, okay?

627
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,351
Look, I'm trusting you guys, all right?

628
00:54:37,522 --> 00:54:40,958
If you don't do what I say,
you can end up like the Mayan world there.

629
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:43,218
Locked up. Take a look.

630
00:54:43,395 --> 00:54:46,592
- Do they look happy?
- No.

631
00:54:47,832 --> 00:54:49,197
They look sad.

632
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:52,427
They can't do what they wanna do.
Now, I'm letting you guys...

633
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:55,835
...have a little bit of leash here.
Don't choke me with it, okay?

634
00:54:56,007 --> 00:55:00,171
I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay?
Okay. Good. Thanks.

635
00:55:01,913 --> 00:55:04,143
Hey, how's that gum treating you,
dum-dum?

636
00:55:04,315 --> 00:55:05,646
Good.

637
00:55:09,054 --> 00:55:11,852
Oh, hey, Dexter.
I'm just locking up. You want in?

638
00:55:13,525 --> 00:55:15,117
Yeah?

639
00:55:16,728 --> 00:55:18,320
All right.

640
00:55:24,302 --> 00:55:26,202
What's that? You got my keys?

641
00:55:28,807 --> 00:55:30,206
I don't think so.

642
00:55:32,143 --> 00:55:36,637
Looks like Uncle Larry pulled a fast one
on little Dexie.

643
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:38,806
Those are baby keys for a little baby.

644
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:41,178
Have fun with your baby keys,
little baby monkey.

645
00:55:41,352 --> 00:55:44,788
Tomorrow I'll bring you a little baby diapy
so you can go poo-poo in it.

646
00:55:44,956 --> 00:55:47,288
I'll give you a tickle
because you're a cute baby.

647
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:52,260
While you cry all night long
about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh?

648
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:54,755
I told you there was a storm coming.

649
00:56:02,173 --> 00:56:04,403
- Hey, Teddy.
- Lawrence.

650
00:56:04,576 --> 00:56:07,170
You impertinent pup.
I knew you'd come back.

651
00:56:07,412 --> 00:56:11,075
- You look like a man on a mission.
- Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot.

652
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,584
- You...?
- What?

653
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:25,058
- You checking her out?
- The nerve.

654
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:28,222
Checking her out.
I've never heard of such a thing.

655
00:56:28,399 --> 00:56:32,335
No, no, no. I'm just-- I mean
because, you know, she's very beautiful.

656
00:56:32,504 --> 00:56:34,233
- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

657
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:40,903
- Rather handsome woman, I suppose.
- Yeah.

658
00:56:41,346 --> 00:56:43,906
I don't know,
maybe you should go talk to her.

659
00:56:44,082 --> 00:56:46,676
- lndeed. Bless you, lad.
- Yeah. All right.

660
00:56:46,851 --> 00:56:49,718
- Carry on.
- Good. See you.

661
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:08,601
I...

662
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:57,982
Hey, hi.

663
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:02,285
No! It's okay!
It's okay. You guys speak English?

664
00:58:02,694 --> 00:58:03,820
No?

665
00:58:06,631 --> 00:58:08,326
Right. I don't know what that means...

666
00:58:08,499 --> 00:58:12,595
...and I know that you and I got off
on the wrong foot last night, but...

667
00:58:14,505 --> 00:58:19,169
...a little birdie told me
that somebody likes...

668
00:58:20,011 --> 00:58:21,239
...magic.

669
00:58:21,412 --> 00:58:24,347
- Magic?
- Magic.

670
00:58:25,183 --> 00:58:26,878
Sorcery.

671
00:58:27,185 --> 00:58:28,584
Ah, sorcer--

672
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:31,187
Yes. Illusion.

673
00:58:31,522 --> 00:58:33,012
Everybody likes magic.

674
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:37,150
And flowers. People like flowers.

675
00:58:37,328 --> 00:58:38,852
There you go. Those are for you.

676
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,590
You know what else people like?
Money.

677
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:46,135
The almighty dollar, right?
But money can sometimes...

678
00:58:47,038 --> 00:58:48,369
...disappear.

679
00:58:51,209 --> 00:58:53,200
At least that's what l...

680
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:55,139
...hear.

681
00:58:56,748 --> 00:59:00,479
No wonder you can't understand me.
You got a coin in your ear.

682
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:06,550
Check this out. Anybody need a hanky?

683
00:59:06,891 --> 00:59:11,225
Well, I wouldn't suggest this little
feller because he has a nasty habit...

684
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:14,061
...of vanishing...

685
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:18,135
...into thin air!

686
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,402
No, no. Don't. That defeats the-- Don't!

687
00:59:39,257 --> 00:59:43,591
Not the limbs. Guys, please,
do not tear the limbs.

688
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:01,942
Cortes, right?

689
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:19,190
How?

690
01:00:21,632 --> 01:00:24,499
You! Don't even think about it.
Don't you--

691
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,837
Dexter!

692
01:00:37,315 --> 01:00:38,805
Come on, guys!

693
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:05,800
Hey, guys!

694
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:12,505
Hey, guys. Hey, guys!

695
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:16,553
Sorry. What's going on?
What happened here?

696
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:18,052
I thought we had a deal.

697
01:01:18,222 --> 01:01:20,452
We will never coexist
with these buffoons.

698
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:22,559
We're past words, Laredo.

699
01:01:22,727 --> 01:01:25,787
Now it's time to let Smith & Wesson
do the talking!

700
01:01:25,963 --> 01:01:27,260
Those guns don't even work.

701
01:01:27,432 --> 01:01:29,696
They don't? Take a look at this.

702
01:01:32,804 --> 01:01:34,032
Dexter!

703
01:02:23,454 --> 01:02:24,716
Why?

704
01:02:31,596 --> 01:02:33,689
Ho! Dexter.

705
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:43,298
End of the line, cool breeze.

706
01:02:44,876 --> 01:02:46,309
End of the line.

707
01:03:04,629 --> 01:03:06,426
I am not playing games here.

708
01:03:10,635 --> 01:03:12,296
Just hand them over.

709
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:19,806
Easy. That's it, Dexter.

710
01:03:19,977 --> 01:03:22,138
Nice and easy, Dex. That's it.

711
01:03:44,335 --> 01:03:46,895
Good Lord, Lawrence!
Why are you slapping a monkey?

712
01:03:47,505 --> 01:03:50,804
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me,
and I'm sick of it!

713
01:03:51,008 --> 01:03:54,034
Poppycock. This little creature is
your primate brother.

714
01:03:54,211 --> 01:03:56,008
Without him, there's no us.

715
01:03:56,547 --> 01:03:57,844
Are you rabid?

716
01:03:58,049 --> 01:03:59,676
Wipe that off.

717
01:04:00,418 --> 01:04:03,046
You have to deal with this creature
with love and respect.

718
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,051
May I have the keys, dear friend?

719
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:08,924
Thank you. Lawrence?

720
01:04:11,028 --> 01:04:12,222
Well, you know what?

721
01:04:12,396 --> 01:04:15,490
You seem to know what you're doing,
so I'm gonna let you take over.

722
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:18,726
No, no. My dear boy, you can't put up
the white flag now.

723
01:04:18,903 --> 01:04:20,894
The museum is on the verge
of total anarchy.

724
01:04:21,072 --> 01:04:22,801
I tried! I came back tonight,
didn't l?

725
01:04:22,974 --> 01:04:26,341
Tried? That was one night. I didn't build
the Panama Canal in one day.

726
01:04:26,544 --> 01:04:29,707
That's great, but I'm dealing with
the most ridiculous job in history.

727
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,438
Some men are born great, Lawrence--

728
01:04:31,616 --> 01:04:34,050
Yeah, I know. Others have
greatness thrust upon them.

729
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:36,149
You hit me with that chestnut
last night.

730
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,845
The thing is, not everyone is great.

731
01:04:39,023 --> 01:04:41,617
That's the problem.
Some of us are just ordinary.

732
01:04:41,826 --> 01:04:44,454
No, you're not, Lawrence.
Stop wallowing in self-pity.

733
01:04:44,629 --> 01:04:46,324
Every journey begins with a footstep.

734
01:04:46,497 --> 01:04:49,762
Teach the inhabitants to get along,
they wouldn't need to be locked up.

735
01:04:49,934 --> 01:04:52,994
That means a lot coming from a guy
who's spent the last 50 years...

736
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,434
...spying on a girl he's never even
talked to.

737
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,232
I was going to make contact.
Lawrence, please.

738
01:05:00,077 --> 01:05:01,908
I'm done, all right?

739
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:09,481
No, Rexy! No!

740
01:05:41,118 --> 01:05:43,211
Oh, no.

741
01:06:46,517 --> 01:06:48,348
All right.

742
01:06:57,428 --> 01:07:01,228
No one comes here anymore. Besides,
I took this tour in second grade, Daley.

743
01:07:01,398 --> 01:07:03,798
I'm telling you,
my dad's gonna hook us up.

744
01:07:04,101 --> 01:07:06,399
- Mr. Daley?
- Yeah?

745
01:07:07,872 --> 01:07:09,772
- Foam.
- Yes, I know.

746
01:07:09,974 --> 01:07:11,271
In the Neanderthal display.

747
01:07:11,442 --> 01:07:14,411
There was an incident last night
with the fire extinguisher.

748
01:07:14,578 --> 01:07:16,205
I was on my way to go clean it up.

749
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,848
Okay, don't bother. You're fired.

750
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:22,846
I don't think we're getting a tour today.

751
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,045
Your dad just got canned, dude.

752
01:07:26,557 --> 01:07:28,582
Excuse me?

753
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:30,551
Mr. McPhee?

754
01:07:31,428 --> 01:07:32,861
Excuse me, Mr. McPhee?

755
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:35,362
Can I talk to you about this, please?

756
01:07:35,533 --> 01:07:36,659
- Sir?
- What?

757
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:39,735
I know I screwed up, but I finally
understand how to do this job.

758
01:07:39,904 --> 01:07:43,032
- You obviously don't.
- No, I didn't, but now I do.

759
01:07:43,207 --> 01:07:45,971
- Really, Mr. McPhee--
- Doctor.

760
01:07:46,777 --> 01:07:48,574
Dr. McPhee.

761
01:07:49,513 --> 01:07:51,413
Can you please give me one more night?

762
01:07:54,151 --> 01:07:56,346
- One more night.
- Okay, thank you.

763
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,853
And if anything is the tiniest...

764
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:02,786
...after your shift:

765
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:06,092
Because...

766
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:10,794
- Got it.
- Okay?

767
01:08:10,968 --> 01:08:14,699
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice...

768
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:22,841
Shame on me. Fool me--
Shame on me.

769
01:08:23,013 --> 01:08:25,481
- You.
- Fool me twice... Got it.

770
01:08:25,716 --> 01:08:28,412
- Take it or leave it.
- Okay. Thank you.

771
01:08:33,257 --> 01:08:34,451
- Hey.
- Hey.

772
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:37,753
- What's wrong?
- Maybe you should ask Nicky.

773
01:08:40,297 --> 01:08:43,027
Hey, buddy. What's going on?

774
01:08:43,634 --> 01:08:45,192
You got fired.

775
01:08:45,636 --> 01:08:47,797
What are you talking about?
I didn't get fired.

776
01:08:49,206 --> 01:08:53,040
I came to the museum this morning.
I saw your boss yelling at you.

777
01:08:53,978 --> 01:08:56,674
Why didn't you tell me?
Everything's fine.

778
01:08:56,847 --> 01:08:58,906
We just had a little misunderstanding.

779
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:00,482
Why?

780
01:09:01,852 --> 01:09:04,844
It's hard to explain.
I mean, you wouldn't bel--

781
01:09:06,123 --> 01:09:09,115
You know what? Let me show you.

782
01:09:09,526 --> 01:09:11,790
- Show me what?
- Come to work with me tonight.

783
01:09:11,962 --> 01:09:13,293
Larry?

784
01:09:13,464 --> 01:09:16,160
Can I talk to you for a second?

785
01:09:19,303 --> 01:09:20,600
Am I in trouble?

786
01:09:20,771 --> 01:09:22,534
Larry, what are you doing?

787
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,072
I just wanna show him what I do.
That's all.

788
01:09:25,242 --> 01:09:28,268
I love that you wanna share that
with him, but I gotta tell you...

789
01:09:28,445 --> 01:09:31,972
...I don't think Nicky has any room
in his heart for more disappointment.

790
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:34,942
He won't be disappointed.

791
01:09:35,686 --> 01:09:36,983
Larry.

792
01:09:37,554 --> 01:09:39,522
He won't be disappointed.

793
01:09:45,663 --> 01:09:48,530
Listen, hang out in the security
office till everyone's gone.

794
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:50,428
Then I'm gonna come get you.
All right?

795
01:10:10,454 --> 01:10:13,651
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you
to vacate the premises.

796
01:10:13,824 --> 01:10:15,121
- Hey there.
- Hey.

797
01:10:16,794 --> 01:10:19,922
- Good place to think, huh?
- Yeah. Definitely.

798
01:10:21,065 --> 01:10:23,556
So no big plans tonight?

799
01:10:23,734 --> 01:10:26,567
Yeah, no, I'm not really
a big-plan person.

800
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:29,668
I prefer hanging out with people
who are dead for 200 years.

801
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,467
It's the live ones that throw me.

802
01:10:31,642 --> 01:10:35,476
That's cool. Seriously though,
you do have to leave.

803
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,738
- Seriously?
- Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules.

804
01:10:37,915 --> 01:10:40,543
We're sort of locking everything up.

805
01:10:40,718 --> 01:10:43,915
You're really taking your job seriously.

806
01:10:44,088 --> 01:10:47,489
You know, once I clip on the tie,
I'm all business.

807
01:10:47,658 --> 01:10:48,852
- I get it.
- Yeah.

808
01:10:49,026 --> 01:10:50,857
How's that dissertation coming?

809
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:55,528
I've hit a dead end. I mean,
research can only get me so far.

810
01:10:55,699 --> 01:10:57,599
I'm never gonna know
who she really was.

811
01:10:58,268 --> 01:11:02,432
So I think it's time that I move on
to another subject.

812
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,735
I'll let you get back to work.

813
01:11:06,443 --> 01:11:09,970
- Good night, Larry.
- Yeah, okay.

814
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,011
Night.

815
01:11:19,123 --> 01:11:20,522
Hey.

816
01:11:22,126 --> 01:11:23,753
Rebecca!

817
01:11:26,296 --> 01:11:28,526
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Hey.

818
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:31,930
Hey. Listen, I don't think you should
give up on your paper.

819
01:11:32,136 --> 01:11:33,933
Okay. Why?

820
01:11:34,104 --> 01:11:36,868
All right, look, this is gonna
sound crazy, all right?

821
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:39,635
I mean, it's gonna sound, like,
really, really crazy.

822
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:42,506
- Okay.
- No, I mean insanely crazy.

823
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:44,306
- I can handle it.
- Okay.

824
01:11:45,315 --> 01:11:49,046
You know how they say in certain
museums, history comes alive?

825
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:52,086
- Yeah.
- ln this museum...

826
01:11:52,956 --> 01:11:54,480
...it actually does.

827
01:11:56,293 --> 01:11:57,920
What are you talking about?

828
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:06,836
Everything in this museum
comes to life at night.

829
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,468
- Really?
- Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you.

830
01:12:13,644 --> 01:12:15,771
You know that tablet?
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah?

831
01:12:15,946 --> 01:12:18,915
It actually brings things to life.
It's like some ancient spell.

832
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:21,813
Since the '50s, every night
everything's been coming to life.

833
01:12:21,985 --> 01:12:27,082
Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously.
The monkey, Dexter? The cute little--

834
01:12:27,257 --> 01:12:28,724
- What is he?
- Capuchin.

835
01:12:28,892 --> 01:12:32,191
A capuchin. Right. The capuchin.
He urinated on me and bit my nose.

836
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:37,066
And Sakagawea is in her case,
alive every night...

837
01:12:37,234 --> 01:12:39,429
...just listening to Lewis and Clark
argue.

838
01:12:39,603 --> 01:12:42,037
So if you really wanna get inside
her head...

839
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,305
...I can hook that up.

840
01:12:46,844 --> 01:12:48,106
That's cool.

841
01:12:48,278 --> 01:12:51,406
Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome.

842
01:12:54,785 --> 01:12:56,719
Make fun of the history geek.

843
01:12:57,688 --> 01:13:00,555
- No. Rebecca!
- Good night, Larry.

844
01:13:02,593 --> 01:13:05,391
No, I'm not making fun of you.
Rebecca.

845
01:13:16,373 --> 01:13:18,841
- Here you go. Best seat in the house.
- What's going on?

846
01:13:19,009 --> 01:13:21,569
If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy.
I'm gonna show you.

847
01:13:21,745 --> 01:13:25,272
- What?
- You'll see in about 20 seconds.

848
01:13:25,449 --> 01:13:27,280
- Okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex?
- Yeah.

849
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:29,919
Yeah? Well, I call him Rexy.

850
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:34,581
And he's about to come to life,
Nicholas, in...

851
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,954
...five, four, three, two...

852
01:13:49,106 --> 01:13:51,574
- Dad?
- Hang on a sec.

853
01:13:51,775 --> 01:13:55,142
Say hello to Rexy!

854
01:13:56,313 --> 01:13:57,405
Dad, are you okay?

855
01:13:59,783 --> 01:14:01,307
This is weird.

856
01:14:01,485 --> 01:14:03,612
Guys! Come on!

857
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:05,985
Sundown!

858
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:11,561
Hey, T.R., come on, rise and shine.
Buddy, I need you to wake up.

859
01:14:11,728 --> 01:14:13,821
Come on, my kid is here.
I need you to wake up.

860
01:14:13,997 --> 01:14:17,125
Texas? Texas! Come on!
Texas! Come on! Get on, Texas!

861
01:14:17,467 --> 01:14:19,196
Get on, Texas! Get up.

862
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:21,496
Just stop, okay?

863
01:14:21,672 --> 01:14:25,130
No, Nicky, I'm telling you,
there's this tablet, okay?

864
01:14:25,309 --> 01:14:27,402
Called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.
Every night--

865
01:14:27,578 --> 01:14:30,240
- Now there's a tablet?
- Yeah, there is.

866
01:14:30,414 --> 01:14:31,972
Come on, Dad.

867
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:35,044
Come on.

868
01:14:39,556 --> 01:14:41,490
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

869
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:45,116
The tablet. I think somebody stole it.

870
01:14:45,495 --> 01:14:47,190
Yeah, right.

871
01:14:47,497 --> 01:14:49,192
I'm not kidding, Nicky.

872
01:14:52,836 --> 01:14:54,201
Nicky?

873
01:14:56,139 --> 01:14:58,107
Hey, Nicky!

874
01:14:59,543 --> 01:15:02,307
Hey! Hey, Nicky! Where are you going?

875
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:05,414
- Home.
- What? Wait a minute.

876
01:15:09,886 --> 01:15:11,353
Come on.

877
01:15:20,364 --> 01:15:22,628
You guys shouldn't be here.

878
01:15:22,799 --> 01:15:24,027
Give us the tablet, son.

879
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:26,192
Wait a minute, Nicky.
What are you guys doing?

880
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:28,600
We're not gonna hurt you.
Give us the tablet.

881
01:15:28,772 --> 01:15:31,741
I'm sorry to tell you this, son,
but your dad doesn't work here.

882
01:15:31,908 --> 01:15:34,968
He got fired this morning.
Couldn't hack it.

883
01:15:35,145 --> 01:15:38,080
Dad? I thought you said
you weren't fired.

884
01:15:38,248 --> 01:15:40,614
I did. They're lying,
trying to steal that thing.

885
01:15:40,784 --> 01:15:43,446
Turn the middle piece,
you'll see what I was talking about.

886
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,485
That is museum property, son.
Give it back.

887
01:15:45,656 --> 01:15:47,590
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it.

888
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:49,918
- Give us the tablet!
- Nicky?

889
01:15:50,627 --> 01:15:52,060
Trust me.

890
01:16:14,484 --> 01:16:15,951
Nick? Run. Now.

891
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,020
Get back here, kid!

892
01:16:21,725 --> 01:16:23,420
Bad idea, Larry.

893
01:16:23,827 --> 01:16:26,352
You wanna dance, hot dog?
You wanna dance?

894
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,657
Gus, you're an old man.
I don't wanna hurt you.

895
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:34,732
You see, Larry, a few years into
the job, the three of us realized that...

896
01:16:34,905 --> 01:16:39,035
...Iike everything else in this museum,
we got new life at night.

897
01:16:39,209 --> 01:16:42,440
Sundown to sunrise,
we felt young again.

898
01:16:44,681 --> 01:16:46,205
Okay. Did not see that coming.

899
01:16:46,383 --> 01:16:48,044
Gave us an energy boost.

900
01:16:48,218 --> 01:16:50,482
We love the nightlife, Larry.

901
01:16:50,654 --> 01:16:52,815
So when we found out
they were gonna fired us...

902
01:16:52,989 --> 01:16:54,456
...we had to steal the tablet.

903
01:16:54,624 --> 01:16:56,649
Everyone knows you need the money.

904
01:16:56,827 --> 01:16:58,692
Add the stuff we planted
in your place...

905
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:00,989
...pretty obvious you committed
the crime.

906
01:17:01,164 --> 01:17:03,064
Take care of that cut.

907
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:05,201
Come on, guys, let's go find that kid.

908
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:09,195
- Sweet dreams, cupcake!
- No!

909
01:17:09,373 --> 01:17:10,806
Pile driver!

910
01:17:11,641 --> 01:17:13,541
Let's get our tablet.

911
01:17:39,336 --> 01:17:41,668
Thank you very much.
We'll take it from here.

912
01:17:41,872 --> 01:17:43,396
Nicky!

913
01:17:45,409 --> 01:17:48,207
Just in time, Larry.
We were just locking up.

914
01:17:49,713 --> 01:17:51,806
Sleep tight, hotshot.

915
01:17:53,617 --> 01:17:55,517
Let's grab everything we can fence.

916
01:17:55,685 --> 01:17:59,985
I don't know about you,
but I'm planning on a long retirement.

917
01:18:07,964 --> 01:18:11,422
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there,
I need you, pal!

918
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,164
Someone call my name?

919
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,406
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.

920
01:18:19,576 --> 01:18:21,441
Teddy, can you get us out of here?

921
01:18:21,611 --> 01:18:23,875
Can't do it, man. This is your moment.

922
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,571
Will you save the lectures, please?
I'm not you. Okay?

923
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:30,208
I didn't build the Panama Canal,
I wasn't president of the United States!

924
01:18:30,387 --> 01:18:31,581
I need some help. Come on.

925
01:18:31,755 --> 01:18:33,518
Actually...

926
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:39,518
...I never did any of those things.
Teddy Roosevelt did.

927
01:18:39,696 --> 01:18:42,563
I was made in a mannequin factory
in Poughkeepsie.

928
01:18:42,732 --> 01:18:44,597
I never shot a wild beast.

929
01:18:44,768 --> 01:18:47,999
I'm not even brave enough to tell
that beautiful woman I love her.

930
01:18:48,472 --> 01:18:49,803
But you...

931
01:18:50,574 --> 01:18:54,101
...you gotta finish the job this time.
You can't quit.

932
01:18:56,913 --> 01:18:58,881
I'm made of wax, Larry.

933
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,346
What are you made of?

934
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:08,588
- Wait! That's all you got for me?
- That's it!

935
01:19:20,937 --> 01:19:22,928
That's it. Come on.

936
01:19:23,773 --> 01:19:25,104
Duck!

937
01:19:26,776 --> 01:19:28,266
Go over there!

938
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:51,726
Hey. Hi. How you doing?
Sorry to bother you...

939
01:19:51,902 --> 01:19:54,200
...but your guys there? Your jackal guys?

940
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:56,669
Do you think you could ask them
to back off, please?

941
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,139
We're not trying to hurt you, they think
we are. Could you do it like now?

942
01:20:05,882 --> 01:20:08,476
Thank you. Nicky.

943
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:10,481
Thank you.

944
01:20:18,428 --> 01:20:19,827
Dad?

945
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:33,699
You would not believe how stuffy
it is in there.

946
01:20:35,779 --> 01:20:38,805
- How come you speak English?
- I went to Cambridge University.

947
01:20:38,982 --> 01:20:40,074
You went to Cambridge?

948
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,844
I was on display
in the Egyptology Department.

949
01:20:43,987 --> 01:20:46,547
I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king
of the fourth king...

950
01:20:46,723 --> 01:20:49,248
...ruler of the land of my fathers.

951
01:20:49,859 --> 01:20:52,020
I am Larry...

952
01:20:53,496 --> 01:20:55,327
...son of Milton...

953
01:20:55,498 --> 01:20:58,865
...and this is my son, Nick.

954
01:20:59,035 --> 01:21:01,526
And we hail from Brooklyn.

955
01:21:01,871 --> 01:21:05,136
Well, I do. I mean, he comes out and
stays with me on Wednesdays...

956
01:21:05,308 --> 01:21:06,570
...and every other weekend.

957
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:11,544
That was the custody agreement
that we had.

958
01:21:12,015 --> 01:21:15,712
Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn...

959
01:21:15,885 --> 01:21:17,750
...I am forever in your debt.

960
01:21:17,921 --> 01:21:20,515
Now bestow the tablet upon me...

961
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:23,215
...so that I may assume command
of my kingdom.

962
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,029
Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet. I would...

963
01:21:27,197 --> 01:21:30,564
...Iove to bestow it upon you,
but we don't actually...

964
01:21:31,101 --> 01:21:32,432
...have it.

965
01:21:40,577 --> 01:21:43,341
Thanks, guys. Don't worry.
I'll watch out for him!

966
01:21:43,513 --> 01:21:44,878
Thank you.

967
01:21:59,896 --> 01:22:01,591
What is that?

968
01:22:02,966 --> 01:22:04,627
Huns.

969
01:22:05,602 --> 01:22:07,399
I gotta deal with this guy.

970
01:22:44,107 --> 01:22:46,337
Pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun.

971
01:22:54,284 --> 01:22:56,184
He says that he wants to rip you apart.

972
01:22:56,352 --> 01:22:58,877
All right. Again with the ripping.
Listen, I understand.

973
01:22:59,055 --> 01:23:02,547
I get it. Ripping for you...
You want to rip things, okay?

974
01:23:02,726 --> 01:23:06,685
And I think maybe that's because
somebody ripped you a long time ago.

975
01:23:07,163 --> 01:23:08,653
In here.

976
01:23:09,332 --> 01:23:11,527
Somebody ripped little...

977
01:23:11,701 --> 01:23:14,670
...baby Attila a long time ago,
right here.

978
01:23:15,839 --> 01:23:19,240
They ripped something out,
didn't they?

979
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:22,671
They ripped the love.

980
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,812
They ripped the love right out of you,
didn't they?

981
01:23:26,683 --> 01:23:30,244
A little baby all alone in a tent...

982
01:23:30,987 --> 01:23:33,319
...whose daddy went off...

983
01:23:34,157 --> 01:23:37,126
...to pillage some town...

984
01:23:37,293 --> 01:23:40,023
...or go and plunder somewhere,
just doing his job.

985
01:23:40,196 --> 01:23:42,323
But who was left alone?

986
01:23:45,702 --> 01:23:47,567
You.

987
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:56,440
Let it out. Let it go. Let it go.

988
01:24:17,066 --> 01:24:20,661
It's okay. It's okay.

989
01:24:22,305 --> 01:24:24,500
You're next.

990
01:24:28,378 --> 01:24:31,245
Good. That's good. Just breathe.

991
01:24:35,251 --> 01:24:36,616
- Larry Daley.
- Yeah.

992
01:24:40,256 --> 01:24:42,121
Good. Yes.

993
01:24:42,692 --> 01:24:44,557
Yeah. Okay. Good, good.

994
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:49,262
All right!
I need everybody to listen up!

995
01:24:52,936 --> 01:24:54,403
Guys! Come on!

996
01:24:58,208 --> 01:25:04,511
Quiet!

997
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:15,882
My dum-dum want to speak.

998
01:25:16,059 --> 01:25:17,856
Thank you.

999
01:25:18,728 --> 01:25:21,060
Now, this here's King Ahkmenrah.

1000
01:25:21,231 --> 01:25:24,064
His tablet is what brings you to life
every night.

1001
01:25:24,234 --> 01:25:27,032
And those old night watchmen?
They stole it.

1002
01:25:27,437 --> 01:25:30,099
Now, we need to find those guards
and get the tablet back...

1003
01:25:30,273 --> 01:25:32,173
...and we need to do it before morning.

1004
01:25:32,342 --> 01:25:35,505
Civil War guys,
head over to the Planetarium Wing.

1005
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:40,513
My explorer friend
whose name escapes me.

1006
01:25:40,683 --> 01:25:44,050
- It's Columbus.
- Right, Columbus! Right, I'm sorry.

1007
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:47,018
There's no nameplate, so...
Columbus, take the Neanderthals...

1008
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:50,125
...and do a sweep from lnvertebrates
all the way through Reptiles.

1009
01:25:50,293 --> 01:25:53,285
Jed and Octavius, their van's parked
out back. Go take care of it.

1010
01:25:53,463 --> 01:25:56,557
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!
No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy.

1011
01:25:56,733 --> 01:25:58,394
Romans work alone.

1012
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:01,295
- That didn't hurt. Don't be a baby.
- Yes, it did.

1013
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:02,699
Come on.

1014
01:26:03,273 --> 01:26:04,934
That was much harder!

1015
01:26:05,108 --> 01:26:06,575
Guys, come on!

1016
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:09,503
Jed, Octavius.

1017
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,977
Take away the fact you were born
2000 years apart...

1018
01:26:12,148 --> 01:26:13,672
...you guys aren't that different.

1019
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,445
You're both great leaders.

1020
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:18,849
You just want what's best
for your people, right?

1021
01:26:19,022 --> 01:26:20,421
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1022
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:22,114
Civil War dudes.

1023
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:28,661
You guys are brothers, for God's sakes.
You gotta stop fighting.

1024
01:26:29,065 --> 01:26:33,399
North wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry.

1025
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:39,030
Don't wanna burst your bubble.
But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers...

1026
01:26:39,842 --> 01:26:42,834
...and NASCAR, so just chill!

1027
01:26:44,147 --> 01:26:48,379
Look, without that tablet,
all of this...

1028
01:26:48,551 --> 01:26:52,282
...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing,
it all goes away.

1029
01:26:52,455 --> 01:26:55,549
Now, I don't wanna let that happen,
but I need your help.

1030
01:26:55,725 --> 01:26:58,057
We can get this done,
but we gotta do it together.

1031
01:26:59,228 --> 01:27:00,422
So who's with me?

1032
01:27:01,831 --> 01:27:03,492
Yeah.

1033
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:05,600
- Who's with me?
- Yeah!

1034
01:27:05,768 --> 01:27:08,259
- Yeah!
- Charge!

1035
01:27:09,672 --> 01:27:12,573
All right! Now, let's do this, people!

1036
01:27:14,677 --> 01:27:15,974
And animals!

1037
01:27:17,847 --> 01:27:21,578
And weird, faceless puppet creatures.
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

1038
01:27:44,607 --> 01:27:46,541
Come on! Follow me, boys!

1039
01:27:46,709 --> 01:27:48,404
Geronimo!

1040
01:28:00,123 --> 01:28:01,988
Oh, jeez.

1041
01:28:16,039 --> 01:28:20,237
Now, boys, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

1042
01:28:25,648 --> 01:28:27,912
I guess it's gonna be the hard way.

1043
01:28:31,754 --> 01:28:35,554
Right, men, we're almost there.

1044
01:28:55,912 --> 01:28:58,107
Save yourself!

1045
01:28:58,281 --> 01:29:00,215
I ain't quitting you!

1046
01:29:02,151 --> 01:29:03,709
Gus?

1047
01:29:06,022 --> 01:29:07,216
Reginald?

1048
01:29:07,657 --> 01:29:09,386
Fellas, where are you?

1049
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,393
Guys?

1050
01:29:22,905 --> 01:29:26,397
That's what I'm talking about.
Good job, gentlemen.

1051
01:29:26,576 --> 01:29:28,043
Loving the teamwork!

1052
01:29:48,131 --> 01:29:51,589
They've vanished.
How will we find them?

1053
01:29:52,535 --> 01:29:54,628
I know someone who can help. Come on.

1054
01:29:55,738 --> 01:29:57,569
Watch out!

1055
01:30:04,247 --> 01:30:08,115
Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen,
I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet.

1056
01:30:08,284 --> 01:30:10,775
You think you can track the guys
who took it?

1057
01:30:11,454 --> 01:30:15,618
He went east
but he lost control and crashed.

1058
01:30:16,225 --> 01:30:19,251
You're amazing. How can you tell that?

1059
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:25,390
He left the wagon...

1060
01:30:25,568 --> 01:30:27,399
...and went back.

1061
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,401
He went back?

1062
01:30:30,706 --> 01:30:32,139
Why would he go back?

1063
01:30:34,877 --> 01:30:36,310
Get out of the way!

1064
01:30:44,487 --> 01:30:46,011
You saved me.

1065
01:30:46,422 --> 01:30:48,447
You're worth saving, my dear.

1066
01:30:50,893 --> 01:30:53,521
- That's problematic.
- Teddy. Oh, man.

1067
01:30:53,696 --> 01:30:55,891
Larry, relax. I'm wax.

1068
01:30:56,065 --> 01:30:57,930
You gotta do something.
Dawn's approaching.

1069
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:01,365
- Half the museum's running amuck outside.
- He's got my tablet.

1070
01:31:04,073 --> 01:31:06,166
Come on, Ockie!

1071
01:31:12,215 --> 01:31:14,115
At your service, Gigantor!

1072
01:31:14,283 --> 01:31:16,513
How can we be of assistance, my liege?

1073
01:31:16,686 --> 01:31:18,881
Just give me a second, guys.

1074
01:31:22,992 --> 01:31:24,687
Rexy?

1075
01:31:26,062 --> 01:31:27,324
Here, boy.

1076
01:31:27,496 --> 01:31:29,726
Teddy, I need a horse.

1077
01:31:29,899 --> 01:31:31,560
Do it, man.

1078
01:31:46,682 --> 01:31:50,243
- Come on, boy! Let me hear you yell!
- Yeah!

1079
01:31:50,419 --> 01:31:52,284
Just living the dream, baby!

1080
01:31:52,455 --> 01:31:54,082
I'm loving this!

1081
01:31:57,693 --> 01:31:59,854
Pull the stagecoach over now!

1082
01:32:02,765 --> 01:32:04,357
Can I make this turn up here?

1083
01:32:06,435 --> 01:32:09,598
I'll take that as a yes. Hang on!

1084
01:32:15,945 --> 01:32:17,776
I can't hold it!

1085
01:32:31,294 --> 01:32:32,955
Come on, Tex, let's finish this.

1086
01:32:34,363 --> 01:32:36,058
Come on!

1087
01:32:40,836 --> 01:32:42,565
Give me the tablet, Cecil!

1088
01:32:42,738 --> 01:32:44,228
Can't do it, son.

1089
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:49,177
Pull over!

1090
01:32:49,345 --> 01:32:52,473
It ain't gonna happen. Moving on.

1091
01:32:53,182 --> 01:32:55,844
Last chance, Cecil.
Stop the horses or I will!

1092
01:32:56,118 --> 01:32:57,983
They can't be stopped, Larry.

1093
01:32:58,154 --> 01:32:59,815
Don't you know your history?

1094
01:32:59,989 --> 01:33:05,017
These are money carriers. They were trained
not to stop for anything but a secret word.

1095
01:33:05,194 --> 01:33:07,094
Really? You mean a word like...

1096
01:33:08,464 --> 01:33:10,091
..." Dakota"?

1097
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:16,101
Come on, Tex.

1098
01:33:20,343 --> 01:33:22,675
I read up on my history.
Thanks for the tip.

1099
01:33:23,112 --> 01:33:24,340
Oh, and by the way...

1100
01:33:24,513 --> 01:33:27,004
...don't ever talk to me like that
in front of my son.

1101
01:33:29,285 --> 01:33:30,980
Moving on.

1102
01:33:35,057 --> 01:33:36,991
- Hey, Huns.
- Tell Attila to have his boys...

1103
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:39,150
...take him back.
Put him with the guards.

1104
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:45,095
Oh, and no limb ripping, okay?

1105
01:33:58,881 --> 01:34:00,542
Hey, boy. Wait, wait, hold the phone.

1106
01:34:00,716 --> 01:34:04,743
What's makeekaka mean?
Wait. Translation, please.

1107
01:34:06,589 --> 01:34:10,491
The year was 1909. I was going up
the Zambezi River in Africa.

1108
01:34:10,659 --> 01:34:13,719
And our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy
who spoke only by clicking.

1109
01:34:21,804 --> 01:34:23,169
There we are.

1110
01:34:26,876 --> 01:34:28,810
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

1111
01:34:28,978 --> 01:34:31,105
I gotta get you guys
back to the museum.

1112
01:34:32,782 --> 01:34:34,044
How?

1113
01:34:36,786 --> 01:34:39,186
Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help.

1114
01:34:39,355 --> 01:34:42,586
This is your tablet. You know
the instructions. You get everyone back.

1115
01:35:10,653 --> 01:35:13,588
Come on. There's somebody
who's gotta see this.

1116
01:35:16,025 --> 01:35:19,290
What I'm saying is, for the type of money
that they pay A-Rod...

1117
01:35:19,462 --> 01:35:22,659
...he ought to be bringing home
a World Series trophy every season.

1118
01:35:23,165 --> 01:35:24,894
You know what I mean?

1119
01:35:43,352 --> 01:35:45,912
Now, who they gonna get
to clean up all that doo-doo?

1120
01:35:46,088 --> 01:35:47,282
- lnuit.
- Yeah.

1121
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,151
One terracotta soldier.

1122
01:35:49,325 --> 01:35:50,553
- Vikings.
- Right.

1123
01:35:50,726 --> 01:35:52,717
- Alpaca.
- Welcome back, ladies.

1124
01:35:52,895 --> 01:35:54,487
- Llama.
- Hey.

1125
01:35:54,663 --> 01:35:55,994
Viking guys.

1126
01:35:56,165 --> 01:35:58,633
Do me a favor. Your fellows
made some funeral pyre...

1127
01:35:58,801 --> 01:36:00,928
...in Petrified Wood. Go clean that up.

1128
01:36:01,103 --> 01:36:02,468
Okay? Thank you.

1129
01:36:03,906 --> 01:36:06,568
- He's back.
- All right, I'll deal with this joker.

1130
01:36:06,742 --> 01:36:09,870
Hey, hey, Moose.
It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right?

1131
01:36:10,045 --> 01:36:12,479
I told you, you can't come through
with those antlers.

1132
01:36:12,648 --> 01:36:15,674
So you and your caribou buddy
gotta go around to the loading dock.

1133
01:36:15,851 --> 01:36:18,547
- Lawrence!
- Hey, Teddy.

1134
01:36:19,221 --> 01:36:20,882
Great to see you in one piece.

1135
01:36:21,056 --> 01:36:23,456
Sakagawea, a little hot wax,
and I'm a new man.

1136
01:36:23,626 --> 01:36:25,321
Larry?

1137
01:36:29,798 --> 01:36:32,062
I told you I wasn't making fun of you.

1138
01:36:32,234 --> 01:36:34,896
- I know.
- Teddy?

1139
01:36:36,472 --> 01:36:39,737
Oh, my God.

1140
01:36:40,476 --> 01:36:42,171
Wanna meet her?

1141
01:36:43,946 --> 01:36:45,140
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1142
01:36:45,314 --> 01:36:46,474
Okay, come on.

1143
01:36:46,649 --> 01:36:49,846
Excuse me. President Roosevelt,
this is my friend Rebecca.

1144
01:36:50,019 --> 01:36:51,646
- An honor.
- Hi.

1145
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:53,651
And this is Sakagawea.

1146
01:36:53,822 --> 01:36:55,050
- Wea.
- Wea.

1147
01:36:55,224 --> 01:36:56,714
Wea.

1148
01:36:56,892 --> 01:36:59,827
I think she has a few questions
she wants to ask you.

1149
01:37:01,597 --> 01:37:03,827
You rock. I am a big fan.

1150
01:37:05,301 --> 01:37:06,893
What would you like to know?

1151
01:37:07,736 --> 01:37:10,534
Well, I mean,
I don't know where to start, but...

1152
01:37:21,951 --> 01:37:24,442
- One Buddha.
- Check.

1153
01:37:26,021 --> 01:37:28,353
Two zebras.

1154
01:37:29,024 --> 01:37:32,357
- Right. Check.
- Dexter! Welcome back.

1155
01:37:32,528 --> 01:37:35,395
Hey, Dex, so look.
No hard feelings, all right?

1156
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:38,457
- Lawrence!
- You saw!

1157
01:37:38,634 --> 01:37:40,898
- You saw what he did just then!
- Who's evolved?

1158
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:42,867
- I am.
- Who's evolved?

1159
01:37:43,038 --> 01:37:44,403
I am!

1160
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:46,806
Good.

1161
01:37:47,576 --> 01:37:49,066
Well, they're all here.

1162
01:37:49,244 --> 01:37:50,711
Well done. Everyone's in.

1163
01:37:50,879 --> 01:37:52,540
Yeah, well...

1164
01:37:52,781 --> 01:37:54,510
...not everyone.

1165
01:37:55,684 --> 01:37:58,778
We lost a couple of good, little men
out there tonight.

1166
01:37:59,188 --> 01:38:03,056
With great victory comes great sacrifice.

1167
01:38:04,059 --> 01:38:05,583
Yeah.

1168
01:38:08,564 --> 01:38:10,395
Dad, look.

1169
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:18,172
Bully!

1170
01:38:39,061 --> 01:38:41,427
You ain't getting rid of us that easy.

1171
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:03,445
Until tomorrow evening, Lawrence?

1172
01:39:04,086 --> 01:39:06,384
Yeah. I don't know about that, Teddy.

1173
01:39:07,122 --> 01:39:09,386
It's gonna be tough
to talk my way out of this one.

1174
01:39:09,558 --> 01:39:11,617
Well, if that's indeed the case...

1175
01:39:11,794 --> 01:39:13,694
...then it's farewell, my friend.

1176
01:39:15,664 --> 01:39:17,325
Nick?

1177
01:39:18,467 --> 01:39:20,367
Your father's a great man.

1178
01:39:20,869 --> 01:39:22,461
I know.

1179
01:39:28,277 --> 01:39:29,904
Told you.

1180
01:39:33,382 --> 01:39:35,350
All right. Good night.

1181
01:39:35,517 --> 01:39:38,418
No, Lawrence. Good day.

1182
01:39:43,492 --> 01:39:45,392
Hey, Teddy?

1183
01:39:58,607 --> 01:40:00,199
Thanks.

1184
01:40:13,856 --> 01:40:17,087
You're watching New York 1.
News all morning.

1185
01:40:18,427 --> 01:40:20,952
Thanks for joining us.
There is a fresh blanket of snow.

1186
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:23,530
But it's not the snow
that's got New Yorkers talking.

1187
01:40:23,699 --> 01:40:27,931
It's what's in the snow. There are
dinosaur tracks along West 81st Street.

1188
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:31,903
Here's the remarkable video. These appear
to be Tyrannosaurus Rex tracks...

1189
01:40:32,074 --> 01:40:35,134
...and they lead straight
to the Museum of Natural History.

1190
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:39,707
Authorities have found what appear to be
cave drawings in the subway.

1191
01:40:39,882 --> 01:40:43,010
Neanderthals atop the museum roof.
Elaborate hoax or publicity stunt?

1192
01:40:44,586 --> 01:40:46,451
You be the judge,
but one thing's for sure:

1193
01:40:46,622 --> 01:40:50,251
The folks at the Natural History Museum
have really outdone them--

1194
01:40:53,529 --> 01:40:54,791
Any explanation at all?

1195
01:40:59,101 --> 01:41:00,762
No. Got nothing.

1196
01:41:00,936 --> 01:41:02,164
Good.

1197
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:05,433
I'll take your keys and your flashlight.

1198
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:25,551
Folks, this way.

1199
01:42:23,218 --> 01:42:27,211
My name is Nick Daley.
My Career Day parent is my dad.

1200
01:42:27,389 --> 01:42:30,517
He's the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1201
01:42:35,564 --> 01:42:37,464
Hey, how's it going? Well, Nicky said it:

1202
01:42:37,633 --> 01:42:40,101
I'm the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1203
01:42:40,269 --> 01:42:44,228
Let me tell you something:
That's when history comes alive.

1204
01:42:45,507 --> 01:42:48,101
How many of you guys
have been over to the museum?

1205
01:43:09,031 --> 01:43:12,398
Goal!

1206
01:43:39,328 --> 01:43:41,762
Hey, it's getting late.
Are you ready to go home?

1207
01:43:42,297 --> 01:43:43,286
Nope.

1208
01:43:49,805 --> 01:43:51,432
Let's ride.

1209
01:44:28,977 --> 01:44:32,242
It was nice of Larry not to rat us out,
but this is ridiculous.

1210
01:44:32,414 --> 01:44:35,440
We're night watchmen, not janitors!

1211
01:44:35,617 --> 01:44:37,414
Gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job.

1212
01:44:37,586 --> 01:44:39,053
I'll gonna catch a few Z's.

1213
01:44:39,221 --> 01:44:40,688
You ain't going nowhere.

1214
01:44:40,856 --> 01:44:43,518
Start mopping, hot dog.

1215
01:44:47,963 --> 01:44:49,624
Over here.
