Ain't no draft dodger

00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:18,336
No, Will, you've been classified.

612
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,471
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

613
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:30,217
If we hurry, we can catch that picture
at the base theater.

614
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,790
Not me, Ben.

615
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:36,089
- You said you ain't never seen a picture.
- I know, but I got my duty to do.

616
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:42,468
- You're going back to that latrine again?
- You bet.

617
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:45,969
It's against the rules for you
to be permanent in the latrine like that.

618
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,402
All week you've been there.

619
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,440
Sergeant King knows the rules, don't he?

620
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,170
Besides, like I told you,
he's doing me and you a favor.

621
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:56,578
- What favor, will you tell me that?
- I aim to surprise you, Ben.

622
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,346
You don't go to lectures or study,
how you gonna get classified?

623
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:02,546
Sergeant King says I'm already that way.

624
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:07,057
- Are you crazy? Don't you...?
- Now, don't take on so, Ben.

625
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:10,925
Just wait and see what the captain says
after he makes his inspection tomorrow.

626
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,157
Why you take them faucets, for instance.

627
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:17,134
I polished them so hard,
they don't say hot and cold no more.

628
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:20,466
What?

629
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:27,605
At ease.

630
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:35,347
I think you'll be very pleased here, sir.

631
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:37,218
Attention.

632
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:44,529
Latrine ready for inspection, sir.

633
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:52,538
This is incredible.
This is absolutely incredible.

634
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:54,435
I am pleased.

635
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:55,802
No.

636
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,967
- No, I am happy.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

637
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,012
- You the one on latrine duty today, private?
- Yes, sir. All week, sir.

638
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:03,343
- Ahem, ahem.
- You are to be congratulated.

639
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:05,644
Just look at...

640
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,114
What did you say?

641
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:10,751
Me? Nothing, sir.

642
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,190
- Something about all week.
- Uh...

643
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,992
Well, I done my best in one day,
but just to be fair with you...

644
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,895
...it took me a week
of scrubbing to get it like this.

645
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:23,195
Is this man being punished
for some infraction?

646
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:27,397
- Oh, no, sir. No, sir.
- Oh, heck no, sir. I'm PLO.

647
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:31,373
- You're what?
- Permanent latrine orderly.

648
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:33,342
Stockdale.

649
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:38,008
Oh, but don't credit me none though, sir.
It's all Sergeant King's doings.

650
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:42,121
He even got it fixed up
so I don't even have to get classified.

651
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:44,587
- Sir, I...
- What? That's impossible.

652
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:48,194
Oh, no, sir.
He fixed it with some friends of his.

653
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:52,961
Yes, sir.
It was him got me to work so hard...

654
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:55,102
...telling me how latrines
is your hobby...

655
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,204
...and sticking your head
down into things and all.

656
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:06,778
- Sir, I can explain every...
- Now, don't you be bashful, sergeant.

657
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,079
Sir, I been wanting to tell you
about what a good sergeant he is.

658
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:15,279
Oh, he solves our problems for us...

659
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:19,756
...and helps us out on our difficult days
in military service.

660
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:23,624
And I guess that he's
about the best dang sergeant there is...

661
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:27,096
...in the whole danged Air Force.

662
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:35,603
Sir, you really ought to get up
off of his back.

663
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:46,346
How long have you been a sergeant?

664
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:50,690
- Well, sir, I... Ahem.
- Speak up.

665
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,358
Sixteen years, sir.

666
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:56,621
And how long do you expect
to remain a sergeant?

667
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,121
Twelve years.

668
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:01,234
You will remain a sergeant
exactly one week. One week.

669
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:04,371
Unless this man completes
the entire classification process...

670
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:07,530
...and is shipped out with the group
he came in with. Understand?

671
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:10,438
Unless this man is out of here
by the end of the week...

672
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:14,877
...you will not be in charge of this barracks,
you will not be a sergeant...

673
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:19,008
...you will in all probability
be a permanent latrine orderly.

674
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:21,984
PLO.

675
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:26,655
This is not your fault, private.

676
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:29,187
You've done a fine job.

677
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:34,467
I have never seen such a clean latrine
in my entire career.

678
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:35,960
Thank you, sir.

679
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:41,834
It was my aim to get it just as clean
as that operating room...

680
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:45,240
...where they're fixing
to cut out your heart!

681
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:53,351
You forgot to ask him
about the transfers.

682
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:59,053
What happened? What did you do it for?

683
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,686
Heck, I couldn't see no sense
in me getting all the credit.

684
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,534
We've gotta get you classified right away.
We gotta get you out of here.

685
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,733
You don't want me around no more?
I thought we was buddies.

686
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:18,100
It ain't what I want,
it's what the captain wants.

687
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,270
Now, we gotta get you classified
in a hurry.

688
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,315
You're gonna have to take tests and you're
going to have to talk to a lot of people.

689
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:27,249
And you're going to have to work
real hard.

690
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,588
Will it help Ben and me
get them transfers?

691
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:35,252
Well, I guarantee you, wherever you go,
they'll bust a gut to get you transferred.

692
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:39,229
Well, I'll work hard all right,
but I don't know.

693
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,130
The last test I took
was close on to five years ago...

694
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:44,066
...and that was one of them tests...

695
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:46,763
...where you try this fella's toothpaste
for 10 days...

696
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,909
...and see if your teeth don't get brighter.

697
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:52,245
And I failed.

698
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,612
You been admiring this watch of mine,
haven't you?

699
00:43:55,783 --> 00:43:58,946
I sure have, sergeant.
That there's the prettiest watch I ever seen.

700
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,452
You get shipped out of here
by Saturday morning like the captain said...

701
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:04,022
...and it's yours.

702
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:05,590
- Mine?
- Yours.

703
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,887
Golly.

704
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,588
- Now you'll work real hard, right?
- Right.

705
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:13,528
- And not waste any time?
- No, sir.

706
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:14,725
Good boy.

707
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,462
Now first thing Monday morning,
we start classification.

708
00:44:17,638 --> 00:44:21,130
You stay right here around the barracks
and get a lot of rest...

709
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:24,209
...and relax your head.

710
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:30,044
I'm going down to the testing area
and see if I can borrow some of the tests.

711
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:31,912
Okay.

712
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:36,955
Tell them I'll give them back
just like I did the toothpaste.

713
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:46,625
<i>WILL: This place where they give us
the tests was really something.</i>

714
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,201
<i>They had this great big building,
full of doctors, nurses and officers.</i>

715
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,375
<i>All of them walking in and out
and around real quickety-quick...</i>

716
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:58,511
<i>... and not smiling at nobody.</i>

717
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:01,773
<i>And then there was this place
something like a schoolroom...</i>

718
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,009
<i>... where they give us
the tests we had to write out.</i>

719
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:07,380
Time's up, pal.

720
00:45:15,662 --> 00:45:18,062
It was right friendly of you
to wait for me.

721
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:19,961
Thank you.

722
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:25,261
- How'd you think you did, Will?
- Well, them printed tests they give us...

723
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:28,806
...they was exactly like the ones
that you borrowed...

724
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:32,273
Only what?

725
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:35,347
Only you spent so much time
drumming the answers into me...

726
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:40,010
...we ought to have spent a little more
on the questions they joint up with.

727
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:49,156
Now, you just sit right down here
and wait.

728
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:10,876
Come on, Will, the corporal's waiting.

729
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:20,588
Here he is, corporal.
Awfully sorry to keep you waiting.

730
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:29,258
What we do here, private,
is to evaluate your manual dexterity...

731
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:33,736
...on a time scale
in relation to digital visual coordination.

732
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:37,240
Two irregular steel links
which can be interconnected thusly.

733
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:40,141
I separate them, I join them.

734
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:42,544
It will be your task,
when I give the signal...

735
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,617
...to place the two links
in an interconnected relationship...

736
00:46:45,786 --> 00:46:48,254
...I have just demonstrated.

737
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:56,194
Uh...

738
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:57,959
I put them together?

739
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,435
That's right, you put them together.

740
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:05,094
I'll time you
and three minutes is passing.

741
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:08,571
Now, whatever you do,
don't get nervous.

742
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:12,144
Ready. Go.

743
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,011
There you go.

744
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:20,987
Attaboy.

745
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,387
- Put them together.
- Sergeant, please.

746
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:27,686
Nobody ever does this
in less than two minutes.

747
00:47:27,861 --> 00:47:29,920
You're not even supposed to be in here.

748
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,464
This is a special case. He has to go out
with the group he came in with.

749
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:36,262
- It's is a very difficult test.
- I couldn't do it myself.

750
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,200
- What are you talking about?
- I want you to get out of here.

751
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:42,604
- I'd just like to see you try to do it.
- This is my department.

752
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,937
- He's my department.
- That's my door. Get out.

753
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,012
- Get out right this minute.
- Throw me out.

754
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,444
You're not supposed to be here.
This is my watch...

755
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,084
- All right, then watch your watch...
- I'm done.

756
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:53,276
Stop the watch.

757
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:59,690
- Look. Look at that.
- He put them together, didn't he?

758
00:48:00,694 --> 00:48:03,424
Sergeant! Sergeant!

759
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:07,055
What's the fuss about? You said,
"Put them together," he put them together.

760
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:10,328

How am I gonna mark him on that?

You're supposed to be grading him on this.
Can't you do that?

762
00:48:13,774 --> 00:48:17,107
I'm supposed to mark it down
whether they put it back together or not...

763
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:20,872
...and there ain't supposed to be
but one way of doing it and he didn't do it.

on a thing like that?

Sixteen dollars, they cost.

- lf you think I'm gonna pay $ 16...
- Corporal!

767
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:29,913
Sixteen lousy dollars!

768

Corporal, I'll be glad to pay
the 16 lousy dollars.

- lf he passed the test.

He was supposed to do it a certain way.

Now, corporal,
let's look at this thing logically.

773

You need money

Oh, Ben, you ain't still sad
about not being in the infantry?

if he could fix me up.

786

- Yeah, what'd he say?
- He didn't say nothing.

Didn't you hear that lecture

I never heard of saluting no woman before.

...whether a person is a man or a woman
or what.

827

just say that you never dream at all.

Oh, so defensive.

912
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:04,566
Well, it's not easy
to talk about your mother, is it?

913
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:07,001
No, sir.
See, she died when I was born.

914
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,781
You could've told me that sooner.

915
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:23,151
Do you hate your mama?

916
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,690
I figured as how you said it
was so common.

917
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,522
I do not hate my mother.

918
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:32,324
I should hope not.

919
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:36,826
Does she beat you or something?

920
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:40,297
This is a transference.

921
00:57:40,473 --> 00:57:44,705
You're taking your stored up antagonisms
and loosing them in my direction.

922
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:48,641
Oh, transference.
It happens every day.

923
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:52,717
- It does? To the infantry?
- Yeah...

924
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:54,343
The infantry?

925
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:57,456
You'd give Ben a transfer
and I wish you'd give me one too.

926
00:57:57,624 --> 00:58:01,560
- Because I'd sure love to go along with him.
- Now stop.

927
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:06,059
Now, there are a few more topics
that we have to cover.

928
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,497
We will not talk about transfers
and we will not talk about my mother.

929
00:58:09,669 --> 00:58:12,604
We will talk about
what I want to talk about.

930
00:58:13,306 --> 00:58:15,069
Do you understand?

931
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:16,935
Yes, sir.

00:58:18,711 --> 00:58:20,338
Now, then.

933
00:58:20,513 --> 00:58:23,971
- Your father? Living?
- Yes, sir.

934
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,714
Oh.

935
00:58:25,885 --> 00:58:28,945
- Do you get along with him okay?
- Yes, sir.

936
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:32,580
- Does he ever beat you?
- Ha-ha. You bet.

937
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,624
- Hard?
- And how.

938
00:58:34,794 --> 00:58:37,160
Boy, there ain't nobody
can beat like my pa can.

939
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,264
So this is where
the antagonism comes from.

Hey, I got an uncle I hate, though.

Every time he comes out to the house,
he's wanting to wrestle with the mule...

...and the mule gets all wore out
and he gets all wore out.

Well, I don't really hate him, though.

947
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:05,848
It's just that I ain't exactly partial to him.

948
00:59:06,759 --> 00:59:09,557
Did I ask you about your uncle?

949
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:12,627

you wanted to talk about hating people.

Well, just girls. Just any girls.

Well, I don't like just any girls.

01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,478
What made you think he was angry?

1031
01:03:58,517 --> 01:04:00,144
Well, he got sort of fussed...

1032

...when I was reading this here sign
they had on the wall.

And that was right hard at first...

1034
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:09,621
...because they was
real peculiar words like:

lp, gnxl and buglump.

1036
01:04:17,202 --> 01:04:20,831
You were supposed to read them letters
one at a time.

01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,800

that way neither.

very slowly...

and tell me exactly what you see.

isn't she?

And he ain't gonna be classified.

And I'm gonna
be permanent latrine orderly.

once three rose buds at me.

1218
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:24,821
But this...

1219
01:17:25,957 --> 01:17:27,982
This is just...

1220
01:17:28,826 --> 01:17:31,260
Well, I don't know.

1221
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:44,570
They didn't hardly inspect
the latrine at all.

1222
01:17:44,742 --> 01:17:46,437
I don't know, Will.

1223
01:17:46,611 --> 01:17:48,101
They...

1224
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,739
They, oh...

1225
01:18:19,677 --> 01:18:21,542
Sergeant.

1226
01:18:22,413 --> 01:18:24,643
Lieutenant back there
almost spotted me.

1227
01:18:24,816 --> 01:18:26,647
- You all right?
- I ain't sure.

1228
01:18:26,818 --> 01:18:28,979
- Hey, where's Irving?
- MP's got him.

1229
01:18:29,153 --> 01:18:31,451
- Golly.
COLONEL: Very nice, captain.

1230
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:32,954
CAPTAIN:
Thank you, sir.

1231
01:18:33,124 --> 01:18:34,489
- The colonel?
- Yeah.

1232
01:18:34,659 --> 01:18:37,628
Hey, they inspected in here already.

1233
01:18:37,829 --> 01:18:38,853
Hey...

1234
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:41,294
...watch out for that treadle.

1235
01:18:44,068 --> 01:18:46,127
COLONEL:
Very good, indeed.

1236
01:18:49,707 --> 01:18:54,804
Mm-hm. Excellent. Excellent. Were you
in charge during your sergeant's absence?

1237
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:56,446
Yes, sir. Complete charge.

1238
01:18:56,614 --> 01:18:58,878
I think you should make a note
of this man's name.

1239
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:00,074
Yes, indeed, sir.

1240
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:01,980
- What is it, private?
- Whitledge, sir.

1241
01:19:12,597 --> 01:19:13,723
Whitledge, sir.

1242
01:19:13,898 --> 01:19:16,196
- What's that again, private?
- Whitledge, sir.

1243
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:22,067
W-H-l-T-L-E-D-G-E.

1244
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:27,874
- What the devil is...?
- What's going on in there?

1245
01:19:28,546 --> 01:19:30,912
Latrine's out of order, sir.

1246
01:19:31,082 --> 01:19:33,516
You're gonna have to use
the one next door.

1247
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:35,482
Let me in there.

1248
01:19:44,195 --> 01:19:46,891
This is the barracks sergeant, sir.

1249
01:19:48,032 --> 01:19:49,897
How are you, sir?

1250
01:19:50,068 --> 01:19:53,196
All slicked up for inspection. Explain.

1251
01:19:55,573 --> 01:19:57,200
Explain.

1252
01:19:57,942 --> 01:19:59,739
Well, sir...

1253
01:20:00,845 --> 01:20:03,643
...I went to a movie last night, sir.

1254
01:20:03,815 --> 01:20:07,307
And there were these eight infantry men
sitting right in behind me.

1255
01:20:07,485 --> 01:20:09,851
And they was cussing out the Air Force...

1256
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:15,288
...and saying as how that their officers
were more understanding than our officers.

1257
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:21,421
- So you fought them all night long?
- Yes, sir, it was awful.

1258
01:20:21,966 --> 01:20:23,957
What was the name of the movie?

1259
01:20:24,635 --> 01:20:25,727
- Movie?
- The movie.

1260
01:20:25,903 --> 01:20:27,370
Oh.

1261
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,965
<i>Forward March.</i>

1262
01:20:31,642 --> 01:20:33,974
<i>American Battalion.</i>

1263
01:20:34,212 --> 01:20:36,077
<i>Out of the Air.</i>

1264
01:20:37,548 --> 01:20:40,016
<i>Up in the Wild Blue?</i>

1265
01:20:41,252 --> 01:20:43,413
It was a sneak preview.

1266
01:20:44,956 --> 01:20:47,686
Captain, I don't know how this man
ever got on my base...

1267
01:20:47,859 --> 01:20:49,986
...but he's certainly
not going to remain here.

1268
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:54,154
Corrupting new airmen
with this horrible example. Ship him out.

1269
01:20:54,332 --> 01:20:56,596
There's a group
leaving for gunnery school today.

1270
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:59,896
Splendid. General Bush
can always use another private.

1271
01:21:00,071 --> 01:21:01,629
Private?

1272
01:21:04,108 --> 01:21:05,575
Private.

1273
01:21:06,944 --> 01:21:08,536
Private.

1274
01:21:10,748 --> 01:21:12,340
BEN:
That name was Whitledge, sir.

1275
01:21:12,517 --> 01:21:14,382
W-H-I-T-L...

1276
01:21:14,552 --> 01:21:15,883
- Whitledge, eh?
- Yes, sir.

1277
01:21:16,053 --> 01:21:20,717
This is going on your record, Whitledge.
This is going on everybody's record.

1278
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:29,431
Something special for the colonel.

1279
01:21:33,371 --> 01:21:35,498
You ain't a sergeant no more.

1280
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:38,437
No, I ain't a sergeant no more.
I'm a private.

1281
01:21:38,609 --> 01:21:42,045
A 45-year-old private.

1282
01:21:42,413 --> 01:21:43,675
Gosh.

1283
01:21:43,848 --> 01:21:47,181
- He's putting it on my record.
- Gosh, Ben...

1284
01:21:47,351 --> 01:21:51,344
There's one silver lining to this cloud,
though, by George.

1285
01:21:51,522 --> 01:21:55,288
You're staying here,
but I'm going to gunnery school...

1286
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:58,054
...a thousand miles away.

1287
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:59,719
WILL: Sergeant?
- Private.

1288
01:21:59,897 --> 01:22:01,296
I ain't staying here.

1289
01:22:01,466 --> 01:22:04,333
I'm going to gunnery school like you are.

1290
01:22:04,902 --> 01:22:06,699
They took you?

1291
01:22:07,138 --> 01:22:08,264
You passed the eye test?

1292
01:22:08,773 --> 01:22:11,298
It's on the bulletin board.

1293
01:22:11,476 --> 01:22:13,967
It was your helping done it for me.

1294
01:22:14,145 --> 01:22:18,479
- Oh, no, no, no.
- We're gonna be together.

1295
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:21,350
I've had about all I can take.

1296
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:24,579
You and him be together,
just leave me out of it.

1297
01:22:24,755 --> 01:22:26,586
- But we're buddies.
- Buddies?

1298
01:22:26,757 --> 01:22:29,225
Last night you said
you was proud of me.

1299
01:22:29,393 --> 01:22:31,452
I was drunk.
I didn't know what I was saying.

1300
01:22:31,629 --> 01:22:34,860
- You give me your watch.
- I was drunk.

1301
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:39,158
Not when you put me in charge
of the latrine.

1302
01:22:40,271 --> 01:22:44,537
You talk to him.
Maybe you can get through.

1303
01:22:47,011 --> 01:22:49,775
Cleaning the latrine
isn't a good job, Will.

1304
01:22:49,947 --> 01:22:52,074
It's the worst job there is.

1305
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:53,740
It's a punishment job.

1306
01:22:55,653 --> 01:22:56,711
It is.

1307
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:59,516
Now do you understand?
There's your buddy.

1308
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:02,716
Make trouble for him for a change.

1309
01:23:10,635 --> 01:23:12,193
[SIGHS]

1310
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:14,168
Great.

1311
01:23:14,338 --> 01:23:18,468
You thought you were gonna miss him,
so you tore up your transfer.

1312
01:23:18,643 --> 01:23:21,703
Well, you don't look so glad
about it now.

1313
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:29,242
You tore up your transfer, Ben?

1314
01:23:31,289 --> 01:23:33,154
It was just an application, that's all.

1315
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:36,389
To the infantry.

1316
01:23:36,561 --> 01:23:38,461
It doesn't make any difference now.

1317
01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:41,325
After this, I couldn't get transferred
to a troop of mules.

1318
01:23:41,499 --> 01:23:42,864
I didn't know you done that.

1319
01:23:43,034 --> 01:23:45,935
- Just forget about it, will you?
- You ain't sore at me?

1320
01:23:46,103 --> 01:23:48,663
I ain't jumping up and down,
you can say that again.

1321
01:23:48,839 --> 01:23:50,898
You ain't nothing
but trouble since we met...

1322
01:23:51,075 --> 01:23:53,475
...running around acting like a big,
dang donkey.

1323
01:23:53,811 --> 01:23:56,279
I'll make it up to you, Ben, honest I will.

1324
01:23:56,881 --> 01:23:59,975
Just forget about it, will you?
Don't try to do nothing.

1325
01:24:00,151 --> 01:24:03,211
Oh, we'll still speak
because we'll be in the same outfit...

1326
01:24:03,387 --> 01:24:04,911
...and that's the military way...

1327
01:24:05,089 --> 01:24:07,387
...but forget about it.
We'll both be better off.

1328
01:24:08,893 --> 01:24:13,023
- Ben, please...
- Gotta go pack for gunnery school.

1329
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:18,961
Oh, yeah.

1330
01:24:19,136 --> 01:24:23,664
Well, Ben, Sergeant King and me,
we all went to gunnery school together.

1331
01:24:23,841 --> 01:24:25,570
Like The Three Musketeers.

1332
01:24:25,743 --> 01:24:28,940
And they put us on this here squadron
on this here air base?

1333
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:31,411
And it was
way out in the middle of the country.

1334
01:24:31,582 --> 01:24:33,709
You know, out of the way
of the other outfits.

1335
01:24:33,884 --> 01:24:36,853
And the planes
is what they call obsolete...

1336
01:24:37,021 --> 01:24:41,424
...and the officer crews that run them,
well, they wasn't kept up very much either.

1337
01:24:41,592 --> 01:24:45,153
I guess it's what you might call
a second-line-of-defense outfit.

1338
01:24:45,329 --> 01:24:48,389
But, anyhow, Ben and me
was put on the same flight crew...

1339
01:24:48,566 --> 01:24:51,797
...because they put you
according to how you come in your class...

1340
01:24:51,969 --> 01:24:54,665
...and we was the bottom two.

1341
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:57,535
Sergeant King though,
he came out on top.

1342
01:24:57,708 --> 01:25:01,144
He did. The instructor said
they never seen nothing like it.

1343
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:04,509
It was just as if he had copies of the test
before they gave them.

1344
01:25:06,484 --> 01:25:10,545
All right, boys, get this one off
and you can all get back to sleep.

1345
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:20,725
Hey, look at you with an arm band
and a writing pad and everything.

1346
01:25:20,898 --> 01:25:24,334
All right, get on the plane.
You're taking off right now.

1347
01:25:24,502 --> 01:25:26,629
Hey, we can't. Everybody ain't here yet.

1348
01:25:26,804 --> 01:25:29,671
The radio operator and the front gunner,
they ain't showed up.

1349
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,274
KING: All right. Get onboard the plane.
Get moving.

1350
01:25:32,443 --> 01:25:33,933
Clear.

1351
01:25:38,516 --> 01:25:41,417
How come we're going up so early,
sergeant?

1352
01:25:41,585 --> 01:25:43,849
To break the sound barrier.

1353
01:25:44,021 --> 01:25:46,717
You gotta sneak up on it
when nobody's looking.

1354
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:48,719
Oh.

1355
01:26:00,304 --> 01:26:02,636
Excuse me, sir.

1356
01:26:06,544 --> 01:26:09,604
- Excuse me, sirs. Howdy.
- What the...?

1357
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:12,442
It's all right, George.
He's one of the crew.

1358
01:26:12,616 --> 01:26:14,174
Okay, okay.

1359
01:26:14,351 --> 01:26:16,751
Don't come sneaking up
on people like that, fella.

1360
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:20,880
Sorry, sir. I just wanted to see
what you all do up here.

1361
01:26:21,058 --> 01:26:23,322
It's on automatic pilot.

1362
01:26:24,795 --> 01:26:27,923
- Did you already let up the wheels?
- Heck, yes.

1363
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:29,123
Shucks.

1364
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:33,202
- What are you all do in back, anyhow?
- Nothing much.

1365
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:36,862
I mostly look out the blister
and sweep up a little.

1366
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,037
Good night.

1367
01:26:45,182 --> 01:26:47,013
Excuse me, sir.

1368
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:57,022
Take an awful long time
to get to Denver, Colorado.

1369
01:26:57,194 --> 01:26:58,525

Sergeant King just jumped an air policeman
and stole his motorcycle.

my career in the palm of their hands?

figured out too, sir.

Sergeant King was talking about?
