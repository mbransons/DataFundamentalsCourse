1
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:27,032
Are we the first?

2
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,287
Are we the first to arrive here?

3
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:15,539
Is the interpreter with you?

4
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:21,628
I'm not a professional interpreter.
My occupation is cartography.

5
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:23,630
I'm a mapmaker.

6
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:26,759
Can you translate French into English
and English into French?

7
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:30,137
Yes, I explained to the team leader
in Villa Hermosa.

8
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:32,640
I'm just a little taken by surprise.

9
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:01,335
They're all there! All of them!

10
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,932
Check for landing marks!

11
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,502
Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers
off the engine blocks!

12
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:49,717
M-447148!

13
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:54,305
W-445529!

14
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:57,975
Number 445529, check!

15
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:02,730
Approximately 46 gallons
in the right tank!

16
00:05:02,938 --> 00:05:04,773
447149, check!

17
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:07,318
Tell me something.
What's happening here?

18
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,903
- It's flight number 19!
- 19 what?

19
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:13,907
It's that training mission from the
naval air station at Fort Lauderdale.

20
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:17,202
They were doing target runs
on an old hulk.

21
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,830
Who flies crates like these anymore?

22
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,793
No one! These planes were reported
missing in 1945.

23
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,550
But it looks brand-new!

24
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,765
Where's the pilot?

25
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,851
I don't understand!

26
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:43,812
Where's the crew? Hey!

27
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,653
How the hell did it get here?!

28
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:24,853
He says this guy's local.

29
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:27,690
He was here last night.
He saw it happen.

30
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:52,047
Sunburn?

31
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,108
He says the sun came out last night.

32
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:14,862
He says it sang to him.

33
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:53,359
Harry, keep an eye on that point-out.

34
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,611
He's on 122.5.

35
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,321
I'll be right back.

36
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:02,618
Indianapolis Center, you have any
traffic for Air East 31?

37
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,746
Air East 31, negative.

38
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:10,918
The only traffic I have is a TWA L-1011
in your 6 o'clock position...

39
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,420
...range 15 miles...

40
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:17,633
...and an Allegheny DC-9 in
your 12 o'clock position, 50 miles.

41
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:20,719
Stand by. I'll take a look at
broadband, over.

42
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:24,556
Air East 31 has traffic 2 o'clock,
slightly above and descending.

43
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,809
Air East 31, roger.

44
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:30,020
I have a primary target
about that position now.

45
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,981
I have no known traffic.

46
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,316
Stand by, I'll check low, over.

47
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,277
Check and see if they know who it is.

48
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,862
Center, Air East 31.

49
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:41,073
The traffic's not lower than us.

50
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:44,743
He's 1 o'clock now,
still above me and descending.

51
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:48,288
Air East 31,
can you say aircraft type?

52
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:52,835
Negative, Center, no distinct outline.

53
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:57,006
To tell you the truth,
the target is rather brilliant.

54
00:08:57,214 --> 00:09:01,176
It has the brightest anti-collision
lights I think I've ever seen.

55
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:03,512
Alternating white to red.

56
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:05,597
The colours are striking.

57
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:09,059
Center, this is TWA 517.

58
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,521
Traffic now looks lik e
extra-bright landing lights.

59
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,858
I thought Air East
had his landing lights on.

60
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:18,610
It could be a satellite.

61
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,655
I have a primary target now
in your 10 o'clock position...

62
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:22,990
...five miles, over.

63
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:25,367
- Never seen anything like that.
- Affirmative, 31.

64
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:28,996
The traffic is proceeding northeast.
No altitude readout.

65
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:32,124
Roger, Center. It doesn't appear
he'll be a problem.

66
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:35,711
He's going to descend
about 1500 feet below me.

67
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,504
Wait a second!

68
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,006
Stand by one.

69
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,551
Okay, Center, Air East 31.
The traffic has turned.

70
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,180
He's heading for my windshield.
We're turning immediately.

71
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:50,267
Air East 31, descend
and maintain flight level 310.

72
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:52,353
Break Allegheny,
turn right 30 degrees.

73
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:57,191
Get on the horn to the 45th Recon Wing
and see what they're testing up there.

74
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:01,320
Do you have test operations
in restricted area 2508?

75
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:03,113
Air East 31, roger.

76
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:07,409
The traffic is luminous and
exhibiting non-ballistic motion.

77
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:10,329
Roger. Continue descent
at your discretion.

78
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:13,624
Okay, Center. Descent
at pilot's discretion is approved.

79
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:16,794
The traffic is approaching head-on,
ultra-bright and really moving.

80
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:20,714
And right by us! Right now!
Now, that was really close.

81
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:23,759
Air East 31 is out of 340...

82
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:26,095
Ask if they want to report officially.

83
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,265
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.

84
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,607
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.

85
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,654
Negative. We don't want to report.

86
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:47,074
Air East 31,
do you wish to report a UFO? Over.

87
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:51,537
Negative. We don't want
to report one either.

88
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,833
Air East 31, do you wish to
file a report of any kind? Over.

89
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,545
I wouldn't know what kind
of report to file, Center.

90
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:01,797
Air East 31, me neither.

91
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:04,466
I'll try to track traffic
to destination, over.

92
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:36,035
- What are you doing?
- I'm just...

93
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:42,291
What?

94
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:52,926
Barry?

95
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:05,314
Honey?

96
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:17,242
Honey?

97
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:22,623
Barry!

98
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,794
Barry.

99
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:28,962
Barry!

100
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:45,688
Dad, do my problems for me.

101
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:51,276
I don't have to do your problems for
you. You do your problems for you.

102
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:55,072
That's why I graduated,
so I don't have to do problems.

103
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:58,158
I don't understand these fractions.

104
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,620
All right. What's one-third of 60?

105
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:04,415
That's a fraction.
I don't understand them.

106
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,000
All right, look.

107
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,876
Let's say...

108
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:12,464
...that this boxcar is 60 feet long.

109
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,427
And one-third is across
this switch here.

110
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:19,847
All right? Okay?

111
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:24,018
And now another train is coming.

112
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:29,148
How far do you have to move
this boxcar off the track...

113
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,859
...so that the other train
doesn't smash it?

114
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,737
Quickly, Brad, there are thousands
of lives at stake.

115
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:37,364
Brad, any answer.

116
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:41,869
Remember last weekend...

117
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:45,831
...you promised everybody a movie
this weekend?

118
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,168
Honey?

119
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:55,841
- And you also promised Goofy Golf.
- Oh, yeah.

120
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:04,308
Roy, what is all this stuff
on my table?

121
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:07,186
I thought I told you
this was for my stuff.

122
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:09,355
I mean, you can have that table.

123
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:11,106
I don't want this on my table.

124
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:13,484
This can cause tetanus!

125
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:16,320
- What is this?!
- You know what's playing?

126
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,406
Pinocchio!
The kids have never seen Pinocchio.

127
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:22,242
You guys have never seen it.
You'll love it.

128
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:23,702
I don't believe this.

129
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:28,540
Who wants to go see
some dumb cartoon rated G for kids?

130
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,668
- How old are you?
- Eight.

131
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,586
- You wanna be 9?
- Yeah.

132
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:35,464
Then you're gonna see Pinocchio
tomorrow night.

133
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,926
That's a wonderful way
to win over your children.

134
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:43,097
I'm not serious. I'm just saying
that I grew up with Pinocchio.

135
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:46,225
And if kids are still kids,
they're gonna eat it up.

136
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,686
Okay.

137
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:51,313
Okay, I'm wrong.
I'm Wrong Roy, all right?

138
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:55,359
Toby! You are close to death!
Come out here!

139
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:05,202
Okay, now, I'll give you your choice.
I'm not gonna be biased in any way.

140
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:09,540
You can either play Goofy Golf, which
means a lot of waiting and pushing...

141
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:12,084
...or you can see Pinocchio...

142
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:16,588
...which is a lot of furry animals and
magic and a wonderful time. Okay?

143
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:18,507
- Now, let's vote.
- Golf!

144
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:20,342
All right, everybody to bed!

145
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:24,680
No way! Dad said we could finish
watching The Ten Commandments!

146
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,267
Roy, that movie is four hours long.

147
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:30,936
I told them
they'd watch only five commandments.

148
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:32,688
- Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.
- Hi, Earl.

149
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:36,066
We got a big problem.
I need your old man in the field.

150
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:38,277
Roy can't drive at night without me.

151
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:40,654
We're experiencing an overall outage.

152
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:43,824
Wait, wait, wait, I can't... Hey, honey.

153
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:48,078
Jiminy Cricket!
It's Earl on the phone.

154
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:52,583
Just a second.

155
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,792
- Hello.
- Neary.

156
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:57,379
Get into your truck
and report to line N in Tolono.

157
00:17:57,588 --> 00:18:01,592
We're losing power across the grid.
Has the outage hit you yet?

158
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,263
Neary? Neary? Neary?

159
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:15,147
Hey! Lights!

160
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:43,717
Barry!

161
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,394
Barry!

162
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:08,158
Help! I'm lost.

163
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:13,622
You're gonna cough up a little
Tolono, right?

164
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:17,292
Cough up a Tolono
or an interstate, a Highway 90.

165
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:19,837
A little familiar landmark
of some sort.

166
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:23,090
- Cornbread Road, south of 20.
- Cornbread?

167
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,217
Power must have been restored.

168
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:28,637
Couple hundred neighbours think
it's Saturday night.

169
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:29,930
Dispatch, this is 411.

170
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,017
Do you want me to disregard
that Tolono call?

171
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,480
You're in the middle of the road,
jackass!

172
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:42,151
Can you tell me where Cornbread is?
Turkey!

173
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:13,557
A-34... A-34... F-27.

174
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,978
M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-12. Okay.

175
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:21,065
Ten-47.

176
00:20:24,818 --> 00:20:25,903
All right.

177
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,990
Stoppage in the single circuits
will lead you right to nowhere.

178
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,286
M-Mary-10.

179
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,196
Unit 211, 10-30, five, sev...

180
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:42,354
Oh, shit.

181
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:36,719
Unit 211, I'm back up on the street.
What do you guys got out there?

182
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:39,221
I don't believe this!

183
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,016
My God! It's bigger than a house!

184
00:23:44,018 --> 00:23:46,103
This thing is lik e a barn.

185
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:49,315
This is absolutely crazy.

186
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,527
What is your location?

187
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:57,364
Just off the Telemark Expressway
and east toward Harper Valley.

188
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:05,891
Barry.

189
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:08,102
No!

190
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:09,728
Watch out!

191
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,903
Oh, my God! Lady! Lady!

192
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:19,989
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

193
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:23,701
I didn't see him.
He was in the middle of the road.

194
00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:25,995
- Hello?
- Oh, my God.

195
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:29,540
- Hello! Here!
- What's the matter with you?

196
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:34,545
Barry, come back here!
Come on, now.

197
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:06,243
Ice cream!

198
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:28,057
This is nuts.

199
00:26:29,224 --> 00:26:30,726
No.

200
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:12,935
Wait a minute!

201
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:16,105
What are you guys doing? Hey!

202
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:19,024
That's Ohio! That's a quarter!

203
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:27,866
Jesus, look at those suckers.
They're glued to the road!

204
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:17,291
Honey, wake up!

205
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,128
Ronnie, wake up!
You're not gonna believe what I saw!

206
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:23,005
Don't! Not now.

207
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:25,966
No, listen!
I never would have believed it!

208
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:28,761
There was this...
In the cab there was this whole...

209
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:31,430
It went... It was...
There was a red whoosh that...

210
00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:34,808
Roy.

211
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,185
Ike called you.

212
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:38,687
And McGovern.

213
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:41,357
They want you to call.
They couldn't reach you.

214
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:43,192
I turned the radio off.

215
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:45,611
Don't do that.
The phone rang off the hook.

216
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:49,448
It woke Sylvia up two times already.
You'd better call them.

217
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:52,910
You know those pictures in National
Geographic, the aurora borealis?

218
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:55,746
This is better than that. This is really...
Come on!

219
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:57,915
Come on, Ronnie, get up. Come on.

220
00:28:58,123 --> 00:29:00,292
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I don't know.

221
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:02,795
- Get up! I'm not kidding.
- Is it an accident?

222
00:29:02,962 --> 00:29:05,965
It's not an accident. You wanted
to get out of the house, right?

223
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:07,800
Not at 4:00 in the morning.

224
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,553
Ronnie, I need you
to see something with me.

225
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:13,555
It's really important.

226
00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:16,350
Okay. All right.
What about the kids?

227
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:18,310
What? Oh, the kids! I'll get the kids.

228
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:20,562
Sylvia, we're going on an adventure.

229
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,607
Toby! Brad! Come on! Get up.

230
00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:25,359
It's better than Goofy Golf!

231
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:32,116
I'm going as fast as I can!

232
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:34,243
Come on.

233
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:39,415
All right, all right.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Harris.

234
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:41,292
Roy, there's Mrs. Harris.

235
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,045
There better be a good reason for this
because it doesn't make any sense.

236
00:29:46,463 --> 00:29:50,342
All right, Roy, I really think
you've proved your point.

237
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:53,595
Roy. Roy.

238
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:56,015
Roy, you're sunburned. Look at you.

239
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:03,939
Honey, what is that?

240
00:30:08,944 --> 00:30:10,988
Roy, what did it look like?

241
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:14,199
It was like an ice-cream cone.

242
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:17,536
What flavour?

243
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:19,038
Orange.

244
00:30:19,913 --> 00:30:22,458
It was orange.
It wasn't like an ice-cream cone.

245
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,002
It was more like a shell.
You know, like this:

246
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:26,629
Like a taco?

247
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:31,508
Was it like one of those Sara Lee
moon-shaped cookies?

248
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,303
Those crescent cookies?

249
00:30:42,936 --> 00:30:45,481
Don't you think I'm taking this
really well?

250
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:53,072
I remember coming to places like this
just to look at each other.

251
00:30:57,618 --> 00:30:59,119
Snuggle.

252
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:28,727
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

253
00:33:29,478 --> 00:33:30,896
I don't believe it.

254
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:32,147
It's the Cotopaxi.

255
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:35,442
- Why is it here?
- Beats the shit out of me.

256
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:12,104
Is this the bathroom?

257
00:34:29,997 --> 00:34:33,375
Hey, this is not your toy to play with
every time I turn around.

258
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:35,419
He looks like a 50l50 Bar.

259
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:39,256
All right, out of this house.
All of you. Out of my house.

260
00:34:39,506 --> 00:34:41,842
I'm sorry, but you're
not to play with this!

261
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:44,720
Get out while I clean up your mess!

262
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,847
Thank you very much.

263
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,618
Roy, I found
this overnight-tanning stuff.

264
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:11,789
I want you to spray it on half
your face, so it's all one colour.

265
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:15,042
It makes my face look yellow.
What does this remind you of?

266
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:18,087
Then we'll tell everybody
you fell asleep...

267
00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:20,172
...under the sun lamp
on your right side.

268
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:21,757
What for?

269
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:25,803
- Dad, can I ask you a question?
- What?

270
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,471
Are they for real?

271
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,766
That's what for.
No, they are not for real.

272
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:33,310
Go outside and have a hot dog, okay?

273
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,145
Ronnie, don't tell him that.

274
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:39,024
Roy, look, don't talk about this until
you know what you're talking about.

275
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:43,278
If I can't talk about it,
how will I know what's going on?

276
00:35:43,529 --> 00:35:46,407
- What?
- Mom, I believe in them.

277
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:49,994
- I believe in them too.
- Oh, no, you don't.

278
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:51,870
Dad says we do.

279
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:53,914
No, he does not.

280
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:57,042
- Do you, Roy?
- Ronnie.

281
00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:00,713
All I wanna do is know
what's going on.

282
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:04,091
Nothing's going on!
It's just one of those things.

283
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:06,093
Which things? Which things?

284
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:09,471
- I don't wanna hear about this.
- This is very important!

285
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:12,558
I won't let it lay here.
I'm gonna call somebody!

286
00:36:12,766 --> 00:36:14,935
I'm not listening. I'm not listening.

287
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:17,855
I saw something last night
that I can't explain.

288
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:22,526
I saw something last night
I can't explain.

289
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,780
I'm going out there again tonight.

290
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:32,244
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

291
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:35,539
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

292
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,418
No, you're not.

293
00:36:39,627 --> 00:36:40,961
Do they live on the moon?

294
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:45,424
They got bases there so at night
they can come through your window.

295
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:48,761
This isn't a moonburn, goddamn it!

296
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:51,889
- You came through my window.
- You hurt me!

297
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:54,767
- You took all my covers.
- Roy's not like that.

298
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:57,561
He loves his work. Don't say that!

299
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,230
What did he do?
He was with us all night!

300
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:01,940
I won't have to go tonight.

301
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:04,902
He is not like that at all!

302
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:07,488
Stop yelling at me!

303
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:09,948
Can't you tell him about this?

304
00:37:10,157 --> 00:37:11,450
Hello?

305
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:13,535
I can't believe it.

306
00:37:13,744 --> 00:37:15,037
Roy...

307
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:17,039
...you got fired.

308
00:37:17,998 --> 00:37:20,084
They didn't even wanna talk to you.

309
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:36,785
Where were the sounds coming from?

310
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:06,523
Where did these sounds come from?
Tell us, please.

311
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:36,095
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

312
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:44,478
I beg your pardon,
but my English is not good too.

313
00:39:47,272 --> 00:39:48,899
I want to share with you now...

314
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:52,444
...the breakthrough
that happened in India.

315
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,864
We think it means something.

316
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:59,827
We think it is important.

317
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:05,374
To help you learn, I am using the hand
sign created by Zoltán Kodály.

318
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,755
Kodály developed these signs
to teach music to deaf children.

319
00:41:36,924 --> 00:41:38,384
Hello?

320
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:40,260
Hi.

321
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:42,846
Hi, how are you? You came here too?

322
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:44,598
Yes. Jillian Guiler.

323
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:47,059
Roy Neary.
Sorry about what happened.

324
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:50,312
- Good night!
- What?

325
00:41:52,022 --> 00:41:54,233
Look at you.

326
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:59,363
You got the same burn.

327
00:41:59,613 --> 00:42:03,492
Yeah, but it's better on you.
You got it all over at least.

328
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:06,203
I gotta tan the other side tonight.

329
00:42:06,787 --> 00:42:08,872
How's the kid? I'm really sorry.

330
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:10,582
I'll be right back.

331
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,836
Raise your head a bit
and give me a smile. Come on.

332
00:42:14,003 --> 00:42:17,172
He's a little young for a record,
don't you think?

333
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,319
Weird.

334
00:42:40,154 --> 00:42:44,742
I know this sounds crazy, but
ever since yesterday on the road...

335
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:47,411
...l've been seeing this shape.

336
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:52,791
In shaving cream and pillows...

337
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:09,266
Damn it, I know this!
I know what this is.

338
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:16,565
This means something.

339
00:43:22,988 --> 00:43:24,823
This is important.

340
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:28,577
- Here they come!
- Get the camera!

341
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:32,164
- Out of the northwest!
- Jimmy, come here.

342
00:43:46,095 --> 00:43:48,931
It's like Halloween for grownups.

343
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:52,101
Trick or treat.

344
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:24,425
Wait a minute!

345
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:18,604
Here are the patterns.

346
00:45:18,854 --> 00:45:22,316
- We received two 15-minute broadcasts.
- Non-random signals?

347
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:26,278
104 rapid pulses. After a five-second
interval, 40 pulses.

348
00:45:26,528 --> 00:45:28,906
Another five-second break,
and 30 pulses.

349
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:35,913
Silence, then a new set of numbers.
40, break five. 36, break five. Ten.

350
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:38,290
- 104 rapid pulses.
- Lord!

351
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,252
Wait 60 seconds and the
whole doggone thing repeats.

352
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:45,631
- Where are the signals from?
- The neighbourhood.

353
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,800
Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds.

354
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,177
Well within the plane
of the ecliptic.

355
00:45:50,427 --> 00:45:55,265
Are these non-random signals here,
40, 36, 10, in response to that?

356
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:58,894
No. They should be. We've sent
this combination out for weeks.

357
00:45:59,061 --> 00:46:01,105
But all we're getting back
are numbers.

358
00:46:06,652 --> 00:46:10,364
This could mean the India sounds
reached a dead end.

359
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:11,991
They don't mean a thing.

360
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:14,243
There's so much we don't know.

361
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:17,079
How about where the signals originate?

362
00:46:20,082 --> 00:46:21,458
Excuse me.

363
00:46:23,752 --> 00:46:25,754
What letter is 104?

364
00:46:28,173 --> 00:46:29,508
Excuse me.

365
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,806
Before I got paid to speak French...

366
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:40,519
...I used to read maps.

367
00:46:42,688 --> 00:46:44,982
This first number is a longitude.

368
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:52,072
I've got two sets of three numbers.

369
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:55,242
Degrees, minutes and seconds.

370
00:46:55,451 --> 00:46:59,663
The first number has three digits,
and the last two are below 60.

371
00:47:00,623 --> 00:47:03,834
It's not in the right ascension
and declination on the sky.

372
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,588
These have to be Earth coordinates.

373
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:09,798
There's a globe in the office.

374
00:47:13,302 --> 00:47:14,637
This is what we need.

375
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:17,348
Maybe there's a release pin
underneath here.

376
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:20,059
That's a $2500 globe!
What are you doing?

377
00:47:20,225 --> 00:47:23,020
- It's heavy, watch your feet.
- Let me hit the mother.

378
00:47:38,285 --> 00:47:42,122
All right, everybody, quiet down!
Hold it down! Quiet!

379
00:47:45,334 --> 00:47:46,710
That's not right.

380
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:49,213
The antenna. How dumb!

381
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:51,173
- Which way's it pointing?
- Northeast.

382
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:52,883
That's Wyoming.

383
00:47:59,723 --> 00:48:02,184
We'll need a geodetic survey map
of Wyoming.

384
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:04,269
I want it to the square yard.

385
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,606
The Army has a geodetic
survey map of Wyoming.

386
00:48:07,773 --> 00:48:09,858
We not only need...

387
00:49:59,426 --> 00:50:01,053
Toys!

388
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:04,098
Toys!

389
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,801
Oh, my God!

390
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,916
You can come and play now.

391
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,960
You can come and play now.

392
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:03,926
Come in through the door.

393
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:09,139
One, two, three...

394
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:19,274
Oh, honey.

395
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:21,610
Mom, look! The sun's here!

396
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:26,824
Oh, honey.

397
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:29,326
Oh, my God!

398
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:08,949
Go away!

399
00:53:33,182 --> 00:53:34,600
Clean everything up!

400
00:53:50,866 --> 00:53:52,993
- Mom, let me listen!
- Wait a minute! Wait.

401
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:12,179
- Mom, look!
- Oh, my God.

402
00:54:20,854 --> 00:54:23,273
Come in through the door.

403
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:49,341
Barry! Barry!

404
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,686
Jillian. Jillian.

405
00:55:03,731 --> 00:55:04,982
May we have a statement?

406
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,068
The report you gave to the police
was spectacular.

407
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,404
We need it for the 6:00 news.

408
00:55:13,073 --> 00:55:14,366
They got him.

409
00:55:14,533 --> 00:55:15,576
What?

410
00:55:15,784 --> 00:55:18,370
Is it true you're leaving
to look for your son?

411
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:21,832
- Has there been a ransom note?
- Where will you start looking?

412
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:26,337
His name is Barry.

413
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:29,298
Where is your husband now,
Mrs. Guiler?

414
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,345
Are you involved in any
kind of parapsychologies?

415
00:55:35,346 --> 00:55:37,389
Turn around, please. Turn around!

416
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,853
You gave the police a report.
Would you mind repeating it?

417
00:55:46,857 --> 00:55:49,985
Folks, you can go in now. Room 3655.

418
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:53,781
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a flying saucer.

419
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,115
That's the one I saw!

420
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:01,288
I swear that's the same one!
It's the one I saw!

421
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:05,209
It's made of pewter, made in Japan...

422
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:08,504
...and thrown across the lawn
by one of my children.

423
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:14,551
I wanted to point out that we're
not all "polished brass" about this.

424
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,680
And also point out that last year...

425
00:56:17,888 --> 00:56:20,891
...Americans shot more than seven
billion photographs...

426
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:26,146
...at a record of $6.6 billion
for film equipment and processing.

427
00:56:26,313 --> 00:56:28,232
Now, with all those
shutters clicking...

428
00:56:28,399 --> 00:56:31,193
...where is the indisputable
photographic evidence?

429
00:56:31,402 --> 00:56:34,780
I've been in the news
business for a long time.

430
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,909
We never took a picture
of a plane crash as it happened...

431
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:42,746
...or an automobile accident
and get it on the 6:00 news.

432
00:56:50,879 --> 00:56:54,258
There are lots of ideas
that would be fun to believe in.

433
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:56,302
Mental telepathy...

434
00:56:56,552 --> 00:56:58,053
...time travel...

435
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:00,097
...immortality...

436
00:57:00,723 --> 00:57:02,599
...even Santa Claus.

437
00:57:03,225 --> 00:57:07,396
I know it's no fun to go home and
say, "Guess what happened today?

438
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:11,317
I was in the shopping centre,
and there was this bright light...

439
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:13,777
...and I rushed outside...

440
00:57:13,986 --> 00:57:15,988
...and it was an aeroplane."

441
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,199
Excuse me, sir.
I didn't want to see this.

442
00:57:20,534 --> 00:57:21,827
I sure wish I had.

443
00:57:22,077 --> 00:57:23,996
For 15 years I've been looking...

444
00:57:24,246 --> 00:57:27,249
...for these damn silly lights
in the night sky.

445
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,126
I've never found any.

446
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:32,254
I'd like to, because
I believe in life elsewhere.

447
00:57:32,713 --> 00:57:34,006
Why don't you admit...

448
00:57:34,214 --> 00:57:37,968
...that the Air Force is conducting
tests in the Foothills area?

449
00:57:38,177 --> 00:57:40,846
It would be easy to say yes to that.

450
00:57:41,555 --> 00:57:45,225
But I'm not going to mislead you.
This is not the case.

451
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:47,811
I don't know what you saw.

452
00:57:48,062 --> 00:57:50,439
You can't fool us by agreeing with us.

453
00:57:50,648 --> 00:57:52,107
No, come on!

454
00:57:52,441 --> 00:57:54,360
I saw Bigfoot once.

455
00:57:59,198 --> 00:58:03,369
1951. Back in Sequoia National Park.

456
00:58:03,577 --> 00:58:07,831
Had a foot on her, 37 inches.
Heel to toe.

457
00:58:11,752 --> 00:58:15,255
Made a sound I would not want
to hear twice in my life.

458
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:23,013
I believe I've encountered
that gentleman myself.

459
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:26,767
I was sitting on the porch,
looking through the screen.

460
00:58:26,976 --> 00:58:29,353
I seen this big white dot in the sky.

461
00:58:29,561 --> 00:58:31,855
It turned red and blue and green.

462
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:41,573
UFOs do not represent a direct
physical threat to national security.

463
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,328
We do not support them,
and we encourage you not to.

464
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:27,161
Let's get in touch with
the forest service...

465
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:31,081
...or we'll end up in a wilderness
area with vehicular traffic.

466
00:59:31,457 --> 00:59:35,252
And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff
for those folks in Wyoming.

467
00:59:41,675 --> 00:59:44,219
If this mission fully develops...

468
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:50,142
...I get white knuckles thinking about
what might be ahead for those folks.

469
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:53,103
Your flight will be at 2000 hours.

470
00:59:53,312 --> 00:59:56,982
We have a limo that'll take you
to the heliport now.

471
00:59:57,524 --> 01:00:01,070
And transportation will be provided
on the other end.

472
01:00:03,572 --> 01:00:06,200
- I like the flash-flood idea.
- Where do you get the water?

473
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,035
We've had about two inches of rain...

474
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:11,830
We'll tell them one of the reservoirs
is gonna burst.

475
01:00:11,997 --> 01:00:14,625
Besides, there's not enough water
in those reservoirs!

476
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:18,170
Wait! Contaminated water
affects people, crops, animals.

477
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,588
Disease.

478
01:00:19,797 --> 01:00:22,466
- Yeah, epidemic.
- What kind of disease?

479
01:00:22,716 --> 01:00:23,759
A plague epidemic.

480
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:26,095
Nobody will believe a plague.

481
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,681
- Anthrax.
- Ranching country.

482
01:00:28,889 --> 01:00:31,225
There are a lot of sheep in the hills.

483
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:32,685
Good, I like that.

484
01:00:32,893 --> 01:00:35,938
- It'll create a panic.
- But it may not evacuate everybody.

485
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:39,108
There's always some joker
who thinks he's immune.

486
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:45,322
I need something so scary
it'll clear 300 square miles...

487
01:00:45,531 --> 01:00:48,409
...of every living Christian soul.

488
01:01:19,648 --> 01:01:21,358
Help yourself.

489
01:01:24,403 --> 01:01:28,907
I hate these potatoes.
There's a dead fly in my potatoes.

490
01:01:29,116 --> 01:01:30,409
It's okay.

491
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:18,809
Well, I guess you've noticed...

492
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:24,106
...something is a little strange
with Dad.

493
01:03:27,318 --> 01:03:29,069
It's okay, though.

494
01:03:31,363 --> 01:03:33,032
I'm still Dad.

495
01:03:38,078 --> 01:03:42,124
I can't describe it,
what I'm feeling...

496
01:03:42,374 --> 01:03:44,710
...and what I'm thinking.

497
01:03:47,338 --> 01:03:49,548
This means something.

498
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,093
This is important.

499
01:04:04,229 --> 01:04:06,023
That's not right.

500
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:11,320
It's not right.

501
01:04:13,447 --> 01:04:15,240
That's not right.

502
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,354
What is it?

503
01:04:46,897 --> 01:04:49,233
What is it?!

504
01:04:56,615 --> 01:04:58,367
It's not fair.

505
01:05:03,872 --> 01:05:05,374
Tell me.

506
01:05:30,149 --> 01:05:34,236
Roy? Roy.

507
01:05:35,154 --> 01:05:36,947
Open the door, please.

508
01:05:38,032 --> 01:05:42,244
Please. Roy. Roy!

509
01:05:42,411 --> 01:05:44,079
Open this door!

510
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:46,248
Open this door!

511
01:05:51,879 --> 01:05:53,380
All right.

512
01:06:14,693 --> 01:06:17,613
I don't think I know
what's happening to me.

513
01:06:23,619 --> 01:06:28,248
Look, Roy. What it is,
is family therapy.

514
01:06:28,457 --> 01:06:31,168
I mean, we all go. We all talk.

515
01:06:31,418 --> 01:06:35,381
No one is singled out.
Maybe it's not your fault anyway.

516
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:40,302
- It's waterproof. It still works.
- Roy! Promise me you'll go!

517
01:06:40,844 --> 01:06:43,889
You crybaby! You crybaby!

518
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:45,975
- You crybaby!
- Get out of here!

519
01:06:46,225 --> 01:06:47,393
Get out!

520
01:06:47,601 --> 01:06:50,020
Come on, you guys. Come on.

521
01:06:50,187 --> 01:06:51,939
You crybaby!

522
01:06:52,189 --> 01:06:53,732
- Be quiet!
- Stop it!

523
01:06:53,983 --> 01:06:55,567
I don't understand it!

524
01:06:55,818 --> 01:06:58,279
- Neither do I.
- Get out!

525
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:01,448
Go to your room and close the door.

526
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:05,494
- Ronnie?
- Yes.

527
01:07:05,744 --> 01:07:09,915
I'm really scared.
I want you to help me.

528
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,252
All this bullshit!
It's turning this house upside down!

529
01:07:13,419 --> 01:07:15,838
- Ronnie, just...
- I just hate you! That's why!

530
01:07:16,088 --> 01:07:17,798
- No!
- Ronnie. Ronnie.

531
01:07:17,965 --> 01:07:21,302
Hold me. Put your arms
around me. It'll really help me.

532
01:07:21,552 --> 01:07:22,720
It'll really help me.

533
01:07:22,928 --> 01:07:25,681
Listen! Listen!
Don't you see what's happening?

534
01:07:26,223 --> 01:07:28,225
None of our friends call us anymore!

535
01:07:28,434 --> 01:07:30,644
You're out of work! You don't care!

536
01:07:30,853 --> 01:07:33,480
You're wrecking us!
You're ruining us!

537
01:07:33,939 --> 01:07:36,442
- Ronnie, just hold on.
- No! No!

538
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:37,901
- Hold on.
- No!

539
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,739
Ronnie.

540
01:07:42,323 --> 01:07:44,241
Ronnie?

541
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:48,537
Ronnie, open the door now.
Come on.

542
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:26,909
Well, what do you know?
It's disintegrated.

543
01:08:30,037 --> 01:08:33,916
Happy birthday, you thing from
another world, you.

544
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,043
Thank you!

545
01:08:43,092 --> 01:08:45,052
Well, I guess he's had enough.

546
01:08:47,513 --> 01:08:49,848
Are you going to yell at me?

547
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:08,450
Ronnie? Everything's fine.

548
01:09:18,669 --> 01:09:20,754
All this stuff is coming down.

549
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:28,470
It's all gonna be like it was.

550
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:41,734
That's the last straw!
Now I use my secret weapon!

551
01:10:10,971 --> 01:10:12,765
Roy?

552
01:10:12,931 --> 01:10:16,644
Roy, I'm sorry about last night. Roy!

553
01:10:19,688 --> 01:10:21,941
Roy, what are you doing?

554
01:10:22,942 --> 01:10:24,443
Jesus!

555
01:10:33,786 --> 01:10:35,079
The plants are fine there!

556
01:10:36,497 --> 01:10:37,706
Can you hear me?

557
01:10:38,374 --> 01:10:39,541
Wait!

558
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,752
Wait! What are you doing?

559
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:43,128
You're gonna love it!

560
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:45,756
- What do you mean?
- You'll really love this.

561
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:48,676
Roy, what are you doing?

562
01:10:54,139 --> 01:10:55,849
Oh, Roy!

563
01:10:56,642 --> 01:10:57,685
My God!

564
01:10:59,353 --> 01:11:00,813
Come on, men!

565
01:11:02,314 --> 01:11:06,527
Dad, after this, can we
throw dirt in my window?

566
01:11:10,114 --> 01:11:11,448
Stop it.

567
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,410
Stop. Stop it.

568
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,078
Honey!

569
01:11:16,704 --> 01:11:21,041
If I don't do this, that's when
I'm gonna need a doctor.

570
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:25,713
What are you doing?

571
01:11:25,963 --> 01:11:27,631
- I got it.
- What are you doing?

572
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,302
I figured it out, that's all.
Will you just listen?

573
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:36,473
You ever look at something crazy, and
then see it another way and it's not?

574
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,683
No, I haven't.

575
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:39,935
Come on, Ronnie. Just listen.

576
01:11:40,144 --> 01:11:42,521
- I don't know what you're doing.
- Close your eyes.

577
01:11:42,688 --> 01:11:46,108
Close your eyes and hold your breath,
everything will be really pretty.

578
01:11:47,318 --> 01:11:48,360
You're scaring us now.

579
01:11:48,569 --> 01:11:51,655
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
I feel really good.

580
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:53,657
Everything's gonna be all right.

581
01:11:53,866 --> 01:11:55,993
I haven't felt this good in years.

582
01:11:56,243 --> 01:11:58,412
Everything's gonna be okay.
I can feel it.

583
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:04,627
- Now what else? What else?
- Like this? Like this?

584
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:07,171
Right.

585
01:12:46,168 --> 01:12:47,461
Like this?

586
01:12:50,339 --> 01:12:51,715
Chicken wire.

587
01:13:02,184 --> 01:13:04,269
Whatever you're doing,
it's against the law!

588
01:13:04,436 --> 01:13:06,105
He's putting it back, Mrs. Harris.

589
01:13:06,313 --> 01:13:07,398
I'll pay you for this.

590
01:13:07,564 --> 01:13:08,607
Take it. Take it.

591
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:10,609
I'm perfectly fine.

592
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:12,945
Let go of this fence.
Come with me.

593
01:13:13,153 --> 01:13:16,031
Do you want me to hit you?
Let go of that fence!

594
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,617
Toby! Listen to me. Listen to me.

595
01:13:18,826 --> 01:13:20,536
Come on, right now.
We're going.

596
01:13:20,786 --> 01:13:23,914
- I want to stay here!
- Let go of the fence! Come on.

597
01:13:42,182 --> 01:13:44,351
Stay! Stay!

598
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:50,733
- Where we going?
- Where we going?

599
01:13:50,941 --> 01:13:52,651
- Where are we going?
- Get in the car.

600
01:13:52,818 --> 01:13:55,779
- Where are we going?
- Quietly, quickly, get in.

601
01:13:56,196 --> 01:13:57,406
Get in there, Toby.

602
01:13:57,865 --> 01:13:58,907
Quickly.

603
01:14:02,036 --> 01:14:04,496
- Dad needs some more help!
- Lock the doors!

604
01:14:04,705 --> 01:14:06,040
Dad needs some more help!

605
01:14:06,248 --> 01:14:09,752
Quiet! Just lock the doors.
Roll up those windows.

606
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,463
Dad needs some more help!

607
01:14:12,713 --> 01:14:14,298
Honey, where you going?

608
01:14:14,506 --> 01:14:16,425
- What?
- Where are you going?

609
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:19,637
Taking the kids to my sister's.

610
01:14:21,096 --> 01:14:23,307
That's crazy.
You're not even dressed.

611
01:14:24,433 --> 01:14:25,517
What?

612
01:14:25,893 --> 01:14:27,269
You said what?

613
01:14:32,274 --> 01:14:33,943
Ronnie, wait!

614
01:14:34,193 --> 01:14:36,195
Ronnie, hold it.

615
01:14:37,696 --> 01:14:39,114
Would you hold it one minute?

616
01:15:06,392 --> 01:15:07,434
Morning.

617
01:15:46,974 --> 01:15:50,144
What is wrong with me today?

618
01:15:56,233 --> 01:15:57,484
Who is it, please?

619
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:02,114
It's the mailman. There's a package
for Julie Anderson.

620
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,245
You can just leave it at the door!

621
01:16:09,913 --> 01:16:14,251
I can't do that.
I'm supposed to C. O.D. Lik e that.

622
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:15,794
And besides...

623
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:19,214
...you and I have to have
a little talk...

624
01:16:20,215 --> 01:16:21,800
...about Kim.

625
01:16:41,362 --> 01:16:44,239
Lik e sands through the hourglass...

626
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:47,451
...so are the Days of Our Lives.

627
01:17:13,185 --> 01:17:16,981
Good evening. At the top of the news
tonight, a rail disaster.

628
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:19,066
At Devil's Tower, Wyoming...

629
01:17:19,275 --> 01:17:22,736
...a trainload of dangerous
chemical gas went off the rails...

630
01:17:22,945 --> 01:17:25,572
...and forced the widest
area evacuation...

631
01:17:25,781 --> 01:17:29,034
...in the history of these
controversial Army rail shipments.

632
01:17:29,243 --> 01:17:32,579
Whenever you want me to.
Tomorrow is fine.

633
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,667
I can do other things.

634
01:17:37,376 --> 01:17:39,628
I'm trying to be.

635
01:17:40,963 --> 01:17:42,006
Yes, I am.

636
01:17:42,214 --> 01:17:45,175
The Army and National Guard are
supervising the evacuation.

637
01:17:45,592 --> 01:17:50,055
I am an adult, okay?
Even though there's no such thing.

638
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:51,890
It was a joke!

639
01:17:52,099 --> 01:17:54,852
- The danger will be over
within 72 hours.

640
01:17:55,519 --> 01:17:58,314
Ronnie, anything you want.

641
01:17:58,647 --> 01:18:01,275
Anything you want, I'll do.

642
01:18:04,236 --> 01:18:05,738
For how long?

643
01:18:11,744 --> 01:18:13,370
All of you?

644
01:18:14,705 --> 01:18:19,251
No. Ronnie, I wanna talk
about this in person.

645
01:18:20,336 --> 01:18:23,881
This is not... We can't talk
about this on the telephone.

646
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:27,926
Ronnie! Don't hang up!
Just don't...

647
01:18:28,093 --> 01:18:34,224
- meat should remain unaffected.
This means order your steak well-done.

648
01:18:34,391 --> 01:18:37,561
Devil's Tower, Wyoming was
the first national monument...

649
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:41,523
...erected in this country by
Theodore Roosevelt in 1915.

650
01:18:41,774 --> 01:18:45,277
Thousands of civilian refugees
are fleeing the area...

651
01:18:45,486 --> 01:18:48,906
...spurred by rumours that the
overturned tank er cars...

652
01:18:49,156 --> 01:18:53,661
...at Walkashi Needles Junction were
filled to capacity with nerve gas.

653
01:18:53,827 --> 01:18:55,496
In a few minutes,
we're going to be...

654
01:18:55,704 --> 01:18:59,249
- boasts 400, 000 vacationers.

655
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:02,127
Fortunately, during this mishap
there have been no fatalities.

656
01:19:02,336 --> 01:19:04,880
- Evacuate this area,
which soon...

657
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:08,801
...will become the "hot zone,"
depending on the prevailing winds.

658
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:12,805
This is as close to the disaster
as we've been allowed to get.

659
01:19:13,055 --> 01:19:15,724
- Due to a strong prevailing
north-south wind.

660
01:19:15,933 --> 01:19:18,727
Army engineers and the
Wyoming National Guard...

661
01:19:18,936 --> 01:19:22,439
...are making every effort to
contain the leaking toxins...

662
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:25,818
...and evacuate an area of almost
200 square miles.

663
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:29,405
Everyone is being warned:
Stay out of the area.

664
01:19:29,655 --> 01:19:32,658
Everyone, please,
stay out of the area.

665
01:19:32,741 --> 01:19:34,910
- And thousands of others
are homeless.

666
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:39,540
U.S. Army Materiel Command has
issued these new area restrictions:

667
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:42,167
All roadways north of Crowheart on
Interstate 25.

668
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:43,377
Shit.

669
01:19:43,544 --> 01:19:46,755
All roads leading into the
Grand Tetons west of Meteste.

670
01:19:46,964 --> 01:19:49,883
All multilane undivided
full-traffic interchange...

671
01:19:50,092 --> 01:19:54,054
...railroad, local and historic
stage roads south of Cody.

672
01:20:04,356 --> 01:20:07,234
Why aren't there fat lines
instead of these thin ones?

673
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:10,362
Yo!

674
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:14,116
- Holy mother of...
- You're going the wrong way!

675
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:18,996
Yo! Turn back around. Back this way.

676
01:20:19,622 --> 01:20:21,165
What's the matter with you?

677
01:20:21,457 --> 01:20:23,000
Yes, sir. Sorry, officer.

678
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:26,086
It's just a rental, officer.
Just a rental.

679
01:20:26,879 --> 01:20:28,213
My fault! My fault!

680
01:20:28,464 --> 01:20:30,758
Starting with the letter "F,"
as in "Frank"...

681
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:33,177
...to the letter "J" as in "Jack"...

682
01:20:33,385 --> 01:20:37,765
...please find your way to the loading
platform for immediate boarding.

683
01:20:41,393 --> 01:20:43,729
You'll be real disappointed
and sorry...

684
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:48,442
...if you don't have an early-warning
system, such as a bird, a gas mask.

685
01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:50,778
Why, even my dog has a gas mask.

686
01:20:50,986 --> 01:20:53,656
And any of you folks are
worth more than a dog.

687
01:20:56,408 --> 01:21:00,037
Roy? Roy!

688
01:21:01,664 --> 01:21:03,666
Roy!

689
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:18,097
Roy?

690
01:21:21,225 --> 01:21:22,977
Roy?

691
01:21:25,354 --> 01:21:26,897
Roy!

692
01:21:28,107 --> 01:21:30,025
Roy.

693
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:34,071
Roy!

694
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:41,704
I don't care where you go,
just get behind the barricade!

695
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:45,082
There's no way out!

696
01:22:08,564 --> 01:22:09,607
What are we doing?

697
01:22:09,815 --> 01:22:13,193
Only way to get back is cross-country.
We'll break through the fence.

698
01:22:13,402 --> 01:22:15,237
- Let's go.
- All right, hold on. Hold on.

699
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:41,680
The police dragged the river for him.

700
01:22:41,889 --> 01:22:44,808
I told them he wasn't in the river.
He wasn't.

701
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:49,730
Then they went around to every house
within five miles...

702
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:54,818
...looking inside
back-yard refrigerators.

703
01:22:58,864 --> 01:23:02,242
They asked if I'd seen any strangers
in the neighbourhood.

704
01:24:10,394 --> 01:24:12,605
I don't believe it's real.

705
01:24:14,732 --> 01:24:16,775
I don't believe it's real.

706
01:24:18,027 --> 01:24:19,486
It's real.

707
01:24:26,076 --> 01:24:29,330
Let's get down there. Get some gas
and get down in there.

708
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:33,584
What are those?

709
01:24:58,025 --> 01:25:02,196
Look, I guarantee you.
This whole thing is a put-on.

710
01:25:49,118 --> 01:25:51,412
What do you want?
Get your hands off!

711
01:25:53,706 --> 01:25:56,125
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine!

712
01:25:56,834 --> 01:26:00,170
According to my birds, the only bad air
is from you guys farting around!

713
01:26:11,307 --> 01:26:13,225
- Move them out!
- What's happening?

714
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,728
- What? Where are we going?
- Go to the van.

715
01:26:15,894 --> 01:26:17,271
Where are you taking her?

716
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:19,565
Hold it! Why can't we go together?

717
01:26:19,732 --> 01:26:20,774
Watch your step.

718
01:26:21,275 --> 01:26:22,818
Roy.

719
01:26:39,084 --> 01:26:42,087
We have very little time, Mr. Neary.
This is Mr. Lacombe.

720
01:26:42,254 --> 01:26:44,506
- Hello.
- We need answers from you...

721
01:26:44,673 --> 01:26:46,800
...that are honest, direct
and to the point.

722
01:26:47,009 --> 01:26:48,135
Where is Jillian?

723
01:26:50,429 --> 01:26:53,557
Do you realise the danger you
and your friend have risked?

724
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,895
In coming here, you've
exposed yourself to toxic gas.

725
01:26:58,103 --> 01:26:59,688
Well, I'm alive.

726
01:26:59,897 --> 01:27:01,273
We're talking.

727
01:27:02,274 --> 01:27:04,318
This is true, Mr. Neary.

728
01:27:05,235 --> 01:27:08,614
But if the wind blew from
the south instead of the north...

729
01:27:10,032 --> 01:27:12,242
...this conversation would not be
taking place.

730
01:27:12,451 --> 01:27:14,328
There's nothing wrong with the air.

731
01:27:15,829 --> 01:27:17,414
What makes you say that?

732
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:19,917
I just know.
There's nothing wrong with it.

733
01:27:20,459 --> 01:27:22,670
Go outside and make me a liar.

734
01:27:26,882 --> 01:27:29,301
I wanna talk to the man in charge.

735
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,887
Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority.

736
01:27:32,262 --> 01:27:34,098
He isn't even an American.

737
01:27:36,475 --> 01:27:39,436
Mr. Neary, are you an artist
or a painter?

738
01:27:40,604 --> 01:27:41,647
No.

739
01:27:45,276 --> 01:27:48,362
Have you been hearing a persistent
ringing in your ears?

740
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:50,406
Almost an agreeable ringing?

741
01:27:50,614 --> 01:27:51,657
No.

742
01:27:53,075 --> 01:27:55,244
Having headaches, migraines?

743
01:27:55,744 --> 01:27:56,829
Yeah.

744
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,124
An irritation in your eyes
and your sinuses?

745
01:28:00,374 --> 01:28:01,500
Yeah.

746
01:28:02,626 --> 01:28:05,838
Do you have hives?
Do you have allergies?

747
01:28:07,923 --> 01:28:10,175
And burning on your face
and on your body?

748
01:28:10,384 --> 01:28:12,970
- Yes. Who are you people?
- Look at this.

749
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:16,223
I got one like it in my living room.
Who are you people?

750
01:28:22,104 --> 01:28:24,607
Monsieur Neary, please,
one more question.

751
01:28:26,358 --> 01:28:28,944
Have you recently had
a close encounter?

752
01:28:30,112 --> 01:28:33,198
A close encounter
with something very unusual?

753
01:28:36,118 --> 01:28:38,245
Who are you people?

754
01:28:44,793 --> 01:28:48,756
- These people strangers to you?
- Yeah. Except for her.

755
01:28:50,966 --> 01:28:53,802
And the two of you felt compelled
to be here?

756
01:28:54,928 --> 01:28:56,805
Yeah, you might say that.

757
01:28:57,306 --> 01:29:00,559
- But what did you expect to find?
- An answer.

758
01:29:02,186 --> 01:29:04,104
That's not crazy, is it?

759
01:29:20,371 --> 01:29:23,374
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

760
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:24,792
Is that it?

761
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:28,212
Is that all you're gonna ask me?

762
01:29:29,129 --> 01:29:31,632
Well, I got a couple of thousand
goddamn questions.

763
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,053
I wanna speak to someone in charge.
I wanna lodge a complaint.

764
01:29:36,428 --> 01:29:38,722
You have no right
to make people crazy.

765
01:29:38,931 --> 01:29:43,143
You think I investigate every
Walter Cronkite story there is?

766
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,231
If this is just nerve gas, how come I
know everything in such detail?

767
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:49,191
I've never been here before.

768
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,069
How come I know so much?

769
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:54,280
What the hell is going on
around here?!

770
01:29:54,488 --> 01:29:56,532
Who the hell are you people?!

771
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:23,475
Is that it?! Answer me!

772
01:30:24,184 --> 01:30:27,605
I didn't come this far to get
taken on any bus ride home!

773
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:52,296
Five minutes. Five!

774
01:30:52,963 --> 01:30:55,174
We're gonna hold
for a couple of minutes.

775
01:31:29,124 --> 01:31:32,461
You brought 12 people to
the decontamination camp...

776
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:37,091
...instead of the evacuation centre
where they belong. Why?

777
01:31:37,299 --> 01:31:40,135
- Because this means something.
- This means something.

778
01:31:42,012 --> 01:31:45,266
These people have come from
all over their country...

779
01:31:47,017 --> 01:31:50,437
...to a place they've been told
will endanger their lives.

780
01:31:50,646 --> 01:31:51,772
Why?

781
01:31:52,022 --> 01:31:55,734
Because somebody could be trying
to subvert this whole operation...

782
01:31:55,985 --> 01:31:59,446
...by sending in fanatics, cultists
and Christ knows what all.

783
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,782
Yes.

784
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,868
Thank you very much.

785
01:32:07,037 --> 01:32:09,498
This is a small group of people...

786
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:14,211
...who have shared a vision in common.

787
01:32:14,837 --> 01:32:16,005
Look.

788
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:22,219
It's still a mystery to me
why they are here.

789
01:32:22,469 --> 01:32:24,471
Even they do not know why.

790
01:32:43,115 --> 01:32:44,867
Jillian!

791
01:32:45,951 --> 01:32:47,911
- Jillian.
- Don't! You'll be poisoned!

792
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:51,582
Listen, there's nothing wrong
with the air around here.

793
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:55,794
The Army's getting us out because
they don't want any witnesses.

794
01:32:56,462 --> 01:32:59,798
If the Army doesn't want us here,
it's none of our business.

795
01:33:00,049 --> 01:33:03,594
We wanted to see the mountain.
It was a coincidence when I painted it.

796
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:05,429
You can take it off!

797
01:33:05,638 --> 01:33:08,432
The air here is better
than in Los Angeles.

798
01:33:09,391 --> 01:33:13,187
Listen. How many of you people are
for getting out of here?

799
01:33:18,734 --> 01:33:22,237
I don't know what's happening either.
I must find out what's going on.

800
01:33:26,992 --> 01:33:31,705
For every one of these anxious,
anguished people who've come here...

801
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:38,963
...there must be hundreds more touched
by the vision who never made it here.

802
01:33:39,964 --> 01:33:42,883
Simply because they never watch
the television.

803
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:47,846
Or perhaps they watched it, but never
made the psychic connection.

804
01:33:48,097 --> 01:33:51,892
It's a coincidence. It's not scientific.

805
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:56,313
Listen to me, Major Walsh...

806
01:33:56,522 --> 01:33:59,066
...it is an event sociological.

807
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:20,129
Hey! Wait a minute!

808
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:38,188
- My name's Neary!
- Larry Butler!

809
01:34:38,397 --> 01:34:40,065
- How are you?
- Okay! You?

810
01:34:40,316 --> 01:34:42,109
- Fine, fine!
- That's good!

811
01:34:42,735 --> 01:34:47,197
Everybody keep their masks on until
you're out of here and out of danger.

812
01:34:47,406 --> 01:34:51,619
Listen, we wanna get out of here!
What's the matter with you?

813
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:10,179
- Major Walsh, Major Walsh.
- Yes, sir.

814
01:35:10,346 --> 01:35:12,973
I'll have the rest of them
off the mountain in one hour.

815
01:35:13,182 --> 01:35:15,935
Major, I want you to use infrared...

816
01:35:16,143 --> 01:35:18,687
...and get me a photo analysis of
the northern face.

817
01:35:18,896 --> 01:35:20,940
Yes, sir, it's already been ordered.

818
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:23,233
Major Walsh, listen.

819
01:35:23,442 --> 01:35:26,987
I don't lik e to do this. We're in
enough trouble with these cattlemen.

820
01:35:27,237 --> 01:35:31,116
If you can't get these folks
out of the area by 2000 hours...

821
01:35:31,367 --> 01:35:33,661
...start dusting with EZ-4.

822
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:35,537
What's EZ-4?

823
01:35:35,788 --> 01:35:39,166
It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we
used with the livestock.

824
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,834
Comes out of Riot Control.

825
01:35:41,043 --> 01:35:44,964
They'll sleep for six hours and
wake up with a headache, that's all.

826
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:48,884
We didn't choose this place.
We didn't choose these people!

827
01:35:49,134 --> 01:35:51,220
They were invited!

828
01:35:57,268 --> 01:35:59,645
They belong here more than we.

829
01:36:07,361 --> 01:36:09,029
I shouldn't have given up jogging.

830
01:36:09,238 --> 01:36:12,616
See that notch in the mountain?
We'll make it in no time.

831
01:36:12,825 --> 01:36:14,410
Here come three more.

832
01:36:17,371 --> 01:36:19,331
The authority in this park...

833
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:23,085
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

834
01:36:23,419 --> 01:36:25,963
There's a ravine leading straight up.

835
01:36:26,171 --> 01:36:29,091
- It's an easier climb.
- It's no good.

836
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,928
When you get to the top, it's
a 300-foot drop down. Get down!

837
01:36:33,137 --> 01:36:35,723
What do you think is
down on the other side?

838
01:36:36,432 --> 01:36:39,560
There's a box canyon on the other side
with ravines and trails...

839
01:36:39,768 --> 01:36:41,979
...if you take this incline
to the right.

840
01:36:42,187 --> 01:36:44,982
I never imagined that.
I only painted one side.

841
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:48,110
- There was no canyon in my doodles.
- Next time, sculpt.

842
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:51,238
You give us a lot of credit.
That's an hour's climb.

843
01:36:51,447 --> 01:36:52,615
Come on, let's go.

844
01:36:58,162 --> 01:37:00,748
The authority in this park...

845
01:37:00,956 --> 01:37:05,252
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

846
01:37:05,461 --> 01:37:10,007
You are entering
a military reservation...

847
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:12,926
...and subject to military law.

848
01:37:13,135 --> 01:37:14,720
Call the bastard.

849
01:37:18,599 --> 01:37:20,601
Bahama, this is Pyramid. Over.

850
01:37:20,851 --> 01:37:22,019
Go ahead.

851
01:37:22,227 --> 01:37:24,563
Nothing to report at midstation.

852
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:27,650
Up ahead there's thousands
of places to hide.

853
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,862
We'll need three times the men
to cover this in one hour.

854
01:37:32,154 --> 01:37:35,324
Get everybody off the northern face,
call the dark side of the moon...

855
01:37:35,574 --> 01:37:37,284
...and tell them we're gonna dust.

856
01:38:04,019 --> 01:38:05,396
Get down!

857
01:38:06,397 --> 01:38:09,191
You are entering a military
reservation...

858
01:38:09,441 --> 01:38:13,028
...and subject to military law.

859
01:38:42,641 --> 01:38:45,561
Larry! Larry, come on!

860
01:39:03,078 --> 01:39:06,248
Larry! Don't let them see you!
Get down!

861
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:45,996
They're just crop-dusting.
Los Angeles!

862
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:52,920
- Larry?
- Don't stop!

863
01:39:53,504 --> 01:39:55,422
Don't look back! Come on, come on!

864
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:20,531
Roy!

865
01:40:26,829 --> 01:40:29,623
Hurry! We're only 10 feet
from the top.

866
01:40:29,873 --> 01:40:32,876
Just a few more feet! We can
slide down the other side!

867
01:40:40,217 --> 01:40:42,720
Come on, hurry. I'll come down.

868
01:40:42,886 --> 01:40:43,929
Don't come down.

869
01:40:44,972 --> 01:40:46,682
Come on, come on. Come on!

870
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:49,018
- Don't worry. We'll make it.
- Roy.

871
01:40:49,184 --> 01:40:51,312
Come on. Come on. Move it.
Move your ass!

872
01:40:51,562 --> 01:40:52,980
Come on.

873
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:01,363
Roy, come on. Come on.
Please, come on.

874
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:03,616
Hurry!

875
01:41:05,868 --> 01:41:06,952
Hold it!

876
01:41:11,123 --> 01:41:12,249
Jump! Jump!

877
01:41:25,304 --> 01:41:28,349
- Do you see that?
- Oh, yes.

878
01:41:29,058 --> 01:41:30,184
Good.

879
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:33,771
Is it on?
Check the speak er system here.

880
01:41:33,979 --> 01:41:36,148
I want this up all the way.

881
01:41:39,151 --> 01:41:40,694
Are you reading me on this one?

882
01:41:41,487 --> 01:41:42,780
How about here?

883
01:41:45,032 --> 01:41:49,286
- Testing. Testing.
- Okay, one, two, three, four.

884
01:41:50,204 --> 01:41:51,956
Testing. Testing.

885
01:41:52,164 --> 01:41:55,292
One, two, three, testing.

886
01:42:02,633 --> 01:42:06,428
Gentlemen, ladies.
Tak e your positions, please.

887
01:42:07,638 --> 01:42:09,598
This is not a drill.

888
01:42:09,807 --> 01:42:13,310
I repeat, this is not a drill.

889
01:42:14,311 --> 01:42:17,982
Could we have the lights
in the arena down 60 percent, please?

890
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:20,067
60 percent.

891
01:42:24,405 --> 01:42:28,200
I don't think we could ask for
a more beautiful evening, do you?

892
01:42:37,042 --> 01:42:39,420
Okay, watch the skies, please.

893
01:42:40,129 --> 01:42:45,092
We now show uncorrelated targets
approaching from the north-northwest.

894
01:43:35,017 --> 01:43:38,103
We're the only ones who know.
The only ones.

895
01:43:47,738 --> 01:43:49,323
You see that?

896
01:43:51,367 --> 01:43:52,493
Yes.

897
01:43:53,285 --> 01:43:54,328
Good.

898
01:44:42,751 --> 01:44:47,256
All ground personnel not
D-class approved...

899
01:44:47,464 --> 01:44:51,302
...please evacuate the centre
approach mark er.

900
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:56,348
Audio analysis personnel,
behind the double yellow line.

901
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:04,857
ITC, stereo, time and resistance.

902
01:45:05,524 --> 01:45:06,942
Auto ready?

903
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:10,404
- Tone interpolation on interlock.
- Altitude and tabling.

904
01:45:10,613 --> 01:45:12,615
ARP and interlock now.

905
01:45:13,157 --> 01:45:15,659
Speed set at seven and a half.

906
01:45:15,868 --> 01:45:19,121
All positive functions, standing by.

907
01:45:43,562 --> 01:45:44,813
Go ahead.

908
01:45:45,147 --> 01:45:46,273
- Sunset.
- Go.

909
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:50,069
Okay. Start with the tone.

910
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:58,285
- Tang.
- Go.

911
01:45:59,328 --> 01:46:01,121
Up a full tone.

912
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:06,126
Down a major third.

913
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,379
Now drop an octave.

914
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:14,718
- Cool blue.
- Go.

915
01:46:14,969 --> 01:46:16,971
Up a perfect fifth.

916
01:46:19,556 --> 01:46:21,433
Nothing. Nothing at all.

917
01:46:26,397 --> 01:46:27,606
Give me a tone.

918
01:46:28,065 --> 01:46:30,276
- "Re" to the second.
- Up a full tone.

919
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:32,361
- "Mi" to the third.
- Down a major third.

920
01:46:32,569 --> 01:46:34,655
- "Do" to the first.
- Drop an octave.

921
01:46:34,863 --> 01:46:36,573
"Do" up a perfect fifth.

922
01:46:36,782 --> 01:46:38,450
"Sol" to the fifth.

923
01:46:54,591 --> 01:46:55,843
I know that.

924
01:46:58,637 --> 01:46:59,805
Faster.

925
01:47:15,613 --> 01:47:16,739
Kick that mule!

926
01:47:20,993 --> 01:47:22,453
Let's go!

927
01:48:04,244 --> 01:48:05,704
I'm very happy tonight.

928
01:48:06,121 --> 01:48:07,873
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

929
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:11,794
Not a Merle Haggard, but it was great.

930
01:48:31,438 --> 01:48:32,815
Mr. Lacombe?

931
01:48:39,405 --> 01:48:42,116
What is it? What's happening?

932
01:49:37,713 --> 01:49:40,299
Come on. Come on, let's go.

933
01:49:41,926 --> 01:49:43,385
Keep down.

934
01:49:49,224 --> 01:49:50,809
They're talking way over my head.

935
01:51:00,379 --> 01:51:02,298
- Shit.
- Duck, duck!

936
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:39,710
Photo one.

937
01:51:39,918 --> 01:51:43,297
Fantastic! Keep those reloads coming.

938
01:51:43,505 --> 01:51:45,049
Fantastic!

939
01:51:51,722 --> 01:51:53,807
- You wanna see better?
- I can see fine.

940
01:51:54,058 --> 01:51:57,144
- We can't stay here.
- I can.

941
01:51:58,103 --> 01:52:01,690
- Why?
- Because Barry's not here.

942
01:52:02,608 --> 01:52:04,610
I'm just not ready.

943
01:52:08,447 --> 01:52:10,574
I can't stay.
I've gotta get down there.

944
01:52:10,824 --> 01:52:12,326
I know.

945
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:50,030
This is data control to all personnel.

946
01:52:50,447 --> 01:52:53,659
We monitor no biologic hazards.

947
01:52:53,867 --> 01:52:56,203
Range safety clear.

948
01:54:03,729 --> 01:54:06,482
Oh, my God.

949
01:54:59,994 --> 01:55:02,204
Oh, my God.

950
01:55:26,186 --> 01:55:27,479
Holy shit.

951
01:57:19,550 --> 01:57:21,802
There is a safety-hazard zone...

952
01:57:22,011 --> 01:57:25,889
...extending 25 metres from the ship.

953
01:57:26,307 --> 01:57:31,145
Special teams are exempt and
should be aware of low gravity.

954
01:57:31,395 --> 01:57:35,816
Expect some dizziness,
and look out for a static charge.

955
01:57:38,110 --> 01:57:41,947
All departments at operational
during this phase...

956
01:57:42,197 --> 01:57:44,366
...signify by beeping twice.

957
01:57:44,575 --> 01:57:47,620
If everything's ready here on
the dark side of the moon...

958
01:57:48,037 --> 01:57:49,622
...play the five tones.

959
01:58:59,149 --> 01:59:01,777
Give her six quavers, then pause.

960
01:59:02,903 --> 01:59:04,238
She sent us four quavers...

961
01:59:04,446 --> 01:59:07,741
...a group of five quavers,
a group of four semiquavers.

962
01:59:22,214 --> 01:59:24,466
All these phrases have
in common are five signals.

963
01:59:24,633 --> 01:59:27,970
- Hope somebody's taking all this down.
- What are we saying to each other?

964
01:59:28,137 --> 01:59:30,889
It seems they're trying to teach us
a basic tonal vocabulary.

965
01:59:31,098 --> 01:59:32,474
It's the first day of school.

966
01:59:40,816 --> 01:59:43,819
Take everything from the lady.
Follow her pattern note for note.

967
02:00:00,628 --> 02:00:03,213
We have a translation interlock
on their audio signal.

968
02:00:03,422 --> 02:00:05,799
We're taking over
this conversation now.

969
02:01:07,569 --> 02:01:09,405
Let's go! Come on!

970
02:02:46,126 --> 02:02:47,962
I am Claude Lacombe.

971
02:02:51,382 --> 02:02:52,800
Frank Taylor...

972
02:02:53,050 --> 02:02:55,594
...Lieutenant J.G., United States
Navy Reserve...

973
02:02:55,803 --> 02:02:57,721
...064199.

974
02:02:57,930 --> 02:03:00,224
Lieutenant, welcome home.

975
02:03:00,683 --> 02:03:02,434
This way to debriefing.

976
02:03:02,768 --> 02:03:03,811
Harry Ward Craig...

977
02:03:04,061 --> 02:03:06,146
...Captain, United States Navy...

978
02:03:06,355 --> 02:03:08,649
...043431.

979
02:03:08,857 --> 02:03:12,111
Captain, would you come
right this way?

980
02:03:13,988 --> 02:03:16,448
Welcome back, Navy. Welcome back.

981
02:03:18,367 --> 02:03:21,537
"Craig, Harry Ward.
Captain, United States Navy...

982
02:03:21,745 --> 02:03:23,789
...0434311."

983
02:03:24,081 --> 02:03:27,251
Disappeared off Chicken Shoals,
flight 19.

984
02:03:29,253 --> 02:03:32,965
Matthew McMichael, Lieutenant,
United States Naval Reserve...

985
02:03:33,549 --> 02:03:35,884
...0909411.
- Lieutenant.

986
02:03:36,093 --> 02:03:37,720
Good to have you back.

987
02:03:38,679 --> 02:03:40,889
Furlow, Otis B...

988
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:44,059
...Lieutenant J. G.,
United States Navy.

989
02:03:44,268 --> 02:03:47,354
They haven't even aged.
Einstein was right.

990
02:03:47,563 --> 02:03:49,690
Einstein was probably one of them.

991
02:03:50,274 --> 02:03:52,526
Erickson, David A...

992
02:03:52,735 --> 02:03:55,821
...Lieutenant J. G.,
United States Navy...

993
02:03:56,113 --> 02:04:00,075
...0639552.

994
02:04:01,201 --> 02:04:03,579
Henkle, Robert F...

995
02:04:03,787 --> 02:04:07,207
...Lieutenant J. G.,
United States Navy...

996
02:04:34,485 --> 02:04:39,573
Went missing July 1955,
Pensacola, Florida.

997
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:41,075
Monsieur Neary...

998
02:04:41,825 --> 02:04:43,494
...what do you want?

999
02:04:46,372 --> 02:04:49,541
I just wanna know that
it's really happening.

1000
02:04:52,836 --> 02:04:57,716
I went up in the air,
and I saw our house.

1001
02:04:57,925 --> 02:05:01,011
I saw you going up in the air.
Did you see me running after you?

1002
02:05:01,178 --> 02:05:03,555
- Yes.
- Yes?

1003
02:05:07,309 --> 02:05:09,395
All right, now we have to talk.

1004
02:05:12,273 --> 02:05:14,275
He wants to speak about
Mr. Neary's case.

1005
02:05:14,566 --> 02:05:17,152
Swensen, Matthew Daniel...

1006
02:05:17,361 --> 02:05:20,948
...reported missing April 1976.

1007
02:05:21,782 --> 02:05:24,618
- Are they going away?
- Yes.

1008
02:05:28,956 --> 02:05:30,040
Wait a second, wait.

1009
02:05:30,249 --> 02:05:34,336
He says these are ordinary people
under extraordinary circumstances.

1010
02:05:35,546 --> 02:05:38,757
Delores, Rudolph E...

1011
02:05:38,966 --> 02:05:42,553
...reported missing
December '51, Bisbee...

1012
02:05:43,053 --> 02:05:44,597
...Arizona.

1013
02:05:48,559 --> 02:05:50,394
Goodbye.

1014
02:06:00,779 --> 02:06:01,822
Monsieur Neary...

1015
02:06:03,991 --> 02:06:05,492
...I envy you.

1016
02:08:03,861 --> 02:08:06,697
I'm told we can count on your
complete cooperation.

1017
02:08:06,947 --> 02:08:09,450
- What's your blood type?
- I don't know.

1018
02:08:09,658 --> 02:08:12,369
- What's your birth date?
- December 4th, 1944.

1019
02:08:12,536 --> 02:08:14,997
Have you been inoculated against
smallpox, diphtheria?

1020
02:08:15,247 --> 02:08:18,250
Is there any liver disease
in your family?

1021
02:09:17,351 --> 02:09:19,895
May the Lord be praised at all times.

1022
02:09:20,104 --> 02:09:22,815
May God help us and grant us
a happy journey.

1023
02:09:23,065 --> 02:09:24,358
Show us your ways.

1024
02:09:24,566 --> 02:09:26,443
And lead us along your paths.

1025
02:09:26,694 --> 02:09:30,239
God has given you
his angels charge over you.

1026
02:09:30,489 --> 02:09:34,034
Grant these pilgrims, we pray,
a happy journey...

1027
02:09:34,285 --> 02:09:39,206
...and peaceful days, so that with
your holy angel as a guide...

1028
02:09:39,415 --> 02:09:42,918
...they may safely reach their
destination...

1029
02:13:24,181 --> 02:13:25,557
Bye!
