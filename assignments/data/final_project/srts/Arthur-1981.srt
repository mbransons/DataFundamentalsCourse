Hello, girls!

4
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,620
Would the more attractive
of you please step forward?

5
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,900
God! That's funny!

6
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,420
No, actually,
you're both very attractive.

7
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,220
Would the one who thinks l'm
attractive please step forward?

8
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,100
Quickly as possible!
Time is money!

9
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,460
What'd you have in mind?

10
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,670
VD l'm really into penicillin.

11
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,100
Now that's funny!

12
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,460
Actually, what l had in mind. . .

13
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,900
. . .was spending the evening
with a stranger who loves me.

14
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,790
lt's going to cost you $1 00.

15
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,820
Oh, yeah?
What time do you get off work?

16
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,420
No, l'm kidding!

17
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,020
Let's make it $200.
But l will ask you to Simoniz my car.

18
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,500
Has there been a death
in your family?

19
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,110
This is funny stuff here.

20
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,830
Let's go.

21
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,140
Bitterman, give her. . .

22
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,860
. . .give her friend $1 00.
She came in second.

23
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,220
Who is that guy?

24
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,660
l'd rather not say.

25
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,380
l think l know.
l saw his picture in the paper.

26
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,740
-That's Arthur Bach, isn't it?
-What if it is?

27
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,420
ls there something wrong with him?

28
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,500
Yes.

29
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,420
Permit me to introduce myself.

30
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,420
Where in the hell's my hat?

31
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,950
lt's on the floor.

32
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,620
l hate it when that happens.

33
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,820
l am Arthur.

34
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,750

35
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,460
-l am Arthur.
-Yeah. What're you drinking?

36
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,380
Scotch. Would you like some?

37
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,460
Why not?

38
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,300
You're with me and
you can ask that question?

39
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,380
What's so funny now?

40
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,540
l sometimes just
think funny things!

41
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,630
What do you do for a living?

42
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,020
l race cars. l play tennis...

43
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,100
...l fondle women, but...

44
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,060
...l have weekends off
and l am my own boss.

45
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,940
The Plaza, and step on it!

46
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,420
Sir, if l may say so. . . .

47
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,820
Go through the park.

48
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,860
You know how l love the park!

49
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,710
Can l have another drink?

50

lsn 't fun the best thing to have?!

52
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,540
Don 't you wish you were me?

53
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,300

54
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,540

55
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,430

56
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,830

57
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,910
Are you hurt, sir?

58
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,150
l fell out of the car!

59
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,860
lsn't that the funniest thing ever?

60
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,740
You had to be there, right?

61
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,580
You are quite amusing, sir.

62
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,750
Please get my drink.
After all, we're going to the bar.

63
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,100
Thank you so much.

64
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,220
Madame, l'm sorry,
but we have absolutely no--

65
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,740
Don't give me any stuff, buster!

66
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,900
lt's all right,
the lady's with me.

67
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,580
Mr. Bach! How good to see you!

68
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,390
lf only someone
l knew felt that way!

69
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,740
We have your regular table,
Mr. Bach.

70
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,620
l know you have it,
but is anyone sitting at it?

71
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,500
lt's all right. They're used
to seeing me with the turtle.

72
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,980
Uncle Peter! And Aunt Pearl!

73
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,380
You're looking well.

74
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,460
Thank you!

75
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,940
Aunt Pearl, may l say
you're looking younger every day.

76
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,100
Doesn't Aunt Pearl
look wonderful, darling?

77
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,020
She looks great.

78
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,190
We haven't had the pleasure
of meeting this young woman.

79
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,830
Would you introduce us?

80
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,820
How stupid of me!

81
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,340
Princess Gloria, may l
introduce my aunt and uncle. . .

82
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,460
. . .Peter and Pearl Bach.

83
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,300
How are you?

84
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,620
Princess? Did you say
''Princess,'' Arthur?

85
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,260
There's a very small country
in the West lndies. l mean small.

86
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,070
l see. Thank you.

87
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,620
lt's terribly small.
Tiny little country.

88
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,100
Rhode lsland could
beat the crap out of it in a war.

89
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,620
That's how small it is.

90
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,100
lt's small.

91
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,140
lt's very little. . . .

92
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,300
lt's 85 cents in a cab
from one end to the other.

93
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,860
l'm talking small!

94
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,100
We understand it's small, Arthur.

95
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,790
They recently had
the whole country carpeted.

96
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,100
This is not a big place.

97
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,100
We understand that it's small, Arthur.

98
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,860
And we also understand
that you are very drunk.

99
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,820
So why don't we meet again
when you're sober?

100
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,420
Yeah, l'm sorry.
l can't help it.

101
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,260
Grow up, Arthur.
You'd make a fine adult.

102
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,660
That's easy for you to say.

103
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,630
You haven't got
50 pairs of short pants. . .

104
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,820
. . .hanging in your closet!

105
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,580
lt's the regular table!
Wait a minute. . .

106
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,430
. . .regular chair.

107
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,100
How rich are you?

108
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,060
All l can tell you is. . .

109
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,230
. . .l wish l had a dime
for every dime l have.

110
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,460
The service here is terrible.
Where the hell's my drink?

111
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,820
-We just ordered!
-That's always their excuse.

112
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,420
Engine room,
where the hell's my drink?!

113
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,740
Are you married?

114
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,460
There's only one woman for me.

115
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,380
And l can't stand her.

116
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,380
Her name is Susan.

117
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,340
l can't tell you her last name.
lt would be indiscreet.

118
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,780
Johnson.

119
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,860
Susan Johnson.

120
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,750
My father wants me to marry her. . .

121
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,510
. . .but l'm not going to!

122
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,620
You're the only woman at this table.

123
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,430
Sure, you bring her a bottle,
me you bring a glass.

124
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,660
Fine. Thank you very much.

125
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,420
Aren't waiters wonderful?

126
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,820
You ask them for things,
and they bring them.

127
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,030
Same principle as Santa Claus.

128
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,300
Tell me about yourself.

129
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,470
You mean, why l'm a hooker?

130
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,060
Are you a hooker?

131
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,310
Jesus, l forgot!

132
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,900
l thought l was
doing great with you.

133
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,740
Why are you a hooker?

134
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,260
My mother died when l was six.

135
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,380
Son of a bitch!

136
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,460
Don't they know
what they do to kids?!

137
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,780
My father raped me when l was 1 2.

138
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,710
So you had six
relatively good years.

139
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,700
l'm sorry.

140
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,420
Listen, my father screwed me too.

141
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,820
Do you like me?

142
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,750
You're cute.

143
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,700
l know that!

144
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,620
But do you like me?

145
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,710
Well, Princess,
we're going to have fun!

146
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,020
Tonight is New Year's Eve!
Third time this week!

147
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,230
Here's to you!

148
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,020
Noisy!

149
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,380
Hello, darling.

150
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,230
Good morning.

151
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,420
Did you sleep well?

152
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,740
-Fine.
-Good.

153
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,060
Please stop that!

154
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,300
Hobson how good to see you!

155
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,700
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all.

156
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,180
l've taken the liberty of
anticipating your condition. . .

157
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,820
. . .and l've brought you orange juice,
coffee and aspirins.

158
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,780
Or do you need to throw up?

159
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,100
Gloria, l would like you
to meet Hobson.

160
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,910
My best friend in the world.

161
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,420
l relish the compliment.

162
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,470
lt is thrilling to meet you, Gloria.

163
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,780
You obviously have a wonderful
economy with words, Gloria.

164
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,020
l look forward to your next
syllable with great eagerness.

165
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,020
As we all can see,
it's a lovely day.

166
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,230
Which would seem to indicate
that the night is over.

167
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,820
l have arranged breakfast
for you on the east patio.

168
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,140
This is a robe.
Please put it on.

169
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,620
Say goodbye to her, Arthur.

170
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,220
Do you know what
l'm going to do?

171
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,870
No, l don't.

172
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,620
l'm going to take a bath.

173
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,990
l'll alert the media.

174
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,220
Do you want to
run my bath for me?

175
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,190
lt's what l live for.

176
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,860
Perhaps you'd like me to
wash your dick for you. . .

177
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,620
. . .you little shit.

178
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,820
You'd better watch out
You'd better not cry

179
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,580
You'd better not pout
l'm telling you why

180
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,900
Santa Claus is coming to town

181
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,550
Hobson, this is Arthur.

182
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,060
Yes! How delightful
to hear from you.

183
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,620
How about a pitcher of martinis?

184
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,020
No, thank you.

185
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,780
l'm not going
to face my father sober.

186
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,820
lf you don't bring them
l'll have someone else do it!

187
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,790
l'll bring them.

188
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,830
-Say goodbye.
-Goodbye.

189
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,380
He treats me like a kid.

190
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,220
You know, Arthur. . .

191
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,020
. . .your father is going
to demand that you marry Susan.

192
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,140
l don't care what he demands.

193
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,940
Stay with me a minute, Hobson.
You know l hate to be alone.

194
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,060
Yes. Bathing is a lonely business.

195
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,260
Except for fish.

196
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,710
l beg your pardon?

197
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,020
Did you say ''except for fish''?

198
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,220
Fish all bathe together.

199
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,390
Although they do tend
to eat one another.

200
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,860
l often think. . .

201
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,790
. . .fish must get
awfully tired of seafood.

202
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,430
What are your thoughts, Hobson?

203
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,510
Pardon me. . . .

204
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,420
l don't want you to be alone.

205
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,380
l'll never be alone.
l have you.

206
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,340
lsn't life wonderful, Hobson?

207
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,940
Yes, Arthur, it is.
Do your armpits.

208
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,500
A hot bath is wonderful!

209
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,340
Girls are wonderful!

210
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,350
lmagine how wonderful
a girl who bathes would be!

211
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,740
Get dressed!

212
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,020
l hate it here.

213
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,860
Of course you hate it.
People work here.

214
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,180
Here, read this magazine.
There are many pictures.

215
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,740
Look how nobody ever smiles here.

216
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,860
Why doesn't anybody ever smile here?

217
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,940
They smile at lunchtime.

218
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,540
Lower your voice, Arthur.
And sit up.

219
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,660
Stop being so nervous.

220
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,860
Later on, we'll get ice cream.

221
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,020
Your father will see you now.

222
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,660
Come on, Hobson.

223
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,900
He wants to see you alone.

224
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,700
He gets all that money.

225
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,220
Pays his family back
by being a stinking drunk.

226
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,420
lt's enough to make you sick.

227
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,820
l really wouldn't know, sir.
l'm just a servant.

228
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,580
On the other hand. . .

229
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,270
. . .go screw yourself.

230
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,230
The press has a good time
with you, Arthur.

231
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,500
''Millionaire Drunk Playboy. ''

232
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,260
You're the weakest man
l've ever known!

233
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,700
l despise your weakness!

234
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,940
l'm afraid we have to talk.

235
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,020
l'm not going to marry her!
l've told you a thousand times!

236
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,260
Fine. lf that's your decision,
the family has no choice.

237
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,900
l'm sorry, Arthur, very sorry.

238
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,030
But as of this moment, you are. . .

239
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,140
. . .cut off.

240
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,540
You mean cut off from. . .

241
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,460
. . .you and Grandmother
and the family?

242
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,020
So you mean cut off
from the. . . .

243
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,820
You don't mean cut off from the--

244
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,700
The money, Arthur.

245
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,830
Your grandmother and l have had
all the papers drawn up.

246
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,830
We want this marriage, Arthur.

247
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,710
l want it. Burt Johnson wants it.

248
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,230
Burt Johnson!

249
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,030
He's a criminal!

250
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,220
We all are, Arthur.

251
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,940
And as you know. . .

252
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,940
. . .we usually get what we want.

253
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,140
Frankly, Father,
l'd rather starve.

254
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,300
And l will.

255
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,030
l'll get married when
l fall in love.

256
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,700
Fine. l respect your integrity.

257
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,620
You've just lost
750 million dollars.

258
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,940
Actually, Susan is
a very nice girl.

259
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,990
And she'll make a wonderful wife.

260
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,900
Yes, wonderful.

261
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,620
Have you ever seen her face. . .

262
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,860
. . .when the light
catches it just right?

263
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,860
She's really quite beautiful.

264
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,220
Of course, you can't depend
on that light.

265
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,820
The wedding is a month from today.

266
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,820
The invitations will be
mailed tonight.

267
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,820
Ever taste her chicken?

268
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,860
She does spectacular
things with a chicken.

269
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,740
And l love a chicken made at home.

270
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,820
This is the ring your grandfather
gave to your grandmother.

271
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,910
She wants you to
give it to Susan.

272
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,180
This is to marry one girl?

273
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,420
Don't do this to me.

274
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,900
l've been waiting for you
to grow up. l can't wait any longer.

275
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,700
Congratulations, Father, you win.

276
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,340
l had every intention of winning.

277
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,350
Congratulations to you, Arthur.

278
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,180
You're going to be wealthy
for the rest of your life.

279
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,260
That's all l've ever wanted to be.

280
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,900
l'll take three dozen of these shirts.
Assorted colors.

281
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,300
l hate my father.

282
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,580
Then purchase four dozen.

283
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,700
Four dozen.

284
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,940
And l want. . .

285
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,620
. . . 1 4 of these sweaters, all green.

286
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,420
-All green?
-l don't wear sweaters.

287
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,430
Send them to
my address, will you?

288
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,660
What else can l buy, Hobson?

289
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,180
Hobson! Did you see that?!

290
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,900
She stole that tie!

291
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,460
lt's a perfect crime!
Girls don't wear ties.

292
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,420
Although some do. lt's not a perfect
crime, but it's a good crime.

293
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,500
lf she murdered the tie
it'd be a perfect crime.

294
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,420
Why are you so happy
about all this?

295
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,860
The man following her
is a security guard.

296
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,460
We've got to be calm!

297
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,550
lsn't she beautiful? Jesus!

298
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,260
May l ask what have
we to do with this?

299
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,940
l beg your pardon, miss.

300
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,460
l'm the security guard
in the store.

301
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,500
You don't need the badge.

302
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,980
No customer would
wear that jacket.

303
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,750
l must look in the bag.

304
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,630
l saw you put something in it.

305
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,220
You got trouble, mister.

306
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,300
You'll never work on the East Coast
again. What's your name?

307
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,700
She's sensational!

308
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,590
She does have a certain
Eleanor Roosevelt quality.

309
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,020
What's your address?

310
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,540
The address, Chester!
l'm not fooling!

311
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,620
l saw you put a tie in that bag!

312
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,150
What did you say?!

313
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,700
All right, that's it!
l want a cop!

314
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,620
Get me a cop!
We need a cop here!

315
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,540
Don't move from where you are.

316
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,300
l don't want you out of my sight!

317
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,190
Get me a cop!
Get your hands off me.

318
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,060
l'm Arthur Bach.
l'll straighten this out.

319
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,990
Mr. Bach, you really should
stay out of this.

320
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,060
Well, he's in it, Chester.
Tell him, Alfred.

321
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,300
l know this woman.
We're shopping together.

322
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,660
Where the hell have you been?

323
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,470
l'm sorry darling.
l got caught up.

324
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,700
She's a friend, Mr. Bach?

325
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,630
He just said that, Chester.
You're such a schmuck.

326
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,540
l asked her to pick out a tie.

327
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,340
l was going to put it on my bill.

328
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,020
-You didn't pay for it?
-l forgot. l'm sorry.

329
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,820
Chester, what can l say?
l had no idea.

330
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,790
May l look at the tie?

331
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,020
Oh, God, that's really lovely.

332
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,020
-l hope you like it.
-You're really wonderful.

333
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,140
Not in front of
all these people, dear.

334
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,750
They might think you're an animal.

335
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,660
Mr. Bach, you understand,
it's my job.

336
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,830
Would you ask the lady at
the counter to put this on my bill?

337
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,900
l'll take care of it, Mr. Bach.
Thank you very much.

338
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,270
Were you scared?

339
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,220
Why are you smiling
at me like that?

340
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,260
l see.

341
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,230
You're a little strange. . .

342
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,700
. . .but cute.
How are you?

343
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,020
Have a nice day. Thank you very much.
l'll go to the bus stop now.

344
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,100
Why did you steal that tie?

345
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,980
l don't know.

346
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,660
l'm a wonderful person!

347
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,020
l'm serious.

348
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,180
l'll be with you in a minute.
He's getting on my nerves.

349
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,380
Will you stop smiling
at me like that?

350
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,220
You look like
one of Santa's helpers.

351
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,700
ls he with us?

352
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,620
My name is Arthur,
and this is Mr. Hobson.

353
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,270
Good afternoon.

354
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,260
Good afternoon?

355
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,790
My name is Linda.

356
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,340
l'd like to thank you very much.
You did a nice thing.

357
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,420
That was an interesting kiss.

358
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,230
-You kiss your wife like that?
-l'm not married.

359
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,980
Keep smiling. 688-5549.

360
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,270
Don't expect big things
on the first date.

361
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,150
Yes, it's been a distinct
pleasure meeting you.

362
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,620
Arthur, we really must be going.

363
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,820
Thank you for
a memorable afternoon.

364
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,230
Usually one must go to a bowling alley
to meet a woman of your stature.

365
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,710
Wouldn't it be funny
if he called me?

366
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,030
Arthur, l see no reason
for prolonging this conversation.

367
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,500
Unless you're planning. . .

368
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,620
. . .to knock over a fruit stand
later in the evening.

369
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,390
Good luck in prison.

370
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,660
Who was the tie for?

371
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,220
A guy.

372
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,380
Look how he stopped smiling.
My father. lt's his birthday.

373
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,860
What are you doing tomorrow night?

374
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,180
l don't know.

375
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,300
l have plans for tomorrow night.
What should l wear?

376
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,150
Steal something casual.

377
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,020
-l like him.
-Likewise, l'm sure.

378
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,060
l'll have Bitterman
drive you home.

379
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,150
You don't have to do that.

380
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,420
Bitterman doesn't
have to take me.

381
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,220
l really hardly ever
take the bus, ever.

382
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,020
-But it's so hard to get a cab.
-Of course.

383
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,300
l'm sure we know a lot
of the same people.

384
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,060
-Get in.
-Right.

385
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,110
Tell Bitterman where to take you.
And make sure. . .

386
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,980
. . .you give him your address
and phone number.

387
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,620
Take care of her, Bitterman.

388
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,940
Good afternoon!

389
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,220
You'd think they'd never
seen a car before.

390
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,830
Hey lady, where
did you get the car?

391
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,870
Could you children please
allow us our privacy?

392
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,100
Could l sit here until
one of my neighbors walks by?

393
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,980
l want someone l know
to see me get out of this.

394
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,180
l understand.

395
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,070
Here comes Mrs. Nesbit.
This should kill her.

396
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,300
Don't touch the door.
l'll do it.

397
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,620
Mrs. Nesbit deserves
the entire treatment.

398
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,110
Thank you, Bitterman.

399
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,830
Well, hello, Mrs. Nesbit!

400
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,020
Will that be all, madam?

401
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,380
l think so.

402
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,580
Have a nice evening, Mrs. Nesbit.

403
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,420
-Could be a big tie.
-lt is a tie.

404
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,420
Then guessing would be
out of the question.

405
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,310
-lt is a tie!
-Surprise!

406
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,630
l love it!

407
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,020
lt goes with everything l own.

408
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,500
l hope you like it.

409
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,220
lf l don't get a job soon, you may
get it back on your birthday.

410
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,020
Dad, shut up.

411
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,620
A funny thing happened
to me today.

412
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,430
Do you know why. . .

413
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,860
. . .girls marry so badly?

414
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,740
ls this a joke?
Are these Polish girls?

415
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:23,300
The reason is, there
are so many girls. . .

416
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,380
. . .and so few princes.

417
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,180
You met a prince?

418
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,500
l met a nice guy. With my help,
he could become a prince.

419
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,470
-Who is he?
-Just a guy.

420
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,900
What does he do?

421
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,780
Nothing.

422
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,220
Another beauty.
How does he make a living?

423
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,110
Look, l have to make dinner.

424
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,060
l take it this bum
will be calling you.

425
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,460
Dad, he's a millionaire.

426
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,220
You have my permission
to marry him.

427
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,220
Roses. Yellow.

428
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,980
She'll drop dead. She'll love them.

429
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,590
Yellow roses. Two dozen.

430
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,470
l think something else
would look nice too.

431
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,950
Red roses. With the yellow.

432
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,300
She won't know what hit her!
You'll be aces with her.

433
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,540
You're a nice boy.

434
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,220
Two dozen red, okay?

435
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,380
-Do you know what happened?
-No, l don't.

436
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,660
Yesterday l met her
outside Bergdorf's.

437
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,780
l can't stop
thinking about her!

438
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,620
Are you married?

439
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,350
Once. She's alive.

440
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,830
-What's that?
-A yucca plant.

441
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,670
-l'll take it.
-How many?

442
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,140
Four.

443
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,820
Where were you
when l was selling cars?

444
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,750
How did you know
when you fell in love?

445
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,310
How does anybody know?

446
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,860
l was on a train.

447
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,380
From Washington to New York.

448
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,540
What's that?

449
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,660
-A fern. You need five.
-Right!

450
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,180
A girl got on the train.
Skinny. She gave me a smile.

451
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,900
By Baltimore, l was a dead duck.

452
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,340
Did you whistle a lot?
l find l whistle!

453
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,660
l whistled.

454
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,180
Did you feel funny?
l feel funny.

455
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,940
You may have a cold.

456
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,620
Send all this and anything else
you can think of to this address.

457
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,870
Send 2 dozen roses
to your wife.

458
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,540
The skinny one on the train.

459
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,020
Here, keep the change.

460
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,420
You're the rich one?

461
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,180
The one who drinks?

462
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,510
How does it feel
to have all that money?

463
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,790
lt feels great.

464
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,180
A dumb question.

465
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,820
What do you do?
l've never asked.

466
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,300
l'm an actress.
l mean, l'm studying to be one.

467
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,100
But l'm working as a waitress.

468
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,140
A lot of talented girls do that.

469
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,350
What's it like being a waitress?

470
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,460
lt's fun. l mean, you know.

471
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,620
This guy came in and pulled out--

472
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,020
A guy came into the diner
and pulled out--

473
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,020
-He pulled out what?
-Pulled out a gun!

474
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,900
l love this song!

475
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,630
l love it too!

476
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,940
When do l get a turn?

477
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,700
Can't you see l'm going
for a new world's record?

478
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,020
After only 1 2 games,
l have 80 coupons!

479
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,820
l knew it would be different
spending an evening with a millionaire.

480
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,780
Two more and l'm 20 for 20!
That's another 35 coupons!

481
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,220
Could we have a little quiet here?

482
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,980
You nut!

483
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,660
Look at him with his gun.

484
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,030
Are you cute!

485
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,590
God, l missed!

486
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,580
Nineteen.

487
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,900
For 1 9, you get 1 5 coupons.

488
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,300
We really have to go now.

489
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,870
Space lnvaders!

490
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,700
Do you want the orange one?

491
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,220
Enjoy it!

492
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,260
Now take care of it.

493
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,700
l already named it!

494
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,820
l named it after my grandmother
on my mother's side.

495
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,500
Arthur.

496
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,140
Here's a rose.
l stole it from the restaurant.

497
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,620
Thank you.

498
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,060
l've never taken care of anyone.

499
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,780
Everyone's always taken care of me.

500
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,910
But if you got sick, or anything. . .

501
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,740
. . .l'd take care of you.

502
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,390
Then l'll get sick.

503
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,620
This Vermeer just arrived today.

504
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,670
lt's called. . .

505
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,460
. . . ''Woman Admiring Pearls. ''

506
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,220
The dealer jerked me around
on the price a little.

507
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,260
But what the hell.

508
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,660
We live once.

509
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,420
Martha. . . .

510
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,700
What's the matter, Arthur?

511
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,620
l can't marry Susan Johnson.

512
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,990
-Really?
-l met this girl!

513
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,100
You are a charming boy.
Unfortunately. . .

514
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,660
. . .every time you have an erection,
it makes the papers.

515
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,900
Goodness!
l sound like a dime novel.

516
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,740
Peanuts!

517
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,620
lsn't my grandson handsome, Harriet?

518
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,620
-Yes.
-Thank you, Harriet.

519
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,780
ls it wonderful to be. . .

520
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,980
. . .promiscuous?

521
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,820
At your age, Martha,
it might just be dangerous.

522
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,870
Who is she? This one you met.

523
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,140
l don't know.

524
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,940
She lives in Queens.
She's nobody.

525
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,420
But there's something
about her, Martha.

526
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,470
Make no mistakes.

527
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,540
You are too old to be poor.

528
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,260
You don't know how.

529
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,820
We are ruthless people.

530
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,380
Don't screw with us.

531
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,740
Arthur, l love you.

532
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:43,340
lf you don't marry Susan
l'll cut you off without a cent.

533
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,300
You're a scary old broad, Martha.

534
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,300
And you are a delightful child.

535
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,900
Marry Susan and cheat
with the nobody from Queens.

536
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,020
How are you?
l got off work early.

537
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,380
Listen, do you like lasagna?

538
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,860
-Yeah.
-Oh, thank God.

539
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,420
l know this is last minute. . .

540
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,100
. . .but something came up.
l can't make it tonight.

541
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,620
Fine. No problem. What?

542
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,860
Listen, the truth is. . .

543
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,070
. . .l'm getting engaged tonight.

544
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,260
The easiest thing would be
to lie, but l like you--

545
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,540
Look, no sweat.
We had some laughs. Good luck. . . .

546
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,740
l wanted to tell you
the other night, but l--

547
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,910
Don't worry about it.
l have to go. Okay? Bye.

548
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,220
Would you like a beer?
l'll get you a beer.

549
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,460
l'll be all right, sweetheart.

550
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,950
l just have to be
alone for a minute.

551
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,660
Oh, God! l can't bear it.

552
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,380
Come in.

553
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,590
Shall l get the car, Mr. Bach?

554
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,100
No thanks, Bitterman.

555
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,540
Tonight l'll drive myself.

556
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,380
How often does
a young man get engaged?

557
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,020
Where's Mr. Hobson?

558
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,940
Mr. Hobson was tired, sir.
He's resting.

559
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,220
He's been tired
quite a bit lately.

560
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,510
l'm sure he's fine, sir.

561
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,500
Will you cut it out?

562
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,820
l didn't mean to tell you,
but l've got a tumor.

563
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,300
Did the lights go off?

564
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,190
Just talk to me, okay?

565
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,420
With a tumor in my head?

566
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,140
Listen, Arthur.

567
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,260
There are three books. . . .
This is important.

568
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,620
Take them back. . .

569
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,100
. . .to the library.

570
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:16,060
Don't die anymore.
lt's getting very boring.

571
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,740
l've only got a cold.
Now go and get engaged.

572
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,060
l just told Linda
l was getting engaged.

573
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,750
l don't know why.

574
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:29,620
A tart like that could
save you a fortune in prostitutes.

575
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,750
Listen, old man.

576
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,140
Don't ever talk about
her that way again.

577
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,540
She's the best person l know!

578
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,620
Goddamn it,
why are you such a snob?!

579
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,740
l raised my voice to you.
l've never done that before.

580
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,550
That's quite all right.

581
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,620
You know, you may be growing up.

582
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,630
And l'm sorry for what
l said about Linda.

583
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,020
Do you want anything?

584
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,540
l want to be younger.

585
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,100
l'm sorry.
lt's your job to be older.

586
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,430
-Good evening, Mr. Bach.
-Good evening, Mr. Butler.

587
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,310
l'm here to get engaged.

588
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,220
Won't you come in, sir?

589
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,940
How are you?

590
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,790
Susan! You get down here
this minute!

591
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,620
Miss Susan is expecting you.
She's dressing.

592
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,900
l will inform her you're here.

593
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,660
Tell her Chief lnspector Flanigan
from homicide is here.

594
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,020
That should get her
down in a hurry.

595
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,300
Nothing. Offer to take my coat.

596
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,150
You don't have a coat.

597
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,620
Well, offer to take my tie.

598
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,580
lt's a little joke.

599
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,830
Take the rest of the week off.

600
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,020
You're obviously
under a lot of tension.

601
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,140
Would you care to wait
in the library?

602
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,020
Yes! The bathroom is
out of the question!

603
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,820
That's another little joke.

604
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,380
Follow me, please.

605
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,620
l'm a little nervous.
l'm getting engaged.

606
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,910
You may wait in here.

607
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,020
Thank you!

608
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,420
ls there anything you
care for while you wait?

609
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,220
Do you have today's Pravda ?
l like to keep up with Russia.

610
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,070
Then fill a glass with scotch.

611
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,420
Are you sure you want
to be a nightclub comic?

612
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:07,420
Marty, he's pouring a drink.
l'll get back to you!

613
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:14,300
lf you're going to be like that,
let's call the whole thing off!

614
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,110
God, these people!

615
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,220
l'm glad we had this time together.
You're a funny guy.

616
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,060
You have that trouble too?

617
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,820
This must be awfully
embarrassing for you.

618
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,500
Hello, Arthur.

619
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,180
Hello, Mr. Johnson.

620
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,310
l haven't seen you lately.

621
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,420
The reason you haven't
seen me is because. . .

622
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,740
. . .l normally pick Susan up
at her apartment in town.

623
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,420
And you live here.
Want a drink?

624
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,110
l never drink.

625
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,180
-No one in my family drinks.
-That's great!

626
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,780
You probably never run out
of ice your whole life.

627
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:15,260
l don't drink because drinking
affects your decision-making.

628
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,310
You may be right.
l can't decide.

629
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,420
That's just a little humor.

630
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,820
Where's the rest
of this moose?

631
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,620
Arthur, l think it's time
we got to know one another.

632
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,660
l do too. That's why
l had you come over today.

633
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,180
This is a tough room.

634
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,620
l don't have to tell you that.

635
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,470
You must have hated this moose.

636
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,260
Why don't you forget
the moose for a moment?!

637
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,740
Right.

638
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,220
You know. . .

639
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,900
. . .l didn't inherit money
like you did.

640
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,820
l started with nothing.

641
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,740
And yet. . .

642
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,470
. . .l was a millionaire
by the time l was 1 8.

643
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,220
Anyone stood in my way,
they got hurt.

644
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,660
When l was 1 1 years old. . .

645
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,190
. . .l killed a man.

646
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,260
When you're 1 1 , you don't even
know there's a law against that.

647
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,460
ls Susan here?

648
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,670
l knew what l was doing.
We were poor.

649
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,620
He came into our house
to steal our food.

650
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,860
Well, he was asking for it.

651
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,220
l took a knife. . .

652
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,420
. . .and l killed him
in the kitchen.

653
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,620
You probably ate out that night.

654
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,750
l mean, with that man
lying in your kitchen.

655
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:52,580
-You seem to find humor in everything.
-Yes, sorry.

656
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,900
-Arthur!
-What?

657
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:58,620
Do you know what l consider to be
my most precious possession?

658
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,110
My daughter.

659
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,220
She is my gold.

660
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,620
-She is my treasure.
-She's very nice.

661
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:10,300
And l protect what's mine.

662
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,990
And l do it in an ugly way.

663
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:20,100
-l'm from the gutter.
-l understand. The gutter.

664
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,540
You seem upset.

665
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,620
Now, Susan loves you.

666
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,220
And l want you to make her happy.

667
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,180
You can count on it.

668
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,180
l insist upon you making her happy.

669
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,020
Listen.

670
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,460
What happens. . .

671
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,300
. . .this is just hypothetical. . .

672
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,300
. . .if l don't make her happy?
Which is out of the question!

673
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,220
But let's just say. . .

674
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,030
. . .l make her. . .

675
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,580
. . .cranky?

676
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,020
For cranky, l guess you'd
probably just break my ankles.

677
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,110
Something like that.

678
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,550
You'll make her happy.

679
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,470
l don't like your drinking.

680
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,980
lt makes you unreasonable.

681
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,550
l want you to go to work.

682
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:13,820
Now, your father and l
talked about it. l want you. . .

683
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,820
. . .to work for me.

684
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,030
ls this it?
She's not happy already?

685
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,910
Susan loves you.

686
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,500
So l love you.

687
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,900
You'll find me a friend.

688
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,220
Don't you get it?

689
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,860
You can get drunk.

690
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,420
You can throw up.

691
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,020
You can forget to call me
for months.

692
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,940
You can't lose with me.

693
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,300
l know you too well.

694
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,620
And l'm much stronger
than you are.

695
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,460
l know how alone you are.

696
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,300
l hate how alone you are.

697
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:49,380
l've cried because
you're so alone.

698
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,750
Don't be afraid, Arthur.

699
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,420
You're never going
to be alone again.

700
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,510
Waiter!

701
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,460
l'll have another.
You want another fish?

702
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,980
Don't drink anymore.

703
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:07,950
You're such an asshole!

704
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,460
This is what l am!

705
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,230
Everyone who drinks
is not a poet.

706
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:21,380
Some of us drink
because we're not poets.

707
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,750
A real woman could
stop you from drinking.

708
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,940
lt'd have to be a real big woman.

709
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,900
Will you take my hand?

710
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,020
That would leave you with one!

711
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,660
Sorry. Here's the hand.

712
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,630
l love you, Arthur.

713
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,110
Good! l have to talk
to the waiter now.

714
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:47,340
My doctor advised me to
drink 1 0 of these an hour.

715
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,540
l understand, Mr. Bach.

716
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:13,020
This is the ring my grandfather
gave to my grandmother.

717
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,340
Then he died.

718
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,150
And subsequently,
she gave it to me.

719
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,340
l'll always love you.

720
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,740
lt's a great ring, isn't it?

721
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,620
lt's a beautiful ring.

722
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,430
lt's a magical night.

723
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,940
Do you have any objection
to naming a child Vladimir?

724
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,740
Even a girl?

725
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,830
Ask me.

726
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:44,110
Will you marry me?
Take the weekend if you want.

727
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,590
Congratulations!

728
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,060
Would you mind if l took you home?

729
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,420
l've got a terrible headache.
l'm sorry.

730
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,580
This must be the building.

731
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,750
l hope it's not late.
Who am l talking to?

732
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,820
lt's me, it's me.

733
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,860
-What do you want?
-Oh, shit!

734
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,500
l'm sorry to have
disturbed you, madam.

735
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,710
l was looking for Linda. l hope
it's the wrong house. No offense.

736
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,740
My husband has a gun!

737
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,740
l'm sure he has, madam.

738
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,740
For all l know, he shot it
while you screamed.

739
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,670
Perry! Come over here!

740
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,660
This man wants to know
where Linda lives!

741
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:26,790
She lives at 1 41 33, Apartment A,
next door.

742
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,590
You tell a total stranger that?
You don't know who he is.

743
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,550
-He looks okay.
-Right, get over here!

744
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,940
She's terrible! Does she
always hit you like that?

745
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,420
Yeah, what can l do?

746
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,020
Mind your business!

747
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,780
For God's sake, she's going
to kill you! Get in there!

748
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,540
Give her a shot!
lt's you against her, Perry!

749
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,540
Oh, God!

750
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,740
lt's horrible!

751
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,260
Horrible!

752
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,740
You shouldn't hear this.

753
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,420
God!

754
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,740
Perry, you're a dead man.

755
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,630
Pardon me.

756
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,500
Oh, you're a hedge.

757
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:31,460
-You must be Linda's father.
-lt's kind of late.

758
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,220
Although l wasn't sleeping myself.

759
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:36,380
Oh, nice to meet you, Arthur.

760
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:38,820
Hi, Linda!

761
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,950
Can l come in?
Don't you hate Perry's wife?

762
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,420
Let him in.

763
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,550
Linda, l've missed--

764
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,660
Sorry, Linda.
l'm sorry.

765
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,420
Really.

766
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,300
lt happens.

767
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:07,700
What's the matter with you?

768
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,430
Nobody knocks on a door
at 3:00 in the morning!

769
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,260
You're so drunk,
you can hardly stand up.

770
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,070
And you're engaged!

771
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,750
This is a goner.

772
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,430
l'm going to sleep.

773
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:09,540
You come here at 3 o'clock
in the morning to say goodbye?

774
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,630
l have to get up and go to work
in the morning. Stop kidding around!

775
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,740
Will you stop kissing me!

776
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,830
l'm sure you're not going
to want to be a waitress. . .

777
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,140
. . .for the rest of your life.

778
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,870
l am studying to be an actress.

779
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,020
-You told me.
-Well, l am.

780
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,310
This is for you. . .

781
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,820
. . .your father. . .

782
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,220
. . .and your acting career.

783
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,780
Please take it and l'll go.

784
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,380
$1 00,000.

785
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,420
We don't need your money.

786
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,790
Linda, it'll help you.

787
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:00,020
Look what it's done for you.

788
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,030
Tell your story walking,
before l call a cop!

789
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,020
Get out of here!

790
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,140
Closet.

791
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,020
l know.

792
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,580
Want to take her for a spin, Hobson?

793
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,510
No, thank you, Arthur.

794
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,390
Mr. Bach, be sure you call me
anytime you need the track.

795
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,620
-Take it easy.
-Thank you.

796
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,420
Do you know how miserable l am?

797
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:55,420
You're miserable?
l've got all this and l'm on a salary.

798
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,390
ARTHUR 3

799
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:04,300
Do you know the worst part?
The worst part of being me?

800
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,620
l should imagine your breath.

801
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,420
Let me be unhappy, will you?

802
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,900
You know, Hobson. . .

803
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,100
. . .l could love somebody.

804
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,620
l never got to love anybody!

805
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:23,140
What do l have to live for?
l'm a failure. l'm just in the way.

806
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,460
Would you remove your helmet, please?

807
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,420
-Why?
-Please.

808
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,860
Thank you.

809
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,180
Now your goggles.

810
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,220
-Why?
-Please.

811
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:43,230
You spoiled little bastard!

812
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:47,220
You're a man who has everything.
But that's not enough.

813
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:51,220
You feel unloved? Welcome to
the world. Everyone is unloved!

814
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,700
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
And incidentally, l love you.

815
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,660
Marry Susan, Arthur.

816
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:02,620
Poor drunks do not find love.

817
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,860
Poor drunks have very few teeth.
They urinate outdoors.

818
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:09,180
They freeze to death in summer.

819
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,260
l can't bear to think
of you that way.

820
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,150
l need Linda, Hobson.

821
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:14,500
l see.

822
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,860
Well, perhaps fate
will lend a hand, Arthur.

823
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,070
One never knows.

824
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,740
Good afternoon?

825
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,830
May l come in?

826
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,820
lf you and your undershirt
would walk two paces backwards. . .

827
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,740
. . .l could enter this dwelling.

828
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,380
How revolting.

829
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:00,820
Look who's here.
The British Tonto.

830
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,260
How are you? How's Arthur?

831
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,940
Ever since l met Arthur,
l liked him.

832
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:09,500
We have to make sure these
two wonderful kids stay together.

833
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:10,780
Who is this person?

834
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,950
-He's my father.
-Yes, and l'd like to say that--

835
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,420
Try not to speak.

836
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:19,510
Would you get me a cup of tea?
l wish to speak to Linda.

837
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,420
Sure.

838
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,140
There is an engagement
party tonight. . .

839
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:29,220
. . .at Arthur's father's house
in Southampton.

840
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,630
Here is the address.
Perhaps you should attend.

841
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,750
Are all the ones
he passed up coming?

842
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:37,060
Young woman, this is a tie
you cannot steal!

843
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,380
This is a tie you'll have
to work for.

844
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,900
Are you inviting me
to Arthur's engagement party?

845
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:45,220
This is not an invitation.

846
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,830
However. . .

847
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:50,500
. . .if there's one thing that
old gentlemen can still do. . .

848
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,900
. . .they can still spot
young gentlemen in love.

849
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,020
Please go to the party.

850
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:58,820
Are you all right?

851
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,860
Yes, l'm fine.

852
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:09,660
Does Arthur know you're here?

853
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:12,980
No, Arthur is far too fine
a person to be involved. . .

854
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,380
. . .in something as devious as this.

855
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,420
You really look out for him,
don't you?

856
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:22,300
And it is a job
that l recommend highly.

857
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,900
l have something for you.

858
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:25,940
For me?

859
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,340
What is it?

860
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:37,230
lf l told you,
it would spoil the surprise.

861
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:38,940
Don't open it.

862
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,060
Here's your tea.

863
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,220
l despise tea.

864
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,620
Would you bring me 2 aspirin
from the bathroom?

865
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:50,380
You'll find them on the top shelf,
behind the untouched shaving cream.

866
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,340
That sounds bad.
Have you seen a doctor?

867
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:07,020
Yes.

868
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,020
And he has seen me.

869
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:14,950
You know. . .

870
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,460
. . .l think Arthur has
a very good friend.

871
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:23,620
May l kiss you on the cheek?

872
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,820
ls it something you feel
strongly about?

873
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,380
What about your aspirins?

874
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,420
The aspirins are for you, my dear.

875
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:00,500
Hello.

876
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:03,580
Good evening.

877
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:14,500
God knows when l'll see you again.

878
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,460
Arthur, will you play
something for us?

879
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:44,350
-Don't you hate these things?
-Despise them.

880
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:46,460
Actually, seriously. . .

881
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:49,780
. . .songs come and go.

882
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:52,420
But l love the classics.

883
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,780
And l hope you'll enjoy this one.

884
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,380
You'd better watch out

885
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,420
You'd better not cry

886
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,100
Are you good friends with Arthur?

887
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:15,910
For ages.

888
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:20,060
l'm so pleased he finally found
the right woman. Where is she?

889
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:21,740
Over there.

890
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,860
lsn't she just beautiful?

891
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,060
Of course she is.

892
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:27,540
Why would Arthur marry a dog?

893
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:28,620
Pardon?

894
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,140
Santa Claus is coming to town

895
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,820
How does it feel to be
getting married?

896
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:40,270
Blue Moon

897
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:43,460
You saw me standing alone

898
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,220
Without a dream in my heart

899
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:52,180
Thanks a lot. That's flattering.

900
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,220
lf you knew Susan
Like l knew Susan

901
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,150
l need a drink!

902
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:07,660
-Tell me your entire name, darling.
-Preston Langly.

903
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:12,180
Really! lf you don't remember
when we met, l mean, honestly!

904
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,740
-Put your arm around me.
-Of course.

905
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,100
Linda, you're here.

906
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:21,620
So true.

907
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,740
Join us.

908
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,060
Congratulations.
Father sends his regards.

909
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:32,420
-Does he?
-Yes, he does.

910
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,140
Wednesday night may be
difficult for me.

911
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:38,060
-What?
-You're looking wonderful, my dear.

912
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:40,180
-Aren't l? Thank you.
-Wednesday?

913
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:42,740
lt's difficult for her
that night, Preston.

914
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:46,380
lsn't that the night you usually
attend the ballet, darling?

915
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:50,260
Actually, l feel foolish,
but l don't recall ever making--

916
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:53,980
Would you be divine and
get me a gin and tonic?

917
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,660
Scotch for me, Preston.

918
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:01,060
-You wait here for me?
-lf it takes forever.

919
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:12,380
What are you doing here. . .

920
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,940
. . .and why are you talking like that?

921
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,710
l was in the neighborhood.

922
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:22,540
lt took me two buses,
three cabs and a train. . .

923
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:25,510
. . .to get into the neighborhood.
But what the hell?

924
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:29,070
Nice place. l like a living room
you can land a plane in.

925
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,870
There's more of it. You like a tour?

926
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:34,460
l've seen bedrooms.

927
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,700
Don't be a lover. Be a person.

928
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,620
Make me happy.

929
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,500
Her name is Linda Marolla.

930
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:46,750
She's the one Arthur saw
the other night. She lives in Queens.

931
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:04,260
Mario, please!

932
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:08,460
Don't worry. l talked to the warden.
We'll get you out of here.

933
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:12,990
When l was a kid, l used to open
their stalls and let them run out.

934
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:15,660
You should have been there
the day l freed my goldfish.

935
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:18,100
Come over here.
l want you two to meet.

936
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:21,420
Pancho, this is Linda.
l told you about her, remember?

937
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:26,260
lt must have been something,
growing up with all this.

938
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:28,540
l was away at boarding school
most of the time.

939
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:32,750
l was kicked out of ten prep schools.
l was a bad kid.

940
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,470
No, you weren't.

941
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,660
You just wanted to go home.

942
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,700
Bad kids don't grow up
as nice as you.

943
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,460
-Why do you think Pancho loves you?
-Thank you.

944
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,460
This is kind of like prom night,
isn't it?

945
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,660
l mean, we're all dressed up.

946
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,270
Have you ever been in love?

947
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,020
You?

948
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:05,860
But when l was little,
l thought the moon followed me.

949
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:06,900
What?

950
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:13,190
l would walk and l thought
the moon went anyplace l did.

951
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,220
That's great!

952
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:19,380
l know it's silly,
but l was only eight years old.

953
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,860
l thought it meant something special
would happen to me someday.

954
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:27,980
So l've been waiting. Every day l've
been doing my hair, and washing. . .

955
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:30,780
-. . .my face--
-Can l kiss you?

956
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:32,630
Please.

957
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,900
l wasn't talking to you.

958
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:49,860
Why is it you can make me laugh
at the saddest times in my life?

959
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,700
l'm funny, that's why.

960
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,020
l'm funny!

961
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,100
Yeah, that's it.

962
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,630
You're going to marry Susan.

963
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:03,260
l'm still glad l came here.
Made a fool out of myself.

964
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,420
l wish we had made love.

965
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,740
l'd give anything
to see you in the morning.

966
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:14,740
l have to marry Susan.
lf l don't, my family will cut me off.

967
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:17,020
lt's almost a billion dollars.

968
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:21,220
One of the horses just fainted.

969
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,780
Look, this is ridiculous.

970
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,660
You got cab fare to the city?
l don't like the train at night.

971
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:31,980
Look, when Susan and l
get married. . .

972
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,870
. . .l can set you up in an apartment
and we can--

973
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:36,260
Forget it.

974
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:39,340
Are you cute!

975
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:46,700
l thought l'd find you here.

976
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:49,580
He just loves that smelly old horse.

977
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:50,660
Have we met?

978
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:53,860
l don't think you have.

979
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:56,870
Linda Marolla,
this is Susan Johnson, my fiancée.

980
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:59,340
l hope l'm not interrupting.

981
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:01,860
l'd say that if l were you.

982
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,860
We might as well tell her.

983
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:07,630
You tell her.

984
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:14,950
My husband, Harold,
went to prep school with Arthur.

985
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,500
Harold lost a fortune gambling.
He's sick!

986
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:19,860
He's a sick man!

987
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:22,460
But he's my husband.

988
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:26,070
l'm not one of your guests.
l came for one reason.

989
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:29,460
l came here to beg Arthur
to lend us some money.

990
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,100
One of my kids. . .

991
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:34,460
. . .my youngest, my baby. . .

992
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,540
. . .needs an operation.

993
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:40,110
Harold hasn't kept up the insurance.
l don't know where to turn!

994
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:41,860
Do l have to go on?

995
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:43,180
No, of course not!

996
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:45,300
Of course not!

997
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:48,380
-Arthur, l wasn't spying on you.
-l know that!

998
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:51,660
There's an urgent phone call
for you from Bitterman.

999
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,020
Thank you.

1000
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:57,460
Say hello to Harold for me.

1001
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:10,460
You all right, Bitterman?

1002
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:11,860
Yes, sir.

1003
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:17,060
Would you like me to get you
some Scotch, sir?

1004
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:19,700
We'll get through this together.

1005
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:26,460
lt's very hard.

1006
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:32,060
l'm glad to have you here, sir.

1007
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:36,870
Bitterman, do me a favor.

1008
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:38,950
Go back to the house.

1009
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:43,350
Phone my father and Mr. Johnson and
Miss Susan. Tell them what's happened.

1010
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:47,260
The wedding will have to wait.
And bring me back some clothes here.

1011
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:59,500
Okay, let's open the presents.

1012
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:01,740
l'm sorry, Arthur.

1013
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:05,180
-For what?
-For leaving you.

1014
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:08,670
You're not leaving anyone.

1015
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,380
Why, it's a basketball!

1016
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:19,860
What the hell?
l knew you didn't have one.

1017
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:22,900
lf l feel the urge to dribble. . .

1018
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,940
. . .l can always call the nurse.

1019
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:27,870
l'll put this over here.

1020
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:35,740
You purchased a choo-choo?

1021
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,860
Look, the wheels go round.

1022
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,380
l'm very pleased.

1023
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,060
Do you remember. . .

1024
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:51,820
. . .when you used to play
hide-and-seek with me?

1025
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:54,020
l used to hide and
you never found me!

1026
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,390
-Did you know l never looked?
-Come on!

1027
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:00,590
Well, l looked a little.

1028
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,660
One for you, one for me.
Put it on.

1029
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:08,060
l don't wish to put it on.

1030
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:14,950
l'll put it on.

1031
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:23,460
lf l begin to die,
please take this off my head.

1032
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,860
This isn't how
l wish to be remembered.

1033
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:29,860
Aren't they great?

1034
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:35,620
l've got guns and
holsters too. Look.

1035
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,870
Just in town for supplies, partner.

1036
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:45,020
Arthur, l'm frightened.

1037
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,860
l know you're frightened.

1038
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:54,460
l'm going to take care of you.

1039
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,500
Good morning, Mr. Bach.

1040
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,860
Hi, Ken.

1041
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:36,950
Here, l'll take that.

1042
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:40,460
You look terrible.
You haven't slept in a week.

1043
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,100
Well, we had a bad night.
He was up.

1044
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:45,980
l got the kippers and eggs.
l'll get fired.

1045
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:48,420
No, you won't.

1046
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:50,020
Listen.

1047
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:51,900
For lunch. . .

1048
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:57,660
. . .l want the trout almondine
from Lutęce. Tell Henri it's for me.

1049
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,060
He shouldn't eat that.

1050
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:02,100
l don't want his last meal
to be Jell-O.

1051
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:04,460
Thanks very much. See you later.

1052
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:08,540
Look who's up.

1053
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:14,660
We have eggs, we have kippers.

1054
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,500
We have croissants.
We have a yellow rose.

1055
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:21,340
We have strawberries.
We have blueberry cakes.

1056
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,230
We have orange juice
and great coffee.

1057
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,100
Right. Table for one, sir.

1058
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,020
Your regular.

1059
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:32,620
You know, Arthur. . .

1060
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,460
. . .l'm very glad you're here.

1061
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:38,580
l want you to eat this.
This is costing me.

1062
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:42,220
l've got chefs working at six
in the morning all over town.

1063
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:44,220
You look awful.

1064
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:47,860
That's because you've never
seen me sober. Now eat.

1065
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:50,300
Come on. You used to make me eat.

1066
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:58,150
lt's not so bad.

1067
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:01,260
You don't need to be
so frightened about it.

1068
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:05,340
-What?
-Dying.

1069
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,220
Seems natural.

1070
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:10,620
Even comforting, now.

1071
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,060
You're even teaching me
how to die?

1072
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:17,660
l'm through teaching you anything.

1073
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:20,420
You've grown up.

1074
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:34,060
You can do anything
with your life that you want to.

1075
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:36,860
What do you mean?

1076
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,860
Figure it out.

1077
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,540
You seen Linda Marolla lately?

1078
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:44,820
Linda Marolla?

1079
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:47,230
Why would you ask about her?

1080
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:50,820
l don't know what l'm talking about.
l'm dying.

1081
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:00,110
Want me to read you Shakespeare?

1082
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:03,070
Hamlet was in big trouble
when we left off.

1083
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:04,380
No.

1084
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:21,190
You're a good son.

1085
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:14,790
You take your average kid today.

1086
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:17,300
He don't want to go in the army.

1087
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:19,860
Yeah, what does he care? Dope!

1088
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:23,740
But the Communists,
they go in the army!

1089
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:26,940
lf only we had some Communists here.

1090
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:28,740
No.

1091
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:32,580
While our kids are dancing. . .

1092
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:35,670
. . .their kids are learning
how to fight!

1093
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:38,060
Everybody's dancing here!

1094
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:41,460
You're right. You're right.
lt's not worth talking about.

1095
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,470
-Let me buy you another drink.
-Right.

1096
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,180
What do you do?

1097
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:48,580
l'm a dance instructor.

1098
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:54,070
No, l'm kidding. l'm kidding!
Honest to God.

1099
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:55,260
l'm a dentist.

1100
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,540
l hate dentists.

1101
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:01,820
We're not bad guys.
lt's not easy, you know.

1102
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:05,220
There's teeth and gums and blood!

1103
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,060
Oh, my God!

1104
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:10,110
l have to get looped
just to walk into my office.

1105
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:13,860
Bartender!
We would like two more, please.

1106
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:17,070
-Haven't you had enough?
-l want more than enough.

1107
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:22,380
How come you got all this
money for all these drinks?

1108
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:26,910
l saved my money.
l haven't had a drink in a month.

1109
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:28,700
Oh, my God!

1110
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:31,100
Well, you see, my father died.

1111
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,420
So l stayed sober.

1112
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:39,140
One night at the hospital. . .

1113
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:42,060
. . .he fell asleep.
l was watching him.

1114
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:44,260
And then. . .

1115
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,580
. . .he just kept on sleeping.

1116
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,700
And l was all alone.

1117
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,820
Oh, that's terrible.

1118
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,140

01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:00,910
Are you somebody's father?

1121
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,100
No, l'm a drunk.

1122
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,420
l have a brother
who moved to New Jersey.

1123

She steals ties. . .

1131
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:28,030

Sorry.

1136
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:43,350
Sir, your wedding is within
less than five hours.

1137
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:44,860
Listen.

1138
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:47,060
Go see your brother.

1139
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:48,180
All right?

1140
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:51,270
Nobody should be alone.

1141
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:53,300
lt's awful. . .

1142
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:55,430
. . .to be alone.

1143
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:05,310
l want you to know, if he doesn't
show up for this wedding. . .

1144

. . .l'll kill him.

1145
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:10,590
Don't worry about it, Burt.
l talk to Arthur every day.

1146
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:13,710
Since Hobson's death, he's stopped
drinking. He's anxious to work.

1147
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:17,780
He's become a responsible citizen.
He'll be a good husband.

1148
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:20,460
Thanks very much.
Have a nice day.

1149
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,670
-Where's my roll?
-We're having it monogrammed.

1150
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,820
Hurry up with the old man's roll!

1151
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:30,300
Can l help you?

1152
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:32,860
Do you recommend the French toast?

1153
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:34,510
With all of my heart.

1154
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:37,750
Lady, l got customers.

1155
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:39,420
l'll have it.

1156
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:41,700
You've made the right decision.

1157
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:43,260
Wait a minute! Wait!

1158
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,940
l've waited long enough.

1159
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,550
Can you take the next
60 years off?

1160
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,780
l'll have to ask.

1161
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,830
-You want some coffee?
-Where's my roll?

1162
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:59,260
Wait! l'll get it!

1163
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:02,340
-What the hell's going on?
-She's getting your roll.

1164
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:05,460
Here's your roll.

1165
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:06,620
Arthur, what happened?

1166
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:08,100
Hobson died.

1167
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:09,380
l know.

1168
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:12,300
He loved you very much.
Did you know that?

1169
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:14,900
And l think l'll grow up.

1170
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,340
l want to marry you.

1171
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:21,140
Although l'm supposed
to marry Susan in 20 minutes.

1172
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:24,460
-He's drunk, but he sounds sincere.
-Eat your roll!

1173
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:28,460
The money.
Can you live without the money?

1174
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:30,500
Well, we'll have to.

1175
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,820
Please marry me.

1176
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:39,260
l'll try to be sober
and to make you happy.

1177
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:42,180
Although it won't be easy,
because l'll be poor.

1178
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,300
We'll be poor.

1179
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:44,580
We'll be poor.

1180
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,500
-Most people are poor.
-Eat your roll!

1181
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:51,140
Now, l have to tell Susan.
Come with me?

1182
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:52,380
l got to change.

1183
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:54,350
-l'll cover for you.
-All right.

1184
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,660
Last night, l could have sworn
the moon was following me.

1185
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:00,300
lt was.

1186
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:29,260

1187
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:30,950
Congratulations!

1188
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:33,300
Thank you. And to you too.

1189
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:36,620
l wonder, could you tell me
where the wedding party is?

1190
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:38,820
Right over there, in that room.

01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:13,820
Did you forget your garter belt?

1197
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:20,910
Sorry l'm late.

1198
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:27,260
Susan, just the one l wanted
to talk to.

1199
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:28,060
Nice dress.

1200
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:31,620
-Arthur, the ceremony's just--
-Yeah, l know.

1201
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:37,020
Could we just talk for a moment,
away from all these people?

1202
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,380
Of course.

1203
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:55,020

Thank you.
Your hat is lovely.

1208
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:05,540

1209
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,220
You're drunk?

1210
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:11,580
You're frightened?

1211
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:13,470

Hello, Mr. Johnson!

1223
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:01,190
He must be nervous.

1224
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:03,020
Arthur gets nervous.

1225
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,460
Here's your ring, Arthur.

1226
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:10,060
l hope you're happy.

1227
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:13,620
Now, stand up, son, l want
to kill you with my bare hands.

1228
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:19,660
l think you know everyone.
This is Susan's father.

1229
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:21,580
My God! Arthur, you're really hurt!

1230
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:26,540
l've got him right
where l want him.

1231
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:33,260
You animal!

1232
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:34,910
Look, it's over!

He loves me.

What about Harold?

1236
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:44,310
Harold?

1237
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:46,270
-You poor thing.
-Stand aside.

1238
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:50,340
Now, is this the slut that
you've disgraced my daughter for?!

1239
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:51,380
Slut?!

1240
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:54,180
Slut?!

1241
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:16,380
Please, Daddy!

1242
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:19,220
-Daddy, he's not worth it.
-Just sit up.

1243
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,060
Can you move, Arthur?

1244
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,660
Everybody out!

01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,270
Out! All of you, out!

1246

He's taking the knife
out of the cheese!

1248
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:40,900
Do you think he wants
some cheese?

1249
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:43,180
No, l think we're going to die!

1250
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:51,870
What's going on here?

1251
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:54,020
Stop that this instant!

1252
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:58,260
Don't screw with me, Burt!

1253
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:40,140

01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:51,740
. . .there will be no wedding.

1257
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:54,950
The bride. . .

1258
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:56,910

. . .not to marry me.

1261
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:04,420
Most of you know me.
Can you blame her?

1262
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:11,940
l won't be seeing most of you

. . .to the hospital.

1269
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:49,260
This has some iodine on it,
so it might hurt a little.

1270
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,620
That hurts, l hate it! Stop it!

1271
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:56,140
-Why did you do that?
-Because l hate an infection!

1272

lf you'd have just
let me get--

01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:10,700
Do you promise to love me. . .

And be a good boy?

l do.

1278
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:21,100
And do you promise never to put
that stuff on my face again?

1279
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:22,340
l do.

1280
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:24,780
God!

1281
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,220
We're going to be great!

1282
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:30,180
We're going to be like. . .

1283
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:34,620
. . .one of those poor couples
on the subway who hold hands.

1284
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:37,220
How much is the subway?

1285
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,740
Sixty cents. But if you spit,
it's a $500 fine.

1286
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:43,140
Then l won't spit.

1287
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:45,180
Good! None of the best people do.

1288
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:46,700
l'll get a job!

1289
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:49,620
That's what l'll do!

1290
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:51,590
l'll get a job!

1291
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:53,460
l'll work!

1292
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:55,630
God, this'll be great!

1293
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:58,460
-Good! Look how excited he is.
-l'll come home from work.

1294
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:00,580
You'll be ironing.

1295
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:03,100
We'll eat some cheap,
disgusting food.

1296
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,220
Stop!

1297
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,470
l think we're in trouble.

1298
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:08,900
That is out of the question!

1299
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:13,540
There has never been such a thing
as a working-class Bach!

1300
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,460
And there never will be!

1301
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:21,420
Step! Step!

1302
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:24,700
l've reached a decision.

1303
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:29,820
The Bach family must endure.
And not on a subway.

1304
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:33,020
Your children will be
senators, ambassadors.

1305
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:35,620
Perhaps even a president!

1306
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:40,220
You have your 750 million dollars.

1307
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:42,220
All right!

1308
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:47,860
l don't know, Martha.

1309
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,180
You don't know?!

1310
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:53,310
-Money has screwed me up my whole life.
-l know!

1311
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,060
l've always been rich
and never been happy.

1312
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:58,460
l've always been poor
and usually been happy.

1313
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:02,420
Rubbish! l've always been rich
and l've always been happy.

1314
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:07,430
Would you make me
a tuna fish sandwich?

1315
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,420
l'm going to have
a tuna fish sandwich, Martha.

1316
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:12,820
Step.

1317
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:20,230
l demand that you take this money.

1318
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:23,820
l want a decision
and l want it now!

1319
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:29,020
l can't tell you what a lousy
wedding that was, Bitterman.

1320
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:33,380
Bitterman, goodbye.

1321
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:35,460
l'm going.

1322
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:37,540
Goodbye, sir.

1323
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,980
lt was a pleasure working for you.

1324
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:42,740
Chauffeurs rarely get to laugh.
Thank you.

1325
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:44,980
-Goodbye, Bitterman.
-Goodbye, miss.

1326
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:48,580
Arthur, l'm going!
Open that door, Rockland!

1327
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:52,860
-Ever been on a yacht?
-No, is it wonderful?

1328
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:55,020
lt doesn't suck.

1329
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:58,580
l shall never offer you
this money again.

1330
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:02,260
l wish you luck in your poverty.

1331
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,260
Excuse me.

1332
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:29,380
What happened?

1333
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:30,980
l turned her down.

1334
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:34,220
She invited us for dinner
and l said. . .

1335
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:37,540
. . .we're having a tuna fish sandwich.
So l turned her down.

1336
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:41,420
l took the money, l mean,
l'm not crazy!

1337
01:30:43,790 --> 01:30:45,430
Do you want to double your salary?

1338
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:47,900
-Then open that door.
-Right away, sir.

1339
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,420
ls that funny?

1340
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:52,900
Where to, sir?

1341
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:58,260
The park. Drive through the park.
You know how l love the park.

1342
01:30:58,510 --> 01:31:00,580
-Get in! Step!
-Step!

1343
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:04,500
