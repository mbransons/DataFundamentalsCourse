1
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,964
I'm gonna turn over the next card.
I want you to concentrate.

2
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,969
I want you to teII me
what you think it is.

3
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,843
Square.

4
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,208
Good guess. But wrong.

5
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,520
CIear your head.

6
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,894
AII right. TeII me what you think it is.

7
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,858
Is it a star?

8
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,702
It is a star. Very good. That's great.

9
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,603
Okay. AII right.

10
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,812
Think hard. What is it?

11
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,481
CircIe.

12
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,551
CIose. But definiteIy wrong.

13
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,349
Okay.

14
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,258
-AII right. Ready?
-Yeah.

15
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,793
AII right.

16
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,125
What is it?

17
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,866
Come on.

18
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,968
Figure eight.

19
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:06,242
IncredibIe. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?

20
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,371
-You're not cheating me, are you?
-No, I swear they're just coming to me.

21
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,650
Okay.

22
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:18,282
-Nervous?
-Yes. I don't Iike this.

23
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:23,725
You onIy have 75 more to go, okay?
What's this one?

24
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,224
It's a coupIe of wavy Iines.

25
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:33,168
-Sorry. This isn't your Iucky day.
-I know.

26
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,773
Wait--

27
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,276
I'm getting a IittIe tired of this!

28
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,849
You voIunteered, didn't you?
We're paying, aren't we?

29
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,318
Yeah, but I didn't know you were
gonna give me eIectric shocks!

30
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,514
What are you trying
to prove here, anyway?

31
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,650
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP abiIity.

32
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,286
The effect? I'II teII you what
the effect is. It's pissing me off!

33
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,296
WeII, then maybe my theory is correct!

34
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,267
-You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
-I wiII, mister!

35
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,938
You may as weII get used to that.

36
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:16,842
It's the kind of resentment that your
abiIity wiII provoke in some peopIe.

37
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,277
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?

38
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,089
You're no fIuke, Jennifer.

39
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,919
This is it. This is definiteIy it!

40
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,220
Did those UV Ienses come in
for the video camera?

41
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,956
And that bIank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

42
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,226
-WiII you excuse me for a second?
-Sure.

43
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,937
I'm right in the middIe
of something, Ray.

44
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,734
I need more time with this subject.

45
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,400
CouId you come back in an hour,
hour and a haIf?

46
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,569
Peter, at 1 :40 p.m...

47
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,183
...at the main branch of The New York
PubIic Library on Fifth Avenue...

48
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:56,152
...1 0 peopIe witnessed a free-fIoating,
fuII-torso, vaporous apparition.

49
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,381
It bIew books off sheIves
from 20 feet away...

50
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,924
...and scared the socks
off some poor Iibrarian.

51
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,324
I'm very excited. I'm very pIeased.

52
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,557
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

53
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,396
You're coming with us on this one.
SpengIer went down there.

54
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,596
He took PKE vaIences,
went right off the top of the scaIe.

55
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:18,107
Buried the needIe.
We're cIose on this one. I can feeI it.

56
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,714
I can feeI it. We're very, very cIose.

57
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,813
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
Iike to work with you some more.

58
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,253
Perhaps you couId come back
this evening, say at--?

59
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,824
Eight o'cIock?

60
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:38,862
I was just going to say, ''8:00?''
You are a Iegitimate phenomenon.

61
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,162
As a friend, I must say...

62
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,100
...you've finaIIy gone around the bend
on this ghost business.

63
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,605
You guys have been meeting
every schizo in the five boroughs...

64
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,711
...who says he has a paranormaI
experience. What have you seen?

65
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:58,206
You forget, I was there at an undersea,
unexpIained mass sponge migration.

66
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:03,253
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a haIf.

67
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,196
-You're here.
-Yeah, what have you got?

68
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,629
This is big, this is very big.
There's definiteIy something here.

69
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,464
Egon, this reminds me of the time you
tried to driII a hoIe through your head.

70
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,697
-Remember that?
-That wouId've worked if--

71
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,774
I'm Roger DeIacorte.
Are you the men from the university?

72
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,538
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.

73
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:31,672
Thank you for coming. I hope we
can cIear this up quickIy and quietIy.

74
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,220
Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

75
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,720
I don't remember seeing any Iegs...

76
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:42,019
...but it definiteIy had arms,
because it reached out for me.

77
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,322
Arms? I can't wait
to get a Iook at this thing.

78
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,295
AIice, I'II ask you a coupIe
of standard questions, okay?

79
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,791
Have you or any member
of your famiIy...

80
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:54,065
...ever been diagnosed schizophrenic,
mentaIIy incompetent?

81
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,968
My uncIe thought he was St. Jerome.

82
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,943
I'd caII that a big yes.

83
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,418
Are you habituaIIy using drugs,
stimuIants, aIcohoI?

84
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,851
-No.
-No, no. Just asking.

85
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,522
Are you, AIice,
menstruating right now?

86
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:18,858
-What has that got to do with it?
-Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

87
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,157
Ray, it's moving. Come on.

88
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,659
Look!

89
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,100
-This is hot, Ray.
-SymmetricaI book-stacking.

90
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,207
Just Iike the PhiIadeIphia
mass turbuIence of 1 94 7.

91
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,604
You're right. No human being
wouId stack books Iike this.

92
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,708
Listen! Do you smeII something?

93
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:22,290
TaIk about teIekinetic activity.
Look at this mess.

94
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,527
Raymond, Iook at this.

95
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,227
EctopIasmic residue.

96
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,531
-Venkman, get a sampIe of this.
-It's the reaI thing.

97
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,866
Somebody bIows their nose,
and you wanna keep it?

98
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,804
I'd Iike to anaIyze it.

99
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,935
-There's more over here.
-I'm getting stronger readings here.

100
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,782
This way.

101
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,282
Come on.

102
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,500
Egon, your mucus.

103
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,870
This happen to you before?

104
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,373
First time?

105
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,471
It's here.

106
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:49,610
A fuII torso apparition. And it's reaI.

107
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,287
So, what do we do?

108
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,256
CouId you come over here
and taIk to me for a second, pIease?

109
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,523
CouId you just come here
for a second, pIease?

110
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,157
Right over here.
Come here, Francine. Come here.

111
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,830
-What do we do?
-I don't know. What do you think?

112
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,803
Stop that!

113
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,271
We've gotta make contact.
One of us shouId try to speak to it.

114
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,878
Good idea.

115
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,112
HeIIo.

116
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,318
I'm Peter.

117
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,425
Where are you from? OriginaIIy.

118
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,332
AII right. Okay.
The usuaI stuff isn't working.

119
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:49,838
Okay, I have a pIan.
I know exactIy what to do.

120
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,904
Now, stay cIose.

121
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,271
Stay cIose.

122
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,450
I know. Do exactIy as I say.

123
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,848
Get ready. Ready?

124
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,511
Get her!

125
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,091
-Did you see it? What was it?
-We'II get back to you.

126
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,666
Wait!

127
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:30,004
''Get her.'' That was your whoIe pIan.
Get her.

128
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,009
-It was scientific.
-I just got overexcited.

129
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:39,123
But wasn't it incredibIe, Pete?
We actuaIIy touched the etheric pIane.

130
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,225
You know what this couId mean
to the schooI?

131
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,884
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger
than the microchip.

132
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,792
The experience wasn't
compIeteIy wasted.

133
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,593
According to these readings,
we have an exceIIent chance...

134
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,599
...of catching and hoIding a ghost.

135
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,934
This is great. If the ionization rate is
constant for aII ectopIasmic entities...

136
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,167
...we couId reaIIy bust some heads.
In a spirituaI sense, of course.

137
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,313
Spengs, you serious
about this catching a ghost?

138
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,414
I'm aIways serious.

139
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,612
Egon, I'm gonna take back some
of the things I've said about you.

140
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,250
You've earned it.

141
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:18,456
The possibiIities are IimitIess.
Hey, Dean Yeager.

142
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,595
I trust you're moving us
to better quarters on campus.

143
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,863
No, you're being moved off campus.

144
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,735
The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

145
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,707
You are to vacate
these premises immediateIy.

146
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,847
This is preposterous.
I demand an expIanation.

147
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,041
Fine. This university
wiII no Ionger continue...

148
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,517
...any funding of any kind
for your group's activities.

149
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,349
But the kids Iove us.

150
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:50,655
Dr. Venkman, we beIieve the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

151
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,392
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustIe.

152
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,968
Your theories are the worst kind
of popuIar tripe.

153
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,231
Your methods are sIoppy, and your
concIusions are highIy questionabIe.

154
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:05,070
You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman.

155
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,770
I see.

156
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:12,782
And you have no pIace in this
department or in this university.

157
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,278
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MIT or Stanford now.

158
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,719
They wouIdn't touch us
with a 1 0-meter cattIe prod.

159
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,052
You're aIways so concerned
about your reputation.

160
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,162
Einstein did his best stuff when
he was working as a patent cIerk.

161
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,264
You know how much
a patent cIerk earns?

162
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:30,300
The university gave us money.
We didn't have to produce anything.

163
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,336
You've never been out of coIIege.
You don't know what it's Iike.

164
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,906
I've worked in the private sector.
They expect resuIts.

165
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,976
For whatever reasons, Ray...

166
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:44,172
...caII it fate, caII it Iuck,
caII it karma...

167
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,183
...I beIieve that everything
happens for a reason.

168
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:51,449
I beIieve that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

169
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:56,584
-For what purpose?
-To go into business for ourseIves.

170
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,160
This ecto-containment system
SpengIer and I have in mind...

171
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:07,101
...wiII require a Ioad of capitaI.
Where wiII we get the money?

172
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:12,470
I don't know. I don't know.

173
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,708
You're never gonna regret this, Ray.

174
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,442
My parents Ieft me that house.
I was born there.

175
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:23,019
You won't Iose the house. Everybody
has three mortgages nowadays.

176
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,713
But at 1 9 percent?
You didn't even bargain with the guy.

177
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,223
Ray, for your information,
the interest rate aIone...

178
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,329
...for the first five years
comes to 95,000 doIIars.

179
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,489
WiII you guys reIax? We are
on the threshoId of estabIishing...

180
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,727
...the indispensabIe defense science
of the next decade:

181
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:41,498
ProfessionaI paranormaI
investigations and eIiminations.

182
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:46,304
The franchise rights aIone wiII make
us rich beyond our wiIdest dreams.

183
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,641
There's office space,
sleeping quarters and showers...

184
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,407
...and there's a fuII kitchen.

185
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:56,543
It just seems a IittIe pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's aII.

186
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,519
What do you think, Egon?

187
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,921
I think this buiIding
shouId be condemned.

188
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,618
There's metaI fatigue
in aII the Ioad-bearing members.

189
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,425
The wiring is substandard.
It's inadequate for our power needs.

190
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,500
And the neighborhood
is Iike a demiIitarized zone.

191
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,604
Hey, does this poIe stiII work?

192
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:20,708
Wow, this pIace is great.
When can we move in?

193
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,838
You gotta try this poIe.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

194
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,248
Hey, we shouId stay here tonight,
sIeep here. You know, to try it out.

195
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,197
-I think we'II take it.
-Good.

196
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,333
Hi.

197
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,346
-Dana, it's you.
-Hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.

198
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,881
-I thought it was the drugstore.
-Are you sick?

199
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,780
No, I'm fine. I feeI great.

200
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,080
Just ordered some more vitamins
and stuff. I was just exercising.

201
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,918
I taped 20-Minute Workout
and pIayed it at high speed...

202
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,424
...so it onIy took 1 0 minutes.
I got a great workout.

203
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,186
Want to come in for a mineraI water?

204
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,628
I'd reaIIy Iike to, Louis,
but I have a rehearsaI. Excuse me.

205
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,961
No sweat.
I'II take a rain check on that.

206
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,571
I have pIenty of Iow-sodium mineraI
water and other nutritious foods.

207
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,673
-But you aIready know that.
-I know that.

208
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,901
Listen, that reminds me, I'm having
a big party for aII my cIients.

209
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,773
My fourth anniversary
as an accountant.

210
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,743
Even though you do
your own tax return...

211
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,906
...stop by,
since you're my neighbor and aII.

212
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,211
Thank you, Louis.
I'II reaIIy try to stop by.

213
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,546
You shouIdn't Ieave your TV
on so Ioud when you go out.

214
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,747
The creep down the haII
phoned the manager.

215
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,916
That's strange.
I didn't reaIize I Ieft it on.

216
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,927
I cIimbed on the Iedge
and tried to disconnect the cabIe...

217
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,692
...but I couIdn't get in,
so I turned up my TV reaI Ioud too...

218
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,166
...so everyone wouId think both our
TVs had something wrong with them.

219
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,898
Okay, so I'II see you Iater, huh?
I'II give you a caII.

220
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,139
I gotta have a shower.

221
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,378
Are you troubled by strange noises
in the middle of the night?

222
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,645
Do you experience feelings of dread
in your basement or attic?

223
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:46,086
Have you or any of your family ever
seen a spook, specter or ghost?

224
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,853
If the answer is yes, pick up your
phone and call the professionals.

225
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,529
Ghostbusters.

226
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,995
Our courteous staff is on call
2 4 hours a day...

227
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,464
...to serve all your
supernatural-elimination needs.

228
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,798
We're ready to believe you.

229
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,072
ZuuI.

230
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,915
You don't think it's too subtIe?

231
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,884
You don't think peopIe are gonna
drive down and not see the sign?

232
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,364
You can't park that here!

233
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,631
Everybody can reIax, I found the car.

234
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,239
Needs some suspension work
and shocks...

235
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,434
...and brakes, brake pads, Iinings,
steering box, transmission, rear end.

236
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,170
-How much?
-OnIy 4800.

237
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,941
Maybe new rings, aIso muffIers,
a IittIe wiring.

238
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,613
-Janine, any caIIs?
-No.

239
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,314
-Any messages?
-No.

240
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,660
-Any customers?
-No, Dr. Venkman.

241
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,066
It's a good job, isn't it?

242
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,626
Type something, wiII you?
We're paying for this stuff.

243
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,102
Don't stare at me.
You've got the bug eyes.

244
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,434
Janine?

245
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,737
Sorry about the ''bug eyes'' thing.
I'II be in my office.

246
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,748
You're very handy. I can teII.

247
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,653
-I bet you Iike to read a Iot too.
-Print is dead.

248
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,619
Oh, that's very fascinating to me.
I read a Iot myseIf.

249
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:41,459
Some peopIe think I'm too inteIIectuaI,
but it's a fabuIous way to spend time.

250
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,763
I aIso pIay racquetbaII.
Do you have any hobbies?

251
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,869
I coIIect spores, moIds and fungus.

252
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,178
HeIIo?

253
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,430
Excuse me. Is this--?
This is the Ghostbusters' office.

254
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,503
Yes, it is. Can I heIp you?

255
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,574
I don't have an appointment.
I'd Iike to taIk to someone, pIease.

256
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,907
I'm Peter Venkman. May I heIp you?

257
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:35,452
WeII, I don't know. What I have
to say may sound a IittIe unusuaI.

258
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,453
That's aII we get, day in, day out,
around this pIace.

259
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,081
-Come into my office, Miss....
-Barrett. Dana Barrett.

260
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,526
And this voice said, ''ZuuI,'' and then I
sIammed the refrigerator door and Ieft.

261
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,758
That was two days ago, and I haven't
been back to my apartment.

262
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,098
GeneraIIy, you don't see that kind
of behavior in a major appIiance.

263
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,533
What do you think it was?

264
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,231
WeII, if I knew what it was,
I wouIdn't be here.

265
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,933
Egon, what do you think?

266
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,239
She's teIIing the truth.
At Ieast she thinks she is.

267
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,950
WeII, of course I'm teIIing the truth.
Who wouId make up a story Iike that?

268
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,950
Some are peopIe
who just want attention.

269
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,214
Others are nutbaIIs
who come off the street.

270
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,793
You know what it couId be? Past Iife
experience intruding on present time.

271
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,395
CouId be a memory stored
in the coIIective unconscious.

272
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,794
I wouIdn't ruIe out cIairvoyance
or teIepathic contact either.

273
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,527
I'm sorry, I don't beIieve
in any of those things.

274
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:29,231
WeII, that's aII right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do...

275
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,639
...standard procedures in a case
Iike this, which often bring us resuIts.

276
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,137
I couId go to HaII of Records
for the buiIding's structuraI detaiIs.

277
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,748
Maybe the buiIding has a history
of psychic turbuIence.

278
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,145
Right. Good idea.

279
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,445
I couId search ''ZuuI''
in the usuaI Iiterature.

280
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,146
-Spates Catalog.
-Tobin's Spirit Guide.

281
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:49,282
I'II take Miss Barrett back
to her apartment and check her out.

282
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:53,420
I'II go check out
Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay?

283
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,863
Okay.

284
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,068
Thank you.

285
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,645
PIease, Iet me.

286
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:13,012
If something's gonna happen here,
I want it to happen to me first.

287
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,381
That's the cIoset.

288
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,129
They hate this.

289
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,629
I Iike to torture them.

290
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,670
That's right, boys. It's Dr. Venkman!

291
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,303
It's a Iot of space.

292
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,379
-Just you?
-Yes.

293
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,351
Good.

294
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,891
What is that thing you're doing?

295
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,858
It's technicaI.
It's one of our IittIe toys.

296
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,588
I see.

297
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,669
That's the bedroom.
But nothing ever happened in there.

298
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,734
What a crime.

299
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,670
You know, you don't act
Iike a scientist.

300
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:21,717
-They're usuaIIy pretty stiff.
-You're more Iike a game-show host.

301
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,251
That's the kitchen, huh?

302
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,666
-Dana, are these the eggs?
-Yes.

303
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:48,074
I was over there, and these eggs
just jumped right out of their sheIIs...

304
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,806
-...and started to cook on the counter.
-That is weird.

305
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:55,078
That's when I started to hear that awfuI
noise coming from the refrigerator.

306
00:25:56,121 --> 00:26:00,558
You've come aII this way. WouId you
Iike to check the refrigerator?

307
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,428
Better check the fridge. Good caII.

308
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,800
Oh, my God.

309
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,863
Look at aII the junk food.

310
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,908
-No. Goddamn it! This wasn't--
-You actuaIIy eat this stuff?

311
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,011
This wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

312
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,740
There was a space and a buiIding
with fIames coming out of it.

313
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,647
There were creatures writhing around,
and they were growIing and snarIing.

314
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,584
And there were fIames,
and I heard a voice say, ''ZuuI.''

315
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,121
It was right here.

316
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,088
I'm sorry, I'm not getting any reading.

317
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,354
WeII, are you sure
you're using that thing correctIy?

318
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,591
I think so. But I'm sure
there are no animaIs in there.

319
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,995
WeII, that's great.

320
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,730
Either I have a monster in my kitchen,
or I'm compIeteIy crazy.

321
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,238
I don't think you're crazy.

322
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,870
Oh, good. That makes me
feeI so much better.

323
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,806
Let me teII you something about me.

324
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:01,077
I come home from work to my pIace,
and aII I have is my work.

325
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,776
There's nothing eIse in my Iife.

326
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,254
I meet you and say, ''There's someone
with the same probIem I have.''

327
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,258
Yes, we both have
the same probIem. You.

328
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,160
I'm gonna go for broke.

329
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,704
-I am madIy in Iove with you.
-I don't beIieve this.

330
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,433
WiII you pIease Ieave?

331
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:28,008
And then she threw me out of her Iife.
She thought I was a creep.

332
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,148
She thought I was a geek,
and she probabIy wasn't the first.

333
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,614
You are so odd.

334
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,989
-No.
-I've got it!

335
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,956
-No.
-I'II prove myseIf to you.

336
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,925
That's not necessary.

337
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:47,826
-Yeah, I'II soIve your IittIe probIem.
-Okay.

338
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,662
And then you'II say, ''Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done.

339
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,861
-I wonder what makes him tick.''
-I wonder.

340
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,031
''I wonder if he'd be interested
in knowing what makes me tick.''

341
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,802
I'II bet you're gonna be thinking
about me after I'm gone.

342
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,570
I bet I am.

343
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,775
No kiss?

344
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,694
To our first customer.

345
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,955
To our first and onIy customer.

346
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,926
I'II need to draw some petty cash.

347
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,899
I shouId take her out to dinner.
We don't want to Iose her.

348
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:31,200
This magnificent feast here
represents the Iast of the petty cash.

349
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,539
Hey, sIow down. Chew your food.

350
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,113
HeIIo, Ghostbusters.

351
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,585
Yes, of course they're serious.

352
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,080
You do?

353
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,625
You have?

354
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,556
No kidding.

355
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,594
WeII, just give me the address.

356
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,499
Yes, of course.
Oh, they'II be totaIIy discreet.

357
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,305
Thank you.

358
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,732
We got one!

359
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,343
It's a caII!

360
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,452
Come on!

361
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,390
Hey, anybody see a ghost?

362
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,895
-Thank you for coming so quickIy.
-Jesus!

363
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,902
The guests are asking questions,
and I'm running out of excuses.

364
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,300
Has it happened before?

365
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,136
WeII, most of the originaI staff
knows about the 1 2th fIoor.

366
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,800
-The disturbances, I mean.
-Yeah.

367
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,913
But it's been quiet for years
up untiI two weeks ago.

368
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,844
It was never, ever this bad, though.

369
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:23,078
-Did you ever report it to anyone?
-No. Heavens, no.

370
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,848
The owners don't Iike us
to even taIk about it.

371
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,083
I hope we couId take care
of this quietIy.

372
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,487
-It's done.
-Tonight.

373
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,219
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

374
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,990
We handIe this kind of thing
aII the time.

375
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,506
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of a cosmonaut?

376
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,545
No, we're exterminators. Somebody
saw a cockroach up on 1 2th.

377
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:54,117
-That's gotta be some cockroach.
-Bite your head off, man.

378
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,417
-Going up?
-I'II take the next one.

379
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:07,897
It just occurred to me we haven't had
a successfuI test of this equipment.

380
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,261
-I bIame myseIf.
-So do I.

381
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,461
-WeII, no sense worrying about it now.
-Why worry?

382
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:18,166
Each of us is wearing an unIicensed
nucIear acceIerator on his back.

383
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:22,803
Yep. WeII, Iet's get ready.
Switch me on.

384
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,512
What the heII are you doing?

385
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,184
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

386
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,381
We thought you were someone eIse.

387
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,695
SuccessfuI test.

388
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,825
I guess so.

389
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,458
-I think we'd better spIit up.
-Good idea.

390
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,602
Yeah, we can do
more damage that way.

391
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,366
Venkman? Venkman!

392
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,473
Disgusting bIob.

393
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,543
I'm gonna have to hoId him myseIf.

394
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,885
Come in, Ray.

395
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,425
Venkman! I saw it! I saw it!

396
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,593
It's right here, Ray.

397
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,322
It's Iooking at me.

398
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,433
He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?

399
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,091
I think he can hear you, Ray.

400
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,203
Don't move. It won't hurt you.

401
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,743
Venkman!

402
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:14,210
Venkman! Pete!

403
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,846
Venkman, what happened?
Are you okay?

404
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,456
He sIimed me.

405
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:24,026
That's great! ActuaI physicaI contact!

406
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,356
-Can you move?
-Ray. Ray! Come in, please!

407
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,862
I feeI so funky.

408
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,523
SpengIer! I'm with Venkman.

409
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,201
He got sIimed!

410
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,600
That's great, Ray. Save some for me.

411
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,240
Get down here, right away!
It just went into a ballroom.

412
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,636
Okay, we'II be right there.

413
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,114
Sir, if you and your staff
couId pIease wait out here...

414
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,750
...we'II take care of everything.

415
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,694
There it is. On the ceiIing.

416
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,407
That's the one that got me.

417
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,382
AII right, boys.

418
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,281
Ready?

419
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,785
Throw it!

420
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,798
I did that. I did that.

421
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,629
-That's my fauIt.
-It's okay. The tabIe broke the faII.

422
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,628
There's something very important
I forgot to teII you.

423
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,138
-What?
-Don't cross the streams.

424
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,874
-Why?
-It wouId be bad.

425
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,772
I'm fuzzy on the whoIe goodlbad thing.
What do you mean, ''bad''?

426
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:54,440
Imagine aII Iife as you know it stopping
instantaneousIy and every moIecuIe...

427
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,053
...in your body expIoding
at the speed of Iight.

428
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,483
TotaI protonic reversaI.

429
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,593
Right, that's bad. Okay,
important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

430
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:08,164
AII right, Ray, take the Ieft.
Egon, take the right.

431
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,333
Okay, Ray, just give me
one high and outside.

432
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,237
Ray!

433
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,380
Egon!

434
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,146
Okay, aII right.
HoId it, hoId it, hoId it!

435
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,219
Nice shooting, Tex!

436
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,728
I assure you, there is no probIem
with the room.

437
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,162
It'II be ready as soon as your guests
are with us.

438
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,325
It took something out of him,
but he'II move.

439
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,495
I need some room to put the trap
down. Give me some room.

440
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,638
You'II excuse me, pIease.

441
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,074
-Gotta get this in the cIear.
-Wait, wait, wait!

442
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,846
I've aIways wanted to do this.

443
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,579
And....

444
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,623
-The fIowers are stiII standing!
-Okay, on my go-signaI.

445
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:12,024
SpengIer, I want a confinement stream
from you, okay? Go!

446
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,960
Okay, hoId him up there.
He's gonna move. HoId him up!

447
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,531
Go!

448
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,360
-It's working, Ray.
-Start bringing him down.

449
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,130
You got him. Don't cross the stream.

450
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:26,470
Maybe now you'II never sIime a guy
with a positron coIIider, huh?

451
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,977
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

452
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,206
I'm opening the trap now.
Don't Iook directIy into the trap.

453
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,979
I Iooked at the trap, Ray.

454
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:40,556
Turn your streams off when I cIose
the trap. Get ready. I'm cIosing it.

455
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,659
Now!

456
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,543
It's in there.

457
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,011
WeII, that wasn't such a chore,
now, was it?

458
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,119
Mr. Smith, quickIy.
I want that door open now!

459
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,054
DonaId, stand over there.

460
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,422
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

461
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,995
Did you see it? What is it?

462
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,426
We got it.

463
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,590
What is it?
WiII there be any more of them?

464
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,760
What you had there
was what we refer to as a focused...

465
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:30,668
...non-terminaI repeating phantasm,
or a cIass-five fuII-roaming vapor.

466
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,570
ReaI nasty one too.

467
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,608
And now...

468
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,041
...Iet's taIk seriousIy.

469
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:40,616
For the entrapment, we're gonna have
to ask you for four big ones, $4000.

470
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,948
But we are having a speciaI this week
on proton charging...

471
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,554
...and storage of the beast.

472
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,055
That's onIy gonna come to
1 000 doIIars, fortunateIy.

473
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,854
Five thousand doIIars? I had no idea
it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

474
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,190
WeII, that's aII right.
We can just put it back.

475
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,230
We certainIy can, Dr. Venkman.

476
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,029
No! AII right! Anything.

477
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,466
Thanks so much.

478
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,368
Thank you. Hope
we can heIp you again.

479
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,408
Coming through! One cIass-five
free-roaming vapor.

480
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,512
Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today, the entire Eastern seaboard...

481
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,945
...is alive with talk of incidents
of paranormal activity.

482
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,052
Alleged ghost-sightings
and supernatural occurrences...

483
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,950
...have been reported
across the entire tri-state area.

484
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,523
Everybody has heard ghost stories
around the campfire.

485
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,855
My grandma used to spin yarns
about a spectraI Iocomotive...

486
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,520
...that wouId rocket past the farm
where she grew up.

487
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,791
But now, as if
some unforeseen authority....

488
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,518
Stand aside, pIease!

489
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,817
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic, ghosts and ghostbusting.

490
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,654
The controversy buiIds,
more sightings are reported.

491
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,318
Some maintain that these...

492
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:03,194
...professionaI paranormaI eIiminators
in New York are the cause of it aII.

493
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,168
I got it! I got it!

494
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,970
Pete! Ray!

495
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,213
Still making headlines
all across the country...

496
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,983
...the Ghostbusters are at it again,
this time at the dance club...

497
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,959
... The Rose. The boys in gray slugged
it out with a pesky poltergeist...

498
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:36,031
...then stayed to dance with the ladies
who witnessed the disturbance.

499
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,226
This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.

500
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,530
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

501
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,401
No job is too big. No fee is too big.

502
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,334
Is it just a mist,
or does it have arms and Iegs?

503
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,276
As they say in TV, I'm sure
there's one big question...

504
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,509
...on everybody's mind, and I imagine
you are the man to answer that.

505
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,848
How is Elvis,
and have you seen him lately?

506
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,429
Do you beIieve in UFOs,
astraI projections...

507
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,036
...mentaI teIepathy, ESP,
cIairvoyance...

508
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:50,230
...spirit photography,
teIekinetic movement...

509
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:55,310
...fuII-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of AtIantis?

510
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:59,609
If there's a steady paycheck in it,
I'II beIieve anything you say.

511
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,753
I gotta get some sIeep. I'm dying.

512
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,354
You don't Iook good.

513
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,491
-I don't?
-WeII, you've Iooked better.

514
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,285
You didn't used to Iook Iike this.

515
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,360
Can you hoId, pIease?

516
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,089
Here's the paper on the BrookIyn.
She paid with Visa.

517
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,426
Here's tonight's worksheet.

518
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,227
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.

519
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:21,394
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

520
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,439
BeautifuI. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

521
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,907
-CongratuIations.
-Can you heIp me, pIease?

522
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,838
WeIcome aboard.

523
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,609
I don't know where they get
these guest conductors.

524
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,381
It's not gonna do him much good
to scream at us in German.

525
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,958
WeII, I don't think that the man
is competent to conduct...

526
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,560
...a major symphony orchestra.

527
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:50,893
-CouId you wait here a minute?
-Sure.

528
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,503
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

529
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,940
-That was a wonderfuI rehearsaI.
-You heard that?

530
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,045
Yes. You're the best one in your row.

531
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,646
Oh, thank you.

532
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:08,376
You're good. Most peopIe can't hear
me with the whoIe orchestra pIaying.

533
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,144
I don't have to take this abuse.

534
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,619
I got hundreds of peopIe
dying to abuse me.

535
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,849
I know. You're a big ceIebrity now.

536
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:18,222
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

537
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,227
Who's the stiff?

538
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,938
The ''stiff'' happens to be one of
the finest musicians in the worId.

539
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,005
Do you have information
for me, pIease?

540
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,574
WeII, sure, but I prefer
to give it to you in private.

541
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:36,144
-Why don't you teII me now.
-Okay. I found the name ZuuI for you.

542
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:41,808
The name ZuuI refers to a demigod
worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the....

543
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,187
What's that word?

544
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,946
-''Hittites.''
-Hittites...

545
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,217
...the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

546
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,595
''ZuuI was the minion of Gozer.''

547
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,958
What's Gozer?

548
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:59,466
-Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
-WeII, what's he doing in my icebox?

549
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,504
I'm working on that. If we couId
get together Thursday night...

550
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:06,006
...I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we couId exchange information.

551
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:09,475
I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.

552
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,048
Miss Barrett, you seem to think there
is something wrong up here that says:

553
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:17,415
''He enjoys taking his evenings off
and spending it with his cIients.''

554
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,489
No. I'm making a speciaI exception
in your case...

555
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,216
...because...

556
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,888
...I respect you.

557
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,188
It's corny, but I respect you
as an artist.

558
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:30,459
As a dresser too. This is a magnificent
coordination you have going today.

559
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,932
-See you Thursday.
-I'II bring the Roylance Guide...

560
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,298
...and we'II eat and read.

561
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,176
-So who the heII is that?
-He's just a friend.

562
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,747
-A friend?
-An oId friend.

563
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,611
Bye! WeII, I'II see you Thursday!

564
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:51,482
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm gIad you're feeIing much better.

565
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:54,522
You're stiII very paIe, though.
A IittIe sun.

566
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,354
-WeII, what does he do?
-He's a scientist.

567
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,870
This is where we store aII the vapors
and entities and sIimers that we trap.

568
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:18,504
Very simpIe, reaIIy. A Ioaded trap
here. Open, unIock the system.

569
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:19,910
Insert the trap.

570
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:23,753
ReIease.

571
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:28,318
CIose, Iock the system.
Set your entry grid.

572
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,925
Neutronize your fieId.

573
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,057
And...

574
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,857
...when the Iight is green,
the trap is cIean.

575
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,967
The ghost is incarcerated here
in our custom storage faciIity.

576
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:41,730
There's a man from the EPA here
to see you. He's waiting in your office.

577
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,567
-EPA? What's he want?
-I don't know.

578
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,711
AII I do know is I've been working
two weeks without a break...

579
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,574
...and you promised me
you'd hire more heIp.

580
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,080
Janine, someone
with your quaIifications...

581
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,118
...wouId have no troubIe finding
a topfIight job in either...

582
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,120
...the food service or
housekeeping industries.

583
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:04,952
-Are you gonna answer that?
-I've quit better jobs than this.

584
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,596
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

585
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:07,898
-Can I heIp you?
-I'm WaIter Peck.

586
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,332
-Can I heIp you?
-I'm WaIter Peck.

587
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:14,198
I represent the EnvironmentaI
Protection Agency, the third district.

588
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,862
Great. How's it going down there?

589
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,077
Are you Peter Venkman?

590
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,740
Yes, I'm...

591
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,142
...Dr. Venkman.

592
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:28,113
ExactIy what are you a doctor of,
Mr. Venkman?

593
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,686
WeII, I have Ph.D.'s in parapsychoIogy
and psychoIogy.

594
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,287
I see.

595
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,325
And now you catch ghosts.

596
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,485
Yeah. You couId say that.

597
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,488
And how many ghosts have you
caught, Mr. Venkman?

598
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,328
-I'm not at Iiberty to say.
-And where do you put...

599
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:48,369
...these ghosts
once you catch them?

600
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,007
Into a storage faciIity.

601
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,503
And wouId this storage faciIity
be Iocated on these premises?

602
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:59,342
-Yes.
-And may I see this storage faciIity?

603
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:02,883
-No.
-And why not, Mr. Venkman?

604
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,685
Because you did not use
the magic word.

605
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,555
What is the magic word,
Mr. Venkman?

606
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,293
''PIease.''

607
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,399
May I pIease see the storage faciIity,
Mr. Venkman?

608
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,096
Why do you want to see it?

609
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,537
WeII, because I'm curious.

610
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,073
I want to know more about
what you do here.

611
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,305
There've been a Iot of wiId
stories in the media...

612
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,211
...and we want to assess
any possibIe environmentaI impact...

613
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,715
...from your operation.

614
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,911
For instance, the presence
of noxious...

615
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,387
...possibIy hazardous waste chemicaIs
in your basement.

616
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:45,756
Now, you show me what is down there,
or I come back with a court order.

617
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:50,859
You go get a court order, and I'II sue
your ass for wrongfuI prosecution!

618
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,399
You can have it your way,
Mr. Venkman.

619
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,496
I'm worried. It's crowded in there,
and my data...

620
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,472
...points to something big
on the horizon.

621
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,578
What do you mean ''big''?

622
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,583
WeII, Iet's say this Twinkie
represents the normaI amount...

623
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:10,311
...of psychokinetic energy
in the New York area.

624
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:14,218
According to this morning's sampIe,
it wouId be a Twinkie...

625
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,918
...35 feet Iong, weighing
approximateIy 600 pounds.

626
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,024
That's a big Twinkie.

627
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,462
We couId be on the verge
of a fourfoId cross-rip...

628
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,228
...a PKE surge of incredibIe,
even dangerous, proportions.

629
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:31,140
We just had a visit from the
EnvironmentaI Protection Agency.

630
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,503
-How's the grid hoIding up?
-Not good.

631
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,542
TeII him about the Twinkie.

632
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,038
What about the Twinkie?

633
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,567
-Oh, Dana, it's you.
-HeIIo, Louis.

634
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,572
You gotta come in here.
You're missing a cIassic party.

635
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,906
Yes, weII, I wouId, Louis,
but I have a date coming over.

636
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,708
You made a date...

637
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:54,153
-...tonight?
-WeII, I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

638
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,956
Oh, that's okay.
You can bring him aIong.

639
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:02,559
AII right. Maybe we'II stop by, okay?

640
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,591
That's great. I'II teII everybody.

641
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,669
We're gonna pIay Twister,
we're gonna do some breakdancing....

642
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,635
Hey--

643
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:14,207
Hey, Iet me in! It's Louis!
Somebody, Iet me in!

644
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,860
HeIIo?

645
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,097
Hi, Mom.

646
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,968
I've been busy.

647
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,633
WeII.... No, everything is fine.

648
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:51,008
Yeah. No, just that one time.

649
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,240
Oh, I am.

650
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,880
I wiII.

651
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:01,784
I won't. Mom, I have to go.
I have a date.

652
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:06,189
Yes. No, no one you know. It's....

653
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,928
WeII, he's a Ghostbuster.

654
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,695
Those guys on TV.

655
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,434
Yes, weII, I'II have to Iet you know.

656
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,073
Okay. Love to Dad.

657
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,836
Right. Bye. Bye.

658
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,257
Oh, shit.

659
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:15,932
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength TyIenoI?

660
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,992
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength TyIenoI?

661
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:22,400
Gee, I think aII I got is
acetyIsaIicyIic acid. Generic.

662
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:26,406
I can get 600 tabIets of that for the
same price as 300 of the name brand.

663
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,806
Makes good financiaI sense.
Good advice.

664
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,573
Hey, this is reaI smoked saImon
from Nova Scotia, Canada...

665
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:32,976
...2 4.95 a pound.

666
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,516
It onIy cost me 1 4.1 2
after tax, though.

667
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,482
I'm giving this as
a promotionaI expense.

668
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:41,556
That's why I invited cIients instead
of friends. Having a good time, Marv?

669
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,250
How you doing? Have some Brie.
It's at room temperature.

670
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,224
You think it's too warm for Brie?

671
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:48,557
Louis, I'm going home.

672
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,394
Don't Ieave yet. Listen,
maybe if we start dancing...

673
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,559
...other peopIe wiII join in.

674
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,602
Okay.

675
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,242
Oh, don't move.
I just gotta get the door.

676
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,374
-Ted! Annette!
-Hi.

677
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,948
I'm gIad you couId come.
Give me your coats.

678
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,608
Everybody, this is Ted
and Annette FIeming.

679
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,048
How are you?

680
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:14,088
Ted has a smaII carpet-cIeaning
business in receivership.

681
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,488
Annette's drawing a saIary from
a deferred bonus from two years ago.

682
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:21,688
They got 1 5,000 Ieft
on the house at 8 percent.

683
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,231
So they're okay!

684
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,665
Does anybody want
to pIay Parcheesi?

685
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,569
Okay, who brought the dog?

686
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:58,526
HeIp! There's a bear Ioose
in my apartment! HeIp! HeIp!

687
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,269
HeIp!

688
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,465
-What?
-A bear in his apartment.

689
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,040
I'm gonna bring this up
at the tenants' meeting.

690
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:15,582
There's not supposed to be
any pets in the buiIding.

691
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:35,333
Let me in. There's gotta be a way
in here. I gotta get--

692
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:41,442
Somebody, Iet me in!

693
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,081
Nice doggy.

694
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,186
Cute IittIe pooch.

695
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:54,255
Maybe I got a MiIk-Bone.

696
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,643
-What happened?
-Some moron brought...

697
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,872
...a cougar to a party,
and it went berserk.

698
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,082
Hi, I'm going up to Dana Barrett's.

699
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,331
HeIIo?

700
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,369
That's a different Iook for you,
isn't it?

701
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,606
Are you the Keymaster?

702
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,477
Not that I know of.

703
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,524
Are you the Keymaster?

704
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,928
Yes.

705
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,270
I'm a friend of his.
He toId me to meet him here.

706
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,499
-I didn't get your name.
-I am ZuuI.

707
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,836
I am the Gatekeeper.

708
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:31,450
-What are we doing today, ZuuI?
-Prepare for the coming of Gozer.

709
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,779
Gozer, huh?

710
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,654
The Destructor.

711
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,196
Are we stiII going out?

712
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,900
You know, you couId pick up the pIace
if you're expecting someone.

713
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,477
Do you want this body?

714
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,614
Is this a trick question?

715
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,483
I guess the roses worked, huh?

716
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,713
Take me now...

717
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,482
...sub-creature.

718
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,489
We never taIk anymore.

719
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:16,631
Easy. I make it a ruIe never to get
invoIved with possessed peopIe.

720
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,700
It's more of a guideIine than a ruIe.

721
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,269
You know, I can--

722
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,839
I want you inside me.

723
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,769
Go ahead. No, I can't.

724
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,640
Sounds Iike you got at Ieast
two peopIe in there aIready.

725
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,645
Might be a IittIe crowded.

726
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:35,080
Come on, why don't you
just quit trying...

727
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:38,345
...to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman
and just reIax.

728
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:42,082
Lie down there. ReIax.
Put your hands on your chest.

729
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:45,091
What I'd reaIIy Iike to do
is taIk to Dana.

730
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,126
I want to taIk to Dana.

731
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,696
Dana, it's Peter.

732
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:52,596
There is no Dana.
There is onIy ZuuI.

733
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,702
Oh, ZuuIie, you nut. Come on.

734
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,637
Come on, I want to taIk
to Dana. Dana.

735
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,173
Just reIax. Come on. Dana.

736
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,243
Dana. Can I taIk to Dana?

737
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:06,143
There is no Dana, onIy ZuuI.

738
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,910
What a IoveIy singing voice
you must have.

739
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,076
Now, I'm gonna count
to three, ZuuIie.

740
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,812
And if I don't taIk to Dana...

741
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:16,683
...there's gonna be some reaI troubIe
in this apartment, I think.

742
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,293
One.

743
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,324
Two.

744
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:25,560
Two and a haIf.

745
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:11,007
PIease come down.

746
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:13,182
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.

747
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:18,484
I am the Keymaster.
The Destructor is coming.

748
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,715
The TraveIer. The Destroyer.

749
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,259
Gatekeeper.

750
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,333
I am Vinz.

751
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,906
Vinz CIortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

752
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,670
VoIguus ZiIdrohar, Lord of the
SebouiIIia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

753
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:45,780
He puIIs the wagon, I make
the deaIs. You want a ride?

754
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:58,653
Wait for the sign.
Then aII prisoners wiII be reIeased.

755
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:02,423
You wiII perish in fIame,
you and aII your kind! Gatekeeper!

756
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,129
What an asshoIe.

757
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:13,371
-Dropping off or picking up?
-Dropping off.

758
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,534
Just a moment.

759
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:20,845
-You a Ghostbuster?
-Yes.

760
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,178
We picked up this guy.
We don't know what to do.

761
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,685
BeIIevue doesn't want him.
I'm afraid to Iock him up.

762
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,618
I know you guys are into this
stuff, so I figured we'd check.

763
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,691
AII right.

764
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,890
Are you the Gatekeeper?

765
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,199
You better bring him inside.

766
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,829
You are so kind to take
care of that man.

767
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,908
You know, you are
a reaI humanitarian.

768
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,510
I don't think he's human.

769
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,011
What did you say your name was?

770
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,217
Vinz CIortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

771
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,553
According to this,
his name's Louis TuIIy.

772
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:07,161
Lives on CentraI Park West.

773
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,333
Do you want some coffee, Mr. TuIIy?

774
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,535
-Do I?
-Yes, have some.

775
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:14,965
Yes, have some.

776
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,434
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

777
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,306
-What sign are you waiting for?
-Gozer the TraveIer.

778
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:25,709
He wiII come in one
of the pre-chosen forms.

779
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:30,148
During rectification of the VuIdronaii,
the TraveIer came as a Iarge Torb.

780
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,087
Then, during the third reconciIiation
of the Meketrex suppIicants...

781
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,749
...they chose a new form for him,
that of a giant SIoar!

782
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:40,327
Many Shubs and ZuuIs knew
what it was to be roasted...

783
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,056
...in the depths of the SIoar that day,
I can teII you.

784
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:46,565
-Egon.
-Excuse me.

785
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,732
There's something very strange
about that man.

786
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,707
I'm usuaIIy very psychic,
and I have a terribIe feeIing...

787
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,973
...that something awfuI
is gonna happen to you.

788
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,478
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

789
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,048
I'II get it.

790
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:12,022
-HeIIo?
-Egon, it's Peter.

791
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:15,426
-Thanks, I've got it.
-I have news from the worId of Gozer.

792
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:18,761
-What is it, Peter?
-I'm here with Dana Barrett.

793
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,563
It seems the Goz has been
putting some moves...

794
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,764
-...on my wouId-be girIfriend.
-How is she?

795
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:28,502
I think we can get her
a guest shot on Wild Kingdom.

796
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:31,579
I just whacked her up
with about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

797
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,878
She's gonna take a IittIe nap now,
but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

798
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,452
-Does that make any sense to you?
-Some.

799
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:41,215
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

800
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,120
Oh, wonderfuI. We have
to get these two together.

801
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:49,062
I think that wouId be
extraordinariIy dangerous.

802
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,565
Okay, weII, hoId onto him.
I'II be there in a IittIe whiIe.

803
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,930
Good.

804
01:02:55,104 --> 01:03:00,041
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find Ray.
I need him here immediateIy.

805
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,981
Bad news, honey, I gotta go to work.

806
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:11,052
Hey, wiII you stay here in bed
untiI I get back?

807
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:25,032
-Hey, Ray, do you beIieve in God?
-Never met him.

808
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:29,729
Yeah, weII, I do. And I Iove
Jesus' styIe, you know?

809
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:33,808
This roof cap is made of
a magnesium-tungsten aIIoy.

810
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,308
What are you so invoIved
with there?

811
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,812
These are bIueprints for the ironwork
in Dana Barrett's apartment...

812
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,780
...and they're very, very strange.

813
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:46,479
Hey, Ray, do you remember
something in the BibIe about...

814
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,649
...the Iast days, when the dead
wouId rise from the grave?

815
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,926
I remember ReveIations 7:1 2.

816
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,490
And I Iooked as he opened
the sixth seaI.

817
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,634
And behoId, there was
a great earthquake.

818
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,201
And the sun became
as bIack as sackcIoth.

819
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,129
And the moon became as bIood.

820
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:06,241
And the seas boiIed.
And the skies feII.

821
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:11,002
-Judgment day.
-Judgment day.

822
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,047
Every ancient reIigion has its myth
about the end of the worId.

823
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:17,914
Myth? Ray, has it ever
occurred to you...

824
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,214
...maybe the reason
we've been so busy...

825
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:23,517
...is because the dead have
been rising from the grave?

826
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:33,092
-How about a IittIe music?
-Yeah.

827
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,565
This way.

828
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:26,714
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Just where do you think you're going?

829
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:29,915
Step aside, or you'II be arrested
for interfering with the poIice.

830
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,560
Oh, no. HoId on. I've seen TV.
You can't come in here...

831
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,355
...without a warrant or a writ.

832
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,590
Cease and Desist AII Commerce
order. Seizure of Premises.

833
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,565
Ban of PubIic UtiIities
for Non-Licensed Waste HandIers...

834
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:43,534
...and a federaI
Entry and Inspection order.

835
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,534
Vinz, there's one more test
I'd Iike to perform.

836
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:51,169
Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

837
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:55,078
-Excuse me, this is private property.
-Shut this off. Shut these aII off.

838
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:58,118
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines is hazardous.

839
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,619
I'II teII you hazardous.
You're facing prosecution...

840
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,054
...for a haIf-a-dozen
environmentaI vioIations.

841
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:05,659
You shut off these beams,
or we shut them off for you.

842
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:13,163
Understand, this is a high-voItage
Iaser containment system.

843
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:16,169
SimpIy turning it off wouId be
Iike dropping a bomb in the city.

844
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:19,672
Don't patronize me. I'm not stupid,
Iike the peopIe you biIk.

845
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:23,300
At ease, officer. I'm Peter Venkman.
There's been a misunderstanding...

846
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,504
...and I want to cooperate
in any way I can.

847
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:28,206
Forget it. You had your chance
to cooperate...

848
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:32,013
...but you thought it'd be more fun to
insuIt me. Now it is my turn, wise-ass.

849
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,179
He wants to shut down
the protection grid.

850
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:36,951
You shut that thing down,
we won't be heId responsibIe--

851
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:40,960
-You'II be responsibIe. Shut it off.
-No, we won't be heId responsibIe.

852
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:44,122
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

853
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,895
I've never seen anything Iike this.
I don't know--

854
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,562
Yeah, I'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

855
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,934
My friend, don't be a jerk.

856
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,671
-Step aside.
-If he does that again, you shoot him.

857
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,974
You do your job.
Don't teII me how to do mine.

858
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,879
-Thank you, officer.
-Shut it off!

859
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,041
Oh, shit.

860
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,753
CIear the buiIding!

861
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:16,786
This is it. This is the sign.

862
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:20,895
Yeah, it's a sign, aII right.
We're going out of business.

863
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,899
Hey, aim up there.

864
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:35,276
-What happened?
-Storage faciIity bIew.

865
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,969
-He shut off the protection grid.
-Oh, great.

866
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,944
-That's bad, isn't it?
-Yeah.

867
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,710
-Where's the Keymaster?
-Shit.

868
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:45,183
-Who's the Keymaster?
-Oh, come on.

869
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:48,284
HoId it. I want this man arrested.

870
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:51,893
These men are in criminaI vioIation
of the EnvironmentaI Protection Act.

871
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:54,655
-This expIosion is a direct resuIt of it.
-Your mother!

872
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,162
Come on, hoId it! HoId it! HoId it!

873
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:47,571
CoIumbia BuiIding, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry, so Iet's not dawdIe.

874
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,965
Hey, guard!

875
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,437
Look, I want to make a phone caII.

876
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:49,100
I just work with these guys.
I wasn't even there.

877
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,441
The structure of this roof cap
is Iike the teIemetry tracker...

878
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:56,608
...that NASA uses to identify
dead puIsars in deep space.

879
01:10:56,785 --> 01:11:02,849
CoId-riveted girders
with cores of pure seIenium.

880
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,118
Everybody getting this so far?

881
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:08,593
So what? I guess they just don't
make them Iike they used to.

882
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,096
No. Nobody ever made
them Iike this.

883
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:16,034
The architect was either a certified
genius or an authentic wacko.

884
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:19,231
Ray, for a moment...

885
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:22,536
...pretend that I don't know
anything about metaIIurgy...

886
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:27,944
...engineering or physics and just
teII me what the heII is going on.

887
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,218
You never studied.

888
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:34,587
The whoIe buiIding is a huge
superconductive antenna...

889
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,191
...that was designed and
buiIt for the purpose...

890
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,556
...of puIIing in and concentrating
spirituaI turbuIence.

891
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:46,326
Your girIfriend Iives in the
corner penthouse of spook centraI.

892
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:50,361
She's not my girIfriend.

893
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:54,031
I find her interesting because she's
a cIient and sIeeps above her covers.

894
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:58,202
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drooIs. She cIaws.

895
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,814
It's not the girI, Peter,
it's the buiIding.

896
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:05,010
Something terribIe is about to enter
our worId. This buiIding is the door.

897
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,155
The architect's name
was Ivo Shandor.

898
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,952
I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide.
He was aIso a doctor.

899
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,617
He performed a Iot
of unnecessary surgery.

900
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,663
And then, in 1 920,
he started a secret society.

901
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:20,632
-Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
-Right.

902
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,993
No studying.

903
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:28,769
After WorId War I, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

904
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,409
He wasn't aIone. He had cIose
to a thousand foIIowers when he died.

905
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:37,518
They conducted rituaIs
up on the roof...

906
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:41,247
...bizarre rituaIs intended to bring
about the end of the worId.

907
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:44,415
And now it Iooks Iike
it may actuaIIy happen.

908
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,927
We have to get out of here
and find a judge or something.

909
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:57,561
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey. HoId it.

910
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,905
Are we going to go
before a judge to say...

911
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:03,340
...that a BabyIonian god is
gonna drop in on CentraI Park West...

912
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,606
-...and start tearing up the city?
-Sumerian, not BabyIonian.

913
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,444
-Yeah, big difference.
-No offense...

914
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,279
...but I gotta get my own Iawyer.

915
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:14,047
Okay, Ghostbusters.
The mayor wants to see you guys.

916
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,123
The whoIe isIand's going crazy.
Let's go.

917
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:19,451
I gotta spIit. The mayor wants to
rap with me about some things.

918
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:47,114
-I am the Keymaster.
-I am the Gatekeeper.

919
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:34,027
-Back. Back. Stay back.
-Stay back. Stay back.

920
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:41,610
I've got a city bIowing up,
and you aren't giving me answers.

921
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:44,545
I've got a city bIowing up,
and you aren't giving me answers.

922
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:47,682
We're bIocking the bridges,
the roads--

923
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,374
The Ghostbusters are here.

924
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:52,281
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.

925
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:54,012
Hey, and where's this Peck?

926
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:58,285
Peck. I am WaIter Peck, sir, and
I am prepared to make a fuII report.

927
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,826
These men are consummate
snowbaII artists.

928
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,794
They use sense and nerve gases
to induce haIIucinations.

929
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:07,299
PeopIe think they're seeing ghosts,
and they caII these bozos...

930
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,869
...who show up to deaI
with the probIem...

931
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:11,903
...with a fake eIectronic Iight show.

932
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:14,668
Everything was fine with our system
untiI the power grid...

933
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,903
-...was shut off by dickIess here.
-They caused an expIosion.

934
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:23,978
-Is this true?
-Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

935
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:29,523
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up!

936
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,454
-AII right.
-WeII, that's what I heard.

937
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,151
This is City HaII.

938
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:36,388
Now, what am I gonna do here, John?
What is this?

939
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:39,227
AII I know is that was no Iight show
we saw this morning.

940
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:43,337
I've seen every form
of combustion known to man...

941
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,370
...but this beats the heII out of me.

942
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,009
The waIIs in the 53rd Precinct
were bIeeding.

943
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,667
-How do you expIain that?
-Good afternoon, gentIemen.

944
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,438
Oh, Your Eminence.

945
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,015
-How are you, Lenny?
-You're Iooking good, Mike.

946
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:04,750
We're in a reaI fix here.
What do you think I shouId do?

947
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:07,862
OfficiaIIy, the church
wiII not take any position...

948
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:11,397
...on the reIigious impIications
of these phenomena.

949
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,057
PersonaIIy, Lenny...

950
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:17,471
...I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.

951
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,273
That's a smart move, Mike.

952
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:21,170
I won't caII a press conference...

953
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:24,141
...and teII everyone to start praying.

954
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:29,014
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.

955
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:31,482
I've onIy been with the company
for a coupIe weeks.

956
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:34,281
But I gotta teII you,
these things are reaI.

957
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:38,490
Since I joined these men,
I have seen shit that'II turn you white.

958
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:40,953
WeII, you can beIieve Mr. Pecker.

959
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,689
-My name is Peck.
-Or you couId accept the fact...

960
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:47,232
...that this city is headed for
a disaster of bibIicaI proportions.

961
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:51,099
-WeII, what do you mean, ''bibIicaI''?
-What he means is OId Testament.

962
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,400
-ReaI wrath-of-God-type stuff.
-ExactIy.

963
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:57,011
Fire and brimstone down from
the skies. Rivers and seas boiIing.

964
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,647
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. VoIcanoes.

965
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:01,180
The dead rising from the grave.

966
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:05,309
Human sacrifice. Dogs and cats
Iiving together. Mass hysteria.

967
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:07,648
Enough! I get the point.

968
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:10,853
But what if you're wrong?

969
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:14,359
If I'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jaiI, peacefuIIy, quietIy.

970
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:18,056
We'II enjoy it. But if I'm right...

971
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:21,327
...and we can stop this thing....

972
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:26,941
Lenny, you wiII have
saved the Iives...

973
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:31,341
...of miIIions of registered voters.

974
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:40,686
I don't beIieve you're seriousIy
considering Iistening to these men.

975
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,530
Get him out of here.

976
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,327
-Bye.
-I'II fix you. I'm gonna fix you.

977
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,335
I'II get you a nice fruit basket.
I'm going to miss him.

978
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,904
AII right. AII right.

979
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:01,840
We got work to do. Now,
what do you need from me?

980
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:17,748
Come on, Iet's run some red Iights!

981
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:22,554
HeIIo, New York.

982
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,494
HeIIo, everybody!

983
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,999
Dr. Ray Stantz, wouId you pIease?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.

984
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:38,298
Thank you. They Iove you.
They Iove you here.

985
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:43,435
-I Iike that shirt, friend.
-Ghostbusters! AII right!

986
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:49,242
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.

987
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:52,215
Okay, whatever happens,
Iet's be professionaI.

988
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:26,888
We might have to put a IittIe
overtime in on this one.

989
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:24,903
There they are. There they are.

990
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:34,382
I was in no way prepared for that.

991
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:38,249
It's aII right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handIe it.

992
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:40,792
We can take it.
They want to pIay rough.

993
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:45,456
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters!

994
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,726
-Wanna pIay rough?
-Yeah.

995
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,667
Let's do it.

996
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,722
Where are we?

997
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:22,029
It Iooks Iike we're
in the teens somewhere.

998
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:26,435
WeII, when we get to 20, teII me.
I'm gonna throw up.

999
01:22:58,006 --> 01:23:02,636
-Twenty-two. Is this it?
-Yep.

1000
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,249
Art deco. Very nice.

1001
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:17,255
-Where is it?
-It's at the end of the haII.

1002
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,327
Hey, where do these stairs go?

1003
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,532
They go up.

1004
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:11,838
Okay, go ahead. Come on.
Go ahead.

1005
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:14,905
Watch it. Go ahead.

1006
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:55,587
Dana.

1007
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:13,931
Okay, so she's a dog.

1008
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:55,109
It's a girI.

1009
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:02,888
-It's Gozer.
-I thought Gozer was a man.

1010
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:06,925
-It's whatever it wants to be.
-Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

1011
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:08,562
Right.

1012
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:11,256
Go get her, Ray!

1013
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,773
Gozer the Gozerian?

1014
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:33,383
Good evening. As a duIy designated
representative of the city...

1015
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:35,079
...county and state of New York...

1016
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:37,554
...I order you to cease
aII supernaturaI activity...

1017
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:39,590
...and return to your pIace of origin...

1018
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:42,753
...or to the nearest convenient
paraIIeI dimension.

1019
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:45,593
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.

1020
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:48,327
Are you a god?

1021
01:26:54,842 --> 01:27:00,303
-No.
-Then die!

1022
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:30,236
Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a god, you say, ''Yes.''

1023
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:35,611
AII right. This chick is toast.

1024
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,420
-Got your stick?
-HoIding it.

1025
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:53,934
Heat them up!

1026
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:55,869
Smoking!

1027
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:59,304
-Make them hard.
-Ready!

1028
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:02,739
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

1029
01:28:05,346 --> 01:28:06,779
Throw it!

1030
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:19,558
-NimbIe IittIe minx, isn't she?
-We better go fuII stream.

1031
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:21,957
Aim for the fIattop.

1032
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,502
Wasn't so hard.

1033
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:41,371
We neutronized it.

1034
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:44,143
You know what that means?
A compIete particIe reversaI.

1035
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,152
And we had the tooIs.
We had the taIent.

1036
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,620
It's MiIIer time.

1037
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:54,455
-Ray, this Iooks extraordinariIy bad.
-Oh, no.

1038
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:56,119
What?

1039
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:07,368
Look out!

1040
01:29:30,131 --> 01:29:36,127
Sub-creatures. Gozer the Gozerian,
Gozer the Destructor...

1041
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:40,866
...VoIguus ZiIdrohar
the TraveIer has come.

1042
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,943
Choose and perish.

1043
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:47,570
What do you mean, ''choose''?
We don't understand.

1044
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:53,449
Choose. Choose the form
of the Destructor.

1045
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:58,217
Oh, I get it. I get it. Oh, very cute.

1046
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,627
Whatever we think of.
If we think of J. Edgar Hoover...

1047
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:05,061
...J. Edgar Hoover wiII appear and
destroy us, so empty your heads.

1048
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:08,168
Don't think of anything.
We've onIy got one shot at this.

1049
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:12,102
The choice is made.

1050
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:14,537
The TraveIer has come.

1051
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:16,768
Nobody choosed anything.

1052
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:18,411
-Did you choose anything?
-No.

1053
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:19,910
-Did you?
-My mind is bIank.

1054
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:22,515
I didn't choose anything!

1055
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,027
I couIdn't heIp it.

1056
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:37,123
It just popped in there.

1057
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:41,392
What? What just popped in there?

1058
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:44,037
-I tried to think--
-Look!

1059
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:47,931
-No! It can't be.
-What is it?

1060
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,872
-It can't be.
-What did you do, Ray?

1061
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:52,103
Oh, shit.

1062
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:05,083
It's the Stay Puft MarshmaIIow Man.

1063
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:38,691
There's something
you don't see every day.

1064
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,760
I tried to think of a harmIess thing.

1065
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:42,896
Something I Ioved
from my chiIdhood.

1066
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:47,865
Something that couId never, ever
possibIy destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1067
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:50,094
Nice thinking, Ray.

1068
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:53,029
We used to roast
Stay Puft marshmaIIows...

1069
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:55,038
...by the fire at Camp Waconda.

1070
01:31:56,844 --> 01:32:01,076
Ray, has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got Ieft?

1071
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:06,580
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rationaI thought.

1072
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:19,590
-Oh, no.
-Mother pus bucket.

1073
01:32:24,338 --> 01:32:26,863
Nobody steps on a church
in my town.

1074
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:30,010
One, two, three, roast him.

1075
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:51,457
Funny, us going out Iike this.

1076
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:54,032
KiIIed by a 1 00-foot
marshmaIIow man.

1077
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:57,329
We've been going about this wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is a saiIor.

1078
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:01,271
He's in New York. We get this
guy Iaid, we won't have any troubIe.

1079
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:08,238
I have a radicaI idea.
The door swings both ways.

1080
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,714
We couId reverse the particIe fIow
through the gate.

1081
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:12,910
How?

1082
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:15,351
-We'II cross the streams.
-Excuse me, Egon.

1083
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:17,252
You said crossing the streams
was bad.

1084
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,553
-Cross the streams.
-You're gonna endanger us.

1085
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:22,491
You're gonna endanger our cIient...

1086
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:25,689
...the nice Iady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

1087
01:33:25,866 --> 01:33:29,927
Not necessariIy. There's definiteIy
a very sIim chance we'II survive.

1088
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:39,409
I Iove this pIan. I'm excited
to be a part of it. Let's do it.

1089
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:43,277
This job is definiteIy not
worth 1 1 ,500 a year.

1090
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:48,411
Hurry.

1091
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:52,758
See you on the other side, Ray.

1092
01:33:54,996 --> 01:33:57,658
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

1093
01:34:06,007 --> 01:34:07,702
Let's turn them on, SpengIer!

1094
01:34:10,945 --> 01:34:13,209
Now, SpengIer!

1095
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,351
Get out of here!

1096
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,031
Winston.

1097
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,739
Are you aII right?

1098
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:24,416
Venkman?

1099
01:35:24,585 --> 01:35:25,916
SpengIer!

1100
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:28,411
Venkman!

1101
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:33,316
SpengIer.

1102
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:37,528
Oh, SpengIer. Oh, are you okay?

1103
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:39,791
I feeI Iike the fIoor of a taxicab.

1104
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:42,128
-Venky!
-Yeah, where are you?

1105
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:44,635
Oh, thank God.

1106
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,571
-You okay?
-I'm aII right.

1107
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,073
-You aII right?
-I'm aII right.

1108
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:51,541
-You aII right?
-Yeah. You okay?

1109
01:35:51,712 --> 01:35:53,202
Fine.

1110
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:04,457
It smeIIs Iike barbecued dog hair.

1111
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:06,927
Oh, Venkman.

1112
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:09,289
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1113
01:36:09,997 --> 01:36:12,932
I'm sorry. I just-- I just forgot.

1114
01:36:27,314 --> 01:36:28,906
Look!

1115
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:58,840
Somebody turn on the Iights!

1116
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:02,141
-HeIp! Somebody!
-Go check on that IittIe guy.

1117
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:09,589
What happened?

1118
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:20,528
Where am I?

1119
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:25,496
Oh, hi.

1120
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:27,737
You'II be aII right.

1121
01:37:28,242 --> 01:37:31,700
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1122
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:35,148
Are you okay?

1123
01:37:35,816 --> 01:37:37,681
Who are you guys?

1124
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:39,945
We're the Ghostbusters.

1125
01:37:42,723 --> 01:37:44,156
Who does your taxes?

1126
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:48,020
You know, Mr. TuIIy,
you are a most fortunate individuaI.

1127
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:50,493
-I know.
-You have been a participant in...

1128
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:54,532
...the biggest interdimensionaI cross
rip since the Tunguska bIast of 1 909.

1129
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,567
-FeIt great.
-We'd Iike to get a sampIe...

1130
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:59,638
-...of your brain tissue.
-Okay.

1131
01:38:02,676 --> 01:38:05,372
I Iove this town!

1132
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:51,214
Egon!

1133
01:38:58,198 --> 01:39:00,098
What's going on?

1134
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:03,501
Does anybody want to interview me?

1135
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:07,072
I'm an eyewitness. I was up there.

1136
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:09,769
I want to go with them in the car.
