1
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:52,715
- The coffin has your initials: JB.
- At this moment, rather him than me.

2
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:57,017
At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.

3
00:00:57,094 --> 00:01:00,514
Colonel Bouvar passed away in his sleep.

4
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:05,603
You sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself.

5
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:10,566
I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues.

6
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:21,827
Is there anything else our French station
can do for Monsieur Bond?

7
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:23,579
Later, perhaps.

8
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:37,093
As I said, later. Come on.

9
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:20,553
Madame.

10
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:24,140
I've come to offer
my sincere condolences.

11
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:30,771
My dear Colonel Bouvar, you shouldn't
have opened that car door by yourself.

12
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:31,791
<i>Ouvrez! Ouvrez!</i>

13
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:49,975
<i>Viens! Il est lŕ!</i>

14
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:19,839
- No man should be without one.
- Yes, very practical.

15
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:22,007
Get inside.

16
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:25,469
Hurry!

17
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,096
No parking here.

18
00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:58,599
Pardon, Monsieur Largo.

19
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:11,987
The Brotherhood for Assistance of
Stateless Persons is purely philanthropic.

20
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:15,533
We're only interested
in your rehabilitation.

21
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:21,831
We have arranged for visas with the
Brazilian Consulate. The brotherhood...

22
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:24,333
- Good morning, Mr Largo.
- Good morning.

23
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,627
- Nice to have you back again.
- Thank you.

24
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:29,255
- We pay back everything.
- No need.

25
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:33,884
We have certain funds from
private individuals who share our aim.

26
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:37,096
There are just one or two formalities...

27
00:08:54,989 --> 00:09:01,620
Sit down, Number Two.
We will discuss your NATO project later.

28
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:05,875
I regret to inform you all
of the death of SPECTRE Number Six.

29
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,503
Colonel Jacques Bouvar
was killed by an unknown assassin.

30
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:12,590
His services will be greatly missed.

31
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:16,844
We will now proceed with the
area financial reports. Number Seven?

32
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:22,224
Blackmail of the double agent
Matsou Fujiwa.

33
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:26,062
Unfortunately, only 40 million yen.

34
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,272
- All the man had.
- Number Ten?

35
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:33,569
Assassination of Perringe, the anti-matter
specialist who went over to the Russians.

36
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:37,156
Three million francs
from the Quai d'Orsay.

37
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,449
Number Five.

38
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:43,120
Our consultation fee
for the British train robbery: Ł250,000.

39
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:46,499
Number Eleven.

40
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:52,797
Distribution of Red China narcotics
in the United States: $2,300,000.

41
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,009
- Collected by Number Nine and myself.
- Two million, three?

42
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:01,472
Our expectations
were considerably higher, Number Eleven.

43
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:05,017
Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.

44
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,728
I anticipated that factor.

45
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:10,898
Are you sure all monies
have been accounted for

46
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:13,401
by yourself and Number Nine?

47
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:17,113
- To the penny, Number One.
- On the contrary.

48
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:22,076
I have satisfied myself that one of you
is clearly guilty of embezzlement.

49
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:28,416
SPECTRE is a fraternity whose strength
lies in the absolute integrity of members.

50
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:33,337
The culprit is known to me.
I have decided on the appropriate action.

51
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:57,153
Let us now proceed with new business.

52
00:10:57,236 --> 00:11:01,282
We will hear from Number Two,
who is in charge of our NATO project,

53
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:04,118
the most ambitious
SPECTRE has ever undertaken.

54
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:06,245
Your report, Number Two.

55
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:08,622
Thank you, Number One.

56
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:13,669
Our intention is to demand a ransom
from the North Atlantic Treaty powers

57
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:18,340
of $280 million, Ł100 million.

58
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:23,304
I have sent SPECTRE agent Count Lippe
to the South of England,

59
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:26,640
where he is making
the necessary preparations.

60
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:32,480
He is at a health clinic conveniently
located near the NATO air base.

61
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:36,484
Pat?
I'll see you when I've had a shower.

62
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:39,403
I'll soon be finished.
Mr Bond, Count Lippe.

63
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:44,575
You're not taking her away already?
She's the only joy in this dreary place.

64
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:48,162
I see you've discovered that, too.

65
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:50,581
- In about half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.

66
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:52,958
I've heard that before.

67
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,628
Nice to have met you, Mr Bond.

68
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,424
Funny-looking bruise. A fall?

69
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:03,886
A poker, in the hands of a widow.

70
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:07,973
I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.

71
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:11,477
Not this one.
He didn't like me at all.

72
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:17,108
- A red square with a spike through it.
- Yes, I think it's a tong sign.

73
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:20,444
The Red Dragon from Macao.
Ask Records to verify it.

74
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:24,365
Sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.
File it till you get back.

75
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:27,743
Moneypenny, next time I see you
I'll put you across my knee.

76
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:32,707
On yoghurt and lemon juice?
I can hardly wait.

77
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,336
- Come on, Pat. We're behind schedule.
- Coming.

78
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,673
I can't hear you, James.
Have you fainted?

79
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:16,394
You're late, Mr Bond.

80
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:18,854
Me?

81
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:21,565
Well, I'd never have recognised myself.

82
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,403
- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy by far.

83
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:28,489
Take off your bathrobe, please.

84
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:33,077
- You never say that as if you meant it.
- Arms above your head, please.

85
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:49,260
Behave yourself, Mr Bond.

86
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,806
I can see there's only one place
to keep you quiet.

87
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,477
- And what's this?
- A traction table for stretching the spine.

88
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:01,897
- Some patients call it "the rack".
- I'm not surprised.

89
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:04,066
Get on.

90
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:11,449
- Where's the kick-starter?
- Stop fooling around. Face down, please.

91
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:15,411
By the way, who is the man
in the room next to your Count Lippe?

92
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:18,956
I really don't know too much about him.
A Mr Angelo.

93
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,878
He's here with a private physician,
recuperating from an awful car crash.

94
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:29,383
There now. First time
I've felt really safe all day.

95
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:34,638
I'll look in and see how you're doing
in 15 minutes.

96
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:58,746
Nice to have met you, Mr Bond.

97
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,918
Come back.

98
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:14,011
Help. Help.

99
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:27,650
Mr Bond. Mr Bond.

100
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,318
Thank God.

101
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:32,446
Thank God. You could have been killed.

102
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:36,283
I must be six inches taller.

103
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:40,705
You poor dear.
I can't think how it could have happened.

104
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:44,834
I can tell you,
it's a miracle I came back when I did.

105
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:48,587
I can only think that you must have
pushed the switch accidentally.

106
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:50,631
You'd better come with me.

107
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:55,177
Spend a few minutes in the steam room.
It'll help to relax you.

108
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:57,930
- Yes...
- It might even shrink you back to size.

109
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:01,142
Somebody's going to wish
today had never happened.

110
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:05,563
You wouldn't tell Dr Wain?
Please. I'd lose my job.

111
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:10,234
Well, I suppose
my silence could have a price.

112
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:12,486
You don't mean...?

113
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,072
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

114
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,877
See you later, alligator.

115
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:03,204
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry. I'll tell the chef.

116
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:06,791
Let me out of this bloody machine. Help.

117
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:09,085
Help.

118
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:20,679
Mink.

119
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:24,183
It reduces the tensions.

120
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:27,353
Not mine.

121
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,954
- Major Derval's social secretary.
- I would like to speak to Mr Angelo.

122
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:47,039
- What's that?
- Mr Angelo.

123
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:50,501
I'm sorry. You got the wrong number.

124
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:53,963
You'd be more comfortable
if you took off...

125
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,383
- Yes?
- Major Derval?

126
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:59,552
- Yes.
- Your car is waiting.

127
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:03,514
I'll be down right away. Thank you.

128
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:06,267
My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.

129
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,272
You'll be late at the air base.
Besides, it will give you time to cool off.

130
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:13,649
You'll be here when I come back?

131
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:19,113
But I may not be in the mood then.

132
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:22,575
- Do you want to bet?
- You know your François, hm?

133
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:25,619
- I know me.
- All right, all right.

134
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:29,665
- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir?

135
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,628
- Happy landing.
- Thank you.

136
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,423
Be good, at least until I get back.

137
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,385
<i>Ciao.</i>

138
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:55,608
- Nobody saw us. The corridor is empty.
- Shut that door.

139
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:03,407
He's dead. Lippe, take over.
Are the doctor and ambulance outside?

140
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:06,410
- Everything, as arranged.
- Angelo.

141
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:09,663
Your breathing equipment.

142
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:13,376
Isolates you from the oxygen supply.

143
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,837
Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used.

144
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:20,174
And most important...

145
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:27,348
Not enough.
$100,000 is not enough.

146
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,559
- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.

147
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:34,730
Two years of my life,
studying the film, the reports,

148
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:39,110
plastic operations, voice lessons.

149
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:42,571
Make it a quarter of a million
or get someone else.

150
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:46,909
- There is no-one else.
- Exactly. I am Derval.

151
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:57,044
Put that away.
Angelo is right.

152
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:59,839
I'll inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.

153
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:02,758
This is merely a down payment.

154
00:21:02,842 --> 00:21:05,428
All right, but against quarter of a million.

155
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,430
Agreed.

156
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:10,099
His watch. Identification disc.

157
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:17,815
- <i>Au revoir.</i>
- No, no. He always says <i>ciao.</i>

158
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:21,944
- <i>Ciao.</i>
- And the cap is too far back on your head.

159
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:27,074
The rest of my money, just have it ready.

160
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,998
Come on. Get him into his pyjamas.

161
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:50,389
Sir. Identity, please, sir.

162
00:21:56,812 --> 00:21:58,481
Thank you, sir.

163
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,817
This is a normal training sortie.

164
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:06,072
You'll be accompanied by a NATO
representative, Commandant Derval.

165
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:08,407
Major Derval of NATO.

166
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:13,245
It's a routine flight.
You'll be flying a Vulcan at 45,000 feet,

167
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:16,749
armed with two atomic bombs, MOS type.

168
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:20,294
Fuses as usual in the white security box.

169
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:50,825
Those damned aeroplanes.

170
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:54,245
They're enough to drive you mad.

171
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:01,293
Unless, of course,
it's that mink glove of yours.

172
00:23:01,377 --> 00:23:04,380
I'll shut out the noise.

173
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:30,197
James? James, where are you going?

174
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:35,077
Nowhere.
I thought I'd take a little exercise.

175
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:37,246
You must be joking.

176
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:40,750
Come on.

177
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,213
Quiet.

178
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:49,712
Windsor Police. Can I help you?

179
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:51,881
County Police here. Hello? Hello?

180
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:02,975
- What's happening? What's going on?
- Could it be the front door bell?

181
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,437
- No, it most certainly could not.
- Hello.

182
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,399
Haven't you had enough exercise
for one evening?

183
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:13,027
It's funny you should say that.

184
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:22,661
Point of return:
45 minutes, 30 seconds.

185
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:27,708
- Switch from manual to auto.
- Right. Set on automatic.

186
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:32,713
Commandant? Like to change places
with the co-pilot? Better view up here.

187
00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:35,007
I'd be delighted to.

188
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:07,331
RAFJET Kilo Kilo Tango 56.

189
00:27:07,415 --> 00:27:13,379
This is Southern Radar.
You are now under positive radar control.

190
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:19,343
This is avoiding action.
Turn onto a heading of 0.92 degrees...

191
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:15,608
Request you report your position.

192
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,323
RAFJET Mike Bravo X-ray.

193
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:29,038
Request you report your position.
This is the bomber controller to RAFJET.

194
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:31,957
Mike Bravo X-ray 79.

195
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,751
Over.

196
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:40,007
Report your position.
Report your position.

197
00:28:51,018 --> 00:28:52,269
Take this.

198
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:56,190
- What's the flap, Dawson?
- OBNR, sir. NATO training flight.

199
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:59,860
Air traffic lost it on radar
and we can't pick it up.

200
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:02,613
- Was she losing altitude?
- Yes, rapidly.

201
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:05,825
We can't scan below 300 feet.
She may have gone down.

202
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:09,870
- Was she in trouble?
- Not according to the last report.

203
00:29:09,954 --> 00:29:13,290
- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, sir. MOS type.

204
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:15,918
Do a thorough search.

205
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:21,549
Notify the Admiralty at once - top priority.
Ask them to contact Washington.

206
00:29:49,577 --> 00:29:53,164
- Is there anything else in sight?
- No, all clear.

207
00:29:53,247 --> 00:29:56,625
Switch on the underwater landing lights.

208
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,624
- Open the underwater hatch.
- Open underwater hatch.

209
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:43,431
- Stand by to winch in the submarine!
- Man the winches!

210
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:50,980
- Give these bomb fuses to Mr Kutze.
- Right, sir.

211
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:57,319
Get the submarine up quickly,
and the bombs loaded.

212
00:35:57,403 --> 00:36:00,489
And you, Kutze.
Are you pleased with your new toys?

213
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:03,117
Some new safety device.
A secret control.

214
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,787
What can they have that
the great Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?

215
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:09,915
Life was much simpler
in my Warsaw laboratory.

216
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:13,461
Your share will amount to
how many Nobel prizes?

217
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,629
Bomb forward.

218
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:19,633
More, more, more. Hold it.

219
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:46,619
Paris, sir.
Number One on the scrambler.

220
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:51,374
Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.

221
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:56,045
Number Two has done well,
unlike Count Lippe,

222
00:36:56,128 --> 00:37:00,674
whose choice of Angelo might have
jeopardised the success of our project.

223
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:03,177
Send a message to the Execution Branch.

224
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:06,097
You will write, or telephone?

225
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,060
Day by day. I'm sorry to dash off.
There's been a bit of a flap at the office.

226
00:37:11,143 --> 00:37:14,021
- What kind of work do you do, anyway?
- I travel.

227
00:37:14,105 --> 00:37:17,400
A sort of a licensed trouble-shooter.

228
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:21,487
Mr Angelo.
Heart attack last night.

229
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,447
I'm not surprised.

230
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:28,244
- Keep in touch.
- Any time, James. Any place.

231
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:31,455
Another time, another place.

232
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,122
You are late.

233
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:57,666
Some people on the roads
really burn you up.

234
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:02,421
In the conference room. Something big.
Every 00 man in Europe's been rushed in.

235
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:07,301
- And the home secretary, too.
- His wife's probably lost her dog.

236
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:24,610
Well, now that we're all here...

237
00:39:29,073 --> 00:39:35,413
The prime minister has asked the home
secretary to represent him here today.

238
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:37,581
The home secretary.

239
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:43,963
Gentlemen, the tape you are about to hear
was received at 10 Downing Street today.

240
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,133
My dear Prime Minister.

241
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:51,470
Two atomic bombs,
numbers 456 and 457,

242
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:57,643
which were aboard NATO flight 759,
are now in the possession of SPECTRE.

243
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:01,814
Unless within the next seven days
your government pays to us

244
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:08,112
Ł100 million sterling,
in a manner to be designated by us,

245
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:13,701
we shall destroy a major city in England
or the United States of America.

246
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:16,996
Please signal your acceptance
of our terms by arranging

247
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:23,252
for Big Ben to strike
seven times at 6pm tomorrow.

248
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:29,258
The prime minister and the president
have talked together over the hotline

249
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:34,680
and have agreed that,
unless the bombs are recovered,

250
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:36,849
payment will have to be made.

251
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:40,978
To avoid general panic,
complete secrecy will be maintained,

252
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:43,147
and no press announcements.

253
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,318
The prime minister asks that your
department take charge of the operation.

254
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:49,570
Thank you, sir. Sir John.

255
00:41:06,003 --> 00:41:09,632
This circle represents
the full flying range of the Vulcan.

256
00:41:09,715 --> 00:41:13,844
Extensive search has failed to locate
any evidence of a crash or landing.

257
00:41:13,928 --> 00:41:18,849
Worldwide reports proved negative on all
airfields big enough to handle the Vulcan.

258
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:21,852
- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.

259
00:41:21,936 --> 00:41:24,563
Well, I'll leave you to carry on.

260
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:29,026
- We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.
- Thank you, sir.

261
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:33,239
You may now open
the folders in front of you.

262
00:41:41,622 --> 00:41:44,208
Code name: Thunderball.

263
00:41:47,044 --> 00:41:49,588
As you can see, we've very little to go on.

264
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:53,634
All the members of the crew
had top security clearance.

265
00:41:53,718 --> 00:41:57,346
You'll find their photographs
and service records in your files.

266
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:02,810
You'll be working with NATO, CIA,
and all allied intelligence units.

267
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:08,149
That's all, until you discuss
your individual assignments with me.

268
00:42:08,941 --> 00:42:14,905
I've assigned you to Station C, Canada.
Captain Pritchard will be your liaison.

269
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:18,200
Sir, I respectfully suggest
that you assign me to Nassau.

270
00:42:18,284 --> 00:42:23,289
Is there any other reason besides
your enthusiasm for water sports?

271
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:25,791
Perhaps this, sir.

272
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:28,669
Well?

273
00:42:28,753 --> 00:42:31,839
There was a photograph
of that man in your dossier.

274
00:42:31,922 --> 00:42:33,799
His name is Derval.

275
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:37,553
I saw him last night at Shrublands,
but he was dead.

276
00:42:37,636 --> 00:42:41,932
Not possible. He was seen boarding
the Vulcan. Took off last night.

277
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:46,228
If 007 says he saw Derval last night
at Shrublands and he was dead,

278
00:42:46,312 --> 00:42:49,190
that's enough for me to initiate enquiries.

279
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:50,900
Of course.

280
00:42:50,983 --> 00:42:54,320
- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister, sir.

281
00:42:56,113 --> 00:42:59,241
- Do you know where she is?
- Nassau.

282
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:01,660
Do you think she's worth going after?

283
00:43:02,328 --> 00:43:06,457
- I wouldn't have put it quite that way.
- You've only got four days.

284
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,212
- Don't spend your time sitting around.
- No, sir. I won't.

285
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:14,840
Good luck.

286
00:43:14,924 --> 00:43:16,592
Thank you, sir.

287
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:22,181
Smashing figure. I don't suppose
that has anything to do with your request.

288
00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:26,310
- Was ever a man more misunderstood?
- You can't pull the wool over my eyes.

289
00:43:26,394 --> 00:43:31,607
You may be able to con the old man,
but I know better. I could...

290
00:43:31,691 --> 00:43:33,859
So do I, Miss Moneypenny.

291
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:38,447
And I'll thank you
not to refer to me as "the old man".

292
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,201
I think I had a hat when I came in.

293
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:49,208
James...

294
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,585
How else will you recognise her?

295
00:43:51,669 --> 00:43:56,465
Couldn't miss. She has
two moles on the left thigh.

296
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,573
- Thank you, Mr...?
- James Bond.

297
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:06,327
I arrived soon after you went down.
I've been admiring your form.

298
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:10,331
Have you now? Your name's James Bond
and you've been admiring my form?

299
00:45:10,414 --> 00:45:13,709
Most girls just paddle around.
You swim like a man.

300
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:15,711
So do you.

301
00:45:15,795 --> 00:45:19,173
I've had quite a bit of practice.
Do you come here often?

302
00:45:19,256 --> 00:45:22,385
Whenever I'm bored.
Practically every day.

303
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:26,806
- What else do you do, and where?
- You don't waste time, do you?

304
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:28,682
- No.
- For effort.

305
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:32,561
Thank you.
I'll wear it, so you'll know me next time.

306
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:34,730
I was right. Couldn't miss.

307
00:45:34,814 --> 00:45:37,525
- I'm not with you.
- You soon will be.

308
00:45:41,195 --> 00:45:44,615
- Paula. Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.

309
00:45:47,993 --> 00:45:50,454
Tell London I made contact with the girl.

310
00:45:50,538 --> 00:45:56,961
It's not what I'd call contact,
but I'll pass it through you've seen the girl.

311
00:45:57,044 --> 00:45:58,879
Keep trying.

312
00:45:58,963 --> 00:46:01,298
It won't start.

313
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:11,976
Our motor's conked out.
Are you going near Coral Harbour?

314
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:14,061
I wasn't, but I could.

315
00:46:14,145 --> 00:46:17,314
I've a very important appointment there.

316
00:46:17,398 --> 00:46:19,150
Come aboard.

317
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:22,737
- You don't mind taking the service boat?
- Not at all.

318
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,573
Hurry up.

319
00:47:04,904 --> 00:47:09,075
- Perhaps we could lunch by the pool.
- How about your appointment?

320
00:47:25,674 --> 00:47:29,428
- How long have you been out here?
- About three weeks.

321
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:33,766
- Don't you ever stop asking questions?
- All right, change of tack.

322
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:38,688
- Have some of my conch chowder.
- You've been reading the wrong books.

323
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:41,732
- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.

324
00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:44,276
It just so happens
that I like conch chowder.

325
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:53,369
- Friend of yours?
- Works for my guardian.

326
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:57,456
- Your guardian has you watched?
- He likes to know where I am.

327
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,959
I don't blame him.

328
00:48:06,215 --> 00:48:09,427
- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?

329
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:13,514
I'm afraid so.
My guardian's yacht.

330
00:48:13,597 --> 00:48:16,809
- Really?
- He'll be expecting me.

331
00:48:16,892 --> 00:48:20,438
- May I come, meet your guardian?
- No.

332
00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:23,232
- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.

333
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:25,735
- Perhaps we can have dinner.
- No.

334
00:48:25,818 --> 00:48:29,488
- My dear, uncooperative Domino.
- How do you know that?

335
00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:32,575
How do you know
my friends call me Domino?

336
00:48:32,658 --> 00:48:34,744
It's on the bracelet on your ankle.

337
00:48:34,827 --> 00:48:37,747
What sharp little eyes you've got.

338
00:48:39,415 --> 00:48:41,542
Wait till you get to my teeth.

339
00:48:50,468 --> 00:48:53,596
Bye, then.
See you tomorrow on the beach.

340
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:29,423
- Ł500, please.
- <i>Certainement, monsieur.</i>

341
00:49:29,507 --> 00:49:31,592
Thanks.

342
00:49:33,886 --> 00:49:36,097
Sorry.

343
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,765
- There.
- Thank you.

344
00:49:37,848 --> 00:49:42,186
<i>Rien ne va plus.</i>
<i>Les jeux sont faits.</i>

345
00:49:48,567 --> 00:49:50,653
- 200.
- <i>Deux cents livres banco.</i>

346
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:55,116
<i>Banco.</i>

347
00:50:03,457 --> 00:50:04,667
<i>Carte.</i>

348
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,174
- Eight.
- <i>Huit ŕ la banque.</i>

349
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:14,552
Someone has to lose.

350
00:50:14,635 --> 00:50:18,180
Yes, I thought I saw
a spectre at your shoulder.

351
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:20,141
What do you mean?

352
00:50:20,224 --> 00:50:23,519
The spectre of defeat.
That your luck was due to change.

353
00:50:23,602 --> 00:50:28,274
We'll soon find out.
Any objection to raise the limit, say Ł500?

354
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:30,484
- Too big for me.
- Count me out, too.

355
00:50:30,568 --> 00:50:34,864
Perhaps you'd like to take the shoe.
My friend won't mind, Mr...?

356
00:50:34,947 --> 00:50:37,616
- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr Bond.

357
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:41,287
One of my associates spoke about you.

358
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,664
Nothing bad, I hope.

359
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:48,753
- <i>Un banco de cinq cents livres.</i>
- It's your spectre against mine.

360
00:50:48,836 --> 00:50:50,921
You wish to put the evil eye on me, hm?

361
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:54,133
We have a way to deal with that
where I come from.

362
00:50:54,216 --> 00:50:58,220
Well, you may hex me.
Let's see what it does for the cards.

363
00:50:58,304 --> 00:51:00,389
- No.
- <i>Non?</i>

364
00:51:00,473 --> 00:51:02,558
- Seven.
- Six.

365
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:07,146
<i>- Suivi.</i>
<i>- Banco suivi.</i>

366
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,912
- Eight.
- <i>Huit ŕ la banque.</i>

367
00:51:22,995 --> 00:51:25,081
- Nine.
- <i>Neuf ŕ la banque.</i>

368
00:51:26,207 --> 00:51:28,959
You seem to be unbeatable, Mr Bond.

369
00:51:29,043 --> 00:51:31,128
This sort of thing can't last.

370
00:51:31,212 --> 00:51:34,382
- Emilio, you promised me a drink.
- Soon, my dear.

371
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:39,428
- I want to get my money back first.
- May I be allowed to buy the lady a drink?

372
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:43,015
- I would appreciate that. Thank you.
- Then I must pass the shoe.

373
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,685
<i>La main passe.</i>

374
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,561
<i>Banco.</i>

375
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:50,272
He'll be impossible
if his luck doesn't change.

376
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:53,776
Somehow I don't think it will tonight.

377
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,946
Beluga caviar,
Dom Perignon '55.

378
00:51:57,029 --> 00:51:59,115
- Monsieur.
- Thank you.

379
00:51:59,907 --> 00:52:03,119
I understand you're Mr Largo's niece.

380
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:07,707
It sounds better than... What would
you say? Mistress? Kept woman?

381
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,501
I wouldn't say that.
Where did you meet him?

382
00:52:10,584 --> 00:52:13,838
In Capri. I was there
with my brother François.

383
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:20,136
Strange.
I found Emilio attractive then.

384
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:24,473
- Does he live aboard the yacht?
- No. He has a house on the island.

385
00:52:24,557 --> 00:52:26,350
- Must we talk about him?
- No.

386
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:30,021
- I'd much rather dance.
- So would I.

387
00:52:36,485 --> 00:52:39,113
- Where is your brother now?
- In England.

388
00:52:39,196 --> 00:52:44,326
He's a commandant with NATO.
He's a wonderful person.

389
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,288
The trouble is,
I never meet anyone like him.

390
00:52:47,371 --> 00:52:49,874
Only men like Largo and myself.

391
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:53,085
- You are not like Largo.
- Really?

392
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:56,714
Why do you say that?

393
00:52:58,382 --> 00:53:01,135
The way you hold me.

394
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:06,640
There.

395
00:53:12,396 --> 00:53:17,485
- How long are you staying in Nassau?
- We are going the day after tomorrow.

396
00:53:17,568 --> 00:53:20,780
As I said, we haven't got very much time.

397
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:23,157
Emilio wants to leave.

398
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,206
Are you sleeping aboard tonight?

399
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:33,042
I hoped you'd not be so obvious.

400
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:35,711
When one has little time,
one has to be obvious.

401
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,547
- You know where you can find me.
- Mr Bond.

402
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:41,175
Your niece is an excellent dancer.

403
00:53:41,258 --> 00:53:44,637
Let me prove I'm as good a loser
as you are a winner.

404
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,807
Come to lunch on Sunday
at Palmyra, my house here.

405
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:51,352
- Sunday at noon, then.
- My dear.

406
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:53,604
- Good night.
- Good night.

407
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,982
You must tell me what
Mr Bond had to say, word for word.

408
00:53:57,066 --> 00:54:00,820
- He talked about you, a little.
- What was he saying just then?

409
00:54:00,903 --> 00:54:05,491
- He asked if we'd sleep aboard tonight.
- Interesting.

410
00:54:21,298 --> 00:54:25,052
- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.

411
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:29,682
- I'm sorry, no mail.
- Thank you.

412
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,962
Paula?

413
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:04,527
Paula?

414
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,099
Well, hello, 00...

415
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,961
That's a fine way to treat the CIA.

416
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:07,590
Sorry about that, Felix,
but you were just about to say 007.

417
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:09,759
Here.

418
00:57:11,135 --> 00:57:14,513
- Have you killed him?
- You know me better than that.

419
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,099
There you go, smiler.

420
00:57:18,142 --> 00:57:22,646
Have you seen everything you came to
see? Go back to your friends and report.

421
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,858
Tell them: The little fish
I throw back into the sea.

422
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:29,570
- Give it to him.
- You're going to shoot me in the back?

423
00:57:29,653 --> 00:57:31,906
The gun, I mean.

424
00:57:35,242 --> 00:57:37,078
Now move.

425
00:57:37,161 --> 00:57:41,832
- Who was he?
- A small fish, working for a Mr Largo.

426
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,919
He's got a yacht
we should take a look at, later.

427
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,885
- Quist, to see Mr Largo.
- Open up.

428
00:58:05,022 --> 00:58:06,941
Yes?

429
00:58:07,024 --> 00:58:08,442
It's Quist.

430
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,239
Gently, my friend. Gently.

431
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:16,325
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

432
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,120
- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.

433
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:21,706
What happened?

434
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:28,546
You let him get the better of you.

435
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,467
No. He was a beast.

436
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,261
No. No.

437
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:37,054
No.

438
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,473
No.

439
00:58:55,072 --> 00:58:58,492
- Hey there. Did you finally make contact?
- You're late.

440
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,412
- Felix Leiter, Pinder, our man here.
- How do you do?

441
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:03,581
This way, gentlemen.

442
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:06,792
- Who's the girl?
- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.

443
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:19,722
Here is a special announcement
from the Overseas Service of the BBC.

444
00:59:19,805 --> 00:59:24,435
Big Ben struck seven times
at six o'clock this evening

445
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:30,691
due to a mechanical failure which last
occurred during a violent storm in 1898.

446
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,194
Once again, the headlines...

447
00:59:33,277 --> 00:59:36,530
Obviously stalling for time.

448
00:59:38,532 --> 00:59:40,868
- Oh, no.
- 007.

449
00:59:40,951 --> 00:59:43,704
- What a wonderful surprise.
- For me, too.

450
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:48,542
I find thus business of equipping you
in the field, on the run, as it were,

451
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,253
highly irregular.

452
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:55,883
Here we have a Geiger counter.
Useful and unobtrusive.

453
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,511
The sweep hand counts radioactivity.

454
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:02,223
- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.

455
01:00:02,306 --> 01:00:05,935
Now here's something
I want you to use with special care.

456
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,438
With special care.

457
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,566
- Everything you give me...
- Is treated with contempt.

458
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:18,864
But that's an underwater camera.
It takes eight pictures in rapid succession.

459
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:24,036
- Is that clever?
- If it can take pictures in the dark, yes.

460
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,751
Try to be a little less
than your usual frivolous self.

461
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:36,841
Here's a miniature Very pistol,
which fires a red flare, a distress signal.

462
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:41,595
- You should keep it on you day and night.
- I resent that remark.

463
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,056
Here.

464
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,892
Look, do you mind?

465
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,646
In the event of a rebreather
not being available, use this device.

466
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,567
For short periods only, of course.
Say, about four minutes.

467
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,862
- Clever.
- Obviously, you'd use it as a last resort.

468
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:03,826
- It closes to a convenient pocket size.
- Assuming one has a convenient pocket.

469
01:01:04,618 --> 01:01:08,914
Now pay attention. A recently
developed harmless radioactive device.

470
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,374
Harmless?

471
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:16,047
It sends out a homing signal
to a special receiver.

472
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:20,926
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Obviously, you swallow it.

473
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:23,512
Now?

474
01:01:27,224 --> 01:01:30,227
Let's hope she'll be lying
in the same place tonight.

475
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:34,315
We'll use this catamaran
as a rendezvous place for later.

476
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:37,902
- Good idea.
- Take her in.

477
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:44,325
A container will be dropped off the
coast of Burma in the Mergui Archipelago,

478
01:01:44,408 --> 01:01:49,789
latitude 20 degrees north,
longitude 60 degrees east,

479
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:54,752
at 2000 hours Greenwich Mean Time
on May 27th.

480
01:01:54,835 --> 01:02:00,674
It will hold blue-white flawless diamonds
between three and eight carats.

481
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:06,555
Total value to be not less than
Ł100 million, present market price.

482
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,976
After we have recovered the container
and verified its contents,

483
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:15,981
you will be notified
on radio frequency 16.23 megacycles

484
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,651
where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.

485
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,864
- Kenniston, get on to De Beers at once.
- Yes, sir.

486
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:29,995
Gentlemen, unless the bombs are found,
I'm afraid we'll have to pay their price.

487
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,289
Sir.

488
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:37,420
Yes. Signal from 007 in Nassau.
One or two things that might interest us.

489
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:43,259
The <i>Disco Volante</i> is still in the harbour.
The catamaran too, so we have our cover.

490
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,429
Fine. Drop me in the water behind her.

491
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:51,392
- Any further news from London?
- Zero hour is still 2000 hours on the 27th.

492
01:02:51,475 --> 01:02:55,771
- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?

493
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,153
- OK. This'll do here.
- We'll meet back at Pinder's.

494
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,321
Good luck.

495
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,627
Turn the underwater lights on.

496
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:09,470
TV closed circuit.

497
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,827
Hand grenades.

498
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,455
Ready.

499
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,715
Down there.

500
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,148
There.

501
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,780
Quick. Launch.

502
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:44,815
There's something there.

503
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:54,700
That's him. Turn around.

504
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:04,835
Hold that.

505
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:11,050
- We must have hit him with the propeller.
- Let's get back and tell Largo.

506
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:51,132
- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.

507
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:54,927
- Thank you. You just about saved my life.
- Really?

508
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:59,348
My outboard capsized
so I had to swim ashore.

509
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,143
How far do you go?

510
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:07,314
You'd better fasten your safety belt.

511
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:12,319
- What's your name?
- James Bond.

512
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,656
Fiona Volpe.

513
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:36,260
- Do you fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?

514
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:41,265
No. It's just that I have no desire
to be capsized twice in one night.

515
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,851
At least you won't have to swim ashore.

516
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,650
Have you been here before, Mr Bond?

517
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:56,197
No, I haven't.
But this is the road to Nassau?

518
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,075
Yes, eventually.

519
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:26,060
- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Yes, me too. This is my hotel.

520
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,271
- What a coincidence.
- Yes. So convenient.

521
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:34,443
I hope I didn't frighten you.

522
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:38,280
- I'm a nervous passenger.
- Some men just don't like to be driven.

523
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:42,618
No, some men just don't like
to be taken for a ride.

524
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:55,715
Look at this.
An underwater hatch.

525
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:58,718
That's how they could leave and get back.

526
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,972
So nobody saw them. The whole
operation was carried out underwater.

527
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:05,975
That's where
we'll have to look for the plane.

528
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:08,769
I'll bring the prints to the hotel.

529
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:19,030
The air force searched the area
250 miles out of Nassau.

530
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,490
It must be beyond that radius.

531
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,118
If the <i>Disco Volante</i> was out that night.

532
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:29,206
Sure she was, but Harbour Control
said only for six hours.

533
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:33,794
She couldn't cover 500 miles
in that time, no.

534
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:38,883
About 90 miles is her limit for six hours,
and that's out and back.

535
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,514
We'll have to go further out.
We'll need more gas for that.

536
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,768
Let's get back to Nassau.
We haven't got much time.

537
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,437
You're right, James, we haven't.

538
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,749
Pull.

539
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:17,088
Of course they are watching us, my dear.
What else have they to do?

540
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:23,135
- You would like Bond dead.
- I can think of no better arrangement.

541
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,305
Because he tries
to make love to your woman?

542
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:30,351
Because he is Bond and, as an enemy
of SPECTRE, should be killed.

543
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:31,936
Mark.

544
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,981
If Bond had died last night
as a result of your hastiness,

545
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:40,069
his government would have known
for certain the bombs are here.

546
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:43,280
When the time is right,
he will be killed. Pull.

547
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,244
I shall kill him.

548
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:55,835
A separate pool.
For sharks, no less. Move in.

549
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,089
Hold on that line.

550
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:05,678
That's Largo's place, all right.
My next port of call.

551
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,783
- Mr Largo?
- Yes, sir.

552
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,368
Thank you.

553
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:50,514
- Can I help?
- Why, Mr Bond. Of course you can.

554
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:54,477
- That looks particularly inviting.
- Mr Bond.

555
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,896
- Welcome to Palmyra.
- It's a pleasure.

556
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,191
- I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- What do you mean?

557
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:03,319
I thought perhaps you'd another visitor.

558
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,696
No.

559
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:09,116
That gun.
Looks more fitting for a woman.

560
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:14,497
- Do you know much about guns?
- No. I know a little about women.

561
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:17,500
Mr Janni, Mr Vargas.

562
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,795
- Mr Vargas, Mr Janni.
- Which is which?

563
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:25,925
I thought you might have met
Mr Vargas the other night.

564
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,011
- Yes, I believe I did.
- Drinks, sir.

565
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:34,517
- Rum Collins, Mr Bond?
- Yes. Just about that hour, isn't it?

566
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,769
For you?

567
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:40,398
Of course.
Vargas does not drink. Does not smoke.

568
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,068
Does not make love.

569
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,862
What do you do, Vargas?

570
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:51,450
Every man has his passion.
Mine is fishing.

571
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:54,787
What is yours, Mr Bond?

572
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:58,833
Well, I'm not what you'd call
a passionate man.

573
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:07,425
I think it's time I went to change.

574
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,803
You must let me show you around.

575
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:15,349
- I'd love that.
- I thought you might.

576
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:16,934
Pull.

577
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:20,229
- What could be easier?
- Perhaps you'd call one for me.

578
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:23,691
- Of course. Pull.
- Seems terribly difficult.

579
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,031
- No, it isn't, is it?
- No.

580
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:38,664
I collect big game fish
for various marine institutions.

581
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:43,002
- Magnificent creatures.
- Charming.

582
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:47,923
The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.
The most savage, the most dangerous.

583
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:51,969
They know when it's time
for them to be fed.

584
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:55,473
- That boat, is she yours?
- Yes. I'm very proud of her.

585
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,683
What does she do?
About 15 knots?

586
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,978
Better than that. Near 20.

587
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:04,690
- Perhaps you'd like to see over her.
- Yes, I would, very much.

588
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,777
- Emilio, lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.

589
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,738
Come, Mr Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.

590
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:14,575
Domino, I was just thinking.
As I'll be busy this evening,

591
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:18,329
perhaps Mr Bond will be kind enough
to take you to the Junkanoo.

592
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:21,916
It's our local Mardi Gras.
You'll be my guest tonight.

593
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,627
- That's very kind of you.
- My pleasure.

594
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:34,387
- Hello.
- Hello.

595
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,390
Our Mr Bond must have
a very high opinion of himself.

596
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,767
- Opinion?
- Yes.

597
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,977
He has a date with me, too.

598
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,775
Excuse me.

599
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,001
- Let me go. Let me go. No.
- Over here.

600
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,920
No.

601
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:12,299
Don't let her make so much noise.
Use the chloroform.

602
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:47,793
Largo did promise he'd come, didn't he?

603
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,796
He'll be here, don't worry.

604
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,341
James, I think that man's waving at you.

605
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:56,302
James. Come down here.

606
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,721
Quick.

607
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:02,433
Excuse me for a second.

608
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:05,436
James, Paula's gone.

609
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:09,315
- What do you mean?
- She just checked out of the hotel.

610
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,567
You look after Domino.

611
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:16,322
- You think she was on to something?
- I've got to find out. Watch out for her.

612
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,824
All right. Thank you.

613
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:24,121
You'll have your power cut,
as requested, all over the island.

614
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:28,959
- I just want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.

615
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:02,493
- What do you mean, she won't talk?
- Don't worry. She will.

616
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,829
What's wrong?

617
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,128
- Dimitri. Is it a power failure?
- Yes. All over the island.

618
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:16,090
- Switch over to the emergency generator.
- Yes, sir.

619
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,545
Largo told you to be careful.

620
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:58,132
I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.

621
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:01,260
A capsule in the mouth. Cyanide?

622
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,556
She's dead.

623
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:24,200
- What's happened?
- Ricardo. Someone's got him.

624
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:35,419
Search that way.
And you, the shark pool.

625
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:43,427
What happened?
Leave him. This way.

626
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,394
Stop it.

627
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:55,106
You fools.
He's got you all shooting at each other.

628
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,900
It started down there.

629
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,243
Over here.

630
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,570
No, no. I've got a better idea.

631
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:04,592
- Lift the tunnel hatch and let them eat.
- Yes, sir.

632
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,500
Sorry, old chap.
Better luck next time.

633
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,969
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.
I'll get back to him soon.

634
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:32,555
- Anything else?
- Tell him Paula's dead.

635
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:13,804
Hello.

636
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:18,309
- Aren't you in the wrong room, Mr Bond?
- Not from where I'm standing.

637
01:22:20,478 --> 01:22:24,565
Since you are here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?

638
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:44,293
- I'm very glad to see you again, Mr Bond.
- I'm glad to see you again.

639
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:50,466
- I had a feeling you've been avoiding me.
- Well, I had no idea we were neighbours.

640
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:55,388
They moved me down this afternoon.
It's extraordinary. Almost as if...

641
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,932
As if it was intended.

642
01:22:58,015 --> 01:23:00,976
Yes, it is extraordinary.

643
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:07,316
Shouldn't you get out of those wet
clothes? You'll catch your death of cold.

644
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:16,742
Now look.
You know we're going to be too late.

645
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:19,704
- Too late for what?
- The Junkanoo.

646
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:25,876
I promised my friends I'd meet them there.
Perhaps you know them. The Largos.

647
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,213
Questions, questions.
All I get is questions.

648
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:31,757
But the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow.

649
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:34,051
- Enough to drive you wild.
- Really?

650
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:38,055
Do you like wild things,
Mr Bond, James Bond?

651
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:42,518
Wild? You should be locked up in a cage.

652
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:52,695
This bed feels like a cage.
All these bars.

653
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,157
Do you think I'll be safe?

654
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:12,340
You made a shocking mess
out of my hair, you sadistic brute.

655
01:24:12,423 --> 01:24:14,508
Will you zip me up, please?

656
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:20,014
No wonder you can
get dressed so quickly.

657
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:24,602
On the way we can have a little talk.
You may find it interesting.

658
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:27,188
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

659
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:30,399
I hate to think I'm gonna miss anything.

660
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:37,865
- Now we can have an interesting talk.
- Friends of yours, no doubt.

661
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:40,034
Come in.

662
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:46,082
You dress quickly too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.

663
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:51,379
Not that it matters,
but that was under the pillow all the time.

664
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:58,344
- And when did you find out?
- You're wearing the same ring as Largo.

665
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:01,597
- It's a ring I like to wear.
- Vanity has its dangers.

666
01:25:01,681 --> 01:25:06,602
Vanity, Mr Bond, is something
you know so much about.

667
01:25:06,686 --> 01:25:10,856
Don't flatter yourself. What I did
this evening was for king and country.

668
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:14,235
You don't think it gave me
any pleasure, do you?

669
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:22,326
But of course.
I forgot your ego, Mr Bond.

670
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:28,040
James Bond, who makes love to a woman
and she hears heavenly choirs singing.

671
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:32,920
She repents and returns
to the side of right and virtue.

672
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:37,008
But not this one.

673
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:42,638
What a blow it must have been,
you having a failure.

674
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:45,766
Well, you can't win them all.

675
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:49,812
We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.

676
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:52,189
Careful, Mr Bond. Careful.

677
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:09,915
Now look.

678
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:17,089
Get through to Palmyra. Tell them
we've been held up by the Junkanoo.

679
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:20,551
- Like a drink, man?
- Get him away. Don't try anything.

680
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:22,762
- Get out of here.
- It's real firewater.

681
01:26:22,845 --> 01:26:27,099
- Get out of it. Get out of here.
- Have a sip. It can't harm you.

682
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,232
Go after him.

683
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:54,210
- You haven't seen anything?
- No.

684
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:55,961
Look.

685
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:59,298
Follow it.
You, that side. You, there.

686
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:04,780
Stay with us now.

687
01:30:01,731 --> 01:30:04,150
- Thank you. I'd love to.
- Love to what?

688
01:30:07,987 --> 01:30:10,322
You're mad.
Do you know that?

689
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:12,908
Yes. Isn't everyone?

690
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:19,665
- May I cut in?
- You should've said your wife was here.

691
01:30:31,177 --> 01:30:36,807
- Do you come here often?
- It's no good trying to escape, Mr Bond.

692
01:30:36,891 --> 01:30:38,976
I don't want to escape.

693
01:30:39,977 --> 01:30:44,857
Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.

694
01:30:54,909 --> 01:30:58,371
Why don't you come with us quietly?

695
01:30:58,454 --> 01:31:02,083
You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.

696
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:45,418
Mind if my friend sits this one out?
She's just dead.

697
01:31:55,761 --> 01:32:00,599
You'll leave here at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.

698
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:04,520
You will then go to the Mergui
Archipelago to make your drop,

699
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:08,315
precisely at 20 degrees north,
60 degrees east.

700
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:11,277
The diamonds will be in a container...

701
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:16,240
I hate to give in on this. Paying them
blood money. Letting them beat us.

702
01:32:16,323 --> 01:32:19,577
- Have you an alternative?
- I'm afraid I haven't.

703
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:23,581
- I thought 007 was on to something.
- I thought so too, sir.

704
01:32:23,664 --> 01:32:25,750
- False alarm?
- Afraid so.

705
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:29,337
He has a highly developed sense of...
shall we say drama?

706
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:34,592
- If 007 thought he was on to something...
- Pity he didn't make sure first.

707
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:37,428
We have exactly 14 hours and 50 minutes.

708
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:41,807
Then we shall have to pay up
and look as happy as we can, shan't we?

709
01:33:19,428 --> 01:33:21,931
We've looked about everywhere.

710
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:25,059
We've got to find that plane.

711
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:31,315
You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.

712
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:33,275
Golden Grotto?

713
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:36,487
Yeah. All you'll find down there is sharks.

714
01:33:37,613 --> 01:33:40,449
- Take it down. I want a closer look.
- At what?

715
01:33:40,533 --> 01:33:42,243
Quick.

716
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:51,711
I think we've found it.

717
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:07,727
There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.

718
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:11,105
Shoot a shark.
It'll keep the others occupied.

719
01:34:21,115 --> 01:34:25,161
I don't know how long the others
will take, but they'll be back.

720
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:28,205
- I'll keep an eye on them.
- Good.

721
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:35,916
Take these.

722
01:36:39,545 --> 01:36:41,881
- She's down there.
- Are the bombs on board?

723
01:36:41,964 --> 01:36:42,715
No.

724
01:36:42,798 --> 01:36:46,886
- Great. What's our next move?
- We'll check on the <i>Disco Volante</i>.

725
01:36:46,969 --> 01:36:49,388
If the bombs aren't on board now,
they soon will be.

726
01:36:49,472 --> 01:36:52,141
Who are you going to ask? Largo?

727
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:55,353
No, I don't think we'll have to.

728
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:52,159
I hope we didn't frighten the fish.

729
01:37:55,788 --> 01:37:58,207
Sea egg spines.
They're poisonous.

730
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:00,960
Here. Give me your arm.

731
01:38:03,713 --> 01:38:06,340
Sit down.

732
01:38:06,424 --> 01:38:08,551
Now turn over.

733
01:38:10,845 --> 01:38:13,556
This is going to hurt a bit.

734
01:38:21,814 --> 01:38:24,483
It's the first time I've tasted women.

735
01:38:24,567 --> 01:38:30,281
You're the only man to ever make me cry.
Except François, my brother.

736
01:38:30,364 --> 01:38:33,284
Domino, I have to tell you something.

737
01:38:35,411 --> 01:38:39,332
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you,
speaking of love.

738
01:38:39,415 --> 01:38:42,835
- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away.

739
01:38:42,918 --> 01:38:46,922
- "Sorry, my dear. It's all over."
- No, it's about your brother.

740
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,134
What about him?

741
01:39:02,355 --> 01:39:04,023
François...

742
01:39:09,195 --> 01:39:11,280
He's...

743
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:18,954
He's dead?

744
01:39:21,499 --> 01:39:24,835
- What happened?
- It's a long story.

745
01:39:24,919 --> 01:39:27,880
And it involves your friend, Largo.

746
01:39:39,433 --> 01:39:41,560
Domino, I need your help.

747
01:39:41,644 --> 01:39:45,731
Of course.
That's why you made love to me.

748
01:39:45,815 --> 01:39:49,860
I can't explain what this is all about,
but you must trust me.

749
01:39:49,944 --> 01:39:54,532
- Because you want me to help you?
- Look, Largo had your brother murdered.

750
01:39:54,615 --> 01:39:59,829
Hundreds of thousands of people
will die soon if you don't help me.

751
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:07,753
That much we do know.
But there's something we don't.

752
01:40:07,837 --> 01:40:11,132
The bombs - when they'll be loaded
aboard the <i>Disco Volante</i>.

753
01:40:11,215 --> 01:40:15,386
- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.

754
01:40:16,429 --> 01:40:19,306
It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.

755
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:22,351
What can he do to me
he hasn't already done?

756
01:40:22,435 --> 01:40:24,311
You'll do it?

757
01:40:26,397 --> 01:40:28,941
- Yes.
- Good.

758
01:40:29,025 --> 01:40:34,488
This is a Geiger counter. Press this.
If it starts clicking, the bombs are aboard.

759
01:40:34,572 --> 01:40:37,950
- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.

760
01:40:38,034 --> 01:40:41,579
As the <i>Disco Volante</i> is being watched,
you'll be spotted.

761
01:40:41,662 --> 01:40:43,998
Vargas is behind you.

762
01:40:45,041 --> 01:40:46,792
Really?

763
01:40:49,086 --> 01:40:51,213
He must have followed us.

764
01:40:55,843 --> 01:41:00,222
- I think he got the point.
- It should have been Largo.

765
01:41:00,306 --> 01:41:01,849
Largo...

766
01:41:01,932 --> 01:41:04,643
- When did he expect you back?
- Very soon.

767
01:41:04,727 --> 01:41:08,564
He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.

768
01:41:08,647 --> 01:41:13,069
- You go back. I'll take care of Vargas.
- James...

769
01:41:13,152 --> 01:41:15,654
I'm doing this for my brother.
For what he did to him.

770
01:41:15,738 --> 01:41:19,158
Promise you will kill Largo for me,
whatever happens.

771
01:41:23,996 --> 01:41:26,165
- You haven't much time.
- All right.

772
01:41:26,248 --> 01:41:30,044
- It may not be important.
- Everything is.

773
01:41:30,127 --> 01:41:34,632
There's a small bridge over the canal.
Largo never allows strangers near it.

774
01:41:34,715 --> 01:41:38,135
- By it is a flight of steps.
- Where do they lead to?

775
01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:41,222
Down into the sea,
on the far side of Palmyra.

776
01:41:41,305 --> 01:41:43,933
Perhaps it is important, after all.

777
01:43:14,774 --> 01:43:17,693
Put on your equipment.

778
01:43:33,959 --> 01:43:37,588
- Did the girl go on board the <i>Disco</i>?
- Yes, sir. Signal received at...

779
01:43:37,672 --> 01:43:41,425
- OK. If she is on board, where's 007?
- That's a question.

780
01:43:44,178 --> 01:43:46,472
Stand by. Five seconds.

781
01:43:47,223 --> 01:43:49,475
Watch my signal.

782
01:44:33,978 --> 01:44:36,897
Prepare to get under way.

783
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:42,778
Captain, weigh anchor.

784
01:44:42,862 --> 01:44:44,947
Get under way immediately.

785
01:44:45,031 --> 01:44:50,036
Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.

786
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,628
The <i>Disco</i>'s leaving.

787
01:49:08,878 --> 01:49:11,964
- I told you to stay in your cabin.
- I want a breath of air.

788
01:49:12,048 --> 01:49:14,550
My dear, did you not hear me?

789
01:49:14,633 --> 01:49:17,928
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.

790
01:49:24,727 --> 01:49:28,647
Mr Bond gave you this little toy, I imagine.

791
01:49:28,731 --> 01:49:31,442
And Vargas is dead.

792
01:49:33,861 --> 01:49:36,864
No, my dear, there is no escape for you.

793
01:49:36,947 --> 01:49:41,577
Like your friend, you've been a little
too clever, and now you are caught.

794
01:50:29,166 --> 01:50:32,962
You've given me much pleasure, Domino.

795
01:50:33,045 --> 01:50:37,049
But in return, unless you tell me
how much Bond knows,

796
01:50:37,133 --> 01:50:40,302
I'll be forced to cause you great pain.

797
01:50:40,386 --> 01:50:44,306
This for heat, these for cold.

798
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:48,185
Applied scientifically and slowly.

799
01:50:48,269 --> 01:50:51,397
Very, very slowly.

800
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:04,744
- What do you want?
- We're activating the bombs.

801
01:51:04,827 --> 01:51:06,912
- You said to tell you.
- Yes.

802
01:51:09,248 --> 01:51:13,461
A private little matter, my friend,
between the young woman and myself.

803
01:51:13,544 --> 01:51:15,171
Go.

804
01:51:15,254 --> 01:51:19,633
Do not live in hope, my dear.
There is no one to rescue you.

805
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:36,484
Now go on.

806
01:51:36,567 --> 01:51:41,989
It's a good thing the homing capsule he
swallowed is still working. Straight ahead.

807
01:51:47,328 --> 01:51:49,622
Go right. Go on right.

808
01:52:10,726 --> 01:52:12,812
That's him.

809
01:52:28,077 --> 01:52:29,829
Hold it.

810
01:52:40,339 --> 01:52:41,257
Up.

811
01:52:55,396 --> 01:52:58,607
Get your radio man on to Orlando Beach.

812
01:52:58,691 --> 01:53:01,193
Warn them the target is Miami.

813
01:53:01,277 --> 01:53:06,365
The bomb is transferred from the <i>Disco</i>
<i>Volante</i> onto a wreck off Fowley Point.

814
01:53:06,449 --> 01:53:08,909
Right. Hang on to that.

815
01:55:57,745 --> 01:56:01,582
- And the kitchen sink.
- On you, everything looks good.

816
01:56:02,458 --> 01:56:04,543
Take this.

817
01:56:09,548 --> 01:56:11,467
Good luck.

818
02:03:15,933 --> 02:03:18,352
- Weigh anchor.
- Aye aye, sir.

819
02:03:46,297 --> 02:03:49,133
- Make smoke.
- Making smoke now.

820
02:03:56,724 --> 02:03:59,894
- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.

821
02:04:03,606 --> 02:04:05,775
Jettison cocoon.

822
02:04:12,865 --> 02:04:14,950
Cocoon's away.

823
02:04:27,463 --> 02:04:30,633
Keep firing. They're closing.

824
02:04:49,610 --> 02:04:53,572
Come on. Fire.
More. Over there.

825
02:05:05,543 --> 02:05:07,878
Away from there.

826
02:05:07,962 --> 02:05:10,715
We've still got one bomb aboard.

827
02:05:11,173 --> 02:05:15,594
He's gone mad.
Please talk to them for me.

828
02:05:15,678 --> 02:05:19,015
Tell them I only did what I had to do.
What I was told to do.

829
02:05:31,861 --> 02:05:35,448
- Where is he?
- The bomb cannot be exploded now.

830
02:05:35,531 --> 02:05:37,616
I threw the arming device into the sea.

831
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:39,869
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

832
02:05:49,211 --> 02:05:51,005
Get him.

833
02:07:34,734 --> 02:07:38,612
- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad.

834
02:07:38,696 --> 02:07:42,116
- Who's he?
- I don't know but he helped me.

835
02:07:42,199 --> 02:07:45,745
- Look out. The rocks.
- The reef.

836
02:07:47,621 --> 02:07:49,915
He's jammed the controls. Come on.

837
02:07:49,999 --> 02:07:50,750
Jump.

838
02:07:50,833 --> 02:07:53,252
- I can't swim.
- Never too late to learn.

839
02:07:57,214 --> 02:07:59,425
Get down.

840
02:10:04,842 --> 02:10:07,970
