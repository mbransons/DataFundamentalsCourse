1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:23,785
Left, hut.

3
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,697
Left, march.

4
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:05,932
Left, hut. March.

5
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:15,133
One. Come on, number 47.

6
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:16,405
Detail, halt.

7
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,777
One, two, three, four. One...

8
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:19,974
Eyes left, boys.

9
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,949
One, two, three, four.

10
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,513
Left.

11
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:38,061
Detail, halt.

12
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,559
One, two, three, four...

13
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,529
Right, face.

14
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,103
Recruit detail to be sworn in, sir.

15
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,276
Major Donovan.
Recruit detail to be sworn in, sir.

16
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:02,023
You are about to take the oath
of allegiance to your country

17
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,423
and to a regiment
that in hard battle on many fields

18
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,725
has earned the nickname,
"The Fighting 69th."

19
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:11,726
No man has ever let the regiment down.
Don't forget that.

20
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:15,999
Now raise your right hands and uncover.
And repeat after me.

21
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:20,135
Take your hat off!

22
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,573
- I...
- I...

23
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,313
Say your names.

24
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:34,381
...do solemnly swear...
...do solemnly swear...

25
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:38,086
...to bear true faith and allegiance...
...to bear true faith and allegiance...

26
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:42,291
...to the United States of America.
...to the United States of America.

27
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,390
That I will serve them
honestly and faithfully...

28
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,799
That I will serve them
honestly and faithfully...

29
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,962
...against all their enemies whomsoever.

30
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,098
...against all their enemies whomsoever.

31
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:55,576
- That I'll obey the orders...
- That I will obey the orders...

32
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,670
...of the President of the United States...

33
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:59,942
...of the President of the United States...

34
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:01,677
...and of the officers appointed over me...

35
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,049
...and of the officers appointed over me...

36
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,384
...according to the rules
and articles of war.

37
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:08,890
...according to the rules
and articles of war.

38
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,984
- So help me, God.
- So help me, God.

39
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:13,992
All right, Corporal.

40
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:17,230
Right face.

41
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,698
Forward hut.

42
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:27,298
One, two, three, four.

43
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:28,435
Column right.

44
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,138
Can you read that?

45
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,316
I say, can you read that?

46
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:37,751
Only the letters.
I don't know what it means.

47
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,788
Go on, read the letters.

48
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:44,191
"B" is for Brooklyn, "Y" is for Yonkers,
"Q" for Queens, "H" for Harlem

49
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,785
and "X" marks the Bronx.

50
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:47,955
Come on. Get moving.

51
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,556
- Open that shirt. Over there.
- Thanks.

52
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,198
That's a funny crack, ain't it?

53
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:54,895
Breathe deeply.

54
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,236
Hey, you, I been all through this before
over in the Armory. What's the big idea?

55
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:01,037
- Oh, really? What's your name?
- Plunkett. What's yours?

56
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,476
Put Private Plunkett on report.
"Addressing medical officer as

57
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:05,673
"Hey, you." Insubordination.
"What's the big idea?"

58
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:08,216
- Yes, Major.
- Major?

59
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,082
You're in the army now.
Stand up. Breathe.

60
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:14,956
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,254
Roll your sleeves up, way up!

62
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,652
Ouch!

63
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,924
Fine bunch of soldiers,
can't even take a little pin prick.

64
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:24,228
It ain't that.
It's the serum that makes you keel over.

65
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,426
What are you trying to hand me?

66
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:26,866
All right, keep moving, fellows.

67
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,028
Keep still, will you?

68
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:30,038
Just a little bayonet practice, buddy.

69
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,198
What? No backbone?

70
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,434
Get off that table!

71
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:34,339
- Does it hurt much, Doc?
- Not much.

72
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,345
Oh, Mr. Doctor,
please don't hurt me. Please.

73
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,883
Sir, I've already had these here shots.

74
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,350
Fine. You'll be twice as healthy.

75
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:47,449
Oh, I never saw such a mob in all my life.

76
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:50,014
Go ahead, Admiral. Shoot the works.

77
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,222
Thanks.

78
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,033
Four union suits, wool, long.

79
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:02,366
Union suits, wool, long.

80
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:04,201
Two shirts, OD, 16.

81
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:05,968
- Say, I wear only 14.
- They'll shrink.

82
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,942
Britches, OD, 42.

83
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,204
- What do you mean, 42?
- One hat.

84
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:11,303
What's the matter with you?
I can't wear these pants.

85
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:12,540
- They're four sizes too big.
- Next.

86
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:13,604
Hey, wait a minute, you.

87
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,674
Come on, here. Keep moving.
Don't hold up the war.

88
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,218
But these pants are too big.
They'll fall down.

89
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:18,947
That's your problem. Get going.

90
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,852
You big, thick donkey.

91
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:24,017
- What'd you say?
- I said it was nice and cool out.

92
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,357
Come on, you fellows! Get out of it!
Come on!

93
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,796
Rise and shine!

94
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,458
Come on! Get it together!

95
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,145
Roust out of there, dope heads!
Rise and shine.

96
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,841
Come on, Cleopatra, vacate that couch!

97
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,712
So the lady says,
"Can I help it if my son worries?"

98
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,617
Come on, shake a leg. Snap out of it.

99
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:56,146
Well, well, well,
who's this darling little sleepyhead?

100
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:58,687
Beg pardon,
but as a personal favor to Pershing,

101
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:01,229
- would you mind dragging out of here?
- Go on, beat it.

102
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:03,765
Listen, are you gonna come quiet like
or do I gotta...

103
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,994
Oh, it must be a nightmare.
Go away, will you?

104
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,059
- Tell me. Do you know what that tune is?
- Yeah, I know.

105
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:09,729
It's 15 minutes to reveille
and I don't like it.

106
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:13,741
I don't like you, either.
Now, go on, tell the Colonel he wants you.

107
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:19,073
Why, you big, Irish, no-good heel, you...

108
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:25,376
Smart guy.

109
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:27,412
One, two, three, four.

110
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,926
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

111
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,722
One, two, three, four.

112
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,922
What's the matter, Plunkett?
You got two left feet?

113
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:36,828
One, two, three, four.

114
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,298
One, two...

115
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,301
Come on up there, Wynn.

116
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,263
Squads, left about! Hey!

117
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,006
Close up there.

118
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:52,847
Squads right, hut.

119
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,173
Oh, that's beautiful.

120
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:58,578
A lot of baboons on roller skates
couldn't do better.

121
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:00,349
One, two, three, four.

122
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,158
Bayonet exercise. Guard!

123
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:06,161
That elbow down, Wynn.

124
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,026
Ready. Thrust!

125
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:10,931
Ready. Thrust!

126
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:14,260
Ready. Lunge!

127
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,997
No, no, no, no.

128
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,598
What do you guys think you're doing?
Tickling your grandmas?

129
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:23,111
Them's bayonets, not bodkin needles.
Give me that rifle.

130
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:26,347
When you lunge, lunge.

131
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:27,473
Get him or he'll get you.

132
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,041
Stick him in the throat
or in his chest, or in the belly.

133
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,746
Don't waste your steel, see?

134
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,517
And when you lunge, six inches is enough.

135
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,150
And if your bayonet gets stuck,
don't put your foot on his chest.

136
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:39,694
Pull the trigger and shoot it out.
Now, you got that, lame brain?

137
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,662
Come, on, snap into it.

138
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:44,259
Make believe that dummy's
the guy you hate the most.

139
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,198
Ready. Lunge!

140
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,162
That's for you, Mike. How do you like it?

141
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,741
Inspection. Arms!

142
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:01,107
Order. Arms!

143
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,310
Wake up, Wynn.

144
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,087
As you were.

145
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:08,212
What's your name, lug?

146
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,122
Sure, me name's Mike Murphy,
Sergeant Your Honor.

147
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,353
Well, stand fast
till you get the orders to move.

148
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:13,588
Right.

149
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,594
- Did you say your name was Murphy?
- I did, Your Worship, saving your presence.

150
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,568
- What were you born?
- Sure, I was born a boy.

151
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,969
Pipe down.

152
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:31,841
- What name were you born with?
- Mischa Moskowitz.

153
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,711
- Where'd you get the Murphy?
- I took it.

154
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:37,116
You see, sir, I wanted to go over
with the Fighting 69th.

155
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:38,175
Okay?

156
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,723
Okay, Mike. Oh, look at young Wynn.
With a chest like a sparrow.

157
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,227
- Suck it in! Stick it out!
- Hey, cut it out, will you, Mike?

158
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:49,787
It's Sergeant Wynn to you, and like it.
I'll make a soldier out of you yet.

159
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,594
Now, one more thing.

160
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:54,898
Don't you fellows go wandering
too far away after chow.

161
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,801
I've got good news for you.

162
00:10:56,872 --> 00:11:01,138
Major Donovan's taking the battalion
out on night tactics, with full packs.

163
00:11:02,878 --> 00:11:04,470
Pipe down. Or you'll never get dismissed.

164
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:05,605
I'm sick and...

165
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:10,141
Fasten that collar! Suck in that gut!
Try and look like a soldier! And you, too.

166
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:13,620
You're no privileged character.
Heave those shoulders back!

167
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,524
Dismissed!

168
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:30,001
- What are you so tired about?
- I don't know. Maybe you make me tired.

169
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,096
What's that?

170
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:32,731
I joined this outfit
to go over there and fight,

171
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,833
not to stay around here
doing "squads, east" for six months.

172
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,174
- Is that so?
- Yeah. And another thing.

173
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:39,077
I ain't used to getting up
at 5:30 in the morning

174
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,776
to take 25-mile hike
and get pushed around by you.

175
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,148
And you don't like it, huh?

176
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:45,187
There's a lot of things
in this man's army I don't like.

177
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:46,744
Well, now, that's really tough.

178
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:49,620
But I think I know what you need.
A little diversionment.

179
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:52,126
Now, there's a great big pile of potatoes
that needs peeling.

180
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:54,287
And you're gonna peel them
and keep on peeling them

181
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:57,560
until we leave Camp Mills.
Button up that collar!

182
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,331
Night tactics in this weather.
Well, that fixes us.

183
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:07,740
Give me a cigarette, will you, soldier?

184
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,641
Look, Crepe Hanger,
don't you ever buy any of your own?

185
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:11,680
For what? I'll take that match.

186
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,477
Do you know how many guys
have died of pneumonia

187
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,040
on night tactics in the last 10 years?

188
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,052
What's the use
of going out at night, anyway?

189
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,451
You can't see the enemy in the dark.

190
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,615
Quit your crabbing.
It's all part of the game.

191
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,884
Yeah, some game.

192
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,721
Get shoved around
by that Wild Bill Donovan

193
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,352
and that big, thick mick
of a tough Sergeant.

194
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,727
Hey, listen, you.
Lay off of that "thick mick" stuff.

195
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,356
Listen, flannel-mouth,
I'll say what I please.

196
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:33,231
- And if you don't like it, I'II...
- Hey, Wynn.

197
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:38,239
Keep away from that loud-mouth Plunkett.

198
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:40,707
He's a wrong soldier
and he'll get you into trouble. Savvy?

199
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,903
All right. What are you sore about?

200
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:45,606
I might as well be in the cavalry.
Yes, and a horse at that.

201
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,012
All I get is riding from you.

202
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:48,811
"Snap into it, Wynn. Snap out of it, Wynn."

203
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,010
Keep your shirt on.

204
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:51,211
I can't let the rest of this mob

205
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,619
say I'm playing favorites
with me own kid brother.

206
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,554
- Sergeant.
- Attention!

207
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:56,682
As you were.

208
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,727
What's the big idea keeping
the company in formation

209
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:00,227
after the others were dismissed?

210
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:01,524
Listen, John, just because we're...

211
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:02,996
Lieutenant to you, and don't you forget it.

212
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:04,692
Nobody's gonna accuse me
of playing favorites.

213
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:05,791
And that goes for you, too.

214
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,132
Button up that collar.
What do you think this is, Coxey's Army?

215
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,764
What would Ma say if she could see you
streeling around like this?

216
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,273
Say, you could use a hair cut, too.

217
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:14,104
Did you hear from Ma, sir?

218
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,643
Or would the lieutenant be
so condescending

219
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,306
as to tell us how she's feeling?
Or do I get a court-martial for asking?

220
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,975
She's feeling fine and she wants us to see
that he brushes his teeth.

221
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,780
- I'll tell Corporal Healey.
- Say, now listen...

222
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:24,877
- Pipe down!
- Quiet!

223
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:27,081
Go back into your quarters
and put that blunder-buss away.

224
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:28,589
The hunting season hasn't opened yet.

225
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,887
Hang this up in my tent
while you're about it, too, will you?

226
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,325
You...

227
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:36,292
You know, it's a shame to keep riding him.

228
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,491
How's he doing?

229
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,831
Well, I hate to say it,
but I think he's all 69th.

230
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,745
Left,

231
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:05,482
hut.

232
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:18,897
Left, hut.

233
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,174
- Hello, Jack.
- Father.

234
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,611
- How's Mrs. O'Keefe?
- Expecting again, sir.

235
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,809
Now, I didn't ask her condition.
I asked about her health.

236
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:31,352
- Oh, she's fine, thank you, Father.
- Good.

237
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,883
The division's filling up, Father.
The 4th Alabama's coming in.

238
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:43,495
Well, you'll all be making history
in a few months.

239
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:47,229
Maybe sooner than you think.
We'll need your prayers, Father.

240
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:51,101
When did an Irishman ever need a prayer
in a fight?

241
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:54,433
What are you reading there?

242
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,344
Oh, by the way, did you ever
get up the courage to talk to Kilmer?

243
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,348
I've been intending to.
Do you think he'd mind?

244
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:05,509
- Oh, Joyce.
- Yes, Father?

245
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:07,951
Lieutenant Ames has a favor to ask of you.

246
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:10,787
Yes. Would you autograph this for me?

247
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:13,058
I'd be very pleased to, Lieutenant.

248
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:14,755
- Do you have a pen?
- I have.

249
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,195
Thank you.

250
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:30,176
Thank you.

251
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:31,837
You're quite welcome, sir.

252
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:33,245
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

253
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,180
- Going my way, Corporal?
- Yes, sir.

254
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,480
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, son.

255
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,622
Got a match, buddy?

256
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:49,620
Thanks.

257
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,434
- I don't think I met you yet.
- I been around.

258
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:56,533
Plunkett's my name. Jerry Plunkett.

259
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:59,335
Smiling Jerry they call me on account
of my disposition. What's yours?

260
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,501
Fiery Frank. Duffy for short.

261
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:04,205
Irish, huh? I am, too, but I don't work at it.

262
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,507
I don't like these flannel-mouth micks

263
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:08,516
who go around singing
<i>Molly Malone</i> all the time.

264
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:12,417
I think maybe you're in the wrong outfit.
This regiment has certain traditions.

265
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,547
Oh, don't give me that malarkey.

266
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:17,820
We both joined up for the same thing.
To come back dripping with medals.

267
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,259
Big shots, the world our oyster.

268
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:21,694
- Our what?
- Oysters.

269
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:24,289
You know, you eat them. Oysters.

270
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,932
- How did you leave things in Brooklyn?
- Swell.

271
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,973
- How did you know I was from Brooklyn?
- That was my third guess.

272
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,011
Hey, you ain't so dumb for a soldier.

273
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,808
You steer me right around here, Duffy,
and we'll get places.

274
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,644
Now, just to bind our friendship,

275
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:42,650
a friend of mine gave me
one in the Fifth at Saratoga.

276
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:44,618
You can have it. Look.

277
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,212
Rest!

278
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,256
Hi, buddy.

279
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,665
Tell you what.
Let's and me go AWOL tonight, huh?

280
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,963
I got some swell numbers here.

281
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:01,796
Good-Iooking dames, right here.

282
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,304
Am I glad I transferred out
of them Engineers.

283
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,273
This outfit eats right, don't it, boy?

284
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:09,310
- Hey, soldier. What's your outfit?
- 4th Alabama.

285
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:11,903
- That's down South, ain't it?
- You know it's the truth.

286
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,004
One thing you gotta have

287
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:14,811
if you're gonna soldier proper,
and that's chow.

288
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:17,181
Well, there's nothing to kick about here,
is there?

289
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,276
Hi, dixie.

290
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:20,651
Did you bring any corn pone with you?

291
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,418
- Done better than that, friend.
- Yeah?

292
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:25,085
You all better come over tonight
for a mess of possum pie.

293
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,185
Say, what kind of a trip did you have
coming up here?

294
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,730
Well, when we got up
as far as Pennsylvania

295
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,596
the temperature dropped right down to 99.

296
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,038
- Like to froze to death.
- You don't say so.

297
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:40,701
- Hey, when are we going overseas?
- Don't be in a hurry.

298
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:44,143
They're holding the war back
for you Alabama fellows.

299
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:48,945
- What outfit do you all belong to?
- Why we're the Fighting 69th.

300
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,679
The Fighting 69th? Quite a handle.
Where'd you get it?

301
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:55,417
- Oh, Civil War. What's your outfit?
- 4th Alabama.

302
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,722
Wait a minute. You say your Civil War
fighting got you that name?

303
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:00,921
Sure thing. Ain't you never heard of us?

304
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,863
You wouldn't be
the 69th New York Irishers, would you?

305
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,457
Sure are. So you heard about us, huh?

306
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,133
I'll say we have.

307
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:12,298
Hey, folks, these is the 69th New York.

308
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,774
Want to know if we remember them.

309
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:18,637
Hey, what's so funny?

310
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:21,239
Do we remember you?
Do you remember us?

311
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:24,251
You ought to.
We shot the pants off of your outfit once.

312
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,083
Say that again.
Who shot the pants off of who?

313
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,351
We did. The 4th Alabama.

314
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:32,359
We shot the pants off you,
the 69th New York

315
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:35,089
at Mary's Heights in 1862.

316
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,233
Hey. Look, a fight.

317
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:51,537
- Who's fighting who?
- What do you care? Come on.

318
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:13,764
- Well, it's a good fight all right.
- Yeah. But somebody's gonna get hurt.

319
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:20,105
- The saps.
- Help me break it up, Jerry.

320
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:23,741
Not me, pal. You don't get medals
for that kind of fighting.

321
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,475
Hey, break it up.

322
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,579
Break it up.

323
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,390
Break it up here!

324
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:49,270
Break it up. Break it up.

325
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,397
Terence. Casey. Clanahan.

326
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,271
Come on.

327
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:03,214
Beat it, gang. Donovan!

328
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,387
Come on, break it up.
Break it up, you men.

329
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:10,155
The Major!

330
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:11,516
Get back in your rank.

331
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:13,686
Here comes the Major. The Major.

332
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,790
Get back in your ranks.
Attention. Back, I said.

333
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,660
Just a minute.

334
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:23,299
Who started this ballet russe?

335
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:26,102
Them razorbacks said they shot
the pants off of us in the Civil War.

336
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:27,698
We did.

337
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,937
- He's right. They did.
- What?

338
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,707
At the battle of Fredericksburg.

339
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:38,549
This outfit, the 4th Alabamans,
broke up the charge of the 69th

340
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,282
and stopped us right in our tracks.

341
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:45,486
And you cheered your heads off
because you respected a game enemy.

342
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:48,925
Now, those men on both sides
were Americans.

343
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:51,991
They fought
and then rose above their hatreds

344
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,694
to become one people again.

345
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,737
And that's the way it should be,

346
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:58,432
or do you think the whole nation
is out of step but you?

347
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,873
Our two regiments
are now brigaded together.

348
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:03,036
Their very names are even changed.

349
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:06,877
The 69th New York, to the
165th United States Infantry.

350
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:09,850
The 4th Alabamas to the 167th.

351
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:14,116
Every day, more and more are joining us.
Outfits from all over the country.

352
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,657
Well, they're not coming here
as Easterners, or Southerners

353
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,989
or Alaskans, or New Englanders.

354
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:21,325
Those men are coming here as Americans

355
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:25,457
to form an organization that represents
every part and section of our country,

356
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,694
the Rainbow Division.

357
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:30,169
But there's no room in this Rainbow
for sectional feuds

358
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:33,230
because we're all one nation now,
one team,

359
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:35,399
an all-American team, pulling together

360
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:38,002
and known as the United States Army.

361
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,210
So if you must fight,
wait until you get overseas.

362
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,348
Believe me,
you'll get a belly full of it over there.

363
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,856
Now, go on. Get back to your ranks
and behave yourselves.

364
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:57,790
- Are you hurt, Father?
- Hurt? Now, who'd hurt me?

365
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,356
Oh, it's Father Duffy, is it?

366
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:01,493
And who am I?
Patsy Dumb-Cluck, I suppose.

367
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,128
Me pal, stringing me along.

368
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:04,365
You know they can't get away

369
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,464
from these <i>Dominus Vobiscum</i> salesmen
even in the army.

370
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,101
Well, maybe it's because
the saints have their eyes on you, son.

371
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:11,668
Don't give me that.
I can take care of myself.

372
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,147
Well, maybe you can,
but I thought if you ever did need me...

373
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:15,547
Now look, hard collar, once and for all...

374
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,642
Go on. What do you mean
snapping at Father like that?

375
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,414
Take your hand off of me,
you big, thick mick.

376
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:22,218
Why, I got a good notion to chew you up
and spit you out.

377
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,279
Go on. Beat it.

378
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:24,882
My, but it's a violent man you are.

379
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,451
Come on, Jerry,
let's get the mud off your smiling face.

380
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,326
Come on, break it up.

381
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,765
Button your collar!

382
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,442
Come on. What's holding you men back?

383
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,535
By the time you get into position

384
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,375
the enemy would have
a dozen machine guns on you.

385
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,744
Come on! Double up.

386
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:49,875
I'd like to see you double up
and I don't mean from running either.

387
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,045
Why, when we get to France that
guy's going out on patrols some nights.

388
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,112
I'm gonna hang bells all over him.

389
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,023
All right, all right. Spread out and fall.

390
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,950
Fall, I said!

391
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,795
Burke, get that stern down!

392
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,468
Come on, come on, simulate firing
as soon as you hit the line.

393
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,035
Now, cease firing and follow me.

394
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:18,409
Wouldn't you know it,
as soon as we get comfortable,

395
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,573
we gotta get up and at 'em?

396
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,294
Come on, put some swing in it.
You're not dead yet.

397
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:34,555
No, we're not dead yet.

398
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:37,655
We're just muscle-bound, flat-footed,
fed up and far from home.

399
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:39,290
Outside of that, we're all right.

400
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:41,301
A lot that slave-driver cares
whether we are or not.

401
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:42,631
- Pipe down.
- You want to get in trouble?

402
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:44,968
You ain't no bargain yourself.

403
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,778
Hey, you guys, what are you trying to do,
win the war over here?

404
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,945
How much overtime you get?

405
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,080
You guys are sure gluttons
for punishment.

406
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:04,591
What are you training for, the Olympics?

407
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:07,389
No. We're just
Wild Bill Donovan's chain gang.

408
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:16,336
So this is the insignia
of the Rainbow Division, huh?

409
00:24:16,404 --> 00:24:18,872
- Every color in the spectrum.
- Squads left!

410
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,932
- What's the matter? Don't you like it?
- Oh, indeed I do.

411
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,535
I was just thinking the boys
in the 69th might like it better

412
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,308
if there was a little green in it.

413
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,712
Squads left. March.

414
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:30,649
Bill, don't you think maybe
you're a little hard on the boys?

415
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,519
Night hikes and forced marches.
After all, they're not used to that grind.

416
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:38,923
I'll handle the military end of it.
You look after their souls, Father.

417
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:42,354
- I'm sorry, Bill.
- No. I'm sorry.

418
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:45,723
But war's a brutal business. I know.

419
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:50,697
I've seen what's been going on over there.
That's why I've been so hard on the men.

420
00:24:50,772 --> 00:24:54,333
I've got to be, so they'll be able to face
what's coming later.

421
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,243
These kids of mine are going up against
veterans, schooled in three years of war.

422
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:00,804
They've got to be able to out-endure
and outfight them,

423
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:04,943
not just to be led in half-trained
like sheep led to the slaughter.

424
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,749
Don't you suppose
I've wanted to let up on them?

425
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:09,881
I didn't dare. I've got to think of the future.

426
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,416
- All ready, sir.
- Thank you.

427
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:16,763
And now, the future has come.

428
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:21,234
I couldn't tell you this before,
but this isn't just another night hike.

429
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:22,802
This is it.

430
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:26,536
Give me your blessing, Father.

431
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:35,371
Amen.

432
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,417
Thank you.

433
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:41,212
Column of squads.

434
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,814
First Company, squads right.

435
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:45,154
- Squads right.
- Squads right.

436
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:46,956
- Squads right.
- Hut.

437
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:01,937
Almighty God, in thine infinite mercy,

438
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,978
grant unto me, thy servant,

439
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:07,845
the wisdom to guide my young flock
through the trials of war.

440
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,882
Oh, Father, they're so young.
So young and they know so little of life.

441
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,949
And nothing at all of that terrible and
bloody altar towards which they move,

442
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:21,553
carrying so eagerly
the bright sacrifice of their youth.

443
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,963
Their need will be great, O Lord,
and I am weak.

444
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:31,967
Therefore, I beseech thee
through thy Son, Christ, our Lord,

445
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,438
grant me the strength
to keep them steadfast

446
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,809
in the faith, in decency and courage

447
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,247
to the glory of God,
their country and their regiment,

448
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,742
in the bad times to come.

449
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:50,553
And if in battle you see fit
to gather them to your protecting arms,

450
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,587
thy will be done.

451
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:59,961
But let them die like men,
valiant and unafraid.

452
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:47,177
Come on. Company A fall in.
Come on here.

453
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,773
Come on, fall in here.
Come on, get back in line there.

454
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:53,378
Come on, fall in, men. Snap it up.
Make it lively. Come on here.

455
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:55,389
- Get in line there.
- Come on, you fellows.

456
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:56,890
Throw those cigarettes away. Get in here.

457
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,983
Form this line. Come on.
Snap it up, you mugs.

458
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,893
You move like a lot of sailors.
Come on, put those pipes down.

459
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,430
Right, dress.

460
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:05,424
- One.
- Two.

461
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,489
- Three.
- Four.

462
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:07,557
Count off.

463
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:08,624
- One.
- Two.

464
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:10,170
- Three.
- Four.

465
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:11,227
- One.
- Two.

466
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:12,398
- Three.
- Four.

467
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:13,566
- One.
- Two.

468
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,542
As you were.

469
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,714
What's the matter with you?
You're three, ain't you?

470
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,770
All by myself.

471
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:22,282
Why, you swivel-necked far-down...

472
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,409
Three. Now, let's get on with the war.

473
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:27,182
I came over here to stuff those Dutchmen
back in their sausage skins.

474
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:28,244
And all we do is stand around...

475
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:29,347
The first thing you know,

476
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:30,891
you'll stuff yourself right in the clink.

477
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,824
And, now, Mr. Funny Man,
before it slips my mind,

478
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,987
suppose after retreat you report
to the mess Sergeant

479
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:38,123
and tell him that you'd like to do
a little extra duty as kitchen police.

480
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:41,168
And stuff that in your pipe and puff on it.

481
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,459
Count off!

482
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:44,562
- One.
- Two.

483
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,573
- Three.
- Four.

484
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,903
- One.
- Two.

485
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,002
Now, remember, men,
we're the first American soldiers

486
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,910
to march through the streets of Grand.

487
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,972
I know we're all pretty tired,

488
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:58,712
but let's show the natives
the old 69th has what it takes.

489
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,654
Column squads, first company.

490
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,483
- Squads, left.
- Squads, left!

491
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,685
- Squads, left!
- Squads, left!

492
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,852
Squads, left!

493
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:07,917
March!

494
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,890
Eyes, right.

495
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,423
Front.

496
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,933
Eyes right.

497
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,697
Wonder what we're gonna get to eat
when we get billeted?

498
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:54,674
I heard the Sergeant
just say something about slum.

499
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:58,143
I figure it's about time.
We ain't had any slum since last night.

500
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,738
I got an awful mean feeling, boys,
awful mean.

501
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:02,373
If they don't let us
at those Boches pretty soon,

502
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,213
I'll have to carve me up a top Sergeant.

503
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:06,810
Don't mind him, Sarge.
He's his own worst enemy.

504
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,118
Not while I'm alive, he ain't.

505
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,565
Our present orders
are to march to Luneville,

506
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:19,827
starting the day after Christmas.

507
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,495
It's going to be tough going through
the Vosges foothills and forests

508
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,765
over these icy roads and in this weather.

509
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,704
Think your supply train
can keep up with us, Mangan?

510
00:30:26,774 --> 00:30:29,971
It will, sir, if my men have to carry
the horses and pull the wagons.

511
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:32,740
Father Duffy, how about
your midnight mass tonight?

512
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:34,873
Everything's all set, sir,

513
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:37,577
barring the conversion of a few heathen,

514
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:39,813
present company no exception.

515
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,114
- And facilities for the non-Catholics?
- It's all taken care of, sir.

516
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:44,681
Lieutenant Holmes,
the Methodist chaplain,

517
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,125
is going to arrange services
for the protestant boys.

518
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:50,858
Oh, and of all people, Mike Murphy
is going to build a pulpit for him.

519
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,297
I've wired to GHQ

520
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:55,063
for chaplains for both
the Alabamas and the Illinois.

521
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:58,037
You know, Colonel,
if a lot of the people back home

522
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,234
knew how well the various faiths
got along together over here,

523
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,938
it'd cause a lot of scandal
to some pious minds.

524
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:07,538
Well, gentlemen, I guess that's all.

525
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,849
Oh, boy.

526
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,988
Give me a cigarette, will you, McManus?

527
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:27,534
- Don't you get tired bumming cigarettes?
- No.

528
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:29,502
- Hello, Father. How are you?
- Hello, boys.

529
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:30,663
- Glad to see you.
- How are you?

530
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:32,365
Hey, Father, you're looking pale.

531
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,464
You know, you gotta look after

532
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,530
your health in this funny climate.

533
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:37,271
Yes. It's beginning to get a lot of the boys.

534
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:39,575
- First, your arms go to sleep.
- They do?

535
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,172
And there's a slight buzzing in your ears.

536
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,050
And the most fatal symptom of all,
there's a light feeling in your head.

537
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,553
Father, I got it.

538
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:49,180
And that means you need exercise.

539
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:50,246
And the finest thing in the world

540
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,553
is pumping an organ at midnight mass.

541
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:53,958
It'll make a new man of you.

542
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:55,359
You're gonna pump an organ.

543
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,364
That's one on me, Father.

544
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,491
Paddy, would you like to
sweep out the church?

545
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:02,058
Oh, I wouldn't like to, but I will.

546
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,296
I'll say you will.

547
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:06,135
I think I'll go to your mass tonight.
That is, if it's okay.

548
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:08,539
Oh, sure.
That is, if you're sure you want to.

549
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,703
Well, why not?
You know, you're such a swell guy, Father.

550
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:13,372
- I think I'd go to the devil with you.
- Oh, you would now?

551
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:16,008
- Well, that is, if you asked me to.
- If I asked you...

552
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:17,073
Well, I mean,

553
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:19,881
if there's anything I can do to help,
I'd be glad to do it.

554
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,571
Attention!

555
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:46,009
Hiya, Saint Francis? How's all the monks?

556
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,350
On your feet
when an officer comes in the room.

557
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:02,594
And take that cigarette out of your mouth.

558
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:10,668
All right, boys. As you were.

559
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,729
- Merry Christmas, Father.
- Merry Christmas, Father.

560
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,502
- See you later.
- Yeah. Right, sir.

561
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,564
Okay.

562
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:18,134
Oh, don't forget midnight mass.
And confession's this afternoon.

563
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:19,702
- Okay.
- Okay. We'll be there.

564
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:22,011
If you need any help, Father,
we'll be right outside.

565
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,778
Give us a break and need some help,
will you, Father?

566
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:25,512
It would be a pleasure.

567
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,399
You know, Jerry, you're getting yourself
so well liked in this army

568
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:46,838
they'd rather machine gun you
than the Germans.

569
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:48,205
It was bad enough at Camp Mills.

570
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,005
But instead of improving
you're getting worse.

571
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:53,707
- That's what you think.
- No, that's what everyone thinks.

572
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,750
They're beginning to call you a misfit
and a troublemaker.

573
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:59,685
Well, now that's tough.
I'm gonna bust right out crying.

574
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:02,484
Sit down a minute. I want to talk to you.

575
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:08,356
You know, Jerry,
I don't think you're as tough as you think.

576
00:34:09,163 --> 00:34:10,630
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

577
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:13,727
You're only kidding yourself.

578
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,735
You're your own biggest sucker.

579
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,270
- Oh, yeah?
- Sure.

580
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:19,829
I've seen too much of life and men.

581
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:24,010
You know, son,
there's only one thing wrong with you.

582
00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:26,205
You're Ionesome, that's all.

583
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,473
Me Ionesome? That's rich.

584
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:31,412
Oh, sure, I know.

585
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:35,853
Smart boys don't need anyone.
They can take care of themselves.

586
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:38,619
But there are some
pretty dark days ahead, Jerry,

587
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:42,151
when a man will have need of a friend
he can depend on.

588
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,562
You haven't made any friends.

589
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:47,430
And that's where I thought
I might come in.

590
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:49,631
To help you find him.

591
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,072
We're going into the trenches
right after Christmas.

592
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,042
You're not kidding me, are you?
Well, that's great.

593
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,874
That's what we came over here for.
The sooner the better.

594
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:02,109
And when was the last time
you were to confession?

595
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:05,083
Oh, I knew you'd worm around to that
sooner or later.

596
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:07,553
- There's midnight mass tonight, Jerry.
- Yeah, so I hear.

597
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:11,718
And I don't think Christmas is a bad time
for any of us to take stock and check up.

598
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:15,388
Come on, now. What do you say?
Why don't you join the boys tonight?

599
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,560
Now, look, Chaplain.
Get this once and for all.

600
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,600
I came over here to soldier, not to pray.

601
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:23,364
I don't go for that Holy Joe stuff.
So there's no use trying to convert me.

602
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:25,632
I'm not trying to convert you, son.

603
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,503
I'm asking you
to come back to your religion

604
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:31,306
and recognize the fact of Almighty God.

605
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,205
Well. Merry Christmas, Jerry.

606
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,358
"If a man have a hundred sheep
and one should go astray,

607
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:32,092
"doth he not leave the ninety and nine
in the mountains

608
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,634
"and go seeketh that
which is gone astray?

609
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,243
"And if it so be that he find it,

610
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:44,608
"verily I say unto you,

611
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,941
"he rejoiceth more of that,

612
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,278
"than of the ninety and nine
which went not astray."

613
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,358
Hey, where do we sleep tonight?

614
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:12,235
The same place as last night,
on the side of the road.

615
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:14,001
We ain't been on a road since Tuesday.

616
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:17,772
Ain't you heard, we ain't stopping tonight.
We're going right on.

617
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:19,870
Anyway, we ain't got nothing to stop for.

618
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:22,711
The rolling kitchens is back there
halfway to Brooklyn.

619
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:24,307
Yeah, and am I hungry.

620
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,943
You're hungry?

621
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,320
Never mind that.

622
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,483
Pull over at the side of the road
and get that kitchen through.

623
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,026
Come on, men. Hey!

624
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:35,528
Come on, snap into it.
Get them over the side of the road.

625
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:41,761
Boy, what I could do now
to a big grilled steak

626
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:44,031
with lashings of mashed potatoes
and gravy.

627
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:46,437
- Oh, shut up.
- I'm hungry.

628
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:50,466
I ain't had nothing for three days
except hard tack and a can of dog meat.

629
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:53,570
An army ain't an army unless it eats.

630
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:55,615
It's just a walking famine.

631
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:56,741
And you were the guy who said

632
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:58,808
you could find chow
in the middle of the Sahara.

633
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:01,514
Well, I wouldn't call this the Sahara.

634
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,675
Come on, Mahonies, you're doing all right.

635
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,446
- How are you doing, Ryan?
- Okay, sir.

636
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,647
- Not a big out of order, huh?
- No, sir.

637
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:37,520
- Getting tired, Scully?
- No, sir.

638
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,019
Let me have your pack,
will you, O'Mahoney?

639
00:39:42,096 --> 00:39:44,564
No, sir. No man's carrying my pack.

640
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,396
My name's O'Mahony, not O'Mahoney.

641
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,001
What's so funny?

642
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:55,338
I was just thinking, the Navy rejected me
because I had flat feet.

643
00:39:57,778 --> 00:39:59,678
This walking's awful tough, Father.

644
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:01,442
You should have
joined the cavalry, Terrance.

645
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,107
Not me.

646
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:05,084
When the shooting begins
and I gotta get out of there,

647
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,882
I don't want to be hindered by no horse.

648
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:18,259
Well, look at you.
All dressed up like a tinker's donkey.

649
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:23,166
- I'm doing all right, ain't I?
- Ah, you're just showing off.

650
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:26,206
Yeah, sure. And how I can show them.

651
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,934
Wait till we get up in the lines.

652
00:40:33,214 --> 00:40:34,647
Foot slipped.

653
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,116
Yeah. I know.

654
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:43,221
I can't keep up, Sarge.

655
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,622
These blasted pack-straps
are cutting my shoulders off.

656
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,320
Here. Lean on me.

657
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:51,260
My shoulders. Pack-straps.

658
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,364
My shoulders ache beneath my pack.

659
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:56,767
- Boy, listen to that gunnery.
- We're getting close to the war.

660
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:58,634
Sounds like the Fourth at Coney Island.

661
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,970
"My shoulders ache beneath my pack

662
00:41:01,408 --> 00:41:03,535
"Lie easier, cross, upon his back"

663
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:06,136
I wish I hadn't thrown
my extra shoes away.

664
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,181
The squadron has a corn
of canned willy left.

665
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:10,581
- They can have it.
- It always makes me thirsty.

666
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:13,211
Gosh-darned rifle butt, my fingers is froze.

667
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:15,755
"My rifle hand is stiff and numb"

668
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:18,053
Boy, I hope it doesn't rain again tonight.

669
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,719
"From Thy pierced palms red rivers run"

670
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:22,557
Come on, you sons.
What's the matter with you?

671
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,723
Come on, come on, for the love of Mike!

672
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:26,823
Keep hiking, will you?
Don't die on your feet.

673
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,062
"Men shout at me who may not speak"

674
00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:31,661
Pick 'em up. This ain't no excursion.

675
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,207
"They scourged thy back
and smote thy cheek"

676
00:41:34,275 --> 00:41:36,470
What's that you're muttering?

677
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:40,480
It may turn out to be a prayer
or perhaps only a poem.

678
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:42,204
You know something?

679
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:44,683
A guy with your savvy
should never be no Sergeant.

680
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,312
You should join the candidate's school
and be an officer.

681
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:49,879
No. I'd have to leave the 69th.

682
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,625
This is it, gentlemen.
The old 69th again faces an enemy.

683
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:59,257
Major Donovan, you'll take over
the front line from the chasseurs.

684
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,699
- Yes, sir.
- McKenna, you'll be in support.

685
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,999
Major Moynihan with the third battalion
in reserve.

686
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:05,561
Any questions?

687
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,939
Don't worry, boys.
We'll all get a crack at 'em.

688
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:12,172
Kind of wish I wasn't a CO.
I'd like one good inning myself.

689
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:14,510
Well, I guess that's all.

690
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,807
Good luck, men.

691
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,086
Fall in. First company, right by twos.

692
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:25,352
March!

693
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:36,863
Put them on. Pull.

694
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:45,008
Here we go, boys.
All aboard for the roller coaster.

695
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,739
Do you feel like you're going down
in a fast elevator?

696
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,443
- I do.
- Say your prayers, Fritzy.

697
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,052
Your body may belong to the Kaiser,
but your soul belongs to Plunkett.

698
00:42:54,121 --> 00:42:55,952
- Shut up!
- Dry up!

699
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:58,253
You got the loudest mouth
in the allied army.

700
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,088
- Plunkett this. What a you think...
- Plunkett.

701
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:02,986
- Listen to McManus show off.
- Shut up.

702
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:19,045
- Well, Padre, pray for us.
- I will, indeed.

703
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:24,107
- The reserve area's back there, Father.
- Yes, I saw it on the map.

704
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,516
But you've gotta go back there, Father.
It's regulations.

705
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:29,715
It's funny. With all the firing going on,
I seem to have lost my hearing.

706
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,726
- But you can't come up here.
- Yes, I know. I know all about it.

707
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,330
Now, suppose one of the boys met
with an accident.

708
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:40,127
It has been known
to happen up here, you know.

709
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:44,403
You wouldn't deny them the consolation
of my master's presence now, will you?

710
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:46,234
As the priest said to the bishop,

711
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:49,640
I only go to the races
in case one of the jockeys fall off.

712
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,405
That's near enough.

713
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:03,749
Hey.

714
00:44:03,824 --> 00:44:05,917
You were told to keep your mitts off
that Very pistol.

715
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:08,291
What do you want the heinies to do?
Blow us all over France?

716
00:44:08,362 --> 00:44:09,954
What's the matter, Sarge,
you're getting the wind up?

717
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,591
There's always an MP job waiting for you
back in Paris, you know.

718
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:15,498
Or maybe just those stripes
taking again, huh?

719
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,129
Maybe you ain't heard tell, soldier.
There's a war going on up here.

720
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:20,469
Yeah, I read about it in papers
but I ain't seen none of it yet.

721
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:21,565
If this is all there is to it,

722
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:23,132
I don't see
what those limeys and frogs are...

723
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,838
If I were you, I'd keep my big yap shut up
about the limeys and the frogs

724
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,744
until I earned a fighting man's right
to talk.

725
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:30,750
- And maybe you think I won't.
- Oh, hero stuff, huh?

726
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:33,281
Would you be satisfied with
the Distinguished Service Cross?

727
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:35,447
Well, if I don't get it,
it's because I got a wooden one.

728
00:44:35,522 --> 00:44:37,114
And if you don't believe me, you got a bet.

729
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:39,056
Gee, that guy hates himself.

730
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:41,492
Yes, and that makes it unanimous.

731
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:48,933
Come on, you guys,
let's match to see who watches the baby

732
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:52,631
- and who goes to sleep, huh?
- Nothing doing. We all watch.

733
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:09,488
- Look at that dent, will you?
- Better there than in your skull.

734
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,555
I'll pay that son off.

735
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:20,459
Oh, still wanna play, huh? All right.

736
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:28,974
Better to see you with, Grandma.

737
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:30,270
- Hey, what're you doing?
- Hey, lay off!

738
00:45:30,344 --> 00:45:32,938
Hey, what're you doing? Cut that out.

739
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:36,341
Phone headquarters at once.
No one was authorized to send up a flare.

740
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,817
- Yes, sir.
- Here's a kiss for you.

741
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,361
Those heinies seem to be sore
at someone.

742
00:45:55,569 --> 00:45:56,593
Where's your duty roster?

743
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,967
- Corporal Sullivan.
- Yes, sir?

744
00:45:58,038 --> 00:45:59,198
Have some coffee, gentlemen.

745
00:45:59,273 --> 00:46:00,968
Duty roster.

746
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:05,337
Following men report to Sergeant Kilmer
for action detail at 4:00 a.m.

747
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:08,074
Pipe down, will you? Answer your names.

748
00:46:13,454 --> 00:46:15,581
Take it easy now. Quiet.

749
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:18,657
Here you are, Corporal.

750
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:19,919
Laffy.

751
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,062
What a spot! What a spot!

752
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:26,690
Now, what's wrong?

753
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,462
I'm worried. You know what?

754
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,230
Those shells is talking to me.

755
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:32,397
Yeah? What are they saying?

756
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:36,136
You ain't never gonna
get back to the New York.

757
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,348
- Hey, stretcher-bearers.
- They're wrecking the whole line.

758
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,906
We'll be next!

759
00:46:53,961 --> 00:46:56,088
The Sergeant warned you not to mess
with those flares.

760
00:46:56,163 --> 00:46:58,757
All these guys are dead and you done it!

761
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,126
Jack!

762
00:47:01,535 --> 00:47:02,797
O'Keefe!

763
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:13,602
A bull's-eye.

764
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:16,975
Hey, what are you doing here?
Get back up to your post!

765
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,348
Let me by! I don't want to stay up there
and get blown to pieces.

766
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,716
What do you think I am, crazy?

767
00:47:20,787 --> 00:47:22,277
And you're the one
that's always popping off

768
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:23,721
about all the medals
you're gonna win, huh?

769
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,623
What kind of 69th man are you?
You yellow skunk!

770
00:47:26,693 --> 00:47:30,493
- Now go on, get back up to that fire-step.
- I won't! I won't!

771
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:40,564
Steady, men! We'll get out!
Come on, step on it!

772
00:48:10,537 --> 00:48:13,631
- Jerry! Jerry, are you hurt?
- No, Father. No.

773
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:15,607
What is it, then?
What were you doing in a dugout?

774
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:17,041
You're supposed to be
in the front line on duty!

775
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,601
- Who sent you back?
- Nobody. You see, Father...

776
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,012
Yes, I do see. Indeed I do.

777
00:48:22,082 --> 00:48:25,245
I met Lieutenant Wynn down there,
and then the shell hit.

778
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,811
- Where are the rest of them?
- Down there, buried alive.

779
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,853
Let's go.
All right, you guys, now, all together, now.

780
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:39,125
One, two, heave!

781
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:42,134
Now, don't let this thing cave in
on my head.

782
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:47,199
All right, now give me your hand.

783
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:50,243
- I'm dying. My leg's off...
- Give me your hand.

784
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,404
- Here, take his head.
- It's Moran!

785
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,277
- He's out of his head.
- Shut up.

786
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,409
- Got a stretcher, somebody. Hurry up.
- Keep on working, there, you guys.

787
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:00,919
Have mercy on us. Have mercy.

788
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:03,616
They're buried alive, all of 'em. Buried.

789
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,952
Now, now, snap out of it, son.

790
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,549
- We'll get the others.
- No, you'll not.

791
00:49:06,627 --> 00:49:08,356
You'll never get them out of there.

792
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:12,091
Lieutenant Norman's dead with a beam
that crushed his head like an egg.

793
00:49:12,165 --> 00:49:15,726
They're all dead, except Eddie Kearney
and Lieutenant Wynn.

794
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,696
They can't get out.
They'll be dead in a minute.

795
00:49:20,474 --> 00:49:22,942
Let me make a try at it, will you?
My brother is down there.

796
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,637
I'm sorry, soldier. But there ain't a chance.

797
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,042
- But...
- Steady, kid.

798
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:27,740
Dolan, I'm going down there.
Hold my ankles.

799
00:49:27,814 --> 00:49:29,873
- Yes, Father.
- Sergeant, get your men to lift this beam.

800
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,008
You can't get down there, Father.

801
00:49:31,084 --> 00:49:32,984
The whole place is gonna cave in
in a minute.

802
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,680
- Go on, do as he tells you.
- Yes, sir.

803
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:36,416
Go ahead, Father.

804
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:44,654
Ed. Ed Kearney!

805
00:49:45,165 --> 00:49:48,794
John Wynn! It's Father Duffy, boys.
It's Father Duffy.

806
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:50,896
Can you hear me?

807
00:49:53,306 --> 00:49:56,469
It's just like a tourist
kissing the Blarney Stone.

808
00:50:22,235 --> 00:50:25,693
"...perhaps their brave young spirits hear
The bugle sing

811

You will not need them any more

812

00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:32,999
Sit down! Come on, get going.

825
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:43,374
Them French donkeys don't even
understand their own language.

826
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:45,244
Give me one of them vegetables!

827
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:48,651
I'll show you how to do it. Angelique!

828
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,916
Hey, look. Why don't we carry the donkey?

829
00:51:56,727 --> 00:51:59,719
Does not one of you understand
the sensitive nature of the poor darling?

830
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:01,526
A donkey's not a gunnery mule.

831
00:52:01,598 --> 00:52:03,998
A donkey's sensitive and high-strung,
like a thoroughbred.

832
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:05,796
Now watch me.

833
00:52:57,621 --> 00:52:59,088
Beer. One. <i>Compris?</i>

834
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:10,665
There you are.

835
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:14,435
- American money?
- Keep the change.

836
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,167
Hey, you with the face,
ain't you supposed to be on guard duty?

837
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:23,008
Oh, yeah. Halt! Who's there?

838
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:26,276
Well, if it ain't old rattlesnake puss.

839
00:53:26,783 --> 00:53:28,614
On your dogs!

840
00:53:28,685 --> 00:53:32,018
Now, wait a minute, Sarge.
This beer is very important.

841
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:35,015
Take your hands off me,
you son of a banshee,

842
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:36,684
or I'll knock your teeth down your throat.

843
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,819
- You'll do what?
- You heard me.

844
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:42,423
Or are you gonna hide behind
those five and ten-cent stripes again?

845
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:45,059
Plunkett, you've been begging for this
for a long time,

846
00:53:45,135 --> 00:53:47,126
and now you're gonna get it.

847
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:50,530
Give it to him.

848
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:57,804
Move over so he can fall down.

849
00:53:57,881 --> 00:54:01,715
Not yet! Come here! Come on! Come on.
Come on.

850
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:05,255
You're bouncing around like a rubber ball.
Come on, get up.

851
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:06,949
Get him, Sarge!

852
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:11,324
Can't hit me, can you?

853
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:15,592
Never touched me.

854
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:32,613
Attention!

855
00:54:35,686 --> 00:54:38,052
Sergeant, what's the meaning of this?

856
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:42,148
- Well, sir... That is, sir...
- All right, take the air. The party's over.

857
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:44,656
You know the penalty
for hitting a subordinate.

858
00:54:44,728 --> 00:54:45,786
Yes, sir.

859
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:47,830
Report to your company commander.
You're under arrest.

860
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:51,129
- Yes, sir.
- You can prefer charges in the morning.

861
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:53,169
Charges? What charges?
There was no fight, sir.

862
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:55,864
- What do you mean, no fight?
- No, no. There, there was no fight.

863
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:57,338
I was just showing Mike...

864
00:54:57,407 --> 00:54:59,739
I mean, the First Sergeant
how to roll away from a left hook.

865
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:01,744
Just a little exhibition for the boys,
that was all.

866
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:02,904
No, there was no fighting.

867
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,574
A real fight,
I'd mop up the joint with the big...

868
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:07,116
I mean, my friend, the First Sergeant.

869
00:55:07,184 --> 00:55:08,811
No, it was just a gag,
we were only fooling.

870
00:55:08,885 --> 00:55:11,115
He never laid a finger on me.

871
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:17,226
Yeah, so I see.

872
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:19,790
All right, Sergeant.
Forget that arrest order.

873
00:55:19,863 --> 00:55:20,921
Yes, sir.

874
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:24,695
And the next time you two want to frolic,
don't play so rough.

875
00:55:28,572 --> 00:55:32,235
Well, I guess I'm after owing you
something, soldier.

876
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:36,508
You don't owe me nothing.

877
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,514
I don't need
Donovan to do my fighting for me.

878
00:55:38,582 --> 00:55:41,176
I can do my own, and I love it.

879
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:43,911
Yeah.

880
00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:49,150
- Well, that settles it.
- Settles what?

881
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:52,389
Plunkett. Gonna get rid of him.
Transfer him out of the regiment.

882
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:55,431
- Why? Because of that little brush-up?
- Oh, that and everything else.

883
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:57,091
He's a bad egg, a troublemaker.

884
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:58,691
Unreliable in the line.

885
00:55:58,769 --> 00:56:01,738
He's getting himself talked about
in a way that the 69th doesn't relish.

886
00:56:01,805 --> 00:56:04,569
Bill, why don't you give the boy a chance?

887
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:07,102
I happen to know
he had a pretty bad shock up there.

888
00:56:07,177 --> 00:56:09,338
Well, it's ruined his value as a soldier.

889
00:56:09,413 --> 00:56:12,177
I've heard nothing but complaints
from his company commander on down.

890
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:15,446
Picking fights back of the lines
and dodging patrols when he's up there.

891
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:17,680
Reporting sick
when he's detailed to wiring parties.

892
00:56:17,754 --> 00:56:21,212
Just one excuse after another,
whenever there's a man's job to be done.

893
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,885
I won't have a man like that
in the battalion.

894
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,258
Bill, I don't want
to interfere with discipline.

895
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:28,991
Don't you think it's possible
he has a good side?

896
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:30,124
I think he showed that.

897
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,225
Well, he can develop it someplace else.
My mind's made up.

898
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:33,428
Bill.

899
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:38,903
I think you'll agree that war has ruined
many a young fellow. Too many in fact.

900
00:56:38,975 --> 00:56:41,535
Well, now here's an exceptional case,
one in a thousand,

901
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:43,476
where maybe the war will do a little good.

902
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:46,539
Why, Bill, I've heard you say yourself
a hundred times,

903
00:56:46,616 --> 00:56:48,516
the 69th makes men.

904
00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:52,152
Well, it makes men out of cowards
not cowards out of men.

905
00:56:52,222 --> 00:56:55,191
Here's my chance to prove
that you're right.

906
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:59,919
You trust me and keep Plunkett on
and I'll assume full responsibility.

907
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:03,560
Oh, that blarneying tongue of yours.

908
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:06,898
I should have let them send you home to
collect funds for the Knights of Columbus.

909
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,962
Maybe you wanted to save me the trouble
of swimming back.

910
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,338
Come on, Bill. What do you say?

911
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:14,175
Shall we let Plunkett stay?

912
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:16,940
All right. All right, but from now on,
he's your guinea pig.

913
00:57:17,013 --> 00:57:18,844
- All right. Oh, Bill, there's something else.
- What?

914
00:57:18,915 --> 00:57:21,008
What if you give Captain Mangan
an okay to provide buses

915
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:22,642
to take the Jewish boys to Napier.

916
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:24,016
Sure. I'll take care of that.

917
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:26,214
You know, it's a good thing
there's no Mohammedans in the regiment.

918
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:27,688
I'd have no time for the war.

919
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:29,554
Well, it's a fortunate thing
you're not a crook.

920
00:57:29,626 --> 00:57:33,221
You could sell the Brooklyn Bridge
to the police department.

921
00:57:42,072 --> 00:57:44,700
- Yes?
- Private Plunkett reporting.

922
00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:47,235
The Major sent for me, sir.

923
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:51,278
Will you see Captain Mangan
about those buses now?

924
00:57:51,348 --> 00:57:53,145
Yes, sir.

925
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:03,892
Plunkett, you're a rotten soldier.

926
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:08,792
You have no loyalty,
no fighting spirit, nothing.

927
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:10,394
Stand up!

928
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:16,134
I've been getting more and more fed up
with you ever since Camp Mills.

929
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:19,073
But you jawed so much
about getting at the Germans,

930
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:21,736
I thought getting up to the front
might discover something in you.

931
00:58:21,811 --> 00:58:23,403
Well, it didn't!

932
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:25,715
Beginning with our first night
in the trenches you...

933
00:58:25,782 --> 00:58:27,807
- Oh, so Father Duffy talked, huh?
- He didn't have to.

934
00:58:27,884 --> 00:58:31,183
I've got eyes
and so has every man in the regiment.

935
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:35,950
It was the same at Baccarat, Champagne.
In fact, every fight we've been in.

936
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,552
You're quite a scrapper, Plunkett,
behind the lines.

937
00:58:40,397 --> 00:58:41,728
Pretty handy with your fists.

938
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:43,265
Trying to prove how tough you are

939
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:45,426
to a bunch of men
who no longer believe you.

940
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:48,096
Consequently, I've decided to boot you
out of the regiment,

941
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:51,607
- transfer you someplace else.
- Well, if the Major thinks that's best, sir.

942
00:58:51,675 --> 00:58:54,906
I did, and so do you,
but Father Duffy didn't.

943
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:59,279
He believes in you.
That's why you're getting another chance.

944
00:58:59,983 --> 00:59:01,746
But remember this,

945
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:05,154
the first sign of malingering
or sloppy soldiering,

946
00:59:05,222 --> 00:59:08,749
Father Duffy nor the Archbishop of Meath
won't be able to save you,

947
00:59:08,825 --> 00:59:11,191
and it won't be a transfer this time.

948
00:59:11,261 --> 00:59:12,523
Yes, sir.

949
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:33,846
That's all, Plunkett.

950
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:37,713
Plunkett!

951
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:43,381
We're moving up to the attack
across the Ourcq River tonight.

952
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,896
It's your chance to redeem yourself
and prove that Father Duffy was right.

953
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:48,487
Now, get going.

954
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:52,631
Yes, sir.

955
01:00:35,945 --> 01:00:38,914
Hold it! Hold it!
This is as far as we go tonight.

956
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:41,780
Man the fire-steps end detail outposts
and fix up these parapets.

957
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:43,011
- Yes, sir.
- We'll consolidate here.

958
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:44,314
- Wynn.
- Yes, sir.

959
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:48,380
Turn around. I want you to take a message
back to Regimental PC.

960
01:00:54,731 --> 01:00:57,894
- Who's there?
- Relax now, Jerry.

961
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:01,001
It's only Father Duffy
making his parish rounds.

962
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:02,834
Is there anything I can do for you?

963
01:01:02,906 --> 01:01:05,397
No. Just go away and let me alone,
will you, Father, please?

964
01:01:05,475 --> 01:01:08,308
No, wait. Don't go. Stay a minute, huh?

965
01:01:09,946 --> 01:01:13,279
You're like the old Irishman
who'd rather be quarreling than Ionesome.

966
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:16,217
A little jumpy, are you? Well, we all are.

967
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:18,650
The old 69th's been taking it
on the chin today,

968
01:01:18,722 --> 01:01:21,156
but it's come back to stage a knockout.

969
01:01:21,224 --> 01:01:23,988
- Yes, and you're part of it.
- Part of it?

970
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:27,453
Ducking into shell holes,
going ahead only when I had to,

971
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:30,829
seeing guys I knew torn to pieces
and figuring any minute

972
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,064
some heinie I can't get my hands on
is gonna crack a bullet into me.

973
01:01:35,138 --> 01:01:37,265
Oh, it isn't the fight I mind, Father,

974
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,332
I love a fight and I've never been afraid
of anything in my whole life before,

975
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:41,843
but this stuff.

976
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:45,369
See what a bursting shell can do
to human flesh and blood.

977
01:01:45,448 --> 01:01:48,474
It's made me yellow. Me, of all the guys
in this whole outfit. Yellow!

978
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:51,213
Scared is the word, Jerry. Not yellow.

979
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:54,249
- And you'll get over it.
- Get over it.

980
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:56,516
When everywhere I go,
and everything I do,

981
01:01:56,593 --> 01:01:59,960
I see the faces of Casey and O'Keefe
and Lieutenant Wynn

982
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:02,554
and all those guys I killed up
in the dugout in Rouge Bouquet

983
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:05,829
staring at me and saying nothing,
just hoping I'll get mine.

984
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:08,496
I can't fight it anymore. I've tried.

985
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:11,631
Goes along for a while, everything's okay
and then suddenly it hits

986
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:15,576
until I feel as though if I don't get up
and run away I'll go nuts.

987
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:19,876
And I'd be out of this by now
if you hadn't stopped my transfer.

988
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:22,440
It's not for me to say, Jerry,
that's nonsense.

989
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:23,816
It isn't.

990
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:27,782
But Jerry,
there's only one way you can lick it.

991
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:30,621
- That's through faith and prayer.
- Faith.

992
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:34,496
Listen to those bullets.
Can faith stop them?

993
01:02:34,697 --> 01:02:37,894
If a guy gets his pins blown off,
will prayer put them back on again,

994
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:39,434
or bring the dead back to life?

995
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:43,461
No, but faith and prayer can help you
defeat the fear that's possessing you.

996
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,304
Oh, Jerry, it's peace and courage
I'm offering you.

997
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:49,243
If you'd only open up your heart
and take it.

998
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:52,513
- Father Duffy, come quickly!
- All right.

999
01:02:52,582 --> 01:02:54,550
Think it over now, Jerry.
Ask the Lord to help you.

1000
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:58,883
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- No, there's nothing you can do.

1001
01:03:11,868 --> 01:03:13,358
Major Donovan.

1002
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,506
It's from headquarters.

1003
01:03:25,582 --> 01:03:27,607
Air reconnaissance reports
an enemy patrol moving out

1004
01:03:27,684 --> 01:03:29,515
to occupy the far edge of the Colas woods.

1005
01:03:29,586 --> 01:03:31,781
We'll send out a patrol, intercept them
and bring in prisoners.

1006
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:33,345
- Very good, sir.
- No, not you yet.

1007
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:35,357
Lieutenant Ames and I will go forward
and size them up.

1008
01:03:35,425 --> 01:03:37,290
- You'll follow up with the patrol.
- Yes, sir.

1009
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,022
I need 10 men to follow up
with Sergeant Kilmer.

1010
01:03:40,096 --> 01:03:42,656
It's a dangerous mission.
Who wants to volunteer?

1011
01:03:42,732 --> 01:03:43,824
- I'll go, sir.
- Good.

1012
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,094
- Take me, sir.
- Okay, sir.

1013
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:46,567
- Sure thing, sir.
- Count me in.

1014
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:47,830
- Okay, with me, sir.
- Not without me, you won't.

1015
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:48,893
Okay.

1016
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,001
Thanks, Plunkett!

1017
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:55,235
Give me five minutes' start.

1018
01:03:55,311 --> 01:03:58,337
Then arrange for a combat patrol to go
forward in charge of Sergeant Wynn.

1019
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:00,678
Yes, sir. Watch yourself

1020
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:03,172
- Listen, Sarge...
- Quiet.

1021
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:05,271
Why don't we wait here with Big Mike
and the rest of them?

1022
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:06,781
Pull yourself together.
The Major's up there.

1023
01:05:06,849 --> 01:05:08,749
We can't let him down.

1024
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,252
Sarge, let me go back and see
if Big Mike and...

1025
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:21,797
Shut up, you fool. If you start yelping now,
you'll get us all killed.

1026
01:05:21,864 --> 01:05:24,025
Well, then why don't we wait
for the rest of them?

1027
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,567
Let go of me.

1028
01:05:25,802 --> 01:05:27,827
I want to get out of here!

1029
01:05:29,472 --> 01:05:32,100
I don't want to stay here and be killed!

1030
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:34,432
Let go of me!

1031
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:38,570
Wynn! McManus! Come here!

1032
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:46,745
- Hey, come back here!
- Wait a minute! Come back here!

1033
01:05:47,256 --> 01:05:49,224
- What's the matter with you?
- They're all killed up there!

1034
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:51,692
- Donovan, Ames, all of them!
- And you're the only survivor?

1035
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:54,025
- Yeah.
- Where's your rifle?

1036
01:05:54,097 --> 01:05:56,224
- I... I...
- Why, you...

1037
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:37,036
Look out!

1038
01:06:46,983 --> 01:06:50,146
Take care of these prisoners
and retire to cover!

1039
01:06:50,553 --> 01:06:52,680
Come on, sauerkraut, get up.

1040
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:55,055
Get down!

1041
01:06:55,324 --> 01:06:57,519
Get them down! Get down! Get down!

1042
01:06:57,593 --> 01:06:59,857
Get them down.

1043
01:07:06,736 --> 01:07:09,364
Hold on, Major! We're on our way!

1044
01:07:20,216 --> 01:07:23,708
- Go ahead, step on it.
- Go ahead, sauerkraut. Hurry up.

1045
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:36,124
- Mission accomplished, sir.
- Nice work.

1046
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:39,225
We'll dig in here. Now that
we've got the wood, we'll hold them.

1047
01:07:39,302 --> 01:07:42,237
Run back and get B company up here.
My PC will be right here.

1048
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:43,567
Yes, sir.

1049
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,933
Who yelled back there
and upset the apple cart?

1050
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:47,236
I wouldn't know, sir.

1051
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:49,278
- It was Plunkett, sir.
- Plunkett?

1052
01:07:49,345 --> 01:07:52,542
- Is he killed?
- No, sir. I fumbled my chance, sir.

1053
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:55,412
Never mind. I'll take care of him later.

1054
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:10,458
Battalion attention!

1055
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,301
Eyes right! Eyes right!

1056
01:09:12,562 --> 01:09:14,928
I don't know
what these guys are so cheerful about.

1057
01:09:14,997 --> 01:09:17,989
Believe me, in the next war,
there's gonna be three guys missing.

1058
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:20,661
Me and the two guys that's chasing me.

1059
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,734
This is the toughest spot
we've ever been in.

1060
01:09:26,809 --> 01:09:29,744
Is it true you're going to attack in
the Argonne without artillery preparation?

1061
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:31,871
- It is.
- What's headquarters thinking of?

1062
01:09:31,948 --> 01:09:33,916
The element of surprise.

1063
01:09:33,983 --> 01:09:37,680
Regardless of the fact
that it'll probably cost us 60% casualties.

1064
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:39,347
Well, orders are orders.

1065
01:09:39,422 --> 01:09:41,856
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, Major.

1066
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:44,222
Well, I'll be seeing you up there
after you get underway.

1067
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:46,727
Oh, by the way, Bill,

1068
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,794
- were you able to do anything for...
- Plunkett?

1069
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:52,801
No, nothing. Not even if I could.

1070
01:09:53,502 --> 01:09:54,992
But Bill, that's so unfair.

1071
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,301
As I told the court-martial,
it was all my fault.

1072
01:09:57,373 --> 01:09:59,773
If I hadn't changed his transfer,
it never would have happened.

1073
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:02,470
He shouldn't be executed for something
he couldn't help.

1074
01:10:02,545 --> 01:10:05,878
Now, look, Father,
let's don't go into this thing again.

1075
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:07,813
I know what you're going to say.

1076
01:10:07,884 --> 01:10:10,114
There's a weakling in every outfit,

1077
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:14,919
but never in history has a 69th man
disgraced his regiment like Plunkett.

1078
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:19,350
Tomorrow morning at 7:00, he's going
to get exactly what's coming to him

1079
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:21,862
and may God have mercy on his soul.

1080
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:54,852
Is there anything I can do for you, Jerry?

1081
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,928
What can you do for me?
This is curtains, ain't it?

1082
01:11:00,603 --> 01:11:03,572
Well, there's still time to make your peace.

1083
01:11:06,242 --> 01:11:08,870
Don't stand there talking like a sap.

1084
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:12,146
Don't you understand,
they're gonna shoot me.

1085
01:11:12,214 --> 01:11:13,681
Tomorrow morning I get it.

1086
01:11:13,749 --> 01:11:17,150
If you're so hot to help me,
do something about that.

1087
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:19,847
I've tried, Jerry. Believe me, I have.

1088
01:11:20,556 --> 01:11:22,820
I've gone to the Colonel,
to general headquarters.

1089
01:11:22,892 --> 01:11:25,827
Told them it was all my fault
and not yours.

1090
01:11:26,095 --> 01:11:29,360
Looks like there's no use.
There's nothing left for me to do.

1091
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:31,525
Do you really believe it's because of you
I'm in this jam?

1092
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,467
- I do indeed.
- It's not my fault I couldn't take it, is it?

1093
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:37,028
Jerry, you're not the only one
in the regiment who ever knew fear.

1094
01:11:37,106 --> 01:11:38,835
It just happened you couldn't face it,
that's all.

1095
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:40,432
Well, you can still do something.

1096
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:43,171
Let me out of here. Help me to escape.

1097
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:48,149
Look, you just said
they had no right to keep me here.

1098
01:11:48,217 --> 01:11:51,880
Let me out. I'll get home some way and
after the war they'll forget all about me.

1099
01:11:51,954 --> 01:11:54,047
Why not? You're a priest.
They can't do anything to you.

1100
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:57,820
Jerry, you're forgetting
I'm a soldier as well as a priest.

1101
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:01,655
Yeah. I see.

1102
01:12:03,466 --> 01:12:05,832
Jerry, ask me anything else.

1103
01:12:07,336 --> 01:12:10,305
I will. I'll ask you to beat it.

1104
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:13,031
- But you don't...
- Oh, let me alone!

1105
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:14,369
Please.

1106
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:33,793
- Hello, Alec. How is it?
- For a mass suicide, the set-up's great.

1107
01:12:33,863 --> 01:12:37,299
A thick belt of uncut wire with strong
enemy machine gun positions behind it.

1108
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:39,129
If they'd given us artillery preparation,

1109
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:41,226
we could have blasted lanes
through that wire.

1110
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:43,965
- What about tanks? Do we get them?
- Sure.

1111
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,406
After we take the two villages beyond.

1112
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:47,908
A sweet job that will be.

1113
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:50,741
We'll be cut to pieces from that hill
before we get well started.

1114
01:12:50,813 --> 01:12:53,543
- Why the devil are they ordering...
- Ever read Tennyson, Alec?

1115
01:12:53,616 --> 01:12:56,517
"Ours not to reason why
Ours is but to do and..."

1116
01:12:56,585 --> 01:13:01,113
- You said it. Zero hour the same?
- Just before dawn, 4:45.

1117
01:13:05,194 --> 01:13:08,220
Reception committee is tuning up.
I'd better get back to my battalion.

1118
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:09,628
Good luck.

1119
01:13:36,058 --> 01:13:39,118
- Well, Mike.
- Hello, Father.

1120
01:13:39,728 --> 01:13:41,525
How do you feel now?

1121
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:45,532
Now, don't be like that.

1122
01:13:46,702 --> 01:13:49,933
It takes more than a.77 shell
to keep an Irishman down.

1123
01:13:50,005 --> 01:13:52,030
I'm on me way out, Father.

1124
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:56,511
Could you maybe just
say a bit of a prayer?

1125
01:13:58,114 --> 01:14:00,412
Wouldn't you be wanting
one of your own faith?

1126
01:14:00,483 --> 01:14:01,780
No time.

1127
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:12,156
- You mean you want me to help you pray?
- Yes, Father.

1128
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:16,555
'Tis the only thing that's kept me going
for many a long day.

1129
01:14:25,774 --> 01:14:29,767
"O Lord God, I know that
my life and my death are in thy hands.

1130
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:33,276
"May it be thy will to heal me.

1131
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:38,044
"But if thou willest my death,
may it be atonement for all my sins.

1132
01:14:39,255 --> 01:14:42,019
"Into thy hands I entrust my spirit.

1133
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:45,788
"Thou art my redeemer, Lord God of Truth.

1134
01:14:47,496 --> 01:14:51,830
"The Lord shall reign forever and ever.
Hear, O Israel.

1135
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:56,265
"The Lord our God, the Lord is one."

1136
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:13,648
Thank you, Father.

1137
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,495
Don't tell me
they're starting to shell this place?

1138
01:15:35,844 --> 01:15:38,836
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

1139
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:48,521
Jerry!

1140
01:15:51,427 --> 01:15:53,361
- We're getting out of here!
- Where'll we go?

1141
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:55,624
What are you gonna do with me?

1142
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:04,304
Jerry, you've looked in the face of death
these past few hours.

1143
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:07,204
Death by execution
and death from shellfire.

1144
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:10,336
Now, you're still alive.
I can't let you stay here with this.

1145
01:16:10,412 --> 01:16:12,642
You're free, Jerry.
Free of everything but yourself.

1146
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:15,809
Now, I can't tell you what to do.
I can only point out two roads to you.

1147
01:16:15,884 --> 01:16:18,580
One to safety for awhile. Perhaps to home.

1148
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:21,646
The other... Do you hear that?

1149
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:24,050
It's falling on your regiment, Jerry.
They're in a trap.

1150
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:25,923
It's possible
not one of them will come out alive.

1151
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:28,930
There are your two ways. Whichever
you choose, you'll have to walk alone.

1152
01:16:28,998 --> 01:16:31,057
What do you mean, whichever I choose?

1153
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:34,159
Do you think I'm crazy enough
to try and go through that?

1154
01:16:34,236 --> 01:16:35,863
Goodbye, Father.

1155
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,821
Jerry! Jerry!

1156
01:17:00,029 --> 01:17:01,826
Give me a hand here.

1157
01:17:20,783 --> 01:17:24,514
Don't go in there, Father!
That whole roof might cave in any minute!

1158
01:17:27,056 --> 01:17:28,523
Father Duffy!

1159
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:31,218
Boys! Boys! Boys!
Everything's going to be all right.

1160
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:32,760
This is Father Duffy.

1161
01:17:32,828 --> 01:17:34,227
Oh, aren't you ashamed?

1162
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:36,628
Kicking up a row like this
over a few shells?

1163
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:38,963
Timmy, lad, I'm surprised.

1164
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:41,195
Do you want Almighty God to think
you've forgotten him?

1165
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:43,795
Come on, now, Sean, buck up.
Buck up, all of you.

1166
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:46,067
Believe me, I tell you,
everything is gonna be all right.

1167
01:17:46,141 --> 01:17:48,234
Get hold of yourself now, Timmy.
Come on, now.

1168
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:51,507
We'll all say the Lord's Prayer.
Repeat after me.

1169
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:57,309
- Our Father who art in heaven.
- Our Father who art in heaven.

1170
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:59,980
- Hallowed be thy name.
- Hallowed be thy name.

1171
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:02,990
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

1172
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:06,255
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

1173
01:18:06,328 --> 01:18:08,091
Give us this day our daily bread.

1174
01:18:08,163 --> 01:18:09,755
Give us this day our daily bread.

1175
01:18:09,832 --> 01:18:11,823
Forgive us our trespasses.

1176
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,162
Forgive us our trespasses.

1177
01:18:13,235 --> 01:18:15,635
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1178
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:17,797
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1179
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:21,604
- Lead us not into temptation.
- Lead us not into temptation.

1180
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:27,781
- But deliver us from evil.
- But deliver us from evil.

1181
01:18:28,751 --> 01:18:29,843
Amen.

1182
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:33,982
Thank you, Father.

1183
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:46,164
And if it so be that he find it,
yea men, I say to you,

1184
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:49,032
he rejoiceth more for that

1185
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:51,766
than for the ninety-nine
which went not astray.

1186
01:18:58,414 --> 01:19:01,508
Them things is getting on my nerves.
Give me a cigarette, will you, mac?

1187
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:04,484
- What for? You can't smoke up here.
- I don't want to smoke it.

1188
01:19:04,553 --> 01:19:07,852
I want to chew it
to keep my teeth from chattering.

1189
01:19:11,794 --> 01:19:13,022
Hang on, men.

1190
01:19:13,095 --> 01:19:14,562
The tanks will be here soon.

1191
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,963
Hey, Paddy, watch those big ears of yours.
They'll think you're a battleship.

1192
01:19:18,033 --> 01:19:19,864
How'd you boys like
a nice cold bottle of beer?

1193
01:19:19,935 --> 01:19:21,027
I'd settle for a hot one.

1194
01:19:21,103 --> 01:19:25,039
Hey, Brian, wait till the wife hears
you've been out all night.

1195
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:29,937
Sorry, old-timer.

1196
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:42,254
- It looks kind of mean, Alec.
- Kind of?

1197
01:19:42,324 --> 01:19:45,521
With all that around us, and
that wire out there, we're cooked, Bill,

1198
01:19:45,594 --> 01:19:48,119
- unless we get through.
- Well, we've got to get through.

1199
01:19:48,197 --> 01:19:52,031
Once we get into their trenches,
we can finish the thing off.

1200
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,829
Well, here's a scrap that should satisfy
even the fighting Irish, eh, Sergeant?

1201
01:20:28,904 --> 01:20:31,896
Yes, sir, 'tis a fine bit of a scrimmage, sir.

1202
01:20:36,712 --> 01:20:38,612
We've got to knock out
those machine guns somehow,

1203
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,443
cut a hole through that wire.

1204
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:42,780
Are all those Stokes mortars
out of commission?

1205
01:20:42,851 --> 01:20:45,649
Yes, sir. And the crew's all killed, sir.

1206
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:49,850
Maybe there's one we could fix up
somehow. That would do it.

1207
01:20:49,925 --> 01:20:52,826
Well, there's Scanlon's outfit
about 50 yards off the flank there,

1208
01:20:52,895 --> 01:20:55,830
- so maybe I could have a look, sir.
- Go ahead.

1209
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:04,532
Come on, you men!

1210
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:53,846
What're you doing up here
with fighting men?

1211
01:21:53,922 --> 01:21:55,321
Did you run the wrong way again?

1212
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:58,018
I didn't come here to look
at your big, ugly puss. Now shut up!

1213
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:00,721
- Show me how to use this stovepipe.
- What for?

1214
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:04,892
So you can turn it on the 69th and kill off
a few more good men like Tim and Kilmer?

1215
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:08,198
Listen, I know what you think of me
and I know what I think of you,

1216
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:11,569
but never mind our own private scrap.
I'll give you a belly full of that later.

1217
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,700
Now, shut your big Irish trap
and show me how to use this Stokes!

1218
01:22:14,776 --> 01:22:16,744
If you don't,
I'll shove this bayonet right through you!

1219
01:22:16,812 --> 01:22:19,781
You show me how to use it,
so I can't miss.

1220
01:22:20,749 --> 01:22:23,775
There's nothing to it. Here.
Put your hand on the fuse.

1221
01:22:23,852 --> 01:22:26,343
Pull the pin. Drop it in!

1222
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:28,480
They don't look like much.

1223
01:22:30,993 --> 01:22:32,392
Enough TNT in them shells

1224
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:34,759
to blow a lane in that wire
as wide as Central Park.

1225
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:37,094
Here's a kiss for you, heinie!

1226
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:50,544
- Are you all right?
- All right?

1227
01:22:53,248 --> 01:22:57,378
- I'll show them krauts. Can you walk?
- I guess so. Why?

1228
01:22:57,986 --> 01:23:00,614
Grab some men
and get this ammunition forward.

1229
01:23:02,257 --> 01:23:06,057
Hey! You 69th men!
Grab these shells and move up!

1230
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:38,491
Put a sausage skin on this one, you krauts!

1231
01:23:41,496 --> 01:23:43,464
Here's one for the 69th!

1232
01:23:45,467 --> 01:23:47,435
- Who's firing that Stokes?
- Big Mike.

1233
01:23:47,502 --> 01:23:49,527
Here's one from Brooklyn!

1234
01:23:51,206 --> 01:23:53,174
If he can keep that up,
he'll blow a hole in that wire

1235
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:56,039
big enough to sail the <i>Leviathan</i> through.

1236
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:00,941
Here's one for Yonkers and the Bronx!
Divide it among you!

1237
01:24:02,184 --> 01:24:04,550
Here's one for you, pal!

1238
01:24:12,194 --> 01:24:14,128
And another one!

1239
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:20,825
Look out, Mike!

1240
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:24,502
Now, Alec.

1241
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:44,724
Mike! Mike!

1242
01:24:44,793 --> 01:24:46,454
God bless you!
You've saved the day for us!

1243
01:24:46,528 --> 01:24:47,790
They're swarming up
and over and through.

1244
01:24:47,863 --> 01:24:51,458
- Man, what a fight you made.
- What a fight I made, Major?

1245
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:55,228
- There's the man who made it. Not me.
- It's not Plunkett?

1246
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:56,494
It is, sir.

1247
01:24:59,374 --> 01:25:01,137
I'm sorry, soldier.

1248
01:25:12,854 --> 01:25:14,321
Father Duffy.

1249
01:25:15,323 --> 01:25:16,813
Father Duffy.

1250
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:21,190
Jerry, this is Father Duffy.

1251
01:25:23,965 --> 01:25:26,365
I just been talking to your boss.

1252
01:25:37,045 --> 01:25:39,878
- You're not afraid, are you, Jerry?
- No, Father.

1253
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:42,416
Not anymore.

1254
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:49,820
I been an awful lot of trouble to you,
haven't I, Father?

1255
01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:58,258
Father, who's that with you?

1256
01:25:59,067 --> 01:26:01,228
Major Donovan, Big Mike.

1257
01:26:04,105 --> 01:26:05,402
Mike?

1258
01:26:06,775 --> 01:26:08,834
I'm awful sorry about Tim.

1259
01:26:19,621 --> 01:26:21,282
I'm ready, Father.

1260
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:38,030
I once thought this man was a coward.

1261
01:26:39,274 --> 01:26:41,174
A coward, sir?

1262
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:43,874
From now on,
every time I hear the name of Plunkett,

1263
01:26:43,945 --> 01:26:46,379
I'll snap to attention and salute.

1264
01:27:15,043 --> 01:27:16,738
Pretty soft for you colonels.

1265
01:27:16,811 --> 01:27:19,905
- My feet are killing me.
- You see? You should be wounded.

1266
01:27:19,981 --> 01:27:21,346
Then they'd be cheering you, too.

1267
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:22,678
Where was you wounded, buddy?

1268
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:23,979
- Hoboken.
- Hoboken?

1269
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:26,714
Yeah. I sprained me ankle
getting off the boat.

1270
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:28,449
Say, this is fine.

1271
01:28:03,725 --> 01:28:05,590
O heavenly Father,

1272
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:09,494
here I beseech you the prayer
of this, America's lost generation.

1273
01:28:10,131 --> 01:28:12,599
They loved life, too, O Lord.

1274
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:15,795
It was as sweet to them
as to the living of today.

1275
01:28:16,037 --> 01:28:20,565
They accepted privation,
wounds and death,

1276
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:25,643
that an ideal might live.
Don't let it be forgotten, Father.

1277
01:28:26,815 --> 01:28:31,946
Amid turmoil and angry passions, when
all worthwhile things seem swept away,

1278
01:28:32,988 --> 01:28:38,324
let the tired eyes of a troubled world
rise up and see the shining citadel

1279
01:28:38,994 --> 01:28:42,691
of which these young lives
formed the imperishable stones.

1280
01:28:43,164 --> 01:28:44,426
America,

1281
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:49,801
the citadel of peace, peace forevermore.

1282
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:55,466
This I beg of you through Christ, our Lord.

1283
01:28:56,478 --> 01:28:57,911
Amen.
