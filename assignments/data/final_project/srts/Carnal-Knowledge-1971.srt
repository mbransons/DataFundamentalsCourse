1
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:18,100
- If you had a choice...
- Yeah?

2
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:22,300
Would you rather love a
girl, or have her love you?

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,900
I'd want it mutual.

4
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,667
If you couldn't have it mutual.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,900
Would I rather be the one
who loves, or is loved?

6
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:32,700
Yeah.

7
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,833
It's not that easy a question.

8
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:37,000
I think I'd rather be in love.

9
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:39,967
Me, too.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,767
I wouldn't want to
get hurt, though.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,533
You were in love with Gloria.

12
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:50,133
I was starting to be
in love with her,

13
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:53,000
then she let me feel her
up on the first date.

14
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:55,000
Turned me right off.

15
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:57,067
You kept going with her, though.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,133
Well, she let me feel her up.

17
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,933
Yeah, what about Gwen?

18
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:07,567
Her I could talk to.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,800
I've never been able
to talk to any girl.

20
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,867
I was really getting
crazy about her.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,533
She's stuck up.

22
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,900
Wouldn't let me lay a hand on her.

23
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:20,533
So I went back to Gloria.

24
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,900
Well, you want perfection.

25
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,967
What do you want, wise guy?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,933
She just has to be
nice, that's all.

27
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:30,300
You wouldn't want her beautiful?

28
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,933
She doesn't have to be beautiful.

29
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,000
I would like her built, though.

30
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:37,233
I want mine sexy-looking.

31
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,967
I wouldn't want her
to look like a tramp.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
Sexy doesn't mean she has
to look like a tramp.

33
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,667
There's a middle ground, you know?

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,600
I would want that, yeah.

35
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:52,733
Tall, very tall...

36
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,133
Eww, that would scare me.

37
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:00,833
She should be very understanding.

38
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:04,100
Start the same sentences together.

39
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,700
Yeah, I'd like that.

40
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:09,800
Big tits...

41
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,300
Yeah, but still a virgin.

42
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,200
I don't care about that.

43
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,533
Come on.

44
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:22,233
I wouldn't mind if she was
a little ahead of me,

45
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,300
with those big tits,

46
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:28,133
and knew hundreds
of different ways.

47
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:31,867
I want more of a companion.

48
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,967
The other stuff I can
get on the outside.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,033
The first time I do it,

50
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,100
I want it beautiful.

51
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:42,200
I don't want to waste
it on some beast.

52
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,633
I feel the same way
about getting laid

53
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,900
as I feel about going to college.

54
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,667
I'm being pressured into it.

55
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:53,033
- You like that?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:57,000
- I give her to you.
- What's wrong with her?

57
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:01,133
- I'm a generous guy.
- Yeah, I'm grateful.

58
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,567
How do I break the news to her?

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,033
- You go over there.
- Yeah?

60
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:10,633
There's a way to talk
to girls, you know?

61
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,733
Tell her a joke.

62
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,800
What joke?

63
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,067
Tell her about your
unhappy childhood.

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,867
- That's not bad.
- But don't make it like an act.

65
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,567
No.

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,000
Go ahead.

67
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,967
Go ahead, schmuck.

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,067
If you don't, I will.

69
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,967
You?

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,733
You can't even stand up.

71
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,533
I fucked up.

72
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,233
It's my turn.

73
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,300
What do you mean, it's your turn?

74
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,567
She's mine, you gave her to me.

75
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,100
You struck out.

76
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,033
I get two more times at bat.

77
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,300
This is the first time

78
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,567
I've ever been to a college mixer.

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,767
- Me too. I hate them.
- I hate them too.

80
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,833
It's such a phony way
of meeting people.

81
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,600
Everybody puts on an act.

82
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,133
So, even if you meet somebody,

83
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,669
you don't know who you're meeting.

84
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,004
Because you're meeting the act.

85
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:29,796
That's right, not the person.

86
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,667
I'm not sure I agree.

87
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
- With what?
- With what you said.

88
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,267
No, I don't either.

89
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,533
You don't agree
with what you said?

90
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,933
How do you feel about it?

91
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,733
I think people only like to think
they're putting on an act,

92
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,800
but it's not an act,
it's really them.

93
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,267
If they think it's an
act, they feel better,

94
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:48,933
because they think they
can always change it.

95
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,400
You mean, they're
kidding themselves,

96
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:51,867
because it's not really an act.

97
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,733
Yes, it is an act, but they're
the act. The act is them.

98
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,100
But if it's them, then
how can it be an act?

99
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,000
- Because they're an act.
- But they're also real.

100
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,300
- No.
- I'm not real?

101
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,567
- No.
- I'm an act.

102
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,533
It's all right, I'm an act too.

103
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,233
Don't you behave differently
with different people?

104
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,300
No.

105
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,900
With your family?

106
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,967
I thought you meant
different people.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,867
Well, sure, with my family...

108
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,933
And with friends,
you're another way.

109
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:22,033
Well, sure, with my friends.

110
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,700
And with your teachers,
you're still another way.

111
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,700
So which one is you?

112
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,733
Well, when you put it that way...

113
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,800
You ought to be a lawyer.

114
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm gonna be a lawyer.

115
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,467
A lady lawyer.

116
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,233
You're from Smith, right?

117
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,300
Huh.

118
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,033
Do you like it?

119
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,933
Yeah, I like it all right.

120
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,467
Do you like Amherst?

121
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,933
Sure, why shouldn't I?

122
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,000
My parents worked
very hard to send me.

123
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,167
I'd better like it.

124
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,400
Do you have a name or something?

125
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,167
Susan.

126
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,433
I'm Sandy.

127
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:19,400
I think you can make out with her.

128
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,100
Think so?

129
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,000
She's stuff.

130
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:25,467
You think so?

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,200
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

132
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:31,100
I shouldn't try
somebody else, then?

133
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:33,200
Who?

134
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,767
She was the best-looking
girl at the whole mixer.

135
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,833
I'll say that for her...

136
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:43,900
Wasn't she?

137
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,967
Her tits were too small.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,033
Yeah, I was thinking that.

139
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,767
The hell with her.

140
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,833
But her legs were great.

141
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,767
You think so?

142
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,867
Standing so close, I really
couldn't tell about her legs.

143
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,800
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

144
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,367
She's got some funny ideas.

145
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,467
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

146
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,433
Don't rush me, please.

147
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,333
What's the matter?

148
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,267
I like you very much, Susan.

149
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,700
It's our third date.

150
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:24,767
I like you too.

151
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,667
You let me kiss you last week.

152
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,733
And this week.

153
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,700
If I could kiss you
once last week,

154
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,767
I should be able to kiss you
at least twice tonight.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,367
- Well?
- You're the only boy

156
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,567
I know that I can talk to.

157
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,633
I can't see you being
quiet for any guy.

158
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,567
No, not quiet, exactly.

159
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,800
But if you know
somebody's not going

160
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,467
to approve of what you are...

161
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,867
- Whatever that is.
- Whatever that is.

162
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,233
Well, you just don't tell him.

163
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,633
I mean, if I like a boy and I
want him to keep liking me,

164
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,700
and I'm brighter than he is,

165
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:59,800
I have to not show it or
I'll lose him, so it's hard.

166
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,367
Well, I wouldn't want
anyone overly bright.

167
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,433
Yeah, but you wouldn't
feel threatened.

168
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:05,933
I might be bothered a little.

169
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:08,733
I don't think you would nearly
as much as some people.

170
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,333
Now, for instance, someday
I want to write novels.

171
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,400
Not now, but you know, later on,

172
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:14,767
when I have something to say.

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,333
Now, that doesn't
threaten you, does it?

174
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,300
No...

175
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,233
Maybe a little.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,267
Don't press so hard.

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,333
See, it's better when it's gentle.

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,533
See?

179
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,367
What are you grinning at?

180
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,433
Did you feel her up yet?

181
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,200
Come on, I like this girl.

182
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't want to ruin things.

183
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,733
Was I right about kissing her?

184
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,333
Listen, we had a
big fight over it.

185
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:01,967
And you won?

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,433
Well, I don't know
if I won or not.

187
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,467
Why are you letting
yourself be pushed around?

188
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,067
You're the one who's
pushing me around.

189
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,467
I guess I won. Sure, I won.

190
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,767
She kissed me five times.

191
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,367
Now, that's when you should've

192
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,733
put your hand on her tit.

193
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,367
Come on, when this girl's
nice enough to kiss me,

194
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:20,833
I should do that to her?

195
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:23,367
You act as if she's
doing you a favour.

196
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,867
Well, it is sort of
a favour, isn't it?

197
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,133
I mean, when a girl
lets you kiss her

198
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,833
and, you know, go on from there.

199
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:32,433
Feel her up and, you
know, the rest of it.

200
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,367
Go all the way and the rest of it.

201
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,800
I mean, isn't it a favour?

202
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,200
What's in it for her?

203
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:41,167
I mean, if she's not
getting paid or anything.

204
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:44,767
Fuck you.

205
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,967
Okay, okay, I'll feel her up.

206
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:55,133
Sandy, please take your
hand off my breast.

207
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,033
- Why?
- Because I want you to.

208
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,367
How can it be any fun for you
if you know I don't want it?

209
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,467
I didn't say it was fun.

210
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,033
Then why is your hand where it is?

211
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:09,800
Because, the way we're
going, by this time,

212
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,433
I should be feeling you up.

213
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,433
I don't feel that way
about you, Sandy.

214
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,167
I feel that way about you.

215
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,433
Well, you want me
to feel something

216
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,767
for you too, don't you?

217
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,900
I thought you liked me.

218
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,167
I do like you,

219
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,100
but I like you for other reasons.

220
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,500
So...

221
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,800
So... if we went any further,

222
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,067
there wouldn't be those
reasons anymore.

223
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,767
Well, we might have
something else, though.

224
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,167
What?

225
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,933
Something else.

226
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,867
You're the first girl I've
ever done that to, Susan.

227
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,233
I didn't know that.

228
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:20,933
It doesn't show?

229
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,400
No.

230
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,767
Well, it's something we both
have to go through, I guess.

231
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,900
Susan, are you a virgin?

232
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,433
What do I do with my other hand?

233
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,100
What are you gonna
do with your hands?

234
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:37,000
And then what?

235
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,233
She told me to take my
hand off her breast.

236
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,067
- What did you do?
- I said I didn't want to.

237
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,167
Then what?

238
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,133
She said how could it be fun
for me if she didn't like it?

239
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,900
Oh, Jesus.

240
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,000
- I said I thought she liked me.
- Yeah?

241
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:50,367
She said, "I like you
for other reasons."

242
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:52,300
Other reasons?

243
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,167
So, I told her how I
really needed this.

244
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,433
What did you tell her?

245
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:57,267
You know, that it
was my first time.

246
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,967
Your first time what?
What did you say exactly?

247
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,067
I don't remember exactly.

248
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,933
That she was the first girl
I ever tried to feel up.

249
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:07,100
- You told her that?
- Was it a mistake?

250
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,800
I wouldn't.

251
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,367
Then she got nicer to me.

252
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,267
What do you mean nicer?

253
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,133
She put my hand on her breast.

254
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,167
You mean you put it on,
she left it there.

255
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,033
No, she picked it
up and put it on.

256
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:22,833
She took your hand like this?

257
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,733
And put it on like this?

258
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,100
That's right.

259
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,467
So, I didn't know what to think.

260
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,200
You didn't, huh?

261
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,100
For just wanting to be friends,

262
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,500
she's suddenly getting
pretty aggressive.

263
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,433
Yeah, then what?

264
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,500
I asked her if she was a virgin.

265
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,767
- You're kidding.
- Was that a mistake?

266
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,433
Anyhow, she is.

267
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:43,500
She says.

268
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:47,233
So now you got, what, one hand
or two hands on her tits?

269
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:49,367
By this time, she's put the
other hand on the other one.

270
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,867
She put both hands on? Two hands?

271
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
So I said, "What are you
gonna do with your hands?"

272
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,833
You didn't say that.

273
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,767
It just came out.

274
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,367
Yeah, then what?

275
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,433
Let me see if I got this.

276
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,433
She unzipped my fly.

277
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:07,900
Bullshit artist.

278
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,933
Then what? Then what?

279
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,833
Then she did it.

280
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:13,833
Did what?

281
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:17,067
Bullshit artist.

282
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,300
She really did that to you?

283
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,233
- She did that?
- Yeah.

284
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,333
Hello, is this Susan?

285
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,767
Well, you don't know me.
I'm a friend of Sandy's.

286
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,133
His room-mate.

287
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,067
Yeah, Jonathan.

288
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,933
He told you about me?

289
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:40,733
Yeah, so, I'm just here at Smith

290
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,167
for tonight,
practically on campus.

291
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,967
I was just taking a
drive, you know,

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,467
and I found myself
practically on campus.

293
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,867
How do you like Smith?

294
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,267
What's your major?

295
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Where did you go to high school?

296
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,900
What do you do in the summer?

297
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:08,400
Do you always answer a
question with a question?

298
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,600
Do you always date your
best friend's girlfriends?

299
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:13,867
Sandy told me you were beautiful.

300
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,933
He told me you were sexy.

301
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,000
I guess he's just a poor judge.

302
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:20,600
I guess he meant you
had personality.

303
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,833
Good grief.

304
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,900
You have a special quality.

305
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:26,967
I like girls who are special.

306
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,267
I'm hardly that special.

307
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,700
Some people you can
tell about right away.

308
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,467
Most girls I talk to
it's like we're spies

309
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,567
from foreign countries and
we're speaking in code.

310
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,967
Everything means something else.

311
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,567
Like, I say, "Would you
like to take a walk?"

312
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,267
And it means something else.

313
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,000
And she says, "I can't.

314
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,733
I've got a French test tomorrow."

315
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,667
And it means something else.

316
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,300
And you say, "I'll come
over and help you study."

317
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:53,600
And it means something else.

318
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,800
You're very sharp, I like that.

319
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,867
And that means something else.

320
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,767
You're too sharp.

321
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,500
Does that bother you?

322
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:03,567
It interests me.

323
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,633
Is that more code?

324
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,700
We'd be good together.

325
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,733
I'm dating your best friend.

326
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,767
He won't mind.

327
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,733
- How do you know?
- I won't tell him.

328
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,800
What if I mind?

329
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,233
You want to go out Friday?

330
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm seeing Sandy.

331
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:24,900
Saturday?

332
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,767
I have a date.

333
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,867
Sunday?

334
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,333
I'm seeing my folks.

335
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,400
Where do they live?

336
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:33,733
Newton.

337
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:35,800
Sunday night?

338
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,433
I'll be too tired.

339
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,700
I'll help you get over your folks.

340
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:45,633
How about it, Susan?

341
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,533
What are you so afraid of?

342
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:50,967
Not you.

343
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,667
I think I'm in love.

344
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,200
I think I'm in love.

345
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:10,300
Bullshit artist.

346
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,400
I really think so.

347
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,867
Did you get in yet?

348
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,333
What's that got to do with it?

349
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:23,400
How do you know if you don't know

350
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,467
how you are in bed together?

351
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,300
Well, that's not everything.

352
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,600
It's a lot.

353
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:30,867
She tells me thoughts
I didn't even

354
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
know I had until she
tells them to me.

355
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,967
It's unbelievable.
I can talk to her.

356
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,700
You can talk to me too.
Are you in love with me?

357
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,233
I can say things to her

358
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:41,967
I wouldn't dare say to you.

359
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,233
What, for instance?

360
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,300
Things you'd laugh at.

361
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,533
I'm laughing now.

362
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,733
She thinks I'm sensitive.

363
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,800
Sensitive?

364
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,433
Sensitive? Oh, boy.

365
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,700
Whoa-ho.

366
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,600
What do you talk to
her about, flowers?

367
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,367
Books.

368
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,433
Books?

369
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:13,000
You phony,

370
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,267
I read more books than you do.

371
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,800
Yeah, well, I'm gonna start.

372
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,733
I'm reading "The Fountainhead."

373
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,633
"The Fountainhead." What's that?

374
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,333
It's her favourite book.

375
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,867
You ever hear of
"Jean-Christophe"?

376
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,800
What's that?

377
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,867
It's a classic, you moron.

378
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,267
Gonna read it after
"The Fountainhead."

379
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,367
Yeah, you ever read
"Guadalcanal Diary"

380
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,367
- by Richard Tregaskis?
- No.

381
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,867
That was a best
seller and I read it.

382
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,767
Ever read "Gentleman's Agreement"

383
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,867
by Laura Z. Hobson?

384
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,633
You ever read "A Bell For
Adano" by John Hersey?

385
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm gonna read
everything from now on.

386
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,867
I read more than you do.

387
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,267
So who's the one who's
sensitive? You or me?

388
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,533
Come on, who's sensitive?

389
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:02,867
I've had a very
messed-up childhood.

390
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,933
What does your father do?

391
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,700
He fails.

392
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,533
It's not funny.

393
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,867
I'm sorry. Were you very poor?

394
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,600
My father couldn't
hold on to a job.

395
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,700
He kept giving me advice.

396
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:20,800
The more he failed, the
more advice I got.

397
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,900
He's a Communist, my father.

398
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:27,000
We're Republicans.

399
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:30,633
Sometimes I think I'm
a Communist, though.

400
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,867
Me, too.

401
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,933
We have so much, and
other people have,

402
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:37,000
you know, so little.

403
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:39,800
After I get set up as a lawyer,

404
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,400
what I'd really like to
do is go into politics,

405
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:45,467
public service.

406
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,533
What really gets me is I was

407
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,767
too young to fight
in the war, because

408
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,700
what was that all about
except to prove that

409
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,767
if everybody pitches in,

410
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,367
the plain people have a chance.

411
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,767
So, even though I'm the first

412
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,533
in my family to get an education,

413
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,633
I don't ever want to
forget where I came from.

414
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,533
You're a lot more
serious than I thought.

415
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,667
I know.

416
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,767
Where did you meet her?

417
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm another person with her.

418
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,500
You wouldn't recognise me.

419
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:19,633
The things that come
out of my mouth.

420
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:22,700
Boy, she really sounds like
something. Is she built?

421
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:24,967
She's, she's got a quality.

422
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,900
She doesn't talk much,

423
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:29,400
but the things she
says are so sharp.

424
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,567
We should double-date sometime.

425
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,667
Well...

426
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,600
I want to know her a
little better, you know,

427
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:39,500
before we double-date.

428
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,433
Gee, isn't it great?

429
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:43,300
A month ago, neither of
us even knew a girl.

430
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,600
What's her name?

431
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,567
Myrtle.

432
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,700
Bullshit artist.

433
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,900
You're kidding. You're not
kidding me? You really did it.

434
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,533
You bastard. You beat me to it.

435
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,267
What's up?

436
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,267
Next is my turn.

437
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,333
I don't think she'll do it, Sandy.

438
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,933
She will. I've just been
taking it easy on her.

439
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:57,000
Sandy, believe me,
find somebody else.

440
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:59,567
Are you crazy, when I'm
right on the verge?

441
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,333
I'll see her tomorrow night.

442
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,400
Sandy?

443
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:06,967
Yeah.

444
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,233
Do you ever talk to her about me?

445
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:11,800
Yeah, sure, sometimes.

446
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,533
Do me a favour, will you?

447
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:14,900
What?

448
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:16,800
Don't tell her I got laid.

449
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,867
Please, Susan.

450
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,600
Sometimes I want to do it,

451
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,833
and a second later, I
don't want to do it.

452
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:30,800
Let's do it.

453
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,500
I don't know why you
put up with me.

454
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,867
I don't think I can do it.

455
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,000
It really hurts, Susan.

456
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:48,933
Let me...

457
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,467
Not anymore.

458
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,233
Please, Sandy.

459
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:53,733
Not anymore.

460
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,700
Susan, let's do it.

461
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,333
I love you.

462
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,467
Do you have anything?

463
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,833
How long have you had that?

464
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,567
Not too long.

465
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,433
Not a year or anything?

466
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm sure it's okay.

467
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,500
I don't wanna take any chances.

468
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,267
These things have to be okay.

469
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:25,967
It's okay.

470
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,733
I'm positive it's okay.

471
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:56,667
It's as if you're the first guy

472
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,700
in history who ever got laid.

473
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,300
I'm the first guy in my
history who ever got laid.

474
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,500
I like it too, but you don't
hear me crowing about it.

475
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:05,767
There's such a thing as
good taste, you know?

476
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,267
- What's the matter with you?
- Jeez.

477
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,867
After you started scoring,
what did I get out of you?

478
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,833
"We did it standing, sitting,
in the car, under the car.

479
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,900
Myrtle, Myrtle, Myrtle..."

480
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:19,400
Maybe you forget, but I knew
Susan before you knew Myrtle,

481
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,467
and who scored first? You.

482
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,467
That didn't make me feel
very good, you know?

483
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,300
In fact, it made me
feel very jealous.

484
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,233
But did I try to shut you up?

485
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,300
Did I say, "I'm tired of
hearing about it already"?

486
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:32,000
I didn't say it, because I'm your
friend, so I sat through it.

487
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:34,933
Okay, okay. You made your point.

488
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:36,633
Sometimes I think
I'm a better friend

489
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,367
to you than you are to me.

490
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:00,433
Didn't you ever do that?

491
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:02,833
Of course, I...

492
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,900
I knew what the word
"misled" meant.

493
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:06,433
I just didn't know...

494
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,933
So, when I first saw it in print,

495
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:11,467
I thought it was "myzeled".

496
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,400
He had been "myzeled."

497
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:18,533
I kept wondering, what does
this word mean? "Myzeled"?

498
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:21,533
Sexy. Let's "myzle."

499
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,267
Has anybody ever heard
of "Round John Virgin"?

500
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,833
One of the guys in "Robin Hood."

501
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:29,367
That's Little John.

502
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,467
What did you say? Round John...?

503
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,367
Round John Virgin.

504
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,900
Is that in Falstaff?

505
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:38,500
"Round John Virgin
mother and child."

506
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:40,933
Round John Virgin mother...?

507
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:45,400
♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪

508
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:46,733
All right, gunshee.

509
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,367
Gunshee?

510
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,433
G-u-n-s-h-y, gunshee.

511
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:51,967
Gun-shy...

512
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,600
I always thought it was gunshee.

513
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:56,667
Susan, do the one about the bear.

514
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,367
You'll love this, John.

515
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,433
Oh, yeah, the hymn we
used to sing in church

516
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,633
about the bear with crossed eyes?

517
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,267
Whose name was Gladly.

518
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,533
Gladly the bear?

519
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:10,467
Don't you know it? Gladly
the cross-eyed bear.

520
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,367
Gladly the cross-eyed
bear, get it?

521
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,233
Gladly the cross... oh,
Gladly the cross-eyed bear.

522
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:18,867
All right, pronounce this:

523
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,800
c-h-o-p-h-o-u-s-e.

524
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,500
Chophuse...

525
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,433
Chophus...?

526
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:29,500
Chophouse.

527
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,533
This has to stop.

528
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,333
I don't know how to tell him.

529
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:38,967
You don't have any trouble

530
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,467
telling him a lot of other things.

531
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,300
- What does that mean?
- The way you talk to him.

532
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,467
I don't ever hear you
talking to me that way.

533
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,667
What way?

534
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,900
I don't know.

535
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,833
He's very vulnerable.

536
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:55,700
I don't want to hurt him.

537
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,333
You're hurting me.

538
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,733
He loves me.

539
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:03,500
That's no reason to
go to bed with him.

540
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,700
You would have just
gone on, wouldn't you,

541
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,767
if he hadn't told me?

542
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,700
I don't know.

543
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,733
I would have never known
a thing about it.

544
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,700
I don't know, maybe.

545
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,300
Boy, you're really something.

546
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:26,600
I don't feel like something.

547
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:28,700
I feel like nothing.

548
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:35,400
How much longer do you
expect me to take this?

549
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,967
I'm trying to tell him.

550
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,267
I see how you're trying.

551
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,533
It's not my fault. I don't
enjoy these fights.

552
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:45,900
Listen, it's me you're
supposed to be in love with.

553
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,600
- I'm gonna tell him.
- What?

554
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,466
I'm gonna tell him
about you and me.

555
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:53,500
No, Jonathan.

556
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:55,000
Why don't you give me some of

557
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:57,000
the understanding
that you give to him?

558
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:58,833
You're stronger.

559
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:04,733
You tell him everything else.

560
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,633
You can tell him about us.

561
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,900
What do you mean, I tell him
everything? Who says so?

562
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:11,500
He tells me, he's my best friend.

563
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,367
Are you going to tell him?

564
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,233
He's so helpless.

565
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,900
Susan, I love you.

566
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:53,133
Why can't you be more with me

567
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,733
like you are with Sandy?

568
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:03,467
She says she's no good for me.

569
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:09,833
Maybe she's trying to
let you down easy.

570
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:13,967
Go ahead and laugh.

571
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,033
It adds up.

572
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:21,700
Go ahead and laugh.

573
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,933
You know every mood of mine like
you know every mood of his.

574
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,900
- No.
- How come?

575
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:29,942
I don't know.

576
00:33:29,943 --> 00:33:32,067
You don't tell me thoughts
I never knew I had.

577
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,867
- Does he say I do that?
- Yes.

578
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,911
Then I guess I must.

579
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,267
You do it all right,
so do it with me.

580
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,133
I can't.

581
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,800
You can do it with him,
you can do it with me.

582
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,100
Now tell me my thoughts.

583
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,333
- I can't.
- Why can't you?

584
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,333
I can't with you.

585
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,733
This has gone far enough.

586
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,233
I cannot stand any
more ultimatums.

587
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:52,100
This is my last one.

588
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:54,500
Now, tonight, you tell him about
us, or tomorrow, I tell him.

589
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,100
Look at me, Susan.

590
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,933
Now tell me my goddamn thoughts.

591
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:19,900
Hello.

592
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,533
You didn't do it, did you?

593
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,600
No.

594
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:26,367
Why not?

595
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,833
He looks at me with such trust.

596
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:34,933
How do I look at you?

597
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:37,000
With bitterness.

598
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,000
It used to be trust.

599
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:42,700
At least you know my thoughts.

600
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,767
Did you tell him?

601
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,667
What do you think?

602
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,300
No.

603
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,700
So, what do we do now?

604
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,833
I don't know.

605
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:00,900
I guess I get an ultimatum.

606
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,700
Do you think there's
any sense in this?

607
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,600
In what?

608
00:35:17,633 --> 00:35:19,567
In you and me.

609
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,867
That's up to you.

610
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,967
No, it's up to you.

611
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,967
I don't see any point in it.

612
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,200
I wish I were wrong.

613
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:42,333
I don't feel anything anymore.

614
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,700
Neither do I.

615
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:09,333
The reason I didn't say
anything to Sandy...

616
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,900
I knew he wouldn't believe me.

617
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,767
And I'd go into details

618
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,233
so he would have to believe me.

619
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:22,633
And I knew he'd come
running to you,

620
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:25,400
and I knew you'd tell him
everything I said was true,

621
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,367
and I knew then you'd
go to bed with him.

622
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,733
Yeah, that sounds like
what would happen.

623
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,233
So?

624
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,100
So?

625
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,300
Jonathan...

626
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,400
I'll always be your friend.

627
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,200
Jesus, Susan, I hope not.

628
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,367
It's going to be buggy.

629
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,467
It's not going to be buggy.

630
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,667
It's the tropics. What do
you mean? It's the jungle.

631
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,533
You can't cover yourself
from head to toe.

632
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,267
I'll get eaten alive.

633
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,633
You don't know what it's like.

634
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,367
You've never camped out before.

635
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,733
Isn't he being silly, Jonathan?

636
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:29,933
- I am not.
- Are too.

637
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:31,267
- Am not.
- Are too.

638
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,567
You're a real city boy.

639
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,267
How about the cot?

640
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,733
Come on, sweetie, we've
got a sleeping bag.

641
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,667
You're really serious about
sleeping on the ground?

642
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,633
You are a baby.

643
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,367
Christ, this knapsack's heavy.

644
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,767
Well, I told you you overpacked.

645
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,267
What in the world do you plan
to do with a pillowcase?

646
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,700
Put it back.

647
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,533
Well, you are a nut.

648
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,233
Isn't he a nut, Jonathan?

649
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:54,267
You pack your things.
Let me pack mine.

650
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,600
I'm just trying to help.

651
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:56,867
Well, help your own stuff.

652
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,384
You have packing to do.

653
00:37:58,385 --> 00:37:59,484
We don't even have room.

654
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,933
We're going in a little car.

655
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:03,633
Jesus...

656
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:05,700
You want her?

657
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:07,767
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

658
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,367
Will you look at the pair on her?

659
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,333
Get a look at that schmuck
trying to keep up with her.

660
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,567
They're always with
guys like that.

661
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,300
That guy must be 60 if he's a day.

662
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,667
Maybe he'll have a heart attack.
You could save his life.

663
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,267
Get her number and fuck her.

664
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,233
You bastard...

665
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:27,700
Bastard...

666
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:29,500
How's Susan?

667
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,267
Couldn't be better.

668
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,667
I always said it,
and I say it now.

669
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,900
You found yourself a jewel.

670
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:38,867
She is a jewel.

671
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:43,333
Not bad, that one.

672
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:46,433
Listen, you must be getting
more than your share.

673
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,833
I'd get married in a minute if
I could find the right girl.

674
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:52,600
Bullshit artist. You and
your actress friends.

675
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,700
Are you kidding, Doctor?

676
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:56,567
You're the one
that's got the deal.

677
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,467
I mean, what can I say?

678
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,867
"Take your clothes off, baby,

679
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,733
I wanna check your capital gains."

680
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:05,900
I just look.

681
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:08,300
Sure, you do.

682
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,400
I really do.

683
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:13,800
Susan's plenty enough
woman for one man.

684
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,733
Hey, look at that.

685
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:21,400
That's Sally Joyce.

686
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:23,400
Didn't I see her on Ed Sullivan?

687
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:25,433
I fucked her once.

688
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,900
Bullshit artist.

689
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:29,933
We used to do her taxes.

690
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:32,533
She's with another firm now.

691
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:34,600
Why don't you say hello?

692
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,667
She wouldn't remember me.

693
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,633
She's a real
ball-buster, that one.

694
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:41,800
I've been through the
mill with her kind.

695
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,733
Yeah?

696
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:47,233
You think a girl goes for
you, and you find out

697
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:49,633
she's after your money
or your balls...

698
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,400
or your money and your balls.

699
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,633
Women today are better
hung than the men.

700
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:07,433
I should have your problems.

701
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:11,000
It's not as easy getting
laid as it used to be.

702
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:13,267
I don't think I fuck more than

703
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,233
a dozen new girls a year now.

704
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:18,933
Maybe I'm too much
of a perfectionist.

705
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:21,000
This last one came so close

706
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:22,900
to being what I wanted.

707
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:24,800
Good pair of tits on her...

708
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,700
Not a great pair.

709
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:29,633
Almost no ass at all,
and that bothered me.

710
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,533
Sensational legs.

711
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:33,633
I would have settled for the legs,

712
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:36,700
if she had just two more inches
here and three more here.

713
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:38,933
Anyhow...

714
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:41,367
that took two years
out of my life.

715
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,800
You don't want a family?

716
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:47,533
I don't want to put it
down, but who needs it?

717
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:50,300
You can't make fucking
your life's work.

718
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:53,533
Don't tell me what I
can and can't do.

719
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,667
You're so well-off?

720
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:26,233
Susan's a very good homemaker.

721
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:28,633
Very efficient.

722
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:31,733
I come home, everything
is in its place...

723
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:33,967
which I like, because it's tiring

724
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,400
putting in a full
day at the office,

725
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:38,600
then Doctors' Hospital
for a couple of hours.

726
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:40,667
So it's nice to have everything

727
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,433
in its place when I get home.

728
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:44,200
A Martini, dinner, the kids.

729
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,933
We don't watch much television.

730
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:52,233
We like to read aloud
to each other.

731
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:55,333
We used to have more
friends than we do,

732
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:57,267
but we don't have
that many anymore.

733
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,567
So, on weekends we might
entertain a little

734
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,367
or go over to see a friend.

735
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Come into town, see a
play or a good film.

736
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,600
It's not glamorous or anything.

737
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,233
There are other things
besides glamour.

738
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,767
You have a long lifeline.

739
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,400
I like that.

740
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:39,833
The way you run your
nail across my...

741
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,833
You're difficult
to get along with.

742
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:43,767
Me?

743
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,733
Bobbie...

744
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:49,633
You always know your own mind.

745
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,900
Right this minute, anyway.

746
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,367
You won't stop going after

747
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,300
what you want until you get it.

748
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:04,500
Let me see your hand.

749
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,500
Well?

750
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:14,800
You are built.

751
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,833
You see that in my hand?

752
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:20,333
Even your hand is built.

753
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:23,400
I think you're a dirty old man.

754
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:25,767
I'm a dirty young man.

755
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,467
How old are you?

756
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,300
How old do you think I am?

757
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,867
19.

758
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,467
No...

759
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,967
20?

760
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,500
No.

761
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:38,233
21?

762
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:39,933
22?

763
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,600
No.

764
00:44:41,633 --> 00:44:44,800
24?

765
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:47,600
You skipped 23.

766
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:49,333
23?

767
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:51,233
No.

768
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,933
24?

769
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,533
No.

770
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,867
25?

771
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,667
26?

772
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,233
No.

773
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:02,233
27?

774
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,267
You're getting warm.

775
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,667
28?

776
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,567
No.

777
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,533
29?

778
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:15,500
I like going out with older women.

779
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:24,967
Are you married?

780
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,267
Are you kidding?

781
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,967
You don't want to get married?

782
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,367
I'd marry you in a minute.

783
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,567
Can you cook?

784
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,300
Spaghetti.

785
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,500
I can cook spaghetti.

786
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:39,567
Good, you do the cooking.

787
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,533
What will you do?

788
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:45,600
What would you like me to do?

789
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:48,367
What would you like to do?

790
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,433
I asked you first.

791
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:53,333
Well, I'm not gonna
answer you first.

792
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:56,433
Well...

793
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:59,433
I can sew.

794
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:01,833
Doesn't sound like
much of a marriage.

795
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:04,700
Me cooking spaghetti,
and you sewing.

796
00:46:04,733 --> 00:46:06,600
You want a divorce?

797
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:09,367
I'll take you for
every cent you got.

798
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,233
I didn't know I was
marrying a gold digger.

799
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:16,533
You won't take pity on me?

800
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:18,767
Only if you say you're sorry.

801
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,600
I'm sorry.

802
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:26,233
And you'll never do it again.

803
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:28,600
I'll never do it again.

804
00:46:28,633 --> 00:46:30,967
And you'll always be a good boy.

805
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,933
Yes, Mama.

806
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,733
You like to be mothered?

807
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:41,533
I'd like to be smothered by you.

808
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:44,867
What else would you
like me to do to you?

809
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:11,533
Well...

810
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:13,600
How do you like it?

811
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:17,233
How do I like what?

812
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:21,000
My, you know.

813
00:47:21,033 --> 00:47:23,467
What do I know?

814
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:27,933
You know everything.

815
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,400
I know you.

816
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,333
And I know you.

00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:36,400
Help.

831
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,667
Oh, nurse?

832
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,733
What is it, Mr. Weisenborn?

833
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:09,967
Will you come in here
a minute, please?

834
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,300
Certainly, Mr. Weisenborn.

835
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,900
Why, Mr. Weisenborn.

836
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:37,933
Most guys I know are pricks.

837
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:45,533
I don't know anymore
what they want.

838
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:48,800
I'll be happy to tell you.

839
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:52,400
They want... the boodle.

840
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:55,500
But they ain't gonna
get the boodle.

841
00:50:55,533 --> 00:50:57,567
Goddamn right.

842
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,233
Because this kid here
has got the boodle.

843
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:04,633
You're pretty sure of
yourself, aren't you?

844
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:13,433
You're a nice man.

845
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:17,367
And you're a very lucky girl.

846
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:32,233
You know something, Sam?

847
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:34,933
What is it, sweetheart?

848
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:39,400
You think it would
be a fatal mistake

849
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:41,200
in our lives if we shacked up?

850
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,700
It's very difficult, Bobbie.

851
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:54,933
These last couple of weeks,

852
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:58,367
we get along so well together.

853
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,667
The idea...

854
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,567
I like you very much.

855
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,867
So much...

856
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,567
this idea...

857
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,333
to be perfectly honest,

858
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,900
I mean,

859
00:53:23,933 --> 00:53:27,700
it sounds very good to me.

860
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:30,800
Let's both give it

861
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,567
a couple of days
to think about it.

862
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,567
It sounds, like...

863
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,833
well, very good.

864
00:53:44,467 --> 00:53:48,400
Very, very...

865
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:51,967
well... good.

866
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,400
Only, our eyes should be open.

867
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:00,800
If we should go into this,

868
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:05,300
we should know exactly
what we're getting into.

869
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,367
It's just a shack-up.

870
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,267
I'm not asking for
your hand in marriage.

871
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,233
Yeah, well,

872
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:14,400
as long as we both
understand that.

873
00:54:14,433 --> 00:54:16,433
We do.

874
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:19,533
I just thought it's better

875
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:22,333
to get it all out on the table,

876
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:24,867
so later, there can be

877
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,833
no possibility of a
misunderstanding.

878
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:30,800
I don't know how many business
deals I've seen come to grief...

879
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:33,600
Okay...

880
00:54:33,633 --> 00:54:35,567
Okay.

881
00:54:40,367 --> 00:54:42,467
You're a real prick,
you know that?

882
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:50,733
Prick?

883
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:59,633
I could very easily get
serious about this girl.

884
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:02,367
She's a lot of fun to be with.

885
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,500
This is just between
the two of us,

886
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:09,600
but for the last year or so,

887
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:12,833
I've been having... I don't know,

888
00:55:12,867 --> 00:55:15,467
a little trouble.

889
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,533
I wasn't worried,

890
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:20,633
but still and all...

891
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:24,233
a little trouble with...

892
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:27,200
well, myself.

893
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:32,533
You know...

894
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:34,800
getting hard.

895
00:55:38,433 --> 00:55:40,967
It took a long time,
and you know how

896
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,233
girls are today, they judge you.

897
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:45,467
They judge you very quickly.

898
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,767
So...

899
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,367
I had a real rough time
a couple of times.

900
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,933
Some very nasty innuendos.

901
00:55:57,033 --> 00:55:59,267
And, as I say,

902
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,000
I wasn't too worried, but...

903
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:04,267
I won't lie to you,

904
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,400
I was a little worried.

905
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,533
Then along comes this Bobbie.

906
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:14,633
I get one look at the
size of the pair on her

907
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:16,467
and I never had a
doubt I'd ever be

908
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,533
anything but okay again,

909
00:56:18,567 --> 00:56:21,633
and I was, I was.

910
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:24,467
With all our kidding,

911
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,467
back and forth on our
first night together,

912
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,633
I don't mind telling you
I had tears in my eyes.

913
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,867
She's really the girl in
the airline commercial?

914
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,767
You lucky son of a bitch.

915
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,567
I don't know.

916
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,300
I don't want to get
in over my head.

917
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:45,767
I got in over my head
three, four times already,

918
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,367
and you have to be a real bastard.

919
00:56:52,733 --> 00:56:55,467
I don't like being put
in that position.

920
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,800
What would you do?

921
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,767
If she looks anything like
she looks on television...

922
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,233
Size 38, with a D cup.

923
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:10,967
But looks aren't everything.

924
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,867
Believe me, looks are everything.

925
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,333
Maybe.

926
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,567
I'm hungry.

927
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,500
I'll get up.

928
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:33,933
Why do we always
have to eat so late?

929
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:36,700
Because I work late, dumb-o.

930
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:39,633
Why do you work at all?

931
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:42,233
Brings in extra money.

932
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:45,333
I make enough.

933
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:47,900
You want me to quit working?

934
00:57:47,933 --> 00:57:49,767
I thought you were bored with it.

935
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,833
I am.

936
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:54,800
So quit.

937
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:57,567
What'll I do?

938
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,467
What do other women do?

939
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,433
Have children.

940
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:16,700

We're all out.

956
01:00:26,167 --> 01:00:29,933
I really wanted a beer.

I'm tired, but I don't mind.

I'll get it.

961

No, I'll get it.

962
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:45,800
It's my fault.

963
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,067
I knew I should have reminded you

964
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,767
when I called this afternoon.

965
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,033
I'm sorry, honey.

966
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:56,300
You're more tired now

967
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:59,233
than when you were working.

968
01:00:59,267 --> 01:01:02,900

01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,967
I mean, when you're
not telephoning?

972
01:01:12,533 --> 01:01:14,967
I'm not on the phone that much.

973
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,400
It took me 45 minutes

974
01:01:17,433 --> 01:01:19,467
to get through this afternoon.

975
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,967

01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,400
Is it a week?

989
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:30,267
It's funny.

990
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,367
Susan and I do all
the right things.

991
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,767
We undress in front of each other.

992
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,167
We spend 15 minutes on foreplay.

993
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,100
We experiment, do it
in different rooms.

994
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,033
It's a seven-room house.

995
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,367
We don't believe in
making a ritual of it.

996
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,333
We do it when we feel like it.

997
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:56,133
We don't feel we have to be
passionate all the time.

998
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:59,067
Sometimes it's even
more fun necking.

999
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:06,233
We're considerate of
each other's feelings.

1000
01:03:06,267 --> 01:03:08,867
I had a tendency...

1001
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,267
Men, I guess, have...
To be selfish.

1002
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,900
But I stopped. I
don't do that now.

1003
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:23,000
We try to be patient,

1004
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:26,767
and we are patient,
gentle with each other.

1005
01:03:36,267 --> 01:03:38,400
Maybe it's just not
meant to be enjoyable

1006
01:03:38,433 --> 01:03:40,467
with women you love.

1007
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:45,167
Sandy...

1008
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,233
do you want to get laid?

1009
01:03:49,933 --> 01:03:51,700
Please.

1010
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:04,200
Very nice.

1011
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:06,267
Very nice indeed.

1012
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,367
Indeed. Watch out.

1013
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,267
I almost had it.

1014
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,200
Sure, you almost had it.

1015
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:15,300
I almost had it. Right, Cindy?

1016
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:19,733
See that, Cindy?

1017
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:21,433
He was lucky.

1018
01:04:21,467 --> 01:04:23,400
That's all.

1019
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,200
Bastard, that was out.

1020
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:31,867
- Bullshit it was.
- Oh, bullshit.

1021
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,500
Let Cindy be the judge.

1022
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:35,133
We'll do it over, all right?

1023
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:37,167
All right. Fair's fair.

1024
01:04:40,933 --> 01:04:42,467
Deuce.

1025
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,067
You see that shot, Cindy?

1026
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,467
Now we got some tennis.

1027
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,100
Hey.

1028
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:05,033
Game.

1029
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,967
Luck.

1030
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,067
Luck, my ass. Whoo-hoo.

1031
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,133
You want to take me on, Cindy?

1032
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,067
It's my turn.

1033
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,300
Oh, come on, Bobbie,
you're so awful.

1034
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:20,267
You serve.

1035
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,200
Very nice.

1036
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:26,300
Hey, you play well.

1037
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:28,500
Hey, Sandy, will you
look at this girl?

1038
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:30,400
Terrific, Cindy.

1039
01:05:30,433 --> 01:05:32,867
Whoo. Hey.

1040
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,967
She's racking me up.
I'm not kidding.

1041
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,133
Look at this. She's racking me up.

1042
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,100
Beautiful.

1043
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,367
Boy, will you look at this?

1044
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,300
40-love.

1045
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,367
And I'm not taking it
easy on her either.

1046
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,367
You and Lord & Taylor's

1047
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,467
are gonna have to work
out a trial separation.

1048
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,333
I had the water running.
What did you say?

1049
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:30,433
You and Lord & Taylor's

1050
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:33,100
are going to have to work
out a trial separation.

1051
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,133
Look at the date.

1052
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:44,200
What do you mean?

1053
01:07:44,233 --> 01:07:45,967
Five months ago.

1054
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,433
I'm sorry I cost
you so much money.

1055
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:57,833
I want to get married.

1056
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,967
Are you tired of me, Jonathan?

1057
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,900
Am I ever.

1058
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:33,367
- The answer is yes.
- I didn't say yes.

1059
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,367
You said, "Am I ever."

1060
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,233
I need more in life than this.

1061
01:09:37,267 --> 01:09:39,467
Who put you up to this?
Your psychiatrist?

1062
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,533
After a long, exhaustive bed hunt,

1063
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:43,267
you finally chose me.

1064
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,767
Cindy's not a virgin either.

1065
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,733
What?

1066
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:50,500
Oh, I get it.

1067
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:52,467
Is that what brought this on?

1068
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,400
Your mind is unbelievable.

1069
01:09:54,433 --> 01:09:56,267
You have to have a
low opinion of me

1070
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,967
thinking that I would
do that to Sandy.

1071
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,267
Oh, no, you wouldn't
want to cheat on Sandy.

1072
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,800
Oh, now it's Sandy.

1073
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,733
Well, he spends half
his life over here.

1074
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,633
Wait a minute.

1075
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:09,267
A second ago you had
me screwing Cindy.

1076
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,000
Who am I screwing now, Sandy?

1077
01:10:11,033 --> 01:10:12,633
You're going too fast for me.

1078
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,900
I'm going too fast for you?

1079
01:10:14,933 --> 01:10:17,800
Your little mind operates like
an IBM, like a pinball machine.

1080
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,733
First Cindy. Oh, no, not Cindy?

1081
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:22,833
How about Sandy? How
about Cindy and Sandy?

1082
01:10:22,867 --> 01:10:25,433
Talk about the pot
calling the kettle.

1083
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:26,744
The day I got an earful of your

1084
01:10:26,745 --> 01:10:28,433
chequered past, I
felt like a celibate.

1085
01:10:28,467 --> 01:10:29,967
You made me tell you.

1086
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,667
Sure, I twisted your arm.

1087
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,433
It got you hot.

1088
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:34,967
Something has to.

1089
01:10:49,733 --> 01:10:52,467
You have such contempt for me.

1090
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,333
Kid, you worked hard for it.

1091
01:10:54,367 --> 01:10:56,267
It's yours.

1092
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,900
The way you paw me at parties.

1093
01:10:57,933 --> 01:11:01,000
Now affection is contempt.

1094
01:11:01,033 --> 01:11:05,000
Upside down. Everything
upside down.

1095
01:11:05,033 --> 01:11:07,833
Feeling me up in public
is not affection.

1096
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:09,400
Will you come on?

1097
01:11:09,433 --> 01:11:11,667
I know I sleep all day.

1098
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,733
I know I'm doing a terrible job,

1099
01:11:13,767 --> 01:11:15,600
but you're not helping me any.

1100
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:17,300
And who helps me?

1101
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:18,867
I help you.

1102
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,533
Your kind of help
I can do without.

1103
01:11:21,567 --> 01:11:24,333
Can you? Can you really?

1104
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:30,700
You'll do anything you can
to ruin my day, won't you?

1105
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:33,800
I got up today feeling so good.

1106
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:37,267
You couldn't leave us alone.

1107
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,533
- We were doing so well.
- What?

1108
01:11:40,567 --> 01:11:44,600
At one time... at one time,
it was great what we had.

1109
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,700
The kidding around. It can't
have a natural time span?

1110
01:11:47,733 --> 01:11:49,900
Affairs can't dissolve
in a good way.

1111
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:52,400
There's always got to be poison.

1112
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:55,367
I don't see why. I
really don't see why.

1113
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,767
Jonathan, do you want
it over between us?

1114
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,000
Why does it have to be
one way or the other?

1115
01:12:00,033 --> 01:12:01,867
You don't want me to leave?

1116
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,567
I want you right here
where you belong.

1117
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,567
And what about you?

1118
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,667
When I'm here, I'm here. When
I'm not here, I'm there.

1119
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,467
- Where?
- Wherever?

1120
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,567
No.

1121
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,500
I'm a man-eater or a
ball-buster and a castrator.

1122
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:17,867
I want to get married.

1123
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,600
All right, where the
fuck is my shoehorn?

1124
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,867
This place is a mess. There's
not any food in the house.

1125
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,400
Half the time, you look
like you fell out of bed.

1126
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:32,667
You spend more time in bed
than any other human being

1127
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,833
past the age of six months
than I ever heard of.

1128
01:12:34,867 --> 01:12:38,567
The reason I sleep all day is
because I can't stand my life.

1129
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,333
What life?

1130
01:12:40,367 --> 01:12:42,400
Sleeping all day.

1131
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:46,967
You say that sort of thing,

1132
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,633
I fall in love with
you all over again.

1133
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:52,767
Marry me, Jonathan.
Please, marry me.

1134
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,833
You're trying to kill me.

1135
01:12:54,867 --> 01:12:56,867
Marriage isn't death.

1136
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,233
Why now?

1137
01:12:59,267 --> 01:13:03,367
Because two years ago,
I slept eight hours.

1138
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,267
A year ago, it was 12.
It's up to 15 now.

1139
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,367
Pretty soon, it's gonna be 24.

1140
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,233
What are you trying
to do, scare me?

1141
01:13:10,267 --> 01:13:12,467
- I need a life.
- Get a job.

1142
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,500
I don't want a job. I want you.

1143
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:17,800
I'm taken, by me.

1144
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:19,867
Get out of the house.

1145
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,967
Do something useful, God damn it.

1146
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,433
You wouldn't let me
work when I wanted to.

1147
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:25,533
That was a year ago.

1148
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,367
You throw a tantrum every time
you call and I'm not home.

1149
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,533
Look, sister, I'm out
there in the jungle

1150
01:13:30,567 --> 01:13:32,633
eight hours a day.

1151
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:34,733
You wouldn't even let
me canvass for Kennedy.

1152
01:13:34,767 --> 01:13:36,500
You want a job?

1153
01:13:36,533 --> 01:13:39,267
I got a job for you.
Fix up this pigsty.

1154
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,567
You get a pretty
goddamn good salary

1155
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,633
for testing out this bed all day.

1156
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:45,300
You want an extra $50 a week?

1157
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:47,267
Try vacuuming.

1158
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,767
You want an extra 100?
Make this goddamn bed.

1159
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,800
Try opening some goddamn windows.

1160
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:53,700
That's why you can't
stand up in here.

1161
01:13:53,733 --> 01:13:56,533
The goddamn place
smells like a coffin.

1162
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,267
Oh... Bobbie.

1163
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,367
You don't need me.

1164
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,767
Why do you let yourself in
for this kind of abuse?

1165
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,533
Walk out.

1166
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:12,767
Leave me. Please leave me.

1167
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,600
God's sake, I'd almost marry
you if you'd leave me.

1168
01:14:15,633 --> 01:14:18,400
You call that abuse?

1169
01:14:18,433 --> 01:14:20,800
You don't know what I'm used to.

1170
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:23,400
With all your carrying on,

1171
01:14:23,433 --> 01:14:25,667
to me you're a gift.

1172
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,400
So what's it gonna be?

1173
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,600
You sure know how
to screw things up.

1174
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:41,267
So where does that leave us?

1175
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,833
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

1176
01:14:43,867 --> 01:14:47,333
Is this an ultimatum?

1177
01:14:47,367 --> 01:14:49,533
Answer me, you ball-busting,

1178
01:14:49,567 --> 01:14:51,400
castrating, son-of-a-cunt bitch.

1179
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:52,633
Is this an ultimatum or not?

1180
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,533
Because if it is,
I'm gonna tell you

1181
01:14:54,567 --> 01:14:56,333
what you can do with
your ultimatum.

1182
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:57,933
I'm gonna tell you what
you can do with it.

1183
01:14:57,967 --> 01:14:59,867
You can make this goddamn bed.

1184
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,833
That's what you can do with it.

1185
01:15:01,867 --> 01:15:03,900
Goddamn clean these filthy sheets.

1186
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,433
That's what you can do with it.

1187
01:15:09,733 --> 01:15:12,400
She's not ready.

1188
01:15:12,433 --> 01:15:15,500
We're a little early.

1189
01:15:15,533 --> 01:15:17,400
You're looking good, Cindy.

1190
01:15:17,433 --> 01:15:18,900
I do my best.

1191
01:15:18,933 --> 01:15:20,833
Will Bobbie be long?

1192
01:15:20,867 --> 01:15:22,600
No.

1193
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,767
Hey...

1194
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,900
do we have to go to this party?

1195
01:15:30,933 --> 01:15:32,967
How about it, Cindy?

1196
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,667
Where's the powder room?

1197
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,300
Right there.

1198
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:38,367
I'm going. You do what you want.

1199
01:15:46,967 --> 01:15:50,400
Man, she's really something.

1200
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,233
I'm so bored, I'm
going out of my mind.

1201
01:15:55,267 --> 01:15:57,300
Bored? With that?

1202
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:58,867
You must be kidding.

1203
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,900
You have to go to this party?

1204
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:09,300
Stick around.

1205
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:12,300
No, it's better that I go.

1206
01:16:20,933 --> 01:16:22,867
Hey, I just did my hair.

1207
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,900
I've got this at home.

1208
01:16:30,933 --> 01:16:34,000
How's your tennis game, Jonathan?

1209
01:16:34,033 --> 01:16:36,767
We'll have to have a rematch.

1210
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,533
Anytime.

1211
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:55,000
Is she always that way?

1212
01:16:55,033 --> 01:16:56,900
You know women.

1213
01:16:56,933 --> 01:16:58,933
Boy, is she competitive.

1214
01:16:58,967 --> 01:17:01,733
She is very competitive,

1215
01:17:01,767 --> 01:17:03,500
but I find that attractive.

1216
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:07,633
You know her problem?

1217
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,233
She wants balls.

1218
01:17:11,267 --> 01:17:12,767
She's all right.

1219
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,833
I'm not criticising.

1220
01:17:14,867 --> 01:17:17,600
I wish she were more feminine.

1221
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,833
She is a little masculine.

1222
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:23,467
I just wish she wouldn't
always demand her own way.

1223
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,900
She's got a great body on her.

1224
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:28,967
I have to treat her like a child,

1225
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,600
give her everything she wants.

1226
01:17:31,633 --> 01:17:33,667
I wouldn't mind
giving her something.

1227
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,800
You got Bobbie.

1228
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,467
I should only have it that good.

1229
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,433
Bobbie.

1230
01:17:41,467 --> 01:17:43,500
Bobbie, are you kidding?

1231
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:46,467
I've never seen a body like that.

1232
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,733
She could do with a little
more of what Cindy's got.

1233
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:53,867
She's so goddamn passive.

1234
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:58,333
Yeah, I wouldn't mind Cindy
just lying still once.

1235
01:17:58,367 --> 01:18:01,267
She's so busy handing out
instructions in bed.

1236
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,367
It's like close-order drill.

1237
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,600
Yeah, I wouldn't mind
a little of that,

1238
01:18:06,633 --> 01:18:10,233
as long as she doesn't
forget who's boss.

1239
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:18,467
Hey...

1240
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,300
you wouldn't want to swap
sometime, would you?

1241
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,500
Are you serious?

1242
01:18:29,533 --> 01:18:31,567
What do you say?

1243
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,667
Might liven things up a bit.

1244
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:43,267
She can miss one party.
Leave her to me.

1245
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,000
What about Bobbie?

1246
01:18:45,033 --> 01:18:46,767
She's so mad at me,

1247
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,500
she'll jump all over
you just for revenge.

1248
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:52,400
Hey, you like that, huh?

1249
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:54,833
Seriously?

1250
01:18:54,867 --> 01:18:58,333
She's in the bedroom.

1251
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:01,267
If you're quiet, you can do it

1252
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,333
and she won't even know.

1253
01:19:03,367 --> 01:19:05,900
You bastard.

1254
01:19:10,367 --> 01:19:12,300
Give me a minute.

1255
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,367
Tell Sandy it's time to leave.

1256
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:00,900
I hope you dance better
than you play tennis.

1257
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:43,467
Sandy won't mind.

1258
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,000
What's Sandy got to do with it?

1259
01:20:46,033 --> 01:20:48,333
You're his girl.

1260
01:20:57,633 --> 01:20:59,867
He said it would be okay.

1261
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,967
What did Sandy say?

1262
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,300
That you and me...

1263
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,700
you know.

1264
01:21:22,533 --> 01:21:25,600
That was his idea. You had
nothing to do with it?

1265
01:21:25,633 --> 01:21:27,833
A little.

1266
01:21:27,867 --> 01:21:30,733
A little or a lot?

1267
01:21:30,767 --> 01:21:33,000
This much.

1268
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:36,433
I'm surprised it took you this
long to get around to it.

1269
01:21:41,733 --> 01:21:43,900
Sandy and I have a party to go to.

1270
01:21:43,933 --> 01:21:46,367
Sandy's busy.

1271
01:22:13,367 --> 01:22:16,233
You wanna come around
sometime by yourself,

1272
01:22:16,267 --> 01:22:18,300
that's one thing.

1273
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,700
I've been expecting that.

1274
01:22:20,733 --> 01:22:22,767
But you tell Sandy

1275
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,700
that if he lays one hand

1276
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:28,267
on that tub of lard in there,

1277
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,233
not to come home.

1278
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,933
So you call me.

1279
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,533
Jesus.

1280
01:23:20,033 --> 01:23:22,800
She's semi-comatose.

1281
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:25,900
Better send a resuscitation
unit and an airway.

1282
01:23:25,933 --> 01:23:28,800
Be ready to give her
an IV on admission.

1283
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,867
It's on...

1284
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,633
Tell him we'll put her
in intensive care.

1285
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,333
Bastard.

1286
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:05,500
Very slick.

1287
01:24:05,533 --> 01:24:08,667
Very clever.

1288
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:11,567
Well, it's not going
to work, Bobbie.

1289
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:40,200
That's Bonnie,

1290
01:24:40,233 --> 01:24:42,467
my first love.

1291
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,067
She lived upstairs from us.

1292
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,500
We started exposing ourselves
to each other at 10.

1293
01:24:48,533 --> 01:24:51,233
We got caught on the roof
one day by my mother

1294
01:24:51,267 --> 01:24:53,867
who washed my mouth out with soap.

1295
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:56,333
I never got the connection.

1296
01:24:56,367 --> 01:24:59,433
Here's Emily, my first steady.

1297
01:24:59,467 --> 01:25:02,000
Until she moved off
the block at 11,

1298
01:25:02,033 --> 01:25:03,733
I never laid a hand on her.

1299
01:25:03,767 --> 01:25:07,033
Mildred,

1300
01:25:07,067 --> 01:25:09,433
I think, this one's name was.

1301
01:25:09,467 --> 01:25:11,867
She followed me around at school.

1302
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,467
The fellas kidded me about her.

1303
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,200
I warned her if she didn't
stop, I'd beat her up.

1304
01:25:17,233 --> 01:25:19,433
She picked up her skirt,
dropped her drawers

1305
01:25:19,467 --> 01:25:21,500
and shoved her ass at me.

1306
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,833
So I got my first
sight of ass at 12.

1307
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,467
Marcia, 13 1/2 or thereabouts,

1308
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,167
I kissed her one night at
a spin-the-bottle party.

1309
01:25:34,767 --> 01:25:37,367
This one's Rosalie.

1310
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:41,267
Rosalie looked just like Elizabeth
Taylor in "National Velvet."

1311
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:44,900
I had a crush on
Rosalie from 14 to 15

1312
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:47,000
and I never went near her.

1313
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:49,100
In those days, we had illusions.

1314
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,467
Here's Charlotte.

1315
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,767
Not much on looks, but
great tits for 15.

1316
01:25:57,367 --> 01:26:00,267
That's Lenny Hartman's sister.

1317
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:03,000
My first French kiss,

1318
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:04,933
16 years old.

1319
01:26:04,967 --> 01:26:06,833
Here's Gloria,

1320
01:26:06,867 --> 01:26:09,400
the best-built girl
at Evander Childs.

1321
01:26:09,433 --> 01:26:11,467
I took her to the Bronx Zoo once

1322
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,833
and on the bus,
copped a cheap feel.

1323
01:26:14,867 --> 01:26:16,367
Here's Gwen.

1324
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,300
I went with her for a year

1325
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:19,767
trying to get her to put out,

1326
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,367
but she thought I was too nice

1327
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,433
and was saving me for marriage.

1328
01:26:23,467 --> 01:26:25,267
Every guy at Evander

1329
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:28,033
must have gotten into
her pants except me.

1330
01:26:28,067 --> 01:26:30,933
Here's my first... No,
that one was a mistake.

1331
01:26:30,967 --> 01:26:34,333
Here's Eileen, my very first fuck.

1332
01:26:34,367 --> 01:26:37,433
She was a modern
dancer at Swarthmore.

1333
01:26:37,467 --> 01:26:39,167
Great body on her.

1334
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,100
What a waste... frigid.

1335
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:45,400
Here's Nancy. Sweet kid.

1336
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:48,100
She went into
biology. Very frigid.

1337
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,867
Here's Bobbie.

1338
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,767
My wife.

1339
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,000
The fastest tits in the West

1340
01:26:57,033 --> 01:26:59,233
and king of the ball-busters.

1341
01:26:59,267 --> 01:27:01,300
She conned me into marrying her

1342
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:03,067
and now she's killing
me with alimony.

1343
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,100
Don't know how this
one get in here?

1344
01:27:08,133 --> 01:27:10,400
This is my little girl, Wendy.

1345
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:12,467
"Princess," I call her.

1346
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,133
Isn't she a dreamboat?

1347
01:27:16,367 --> 01:27:18,400
Here's a real cunt.

1348
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:20,467
I forget her name.

1349
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,367
A Nazi.

1350
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,800
I banged her in Berlin.

1351
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,433
Here's something I went with

1352
01:27:26,467 --> 01:27:28,367
for a couple of months.

1353
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,100
First time I banged her

1354
01:27:30,133 --> 01:27:32,933
was on a yacht race to Nassau.

1355
01:27:32,967 --> 01:27:35,500
This slob I went with for a year

1356
01:27:35,533 --> 01:27:38,100
until I got so sick
of her ball-busting,

1357
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:40,733
I couldn't get it up anymore.

1358
01:27:40,767 --> 01:27:42,367
I can't remember her name.

1359
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,267
This was my Jap in the sack.

1360
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:50,733
I heard that Oriental
girls were different.

1361
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:52,200
Not in America, they're not.

1362
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:57,900
Here's a 16-year-old
I gave 20 bucks to

1363
01:27:57,933 --> 01:28:00,333
one night in the village
when I was drunk.

1364
01:28:00,367 --> 01:28:03,067
Maybe you know her, Jennifer.
She gave me a dose.

1365
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,967
That's all, folks.

1366
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:16,900
What are you crying for?

1367
01:28:16,933 --> 01:28:18,467
It's not a Lassie movie.

1368
01:29:37,233 --> 01:29:39,933
Sorry about that.

1369
01:29:39,967 --> 01:29:42,733
Or something.

1370
01:29:42,767 --> 01:29:46,167
So, what else is new?

1371
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,233
To tell you the truth,

1372
01:29:48,267 --> 01:29:51,000
I don't see anybody anymore.

1373
01:29:51,033 --> 01:29:53,067
Neither do we.

1374
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:56,167
Well, you've got each other.

1375
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,767
I thought she was your daughter

1376
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,467
when you first came in.

1377
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,067
In a lot of ways, she's
older than I am.

1378
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,967
Yeah.

1379
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,233
She knows worlds I can't
even begin to touch yet.

1380
01:30:08,267 --> 01:30:10,467
Sandy, please.

1381
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,733
I found out who I am.

1382
01:30:12,767 --> 01:30:14,800
You're in big trouble.

1383
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:17,033
Same old Jonathan.

1384
01:30:17,067 --> 01:30:19,100
Indubitably.

1385
01:30:19,133 --> 01:30:21,333
Let me talk to her
about you, John.

1386
01:30:21,367 --> 01:30:23,400
Talk to her about me?

1387
01:30:23,433 --> 01:30:26,033
I'm 40, she's nine.

1388
01:30:26,067 --> 01:30:28,100
You just don't get it, do you?

1389
01:30:28,133 --> 01:30:30,000
Oh, I get it, all right.

1390
01:30:30,033 --> 01:30:33,067
I've been getting it for a
long time. What's the point?

1391
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,467
Sandy, you found a
good piece of ass.

1392
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,400
God bless you.

1393
01:30:37,433 --> 01:30:39,467
You're my friend,
I'm happy for you.

1394
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,033
As long as it lasts,
I'm happy for you.

1395
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:44,100
You deserve to be
happy. I mean it.

1396
01:30:44,133 --> 01:30:46,167
Why fight? Okay?

1397
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,233
All those games.

1398
01:30:48,267 --> 01:30:50,233
Jesus Christ.

1399
01:30:50,267 --> 01:30:52,300
You don't need those
games, Jonathan.

1400
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:54,167
I know. I've played
more games than anyone.

1401
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,133
The obedient son game.

1402
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:57,500
The bright student game.

1403
01:30:57,533 --> 01:30:59,400
- The cocksman's game.
- Some cocksman.

1404
01:30:59,433 --> 01:31:01,100
The respectable husband game.

1405
01:31:01,133 --> 01:31:03,033
The good father game.

1406
01:31:03,067 --> 01:31:04,767
- The specialist game.
- Good father?

1407
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,833
Games don't impress Jennifer.

1408
01:31:06,867 --> 01:31:08,900
Just life, just love.

1409
01:31:08,933 --> 01:31:10,800
Yeah, well, I don't want

1410
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:12,900
to argue with you, Sandy.

1411
01:31:12,933 --> 01:31:15,267
So let's just agree
to disagree, okay?

1412
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,500
Don't make me mad, okay?

1413
01:31:17,533 --> 01:31:20,133
Jennifer knows more at 18

1414
01:31:20,167 --> 01:31:22,333
than Susan knows to this day.

1415
01:31:22,367 --> 01:31:25,433
You found yourself a
real jewel, okay?

1416
01:31:25,467 --> 01:31:27,500
She's my love teacher.

1417
01:31:27,533 --> 01:31:29,933
Finally got it up, huh?

1418
01:31:29,967 --> 01:31:33,033
You give off such bad vibrations.

1419
01:31:33,067 --> 01:31:35,133
Bad vibrations?

1420
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:38,033
Sandy, I love you, but
you're a schmuck.

1421
01:31:38,067 --> 01:31:41,833
You were always
young, Sandy, open.

1422
01:31:41,867 --> 01:31:43,900
You were schmucky a
lot of the time,

1423
01:31:43,933 --> 01:31:45,967
but maybe schmuckiness
is what you need

1424
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,867
to stay young and open.

1425
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,933
Listen... don't listen to me.

1426
01:31:49,967 --> 01:31:52,867
You're doing great,
and I'm making money.

1427
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:55,300
You can find what I
found, Jonathan.

1428
01:31:57,533 --> 01:31:59,833
Don't make me insult you.

1429
01:32:17,033 --> 01:32:18,967
Women...

1430
01:32:24,467 --> 01:32:27,533
All ball-busters, right?

1431
01:32:27,567 --> 01:32:29,633
You know it.

1432
01:32:29,667 --> 01:32:33,267
When you think of some of the
things he has to dip into,

1433
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,500
any guy with a conscience
has a right to turn soft.

1434
01:32:36,533 --> 01:32:38,767
Am I right, Louise?

1435
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,367
You're always right, lover.

1436
01:33:10,367 --> 01:33:12,000
I don't think we're going to have

1437
01:33:12,033 --> 01:33:14,300
any trouble tonight.

1438
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:17,533
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

1439
01:33:17,567 --> 01:33:19,233
Are you sure?

1440
01:33:19,267 --> 01:33:20,933
You wanna bet?

1441
01:33:20,967 --> 01:33:23,733
How much?

1442
01:33:23,767 --> 01:33:25,433
The sky's the limit.

1443
01:33:25,467 --> 01:33:27,433
God damn it.

1444
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,733
What did I do?

1445
01:33:31,767 --> 01:33:33,800
You're doing it all wrong.

1446
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:35,533
I'm doing it like always.

1447
01:33:35,567 --> 01:33:37,467
You never said that before.

1448
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,633
- Said what?
- "Sky's the limit."

1449
01:33:39,667 --> 01:33:41,433
Sure, I...

1450
01:33:41,467 --> 01:33:42,933
Never.

1451
01:33:42,967 --> 01:33:44,900
What do I say?

1452
01:33:49,467 --> 01:33:51,200
You forgot, didn't you?

1453
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:58,233
A hundred.

1454
01:33:58,267 --> 01:33:59,833
I say a hundred.

1455
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,400
Okay.

1456
01:34:18,933 --> 01:34:21,367
It just came out.

1457
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,600
I just want it right, that's all.

1458
01:34:38,633 --> 01:34:40,800
I don't think we're going to have

1459
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:43,400
any trouble tonight.

1460
01:34:43,433 --> 01:34:46,467
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

1461
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,533
Are you sure?

1462
01:34:48,567 --> 01:34:50,967
You wanna bet?

1463
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,400
How much?

1464
01:34:53,433 --> 01:34:55,333
A hundred?

1465
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:10,967
You sound pretty sure.

1466
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,733
You're a kind of man...

1467
01:35:13,767 --> 01:35:15,500
why shouldn't I be sure?

1468
01:35:17,367 --> 01:35:19,733
What kind of man am I?

1469
01:35:23,033 --> 01:35:25,967
A real man.

1470
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,767
A kind man.

1471
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,600
I'm not kind.

1472
01:35:30,633 --> 01:35:33,700
I don't mean weak kind,

1473
01:35:33,733 --> 01:35:36,467
the way so many men are.

1474
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,533
I mean the kindness that comes

1475
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:40,967
from an enormous strength,

1476
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,300
from an inner power so
strong that every act,

1477
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:47,733
no matter what, is more
proof of that power.

1478
01:35:47,767 --> 01:35:50,300
That's what all women resent.

1479
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:52,667
That's why they try
to cut you down.

1480
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:55,233
Because your knowledge
of yourself and them

1481
01:35:55,267 --> 01:35:58,333
is so right, so true

1482
01:35:58,367 --> 01:36:01,500
that it exposes the
lies which they,

1483
01:36:01,533 --> 01:36:04,300
every scheming one
of them, live by.

1484
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:06,867
It takes a true
woman to understand

1485
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:08,933
that the purest form of love

1486
01:36:08,967 --> 01:36:12,333
is to love a man who
denies himself to her.

1487
01:36:12,367 --> 01:36:15,767
A man who inspires worship,

1488
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,900
because he has no
need for any woman,

1489
01:36:19,933 --> 01:36:22,000
because he has himself.

1490
01:36:22,033 --> 01:36:26,333
And who is better, more beautiful,

1491
01:36:26,367 --> 01:36:28,700
more powerful, more perfect.

1492
01:36:28,733 --> 01:36:30,600
You're getting hard.

1493
01:36:30,633 --> 01:36:34,433
More strong, more masculine,

1494
01:36:34,467 --> 01:36:38,367
more extraordinary, more robust...

1495
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,800
It's rising.

1496
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:42,700
It's rising.

1497
01:36:42,733 --> 01:36:45,467
More virile, domineering.

1498
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:49,433
More irresistible...

1499
01:36:49,467 --> 01:36:52,500
It's up...

1500
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:55,300
in the air.
