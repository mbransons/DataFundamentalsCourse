1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:50,953
This is the story of a squad of marines,
a rifle squad.

3
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,711
I'm Corporal Robert Dunne,
a member of that squad.

4
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:58,470
We were at Guadalcanal,
and when it was secure

5
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,508
we were pulled out for rest, refitting,
replacements and retraining.

6
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:07,786
The Marine Corps is long on training
and retraining...

7
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:09,825
Let that go.

8
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:13,984
After the canal, we were sent to
Camp Paekakariki in New Zealand.

9
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:18,542
Here we received our replacements,
marines from Stateside,

10
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:23,300
a long way from Stateside, 8,000 miles.

11
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:30,258
I can see you're a man
who knows how to live.

12
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,457
- Solid comfort.
- Solid malaria.

13
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:37,575
- Malaria, huh? Contagious?
- No, not this week. You can stay.

14
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:42,134
Nice place you got here.
Regazzi's my name, Benny Regazzi.

15
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,494
Bob Dunne. I'm duty NCO today.

16
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:48,651
Great. Meet my friends. This big guy
is "Handsome" Dan Shipley.

17
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,811
- Hi.
- What a physique!

18
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:55,689
The girls see him and faint. He comes
through this, I'll make him a movie star!

19
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:59,008
Those two guys, Flynns.
That's Eddie and that's Frank.

20
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,167
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hello, Bob.

21
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,806
They don't drink. I got their beer ration.

22
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:07,045
- And Georgie Hellenopolis, an Irishman.
- Hello, sport.

23
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:10,524
- Where did you get those cards?
- Off your sack on the ship. Why?

24
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:15,042
- They're mine, that's why.
- I've seen lots in those bags that aren't.

25
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:18,001
- Come on, give me.
- "Semper fi", Mac.

26
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:22,239
- Hey!
- Leave them. It happens 20 times a day.

27
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,077
You know where those guys come from?
Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.

28
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:36,674
- By the way, who's the squad leader?
- Sergeant Stryker.

29
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,833
- What's he like?
- You'll find out.

30
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:42,233
I've been in New Zealand two hours
and already they're clamming up on me.

31
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,148
- I hope he knows his stuff.
- Maybe we'll get liberty.

32
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:57,147
- We ain't replacements any more.
- Where is he? Where's the sergeant?

33
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:59,307
He's here.

34
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,944
- Well, what do you know? Stryker.
- Hello, Thomas.

35
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:07,783
- Thought you were in the First.
- I was. Sit down.

36
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:10,143
Just sit down, Thomas, anywhere.

37
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:19,499
My name is Stryker,
Sergeant John M Stryker.

38
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,498
You're gonna be my squad, a rifle squad.

39
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:27,296
Three of us have seen action: Corporal
Dunne, Charlie Bass and myself.

40
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:31,456
You'll learn from us. In boot camp
you learned out of a book.

41
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:37,333
Here you gotta remember the book and
learn things that haven't been printed.

42
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:39,492
You gotta learn right and fast.

43
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:46,609
Any man that doesn't want to cooperate,
I'll make him wish he hadn't been born.

44
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,367
Before I'm through with you, you're
gonna move and think like one man.

45
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:56,406
If you don't, you'll be dead.
You guys have had a nice easy day.

46
00:04:56,605 --> 00:05:01,724
I hope you enjoyed it because
it's the last one you'll get for a long time.

47
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:06,283
You joined the Marines to fight and
you'll get your chance. I'll show you how.

48
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:10,881
If I can't teach you one way, I'll teach you
another. But I'll get the job done.

49
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:14,080
The skipper of this outfit
is Captain Joyce.

50
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,798
Platoon leader is Lieutenant Baker.
Platoon sergeant is Sergeant Wright.

51
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:20,956
Any questions?

52
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:24,276
That's all.

53
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,433
10,000 sergeants in this corps
and I draw Stryker!

54
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,672
You knew this guy before?

55
00:05:34,712 --> 00:05:38,151
Yeah. We were stationed
together in China.

56
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:41,869
Twice he kept me from promotion.
Turned me in once.

57
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,668
30 days I got.
He was a sergeant major then.

58
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:50,986
Must have done something to get busted
to three stripes.

59
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:53,745
What did he turn you in for?

60
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:59,503
For... That's not important!
What's important is that he turned me in!

61
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:04,102
Maybe he didn't write the manual, but
you can bet he can recite it backwards!

62
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:11,138
- It's probably tattooed on his chest.
- Front and back, Mac.

63
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,738
- Say, isn't your name Al Thomas?
- Yeah.

64
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:17,897
- Weren't you a fighter?
- Just in the Marines.

65
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:23,695
- Runner-up in the heavyweight division.
- Tell him who you were runner-up to.

66
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:27,173
Stryker. Lucky punch.

67
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:29,812
Meet your new manager.

68
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:33,491
Tell him why you lost your stripes.

69
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:39,129
My natural dislike for you is
gradually developing into a great hate.

70
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:43,888
Don't let this guy do your thinking.
You'll get a square deal from Stryker.

71
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:46,126
You bet. Square deal.

72
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:51,884
I'm looking forward to the first time
he and I come head to head off duty.

73
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:55,643
Hey, take it easy
with that hand, champ!

74
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:00,322
Saddle up!

75
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:50,743
- All right, take a break.
- Take a break.

76
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:59,500
- How does your squad look?
- See me in about six months. Conway!

77
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:09,417
I was checking the records.
Your father was Colonel Sam Conway.

78
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:14,694
- What if he was?
- I was with him ten months ago.

79
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,733
He was my CO before he got killed.

80
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:22,251
One of the best officers and finest men
I ever served under.

81
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:26,011
- I thought if you...
- Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.

82
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:36,767
- For that, you sleep with your rifle.
- It was an accident.

83
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:40,126
- Nobody in this outfit drops their rifle.
- Fall in!

84
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:43,564
All right, saddle up. Pick it up.

85
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:48,603
Sometimes I don't know
which I hate worse, him or the Nips.

86
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:56,919
- Your father was a good marine.
- Until ten months ago.

87
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:02,358
- You shipped in when he was killed.
- I shipped in because I was expected to.

88
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:06,236
In war the men of my family
join the Marines.

89
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:09,275
I'm the last Conway, so here I am.

90
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:13,074
He'd be proud that
you're carrying on the tradition.

91
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:17,553
Not my father. He'd have expected me
to find some soft duty somewhere.

92
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:21,231
- In fact, he told me so.
- I don't get it.

93
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:26,230
I embarrassed my father. I wasn't
tough enough for him. Too soft.

94
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:31,746
"No guts" was the phrase he used.
He wanted me to be like Stryker.

95
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:37,865
"The finest man I ever served under."
I bet they got along just fine.

96
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:43,423
Both with ramrods strapped on their
backs. I'm a civilian, not a marine.

97
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:47,622
They're not going to strap one on mine.
I'm in here strictly for tradition.

98
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,660
- That the only reason?
- Yeah. Why?

99
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,539
Nothing... Stryker knows his business.

100
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:56,898
So did Jack the Ripper.

101
00:09:57,099 --> 00:10:00,938
Knock off the skylarking.
You're in the wrong column.

102
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:08,254
Left foot close in there.

103
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:10,133
Look alive!

104
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:26,408
Choynski, you're all left feet!

105
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:30,487
Choynski! What do you think
you're doing?

106
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:34,245
- Running the bayonet course, sir.
- Not in this league.

107
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:36,404
Yes, sir.

108
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,162
Your men are pretty ragged, Stryker.

109
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:44,321
Yes, sir.

110
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:50,279
That ought to take some starch
out of Stryker. His boys didn't do so well.

111
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:53,958
Hanging him up between those poles,
we'd do a lot better.

112
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:58,356
Choynski!

113
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:00,955
OK, so I'm left-handed.

114
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:04,114
- On guard. Give me your rifle.
- What is this?

115
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:08,832
You can't learn the easy way, you'll learn
the hard way. Make a thrust.

116
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:12,311
- Without a scabbard?
- You heard me.

117
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:16,909
- You mean this way?
- Yeah, like this!

118
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:23,028
You get the idea? Corpsman!

119
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:28,705
All right, saddle up.
We'll do it again. Pick it up.

120
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:39,582
You're the only unkissable guy in camp.

121
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:45,739
This thing hurts. It ain't funny. No dame's
going to come near a mouth like this.

122
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:49,858
Don't worry, I got the scoop.
No liberty for three months. You got time.

123
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:54,576
- Three months? How did you get that?
- I got spies everywhere.

124
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:58,295
They ought to throw the book at Stryker
for doing this.

125
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:02,533
They won't. They'll give him a citation
for teaching us to be good marines.

126
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,013
Choynski!

127
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,890
They tell me you're going to live.
You were lucky today.

128
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,448
Someone had been instructing you that
didn't like you, you might not have been.

129
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:21,447
You better put in a little homework
on that bayonet course.

130
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:28,084
Somebody who didn't like me? I wonder
what he does to the guys he hates.

131
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:35,081
365 days in a year and
I gotta pick this one to nick myself!

132
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:37,321
You need a blow torch on your stubble.

133
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:40,920
Look who's putting out the scuttlebutt.
No liberty, he says!

134
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:44,079
Somebody made a mistake.
You got no kick coming.

135
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,556
You have, so don't go turning your back.

136
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:54,635
Will we take Hollywood
with them physiques!

137
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:58,953
- First Platoon!
- That's for me!

138
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:05,071
- Here, Wright, any mail for Stryker?
- No.

139
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:07,350
It's going to be rugged again tonight.

140
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:10,509
He won't solve his problems
with whiskey.

141
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:13,668
What would you do
if your wife left with your kid?

142
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:17,827
- After five years I'd forget it.
- Stryker's not much on forgetting.

143
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,423
- Sorry, no letter for you.
- I know it.

144
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:33,500
You know ten-year-olds. There could be
a thousand reasons why he didn't write.

145
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:35,819
- A million.
- Cut it out.

146
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,739
- Cut what out?
- Brushing me. The kid's all right.

147
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:43,977
- Maybe Mary influenced him not to.
- That she wouldn't do.

148
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:46,775
Of course not.

149
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:50,614
Stryker, you're a very unusual character.

150
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:53,773
- Can this be love?
- You know what I mean.

151
00:13:53,974 --> 00:14:00,771
A lot of guys wouldn't see that a woman
needs a husband who's not always away.

152
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:05,929
A woman wants a home and a guy
to come in and out on time every day.

153
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,607
- You can tell me to shut up.
- If you can't talk to me, who can?

154
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:14,366
- Don't do it, just for once, don't do it.
- Do what?

155
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:19,284
Don't start out to get blind, staggering,
stinking, falling down drunk.

156
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:23,443
Nobody starts out to get blind,
staggering, stinking, falling down drunk.

157
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:26,601
Some do. Why not leave
half your dough with me?

158
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:30,520
You got an old maid's failings. You worry.

159
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,718
Don't try to follow me tonight or I'll put
a dent in that ugly head of yours.

160
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:39,716
- Ready?
- Just a minute.

161
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,277
- What's up?
- Nothing.

162
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:45,754
Benny didn't strip his M1 fast enough
for Stryker, so he turned him in.

163
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:48,114
They cancelled his liberty.

164
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:54,511
Perhaps our sergeant hasn't got a heart
of gold after all, but he certainly is...

165
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:59,950
You talk too much. You think I restricted
Flynn for my own amusement?

166
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:06,108
The punishment's unreasonable,
to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake.

167
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:11,146
I'm gonna tell you something, Conway.
I'm gonna tell all of you.

168
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:14,984
I'm gonna make it simple
so you'll all understand it.

169
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:19,063
They handed me you guys as a present,
a regular Easter basket.

170
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:23,501
They told me to get you into shape
so you can handle a piece of this war.

171
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:30,140
That's what I'm gonna do and that means
I'm gonna tell you what to do every day,

172
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,017
how to button your buttons
and when to blow your noses.

173
00:15:34,217 --> 00:15:39,736
If you do something I don't like I'm gonna
jump and when I land it'll hurt.

174
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:46,613
I'll ride you until you can't stand up.
When you do, you'll be marines.

175
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,572
Flynn stays here.

176
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:57,290
Extra-hard product of a hard school.
Tough luck, Flynn.

177
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,528
- If my brother doesn't go, I'm not going.
- Shut up!

178
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:03,127
- Who are you telling to shut up?
- You!

179
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:08,284
Let's go before we all lose our liberty.
I wanna see those Wellington babes.

180
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:35,235
- How do you feel, boy?
- Like a little bird with feathers on it.

181
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:40,393
- Don't fly away, little bird.
- I can't. I'm still in the egg.

182
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:45,952
Beautiful, beautiful! I wanna dance.

183
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:48,272
You're gonna sit down.

184
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,589
Yes, ma'am, Tennessee,
that's where I come from.

185
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,947
The greatest state in the Union.
They call it the volunteer state.

186
00:16:57,148 --> 00:17:03,306
Right there is where I'm from.
Smithville, Tennessee, what a town!

187
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:08,584
These are all my cousins on my mama's
side and these are on my papa's side.

188
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:11,463
We got the best tobacco there is, too.

189
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:17,341
More fertiliser comes from Tennessee
than any other place in the world.

190
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,059
Listen to that band! Zombies!
They're all dead.

191
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:26,217
- Maybe they like music that way here.
- Or don't know any other kind.

192
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:31,175
- I'm talking these boys into a session.
- Maybe they don't have it in them.

193
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,814
After I'm through, they will.
They're breaking my heart.

194
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:37,973
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!

195
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,408
- There is a happy man.
- Wait until tomorrow.

196
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:57,606
- Don't be a killjoy, dance. I'll watch him.
- I'm not much on dancing.

197
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:01,365
- You might try just this once.
- No, thanks.

198
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:39,591
- Pete's my name, Pete Conway.
- Allison.

199
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,270
- Hello, Allison.
- Hello, Pete.

200
00:18:58,024 --> 00:19:03,223
- You're warm. Want to sit down?
- No. I don't want to lose you.

201
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:06,381
- Cutting in.
- Shove off, Mac.

202
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:47,527
What would you say if I suggested
we get some air?

203
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:53,444
I'd say I'm not supposed to leave the club
with servicemen, but to you I'd say yes.

204
00:19:57,203 --> 00:20:00,363
Now what?
We know all about each other.

205
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:05,561
- You'll be missing your train.
- I'll float back on thin air.

206
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,519
Don't do that. You might catch cold.

207
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,678
Funny, I've just met you and I feel
I've known you all my life.

208
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,396
I feel that way, too.

209
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:19,116
- Ten thousand miles away.
- Not now.

210
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:22,354
I wanna see you again,
every time I get liberty.

211
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,912
I'll be here.

212
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:29,911
- Allison...
- Yes?

213
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:32,951
...l'm glad I met you tonight.

214
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:47,305
- The train...
- I know.

215
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:51,584
I'll walk you to the station.
I can get a taxi from there.

216
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,103
- No, I'll walk you home.
- No.

217
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:58,382
You might miss your train.
I might not see you again for a long time.

218
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:06,739
Any time I get liberty, she says, just call
her up. Man, what a barmaid!

219
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:12,136
- I'll finish the war right here.
- Drink any more and you probably will!

220
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:18,255
New Zealand ain't got rats because
they killed them all with that whiskey!

221
00:21:18,454 --> 00:21:21,014
We'll drink worse before we get through.

222
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:26,012
They may bury me at sea tomorrow,
but tonight I got that nice, warm feeling.

223
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:29,331
I got a great future
for the next two hours.

224
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,170
You're bleeding!

225
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:33,689
Lipstick!

226
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:36,807
- Hey, fellas, look what I found!
- Hey, sports...

227
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,887
...look.

228
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:44,965
- Boy, he's really carrying a load!
- Gyrene!

229
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:49,803
Hey, Mac, you're a little off your course.

230
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:55,681
- Well, what do you know! Stryker.
- He's sure a mess.

231
00:21:55,881 --> 00:22:00,279
Now I know what happened
to those stripes. Come on.

232
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:07,916
Shore Patrol.

233
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:12,235
- That's what it is. Give me a hand.
- You're going to help him?

234
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:17,194
If he cut my mother's throat five minutes
ago, I wouldn't let them get him.

235
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:22,511
What a break! He's all set to drop two
stripes and Shore Patrol shows up.

236
00:22:22,712 --> 00:22:28,430
- But look what he done to me!
- Don't tell me he kissed you.

237
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:30,308
That's a great one!

238
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:35,307
Did I tell you about the guy on a train
and the funniest thing happened...

239
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:39,945
- I don't know why you're helping him.
- I'll take care of it.

240
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:44,264
- Where did you come from?
- Never mind. He don't need you guys.

241
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:48,342
- How do you like that?
- He must follow Stryker like a little dog.

242
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:52,860
What do you care?
At least he took him off our hands.

243
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,778
A day after our leave, we drew a 22-mile
hike over terrain carefully selected.

244
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:04,856
All uphill, and it was a weary bunch of
marines who pitched tents that night

245
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:08,135
and gratefully folded themselves inside.

246
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,410
Do you believe in love at first sight?

247
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:26,088
All kinds.

248
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:29,687
I never did before but I sure do now.

249
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:36,644
- Why do you have to tell me now?
- Because I'm thinking about it now.

250
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:40,763
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- What girl?

251
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:46,042
- The girl I met last night.
- You'll feel better in the morning.

252
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,680
I couldn't feel any better
than I do right now.

253
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,998
I've been thinking, why do men
get married during a war?

254
00:23:56,198 --> 00:24:00,516
- Don't know.
- It's the worst time.

255
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:05,234
I fooled around
but I never thought about marriage.

256
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:08,913
I know a lot of girls
back in the States but...

257
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,871
...I think it's because when you get
out here you're close to things.

258
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:18,589
You realise way down inside, no matter
how much you try not to think about it,

259
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,829
that maybe something's
got your number on...

260
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,866
...and you want to leave
a bit of yourself behind.

261
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:32,945
Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl,
just so long as you won't be forgotten.

262
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:38,423
There'll be someone who'd never
have lived if it hadn't been for you.

263
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:42,901
Am I right?

264
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,819
I think I'm right.

265
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:10,211
- Hey, Conway, got a pass?
- I have.

266
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:13,490
All right, hop in. I'll give you a lift.

267
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:26,286
- I hear you got a girl in town.
- What if I have?

268
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:31,163
- They say she's a very nice girl.
- They talk too much.

269
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,322
Are you serious about her?

270
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:42,399
With things the way they are, this is no
time to start getting serious with a girl.

271
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,317
Don't know how long you're gonna
be here or when you'll be back again.

272
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:49,997
Don't even know how long you'll live.

273
00:25:50,196 --> 00:25:54,315
If it's in the line of duty, you can tell me
to do something and I'll do it.

274
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:57,554
As for my personal life,
keep your hands off.

275
00:25:57,754 --> 00:26:00,993
- Your father would've said it.
- I wouldn't have listened.

276
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,632
- You never did.
- How do you know?

277
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:07,351
- He told me.
- What did he say?

278
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:11,149
I'll tell you. He said
I was a disappointment, right?

279
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:15,148
He said I wouldn't be able
to stand up for myself, right?

280
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:18,707
- You're doing the talking.
- No, my father is.

281
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:23,745
Every time you open your mouth, he's
talking. Every thought you think is his.

282
00:26:23,945 --> 00:26:27,143
It's as though he's at my shoulder.

283
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:31,342
But he didn't always say
or think the right thing.

284
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:37,939
You're gonna find that out when the
time comes. Until then leave me alone.

285
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,899
- You want a lift or not?
- Yeah, sure.

286
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:50,336
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Why?

287
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:55,414
- You've hardly said a word.
- You're right. I've been thinking.

288
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:58,533
- About us?
- Myself.

289
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:00,852
That's selfish.

290
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:04,131
Honey, do you think I'm a brave man?

291
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,649
- What a funny question to ask.
- Well, do you?

292
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:11,768
I don't know. Why?

293
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:16,566
- I've got to prove something to someone.
- Who?

294
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:19,725
You don't know him. He's dead now.

295
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:24,683
Yes, Pete, I think you're brave.

296
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:28,841
That helps. You don't know
how much that helps.

297
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:31,960
Let's not talk about it any more.

298
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:37,198
We should have been talking about
ourselves all this time,

299
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:39,357
what's going to happen to us.

300
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:43,516
- What do you want to happen?
- I want to marry you.

301
00:27:43,716 --> 00:27:46,355
I want that, too.

302
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:51,474
Funny, we barely know each other.

303
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:58,471
We see each other for what seems
only moments. And yet...

304
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,429
I know what you mean.

305
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:22,262
- Choynski, not going to the wedding?
- No.

306
00:28:22,462 --> 00:28:29,020
I'd better get a transfer. I can't learn
this bayonet business. I'm all thumbs.

307
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,658
- On guard.
- No, Sarge, not again!

308
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:39,217
- I'm not well from the last time.
- On guard!

309
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:47,613
- Play that thing again. You lead.
- What?

310
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:50,733
You lead!

311
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,129
Shift your weight.

312
00:29:01,328 --> 00:29:04,048
Left, left!

313
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:13,803
There. Keep it up.
You'll get the knack of it.

314
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:17,163
Practise that
about a half an hour every day.

315
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:41,154
Hey, Sarge! I got it!

316
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,549
I haven't been in church since I was 14.

317
00:29:55,749 --> 00:30:00,468
- Kissing the bride's a great invention.
- Sure makes me homesick.

318
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:03,667
- What's the matter?
- He looks the same.

319
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:08,825
- How do you expect him to look?
- Married, wrinkled, worried, like me.

320
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:12,782
- 44 hours and 34 minutes left. Go!
- Excuse me, sports.

321
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:17,461
Here's your wedding present
from the gang.

322
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:19,781
You've all been wonderful.

323
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,819
- Are you sure you've got the right guy?
- I'm sure.

324
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:26,538
Come on, get going!

325
00:30:33,695 --> 00:30:39,493
- "Sempre felice", Mac!
- Keep the situation well in hand, Pete!

326
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:43,572
We got 44 hours and 33 minutes.
What are we gonna do?

327
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:46,612
Al, if I was a girl, I'd marry you.

328
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,689
Knock it off! I've had a hard day.

329
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,168
What am I doing?

330
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:58,407
44 hours and 32 minutes.
That isn't very long, is it?

331
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,926
No, not long at all.

332
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:06,283
I wonder how many other people
have had 44 hours and 32 minutes.

333
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:09,203
Lots I guess.

334
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:13,162
- We'll make it seem a long time.
- Years.

335
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:25,517
- Shall I open it?
- Sure, go ahead.

336
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:37,912
They're in a hurry!

337
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:40,311
Others were in a hurry.

338
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:45,431
The order said move out
and the Marines moved out.

339
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:50,668
11 days at sea. Destination?
Only the top brass knew.

340
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:56,345
Though, of course, scuttlebutt knew the
answer, a hundred answers, all wrong.

341
00:31:56,545 --> 00:32:01,504
Boat Squad... halt, one, two!

342
00:32:02,903 --> 00:32:05,382
Dismissed!

343
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:11,741
Too bad you couldn't see her again.
You didn't get long.

344
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,898
We knew it might happen.
I'll be back. I've got to believe that.

345
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:19,098
- Sure. We'll all be back.
- Gangway!

346
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:27,814
That's no way to carry a flag, Regazzi.
I've got to teach you everything.

347
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:32,813
Now watch this...
What are you gonna do with this, Benny?

348
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:36,092
I'm gonna put that up in Tokyo,
right in the middle of Times Square.

349
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:42,929
- There isn't any Times Square in Tokyo.
- There will be when I get there.

350
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:47,887
Now that's the way to fold a flag,
with the blue field showing.

351
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:50,046
What do you know!

352
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,284
- You got my shirt!
- It's my shirt!

353
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:59,643
- I'm telling you, it's my shirt!
- It's my shirt!

354
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:08,320
Here, fellas. You'd better
quit fighting so much.

355
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:11,479
If you don't, one of you's apt to get hurt.

356
00:33:14,238 --> 00:33:16,756
Corpsman! Corpsman!

357
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:24,515
- What's that?
- Relax. It's the Navy clearing its throat.

358
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:27,193
Sure don't sound like no squirrel gun.

359
00:33:27,393 --> 00:33:31,392
I hope they practise real good. What
island do you think we're aiming at?

360
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:33,551
We'll get word.

361
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,510
- Here it is.
- It looks like a pork chop.

362
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,109
- What's its name?
- Tarawa.

363
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,708
Never heard of it. It's the wrong place.

364
00:33:42,908 --> 00:33:45,707
It's part of an atoll called Tarawa Atoll.

365
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:50,346
This particular island is called Betio.
Don't ask me how you spell it.

366
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:54,503
You'll have to stick your faces into it
but you don't have to spell it.

367
00:33:54,703 --> 00:33:59,861
- This is Red Beach Three. That's us.
- What have they got there?

368
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:04,020
Everything. This island's held
by a special naval landing force.

369
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,419
That means Japanese marines.
They're dug in and they're mean.

370
00:34:08,618 --> 00:34:12,857
They'd just as soon die as stick a nickel
in a jukebox, but that's all right.

371
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:16,656
Let the other guy die for his country.
You'll live for yours.

372
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:22,934
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

373
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:25,813
- Get over there.
- I can hear him.

374
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:31,331
Get over there. I don't want anybody
hurt because you didn't listen.

375
00:34:57,081 --> 00:35:01,159
- Schoolteacher, do me some homework.
- What's your problem, son?

376
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,558
Put down 5,000. Scuttlebutt says
that's how many Nips are on that rock.

377
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:09,916
- The Navy fired 1,000 tons of shells.
- Don't forget the fly-fly boys.

378
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:13,875
Those B-24s have really
been working them over.

379
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:18,474
Now add the tons of explosives, divide it
by the Nips and get the answer.

380
00:35:18,673 --> 00:35:23,191
- Maybe we'll be back for noon chow.
- Don't figure that way.

381
00:35:23,392 --> 00:35:28,110
The Navy and the fly-fly boys unloaded
plenty on the canal before we went in.

382
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,948
When we got ashore there were still a lot
of those lemon-coloured guys waiting.

383
00:35:33,149 --> 00:35:38,427
Only way that island was taken
was by putting marines on the beach.

384
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:44,744
You've heard the naval foray's a waste
of time and metal. Stryker knows better.

385
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:50,022
- Who cut you in on this conversation?
- You say when I can and can't talk?

386
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:54,461
- Just when you can't talk to me.
- Knock it off, Conway.

387
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:58,260
I've had enough of your "hardbitten
sergeant" attitude.

388
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:03,217
You're so big everybody's been afraid
to take a punch at you. I'm not!

389
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:06,016
Cool off!

390
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:12,174
Forget that pencil and paper routine and
worry about staying alive on that beach.

391
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:16,172
- Don't expect any soft touch!
- "Now hear this"!

392
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:20,332
All troops report
to your debarking stations!

393
00:37:02,756 --> 00:37:06,915
All right, men, sound off
when your name's called.

394
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:10,394
Now hear this,
there'll be no movies tonight!

395
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:13,491
The place is opened up for business.

396
00:38:18,169 --> 00:38:20,808
- Missed!
- Maybe they're firing blanks.

397
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:25,527
- Maybe a two-headed kid's aiming.
- Maybe this is just manoeuvres.

398
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:53,597
Get out now. We're crossing the line
of departure. Lock and load!

399
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,579
- Good luck, Sarge!
- Charlie, give me a hand here!

400
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:49,216
Lieutenant, hit the deck! How is it?

401
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:51,095
I got hit!

402
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,574
Corpsman! You'll be all right.

403
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,890
They got us pinned down!
We can't get over these logs!

404
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,048
- I'm going while I can!
- Stay here, kid!

405
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:32,762
We're gonna be killed here.
I'd like to get at them!

406
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:35,520
Why rush? This is a nice place.

407
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:47,235
- They got the lieutenant!
- They'll get all of us if we don't move.

408
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:51,314
We are like fish in a barrel lying here.

409
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:58,591
- Did we train to take it lying down?
- Sarge, do something about it!

410
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:02,989
Stay where you are until I tell you.

411
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:12,146
You gotta get us out of here!

412
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:16,705
If you're nervous count your toes.
I'll do the masterminding around here.

413
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:28,021
- Where's Lieutenant Baker?
- Machine-gunned.

414
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:31,860
- Is your squad all right?
- All but one. What's holding us down?

415
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:37,018
That bunker, an old power plant. All
these bombs and they're still killing us.

416
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:40,896
- Smoke, sir?
- Thanks.

417
00:41:41,096 --> 00:41:45,614
I've sent for flame-throwers to assist.
Your squad will support. Follow me!

418
00:41:45,814 --> 00:41:48,893
You heard! Move out and stay down!

419
00:42:12,006 --> 00:42:14,605
We've gotta silence that bunker!

420
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:38,676
Request naval gunfire
be lifted on target areas, coordinates...

421
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:43,474
...two-four-six-zero-sugar-tare. Over.

422
00:42:46,193 --> 00:42:48,152
Roger and out.

423
00:43:01,668 --> 00:43:05,586
Flame-throwers out! Demolition in!

424
00:43:41,093 --> 00:43:43,253
Demolition out!

425
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:00,246
Shipley!

426
00:44:09,484 --> 00:44:12,922
Give me a hand with this pack.

427
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:50,229
Throw it!

428
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:10,061
Move out!

429
00:46:01,723 --> 00:46:04,443
Get him out of there!

430
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:17,478
- There goes one of your nine.
- Now we got tanks.

431
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:20,156
Better late than never.

432
00:46:20,357 --> 00:46:22,315
Come on!

433
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:29,153
Corpsman! Corpsman! This way!

434
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:36,071
Don't wait. They'll find me.
Keep going. Hit 'em for me.

435
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:39,989
Find Stryker. Stick with him.

436
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:43,547
He's good people.

437
00:46:43,748 --> 00:46:46,347
Tell him I...

438
00:47:28,132 --> 00:47:31,170
I'd like to know
where the rest of the squad went.

439
00:47:31,371 --> 00:47:35,010
- What's this place?
- Whatever it is it ain't healthy!

440
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,689
Let's go!

441
00:47:46,126 --> 00:47:49,645
That was close.
Next time don't be in such a hurry.

442
00:47:49,845 --> 00:47:53,403
- You're across, ain't you?
- Across what? To where?

443
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:57,961
- I'm running low on ammo.
- I am too.

444
00:47:58,161 --> 00:48:02,120
Forgot about that.
We gotta get some more.

445
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,958
- I'll go.
- Wait! Pick a number from one to six.

446
00:48:06,158 --> 00:48:08,438
- Two.
- Five.

447
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:11,557
You're both wrong.

448
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:23,392
That guy kills me.

449
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:35,188
Thomas better hurry!

450
00:48:43,784 --> 00:48:47,304
- How about some bandoliers, Mac?
- Help yourself.

451
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:55,301
- How are things going up front?
- Pretty rough.

452
00:48:55,501 --> 00:48:58,459
- Keep it coming.
- Good luck.

453
00:49:10,096 --> 00:49:13,814
- Is that coffee?
- It sure is. Do you want some?

454
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:18,492
Do I want some, he says!

455
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:24,370
I haven't had any joe
since we left the ship.

456
00:49:30,128 --> 00:49:34,047
You mortarmen sure live
the life of Riley here.

457
00:49:34,247 --> 00:49:36,207
Here you are.

458
00:49:41,564 --> 00:49:43,764
Beautiful!

459
00:49:47,841 --> 00:49:50,362
- Where's Thomas?
- Probably dead.

460
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,560
No, not that guy. Let's get out of here!

461
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:18,151
- Can I have some for my buddies?
- Sure. Break out your canteen.

462
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:21,910
Tell me, how's everything been going?

463
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:27,549
Couldn't be better, Mac.
Oh, this is the life!

464
00:50:32,826 --> 00:50:37,705
Come and get it, you guys!
Ammo and fresh hot joe!

465
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:39,184
Hellenopolis!

466
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:41,343
Bass!

467
00:51:06,174 --> 00:51:08,133
Hey, Greek!

468
00:51:13,172 --> 00:51:15,171
Hey, Greek!

469
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,449
- What kepts you, Thomas?
- Where's Bass?

470
00:51:21,648 --> 00:51:23,408
Gutted.

471
00:51:23,608 --> 00:51:25,887
No ammo.

472
00:51:26,886 --> 00:51:29,486
What kept you, sports?

473
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:54,796
Major Crowe, sir.

474
00:51:57,316 --> 00:52:00,755
- Jim? How you doing?
- "It's tough going, Dave".

475
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:04,633
I've committed every man.
We're dug in and staying.

476
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:11,471
Good. I've been getting reports all day
that the Nips are slipping in to your front.

477
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:18,148
If it's "banzai" tonight,
target area 2-41 is a hot spot.

478
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:21,107
What outfit have you got there?

479
00:52:22,587 --> 00:52:24,946
Joyce and Stryker.

480
00:52:25,146 --> 00:52:28,944
Pass the word they gotta dig in
and stay put.

481
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:31,543
No noise or movement.

482
00:52:31,743 --> 00:52:38,701
Don't risk anybody unless you have to.
Hold on until we get more men there.

483
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:43,860
Yes, sir.

484
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:48,378
Major Crowe says the Nips have been
filtering into these tank traps.

485
00:52:48,577 --> 00:52:51,657
Disperse your squad along this section.

486
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:56,615
Tell your men there's to be no smoking,
no moving or unnecessary talking.

487
00:52:56,814 --> 00:53:00,772
If they find out how thin we are,
they can get to the beach.

488
00:53:00,973 --> 00:53:05,732
That's a platoon area. All I got's
a beat-up squad, short three men.

489
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,890
- Couldn't you...?
- Can I give you three men?

490
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:14,248
The battalion can't give the whole
company three replacements.

491
00:53:14,447 --> 00:53:17,967
Your squad is covering
the hottest spot in the line.

492
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:23,205
If it's an attack tonight they'll strike you
first. They want to know our disposition.

493
00:53:23,405 --> 00:53:26,524
I repeat, your men are not to move.

494
00:53:26,724 --> 00:53:31,802
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Stryker, we're going to hold this line.

495
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:35,361
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Good luck.

496
00:53:45,118 --> 00:53:47,757
All right, saddle up. Follow me.

497
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:50,515
Everybody go!

498
00:53:55,434 --> 00:54:00,712
Drop off at intervals, two-man foxholes.
We're gonna be spread out thin tonight.

499
00:54:00,912 --> 00:54:07,629
Don't give away your position or strength.
You Flynns stay here, and no quarrels.

500
00:54:10,468 --> 00:54:14,147
Dunne and Smith, drop out here.

501
00:54:14,347 --> 00:54:17,986
No gab tonight!

502
00:54:20,944 --> 00:54:23,943
You and Harris here! Come on, Conway.

503
00:54:43,496 --> 00:54:45,455
Corpsman!

504
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:47,615
Listen.

505
00:54:50,973 --> 00:54:53,973
- Corpsman!
- That's a marine.

506
00:54:57,092 --> 00:54:59,090
Corpsman!

507
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,928
- Stryker!
- Get down and stay down!

508
00:55:06,129 --> 00:55:09,447
- You had your orders!
- Somebody's wounded!

509
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:11,845
- Quiet.
- Let's get him!

510
00:55:12,046 --> 00:55:16,484
Stay down! It may be an old Jap trick.
They pulled it on the canal.

511
00:55:16,685 --> 00:55:23,082
- It doesn't sound like a Jap to me.
- I don't care. You'll tip our position.

512
00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:28,040
Stryker!

513
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,838
It's Bass!
How many Japs know your name?

514
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:34,038
- You know his voice.
- Shut up.

515
00:55:36,997 --> 00:55:41,156
Aren't you human at all?
A friend of yours may be dying!

516
00:55:41,355 --> 00:55:42,916
Knock it off!

517
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:47,073
This is what my father taught you.
Be a great marine, be tough.

518
00:55:47,273 --> 00:55:52,551
Sit here if you want. I'm getting him.
The only way you'll stop me is to kill me.

519
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:55,470
That's just what I'll do!

520
00:56:15,384 --> 00:56:17,343
Stryker!

521
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:20,781
Stryker!

522
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,978
Sarge!

523
00:56:33,177 --> 00:56:35,136
Stryker!

524
00:56:40,015 --> 00:56:42,094
Please, Sarge!

525
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:58,288
Tarawa was officially declared secure
at 13.30 on the fourth day of battle.

526
00:56:58,488 --> 00:57:04,166
The replacements came ashore,
our wounded were cared for

527
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:07,925
and the assault troops were relieved.

528
00:57:17,122 --> 00:57:21,119
- How am I doing, Chaplain?
- God has been good to you.

529
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,679
You're going home.

530
00:57:24,759 --> 00:57:29,557
Per istam Sanctam Unctionem,
et suam piisimam,

531
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:34,635
indulgeat tibi Dominus
"quidquid deliquisti. Amen".

532
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:02,545
Somebody beat me to it.

533
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:49,768
Skipper gave out some news.
Part of it's good, part of it's bad.

534
00:58:49,968 --> 00:58:53,727
- They found Hellenopolis. He's dead.
- He was a good Greek.

535
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:58,525
Choynski, Soames and Bass are on
a hospital ship Stateside-bound.

536
00:58:58,726 --> 00:59:01,684
- I wish I was with them.
- Let's get cleaned up.

537
00:59:01,885 --> 00:59:05,843
Wash out those dungarees
and let's look like marines.

538
00:59:09,441 --> 00:59:12,200
You too, Thomas.

539
00:59:17,798 --> 00:59:19,838
- Dunne.
- Yeah?

540
00:59:22,957 --> 00:59:27,554
I got a couple of bottles of sake
in my gear. Give it to the squad.

541
00:59:27,755 --> 00:59:31,672
- Right.
- Tell them you got it off a dead Nip.

542
00:59:31,873 --> 00:59:35,112
Why don't you break down a little?

543
00:59:35,312 --> 00:59:37,830
You got it off a dead Nip.

544
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:40,070
Aye, aye.

545
01:00:01,943 --> 01:00:06,221
- What's eating you?
- Know what Stryker plans tomorrow?

546
01:00:06,421 --> 01:00:10,539
Another squad problem
and I'm so tired of problems!

547
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:14,778
I'm tired of Stryker!
I'm also tired of beautiful Hawaii.

548
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:16,937
Me, too.

549
01:00:18,777 --> 01:00:22,895
Hey, champ, what do you think
of beautiful Hawaii?

550
01:00:23,094 --> 01:00:29,132
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Clamming up again, ever since Tarawa.

551
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:31,772
- Why the silence?
- Knock it off!

552
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:36,890
- Hi! You got room for me?
- What do you know!

553
01:00:37,089 --> 01:00:39,849
- You got time off for good behaviour?
- Yeah.

554
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:44,007
- Where were you? Pearl Harbor?
- Yeah, nice place. Pretty nurses.

555
01:00:44,206 --> 01:00:47,486
I'll give somebody $5
to shoot me in the foot.

556
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,525
- I'll do it for $2.50.
- You're too willing!

557
01:00:50,725 --> 01:00:54,164
Some replacements out here
assigned to our squad.

558
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:57,922
We build up the joint
and they come and live in it.

559
01:00:58,122 --> 01:01:01,481
This is Stein and Fowler and McHugh.

560
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:06,559
He's Fowler. Mike McHugh, from Cedar
Rapids to see this war's over in a hurry.

561
01:01:06,759 --> 01:01:09,118
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

562
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:12,757
- How old?
- Well, eighteen... going on eighteen.

563
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:15,916
We heard that the squad leader's tough.

564
01:01:16,117 --> 01:01:21,315
- There are rumours to that effect.
- Tough sergeants roll off my knife!

565
01:01:21,513 --> 01:01:27,192
You're gonna find your first few days
with Sergeant Stryker very interesting.

566
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:30,351
You new men come with me.

567
01:01:37,548 --> 01:01:41,747
- Attention!
- Charlie! How are you?

568
01:01:41,947 --> 01:01:44,986
- Certified fit for duty, so the medics say.
- Good.

569
01:01:45,186 --> 01:01:48,503
The replacements came up with me.

570
01:01:48,704 --> 01:01:51,063
They get younger all the time.

571
01:01:51,263 --> 01:01:54,022
- Or we're getting older.
- Or both.

572
01:01:54,222 --> 01:01:57,421
- I can stand having you back.
- I can stand being back.

573
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:01,620
What happened to the squad, besides
the Greek, Shipley and Thomas?

574
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:05,298
Choynski...
Thomas? He never got a scratch.

575
01:02:07,337 --> 01:02:10,056
- I was sure he got it.
- Why?

576
01:02:10,256 --> 01:02:15,494
When we got stuck in a trench he went
back to get ammo. Never came back.

577
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:20,253
How long between the time he went back
and you got overrun?

578
01:02:20,452 --> 01:02:22,893
About 40 minutes.

579
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:25,052
40 minutes?

580
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,210
Stay here.

581
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:38,367
Thomas!

582
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:41,486
- Yeah?
- Outside.

583
01:02:50,842 --> 01:02:54,681
- What's that about?
- Don't ask me. I haven't any spies.

584
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,999
- That's far enough.
- What's this about?

585
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:01,518
Just that I hate your guts!

586
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:22,910
Get up.

587
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:28,668
You doped off and got one of my men
killed and one of them bayoneted!

588
01:03:28,868 --> 01:03:31,867
- You haven't had enough. Get up!
- Stryker...

589
01:03:32,866 --> 01:03:35,546
Attention! All right, break it up.

590
01:03:37,945 --> 01:03:41,864
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Stryker. Able Company, sir.

591
01:03:42,063 --> 01:03:43,423
And you?

592
01:03:43,623 --> 01:03:47,821
Pfc Thomas. Able Company, sir.

593
01:03:48,022 --> 01:03:52,980
This may take some explaining before
a court martial. Help that man up.

594
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:03,496
- You'll need medical attention.
- I'll be OK, sir.

595
01:04:03,695 --> 01:04:09,054
That's debatable. You know it's not
permissible for an NCO to strike a man?

596
01:04:09,254 --> 01:04:11,813
- Yes, sir.
- Who struck the first blow?

597
01:04:14,572 --> 01:04:18,131
Colonel, there wasn't any first blow
struck exactly.

598
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:21,289
A simultaneous explosion perhaps?

599
01:04:22,689 --> 01:04:26,647
Judo, sir. The sergeant was showing me
how to break a judo hold.

600
01:04:26,847 --> 01:04:30,646
No more judo exhibitions.
Understand, Sergeant?

601
01:04:30,846 --> 01:04:32,845
Aye, aye, sir.

602
01:04:41,402 --> 01:04:43,962
At least you're no stool pigeon.

603
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:46,600
Wait a minute, Stryker.

604
01:04:47,641 --> 01:04:50,638
I'm wrong, dead wrong. I know it.

605
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:56,397
I doped off for some coffee,
but I didn't think a few minutes mattered.

606
01:04:56,597 --> 01:05:00,516
- It did!
- I know that now, but I didn't then.

607
01:05:00,715 --> 01:05:03,115
It's killing me. I can't sleep.

608
01:05:03,315 --> 01:05:09,231
A hundred times I wanted to tell you,
tell somebody. I...

609
01:05:09,432 --> 01:05:14,031
I liked that Greek...
I'd do anything for him.

610
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:19,749
If I could I'd change him
for me right now.

611
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:22,827
I think you would.

612
01:05:23,027 --> 01:05:29,265
Guys make mistakes but every one
we make, a stack of chips goes with it.

613
01:05:29,465 --> 01:05:33,423
We make a mistake
and some guy don't walk away!

614
01:05:33,623 --> 01:05:36,623
For evermore he don't walk away.

615
01:05:37,942 --> 01:05:41,541
I guess all we can do is just take it...

616
01:05:42,781 --> 01:05:47,258
...and hope we don't make
the same mistake again.

617
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,219
I won't.

618
01:05:54,376 --> 01:05:56,415
Let's get back.

619
01:06:00,054 --> 01:06:02,614
Mail call! First Platoon.

620
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:11,850
A letter from my wife after 18 months.
Know where she is?

621
01:06:12,049 --> 01:06:14,609
In England, entertaining troops.

622
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:20,207
Entertaining troops? Why isn't she here
entertaining me? I'm a troop.

623
01:06:20,407 --> 01:06:25,965
"They're all such nice boys. There's
a lieutenant here..." A lieutenant!

624
01:06:26,165 --> 01:06:32,322
When I get back she'll need standing
up for a month! I put on muscle lately!

625
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:42,279
Darling, this is a funny way for a man
to find out he's a father, but you are.

626
01:06:42,479 --> 01:06:47,157
It happened the day before yesterday,
just in time for breakfast.

627
01:06:47,357 --> 01:06:51,716
He's a boy and looks beautiful like me
and intelligent like you.

628
01:06:51,915 --> 01:06:58,513
I should have told you it was going to
happen, but I didn't want to worry you.

629
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:03,272
I don't know what to call him.
We never discussed that.

630
01:07:03,471 --> 01:07:07,429
- I'm a father! Hey, I'm a father!
- Let's see!

631
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:12,108
- I'm a father!
- All right, let's fall in!

632
01:07:15,028 --> 01:07:16,587
Come on!

633
01:07:22,185 --> 01:07:26,343
Finally we got our leave.
Ten days in Honolulu.

634
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:30,622
All of us were out on the town.
All except Stryker.

635
01:07:30,822 --> 01:07:33,421
He was still the same.

636
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:56,092
- Lonesome?
- Drift.

637
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:03,649
- Whiskey.
- Two?

638
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:08,009
- Please.
- OK.

639
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:13,006
Thanks. A drink'll be good. I'm tired.
It's been a rough day...

640
01:08:13,207 --> 01:08:15,725
Knock it off!

641
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:18,685
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

642
01:08:23,363 --> 01:08:25,722
- Right.
- Thanks.

643
01:08:26,762 --> 01:08:31,240
65 cents for a drink. It's too much.
They cheat servicemen.

644
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:35,798
We could drink cheaper at my house.

645
01:08:35,998 --> 01:08:38,677
Don't throw your arm out of joint.

646
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:47,274
Thanks for the drink. I didn't mean
to make too much buzzing in your ear.

647
01:08:47,474 --> 01:08:50,233
It's all right, finish your drink.

648
01:08:55,312 --> 01:09:00,989
- I didn't mean to sound so tough.
- I know. You're just unhappy.

649
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:07,468
Me, too.

650
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,666
My name's Mary.

651
01:09:13,344 --> 01:09:16,624
The long arm of coincidence,
or something.

652
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:19,742
Her name, too.

653
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:25,541
That invitation still hold?

654
01:09:37,856 --> 01:09:41,415
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll fix us a drink.

655
01:09:49,012 --> 01:09:53,210
Oh, dear!
Well, I can get us some more in a jiffy.

656
01:10:01,248 --> 01:10:03,207
I see.

657
01:10:05,087 --> 01:10:07,686
Will a sawbuck do it?

658
01:10:07,885 --> 01:10:11,724
Go on, take it. It's only paper.

659
01:10:13,203 --> 01:10:16,122
Well, I'll be right back.

660
01:11:20,139 --> 01:11:24,657
- I hope this is your brand.
- Any brand is mine.

661
01:11:37,812 --> 01:11:41,692
- She says she's hungry.
- He.

662
01:11:44,011 --> 01:11:46,770
Advise him against joining the Marines.

663
01:11:53,248 --> 01:11:59,324
Mummy's fixing you something. Her
boy'll be quiet while she has company.

664
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:03,845
Knock it off...
Where's his father?

665
01:12:05,164 --> 01:12:07,123
Gone.

666
01:12:10,441 --> 01:12:14,401
Well, I guess into each life
a little rain must fall.

667
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:24,596
There are a lot tougher ways
of making a living than going to war.

668
01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:34,353
You know about babies.

669
01:12:36,433 --> 01:12:38,951
Yeah, I know about babies.

670
01:12:59,664 --> 01:13:01,223
So long, Mac.

671
01:13:06,502 --> 01:13:10,860
- Wait!
- I can't spend it on a coral reef.

672
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:16,658
- You're a very good man.
- You'll get odds on that in the Marines.

673
01:13:16,857 --> 01:13:18,817
So long.

674
01:13:20,016 --> 01:13:23,335
So long, Sergeant. I'll pray for you.

675
01:13:23,535 --> 01:13:26,854
Let's not get religion.

676
01:13:27,055 --> 01:13:30,572
- I'll pray for you, Sergeant!
- Good luck.

677
01:13:34,011 --> 01:13:38,770
You got a lot of bloodhound in you,
Charlie, but you can call off the dogs.

678
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,648
I'm smarter than I was 30 minutes ago.

679
01:13:41,849 --> 01:13:44,767
Catch me feeling sorry for myself again

680
01:13:44,968 --> 01:13:48,127
and you got my permission
to belt me in the nose!

681
01:13:48,327 --> 01:13:51,924
- Buy you a drink?
- Lock and load, boy!

682
01:13:59,842 --> 01:14:01,921
- Thanks!
- Two bourbon and ice.

683
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,799
- A baby's a big event.
- Conway!

684
01:14:13,717 --> 01:14:17,356
- Treating the boys?
- Crack open the hatch!

685
01:14:17,556 --> 01:14:22,995
That's great. A fellow always gets
more kick out of a boy, I guess.

686
01:14:23,194 --> 01:14:26,672
I got a kid. Sam, I named him...

687
01:14:29,191 --> 01:14:31,151
...after your old man.

688
01:14:31,352 --> 01:14:35,389
Wait till he gets to be ten and doesn't
write. You'll be mad enough to hit him.

689
01:14:35,589 --> 01:14:40,668
No, I won't, Stryker, because he won't
have to write. I'll be where he is.

690
01:14:40,867 --> 01:14:45,505
And I won't insist that he be tough.
I'll try to make him intelligent.

691
01:14:45,706 --> 01:14:51,184
And I won't insist that he read the Marine
Corps manual. I'll get him Shakespeare.

692
01:14:51,384 --> 01:14:54,982
I don't want him to be a Colonel Conway
or Sergeant Stryker.

693
01:14:55,183 --> 01:15:00,381
I want him to be intelligent, considerate,
cultured and a gentleman.

694
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:03,859
- You're out of line, kid.
- Let him be. He has a right to dislike me.

695
01:15:04,059 --> 01:15:07,458
Thanks, and I intend
to exercise that right.

696
01:15:07,658 --> 01:15:12,776
- I don't like you, Stryker.
- Let's talk sense for a minute, Conway.

697
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:15,775
I can't have friction in the squad.

698
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:21,613
I've tried every approach to you that I
know. Got nowhere. You're intelligent...

699
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:26,251
Don't patronise me. Your opinion of
my IQ doesn't interest me in the least.

700
01:15:26,451 --> 01:15:32,169
Let's get this straight.
On duty I jump when you holler.

701
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:36,527
Off duty I exercise my God-given rights
under a democracy

702
01:15:36,727 --> 01:15:39,446
and dislike whom I please.

703
01:15:40,646 --> 01:15:43,606
Do we understand each other?

704
01:15:49,842 --> 01:15:53,322
- Beat it.
- Come on, you guys, let's go.

705
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:07,437
I don't understand
why you don't belt him.

706
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:11,436
- Mellow in my old age, I guess.
- Too bad.

707
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:14,434
"Screaming Sam"
couldn't be proud of him.

708
01:16:14,634 --> 01:16:20,032
He could. There's something inside
a guy, always proud of a kid.

709
01:16:20,232 --> 01:16:22,711
- Two more?
- Not for me.

710
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,830
- I'll sail again. One.
- OK.

711
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:29,309
- Maybe you can steer me home?
- Charge!

712
01:16:32,547 --> 01:16:34,267
Pull pins!

713
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:36,466
Prepare to throw!

714
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:38,625
Throw!

715
01:16:44,663 --> 01:16:47,903
- All right, fifth relay!
- What an arm!

716
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:50,582
Pick it up!

717
01:16:50,782 --> 01:16:53,300
Right in the groove!

718
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,738
- Look, boy, this is a live grenade.
- Gee!

719
01:16:56,938 --> 01:17:00,498
- You know what they can do?
- Yes, sir.

720
01:17:00,697 --> 01:17:06,656
Right hand. Wait for the order
to pull pin and pitch grenade.

721
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:08,694
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

722
01:17:08,895 --> 01:17:10,853
Ready?

723
01:17:12,254 --> 01:17:14,173
Pull pin!

724
01:17:14,373 --> 01:17:16,732
Prepare to throw!

725
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:19,332
Throw!

726
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:24,209
Grenade! Hit the deck!

727
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:36,206
When will you wake up? You wanna see
her again, keep your mind on your work!

728
01:17:36,405 --> 01:17:40,403
- What happened here?
- Little accident, sir.

729
01:17:40,603 --> 01:17:43,522
You're wounded. Corpsman!

730
01:17:43,723 --> 01:17:46,762
- Yes, sir.
- Take care of the sergeant.

731
01:17:46,961 --> 01:17:49,920
Come right over here, Sergeant.

732
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:54,998
You may not know it,
but you just got your life saved.

733
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,158
You'll get a medal.

734
01:17:59,357 --> 01:18:02,476
Again the word came
and the Marines moved out.

735
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:06,634
Again scuttlebutt knew a hundred
destinations, all wrong.

736
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:10,873
This time we were a sound fighting unit,
blooded and trained.

737
01:18:11,072 --> 01:18:14,791
Tarawa had blooded us.
Stryker had trained us.

738
01:18:25,427 --> 01:18:29,946
- Now, I'll show you something.
- What you got there?

739
01:18:30,145 --> 01:18:32,225
- What does it look like?
- A flag.

740
01:18:32,425 --> 01:18:37,383
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Occupy this island in the USA's name.

741
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:41,621
- You think we'll have an easy time?
- You got me with you.

742
01:18:41,821 --> 01:18:46,418
- Maybe we need two of you.
- One was enough in Tarawa.

743
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:50,179
Stick with me.
I'm a battle-hardened veteran.

744
01:18:50,379 --> 01:18:55,977
Know how many Japs I knocked off
in Tarawa? 32. Did I get anything for it?

745
01:18:56,176 --> 01:18:58,895
I got enemies in Washington.

746
01:18:59,096 --> 01:19:02,653
If the Marines didn't have me,
they'd never have made it.

747
01:19:02,854 --> 01:19:06,533
Now, this is how you fold a flag!

748
01:19:09,572 --> 01:19:12,330
Do you believe in intuition?

749
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:16,048
Yeah... in women. Why?

750
01:19:16,249 --> 01:19:20,448
It's hard to explain. I've a feeling
I'm not coming out of this operation.

751
01:19:20,648 --> 01:19:23,087
Don't talk that way.

752
01:19:23,288 --> 01:19:26,685
- I can't help it. It's the way I feel.
- Why?

753
01:19:26,885 --> 01:19:31,284
I don't know. It's like a voice in my ear.
I can't shake the feeling off.

754
01:19:31,484 --> 01:19:34,043
Take my advice, shake it off.

755
01:19:34,243 --> 01:19:40,240
No dice. When things like that get in you,
it's no use trying to fight them.

756
01:19:47,358 --> 01:19:50,677
If a marine waits long enough
he gets the word.

757
01:19:50,876 --> 01:19:54,835
Our sealed orders came aboard
after five days at sea.

758
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,673
This island is volcanic and sandy.

759
01:19:59,874 --> 01:20:04,231
It's five and a half miles long
and two and a half miles wide.

760
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:09,270
This mountain here
is a dead volcano. It's called Suribachi.

761
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:15,067
There's nothing on the island except
three airfields and about 20,000 Japs.

762
01:20:16,107 --> 01:20:21,226
The Army Air Corps B-24s have been
bombing this place for 62 days.

763
01:20:21,426 --> 01:20:25,784
- Maybe it'll be an easy operation then.
- We can't be sure.

764
01:20:25,984 --> 01:20:29,303
Every yard is covered
by some kind of fire.

765
01:20:29,503 --> 01:20:35,501
There are two possible landing beaches,
one on the east side, one on the west.

766
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:39,019
The rest of the coastline is cliffs.

767
01:20:39,219 --> 01:20:41,259
They'll try and keep us off the beaches.

768
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:45,337
If they don't, they'll try and catch us
at this first airfield,

769
01:20:45,537 --> 01:20:50,535
between the heights of Suribachi
and these high rocky ridges in the north.

770
01:20:50,736 --> 01:20:56,573
They'll shell us from both sides. Nobody
knows what they've got on this island.

771
01:20:56,773 --> 01:20:59,772
But they've had 40 years to put it there.

772
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:05,449
Saipan was our last stop.

773
01:21:05,649 --> 01:21:10,048
The men who were going to hit
the beach first transferred to LS Ts.

774
01:21:10,248 --> 01:21:14,327
A few more days at sea
and the time for landing came.

775
01:21:58,431 --> 01:21:59,871
Saddle up!

776
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:03,030
Skip along and into the amtracs.

777
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:02,408
Anyway, it's a good day for it.

778
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:05,527
- It's cold.
- Stick around, it'll get warm.

779
01:23:05,727 --> 01:23:09,366
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
Hey, look!

780
01:23:14,203 --> 01:23:18,962
- Driver, you the joker that wrote that?
- "Semper fi", Mac!

781
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:22,121
We should take you in along with us.

782
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,399
Hey, McHugh's going in with his pocket
full of books! Five books he's got!

783
01:23:29,599 --> 01:23:33,357
So? The kid's a reader.
That shouldn't worry a dope like you.

784
01:23:33,557 --> 01:23:38,754
When we're through with this operation,
I'm gonna break both your legs!

785
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:57,509
- I feel sick.
- I know. I felt the same way at Tarawa.

786
01:23:57,708 --> 01:24:00,827
Hey, Stein, "Shalom aleychem".

787
01:24:01,027 --> 01:24:03,666
Aleychem shalom.

788
01:24:06,385 --> 01:24:09,944
- Sarge, I'm scared.
- So am I.

789
01:24:10,144 --> 01:24:14,862
- Not you!
- Fowler, I'm always scared.

790
01:24:15,062 --> 01:24:17,861
Line of departure! Get down!

791
01:24:18,062 --> 01:24:23,099
Lock and load! Drop those lifebelts
when we hit the beach!

792
01:25:08,684 --> 01:25:11,442
All right, hit the beach!

793
01:25:52,306 --> 01:25:54,187
It ain't Brooklyn!

794
01:25:54,387 --> 01:25:58,504
If this place was a blanket
I'd pull it over my head!

795
01:25:58,705 --> 01:26:03,703
This is the poorest soil I ever saw. What
does anyone want an island like this for?

796
01:26:03,903 --> 01:26:05,862
- That's war.
- What's war?

797
01:26:06,062 --> 01:26:08,182
Trading real estate for men.

798
01:26:08,381 --> 01:26:14,259
When God made the world, he must
have put all the rubbish left over here.

799
01:26:14,459 --> 01:26:17,418
Corpsman! Corpsman! Take it easy.

800
01:26:17,618 --> 01:26:22,376
Doggone it, almost the same place
they got me before!

801
01:26:23,937 --> 01:26:25,895
Getting shot for this!

802
01:26:27,014 --> 01:26:30,413
They're sure pouring it into Suribachi.

803
01:26:35,932 --> 01:26:40,689
Not enough. Those Nips
are shooting right down our throats.

804
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:44,008
- Stryker!
- Yo!

805
01:26:46,647 --> 01:26:50,446
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.
- Lieutenant Shrier?

806
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:53,445
Stand fast.

807
01:27:06,081 --> 01:27:08,520
- Stryker reporting, sir.
- I know.

808
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:12,878
Your platoon's been hit hard.
What's left has been assigned to me.

809
01:27:13,078 --> 01:27:16,998
- Yes, sir.
- Naval gunfire lifts at 1100. Stand by.

810
01:27:17,197 --> 01:27:18,476
Aye, aye.

811
01:27:39,869 --> 01:27:42,147
Move out!

812
01:27:42,348 --> 01:27:45,066
Keep your distance!

813
01:29:21,592 --> 01:29:26,350
- Go on, go on!
- Corpsman! Corpsman! Corpsman!

814
01:29:29,269 --> 01:29:32,028
Spread out! Dig in!

815
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:45,423
- Dunne, where's my brother?
- Back there. He's hit.

816
01:29:49,022 --> 01:29:50,303
Flynn!

817
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:01,778
That's enough!

818
01:30:06,935 --> 01:30:12,253
I told you you'd need this bad
some day. Thanks, Marine.

819
01:30:19,292 --> 01:30:21,251
Flynn! Get down!

820
01:30:24,049 --> 01:30:30,687
- You ain't got the sense of a rabbit!
- You can still be a hero crawling!

821
01:30:30,887 --> 01:30:35,565
- Corpsman!
- Ma'll dust me off if I don't get him back!

822
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:39,644
Harris!

823
01:30:42,883 --> 01:30:46,802
Well, I'll get a good night's sleep tonight.

824
01:30:47,001 --> 01:30:49,122
Corpsman!

825
01:30:49,321 --> 01:30:51,601
He won't need him.

826
01:31:06,754 --> 01:31:10,354
- Pillbox too big to handle with these.
- A bazooka?

827
01:31:10,553 --> 01:31:15,952
- If we had one.
- I got nothing to do. I'll go pick one up.

828
01:31:52,458 --> 01:31:54,458
Regazzi didn't make it.

829
01:31:54,658 --> 01:31:57,856
You never know what's happening.

830
01:31:58,057 --> 01:32:00,055
Listen.

831
01:32:02,134 --> 01:32:05,133
- It's a tank.
- Yeah, but whose?

832
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,053
Ours!

833
01:32:30,165 --> 01:32:32,523
It's Regazzi.

834
01:32:52,518 --> 01:32:55,315
Pillbox at 2 o'clock.

835
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:02,914
OK, give 'em a hot foot!

836
01:33:14,829 --> 01:33:16,788
Thanks, Mac.

837
01:33:22,506 --> 01:33:27,225
- I couldn't find a bazooka.
- You did all right. Saddle up!

838
01:33:59,453 --> 01:34:05,291
No one had ever seen anything like it.
No one would have believed it possible.

839
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:08,490
That smoking, miserable, bloody island.

840
01:34:15,127 --> 01:34:19,125
After three days and three nights,
and at the end of that time,

841
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:25,003
we'd barely reached the foot of
Suribachi, where we were the first day.

842
01:34:30,362 --> 01:34:33,721
- We'll sack here for the night.
- Best news today.

843
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,479
Pair off and one man awake at all times.
Keep alert. Let's go.

844
01:34:49,155 --> 01:34:52,154
It'll start getting rough tomorrow
against Suribachi.

845
01:34:52,354 --> 01:34:56,752
It started getting rough
when you put on that uniform.

846
01:34:56,952 --> 01:35:00,151
You wanna see a good-looking kid?

847
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:04,069
Husky little boot. What's his name?

848
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:08,549
We're gonna name him Sam,
Sam Conway.

849
01:35:08,748 --> 01:35:13,706
A name that's been awarded the Navy
Cross is good enough for any kid.

850
01:35:13,906 --> 01:35:19,064
There's something I've been trying
to say but... I can't find the words.

851
01:35:19,264 --> 01:35:24,183
Two universities and you can't find
the words to say you were out of line?

852
01:35:24,383 --> 01:35:29,661
- OK, I'm out of line.
- No, you were. There's a difference.

853
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:37,178
We'd better get some sack time.
Wanna sleep first or watch?

854
01:35:37,377 --> 01:35:39,937
- I'll watch.
- OK.

855
01:35:44,055 --> 01:35:48,254
Everybody gets out of line
once in a while.

856
01:35:50,053 --> 01:35:51,612
Thanks, gyrene.

857
01:35:54,771 --> 01:35:57,211
Where's Sergeant Stryker?

858
01:35:57,410 --> 01:36:00,089
- Stryker?
- Right there.

859
01:36:02,809 --> 01:36:06,607
- What do you want?
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.

860
01:36:09,486 --> 01:36:11,445
- Stryker, sir.
- Yes, sir.

861
01:36:11,645 --> 01:36:13,884
I'm taking a patrol up Suribachi.

862
01:36:14,084 --> 01:36:17,363
Get your men squared away
and be ready at 0700.

863
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:21,641
- The rendezvous is that Nip tank there.
- Aye, aye, sir, 0700.

864
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:34,997
That little voice whispering
in your ear again?

865
01:36:35,197 --> 01:36:39,716
Don't worry. I've known
a million guys that have heard it.

866
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:44,874
Most of them make it. A few don't.
The percentage is on your side.

867
01:36:45,074 --> 01:36:48,832
- Did you ever hear it?
- No.

868
01:36:49,032 --> 01:36:52,991
- Don't you ever worry about it?
- What good would it do?

869
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:56,949
- You're indestructible.
- Stick close. It might rub off!

870
01:36:57,149 --> 01:36:58,749
I'll do that.

871
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:05,105
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Patrol is
ready to move. Request supporting fire.

872
01:38:34,154 --> 01:38:35,473
Ow!

873
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:20,458
Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai elohenu...
Adonai echad.

874
01:39:21,897 --> 01:39:23,856
Amen.

875
01:40:12,999 --> 01:40:15,038
Radio!

876
01:40:17,917 --> 01:40:21,196
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Over.

877
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:26,674
This is Easy Five. Cease fire,
we're preparing to move over the top.

878
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:33,233
- Roger and out. Stryker!
- Yes, sir.

879
01:40:33,431 --> 01:40:37,591
Colonel's ordered that we put up this flag
when the top's secure. Get it there.

880
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:39,950
Aye, aye, sir.

881
01:40:42,988 --> 01:40:44,988
What is this?

882
01:40:45,187 --> 01:40:48,626
Put yours away.
This is the one we're gonna use.

883
01:40:48,827 --> 01:40:54,345
First squad. Find something we can use
as a standard and we'll put this up.

884
01:41:00,902 --> 01:41:04,861
- Conway, you made it.
- I guess that little voice was wrong.

885
01:41:05,061 --> 01:41:07,939
- I feel better.
- I feel better, too.

886
01:41:08,139 --> 01:41:11,738
I never felt so good in my life.
How about a cigarette?

887
01:41:27,532 --> 01:41:30,011
- Is he...?
- Yeah.

888
01:41:30,211 --> 01:41:34,290
If he had to get it
it's the way he'd have wanted.

889
01:41:39,409 --> 01:41:42,247
It's a letter to his kid.

890
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:55,763
"Dear son, I guess none of my letters
have reached you.

891
01:41:55,962 --> 01:41:58,642
"I thought I'd try again as I'm feeling

892
01:41:58,841 --> 01:42:03,840
"that this may be the last
time I can write you.

893
01:42:04,878 --> 01:42:08,558
"For a long time
I've wanted to tell you many things.

894
01:42:08,758 --> 01:42:11,037
"Now that you're a big boy, I will.

895
01:42:12,077 --> 01:42:14,875
"If we'd been together even for a while,

896
01:42:15,075 --> 01:42:20,673
"I could've explained many things
much better than writing them.

897
01:42:20,874 --> 01:42:26,591
"You've gotta take care of your mother,
and love her and make her happy.

898
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:29,790
"Never hurt her or anyone as I did.

899
01:42:31,909 --> 01:42:35,108
"Always do what your heart
tells you is right.

900
01:42:35,308 --> 01:42:40,467
"Maybe someone will write you some day
and tell you about me.

901
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:46,745
"I want you to be like me in some
things, but not like me in others.

902
01:42:46,944 --> 01:42:52,383
"When you grow older and get to know
more about me, you'll see I've failed...

903
01:42:53,821 --> 01:42:56,300
"...in many ways.

904
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:01,258
"This isn't what I wanted
but things just turned out that way.

905
01:43:01,459 --> 01:43:04,578
"If there was only more time I..."

906
01:43:08,297 --> 01:43:10,616
Guess he never finished it.

907
01:43:18,973 --> 01:43:22,091
I'll finish it for him.

908
01:43:30,249 --> 01:43:32,648
There she goes.

909
01:44:24,949 --> 01:44:28,388
All right, saddle up!
Let's get back in the war!

910
01:44:29,305 --> 01:45:29,801
