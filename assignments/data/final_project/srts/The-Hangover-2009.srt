1
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,234
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Doug. Sorry I missed your call.</i>

2
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,470
<i>Please leave a name and number</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

3
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,552
<i>Hi, you've reached...</i>

4
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,472
<i>...Dr. Stuart Price with Divine Dentistry.</i>

5
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,870
<i>Please leave a message after...</i>

6
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,513
<i>Hey, this is Phil.</i>

7
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,592
<i>Leave me a message or don 't.</i>
<i>Do me a favor, don 't text me. It's gay.</i>

8
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,479
- Anything?
- I tried them all.

9
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,631
It keeps going straight to voicemail.

10
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,472
Well, there has to be an explanation.

11
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,313
Sweetie, it's Vegas.
You lose track of time in casinos.

12
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,711
There's no windows, there's no clocks.
He's probably on a heater.

13
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,873
And you never walk away from the table
when you're on a heater.

14
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,792
You do if you're getting married.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,070
- Hello?
- Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,193
Phil, where the hell are you guys?

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,510
<i>I'm freaking out.</i>

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,033
Yeah, listen.

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,599
Uh...

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,995
We fucked up.

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,912
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,878
The bachelor party,
the whole night. It...

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,918
Things got out of control, uh...

24
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,193
...and we lost Doug.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,999
- What?
- We can't find Doug.

26
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,436
What are you saying, Phil?
We're getting married in five hours.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,638
Yeah.

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,796
That's not gonna happen.

29
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,118
To my left a little.

30
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,838
Thank you.

31
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,389
Okey-dokey.

32
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,073
- Whoa, watch it, pervert!
- Alan, he's just doing your inseam.

33
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,633
- He's getting very close to my shaft.
- All done. You can change now.

34
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,031
Right. Thanks, Floyd.
Thank you very much.

35
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,036
All right, buddy,
we should get a move on.

36
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,113
You know, Doug, I was thinking...

37
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,272
If you wanna go to Vegas without me,
that is totally cool, you know?

38
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,112
What are you talking about?

39
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,636
You know, Phil and Stu, they're your
buddies, and it's your bachelor party.

40
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,791
Come on, Alan. Those two love you.

41
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,758
And also, I don't want you to feel
like you have to hold back...

42
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,229
...because your wife's brother's there.
I just...

43
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,231
It's not like that.

44
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,271
It's not like that.
I already told you, Alan.

45
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,353
Okay? We're just spending the night
in Vegas. It's no big deal.

46
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,513
Besides, you're not just my wife's
brother, you're my brother now.

47
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,471
I want you to know, Doug,
I'm a steel trap.

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,758
Whatever happens tonight, I will
never, ever, ever, speak a word of it.

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,480
Okay. Yeah, I got it. Thank you.
I don't think that...

50
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,473
Seriously. I don't care what happens.

51
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,229
- I don't care if we kill someone.
- What?

52
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,789
You heard me. It's Sin City.

53
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,071
I won't tell a soul.

54
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,836
Okay. I got it.

55
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,798
Thank you.
No, thank you.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,991
I love you so much.

57
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,191
No. Sid.

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,915
- Really?
- Come on, we're family now.

59
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,075
- You sure? I mean, you love this car.
- Doug, it's just a car.

60
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,392
Just make sure to put some Armor All
on the tires so the sand doesn't seep in.

61
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,710
Absolutely. That's easy.

62
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,553
Oh, and, uh, don't let Alan drive...

63
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,392
...because there's
something wrong with him.

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,950
- Understood.
- Oh, and Phil either. I don't like him.

65
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,432
I will be the only one driving this car.
I promise.

66
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,589
Good.

67
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,672
Remember, what happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas.

68
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,229
Ah!

69
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,792
Except for herpes.
That shit'll come back with you.

70
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,509
All right. Hold on. I still need
some of your permission slips...

71
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,036
...and $90 for the field trip to the
Griffith Observatory next weekend.

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,034
Pay now, or forever regret missing out
on the experience of a lifetime, guys.

73
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,315
You're good, you got it.

74
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,471
- Thanks, Mr. Wenneck.
- Thank you, Russ.

75
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,631
Thanks. Thanks, Bobbitt, way to go.

76
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,949
Hold on, I got it.

77
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,680
Ahem, do you have to park so close?

78
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,559
- Yeah. What's wrong?
- I shouldn't be here.

79
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,755
Why is that, Alan?

80
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,196
I'm not supposed to be within 200 feet
of a school.

81
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,592
- What?
- Or a Chuck E. Cheese.

82
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,911
- Mr. Wenneck, I was...
- It's the weekend.

83
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,911
I don't know you. You do not exist.

84
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,792
- Shit.
- Heh, heh, heh.

85
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,552
- Nice car.
- Yeah.

86
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,709
I'm driving.

87
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,313
Whoa, no chance,
buddy... Don't step...

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,469
God. Watch the leath...

89
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,313
Shut up and drive before these nerds
ask me another question.

90
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,038
- Animal.
- Who's this?

91
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,237
- It's Alan. Tracy's brother.
- I met you, like, four times.

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,595
Oh, yeah. How you doing, man?

93
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,032
Don't forget your Rogaine.

94
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,399
Rogaine, check.

95
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,676
And don't forget to use it.

96
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,991
I can totally tell when you forget,
your hair just looks thinner.

97
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,558
Using of the Rogaine, check.

98
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,154
Make sure to call me
right when you get to the hotel...

99
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,754
...not like that conference in Phoenix.

100
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,309
I had to wait two hours
for you to call me.

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,040
Yeah, I was the keynote speaker.
I was late to the podium.

102
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,272
- Still?
- Yeah, you're totally right. I'm sorry.

103
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,115
- What is the matter?
- I don't know.

104
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,919
I hope you're not gonna go to
some strip club when you're up there.

105
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,640
Melissa, we're going to Napa Valley.

106
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,314
I don't even think they have strip clubs
in wine country.

107
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,268
Well, I'm sure if there is one,
Phil will sniff it out.

108
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,592
It's not gonna be like that.

109
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,557
Besides, you know how I feel about that.

110
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,474
I know, I know. It's just boys
and their bachelor parties, it's gross.

111
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,200
You're right, it is gross.

112
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,351
- Not to mention it's pathetic.
- Mm-hm.

113
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,398
- Those places are filthy.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,595
And the worst part is...

115
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,514
...that little girl...

116
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,229
...grinding and dry humping
the fucking stage up there...

117
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,952
...that's somebody's daughter up there.
- I was just gonna say that.

118
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,998
See? I just wish your friends
were as mature as you.

119
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,277
They are mature, actually. You just
have to get to know them better.

120
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,159
Paging Dr. Faggot.

121
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,594
Dr. Faggot!

122
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,157
- I should go.
- That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot.

123
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,638
Have a good weekend.
I'm gonna miss you.

124
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,149
Whoo!

125
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,595
Road trip!

126
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,796
Vegas! Vegas, baby!

127
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,995
Vegas!

128
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,238
You're nuts!

129
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,954
Come on, just till Barstow.
Everybody's passing us.

130
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,796
Absolutely not. I promised Sid.
I will be the only one driving this car.

131
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,075
Besides, you're drinking.

132
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,277
Oh, what are you, a cop now?
You know I drive great when I'm drunk.

133
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,398
True. Don't forget, Phil was always
our designated drunk driver.

134
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,835
Yeah. You wanna explain it
to them, Alan?

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,992
Guys, my dad loves this car
more than he loves me, so, yeah.

136
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,277
Aw, whatever. I left my wife and kid
at home so I could go with you guys.

137
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,829
- You know how difficult that was?
- That's really sweet.

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,911
- Yeah.
- Dude, I was being sarcastic.

139
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,115
I fucking hate my life.

140
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,032
I may never go back.
I might stay in Vegas.

141
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,474
Here we go.

142
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,551
Doug, enjoy yourself,
because come Sunday...

143
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,951
...you're gonna start dying
just a little bit every day.

144
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,829
Yeah. That's why I've managed to stay
single this whole time, you know?

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,719
- Oh, really? That's why you're single?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,758
Cool. Good to know.

147
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,149
- Am I all right over there, Alan?
- Yeah, you're good.

148
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,233
Aw, Jesus Christ!

149
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,119
- Oh, my God!
- That was awesome!

150
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,475
That was not awesome.
What's wrong with you?

151
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,192
- That was insane. We almost just died.
- You should have seen your face.

152
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,635
- Classic.
- That's funny. Ha-ha.

153
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,472
It's not funny.

154
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,159
- Boy, you've got a sweet ride there.
- Don't touch it.

155
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,751
Don't even look at it. Go on, get out.

156
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,832
You heard me.
Don't look at me, either.

157
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,797
Yeah, you better walk on.

158
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,032
- He's actually kind of funny.
- Yeah, he means well.

159
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,475
I'll hit an old man in public.

160
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,519
Is he all there? Like, mentally?

161
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,638
I think so. He's just an odd guy.
You know, he's kind of weird.

162
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,358
- I mean, should we be worried?
- No.

163
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,919
- All right.
- No.

164
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,788
Tracy did mention
that we shouldn't let him gamble.

165
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,509
Or drink too much.

166
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,355
Jesus, he's like a gremlin.
Comes with instructions and shit.

167
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,590
And one water.

168
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,792
- All good with Melissa?
- Oh, yeah.

169
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,080
Told her we're two hours outside of
wine country, and she bought it.

170
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,118
You think it's strange you've been
in a relationship for years...

171
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,872
...and you have to lie about Vegas?

172
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,634
Yeah, I do.
But trust me, it's not worth the fight.

173
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,518
Oh, so you can't go to Vegas...

174
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,797
...but she can fuck a bellhop
on a Carnival Cruise Line?

175
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,949
Hey.

176
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,476
Okay, first of all, he was a bartender.

177
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,789
And she was wasted.

178
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,275
And, if you must know,
he didn't even come inside her.

179
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,875
And you believe that?

180
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,478
Uh, yeah, I do believe that,
because she's grossed out by semen.

181
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,114
That'll be 32.50.

182
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,316
It's 32.50, you gonna pay for it?

183
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,353
It says here we should work in teams.
Who wants to be my spotter?

184
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,035
I don't think you should be doing
too much gambling tonight, Alan.

185
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,077
Gambling?
Who said anything about gambling?

186
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,390
It's not gambling
when you know you're gonna win.

187
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,357
Counting cards is a foolproof system.

188
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,999
It's also illegal.

189
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,597
It's not illegal, it's frowned upon,
like masturbating on an airplane.

190
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,032
I'm pretty sure that's illegal too.

191
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,317
Yeah, maybe after 9/11,
where everybody got so sensitive.

192
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,754
Thanks a lot, Bin Laden.

193
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,837
Either way, you gotta be super smart
to count cards, buddy, okay?

194
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,194
- Oh, really?
- It's not easy.

195
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,351
Well maybe we should tell that
to <i>Rain Man...</i>

196
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,432
...because he practically bankrupted
a casino, and he was a retard.

197
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,715
What?

198
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,469
He was a retard.

199
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,509
Retard.

200
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,352
Here we go.

201
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,474
Hi, welcome to Caesars.

202
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,789
- Hello.
- Checking in?

203
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,235
Yeah. We have a reservation
under Dr. Price.

204
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,470
Okay, let me look that up for you.

205
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,755
Dr. Price?

206
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,708
Stu, you're a dentist, okay?
Don't try and get fancy.

207
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,112
- It's not fancy if it's true.
- He's a dentist. Don't get too excited.

208
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,078
And if, uh, someone has a heart attack,
you should still call 911.

209
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,878
We'll be sure to do that.

210
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,237
Can I ask you a question? Do you
know if the hotel's pager-friendly?

211
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,198
- What do you mean?
- I'm not getting a sig on my beeper.

212
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,478
- I'm not sure.
- Is there a payphone bank?

213
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,518
Bunch of payphones? Business.

214
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,151
Um, there's a phone in your room.

215
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,149
That'll work.

216
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,997
So I have you in a two-bedroom suite
on the 12th floor, is that okay?

217
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,434
It sounds perfect.

218
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,875
Actually, I was wondering
if you had any villas.

219
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,508
- We're not even gonna be in the room.
- It's unnecessary.

220
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,716
No big deal. We can share beds.
It's one night.

221
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,836
If we're share beds,
I'm bunking with Phil.

222
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,717
- You good with that?
- No, I'm not.

223
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,156
Guys, we are not sharing beds.
What are we, 12 years old?

224
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,231
Lisa, I apologize.
How much is the villa?

225
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,233
Well, we have one villa available,
and it's 4200 for the night.

226
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,436
- Is it awesome?
- It's pretty awesome.

227
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,639
- We'll take it. Give her your credit card.
- I can't give her my credit card.

228
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,110
- We'll split it.
- Are you crazy? No, this is on us.

229
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,278
You don't get it.
Melissa checks my statements.

230
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,998
We just need a credit card on file.

231
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,118
We won't charge you until check out,
so you can figure it out then.

232
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,636
That's perfect. Thank you, Lisa.
We'll deal with it tomorrow. Come on.

233
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,153
Fine.

234
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,756
- Can I ask you another question?
- Sure.

235
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,194
You probably get this a lot.

236
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,430
This isn't the real Caesars Palace,
is it?

237
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,949
What do you mean?

238
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,553
Did, uh...

239
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,439
- Did Caesar live here?
- Um, no.

240
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,151
I didn't think so.

241
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,397
Holy shit.

242
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,278
Now, this is Vegas.

243
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,797
Oh, my... This place is enormous.

244
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,995
Now we're talking.

245
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,915
Is this all one suite?

246
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,153
Thank you, guys.

247
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,117
Or should I say, "Thank you, Stu"?

248
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,271
You're welcome.
It's only because I love you.

249
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,357
Okay, ladies, pick a room, get
dressed. Let's be ready in 30 minutes.

250
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,155
I just wish you could see this place,
because you, of all people, would love it.

251
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,471
Yeah. No, it's so quaint.

252
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,591
Yeah, no, there's no TVs, no phones.

253
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,639
They just have these cute little antique
radios in all the rooms.

254
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,358
Yeah.

255
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,878
What else? Um...

256
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,550
We met the, uh, proprietor.

257
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,029
- Oh, I bet you...
- What's his name?

258
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,394
Um, Caesar. Palacč.

259
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,997
Yeah, like the salad.

260
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,349
Okay. Well, listen, I gotta go, because
we're gonna hit this wine tasting.

261
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,638
Wait, wait. I love you. Okay. Bye.

262
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm not even gonna say anything,
it's so embarrassing.

263
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,030
- Where's Alan?
- He, uh, he went downstairs.

264
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,111
He said he had to grab a few things.

265
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,229
Good, because I have something
to show you.

266
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,954
Uh-Oh.

267
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,031
- What the hell is that?
- What do you think?

268
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,317
If it's what I think it is,
I think it's a big fucking mistake.

269
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,997
I'm gonna propose to Melissa
at your wedding. After the ceremony.

270
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,470
- Stuey, congratulations!
- Thank you, Doug.

271
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,560
- That's a beautiful ring.
- Yeah. It's my grandmother's.

272
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,518
She made it all the way through
the Holocaust with that thing.

273
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,433
Wait, have you not listened
to anything I have ever said?

274
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,876
Phil, we've been dating for three years.
It's time. This is how it works.

275
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,191
A, that is bullshit.
And B, she is a complete bitch.

276
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,430
Hey, that's his fiancée.

277
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,876
What? It's true. It's true.
You know it's true. She beats him.

278
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,873
That was twice, and I was out of line.

279
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,349
She's strong-willed. And I respect that.

280
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,317
Wow. Wow.

281
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,199
He's in denial.
Not to mention, she fucked a sailor.

282
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,588
Hey, he wasn't a sailor.

283
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,039
He was a bartender on a cruise ship.
You know that.

284
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,318
Guys, I'm standing right here. So I can
hear everything that you're saying.

285
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,550
Hey, guys.
You ready to let the dogs out?

286
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,119
- What?
- Do what?

287
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,599
Let the dogs out. You know.

288
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,589
Who brought this guy?

289
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,876
Yes, Alan, we are ready
to let the dogs out.

290
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,838
- Hey, congrats.
- Thank you.

291
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,116
I love this fucking town.

292
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,914
- You're not really wearing that, are you?
- Wearing what?

293
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,832
The man-purse.

294
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,833
You're actually gonna wear that
or are you guys fucking with me?

295
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,992
It's where I keep all my things.
I get a lot of compliments on this.

296
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,310
Plus, it's not a man-purse.
It's called a satchel.

297
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,595
Indiana Jones wears one.

298
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,954
So does Joy Behar.

299
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,629
- We're going up, guys.
- Yeah, that's perfect.

300
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,392
Really?

301
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,118
We're going up?

302
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,359
I'm just saying,
it's clearly marked, okay?

303
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,511
We are definitely
not supposed to be up here.

304
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,797
Come on, we're paying for a villa.
We can do whatever the fuck we want.

305
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,871
- Yeah, but...
- Just wedge the door open.

306
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,235
- Guys, come on up here.
- Fine.

307
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,309
How the hell did you find this place?

308
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,913
Don't worry about it.

309
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,593
Oh!

310
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,914
- You all right?
- Yeah.

311
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,390
- Look at the view up here.
- You happy?

312
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,754
- This is great.
- Whoa!

313
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,069
Are you kidding?

314
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,515
- Alan, how we doing, buddy?
- Good.

315
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,999
What do you got
over there, Alan?

316
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,388
That's the Eiffel Tower.

317
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,469
Uh-oh.

318
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,278
- Right?
- A little Jägermeister.

319
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,998
- Good idea.
- There it is. Good call.

320
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,195
On the roof.

321
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,114
Um, no, this is good.
I'd like to make a toast.

322
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,191
To Doug and Tracy.

323
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,999
May tonight be...

324
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,356
...but a minor speed bump...

325
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
...in an otherwise very long
and healthy marriage.

326
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,639
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

327
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,789
Short and sweet.

328
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,154
Oh, it's like college.

329
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,629
- All right. I wanna talk about something.
- All right.

330
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,074
- I want to...
- I'd like to...

331
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,115
I'd like to say something...

332
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,792
...that I prepared...

333
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,555
...tonight.
- All right, Alan.

334
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,199
"Hello.

335
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,556
How about that ride in?

336
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,756
I guess that's why they call it
Sin City.

337
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,790
You guys might not know this,
but I consider myself a bit of a loner.

338
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,032
I tend to think of myself
as a one-man wolf pack.

339
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,076
But when my sister brought Doug home,
I knew he was one of my own.

340
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,675
And my wolf pack, it grew by one.

341
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,513
So were there two... So there
were two of us in the wolf pack.

342
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,798
I was alone first in the pack,
and then Doug joined in later.

343
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,278
And six months ago...

344
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,398
...when Doug introduced me
to you guys, I thought:

345
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,394
'Wait a second. Could it be?'
And now, I know for sure.

346
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,028
I just added two more guys
to my wolf pack."

347
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,316
- All right.
- All right.

348
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,959
"Four of us wolves...

349
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,874
...running around the desert together
in Las Vegas...

350
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,395
...Iooking for strippers and cocaine."

351
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,549
So tonight...

352
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,669
...I make a toast.
- Whoa.

353
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,637
- What...?
- What do you got there?

354
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,189
- Dude, what the fuck?
- What the hell are you doing?

355
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,559
- What is that?
- Blood brothers.

356
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,153
- Don't... Why did you...?
- Damn it.

357
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,389
- Here.
- Alan...

358
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,073
- No.
- No, I'm not doing that.

359
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,673
- Go ahead, Stuart.
- Make him stop.

360
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,274
Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves.
Give me the knife.

361
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,079
Slowly. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you very much.

362
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,992
- You all right? Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

363
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,752
- Do you need a doctor?
- He's good.

364
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,148
- You sure?
- I'm good.

365
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,074
- Perfect. Alan, come here, buddy.
- Get in here, crazy.

366
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,870
All right, to a night the four of us
will never forget.

367
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,874
- There it is.
- Hear, hear.

368
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,917
Hey, thanks, guys.

369
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,949
Hm.

370
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,156
Stupid tiger.

371
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,278
What the fuck?

372
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,198
Control yourself, man.
Goddamn, will you put on some pants?

373
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,158
- Phil, do not go in the bathroom.
- AI, just calm down. It's me.

374
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,629
Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom.

375
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,360
- What's going on?
- There's a jungle cat in the bathroom!

376
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,909
- Okay, okay, Al. Al, I'll check it out.
- Don't go in.

377
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,719
Don't go in, don't go in.
Be careful. Don't, don't.

378
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,028
- Oh! Holy fuck! He's not kidding.
- See? See?

379
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,430
- There's a tiger in there.
- No, there isn't.

380
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,874
Yeah!

381
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,396
- It's big. Gigantic.
- You okay, buddy?

382
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,949
No. I am in so much pain right now.

383
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,430
Goddamn. Look at this place.

384
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,589
Whew.

385
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,912
I know. Phil, they have my credit card
downstairs. I am so screwed.

386
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,640
How does a tiger get in the bathroom?
It almost killed me.

387
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,552
Hey, bro?
You mind putting on some pants?

388
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,711
I find it a little weird
I have to ask twice.

389
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,394
Pants at a time like this?
I don't have any p...

390
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,676
What the fuck happened last night?

391
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,037
Hey, Phil, am I missing a tooth?

392
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,358
I can't... Oh, shit.

393
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,994
Oh, my God.

394
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,991
My lateral incisor's... It's gone!

395
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,278
It's okay. Okay, okay. Just calm down.
We're fine. Everything's fine.

396
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,634
Alan, go wake up Doug.

397
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,109
Let's get some coffee and get
the fuck out of Nevada...

398
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,474
...before housekeeping shows.

399
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,596
What am I gonna tell Melissa?
I lost a tooth.

400
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,079
I have no idea how it happened.

401
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,468
You're freaking me out, man.

402
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,949
I got a massive headache, okay?
Let's just calm down.

403
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,634
How am I supposed to calm down?
Look around you.

404
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,878
- Hey, guys, he's not in there.
- Did you check all the rooms?

405
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,600
Yeah, I looked everywhere.
Plus, his mattress is gone.

406
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,069
He probably went to the pool
to get something to eat.

407
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,639
I'll just call his cell.

408
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,110
I look like a nerdy hillbilly.

409
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,798
- Hello?
- Alan.

410
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,109
Hey.

411
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,514
- It's Phil.
- Oh, hey, Phi...

412
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,037
This is Doug's phone.
This is Doug's phone.

413
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,189
- No shit.
- Yeah.

414
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,109
What the fuck is that?

415
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,873
Whose fucking baby is that?

416
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,634
Alan, are you sure you didn't see
anyone else in the suite?

417
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,791
Yeah, I checked all the rooms.
No one's here.

418
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,155
Check its collar or something.

419
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,117
Shh. Shh.

420
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,748
- It's okay, baby.
- Stu, we don't have time for this.

421
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,514
Let's go hook up with Doug,
we'll deal with the baby later.

422
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,716
Phil, we're not gonna leave a baby
in the room.

423
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,633
- There's a fucking tiger in the bathroom.
- It's not our baby.

424
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,631
Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one.

425
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,756
All right, fine.
Okay, we'll take it with us.

426
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,036
Could you at least just find some pants?

427
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,835
Why can't we remember a
goddamn thing from last night?

428
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,355
Because we obviously
had a great fucking time.

429
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,072
Why don't you just stop worrying
for one minute.

430
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,753
Be proud of yourself.

431
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,149
Oh, how cute. What's his name?

432
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,914
- Ben.
- Carlos.

433
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,878
Carlos?

434
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,313
Thank you.

435
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,275
Hey, Phil, look.

436
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,478
He's jacking his little weenis.

437
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,197
- Pull yourself together, man.
- Not at the table, Carlos.

438
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,994
I looked everywhere.

439
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,277
Gym, casino, front desk.
Nobody's seen Doug. He's not here.

440
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,839
He's fine. He's a grown man.

441
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,958
Seriously, Stu, you gotta calm down.
Here, have some juice.

442
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,954
I can't have juice right now.

443
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,588
Okay. All right.
Let's just track this thing.

444
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,270
What's the last thing
we remember doing last night?

445
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,510
Well, the first thing was
we were on the roof...

446
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,238
...and were having those shots of Jäger.

447
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,551
And then we ate dinner
at The Palm. Right?

448
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,709
That's right.

449
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,395
And then we played craps at the
Hard Rock, and I think Doug was there.

450
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,710
That sounds right.
No, no. He definitely was.

451
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,599
You know what, guys?
I don't even remember going to dinner.

452
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,479
What the fuck? I don't think
I've ever been this hung-over.

453
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,790
After the Hard Rock, I blacked out.
It was like emptiness.

454
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,437
Okay. We have up until 10 p. m...

455
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,717
...so that gives us a 12-hour window
where we could have lost him.

456
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,714
- What is this?
- Oh, my God. That is my tooth.

457
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,792
Why do you have that?
What else is in your pockets?

458
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,918
This is a good thing. No. Check
your pockets. Check your pockets.

459
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,513
Do you have anything?

460
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,638
I have an ATM receipt
from the Bellagio.

461
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,909
Eleven-oh-five for $800!
I am so fucked.

462
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,119
I have a valet ticket from Caesars.
- 15 a.m.

463
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,191
Oh, shit. We drove last night?

464
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,272
Driving drunk. Classic.

465
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,192
What's on your arm?

466
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,992
- What the fuck is that?
- Jesus, Phil.

467
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,913
- You were in the hospital last night.
- I guess so, yeah.

468
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,355
- You okay?
- Yeah, Alan. I'm fine.

469
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,272
What the hell is going on?

470
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,954
Well, Stu, Stu, this is a good thing.
We have a lead now.

471
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,553
Hey, Stu, watch this.

472
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,592
- You ever seen a baby do that?
- Dude, Alan, not cool.

473
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,796
So, uh, are you sure you're qualified
to be taking care of that baby?

474
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,757
What? I've found a baby before.

475
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,115
- You found a baby before?
- Yeah.

476
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,918
- Where?
- Coffee Bean.

477
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,679
Wait, what?

478
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,832
Hey, Phil? I don't think Doug
would want us to take the Mercedes.

479
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,035
Relax, we'll be careful.

480
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,668
My dad is crazy about that car.
He left Doug in charge...

481
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,990
Alan. We got bigger problems here.

482
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,991
Doug could be in the hospital,
he could be hurt.

483
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,756
- Let's worry about the car later.
- Uh, guys? Check it out.

484
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,311
All right, grab it from the other side.

485
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,391
Is that the mattress from Doug's room?

486
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,876
What the fuck?

487
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,070
Hey, man, what's going on here?

488
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,437
Some asshole threw his bed
out the window last night.

489
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,830
- No shit.
- Yeah.

490
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,911
Some guys just can't handle Vegas.

491
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,389
Ha-ha.

492
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,237
Oh, God.

493
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,112
It's gonna be okay, Stu.

494
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,353
How the hell did we manage that?

495
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,957
- Here's your car, officers.
- Oh, God.

496
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,873
All right, everybody act cool.
All right, don't say a word.

497
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,191
Come on, let's just get in and go.
Come on.

498
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,589
- Stu, you got a five?
- No.

499
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,795
- I'll hit you on the way back.
- Thank you, sir.

500
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,269
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

501
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,870
You just nailed the baby.

502
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,029
Are my glasses okay?

503
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,399
Your glasses are fine, dick.

504
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,757
This is so illegal.

505
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,077
Can't you see the fun part in anything?

506
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,635
Yeah, we're stuck in traffic
in a stolen police car...

507
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,711
...with a missing child
in the back seat.

508
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,313
Which part of this is fun?

509
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,119
- I think the cop-car part's pretty cool.
- Thank you, Alan. It is cool.

510
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,032
Doug would love it.

511
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,433
Come on.

512
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,720
- Check this out.
- Oh, no. No, Phil. No, Phil.

513
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,869
Don't do this!

514
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,235
- Take it easy.
- Just try to call more attention to us.

515
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,674
- Attention.
- Sorry.

516
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,717
Attention, please. Move out of the way.

517
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,313
I repeat, please disperse.

518
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,075
Phil, stop the car, I wanna get out.
Stop the car, I wanna get out. Pull over.

519
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,438
Ma'am, in the leopard dress,
you have an amazing rack.

520
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,590
Get off the sidewalk!
Get off the sidewalk!

521
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,159
I should have been a fucking cop.

522
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,914
Look, I already told you.

523
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,117
You came in with a mild concussion,
some bruised ribs. No big deal.

524
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,669
Although none of you could articulate
how it happened.

525
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,195
Do you remember how many of us
were here?

526
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,588
Ah...

527
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,196
I don't know. I think it was just
you guys. Definitely no baby.

528
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,830
- And one other guy.
- That's our guy. Was he okay?

529
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,879
Yeah. He was fine. Just whacked
out of his mind. You all were.

530
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,555
All right, come forward.
And turn.

531
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,709
All right.

532
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,915
There you go. And cough.

533
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,755
Cough. Cough. Give me one more.

534
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,950
All right. Thattaboy.

535
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,678
Okay, Felix, you can put your robe on.

536
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,876
And the nurse will be in here
in a minute.

537
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,076
I'll see you after the weekend.

538
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,038
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.

539
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,636
Guys, I really gotta go. I'm sorry.
I have a surgery up on the fourth floor.

540
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,477
No, I know. But we just need
a couple more minutes of your time.

541
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,038
Yeah. Tuck it right in there.
I don't want to re-sterilize.

542
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,792
Walk with me.

543
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,120
Okay, here we go. Patient name,
Phil Wenneck, 2:45 a.m. arrival.

544
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,033
Minor concussion, like I said.
Some bruising. Pretty standard.

545
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,191
Do you mind if I look?
I'm actually a doctor.

546
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,638
Yeah, you said that several times last
night. But really, you're just a dentist.

547
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,592
Okay, this is interesting.
Your blood work came in this morning.

548
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,398
Wow.

549
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,317
They found a large amount of Ruphylin
in your system.

550
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,156
Ruphylin. Roofies.
Commonly known as the date-rape drug.

551
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,959
What, so, what are you saying,
I was raped last night?

552
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,199
Actually...

553
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,191
I don't think so.
But someone did slip you the drug.

554
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,839
I'm not surprised
you don't remember anything.

555
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,311
Doc, none of us can remember anything
from last night. Remember?

556
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,595
Yeah. How could someone
have drugged all of us?

557
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,909
I wouldn't worry about it.

558
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,674
The stuff's out of your system.
You're gonna be fine.

559
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,434
Wait, wait, wait. Please, doctor.
Is there anything else?

560
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,114
Like, something we
may have been talking about...

561
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,759
...or some place we were going?

562
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,638
Actually, there was something.

563
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,109
You guys kept talking about
some wedding last night.

564
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,794
Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug's
getting married tomorrow.

565
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,190
- You know what? I want the 100 back.
- No, no. Easy.

566
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,794
You kept talking about some wedding
you just came from.

567
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,234
At the, uh, Best Little Chapel.

568
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,710
You kept saying how sick the wedding
was and getting all crazy about it.

569
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,996
Okay, I hope this helps.
I really have to leave.

570
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,435
Best Little Chapel,
do you know where that is?

571
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,275
I do. It's at the corner of Get A Map
and Fuck Off.

572
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,997
I'm a doctor, not a tour guide.

573
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,197
Figure it out yourself, okay?
You're big boys.

574
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,829
What about the baby?

575
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,150
Leave him in the car.
We're gonna be five minutes.

576
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,072
Whoa, we're not leaving
a baby in the car.

577
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,800
He'll be fine. I cracked the window.

578
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,598
- What if they don't remember us?
- Well, let's just find out.

579
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,998
I'm sor... Excuse me, sir? Hi.

580
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,474
Look at these guys.

581
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,789
What happened?
You miss me?

582
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,598
You miss Eddie?
You want more from me?

583
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,957
How are you, my friend?
Look at this guy. You're fucking crazy.

584
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,109
What's going on, man?

585
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,831
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.
I know some sick people in my life.

586
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,471
This guy is the craziest, wildest bastard
I ever met in my life, man.

587
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,392
- This guy?
- This guy is out of his mind.

588
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,949
What's going on,
you fucking crazy motherfucker?

589
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,156
I thought he was gonna eat my dick.

590
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,754
What happened?
No love for Eddie? You don't hug me?

591
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,911
No, no. It's not that, Eddie.

592
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,640
Uh, it's just that we're having
a hard time remembering...

593
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,313
...what happened here last night.

594
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,948
Yeah, was there a wedding here?
Do you do weddings here?

595
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,477
You are cracking my balls, man.

596
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,234
Obviously we were here.
We're looking for our friend Doug.

597
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,755
- Do you remember?
- Yeah, the small guy. Like a monkey.

598
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,035
- Yeah.
- You saw him?

599
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,189
Of course.

600
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,750
Is there anything you can tell us about
what may have happened last night?

601
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,033
You don't remember nothing?

602
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,559
- Congratulations, Stu, you got married.
- This... This can't be happening.

603
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,796
- Oh, God.
- Look at that.

604
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,871
I'll tell you one thing,
you look seriously happy here, man.

605
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,357
That's it. My life is over.

606
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,192
Stu, it's okay. Look, shit happens.

607
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,749
Come on. Melissa's not gonna know
anything about this.

608
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,878
- This never happened. I'll take care of it.
- Come on. Put it here.

609
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,029
Hey, what's all that?

610
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,034
The High Roller package. It's what
you ordered. I have coffee mugs.

611
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,236
- What?
- You have baseball caps, huh?

612
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,676
And fancy calendars, all with pictures
of Stu and Jade.

613
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,875
Her name's Jade?

614
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,157
Yeah, and she's beautiful, man.
Clean, very tight. Tits like that.

615
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,993
- But that's because she had a baby.
- That explains the baby.

616
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,230
- Oh, Carlos. Carlos.
- Great. All right.

617
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,391
Uh, here's the deal.
We made a mistake last night.

618
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,755
We need this marriage annulled.
You do annulments?

619
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,514
Of course I do. It breaks my heart
and gonna make me sad...

620
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,557
...but it's no problem.
Good price for you.

621
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,269
I can't do it with just him, though.
I need the chick. I need both parties.

622
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,874
Oh, not a problem. That's great.
Isn't that great, Stu?

623
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,270
Come on, buddy.
She probably knows where Doug is.

624
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,079
- Awesome.
- All right, all right. Okay. Uh...

625
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,519
We need her address.
She filled out some paperwork, right?

626
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,669
Of course.

627
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,876
Hey. Excuse me.
What is the matter with you?

628
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,473
Go and get the paperwork, man.

629
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,312
I spend my life waiting for you.
Come on.

630
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,469
Okay. I'm going.

631
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,676
And get the baklava, please.

632
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,679
- Hey, Phil, what about my dad's car?
- I'm sure Doug has it. We'll get it back.

633
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,718
Then I vote we torch the cop car
and all this shit with it.

634
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,594
- Torch it? Who are you?
- I don't know, Phil.

635
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,069
Apparently I'm a guy who marries
complete strangers.

636
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,031
This whole situation
is completely fucked.

637
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,630
- These mugs. This hat. This car.
- Hey!

638
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,678
It's all evidence
of a night that never happened.

639
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,910
That is why we're torching all of it.

640
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,389
Whoa, I'm a schoolteacher,
I got a family, okay?

641
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,120
I'm all for secrecy,
but I'm not gonna torch a cop car.

642
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,032
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Can I help?

643
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,599
Yeah, thanks.

644
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,989
- Is it Doug?
- I don't have it.

645
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,479
It's Doug, it's Doug.

646
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,868
Uh, it's Melissa.

647
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,429
- Don't answer.
- I have to. She's called twice already!

648
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,715
- Can I ride shotgun?
- Don't touch me.

649
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,791
Hey, sweetheart, how are you?

650
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,032
There you are.
This is the third time I'm trying you.

651
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,078
I know. The reception up here's crazy.

652
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,879
I think it's all the sequoia trees,
block the signal.

653
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,838
Ugh, I hate that.
So how was it last night?

654
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,833
Ah, it was really fun, actually.
It was quiet, but it was a good time.

655
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,474
<i>That sounds nice.</i>

656
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,915
- I'm learning all kinds of vino factoids.
- Hi.

657
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,314
lt'd be so cool if I could breast-feed,
you know?

658
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,515
Well, listen...

659
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,274
...we're about to go for a tractor ride.
- What the fuck?

660
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,750
- I should get going. So pretty.
- <i>A tractor ride?</i>

661
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,877
- Go, out of the car!
- What was that?

662
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,315
They started up the tractor.
I think it backfired.

663
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,550
- Where the hell is he?
- Hey, easy, easy.

664
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,029
I think we're looking for
the same guy, okay?

665
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,274
Hey! What the hell, man?

666
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,955
What the fuck, Stu?
Is that a baby?

667
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,953
Why would there be a baby?
We're at a winery. That's a goat.

668
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,348
Where is he?

669
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,953
I don't know!
What are you talking about?

670
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,998
Sir, can you please start the tractor
so we can get out of here?

671
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,991
I'm trying to, but we're fucking blocked.

672
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,628
Oh, my God!
What the hell is happening, Stu?

673
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,997
- Hey! There's a baby on board!
- Someone just said "baby."

674
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,151
- Get out of the car!
- It's a baby goat.

675
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,356
Why you making trouble
for my business, man?

676
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,317
- Go away from here.
- Get out of the car!

677
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,516
- Phil, he's got a gun!
- No shit he's got a gun!

678
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,796
- I gotta call you back. Bye.
- Come on.

679
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,153
- Fuck! Shit.
- He shot me!

680
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,550
- He shot Eddie!
- Fuck this shit!

681
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,591
Fuck! Fuck!

682
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,508
Go, go, go!

683
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,749
Fuck.

684
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,831
Okay. Oh, that was some sick shit!

685
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,149
Who were those guys?

686
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,311
We're gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

687
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,232
What the fuck is going on?!

688
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,309
I have no idea.

689
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,871
Why don't you just let that
go to voicemail?

690
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,519
Ha-ha-ha.

691
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,113
That's a fake laugh, by the way.

692
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,997
It's got, uh, Ted Danson and Magnum
P.I. and that Jewish actor.

693
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,718
Shut up, Alan.

694
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,189
- What room was it again?
- It's 825.

695
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,669
I know, I did. I already checked with her.

696
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,038
I found him, I'll call you back.
Thank God, he's with his father.

697
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,988
I was freaking out.
I missed you, sweetie.

698
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,390
And I miss you.

699
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,393
No.

700
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,398
What the hell happened
to you guys?

701
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,516
Actually, we were hoping
you could tell us.

702
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,478
What do you mean? I got up this
morning, I went to get coffee...

703
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,551
...and I came back and you were gone.

704
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,869
- Why are you being so quiet?
- I'm not being quiet.

705
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,958
Ha, ha. You're so cute.

706
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,112
Yeah, I gotta feed Tyler.
Come inside, you guys.

707
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,268
Did you hear that? Baby's name is Tyler.

708
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,637
Yeah. I thought he looked
more like a Carlos too, bud.

709
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,276
Okay, what's up?
You guys are acting weird.

710
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,238
- Look, it's Jade, right?
- Very funny, Phil.

711
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,076
Right, Jade, uh, ahem,
you remember our friend, Doug.

712
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,992
Are you kidding? He was the best man.

713
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,799
Exactly. Well, we can't find him,
and we're getting worried.

714
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,838
Oh, my God, that is so Doug.

715
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,592
Ha, ha. Oh.

716
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,350
Oh, sweetie, I'm...
I'm gonna go clean him off.

717
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,431
It's all right, Daddy didn't mean it.

718
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,828
Oh, my God.

719
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,036
What the fuck, man,
you gotta hold it together.

720
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,792
- Holy shit.
- She is super hot.

721
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,111
- You should be proud of yourself.
- She's wearing my grandmother's ring!

722
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,157
- What?
- The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa.

723
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,231
You remember,
my grandmother's Holocaust ring?

724
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,391
- Fuck. Okay.
- She's wearing it.

725
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,154
I didn't know they gave out rings
at the Holocaust.

726
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,196
- He's okay.
- Oh, good.

727
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,237
- He was just hungry, he's fine.
- Oh, good.

728
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,518
About last night, uh, ahem, do you
remember the last time you saw Doug?

729
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,671
Uh, I haven't seen him
since the wedding.

730
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,114
The wedding. Okay. Great.

731
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,431
And, uh, we can't re...
What time was that at?

732
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,989
Well, it was, um...

733
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,356
I guess it was around 1, because I had
to go back to work and finish my shift.

734
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,318
And then when I got out I headed over
to the hotel with Tyler.

735
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,754
And was Doug there then?

736
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,151
I didn't see Doug because you guys were
passed out. The room was a wreck.

737
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,356
- So I just curled up next to Stu.
- Uh-huh.

738
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,158
- Rowr.
- Oh.

739
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,993
I got a question.
Um, you said when your shift ended.

740
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,233
Does that mean you're a nurse?
Or a blackjack dealer?

741
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,440
- You know this. I'm a stripper.
- Mm-hm.

742
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,158
Well, technically I'm an escort...

743
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,197
...but stripping's a great way
to meet the clients.

744
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,351
- Smart.
- Savvy.

745
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,069
But that's all in the past,
now that I married a doctor.

746
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,878
I'm just a dentist.

747
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,593
- Las Vegas Police! Freeze!
- Okay.

748
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,319
Shut that baby up! Shut that baby up!

749
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,074
- Oh, God!
- Okay, okay, okay.

750
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,949
After we take the mug shots,
we bring them down here...

751
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,556
...where they wait to be interviewed
by the arresting officers.

752
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,951
Trust me, kids, you do not
wanna be sitting on these benches.

753
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,111
We call this place Loserville.

754
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,878
Follow me.
All right, let's do it. Come on.

755
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,109
Hello.

756
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,272
- Hey, Tracy! It's Phil.
- <i>Hey, Phil.</i>

757
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,479
- Where are you guys?
- We are at the spa at the hotel.

758
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,438
Cool. We're just getting some sun.
Is Doug around?

759
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,238
Of course. Why wouldn't he be?

760
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,516
I'm just wondering
why you're calling me.

761
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,113
Um...

762
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,431
We made a deal,
no talking to girlfriends or wives.

763
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,831
So we're all calling each other's.

764
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,399
<i>Okay. What's up?</i>

765
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,232
Uh, you are not gonna believe this.

766
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,436
We got comped an extra night
at the hotel.

767
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,589
You did?

768
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,399
<i>Yeah. The suite is... It's ridiculous.</i>
<i>It's out of control.</i>

769
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,348
There's, like, room service and a butler.
I mean, just the works.

770
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,317
We're thinking of spending the night...

771
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,596
...and we're gonna come back
in the morning.

772
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,957
You wanna stay an extra night?
But the wedding's tomorrow.

773
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,476
That's why we're gonna get up early,
and we'll be back in plenty of time.

774
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,835
Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea?

775
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,594
Wenneck, Price, Garner. Room 3.

776
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,910
Okay, Trace, I gotta go.
We'll talk to you later.

777
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,354
Uh...

778
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,470
- Come on, chop-chop.
- Okay, spin around.

779
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,915
- That's it.
- Goddamn it.

780
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,389
- Wait a second.
- I'll go over. I'll go over.

781
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,391
- Stop pulling.
- Can you just...? Hold on.

782
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,199
We got it. Alan, just relax.
And then just... There we go.

783
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,679
Good.

784
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,032
Gentlemen.

785
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,998
We've got some good news,
and we've got some bad news.

786
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,798
The good news is
we found your Mercedes.

787
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,753
- That's great news.
- That's great. See?

788
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,152
Yeah, it's over at impound right now.
We picked it up at 5 a.m. this morning...

789
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,356
...parked in the middle
of Las Vegas Boulevard.

790
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,113
- In the middle. That's weird.
- Yeah, that is weird.

791
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,315
There was also a note.

792
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:21,035
It says, uh, "Couldn't find a meter,
but here's 4 bucks."

793
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,956
The bad news is...

794
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,793
...we can't get you in front of a judge
until Monday morning.

795
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,996
Oh, no, uh, officer,
that's just impossible.

796
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,355
No, we need to be in L.A.
tomorrow for a wedding.

797
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,033
You stole a police car.

798
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,237
We didn't steal anything.
Um, we found it.

799
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,358
Yeah, if anything, we deserve a reward
or something, like a trophy.

800
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,232
- I see assholes like you every day.
- Every fucking day.

801
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,197
"Let's go to Vegas,
we'll all get drunk and laid!

802
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,396
- Yeah. Whoo! Woo-hoo.
- Woo-hoo.

803
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,438
Let's steal a cop car,
because it'd be really fucking funny."

804
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,750
Think you gonna get away with it?
Not up in here.

805
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,911
- Not up in here!
- Oh.

806
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,877
Uh...

807
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,319
Sir...

808
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,999
...if I may, um...

809
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,720
...I'm assuming that that squad car
belongs to one of you.

810
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,518
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

811
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,955
Look, I'm not a cop.

812
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,078
I'm no hero. I'm a schoolteacher.

813
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,191
But if one of my kids went missing
on a field trip...

814
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,712
...that would look really bad on me.

815
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,758
- What are you getting at?
- Yeah, Phil, what are you getting at?

816
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,151
No one wants to look bad.
We gotta get to a wedding...

817
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,470
...and you guys don't need people
talking about...

818
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,519
...how some obnoxious tourists
borrowed your squad car last night.

819
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,478
But look, the point is,
I think we can work out a deal.

820
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,471
Discreetly of course, ma'am.

821
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,634
What do you say?

822
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,914
Let me ask you a question:

823
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,438
Do, uh, any of you gentlemen have a
heart condition or anything like that?

824
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,830
Uh, no.

825
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,468
Okay, kids,
you're in for a real treat today.

826
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,438
These gentlemen have kindly volunteered
to demonstrate...

827
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,239
...how a stun gun is used
to subdue a suspect.

828
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,435
Ooh!

829
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,999
- That's right.
- Wait a sec. What?

830
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,038
Now, there's two ways to use
a stun gun. Up close and personal.

831
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,758
- What the fuck?
- Or you can shoot it from a distance.

832
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,114
Do I have any volunteers?

833
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,111
You wanna come up here
and do some shooting? Huh?

834
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,477
All right, how about you, young lady?
Come on up here. All right.

835
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,358
Let's go, handsome, come on.

836
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,273
Not you, fat Jesus, slide it on back.
You, pretty boy.

837
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,829
Fat Jesus.

838
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,319
All right, now,
it's real simple.

839
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,630
All you gotta do is point,
aim and shoot.

840
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,153
All right?

841
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,278
Okay, look.
You don't really wanna do this.

842
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,635
You can do this. Just focus.

843
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,189
Don't listen to this maniac.
Let's think this through.

844
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,634
Finish him!

845
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,234
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah!

846
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,756
Right in the nuts! That was beautiful.

847
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,949
- Well done. Give her a hand, everybody.
- Good job. Good job.

848
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,993
Good job. Well done. Good job.
That was great.

849
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,238
Good. Hey, we got
one more charge left.

850
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,152
Anybody wanna do some
shooting up here?

851
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,911
How about you, big man?
Come on up here.

852
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,159
Okay, same instructions.
Just point, aim and shoot.

853
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,589
There you go. That's the stuff.

854
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,909
I like the intensity.

855
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,552
Eye of the tiger. Good.

856
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,599
You're holding 50,000 volts, little man.
Don't be afraid to ride the lightning.

857
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,878
In the face! In the face!

858
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,319
Oh, he's still up. He's still up.

859
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,959
- Aah!
- No.

860
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,678
All right, everybody relax, take it easy.

861
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,670
We've seen it before.
He just needs a little extra charge.

862
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,193
There we go.

863
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,514
Some of these big boys,
you gotta give them two shots.

864
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,319
All right, kids, who wants to get
their fingerprints done, huh?

865
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,469
Come on, let's go.

866
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,518
Fuck those guys, you hear me?

867
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,638
That was bullshit.
I'm telling everybody we stole a cop car.

868
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,553
- They let us go, who cares?
- I care!

869
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,709
You can't just do that.

870
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,395
You can't just tase people
because you think it's funny.

871
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,596
That's police brutality.

872
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,349
I'm getting a soda.
Do you guys want anything?

873
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,794
No.

874
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,676
My man doesn't shut up. Jesus Christ.

875
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,748
Alan, you okay?

876
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,636
I'm just worried.

877
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,595
What if something happened to Doug?
Something bad.

878
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,318
Come on, you can't think like that.

879
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,632
I mean, what if he's dead?

880
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,349
I can't afford to lose anybody
close to me again. It hurts too much.

881
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,952
- I was so upset when my grandpa died.
- Oh, I'm s... How'd he die?

882
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,433
- World War II.
- Died in battle?

883
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,831
No, he was skiing in Vermont.
It was just during World War II.

884
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,953
Alan...

885
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,630
...Doug is fine.
- Well, why hasn't he called?

886
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,155
I don't know,
but we're gonna figure it out.

887
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,599
I'll tell you another thing,
6-1 odds our car is beat to shit.

888
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,749
Stu, not now.

889
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,639
No, how much do you wanna bet
it's fucked beyond recognition?

890
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,679
That's enough. Alan's seriously worried,
okay? Let's not freak him out any more.

891
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,519
Sorry, Alan.

892
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,874
You know what?

893
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,589
We'll search the car for clues
and everything's gonna be okay.

894
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,111
Oh, shit. I can't watch.
Just tell me what it looks like.

895
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,269
Not looking. Not looking.

896
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,592
- Wow. All right.
- Oh, thank God.

897
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,352
You see?

898
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,752
It's gonna be all right.

899
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,389
- Anything?
- Hmm, I got a cigar.

900
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,358
Oh, I found, uh...
These are some black shoes.

901
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,431
- They women's shoes?
- I don't know.

902
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,917
- Whose are those?
- I don't know. It's a men's size 6.

903
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,548
- That's weird.
- What is this, a snakeskin?

904
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,153
Oh, come on! Ew!

905
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,880
- That's a used condom, Alan.
- Oh, God. Blech!

906
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,076
- Get it out of the car.
- Gross, it's wet.

907
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,515
- I don't want the thing.
- Hey! Come on.

908
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,673
I got jizz on me. Jesus Christ, guys!

909
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,400
- Get it out.
- Fuck!

910
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,478
Oh, my God.

911
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,589
All right, what the fuck, man?
We gotta get this shit together, guys!

912
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,633
What was that?

913
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,069
It's in the trunk.

914
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,832
- Doug's in the trunk.
- Oh, fuck! Holy shit!

915
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,831
Holy shit!

916
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,036
- Open it! Open it! Open it!
- Okay, okay, okay.

917
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,838
Okay, okay, okay.

918
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,237
Oh God!

919
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,396
Please! Please! Please stop!

920
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,309
Whoa. I'm with you, I'm with you!

921
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,313
- You gonna fuck on me?
- Nobody's gonna fuck on you!

922
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,678
We're on your side. I hate Godzilla!
I hate him too. I hate him!

923
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,673
He destroys cities! Please!

924
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,559
This isn't your fault.
I'll get you some pants.

925
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,434
What the fuck was that?

926
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,759
I have internal bleeding.
Somebody call 911.

927
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,559
That was some fucked up shit.

928
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,235
Who was that guy? He was so mean.

929
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,474
Guys, there's something
I need to tell you.

930
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,314
Last night on the roof,
before we went out...

931
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,119
...I slipped something
in our Jägermeister.

932
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,593
- What?
- I'm sorry, I fudged up, guys.

933
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,110
- You drugged us?
- No, I didn't drug you.

934
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,475
I was told it was ecstasy.

935
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,835
Well, who told you it was ecstasy?

936
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,956
The guy I bought it from
at the liquor store.

937
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,712
Why would you give us ecstasy?

938
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,236
I wanted everybody to have a good time
and I knew you guys wouldn't take it.

939
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,278
It was just one hit each.
I used to do three hits a night.

940
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,397
But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan,
it was roofies!

941
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,959
You think I knew that, Stu?

942
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,238
The guy I bought it from
seemed like a real straight shooter.

943
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,233
You mean the drug dealer at
the liquor store wasn't a good guy?

944
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,389
Let's just calm down.

945
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,793
You fucking calm down! He drugged us.
I lost a tooth. I married a whore.

946
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,748
- How dare you! She's a nice lady.
- You are such a fucking moron.

947
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,639
- Your language is offensive.
- Fuck you!

948
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,109
All right,
let's just take a deep breath, okay?

949
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,279
Seriously, this is a good thing.

950
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,194
At least it's not some stranger who
drugged us for God knows what reason.

951
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,955
Yeah, you're right, Phil,
it's totally a good thing.

952
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,350
We're so much better off now.

953
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,035
Here's something
I would like to remind you two of:

954
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,318
Our best friend Doug is probably
facedown in a ditch right now...

955
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,313
...with a meth-head butt-fucking
his corpse.

956
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,516
- That's highly unlikely.
- It's true.

957
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,229
Does not help. All right,
let's get our shit together, guys.

958
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,517
Let's go back to the hotel,
and I'm gonna make a couple calls.

959
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,591
Maybe Doug's back there.
Maybe he's asleep.

960
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,751
Come on. Let's go.

961
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,277
- Stu? Little help?
- Shut up.

962
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,753
- Ow.
- Oh, God. Oh, God, are you okay?

963
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,354
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Alan, I'm sorry.

964
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,271
Wait, guys. Guys.

965
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,237
What about the tiger?
What if he got out?

966
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,871
Oh, fuck. I keep forgetting
about the goddamn tiger.

967
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,713
How the fuck did he get in there?

968
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,072
I don't know,
because I don't remember.

969
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,071
Shh. Stu. Stu, keep it down.

970
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,516
Because one of the, uh, side effects
of, uh, roofies is memory loss.

971
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,679
You are literally too stupid to insult.

972
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,595
- Thank you.
- Hey.

973
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,996
Hey, come on.

974
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,036
Did we leave the music on?

975
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,639
Hey. Shh.

976
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,868
Don't make any sudden movements.

977
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,349
- Unh. Whoa!
- Aah!

978
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,238
- Who the hell are you?
- No, who are you?

979
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,435
Quiet, quiet.

980
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,393
Mike Tyson?

981
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,235
Shh. This is my favorite part
coming up right now.

982
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,595
Need a chorus line, guys.

983
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,228
One more time, guys.

984
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,554
Oh, Jesus!

985
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,948
Oh, fuck!

986
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,795
Why did you do that?

987
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,116
Mr. Tyson would like to know
why is his tiger in your bathroom.

988
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,510
Hold on,
that was completely unnecessary.

989
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,114
I'm a huge fan. When you knocked out
Holmes, that was...

990
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,998
Explain.

991
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,391
All right, look,
we were drugged last night.

992
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,039
We have no memory
of what happened.

993
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,189
It's true.

994
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,670
We got in all kinds of trouble last night
and now we can't find our friend.

995
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,673
If you wanna kill us,
go ahead because I don't care anymore.

996
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,751
- What are you talking about?
- I don't care.

997
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,229
Why the fuck
would you wanna steal his tiger?

998
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,312
We tend to do dumb shit
when we're fucked up.

999
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,029
- I don't believe these guys, man.
- Wait, how did you guys find us?

1000
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,829
One of you dropped your jacket.
Found it in the tigers' cage this morning.

1001
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,274
That's Doug's.

1002
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,477
Yeah, Doug.
His wallet and his room key is in there.

1003
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,359
- No, that's our missing friend.
- I don't give a fuck.

1004
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,511
- Did you guys see him?
- I was fast asleep.

1005
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,513
Because if he was up, this
wouldn't have gone down so smoothly.

1006
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,511
Maybe one of the tigers
ate his ass like Omar.

1007
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,075
Respect.

1008
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,275
Wha...? What happened to Omar?

1009
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,715
Oh, don't worry about Omar,
he's not with us no more.

1010
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,030
Okay, I know this is asking a lot...

1011
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,033
...but do you think we could
go to your house and look around...

1012
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,838
...see if there's any clues?

1013
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,039
Absolutely. How else you think
we're gonna get the tiger back anyway?

1014
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,033
- Come on, champ.
- I'm sorry?

1015
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,434
We're not gonna put it in the Bentley.
You brought it here, you bring it back.

1016
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,955
What you think, about 40 minutes?

1017
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,749
Don't make me come back for him.

1018
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,232
- That was Mike Tyson.
- Yeah, no shit that was Mike Tyson.

1019
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,038
I'm just saying, he's still got it.

1020
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,753
Alan.

1021
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,909
Bud, are you okay?

1022
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,433
- Oh, my God.
- Shit!

1023
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,794
Fuck, where'd he get him?

1024
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,949
Hey.

1025
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,519
This does not seem fair.

1026
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,438
It's Rock, Paper, Scissors.
There's nothing more fair.

1027
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,751
- Alan should do it.
- Alan took a punch from Mike Tyson.

1028
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,876
Come on. For Doug.

1029
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,157
Why are you peppering the steak?
You don't know if tigers like pepper.

1030
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,312
Tigers love pepper. They hate cinnamon.

1031
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,353
Phil, just do it. You should do it.

1032
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,671
I would, but you lost.
It wouldn't be right.

1033
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,479
Okay, I jammed five roofies in there.

1034
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,995
Just go in there and throw it in to him.

1035
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,433
Fine.

1036
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,073
Make sure he eats the whole thing.

1037
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,033
Fuck.

1038
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,918
Oh, fuck.

1039
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,318
Hey, kitty.

1040
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,674
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.
I got a little snack for you.

1041
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,479
Real important that you eat this, okay?

1042
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,350
Yeah, just have a little...

1043
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,549
Shit!

1044
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,235
What do we do now?

1045
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,672
We wait.

1046
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,157
<i>What do tigers dream of</i>

1047
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,756
<i>When they take a little tiger snooze?</i>

1048
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,992
<i>Do they dream of mauling zebras</i>

1049
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,119
<i>Or Halle Berry in her Catwoman suit?</i>

1050
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,999
<i>Don 't you worry your pretty striped head</i>

1051
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,869
<i>We're gonna get you back to Tyson</i>
<i>And your cozy tiger bed</i>

1052
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,077
<i>And then we're gonna find</i>
<i>Our best friend Doug</i>

1053
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,710
<i>And then we're gonna give him</i>
<i>A best-friend hug</i>

1054
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,393
<i>Doug</i>

1055
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,278
<i>Doug</i>

1056
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,752
<i>Doug, Dougie, Dougie, Doug, Doug</i>

1057
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,835
<i>But if he's been murdered</i>
<i>By crystal-meth tweakers</i>

1058
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,433
<i>Well, then we're shit out of luck</i>

1059
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,995
By the way, we're all gonna die.

1060
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,513
Wait.

1061
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,235
- Oh, God.
- Watch it!

1062
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,597
His nose. That's his nose.

1063
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,160
Hey, guys, when's the next
Halley's comet?

1064
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,958
- Who cares, man?
- Do you know, Stu?

1065
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,517
I don't think it's for, like,
another 60 years or something.

1066
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,513
- But it's not tonight, right?
- No, I don't think so.

1067
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,511
But you don't know for sure?

1068
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,238
No.

1069
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,868
I got this cousin who saw one.
He said it blew his mind.

1070
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,838
I wanna make sure I never, ever miss out
on a Halley's Comet.

1071
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,195
So if you guys
know if there's gonna be one...

1072
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,349
Oh, fuck!

1073
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,834
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck it!

1074
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,715
Stu! Stu, it got me! Stu!

1075
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,235
You got clawed! You're bleeding!

1076
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,192
- Oh.
- I'm panicking.

1077
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,918
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.

1078
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,516
Okay. Okay, okay. Wait, hold on.

1079
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,549
I can't do it.

1080
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,948
Get your fucking hand
back in there...

1081
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,872
...and steer the car.
- I'm too nervous.

1082
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,634
Alan. We need you, buddy.
This is your time to shine, okay?

1083
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,677
Okay, yeah. Whew.

1084
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,109
Daddy's gonna kill me.

1085
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,872
- That's it.
- That's good.

1086
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,871
Keep it straight.

1087
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,518
- You're late.
- Whatever, man.

1088
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,398
We had to push it the last mile.

1089
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,279
Come on in. Mike's got something
he wants to show you.

1090
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,232
That thing's out of control, man.
Seriously, you gotta put it down.

1091
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,278
When we got back,
we took a look at the security cameras.

1092
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,509
Great.

1093
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,990
<i>This is how you walk.</i>
<i>This is how you walk.</i>

1094
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,391
- Oh, it's Doug.
- Oh, thank God he's alive.

1095
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,552
That's our buddy.
That's who we've been missing.

1096
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,914
We're all best friends.

1097
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,594
Why don't you just pay attention?
I don't have all night.

1098
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,034
Yeah, of course. Of course.

1099
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,674
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1100
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,592
<i>Hey, guys. Check it out.</i>
<i>Watch this.</i>

1101
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,196
That's me, I'm on TV.
I've never been on TV before.

1102
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,395
<i>What are you doing, man?</i>

1103
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,710
Really? Really, Alan?

1104
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,429
<i>You got a fire hose, man?</i>

1105
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,275
Yeah, I was, uh...

1106
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,873
<i>You're gonna overflow the pool, man.</i>

1107
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,798
- Maybe... Should I wait outside?
- I think that's a good idea, Alan.

1108
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,069
Yeah.

1109
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,597
Don't touch anything out there, either.

1110
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,710
You know what? He's not our good fr...
We don't know him that well.

1111
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,439
<i>Come on. Come on, come on.</i>

1112
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,796
By the way,
where you get that cop car from?

1113
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,679
We, uh, stole it from
these dumb-ass cops.

1114
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,955
Nice.

1115
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,948
High five that one.

1116
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,838
Yeah, that's nice.

1117
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,399
You know, I just have to say...

1118
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,916
...I have never seen a more beautiful,
elegant, just regal creature.

1119
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,469
<i>Check it out. Stu. Stu.</i>
<i>Fuck this tiger.</i>

1120
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,916
- Oh, my God. That's awful.
- Oh, man.

1121
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,913
- <i>Oh, shit.</i>
- Who does shit like that, man?

1122
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,548
Someone who has a lot of issues,
obviously. I'm a sick man.

1123
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,837
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1124
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,155
That's all we got.

1125
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,792
This was hugely helpful.

1126
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,758
Really. Because now we know
that our buddy Doug...

1127
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,718
...was with us at 3:30, totally alive.

1128
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:13,188
Thanks again, champ. And, uh, again,
we are so sorry we stole your tiger.

1129
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,509
Don't worry about it, man.

1130
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,114
Like you said, we all do dumb shit
when we're fucked up.

1131
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,199
- I told you he'd get it.
- I did say that.

1132
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,269
You know, everyone says
Mike Tyson is such a badass...

1133
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,000
...but I think he's kind of a sweetheart.

1134
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,991
I think he's mean.

1135
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,357
All right. I think it's officially time
we call Tracy.

1136
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,274
Hallelujah. Finally, Phil says something
that makes sense.

1137
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,273
We don't have much of a choice.
And maybe she's heard from Doug.

1138
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,351
That's what I been saying
this whole time.

1139
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,671
We just need to be completely honest.
We need to tell her everything.

1140
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,158
We don't have to tell her everything.
We can leave out the stuff...

1141
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,436
...about me marrying a hooker.

1142
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,068
Just stay focused on Doug.

1143
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,357
- What am I gonna tell my dad?
- Alan, relax. It's just the inside.

1144
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,239
Come on. I got a guy in L.A.
who's great with interiors.

1145
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,710
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, my God.

1146
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,395
- Are you guys okay?
- What the fuck?

1147
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:36,110
I know that guy.
That's the guy from the trunk.

1148
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,393
Get out of the car. Please.

1149
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,715
W... W... Wait.
Those are the guys that shot Eddie.

1150
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,189
- Listen...
- Let's go!

1151
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,998
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

1152
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,593
- Easy, easy.
- Come on.

1153
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,273
Okay. All right.

1154
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,317
- All right, all right.
- Let's go.

1155
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,071
Hey, relax. Ow. Ow. Ow!

1156
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,196
- I have whiplash.
- Get this other fat boy.

1157
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,759
Get the fat boy.

1158
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,909
Hey, hey, hey.

1159
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,878
- All right, all right.
- Hey, take it easy, take it easy!

1160
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,638
I want my purse back, assholes.

1161
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,718
- What? Your purse?
- That's not a purse, it's a satchel.

1162
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,271
It's a purse. Okay?
And you steal from wrong guy.

1163
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,034
Wait a second, wait a second.
We stole from you?

1164
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,235
Okay, you know what?

1165
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,631
We don't remember anything
that happened last night...

1166
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,870
...so help us out a little here.

1167
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,999
Well, apparently you guys met
at a craps table late last night.

1168
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,390
You were on a heater,
and he played your hot streak.

1169
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,073
He ended up winning
just under 80 grand.

1170
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,912
No shit? Eighty grand is nice.

1171
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,115
Okay, that's good.

1172
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,397
He put the chips in his purse,
and then you guys took off with it.

1173
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,198
That doesn't sound like us.

1174
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:48,832
Mine had $80,000 inside.
And this one? Nothing.

1175
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,592
Hey, there are Skittles in there.

1176
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,070
Ow! Oh, not again.

1177
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,955
Don't let the beard fool you.
He's a child.

1178
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,997
It's funny because he's fat.

1179
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,470
Now, look, this was obviously
a very simple misunderstanding.

1180
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,313
Alan picked up the wrong purse,
it's no big deal.

1181
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:09,155
Okay, if it's, "No big deal,"
why, when I come after you guys...

1182
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,995
...he starts screaming like crazy and
throw me in trunk?

1183
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,189
What, I did that?

1184
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,952
Yeah, you said he was
your lucky charm...

1185
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,792
...and you want to take him
home with you.

1186
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,756
- Lucky charm.
- Oh, it's just funny.

1187
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,909
Fuck you.

1188
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,358
If you want to see your friend again,
you get me my 80 grand.

1189
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,919
- What?
- Our friend?

1190
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,116
- You have Doug?
- You know about our friend?

1191
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,677
- Doug!
- Doug!

1192
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,876
- Doug's in the car! Doug's in the car!
- Doug, it's okay!

1193
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,758
You chill out, goatee!

1194
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,915
- Okay, okay. All right, fine, fine.
- What do you want?

1195
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,833
Not so good now.
Quid pro quo, douche bag.

1196
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,069
What?

1197
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,834
Look, we're very sorry.
But this is an easy fix.

1198
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,991
- Alan, where's his purse?
- I don't know.

1199
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,594
- It's in the hotel room, right?
- Yeah, we can get it.

1200
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,513
We can get you the... We can even
write you a check right now.

1201
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,079
No chance. Cash only.

1202
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,674
- There's a person in there.
- Boring.

1203
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,918
Take nap. Come on.

1204
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,792
Wait. I'm sorry we're boring you!

1205
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,316
- Doug, it's okay.
- You kidnapped our friend! Kidnapper!

1206
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,469
Wait.

1207
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,358
Oh, no.
You're not going anywhere.

1208
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,273
Stop.

1209
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,512
Stop. Run me over.

1210
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,555
- Okay. Whoa. Whoa.
- Stu, Stu, Stu.

1211
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,238
Bring money to Big Rock
in Mojave Desert at dawn.

1212
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,518
- What?
- Toodle-oo, motherfucker.

1213
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:42,079
Well, at least take the bag
off his head! Fuck!

1214
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,039
Oh!

1215
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,911
Come on, get out of here.

1216
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,634
Guys, I'm telling you, I looked
for it this morning before we left.

1217
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,074
It's not anywhere.

1218
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,673
Fuck.

1219
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,198
Stu, how much you got in the bank?

1220
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,828
About 10 grand.
I was gonna use it for the wedding.

1221
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,991
You're already married,
so we're good there.

1222
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,230
Besides, enough with Melissa,
she's the worst.

1223
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,960
Yeah, Doug told me she had sex
with a pilot or something.

1224
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,749
It was a bartender on a cruise.
What is wrong with you people?

1225
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,038
- Ew. Alan, did you just eat sofa pizza?
- Yes.

1226
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,792
What are we gonna do?
We are so fucked.

1227
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,709
Hey, guys?

1228
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,836
- Did you find it?
- Nope.

1229
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,712
But check this out.

1230
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,150
Change only, 10,000.

1231
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,911
- Hey, uh, these seats taken?
- No, feel free.

1232
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,000
All right, let's play some blackjack!

1233
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,828
That's it. Shut up, bitches.

1234
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,154
Hmm.

1235
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,157
- I'll stick.
- Oh, fuck you! Fuck you!

1236
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,751
Splitting fives.

1237
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,989
- Too many.
- Yes!

1238
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,877
I don't even know you,
but I'm gonna tell you that's dumb.

1239
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,119
- Yes!
- Oh!

1240
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,477
Okay, come on.
He can't lose. He can't lose.

1241
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,716
I think the pit boss is watching him.

1242
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,994
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

1243
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,357
I'm such a klutz. I get so nervous
when I gamble. I'm so silly.

1244
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,830
- It happens.
- Whoa. Hold on a beat, okay?

1245
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,992
- Let's just take it easy. This is my wife.
- It's hurting.

1246
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,593
Make sure... Does it hurt? Does this hurt?

1247
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,034
- Oh, ow.
- You all right?

1248
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,350
- I don't know.
- I don't know either. I don't...

1249
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,794
I think you're fine. Let's go.

1250
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,554
- Really? Okay.
- Upsy-daisy, there.

1251
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,553
I'm sorry,
she's had a little too much to drink.

1252
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,712
Thanks, buddy. That's for you.

1253
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,359
And 100, 200, 300, 400.

1254
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,910
With all this, that's $82,400.

1255
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,514
Oh, goddamn it.
I don't fucking believe it.

1256
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,999
Whoo!

1257
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,310
- Alan, you're the man.
- You are too, Phil.

1258
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,040
We should come back next week,
take the whole city down.

1259
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,349
Oh, I'm free next week.

1260
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,069
Or we could just focus
on getting Doug back, right now.

1261
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,357
Uh, you know what? Next week's no
good, the Jonas Brothers are in town.

1262
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,988
But any week after that is totally fine.

1263
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,436
I think it's safe to say that our luck
has officially turned around, guys.

1264
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,398
We are back, baby.
We are fucking back.

1265
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,710
We're back. Classic.

1266
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,077
<i>We are back, we are back</i>
- That's right.

1267
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,470
<i>We are getting Doug back</i>

1268
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,677
<i>And we're the three best friends</i>
<i>That anybody could have</i>

1269
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,559
<i>We're the three best friends</i>
<i>That anyone could have</i>

1270
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,076
<i>We're the three best friends</i>
<i>That anyone can have</i>

1271
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,118
<i>And we'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever</i>
<i>Leave each other</i>

1272
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,953
<i>We're the best three friends</i>
<i>That anybody could have</i>

1273
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,839
<i>I mean, the three best friends</i>
<i>That anybody could have</i>

1274
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,992
<i>That's right, the three best friends</i>
<i>That anybody can have</i>

1275
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,276
- Now what?
- Give him the signal.

1276
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,910
- What signal?
- Flash your lights. Let him know it's on.

1277
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,878
- What's on?
- The deal.

1278
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,635
Of course it's on. We just drove 30 miles
into the desert. He knows it's on.

1279
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,836
Phil, just do something.

1280
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,228
Fine.

1281
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,952
- Oh, shit.
- See?

1282
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,031
All right, let's go.

1283
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,836
Funny fat guy fall on face.

1284
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,353
You okay?

1285
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,193
All right, we got the money.
Eighty grand, cash.

1286
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,430
Throw it over. Then I give you Doug.

1287
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,637
Um, I'm sorry.
First of all, good morning.

1288
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,438
And we didn't catch
your name last night.

1289
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,478
Mr. Chow. Leslie Chow.

1290
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,870
Mr. Chow, it is a pleasure.
My name is Stu.

1291
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,591
And we would very much appreciate
an opportunity to see Doug...

1292
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,558
...before we give you the money,
just to verify that he's okay.

1293
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,794
- lf that's cool.
- Of course, Stu. That is cool.

1294
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,356
- Oh, thank God.
- Okay.

1295
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,353
See, he fine. Now give me money...

1296
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,308
...or I shoot him,
and I shoot all you motherfuckers.

1297
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,995
And then we take it.
Your choice, bitches.

1298
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,073
- Give him the money, Stu.
- Okay.

1299
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,159
- It's all there.
- Let him go.

1300
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,275
All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

1301
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,035
Ta-da.

1302
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,316
Is this some kind of joke?
Who the hell is this?

1303
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:46,469
That is not Doug.

1304
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,473
What you talking about, Willis?
That him.

1305
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,949
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chow.
That's not our friend.

1306
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,032
- He... That's...
- The Doug we're looking for is a white.

1307
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:59,589
Ah! I told you you had the wrong guy,
little boy.

1308
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,115
Damn, Alan,
what the fuck you got me into?

1309
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,032
- You know him?
- This is the guy...

1310
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,189
...that sold me
the bad drugs.

1311
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,510
- How you doing?
- I didn't sell you no fucking bad drugs.

1312
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:12,595
- Wait. He sold you the Ruphylin?
- Ruphylin? I sold you that Ru...? Wha...?

1313
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,673
- Who gives a shit? Where is Doug?
- I am Doug.

1314
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,070
- Your name's Doug?
- Yes, I'm Doug.

1315
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,834
His name's Doug too.
Ha. Classic mix-up.

1316
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,115
Come on.

1317
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,748
Hey, Chow.
You gave us the wrong Doug.

1318
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,319
Not my problem.

1319
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,995
No, fuck that shit. Now, you give us our
80 grand back and take him with you!

1320
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:35,631
- No. Come on. I'll be your Doug.
- Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, I take him back.

1321
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,598
Right after you suck on
these little Chinese nuts.

1322
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,872
- Ah. That's nasty.
- Mmm. How that sound?

1323
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,519
Unh, pshh.

1324
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,514
- So long, gay boys.
- Wait a second.

1325
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,352
He's a nasty little motherfucker.

1326
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,589
Did you ever get any ecstasy?

1327
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,751
No, I ain't got no fucking ecstasy.

1328
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,992
- Goddamn it!
- Gosh darn it!

1329
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,152
- Shit!
- Shoot!

1330
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,350
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.

1331
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,990
<i>Phil, where the hell are you guys?</i>
<i>I'm freaking out.</i>

1332
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,798
Yeah, listen.

1333
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,633
We fucked up.

1334
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,950
Thanks for the lift back to town.

1335
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,232
- I got a question for you.
- What's up?

1336
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,152
How did you wind up in Chow's car?

1337
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,110
That crazy asshole
kidnapped me yesterday.

1338
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,396
Okay, but why? I mean, why you?

1339
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,916
He thought I was with you guys because
we were hanging over at the Bellagio.

1340
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,718
- What?
- We were at the Bellagio?

1341
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,757
We were shooting craps.
You don't remember?

1342
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,150
No. No, we don't remember.

1343
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:47,189
Because some dick drug dealer sold him
Ruphylin and told him it was ecstasy.

1344
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,512
Ruphylin. There you go with that word.
Ruphylin. What the hell is a Ruphylin?

1345
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:55,753
Wow, you are
the world's shittiest drug dealer.

1346
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:01,153
Ruphylin, for your information, is the
date rape drug. You sold Alan roofies.

1347
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,710
Oh, shit. I must have mixed up the bags.
My fault, Alan.

1348
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,792
Damn, Marshall gonna be
pissed off at me on that one.

1349
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,192
- Whatever.
- It's funny, because just the other day...

1350
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,432
...me and my boy, we was wondering
why they even call them roofies.

1351
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,478
- You know what I'm talking about?
- No. Don't know.

1352
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,995
Why not floories, right?
Because when you take them...

1353
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,197
...you're more likely
to end up on the floor than the roof.

1354
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,671
What about groundies?
That's a good new name for them.

1355
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,239
Or, how about rapies?

1356
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,195
- Wait, what did you just say?
- Rapies.

1357
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,510
Not you. Doug,
what did you say before?

1358
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,908
I said groundies.

1359
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,069
No, before that.

1360
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:41,473
You said, "You're more likely to wind up
on the floor than..."

1361
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,279
- Phil.
- Listen, Trace, I'm really sorry. l...

1362
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,193
- <i>Phil? Hello?</i>
- Tracy, it's Stu.

1363
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,476
Stu. Talk to me. What's going on?

1364
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,517
Uh, nothing. Don't listen to Phil.

1365
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,990
He's completely out of his mind.
He's probably still drunk from last night.

1366
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,149
Where's Doug?

1367
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,471
<i>He is paying the bill.</i>
<i>We just had a delicious brunch.</i>

1368
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,949
We're in a hurry to get back,
so we gotta get going.

1369
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,190
- Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye.
- Stu.

1370
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,430
Stu. Fuck.

1371
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:12,115
- What the fuck, man?
- I know where Doug is.

1372
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,198
I don't know, man. It just hit me.

1373
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,158
You remember when we saw
Doug's mattress impaled on that statue?

1374
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,550
- Yeah, we threw it out the window.
- No, impossible.

1375
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,597
You can't open windows
in Vegas hotels.

1376
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,113
Well, then how did it get...?

1377
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,396
- Oh, my God!
- Ha, ha, ha.

1378
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,472
- Whoa, wait. What's going on?
- Doug was trying to signal someone.

1379
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,039
- Holy shit.
- Yes.

1380
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,953
- Wait. How did you figure that out?
- Doug made me realize it.

1381
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,917
- Doug?
- Uh, not our Doug. Black Doug.

1382
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,117
- Hey, hey, easy with that shit. Come on.
- Sorry.

1383
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,032
Can someone tell me
where white Doug is?

1384
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,713
- He's on the roof, Alan.
- Yes.

1385
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,952
He's on the roof. We must have
taken him up there as a prank...

1386
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,918
...so he'd wake up on the roof.
- Like that time in summer camp.

1387
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,116
We moved his sleeping bag
out in the jetty at the lake?

1388
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,952
Ha, ha, ha. Which was hilarious.

1389
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,078
It's not so funny now, though,
because we forgot where we put him.

1390
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,992
You guys are retarded, you know that?

1391
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:07,392
- Holy shit. You think he's still up there?
- There's only one way to find out.

1392
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,074
Doug!

1393
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,992
Doug!

1394
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,196
- Doug!
- Doug, you up here, buddy?

1395
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,156
Where you at, Doug?

1396
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,318
Doug!

1397
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,869
Hey, guys!

1398
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,313
He's over here!

1399
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,350
- Hey, I found him! He's over here!
- Oh, shit.

1400
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,988
He's okay.

1401
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,072
You're okay. Ha, ha, ha!

1402
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,118
Oh, God. We gotta go, buddy. Come on.

1403
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,158
Oh, we have been looking everywhere
for you.

1404
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,278
- He's alive.
- What the fuck is going on?

1405
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,352
We can explain everything,
but right now we gotta go.

1406
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,399
- Hey, bud. You okay?
- No. Not okay.

1407
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,199
You look good, you got some color.
I'm jealous.

1408
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,715
- I'm getting married today.
- Yes, you are.

1409
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,314
That's why you need to focus
and do everything we say.

1410
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,677
Because, frankly, you're wasting
a little bit of time right now.

1411
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,068
You fucking asshole!

1412
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,838
Oh, my skin burns. My skin burns.

1413
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,638
Oh, ow! God.

1414
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,917
- It's okay. It's not your fault, Doug.
- Don't touch me. Shut up.

1415
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,433
All of you, shut up.

1416
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,839
Just get me home.

1417
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,069
Mm-hm.

1418
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,958
Just get me home.

1419
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,910
What about the one after that?

1420
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,078
You cannot be serious.

1421
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,239
Oh, goddamn it.

1422
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,118
- What?
- Every flight to L.A. is booked.

1423
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,599
- What about Burbank?
- Sold out.

1424
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,036
Oh, fuck! We can't drive there, the
wedding starts in three and a half hours.

1425
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,316
- Alan, where's the car?
- It's on its way.

1426
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,754
You know what?

1427
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:52,071
We can drive there.
We can make it. Okay?

1428
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,675
Hi.

1429
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,275
- Just give me one second.
- We will leave without you.

1430
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,756
- Is he missing a tooth?
- Yeah.

1431
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,551
- Hey.
- Hey.

1432
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,359
Hey, thanks for helping out last night.
That was so awesome.

1433
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,033
Sure.

1434
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,195
Listen, Jade, l...

1435
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,079
Look, you don't have to say it.
I totally understand.

1436
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,232
- This whole thing was stupid.
- Huh.

1437
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,078
It was stupid, wasn't it?

1438
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,751
- This is yours.
- Oh, thank you.

1439
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:37,714
I can't believe I gave my grandmother's
Holocaust ring to someone I just met.

1440
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,440
- What was I thinking?
- You were really fucked up.

1441
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,238
Clearly.

1442
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,760
- You did pull out your own tooth.
- l...?

1443
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,475
I pulled out my tooth?

1444
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,950
Why did I pull out my own tooth?

1445
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,475
Alan bet you that you weren't
a good enough dentist...

1446
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,993
...to pull out your own tooth.

1447
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,638
Okay. Heh.

1448
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,037
- Of course he did.
- You won.

1449
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,476
Yeah. Clearly. Yeah.

1450
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,471
That's victory, right there.

1451
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,278
It needs to go down.

1452
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,112
- It's good. Get in.
- No. Safety first.

1453
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,636
- Alan, it's fine. It's down.
- No, I gotta get it down first.

1454
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,759
- Jesus Christ. Look out.
- Don't mess the car up.

1455
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,751
You're gonna mess the car up.

1456
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:24,356
- Hey, what are you doing next weekend?
- I don't know. Working. Why?

1457
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,432
I was thinking maybe I'd come back
and take you out to dinner.

1458
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,034
Really? Like a date?

1459
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:34,751
Yeah. Like a date.
Only, one that hopefully I'll remember.

1460
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,912
Sounds good.

1461
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,993
- Stu. Come on.
- Stu. Come on.

1462
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,229
I gotta go. Okay. Bye.

1463
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,751
- Bye.
- Bye.

1464
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,518
All right, here we go.

1465
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,798
- All right, let's go.
- Yeah.

1466
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:00,949
Careful.

1467
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,920
At least the trip
wasn't a total disaster.

1468
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,117
- What makes you say that?
- When I woke up on the roof...

1469
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,989
...I happened to find $80,000
worth of Bellagio chips in my pocket.

1470
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,832
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1471
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,636
Looks like we're going home
with some money, boys.

1472
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,152
Here he comes. That's him.

1473
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,113
- Hey, Neeco!
- Hey. What's up, Alan?

1474
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,872
Whoo!

1475
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,872
- Whoa, look out.
- Oh, shit.

1476
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,951
Whoa! Whoa!

1477
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,428
- Thanks, Neeco.
- You got it, man.

1478
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,953
- Page me!
- Adiós.

1479
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,476
- Who the hell was that guy?
- That's my buddy.

1480
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:50,796
Hey. Sorry, MapQuest took us
on a really crazy route.

1481
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,032
- How's my hair?
- It looks good.

1482
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,193
- Is it cool like Phil's?
- It's classic Phil.

1483
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,596
She looks beautiful, man.

1484
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:31,909
Sorry I'm late.

1485
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:34,879
Vegas.

1486
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,194
Where were you?
And why are you so red?

1487
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:47,349
Honey, it's a long story.

1488
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:50,117
We are gathered here today...

1489
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,716
...because of the strength of love
and of promises kept.

1490
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,952
All I know is I am so sorry.

1491
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,555
And I promise
for as long as we're married...

1492
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:03,838
...to never, ever put you
through anything like this again.

1493
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,717
Can you forgive me?

1494
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,591
- Daddy.
- Hey, my man.

1495
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,035
Excuse me, but I'm expecting
my husband any minute.

1496
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,997
Oh, that's very funny. Come here.

1497
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,355
How was your soccer game?

1498
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:19,599
- Stu? You avoiding me?
- Hey. Melissa.

1499
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,354
Oh, my God.
What happened to your tooth?

1500
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:26,516
Have you met Alan? Tracy's brother.
Brother of the...

1501
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,193
Okay. Ow.

1502
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:31,158
That is disgusting.
Why haven't you returned my calls?

1503
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:33,551
Well, there was a snafu
when we stopped...

1504
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,517
I called that bed and breakfast in Napa.

1505
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,717
They said they had no record
of you even checking in.

1506
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,038
That's because we didn't go to Napa.

1507
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:45,034
- Stu. What the fuck is going on?
- We went to Las Vegas.

1508
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:48,192
Oh, really? Las Vegas?
Why would you go to Las Vegas?

1509
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,794
My friend was getting married.
That's what guys do.

1510
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,632
- Okay, that's not what you do.
- Really?

1511
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,078
Well, then why did I do it, huh?
Because I did it. Riddle me that.

1512
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,673
Why'd I do it?

1513
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,956
All you want me to do
is what you want me to do.

1514
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,917
I'm sick of doing what you want.

1515
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,470
In a healthy relationship, a guy should
be able to do what he wants.

1516
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,552
- That is not how this works!
- Oh, good.

1517
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:12,598
Because whatever this is
ain't working for me!

1518
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,749
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1519
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,989
Since when?

1520
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:19,517
Since you fucked that waiter
on your cruise last June. Boom!

1521
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,869
- You told me it was a bartender.
- Oh, you're right. I stand corrected.

1522
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,077
It was a bartender.
You fucked a bartender.

1523
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,593
You're an idiot.

1524
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:31,749
You're... You...

1525
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,153
You're such a bad person.

1526
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,231
Like, all the way through to your core.

1527
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,233
Alan, shall we dance?

1528
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,309
Let's do this.

1529
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:55,320
- It was a real pleasure meeting you.
- Fuck off.

1530
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,912
- I'm getting my bartender's license.
- Suck my dick.

1531
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,959
No, thank you.

1532
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,036
You guys are awesome.

1533
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,668
Dougie...

1534
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,229
...I gotta tell you, man,
this was a gorgeous wedding.

1535
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,198
- I give it six months.
- You're a dick.

1536
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:29,352
I don't know what to say.
Thanks for the bachelor party, I guess?

1537
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:34,278
Yeah. I just wish
we could actually remember some of it.

1538
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:37,671
- Hey, guys? Look what I found.
- Whoa, that's my camera.

1539
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,798
- It was in the back seat of the car.
- Oh, Go... Are there photos on it?

1540
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,235
Yeah. Some of it's even worse
than we thought.

1541
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,356
- No fucking way. Give me that.
- Wa... Wa... Wait.

1542
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,909
Wait, wait, wait.

1543
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,549
We look at these
pictures together, okay?

1544
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,631
One time.

1545
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:59,073
- And then we delete the evidence.
- I say we delete it right now.

1546
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:02,710
Are you nuts? I wanna find out
how I wound up in the hospital.

1547
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,759
- Yeah, it's in there.
- Guys, one time.

1548
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:07,909
- Deal?
- Deal.

1549
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,672
- Deal.
- Okay.

1550
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,439
Oh, dear Lord!

1551
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,271
<i>That's classic!</i>
