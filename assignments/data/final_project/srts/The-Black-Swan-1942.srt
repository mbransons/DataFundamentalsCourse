1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,304
<i>12:00!</i>

3
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:09,174
<i>12:00 and all is well!</i>

4
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:11,507
The night is fair!

5
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:13,673
The wind is down!

6
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:19,346
And the commander's daughter has
recovered from the sickness!

7
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:21,354
12:00!

8
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:26,027
12:00.

9
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:31,099
And the people of Guadela are
grateful for a night of peace!

10
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,963
God be thanked in his heaven.

11
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:37,539
That midnight strikes
and all is well!

12
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,370
12:00!

13
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:46,575
12:00 and all is well!

14
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,346
12:00!

15
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,168
A poor haul, but an easy one.

16
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:18,468
We'll do ourselves better
in Maracaibo.

17
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:25,172
What are you moping about?

18
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:27,249
Here. Drink this.

19
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,411
No?

20
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:44,392
It was an easy scuffle, Jamie-Boy.

21
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:47,663
Aye, it was.

22
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:50,331
Hey, what are you rubbing
your nose for?

23
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:52,941
- I'm thinking on something.
- Out with it!

24
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,505
They're hanging Captain
Morgan this week...

25
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,511
hanging him on the docks in London.

26
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:02,106
- That's what I'm thinking on.
- Anybody lets himself get...

27
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,276
caught and hung is nobody
to drink to.

28
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,945
To Captain Morgan, I say!

29
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:09,483
Hanging or walking, he's a better
man than the pack of us.

30
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,103
Give me that comb.

31
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,406
Let go of that, you! Blast it!

32
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:12,611
I must drink to this occasion,
Captain Waring.

33
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:16,657
We are not often honored by such
a distinguished visitor.

34
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:21,327
What a magnificent record.

35
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,329
Second in command to Henry Morgan...

36
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,801
in the raid on Panama...

37
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,067
the sack of Maracaibo,
Portobelo, Trujillo!

38
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,004
Quite a busy little cutthroat
we have here.

39
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,170
But there is no mention of you
at the attack on Granada.

40
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,544
I was there... killing Spaniards.

41
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:46,212
The English dog still barks! Is your
memory improving?

42
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,659
Have you remembered where...

43
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,594
- Captain Morgan is?
- Perfectly.

44
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,093
- Where is he?
- In England.

45
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,095
You lie.

46
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:58,032
I grant you England is where
he should be...

47
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:03,267
hanging from a gibbet with the
rest of you scum of the sea!

48
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,239
But I have word from our
ambassador...

49
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,434
that he escaped.

50
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,443
Your news delights me, Don Miguel.

51
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,947
Oh. And perhaps this will
delight you too.

52
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,176
A quarter of a turn!

53
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:21,553
Where were you planning
to meet Morgan?

54
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,624
On the far side of the moon.

55
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,156
Where is his ship?

56
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:31,391
Hull down and sailing through
your whiskers, Don Miguel.

57
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,230
A full turn!

58
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,636
Speak, you devil spawn,
before I quarter you!

59
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:47,310
- What is that?
- The devil looking after his own.

60
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,654
Easy, my brave bag of wind!

61
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:00,796
Tommy Blue! Welcome to Corrientes!

62
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,658
Be with you in a minute,
Captain Jamie.

63
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:07,628
Hand over that sticker while I'm...

64
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:09,637
in this loving mood. March!

65
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:11,763
Ho-ho! You're outnumbered.
Me and Jamie...

66
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,775
could outnumber your whole empire!

67
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,470
Take those stickers away before
they hurt themselves!

68
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:23,577
Came into the harbor to get
a barrel of water...

69
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,519
and says to a fellow, says I...

70
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:27,555
"How's me old friend Don Miguel?"

71
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,521
"Well," says he, "the noble Spaniard
is entertaining people."

72
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,527
"Who?" says I."Well,
among his guests,"

73
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,530
says he, "is Jamie Waring."

74
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,463
"Well," says I, "that's a party
I've got to attend."

75
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,161
- So up we came.
- Ah. I'll thank you later.

76
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,397
But tell me, Tommy, who's with you?

77
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,531
- How many ships have you got?
- Oh, two pretties, Jamie.

78
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:49,476
The second one's tacking in, but let
me tell you the good news first!

79
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:51,508
Never mind the news. Get me
that bottle of wine.

80
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:54,343
- Huh? Oh.
- Quick.

81
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:12,000
There's nothing like a stretch
on the rack to raise a thirst.

82
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,603
Would you want to be laying
down a minute, Jamie?

83
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,038
No.

84
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:43,995
Keep a clear head, Tommy.
We've got work to do...

85
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,101
Nice, pleasant work.

86
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,795
I'm a better man drunk than
sober for any kind of work!

87
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,338
You were admiring my bark,
Don Miguel.

88
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:54,500
- We'll see how you like my bite.
- But I'm unarmed.

89
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,844
It's lucky you are. If you had
a sword in your hand...

90
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,206
you'd be dead by now and
stiffer than the devil's tail.

91
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,408
Give me a hand! Put him on the rack!

92
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,349
- Here.
- Move! Get a move on!

93
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,581
Go on!

94
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:11,193
Have mercy, senor! What are
you going to do now?

95
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,851
I'm eager to return your
hospitality, Don Miguel.

96
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,225
- On the rack!
- Oh, no, no. Please, no.

97
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:25,569
You'll hang for this! You'll hang
for this, all of you.

98
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,073
Your English governor...

99
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,701
In the name of God, let me go!
Let me go!

100
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:34,543
- Lord Denby! Lord Denby!
- A musical fellow, ain't he?

101
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:38,085
Your bark, Don Miguel, is a
little louder than mine.

102
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,085
Turn the wheel, my lads.

103
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,623
What say the poets? "One good
turn deserves another."

104
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,354
Stop that, you bloody thieves!

105
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,499
Unchain this man! I command you
in the name of King Charles.

106
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,930
And who may you be, you
bellowing rabbit?

107
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,903
I'm Lord Denby, governor of Jamaica.
Oh, Lord Denby.

108
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,405
You're the gentleman who brought
Captain Morgan to trial.

109
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,340
I'm delighted to meet you.

110
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:04,674
And I'll see you hanging on Wapping
Executional Dock beside him.

111
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:07,840
- I'm laughing me sides out!
- March out, you renegade louts!

112
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:10,076
Renegade! You yellow turncoat!

113
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:12,499
Befriending the Spanish and hanging
your own countrymen!

114
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,389
Lay down your arms!
England and Spain...

115
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,221
are at peace. A treaty
has been signed.

116
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,520
Where was it signed, Lord Denby,
on that rack?

117
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:20,559
Men, here's a rope-maker
for your necks...

118
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,561
the little English hangman
from Jamaica.

119
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,723
Up the rope he goes!
Up he goes.

120
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,801
Oh, I'm glad to see Jamie is here.

121
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,302
- Give me a rope, somebody!
- No, no, Tommy.

122
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,406
- No rope for him.
- Oh, let me hang him, Jamie.

123
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,804
No. The rope's for gentlemen
with brave hearts.

124
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,911
The vault's the place for
this English traitor.

125
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:37,945
Lock him away with all his
Spanish friends.

126
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:39,002
You'll hang, all of you!

127
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,013
March him off! Chain him
to the wall!

128
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,015
Let him rot in the Spanish damp.

129
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:46,212
You sea rats! I command you
in His Majesty's name!

130
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:49,347
Your commanding days
are over, my lord.

131
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,056
I'm laughing me sides out!

132
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:59,395
Put away that bottle, Tommy.
There's treasure to load.

133
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:01,730
This is a ripe and juicy castle.

134
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,002
Here, you guzzler! Take this!

135
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,543
Make yourself a pretty
pair of drawers!

136
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:12,841
Two ships, you said, huh? We can
load 'em both from this castle...

137
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,847
and sail for Maracaibo!

138
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,420
Gut the whole Spanish Main strip it
and leave it like a...

139
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,354
horse's skull on the desert.

140
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,555
Look at him.

141
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:21,420
Look at him.

142
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,391
He's fainted.

143
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,792
Or is he just bored with
our presence?

144
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,563
- Close your eyes, Don Miguel.
- Father!

145
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,725
- The devil's asking for you.
- Father?

146
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:36,167
Where's my father?

147
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:38,967
The captain's share, gentlemen.
I bespeak it.

148
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,099
Where is he?

149
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,740
Stay away or I'll shoot! I'm
Lord Denby's daughter.

150
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:50,944
Ohhh. This is a windfall.
Lady Margaret, eh?

151
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:54,514
- Who are you?
- A sea rat...

152
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,557
a bit of ocean scum doing
His Majesty's dirty work...

153
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,821
killing the Spaniards to
make room for...

154
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:02,830
fat Englishmen and their
nasty daughters.

155
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,455
Waring is my name, but those who...

156
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,467
love me call me Jamie-Boy.

157
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:09,264
I'm not afraid of you
gallows dancers.

158
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,965
"Gallows dancers"? A pretty
phrase, milady.

159
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:14,405
Yes. I've seen your kind
dancing in the wind...

160
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,841
with their necks stretched like
a lot of geese flying.

161
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:18,844
And I'll see you that way too!

162
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,915
Where's my father? Tell me
or I'll shoot.

163
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,347
Your father is ornamenting
a dungeon wall, milady.

164
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,855
But you'll forget about him
as soon as you learn to...

165
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:28,846
call me Jamie-Boy.

166
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,789
Let go of me, you brute!

167
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:42,862
I always sample a bottle of
wine before I buy it.

168
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:46,202
Let's have a sip, see if you're
worth taking along.

169
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,085
Oh! You wench! Bite me, will you?

170
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,566
Strike me blind! It's a ghost.

171
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:20,903
- Hello, Jamie-Boy.
- Captain Morgan!

172
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:23,477
Don't stand there gaping like
a halibut on a pier.

173
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:27,611
Henry! What in the name of thunder?

174
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,615
- So you weren't hanged!
- Not successfully.

175
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,014
You escaped!

176
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:33,020
No. A king's pardon and more.

177
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:34,995
I'm swooning like a bride.
I was telling you,

178
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:36,858
Jamie, I had news for you.

179
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:39,392
Aye, a packet of news it is, me boy.

180
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:42,408
Now put your shirt on. You look much
too naked for a decent Englishman.

181
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,495
And now find me my great admirer...

182
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,999
the so-called governor of Jamaica.

183
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,496
And if this sad little wench be
his daughter, fetch her...

184
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:50,297
some smelling salts.

185
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:52,340
And you, Tom Blue, tell all
me old captains...

186
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,194
to meet me tonight at
the Porker's Sterne.

187
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:54,355
Aye.

188
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:56,810
- But I...
- Jamie-Boy, I got a lot to tell you.

189
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:03,279
Silence!

190
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,284
Now listen to me.

191
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,381
If there's anybody wants
to tell me different...

192
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:09,618
let him stand up and get
his head broke in.

193
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:13,284
I say Captain Morgan's a king's spy.

194
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:15,430
He bought his life by
offering to put all...

195
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,431
his old cronies on the end of a rope.

196
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,296
I say Morgan's a yellow dog!

197
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,716
Now, wait there, Captain Leech.
We ought to hear what...

198
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:23,517
Morgan's got to say.

199
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:25,897
Are you calling me a liar?

200
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,909
No, but I'm saying we oughta
hear Morgan out.

201
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:30,170
And nobody's calling me a liar.

202
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:39,177
Now, then, anybody else want
their head broke in?

203
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:43,849
I say Captain Morgan's a two-faced
cur with the king's brand on him.

204
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,960
And I say Captain Leech is
a gibbering ape...

205
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,962
fit only for the company of baboons.

206
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:53,363
Ah, gentlemen, Captain Leech
is in a temper.

207
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:56,960
Aha! Morgan's fetch-and-carry.

208
00:15:57,106 --> 00:16:00,132
Don't cross with him, Jamie. You're
too drunk to do yourself justice.

209
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:02,595
- A little room, please.
- I always wanted to cut that...

210
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,812
oily tongue out of you.

211
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,301
Leech! Jamie! Stop it!

212
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:30,837
Stop it, you lubbers! Stop or
I'll blast the both of you!

213
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,339
I told you he was coming!

214
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:35,340
Sit down, you two.

215
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:38,241
Over there, Captain Leech.

216
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:44,619
Your seat, Captain Waring.

217
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,153
Ale for all hands, Barney...

218
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:49,154
and keep it pouring till
we're all drowned.

219
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:54,193
Gentlemen, I am delighted to see
you all still alive and kicking.

220
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,490
You were all my captains once...

221
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:59,352
and I have called you together to
know if you will still follow me.

222
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:03,868
Where to? The gallows at
100 guineas a head?

223
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:05,439
Your head, Captain Leech...

224
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:08,771
were it filled with gold instead
of slops, wouldn't fetch that.

225
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,937
Gentlemen...

226
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,961
I have come from England
with an offer from...

227
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:15,645
His Majesty King Charles.

228
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,309
A king's pardon and a hundred
acres of land...

229
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,388
to each of you who will
settle down ashore...

230
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:22,786
or take your ships into
peaceful trade.

231
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,958
Oh, they'll clap us in jail
the minute we dump...

232
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,492
our cannon.

233
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:26,923
It's a trick.

234
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,155
And who's going to give us
the hundred acres of land?

235
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:31,692
- The new governor of Jamaica.
- The new governor?

236
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,701
- And who is the new governor?
- Henry Morgan...

237
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:36,702
Sir Henry Morgan...

238
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,367
knighted by His Majesty and assigned
the island of Jamaica for his ruling.

239
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,377
I said it before and I say it again.

240
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:48,276
A king's spy.

241
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:52,478
No, Captain Leech. A king's right
arm in the Caribbean...

242
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,816
and a strong one.

243
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,459
Gentlemen, England has signed
a peace with Spain...

244
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,257
The long fight is over.

245
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,420
It's a trick.

246
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,598
Spain wants a breathing spell
from our attacks...

247
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,400
so she can strengthen
her forces here.

248
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:08,400
- Quiet, Jamie.
- It's a scurvy trick, I say!

249
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:10,004
Sit down!

250
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:12,459
They'll bring over armies and
ships to murder us if we...

251
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,100
give them peace.

252
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,475
- Aye, they will.
- Quiet, you bubbleheads!

253
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:18,808
The privateers are done for.
They're in the past.

254
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:21,416
They must give way now to progress
and the making of...

255
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,316
law-abiding colonies.

256
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:26,979
England wants peace and
time to build her empire.

257
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:29,090
Will you join me for that,
Brother Leech?

258
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:32,022
I sailed the Main with you, Morgan...

259
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:34,081
and if you're crawling under
the king's flag...

260
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:36,028
I'll keep sailing it without you!

261
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:39,692
- Who's coming along to Maracaibo?
- There's a lot of gold in Maracaibo.

262
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:43,362
As governor of Jamaica, I make
my first pronouncement.

263
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:48,306
I'll run every pirate and privateer
into the bottom of the Caribbean.

264
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:50,638
I give those of you who
don't join me...

265
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,942
a month to clear out of
English waters.

266
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,642
My ship, the Black Swan,
don't drop...

267
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,652
her sails for any king's spy.

268
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,914
That's my answer to you,
Captain Morgan.

269
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,649
And if any of you yellow-livers
get the blood...

270
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,659
back in you, I'll lead you
against Maracaibo!

271
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,693
Who's coming with me?

272
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,697
- I, sir!
- And I, sir!

273
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,460
Jamie Waring. Come on, Jamie-Boy.

274
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:15,331
He's got the king, but we've got
the wind on our side.

275
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,335
And a captain's share of Maracaibo.

276
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:21,806
Get down, you drunken fool. You're
my second in command.

277
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:24,310
Hey, Barney. More ale for
Captain Waring.

278
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:27,472
- Aye, sir.
- Gentlemen, to Captain Waring...

279
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:29,641
my loyal right hand at
Government House.

280
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:33,983
Come on, Jamie. You were never meant
to suck your thumb in a king's collar.

281
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:36,818
- We'll get you a new ship.
- To Jamie Waring!

282
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,552
May his neck never grow longer!

283
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,705
The occasion seems a little lacking
in enthusiasm, Henry.

284
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:03,044
I imagined we'd meet with
some slight disapproval.

285
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:05,551
At least we don't have to
shoot our way in.

286
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:16,395
Whom do you wish to see?

287
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:18,499
We are waiting upon Lord Denby.

288
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,966
His lordship is busy, sir.

289
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:23,094
He'll be busier in a few minutes.

290
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:26,071
Mr. Ingram, these gentlemen are
waiting upon his lordship.

291
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,608
- Gentlemen?
- I am Sir Henry Morgan.

292
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:31,110
From the looks of you, it
could be nothing else.

293
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:33,737
Your Excellency, there are
some gentlemen here...

294
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,782
with muddy boots.

295
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,782
I have removed all my effects.

296
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:39,444
The premises are at your disposal
for looting or burning.

297
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,613
I can appreciate your
discomfort, milord.

298
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,587
It's not pleasant having
a man you tried...

299
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,593
to hang return as your superior.

300
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:48,025
But for the sake of the empire
we both serve...

301
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:51,760
I am willing to forget your
distaste of me.

302
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,427
The ceremony making you official
governor will take place tomorrow.

303
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,437
I shall perform all duties required...

304
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,372
of me as an officer of the Crown.

305
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,704
But my personal life is my own, sir.

306
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,244
It does not include associating
with blackguards.

307
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,852
Well, Sir Henry, do we run him
through hang him...

308
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:14,889
from the yardarm...

309
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,184
or start dancing the minuet?

310
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,795
Being governor is going to
require some restraint.

311
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,258
There's always Maracaibo.

312
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,440
Get to your quarters, you
blockheads! Both of you!

313
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,569
- What quarters, sir?
- How do I know? Find them!

314
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,663
Take any rooms you want.

315
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:45,413
- No, you don't! That's mine!
- I saw it first!

316
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,387
Oh, no, sir! No, sir!

317
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,718
Don't kill me! Don't kill me.
Is going. Is going.

318
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,383
- Pick that up.
- Yes, massa. Yes, sir.

319
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,860
- Pick it up!
- Yes, sir. Oh, you...

320
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:58,592
You is one of them pirates, is you?
Or... Or ain't you?

321
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,614
- What do I look like?
- Yes. I mean, no, sir.

322
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:03,163
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, nothing, sir. Just going...

323
00:22:03,164 --> 00:22:04,038
going fast.

324
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:06,037
- Stealing, eh?
- Oh, no, sir.

325
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:08,734
I was just looking for a locket that
belonged to Miss Margaret.

326
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:11,710
- But it ain't here, sir. It ain't here.
- This is Lady Margaret's room?

327
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:12,506
Yes, sir.

328
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,515
How's her bed? Soft enough for me?

329
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:16,583
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

330
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:01,753
"And 10th, we do hereby give and
grant unto Sir Henry Morgan...

331
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,693

361
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:33,720
Whew. That was the longest, dullest
ceremony I ever heard.

362
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,720
I don't blame you for walking out.

363
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,928
You can lower your pistols,
Lady Margaret.

364
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,862
Unfortunately, I have no pistols.

365
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:49,493
Your eyes I've looked into pistol
barrels that are kinder.

366
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:55,039
- Get out of my way.
- Please, do me a favor and...

367
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,044
don't make me angry.

368
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,148
I'm trying my hardest to behave
like a gentleman.

369
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:03,308
- A gentleman?
- Well, perhaps not entirely.

370
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:06,284
I only meant that my new character
keeps me from seizing women...

371
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,981
and hugging and squeezing
them into submission.

372
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:13,359
Instead, I... I woo them
with politeness...

373
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,360
and with gifts.

374
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,226
Here.

375
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,932
Where did you get this?

376
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:23,037
I found it in your bed.

377
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:25,366
- You have my room?
- Yes.

378
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:28,669
And you haunt it sweetly each night.

379
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,869
Not an evening passes
but I find some...

380
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,880
new and fascinating souvenir of you...

381
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:36,245
a stocking, a garter, a bit of lace.

382
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:45,993
In Tortuga, when a woman
slaps a man's face...

383
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,356
it means she wants him to grab her...

384
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:50,896
overpower her and smother
her with kisses.

385
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:56,431
I understand in Jamaica a gentleman
must refuse such overtures.

386
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:58,539
- Out of my way.
- You're much too angry for...

387
00:25:58,607 --> 00:25:59,539
public appearance.

388
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:02,802
Give me your arm. A turn around
the garden will cool you off.

389
00:26:02,944 --> 00:26:05,936
I promise not to kiss you unless
you ask for it like a lady.

390
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:08,208
Roger. Roger.

391
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,812
Oh. The idiot whose face I took
the liberty of removing...

392
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:13,553
from your locket.

393
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:15,568
Darling, I've been hunting
everywhere for you.

394
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:17,257
Take me home, please.

395
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,916
- Has this fellow been insulting you?
- Yes.

396
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:22,120
Oh, the hero to the rescue.

397
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:24,492
It's time one of you lackeys
was taught a lesson.

398
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:28,160
No, I'm under oath as a gentleman
not to kill any tame rabbits.

399
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:30,794
- I'll have you for that.
- Leave the coward alone, Roger.

400
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:32,770
No, I'm going to make
an example of him.

401
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,775
I'll run him through as
a common thief.

402
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:40,047
Oath or no oath, you'll
have to learn...

403
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:42,049
not to offend your betters, Ingram.

404
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:45,691
Now, tell me, what the devil
do you see in this weasel?

405
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:47,652
Oh, darling are you hurt?

406
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,654
I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

407
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:52,184
If you're in love with him, you're
too big a fool for a...

408
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:52,758
man like me.

409
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:54,918
You black-hearted bully.

410
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:58,031
What do you know about men or
women or anything human?

411
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,135
All you can do is shoot and kill
and prey on women...

412
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:04,500
with your beastly senses slobbering
at the sight of anything fine.

413
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,233
I repeat, my lass, you'll
have to choose...

414
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,244
between us and very soon too.

415
00:27:56,891 --> 00:27:59,519
There you are, my beauty.

416
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:01,958
Seeing is believing.

417
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,792
Made for a queen, it was.

418
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,457
And easy to accommodate five...

419
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,297
if you'll sleep them crosswise.

420
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,905
Come on. Get that albatross
out of here.

421
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,634
Now, hold your fire, Jamie-Boy.

422
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,903
I promised her she could
spend the night...

423
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:18,910
in the governor's daughter's bed.

424
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,981
Get back to your trough, both of you.

425
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,643
I never thought I'd live to see
Jamie Waring play the snob.

426
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,651
- Get out.
- Why, Jamie...

427
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,653
It's a heart of stone you got!

428
00:28:28,823 --> 00:28:30,688
<i>Jamie, open the door!</i>

429
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,690
<i>She's crying her head off.</i>

430
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:36,820
<i>Jamie, she's crying like a baby.</i>

431
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:50,477
Massa, does you want to
put your head on this?

432
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:53,240
- What's that?
- It's a pillow, massa.

433
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:56,646
Lady Margaret's own little pillow.
She always sleeps on it.

434
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,810
Then take it out and burn it up.

435
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:01,080
- Yes, massa.
- Wait a minute.

436
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:07,361
Never mind.

437
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:12,790
- That's all.
- Yes, massa.

438
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,868
Sweet dreams, massa.

439
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:55,105
- Good morning, milady.
- You're trespassing here.

440
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:56,108
This is my land.

441
00:29:56,244 --> 00:30:00,544
I set my mind on having a friendly
little talk with you this morning.

442
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:20,760
Are you all right?

443
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,262
Why didn't you fall on the horse
instead of letting the...

444
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:24,104
horse fall on you?

445
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,239
You'd think anybody's have
sense enough for that.

446
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,947
- Let me down.
- Well, good morning.

447
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,928
You've put on a little weight, as I
remember.

448
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:42,790
Put me down!

449
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:44,997
- Think you can stand?
- Yes. I'm quite all right.

450
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:47,384
Easy now. You'll only
start a convulsion.

451
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:49,496
There's a cozy little spot.

452
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:53,598
There you are.

453
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:56,431
Oh! Oh, you see?

454
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:58,436
You're scuttled fore and aft.

455
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,574
I think I'll have to put you to bed.

456
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:01,574
What?

457
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,802
I suggest that you lie
down for a spell.

458
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:07,606
Ah. There.

459
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:14,413
- You may go now.
- Oh, nonsense.

460
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,922
If the eyes fill with blood,
it's a sign...

461
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:17,923
the head's broken.

462
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:19,924
No, they're clear.

463
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:22,021
Although they seem a little
brighter than usual.

464
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:23,293
Don't touch me.

465
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:25,966
Now, my gal, I'm an expert
on broken heads.

466
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,087
I've seen thousands of them.

467
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:30,435
Couldn't have picked a better
doctor in all Jamaica.

468
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:32,938
Oh, a fine, hard skull.

469
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,433
Couldn't crack it with
a bung-starter.

470
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:38,944
Let's have a look at your ankle.

471
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:43,050
Go find my horse!

472
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:45,224
No gentleman would think of
leaving a lady at a...

473
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:46,652
moment like this.

474
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:48,588
Just lie still, please, and
behave yourself.

475
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,820
This oughta teach you to be
more sociable in the future.

476
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,052
No bones broken.

477
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,432
A muscle twisted.

478
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,694
- Does that hurt there?
- No.

479
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:03,703
Fetch me some water, please.
I feel faint.

480
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,705
You may have thrown your knee out.
I ought to investigate.

481
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,605
No! Go fetch me some water, please!

482
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:14,911
Well, that proves what
I've always said...

483
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:17,483
a woman's place is not on a horse.

484
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:49,962
There. Now, my gal, I suggest
that you stay like that...

485
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,752
until your color comes back.

486
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,854
What are you going to do?

487
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:55,853
I'm going to enjoy your society.

488
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:59,249
You seem much nicer than I thought.

489
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,692
Really, it occurs to me
you probably have...

490
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:02,694
a mother somewhere...

491
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,695
a nice, gentle, old lady.

492
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:07,032
- No, she died when I was a baby.
- Possibly a sister?

493
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:08,900
No, no, no. No kith or kin.

494
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,403
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

495
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:16,567
Is that why you... I mean,
why you went to sea?

496
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:20,408
- Would you like to hear about me?
- Oh, of course I would.

497
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:22,482
Well, it's quite a story.

498
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:24,812
I haven't thought about it
for a long time...

499
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,755
but I'd like to tell it to you.

500
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,656
I was 14, living alone
in London, when...

501
00:33:30,657 --> 00:33:32,626
the smell of the sea
got a hold of me.

502
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,627
I was apprenticed to an old law firm.

503
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,129
You're sure I'm not boring you?

504
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,201
- Oh, no. Not at all.
- Well...

505
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:09,394
Roger. Roger!

506
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:38,116
I give you my word on this,
Captain Leech.

507
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:41,228
I'll get you news of every English
treasure ship that sails...

508
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:44,125
when it's leaving and the
port it's making for.

509
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,392
It's a pretty offer, Mr. Ingram.

510
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:52,232
The nicest, prettiest offer
I ever had...

511
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,739
if you ain't lying or setting
a trap for me.

512
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:57,037
Judge for yourself. The
Prince Consort is...

513
00:34:57,145 --> 00:34:59,045
due at Port Royal in three days...

514
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,977
carrying English gold.

515
00:35:01,115 --> 00:35:04,380
It'll layover first at Port Lobos
to disembark passengers.

516
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,987
Prince Consort, eh? How many guns?

517
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:06,954
Forty.

518
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:08,956
- No escort?
- None.

519
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,889
We've got two ships and
a hundred guns.

520
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,891
We could chop her into kindling.

521
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,656
What are you asking for this
tidy piece of news?

522
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:18,663
A captain's share.

523
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,064
You'll hand it over to
Mr. Fenner here.

524
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,660
When I receive it, he'll return to
you with further information...

525
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,671
government information.

526
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,969
I'll send you back in a week,
Fenner, smothered...

527
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,977
in gold. Here you are, Mr. Ingram.

528
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:32,847
You're a dead man if you're fooling...

529
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:34,815
me and a rich man if you ain't.

530
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:46,994
It's the Prince Consort, all right.

531
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:49,963
Give her a blast and we'll board her.

532
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,798
They were waiting for us on the
award side of Point Lobos...

533
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:20,726
three of them.

534
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:22,796
The Black Swan engaged us first.

535
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,364
We fought till we were
ripped to ribbons.

536
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:29,401
We lost a 130 dead, 15 of them women.

537
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,971
And the gold gone, every box of it!

538
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,734
Gentlemen, this crime is
fouler than you know.

539
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:36,741
There's not only murder here,
but treachery.

540
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:38,641
Go on with your tale, Captain Blaine.

541
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,179
There are others who could tell
it better, Your Excellency.

542
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,114
And who are they, milord?

543
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:46,186
The friends of Pirate Leech who
supplied him with the news...

544
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,000
of where to fall upon the
Prince Consort.

545
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,392
Mr. Speaker, honorable members...

546
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:55,017
Leech has many old friends
in Jamaica...

547
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:57,030
friends in high position.

548
00:36:57,198 --> 00:37:00,031
There they are. Morgan, Waring,
Graham, Blue...

549
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:02,035
the whole lot of them.

550
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:04,899
Who else makes the
charge that I and...

551
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,906
my captains are traitors
to the Crown?

552
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:09,737
I do. Milords and gentlemen...

553
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:12,004
I say that so long as Morgan
sits as governor...

554
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,512
so long will English ships be
fed to his pirate friends.

555
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,849
- I call for a vote of impeachment!
- I vote for that!

556
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:22,016
Quiet! You do not vote
pirates off the seas.

557
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:24,851
You engage them, rake
and scuttle them.

558
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:27,517
Milords and gentlemen, we have ships,

559
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,529
brave captains and fine crews.

560
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:31,597
How do you stand on that, lads?

561
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,972
Are you ready to do a little
law-abiding killing for...

562
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:34,900
king and country?

563
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:37,196
- It's better than none!
- You sail tomorrow night...

564
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:38,170
with three ships.

565
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:40,192
- Captain Waring, take the Revenge.
- Aye, sir.

566
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:42,397
You're in command of the expedition.
Captain Graham.

567
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:43,993
- Aye, sir.
- You take the Reckless.

568
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:45,154
- Captain Higgs.
- Aye, sir.

569
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,010
Sail the Lady Bess. There's no
ship for you,

570
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:48,013
Tom Blue.

571
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:49,707
Aye, sir. I'll first-mate Jamie.

572
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:50,716
Good.

573
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:54,014
And now, my lads, will one of you
take a look in your crystal globe...

574
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:55,915
and tell these lords and
gentlemen where...

575
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,390
our old friend Leech is hiding?

576
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:00,459
Ha! I can see him as plain as the
nose on your face, Sir Henry.

577
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:01,925
- Tortuga!
- Right!

578
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:04,063
- And what do you think, Graham?
- I say Tortuga.

579
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:06,326
We are of a mind. That's where
he always went...

580
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,334
when he was shining with gold.

581
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:11,495
I can see him plain, standing head
down in a barrel of ale...

582
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,504
and hollering for more women.

583
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:16,508
Bottle him up in Tortuga Harbor.
Sink him, my lads!

584
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,564
And wipe Leech and the
black flag off the seas.

585
00:38:19,814 --> 00:38:21,679
You can tell these lords
and gentlemen...

586
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:24,182
they can rest easy in their
plush chairs, Sir Henry.

587
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:26,343
I'll bring you back a necklace
made of his teeth.

588
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:28,751
I told you when I took office...

589
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,754
that I would clean the Caribbean.

590
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:32,358
And clean it I will. And if I fail,

591
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:34,360
you can start your voting then.

592
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:36,528
Get to your ships, my lads,
and hoist your sails!

593
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,361
- Aye, sir!
- Aye, sir!

594
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:41,127
Milords and gentlemen, this
sitting is adjourned.

595
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:49,001
- I sent for you two hours ago.
- I come as soon as I heard, sir.

596
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:51,668
They're sailing for Tortuga tonight...
three ships.

597
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:53,677
- Can you get there ahead of them?
- Easy.

598
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,679
I can take the tide out in an hour.

599
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:57,681
Tell Leech to get out of Tortuga...

600
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:59,898
and to wait for the Royal Treasurer
off St. Thomas.

601
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,945
She's sailing for England
in a few days.

602
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,889
And tell Leech I know just
how much she's...

603
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,625
carrying and not try skimping
my share.

604
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,226
- Aye, sir.
- No, thank you.

605
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:09,852
- Get on! Stretch all your canvas.
- Aye, sir.

606
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:13,831
Sorry I was so long, Roger.

607
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:16,835
Who's that? He's been bothering
you a great deal lately.

608
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:18,495
Nothing troublesome, I hope?

609
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:20,506
No. The fellow wants some
government work.

610
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:24,407
I told him to try Morgan.
He looks like his kind.

611
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:27,838
Finished your shopping?

612
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:31,008
Oh, there's nothing to buy
in all Jamaica.

613
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:34,679
Oh, Roger, that man can it be
that he's following you?

614
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:37,188
I'm certain I've seen him before.

615
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:40,657
He has the most amusing notion.
He wants to be my valet.

616
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,854
A valet with one ear?

617
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,828
- Oh, he must be a lunatic.
- He is.

618
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,900
Oh, it's nothing against him.

619
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:50,060
The most famous valet in
London was a lunatic.

620
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:54,300
- Oh, Roger, you jest.
- No jest. Lord Londonry's valet.

621
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:58,003
It's a good thing you're not
going to London.

622
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,079
Oh, it's a good thing I am.

623
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:02,739
Lady Margaret, I have melancholy
news for you.

624
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:04,908
The proverbial aunt whom
I've never seen...

625
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:06,917
has proverbially gone to her rest...

626
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:10,285
and left me a rich man,
a very rich man.

627
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:12,824
Can that be the reason why
you've been so gay lately?

628
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,588
Yes. I'm afraid it hasn't
grieved me properly...

629
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:17,958
to know that I can have
the finest estates...

630
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:19,966
I want anywhere I choose
in the Empire...

631
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:22,296
and all the fancy vests
in London and...

632
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:24,597
And all the crackpot servants
with one ear.

633
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:30,300
I was going to speak of someone
with two tiny little ears...

634
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:32,378
that aren't listening.

635
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,020
Tortuga.

636
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:16,646
Point and a half off the
starboard bow, sir.

637
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:19,088
Larboard a little.

638
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,194
Aye, sir.

639
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:23,319
Can you make out the harbor yet?

640
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:24,930
Not yet, sir.

641
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,125
Steady. Steady her up.

642
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:30,635
Steady it is, sir.

643
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:33,137
Leech will anchor his ships
well inshore.

644
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:37,137
Shorten sail until the other
ships come abreast.

645
00:41:37,278 --> 00:41:39,212
Aye, sir.

646
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:45,211
- In gun sails!
- In gun sails! In gun sails!

647
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,193
Tortuga dead ahead!

648
00:41:57,331 --> 00:41:59,629
- Powder on deck?
- Aye, sir.

649
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,127
We'll sail in until we sight them,
make a larboard tack...

650
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,430
and rake them with broadsides
as we cross the harbor.

651
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:08,064
- Them's happy words, Jamie.
- Deep six and rocky!

652
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,268
Deep six and rocky!

653
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:12,276
Stand by with your matches
ready to fire.

654
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,278
Stand by with your matches
ready to fire.

655
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:16,212
Stand by with your matches
ready to fire!

656
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,750
And a half seven!

657
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:22,082
And a half seven!

658
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:27,023
A quarter less eight and rocky!

659
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:29,459
A quarter less eight and rocky.

660
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:32,589
Harbor clear! Not a ship in sight!

661
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:35,793
Not a ship in sight?
Where are they?

662
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:39,133
- Slid out on us. Thomas!
- Aye, sir.

663
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:41,639
Signal the captains to drop anchor
and join me aboard.

664
00:42:41,775 --> 00:42:43,640
- And Thomas!
- Aye, sir.

665
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:45,904
Get ashore and do some prowling
through Tortuga.

666
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:48,014
Find out what frightened
Brother Leech off.

667
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,139
Aye, sir.

668
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:57,084
Milords and gentlemen
of the assembly...

669
00:42:57,258 --> 00:42:59,818
three weeks ago, our
governor told us...

670
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,258
that actions speak louder than votes.

671
00:43:02,396 --> 00:43:05,923
He vowed to clear the Caribbean
of its sea butchers.

672
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:11,231
And what are his actions? How has
he kept his vow? I'll tell you!

673
00:43:11,372 --> 00:43:13,237
Another British ship has
been ravaged...

674
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:16,901
and sent to the bottom by the
brotherhood of the black flag.

675
00:43:17,044 --> 00:43:20,241
The Royal Treasury, with 100
passengers to England...

676
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:24,408
and a cargo of gold and silver
valued at $1,000,000...

677
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:27,019
has been destroyed, murdered
and gutted!

678
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:30,123
I call again for a vote
of impeachment!

679
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:32,623
And gentlemen, Morgan
has proved himself...

680
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,752
unable to meet the menace of
his old friends, the pirates.

681
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:37,794
As I have suggested from
the beginning...

682
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:40,957
perhaps he loves them too
well to bring them harm.

683
00:43:41,101 --> 00:43:43,126
- Who seconds Lord Denby's motion?
- I do.

684
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,070
I second the motion for an
impeachment vote.

685
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,935
Your fulminations, milords
and gentlemen...

686
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:50,441
are full of bilge and blather.

687
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:52,817
You can vote yourselves purple
in the face, look you...

688
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,745
but you'll not impeach me.

689
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,401
Before you can take me off this seat,

690
00:43:56,402 --> 00:43:58,082
I hold you need a letter
from the king...

691
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,098
and before you can get a
letter from the king,

692
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,386
I'll have Leech's head for you.

693
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:04,514
I'll serve it up to you on a platter
with an apple in its mouth.

694
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,965
My captains will bring Leech and
his buccaneers back...

695
00:44:06,966 --> 00:44:07,692
to Port Royal.

696
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:09,590
And I promise you this.

697
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,610
I'll hang a pirate in each of
your bedrooms...

698
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,652
to dangle over your heads
and give you the lie.

699
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,226
Ah! There's your answer,
you popinjays!

700
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:20,499
Captain Waring, You come
in the nick of time.

701
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:23,235
Come up here, Jamie-Boy.

702
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:28,241
Now, give us the full news
of your victory.

703
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:30,247
My report is of a private nature,
Sir Henry.

704
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:33,251
- I landed only a half hour ago.
- This is no time for modesty!

705
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:35,252
Out with it! Your full report.

706
00:44:35,374 --> 00:44:37,414
How many of the rats did
you send to the bottom...

707
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,871
and how many did you save up
to hang here at Port Royal?

708
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:42,632
We don't see any rat, neither catch
them, neither killer, Sir Henry.

709
00:44:43,364 --> 00:44:45,332
And that's how you keep
your vow, Morgan?

710
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:47,525
Three weeks and not
a pirate touched...

711
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:50,169
and our fleet sailing around,
quacking at the...

712
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,138
wind like a line of ducks
in a mill pond.

713
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,137
My lords and gentlemen,
I charge treachery.

714
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,765
- Right you are, Lord Denby.
- Treachery's the word.

715
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,435
Leech was warned of our coming.

716
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,879
Someone from Port Royal sent
a sloop racing to Tortuga.

717
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:04,896
The same ship that brought
them news of the...

718
00:45:04,897 --> 00:45:06,786
Prince Consort and the
Royal Treasurer.

719
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,785
This is the final insult.

720
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:10,522
The brave captain hides
his bungling...

721
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:12,391
behind accusation against us.

722
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:14,584
I demand proof of this
foul accusation.

723
00:45:14,762 --> 00:45:17,196
I'll bring you proof before I'm done.

724
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:19,298
I've come back for supplies.

725
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:22,193
I'm rejoining my ships, and then
we're going to search the Caribbean

726
00:45:22,194 --> 00:45:23,002
until we find Leech.

727
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,628
Where are your ships hiding now,
Captain Waring?

728
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:28,708
That I'll not answer in this place.

729
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:31,709
My lords and gentlemen...

730
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:34,525
if you'll appoint me messenger,
I'll take this matter to the king.

731
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:35,115
Hear, hear.

732
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:37,089
I'm embarking for England
in two days with...

733
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,517
my bride the Lady Margaret.

734
00:45:39,953 --> 00:45:42,455
They commissioned me to
present the case...

735
00:45:42,456 --> 00:45:45,323
of Pirate Morgan, Pirate Waring and
Pirate Leech to His Majesty.

736
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:48,139
And I'll bring back the royal
signature upholding the impeachment.

737
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:50,082
I move we approve the impeachment
of Morgan.

738
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,563
I second the move.

739
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:54,085
The move for impeachment has been
made and been seconded.

740
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:55,846
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to
call the members.

741
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:57,632
- Lord Jarnegan.
- I vote impeachment of...

742
00:45:57,704 --> 00:45:58,636
Henry Morgan.

743
00:45:58,772 --> 00:46:01,104
Mr. Geoffrey Clive.

744
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:03,108
Get back to your roosts,
you popinjays.

745
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,630
- Sir William Courtenay.
- I pronounce this sitting adjourned!

746
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:08,071
I vote impeachment of Sir Henry
Morgan, governor of Jamaica.

747
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:10,375
- Mr. Stuart Marshall.
- I vote impeachment of Sir...

748
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:12,017
Henry Morgan.

749
00:46:12,152 --> 00:46:15,212
I wish my nature hadn't changed.

750
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,119
I'd have made that whole
assembly walk the plank.

751
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:21,294
You can't go wrong drowning
politicians, Henry.

752
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:25,728
No, no. We're just daydreaming,
Jamie.

753
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,130
How soon will you have your
ship loaded, Thomas?

754
00:46:28,235 --> 00:46:29,133
Another 3 hours, sir.

755
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:31,229
- You can take the tide out tonight?
- Aye, sir.

756
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:34,102
Good. It's four days to Maracaibo.

757
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:35,241
Five.

758
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:36,682
And how do you make that out, Jamie?

759
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:39,197
Because I'm not sailing tonight.
I'm sailing tomorrow night.

760
00:46:39,198 --> 00:46:40,944
- And why?
- I have a call to make.

761
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:42,816
- Where?
- It's a personal matter.

762
00:46:42,817 --> 00:46:45,818
You're on that tack, are you?
That idiot child of Denby's.

763
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:48,499
- Well, my lad, you leave her alone.
- I'm having a talk with her.

764
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,354
And getting your face slapped again!

765
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:52,988
No, Jamie-Boy, the girl's
a bride tomorrow.

766
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:55,469
- Good riddance for you.
- I'm staying in Port Royal tonight!

767
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,230
You'll get on your ship
tonight and sail...

768
00:46:57,297 --> 00:46:58,857
her out, or you're no
captain of mine!

769
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,018
If I see the Revenge in port
when the tide's running.

770
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:01,933
I'll board her myself.

771
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,669
And you can stay behind
and get your...

772
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:04,897
face slapped pink and blue...

773
00:47:04,898 --> 00:47:07,162
by as many hussies as you like!

774
00:47:11,512 --> 00:47:13,447
Now, go on, Jamie-Boy.
You've got your orders.

775
00:47:13,448 --> 00:47:15,278
I'll be watching your topsails.

776
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,407
And don't forget, it's not
Margaret with...

777
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:20,419
an apple in her mouth
I want, but Leech.

778
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,926
I never see you like
this before, Jamie.

779
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:35,660
Hanging your head like a
pelican over a wench.

780
00:47:35,802 --> 00:47:39,238
And if you ask me, a flouncy wench...

781
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:41,967
with no more feeling than
a load of clams.

782
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,839
If you kick her in the heart,
she'll break your leg.

783
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:46,843
Aw, Jamie-Boy...

784
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,414
there's hundreds of wenches
prettier than her...

785
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:53,042
all ready to leap into your arms
if you give them a whistle.

786
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,495
- Church bells.
- Aye.

787
00:48:02,663 --> 00:48:04,528
Some people likes to hear them.

788
00:48:04,665 --> 00:48:06,963
I like trumpets better.

789
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,931
- I can see her now.
- Who?

790
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,167
The Lady Margaret standing
up in church...

791
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,174
tomorrow beside that
goose-faced Ingram.

792
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,778
Hey, you're going down the
wrong road, Jamie.

793
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:20,780
Will you lend a hand, Tommy?

794
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:23,773
Jamie, by land or sea, you
can always rely on...

795
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,785
Tom Blue for wrongdoing
of any nature.

796
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,777
What do you want?

797
00:48:54,114 --> 00:48:57,481
I didn't know you were a thief and
a housebreaker too, Mr. Waring.

798
00:48:57,618 --> 00:49:01,213
Oh. Still barking at me, eh?

799
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,430
I expected to find the bride cooing,

800
00:49:04,431 --> 00:49:06,358
and with a soft light in her eye.

801
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:09,013
But I suppose you're saving that
up for the ceremony tomorrow.

802
00:49:09,014 --> 00:49:10,395
You suppose correctly.

803
00:49:10,464 --> 00:49:12,398
It would be much better
for both of us,

804
00:49:12,566 --> 00:49:14,431
me gal if I hated you as I should.

805
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:17,093
I am not interested in your
emotions, Mr. Waring.

806
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:19,157
Unfortunately, I have a
tender feeling for you.

807
00:49:19,973 --> 00:49:21,773
Oh, I'm as annoyed with
the fact as you are.

808
00:49:21,774 --> 00:49:23,576
I doubt that.

809
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,803
Why I'm spending time on you,
I don't know.

810
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:28,676
You're as arrogant and silly a wench
as ever I've run afoul of.

811
00:49:28,815 --> 00:49:31,135
I don't know which I'd rather see
hanging from a yardarm,

812
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:31,656
you or Leech.

813
00:49:31,657 --> 00:49:33,415
If you'll go now, I promise
to think...

814
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:35,421
over your tender declaration.

815
00:49:38,425 --> 00:49:40,723
I didn't know a woman could
do this to a man...

816
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:42,621
make him itch to strangle
her one minute...

817
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:43,542
and marry her the next.

818
00:49:43,543 --> 00:49:46,898
- Oh, so you want to marry me?
- We'll discuss that later.

819
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:49,969
I dislike having to call the
servants to throw you out.

820
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:53,436
Look at you... hating me...

821
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,666
and your eyes saying, "Don't go away.

822
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:58,039
"I belong to you. Make me
belong to you.

823
00:49:58,178 --> 00:50:00,618
"Keep me from marrying this oily
little jackanapes, Ingram."

824
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:03,745
- You're mad.
- No, I've read your eyes right.

825
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:05,909
I've known too many hellcats
not to know...

826
00:50:05,986 --> 00:50:07,920
what's behind all that
blaze and bluster.

827
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:10,335
Confound it, you idiot, I'm telling
you that I love you.

828
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:12,355
And you'll call me "Jamie-Boy"
before...

829
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,360
you call that stick of
a man "husband."

830
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:17,659
Well, are you coming with me or not?

831
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:20,562
Your conceit, Mr. Waring, has
unhinged your mind.

832
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:22,566
I warn you. Don't make me angry.

833
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:25,638
I always knew you were a nasty,
vulgar rogue.

834
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:29,404
Don't touch me!

835
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,115
<i>Be quiet! Lie still, I tell you!</i>

836
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:41,448
Be quiet, or I'll crack that
iron skull of yours.

837
00:50:41,588 --> 00:50:44,682
You make courtship a little more
strenuous than I like it.

838
00:50:55,035 --> 00:50:56,935
Holy Moses! Jamie!

839
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,750
Grab her feet and help me
get her inside.

840
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:00,537
Stand by to cast off.

841
00:51:06,346 --> 00:51:08,541
You're flirting with trouble, Jamie.

842
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:10,616
Cast off, I tell you!

843
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:14,649
- Lie still.
- Giddap.

844
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,053
Lie still, you...

845
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:21,888
- Where's that horse blanket, Thomas?
- I'm-a sittin' on it.

846
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:24,656
I can't understand why you give
her a second look.

847
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:27,460
- She's nothing to me, you fool.
- But she's mean, Jamie,

848
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:28,796
and she's ungrateful.

849
00:51:28,935 --> 00:51:31,495
Morgan will bellow his brains out
when he hears of this.

850
00:51:31,638 --> 00:51:33,503
It's for Morgan I'm doing it.

851
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,200
This'll keep Ingram anchored in
Jamaica and away from the king.

852
00:51:36,267 --> 00:51:38,267
It'd be a lot prettier if you
could put Ingram...

853
00:51:38,268 --> 00:51:39,940
in a sack and drown him.

854
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,516
I can see no good in drowning her.

855
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,982
I'm not drowning her, Thomas.
Not yet.

856
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:48,087
Stop your clacking and drive on.

857
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,860
- Potatoes?
- No, thank you.

858
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:57,827
- Meat?
- No.

859
00:51:57,964 --> 00:52:00,694
- How about a little bread and cheese?
- I'm not eating with you.

860
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:03,268
- Oh, you'd rather starve, huh?
- Yes.

861
00:52:03,403 --> 00:52:06,167
A little fasting wouldn't
hurt you any.

862
00:52:06,306 --> 00:52:08,536
Also, it might improve your manners.

863
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:09,540
My manners?

864
00:52:09,676 --> 00:52:12,577
Look at it calmly. I kept you from
marrying a fellow you hated.

865
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,873
That's a lie.

866
00:52:14,948 --> 00:52:16,948
Don't argue with me while I'm eating.

867
00:52:19,419 --> 00:52:21,939
I put you on a fine ship, give you
the best cabin and stick...

868
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,740
a bolt on your door.

869
00:52:22,756 --> 00:52:24,485
Thanks for the bolt.

870
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,493
If you were really grateful, you'd
tell me something.

871
00:52:27,627 --> 00:52:30,267
Someone in Port Royal has been
coming into a lot of money lately.

872
00:52:30,268 --> 00:52:33,131
- What do you mean?
- Someone who hates Morgan...

873
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:35,291
and has been playing partners
with Leech...

874
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:37,903
giving him information and
collecting a captain's...

875
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:39,971
share of the booty, or
I miss my guess.

876
00:52:41,608 --> 00:52:43,473
I can tell by your change of color...

877
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,443
that you know someone who's
had a windfall lately.

878
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,276
- Who is it? That fine father of yours?
- No, my f...

879
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:53,443
Ingram then. Well, why
don't you answer?

880
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,027
You're not after Leech. You would
like to make me believe...

881
00:52:56,028 --> 00:52:58,457
something foul against a decent man!

882
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,791
You didn't answer me. Come in.

883
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,793
What is it, Thomas?

884
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,023
We just found a split in the
main brace, Captain.

885
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,179
Will you have a look at it?

886
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,601
- A split in what main brace?
- We also located...

887
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:12,466
- a barnacle on the cathead.
- What?

888
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,440
- Oh, uh, I'll be right up.
- Aye, sir.

889
00:53:16,576 --> 00:53:18,942
And, uh, if you want to eat behind...

890
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:20,946
my back, I promise not to notice it.

891
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:26,652
There's two of them, Jamie.

892
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:38,024
<i>It's Leech.</i>

893
00:53:38,164 --> 00:53:40,564
<i>I knew it the minute I sighted</i>
<i>the topmast.</i>

894
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,192
- The Black Swan.
- And the Hawk, I make it.

895
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:46,134
They've sighted us, all right.

896
00:53:46,273 --> 00:53:49,333
We're no match for the pair of them.
We may as well run for it.

897
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,410
We can't outrun the Black Swan.

898
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,412
We'd be pounded to splinters
in a fight.

899
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:55,605
We can't fight with 100
guns against us.

900
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:57,614
We can't fight, and we can't run.

901
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:00,049
Nothing left to do but to disappear,

902
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,054
which ain't practical.

903
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:03,908
Run up the black flag and
head her around.

904
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:04,829
We're gonna join Leech.

905
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:08,890
But you can't fool Leech with a
baby trick like that, Jamie.

906
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:10,894
Hoist the Jolly Roger.

907
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:13,056
It's a beggar's chance,
but our only one.

908
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,997
By this time, our ships are at
Maracaibo waiting for us.

909
00:54:16,136 --> 00:54:19,128
We'll join Leech and lead
him to Maracaibo.

910
00:54:19,272 --> 00:54:21,467
He's not an easy man to lead, Jamie.

911
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,051
Main braces.

912
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,314
Back your main yards.

913
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,968
Come on. Get back to your
cabin and stay there.

914
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,679
Why? So I won't see that flag and
know what you are?

915
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:10,415
I'm captain of this ship, and
you're taking my orders.

916
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,687
That's Leech and his cutthroats.
We can't fight and we can't run.

917
00:55:13,688 --> 00:55:15,568
There's only one way to
get out of this alive,

918
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:17,289
and that's to tell Leech
I've left Morgan.

919
00:55:17,379 --> 00:55:19,459
That's exactly what I thought.
Mr. Ingram is right.

920
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,866
You are working with Leech.

921
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:23,993
You've got a head made of iron.

922
00:55:24,137 --> 00:55:26,128
Get in there and think what you want.

923
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:45,457
Come aboard, Captain. Come aboard.

924
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,032
And welcome.

925
00:55:55,702 --> 00:55:57,636
We had a hard time finding you,
Captain.

926
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,740
Don't try any fancy tricks on me,
Waring.

927
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:03,194
You're under my cannon, and
I can blast you out of the...

928
00:56:03,195 --> 00:56:03,941
water with a wink.

929
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:06,807
You chucklehead. Do you see
anything on this ship...

930
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,986
that looks like we was planning
to go into battle?

931
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:12,576
If you're smart, you'll stop
jabbering and talk sense.

932
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:22,453
All right. Let's hear
you make sense.

933
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,494
Why did you turn back?

934
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:28,158
To join you, if you're still
interested in Maracaibo.

935
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:32,704
Oh. And I suppose the other ships
are hunting me to join me too, eh?

936
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:35,501
I never seen a man so suspicious.

937
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,802
- What's your answer?
- My answer is they're after...

938
00:56:37,844 --> 00:56:39,778
your neck, Leech.

939
00:56:39,913 --> 00:56:42,438
But I'm not with them.
I'm after gold.

940
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,017
Did you desert Morgan?

941
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,679
The way I look at it, Morgan
deserted me...

942
00:56:50,857 --> 00:56:52,984
taking up with that pack
of jackanapes.

943
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,184
I'm not of a mind to end up
playing government...

944
00:56:55,261 --> 00:56:57,195
with a quill stuck behind my ear.

945
00:56:57,363 --> 00:56:59,228
I stood it as long as I could.

946
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:01,492
But Morgan or no Morgan, I'm here.

947
00:57:01,634 --> 00:57:05,035
You're lying, Waring, you were
with him yesterday.

948
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,969
You told the assembly you were
sailing off to capture us.

949
00:57:08,108 --> 00:57:10,099
You get your tidings quickly,
don't you?

950
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:13,041
Yes. And they've always been right.

951
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,739
You've a skull for thinking, Captain.

952
00:57:15,882 --> 00:57:17,747
What else could I tell the assembly?

953
00:57:17,884 --> 00:57:20,318
I've no hankering to grow
on a gallows tree.

954
00:57:20,453 --> 00:57:22,318
Enough of jawing. Do we
sign articles or not?

955
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:25,583
There's a hole in it, Waring.

956
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:28,556
If you deserted Morgan and left...

957
00:57:28,628 --> 00:57:30,562
the other ships to join me...

958
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,257
why did you go back to
Port Royal at all?

959
00:57:37,504 --> 00:57:40,667
Well, come on. Out with it. Why?

960
00:57:40,807 --> 00:57:42,934
To get my wife.

961
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:56,150
Oh, here you are, my dove.

962
00:57:56,289 --> 00:57:58,009
These good gentlemen seem
to doubt that...

963
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,922
I have a pretty wife aboard.

964
00:58:00,093 --> 00:58:03,085
Will you come out, my sweet,
and give them a look at you?

965
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:10,727
My love, may I present Captain Leech.

966
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,861
Madame Waring, daughter
of the former...

967
00:58:12,939 --> 00:58:14,873
Governor of Jamaica, Lord Denby.

968
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:17,288
Now you know why I'm not too
welcome back in Port Royal.

969
00:58:17,343 --> 00:58:19,368
- Captain Waring...
- Yes, my dear. What is it?

970
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:23,414
I'm pleased to meet you, ma'am.
My apologies, Captain.

971
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:27,611
I'd go back to Port Royal myself to
pick up a lady of such caliber.

972
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,518
Then we'll forget the
misunderstanding.

973
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:33,330
Do you want to join forces for profit,
or shall we be on our way?

974
00:58:33,331 --> 00:58:35,751
Aye, we'll sign articles.

975
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,796
And just to guarantee that your
ship will come along to help us...

976
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,799
you and the lady sail with
me on the Swan, eh?

977
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,562
It'll make the trip jollier.

978
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:45,570
That's a fair bid.

979
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:48,345
But I don't fancy subjecting my wife,
who is a delicate creature,

980
00:58:48,346 --> 00:58:49,026
as you can see...

981
00:58:49,075 --> 00:58:50,940
to that riffraff crew you
have aboard.

982
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:53,568
Madame, you'll be treated
like the queen ya are.

983
00:58:53,713 --> 00:58:55,647
I promise you I'll slit
the throat of the...

984
00:58:55,715 --> 00:58:57,649
first dog that brings a blush to you.

985
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,218
You can't ask for more
than that, Captain.

986
00:59:00,353 --> 00:59:02,514
Are you agreed or not?

987
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:04,589
Agreed.

988
00:59:04,757 --> 00:59:06,918
- Mr. Blue!
- Aye, sir.

989
00:59:07,093 --> 00:59:09,527
Take over. And to assure
Captain Leech...

990
00:59:09,596 --> 00:59:11,530
that you're an honest man...

991
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:14,766
sail abreast of the Swan
at all times.

992
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:16,792
Aye, Captain.

993
00:59:25,678 --> 00:59:29,944
"All other officers to get one share.

994
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:33,177
"Article eight. Each captain
has a right...

995
00:59:33,353 --> 00:59:36,447
"to value all spoils before
they are divvied up."

996
00:59:36,623 --> 00:59:38,488
That's what we all agreed
to at Tortuga.

997
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:40,354
Stick your name on it if you're
favorable.

998
00:59:40,426 --> 00:59:41,358
I'm considering...

999
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,962
There's no denying that
you know the...

1000
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,964
Gold Coast better than anybody
on the Main.

1001
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:49,591
It'd be a shame for you to waste
your talents up at Port Royal.

1002
00:59:49,736 --> 00:59:52,170
- My share's always been 10.
- There's no arguing.

1003
00:59:52,305 --> 00:59:54,273
Five you'll get.

1004
00:59:54,407 --> 00:59:57,467
You'll nip enough out of the first 2
prizes to set you up for a year.

1005
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:01,376
What's the sense of waiting around
for some lumbering merchantman?

1006
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,379
Why not hit straight for Maracaibo?

1007
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,484
It's still the richest spot on
the Spanish Main.

1008
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:11,488
Maracaibo is the plum we're
after picking, my lad.

1009
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,293
Oh. I'll sign.

1010
01:00:15,461 --> 01:00:17,326
Stick you name right there.

1011
01:00:17,463 --> 01:00:19,590
Have a drink.

1012
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:24,269
I'll do my drinking in Maracaibo.

1013
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:29,107
Good night, gentlemen.

1014
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:33,679
He's got some articles in his
cabin what need signing.

1015
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:36,005
Get out!

1016
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,151
Get out!

1017
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,318
You can't come in here!

1018
01:00:44,457 --> 01:00:47,722
With so beautiful a wife, they'd
think it strange if I didn't.

1019
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,624
I want to congratulate you for
showing a spark of reason.

1020
01:00:50,763 --> 01:00:52,883
You saved both our hides, for the
time being anyway.

1021
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:55,365
All you got to do is
keep on looking...

1022
01:00:55,435 --> 01:00:56,475
at me with adoring eyes...

1023
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:58,436
and maybe we'll get out
of this in one piece.

1024
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,436
- You monster!
- Shh!

1025
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,098
No love spats, my gal. Our friends
may be listening.

1026
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,562
Did you find out who the traitor is
who warned these men?

1027
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,614
Oh, you're not so certain
anymore it's me, hmm?

1028
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,150
I'm certain of nothing except
that I'll be murdered...

1029
01:01:13,219 --> 01:01:15,153
before I get out of this,
thanks to you.

1030
01:01:15,288 --> 01:01:17,483
We're not dead yet, my gal.

1031
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,422
- You can't sleep here.
- I'm afraid I'll have to.

1032
01:01:25,398 --> 01:01:27,263
Are you very lonesome for Jamaica?

1033
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,835
Don't shout when you answer me.

1034
01:01:29,836 --> 01:01:32,828
Yes.

1035
01:01:32,972 --> 01:01:36,703
And you still regard me as a beast
unfit for human society?

1036
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:38,708
Yes.

1037
01:01:38,845 --> 01:01:41,871
And you're still in love
with Mr. Ingram?

1038
01:01:46,419 --> 01:01:48,887
I said, are you still in love with
that darling man?

1039
01:01:49,055 --> 01:01:51,023
Don't you dare come near me.

1040
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:56,193
Don't worry, my gal. I won't.

1041
01:01:56,329 --> 01:01:58,559
Not until you call me Jamie-Boy...

1042
01:01:58,698 --> 01:02:00,427
and ask me three times.

1043
01:02:30,029 --> 01:02:32,725
Be careful how you wake me up.

1044
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:34,733
I'm ready to repel all boarders.

1045
01:02:53,453 --> 01:02:55,387
Sweet dreams.

1046
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:37,657
Shh! Keep still. You'll get
your throat cut.

1047
01:03:37,797 --> 01:03:39,731
Lie down.

1048
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:49,698
What do you want?

1049
01:03:50,776 --> 01:03:54,712
I have come to offer me apologies.

1050
01:03:54,847 --> 01:03:57,407
Me oldest friend gets married,
and I forget...

1051
01:03:57,483 --> 01:03:59,417
to give him a wedding present.

1052
01:04:03,022 --> 01:04:05,286
It's off the Royal Treasurer.

1053
01:04:05,992 --> 01:04:09,189
She was on her honeymoon.

1054
01:04:09,328 --> 01:04:11,262
Thanks for the gift, Leech.

1055
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,229
As pretty a sight as I ever seen.

1056
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:20,339
Lawful wedlock.

1057
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,306
There's nothing like it.

1058
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:29,174
Now, that's a strange place to
stick a sword right over...

1059
01:04:29,248 --> 01:04:30,180
the bride's head.

1060
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:32,181
Are you trying to make her uneasy?

1061
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:34,148
Your presence is more disturbing...

1062
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,154
to Madame Waring, I assure you.

1063
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:40,282
Now, Jamie, you're talking different
than you used to.

1064
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:42,518
I recall your trading me
a gal in Portobelo...

1065
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:44,529
for two barrels of rum.

1066
01:04:44,664 --> 01:04:48,964
Of course, this one's better
and worth more.

1067
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:52,400
She's all in one piece. She's got
two ears, no fingers missing.

1068
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:54,472
Worth three barrels of rum.

1069
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:56,734
Why don't you offer him five?

1070
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,743
Don't tempt him, darling.
I might take it.

1071
01:04:58,878 --> 01:05:01,904
That's teaching her, Jamie.

1072
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:09,010
You seem to enjoy subjecting me to...

1073
01:05:09,188 --> 01:05:11,622
every kind of embarrassment possible.

1074
01:05:11,757 --> 01:05:14,021
No, my sweet. Now, don't be a snob.

1075
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,186
We're pulling close to
Maracaibo, Leech.

1076
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,170
You're gonna be little good to us if
you keep laying your head in a...

1077
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:20,931
bottle every night.

1078
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,628
I'm beginning to think you're
right, Jamie-Boy.

1079
01:05:27,773 --> 01:05:30,674
I'm gonna need my head
more than I figured.

1080
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:42,352
- Get out of this bed.
- Do you think it's safe?

1081
01:05:42,488 --> 01:05:44,422
You didn't have to get in here.

1082
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,524
You're very ungrateful, madame.

1083
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:48,524
I'm sleeping with a
pistol after this...

1084
01:05:48,661 --> 01:05:51,027
and if you come near me,
I'll shoot you.

1085
01:05:52,632 --> 01:05:54,497
Here you are.

1086
01:05:54,634 --> 01:05:56,693
I give you permission to
blast my head off...

1087
01:05:56,836 --> 01:05:59,168
if I'm ever idiot enough to come
within a foot of you.

1088
01:05:59,305 --> 01:06:03,366
Hey, Captain, where'd you go hiding?

1089
01:06:03,509 --> 01:06:07,536
- We opened another keg.
- Aw, get away!

1090
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,944
I'm thinking.

1091
01:06:10,082 --> 01:06:12,482
Thinking? Thinking what, Captain?

1092
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:15,450
I don't know.

1093
01:06:15,588 --> 01:06:19,251
I won't know until the wind's
blown my head clear.

1094
01:07:30,362 --> 01:07:32,626
- Where is he?
- Oh, Sir Henry!

1095
01:07:32,765 --> 01:07:35,199
Jamie Waring! Where is
that toad of a man?

1096
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:38,098
- How did you come here?
- Don't mince around!

1097
01:07:38,237 --> 01:07:40,102
Fetch the deserter out of his hiding.

1098
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:42,571
Captain Jamie dropped off to
Port Royal for supplies.

1099
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:45,308
- We've had no word of him.
- Well, I will give you word of him.

1100
01:07:45,309 --> 01:07:48,680
He left Port Royal with Denby's
puling child in a sack.

1101
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:51,134
Stole her out from her home,
look you, like a red Indian.

1102
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:51,935
What, Captain Henry?

1103
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:55,019
I am sitting in me new wig
as lord of Jamaica...

1104
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:56,947
when 100 foaming parents
come clattering...

1105
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,489
and howling for me life's blood.

1106
01:07:58,624 --> 01:08:01,457
- They scuttled you?
- No, I cracked a dozen skulls...

1107
01:08:01,594 --> 01:08:03,754
and fought me way to the
waterfront with the whole...

1108
01:08:03,755 --> 01:08:05,596
of Jamaica heaving stones at me...

1109
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:08,962
and hid myself in a stinking
load of trout.

1110
01:08:09,101 --> 01:08:11,331
Hoisted sail that night,
and for three days...

1111
01:08:11,403 --> 01:08:13,337
I've been chewing raw fish.

1112
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:16,272
Well, don't gape at me. Fetch me
some ale before I blow away to dust!

1113
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:27,351
Get out of the way there, make
room for Sir Henry.

1114
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:30,812
Uh, sit down, Sir Henry.

1115
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:35,489
Do you think Captain Jamie has
deserted, or do you...

1116
01:08:35,561 --> 01:08:38,496
count on him coming to Maracaibo?

1117
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:41,930
I am only praying that Lady Margaret
does not stab him in his sleep.

1118
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:44,427
For I have my own plans for him.
Aye, I've dreamed them...

1119
01:08:44,436 --> 01:08:46,370
all the way from Port Royal.

1120
01:08:46,505 --> 01:08:50,373
The minute that drooling traitor
sets his nose into Maracaibo...

1121
01:08:50,509 --> 01:08:52,374
I am taking his innards out
and stringing...

1122
01:08:52,444 --> 01:08:54,378
them to the tops of his masts.

1123
01:08:54,513 --> 01:08:56,606
What about Leech, Sir Henry?

1124
01:08:57,917 --> 01:09:00,317
Do not call me Sir Henry.

1125
01:09:00,486 --> 01:09:02,748
Jamaica is lost, and
'my title with it.

1126
01:09:02,749 --> 01:09:04,989
Our only chance of getting them back
and keeping off...

1127
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:05,790
the king's gibbet...

1128
01:09:05,791 --> 01:09:08,191
is to bring in the heads of Jamie
Waring and Billy Leech...

1129
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:10,647
with Lady Margaret in good enough
repair to bespeak us...

1130
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:11,963
as her saviors.

1131
01:09:12,097 --> 01:09:14,657
Post your lookouts around
the waterfront.

1132
01:09:16,302 --> 01:09:19,703
And wake me up at the first
sign of that wench-fancier.

1133
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:41,783
- Are you awake?
- Yes.

1134
01:09:43,162 --> 01:09:46,154
- Can you swim?
- No.

1135
01:09:46,298 --> 01:09:49,062
That's too bad.

1136
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:52,659
- Have you ever seen a sea battle?
- No.

1137
01:09:52,805 --> 01:09:55,000
Well, you're gonna see
one pretty soon.

1138
01:09:55,074 --> 01:09:56,006
A battle?

1139
01:09:56,141 --> 01:09:59,542
Then I'd better get dressed.

1140
01:09:59,678 --> 01:10:01,543
Don't look.

1141
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,342
Me gal, I have other things on
my mind for the moment.

1142
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:09,012
- Who will be in the battle?
- We will.

1143
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:11,053
My ships, the Reckless and
the Lady Bess...

1144
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,055
are waiting for me in Maracaibo now.

1145
01:10:13,192 --> 01:10:16,457
Why didn't you tell me?

1146
01:10:16,595 --> 01:10:19,758
You've been a little critical of me
ever since we started.

1147
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:22,424
English ships.

1148
01:10:22,568 --> 01:10:26,231
Yes. Leech and his crew are
sailing into Maracaibo...

1149
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:29,637
expecting to find a few cannon
and an old stone wall.

1150
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:32,175
- Instead, they're finding 100 cannon...
- Stay as you are.

1151
01:10:32,176 --> 01:10:34,711
Don't move or I'll blast you!
Tie them up.

1152
01:10:34,847 --> 01:10:36,439
Have you gone mad, you scurvy idiots?

1153
01:10:36,515 --> 01:10:37,447
Quiet!

1154
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:40,484
- We're an hour from battle.
- I'll crack your head for you.

1155
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:42,375
Put 'em down...

1156
01:10:42,376 --> 01:10:43,816
You lied to me about having a bride.

1157
01:10:43,856 --> 01:10:46,056
What else did you lie to me about?
Are your friends...

1158
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:47,250
waiting for me in Maracaibo?

1159
01:10:47,251 --> 01:10:50,094
Friends? What friends?
I've signed with you.

1160
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:53,426
Aye, signed and bound, foxy Jamie.

1161
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:56,261
I'm sailing the Revenge into
Maracaibo myself...

1162
01:10:56,402 --> 01:10:59,049
under English colors, with
my own crew aboard...

1163
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:01,210
and I'm blowing whoever's waiting
out of the water...

1164
01:11:01,211 --> 01:11:03,731
while they're still whistling and
waving handkerchiefs at you.

1165
01:11:03,732 --> 01:11:05,532
And what's more, I'm taking
the gal with me.

1166
01:11:05,533 --> 01:11:07,773
- I'll not go with you.
- You'll fare better with me...

1167
01:11:07,774 --> 01:11:08,414
than with Jamie.

1168
01:11:08,503 --> 01:11:10,183
I promise you. I'll marry
you fair and...

1169
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:11,616
stick no sword over your head.

1170
01:11:11,784 --> 01:11:14,480
He's safer out of the way now.

1171
01:11:14,653 --> 01:11:17,588
No, not yet. We may be
doing him an injustice...

1172
01:11:17,756 --> 01:11:19,781
and if we are, I shall want
to beg his pardon.

1173
01:11:19,959 --> 01:11:21,839
But if we aren't, I'll wanna
do more things...

1174
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,594
to him than stick him clean
with a sword.

1175
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:26,061
Come along, my gal.

1176
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,962
No! Let me go! Let me go!

1177
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:50,787
Now, be quiet.

1178
01:11:50,923 --> 01:11:54,017
You'll have to wait till after the
battle for your wooing.

1179
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,024
I promise you. If you
start screaming...

1180
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:58,857
you'll get the flat of a
sword across ya.

1181
01:12:17,783 --> 01:12:19,876
It's the Revenge, sir.

1182
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:22,282
What are your orders?

1183
01:12:22,454 --> 01:12:24,649
Let her come in and moor.

1184
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,070
But if there's a gentleman called
Jamie Waring aboard...

1185
01:12:27,192 --> 01:12:30,719
- bring him to me, alive if possible.
- Aye, sir.

1186
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:38,894
Look at him, bringing her in
like a fumbling lubber.

1187
01:12:39,038 --> 01:12:41,006
Forgot all he ever knew
about sailing a ship.

1188
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:43,608
I can't make it out.
He's sailing queer.

1189
01:12:43,742 --> 01:12:45,767
He is love-crazy.

1190
01:12:45,911 --> 01:12:49,005
That's very obliging of them...
coming down...

1191
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:51,015
to the shore to bid us welcome.

1192
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:53,414
Steady. Steady her up.

1193
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:56,486
Well, you may lock me up in a hole,

1194
01:12:56,555 --> 01:12:59,490
you varmints, but you
can't sit on me.

1195
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,093
Here's to you. Bottoms up.

1196
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:06,220
You bloody jackanapes!

1197
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:17,498
- They ought to be taking in sail.
- Blue must be drunk.

1198
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,123
Roast me alive! He's coming in like
he was going to blast us!

1199
01:13:20,212 --> 01:13:23,181
Ready! Fire!

1200
01:13:26,585 --> 01:13:29,486
Jamie Waring, that black-livered
turncoat!

1201
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:31,555
He's handed his soul back
to the devil!

1202
01:13:31,723 --> 01:13:34,317
Get to the ships and blow
the traitor to dust!

1203
01:13:41,366 --> 01:13:43,664
Get to the fort guns!

1204
01:13:45,437 --> 01:13:47,735
A broadside!

1205
01:14:06,058 --> 01:14:07,548
Fire!

1206
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,189
- Hard over!
- She don't answer.

1207
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,189
The tiller's gone.

1208
01:15:20,032 --> 01:15:21,966
She's gone.

1209
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,702
Lose your sheets!
Lose your sheets!

1210
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:34,244
Turn loose your braces!

1211
01:15:46,225 --> 01:15:48,159
Lively there!

1212
01:16:12,884 --> 01:16:15,011
Graham!

1213
01:16:15,187 --> 01:16:16,814
- Aye, sir.
- Keep pouring your fire...

1214
01:16:16,888 --> 01:16:17,820
into the Revenge.

1215
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,190
And get me 20 men, I'm going
to board her, and with...

1216
01:16:20,191 --> 01:16:20,957
me own hands...

1217
01:16:21,093 --> 01:16:23,093
pull the gullet out of the mouth
of that traitor,

1218
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:24,562
- Jamie Waring.
- Aye, sir.

1219
01:16:59,331 --> 01:17:01,162
Tommy Blue!

1220
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:05,565
- Tommy!
- Jamie.

1221
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,366
All hands stand by...

1222
01:17:08,507 --> 01:17:12,170
and when I tell you, heave the
hatch cover, come out fighting.

1223
01:17:12,311 --> 01:17:14,575
Get ready, boys.

1224
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,880
Here, what are you d...

1225
01:17:24,089 --> 01:17:26,580
Captain Leech, look!

1226
01:17:28,427 --> 01:17:30,054
Heave!

1227
01:19:13,598 --> 01:19:15,930
You blasted king's spy!

1228
01:19:22,407 --> 01:19:24,967
- Where is she?
- Down in my cabin.

1229
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:33,742
Jamie, we finished that
bunch of sea li...

1230
01:20:35,547 --> 01:20:39,244
I warned you myself about crossing
swords with Leech.

1231
01:20:39,384 --> 01:20:41,352
Here. Let me see, Jamie.

1232
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,056
Missed your gizzard by an inch.

1233
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:48,954
Rather a neat hole and squirting
blood like a bilge pump.

1234
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,028
Is he done for?

1235
01:20:51,162 --> 01:20:54,131
Leaking a little, but on
even keel, Captain.

1236
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,360
Good. I was afraid he would
be thwarting me...

1237
01:20:57,502 --> 01:21:00,665
by giving up the ghost prematurely.

1238
01:21:00,805 --> 01:21:03,797
Lady Margaret, my humble
apologies to you...

1239
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:07,002
for the foul antics of this gentleman
who was once my friend.

1240
01:21:07,145 --> 01:21:09,670
I assure you that every indignity
you have suffered...

1241
01:21:09,748 --> 01:21:11,682
at his hands will be avenged.

1242
01:21:11,816 --> 01:21:14,216
I'm taking him back to Port Royal
and hanging him on the...

1243
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:15,217
dock in chains...

1244
01:21:15,353 --> 01:21:18,811
and there he'll dangle to brood on
his crimes till he's stoned to death.

1245
01:21:19,024 --> 01:21:21,822
- Permit me to unfasten you.
- I don't understand you, Henry...

1246
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,825
or what you've got against
poor Jamie.

1247
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,962
I've been with him constant,
glued to his side...

1248
01:21:26,096 --> 01:21:28,696
and I've never seen him commit
anything in the way of a crime...

1249
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:30,828
except maybe a little
weak-mindedness.

1250
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,569
He stole this innocent child from
her parents' home, look you...

1251
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:36,405
and forced his will on her
like a mad savage.

1252
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:39,442
That, sir, is striking at the
roots of civilization.

1253
01:21:39,578 --> 01:21:41,546
And he'll speak his apologies
from the gibbet...

1254
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,614
to this unfortunate girl
and all her kin.

1255
01:21:43,748 --> 01:21:46,308
- He did not steal me, Sir Henry.
- What did you say?

1256
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:48,452
I came with him of my own will.

1257
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:51,952
- You'll swear to that?
- Yes, on a bible.

1258
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:54,090
He said he would like my
company on a sea trip...

1259
01:21:54,146 --> 01:21:56,226
and I told him I would be
delighted to go with him.

1260
01:21:56,261 --> 01:21:58,381
I feel exceedingly grateful to
Captain Waring for...

1261
01:21:58,463 --> 01:21:59,361
his hospitality.

1262
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:01,346
The girl is mad.

1263
01:22:01,347 --> 01:22:03,194
Captain, we've just
finished the count.

1264
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,599
The pirates have suffered 200 killed,
70 wounded...

1265
01:22:05,737 --> 01:22:07,805
and we've taken 130 prisoners.

1266
01:22:07,806 --> 01:22:10,798
- What are your orders?
- Hoist sail.

1267
01:22:10,942 --> 01:22:14,503
I'm going to take this mad
woman back to Jamaica.

1268
01:22:14,646 --> 01:22:16,580
Aye, sir.

1269
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:26,120
Well, we've had a nice taste of fun,
Tom Blue.

1270
01:22:26,257 --> 01:22:29,192
Aye. That we have, Henry.

1271
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:32,922
Nothing like it to keep
your ears pink.

1272
01:22:33,064 --> 01:22:36,166
Look you, it wouldn't
take much arguing...

1273
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:38,135
to talk me out of Jamaica.

1274
01:22:38,269 --> 01:22:40,829
Who wants to be sitting around
stuffed with lace...

1275
01:22:40,972 --> 01:22:43,736
and a wig shutting the wind
from your head?

1276
01:23:03,795 --> 01:23:07,356
Look at that sea.

1277
01:23:07,499 --> 01:23:10,034
And the world stretched
around you like...

1278
01:23:10,035 --> 01:23:12,003
a barrel of gold ready
to drop in your lap.

1279
01:23:12,137 --> 01:23:14,605
It's the only life, Henry.

1280
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:18,175
Say the word and the
Caribbean is yours.

1281
01:23:18,309 --> 01:23:21,403
<i>Captain Waring! Captain Waring!</i>

1282
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:23,480
Clear the deck for action, Henry.

1283
01:23:23,615 --> 01:23:25,515
Here comes the last broadside.

1284
01:23:28,019 --> 01:23:32,718
Jamie-Boy, you shouldn't
be out of bed.

1285
01:23:32,857 --> 01:23:35,018
Haven't you caused me enough
trouble already?

1286
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,424
Get back to your bunk.

1287
01:23:37,562 --> 01:23:39,689
Oh, Jamie-Boy.

1288
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:41,924
That's only twice. Once more.

1289
01:23:42,067 --> 01:23:44,035
I said, three times.

1290
01:23:45,336 --> 01:23:47,236
Jamie-Boy.

1291
01:23:47,372 --> 01:23:49,533
You're not going to leave me
in Jamaica?

1292
01:23:49,674 --> 01:23:51,642
Oh, that I don't know.

1293
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:55,473
I always sample a bottle of
wine before I buy it.

1294
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:59,447
Come on. Let's have a sip to see
if you're worth taking along.

1295
01:24:04,422 --> 01:24:06,583
What, no bites?

1296
01:24:08,426 --> 01:24:12,021
There he goes. It's the end
of the Spanish Main.

1296
01:24:13,305 --> 01:25:13,337
