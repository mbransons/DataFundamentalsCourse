1
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,400
Honey.
Wake up.

2
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,300
You sleep okay?
Oh! Me?

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Never better. Like a log.
Good, 'cause your shower's ready.

4
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Oh, thanks.

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Morning.

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,500
Morning, Alex.

7
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,000
Morning.
Hi, Mommy. Did you sleep good?

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Mm-hmm. I'll wake Kenny.
Okay, but don't touch his woobie.

9
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,100
It's gonna be a beautiful
day in Detroit today.

10
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,500
Weather man says we're
going to have sunny skies.

11
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,000
There's a lot of traffic out there.
A lot of beautiful cars, though.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,500
We want you to roll up the window,
lean back and enjoy all the good sounds...

13
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,500
We're gonna be playing
this morning.

14
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,100
Of course I always play your favorites.
Alex! Don't.

15
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,900
'Cause I'm such a nice guy.
No!

16
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,100
Ah, damn.

17
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Morning, baby.

18
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,100
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

19
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,100
How did you sleep?
Hmm? Should we go get daddy?

20
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,700
Shall we? Oops!

21
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,100
There you are.

22
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,300
Morning. Good morning.
Morning, campers.

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,600
How's everybody?

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Hiya, Megan.
Great. Trucks.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,600
What are...

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,600
What are we watching here,
Kenny?

27
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,100
Robots. Thank you.

28
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,300
Thanks, babe.

29
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,600
Okay.
Here's the joke of the day.

30
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,100
What's green and rides
through the west?

31
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,000
The lone pickle.

32
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Okay.
They're onto me, hon.

33
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,600
We're all onto you, honey.

34
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,600
That's them. I gotta go.

35
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Okay, baby. Bye.
Thanks.

36
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,400
Don't change a thing. Leave that
face exactly like that, all right?

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,600
I don't want it washed by the time
I come home, 'cause it looks great.

38
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,200
Call me later!

39
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,300
Oh, man. What's the record for
the least amount of sleep ever?

40
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,100
I think Lindbergh has it.
Well, I think I beat him last night.

41
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
You heard anything, Jinx?

42
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
If I did, wouldn't I tell you guys?
Not necessarily.

43
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,100
that's right. you didn't tell lou until
after he chipped in for gas money.

44
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,100
Hey, fellas, I'm telling you.
It's as simple as this.

45
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,900
If you can't sell cars,
you can't pay people.

46
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Now, come on, relax.

47
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I like splitting gas money four ways.

48
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,600
Hey.
Hey, Butler.

49
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,600
How you doin', gents?
Havin' a good time?

50
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,700
I love it. I love comin' down here,
watchin' something go...

51
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,200
from the drawing board
to the assembly line.

52
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,100
It's a treat.
Yeah, it's thrilling for us too.

53
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,600
Yeah. Real thrilling. What's the
matter, boys? You look depressed.

54
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,700
You worried about the lions? They're
slow starters. Don't worry. It's pre-season.

55
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Hey, we ain't worried about the lions!
What we're worried about is the lines.

56
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Amen.
Lines?

57
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,700
Yeah. Unemployment lines, welfare lines,
food lines. You know, those lines?

58
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,200
Lines, lines.
Yeah.

59
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Me and my wife went to the movies
the other night. We saw Rocky.

60
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,200
And I'm watching this movie
and I'm thinking...

61
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,500
There's something about this
movie that reminds me of work.

62
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,700
Which Rocky was it?

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,700
One or two? Or three?

64
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Uh, one, I think.
I don't know.

65
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
Who was he fightin'?

66
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,200
- Hey, did he have a mohawk?
- Like Mr. T?

67
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
I don't know. I don't remember.
The point is,

68
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,200
here's a guy who's taking
a pretty bad beating, you know?

69
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,700
He's up against the ropes,
his eye's cut...

70
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,100
Was his manager
dead or alive? Yeah.

71
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,200
All right, forget Rocky. Forget I
brought it up. Get it outta your head.

72
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,700
The point is, when you're down,
you're not necessarily out.

73
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,200
You know... I mean...

74
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,200
You gotta hang tough.
I don't... I don't know.

75
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,800
Jack Butler,
report to the staff office.

76
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,300
I gotta go, guys.
See you later.

77
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Well, hang tough, baby.
Yeah, be Rocky!

78
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,800
# Watch his left!

79
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
They're gonna
knock him out, baby.

80
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Think so?
He didn't see Rocky.

81
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,600
Larry! Larry!

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,000
Are you crazy?
What'd you do that for?

83
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Why didn't you tell me this
morning I was being canned?

84
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,800
I couldn't say anything until
it was official! Wait a minute!

85
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,300
Wait a minute, guys.
Wait.

86
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,800
Oh, Jinx. You did it, didn't you?

87
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
You fired these guys after
all they've contributed. Jack.

88
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,300
Aw, don't "Jack" me.
After the support! Jack.

89
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,100
Aw, man, the devotion
they gave you.

90
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,900
You're fired too.
Now you fire me.

91
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,200
I... I'm fired?

92
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,800
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill ya! You...

93
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,300
You're not fired.

94
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,100
Technically furloughed.
Why don't you give me a break!

95
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm telling you, there's blood
all over my slide rule!

96
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,300
None of it's yours, Jinx.
Aw, come on, come on.

97
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,300
Something's gonna turn up.
You guys are terrific engineers.

98
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,900
You're too damn good not
to catch on somewhere.

99
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,300
Where am I gonna catch on?
Where we gonna catch on?

100
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,800
Nagasaki?
The Ruhr Valley?

101
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,600
You're not exactly walking
out of here empty-handed.

102
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,700
You've got your full severance.
You got your profit sharing.

103
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,400
Here. Guess what.
A surprise.

104
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,300
Full pro rata refund
for this month's gas.

105
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Great. There's only one more
thing I want. What's that?

106
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,100
Disability!
Oh, no! No! Oh, no! No!

107
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
Larry! Larry!
Come on! No! No!

108
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,400
Keep that sense of humor,
buddy. It's critical. Hey! Jinx!

109
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,300
Oh, no!
Hold it!

110
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,800
Larry! hey!
Get the valium.

111
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,900
# Plop, plop, fizz, fizz oh,
what a relief it is #

112
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,400
See you guys.
Jack, keep in touch.

113
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,900
Uh, I will, Larry.
You all right?

114
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,100
Oh, yeah. Okay. 'Cause
remember what Jinx said.

115
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,400
Keep that sense of humor.
It's critical. Humor.

116
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,900
Love you, Jack!

117
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,900
Alex, Kenny, come on.
Hurry up!

118
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,400
That's good. Step to.
Hup, two, three, four. That's it.

119
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,200
Nice, boys.
You look real nice.

120
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,400
Does daddy know
he got fired yet?

121
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,900
Yes, but we're not gonna mention
it to him, are we, honey?

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,900
We want daddy to feel good,
don't we? You hear that?

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,700
He's coming now.
Everybody smile real big.

124
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,900
Hi, dad!

125
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Hey. Hi.
Boy, you guys look nice.

126
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,400
What, do you all have dates
or something?

127
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,200
We heard you got fired.

128
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Laid off.
Just laid off, remember?

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
Technically, furloughed, sport.

130
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,200
You're not a bum, are you, daddy?
No, but I'm workin' on it.

131
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,500
You want my woobie?

132
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,100
Actually, I kinda would like it.
But instead I'll take a kiss.

133
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,900
Okay, come on, everybody.
Let's eat dinner.

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,100
We're having special dinner.
What are we having?

135
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,500
Colonel chicken.
We can't afford that!

136
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Yea! Let's enjoy it.
It may be our last.

137
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,500
You know, I know this sounds crazy,
but I actually feel great.

138
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,300
I don't know why. I don't
know why, but I feel great.

139
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,000
I do, you know. Because, I don't know,
now I'll have the time...

140
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,500
to do some work around the house
I've been wanting to get to.

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,500
And, you know, we're in pretty
good shape. Yep, we are, for a while.

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Wait, what do you think? I'll never get
another job again? Don't worry about it.

143
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,000
I already put the word out.
What would you say if I did too?

144
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,000
Did too do what?

145
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,000
I put the word out.

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I have a couple of years' experience
in advertising. I have a college degree.

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,500
There's no reason I shouldn't try to get a
job myself. Have I been missing something?

148
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,000
I mean, has your phone
been ringing off the hook?

149
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, no, Jack. You think you're
gonna get a job before I do?

150
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, this isn't a contest. No, hon.
This'll be good. This is a good idea.

151
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,000
We'll make it a contest.
It'll be fun. What?

152
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,500
I'll bet you a hundred to one
you don't get a job before I do.

153
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,000
Jack... okay, come on, doll face.
Give me a dollar.

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,600
I don't even have a dollar. Oh, you
wanna bet, but you don't have a dollar?

155
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,100
Hey, I don't wanna bet. Hey, I thought
somebody said they wanted to bet.

156
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,100
Wait till I get the kids.
I don't bet. I don't believe in bets.

157
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
You're bettin' now.
Alex, Kenny! Come here.

158
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I want you to know it's comin'
out of my severance pay too.

159
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Come on, guys. Hurry. this is gonna be fun.
I'm makin' mommy a bet.

160
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,100
Daddy's betting mommy a hundred
dollars to just her one dollar...

161
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,600
Wow. That she doesn't
get a job before me.

162
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Kenny, hold the money. I better
hold it, dad. Money makes him crazy.

163
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,900
Good point.
It isn't healthy.

164
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,200
Well, it may not be healthy,
but it's fun. Right, guys?

165
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,100
Oh, Jack. Can we bet too?
Absolutely!

166
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,800
Yea!
Yea!

167
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,000
Take the money, Caroline.

168
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,000
Jack, I don't want the money.

169
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Look, you won. A bet's a bet!

170
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,000
Jack, I don't take bets,
and I don't want your money.

171
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,000
Aren't you being a little hard
on yourself? No! It's fine!

172
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,600
I mean, you have applied to everything
on wheels from Toyota to Schwinn.

173
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,500
You're gonna get a job
any day now. Really.

174
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,300
Uh-oh, I'm going to be late.
My first day.

175
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,600
I want to make a very good
impression. How do I look?

176
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,000
You look great. You're gonna
make a great impression.

177
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,500
Now, do you wanna go over
that list one more time?

178
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,100
No, I don't wanna go over the list!
Okay. Let's go over the list.

179
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,600
Remember, when Kenny starts talking to his
breakfast, that means he's finished, right?

180
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,100
Alex has school at 7:30.
His pickup is 1:00 sharp. 7:30. 1:00.

181
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,600
When Megan starts rubbing her
ears, it's time for her nap. Nap.

182
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,100
But don't let her sleep past 11:30, because
she won't go down for her afternoon nap.

183
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,600
Wait. Will she rub her ears again?
No. Just in the morning.

184
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
And please don't let her sit around
in a wet diaper. Obviously, hon.

185
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,600
Kenny, he'll pretty much take
care of himself, won't you?

186
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,900
Just keep him busy. Give him
his tinkertoys or his coloring book.

187
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,600
I think Alex will be a little
helper, won't you?

188
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,100
Sweetie. All right, just relax.
There's nothing to this, you know.

189
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,400
We got it covered.
Right, guys? Okay.

190
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,600
Oh, boy, am I gonna miss you guys.

191
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
- Take it easy on daddy. Remember,
he's a rookie. - Bye, mom.

192
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,100
Bye, honey.
Mommy?

193
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,100
It's a jungle out there.

194
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,600
Very funny, Jack.

195
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,600
I don't know where he gets this.
On second thought, I will take this money.

196
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,500
I might need it for lunch
or something special. Okay.

197
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,600
Actually, a lot of men would love to have
this kind of time to spend with their kids.

198
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,600
Hon, you're looking at one.

199
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,200
I'm a regular Phil Donahue here.
Yes, you are.

200
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Okay, okay.
Come here. Okay.

201
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Go get 'em.

202
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Oh, thanks for the loan.

203
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
Dad, you passed it!

204
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Passed what? We're right on time.
But you're doing it wrong.

205
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Mommy doesn't do it
like this.

206
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,700
We're gonna do it the Jack Butler
method. What is this? This is nuts.

207
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Why are they all honking?

208
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Because you're doing it wrong.

209
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,500
Tell me I'm doing it wrong.
I know how to do this.

210
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,200
Hi, Jack. I'm Annette.

211
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,300
- Hi.
- You're doing it wrong.

212
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,200
See?

213
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,300
This is what i tell all my new mommies:
We enter from the south...

214
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,200
and we exit from the north.

215
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,200
And we do just the reverse
when we pick up.

216
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
This way our little ones
don't have to walk

217
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,300
between the cars to
get to the learning facility.

218
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,300
Okay, move it out,
and remember, south to drop off,

219
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,800
north to pick up. pick 'em up.
Okay! That's a good system.

220
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
South to drop off, moron!

221
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,300
Actually, I'm very excited to be going
back to work, especially here with Ron.

222
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,300
Ron?
And who would Ron be?

223
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,300
Oh, Ron Richardson.

224
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,800
Everyone here at the
Richardson-Frankel agency...

225
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
calls him Mr. Richardson.

226
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,400
Well, he asked me to call him Ron.

227
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,800
And when was that?
In what context?

228
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,900
In the context of my
interview at lunch.

229
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,300
Lunch?
Mm-hmm.

230
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Well, now, before we go in here,
let me give you some advice.

231
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,900
Keep your mouth shut
and your ears open,

232
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
and you just might
learn something.

233
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,900
You want to knock it off?

234
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,100
Ron, what is your position?

235
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Thank you.

236
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,400
My father founded this agency
on schooner tuna.

237
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,900
It's the cornerstone
of all our accounts.

238
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,900
So my position is,

239
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,200
somebody better figure out a way to
sell some tuna fish pretty damn quick.

240
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,500
We have people to do that.

241
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,900
Sorry. Habit.

242
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Everybody, uh, please
welcome Caroline Butler.

243
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,800
- Hello.
- Hi, Caroline.

244
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,900
Since you're probably the only one in
the room that got a decent night's sleep,

245
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
maybe you could have
a fresh opinion.

246
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Do, uh, any of these layouts...
does anything make sense to you?

247
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,900
Uh...

248
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm not qualified to judge anything,
really. It's my first day, and...

249
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,500
- You ever eat tuna fish?
- Yes.

250
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,000
You're qualified.

251
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Okay, well, I uh... let's see here.

252
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, uh, this is very good.
I like... it's mermaids?

253
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,900
Original.
Caroline.

254
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,500
"Yum, yum, tuna bits. "
That's very funny.

255
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,000
Cut the crap.

256
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,400
Right.

257
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,200
Look, you want me to be
really honest with you?

258
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,500
No. Lie to him.
He likes it.

259
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, frankly, none of this stuff
would influence me. All right?

260
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,100
Ooh.
That's good.

261
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Come on, Ron. She doesn't know
a tuna fish from a cheerio.

262
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,800
Damn good thing we don't have
the cheerio account.

263
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,000
When was the last time any of you
people were in a supermarket?

264
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,000
Harriet housewife.

265
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,100
Good morning, shoppers.
We have some specials this morning,

266
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,900
and we'd like to let you know
about them.

267
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,400
Over in the frozen food section...
Kenny, where are the eggs?

268
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
Over there, dad.

269
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,900
- Remember, we're a volume store...
- I have the right of way.

270
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,200
Right. Sorry. Here.
We'll settle out of court.

271
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,200
Oh, weirdo.

272
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,100
Irv! Clean up in aisle four.

273
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,000
Aisle four, check.

274
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Irv!
Clean up in produce!

275
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Kenny! Did I tell you not
to touch the grapefruit?

277
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,000
Next. May I have a half
a pound of ham?

278
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,500
Boiled, baked, smoked, salt-cured,
sugar-cured, prosciutto or westphalian?

279
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Forget it. Just tell you
what, just give me, uh...

280
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,000
give me a half pound of salami.

281
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,500
Italian, kosher, hard, pork,
beef, cotto or what?

282
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Uh... just get bologna, mister.

283
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll tell you what. Just give me
a quarter pound of cheese.

284
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,300
American, bleu, cream, cottage,

285
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,500
gouda, edam, provolone,
romano, swiss.

286
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,600
- Your entire cheddar family. - Can you
run the hams back one more time?

287
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,100
I just want...

288
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,200
Stay right here, okay?
Comin' back.

289
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,600
Half pound of salami, half pound of swiss,
half pound Virginia ham, two celery.

290
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,600
- I think these are on special.
- Doesn't matter. Go ahead.

291
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,600
Let me check. Irv, are these
kotex maxi pads on special?

292
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,100
- Never mind, Irv! Forget it.
- Kotex, 19 cents off.

293
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,300
Thanks, Irv.

294
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,600
All right, Ken.

295
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,600
My baby!
Who are you?

296
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Steven. Mom!
Kenny!

297
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,100
Ken!
Mom!

298
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Here, eat this spaghetti.
Irv, spaghetti on aisle nine.

299
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,600
Spaghetti, aisle nine. Check.

300
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Kenny!

301
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,900
Hey, I'll trade ya.
My kid for yours.

302
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,100
Thank you.
I don't have any kids!

303
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,400
- Did you see my little girl?
- Yeah. She's adorable.

304
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,600
- She's lost. - You left a
child in a shopping cart?

305
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,300
Irv, one lost child.
Lost child alert.

306
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,100
There she is!

307
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,100
There's your daddy.
She's yours and I'm Joan.

308
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
Hi. Thanks. Caroline told me you'd
be around. Can I give you a hand?

309
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
You can give me both of 'em.
I don't know what the hell I'm doin'.

310
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,600
Irv, clean up on aisle seven!

311
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,700
Irv, we were never
in aisle seven. Honest!

312
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,100
Not so easy, is it?
Boy, I'll say.

313
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,700
Might even be the toughest job
in the entire world.

314
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Bends your back, drives you nuts,
and it makes your boobs droop.

315
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,200
So don't be ashamed
about asking for help.

316
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,600
Mommy training can be very,
very tricky, and I can help...

317
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,200
With sitters and shopping and menus,
and even if you just want to talk.

318
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,700
Here's my number. All right. Thank you.
What's this say underneath?

319
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,600
Any time.

320
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,700
Okay. Kenny!
What are you doing?

321
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,400
# He's married #

322
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,700
# So were we once #

323
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,300
# Oh, Susanna oh,
don't you cry for me #

324
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,300
# 'Cause I come from Alabama
with my banjo on my knee #

325
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,300
Where is everybody?
Up here.

326
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,300
# Susanna oh,
don't you cry for me #

327
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,300
# We're coming... #
Hi, everybody. Mommy's home.

328
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,800
Hi, mommy. How was your day?

329
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Oh, it was, uh... it was terrible.

330
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,400
I wasn't there five minutes and
I was thrown into this meeting...

331
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,900
with people yelling and
screaming at each other,

332
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,200
and then they were
screaming at me,

333
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,800
and there's a secretary that
hates me for no reason.

334
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,700
- Want me to go and kick a little
ass, honey? - Yeah, dad!

335
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,300
All right. The only one that
was even civil to me was Ron.

336
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,100
Ron? You know, Mr. Richardson? He
actually asked for my opinion, and when

337
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,700
I told him honestly how I felt about
something, Ron liked what I had to say.

338
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,600
He did. Ron and his group
are flying to the plant tomorrow,

339
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,900
and they're gonna tour it,
and I was invited to go.

340
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Is than an unbelievable
first day or what?

341
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,500
I can't believe it.
How 'bout you guys?

342
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,400
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

343
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,000
We can't believe it, hon.
None of us can. We're stunned.

344
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Honey, I can't believe this.

345
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,900
Oh. Well, I didn't want
his feet to get wet.

346
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,400
Somebody must have died.

347
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Why?
There's a limousine out front.

348
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Oh. You didn't say anything
about a limousine last night.

349
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,400
Ron said he was sending a car,
but he didn't say anything about a limo!

350
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,400
Tell him I'll be right down.

351
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,200
Ron. Oh, Ron.

352
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,900
Hey, Ron.

353
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Whoa. Damn it.

354
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,400
Well, hello down there.

355
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,400
Why don't you run and tell your
mommy that Mr. Richardson is here.

356
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,000
Stay right here. I'm not supposed
to let strangers in the house.

357
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,500
How you doin'?
You must be Ron Richardson.

358
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
I'm Jack Butler.
Nice to meet you.

359
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,200
- Pleased to meet you.
- Huh?

360
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,400
I said, I'm pleased...

361
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,000
to meet you.

362
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm just waiting for Caroline.

363
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Well, Ron, you know women.

364
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,500
Yeah, I like to think I do.

365
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,000
Want a beer?

366
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,400
It's 7:00 in the morning.

367
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Scotch?

368
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,500
Not during working hours.
Oh, I'm sorry, pal.

369
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,000
No problem. come on over here.
Let me show you what I'm doin'.

370
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,500
Takin' advantage of some of the time
off to add a whole new wing on here.

371
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,500
I'm gonna rip these walls out,
and, uh, of course, rewire it.

372
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,500
You gonna make it all 220?

373
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah, 220, 221.
Whatever it takes.

374
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,400
You sound like a pretty handy guy.

375
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,500
Yeah. well, I like to do
a little bit of everything, Ron.

376
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,400
I write poetry, I paint,
sculpt and... oh.

377
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,500
Oh, Caroline.
Don't you look nice.

378
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Thanks. I'm sorry
if I kept you waiting.

379
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Oh, not at all. I was just having a
little chat here with your hubby, uh...

380
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,500
- Jack.
- Jack.

381
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Yeah, he's quite a guy.

382
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,900
So, I guess we better get going.

383
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,100
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Jack, a real pleasure.

384
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Ron.

385
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Very nice outfit, honey.
Thank you.

386
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,100
Honey, if you call and I'm not here,
I'll be at the gym or at the gun club.

387
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,300
How'd you like a little trim
on that mustache, Ron?

388
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Humphries is tough. He's probably
the toughest client we've got.

389
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,800
But, you know, I think you've
got two things going for you.

390
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,000
Number one, your experience
as a homemaker.

391
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
You're fresh from the
trenches of consumerism.

392
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,300
And... oh, thank you very much.

393
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,600
Oh, boy. and, number two,
you've got a...

394
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Let's just say you're an
extremely attractive woman.

395
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Well, thank you.
And my husband thanks you too.

396
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,300
Yeah, I'm glad you brought up,
uh... what's his name?

397
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,700
- Uh...
- Jack.

398
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,800
Jack. Uh...

399
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,900
- What do you mean? - I mean we're
gonna be working long, hard hours,

400
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,800
and you might be coming home
pretty late at night.

401
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,400
And, well, if there's gonna be a problem,
I want you to tell me about it right now.

402
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Well, there's not gonna be
any problem, see?

403
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,300
Jack supports everything I do.

404
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,500
As a woman, in my career,
as an executive, he supports me.

405
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,400
And if we can agree that you
are an executive, mm-hmm.

406
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Then you can stop
cutting my steak.

407
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,400
Oh! Hmm.
Sorry.

408
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,400
I don't think we can fit any more.

409
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Sure, we can.

410
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,900
We can get some more in there.

411
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,900
You know, when your dad was in the
army, we had to run a tight ship.

412
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,400
There were no ships in the army.

413
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,900
Just put the laundry in.
Dad, can we fix lunch?

414
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,400
Sure. Anything but, uh, tuna.

415
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
"Add here. "

416
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Wait a minute.

417
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Save a couple of steps here.

418
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,500
Give it everything, I guess.

419
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,000
Butler? You got a problem with
your horizontal hold? I don't know.

420
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,000
Your wife says you do.

421
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,500
Well, she ought to know.
Come on in.

422
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,000
I'll be right back.
I get 45 bucks an hour.

423
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,500
Oh, Megan. You're makin'
me crazy, baby.

424
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,600
You're makin' me nuts.
Da-da.

425
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,600
Yeah, yeah, I love you.
But you're making me crazy.

426
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Stay. Hey, Kenny.

427
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,600
Go keep an eye on your sister.
Play with her or something. All right?

428
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,500
Go watch TV.

429
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,400
You want some chili?

430
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,100
No, thanks. Hey, where's your
mom keep the vacuum cleaner?

431
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,100
You mean jaws?

432
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Mom calls the vacuum
cleaner "Jaws"?

433
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
Yeah.
Where is it?

434
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Over there.

435
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,600
Jaws.

436
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Exterminator.
I can't hear you.

437
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Exterminator.

438
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,100
- What?
- Exterminator!

439
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,900
- Go to the front door.
- Okay.

440
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,100
Come in.

441
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,800
Hi. I'm here to adjust the pilot on
your water heater. Okay by me.

442
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Hi. Anything wrong?

443
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,100
No, no.
Fine, fine.

444
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,800
Dad, help!

445
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Dad! Dad!

446
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,700
Dad!

447
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,700
Dad, my woobie!

448
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,200
Okay, Kenny. Now look.
Run, Kenny, run!

449
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,700
Whoa!

450
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,800
You crazy?
You fed a baby chili?

451
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,800
Where's mommy keep
the extra diapers?

452
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
Hey! Cowards.

453
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Holy mackerel!
Aw, man.

454
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,600
Sorry I'm late.

455
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,100
Well, I'm glad somebody
had a good day.

456
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,400
Have a seat. I'll call you when
he's ready. Thank you.

457
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,100
How about roasted
eggplant? I don't...

458
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,900
Well, does your wife like seafood?
Seafood smells up the kitchen,

459
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,900
and it can take hours
to get rid of the odor.

460
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,500
No, how about something simple?

461
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,200
I got a hamburger 'Wellington'
that's out of this world.

462
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,400
Great. Let me have it. Okay. Start with two
pounds of ground round, lean and mean.

463
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,500
Brown it in some butter.
Yeah.

464
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
Pardon me. Could you
use margarine in that?

465
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Oh, no... well, butter's my personal choice.
But butter can scorch.

466
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,400
- Higgins, you're next.
- Why don't you go ahead?

467
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,900
And I'll go after you.
You were here first.

468
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,900
That's okay. I...
I have no place to go,

469
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,900
and besides that, there's not a job
available anywhere in this city.

470
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,900
Okay, Butler.
I guess you're next.

471
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,900
I'd sure like to have a copy of that
when I come back. Uh, sure. Yeah?

472
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,900
Drain all the excess fat.

473
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,700
Well, you're mad, aren't you?
I'm not mad.

474
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,400
I'm not mad. It's just not where
I want to be right now.

475
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,200
Mm-hmm. Well, Jack,
I can't not go.

476
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,000
Please do it for me, would you?

477
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,500
You know how many of these
things I went to for you?

478
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,400
A lot.

479
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,000
We'll stay ten minutes.
Ten minutes.

480
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Ten minutes?
Fifteen, tops.

481
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
All right. Okay.
Fair enough.

482
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,800
But if we stay longer than that,
we pull the old aunt Emily.

483
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,000
Okay. The aunt Emily.
Right.

484
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,400
Wow.
What a house.

485
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Yeah. Probably mortgaged
to the eyeballs.

486
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,000
Not this one. His great-grandfather,
commander Richardson, built it.

487
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah. Hand-me-down.

488
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,500
Oh, thank you.

489
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,500
You must be pretty darn proud
of our little Caroline, huh?

490
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,000
Oh, yeah.

491
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,000
We're, uh, very proud of her. The children
are, and we're all real proud at home.

492
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
She earned that promotion,
I can assure you, Jack.

493
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,000
It was a little promotion. I forgot to
tell you about it. It was no big deal.

494
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,500
Ladies and gentlemen.

495
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,000
Welcome to the Richardson-Frankel
annual corporate olympics!

496
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Butler, you're a sportsman.

497
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I was kind of counting on you to
take part in this. Spouses are eligible.

498
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,900
Yeah. I don't know.
Uh... aw, come on.

499
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,700
Nobody takes it seriously.
It's just good clean fun.

500
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,500
I know, Ron. Normally,
I'd say yeah, but I'll tell you,

501
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,500
we've got to get over to see,
uh, Caroline's aunt Emily.

502
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,000
She's... dying.
Sick.

503
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,000
Dead.

504
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,500
Well, why don't you stick around
for a few minutes anyway,

505
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,000
and you can, uh, watch
with the rest of the wives.

506
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,200
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean families.

507
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Boys, run down to the car and get dad's
sweatpants and shoes and stuff out.

508
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,900
Hey, all right.
I'll stick around for a while.

509
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,500
Looks like we got ourselves
a little competition this year.

510
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,900
- Butler is a real jock. - Oh, boy.
That's all we need. - Yeah.

511
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Relax, Butler.
You're not gonna win anyway.

512
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,000
Why not?
He that good?

513
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,100
He's the boss.
It's his tournament. You get it?

514
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,100
Yeah, but I don't work for him.

515
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,600
No, but your wife does.

516
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,900
What's he doing?
Winning.

517
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,300
You threw it, didn't you?
You did good, dad.

518
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,300
Thanks.

519
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,300
I owe you one, Jack.

520
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,800
Come on. Let's go.
Sure you're okay?

521
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Yeah.

522
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,300
I did it!
I really did it!

523
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,300
Kevin, please.

524
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,300
Just kiss me once more.

525
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,300
You know what that's going
to lead to, don't you?

526
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,800
I... I want it to lead there.

527
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,300
I want to feel alive again.

528
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,400
I can't believe people
actually watch this stuff.

529
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,900
So I'm not the father of the child.

530
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,900
Well, that's some consolation.

531
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,900
Just who is the culprit?

532
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,800
You don't wanna know.
Let me guess.

533
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,900
Probably the deceased Mr. Cashman.
Ha. Wrong, Vic.

534
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,300
Wrong.
Nikki doesn't even love you.

535
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,700
Vic, open your eyes. buddy. She's been
makin' it with your friend Kevin.

536
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,400
- You mean Kevin bancroft?
- That's exactly who I mean.

537
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Watch. She's gonna
blame it on you now.

538
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,400
You threw me at him. You let him know it was
perfectly fine to take me to San Francisco.

539
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Only he took me to bed first,
and it's your fault.

540
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,500
Did I tell ya? I knew it.

541
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Wake up, Vic! She already
buried one husband.

542
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,500
Do you think I'm gonna let that get
in the record for everybody to see?

543
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,800
Or for the child to find out later on?

544
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,000
Then we'll just have
a no-fault divorce.

545
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,500
We don't get along.
It's certainly true enough.

546
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Nikki, I won't do it.
I've been thinking about this.

547
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,000
Dad?
Yeah?

548
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,500
This is cold, and the cheese
isn't hardly melted down.

549
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,500
We'll try to make this work.
Okay. Kvetch.

550
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,500
I've got a stake in this kid.

551
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,000
And I'm gonna stick around
to make sure he's okay.

552
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,500
- There you go.
- All you're interested in is the baby.

553
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,000
The baby's more important to you
than Caroline?

554
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,500
Right. My own flesh and blood.

555
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,500
You're such a fool.
That's right! I'm a fool.

556
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,500
Daddy, my woobie's ripped.

557
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,300
Ken, you know what?
Maybe it's time to get rid of the woobie.

558
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,600
- No, no, no!
- Okay, all right!

559
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,100
Gimme it. The dad'll help
if he wants that baby.

560
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,600
It's more than just pride, Nikki.

561
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,100
- There's too much easy marriage
and divorce. - Here you go. Good as new.

562
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Okay. I'd appreciate it if you
guys kept it down, okay?

563
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,600
Because, uh, Nikki's gonna get the
results of her blood test back today.

564
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,100
You'll have other children with
Caroline! That might happen...

565
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,100
Is it Kevin's baby?
Not sure.

566
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,100
Kevin's a skunk.

567
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,600
But Kevin gets all the girls.
He sure got Nikki.

568
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,600
My mother doesn't love my father,

569
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,100
but we've managed
to make a life together.

570
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,600
So you can just forget
about this annulment...

571
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,100
because I'm not gonna do it.
Yeah? Hi, Joan. How you doin'?

572
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,400
Uh, it's gotta be Kevin's.

573
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,600
Victor?
How can it be Victor?

574
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,100
No, he had a vasectomy.

575
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,900
It didn't take?
Are you kidding me?

576
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,100
Dad!
Hold on a minute!

577
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,500
Ken, give me that sword!

578
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,400
Okay, I've got 25-cent
wheaties. Rebate. Ooh.

579
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,100
I'm gonna raise you VanCamp's
pork and beans...

580
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,100
and ovaltine.

581
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:44,600
Well, I'm gonna see your
25-cent wheaties rebate...

582
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,500
and raise you two tender vittles
dollar offs, okay?

583
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,500
That's it for me.
I'll fold.

584
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,700
Jack, why are you dealing me
this garbage? I'm out.

585
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,700
This is so much more fun
than bridge, Jack.

586
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,600
Thanks so much for thinking
of it. Girls, girls.

587
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,200
Come on. Are you gonna play
cards or flap your gums?

588
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,000
Flap my gums!
It's gettin' ugly in here.

589
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,700
Hey. Come on.
All right. All right.

590
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,200
I will see you your tender vittles,
and I'll raise you a 50-cent yoplait...

591
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,700
and a two-dollar rebate
on a Domino's pizza...

592
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,200
and a two-for-one
sun pure frozen entree.

593
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
How about that?
Uh-oh. Ooh.

594
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,200
This is serious poker.

595
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Any of you ever tried those
sun pure frozen entrees?

596
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,300
Ugh. My dog wouldn't eat 'em.

597
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,100
I love them.
I do.

598
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,200
I'm calling you with a 25-cent
new and improved ban roll-on...

599
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,200
and two 50-cent triple-ply
hefty bag offers.

600
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,700
- What d'you got?
- She's bluffing.

601
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,700
Are these any good?

602
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,900
Uh, well...

603
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,400
You got two pair.
You got plenty.

604
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,700
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, mom!

605
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:11,700
Caroline.
Oh, hi. Pizza, huh?

606
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Oh, don't get up! Don't get up.
Geez. That late already?

607
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,600
We're just finishing.

608
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,700
Don't be silly.
Don't get up. Well, pizza.

609
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,700
I got a ton of work to do.
I'll go upstairs.

610
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,800
Listen, uh, we better go here.
Come on.

611
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,800
- 7:30?
- 7:30!

612
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,300
We'll play tomorrow.
Am I right?

613
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,200
Family starving? Take some
pizza home with you.

614
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,800
No. No, I don't need it.
Joan, don't forget your coupons.

615
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,300
Excuse me.
Joan, come on.

616
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,500
I think I'm in trouble.

617
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,200
Room service, madam.

618
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,800
Oh, thanks, but, uh, Ron gave
me this tuna presentation to do,

619
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,800
and I'm really way behind.

620
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,800
Well, you gotta eat something, honey.
If I wanted something to eat,

621
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,800
I would have come down and had something
to eat with you and your girlfriends.

622
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,800
Oh. All right.

623
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,300
Let's get into it.

624
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,300
Get into what, Jack?
Get into this.

625
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,300
The house is a mess, Jack. The kids
are a mess, Jack. You're a mess, Jack.

626
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,900
Did I leave anything else out?
Wanna talk about the beard?

627
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,900
All right. The beard's in its
transitional stage right now.

628
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,800
When it comes in,
it's gonna look great.

629
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,800
It's gonna look like that movie star,
uh, what's his name?

630
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,800
Orson Welles?

631
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,300
No. I'm...

632
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,300
Oh! Orson Welles.

633
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,800
Oh, I get it.
Fat jokes, right?

634
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
That's real funny. Yeah, I've
put on a couple of pounds.

635
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,800
So what? Come on.
What else do you have?

636
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,800
You wanna talk about this shirt
for a second, Jack? All right.

637
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,300
You've been wearing this shirt for about
two weeks now. It could walk by itself.

638
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,300
Why don't you retire that thing to
the dry cleaning hall of fame, huh?

639
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,000
It's a comfortable shirt! Jack, take a look
at yourself. You've thrown in the towel.

640
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,800
My brain is like oatmeal.

641
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,100
I yelled at Kenny today for
coloring outside the lines!

642
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,400
Megan and I are starting to
watch the same TV shows,

643
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
and I'm liking them.

644
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,300
I'm losin' it.

645
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,900
Honey, I know what you're talking about.
I've been there myself, all right?

646
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:23,400
If you were so unhappy why didn't you
say something? Because I wasn't unhappy!

647
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,100
Maybe I was a little confused.
Maybe I was a little frustrated.

648
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,900
But I knew what I was doing
was important,

649
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,800
because it means something
to raise decent human beings.

650
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,400
What saw me through was pride.
I had pride in this house, in my kids...

651
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,900
and in being Mrs. Jack Butler!

652
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,400
Where are you going?

653
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,200
I'm going downstairs and sleep on the
fat couch, if I can get through the door.

654
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Well, take pride in some
of that fat, porky!

655
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,900
Yes?

656
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,400
Victor, it's Nikki.

657
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,800
Yes, hello, Nikki.

658
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,400
Honey, are you okay?

659
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,900
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

660
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
Hello.

661
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,900
Joan. Hi. How are you?

662
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,900
No, forget it. Come on.
That was days ago.

663
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,900
No. No, it was very
insensitive of us.

664
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,400
Caroline had every right
to be angry.

665
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,900
We're not talking...
or doin' anything else.

666
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,400
I'll be right there.

667
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,500
I came as fast as i could.

668
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,000
You sure did.

669
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,000
You look great, Jack.

670
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,500
I do?
Mm-hmm.

671
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
What do you think of this shirt?

672
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Let me tell you about flannel.

673
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It gets me hot.

674
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,300
Joan, do I look fat or, uh,

675
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,500
overweight at all to you?

676
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,500
I like a man with a little meat
on his bones.

677
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That's two.

678
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:50,000
Okay, how about the beard?
I mean, uh, Caroline hates the beard.

679
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
I know.

680
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,200
Oh, my God.

681
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Jack!

682
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,300
Jack?

683
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,600
How could you?

684
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,800
And Joan? Why, Joan,
you're supposed to be my friend.

685
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,100
He's too much man to be
left alone, Caroline.

686
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,600
Really.

687
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,600
Honey! Please!
Come on.

688
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,100
It's just a... one kiss!

689
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,600
I'll bet.

690
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,600
Honey, what about the kids?
The kids are just outside.

691
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,600
I've thought of the kids.
The kids won't hear a thing.

692
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,500
Shoot me! Shoot me!

693
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,100
You're right. God knows
I'm guilty. I deserve it.

694
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,100
Tell me something, Jack.
What did it, huh? The boredom?

695
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:57,100
The repetition? The days,
one flowing into the next?

696
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:02,100
The loneliness? Well, I did it, Jack.
I did it for eight years.

697
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,600
Don't you think I know?
Say good-bye, darling.

698
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,600
What?
Aw, shit!

699
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,100
I loved this shirt!

700
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,600
God.

701
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Couldn't hold on, could ya, Jack?

702
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,600
I was comin' by to call you back.

703
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,700
Holy cow.

704
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,100
What'd you use, a. 38?

705
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,600
Uh,.38,.39, whatever it took.

706
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,800
Bye, darling.

707
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,800
- Tough luck, Jeff.
- Jack!

708
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,700
You bet.

709
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,200
Jack, Jack.
My name's Jack.

710
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,200
Jack. Jack.

711
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,700
I can't, Joan. I can't.
You can't do this to me.

712
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,100
Do what? It's time for our poker game.
The girls will be late.

713
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,700
Uh, there's no game today.
The game's called off.

714
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,700
Why?
'Cause there's a death in the family.

715
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,700
I'll explain it to you later.

716
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,900
Stay!

717
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,900
Get in there and clean
the kids' room.

718
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,400
Three, four. Yeah!

719
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,900
Let me take a break!
Two! Three! Four!

720
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,900
Hey!

721
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,900
Come on, pal.
Hey, south is drop off, north is pick up.

722
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,900
Let's get it straight next time, all right?
Come on, move it. Move it.

723
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,900
Let's go!

724
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,400
Let's go, monkeys!
I want all of you up! Let's go!

725
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,400
I want this area policed. I want the animals
fed. I want you to report for chow, 0700.

726
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,400
Move it, monkeys!
Move it! Let's go!

727
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,000
Dad?

728
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,500
# Gonna fly now #

729
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,500
Where's my baby?
Come on.

730
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,000
Today show.
Gene Shalit.

731
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,400
# Gonna fly now #

732
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,400
Let's go. We're running late.
Oh! Yeah, okay.

733
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,000
Thanks, honey. I'm moving now.
I'll be there in a minute.

734
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Good luck.

735
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:30,500
# Gonna fly now #

736
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,500
# Flying high now #

737
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:41,000
# Gonna fly #

738
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,100
# Fly so high #

739
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,500
Listen, ace.

740
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,000
You and I have to have
a man-to-man talk here...

741
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
about your woobie.

742
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Your woobie's looking bad, bud.
No.

743
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,000
Now, wait a minute.

744
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,000
Now, listen to me.
I understand...

745
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,500
that you little guys start
out with your woobies...

746
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,500
and you think they're great,
and they are... they are terrific.

747
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,500
But pretty soon,
a woobie isn't enough.

748
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,100
You're out on the street trying
to score an electric blanket...

749
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,500
or maybe a quilt,

750
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,000
and the next thing you know,
you're strung out on bedspreads, Ken.

751
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,100
That's serious.

752
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,400
Now, give me the woobie.

753
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,200
No.

754
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,000
Kenny, come on, man.

755
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,600
- No.
- Okay.

756
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,100
Give it to me for a couple of days.

757
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,000
If it doesn't work,
you got the woobie back.

758
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,700
Please?

759
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,100
You got a lot of guts.

760
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,100
Can I have...

761
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,600
a moment to myself, please?

762
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,600
Absolutely.
You got it.

763
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,100
You had to do it.

764
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Okay.

765
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,300
Ohh.

766
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,500
Tired, huh?

767
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,800
Oh. Yeah.

768
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,800
A little.
Excuse me.

769
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,300
Hmm?
How about this food?

770
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,800
Mmm.
Very good.

771
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,300
Mm-hmm. You sent out
for chinese food, huh?

772
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,300
No! Kenny made this.

773
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:47,800
Uh-uh. Listen, you're doing a really
great job with the kids, honey.

774
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,300
I appreciate it. And with everything.
You really are.

775
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,300
Yhanks. I'd love
to take this time...

776
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:57,300
to carry you upstairs,
and let you tell me all about it,

777
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,300
but I think that might
take too long.

778
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,800
Mmm.

779
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,800
Mmm.

780
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,600
How's it going in there, huh?

781
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,900
Like having your gums scraped.

782
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,400
You're on.
So soon?

783
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,900
It didn't take Humphries very long
to shoot down every idea we had.

784
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,400
Looks like you're the
ace in the hole, kid.

785
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,400
Well, I'm ready.

786
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,200
Okay, you've got
my attention. Shoot.

787
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,900
Well, these are the last two
campaigns for schooner tuna.

788
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,400
First you gave away four glasses
with every can of tuna.

789
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,900
Now, as I recall, you were stuck
with 60,000 of these, right?

790
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,700
What is this,
this is your life?

791
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,400
Now, bear with me.

792
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,400
Next came 100 free trips to Hawaii.

793
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Now, who knew there was going
to be a hurricane that month?

794
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,700
You're stuck with 100,000
of these flower leis.

795
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,600
I hope to hell you're making a point.

796
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,900
Well, I am making a point,
Mr. Humphries. the point is,

797
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,900
schooner tuna is one of the three
most expensive tunas on the market.

798
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,900
Now, if we want to beat our competitors,
the time for these gimmicks is over with.

799
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,400
Now, I don't mean to be
disrespectful, Mr. Humphries,

800
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,400
but housewives need your help,
not your gimmicks.

801
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,900
show them that you really care about their
problems, and you'll win their loyalty.

802
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,400
Now, this is what I propose.

803
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,200
"Schooner tuna sympathizes with those
hit so hard by this trying economy.

804
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,800
"To help you, we are reducing the
price of our tuna by 50 cents a can.

805
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:55,500
"When this crisis is over,
we'll go back to our regular prices.

806
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,900
"Until then, remember,
we're all in this together.

807
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Signed, Howard Humphries, president,
schooner tuna. The tuna with a heart. "

808
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,600
Well, you've got a plane to catch.

809
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,600
- I'm really sorry, Howard...
- Damn well right, you're sorry.

810
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,100
- Yes, I am. - Where in the hell have
you been hiding this little girl?

811
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,300
She's not just selling tuna,
son, she's selling America!

812
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,100
- Right! - The tuna with a heart!
I love this bleeding heart shit.

813
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,600
- That's... that's American,
that's what that is. - That's what I think!

814
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,100
- Well, there's more.
- More?

815
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,300
- There is?
- Yes.

816
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,600
Caroline, congratulations!

817
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,300
Thanks.
I am so impressed with you.

818
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,100
Hi. I'm here for Mrs. Butler.
8:00 flight.

819
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,600
Right. She'll be right out.
Okay.

820
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,600
Why do you have to
go to California?

821
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,600
'Cause that's where we're gonna
make the tuna commercial, honey.

822
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,100
Can't you go tomorrow, mommy?

823
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,100
No, I can't, because everyone else
is going tonight, and I have to go.

824
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,100
But you know what?
I'm gonna be back before you go...

825
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:29,400
to your first meeting of the knights
of the round table, I promise.

826
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:33,200
Bye, honey.

827
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,800
Bye, sweetie.
Aww.

828
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,700
Wait. guys, stay right here.
Alex, Kenny, watch her for a minute, okay?

829
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,200
Let me talk to you.

830
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,700
Two hours notice, and you're
off to Los Angeles like that.

831
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,200
Jack, there is nothing
I could do about it.

832
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,200
I convinced a man today to spend
$11 million on one of my ideas.

833
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,700
I gotta go! Besides, honey, there's
gonna be other halloweens, you know.

834
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,700
I know there'll be other halloweens,
but I'm thinking about this halloween.

835
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,200
Caroline, these kids, in a couple of years,
they're gonna outgrow this thing.

836
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,100
Oh, really? You don't seem
to have outgrown it, Jack.

837
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,700
All right, I admit it.
I like halloween.

838
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,000
Yeah, well, so do I, honey. Remember, I was
gonna dress up as a prison matron tonight?

839
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,900
The point is, Megan just cut two new teeth.
I'll bet you didn't know that.

840
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:28,000
Alex is playing football.
Remember Kenny's security blanket?

841
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
He doesn't have it anymore.
He doesn't use it. It's gone.

842
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,200
You know, if you were here,
I was gonna suggest you go as a ghost,

843
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,200
'cause even when you're here,
you're not here!

844
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,200
- We really have to get going.
- Hey, 'Madison Avenue', lighten up.

845
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,700
All right, Jack. What do you
want me to do? Not go?

846
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,100
Not try?
Not succeed?

847
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,700
Of course not!
I want you to succeed.

848
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,700
Hon...

849
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,000
you gave me some real
good advice once.

850
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,200
So now let me give you
some of mine.

851
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:04,100
It's real easy to forget
what's important. So don't.

852
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,300
Jack, I'm gonna be back in less than a week.
Can't we talk about this then?

853
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,800
Come on, everything's
gonna be all right.

854
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,800
Little woman's off again, huh?
Shut up, Annette.

855
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,800
Please, Megan. Please.
Daddy will buy you a T-bird.

856
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,800
Okay? You want a T-bird? please.
Put your bum down there, honey, okay?

857
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,300
I know, but j...

858
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:03,300
Ken, she here?
I think she's here now, dad.

859
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,800
Okay. Honey, please.
For daddy. Meg, please, okay?

860
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,700
Hi.

861
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,300
- Who are you?
- What?

862
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,900
Who are you?

863
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,600
I'm your baby-sitter.

864
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:24,300
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

865
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,300
Oh, Jack.
Hi.

866
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,300
How are you?
Hi, kids. Okay.

867
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:43,800
Huh? You remember uncle Jinx?
They're big now, huh?

868
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,300
Yeah. Listen.
What this is about, it's a...

869
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,400
it's a review board.
Now, it's just a formality. Oh.

870
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,900
They're gonna ask you
a couple of questions...

871
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,800
Jack, if you could back me up,

872
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,800
I think I can get you back on
at half salary.

873
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,500
What are you talking about? You didn't
say anything about half salary on the phone.

874
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,400
Yeah.

875
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,900
Mr. Latham, Mr. Butler,
you can go in now.

876
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,400
According to our records,
since you and your associates left,

877
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,900
production in your division
is off by 23 percent...

878
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,400
and costs are up 19 percent.

879
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,800
Do you have any explanation for that?

880
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,900
I'm a little confused here.
I'm no longer with the company.

881
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,400
I don't know.
You might ask Mr. Latham.

882
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,600
We have.

883
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,900
And?
I'm sorry, Jack.

884
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,400
I covered for you guys
as long as I could.

885
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,400
You covered for us?

886
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,400
Yeah.

887
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,900
That's a lie.
That's not true.

888
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,400
Come on, Jack.

889
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,900
Larry and Stan were in here. They already
admitted that I covered for them.

890
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:57,900
Now, come on! It's time for
you to be a stand-up guy.

891
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,400
Larry and Stan would say anything
you wanted them to say.

892
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,400
They need their jobs.

893
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,400
You want me to be a stand-up guy?
Okay, I'll be a stand-up guy.

894
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:16,200
I need my job too, but what's
going on here is wrong.

895
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,900
If I did such a bad job,

896
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:25,400
why did production go down and
costs go up after you fired me, huh?

897
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,200
Look, I don't know what
this guy told you.

898
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,900
I don't know what he does
with his books.

899
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:35,400
I'm a car maker. I make cars.
I'm not an accountant.

900
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,900
But i'll tell you something...
I take a lot of pride in my work.

901
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,400
Dad?

902
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,400
Uh, son, son... you're gonna have to
get out of here now. This is a meeting.

903
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,400
Just a minute, Alex.
Daddy's talking.

904
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,400
I know it's not real popular
right now, you know,

905
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,400
taking pride in your work, but I did.

906
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,000
I cared.
You fired me for it.

907
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,500
If you ever talk to my kid again like that,
I'm knocking you out.

908
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,900
Yea! Forget the paper.

909
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Yip, yip, hooray! There we go.
There we go. That's it.

910
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,000
Would you forget the pa...

911
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,500
Schooner tuna
commercial, take 24.

912
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,500
And action.

913
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,000
I'm Howard Humphries,
president of schooner tuna.

914
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,000
All of us here, uh...

915
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,500
Cut, cut.
Cut it.

916
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,500
Caroline? Caroline?
Telephone, Bill.

917
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,000
There's an emotional
element missing. I...

918
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,500
Oh, for God's sake, what does
he want now, Caroline?

919
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,500
Wait a second.
I'll take care of this.

920
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,100
What is it?

921
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,500
Can't you control him?

922
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,500
I want to say... I want to say,
"My fellow Americans. "

923
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,500
Gaffer tape, please?
Okay. Fine, fine.

924
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,500
Okay, folks. One more time.
Quiet, please!

925
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,500
Clear it.

926
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Caroline?
Mm-hmm.

927
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
How about a little dinner
after all this is over?

928
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,000
No, I don't think so.
I'm too tired. Just...

929
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
as soon as this is over, I want to go back
to the hotel and soak in a hot tub.

930
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,000
That's all I want to do.
That... yeah.

931
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,500
That sounds like a great idea.

932
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,100
- Quiet! - Schooner tuna
commercial, take 25.

933
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,100
My fellow Americans...

934
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,600
I actually thought I had a job there
for about 30 seconds today.

935
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,600
Hey, Jack, forget about it.

936
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,100
The most important thing is that
you didn't get fired.

937
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,000
That's right. That's a good
way to look at it, I guess.

938
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:55,600
Listen, you guys get in now and go,
and I'm gonna get a cab.

939
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,100
We sprang for dinner!
You can't walk out on us now!

940
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,600
Get in. 'Cause I don't...
Where are you taking me?

941
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,600
Come on.
Get in the car.

942
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,600
Got him!

943
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,100
Oh, my God!

944
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,100
These aren't the same guys from
the space shuttle, are they?

945
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,600
Hey, Flash!

946
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,100
Wow!

947
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:10,200
Don't look now, but I think
he's looking at you. No, he's...

948
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,700
Okay. Okay.

949
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,600
Remember, you don't know
where this has been.

950
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:24,700
Where's he putting it? No, don't tell me,
don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me.

951
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,100
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

952
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,700
Hey, wait, Flash!
Wait for me! Hey, Joan!

953
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:33,600
Hey, seriously, this...
Ohh.

954
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,700
We're going to jail.

955
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,700
Who cares?

956
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:50,700
All right, girls.
Next time I'll call you, all right?

957
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,700
Don't bother calling me.
Seriously, it was fun.

958
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,200
I'll see you.
Here, take this.

959
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,200
I don't think I'm gonna need it.
What is it?

960
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,700
It's that dancer's telephone number.

961
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,400
Good-bye!

962
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,200
Will all the passengers be sure...

963
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,200
to have their baggage checked
before boarding the buses.

964
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,000
Will Mrs. Turner...
Annette?

965
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,400
Mrs. Turner, please
come to the desk.

966
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,700
Will Mrs. Turner please
come to the desk.

967
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,700
So, that's why you offered
to sit with the kids.

968
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:22,400
You knew where they were
taking me, didn't you?

969
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,400
Daddy?

970
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,700
Hi. Come on, I'm taking
you guys to bed.

971
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,200
- Can we call mommy?
- No, we can't. She's in California.

972
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,200
I want to talk to mommy too.

973
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,700
Come on, guys. Go to bed.
We'll call her in the morning.

974
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,200
Well, it's only 8:30 in California.

975
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,000
Good point, Annette.
All right.

976
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,800
Okay, be very, very quiet.

977
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,800
Okay. Okay. Okay.

978
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,800
Right... right... right around
here would be fine.

979
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,800
Incidentally, I really appreciate
this very, very much.

980
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,300
Oh, I'm quite sure you do.

981
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,800
# Strangers in the night #

982
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,800
# Exchanging glances #

983
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,600
# Wandering in the night #

984
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,400
# What were the chances #

985
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,300
# We'd be sharing love #
Hello? Alex who?

986
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:48,800
I don't know.
Some guy.

987
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,900
Let me see.
Is Caroline Butler there?

988
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,800
She's in the tub.
Who is this?

989
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,300
This is her husband.
Who the hell is this?

990
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:15,800
- Who was that on my phone?
- Uh, wrong number.

991
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,100
Ron, what are you doing?

992
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:21,800
Well, somebody has got to
pour the champagne.

993
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,400
You've been drinking a lot,
haven't you, Ron?

994
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,400
Moi?
Yep. A lot.

995
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,900
I think i'm gonna have to
ask you to leave now, okay?

996
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,900
Why? There are no kids
to go home to tonight.

997
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,300
Ron, get out. We could make
a great team, Caroline.

998
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,900
Really? what the hell's that supposed
to mean? Well, basically,

999
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,800
you dump Jack, you marry me,

1000
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:45,300
and it's Richardson,
Frankel and Richardson.

1001
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,900
Come on. What are you trying to tell me,
that you're in love with me?

1002
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,800
Hell, no. But the client is.

1003
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:54,400
All right, Ron. This is my official
warning to you. Get out!

1004
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,400
You are so adorable
when you're angry.

1005
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,900
Ron, get out. Ron! I'm not kidding.
Oh, don't be coy with...

1006
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,900
Oh, trying to play hard to get, huh?

1007
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,400
Aren't you gonna answer that? That's
the fourth time it's rung in the last hour.

1008
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,400
- Oh, do you want me
to answer it? - Yeah!

1009
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,400
Oh, okay. Here we go. Hello?

1010
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,900
Okay?
Nobody there, I guess.

1011
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,900
Oh. Well, you probably
want to be alone, huh?

1012
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,400
Okay, good.
All righty.

1013
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,400
Well, you try to get some sleep
now, okay? And don't worry.

1014
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,400
My lips are sealed.
Bye.

1015
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,900
Won't be so bad when I
get your bangs rolled.

1016
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,700
Horrible.

1017
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,900
I don't think I'll be called upon
to defend my honor. I doubt it.

1018
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,900
I promised Jack I wouldn't
say anything.

1019
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,500
Now, remember, this is
in strictest confidence.

1020
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,000
Of course!

1021
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,500
Oh, good.
Another grown-up.

1022
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,500
What happened?

1023
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,000
Dad's making some minor changes.

1024
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,500
Hi, Joan.

1025
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,500
Just doing a little work
around the house. Kenny!

1026
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,300
Don't paint your sister!

1027
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:07,300
Hey, Butler!
Guess what?

1028
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,500
You had quite a burst of
nervous energy last night.

1029
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,500
Yeah.
You should have called me.

1030
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,800
Hey, Butler! Yeah?

1031
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,500
I think i found your problem.
What is it?

1032
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,000
This shoe.
Oh.

1033
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Kids.
Huh.

1034
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,500
Doris, this is a friend
of mine, Joan. TV.

1035
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,000
Hi.
Kitchen's clean.

1036
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:30,000
Hi, Joan. I'm gonna check
your basement for bugs.

1037
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I sure hope I don't find any.

1038
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Eww, i'm all grimy
and sweaty here.

1039
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,500
Joan, I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower.

1040
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,600
You can get a drink. You know
where we keep everything.

1041
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,100
Or watch television,
whatever you want.

1042
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,600
Oh, wow!

1043
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,100
Ooh.

1044
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:10,600
Hey, Jack! I love what you
did to the bedroom!

1045
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,100
Damn.

1046
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,600
Thanks. It's amazing what you
can do with a sears card.

1047
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:21,100
That's from their safari collection.

1048
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,600
You got a problem.

1049
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,100
Okay.

1050
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,100
All right.

1051
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:39,100
A: She's an attractive woman.

1052
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,100
B: She wants you, Jack.

1053
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,100
She wants you bad.

1054
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:51,600
C: I don't even want
to think about "C. "

1055
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,100
D:

1056
01:24:55,100 --> 01:25:00,100
Kenny'd talk.
Alex... Alex would be okay.

1057
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,900
Kenny'd talk.
He'd crack.

1058
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,600
M: I'm a free agent.

1059
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,600
N: I could be in the middle of it,

1060
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,600
I could have a heart attack, I could die.

1061
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:29,100
Caroline walks in, sees me there.
I die and get caught.

1062
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,600
- Joan?
- Caroline!

1063
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:36,200
- What are you doing
in my bedroom? - Huh?

1064
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,600
This is my bedroom, isn't it?

1065
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,700
- Yeah.
- Well, what are you doing here?

1066
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,200
Is it too early for a drink?

1067
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:52,700
All right.
Y:

1068
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:55,700
Why did I get rid of that woobie?

1069
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,200
Z: you're not gonna do anything,

1070
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,700
'cause you, my friend,
are in love with your wife.

1071
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,700
Joan? Caroline?
Jack.

1072
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,200
Well, now that we have the names straight,
would you mind explaining to me...

1073
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:16,200
why I come all the way home to talk to you,
and I find another woman in our room?

1074
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,200
Oh, look who's talking.
I called your hotel,

1075
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,700
Richardson answers the phone, and I hear
champagne chilling in the background?

1076
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,700
You heard that?
Aha!

1077
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,200
Now, I'd appreciate it if you just
don't talk to me right now,

1078
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,700
because I'm doing my best
to calm down, all right?

1079
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,200
Excuse me.
I have a household to run.

1080
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,000
Oh, Jack!

1081
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,200
Hello.
Oh, Jack.

1082
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,700
I... I'm in a lot of trouble.
Look, I'm not talking to you.

1083
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,700
No, no. Please.
Listen to me.

1084
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,700
Uh, I cut the department to the bone,
and they caught me.

1085
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I've gotta have you back.
I'll do anything.

1086
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,800
Dad, is mommy home?

1087
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,800
Not now, kid!
I'm talking here!

1088
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,400
I warned you, Jinx.

1089
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:03,200
- Ohh!
- Gee, one punch!

1090
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,200
You want a company car?

1091
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,300
One punch! One punch! Caroline?
Oh, I've caught you at a bad time.

1092
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,800
Hey, don't hit me, Jack. I like
what you've done with the place.

1093
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,300
Gotta get a new tube.
Ron!

1094
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,200
Caroline, I am begging you.

1095
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,800
Humphries is gonna pull the whole
account unless you come back to work.

1096
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,300
I told this guy last night
ten times that I quit.

1097
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:25,300
What'd he do, make a pass? I just got
a little out of hand, and she belted me.

1098
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,800
You quit your job?
I didn't like that job.

1099
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,300
I'm gonna get another job, a better one!
Anyway, I miss my family.

1100
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:33,300
I thought you loved that job.
Thanks.

1101
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,300
How about three days at the
office and two days at home?

1102
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:39,800
There's no way I can do that.
I need... Jack, will you listen to me?

1103
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:43,300
- Management wants you back!
- Jack!

1104
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:46,800
Thanks. Basement's clean.
Oh, thanks.

1105
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,800
Look, he's offering me full salary and
a company car. What do you think?

1106
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,800
Are you kidding?
Take it. Okay, look, Bert,

1107
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,800
tell him I don't make a move
without Larry and Stan.

1108
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,700
- He doesn't make a move without
Larry and Stan. - Oh, you got a deal.

1109
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,300
Who are Larry and Stan?
Thanks.

1110
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,300
You're a working woman. Can't you
understand? I'll tell you something else.

1111
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:04,800
You really hit him?

1112
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,300
Don't you think I know how
to take care of myself?

1113
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,300
Well...

1114
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:12,300
Hurt your hand?
No.

1115
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,800
Missed you.

1116
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,800
I missed you too.

1117
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:32,400
My fellow Americans, I am Howard Humphries,
president of schooner tuna.

1118
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,800
All of us here at schooner
tuna sympathize...

1119
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:38,400
with those of you hit so hard
by these trying economic times.

1120
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:43,400
In order to help you, we are reducing
the price of schooner tuna...

1121
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,300
by 50 cents a can.

1122
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,900
When this crisis is over,
we will go back to our regular prices.

1123
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:52,900
Until then, remember,
we're all in this together.

1124
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Schooner tuna.
The tuna with a heart.

1125
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:13,000
