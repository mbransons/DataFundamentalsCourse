1
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,372
-So you're going to Washington?
-Yes, ma'am.

2
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:47,037
My son is sick in a hospital there.

3
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:50,142
This will be an anxious Christmas for you.

4
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:53,975
l think this one will do. Let's try this.

5
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:58,120
-ls it your only son?
-No, ma'am.

6
00:03:58,257 --> 00:04:02,455
l had four, but two were killed
and one is a prisoner.

7
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:07,064
You've done a great deal
for your country, sir.

8
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:12,329
Not a mite more than l ought, ma'am.
l'd go myself if l was any use.

9
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:15,565
Thank you for the overcoat.

10
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,567
Wait a minute.

11
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,674
l hope you find him better.

12
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:24,941
Thank you, ma'am. God bless you.

13
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:29,587
Merry Christmas.

14
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:31,614
Merry Christmas.

15
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:37,984
Mrs. March,
will you sign this so l can get it off?

16
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:42,760
Why, what's the matter?

17
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:46,594
When l see things like that poor old man...

18
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,841
...it makes me ashamed
to think how little l do.

19
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:55,609
But, my dear, you're doing all you can here,
and your husband is there.

20
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,237
Yes, l know.

21
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:01,216
His last son is lying ill, miles away...

22
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:04,918
...waiting to say goodbye to him,
forever perhaps...

23
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:08,792
...while l have my four girls to comfort me.

24
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,896
And a real comfort they are, too,
aren't they?

25
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:14,896
l couldn't bear it without them.

26
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:18,668
-Meg and Jo are working, you know?
-Yes?

27
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:20,364
Meg is a nursery governess.

28
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,432
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

29
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:24,873
Merry Christmas.

30
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:29,045
Remember, Lily,
Santa Claus is watching you.

31
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:30,713
Come on, Tony.

32
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:35,884
''We know as well,
what are the baneful fruits of selfishness...

33
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:40,118
''...and self-indulgence.
Bad habits take root with fearful rapidity...

34
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,683
''...even in the richest natures.

35
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,520
''They grow...

36
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,660
''...and ripen and bear their fruit...

37
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,701
''...like southern vines and weeds...

38
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:54,131
''...almost...

39
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,965
''...in a single day and night.

40
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:04,313
''Crush them, pluck them out pitilessly
from their very first appearance...

41
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:07,444
''...and do not weary...

42
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,784
''...of the labor of plucking them out...

43
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:14,759
''...again and again.''

44
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:20,826
Goodbye, goodbye!

45
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:24,335
Hold your tongue,
you disrespectful old bird!

46
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:26,931
Go on, Josephine.

47
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:35,911
Josephine!

48
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:47,686
Where are you off to, Miss?

49
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,593
l didn't think you'd mind.

50
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:53,188
lt was nearly time to leave
and the girls said they'd be home early...

51
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,529
...so we could rehearse my play
for Christmas.

52
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,034
Never a thought about my Christmas.

53
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:02,506
Flying off without a word of cheer
or greeting for your poor old aunt.

54
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:04,303
l'm sorry, Aunt March.

55
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,372
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

56
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:10,206
Here.

57
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:19,749
lt's a dollar for each. Well, take them.

58
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:21,187
Thank you, Aunty.

59
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:25,161
Never mind thanking me.
Just spend it wisely, that's all l ask.

60
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:29,824
Although it's more than l can expect
when you're so much like your father...

61
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:34,568
...waltzing off to war and letting
other folks look after his family.

62
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:38,301
There's nobody looking after us.
And we don't ask favors from anybody.

63
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:41,904
l'm very proud of Father
and you should be, too.

64
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:45,683
-Don't you be impertinent, Miss.
-l'm sorry, Aunty.

65
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:49,679
lt isn't preachers that are going
to win this war. lt's fighters!

66
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:51,080
Yes, Aunty.

67
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:53,789
-Can l go, now?
-Yeah, go on.

68
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:56,191
-Did you clean Polly's cage today?
-Yes, Aunty.

69
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:59,560
Did you wash those teacups
and put them away carefully?

70
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:00,790
Yes, Aunty.

71
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,925
-You didn't break any?
-No, Aunty.

72
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:05,526
-What about the teaspoons?
-l polished them.

73
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:07,469
Yes. Very well then.

74
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,607
Wait, just a minute. Come back here.

75
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,580
Look at this. You haven't dusted properly.

76
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:21,982
l want this stair rail dusted and polished
before you leave here.

77
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:23,947
Yes, Aunty.

78
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,615
Higher.

79
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:15,436
Thank you very much, ladies.

80
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:17,941
And now l wish you all
a very merry Christmas.

81
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:19,701
Merry Christmas!

82
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,243
School is dismissed.

83
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:37,355
Amy March! You may close the door.

84
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:45,427
That'll teach her not to cut up didoes.

85
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:48,996
-lt serves that stuck-up Amy March right.
-What's he going to do to her?

86
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:54,338
l can see there's nothing for me to do
but to stop by and show your mother...

87
00:09:55,347 --> 00:10:00,717
...how instead of doing your sums,
you cover your slate with sketches.

88
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:06,553
And most uncomplimentary sketches.

89
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:15,032
Please, Mr. Davis, l'll never do it again, sir.

90
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:19,169
And she'd be so disappointed in me.

91
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:22,266
Please.

92
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:24,005
Please.

93
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,566
Well, l should hate to spoil her Christmas...

94
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:30,470
...and for that reason alone, young lady,
l shall overlook it.

95
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:32,380
Thank you, Mr. Davis!

96
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:34,383
You may go.

97
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:39,016
Thank you, Mr. Davis.
Thank you very much indeed.

98
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:40,716
Thank you, sir.

99
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,249
Here she is.

100
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:46,063
-What did he do?
-What did he say?

101
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:49,095
Come on, tell us. What happened?

102
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:53,395
l just said that if l ever told my mother
the way he treated me...

103
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:55,905
...she'd take me out of his old school.

104
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:58,469
She's never been ''reconciliated'' anyway...

105
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:02,570
...since my father lost his money
and she's had to suffer the ''degaridation''...

106
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:05,480
...of me being thrown in
with a lot of ill-mannered girls...

107
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,348
...who stick their noses
in refined people's business.

108
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:44,047
Little tiny pussy, l'll tell you a long story.

109
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:47,217
-Hannah, is it teatime?
-Yes.

110
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:49,617
-l'll set the table.
-Thank you, Beth.

111
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:53,528
lt'll be a help to me
'cause my bread's raised.

112
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:57,964
The girls are getting home early.

113
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:00,504
-Are they coming?
-Just passing the Laurence house.

114
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:08,034
-Christopher Columbus!
-Jo, don't use such dreadful expressions.

115
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,576
Here comes old Mr. Laurence.
What if he heard you?

116
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,777
l don't care. l like good strong words
that mean something.

117
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:16,616
Oh, bother.
Now we're going to have to speak to him.

118
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:19,646
How do?

119
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:24,261
lt makes my knees chatter
just to look at him.

120
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:29,365
l feel sorry for that poor boy, shut up alone
with such an ogre for a grandfather.

121
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:31,669
-Look, there he is.
-Where?

122
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:35,935
Don't point, Jo.
He'll think you're waving at him.

123
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,771
He's gone anyway. Well, what if he does?

124
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,509
Jo! Come along, Amy.

125
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:58,860
-How's my Beth?
-lt's cold outside!

126
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,296
Jo just did the most terrible thing.

127
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:02,924
Beth, come over here.

128
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:08,002
-He waved at us.
-ls tea ready yet?

129
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:11,471
Merry Christmas from Aunt March.

130
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:17,037
-For me?
-Yes, darling, for you.

131
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:18,340
We got one, too.

132
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,078
-What are you going to do with it, dear?
-l don't know.

133
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:23,882
Marmee said we ought not
to spend money for pleasure...

134
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:26,253
...when our men are suffering so
in the Army.

135
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:30,951
A dollar couldn't do the Army much good,
so l'm going to buy <i>Undine and Sintram</i>.

136
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,724
l've wanted it long enough.

137
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,596
l'm sure Marmee would approve
if l got some new gloves.

138
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:39,330
l've darned my old ones
until l can hardly get them on.

139
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:42,999
She always says a real lady is known
by her neat gloves and boots.

140
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:48,144
l shall get a nice box of Faber's
drawing pencils. l really need them.

141
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:52,777
Then l'd like to spend mine
for some new music...

142
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:55,919
...that is,
if you don't think Marmee would mind.

143
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:59,020
Let's each buy what we want
and have a little fun.

144
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:02,387
l'm sure we work hard enough.

145
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:06,656
l know l do.
lt's not the work l mind so much.

146
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,324
lt's having to tell Flo King
how pretty she looks...

147
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:12,699
...in things l know would look
as well on me.

148
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:16,568
What would you do if you were shut up
all day with an old crosspatch...

149
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,905
...who flies off the handle
every move you make?

150
00:14:18,977 --> 00:14:21,070
Jo, don't use slang.

151
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,844
Besides, don't forget
she gave us the dollar.

152
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:27,749
l'm sure neither of you suffer as l do.

153
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,054
You don't have to go
to that nasty old Davis' school...

154
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:35,286
...with impertinent girls who laugh at you
and ''label'' your father 'cause he isn't rich.

155
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,852
''Libel.'' Don't say ''label''
as if Papa were a pickle bottle.

156
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:43,225
l know what l mean
and you needn't be ''statirical'' about it.

157
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:46,934
lt's proper to use good words
and improve your ''vocabilary.''

158
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,131
Aren't we elegant?

159
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:51,402
You'd never be thought so with your slang.

160
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,535
l hope not. l don't want to be elegant.

161
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:56,239
-You needn't whistle like a boy.
-That's why l do it.

162
00:14:56,981 --> 00:15:00,974
-l detest rude, unladylike girls.
-And l hate affected, niminy-piminy chicks.

163
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,579
Birds in their little nests agree.

164
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,931
Really, you're both to blame.

165
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:20,968
You're old enough to leave off boyish tricks
and behave better, Josephine.

166
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,703
Now you are so tall and turn up your hair,
you must remember you're a young lady.

167
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:30,373
No, l'm not. And if turning up my hair
makes me so, l'll wear it down till l'm 100.

168
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:31,608
Jo!

169
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:36,909
As for you, Amy, your absurd words
are as bad as Jo's slang.

170
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:40,185
Your airs are funny now,
but you'll grow into an affected goose...

171
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:42,020
...unless you take care.

172
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:47,456
lf Jo is a tomboy and Amy's a goose,
what am l, please?

173
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,301
You're a dear and nothing else.

174
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:55,632
We're three ungrateful wretches
who don't deserve you.

175
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:59,807
Wait until l become a famous author
and make my fortune.

176
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:03,041
Then we'll all ride in fine carriages,
dressed like Flo King...

177
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:07,244
...snubbing Amy's friends and telling
Aunt March to go to the dickens.

178
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:08,376
Let's rehearse.

179
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,648
We'll start with the fainting scene.
You're as stiff as a poker in that, Amy.

180
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:17,126
Well, l can't help it.
l've never seen anyone faint...

181
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:21,188
...and l don't intend to make myself
black-and-blue tumbling as flat as you do.

182
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:23,461
lt's easy if you'll only watch me. Come on.

183
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:27,402
-lf l can drop gracefully, l'll....
-Now, when l come in...

184
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:31,565
...you'll see the horrible look in my eyes
and you shrink back trembling.

185
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,899
Go ahead.

186
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,043
Get into the mood, Amy.

187
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:45,249
Now, when l start toward you,
with wicked intentions....

188
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,358
Oh, Amy, you...

189
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:56,822
...draw back in horror,
covering your eyes with your hands.

190
00:16:57,702 --> 00:17:00,102
''Roderigo, Roderigo!

191
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,667
''Save me, save me! ''

192
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:12,375
There, now you see? Now, it's easy.

193
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:14,576
Now, here l come.

194
00:17:18,056 --> 00:17:20,422
''Roderigo, Roderigo!

195
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,487
''Save me, save me! ''

196
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,366
-You were marvelous.
-That was lovely.

197
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:45,639
Glad to find you so merry, my girls.

198
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,283
-Darling.
-Marmee.

199
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:50,051
-How is your cold, Meg?
-Much better.

200
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:52,851
Beth, dear, kiss me, baby.

201
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:56,421
Thank you, Jo. Thank you, dear.

202
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,257
-You look tired to death, Jo.
-No, Marmee, l'm not tired.

203
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,995
-Your slippers are all ready now.
-That's my Bethie, dearie.

204
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,765
Did you have a hard day, Marmee?

205
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,967
No, very pleasant, dear.
But it's good to be home.

206
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:13,976
-l have a treat for you.
-A letter from Father?

207
00:18:14,112 --> 00:18:16,307
Three cheers for Father.

208
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,481
''Give them all my dear love and a kiss.

209
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:26,986
''Tell them l know they will remember
all l said to them:

210
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,423
''That they will be loving children to you...

211
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:35,091
''...they will do their duty faithfully,
fight their bosom enemies bravely...

212
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,328
''...and conquer themselves so beautifully...

213
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:42,601
''...that when l come back to them,
l may be fonder and prouder than ever...

214
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:44,573
''...of my little women.''

215
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:51,378
l am a selfish girl...

216
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:57,517
...but l'll truly try to be better
and not waste my time in school...

217
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:01,851
...so that Father
may not be disappointed in me.

218
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:09,532
l'll try and be what he loves to call me,
''a little woman''...

219
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:14,899
...and not be rough and wild,
and do my duty here at home...

220
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:19,538
...instead of always wanting
to go to war to help Father.

221
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:24,646
l'm not going to be envious anymore,
if l can help it.

222
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:39,796
Now, we'll save the rest till after tea...

223
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:44,800
...for it's such a lovely long letter.
l know everybody must be hungry.

224
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,502
Let's get something for Marmee
with our dollar...

225
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,174
...instead of for ourselves, shall we?

226
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:01,115
That's like you, Beth. What shall we get?

227
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:04,949
-l'll get her a nice pair of gloves.
-New slippers, best to be had.

228
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:06,717
Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed.

229
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:11,657
A beautiful little bottle of cologne.
She'll like that, and it won't cost much...

230
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,664
...and then l'll have some left over
for my pencils.

231
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:19,667
l've finished with Asia.

232
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:21,204
And here is Europe.

233
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:25,006
-Three stitches and you can have Africa.
-Not too long stitches, dear.

234
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:27,374
lf you pass me the scissors,
l'll give you America.

235
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:29,709
There, you see? You did finish it after all.

236
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,078
You wanted to put it off until tomorrow.

237
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,017
But we never should have
if Jo hadn't made a game of it...

238
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:38,249
...and thought of talking
of the different countries as we worked.

239
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,789
lt was a nice idea, Jo.

240
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:44,553
Do you remember how you used to play
<i>Pilgrim 's Progress</i> when you were little?

241
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:49,526
l can see us all now with your ragbags
tied over our backs for burdens.

242
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,468
You have real burdens now,
instead of ragbags.

243
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:57,672
According to what l heard before tea,
except Beth.

244
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:00,436
She didn't say. Maybe she hasn't any.

245
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:02,105
Yes, l have.

246
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:07,845
Mine is dishes and dusters
and being afraid of people...

247
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,583
...and envying girls with nice pianos.

248
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:12,418
A piano is a burden.

249
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:01,505
Good night, my precious.

250
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:03,535
Good night, Marmee.

251
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:06,703
-Good night, Jo, my girl.
-Good night, Marmee.

252
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:09,905
-Good night, darling.
-Good night, my baby.

253
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,346
-Good night, Marmee.
-Good night, Bethie.

254
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,503
-Merry Christmas, Hannah.
-Merry Christmas!

255
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:41,737
Where's Marmee?

256
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:44,644
She just went down the street,
but she'll be right back.

257
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:48,617
She wants you to have your breakfast
when l can get it dished up.

258
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,619
Come round here.

259
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:52,452
Hide them. Get close.

260
00:22:59,497 --> 00:23:02,466
-Where have you been, Amy?
-What have you been doing?

261
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,191
Don't laugh, Jo.

262
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:07,863
l only changed the little bottle of cologne...

263
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:12,631
...for a big one.
l gave all my money to get it.

264
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,372
-Amy.
-Darling.

265
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,705
That was unselfish of you.

266
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,174
You're some pumpkins, Amy.

267
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:25,182
l felt ashamed, thinking only of myself.

268
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:27,687
Amy, my prettiest rose.

269
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:33,129
And l'm so glad,
because mine is the handsomest now.

270
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,267
-Where is Marmee?
-She'll be back any minute. Breakfast!

271
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:41,897
-Hannah, l'm so hungry.
-Hannah, what is it?

272
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,001
Sausages!

273
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:47,605
Popovers!

274
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:50,437
They are my favorites!

275
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:52,410
Coffee!

276
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,919
Oh, Hannah, you've beat the Dutch.

277
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:57,920
No need to make such a fuss about it.

278
00:23:57,988 --> 00:24:01,321
l remember when l used to serve it
on your father's table every day.

279
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:02,324
No?

280
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:06,424
-Hannah, were we really that rich?
-How was l dressed?

281
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:09,692
l'd like to tell Jenny Snow
all the pretty clothes l used to wear.

282
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,701
-l can tell her. Diapers!
-Jo!

283
00:24:12,236 --> 00:24:13,134
Two each.

284
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:16,037
-lsn't this marvelous?
-Look at all the popovers.

285
00:24:16,107 --> 00:24:17,165
She's coming!

286
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:19,504
Hurry, Beth, strike up.
Amy, open the door.

287
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:22,603
Come here, Meg. We'll cover these up
and it'll be a surprise.

288
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:28,982
Enter, Marmee.

289
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:44,434
-Merry Christmas, Marmee!
-Merry Christmas, my....

290
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:52,473
Oh, darling!

291
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:56,043
Oh, Meg, dear! Thank you!

292
00:24:56,781 --> 00:25:01,275
And handkerchiefs from Bethie. Thank you.

293
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:04,150
Hannah, did you see?

294
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:07,523
Amy, my precious, thank you!

295
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:09,653
These are from me.

296
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:12,219
Jo, my girl.

297
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:14,821
Thank you, darlings. Thank you.

298
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:17,433
Oh, my girls.

299
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:22,698
l can't tell you how happy l am.

300
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:30,576
Well, l can tell you how hungry l am.
Come on, everyone. Pass me those plates.

301
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:33,583
-Sit down, Marmee.
-Marmee, look! Sausages.

302
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:36,077
Wait a minute, girls.

303
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,348
l want to say one word before we begin.

304
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:43,691
l've just come from a poor woman
with a little newborn baby...

305
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:49,260
...and six children huddled into one bed
to keep from freezing, for they have no fire.

306
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:52,199
They are suffering cold and hunger.

307
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:57,770
My girls, will you give them your breakfast
as a Christmas present?

308
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:03,211
l'm so glad you came back
before we started.

309
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:05,078
l knew you would.

310
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:06,683
May l carry some things?

311
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,911
We shall all go. Take the coffee, Hannah.

312
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,250
-l'll get some firewood.
-l'll take the cream.

313
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:13,187
l'll take the bread.

314
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,558
l'll take the popovers.

315
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,824
Here we are, Mrs. Hummel.

316
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,806
<i>Gott in Himmel.</i> Good angels come to us.

317
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,769
Funny angels, in hoods and mittens.

318
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,812
Do you want some bread to eat?
Here, l'll give you some bread.

319
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:19,722
Strange that Roderigo is not here.

320
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:23,085
His note says ''promptly on the hour.''

321
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:28,094
''And why....''

322
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:31,601
And why Black Hugo's castle for the tryst?

323
00:27:33,637 --> 00:27:35,104
l am afraid.

324
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:37,330
Who comes here?

325
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:42,410
Your Highness, 'tis Mona the hag.

326
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,881
Black Hugo hath betrayed thee.

327
00:27:45,182 --> 00:27:46,547
l must fly.

328
00:27:52,156 --> 00:27:54,556
Zara will be waiting.

329
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,752
My proud beauty!

330
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,957
She will be mine!

331
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:06,135
Black Hugo approaches.

332
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:12,471
Withered crone, begone!

333
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:26,550
Roderigo, Roderigo!

334
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:30,086
Save me, save me!

335
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:41,296
And now to carry out my fell design.

336
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:49,173
What a fake.

337
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:52,443
Well, l told you
l wasn't going to make myself--

338
00:28:57,354 --> 00:29:00,619
Have pity. Oh, have pity!

339
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:03,984
Bring not upon me the worst of shame!

340
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:08,622
Silence, else you'll rue the day
you spurned Black Hugo's love.

341
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,428
Make thyself ready for the wedding.
l shall return within the quarter.

342
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:16,670
Ah, me!

343
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:20,467
Heaven protect the helpless!

344
00:29:23,313 --> 00:29:25,975
Zara ! My beloved!

345
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:30,179
Roderigo, durst l believe my eyes?

346
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:37,283
''The pale stars are twinkling

347
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:42,857
''The fair moon is rising above

348
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,200
''My guitar is tinkling

349
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:54,839
''But the notes are not sweet
Till they bring me my love''

350
00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:02,411
Courage, my fair.

351
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,412
The good padre waits
at yonder gate with the horses.

352
00:30:06,523 --> 00:30:09,185
See, the ladder. All is arranged.

353
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:14,586
Liberty! Fly with me.
Fly with me, my love.

354
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:17,498
l will assist you. l will....

355
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:25,575
lt's all right, everyone.
Stay where you are.

356
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,616
Young ladies.

357
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:43,226
Will you all please come in to supper?

358
00:30:57,841 --> 00:31:00,833
Christopher Columbus! What's this?

359
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:02,276
ls it fairies?

360
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,310
-lt's Santa Claus?
-Mother did it?

361
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:08,909
-Aunt March had a good fit and sent it?
-All wrong. Mr. Laurence sent it.

362
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:11,385
-No!
-Who is Mr. Laurence?

363
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,923
The Laurence boy's grandfather.
He lives next door.

364
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:16,255
He heard what you did
about your breakfast...

365
00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:17,884
...and sent me a nice note...

366
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:22,225
...saying he hoped l'd allow him to express
his friendly feeling toward my children...

367
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,063
...and send them a few trifles
in honor of the day.

368
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:30,905
The boy put it into his head, l know he did.

369
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:34,068
He looks like a capital fellow
and l'm dying to get acquainted.

370
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,805
l'm going to, too.

371
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,240
l wish Father were here.

372
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:41,650
l'm afraid he isn't having
such a merry Christmas as we are.

373
00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:15,949
Hello.

374
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:17,280
How do you do?

375
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:19,619
l wanted to thank you.

376
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,285
We did have such a good time
over your nice Christmas present.

377
00:32:24,061 --> 00:32:25,858
What's the matter? Are you sick?

378
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:29,296
Just a little cold, but grandfather's
made me stop indoors for a week.

379
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,890
That's too bad.

380
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:33,492
Can anybody come to see you?

381
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,998
lf they would.

382
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,939
Wait, l'll ask Marmee.
Close the window now.

383
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:58,022
-How do you do, Miss March?
-How do you do, Mr. Laurence?

384
00:32:58,262 --> 00:33:00,628
Mother was so sorry to hear
that you'd been ill.

385
00:33:00,697 --> 00:33:02,858
My sister, Meg,
sent you some of her blancmange.

386
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:06,061
lt's soft and will slide down easily
without hurting your throat.

387
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:06,999
Thank you.

388
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,130
And Beth lent you these until you're well.

389
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:18,841
l know boys don't like kittens,
but she was so anxious l couldn't refuse.

390
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:22,374
Maybe they'll help to liven things up.
lt's as dull as tombs over here.

391
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:26,322
Won't you come in?

392
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:29,253
No, l'm not to stay.

393
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:32,762
Please. Just for a few minutes.
l've ordered tea.

394
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:46,743
Christopher Columbus!

395
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:49,541
What richness!

396
00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:56,247
lt's just like summer!

397
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,788
This is marvelous!

398
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:00,888
lt's so roomy.

399
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:06,255
How many, please?

400
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,393
Two, please. Three.

401
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,657
How do you like it here after living
in Europe so long, Mr. Laurence?

402
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:13,930
l'm going to Europe.

403
00:34:14,004 --> 00:34:16,234
-Really? When?
-l don't know.

404
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:19,070
My aunt has rheumatism
and the doctor thought the baths....

405
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,872
Not that she hasn't a bath.
She has a very nice one.

406
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:24,038
Did you take any baths
while you were there?

407
00:34:24,114 --> 00:34:27,515
-l mean, for rheumatism.
-No, l'm not troubled with rheumatism.

408
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:30,747
Neither am l. But she thought
that baths wouldn't do me any harm.

409
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:33,289
l mean, that is to say, while l was there.

410
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:36,019
You see,
l've always wanted to go to Europe.

411
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:38,653
Not for the baths, of course,
but for my writing.

412
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:41,755
You see, my aunt....
But you don't know Aunt March, do you?

413
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:44,528
Well, never mind.
What were you saying, Mr. Laurence?

414
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,936
l'm not Mr. Laurence. l'm only Laurie.

415
00:34:49,473 --> 00:34:50,701
Laurie.

416
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:53,735
How do you like it here after Europe?

417
00:34:53,944 --> 00:34:56,742
lt's strange
after living in schools all my life...

418
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:59,646
...but it will be all right
when l get used to Grandfather.

419
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:01,081
You know, he....

420
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:04,913
Yes, you should have seen him
before you came.

421
00:35:04,988 --> 00:35:08,617
-lsn't he a holy terror?
-You ought to see Aunt March.

422
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:15,523
lt's too pretty to eat.
l wish we had things like this over here.

423
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:17,328
And l wish....

424
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:19,963
lt is nice, isn't it?

425
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:23,165
My little sister put on the geranium leaves.
She's very artistic.

426
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,970
-Amy?
-Yes. How do you know?

427
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:29,977
l often hear you calling to one another...

428
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:33,210
...and when l'm alone over here....

429
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:37,980
l beg your pardon for being so rude...

430
00:35:38,922 --> 00:35:41,982
...but sometimes you forget
to put down the curtains...

431
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,425
...and when the lamps are lighted,
it's like looking at a picture...

432
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,465
...to see you all around the table
with your mother.

433
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,967
You always seem to be having
such good times.

434
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:56,003
We'll never draw that curtain anymore.

435
00:35:56,773 --> 00:35:59,901
And l give you leave
to look as much as you like.

436
00:35:59,976 --> 00:36:02,911
l wish instead of just peeping,
you'd come over and see us.

437
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,045
We'd have jolly times together.

438
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:08,983
Would you let me be in a play?
l saw some of it the other night.

439
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:10,651
That was terrible.

440
00:36:10,787 --> 00:36:13,221
l want to put on <i>Hamlet</i>
and do the fencing scene.

441
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,191
l could play Laertes.
l took fencing lessons at the academy.

442
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:17,453
-Really?
-Yes, look.

443
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:20,393
Look. <i>En garde!</i>

444
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:23,430
-Splendid!
-Here.

445
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:26,866
''Come, for the third, Laertes,
you but dally.''

446
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,598
''Say you so? Come on.''

447
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:34,840
-''Another hit; what say you?''
-''A touch, a touch, l do confess.''

448
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:40,606
What is this? What on earth?

449
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,081
What's going on?

450
00:36:42,552 --> 00:36:43,883
l don't know, sir.

451
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:47,721
''Have at you now! ''

452
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:49,814
l say....

453
00:36:50,193 --> 00:36:52,354
-Are you hurt?
-No.

454
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:55,389
-No, nothing ever hurts me.
-l'm sorry.

455
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:58,525
l forgot you were a girl
and l'm afraid l got a bit too rough.

456
00:36:58,602 --> 00:37:02,732
What are you talking about?
l had you bettered if l hadn't slipped.

457
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:08,140
That's a good picture of your grandfather.

458
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:11,977
He looks pretty grim,
but l shouldn't be afraid of him.

459
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:15,442
Though l can see how his face
might frighten some people.

460
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:21,190
l'll wait upstairs, sir.

461
00:37:23,126 --> 00:37:27,756
His eyes are kind and l like him
even though he does bark at you so.

462
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,125
Thank you, ma'am.

463
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,769
So you're not afraid of me?

464
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:38,339
No, sir, not much.

465
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:41,104
But my face will frighten some people?

466
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:46,605
-l only said ''might.''
-And l bark, do l?

467
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,941
No, sir, perhaps not all the time.

468
00:37:50,554 --> 00:37:52,613
But with all that, you like me?

469
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,919
Yes, sir. l do.

470
00:37:55,225 --> 00:37:56,749
l do.

471
00:37:58,094 --> 00:37:59,618
And l like you.

472
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:08,264
Grandfather, you should see her fence.
Come on, let's show him.

473
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:11,432
-No. l've been here too long now.
-l'll see you home.

474
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:16,409
No, you stay indoors, young man.
l shall see Miss March home.

475
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:19,174
l want to pay my respects
to your mother...

476
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:21,717
...and thank her for the medicine
she sent my boy.

477
00:38:21,785 --> 00:38:23,878
l can see it's done him lots of good.

478
00:38:27,257 --> 00:38:30,590
You get upstairs and do your sums.
Brooke is waiting for you.

479
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,595
And see that you behave yourself
like a gentleman, sir.

480
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:35,062
Goodbye, Jo.

481
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:40,800
Here they come.

482
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,362
All dressed up
and looking as pretty as pictures.

483
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:49,272
Amy, how dainty. You look lovely.

484
00:38:52,282 --> 00:38:55,979
l wish Laurie hadn't asked me to his party.
l know l shall be frightened.

485
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:59,488
You wouldn't want to hurt his feelings
when he's been so kind.

486
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:03,350
Meg, the dress is lovely.

487
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,588
Thank you, Marmee.

488
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,288
Jo, you look splendid.

489
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:11,698
l feel perfectly miserable with 19 hairpins...

490
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:15,795
...all sticking straight into my head,
but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.

491
00:39:15,872 --> 00:39:17,339
Does the patch show much?

492
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:18,931
lt does a little, Marmee.

493
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:22,775
But she's going to sit down or else stand
with her back against the wall.

494
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:24,711
Jo, where are your gloves?

495
00:39:25,415 --> 00:39:27,883
l've stained them, so l'm going without.

496
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,782
You wear gloves or l don't go.

497
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:32,583
l tried to clean them,
but it only made them look worse.

498
00:39:32,656 --> 00:39:35,557
l'll carry them
and hold them crumpled up in one hand.

499
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,616
-Nobody will see them.
-Jo!

500
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:41,424
l'll tell you.
We'll each wear one of your nice ones...

501
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:45,662
...and carry one of my bad ones,
then the effect will be fine and easy.

502
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:49,933
All right, only be careful of it,
and don't stretch it.

503
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:55,009
And, Jo, dear, do behave nicely
and don't put your hands behind your back.

504
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:56,707
Good night, Marmee.

505
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,374
Above everything, don't say:
''Christopher Columbus! ''...

506
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:00,882
...and disgrace us all.

507
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,009
Hold your tongue, Miss Baby.

508
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:07,318
l'll be as prim as l can be and not get into
any scrapes, if l can help it.

509
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:59,307
May l engage you for this dance,
Miss March?

510
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,469
No, thank you, l'm not dancing.

511
00:41:13,423 --> 00:41:15,914
-There's that Kitty Ford.
-Where?

512
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:18,085
There in the pink dress and blue sash.

513
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:22,461
l don't see why she's allowed with
the grownups and l have to stay up here.

514
00:41:22,532 --> 00:41:24,625
That beautiful piano.

515
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,632
lt's as big as our kitchen.

516
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:34,802
What's this? Why aren't you young ladies
downstairs dancing?

517
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:37,438
Mother said we weren't to go down
with the grownups.

518
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:40,347
But can you see anything from here?
How about you?

519
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,481
She just likes to listen to the music.

520
00:41:43,553 --> 00:41:46,021
You just come down with me
where it's playing.

521
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:50,082
-No, sir, please. l....
-Why not? What's the matter?

522
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:53,596
She has an infirmity.

523
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:55,956
She's shy.

524
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:58,427
l see.

525
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:01,295
lf it weren't for that,
she'd be simply ''fastidious''...

526
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:03,464
...because she plays beautifully.

527
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,233
She must come and play for me sometime.

528
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:08,038
No, she never would.

529
00:42:08,845 --> 00:42:11,336
lt wasn't that l wanted to hear her.

530
00:42:11,414 --> 00:42:15,214
But that piano down there
is simply going to ruin for want of use.

531
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:18,684
l was hoping one of you young ladies
would come and practice on it...

532
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:20,985
...just to keep it in tune.

533
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:25,156
-But if you don't care to come, never mind.
-Sir.

534
00:42:25,528 --> 00:42:28,463
We do care. Very, very much.

535
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:32,359
So you're the musical one.

536
00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:35,799
l'm Beth. l love it dearly...

537
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,868
...and l'll come if you're quite sure
nobody will hear me and be disturbed.

538
00:42:39,943 --> 00:42:42,343
Not a soul, my child. Not a soul.

539
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:46,973
You come, too, young lady...

540
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:51,009
...and tell your mother l think
all her daughters are simply ''fastidious.''

541
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:57,156
Beth, isn't he elegant?

542
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:07,598
This is the German, and l'll be hanged
if l'll let you refuse me all of them.

543
00:43:08,705 --> 00:43:10,104
Don't you like to dance?

544
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:13,540
Yes, l love to dance, but l can't.

545
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,906
-l mean, l promised l wouldn't.
-Why?

546
00:43:17,714 --> 00:43:21,275
-l may as well tell you. You won't tell?
-Silence to the death.

547
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:24,477
You see, l have a bad trick
of standing in front of the fire...

548
00:43:24,554 --> 00:43:27,455
...and l scorched my frock
and l burned this one.

549
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:28,850
Where?

550
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:34,353
You can laugh if you want to. lt is funny.

551
00:43:36,065 --> 00:43:37,794
l'll tell you how we'll manage.

552
00:43:37,901 --> 00:43:41,860
There's no one in the hall.
We could dance there without being seen.

553
00:43:48,011 --> 00:43:51,378
-You're a trump.
-And l think you're just perfectly splendid.

554
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:13,901
Hello.

555
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,438
What are you doing up there?
Come on down.

556
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,137
No, they can't.

557
00:44:20,877 --> 00:44:22,344
Have you had refreshments?

558
00:44:22,812 --> 00:44:25,781
No, thank you, we really don't care for--

559
00:44:28,284 --> 00:44:30,343
We'll bring some right up. Come on.

560
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,351
Then when Laurie goes to college,
what becomes of you?

561
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:38,015
l shall turn soldier as soon as he is off.
l am needed.

562
00:44:39,963 --> 00:44:41,521
l'm so sorry.

563
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,560
l mean, l'm so sorry
for all the mothers and sisters...

564
00:44:48,638 --> 00:44:50,538
...who have to stay home and worry.

565
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:54,407
l have neither and very few friends
to care whether l live or die.

566
00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:58,512
Laurie and his grandfather
would care a great deal.

567
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:03,245
And we all would be very sorry
if any harm came to you.

568
00:45:05,321 --> 00:45:06,379
Would you?

569
00:45:06,756 --> 00:45:07,984
Here we come.

570
00:45:10,893 --> 00:45:11,882
Jo!

571
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,463
Now you've done it!

572
00:45:22,772 --> 00:45:25,366
-Look at me.
-lt's a shame.

573
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,033
What a blunderbuss l am.

574
00:45:27,243 --> 00:45:28,676
What are you going to do?

575
00:45:29,212 --> 00:45:30,804
l'll ask Marmee.

576
00:45:35,118 --> 00:45:38,986
Have you two been hiding? l've been
looking all over the house for you.

577
00:45:39,055 --> 00:45:40,454
Hannah's here.

578
00:45:40,623 --> 00:45:43,490
-ls it that late?
-Time slips away.

579
00:45:45,294 --> 00:45:48,229
-Good night, Mr. Brooke.
-Good night, Miss Margaret.

580
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:55,860
Miss Margaret?

581
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,808
-Goodbye. l'm glad you came.
-We had an elegant time.

582
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:08,214
Good night, Amy.

583
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:11,720
Good night.

584
00:46:11,888 --> 00:46:14,288
-Good night, Laurie.
-Good night, Miss Margaret.

585
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:15,483
Laurie!

586
00:46:16,092 --> 00:46:17,389
Good night, everybody.

587
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,894
-Don't forget your ice skates tomorrow.
-l won't.

588
00:46:19,962 --> 00:46:21,862
-Good night.
-Good night.

589
00:46:33,042 --> 00:46:35,169
There, l've done my best.

590
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:38,677
lf that won't do,
l'll have to wait until l can do better.

591
00:47:21,224 --> 00:47:23,192
Why, what are you up to?

592
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:31,097
lt's a pair of slippers
l worked for Mr. Laurence.

593
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:34,692
He's been so kind about letting me play
on his beautiful piano.

594
00:47:34,804 --> 00:47:37,534
l didn't know any other way
to thank him, Jo.

595
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:40,232
-Do you think they're all right?
-They're beautiful.

596
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:44,075
And l think you're sweet.
Hey, isn't that Amy's hair ribbon?

597
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,681
Yes, but l think
she was going to throw it away.

598
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,308
You think?

599
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,247
You'd better vamoose
before she catches you.

600
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:15,637
Now l'll find out why you come
to this hole every day.

601
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:18,236
ls that why you never have
any time for me anymore?

602
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:22,216
Laurie Laurence, give that to me
or l'll never speak to you again!

603
00:48:22,552 --> 00:48:24,315
All right, take it.

604
00:48:28,324 --> 00:48:29,655
You're a fine one.

605
00:48:29,725 --> 00:48:32,489
l thought we weren't to have any secrets
from each other.

606
00:48:32,562 --> 00:48:35,963
Well, this is altogether different.
l beg your pardon.

607
00:48:36,032 --> 00:48:40,526
Of course, it's different. Just like a girl.
Can't keep an agreement.

608
00:48:40,736 --> 00:48:42,067
Oh, bilge!

609
00:48:45,274 --> 00:48:46,901
You'll be sorry.

610
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,402
l was going to tell you
something very plummy.

611
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,677
A secret.

612
00:48:53,115 --> 00:48:55,879
All about people you know, and such fun.

613
00:48:55,952 --> 00:48:58,250
-What?
-lf l tell you, you must tell me yours.

614
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:00,380
-You won't say anything at home?
-Not a word.

615
00:49:00,456 --> 00:49:04,222
-You won't tease me about it in private?
-l never tease. Fire away.

616
00:49:19,508 --> 00:49:22,033
l sold my story to the Spread Eagle.

617
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:24,442
Hurrah for Miss March.

618
00:49:24,847 --> 00:49:29,682
Hurrah for Miss March!
The celebrated American authoress!

619
00:49:29,752 --> 00:49:32,050
l didn't want anyone to know until it's out.

620
00:49:32,121 --> 00:49:34,919
-Won't it be fun to see it in print?
-Now, what's yours?

621
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:38,256
-l know where Meg's glove is.
-ls that all?

622
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:40,352
-Wait till you hear where it is.
-Where?

623
00:49:42,365 --> 00:49:43,957
-How do you know?
-l saw it.

624
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:45,500
-Where?
-Pocket.

625
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:47,501
-All this time?
-lsn't it romantic?

626
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:49,995
''Romantic''? Rubbish!

627
00:49:50,806 --> 00:49:54,401
l never heard of anything so horrid.
l wish you hadn't told me.

628
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,910
Of all the sickly sentimental....

629
00:49:57,346 --> 00:50:00,611
Why do things always have to change
just when they're perfect?

630
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:04,284
Meg always used to tell me everything.
Now she keeps things to herself.

631
00:50:04,353 --> 00:50:07,652
She thinks brown eyes are beautiful
and John is a lovely name.

632
00:50:07,823 --> 00:50:11,122
He'd better keep away from me
or l'll tell him what l think of him...

633
00:50:11,193 --> 00:50:14,390
...trying to break up other people's
happiness and spoil their fun.

634
00:50:14,463 --> 00:50:17,023
lt doesn't spoil any fun.
lt makes it twice as good.

635
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:19,791
You'll find out
when someone falls in love with you.

636
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:21,803
Soft summer day.

637
00:50:22,638 --> 00:50:24,663
Sun setting through the trees.

638
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,666
Your lover's arms stealing around you.

639
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:31,470
-l'd like to see anybody try it.
-Would you?

640
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:52,223
l'll get you!

641
00:50:55,271 --> 00:50:56,738
Now l've got you.

642
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,238
Wait!

643
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:03,073
Look out, look out! Let me in, let me in!

644
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:07,037
-Hey, look out, Laurie. Don't act like that.
-l'm sorry, Meg.

645
00:51:08,217 --> 00:51:11,778
l'd have beaten her though
if l hadn't tripped and fell.

646
00:51:12,855 --> 00:51:14,550
You should have seen....

647
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:19,189
-lt's been a most enjoyable afternoon.
-Thank you.

648
00:51:19,261 --> 00:51:21,889
Paying visits has never been
quite so much fun before.

649
00:51:21,964 --> 00:51:24,296
l hope we may do it again very soon.

650
00:51:28,404 --> 00:51:30,838
Goodbye, Mr. Brooke. Come along, Meg.

651
00:51:31,107 --> 00:51:33,667
-Good afternoon, Mr. Brooke.
-Goodbye, Miss Margaret.

652
00:51:33,743 --> 00:51:35,836
-Good afternoon, Laurie.
-Goodbye, Jo.

653
00:51:35,911 --> 00:51:38,641
-Coming, Laurie?
-All right. See you tomorrow, Jo.

654
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:42,780
l've never been so embarrassed in my life.

655
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:45,446
When will you stop
your childish romping ways?

656
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:48,957
Not until l'm old and stiff,
and have to use a crutch.

657
00:52:03,072 --> 00:52:04,096
Jo!

658
00:52:05,775 --> 00:52:08,471
-Hello, Bethie.
-Hello, Jo.

659
00:52:08,978 --> 00:52:10,309
How's my girl?

660
00:52:14,917 --> 00:52:16,350
There's a surprise.

661
00:52:16,585 --> 00:52:18,815
-Come on and hurry up.
-Come on, Jo.

662
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:22,482
What is it?

663
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,322
Stop yelling. What is it?

664
00:52:25,394 --> 00:52:27,191
Christopher Columbus!

665
00:52:40,276 --> 00:52:41,265
For me?

666
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,104
lsn't it the most beautiful piano
you've ever seen?

667
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,613
Look, this came with it.

668
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:48,514
-Quick, read it. See what he says.
-l'll read it.

669
00:52:49,285 --> 00:52:52,482
''To Miss Elizabeth March. Dear Madam.''

670
00:52:52,721 --> 00:52:53,915
How elegant.

671
00:52:54,557 --> 00:52:59,790
''l've had many pairs of slippers in my life,
but none that suited me as well as yours.

672
00:53:00,963 --> 00:53:06,265
''l like to pay my debts, so l know
you will allow me to send you something...

673
00:53:06,402 --> 00:53:09,633
''...that belonged
to the little granddaughter l lost.

674
00:53:10,439 --> 00:53:12,907
''With hearty thanks and best wishes...

675
00:53:13,008 --> 00:53:18,378
''...l remain your grateful friend
and humble servant, James Laurence.''

676
00:53:18,848 --> 00:53:20,008
Oh, Bethie!

677
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:24,079
-lsn't he a really sweet old man?
-Look at these lovely brackets.

678
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:27,812
Look, it opens!

679
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,457
-You'll have to thank him.
-Yes.

680
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:34,289
l'll go right now.

681
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:41,359
Well, l wish l may die!
She'd never have gone in her right mind.

682
00:53:52,348 --> 00:53:53,337
Come in.

683
00:54:05,928 --> 00:54:08,123
l came to thank you, sir.

684
00:54:23,879 --> 00:54:27,576
''But when the piece began, the dogs,
the dames and private ends went mad...

685
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:28,810
''...and bit the man.

686
00:54:28,884 --> 00:54:32,149
''Around from the neighboring streets
the wondering neighbors ran...

687
00:54:32,221 --> 00:54:35,054
''...and swore the dog'd lost his wits
to bite so good a man.

688
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:37,888
''The wound seemed sore and sad
to every Christian eye...

689
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,928
''...and while they swore
the dog was mad--''

690
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:41,394
Look, Marmee.

691
00:54:43,399 --> 00:54:44,388
Ms. March!

692
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:48,530
Ms. March. lt's one of them
telegraph things, ma'am.

693
00:54:55,978 --> 00:54:57,411
lt's Father.

694
00:54:58,581 --> 00:55:02,608
He's in the hospital.
l must go to Washington at once.

695
00:55:04,086 --> 00:55:06,316
Put those in the corner, dear.

696
00:55:07,022 --> 00:55:09,183
What on earth is keeping Jo?

697
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:11,583
This is all packed, Marmee.

698
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,925
-l don't believe l've forgotten a thing.
-Thank you, dear.

699
00:55:14,997 --> 00:55:17,329
While l'm away, don't forget the Hummel's.

700
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:19,594
-We won't.
-We'll do our best, Marmee.

701
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:23,034
Here we are. Here's some excellent port
for your husband.

702
00:55:23,105 --> 00:55:26,768
-Thank you. How generous.
-l hope you find this dressing gown useful.

703
00:55:26,842 --> 00:55:29,709
Everything's arranged
and Brooke will go with you.

704
00:55:30,613 --> 00:55:32,205
There's no need. l'll be fine.

705
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:35,148
He's all prepared.
He has commissions for me in Washington.

706
00:55:35,217 --> 00:55:39,210
-He'll be of help to you on the journey.
-How thoughtful of you.

707
00:55:42,191 --> 00:55:46,218
lt's such a relief to know that Marmee
will have someone to take care of her.

708
00:55:46,295 --> 00:55:48,388
Thank you, very, very much.

709
00:55:48,664 --> 00:55:49,892
Not at all, Miss Margaret.

710
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:53,799
My kind friend, l can't thank you....

711
00:55:57,673 --> 00:56:00,437
Laurie's outside with the carriage.
We'll wait for you.

712
00:56:00,509 --> 00:56:01,908
The train leaves in an hour.

713
00:56:01,977 --> 00:56:03,911
Here, ma'am, you'll need this.

714
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,707
-l couldn't.
-Please, Marmee, take it.

715
00:56:07,483 --> 00:56:09,178
Where is Jo?

716
00:56:15,124 --> 00:56:17,718
-Jo, what kept you?
-Jo, whatever took you so long?

717
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:20,193
Here's the money from Aunt March.

718
00:56:22,131 --> 00:56:25,294
And there's my contribution.

719
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:31,232
$25. Where did you get it?

720
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:34,437
-My dear!
-lt's mine, honestly.

721
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,774
l only sold what belonged to me.

722
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:41,642
Your hair!

723
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:43,511
Jo, you shouldn't have done it.

724
00:56:43,652 --> 00:56:47,611
Aunt March croaked, as she always does,
when asked for nine pence.

725
00:56:47,856 --> 00:56:51,587
Marmee, she only sent you
just money enough for the ticket.

726
00:56:51,727 --> 00:56:53,422
l knew you would need more...

727
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:56,225
...so l happened to be going past
a barber shop...

728
00:56:56,298 --> 00:56:59,028
...and l saw some tails of hair
hanging in the window...

729
00:56:59,101 --> 00:57:01,501
...with the prices marked on them...

730
00:57:02,104 --> 00:57:05,767
...and l thought it would do my brain good
to have my mop cut off.

731
00:57:05,841 --> 00:57:07,832
And so l did.

732
00:57:10,379 --> 00:57:11,505
Thank you, dearie.

733
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:14,639
Are you ready, Marmee?
We'll have to hurry to catch....

734
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,184
Christopher Columbus!

735
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:22,013
Well, it's boyish, becoming,
and easy to keep in order.

736
00:57:22,257 --> 00:57:24,919
-Marmee, you'll miss your train.
-Yes, Marmee, come on.

737
00:57:24,993 --> 00:57:28,724
-Now, girls, go on with your work as usual.
-We will, Marmee.

738
00:57:32,835 --> 00:57:34,928
Can't we go to the train with you,
Marmee?

739
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:38,996
No, l want you all to stay here
and comfort each other.

740
00:57:40,576 --> 00:57:44,034
Meg, dear, watch over your sisters.

741
00:57:45,414 --> 00:57:46,847
Be patient, Jo.

742
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:50,441
Jo, don't do anything rash.

743
00:57:50,753 --> 00:57:53,722
Beth, dear, help all you can.

744
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:59,819
Amy, be obedient.

745
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,827
No, l want you to stay here.

746
00:58:05,868 --> 00:58:10,567
l want to carry away a picture in my mind
of my brave little women to take to Father.

747
00:58:11,006 --> 00:58:13,941
-Goodbye, my darlings.
-Goodbye, Marmee.

748
00:58:18,013 --> 00:58:20,982
God bless us and keep us all.

749
00:58:47,376 --> 00:58:49,071
Jo, are you awake?

750
00:58:53,715 --> 00:58:56,479
Jo, you're crying.

751
00:58:57,986 --> 00:58:59,578
No, l'm not.

752
00:59:01,657 --> 00:59:03,022
Don't cry, dear.

753
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:07,686
Father will be all right
and Mr. Brooke will take care of Marmee.

754
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:11,991
l'm not crying because of that.

755
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:13,931
What then?

756
00:59:15,437 --> 00:59:17,302
My hair.

757
00:59:23,879 --> 00:59:27,940
''Yet 'tis whispered that when the gondolas
glide through those fatal waters...

758
00:59:28,016 --> 00:59:32,419
''...they still run crimson with the blood
of Lady Viella and her gallant lover...

759
00:59:33,121 --> 00:59:35,715
''...slain by the phantom hand.

760
00:59:37,426 --> 00:59:38,688
''The End.''

761
00:59:39,328 --> 00:59:42,855
lt gives me the shivers.
l'm pins and needles all over.

762
00:59:42,931 --> 00:59:45,923
lt's so exciting and so sad. Who wrote it?

763
00:59:47,903 --> 00:59:49,200
Your sister.

764
00:59:49,404 --> 00:59:50,803
-Really, Jo?
-What?

765
00:59:52,207 --> 00:59:53,139
Let me see.

766
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:55,676
-And l knew it all the time.
-lsn't that wonderful?

767
00:59:55,744 --> 00:59:59,236
Here it is: ''By Miss Josephine March.''

768
00:59:59,515 --> 01:00:02,313
Oh, Jo! l can't believe it!

769
01:00:02,484 --> 01:00:03,576
Beth!

770
01:00:04,186 --> 01:00:07,349
Jo's written a story and it's in the paper.
lsn't that marvelous?

771
01:00:07,422 --> 01:00:08,912
-Really?
-Look!

772
01:00:09,224 --> 01:00:10,816
Don't come near me.

773
01:00:16,465 --> 01:00:18,490
Something's wrong with Beth.

774
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:19,932
What is it?

775
01:00:21,036 --> 01:00:22,867
-l don't know.
-Where is she?

776
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:25,301
ln Marmee's cupboard.

777
01:00:25,374 --> 01:00:27,569
What's wrong? What's going on?

778
01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:31,041
Darling, what is it?

779
01:00:31,213 --> 01:00:32,771
Bethie, what is it?

780
01:00:32,848 --> 01:00:34,941
-What's wrong, Bethie?
-What is it?

781
01:00:39,555 --> 01:00:41,318
The baby's dead.

782
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:43,618
-What baby?
-Mrs. Hummel's.

783
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:46,256
lt died in my lap...

784
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,763
...before she got back with the doctor, Jo.

785
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,300
Now, there, there.

786
01:00:53,468 --> 01:00:56,062
The doctor said it was scarlet fever.

787
01:00:56,972 --> 01:00:58,667
-Scarlet fever!
-Hannah!

788
01:01:00,142 --> 01:01:02,372
You don't think l'll get it, do you, Jo?

789
01:01:02,444 --> 01:01:04,412
Oh, no, Bethie, of course you won't.

790
01:01:04,479 --> 01:01:07,642
But Amy must keep away
'cause she's never had it.

791
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:10,678
How does it start, Jo?

792
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:15,553
With a sort of a headache and sore throat...

793
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:17,882
...and queer feelings all over?

794
01:01:18,594 --> 01:01:20,221
l don't remember.

795
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:22,559
Laurie, give me that doctor's book.

796
01:01:22,631 --> 01:01:25,964
Jo, l think we'd better get her to bed.
Come along, Bethie.

797
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:27,668
l'll find out what to do.

798
01:01:28,604 --> 01:01:30,936
-l'll be all right.
-Of course you'll be all right.

799
01:01:31,006 --> 01:01:31,995
Here it is.

800
01:01:34,176 --> 01:01:37,976
Go get Dr. Bangs, will you, Mr. Laurie?
Have him come over as soon as he can.

801
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,176
You stay down here, Amy. You're to go off
to Aunt March's for a spell, just in case.

802
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:45,617
l won't! l'll stay right here with Beth.

803
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:47,120
Be quiet for once, Amy!

804
01:01:47,189 --> 01:01:48,986
l'm not going to be sent away.

805
01:01:49,091 --> 01:01:51,582
l advise you to go, Amy.
Scarlet fever's no joke.

806
01:01:51,693 --> 01:01:53,285
Well, l don't care!

807
01:01:54,096 --> 01:01:57,532
l'd rather get scarlet fever and die
than go to Aunt March's.

808
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:02,696
Now, Amy, be a good girl. l'll pop around
there every day and tell you how Beth is.

809
01:02:04,106 --> 01:02:07,906
l'll tell you what. Every day,
l'll come and take you out driving.

810
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:12,608
-Well, yes.
-That's our girl.

811
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:17,177
Oh, Bethie, if you should really be ill,
l'll never forgive myself.

812
01:02:17,252 --> 01:02:20,187
l let you go to the Hummel's every day
when l should've gone.

813
01:02:20,255 --> 01:02:23,156
No, it's my fault.
l'm the oldest and l should've gone.

814
01:02:23,558 --> 01:02:27,654
l promised Marmee l'd look after you.
Don't you think we ought to telegraph her?

815
01:02:27,729 --> 01:02:28,753
No, we mustn't.

816
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,391
She can't leave your father and
it'll only make her all the more anxious.

817
01:02:32,467 --> 01:02:35,561
Please don't telegraph, Jo.
Hannah knows just what to do.

818
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:39,297
l feel better already.

819
01:03:09,337 --> 01:03:13,899
lf Mrs. March can leave her husband,
we'd better send for her.

820
01:03:14,676 --> 01:03:18,874
The girls had the telegram all ready,
but l wouldn't let them send it.

821
01:03:19,481 --> 01:03:21,676
And now, the poor lady.

822
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:23,714
Oh, Mother.

823
01:03:25,687 --> 01:03:28,485
What if she shouldn't get here in time?

824
01:04:24,146 --> 01:04:25,773
ls it that bad?

825
01:04:29,317 --> 01:04:30,875
She doesn't know me.

826
01:04:32,487 --> 01:04:35,422
She doesn't look like my Beth.

827
01:04:37,993 --> 01:04:40,393
How are we going to bear it?

828
01:04:42,864 --> 01:04:46,391
Mother and Father, they seem so far away.

829
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:49,564
l'm here.

830
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,939
Hold on to me.

831
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:55,442
Jo, dear.

832
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:02,846
Poor Jo. You're all worn out.

833
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,552
What does the doctor say?

834
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,588
We're sending for Marmee.

835
01:05:11,893 --> 01:05:14,225
lf she were only here.

836
01:05:14,296 --> 01:05:19,131
She will be. Grandfather and l got fidgety
and thought your mother ought to know.

837
01:05:19,234 --> 01:05:23,364
She'd just never forgive us if Beth....
Well, if anything happened...

838
01:05:23,705 --> 01:05:25,468
...so l telegraphed yesterday.

839
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,839
She'll be here, on the 2:00 train tonight,
and l'm going to meet her.

840
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,310
Oh, Laurie! Oh, Marmee!

841
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:38,648
l beg your pardon, but you're such a dear.

842
01:05:39,788 --> 01:05:42,222
l couldn't help flying at you.

843
01:05:42,324 --> 01:05:44,815
Fly at me again. l rather like it.

844
01:05:45,026 --> 01:05:46,459
Laurie, you're so silly.

845
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:48,018
l'd better go.

846
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:53,566
Well, to the railroad station.

847
01:05:54,703 --> 01:05:56,796
And l shan't spare the horses.

848
01:05:57,038 --> 01:05:59,165
Bless you, Laurie, bless you.

849
01:06:11,453 --> 01:06:14,183
lf you really want Bethie...

850
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:18,750
...please wait until Marmee comes home.

851
01:06:21,363 --> 01:06:24,355
But, God, please don't...

852
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:27,325
...because she's so....

853
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:30,494
Please don't.

854
01:07:27,162 --> 01:07:28,959
lf God spares Bethie...

855
01:07:30,231 --> 01:07:32,756
...l'll love him and serve him all my life.

856
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:40,631
lf life's as hard as this, l don't see
how we shall ever get through it.

857
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:04,655
What is it? What is it?

858
01:08:23,752 --> 01:08:25,947
Goodbye, my Bethie.

859
01:08:26,988 --> 01:08:27,977
Goodbye.

860
01:08:44,305 --> 01:08:45,772
The fever's turned.

861
01:08:46,174 --> 01:08:49,439
-She's sleeping naturally.
-The Lord be praised.

862
01:09:06,728 --> 01:09:08,958
Marmee's here. She's come.

863
01:09:13,935 --> 01:09:16,233
lt's so wonderful to have Bethie with us.

864
01:09:16,304 --> 01:09:18,363
Come on, everything's all ready.

865
01:09:23,445 --> 01:09:26,209
ls she all right?
She's not very heavy, is she?

866
01:09:38,293 --> 01:09:40,056
lt didn't tire you, did it, dear?

867
01:09:40,128 --> 01:09:42,562
See the lovely flowers
Mr. Laurence sent you.

868
01:09:43,631 --> 01:09:44,689
And my birds.

869
01:09:49,938 --> 01:09:52,338
l've never been so happy.

870
01:09:54,609 --> 01:09:56,873
Begging your pardon,
do the Marches live here?

871
01:09:59,114 --> 01:10:01,947
Wait till she sees what l brought for her.

872
01:10:05,019 --> 01:10:06,281
Father, dear.

873
01:10:06,888 --> 01:10:08,321
Father, is it really you?

874
01:10:27,709 --> 01:10:29,404
l can't believe she's walking.

875
01:10:36,551 --> 01:10:39,577
-Oh, my dear.
-She hasn't walked since she was ill.

876
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,545
Are you expecting someone?

877
01:11:15,223 --> 01:11:16,952
Why, no. What do you mean?

878
01:11:26,334 --> 01:11:28,461
Why can't we stay as we are?

879
01:11:30,338 --> 01:11:32,306
Do you have to go and fall in love...

880
01:11:32,373 --> 01:11:36,104
...and spoil all our peace and fun
and happy times together?

881
01:11:39,013 --> 01:11:40,913
You're not like your old self a bit.

882
01:11:42,817 --> 01:11:46,378
And you're getting so far away from me.

883
01:11:48,756 --> 01:11:50,087
Meg, don't.

884
01:11:50,658 --> 01:11:52,922
Don't go and marry that man.

885
01:11:53,861 --> 01:11:56,489
l don't intend to go and marry any man.

886
01:11:56,631 --> 01:11:59,691
And if you mean Mr. Brooke,
he hasn't asked me.

887
01:12:00,868 --> 01:12:05,532
lf he should, l shall merely say
quite calmly and decidedly:

888
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:09,735
''l'm sorry but l agree with Mother
that it's too soon.''

889
01:12:10,011 --> 01:12:14,175
Oh, Meg! Hurrah for you! You're a trump.

890
01:12:14,282 --> 01:12:15,249
My hair.

891
01:12:15,316 --> 01:12:18,945
Then things will be as they used to be,
and now that Father's home--

892
01:12:23,057 --> 01:12:25,548
l'll go. l'll get out of the way.
Now don't forget.

893
01:12:25,927 --> 01:12:29,192
lf l could only see his face
when you tell him.

894
01:12:39,307 --> 01:12:41,207
Why, Mr. Brooke.

895
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:43,032
Good day, Miss Margaret.

896
01:12:43,645 --> 01:12:45,306
Won't you come in?

897
01:12:46,314 --> 01:12:48,305
l came to get my umbrella.

898
01:12:49,017 --> 01:12:51,952
That is to see
how your father finds himself today.

899
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,020
Why, he's here in the rack.

900
01:12:54,722 --> 01:12:57,054
l mean, it's very well.

901
01:12:58,026 --> 01:12:59,015
l mean....

902
01:13:00,128 --> 01:13:02,062
l'll tell him you're here.

903
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:03,690
Oh, please.

904
01:13:04,632 --> 01:13:06,395
Are you afraid of me, Margaret?

905
01:13:08,369 --> 01:13:11,270
How could l be
when you've been so kind to Father?

906
01:13:12,373 --> 01:13:14,364
l only wish l could thank you for it.

907
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,702
You can.

908
01:13:16,077 --> 01:13:17,977
-Shall l tell you how?
-No.

909
01:13:19,147 --> 01:13:20,910
Please don't.

910
01:13:20,982 --> 01:13:23,610
l only want to know
if you care for me a little, Meg.

911
01:13:24,218 --> 01:13:26,209
l love you so much, dear.

912
01:13:28,823 --> 01:13:30,814
Thank you, John.

913
01:13:33,027 --> 01:13:36,519
l agree with Mother, it's too soon.

914
01:13:36,831 --> 01:13:40,289
l'll wait. l don't mind how long
or how hard l have to work...

915
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:43,593
...if l can only know
l'm to have my reward in the end.

916
01:13:43,671 --> 01:13:45,866
Please, give me a little hope.

917
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:48,202
l'm afraid l can't.

918
01:13:50,478 --> 01:13:51,945
Do you really mean that?

919
01:13:53,181 --> 01:13:54,239
What's this?

920
01:13:54,382 --> 01:13:56,942
What's he doing here? Get along.

921
01:13:58,353 --> 01:13:59,911
What's going on here? Who is that?

922
01:13:59,987 --> 01:14:00,885
Mr. Brooke.

923
01:14:00,955 --> 01:14:04,413
The Laurence boy's tutor. Then it's true.

924
01:14:04,659 --> 01:14:07,184
He might hear you.
He's been so kind to Father.

925
01:14:07,295 --> 01:14:10,787
Well, he'll be much kinder
if he goes about his own business...

926
01:14:10,865 --> 01:14:12,992
...and leaves you alone. l won't stop.

927
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:15,362
l'm only thinking of your own good,
Margaret.

928
01:14:15,436 --> 01:14:17,666
You should make a rich match
to help your family.

929
01:14:17,739 --> 01:14:20,537
This rude person has no money,
no position in life.

930
01:14:20,675 --> 01:14:22,734
That doesn't mean he never will have.

931
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:27,704
So he's counting on my money.
He knows you've got rich relatives.

932
01:14:27,815 --> 01:14:30,181
Aunt March,
how dare you say such a thing.

933
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:32,742
My John wouldn't marry for money
any more than l would.

934
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,412
l'm not afraid of being poor.

935
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:38,357
And l know we shall be happy
because John loves me and l love him.

936
01:14:39,527 --> 01:14:41,188
Hoity-toity.

937
01:14:41,462 --> 01:14:42,952
Remember this, young lady:

938
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:46,659
lf you marry this rook or hook or crook,
he'll take care of you.

939
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:49,632
Not one penny of my money will he get.

940
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:56,968
My darling, did you mean it?

941
01:14:58,212 --> 01:15:01,010
l came back for my umbrella
and l couldn't help hearing.

942
01:15:01,249 --> 01:15:04,377
Then you will give me leave
to work for you and love you?

943
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,551
Yes, John.

944
01:15:24,872 --> 01:15:29,241
''And there to have given
and pledged their troth each to the other...

945
01:15:29,944 --> 01:15:35,177
''...and have declared the same by giving
and receiving a ring and by joining hands...

946
01:15:36,684 --> 01:15:39,949
''...l pronounce that they are man and wife.

947
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:45,357
''ln the name of the Father,
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

948
01:15:46,093 --> 01:15:47,117
''Amen.''

949
01:15:48,763 --> 01:15:51,493
''God the Father, God the Son...

950
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,163
''...and God the Holy Ghost...

951
01:15:54,669 --> 01:15:57,001
''...bless, preserve and keep you...

952
01:15:57,672 --> 01:16:00,505
''...that ye may so live together
in this life...

953
01:16:01,242 --> 01:16:05,440
''...that in the world to come
ye may have life everlasting.

954
01:16:07,548 --> 01:16:08,537
''Amen.''

955
01:16:13,254 --> 01:16:15,279
The first kiss for Marmee.

956
01:16:22,363 --> 01:16:26,299
Well, John, you've been a traitor.
l hope you'll take care of her.

957
01:16:27,034 --> 01:16:28,968
You're a lucky fellow, John.

958
01:16:57,732 --> 01:16:59,893
-Goodbye, Amy.
-Goodbye.

959
01:17:18,519 --> 01:17:19,747
Don't mind, Jo.

960
01:17:24,225 --> 01:17:25,886
You've still got me.

961
01:17:27,161 --> 01:17:29,254
l'm not good for much, l know...

962
01:17:31,866 --> 01:17:33,663
...but l'll stand by you...

963
01:17:35,102 --> 01:17:36,831
...all the days of my life.

964
01:17:38,472 --> 01:17:40,133
l know you will.

965
01:17:42,977 --> 01:17:45,969
You don't know
what a comfort you are to me, Laurie.

966
01:17:51,185 --> 01:17:52,584
-Jo--
-No, don't say it.

967
01:17:52,653 --> 01:17:54,814
l will, and you must hear me.

968
01:17:55,089 --> 01:17:56,613
lt's no use, Jo.

969
01:17:56,757 --> 01:17:59,624
You've kept away from me
ever since l got back from college.

970
01:17:59,694 --> 01:18:03,528
l studied so hard
and l graduated with honors, all for you.

971
01:18:03,731 --> 01:18:06,757
-l know, and l'm so proud of you.
-Then won't you listen?

972
01:18:07,001 --> 01:18:07,990
Please.

973
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:13,805
l've loved you ever since l've known you.

974
01:18:14,275 --> 01:18:15,640
l couldn't help it.

975
01:18:16,177 --> 01:18:18,645
l've tried to show it,
but you wouldn't let me.

976
01:18:18,813 --> 01:18:21,748
Now l'm going to make you hear it
and give me an answer...

977
01:18:21,849 --> 01:18:24,579
...for l just can't go on so any longer.

978
01:18:26,687 --> 01:18:29,383
l know l'm not half good enough for you.

979
01:18:29,557 --> 01:18:32,685
But if you love me,
you can make me anything you like.

980
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:35,722
As though l'd change you, Laurie.

981
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,768
You should marry some lovely,
accomplished girl who adores you.

982
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:45,438
Someone who would grace
your beautiful home.

983
01:18:45,573 --> 01:18:50,203
l shouldn't.
l loathe elegant society and you like it.

984
01:18:50,645 --> 01:18:54,308
And you hate my scribbling
and l can't get on without it.

985
01:18:54,849 --> 01:18:56,282
And we should quarrel.

986
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:58,875
-No, we shouldn't.
-Yes, we always have, you know.

987
01:18:59,053 --> 01:19:02,045
Everything would be horrid
if we were ever foolish enough to--

988
01:19:02,156 --> 01:19:05,455
Marry? No, it wouldn't, Jo.
lt would be heaven.

989
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,218
Don't disappoint us, dear. Don't.
Everybody expects it.

990
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:11,857
Grandfather has set his heart on it.

991
01:19:14,135 --> 01:19:17,070
And l just can't go on without you.

992
01:19:18,272 --> 01:19:21,264
Please, say you will.

993
01:19:24,278 --> 01:19:25,575
l can't.

994
01:19:27,648 --> 01:19:29,013
Laurie, l'm sorry.

995
01:19:30,551 --> 01:19:32,644
So desperately sorry.

996
01:19:38,325 --> 01:19:43,126
l'm so grateful to you,
and so proud and fond of you.

997
01:19:44,465 --> 01:19:47,491
l don't know why l can't love you
the way you want me to.

998
01:19:47,735 --> 01:19:51,694
l've tried, but l can't change the feeling...

999
01:19:53,407 --> 01:19:56,399
...and it would be a lie to say l do if l don't.

1000
01:19:58,012 --> 01:19:59,639
Really truly, Jo?

1001
01:20:01,816 --> 01:20:03,545
Really truly, dear.

1002
01:20:06,454 --> 01:20:08,285
l don't think l'll ever marry.

1003
01:20:09,356 --> 01:20:10,550
Yes, you will.

1004
01:20:11,425 --> 01:20:14,417
You'll meet some good-for-nothing,
no-account idiot...

1005
01:20:14,495 --> 01:20:17,862
...and you'll fall in love with him,
and work, live and die for him.

1006
01:20:17,932 --> 01:20:20,730
l know you will. lt's your way.

1007
01:20:21,302 --> 01:20:23,998
And l'll have to stand by and see it.

1008
01:20:24,472 --> 01:20:26,565
Well, l'll be hanged if l do.

1009
01:20:28,142 --> 01:20:29,336
Where are you going?

1010
01:20:29,944 --> 01:20:32,310
To the devil, and l hope you'll be sorry.

1011
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,811
Laurie, please....

1012
01:21:13,554 --> 01:21:15,545
Why aren't you in bed? lt's late.

1013
01:21:18,325 --> 01:21:20,418
Mother, l want to go away.

1014
01:21:21,195 --> 01:21:23,254
l mean, just for a little while.

1015
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:27,992
l don't know. l feel restless and anxious
to be doing something.

1016
01:21:29,203 --> 01:21:32,195
l'd like to hop a little way
and try my wings.

1017
01:21:32,873 --> 01:21:34,340
Where would you hop?

1018
01:21:34,742 --> 01:21:35,766
To New York.

1019
01:21:36,777 --> 01:21:38,677
l've thought about it a lot lately.

1020
01:21:38,746 --> 01:21:39,974
You can spare me now.

1021
01:21:40,047 --> 01:21:43,574
l could go to Mrs. Kirke's and help
with the children as part of my board.

1022
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:46,984
lt wouldn't cost much,
and l'd see and hear new things...

1023
01:21:47,054 --> 01:21:49,818
...and get a lot of new ideas for my stories.

1024
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:51,489
l don't doubt it.

1025
01:21:51,559 --> 01:21:54,619
Jo, nothing's happened
between you and Laurie?

1026
01:21:58,766 --> 01:22:02,497
Don't be surprised, dear.
Mothers have to have sharp eyes...

1027
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:06,499
...especially when their daughters
keep their troubles to themselves.

1028
01:22:06,574 --> 01:22:10,704
Oh, Marmee, l'd have told you,
only l thought it would blow over...

1029
01:22:12,646 --> 01:22:16,013
...and it seemed kind of wrong
to tell Laurie's poor little secret.

1030
01:22:16,717 --> 01:22:20,710
lt's only that he's got
a foolish romantic notion in his head...

1031
01:22:21,121 --> 01:22:25,990
...and l think if l go away for a time,
he may get over it.

1032
01:22:26,293 --> 01:22:27,521
l see.

1033
01:22:28,829 --> 01:22:32,788
And how do you feel
about this ''foolish romantic notion''?

1034
01:22:36,136 --> 01:22:39,628
l love him dearly as l always have.

1035
01:22:42,576 --> 01:22:46,307
l feel as though
l've stabbed my dearest friend.

1036
01:22:49,483 --> 01:22:52,179
And yet, l don't want to make a mistake.

1037
01:22:53,988 --> 01:22:58,948
You're right, Jo. l think it would be
a good idea for both your sakes.

1038
01:23:00,628 --> 01:23:02,528
Now, come to bed, dear.

1039
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:07,865
l'll talk to Father about it.
And if he agrees, we'll write to Mrs. Kirke.

1040
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,506
-Good night, dear.
-Good night, Marmee.

1041
01:23:21,015 --> 01:23:24,542
Now, my dear,
l think l've told you everything...

1042
01:23:24,852 --> 01:23:29,152
...and it will be a great load off my mind
knowing the children are safe with you.

1043
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:33,018
l'm very busy so l'll have Mamie
show you to your room.

1044
01:23:33,627 --> 01:23:34,616
Mamie!

1045
01:23:35,963 --> 01:23:39,399
l've given you a little inside room.
lt's all l had...

1046
01:23:39,566 --> 01:23:42,558
...but it has a table
and you can use it for your writing.

1047
01:23:42,636 --> 01:23:43,625
That's great.

1048
01:23:43,837 --> 01:23:44,895
Mamie!

1049
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,568
You must come down here some
after dinner and be sociable.

1050
01:23:49,643 --> 01:23:52,237
l promised your mother
l wouldn't let you be homesick...

1051
01:23:52,313 --> 01:23:55,009
...and l have only the most refined people
in my house.

1052
01:23:55,215 --> 01:23:56,204
Mamie!

1053
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:58,113
Here l am, Ms. Kirke.

1054
01:23:58,185 --> 01:24:00,585
Mamie, this is Miss Josephine.

1055
01:24:01,822 --> 01:24:04,518
Will you take her up to her room
and find the children?

1056
01:24:04,725 --> 01:24:06,522
l'll see you later, my dear.

1057
01:24:07,695 --> 01:24:09,595
Right this way, please.

1058
01:24:09,797 --> 01:24:11,890
Children, children!

1059
01:24:13,033 --> 01:24:16,935
They ain't a bad lot but, my stars,
they take a deal of handling.

1060
01:24:17,871 --> 01:24:19,896
Jimmy! Kitty!

1061
01:24:22,209 --> 01:24:23,836
You heard me.

1062
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:29,948
Come on out, l know where you are.

1063
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:35,144
The bear's going to eat my baby.
Save my poor baby.

1064
01:24:42,629 --> 01:24:45,462
My baby! Don't eat my baby!

1065
01:24:48,402 --> 01:24:51,098
Professor!

1066
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:58,244
l beg your pardon.

1067
01:24:58,779 --> 01:25:01,179
Please. l'm so sorry.

1068
01:25:02,549 --> 01:25:05,882
This is Miss Josephine
what's got you in charge now.

1069
01:25:06,053 --> 01:25:07,350
-Hello.
-How do you do?

1070
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:10,584
-And this is Professor Bhaer.
-How do you do?

1071
01:25:10,657 --> 01:25:13,524
-Come on, let's finish the game.
-l want to play some more.

1072
01:25:13,594 --> 01:25:17,030
That is for Miss Josephine to say,
but we've frightened her already.

1073
01:25:17,097 --> 01:25:20,931
Oh, no, but l didn't expect to meet
a grizzly bear in the upper hall.

1074
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:24,663
Mamie, wait.

1075
01:25:25,139 --> 01:25:28,233
The back is too young
to carry such heavy loads.

1076
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:32,877
Come on, children, let's play soldiers.
Tina, you are the general.

1077
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,774
You're the captain. And here, Lieutenant.

1078
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:38,551
Forward march!

1079
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,556
He's such a lovely man.

1080
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:52,692
l know he must've been a gentleman
sometime or other...

1081
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,030
...but he's as poor as a church mouse now.

1082
01:25:55,102 --> 01:25:56,694
What does he do?

1083
01:25:57,738 --> 01:26:00,104
He's a professor, see?

1084
01:26:00,274 --> 01:26:03,004
He learns them how they talk
in foreign countries.

1085
01:26:03,077 --> 01:26:06,308
l don't know what good it does them
when they're living right here.

1086
01:27:48,882 --> 01:27:52,477
Good evening, my little friend,
good evening.

1087
01:27:52,753 --> 01:27:53,981
Please, don't stop.

1088
01:27:55,155 --> 01:27:56,747
lt was beautiful.

1089
01:27:57,090 --> 01:28:00,355
l've heard you play it often
and wanted to ask you what it was.

1090
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:02,690
l'd so like to send it to my little sister.

1091
01:28:03,063 --> 01:28:07,022
<i>Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt.</i>
The words are by Goethe.

1092
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:09,764
Do you speak German?

1093
01:28:11,338 --> 01:28:15,502
Then l'd better give it to you in English.
Let's see now.

1094
01:28:23,183 --> 01:28:27,517
''Only who knows what longing is

1095
01:28:29,223 --> 01:28:32,989
''Can know what l suffer

1096
01:28:36,697 --> 01:28:42,966
''Alone and parted far from joy
and gladness

1097
01:28:55,082 --> 01:28:57,448
''My senses fail

1098
01:28:59,286 --> 01:29:01,652
''A burning fire devours me

1099
01:29:09,596 --> 01:29:11,962
''My senses fail

1100
01:29:12,866 --> 01:29:15,232
''A burning fire devours me''

1101
01:29:24,544 --> 01:29:26,273
l know how he felt.

1102
01:29:26,613 --> 01:29:28,240
Tchaikovsky did, also.

1103
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:32,476
That is why he wrote this beautiful,
heartbreaking music.

1104
01:29:33,553 --> 01:29:36,113
lf only l could write something like that.

1105
01:29:37,124 --> 01:29:40,355
Something splendid
that would set other hearts on fire.

1106
01:29:40,827 --> 01:29:42,624
That is genius.

1107
01:29:44,498 --> 01:29:47,092
Do you wish to write, my little friend?

1108
01:29:47,234 --> 01:29:49,134
Yes, that's my longing.

1109
01:29:49,202 --> 01:29:51,602
l've sold two stories already
since l've been here.

1110
01:29:51,672 --> 01:29:56,006
That is very good.
l'd like to read them. May l?

1111
01:29:56,476 --> 01:29:59,843
Would you?
l'd so like to know your opinion.

1112
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:05,043
l would be very happy.
You have the ardent spirit. l like that.

1113
01:30:12,426 --> 01:30:15,122
What shall l ask for at the music shop?

1114
01:30:22,636 --> 01:30:25,332
l think l'd better write it down for you.

1115
01:30:26,473 --> 01:30:29,135
Well, now,
here is a teacher without a pencil.

1116
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:32,476
Let me sew that button for you
before you lose it.

1117
01:30:32,546 --> 01:30:34,446
No, l sew on buttons.

1118
01:30:34,514 --> 01:30:36,243
Not very well, evidently.

1119
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:38,509
Well.

1120
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:49,322
-Who was Goldilocks, a little girl?
-Yes.

1121
01:30:49,429 --> 01:30:51,989
''And she...

1122
01:30:52,232 --> 01:30:56,168
''...went into their house...

1123
01:30:56,837 --> 01:30:59,601
''...and saw three chairs.

1124
01:31:00,507 --> 01:31:02,668
''Three chairs.

1125
01:31:02,743 --> 01:31:07,146
''One was the baby one,
one was the daddy one...

1126
01:31:07,347 --> 01:31:09,474
''...and one was the mommy one.

1127
01:31:10,784 --> 01:31:12,775
''So she sat down in the big one....

1128
01:31:13,019 --> 01:31:14,646
''And it was too hard.''

1129
01:31:16,089 --> 01:31:18,819
Miss Josephine,
you're to go to the parlor right away.

1130
01:31:18,892 --> 01:31:20,257
Someone to see you.

1131
01:31:20,327 --> 01:31:22,727
-Who is it?
-l can't tell you. lt's a surprise.

1132
01:31:22,863 --> 01:31:25,058
All right, children, that will be all for today.

1133
01:31:25,132 --> 01:31:28,431
Now run along and wash your hands
and faces for tea.

1134
01:31:28,502 --> 01:31:31,767
-l'll finish the story tomorrow.
-All right.

1135
01:31:32,739 --> 01:31:35,799
-Who is it, Mamie?
-l can't tell you. lt's a surprise.

1136
01:31:35,976 --> 01:31:37,841
Are these some of your new stories?

1137
01:31:40,814 --> 01:31:41,906
Oh, they look...

1138
01:31:41,982 --> 01:31:44,678
...creepier than <i>The Duke's Daughter</i>.
Can l read them?

1139
01:31:44,785 --> 01:31:46,548
Yes, if you want to.

1140
01:31:50,624 --> 01:31:56,563
'' <i>The Place of the Coventrys</i>
or <i>The Secret of a Guilty Heart</i>...

1141
01:31:57,431 --> 01:31:59,331
''...by Josephine March.''

1142
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,764
Then it's true.

1143
01:32:08,975 --> 01:32:10,704
-Amy!
-Darling!

1144
01:32:11,645 --> 01:32:13,408
-Aunt March!
-Josephine.

1145
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:14,911
l'm so glad to see you.

1146
01:32:14,981 --> 01:32:16,778
What took you so long to get down?

1147
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:18,010
Tell me everything.

1148
01:32:18,084 --> 01:32:19,381
We can't stop now.

1149
01:32:19,453 --> 01:32:22,479
We've got to get to the shipping office
before it closes.

1150
01:32:22,889 --> 01:32:26,723
Shipping office? Aunt March, Europe?

1151
01:32:28,061 --> 01:32:30,029
l'm taking Amy with me.

1152
01:32:32,866 --> 01:32:35,300
Well, maybe you can go next time.

1153
01:32:36,503 --> 01:32:37,834
Next time?

1154
01:32:41,675 --> 01:32:44,337
Tell me, is Meg all right?

1155
01:32:44,878 --> 01:32:46,607
And Marmee and Father?

1156
01:32:46,746 --> 01:32:47,872
And how's my Beth?

1157
01:32:48,014 --> 01:32:51,711
She's better again,
but she isn't rosy as she used to be.

1158
01:32:51,918 --> 01:32:55,081
Oh, my poor Beth.
Why doesn't she get strong?

1159
01:32:55,322 --> 01:32:56,755
And Laurie?

1160
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:59,151
Didn't you see them when they were here?

1161
01:32:59,292 --> 01:33:02,659
He and his grandfather
have been in Europe for weeks.

1162
01:33:04,531 --> 01:33:06,294
Laurie in New York?

1163
01:33:07,133 --> 01:33:09,124
And didn't come to see me?

1164
01:33:10,203 --> 01:33:13,570
l'm sure you can't blame him
after the way you picked up...

1165
01:33:13,673 --> 01:33:16,972
...and trotted off without so much
as saying goodbye to any of us.

1166
01:33:17,911 --> 01:33:20,573
l think you've treated everybody
shamefully.

1167
01:33:21,214 --> 01:33:22,806
Come along, Amy.

1168
01:33:23,717 --> 01:33:27,448
Jo, dear, l wish it were you.

1169
01:33:28,188 --> 01:33:30,247
l know how you've always longed to go.

1170
01:33:30,323 --> 01:33:33,190
No, darling. lt's your reward.

1171
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:35,854
You've always done sweet things
to please Aunt March.

1172
01:33:35,929 --> 01:33:38,557
Think of all the wonderful things
you are going to see:

1173
01:33:38,632 --> 01:33:41,726
The Turners,
the Raphaels and the Leonardos.

1174
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:46,034
You seem to forget
waiting cabs cost money.

1175
01:33:46,506 --> 01:33:49,066
That's the trouble with folks
who never had anything.

1176
01:33:49,142 --> 01:33:51,007
Easy come, easy go.

1177
01:33:51,645 --> 01:33:53,636
We'll be right back, Josephine.

1178
01:33:54,748 --> 01:33:56,181
Goodbye, darling.

1179
01:34:27,047 --> 01:34:29,538
Miss Josephine?

1180
01:34:31,284 --> 01:34:32,581
Yes, Professor Bhaer.

1181
01:34:32,686 --> 01:34:35,814
l have read your stories
and l would like to return them to you.

1182
01:34:35,989 --> 01:34:38,082
Will you please come in?

1183
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:39,849
Yes, thank you.

1184
01:34:45,699 --> 01:34:47,360
Did you like them?

1185
01:34:47,634 --> 01:34:51,092
Well, Miss March, l must be honest.
l was disappointed.

1186
01:34:52,172 --> 01:34:54,504
Why do you write
such artificial characters...

1187
01:34:54,674 --> 01:34:59,441
...such artificial plots, villains,
murderers and such women?

1188
01:34:59,579 --> 01:35:01,547
Why don't you write a....

1189
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:10,256
Miss March, please. l am so sorry.

1190
01:35:12,759 --> 01:35:16,320
l didn't want to hurt you.
l wanted to help you.

1191
01:35:16,796 --> 01:35:19,424
What a blundering fool l am.

1192
01:35:21,935 --> 01:35:23,926
lt isn't that.

1193
01:35:24,904 --> 01:35:27,338
Please, don't pay any attention to me.

1194
01:35:27,807 --> 01:35:30,640
Forgive me, please. Come, sit down.

1195
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:33,468
Forgive me.

1196
01:35:33,546 --> 01:35:37,710
No, it's just that everything seems
to come at once.

1197
01:35:39,619 --> 01:35:42,782
The rest doesn't matter so much.
l can bear that.

1198
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:47,887
But Laurie, l can never get over Laurie.

1199
01:35:48,962 --> 01:35:51,897
<i>Herr</i> Laurie, your friend.

1200
01:35:53,733 --> 01:35:55,997
-Something has happened to him?
-Yes.

1201
01:35:56,736 --> 01:35:59,796
No, something has happened to me.

1202
01:36:02,342 --> 01:36:07,837
He came to New York
and he didn't even come to see me.

1203
01:36:09,983 --> 01:36:12,076
What a fool he must be.

1204
01:36:14,621 --> 01:36:18,148
No, it's my fault. But l thought that....

1205
01:36:18,491 --> 01:36:20,982
What does it matter what l thought?

1206
01:36:21,094 --> 01:36:23,858
l've made a mess of it
as l do of everything.

1207
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:28,496
But l have tried and when l think
of Aunt March taking Amy to Europe...

1208
01:36:28,568 --> 01:36:30,900
...when she always promised
she'd take me...

1209
01:36:31,204 --> 01:36:33,502
...not that l begrudge Amy the trip, but....

1210
01:36:33,673 --> 01:36:35,937
l suppose that's just what l am doing.

1211
01:36:36,009 --> 01:36:39,501
That trip to Europe
that you so looked forward to.

1212
01:36:39,579 --> 01:36:42,946
That is too bad.
That is a cruel disappointment, l know.

1213
01:36:43,016 --> 01:36:44,916
On top of it, that stupid professor.

1214
01:36:44,984 --> 01:36:47,179
He comes blundering
and makes things worse.

1215
01:36:47,253 --> 01:36:51,519
No. lf l can't stand the truth,
l'm not worth anything.

1216
01:36:52,325 --> 01:36:55,385
l didn't think those stories
were so very good.

1217
01:36:55,662 --> 01:36:57,129
But you see...

1218
01:36:58,364 --> 01:37:01,265
... <i>The Duke's Daughter</i>
paid the butcher's bill...

1219
01:37:01,501 --> 01:37:04,834
...and the <i>Curse of the Coventrys</i>
was the blessing of the Marches...

1220
01:37:05,171 --> 01:37:07,662
...because it sent Marmee and Beth
to the seashore.

1221
01:37:07,807 --> 01:37:09,832
Yes, that is what l have thought.

1222
01:37:10,376 --> 01:37:14,676
And then l have said to myself:
''l maybe have no right to speak.''

1223
01:37:15,915 --> 01:37:19,908
But then again, l said to myself:
''l maybe have no right to be silent.''

1224
01:37:20,286 --> 01:37:23,084
Miss March, you have talent.

1225
01:37:23,323 --> 01:37:26,520
-Do you really think so?
-Otherwise l could not say.

1226
01:37:26,626 --> 01:37:27,854
And you know that.

1227
01:37:28,328 --> 01:37:31,889
And l say to you,
''Sweep mud on the street first...

1228
01:37:32,465 --> 01:37:34,626
''...before you are false to that talent.''

1229
01:37:35,668 --> 01:37:37,158
Say to yourself:

1230
01:37:37,337 --> 01:37:42,297
''l will never write one single line
which l have not heard in my own heart.''

1231
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:46,044
Say to yourself, ''While l am young...

1232
01:37:46,112 --> 01:37:50,378
''...l will write these simple,
beautiful things that l understand now.

1233
01:37:51,017 --> 01:37:56,512
''Maybe later, when l am a little older
and l have felt life more...

1234
01:37:56,756 --> 01:37:59,691
''...then l will write
about these poor wretches...

1235
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:04,392
''...but l will make them live and breathe
like my Shakespeare did.''

1236
01:38:05,398 --> 01:38:08,492
-Will you do that, my little friend?
-Yes, l'll try.

1237
01:38:09,302 --> 01:38:12,100
But l don't think l'll ever be a Shakespeare,
do you?

1238
01:38:13,673 --> 01:38:15,868
But you can be a Josephine March.

1239
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:20,079
And l assure you that is plenty.

1240
01:38:20,947 --> 01:38:24,542
And now,
don't be disappointed about that trip.

1241
01:38:26,119 --> 01:38:28,087
-Here.
-Peppermint, good.

1242
01:38:29,322 --> 01:38:32,382
Those of us who have been
all over the Old World...

1243
01:38:32,725 --> 01:38:35,216
...can find many things in the New...

1244
01:38:36,362 --> 01:38:39,331
...that are beautiful and young.

1245
01:38:48,174 --> 01:38:50,438
Miss March,
it would give me great pleasure...

1246
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:54,173
...if l could show you some
of these things while you are here.

1247
01:38:54,247 --> 01:38:56,215
lf you would care to have so.

1248
01:38:57,917 --> 01:38:59,248
Thank you.

1249
01:39:02,722 --> 01:39:05,885
Then you are not angry
with the blundering professor...

1250
01:39:05,959 --> 01:39:08,359
...who takes the wrong times
for his lectures?

1251
01:39:08,728 --> 01:39:10,252
How could l be?

1252
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:16,460
<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>, my little friend.

1253
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:05,181
Did you really like it?

1254
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:07,617
-l never had such a....
-Happy, my little friend.

1255
01:40:07,687 --> 01:40:11,350
She was divine.
l don't want to be a writer anymore.

1256
01:40:11,658 --> 01:40:15,094
l want to be a wonderful singer
and thrill thousands of people...

1257
01:40:15,161 --> 01:40:19,154
...so that they cheer
and throw flowers at me like that.

1258
01:40:20,066 --> 01:40:21,590
Bravo. Bravo.

1259
01:40:23,336 --> 01:40:25,463
But l wouldn't make up my mind so soon...

1260
01:40:25,538 --> 01:40:28,371
...because at the art museum
you wanted to be a sculptress...

1261
01:40:28,441 --> 01:40:30,773
...at the circus you thought
the bareback rider...

1262
01:40:30,843 --> 01:40:33,004
...was the most beautiful thing
in the world.

1263
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:35,104
l know, but to sing like that!

1264
01:40:44,424 --> 01:40:46,016
l forgot.

1265
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:48,627
Something inside me tonight
makes me want to shout.

1266
01:40:48,695 --> 01:40:49,821
What would you shout?

1267
01:40:49,896 --> 01:40:54,959
l'd say, ''Look at me, world.
l'm Jo March and l'm so happy.''

1268
01:40:55,134 --> 01:40:57,329
My little friend, you are happy.

1269
01:40:58,037 --> 01:41:02,497
You haven't missed much lately
your home and your old friends?

1270
01:41:02,575 --> 01:41:04,600
But you're responsible for that.

1271
01:41:05,745 --> 01:41:08,077
Maybe they haven't missed me
so much either.

1272
01:41:08,147 --> 01:41:10,809
They're so busy with Meg
and those blessed babies.

1273
01:41:10,917 --> 01:41:13,078
Yes, how are those remarkable twins?

1274
01:41:13,186 --> 01:41:15,711
Wonderful. Meg's so proud of them.

1275
01:41:17,223 --> 01:41:19,157
Have you heard from Europe?

1276
01:41:19,392 --> 01:41:22,054
Nearly every boat
brings a letter from Amy.

1277
01:41:22,128 --> 01:41:24,255
And your friend...

1278
01:41:24,664 --> 01:41:26,723
...<i>Herr</i> Laurie, have you heard from him?

1279
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:30,958
Only through Amy. They met at Vichy
and had a wonderful time together.

1280
01:41:31,971 --> 01:41:34,804
Miss March, l am bold to ask a favor.

1281
01:41:40,013 --> 01:41:42,243
Would you give me the address
of your father?

1282
01:41:42,415 --> 01:41:44,576
l wish to write him and ask him something.

1283
01:41:46,085 --> 01:41:48,576
Why, yes.
He'd be so happy to hear from you.

1284
01:41:48,855 --> 01:41:51,380
They almost know you.
l've told them all about you.

1285
01:41:51,457 --> 01:41:53,789
And they always ask after you
in their letters.

1286
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:55,919
-Really?
-Yes, now l'll show you.

1287
01:41:56,696 --> 01:41:58,186
This is so nice.

1288
01:42:07,473 --> 01:42:08,804
Not l hope....

1289
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:13,176
lt's Beth. She's....

1290
01:42:16,049 --> 01:42:18,517
l must go at once.

1291
01:42:18,785 --> 01:42:23,745
My friend, can l do something for you?
l'm sure there is something l can do.

1292
01:42:25,391 --> 01:42:29,418
No, there's nothing. Thank you.

1293
01:42:35,101 --> 01:42:36,728
Oh, Jo...

1294
01:42:37,537 --> 01:42:39,266
...to think you're home.

1295
01:42:40,606 --> 01:42:42,938
lf Amy were here, we'd all be together.

1296
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:47,370
She'll be home in the spring, darling.

1297
01:42:49,048 --> 01:42:53,280
And l'm going to have you all well
and rosy by then.

1298
01:43:01,494 --> 01:43:05,555
Poor Jo, you mustn't be afraid.

1299
01:43:09,435 --> 01:43:11,266
Doesn't that sound funny...

1300
01:43:12,004 --> 01:43:15,633
...me saying that to you
when you've always said it to me?

1301
01:43:19,479 --> 01:43:21,276
You've always reminded me...

1302
01:43:22,615 --> 01:43:26,949
...of a seagull, strong and wild...

1303
01:43:27,753 --> 01:43:29,846
...and fond of the wind and the storm...

1304
01:43:30,823 --> 01:43:33,485
...dreaming of flying far out to sea.

1305
01:43:35,728 --> 01:43:39,459
And Mother always said
that l was like a little cricket...

1306
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:43,666
...chirping contentedly on the hearth...

1307
01:43:44,837 --> 01:43:49,035
...never able to bear the thought
of leaving home.

1308
01:43:50,943 --> 01:43:52,535
But now...

1309
01:43:54,514 --> 01:43:55,674
...it's different.

1310
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:01,314
l can't express it very well.

1311
01:44:01,921 --> 01:44:05,015
l shouldn't try to, to anyone but you...

1312
01:44:06,692 --> 01:44:10,685
...because l can't speak out
to anyone but my Jo.

1313
01:44:15,735 --> 01:44:17,259
l'm not afraid anymore.

1314
01:44:19,338 --> 01:44:25,743
l'm learning that l don't lose you,
that you'll be more to me than ever...

1315
01:44:27,013 --> 01:44:30,710
...and nothing can part us,
though it seems to.

1316
01:44:37,924 --> 01:44:38,913
Oh, Jo.

1317
01:44:40,826 --> 01:44:44,819
l think l'll be homesick for you
even in heaven.

1318
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:22,031
The little loves.

1319
01:45:23,736 --> 01:45:26,728
-l'm afraid they're tiring you.
-Oh, no.

1320
01:45:28,174 --> 01:45:30,870
lt's time for my little regiment
to take its nap.

1321
01:45:47,126 --> 01:45:49,686
-They're sweet.
-Yes.

1322
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:56,158
l think l can sleep now.

1323
01:46:01,007 --> 01:46:04,135
Look, Jo, my birds.

1324
01:46:05,077 --> 01:46:06,806
They got back in time.

1325
01:46:14,954 --> 01:46:18,321
-Bethie!
-Mother!

1326
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:21,820
My daughter!

1327
01:46:21,894 --> 01:46:23,657
Bethie!

1328
01:46:29,335 --> 01:46:30,700
Oh, Marmee.

1329
01:46:33,773 --> 01:46:35,400
We mustn't cry.

1330
01:46:36,676 --> 01:46:39,338
We must be glad she's well at last.

1331
01:46:40,112 --> 01:46:41,773
No, Marmee, don't cry.

1332
01:46:56,395 --> 01:46:58,920
lf only there were another boat
leaving sooner.

1333
01:46:58,998 --> 01:47:03,059
Now, my dear, you've been so brave,
you must be patient.

1334
01:47:03,803 --> 01:47:06,636
We're going back on the very first boat.

1335
01:47:07,873 --> 01:47:11,138
l still think you should obey
your mother and stay.

1336
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:15,640
l know. But l'm sick for home, Aunt March.
l hate all this now.

1337
01:47:16,382 --> 01:47:20,443
lf it weren't for this, l'd have been there,
at least to say goodbye.

1338
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:30,185
Laurie, l knew you'd come.

1339
01:47:31,731 --> 01:47:33,164
My child!

1340
01:47:33,733 --> 01:47:35,394
Mr. Laurence!

1341
01:47:36,068 --> 01:47:40,164
Amy, we were in Germany,
and Marmee's letter had to be forwarded...

1342
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:43,308
...but l came the moment l got it
because....

1343
01:47:43,776 --> 01:47:47,109
Well, you must comfort me now, too.

1344
01:47:53,786 --> 01:47:57,517
l'm so thankful you're here.
l haven't known what to do with the child.

1345
01:47:57,857 --> 01:47:59,791
Perhaps you can persuade her to stay.

1346
01:48:04,597 --> 01:48:07,395
-The elegant young matron.
-Hello, Jo, dear.

1347
01:48:07,466 --> 01:48:09,991
l've Sally Moffat's carriage.
l'm making some calls.

1348
01:48:10,069 --> 01:48:12,663
You want me to mind the demons
while you're gone?

1349
01:48:12,738 --> 01:48:14,365
No, l want you to go with me.

1350
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:17,202
Jo, dear. lt's a lovely day
and l want to talk to you.

1351
01:48:17,276 --> 01:48:20,109
Talk to me now.
You know l can't bear calls.

1352
01:48:24,216 --> 01:48:27,185
-How's your story coming?
-Sent it off yesterday.

1353
01:48:27,553 --> 01:48:30,920
-Without us reading it?
-You can read it when they send it back.

1354
01:48:33,225 --> 01:48:35,318
-l had a letter from Amy.
-So did Marmee.

1355
01:48:36,162 --> 01:48:39,222
They're in Valrosa now
and she says it's paradise.

1356
01:48:41,801 --> 01:48:43,792
Jo, l'd like to ask you something.

1357
01:48:45,971 --> 01:48:48,064
l've been wondering...

1358
01:48:48,707 --> 01:48:50,504
...how would you feel...

1359
01:48:51,677 --> 01:48:55,545
...if you should hear that your Laurie
was learning to care for somebody else?

1360
01:48:59,318 --> 01:49:01,013
Meg, who?

1361
01:49:03,556 --> 01:49:04,523
Amy?

1362
01:49:07,827 --> 01:49:11,627
l don't know. l can't be sure.
l'm only reading between the lines.

1363
01:49:16,035 --> 01:49:17,935
Then you wouldn't mind?

1364
01:49:18,237 --> 01:49:20,432
No, Meg. How could l?

1365
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,735
l think it would be wonderful, don't you?

1366
01:49:23,809 --> 01:49:25,800
Yes, but l wasn't quite sure.

1367
01:49:27,847 --> 01:49:29,678
Forgive me, dear...

1368
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:35,412
...but l have so much
and you seem so alone.

1369
01:49:36,989 --> 01:49:39,617
l thought lately
that maybe if Laurie came back--

1370
01:49:39,725 --> 01:49:41,955
No, dear. lt's better as it is.

1371
01:49:42,061 --> 01:49:45,360
And l'm glad if he and Amy
are learning to love each other.

1372
01:49:46,098 --> 01:49:47,998
You're right about one thing though.

1373
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:52,161
l am lonely and maybe
if Laurie had come back...

1374
01:49:53,005 --> 01:49:54,632
...l might've said yes.

1375
01:49:54,907 --> 01:49:58,104
Not because l love him any differently,
but because...

1376
01:49:59,311 --> 01:50:04,146
...it means more to me now
to be loved than it used to.

1377
01:50:38,484 --> 01:50:39,678
Laurie.

1378
01:50:40,786 --> 01:50:42,947
Oh, my Laurie!

1379
01:50:44,924 --> 01:50:47,688
Jo, dear. Are you glad to see me?

1380
01:50:48,827 --> 01:50:50,089
Glad?

1381
01:50:50,729 --> 01:50:56,065
My blessed boy!
Words can't express my gladness.

1382
01:50:56,368 --> 01:50:57,665
And where's your wife?

1383
01:50:57,736 --> 01:51:00,671
They all stopped in at Meg's,
but l couldn't wait to see you.

1384
01:51:00,739 --> 01:51:02,206
They'll be along presently.

1385
01:51:02,274 --> 01:51:04,538
Let me look at you.

1386
01:51:06,645 --> 01:51:09,773
Don't l look like a married man
and the head of a family?

1387
01:51:10,516 --> 01:51:15,920
Not a bit, and you never will, although
you have grown bigger and bonnier.

1388
01:51:16,589 --> 01:51:20,889
But you're the same scapegrace as ever,
despite that very elegant mustache.

1389
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:25,329
-You can't fool me.
-You have to treat me with more respect.

1390
01:51:28,701 --> 01:51:33,832
Jo, dear, l want to say one thing,
then we'll put it by forever.

1391
01:51:34,006 --> 01:51:36,270
No, Laurie, please.

1392
01:51:37,543 --> 01:51:42,037
l think it was always meant to be,
you and Amy.

1393
01:51:43,082 --> 01:51:46,108
lt would have come about naturally
if only you'd waited.

1394
01:51:46,819 --> 01:51:48,878
As you tried to make me understand.

1395
01:51:49,521 --> 01:51:51,284
But you never could be patient.

1396
01:51:54,259 --> 01:51:57,751
So then we can go back
to the happy old times?

1397
01:51:57,830 --> 01:52:00,799
The way you wanted it,
when we first knew one another.

1398
01:52:04,503 --> 01:52:07,700
We never can be boy and girl again, Laurie.

1399
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:11,102
Those happy old times can't come back.

1400
01:52:12,311 --> 01:52:14,074
We shouldn't expect them to.

1401
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:18,977
We're man and woman now,
we can't be playmates any longer.

1402
01:52:20,552 --> 01:52:25,512
But we can be brother and sister,
to love and help one another...

1403
01:52:25,824 --> 01:52:28,918
...all the rest of our lives, can't we, Laurie?

1404
01:52:33,866 --> 01:52:35,299
There they are.

1405
01:52:35,668 --> 01:52:37,329
You look very well, Aunt March.

1406
01:52:37,403 --> 01:52:40,895
After the money spent on my rheumatism,
l come home on a day like this.

1407
01:52:41,073 --> 01:52:44,474
Heaven's to Betsy. lf she ain't dressed
in silk from head to foot.

1408
01:52:44,777 --> 01:52:47,371
Where is she? Where is Jo?

1409
01:52:49,348 --> 01:52:51,543
-Jo!
-Amy!

1410
01:52:51,684 --> 01:52:53,379
Doesn't she look marvelous, Jo?

1411
01:53:03,128 --> 01:53:06,427
l'll never forgive myself
for staying away so long...

1412
01:53:06,532 --> 01:53:09,968
...and leaving you
to bear everything all alone.

1413
01:53:10,269 --> 01:53:11,531
Darling.

1414
01:53:14,406 --> 01:53:19,036
To think that only yesterday we were
pulling our hair and buttoning pinafores.

1415
01:53:19,111 --> 01:53:22,478
And now she's a grown-up married lady
with a bustle.

1416
01:53:28,954 --> 01:53:31,582
You must be famished.
l'll help Hannah with the tea.

1417
01:53:31,657 --> 01:53:35,855
No, you won't, Marmee.
You'll sit right here. l'll help Hannah.

1418
01:53:43,435 --> 01:53:47,337
lt's fun, isn't it, Bethie?
Now that we're all together again.

1419
01:53:50,576 --> 01:53:53,977
Oh, dear. l've got to get some milk.
l haven't enough for my babies.

1420
01:53:54,046 --> 01:53:54,808
l'll go.

1421
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,508
-But it's raining cats and dogs.
-l love it.

1422
01:53:57,716 --> 01:54:00,708
Sakes alive! There's the front doorbell.

1423
01:54:09,027 --> 01:54:11,825
-ls this the residence of Miss March?
-Why, yes.

1424
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:13,488
-Miss Josephine March?
-Yes.

1425
01:54:13,766 --> 01:54:15,199
May l speak with her?

1426
01:54:15,267 --> 01:54:18,134
She's out,
but l'm expecting her back any minute.

1427
01:54:18,203 --> 01:54:20,194
-Won't you come in?
-Thank you.

1428
01:54:21,173 --> 01:54:23,869
No, thank you. She has guests, no.

1429
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:26,171
Thank you very much.

1430
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:33,115
But will you please give this to her
and tell her Professor Bhaer left it?

1431
01:54:33,919 --> 01:54:34,851
Thank you.

1432
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:37,318
Professor Bhaer. Thank you very much.

1433
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:41,191
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1434
01:54:59,678 --> 01:55:02,010
-<i>Herr</i> Professor.
-My little friend.

1435
01:55:03,015 --> 01:55:05,245
l was just here to leave your book.

1436
01:55:05,617 --> 01:55:09,314
l wanted to tell you my friend published it,
and he has great hopes.

1437
01:55:09,488 --> 01:55:11,513
-He thinks--
-Never mind what he thinks.

1438
01:55:11,590 --> 01:55:12,682
Did you like it?

1439
01:55:12,758 --> 01:55:17,218
My little friend, it has such truth,
such simple beauty.

1440
01:55:17,296 --> 01:55:21,562
ln English quick,
l cannot tell you what it gives my heart.

1441
01:55:21,633 --> 01:55:23,760
But you were going without telling me.

1442
01:55:23,836 --> 01:55:26,634
lf l hadn't come back,
l never would've seen you again.

1443
01:55:27,039 --> 01:55:30,167
-Come, you're getting wet.
-l couldn't intrude. You have guests.

1444
01:55:30,242 --> 01:55:31,709
No, only my family.

1445
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:33,468
My sister has just come home.

1446
01:55:33,545 --> 01:55:36,070
She is married to that boy l told you about.

1447
01:55:36,248 --> 01:55:38,182
-<i>Herr</i> Laurie?
-Yes.

1448
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:41,276
This is the first time
we've all been together for a long time.

1449
01:55:41,353 --> 01:55:43,150
Please, just one moment before....

1450
01:55:43,222 --> 01:55:45,156
l had a wish to ask you something.

1451
01:55:45,858 --> 01:55:46,847
Would you....

1452
01:55:49,127 --> 01:55:51,220
l have no courage to think that....

1453
01:55:51,964 --> 01:55:54,398
But could l dare hope that....

1454
01:55:56,034 --> 01:55:59,333
l know l shouldn't make so free as to ask.

1455
01:56:01,106 --> 01:56:06,100
l have nothing to give but my heart so full
and these empty hands.

1456
01:56:08,013 --> 01:56:10,277
Not empty now.

1457
01:56:11,583 --> 01:56:13,346
Heart's dearest!

1458
01:56:21,827 --> 01:56:23,294
Welcome home.
