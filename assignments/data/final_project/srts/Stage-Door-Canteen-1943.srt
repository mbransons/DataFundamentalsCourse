00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,390
We only went over to Roseland
 for a couple of dances,

165
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,590
and then the
 [INAUDIBLE] for a bite.

166
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,490
I was in by two o'clock.

167
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,300
-I know, dear.

168
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,960
But these rules are
 made for a good reason.

169
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,260
And we've got to be
 strict with violations.

170
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,620
-I won't do it again.

171
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,110
-I'm afraid you won't
 have an opportunity.

172
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,360
Because I've got to
 pick up your pass.

173
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,240
-Does-- does that
 mean I won't be able

174
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
to come down here
 and help anymore?

175
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,620
-Yes.

176
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,910
I'm afraid it means just that.

177
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,770
-Oh please, Ms. Royal.

178
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,480
You're one of the
 co-chairmen of the canteen.

179
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,070
Couldn't you please speak
 to Ms. Cowell about it?

180
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,300
Can I have another chance?

181
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,880
Makes me feel like I'm
 doing something to help.

182
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,280
And, because just like the
 boys who come down here,

183
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,810
no matter how blue I
 am, I get cheered up.

184
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,530
-I know just how you feel, dear.

185
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:36,350
But, well, there's
 nothing I can do about it.

186
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,090
I've got to pick up your pass.

187
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,680
LILLIAN: It was just
 that he was so homesick.

188
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,820
-You know [INAUDIBLE]?

189
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,770
I'll bet my folks would just
 about swoon if they knew

190
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,710
I was entertaining Yankee
 soldiers night after night.

191
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,830
--[INAUDIBLE], you
 got Alabama dripping

192
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,900
from those pretty lips of yours.

193
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,800
I can hear it from here.

194
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,520
-Well, I declare, a
 southern gentleman

195
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,370
amongst all these Yankees.

196
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,020
-Hello.

197
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,830
-Hey, kids, hurry up.

198
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,590
We're going to be late.

199
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,330
-Uh, my name's Ella Sue.

200
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,520
I'll see you later.

201
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,770
-I sure hope some of the
 big stars and producers

202
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,800
are here tonight.

203
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,600
-Oh, they all come down
 one time or another.

204
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,950
Every night there's
 a different shift.

205
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,400
Come on, Ella Sue.

206
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,670
-I think I'm going to like this.

207
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,130
I just hope the place
 isn't too fancy.

208
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,480
Do you think those
 girls are actresses?

209
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,450
-Well, they're pretty enough.

210
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,880
-Thanks, fellows.

211
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,400
Your passes, [INAUDIBLE]
 identification, OK.

212
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,930
-Here, food chip.

213
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,080
-Dog tags, fellows, please.

214
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,060
-Did you hear?

215
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,760
-Hear what?

216
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,450
-About Lillian.

217
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,940
They picked up her card.

218
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,880
-Oh, then she did go out
 with that kid from Iowa.

219
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,580
-Hello, Peggy.

220
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,330
-Hello.

221
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,030
-Hello, Anne.

222
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,950
How are you?

223
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,650
-Hello.

224
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,980
-Hello, Vera.

225
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,380
-Hello, dear.

226
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,710
-Vera, this is our
 roommate, Eileen Burke.

227
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,420
It's her first night
 at the canteen.

228
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,690
-Hello, Eileen.

229
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,750
Hang your coat over there, and
 pick up your apron over here.

230
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,940
And I hope your feet hold out.

231
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,230
-Thank you.

232
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,940
-Eileen, if you forget
 any of the rules,

233
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,430
just ask Ella Sue or me.

234
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,890
-And suppose I meet a wolf?

235
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,570
-They won't make any
 passes at you honey.

236
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,690
All you've got to do is just be
 fun, but in a cute sort of way.

237
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,390
-Hmm.

238
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,610
Soldiers and sailors on
 leave want something more

239
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,010
than somebody to talk to.

240
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,320
Hey, didn't I see your boss
 cleaning tables out there?

241
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,020
-Mr. Pemberton?

242
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,730
Yes.

243
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,190
Why?

244
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,290
-How's for an introduction.

245
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,090
He's casting a new
 play, isn't he?

246
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,090
-Now let's skip that
 career for tonight, cutie.

247
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,470
You're here to show
 the boys a good time.

248
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,480
And Mr. Pemberton isn't
 here as a producer.

249
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,170
He's here to keep
 the tables clean.

250
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,340
-Why couldn't I help him
 clean up a table or two?

251
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,940
Give me a chance to show
 him my press clippings.

252
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,750
-Oh, Eileen, forget yourself.

253
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,410
You just wait.

254
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,130
You'll find it
 gets in your blood.

255
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,130
I've taken to counting
 soldiers instead

256
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,830
of sheep to put me to sleep.

257
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,000
-What I'm wondering
 is how I'm going

258
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,610
to say yes and no to that
 southern boy at the same time.

259
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,770
-Ed Wynn, gee, we didn't
 expect to see you here.

260
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,280
-Oh, nobody did.

261
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,630
As a matter of fact, when I
 told those boys [INAUDIBLE]

262
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,470
I mean the biggest dignitaries
 in the moving picture business,

263
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,330
when I told them that
 I was coming here,

264
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,890
I walked into their room,
 they got right on their knees.

265
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,090
What a reception.

266
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,060
What a tribute.

267
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,590
What a crap game.

268
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,690
[LAUGHTER]

269
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,100
-My goodness.

270
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,790
[INAUDIBLE]

271
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,320
Oh, you're in the Navy.

272
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,070
I can see that.

273
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,690
Here you are.

274
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,330
A male [INAUDIBLE],
 for heaven's sake.

275
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,780
First one I ever saw.

276
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,430
Check your hat?

277
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,430
[INAUDIBLE]

278
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,910
-Hey, Dakota, isn't that Alan
 Mowbray emptying ash trays?

279
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,910
-Yeah.

280
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,940
Imagine Alan Mowbray having
 to get a job as a busboy.

281
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,070
I thought he was doing
 all right in pictures.

282
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,590
-I say, old boy,
 jolly party, isn't it?

283
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,290
-What did you say?

284
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,590
-A jolly party, isn't it?

285
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,810
-Foreigner.

286
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,640
-Say, George, you've been
 having a lot of rainy weather

287
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,700
out in California
 lately, haven't you?

288
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,210
-Oh, I wouldn't say that, Bill.

289
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,170
Just two feet of dew.

290
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,420
-Two feet of dew.

291
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,400
-Here you are, [INAUDIBLE].

292
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,840
-OK, George.

293
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
-Say George, tell me.

294
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,880
You've been taking
 a lot of fighters

295
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,220
around to the Army camps for
 the entertainment of the boys.

296
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,010
What's the greatest fighter
 that you've ever seen?

297
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,800
-Pound for pound,
 Henry Armstrong.

298
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,140
He's the only fighter
 that held three

299
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,900
world's titles at the same time.

300
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,380
-You're right there.

301
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,480
How about these
 Brooklyn Dodgers.

302
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,870
You're always rooting
 for the Dodgers.

303
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,960
Think Brooklyn's going to
 win the pennant this year?

304
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,980
-Well, I wouldn't know
 anything about that.

305
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,500
But I know one team
 that can't lose.

306
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,570
-Whose is that?

307
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,650
-That team there.

308
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,850
-How much for a ham
 sandwich, please?

309
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,790
-There's no charge.

310
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,080
-Not for the chocolate
 cake, either?

311
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,780
-No.

312
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,500
Here's some with icing.

313
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,080
-It's been a long time.

314
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,170
Are those oranges for us, ma'am?

315
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,130
-Of course they are.

316
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,900
-I haven't seen
 one in two years.

317
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,800
Blimey.

318
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,250
It's just like
 Christmas, ain't it?

319
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,700
Just like Christmas.

320
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,580
-Thank you.

321
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,550
-You're welcome.

322
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,110
-You're Katharine
 Cornell, aren't you?

323
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,260
-Yes, how'd you know?

324
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,840
-Oh, our dramatic coach at
 school has your picture.

325
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,750
He said we hadn't lived until
 we'd seen you play Juliet.

326
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,430
See, we put it on.

327
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,300
And I was Romeo.

328
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,000
-You were?

329
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,390
What scene did you like best?

330
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,660
-You where Romeo
 swears by the moonbeam?

331
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,410
Lady, by yonder
 blessed moon, I swear,

332
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,470
that tips with silver all
 these fruit-tree tops--

333
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,760
-Oh swear not by the
 moon, the inconstant moon

334
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,860
the monthly changes
 in her circled orb,

335
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,520
lest that thy love
 prove likewise variable.

336
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,310
-What shall I swear by?

337
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,310
-Do not swear at all.

338
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,380
Or if thou wilt, swear
 by thy gracious self,

339
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,470
which is the god of my idolatry.

340
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,670
And I'll believe thee.

341
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,140
-If my heart's dear love--

342
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,830
-Well, do not swear.

343
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,940
Though I joy in thee, I have no
 joy in this contract tonight.

344
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,330
It is too rash, too
 unadvised, to sudden,

345
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,580
too like the lightning that has
 ceased to be ere one can say it

346
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,990
lightens.

347
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,150
Sweet, good night.

348
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,630
Parting is such
 sweet sorrow that I

349
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,740
shall say goodnight
 til it be morrow.

350
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,490
-Hey, what's
 holding up the line.

351
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,310
-A little unrationed
 ham being served.

352
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,880
For holding up the works, Romeo.

353
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,020
-I'll never eat
 this orange, Juliet.

354
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,510
I'll just keep it to remember.

355
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,990
-Any of you guys seen a
 little bit of Alabama sugar?

356
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,980
-You come along with me
 to a table, southern boy.

357
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,480
I want you all to myself.

358
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,780
-I'm sure you boys
 will pardon my absence.

359
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,440
-Hello.

360
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,140
-Hello.

361
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,290
-Are you going to be my girl?

362
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,800
-Why yes, I'll be your
 girl while you're here.

363
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,370
What's your name.

364
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,810
-Well, the fellows
 call me California.

365
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,340
But my real name is Jack Gilman.

366
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,520
-I like California best.

367
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,390
My name is Tina.

368
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,090
-How old are you?

369
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,630
-Oh, I'm not telling.

370
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,310
-Go on, please.

371
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,010
It's important.

372
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,820
-You name it, California.

373
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,770
-You're 18.

374
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,840
-Oh, gee, thanks.

375
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,940
You want me to hold your hand
 while you drink your milk?

376
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,890
-You got nothing to
 worry about, Eileen.

377
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,380
They're all gents or bashful.

378
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,460
See that tough Sergeant,
 I bumped into him.

379
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,290
And I said, what do you do?

380
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,210
And he said I'm a chorus girl
 in the Irving Berlin show.

381
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,710
--[LAUGHING] You give me lots
 of assurance, Mr. Demarest.

382
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,400
-Where do you get that
 Mr. Demarest stuff?

383
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,930
You know my name is Bill.

384
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,200
Don't be so nervous.

385
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,350
You act like this was
 a first night opening.

386
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,160
Take it easy.

387
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,540
-Hello, Eileen.

388
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,340
-Well, hello, Ms. Scott.

389
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,130
-Well, how nice to see you.

390
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,710
What have you been doing
 since the play closed?

391
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,970
-Well, nothing yet.

392
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,380
But I have prospects.

393
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,280
-Well, this is your first
 night at the canteen, isn't it?

394
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,980
-Yes.

395
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,470
Are you one of the hostesses?

396
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,180
-Mhmm.

397
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,080
-I don't know how to start.

398
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,520
I've, I've got kind
 of a sinking feeling.

399
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,750
-Well, if you're
 going to sink, Miss,

400
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,650
you might pick this
 chair right here.

401
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,750
-There's your answer, Eileen.

402
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,390
See you later.

403
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,460
-Please, I saved it for you.

404
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,040
Can I get you something to eat?

405
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,900
-No thanks.

406
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,810
We can't eat the food here.

407
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,900
-What's the matter with it?

408
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,610
It looks mighty good to m.

409
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,530
-It's a rule.

410
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,920
It was donated for
 you to eat, not us.

411
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,410
-Where do you live.

412
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,580
-That's another rule.

413
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,070
Even if I wanted to,
 I couldn't tell you.

414
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,640
-Sort of a civilian secret, huh?

415
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,440
Look, my name's Ed Smith.

416
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,140
And we're going to--

417
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,210
-Oh, that's another rule against
 telling us where you're going.

418
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,900
-You get me wrong.

419
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,350
I don't know where I'm going.

420
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,180
I was just going to say--

421
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,400
-Oh, first we're supposed to
 ask you where you're from.

422
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,330
-Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

423
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,240
-Then I think we're
 supposed to ask

424
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,890
to see your
 sweetheart's picture.

425
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,390
And we talk about
 how nice she is.

426
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,950
-I haven't got a sweetheart.

427
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,890
I'm sort of between girls.

428
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,770
-Why Walter Winchell
 had it that Ed Smith

429
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,610
and the belle of Sioux
 Falls were sizzling.

430
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,440
-Well, I guess we
 sizzle some at that.

431
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,770
-I'll never forget.

432
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,400
When the last war
 was over, my captain

433
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,580
paid me the swellest compliment.

434
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,860
He said, Private Kennedy,
 you are now and always

435
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,230
will be the perfect non-entity.

436
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,540
He always thought a lot of me.

437
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,710
-Hey Ed, didn't you start your
 stage career in Vaudeville?

438
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,410
-Oh sure.

439
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,730
I came from a famous
 Vaudeville family.

440
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,230
My uncle with Rajah,
 Rajah and his Lions.

441
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,790
Did you ever see that act?

442
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,210
15 years my uncle
 was in Vaudeville.

443
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,140
He used to open
 the lion's mouth,

444
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,360
and put his whole head
 right in the lion's mouth.

445
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,260
But one day the darnedest
 thing happened-- [LAUGHING].

446
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,100
And-- hello, uncle.

447
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,470
[LAUGHTER]

448
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,140
[CHEERING]

449
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,260
-Listen, everybody.

450
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,050
This is Bert Lytell, your MC.

451
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,440
Fellows, I'm only
 home for 10 seconds

452
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,780
to make an announcement.

453
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,220
You've heard it said that you
 can't get blood out of a stone.

454
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,280
Well, you can't get it out
 of our next guest, either.

455
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,160
Charlie McCarthy
 and Edgar Bergen.

456
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,570
[APPLAUSE]

457
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,950
EDGAR BERGEN: Good evening,
 ladies and gentleman.

458
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,280
I bring you greetings
 from the mystic East.

459
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,840
And now with your
 kind indulgence,

460
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,180
I shall delve into the mysteries
 of supernatural and the occult.

461
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,990
-Hey Bergen?

462
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,840
-Yeah?

463
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,390
-Well, uh, what's the racket?

464
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,090
-Racket?

465
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,790
-Yeah.

466
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,240
-Young man, I
 happen to be gifted.

467
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,060
-Say not so.

468
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,350
-Yes, indeed.

469
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,160
-I'll be darned.

470
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,040
-I'm a student of occultism.

471
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,170
-Of occult-usm?

472
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:45,970
-No, not tusm.

473
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,560
-No?

474
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:46,880
-No.

475
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,580
-What?

476
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,150
-Ism, ism, ism.

477
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,130
-Ism what?

478
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,130
-Aw.

479
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,620
[LAUGHTER]

480
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,250
-I am the seventh son of the
 seventh son of the seventh son.

481
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,490
-Well come on, seven.

482
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,090
Do something.

483
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,410
Well, what, what's the,
 what's the globule for?

484

-Well, you see it helps
 me to focus my attention.

 insurance anyway.

-It's a word from the Bible.

1447
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,030
It's beautiful.

1448
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:21,630
It means the Lord
 watches between me

and thee while we are
 absent one from another.

-Who walked out on who?

I had to talk to a soldier
 who was going to have a baby.

The way you two

think he was General MacArthur.

01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,590
You've certainly been
 showing a mighty lack

1540

-Did you know Dakota
 turned out Sergeant stripes

1542
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,680
just so he could
 stick with his pals?

1543
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,920
No, he's not General
 MacArthur, but the boys

1544
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,910
swear by him just the same.

-Dakota's a sweet boy, a lot
 sweeter than he gets treated.

-He gets back what he gives out.

1547
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,910
-Ever occur to you that if you
 gave out with something nice,

1548
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:58,150
that's what you'd get back?

1549

-I sure do like the taste
 of this new toothpaste.

Now I'm going to read
 my mail in comfort.

Texas says he feels out of place
 [INAUDIBLE] canteen, Jeanne.

1553
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,690
He wishes we could have
 been back down South

1554
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:18,500
under a little
 old magnolia tree.

1555
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,130
I kind of wish the same thing.

1556
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:22,220

 had kissed me

1559

tonight when nobody was looking.

1560
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:30,910
I left myself wide open.

1561
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:33,050
I kept think they'll
 sail away without anybody

1562

1563
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,690
And it would be my fault, too.

1564
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:40,090
I was sort of his last chance.

1565

-Here's letter for you,
 Jeanne, mixed up in mine.

1566
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,240
It looks like it's
 from your brother.

1567
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,860
-Oh, Marine Corps, it is!

1568
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,130
-That cute, handsome,
 [INAUDIBLE].

1569
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:53,660
Does he know Mary's
 had her baby?

1570
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,350
-Mhmm.

1571
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:55,050
Mary wrote him.

1572
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:55,990
The letter's on its way.

1573
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:56,690
It's a boy.

1574
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,090
-What's the matter?

1575
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:07,150
Something wrong?

1576
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:12,370
-No, but, just listen to this.

1577
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:16,590
Dear sis, I'm still waiting to
 hear from Mary about whether we

1578
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:19,950
have a son or a
 daughter or both.

1579
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,370
By the time you receive
 this, you and the folks

1580
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:24,740
may have read about
 us in the newspapers.

1581
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,400
You know how censorship is.

1582
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,770
I just want you to know, sis,
 that I'm not afraid of anything

1583
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:35,540
that may be ahead, and
 assure you that we are all

1584
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:40,700
anxious to do our utmost in
 any engagement we might have.

1585
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,410
We know our weapons
 and equipment

1586
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:44,060
are superior to theirs.

1587
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:47,920
And in addition, each one of
 us knows that man for man,

1588
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,640
a Marine can out-shoot,
 out-bayonet, outlast,

1589
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,870
and if necessary kill
 any blankety-blank Jap

1590
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:57,680
he has seen so far
 with his bare hands.

1591
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:01,280
They can talk all they want
 about the Japs' jiujitsu.

1592
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,180
But a Marine will tell
 you it doesn't work

1593
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:06,460
against a roundhouse
 right to the jaw.

1594
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:11,720
Though neither I nor none of
 you have mentioned it before,

1595
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,570
there's naturally
 a chance that I

1596
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,520
may not come back from this war.

1597
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,730
And of course I still
 don't think folks

1598
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:24,180
or Mary should be
 reminded of it.

1599
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,860
However, sis, I'd like
 you, more than anyone,

1600
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:29,120
to know my feelings.

1601
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,990
Dad and mom always
 did everything

1602
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:33,370
a son could wish for.

1603
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:35,760
You've been the perfect sister.

1604
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,070
And I certainly consider myself
 the luckiest man in the world

1605
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:41,670
in having Mary for my wife.

1606
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:44,160
Certainly no one in
 this world has a greater

1607
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:47,220
claim to happiness than I have.

1608
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:49,000
I remember what dad
 said when we all

1609
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,220
had dinner before I shoved off.

1610
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,770
He said that other
 things may not matter,

1611
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:56,110
but that I could never
 live down a failure

1612
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,910
in my country's service.

1613
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:01,860
And I won't fail dad,
 whatever happens.

1614
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:06,880
Just as I remember always how
 lucky I am to have a kid sister

1615
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,770
like you.

1616
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:12,660
Bill.

1617
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:15,340
-He'll come back, honey.

1618
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,030
-I know.

1619
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:20,960
But I'll say my
 prayers just the same.

1620
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:29,000
Kind of gets you, though,
 kids like Bill and California,

1621
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,200
Dakota, and Texas.

1622
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,270
-I guess this is as
 good a time as any

1623
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:38,890
to realize what
 a heel I've been.

1624
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,920
Good night, kids.

1625
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,630
-Goodnight, honey.

1626
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:48,520
-Night, Ella Sue.

1627
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,500
-Night, y'all.

1628
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:01,330
-Roll out, men.

1629
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:02,420
On your feet, Tex.

1630
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,250
Nobody ever won a medal in bed.

1631
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,660
-Anybody ever did it
 would be little old me.

1632
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,820
-Gee, do you guys realize my
 Mamie is only a couple of miles

1633
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:11,640
away?

1634
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,600
-Uh, mister?

1635
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,590
Come here.

1636
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:18,780
Um, you know Jersey Wallace?

1637
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:19,820
-No, ma'am.

1638
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,210
-We're going to get
 married this morning

1639
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:22,380
if he doesn't have
 to go someplace.

1640
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,840
-We've been going
 together two years.

1641
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,380
So his captain
 gave him permission

1642
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:26,750
[INAUDIBLE] you know.

1643
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:27,600
-Yes, miss.

1644
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,300
I know.

1645
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,250
I hope you make it.

1646
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,940
-Jersey and me figured
 if it means we'll only

1647
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,720
have the net 24 hours
 together as man and wife,

1648
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,250
it'll be worth it.

1649
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,710
It's too bad you
 don't know Jersey.

1650
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,210
You'd be crazy about
 him, like I am.

1651
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,520
You ought to read the
 beautiful letters he writes me.

1652
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,740
I carry them with
 me every place.

1653
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,280
I like to read them over
 while I eat my lunch.

1654
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,650
Oh, the suspense is killing me.

1655
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:50,340
JERSEY: Hey, Mamie, we're in!

1656

1657
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,230
Aww gee, honey.

1658
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,440
We've got another
 24 hours, baby.

1659
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,140
Meet my best men.

1660
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:57,840
This is Dakota.

01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,040
This is Texas.

-Hello.

1664
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:02,170
-Well, you're right
 pretty for a Yankee.

-[INAUDIBLE].

01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,460
Oh, here's California.

1667
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,290
He'll be your bridesmaid.

1668
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:07,030
-Hello, Mamie.

1669
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:08,030
-Oh gee, Jersey.

1670
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,540
Being married to you is going
 to be the most wonderful

1671
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,060
thing that ever happened to me.

1672
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,560
-Did you pick out
 a marriage chapel?

1673
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,260
-Yeah.

1674
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,040
I got this one.

1675
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,860
We'll get everything
 for $10, including

1676
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,030
the fellow who plays the organ.

1677
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:18,340
-Oh gee.

1678
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:18,920
That's swell.

1679
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,620
Come on, guys.

1680
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,080
Let's go.

together after God's

until the old canteen opens?

-I'm not going to
 the canteen tonight.

-What else you guys want to do?

1725
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:32,850
-Let's bowl.

1726
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:34,750
-Oh, I'd rather go back
 to the canteen, Dakota.

1727
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:36,630
-Well, you run along
 with Tex, then.

1728
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:37,810
-No, I'll stick with you.

-Aw, who wants to bowl?

1730

Besides, we don't
 need the exercise.

1731
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:42,920
We're getting plenty of
 it where we're going.

1732
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,400
I'll take in the
 canteen tonight.

1733
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,500
See you guys later.

1734

-I wonder if Jeanne
 will be there tonight.

1735
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,280
-OK, kid.

1736
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,370
We'll bowl this
 afternoon, and go back

1737
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:56,170
to the canteen tonight
 for another fling.

1738

 you, Eileen, but I'm not.

You deserve it.

01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:03,380
You read the lines beautifully.

1742
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,110
-Thank you.

1743
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,370
-Congratulations.

-So long.

1749
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:12,930
And thanks.

01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:13,810
It's funny.

This is the day I've
 been waiting for.

But somehow I'm, I'm not
 getting the kick out of it

1753

that I thought I would.

You're still thinking
 of Dakota, aren't you?

01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:25,860
Oh, come on.

1757
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:26,800
Forget it.

1758
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,190
He's, he's probably
 forgotten you by now.

1759
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:30,510

 of shoulder, I'm

1921
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,190
not interested in your
 reaction, or in the bareness

1934
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:29,930
Well, up with a
 few years ago, it

1935
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:33,740
was New York's second
 largest industry.

1936
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:36,640
Now a fan dancer's
 education requires

1937
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,560
years of concentration.

1938
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,900
And for the sake of
 explanation, take a look at me.

1939
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:45,580
I began at the age of
 three, learning ballet

1940
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:48,750
at the Royal Imperial
 School in Moscow.

1941
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,480
Oh, I suffered and
 suffered for my art.

1942
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:54,390
Then of course, sweet briar.

Oh dear college days.

1944
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:03,580
And after four years of
 psychology, zoology, biology,

1945
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:08,110
and anthropology, my
 education was complete.

1946
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:10,800
And I was ready to make
 my professional debut

1947
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,130
for the Minsky's on 14th Street.

1948
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:19,260
Now the things that go
 in a fan dancer's mind

1949
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,360
would give you no
 end of surprise.

But if you're
 psychologically inclined,

there's more to see
 than meets the eyes.
