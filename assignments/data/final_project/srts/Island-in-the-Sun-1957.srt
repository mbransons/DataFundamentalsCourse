1
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:06,709
But behave as though
nothing had happened.

2
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:10,150
- Lunch is ready, ma'am.
- Thank you, Mary.

3
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,398
Congratulations.

4
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:33,909
That was a fine series of articles,
the best things I've read about the island.

5
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:36,445
As for that one today,
that was- that was the goods.

6
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:38,447
You said things
that needed saying.

7
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,178
From my point of view,
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

8
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:44,652
- In what way?
- In every way.

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,058
I've not been trusted.
The people here, West Indian...

10
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,687
they thought of me as a Fleury, a feudal planter,
bought their ancestors in the marketplace.

11
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:57,257
But now? I'm standing for the legislature.
Why not?

12
00:00:57,368 --> 00:01:02,431
I combine black and white, the new and the old.
I've a foot in both camps.

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,599
And your article gave me
the guts that I needed.

14
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,509
- What'll it be, gentlemen?
- Rum and, uh, ginger. Two of them.

15
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:10,513
Just water.

16
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:13,743
I didn't see this before. But now I can
look out at those faces and I can say to them...

17
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:16,752
"My grandmother was
of African ancestry.

18
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:19,379
She came over in a slave trader
just as yours did."

19
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,051
Yes, I can say to them,
"I'm one of you now."

20
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:28,924
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

21
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:01,860
- Hello.
- I want to talk to you.

22
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:05,728
You do?
Who the devil are you?

23
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:08,134
Fleury, Maxwell Fleury.

24
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,174
Ah. Oh, so you are.

25
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:14,301
What do you want to do?
Make a contribution to the Belfontaine Fund?

26
00:02:14,412 --> 00:02:16,778
- What?
- The fund-The Belfontaine Fund.

27
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:18,906
I want to talk to you... alone.

28
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:21,177
There's something that needs
settling between us.

29
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:25,654
I can't think what.
Anyway, whatever it is, let's do it inside.

30
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:54,408
- Are you expecting a girl?
- A girl? What would I want with a girl?

31
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:02,891
<i>Excuse me.</i>

32
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:09,194
Shall we go in here?

33
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:19,074
- Make you a whiskey?
- No.

34
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:25,307
No, I don't believe in chaps
drinking themselves to death.

35
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,850
Leave that for retired colonels.

36
00:03:27,952 --> 00:03:29,852
Remember that song?

37
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:46,464
You know, I was once married, Fleury.

38
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,334
It was in hospital
in Tripoli during the war.

39
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,931
My wife fell in love
with a Polish musician...

40
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:54,909
and thought that the best thing
for both of us was a quick divorce.

41
00:03:55,012 --> 00:04:00,279
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Mean? Nothing. It's just a fact.

42
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,320
A second chance-That's what a man needs,
a blasted second chance.

43
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,791
Well, what was it needed settling?

44
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:12,420
- I want you to leave my wife alone.
- Your wife?

45
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,828
I'm not a fool. The trouble is
you weren't smart enough.

46
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:18,095
- The whole place stank of those fancy cigarettes of yours!
- Are you out of your mind?

47
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:21,069
I've had as much as I can take from you
and this island. Do you understand?

48
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:23,470
- Stay away from my wife.
- Look here. I'm fed up with idiots.

49
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:26,202
- Are you suggesting I've been making passes-
- I'm not suggesting anything.

50
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,211
- I'm just telling you.
- Then you can ruddy-well untell it and apologize.

51
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:31,679
And get this into your stupid skull.

52
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:35,240
I don't make passes at wives
of acquaintances, and I don't share my women.

53
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:38,913
And even if I did, I wouldn't take something
from someone like you...

54
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:41,423
with a tarbrush rubbed across his face.

55
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:48,129
Tarbrush! I'll show all of you!

56
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:51,565
Tarbrush! Tarbrush!

57
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:58,338
Tarbrush! Tarbrush!

58
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:19,329
Carson?

59
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:27,603
Carson.

60
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,889
<i>- I suppose there's no doubt
about it being murder?</i>

61
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,363
No, not the slightest.

62
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:45,902
- Anyone in England to whom we can send a cable?
- Not that I know of, sir.

63
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:48,528
<i>Uh, we could, of course,
put a notice in the Times.</i>

64
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,607
Yes. That's the least we can do.

65
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:54,043
Was there a woman in the case,
do you think?

66
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:59,908
- Politics?
- No.

67
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,917
A thief, then.

68
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:08,181
All right, that's your affair.
I won't meddle.

69
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:12,388
It seems a bit sad, though,
a chap's life ending like that.

70
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:15,329
You'll see to it, won't you,
that he's put under with full military honors?

71
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:17,332
- Of course, sir.
- That will be all, sir?

72
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,334
Yes, that's all.

73
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:24,106
Good-bye, Colonel.

74
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:31,676
I suppose this business of Bradshaw's article
is all over Jamestown.

75
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:34,273
- That and Carson's death.
- Yes, sir.

76
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:38,553
- What's your opinion, Denis?
- About what, sir?

77
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:41,453
Having the wrong
sort of grandmother.

78
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:45,688
Well, um, it's difficult to
pick one's ancestors, sir.

79
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:48,788
Yes. It is, isn't it?

80
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,027
Send a girl in, will you?
I want to dictate a note to Whitehall.

81
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,970
Right, sir.

82
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:01,567
The governor has some dictation.
Would you go in to him?

83
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:08,108
I finished the letter to London.
Is it all right?

84
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,852
I've never known
anyone like you.

85
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:16,551
I never suspected
there could be anything like this.

86
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,963
You're not wearing it.

87
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:23,032
Well, should I?
Here, in the office?

88
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,067
Wear it.

89
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:30,972
Here. Let me.

90
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:41,283
You didn't look at the letter.

91
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:45,048
The letter? It's perfect.

92
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:28,257
Jocelyn, I've got the car.
Would you like to come for a drive?

93
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:31,198
Why don't you, Jocelyn?
We'll go on alone.

94
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:36,034
Well, I- I have to go past the house
and change my clothes.

95
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,039
All right.

96
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:48,112
- Hello, Colonel.
- Hello.

97
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:50,118
Mr. Bradshaw.

98
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:54,215
Appalling thing. Carson.

99
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,523
He and I were quite good friends.

100
00:11:57,628 --> 00:11:59,596
I can't understand how it happened.

101
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,792
Is there anyone you suspect, Colonel Whittingham?

102
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,097
Now, Mrs. Fleury, you know policemen.
They suspect everybody.

103
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,138
What time did it happen?

104
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,366
The coroner puts it
at about 10:00.

105
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:15,343
That's odd.
I went to the club after I left Father's.

106
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:18,505
I was worrying about Bradshaw's article,
how they'd take it.

107
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:21,106
I may have passed Carson's house,
at the very moment-

108
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:24,085
How awful. You might
have saved his life.

109
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:27,645
A few minutes earlier, I might have met him
in the street. We'd have stopped and talked.

110
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:31,319
He'd have asked me in for a drink,
and then we'd have found this-

111
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:34,090
- I suppose it was a thief.
- Quite likely.

112
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:36,995
Maxwell, on your way to the club,
Bradshaw mentioned the time...

113
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,228
and it occurred to me that you might have
passed Carson's house.

114
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,305
Uh, did you see anybody
hanging about outside?

115
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:44,636
See anybody? No.

116
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:47,471
There was a car
that drove by afterward.

117
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:50,045
Afterward? After what?

118
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:52,206
After I passed Carson's house.

119
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:55,513
I'm sorry I can't be of more help, Colonel.

120
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:57,849
- Do you think she'll care, Colonel?
- Who?

121
00:12:57,954 --> 00:13:00,286
The ex-Mrs. Carson.
He was very much in love with her, you know.

122
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,290
I couldn't say.

123
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:05,555
- Poor man. He came out here with such high hopes.
- Mmm.

124
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:09,428
Well, a chap can't pick the way he'll die,
or we'd all do better at it.

125
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,433
Good-bye, Colonel.

126
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:32,017
- Here, Colonel, sir.
- Right. Out you get.

127
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:35,717
I steal nothing, Colonel, sir.
I find purse in cane field.

128
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:39,262
No money in purse. I keep purse.
Why not keep purse, Colonel, sir?

129
00:13:39,363 --> 00:13:41,263
Now, don't fuss.
Nobody's blaming you.

130
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:44,334
You just show me where you found that purse,
then you can go home.

131
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:55,477
What? No further than that?

132
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:57,979
No, Colonel, sir.
I found purse right here.

133
00:13:58,081 --> 00:13:59,981
Right.

134
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:04,853
All right. Bring it back.

135
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:10,725
All right. Start it up.

136
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:15,289
No, no. You stay there.

137
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:48,396
Okay. Back you get.

138
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,332
Drive him to his village.

139
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,136
Here. This'll make up
for the day's work you lost.

140
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,503
- Thank you, sir.
- Everything okay, Colonel, sir?

141
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,512
Fine.

142
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,620
Three.

143
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:15,623
- Oh, hello, Maxwell.
- Hello, Mavis.

144
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:18,091
Hello, darling.

145
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:20,095
There's some news in the paper.

146
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:22,665
- Oh, what is it?
- They found the wallet.

147
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,666
- What wallet?
- Carson's wallet. Here.

148
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:26,668
Here. Let me see.

149
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,500
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, I would.

150
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:32,234
- How about you, Mavis?
- I'd love one.

151
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:35,436
Poor Hilary.
That's all they're talking about at the club.

152
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:38,946
H.E. will probably get a cable
from the colonial office.

153
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,949
They're worried
about the tourist trade.

154
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,645
Of course, there is that
American newspaper man here.

155
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:49,089
Well, there's one thing sure. It is a small island.
He can't run far, whoever did it.

156
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:56,532
Tell Sylvia I had to go into town.

157
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,757
Get me 621.

158
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:28,358
Yes? Just hold on a minute.

159
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,365
Oh, never mind.

160
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:36,104
Good morning, Maxwell.

161
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:39,507
Anything I can do for you?

162
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,668
I was wondering, Colonel,
if you'd be kind enough...

163
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:44,246
to chairman a meeting up
in my district next week.

164
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:46,247
- I'm standing for election.
- Glad to.

165
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:48,817
- S-Sylvia all right?
- Yes, fine.

166
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,080
Good.

167
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:54,782
Uh, I see the papers say
you've found Carson's wallet.

168
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:56,825
Yes. Yes, Carson's papers were in it.

169
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:59,555
- That's how we identified it.
- That was stupid.

170
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:03,394
- What?
- Leaving the papers. At least, I'd say it was stupid.

171
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,264
Would you? Huh.
I'd say too clever.

172
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:11,172
I ran into Bradshaw.
He's certain it was a housebreaker.

173
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:14,300
Was he really?
I wonder why.

174
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:16,311
Is there any other
possibility?

175
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:18,540
A policeman has to keep
his eyes open, you know.

176
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:21,082
A chap my age
can't afford to miss a bit.

177
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,982
Particularly with the governor all stirred up.

178
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:28,046
You mean, it might have been made
to look like a thief s handiwork?

179
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:30,251
My dear fellow,
how would I know?

180
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,693
There are 15 possibilities.
I'm in the dark.

181
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:35,697
Which is the likeliest?

182
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:39,496
Never have preconceptions, my boy.
Open mind, that's the thing.

183
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:43,272
- Huh.
- You mustn't look too disappointed.

184
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:45,807
The work gets done.
Never fear.

185
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:49,470
Let's say I've guessed
who the murderer is.

186
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:51,479
A guess, mind you.
No more.

187
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:55,347
Well, it wouldn't do me the slightest
of good, my dear fellow. Not the slightest.

188
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:59,513
A court wants proof.
So, I- I just wait.

189
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:02,353
Patience, my boy.
That's the ticket.

190
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:05,986
Yes, I know that sounds-
sounds dull to you impatient chaps...

191
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:08,030
but that's police work.

192
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,759
Oh, he'll probably play into my hands,
whoever the fellow is.

193
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,960
I'm in no hurry.

194
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:16,561
You know, I- I said something
like that to a bloke once.

195
00:18:16,673 --> 00:18:18,971
I can't remember who.

196
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:21,543
Oh, middle age, my boy,
no memory at all.

197
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:23,806
Oh, yes. Yes, in B.G.

198
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:26,313
That's where it was. Yes.
Yes, forgery.

199
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,817
What put me on to my man
was a- a slip he made.

200
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,149
Tiny one. Hardly noticed it.

201
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:36,919
Chap said "afterward" instead of "after."

202
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:40,326
Get the point?
Absolutely the key.

203
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,523
No. No, probably not.

204
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:45,328
I suppose I didn't explain it properly.

205
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:48,404
"Afterward." That's what gave me the clue.

206
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:50,632
"Afterward"?

207
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,640
Absolutely, my dear fellow.

208
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:55,267
That's what
put me on the scent.

209
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:58,814
I'm glad you dropped by.
Happy to do that chairman thing for you.

210
00:18:58,915 --> 00:19:01,816
- You ring me up the day you need it. Cheerio.
- Thank you.

211
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:17,156
Halt!

212
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,820
You're late.

213
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:41,390
I'm sorry.
I almost didn't get here.

214
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:45,821
- Why not?
- Oh, it doesn't matter now.

215
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:48,420
It does to me.

216
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:50,431
Why?

217
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:57,600
Why did you choose
this place to meet?

218
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:00,608
This plantation used to
belong to my family.

219
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,941
It was the first on the island.

220
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:06,174
I wanted you to see it.

221
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:11,049
Your family?
I didn't know that.

222
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:15,887
It was destroyed during a slave uprising
in 1843, during the French rule.

223
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,123
I wonder what
could have caused it?

224
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,130
Any number of reasons.

225
00:20:22,232 --> 00:20:26,134
A single insult, a whipping, a girl.
Who knows?

226
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:30,028
Do you know what happened
to the owners?

227
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,208
That was more than
a hundred years ago.

228
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:43,885
And, now you're here,
and I'm here.

229
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:03,237
Do you still feel that anyone whose skin
is different from yours is an enemy?

230
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:06,698
- Do you think I do?
- I don't know.

231
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,040
At carnival time,
my brother-in-law's car was damaged...

232
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:11,045
his telephone wires cut.

233
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:13,047
You hate Maxwell, don't you?

234
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:15,049
You think of him as an enemy.

235
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:19,679
I think of him as a snob,
as an arrogant plantation owner.

236
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,457
Is that the reason
why you almost didn't get here?

237
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:29,927
Or did they tell you
that you shouldn't be seen with me?

238
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:34,265
That I'm an upstart, a nobody
who's gotten control of the union.

239
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,329
That I'm a dangerous man
who should be watched carefully.

240
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:43,071
You don't suppose I'd listen to them?
I only believe in what I see and what I know.

241
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,079
Do you know what
they say about me?

242
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:48,514
Poor Mavis Norman,
always getting into trouble.

243
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,444
Always picking the wrong man.

244
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,568
- Do you think of me as an enemy?
- No.

245
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:16,644
What are you thinking?

246
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:21,883
That you feel you're lost,
but you're not.

247
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:26,254
Because you're looking
for something real.

248
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:29,348
And as long as you're looking
for something real, you're not lost.

249
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:43,099
I suppose you and your father discussed
that article of Bradshaw's?

250
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:45,902
- Of course.
- What did he say?

251
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:49,706
Well, he said we ought to announce
our engagement at once...

252
00:22:49,812 --> 00:22:52,713
and then have
a celebration party.

253
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:55,648
- When did he say that?
- Last night. When he got back from Guiana.

254
00:22:57,553 --> 00:22:59,453
And what did he say
about our getting married?

255
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:01,614
"First things first," he said.

256
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:06,752
"We can talk later about what people
in Victorian homes might call 'naming the day."'

257
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,726
How neat.

258
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:16,468
- What?
- Your father's no fool.

259
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:20,572
I thought it was
very decent of him.

260
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:22,975
What else could he say?

261
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,979
It wouldn't be diplomatic, would it...

262
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,881
for the governor to offend
the whole colored population of Santa Marta?

263
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:34,321
Engaged. And then no one can say
that G.H. draws a color line.

264
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:37,723
- Of course, marriage-
- I bel- My father's never lied to me.

265
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:39,761
Do you think he'd run
the risk of having a grandson...

266
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:42,854
an eventual heir,
who's part Negro?

267
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:45,491
He'll see to it that you go back to England.

268
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,501
Not without you.

269
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:55,006
It doesn't matter.
The marriage isn't important anyway.

270
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:57,011
Oh, now, Jocelyn,
we've got to get this clear.

271
00:23:57,113 --> 00:24:00,082
- Bradshaw's article won't mean anything as far-
- It's clear.

272
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:02,174
It's perfectly clear.

273
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:08,315
A romance-
isn't that what you wanted?

274
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:13,054
Eighteen months was such
a long time in Egypt, and without a girl.

275
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:19,063
Jocelyn, you've got to listen to me.
When we're back in England this won't mean a-

276
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,068
I don't went to hear
about England.

277
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:26,406
Whatever happens,
I want you to remember one thing.

278
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:31,444
You'll never be more loved
than you are right now.

279
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:02,376
What time is it?

280
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:06,140
It's almost 8:00.

281
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:11,753
I think we should go.

282
00:25:11,854 --> 00:25:15,813
We're going to be very happy in London,
you know, forever and ever.

283
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:21,857
Of course.
Forever and ever.

284
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:56,864
- Have you any Rock Hinde?
- Yes, we have.

285
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:58,957
I'll take your Rock Hinde.

286
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:01,970
- Yes.
- Give me some Rock Hinde.

287
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:04,699
Give me some Rock Hinde!
Give me some Rock Hinde!

288
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:08,942
- Fish for dinner?
- Rock Hinde. You get it cheap here.

289
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:13,038
- Oh. I must tell my wife.
- Send it up to my house.

290
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:15,140
That election meeting
of yours is all set, I hear.

291
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:18,049
Yes. You're coming out there, aren't you?
I'm counting on it.

292
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:24,125
Anything new about Carson?
I mean, the man who did it?

293
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:27,128
I've come to the conclusion
it was an accident.

294
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,963
- An accident?
- Yes. Unpremeditated. A quarrel. That's what it was.

295
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,764
Last thing the poor devil wanted,
Carson dead.

296
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:40,905
If only he'd come to the police station
right away, we might have smoothed it out.

297
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,478
What a fool he was.

298
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:45,479
A fool?

299
00:26:45,581 --> 00:26:50,484
Absolutely. You see, the chap who did it,
I'm- I'm sorry for him.

300
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:54,352
He's not strong enough
to bear the burden of his guilt.

301
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:57,085
<i>Ever read a book called
Crime and Punishment?</i>

302
00:26:57,193 --> 00:27:00,390
- No. Why?
- Well, you should. It's about just this sort of thing.

303
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:02,930
A man who has
committed a crime...

304
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:06,229
and his relationship with a detective
who knows he's committed it...

305
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,235
but still can't prove it.

306
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:11,067
There's a-They have a-
have a secret together.

307
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:14,041
There's a-There's
a deep bond between them.

308
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:16,043
It's rather like a love affair...

309
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:20,707
because the detective is the only man
in the world who understands him.

310
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:26,049
And in his heart, the murderer wants
to be found out by the detective.

311
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:28,214
Now, this fellow
in the Carson case, you know...

312
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:30,224
what I'd like to do
is to go up to him...

313
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:33,295
take him by the arm
and tell him not to worry.

314
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:36,998
"I'll do my best for you,"
I want to say to him.

315
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:40,694
"I'm not out to punish you.
I'm not out to punish anyone.

316
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:45,740
"It's just that I've got to maintain law and order.
But I mean you no harm.

317
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:48,833
"We'll-We'll get it fixed
as manslaughter.

318
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:51,277
"That might mean
only five years...

319
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,746
"and the sentence could
be remitted for good behavior.

320
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:56,181
"It might be only three years.

321
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:58,185
"I know that sounds
a long time now, but...

322
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:00,881
"three years passes very quickly.

323
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,925
"Now, you look back three years.
Does it seem a long time?

324
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:06,051
"No, of course it doesn't.

325
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:09,563
"And, after all, three years
isn't such a big price to pay...

326
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,758
"for your peace of mind.

327
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:15,735
So, come now.
Confess. Tell me."

328
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:18,671
Well, that's what I'd like to say to the poor devil...

329
00:28:18,774 --> 00:28:21,402
if he came to me.

330
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,410
Well, I'll be seeing you.

331
00:28:23,512 --> 00:28:26,777
<i>Oh, that book, Crime and Punishment,
I'll send it over to you.</i>

332
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:30,147
When you get a chance,
you read it.

333
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:32,153
Yes.

334
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:01,174
- Hello.
- Hello.

335
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:03,582
Good evening.

336
00:29:03,686 --> 00:29:05,586
Excuse me.
I won't be a minute.

337
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,067
Are you nervous?

338
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:24,402
So am I.
All these people.

339
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:33,312
It seems so strange and unbelievable,
our being here.

340
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,316
Do you remember the day
of the governor's party...

341
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:37,943
when poor Hilary Carson
suggested you run for election?

342
00:29:39,522 --> 00:29:41,490
- I never really thought-
- I remember.

343
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:44,783
It must have come to his mind
that very moment...

344
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:48,261
because when he came out
to the house that morning-

345
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:50,764
- He came out to the house?
- Yes.

346
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:55,602
You knew Carson rather well, didn't you?

347
00:29:56,639 --> 00:30:01,338
Well- No.
I- I wouldn't say well.

348
00:30:01,444 --> 00:30:03,708
Why?

349
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:06,179
Why did he come out
to the house?

350
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:09,479
It had to do with
the Belfontaine Fund.

351
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:11,917
The Belfontaine Fund?

352
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:15,616
Yes, he wanted to find out
what sort of a gift your father wanted.

353
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:19,661
It was intended to be some sort
of token of his services to Santa Marta.

354
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:22,458
He said don't mention it to anybody,
particularly Maxwell.

355
00:30:22,565 --> 00:30:24,465
It was intended as a surprise.

356
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:27,161
That's all. That's all it was.

357
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:29,260
Of course.
What did you imagine it was?

358
00:30:32,241 --> 00:30:34,175
It's time to start.

359
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:43,878
May I have
your attention, please?

360
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:51,526
I'm here tonight as chairman of a meeting
at which Mr. Maxwell Fleury...

361
00:30:51,627 --> 00:30:56,621
<i>who is offering himself as your representative
in the Legislative Council...</i>

362
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:59,200
<i>will explain his position to you.</i>

363
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:03,270
Now, you all know Mr. Fleury.

364
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:08,275
Few West Indian families
bear a name as respected as his.

365
00:31:08,377 --> 00:31:13,041
<i>Mr. Fleury.</i>

366
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,149
<i>The elections for which I stand before you-</i>

367
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:30,196
The election for which I-

368
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:03,123
Quiet! Quiet! Stop this!

369
00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:09,130
You've all been given
a chance to vote.

370
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:11,570
When the time comes,
you'll use it.

371
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:16,176
And now, let him
use his right to speak.

372
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:19,913
The floor is yours, Mr. Fleury.

373
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,630
I will not speak to you
from this paper.

374
00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:43,204
This paper is filled with words
that come from my head.

375
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:48,766
I- I will try to speak to you with words
that come from my heart.

376
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:53,239
Many of you
out there know me.

377
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:57,479
You've cut my sugar cane
and harvested my coffee crop.

378
00:32:57,586 --> 00:32:59,816
And, yet, I have not known you.

379
00:32:59,922 --> 00:33:05,087
And in this, I've failed,
as I have failed in... other things.

380
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:10,726
To deny this would be
to deny truth, and...

381
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,427
I will speak
to you tonight only truth.

382
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,703
I have passed you in the fields
or in the cocoa sheds...

383
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:22,038
and you've been just a name,
or a face, or a number in a book.

384
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:28,714
And I've lived in a world
through which you moved only as... shadows...

385
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:31,650
<i>to be feared or ignored.</i>

386
00:33:31,754 --> 00:33:36,054
I've now lived in the two worlds
of Santa Marta.

387
00:33:36,158 --> 00:33:39,389
I know how they both think,
how they both feel.

388
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,257
I also know that
they cannot exist...

389
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:49,235
if they're cut off from each other
by suspicion and fear...

390
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:52,671
each in its own loneliness...

391
00:33:52,775 --> 00:33:57,144
as no human being can exist,
in his own loneliness.

392
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:04,613
This bridge I can help you build.

393
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,883
I ask for your faith, your trust.

394
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,221
<i>Do not deny them to me.</i>

395
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:16,128
I'll answer any questions
from the floor.

396
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:24,204
The floor is now
open for questions.

397
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:27,173
<i>I have a few, Mr. Chairman.</i>

398
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:34,310
I was as moved
by Mr. Fleury's speech as anyone else.

399
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:40,386
And I agree when he says that the two worlds
cannot exist separate from each other.

400
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,889
The question I would like
to ask Mr. Fleury is this.

401
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:50,560
Does he think that
the only issue here is one of color?

402
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:55,933
Is he saying that that is the reason
why we should vote for him?

403
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:59,371
Is he saying,
"Vote for me because I am one of you"?

404
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:03,002
Is that what
you're saying, Mr. Fleury?

405
00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:06,240
Because if you are,
I would like to take that issue up...

406
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:08,373
with your permission, Mr. Chairman.

407
00:35:11,553 --> 00:35:16,286
Mr. Fleury said he has
existed in the two worlds of Santa Marta.

408
00:35:16,392 --> 00:35:19,293
- Which do you think he'll represent?
- I would like to answer that.

409
00:35:19,395 --> 00:35:22,455
<i>When I'm finished, Mr. Chairman!</i>

410
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:26,161
Would Mr. Fleury
also answer this?

411
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:30,295
You said that you came here tonight
only to speak the truth.

412
00:35:30,406 --> 00:35:34,240
Wouldn't it also be true to say
that the only reason that you seek the election...

413
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:38,279
is to revenge yourself upon the whites
whom you now think despise you?

414
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,780
That the only reason
that you want to be black...

415
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:44,341
is because you're afraid that the white world
will not let you be white anymore?

416
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:47,354
That you want
to use us, our votes...

417
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:51,415
so that you can still rule
in that world that you still belong to.

418
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,859
And tell us another truth, Mr. Fleury.

419
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:57,454
In your heart, deep down inside...

420
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:59,796
don't you still think of us as slaves?

421
00:35:59,902 --> 00:36:01,870
- As a stupid, ignorant people?
- That's a lie!

422
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,167
No, Mr. Fleury! That is the truth!

423
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:08,107
And the issue here is
not just one of color.

424
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,340
The issue here is,
who is really best fit to represent the people?

425
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:15,975
Who knows them the best?
Who feels for them the most?

426
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:17,985
Who's really a part of them?

427
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:20,385
Is it you, Mr. Fleury, or is it me?

428
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,389
<i>Now you may answer, Mr. Fleury.</i>

429
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:25,187
<i>- Boyeur! Boyeur!
- Boyeur!</i>

430
00:36:25,294 --> 00:36:27,023
Boyeur! Boyeur!

431
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:30,155
Boyeur! Boyeur! Boyeur!

432
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:34,500
David Boyeur!

433
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:45,877
Boyeur! Boyeur! Boyeur!

434
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:58,425
He's right!
I'm not one of you!

435
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:00,427
I don't belong to you!

436
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:03,430
I don't want to be one of you!
I never did!

437
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:36,397
All right, friends.
The meeting's over. Let's go home.

438
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:03,547
My comb's gone.
I must have left it. Lend me yours?

439
00:38:14,803 --> 00:38:17,795
- Am I presentable now?
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:19,999
What was the name of the film
we were supposed to see?

441
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:23,669
<i>- Red Shoes.
- Oh. Was it good?</i>

442
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:28,079
A bit long.

443
00:38:29,117 --> 00:38:31,017
Good night, darling.

444
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:37,925
Uh, Jocelyn...

445
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:39,926
there's something I want to say.

446
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:43,020
- Darling, can't-
- It won't take long.

447
00:38:43,131 --> 00:38:46,760
I want us to be married
before I go back to England.

448
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:48,769
Why?

449
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:53,274
Because I've an odd feeling that
if we don't get married now, we never shall.

450
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,503
You know, you're the most difficult person
to get a wedding ring on.

451
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:01,648
Am I?
I'll try not to be.

452
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:18,031
You're up late.

453
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:21,728
I've been waiting for Maxwell to call.
How was the film?

454
00:39:23,038 --> 00:39:25,097
A bit long.

455
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,711
Mother, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

456
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,816
Is there a match?

457
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:38,785
Fruit bowl.

458
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:54,162
You were saying?

459
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,033
In about three months,
I want to go to Canada.

460
00:39:57,139 --> 00:39:59,471
I'd like to start
making the arrangements now.

461
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:02,168
Canada? Why on earth
do you want to go there?

462
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,075
Because I'm pregnant.

463
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,978
Does Euan know?

464
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,108
You're sure that you are?

465
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:12,618
There isn't any doubt.

466
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:16,248
Well, you're certainly calm about it.

467
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:19,225
You might show
some shame, some guilt.

468
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:22,092
If it will make you feel any happier,
I feel quite guilty.

469
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:30,263
I thought Euan's father wouldn't let us marry,
so I settled for what there was.

470
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:32,863
I thought, first of all,
I'd go to Trinidad, and then I changed my mind.

471
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:37,275
I think Canada's the best idea.
I could have it adopted. It shouldn't be hard.

472
00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:43,073
There's only one thing.
I shouldn't like Daddy to know.

473
00:40:43,185 --> 00:40:45,415
He's been through enough.

474
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,614
- That's why I need your help.
- My help?

475
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:52,785
You care about appearances,
what people will say.

476
00:40:52,894 --> 00:40:54,794
Thank you.

477
00:40:56,798 --> 00:40:58,698
Of course, you know that
you've behaved stupidly.

478
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,236
You have behaved like a peasant girl
in the cane fields.

479
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:04,567
I suppose that's neither here nor there.

480
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:07,699
It's the future that matters.
May I have another match?

481
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:12,076
You might at least strike it.

482
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:17,710
You're engaged.
You can get married in a hurry.

483
00:41:20,822 --> 00:41:23,382
You've not quarreled with him?

484
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:27,087
He says he wants to marry me
when he goes back to England.

485
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:31,958
- I'm not marrying Euan.
- Why not? You're insane.

486
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:36,666
<i>- You are still in love with him?
- Yes.</i>

487
00:41:36,772 --> 00:41:40,071
Then what on earth is there
to stop your marrying?

488
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:42,075
I've told you the reason.

489
00:41:42,177 --> 00:41:45,374
Don't be ridiculous.
The English Peerage isn't that sacred.

490
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:51,285
Think of Euan.
Think of the jokes there'd be made about it.

491
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:54,253
You might have thought of that
two months ago.

492
00:41:54,356 --> 00:41:57,382
I didn't know then about
my Jamaican grandmother.

493
00:42:00,195 --> 00:42:05,189
- Is that the only reason why you're refusing to marry him?
- It is.

494
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:09,760
If you had the chance,
if things were different-

495
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:13,329
- No. They're not different.
- I know. I know. But supposing they were?

496
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:17,635
Would you give anything
to marry him?

497
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:19,646
Yes.

498
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,675
Very well.

499
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,779
I owe you this.

500
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,618
You need have no qualms
about marrying Euan.

501
00:42:31,726 --> 00:42:35,560
There isn't a drop of African blood
in your veins. My husband isn't your father.

502
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:44,471
<i>- Isn't?
- No.</i>

503
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:49,609
Well, then who?

504
00:42:49,711 --> 00:42:52,509
That's immaterial.
It's better you shouldn't know.

505
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:57,377
He's completely English.
You can rest assured of that.

506
00:42:57,486 --> 00:43:00,353
I shall tell Lord Templeton who he is.

507
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:04,983
He has a right to know who will be
the other grandfather of his grandchildren.

508
00:43:06,528 --> 00:43:09,656
Telling him will be the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

509
00:43:11,032 --> 00:43:13,557
But it must be done.

510
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:16,000
He may have
your old-fashioned ideas.

511
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,402
I must ask you for the same
consideration you asked me.

512
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,206
I'd rather your father-

513
00:43:27,249 --> 00:43:29,740
I'd rather my husband didn't know.

514
00:43:31,786 --> 00:43:34,983
You were always so devoted.

515
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,287
I never conceived the possibility
of another man in your life.

516
00:43:38,393 --> 00:43:43,160
Children don't.
They think mistakes are their privilege.

517
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:49,601
Mother-

518
00:43:51,573 --> 00:43:53,939
I don't want you to
talk to Lord Templeton.

519
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:56,272
I don't want you
to tell him anything.

520
00:43:56,378 --> 00:43:58,903
But he should know.

521
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:01,983
I'll tell Euan... eventually.

522
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:05,246
But I won't have you
humiliate yourself for my sake.

523
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:07,514
Or for Euan's...

524
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:09,817
or even for Lord Templeton's.

525
00:44:26,741 --> 00:44:28,641
Shall I put the car away, darling?

526
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:31,911
No, I'll put it away later.

527
00:44:34,816 --> 00:44:36,716
Are you hungry?

528
00:44:36,818 --> 00:44:38,718
Not very.

529
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,789
There's some cold lobster in the refrigerator
and a bottle of champagne.

530
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,688
We could have it upstairs.
Wouldn't you like that?

531
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:46,693
I suppose.

532
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:52,764
Do you know what
I was thinking on the way home?

533
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:55,563
That I've never seen snow.

534
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,197
Imagine being my age
and never seeing snow.

535
00:44:59,307 --> 00:45:02,868
Oh, it would be so wonderful
to go to someplace after Santa Marta...

536
00:45:02,978 --> 00:45:06,106
where they have real blizzards,
real winters.

537
00:45:10,852 --> 00:45:12,752
When did Whittingham
send this over?

538
00:45:12,854 --> 00:45:14,822
The other day.
I forgot to mention it to you.

539
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:17,790
Have you read it?

540
00:45:17,892 --> 00:45:19,826
Yes.

541
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:22,624
The murderer confesses,
I suppose.

542
00:45:22,731 --> 00:45:24,631
Yes.

543
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:28,134
Is he married?
The man in the book who does the murder?

544
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,838
- No, he's not married.
- Pity.

545
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:36,035
I might have been
tempted to read it if he were.

546
00:45:36,144 --> 00:45:38,874
Why?

547
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,006
He wouldn't want to
hurt his wife.

548
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:45,644
He wouldn't want her ever to know about it
and suffer on account of it.

549
00:45:46,888 --> 00:45:48,856
The detective knows, doesn't he?

550
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:52,518
I mean, in the book.
And the fellow who did it is in a trap.

551
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:54,686
And it's closing in,
getting tighter every day.

552
00:45:55,897 --> 00:45:58,229
Not a chance of
ever getting out of it.

553
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:06,203
What about that champagne
you promised me?

554
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:08,401
Were you jealous
of Hilary Carson?

555
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,777
Yes. I envied him because
he was the kind of man...

556
00:46:13,882 --> 00:46:17,215
I thought that I wanted
to be and I couldn't.

557
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:19,412
I thought you were
attracted to him.

558
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:23,056
Hilary Carson?

559
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:26,992
I loved you.
I thought you didn't love me.

560
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:29,154
I thought that
sooner or later...

561
00:46:29,264 --> 00:46:32,927
you'd fall in love with some man
who was better suited to you.

562
00:46:33,034 --> 00:46:36,993
I thought Carson was
that kind of a man.

563
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:42,009
- Maxwell.
- Yes.

564
00:46:44,212 --> 00:46:46,112
You didn't have
anything to do with the-

565
00:46:46,214 --> 00:46:48,774
Don't be foolish.

566
00:46:48,883 --> 00:46:51,613
You know that
I'm incapable of killing a man.

567
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:02,762
I'm going upstairs.

568
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:05,799
I'll bring the champagne up.

569
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:49,709
Darling?

570
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:51,870
I-I'll be out in a moment.

571
00:47:56,851 --> 00:47:59,649
I wonder when Jocelyn's
getting married.

572
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:03,485
Funny, a few weeks ago,
I'd have been envious of her.

573
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:07,721
<i>I mean, London, a big house,
and being Lady Templeton.</i>

574
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:09,922
<i>Now it doesn't matter so much.</i>

575
00:48:13,768 --> 00:48:15,827
<i>Do hurry, darling.</i>

576
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:21,273
I saw a film the other day
about a little town in New England.

577
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:24,277
New England. That's where I'd like to live.

578
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:26,438
The characters in the film
lived in a little house...

579
00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:29,449
and it had a wonderful kitchen
with all sorts of gadgets.

580
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:35,988
With a kitchen like that,
you don't need servants.

581
00:48:37,158 --> 00:48:39,217
That's how I'd like to live.

582
00:48:39,327 --> 00:48:42,490
<i>Not in some big old house
built hundreds of years ago...</i>

583
00:48:42,597 --> 00:48:45,225
<i>and getting dressed
for a lonely dinner.</i>

584
00:48:54,676 --> 00:48:57,201
You see? That's the sort
of woman you married.

585
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:05,885
Maxwell!

586
00:49:05,987 --> 00:49:07,955
<i>Maxwell!</i>

587
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:16,661
Darling, will you call
Colonel Whittingham...

588
00:49:16,764 --> 00:49:19,198
and tell him that I'm coming down
to see him right away?

589
00:49:33,081 --> 00:49:34,981
I like this.

590
00:49:36,317 --> 00:49:40,515
I've resigned.
The governor found out about us.

591
00:49:41,556 --> 00:49:44,753
Oh? Well, what did he say?

592
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:46,952
He left the decision to me.

593
00:49:47,061 --> 00:49:49,621
Oh, he talked about the book too.

594
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:52,063
He was disturbed about that also.

595
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:54,566
But this is the best thing
you've ever done.

596
00:49:54,669 --> 00:49:58,503
Even if it's true, he said, it isn't fair
to those who've had to stay on the island.

597
00:49:58,606 --> 00:50:02,235
Fair? It's true!

598
00:50:02,343 --> 00:50:05,904
It's so true and
so good that it hurts.

599
00:50:08,082 --> 00:50:09,982
When are you leaving?

600
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:12,882
Friday.

601
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:16,650
- What about you?
- You needn't worry.

602
00:50:18,326 --> 00:50:21,056
I'll be broke.
There's nothing much I've saved here.

603
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:23,221
And the book's a long way
from being done.

604
00:50:24,832 --> 00:50:28,495
We've never looked ahead. We-
We never discussed anything...

605
00:50:28,603 --> 00:50:30,571
but just lived from day to day.

606
00:50:30,672 --> 00:50:32,572
Is there something
you want to discuss?

607
00:50:34,776 --> 00:50:37,836
Yes, there is.
Life without you.

608
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:43,947
Writing things you won't
be the first to read.

609
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:47,283
Feeling things we can't share.

610
00:50:51,025 --> 00:50:53,084
How long would it
take you to pack?

611
00:50:53,194 --> 00:50:55,094
But I-

612
00:50:57,365 --> 00:51:01,495
Mmm, two hours.
I don't have very much either.

613
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:05,036
There's a plane leaves
for England on Friday.

614
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:07,039
I'll send a car for you.

615
00:51:07,141 --> 00:51:09,769
All right.

616
00:51:09,877 --> 00:51:14,371
You don't seem very surprised-
at our going to England together.

617
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,412
Where you go, I go.

618
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:29,659
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

619
00:51:29,764 --> 00:51:31,664
<i>This is the final call...</i>

620
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:36,430
<i>for B.W.I. A Viscount
Flight 072 to New York...</i>

621
00:51:36,537 --> 00:51:40,769
<i>connecting with B.O.A.C.
Monarch to London now loading.</i>

622
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:49,539
Do you mind if I don't
wait until the plane goes?

623
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:51,551
Sylvia's alone.

624
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:53,553
Good-bye.

625
00:51:55,323 --> 00:51:58,019
Well, sir. There they go.

626
00:51:58,126 --> 00:52:01,493
Poor Julian.
Who'd have thought a son of his?

627
00:52:04,065 --> 00:52:06,397
What will the indictment be
against Maxwell, Colonel?

628
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:09,470
Well, we'll try and get it in
as manslaughter, sir.

629
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:13,438
I meant to have a talk
with Euan when he arrived- father to son.

630
00:52:14,475 --> 00:52:17,933
But I never did.
Now he's married.

631
00:52:22,116 --> 00:52:24,016
Good-bye, sir.

632
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:56,717
There's the plane for England.

633
00:52:58,786 --> 00:53:02,654
In the girl's case-
Does it work the other way around?

634
00:53:02,757 --> 00:53:07,091
I mean, Denis Archer marries Margot.
Euan marries Jocelyn.

635
00:53:07,195 --> 00:53:12,155
But, when it's the other way around,
does it make any difference?

636
00:53:13,301 --> 00:53:15,201
Out here, yes.

637
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:18,795
How big is Santa Marta?
It's 50 miles long.

638
00:53:18,906 --> 00:53:20,806
There are other countries.

639
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:24,434
My skin is my country.

640
00:53:24,545 --> 00:53:29,778
Maybe the men looking at Margot
at some cocktail party in Bloomsbury...

641
00:53:29,884 --> 00:53:31,784
or at a literary tea-

642
00:53:31,886 --> 00:53:34,753
well, they'd envy Denis Archer.

643
00:53:34,856 --> 00:53:39,225
Their own wives look sort of dull
when she walks into a room.

644
00:53:39,327 --> 00:53:43,491
But if I were to walk in with you,
or a girl like you as my wife-

645
00:53:44,832 --> 00:53:48,393
Do you care what stupid
and prejudiced people think?

646
00:53:48,503 --> 00:53:53,964
You've never had to fight stupidity or prejudice.
Besides, I'd be a fool.

647
00:53:54,075 --> 00:53:58,011
- Why?
- Because it would be inevitable.

648
00:53:58,112 --> 00:54:00,137
What would be?

649
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:06,212
That night that she'd forget herself
and call me a nigger.

650
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:13,320
You can't mean that.
You can't possibly mean that!

651
00:54:14,562 --> 00:54:16,496
- No. I don't.
- Then why did you say it?

652
00:54:18,332 --> 00:54:21,824
Because here is my world.
These are my people, and this is where I belong.

653
00:54:23,704 --> 00:54:27,572
If I went to England, who would I be?
What would I be?

654
00:54:27,675 --> 00:54:30,940
- David Boyeur.
- No.

655
00:54:31,045 --> 00:54:36,677
I'd be an exile in a bowler hat,
sipping tea, and carrying a rolled umbrella...

656
00:54:36,784 --> 00:54:40,811
talking with the other exiles about how much
we could do if we were only there.

657
00:54:40,922 --> 00:54:43,686
But I'm here.
I don't have to go.

658
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,885
And even here,
I'd be in your way, wouldn't I?

659
00:54:49,764 --> 00:54:51,664
Yes, you would be
in my way.

660
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:55,395
- Besides, they'd never understand.
- Who wouldn't?

661
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:58,063
My own people.

662
00:54:58,172 --> 00:55:00,197
They'd feel I betrayed them.

663
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:03,309
I have no choice.

664
00:55:03,411 --> 00:55:05,470
You're like a rock.

665
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,174
Yes. I'm buried deep right here.

666
00:55:13,654 --> 00:55:15,815
My people have their freedom.

667
00:55:15,923 --> 00:55:19,154
They've got a vote.
They've got power now.

668
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,194
And I've got to show them
how to use it.

669
00:55:22,396 --> 00:55:24,296
When I'm through here
in Santa Marta...

670
00:55:24,398 --> 00:55:30,132
I'll go to St. Kitts and Barbados and Grenada-
the whole archipelago.

671
00:55:30,238 --> 00:55:32,172
Shall I tell you why
you won't go to England?

672
00:55:32,273 --> 00:55:35,538
You don't want that power for your people.
You want it for yourself.

673
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:39,374
You're afraid to go there
because you won't have it anymore.

674
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,778
- Do you really mean that?
- I wanted to admire you...

675
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:44,249
to feel that you were
superior to most men.

676
00:55:44,352 --> 00:55:47,378
People don't count with you.
Nothing counts with you but power.

677
00:55:47,488 --> 00:55:49,547
You use people.
You climb on their backs.

678
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:53,586
You can't mean that.

679
00:55:53,694 --> 00:55:55,594
No, I don't.

680
00:55:55,696 --> 00:55:58,631
You're right and I'm wrong.
I'm wrong and you're right.

681
00:56:01,736 --> 00:56:05,570
- And that's the end, is it?
- Yes. That's the end.
