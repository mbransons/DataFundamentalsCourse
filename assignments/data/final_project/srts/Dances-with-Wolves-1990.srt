1
00:01:30,353 --> 00:01:33,174
- Is this the last one?
- I don't know.

2
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,159
There's no ether, either.

3
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:37,011
Jesus Christ.

4
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:40,166
You there!
Is this the last one?

5
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:49,411
Oh God, what a mess.

6
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:52,481
At least there's no gangrene.

7
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:55,202
There will be
if it doesn't come off soon.

8
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:58,048
Well I can't saw
if I can't keep my eyes open.

9
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:00,985
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:05,549
Let's coffee up.
He can wait a few more minutes.

11
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:19,995
Oh God!

12
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:48,343
Glass.

13
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:53,975
- Is that Tucker's men?
- Yes, sir. I think it is.

14
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:56,186
How long has it been like this?

15
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:00,150
We found 'em this morning, sir.
They've been here for two days.

16
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,500
Is that you, Lieutenant?

17
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,589
Sons of bitches.

18
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,596
Come on. You better take cover

19
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,437
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters.
Come on. Go under cover

20
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:30,565
There you go.

21
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:39,410
You went to the hospital?

22
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,538
It was no good

23
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:47,961
What's going on here?

24
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:50,089
What's going on here?

25
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,052
That seems to be the question, all right.

26
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:55,930
See, you could ask the major...

27
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:58,309
but he don't know

28
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,727
He's busy.

29
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,689
He's busy trying to figure out
how come the officers' mess...

30
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:04,775
run out of peach ice cream.

31
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:07,571
Then, of course, you got the general.

32
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,865
He comes up to see the show.

33
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:11,993
All he knows is there ain't no show...

34
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,205
which ain't entirely correct
'cause we started a balloon up...

35
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,958
but they shot her down
before we got off the ground.

36
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:21,631
Nobody's made a run either way.
It's been a standoff all damned day.

37
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,720
Now, the major, he's
looking at the general.

38
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,017
<i>He's thinking to himself,
I better do something.</i>

39
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:32,686
You know what that means.

40
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,899
I sure as hell don't want to be
the first one across this field.

41
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:39,487
They're supposed
to be beat up just like us

42
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:43,075
Hell, everybody knows
Tucker's men are tough as cobs.

43
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:47,331
So far, the only thing been killed
out here is three milking cows.

44
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:50,501
Course, that's about to change

45
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,301
You son of a bitch.

46
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,725
You know, some of the boys are saying
if we ain't gonna fight...

47
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:06,814
we could just settle
this whole business with a little...

48
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:08,649
high-stakes poker.

49
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,652
Wouldn't that be a sight?

50
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:14,198
A bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field...

51
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:15,576
drawing cards.

52
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:26,465
What is it, sir?

53
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:28,008
Looks like a suicide

54
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:30,011
Tucker!

55
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,154
What's he doing?

56
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:14,026
- What did you say to him?
- I didn't say nothing.

57
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,226
Come on back, you son of a bitch!

58
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,608
- You won't make it no second time!
- All right by me.

59
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,824
Forgive me, Father.

60
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:57,541
- He's coming back again!
- Here he comes, boys!

61
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:34,338
- Ready!
- I got him

62
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,849
Don't...

63
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:23,939
Don't take off my foot.

64
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:27,235
You rest easy, son.
You'll keep your foot.

65
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:30,239
With God as my judge, you'll keep it.

66
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,456
- Bring up my ambulance.
- Sir?

67
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:40,794
Bring up my ambulance,
and bring my surgeon with it!

68
00:11:42,462 --> 00:11:45,299
We got an officer
who's worth something lying here.

69
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:15,380
<i>The strangeness of this life
cannot be measured.</i>

70
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:17,216
<i>In trying to produce my own death...</i>

71
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,095
<i>I was elevated to the
status of a living hero.</i>

72
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:22,055
<i>I was also awarded Cisco...</i>

73
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:25,101
<i>the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day.</i>

74
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:29,106
<i>And on full recovery, was given
transfer to any station I desired.</i>

75
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:33,111
<i>The bloody slaughter continues in the east
as I arrive at Fort Hayes.</i>

76
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:37,909
<i>A tiny island of men and material surrounded
by a never-ending sea of prairie.</i>

77
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,194
Lieutenant.

78
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:01,434
Where can I find Maj. Fambrough?

79
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:02,803
Down at the end of the hall.

80
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:04,221
Thank you.

81
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:15,903
<i>Lt. John J. Dunbar.</i>

82
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:22,621
Lt. John J. Dunbar?

83
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:25,332
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.</i>

84
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,336
Indian fighter

85
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:30,589
Excuse me?

86
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:33,176
It says here that you're
to be posted on the frontier.

87
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:34,594
The frontier is Indian country.

88
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:37,181
I quickly deduced that
you're an Indian fighter.

89
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:39,892
I did not ascend to this position
by being stupid.

90
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:41,853
- No, sir.
- No, sir

91
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:50,273
It says here that you've been decorated.

92
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,449
Yes, sir.

93
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,289
And they sent you here to be posted?

94
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:59,085
Actually, sir,
I'm here at my own request.

95
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:01,045
Really? Why?

96
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:04,716
I've always wanted to see the frontier.

97
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:06,802
You want to see the frontier?

98
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:08,973
Yes, sir.

99
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:10,474
Before it's gone.

100
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,986
Such a smart lad, coming straight to me.

101
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:27,663
Sir...

102
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:29,498
Knight.

103
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:33,586
I am sending you on a knight's errand.

104
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:37,175
You will report to Captain Cargill...

105
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:40,221
at the furthermost
outpost of the realm...

106
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:42,390
Fort Sedgewick.

107
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,604
My personal seal
will assure your safety...

108
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:51,235
through many miles of
wild and hostile country.

109
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:03,209
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

110
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,380
I was wondering, sir, how
will I be getting there?

111
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:10,092
You think I don't know?

112
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:12,179
- No, sir.
- You think that.

113
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,473
- It's just that I don't know...
- Hold your tongue.

114
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,144
I am in a generous mood
and I will grant your boon.

115
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,271
See that peasant out there?

116
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,191
He calls himself Timmons.

117
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:25,195
He's going there this very afternoon.
You can ride with him if you like.

118
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:28,825
He knows the way.
Thank you. That is all.

119
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:42,927
Sir Knight?

120
00:16:46,765 --> 00:16:48,977
I've just pissed in my pants...

121
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,565
and nobody can do anything about it.

122
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,753
To your journey!

123
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:16,178
To my journey!

124
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:35,078
Haw!

125
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:39,542
Over a little bit, Jim!

126
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:43,922
- Have this by tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:45,924
I'll have my crown now.

128
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:50,181
- Sir?
- I'll have my crown now!

129
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:54,436
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you deaf, fool?

130
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,939
I said I'll have my crown right now!

131
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:58,107
Now!

132
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,490
No.

133
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:06,827
- I'll get your crown.
- No.

134
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:18,050
Sir?

135
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:20,929
Major?

136
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,186
The king is dead.

137
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:33,737
Long live the king.

138
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:00,104
Get these kids out of here, come on!

139
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,460
Haw, Jim and Jake!

140
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:24,011
Gee a little bit, Jim!

141
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,100
The hell was that?

142
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,980
What is that?

143
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:16,489
What the hell is that?

144
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:44,149
Why don't you put that in your book?

145
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:55,415
<i>Were it not for my companion...</i>

146
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:58,126
<i>I believe I would be having
the time of my life.</i>

147
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,586
<i>I know he means well...</i>

148
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,967
<i>but he is quite possibly
the foulest man I have ever met.</i>

149
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:39,847
How far you make the Fort?

150
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:41,349
Far.

151
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:45,396
How far?

152
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:48,357
Forty, fifty mile, maybe.

153
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,570
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?

154
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,158
It's to be my post.

155
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:56,702
My home.

156
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:04,587
You ain't hard to please,
I'll give you that much.

157
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:11,347
Look yonder

158
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,446
What you got there?

159
00:23:35,753 --> 00:23:39,007
<i>Somebody back east is saying,
Why don't she write?</i>

160
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:43,179
You stupid bastard.

161
00:24:58,902 --> 00:25:00,487
Get up, Timmons.

162
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:05,619
Get up!

163
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,222
Get up!

164
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:22,975
Come on. Get up.

165
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:28,941
Get up!

166
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,744
Someone poked me in my butt.
Was that you?

167
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,496
Goddamn it!

168
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,710
I'm gonna have a welt.

169
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,976
Cpl. Guest?

170
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:15,912
You don't have to talk to me,
just please come out.

171
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:38,442
It's the end.

172
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:42,739
Assemble the men in front of my quarters.

173
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,296
You hate me

174
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:58,719
But I feel none of the same for you.

175
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,139
You men stayed.

176
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,647
You stayed after they
took all our horses.

177
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:12,362
You stayed after all the others deserted.

178
00:28:14,322 --> 00:28:17,368
You stayed after the army
failed to resupply us.

179
00:28:21,206 --> 00:28:24,084
I have looked for that
wagon from Fort Hayes...

180
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:25,754
just as you have...

181
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,173
day after miserable day.

182
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:33,972
And all I can say is
that I'm proud of you.

183
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,104
Now get your things, men.
We're leaving this place.

184
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:41,691
The army can go to hell.

185
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:46,989
Go.

186
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,825
Get your things.

187
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,962
How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

188
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:33,424
You can't figure the stinking buffalo.

189
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:36,803
You can't.
Sometimes you won't see any for days.

190
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:40,225
Other times, they'll be thick,
like curls on a whore

191
00:29:43,604 --> 00:29:44,940
What about Indians?

192
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:47,359
Indians? Goddamn Indians!

193
00:29:47,777 --> 00:29:51,280
You just as soon not see 'em
unless the bastards are dead.

194
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:53,825
They're nothing but thieves and beggars.

195
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:55,536
Ho, up there!

196
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:28,240
Not what you would call
much of a going concern now, is it?

197
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:34,289
Go down there

198
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:37,418
- Why? There ain't nothing down there.
- Because I said.

199
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:40,088
Go down there.

200
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:46,889
There, son of a bitch!

201
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,426
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

202
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:38,456
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

203
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,630
Lieutenant!

204
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,301
Everybody's run off or got killed.

205
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,913
All right. Let's unload the wagon.

206
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,917
What? What, and leave it all here?

207
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,170
I'm staying, too.

208
00:33:16,712 --> 00:33:18,591
There ain't nothing here.

209
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:21,719
No, not at the moment.

210
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,181
We don't know what's happened.

211
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,520
Things being as they are...

212
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:32,359
we might as well
just turn around and get headed back.

213
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:33,902
This is my post.

214
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,237
<i>This is my post?</i>

215
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:36,990
This is my post.

216
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,244
<i>This is my post?</i>

217
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:41,954
Jesus H. Christ.

218
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:43,707
What, are you crazy, boy?

219
00:33:47,253 --> 00:33:49,046
Fast son of a bitch.

220
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:51,883
- Jesus H. Christ.
- This is my post.

221
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,427
All right, put it down.

222
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,266
And these are the post provisions,
all right? Now get your ass off the wagon.

223
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:59,436
- Put it down!
- And help me unload.

224
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,272
We're just havin' a conversation,
now put it down.

225
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,716
I'll let them know where you are.

226
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,468
Good.

227
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:01,348
Good luck.

228
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,770
Thank you.

229
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,610
Jake and Jim!

230
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,419
Good mule!

231
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:25,588
Haw up there now!

232
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:57,088
Good mules!

233
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:19,324
<i>Have arrived to find
Fort Sedgewick deserted.</i>

234
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:23,205
<i>Am now waiting for garrison's return
or word from headquarters.</i>

235
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:25,458
<i>The posits in exceedingly poor condition...</i>

236
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:29,505
<i>and I have decided to assign myself
clean-up duty beginning tomorrow.</i>

237
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:31,423
<i>Supplies are abundant...</i>

238
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:34,302
<i>and the country
is everything I dreamed it would be.</i>

239
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:37,098
<i>There can be no place like this on Earth.</i>

240
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:37,504
Bad horse.

241
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:39,631
Bad horse.

242
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:49,168
<i>The animals in the pond
had not been poisoned.</i>

243
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,878
<i>They had all been shot.</i>

244
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:53,257
<i>But why? Was it for sport?</i>

245
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:55,969
<i>Could it have been out of spite?</i>

246
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:59,014
<i>My first guess would have been
that the men here were starving.</i>

247
00:41:59,098 --> 00:42:02,144
<i>But this rotting waste
speaks to the contrary.</i>

248
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:05,021
<i>The caves are an even bigger mystery.</i>

249
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,943
<i>What could have driven
men to live in caves?</i>

250
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,945
<i>Perhaps they were frightened.</i>

251
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,699
<i>Maybe there had been some sort of revolt.</i>

252
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:16,203
I can make no sense of
the clues left me here.

253
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:19,290
<i>Perhaps my relief will provide the answers.</i>

254
00:42:28,762 --> 00:42:30,847
Come on, Cisco. One more time.

255
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,098
Git up!

256
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,103
Come on! Git up, Cisco.

257
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:39,901
Git up!

258
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:42,613
Git up! There you go!

259
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,989
Easy.

260
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,515
<i>And if I...</i>

261
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:49,688
Look at me.

262
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,327
Don't hurt my mules.

263
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,377
Stop.

264
00:46:07,712 --> 00:46:08,713
Stop it.

265
00:46:33,578 --> 00:46:35,665
Please don't hurt my mules.

266
00:47:34,157 --> 00:47:36,409
<i>I am pleased with my efforts thus far.</i>

267
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:41,041
<i>For all my improvements, though, there
remains an ugliness here I cannot dispel.</i>

268
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:45,588
<i>An injury that goes beyond neglect
and like a bruise, it will be slow to heal.</i>

269
00:48:40,742 --> 00:48:42,745
<i>It's been almost 30 days.</i>

270
00:48:42,871 --> 00:48:46,417
<i>I have come to enjoy
the patterns of my life at Fort Sedgewick.</i>

271
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,546
<i>Especially my daily
reconnaissance rides with Cisco.</i>

272
00:48:50,422 --> 00:48:53,426
<i>Each day, we go further into the prairie
and every discovery...</i>

273
00:48:53,509 --> 00:48:56,889
<i>big or small,
becomes etched in my mind forever.</i>

274
00:48:57,389 --> 00:49:00,978
<i>It would seem I've been marooned,
as no one has yet come for me.</i>

275
00:49:01,061 --> 00:49:05,317
<i>I can only assume that there is a problem,
which the army will solve shortly.</i>

276
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,486
<i>Maybe I am being foolish in my optimism...</i>

277
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,407
<i>but when I look to the eastern horizon...</i>

278
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,787
<i>I never fail to hope
that a column might be out there.</i>

279
00:49:22,304 --> 00:49:25,142
<i>Still no sign of Capt. Cargill's command.</i>

280
00:49:25,434 --> 00:49:27,980
<i>Though well-supplied,
I've decided to ration my goods...</i>

281
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:31,525
<i>as if I were part
of a post instead of the whole affair.</i>

282
00:49:32,777 --> 00:49:36,239
<i>There's a wolf who seems intent
on the goings-on here.</i>

283
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:39,786
<i>He does not seem inclined
to be a nuisance, however.</i>

284
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:42,915
<i>And aside from Cisco,
has been my only company.</i>

285
00:49:43,124 --> 00:49:46,462
<i>He's appeared
each afternoon for the past two days.</i>

286
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,756
<i>He has two milky white paws.</i>

287
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:52,261
<i>If he comes calling tomorrow...</i>

288
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,597
<i>I will name him Two-Socks.</i>

289
00:51:46,408 --> 00:51:48,827
<i>Almost a month and no one has come.</i>

290
00:51:49,162 --> 00:51:50,914
<i>The longer this condition persists...</i>

291
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:54,086
<i>the less inclined I am
to believe that anyone will.</i>

292
00:51:54,336 --> 00:51:57,381
<i>Rain has forced me indoors
for most of two days now...</i>

293
00:51:57,464 --> 00:51:59,634
<i>and I have begun work on an awning.</i>

294
00:52:04,306 --> 00:52:06,434
<i>It is the loneliest of times for me now...</i>

295
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:09,605
<i>but I can say honestly
that I am not unhappy.</i>

296
00:52:57,959 --> 00:53:02,007
<i>How can I marry a pretty little girl</i>

297
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,551
<i>When I got no coat to put on?</i>

298
00:53:05,594 --> 00:53:07,388
<i>Soldier, soldier</i>

299
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:09,307
<i>Won't you marry me</i>

300
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,895
<i>Before the fight comes home?</i>

301
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:15,523
<i>How can I marry a pretty little girl</i>

302
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,402
<i>When I got no shoes to put on?</i>

303
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:36,801
<i>How can I marry a pretty little girl</i>

304

<i>When I got no hat to put on?</i>

305
00:54:03,377 --> 00:54:06,298
<i>Soldier, soldier, won't you marry me</i>

306
00:54:06,424 --> 00:54:08,717
<i>Before the fight comes home?</i>

307
00:54:08,968 --> 00:54:11,638
<i>How can I marry an ugly little girl</i>

308
00:54:12,305 --> 00:54:14,266
<i>When I got a pretty wife back home?</i>

309
00:55:15,137 --> 00:55:16,472
You there!

310
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:02,348
<i>Have made first contact with a wild Indian.</i>

311
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:05,603
<i>One came to the fort
and tried to steal my horse.</i>

312
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:08,439
<i>When I appeared,
he became frightened and ran off.</i>

313
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:13,363
<i>Have decided to bury excess ordnance
lets it fall into enemy hands.</i>

314
00:56:13,488 --> 00:56:16,574
<i>Keeping only the barest
necessities for myself.</i>

315
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:25,294
<i>My afternoon rides have been pared down
to short circular patrols...</i>

316
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:27,547
<i>always keeping the post in sight.</i>

317
00:56:28,423 --> 00:56:31,678
<i>Am taking steps to prepare
for another visitation.</i>

318
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:34,348
<i>Do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity...</i>

319
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,894
<i>but am assuming that where there is one
there's sure to be another.</i>

320
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,694
<i>Most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion...</i>

321
00:56:43,777 --> 00:56:45,655
<i>of strength and stability.</i>

322
00:56:46,864 --> 00:56:50,411
<i>I'm still alone, however,
and unless troops arrive soon...</i>

323
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,037
<i>all may be lost.</i>

324
01:00:27,315 --> 01:00:29,695
<i>It's been two days now, and nothing.</i>

325
01:00:29,736 --> 01:00:32,823
<i>My presence here must
have been reported by now.</i>

326
01:00:32,865 --> 01:00:35,785
<i>Have made all the
preparations I can think of.</i>

327
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:38,372
<i>Cannot mount an adequate defense
as I am still alone.</i>

328
01:00:38,456 --> 01:00:41,125
<i>But will try to make
a big impression when they come.</i>

329
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:42,503
<i>Waiting.</i>

330
01:00:43,004 --> 01:00:44,297
<i>Post-script...</i>

331
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:47,843
<i>The man I encountered was
a magnificent-looking fellow.</i>

332
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,747
<i>I realize now that I have been wrong.</i>

333
01:11:54,789 --> 01:11:56,750
<i>All this time, I've been waiting.</i>

334
01:11:56,834 --> 01:11:58,377
<i>Waiting for what?</i>

335
01:11:58,419 --> 01:11:59,921
<i>For someone to find me?</i>

336
01:12:00,005 --> 01:12:01,841
<i>For Indians to take my horse?</i>

337
01:12:01,924 --> 01:12:03,551
<i>To see a buffalo?</i>

338
01:12:03,634 --> 01:12:06,930
<i>Since I have arrived at this post
I have been walking on eggs.</i>

339
01:12:07,014 --> 01:12:09,850
<i>It has become a bad habit
and I am sick of it.</i>

340
01:12:09,933 --> 01:12:12,353
<i>Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.</i>

341
01:12:12,437 --> 01:12:15,025
<i>I do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking...</i>

342
01:12:15,108 --> 01:12:18,695
<i>but I've become a target
and a target makes a poor impression.</i>

343
01:12:18,778 --> 01:12:20,573
<i>I am through waiting.</i>

344
01:12:21,657 --> 01:12:23,576
What are you looking at?

345
01:13:54,202 --> 01:13:55,946
Son of a bitch!

346
01:14:08,263 --> 01:14:09,014
No. Wait.

347
01:14:11,157 --> 01:14:12,384
Wait.

348
01:14:14,846 --> 01:14:15,889
Wait.

349
01:14:18,726 --> 01:14:20,936
You need help. You're hurt.

350
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:23,065
- You need...
- No!

351
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:27,371
Let me... You need help.

352
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,908
You need help. You're hurt.
Let me help you.

353
01:14:34,713 --> 01:14:36,791
You're hurt.

354
01:14:41,464 --> 01:14:43,132
Don't.

355
01:18:01,856 --> 01:18:03,233
She's hurt.

356
01:18:09,782 --> 01:18:11,118
She's hurt.

357
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,476
No. She's hurt.

358
01:21:19,529 --> 01:21:20,738
Welcome.

359
01:21:21,697 --> 01:21:22,950
Welcome.

360
01:21:25,202 --> 01:21:26,161
Hi!

361
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:34,464
Come.

362
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,968
Please, sit down.

363
01:21:37,885 --> 01:21:39,053
Sit down.

364
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,005
Wait just a... Just a minute.

365
01:22:41,334 --> 01:22:42,803
Tatanka. Buffalo.

366
01:22:44,204 --> 01:22:45,940
- Buffalo.
- Tatanka.

367
01:22:53,517 --> 01:22:54,985
Buffalo. Tatanka.

368
01:22:57,739 --> 01:23:01,076
<i>The fierce one, as I call him,
seems a very tough fellow.</i>

369
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:02,995
<i>I hope I never have to fight him.</i>

370
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:06,668
<i>From the little I know,
he seems to be honest and very direct.</i>

371
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:08,962
<i>I like the quiet one immensely.</i>

372
01:23:09,045 --> 01:23:10,964
<i>He's been patient and inquisitive.</i>

373
01:23:11,005 --> 01:23:13,134
<i>He seems eager to communicate.</i>

374
01:23:13,217 --> 01:23:16,471
<i>I would conclude that he is a man
of some weight among his people.</i>

375
01:23:16,556 --> 01:23:17,807
Buffalo.

376
01:23:25,942 --> 01:23:29,154
<i>I believe I made an even greater impression
on their next visit.</i>

377
01:23:29,195 --> 01:23:33,452
I produced a coffee grinder,
something none of them had seen before.

378
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:16,966
Is the coffee not good?

379
01:24:18,259 --> 01:24:19,845
It's too strong, maybe.

380
01:24:22,765 --> 01:24:23,934
Sugar.

381
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:26,270
Put in.

382
01:24:36,074 --> 01:24:37,326
Taste it.

383
01:24:48,674 --> 01:24:49,843
Sugar.

384
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,388
You want some?

385
01:24:52,972 --> 01:24:54,431
You want some?

386
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,941
That's a lot.

387
01:25:08,324 --> 01:25:09,325
Okay.

388
01:25:10,077 --> 01:25:11,078
Yeah.

389
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:17,879
<i>It's good to finally have some company.</i>

390
01:25:17,962 --> 01:25:20,924
<i>So much goes unsaid
and I have the feeling that these people...</i>

391
01:25:21,008 --> 01:25:23,845
<i>the quiet one in particular,
want something from me.</i>

392
01:25:23,928 --> 01:25:26,306
<i>Made presents of coffee
and most of the sugar.</i>

393
01:25:26,347 --> 01:25:28,642
<i>It didn't figure to last anyway.</i>

394
01:25:28,726 --> 01:25:30,562
<i>Don't believe I go too far in saying...</i>

395
01:25:30,645 --> 01:25:33,441
<i>that a foundation
for good relations is being laid.</i>

396
01:29:45,308 --> 01:29:46,643
Christinel

397
01:30:02,205 --> 01:30:04,499
Get 'em, Joe! Get them chickens!

398
01:30:07,211 --> 01:30:09,840
Billy, you get away from those puppies!

399
01:30:16,515 --> 01:30:17,600
Damn!

400
01:30:18,225 --> 01:30:20,854
Get the kids, and get them in the house.

401
01:30:22,189 --> 01:30:23,357
Go on!

402
01:30:25,777 --> 01:30:27,112
Christine!

403
01:30:28,071 --> 01:30:30,783
Christine! Where are you?

404
01:30:32,619 --> 01:30:34,413
I'm up here, mother.

405
01:30:34,497 --> 01:30:36,416
- Get down now.
- Why?

406
01:30:36,499 --> 01:30:37,877
Just do it.

407
01:30:45,844 --> 01:30:49,558
Stay right where you are. Get back.
Do you hear me?

408
01:30:50,601 --> 01:30:52,896
Joe, get in the house right now!

409
01:30:59,904 --> 01:31:01,074
Willie!

410
01:31:01,699 --> 01:31:05,120
- Who is it, Willie?
- They look like Pawnee.

411
01:31:05,162 --> 01:31:08,123
My father and your father
are talking to them.

412
01:31:08,874 --> 01:31:11,419
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

413
01:31:12,254 --> 01:31:14,841
Go on. You heard him. Get out of here.

414
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,443
Run, Christine!

415
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:31,779
I said run!

416
01:31:34,491 --> 01:31:35,909
Joe!

417
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:53,265
Christine!

418
01:32:05,239 --> 01:32:06,699
Mommyl

419
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:48,545
Come on, Two Socks. Bacon.

420
01:32:48,587 --> 01:32:51,883
<i>Two Socks, like Cisco,
has become a trusted friend.</i>

421
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:54,219
<i>He still won't eat from my hand...</i>

422
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:58,557
<i>but his keen eyes and ears never fail
to alert me when something is wrong.</i>

423
01:33:23,924 --> 01:33:25,134
Tatanka.

424
01:33:27,221 --> 01:33:28,222
No.

425
01:33:28,431 --> 01:33:30,641
No, I haven't seen any buffalo.

426
01:33:31,518 --> 01:33:32,686
Sorry.

427
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:53,671
Are you hungry?

428
01:33:55,591 --> 01:33:57,092
Are you hungry?

429
01:33:57,593 --> 01:34:00,847
I have food. I have a lot of food.

430
01:34:24,503 --> 01:34:27,298
<i>Nothing I've been told
about these people is correct.</i>

431
01:34:27,382 --> 01:34:29,133
<i>They are not beggars and thieves.</i>

432
01:34:29,217 --> 01:34:32,096
<i>They are not the bogeymen
they've been made out to be.</i>

433
01:34:32,221 --> 01:34:36,477
<i>On the contrary, they are polite guests
and have a familiar humor I enjoy.</i>

434
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,688
<i>Real communication is slow, however...</i>

435
01:34:38,771 --> 01:34:41,608
<i>and the quiet one is as frustrated as I am.</i>

436
01:34:41,692 --> 01:34:44,570
<i>Most of our progress
has been built on the basis of failure...</i>

437
01:34:44,654 --> 01:34:46,531
<i>rather than success.</i>

438
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:50,537
<i>I've thought to inquire
if the woman I found lived or not...</i>

439
01:34:50,787 --> 01:34:54,542
<i>but it seems far too complicated a subject,
given our limitations.</i>

440
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:57,378
<i>One thing is clear, however.
There are no buffalo.</i>

441
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:59,881
<i>And it weighs heavy on their minds.</i>

442
01:35:00,091 --> 01:35:02,386
<i>Yesterday's meeting was the best yet.</i>

443
01:35:02,511 --> 01:35:06,808
<i>It seems I've been invited to the village
and I'm looking forward to going.</i>

444
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:02,041
Hello.

445
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,418
You...

446
01:37:05,211 --> 01:37:06,379
Here...

447
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:10,217
Good.

448
01:37:13,764 --> 01:37:15,850
Thank you. I feel good.

449
01:37:16,601 --> 01:37:17,560
I feel good.

450
01:37:28,241 --> 01:37:32,538
The soldier fort.

451
01:37:33,373 --> 01:37:34,499
Wait.

452
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:38,295
What is your names?

453
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:42,301
- Our names?
- What is his name?

454
01:37:55,192 --> 01:37:56,444
He...

455
01:37:58,154 --> 01:37:59,447
He...

456
01:38:00,491 --> 01:38:01,617
Kick.

457
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:03,661
Kick?

458
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:05,288
More.

459
01:38:05,664 --> 01:38:06,791
More kick?

460
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:08,668
More kicking?

461
01:38:09,128 --> 01:38:10,337
Kicking.

462
01:38:12,506 --> 01:38:15,009
Bird? Bird, kicking bird.

463
01:38:15,093 --> 01:38:16,761
Kicking Bird.

464
01:38:22,018 --> 01:38:23,396
What is he...

465
01:38:25,022 --> 01:38:26,399
Is he chief?

466
01:38:26,733 --> 01:38:27,776
No.

467
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:42,837
A holy man.

468
01:38:43,296 --> 01:38:45,214
Holy man.

469
01:38:50,014 --> 01:38:50,973
Your name?

470
01:38:52,767 --> 01:38:55,520
- I don't...
- How are you called?

471
01:39:26,937 --> 01:39:28,313
Get up?

472
01:39:33,111 --> 01:39:34,237
Stand up?

473
01:39:35,739 --> 01:39:37,282
Stands?

474
01:39:38,325 --> 01:39:40,371
Stands. Your name's 'Stands'?

475
01:39:40,746 --> 01:39:42,248
Stands.

476
01:39:45,544 --> 01:39:47,587
- With.
- With?

477
01:39:47,671 --> 01:39:50,633
- With.
- Stands with?

478
01:39:53,847 --> 01:39:54,931
Fist?

479
01:39:55,557 --> 01:39:56,599
Yes.

480
01:39:57,142 --> 01:39:58,894
Stands With A Fist?

481
01:40:02,231 --> 01:40:03,942
Stands With A Fist.

482
01:40:04,401 --> 01:40:05,987
I'm John Dunbar.

483
01:40:06,988 --> 01:40:09,032
John Dunbar.

484
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:16,959
Dumb Bear.

485
01:40:17,835 --> 01:40:19,713
No, not Dumb Bear.

486
01:40:20,464 --> 01:40:21,632
Dunbar.

487
01:40:22,675 --> 01:40:23,634
Dun...

488
01:40:23,718 --> 01:40:24,886
Bar.

489
01:40:25,178 --> 01:40:26,388
Not Dumb Bear.

490
01:40:26,472 --> 01:40:27,681
Dunbar.

491
01:40:45,038 --> 01:40:47,665
<i>There's been an exciting breakthrough
with the Indians.</i>

492
01:40:47,707 --> 01:40:50,044
<i>The woman I found
on the prairie speaks English...</i>

493
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,546
<i>and today, clear progress was made.</i>

494
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:56,760
<i>She is white, and though I cannot be sure
how she came to be with these people...</i>

495
01:40:56,843 --> 01:40:59,056
<i>I can tell she is not a captive.</i>

496
01:40:59,348 --> 01:41:00,724
<i>While I'm not afraid...</i>

497
01:41:00,808 --> 01:41:03,728
<i>I don't feel completely
welcome by everyone in the village.</i>

498
01:41:03,812 --> 01:41:06,607
<i>My being here must be Kicking Bird's idea.</i>

499
01:41:06,982 --> 01:41:09,610
<i>He is very enthusiastic
and like two children...</i>

500
01:41:09,693 --> 01:41:12,615
<i>we are both anxious
to know more about each other.</i>

501
01:41:12,698 --> 01:41:14,909
<i>But I find myself holding back.</i>

502
01:41:14,992 --> 01:41:18,455
<i>For some reason, I am reluctant
to answer all his questions.</i>

503
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:19,998
<i>Maybe it's my sense of duty...</i>

504
01:41:20,082 --> 01:41:22,710
<i>but something tells me not to say too much.</i>

505
01:41:35,185 --> 01:41:37,396
<i>It was good to see Fort Sedgewick again...</i>

506
01:41:37,438 --> 01:41:41,277
<i>and yet I look forward
to another visit with my new neighbors.</i>

507
01:41:44,072 --> 01:41:45,740
<i>This is still my home, however...</i>

508
01:41:45,824 --> 01:41:48,578
<i>and I remain watchful
for my relief and can only hope...</i>

509
01:41:48,661 --> 01:41:52,917
<i>that my negotiations with the wild
people of the plains will bear fruit.</i>

510
01:44:00,248 --> 01:44:01,166
Buffalo!

511
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:05,214
Buffalo! I've seen buffalo!

512
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:37,129
Buffaloes!

513
01:44:37,463 --> 01:44:38,923
Tatanka.

514
01:44:40,633 --> 01:44:42,010
Tatanka?

515
01:44:42,094 --> 01:44:43,178
Yeah.

516
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,196
<i>Riders were sent out to pick up the trail.</i>

517
01:45:28,404 --> 01:45:31,158
<i>In the time it took to gather
my things at Sedgewick...</i>

518
01:45:31,241 --> 01:45:33,744
<i>the entire tribe was well on its way.</i>

519
01:45:33,994 --> 01:45:36,748
<i>The efficiency of the people
and the speed of which they moved...</i>

520
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:39,752
<i>was enough to impress
any military commander.</i>

521
01:45:40,086 --> 01:45:43,882
<i>Spirits are high, and overnight
I've gone from a person of suspicion...</i>

522
01:45:43,924 --> 01:45:46,052
<i>to one of genuine standing.</i>

523
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:49,848
<i>I am greeted with open smiles
and looks of appreciation.</i>

524
01:45:49,932 --> 01:45:52,101
<i>In short, I have become a celebrity.</i>

525
01:45:52,185 --> 01:45:53,561
Loo ten tant!

526
01:45:53,771 --> 01:45:56,398
- Loo ten tant!
- Loo ten tant!

527
01:45:57,566 --> 01:46:00,695
<i>Scouts picked up the trail
exactly where I said it would be.</i>

528
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:03,449
<i>It was not hard to find...</i>

529
01:46:03,533 --> 01:46:07,455
<i>a gigantic swath of torn-up ground
extending to the horizon.</i>

530
01:46:07,539 --> 01:46:10,750
<i>The sheer numbers it took to create
this impossible image...</i>

531
01:46:10,792 --> 01:46:12,586
<i>was hard to imagine.</i>

532
01:47:39,115 --> 01:47:40,492
Loo ten tant!

533
01:47:42,702 --> 01:47:44,038
Loo ten tant!

534
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:13,272
<i>Who would do such a thing?</i>

535
01:50:13,355 --> 01:50:14,733
<i>The field was proof enough...</i>

536
01:50:14,774 --> 01:50:17,820
<i>that it was a people
without value and without soul.</i>

537
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:20,365
<i>With no regard for Sioux rights.</i>

538
01:50:20,907 --> 01:50:23,828
<i>The wagon tracks
leading away left little doubt...</i>

539
01:50:23,912 --> 01:50:27,583
<i>and my heart sank,
as I knew it could only be white hunters.</i>

540
01:50:27,833 --> 01:50:29,961
<i>Voices that had been joyous all morning...</i>

541
01:50:30,045 --> 01:50:34,050
<i>were now as silent as the dead buffalo
left to rot in this valley...</i>

542
01:50:34,133 --> 01:50:37,804
<i>killed only for their tongues
and the price of their hides.</i>

543
01:51:18,023 --> 01:51:19,358
Loo ten tant.

544
01:55:08,447 --> 01:55:11,117
<i>It was suddenly clear now
what had happened...</i>

545
01:55:11,159 --> 01:55:13,703
<i>and my heart sank
as I tried to convince myself...</i>

546
01:55:13,786 --> 01:55:17,624
<i>that the white men who'd been killed
were bad people and deserved to die.</i>

547
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,544
<i>But it was no use.</i>

548
01:55:19,627 --> 01:55:22,265
<i>I tried to believe
that Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird...</i>

549
01:55:22,348 --> 01:55:26,562
<i>and the others who shared in the killing
were not so happy for having done it.</i>

550
01:55:26,645 --> 01:55:28,306
<i>But they were.</i>

551
01:55:30,183 --> 01:55:33,562
<i>As I looked at familiar faces,
I realized that the gap between us...</i>

552
01:55:33,645 --> 01:55:36,424
<i>was greater than I could
ever have imagined.</i>

553
01:55:56,017 --> 01:55:59,203
<i>As they celebrated into the night
the coming hunt...</i>

554
01:55:59,287 --> 01:56:01,683
<i>it was hard to know where to be.</i>

555
01:56:02,166 --> 01:56:06,088
<i>I don't know if they understood,
but I could not sleep among them.</i>

556
01:56:06,113 --> 01:56:09,359
<i>There had been no looks,
and there was no blame.</i>

557
01:56:09,451 --> 01:56:13,906
<i>There was only the confusion of a people
not able to predict a future.</i>

558
02:03:06,024 --> 02:03:07,525
Are you all right?

559
02:03:07,725 --> 02:03:09,625
Are you all right?

560
02:04:57,175 --> 02:04:58,627
I can't.

561
02:04:59,453 --> 02:05:01,890
No, I'm full.

562
02:05:01,974 --> 02:05:05,553
I'm full, and I can't
tell the story anymore.

563
02:05:06,922 --> 02:05:07,890
<i>No.</i>

564
02:05:15,365 --> 02:05:17,034
Do you want to try it?

565
02:05:17,852 --> 02:05:19,821
Do you want to try it?

566
02:05:23,151 --> 02:05:24,535
Here.

567
02:05:54,374 --> 02:05:56,576
I can't. This is too much.

568
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:05,046
Good trade.

569
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:10,302
This is a good trade.

570
02:06:15,152 --> 02:06:17,980
No, no, I can't.
I'm full, I'm tired.

571
02:06:18,063 --> 02:06:19,106
No!

572
02:06:29,537 --> 02:06:31,706
Loo ten tant! Loo ten tant!

573
02:06:39,558 --> 02:06:41,852
Tatanka. Big tatanka.

574
02:06:41,936 --> 02:06:43,355
Big tatanka.

575
02:07:13,351 --> 02:07:14,437
That's my hat!

576
02:07:24,867 --> 02:07:26,452
You're wearing my hat.

577
02:07:30,373 --> 02:07:31,751
It's my hat.

578
02:07:36,883 --> 02:07:38,634
No, you...

579
02:07:40,094 --> 02:07:41,305
My hat.

580
02:09:04,997 --> 02:09:06,373
Good trade.

581
02:11:19,128 --> 02:11:20,672
There you are.

582
02:11:20,756 --> 02:11:22,382
Come here, Cisco.

583
02:12:19,015 --> 02:12:22,051
<i>It seems every day ends
with a miracle here.</i>

584
02:12:22,134 --> 02:12:25,390
<i>And whatever God may be,
I thank God for this day.</i>

585
02:12:26,558 --> 02:12:28,936
<i>To stay any longer would have been useless.</i>

586
02:12:29,061 --> 02:12:31,939
<i>We had all the meat we
could possibly carry.</i>

587
02:12:32,231 --> 02:12:35,151
<i>We had hunted for three days,
losing a half a dozen ponies...</i>

588
02:12:35,235 --> 02:12:37,280
<i>and only three men injured.</i>

589
02:12:37,864 --> 02:12:40,225
<i>I'd never known a people
so eager to laugh...</i>

590
02:12:40,309 --> 02:12:43,580
<i>so devoted to family,
so dedicated to each other.</i>

591
02:12:44,247 --> 02:12:47,293
<i>And the only word
that came to mind was 'harmony.</i>

592
02:12:56,430 --> 02:12:58,557
<i>Many times I've felt alone...</i>

593
02:12:58,724 --> 02:13:00,768
<i>but until this afternoon...</i>

594
02:13:00,852 --> 02:13:02,646
<i>I'd never felt completely lonely.</i>

595
02:13:10,761 --> 02:13:12,806
<i>Made a long patrol today.</i>

596
02:13:13,181 --> 02:13:15,225
<i>There's nothing to report.</i>

597
02:13:15,475 --> 02:13:18,355
<i>Time seems irrelevant
except for the fact that I am bored...</i>

598
02:13:18,439 --> 02:13:20,817
<i>and these hours alone are endless.</i>

599
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:43,261
<i>It is difficult for me to
muster any enthusiasm...</i>

600
02:13:43,303 --> 02:13:45,515
<i>for my regular duties here.</i>

601
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:48,102
<i>And the fort is showing
serious signs of neglect.</i>

602
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:54,443
<i>The truth is,
I am missing the company of my friends.</i>

603
02:13:54,485 --> 02:13:58,115
<i>I can see all of their faces,
but somehow it is not enough.</i>

604
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:00,284
<i>Tomorrow I will pay them a visit.</i>

605
02:14:00,368 --> 02:14:03,163
<i>It may be forward of me,
but what can it hurt?</i>

606
02:14:03,538 --> 02:14:05,874
<i>After all, they are my neighbors.</i>

607
02:15:20,055 --> 02:15:23,851
<i>The night sounds have become so familiar
as to be comforting.</i>

608
02:15:24,018 --> 02:15:28,398
<i>My life on the prairie's a good one
and for the most part, I am content.</i>

609
02:15:42,291 --> 02:15:46,129
<i>The Indians have a great pull for me
that goes beyond curiosity.</i>

610
02:15:46,171 --> 02:15:49,008
<i>There's something wise about them
and I'm drawn to them...</i>

611
02:15:49,092 --> 02:15:52,596
<i>in ways much stronger
than my obligations to the military.</i>

612
02:17:11,348 --> 02:17:12,541
Go home!

613
02:17:12,941 --> 02:17:14,341
Go home!

614
02:17:16,287 --> 02:17:17,581
Damn him.

615
02:17:37,857 --> 02:17:39,526
God! Go home!

616
02:17:45,243 --> 02:17:46,244
Go!

617
02:17:46,577 --> 02:17:48,287
Go home, Two Socks!

618
02:17:49,706 --> 02:17:51,125
Bad wolf!

619
02:18:54,332 --> 02:18:58,670
<i>It is autumn now and I am spending
more time than ever with my friends.</i>

620
02:18:58,712 --> 02:19:02,341
<i>They have given me my own lodge
and I feel comfortable there.</i>

621
02:19:02,424 --> 02:19:06,472
<i>We talk every day, but I know
Kicking Bird is frustrated with me.</i>

622
02:19:06,555 --> 02:19:10,018
<i>He always wants to know
how many more white people are coming.</i>

623
02:19:10,227 --> 02:19:14,941
<i>I tell him they will most likely
pass through this country and nothing more.</i>

624
02:19:15,108 --> 02:19:17,237
<i>But I am speaking in half-truths.</i>

625
02:19:17,403 --> 02:19:21,951
<i>One day there will be too many,
but I cannot bring myself to tell him that.</i>

626
02:19:22,076 --> 02:19:25,330
<i>I am sure that Stands With A Fist
knows that I am holding back...</i>

627
02:19:25,622 --> 02:19:28,125
but to her credit, she says nothing.

628
02:19:56,996 --> 02:20:01,168
<i>A war party is going against the
Pawnee soon and I have asked to go.</i>

629
02:20:01,293 --> 02:20:03,463
<i>I sense I made a mistake in doing so...</i>

630
02:20:03,546 --> 02:20:06,425
<i>but I could not bring
myself to take it back.</i>

631
02:20:06,467 --> 02:20:09,178
<i>They are my friends,
and from what little I gather...</i>

632
02:20:09,261 --> 02:20:11,766
<i>the Pawnee have been
very hard on these people.</i>

633
02:20:11,849 --> 02:20:14,560
<i>I hope I have not overstepped my bounds.</i>

634
02:20:18,982 --> 02:20:20,568
Come in, please.

635
02:20:23,030 --> 02:20:24,281
Sit down?

636
02:20:27,786 --> 02:20:29,872
Kicking Bird want to know...

637
02:20:29,955 --> 02:20:33,542
why you want to make war on the Pawnee.

638
02:20:34,169 --> 02:20:36,881
They have done nothing to you.

639
02:20:37,548 --> 02:20:39,426
They are Sioux enemies.

640
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:49,731
Only Sioux warriors to go.

641
02:20:50,690 --> 02:20:52,268
Well then tell him
that I have been a warrior...

642
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:55,988
longer than many of the young men
who will go on this war party.

643
02:20:56,148 --> 02:20:57,499
Tell him.

644
02:21:12,201 --> 02:21:15,556
He said that the Sioux way
of being a warrior...

645
02:21:15,639 --> 02:21:17,559
is not the white way.

646
02:21:17,943 --> 02:21:21,789
- You are not ready.
- I know, I understand. But thell him...

647
02:21:21,831 --> 02:21:24,818
Tell him that
I cannot learn these ways in camp.

648
02:21:31,844 --> 02:21:34,214
He also asks that you...

649
02:21:35,215 --> 02:21:38,678
watch over his family while he is gone.

650
02:21:39,479 --> 02:21:43,434
This thing he asks is a
great honor for you.

651
02:21:46,881 --> 02:21:50,902
Tell him that I would be happy
to watch over his family.

652
02:21:57,227 --> 02:22:00,081
He thanks Dances With Wolves for coming.

653
02:22:01,582 --> 02:22:03,584
Who is Dances With Wolves?

654
02:22:05,546 --> 02:22:09,050
It is the name which all the people...

655
02:22:09,135 --> 02:22:10,928
are calling you now.

656
02:22:11,470 --> 02:22:12,972
Dances With...

657
02:22:14,433 --> 02:22:15,934
That's right.

658
02:22:16,351 --> 02:22:17,644
That day.

659
02:22:18,896 --> 02:22:20,565
Dances With Wolves.

660
02:22:22,234 --> 02:22:23,903
How do you say it?

661
02:24:12,136 --> 02:24:13,587
I'm here.

662
02:24:16,758 --> 02:24:18,176
We walk.

663
02:24:51,302 --> 02:24:52,845
I cut this off.

664
02:24:53,647 --> 02:24:56,141
I shaved it off. More.

665
02:24:58,311 --> 02:25:00,438
Grass grows on the prairie.

666
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:01,983
<i>Grass grows on the prairie'?</i>

667
02:25:04,236 --> 02:25:05,696
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

668
02:25:05,779 --> 02:25:07,949
<i>You said, "Fire lives on the prairie"</i>

669
02:25:07,991 --> 02:25:09,242
I did?

670
02:25:09,909 --> 02:25:12,871
No laughing, though.

671
02:25:16,877 --> 02:25:19,714
That man is a fighter.

672
02:25:23,969 --> 02:25:25,179
Again.

673
02:25:25,972 --> 02:25:29,351
- That man is a fighter.
- Okay, I have it.

674
02:25:33,023 --> 02:25:34,149
Yes.

675
02:25:41,576 --> 02:25:43,329
Hoo hoo, right?

676
02:25:48,877 --> 02:25:49,836
No?

677
02:25:58,973 --> 02:26:00,308
Try this.

678
02:26:02,561 --> 02:26:04,229
What's the word...

679
02:26:04,772 --> 02:26:06,316
for beautiful?

680
02:27:45,527 --> 02:27:47,572
How did you get your name?

681
02:27:51,869 --> 02:27:54,790
I was not very old...

682
02:27:55,750 --> 02:27:58,211
when I came to be with the people.

683
02:27:59,045 --> 02:28:00,964
And I was made to work.

684
02:28:02,091 --> 02:28:04,218
I worked every day, very hard.

685
02:28:05,970 --> 02:28:09,351
There was a woman...

686
02:28:09,393 --> 02:28:11,395
who didn't like me much.

687
02:28:12,979 --> 02:28:17,068
She used to call me bad names,
and sometimes she...

688
02:28:21,658 --> 02:28:22,910
Beat me?

689
02:28:26,914 --> 02:28:28,667
And one day, she was...

690
02:28:29,501 --> 02:28:31,712
calling me these bad names...

691
02:28:32,088 --> 02:28:34,633
with her face in my face...

692
02:28:35,592 --> 02:28:36,928
and I hit her.

693
02:28:38,888 --> 02:28:42,017
I was not very big, but she fell down.

694
02:28:42,268 --> 02:28:44,478
She fell hard and didn't move.

695
02:28:45,897 --> 02:28:49,277
And then I stood over her with my fist...

696
02:28:49,485 --> 02:28:50,821
and I asked if...

697
02:28:51,238 --> 02:28:53,532
there was any other woman...

698
02:28:54,116 --> 02:28:56,411
who wanted to call me bad names.

699
02:28:58,329 --> 02:29:00,751
No one bothered me after that day.

700
02:29:03,796 --> 02:29:06,799
No, I wouldn't think so.

701
02:29:11,889 --> 02:29:13,266
Show me.

702
02:29:14,310 --> 02:29:16,312
Show me where you hit her.

703
02:29:45,058 --> 02:29:47,018
Why are you not married?

704
02:29:51,065 --> 02:29:52,566
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

705
02:29:55,488 --> 02:29:56,823
I'm sorry.

706
02:29:58,992 --> 02:30:00,160
Can I help you?

707
02:32:06,366 --> 02:32:07,534
I don't...

708
02:36:12,184 --> 02:36:14,102
Bet you were thinking:

709
02:36:14,186 --> 02:36:16,188
<i>Now, why don't he write?</i>

710
02:36:17,023 --> 02:36:18,692
Hello, Two Socks.

711
02:36:46,186 --> 02:36:47,437
Come on.

712
02:36:52,068 --> 02:36:55,656
I won't hurt you.
Come on. You can do this.

713
02:36:56,031 --> 02:36:57,658
You can do this.

714
02:37:02,039 --> 02:37:03,208
Come on.

715
02:37:15,348 --> 02:37:16,809
This is easy.

716
02:37:17,351 --> 02:37:19,270
This is easy, Two Socks.

717
02:38:40,709 --> 02:38:42,377
I am in mourning.

718
02:38:51,724 --> 02:38:53,225
No, we cannot.

719
02:38:53,517 --> 02:38:56,438
- Yes.
- We must be careful.

720
02:38:58,482 --> 02:38:59,901
We must be careful.

721
02:38:59,984 --> 02:39:01,445
Okay.

722
02:40:05,278 --> 02:40:06,362
Wait!

723
02:42:12,650 --> 02:42:13,735
What?

724
02:42:14,569 --> 02:42:15,778
Trouble.

725
02:42:39,434 --> 02:42:42,855
The Pawnee are coming.
A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.

726
02:42:42,938 --> 02:42:45,443
Hunters found them not far to the north.
Soon be here.

727
02:44:17,103 --> 02:44:18,104
Okay!

728
02:46:52,771 --> 02:46:54,272
Shoot the gun!

729
02:51:21,962 --> 02:51:24,090
<i>It was hard to know how to feel.</i>

730
02:51:24,173 --> 02:51:26,759
<i>I'd never been in a battle like this one.</i>

731
02:51:26,843 --> 02:51:29,513
<i>There was no dark political objective.</i>

732
02:51:29,596 --> 02:51:33,602
<i>This was not a fight for territory
or riches or to make men free.</i>

733
02:51:33,686 --> 02:51:37,607
<i>It was fought to preserve the food stores
that would see us through the winter.</i>

734
02:51:37,649 --> 02:51:42,113
<i>To protect the lives of women and children
and loved ones only a few feet away.</i>

735
02:51:42,363 --> 02:51:46,034
<i>Stone Calf was a great loss,
but even the old men could not remember...</i>

736
02:51:46,118 --> 02:51:48,079
<i>such a one-sided victory.</i>

737
02:51:48,163 --> 02:51:51,125
<i>And I gradually began
to look at it in a new way.</i>

738
02:51:51,333 --> 02:51:53,878
<i>I felt a pride I'd never felt before.</i>

739
02:51:54,670 --> 02:51:57,507
<i>I'd never really known who John Dunbar was.</i>

740
02:51:57,841 --> 02:52:00,387
<i>Perhaps the name itself had no meaning.</i>

741
02:52:00,471 --> 02:52:03,640
<i>But as I heard my Sioux name
being called over and over...</i>

742
02:52:03,682 --> 02:52:06,561
<i>I knew for the first time who I really was.</i>

743
02:59:18,913 --> 02:59:22,626
<i>The whole village was eager
to take up a collection on my behalf.</i>

744
02:59:22,751 --> 02:59:25,712
<i>The generosity of the
people was astonishing.</i>

745
02:59:25,754 --> 02:59:29,133
<i>The more valued the gift,
the more easily it was given.</i>

746
02:59:29,259 --> 02:59:33,598
<i>Even the poorer families wanted to give
up animals they could not afford.</i>

747
02:59:33,723 --> 02:59:35,935
<i>It was hard to turn them away.</i>

748
02:59:40,649 --> 02:59:42,693
<i>Black Shawl was a mystery.</i>

749
02:59:43,443 --> 02:59:46,949
<i>I couldn't guess what she was thinking
and she offered no advice...</i>

750
02:59:47,449 --> 02:59:49,494
<i>no words of encouragement.</i>

751
02:59:55,293 --> 02:59:57,628
<i>I may have been the brunt
of an inside joke...</i>

752
02:59:57,712 --> 03:00:00,049
<i>that included the entire village...</i>

753
03:00:00,174 --> 03:00:02,010
<i>but I was determined.</i>

754
03:00:05,347 --> 03:00:08,768
<i>Wind In His Hair told me if all the
gifts were gone in the morning...</i>

755
03:00:08,810 --> 03:00:10,937
<i>my offer had been accepted.</i>

756
03:00:11,982 --> 03:00:16,236
<i>I spent a sleepless night
wondering what misstep, if any, I had made.</i>

757
03:00:17,155 --> 03:00:20,491
<i>I had no idea
what Kicking Bird's decision would be.</i>

758
03:01:54,655 --> 03:01:56,032
And for me.

759
03:02:18,061 --> 03:02:20,147
<i>I had never been married before.</i>

760
03:02:20,231 --> 03:02:23,150
<i>I don't know if all grooms
have the same experience...</i>

761
03:02:23,234 --> 03:02:27,215
<i>but as Kicking Bird began to speak about
what was expected of a Sioux husband...</i>

762
03:02:27,357 --> 03:02:31,053
<i>my mind began to swim in a way that
shut out everything but her...</i>

763
03:02:31,095 --> 03:02:33,690
<i>the tiny details of her costume...</i>

764
03:02:33,773 --> 03:02:35,959
<i>the contours of her shape...</i>

765
03:02:36,209 --> 03:02:37,829
<i>the light in her eyes...</i>

766
03:02:37,996 --> 03:02:40,340
<i>the smallness of her feet.</i>

767
03:02:40,849 --> 03:02:43,886
<i>I knew that the love
between us would be served.</i>

768
03:02:55,359 --> 03:02:56,361
Yes.

769
03:03:06,124 --> 03:03:07,417
Good.

770
03:03:18,014 --> 03:03:19,057
Bye.

771
03:03:24,480 --> 03:03:25,523
Bye.

772
03:13:43,391 --> 03:13:46,386
You have everything
from the soldier fort?

773
03:13:46,636 --> 03:13:47,879
Yes.

774
03:13:48,013 --> 03:13:50,140
There's nothing for me there.

775
03:14:06,120 --> 03:14:07,497
The journal.

776
03:14:09,749 --> 03:14:11,460
Stands With... Wait!

777
03:14:11,836 --> 03:14:13,003
Words are important!

778
03:14:13,087 --> 03:14:15,465
The words in the book
are like a trail for people to follow.

779
03:14:15,507 --> 03:14:19,303
Now, it tells everything about
my life here. I must get it.

780
03:14:20,312 --> 03:14:21,481
Enough.

781
03:14:36,141 --> 03:14:38,253
I'll catch up.

782
03:15:18,990 --> 03:15:20,016
Injun!

783
03:15:20,433 --> 03:15:21,934
Get him! Injun!

784
03:15:27,568 --> 03:15:28,569
No!

785
03:15:50,180 --> 03:15:52,390
Stay down. Stay.

786
03:15:52,766 --> 03:15:54,185
My God.

787
03:15:54,853 --> 03:15:56,104
God.

788
03:16:01,778 --> 03:16:03,029
It's okay.

789
03:17:10,992 --> 03:17:12,369
Spivey.

790
03:17:13,246 --> 03:17:15,457
- Spivey!
- Yeah, Sergeant.

791
03:17:16,542 --> 03:17:18,753
Tell the major he's waking up.

792
03:17:20,671 --> 03:17:22,591
Move your worthless ass.

793
03:17:34,147 --> 03:17:36,192
You got yourself a hell of a shiner...

794
03:17:36,984 --> 03:17:38,277
didn't you?

795
03:17:38,361 --> 03:17:40,048
<i>Major's coming through.</i>

796
03:17:50,443 --> 03:17:52,421
Does he speak English?

797
03:17:52,588 --> 03:17:54,216
I don't know, sir.

798
03:17:56,009 --> 03:17:57,804
Speak English?

799
03:17:59,597 --> 03:18:02,184
Talk English? Talk!

800
03:18:03,836 --> 03:18:05,564
I speak English.

801
03:18:10,111 --> 03:18:11,488
Who are you?

802
03:18:13,657 --> 03:18:17,870
Lt. John J. Dunbar.
This is my post.

803
03:18:18,454 --> 03:18:20,165
Why are you dressed like this?

804
03:18:22,419 --> 03:18:26,257
I came out from Fort Hayes last April,
but there was nobody here.

805
03:18:26,841 --> 03:18:28,843
Do you have proof of that?

806
03:18:31,388 --> 03:18:35,686
My journal's on the bunk in my quarters.
My orders are in the journal.

807
03:18:35,769 --> 03:18:37,896
It will tell you everything.

808
03:18:38,188 --> 03:18:40,817
Spivey, you and Edwards
were the first ones here.

809
03:18:40,900 --> 03:18:43,237
Did you find anything?
A journal?

810
03:18:43,571 --> 03:18:45,908
No, we didn't find nothing, sir.

811
03:18:46,325 --> 03:18:47,911
Where's Edwards?

812
03:18:48,411 --> 03:18:49,871
He's outside.

813
03:18:54,501 --> 03:18:56,922
He didn't find nothing either.

814
03:19:01,135 --> 03:19:03,472
<i>Somebody find me Edwards.</i>

815
03:19:12,233 --> 03:19:13,944
You turned Injun, didn't you?

816
03:19:19,033 --> 03:19:20,410
Didn't you?

817
03:19:25,083 --> 03:19:27,336
What did you say your name was?

818
03:19:28,045 --> 03:19:29,214
Dunbar.

819
03:19:30,298 --> 03:19:32,617
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.

820
03:19:32,701 --> 03:19:34,804
You say you're an officer?

821
03:19:35,054 --> 03:19:38,393
- God. Did you read my orders?
- No.

822
03:19:39,560 --> 03:19:41,646
Well they're in my journal.

823
03:19:41,896 --> 03:19:43,607
There are no orders.

824
03:19:44,066 --> 03:19:45,818
There's no journal.

825
03:19:50,240 --> 03:19:52,286
Why are you out of uniform?

826
03:19:54,663 --> 03:19:56,416
I have to relieve myself.

827
03:19:59,627 --> 03:20:02,381
- Sergeant, take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

828
03:20:04,008 --> 03:20:05,219
Let's go.

829
03:20:09,223 --> 03:20:11,993
- He's a white man.
- Doesn't look white to me.

830
03:20:12,085 --> 03:20:15,389
- They say he's a soldier.
- He's an officer.

831
03:20:15,473 --> 03:20:18,108
Do you salute him or shoot him?

832
03:20:26,120 --> 03:20:28,598
Here, you. Eyes front.

833
03:20:33,681 --> 03:20:35,707
I said eyes front!

834
03:20:38,052 --> 03:20:40,413
Don't shoot him!
Hit him! Get him!

835
03:20:40,596 --> 03:20:42,389
Get him!

836
03:21:32,072 --> 03:21:33,974
Why are you out of uniform?

837
03:21:37,980 --> 03:21:39,582
What's the army doing out here?

838
03:21:40,625 --> 03:21:43,212
- Lieutenant's asking the questions.
- Bauer.

839
03:21:49,269 --> 03:21:51,606
We're charged with apprehending...

840
03:21:54,527 --> 03:21:57,989
We're charged with apprehending hostiles
and recovering stolen property...

841
03:21:58,072 --> 03:22:00,868
retrieving white captives
taken in hostile raidings.

842
03:22:00,951 --> 03:22:04,915
- There are no hostiles.
- We will ascertain that for ourselves.

843
03:22:04,999 --> 03:22:08,044
If you'll guide us to these camps
and serve as an interpreter...

844
03:22:08,086 --> 03:22:10,505
your conduct will be re-evaluated.

845
03:22:11,006 --> 03:22:13,051
- What conduct?
- With all due respect...

846
03:22:13,092 --> 03:22:16,387
Your status as a traitor might improve
should you choose...

847
03:22:16,471 --> 03:22:19,225
to cooperate with the United States Army.

848
03:22:21,019 --> 03:22:23,356
There's nothing for you to do out here.

849
03:22:26,985 --> 03:22:29,488
Are you willing to cooperate or not?

850
03:22:32,242 --> 03:22:33,744
Speak up!

851
03:22:43,089 --> 03:22:43,964
What's that?

852
03:23:02,782 --> 03:23:06,452
Sergeant, form a detail
and take this man down to the river.

853
03:23:07,329 --> 03:23:10,165
- Let him clean up his face.
- Yes, sir.

854
03:23:12,253 --> 03:23:13,754
Not you, Spivey.

855
03:23:41,832 --> 03:23:43,167
Lieutenant.

856
03:23:45,754 --> 03:23:47,714
Major wants to see you.

857
03:24:22,009 --> 03:24:23,427
Spivey.

858
03:24:28,433 --> 03:24:30,479
Spivey. You got paper?

859
03:24:31,105 --> 03:24:34,567
- What's it to you?
- Give me some, shit-bird.

860
03:24:34,943 --> 03:24:35,985
Can you read?

861
03:24:36,152 --> 03:24:38,363
No, I can't read.
What the hell's the difference?

862
03:24:38,446 --> 03:24:41,409
You can't read either.
Now just give me some.

863
03:24:41,909 --> 03:24:45,748
- Quick, give me some!
- All right. Hold your horses.

864
03:26:07,896 --> 03:26:09,064
Bauer!

865
03:26:12,693 --> 03:26:13,986
Let go of me!

866
03:26:22,248 --> 03:26:25,127
Lap it up, Injun. Go ahead. Lap it up.

867
03:26:27,880 --> 03:26:29,632
You son of a bitch!

868
03:26:32,554 --> 03:26:34,055
It's all right.

869
03:26:34,764 --> 03:26:36,307
It's all right.

870
03:26:36,891 --> 03:26:41,063
He's going to get hungrier, that's all.
But maybe that don't matter.

871
03:26:41,857 --> 03:26:44,861
Word is they're going to
ship you back to Hayes.

872
03:26:44,944 --> 03:26:47,614
And once you get there,
they gonna hang you.

873
03:26:51,286 --> 03:26:54,289
Come on. Forget about him.
Go on. Get out of here.

874
03:27:09,392 --> 03:27:10,561
Get up in there!

875
03:27:36,553 --> 03:27:38,555
Spivey, what is that?

876
03:27:38,972 --> 03:27:41,142
Looks like he's following us.

877
03:27:41,393 --> 03:27:43,144
Hell, I'm going to shoot him.

878
03:27:44,270 --> 03:27:45,439
Dang. You missed him.

879
03:27:46,482 --> 03:27:49,402
- Don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot.
- Wait. I seen him first.

880
03:27:49,486 --> 03:27:51,322
- Get down!
- Look at that stupid bastard.

881
03:27:51,406 --> 03:27:53,157
He ain't even moving.

882
03:27:53,699 --> 03:27:57,329
- Wait a minute! That's my shot.
- Shoot him!

883
03:27:58,414 --> 03:28:00,875
Shoot him, Edwards. He's standing there.

884
03:28:01,334 --> 03:28:02,210
Shoot him!

885
03:28:05,549 --> 03:28:07,634
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!

886
03:28:12,223 --> 03:28:14,059
Bauer, get him off him!

887
03:28:20,860 --> 03:28:22,404
He might have killed you.

888
03:28:30,247 --> 03:28:31,750
I'll get that son of a bitch.

889
03:28:38,340 --> 03:28:40,010
Sit down, goddamn it!

890
03:28:52,358 --> 03:28:53,944
That's it. I got him!

891
03:28:57,449 --> 03:28:59,577
Dead shot, boys. Come on.

892
03:29:00,995 --> 03:29:02,538
Son of a bitch!

893
03:29:03,123 --> 03:29:04,333
Get up!

894
03:29:06,001 --> 03:29:07,086
Get up!

895
03:29:08,630 --> 03:29:10,424
I mean it! Get up!

896
03:29:10,508 --> 03:29:12,511
Get up! Come on, get up!

897
03:29:13,053 --> 03:29:14,096
What?

898
03:29:14,179 --> 03:29:17,433
You bash that prisoner one more time,
I'll put those shackles on you.

899
03:29:18,476 --> 03:29:20,645
You men get back here!

900
03:29:24,275 --> 03:29:25,653
Goddamn it!

901
03:30:04,527 --> 03:30:05,245
Boo.

902
03:30:13,797 --> 03:30:16,093
<i>Clear behind that stand of trees?</i>

903
03:30:20,307 --> 03:30:22,058
All right. Let's go.

904
03:30:45,589 --> 03:30:46,882
I don't see nobody.

905
03:31:05,614 --> 03:31:06,825
Indians!

906
03:34:51,330 --> 03:34:52,289
No.

907
03:40:14,468 --> 03:40:16,905
<i>With Ten Bears,
it was always more than a while.</i>

908
03:40:17,188 --> 03:40:20,984
<i>There was purpose in everything he did
and I knew he wanted me to stay.</i>

909
03:40:21,067 --> 03:40:22,737
<i>But I was sure of myself.</i>

910
03:40:22,820 --> 03:40:26,993
<i>I would be an excuse and that's all
the army would need to find this place.</i>

911
03:40:27,076 --> 03:40:29,746
<i>I pushed him as far as I could
to move the camp...</i>

912
03:40:29,829 --> 03:40:33,208
<i>but in the end he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures.</i>

913
03:40:33,292 --> 03:40:37,547
<i>He reminded me that at his age
a good fire is better than anything.</i>

914
03:40:37,964 --> 03:40:40,385
<i>Ten Bears was an extraordinary man.</i>

915
03:41:21,530 --> 03:41:23,507
You have nothing to say?

916
03:41:25,985 --> 03:41:27,779
What can I tell you?

917
03:41:29,247 --> 03:41:31,209
What's ever on your mind.

918
03:41:37,842 --> 03:41:39,845
You've made the decision.

919
03:41:44,509 --> 03:41:46,503
My place is with you.

920
03:41:47,063 --> 03:41:48,732
I go where you go.

921
03:41:52,478 --> 03:41:54,447
You're not afraid?

922
03:41:55,331 --> 03:41:56,374
No.

923
03:41:59,538 --> 03:42:02,625
I told Ten Bears
we'd leave when the snow breaks.

924
03:42:09,758 --> 03:42:11,637
Did you tell everyone?

925
03:42:15,684 --> 03:42:17,143
Not everyone.

926
03:43:28,861 --> 03:43:30,238
You...

927
03:43:31,281 --> 03:43:32,825
finish your pipe?

928
03:43:45,967 --> 03:43:47,261
Good pipe.

929
03:43:48,762 --> 03:43:50,097
How...

930
03:43:50,640 --> 03:43:52,016
does it smoke?

931
03:43:55,145 --> 03:43:56,689
I've never smoked it.

932
03:44:08,495 --> 03:44:09,872
We come far...

933
03:44:10,290 --> 03:44:11,625
you and me.

934
03:44:14,337 --> 03:44:16,214
I will not forget you.

935
03:47:49,782 --> 03:47:51,784
Sergeant!
Over here! Now!
