1
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:24,818
We're just two little girls
From Little Rock

2
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:30,615
We lived on the wrong side
Of the tracks

3
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:33,284
But the gentlemen friends
Who used to call

4
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:35,870
They never did seem to mind at all

5
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:41,042
They came to the wrong side
Of the tracks

6
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:47,132
Then someone broke my heart
In Little Rock

7
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,637
So I up and left the pieces there

8
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:55,640
Like a little lost lamb I roamed about

9
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,351
I came to New York and I found out

10
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:03,356
That men are the same way everywhere

11
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:09,988
I was young and determined
To be wined and dined and ermined

12
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:14,659
And I worked at it
All around the clock

13
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,329
Now one of these days
In my fancy clothes

14
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:24,043
I'm goin' back home and punch the nose
Of the one who broke my heart

15
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:27,005
The one who broke my heart

16
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:30,717
The one who broke my heart
In Little Rock

17
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,929
Little Rock, Little Rock
Little Rock

18
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:10,650
I learned an awful lot in Little Rock

19
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,322
And here's some advice
I’d like to share

20
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,659
Find a gentleman

21
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:25,290
Who is shy or bold

22
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,794
Or short or tall

23
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:35,800
Or young or old

24
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:41,014
As long as the guy's a millionaire

25
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:46,978
For a kid from a small street
I did very well on Wall Street

26
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:52,650
Though I never owned a share of stock

27
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,236
And now that I'm known
In the biggest banks

28
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:58,072
I’m a-goin' back home
And give my thanks

29
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:01,034
To the one who broke my heart

30
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,745
The one who broke my heart

31
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:07,498
The one who broke my heart

32
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:16,215
In Little Rock

33
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,857
Dorothy, wait a minute.

34
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:40,740
Louie, ask Mr. Esmond to come
to our dressing room.

35
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,033
Yes, Miss Blake.

36
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,827
Why the rush? He won't run away.

37
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,246
- I know, but I can't wait.
- For what?

38
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,875
Dorothy, didn't you notice?
His pocket was bulging.

39
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,961
It's a bag of gumdrops.

40
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:55,880
It was square, like a box for a ring.

41
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:58,299
I think he's got a present for me.

42
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:02,387
Only you can be on-stage
with a spotlight in your eye,

43
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:05,348
and still see a diamond
inside a man's pocket.

44
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,184
Thank you, Louie.

45
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,822
Mr. Esmond. Pray, come in.

46
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:21,990
Thank you, I'd love to.

47
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,866
- Hi, Gus.
- Good evening.

48
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,204
- You were wonderful. Magnificent!
- Thank you.

49
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,998
You were good, too.

50
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:33,042
Gee, that makes me all warm inside.

51
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,921
- Mr. Esmond!
- Is it the right size?

52
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:40,842
It can never be too big.
Do you think it's too small, Dorothy?

53
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:47,849
- It should have a highball around it.
- Does it fit your finger?

54
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,268
Yes, it fits perfect.

55
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:54,188
Daddy, I'll bet you made me
the happiest girl in the world.

56
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:03,114
What do you do,
put Novocain on your lipstick?

57
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:07,201
Daddy? Daddy? May I tell Dorothy?

58
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,120
If you wish.

59
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,665
Dorothy, Mr. Esmond and I
are getting married.

60
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:16,544
- To each other?
- Of course. Who else to?

61
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:21,507
I always figured Lorelei would end up
with the Secretary of the Treasury.

62
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,968
Dorothy, guess what,
on Saturday we're sailing

63
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,762
-on the Isle de Paris
-"Ile" de Paris.

64
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:30,725
- We're getting married in Europe.
- Why not get married here, then go?

65
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:33,519
- Or is that old-fashioned?
- We've made our plans.

66
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,022
Come in.

67
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:39,984
A long distance call for you
from Dayton, Ohio.

68
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:44,155
Thank you, I'll be right there.
Must be Father.

69
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:48,493
I hope nothing's happened.
I'll meet you at my table, dear.

70
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:56,417
Father! Never misses, Gus' old man.
Right on cue. Too bad, honey.

71
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,670
Nothing's going wrong this time.

72
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,175
The old boy won't let you
commit matrimony with his son.

73
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:07,095
He'd rather shove him
down an elevator shaft.

74
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:12,350
Dorothy, I'm sailing on Saturday
with or without Mr. Esmond.

75
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:16,437
And I'm not coming back
until he comes and gets me

76
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:21,859
When we're in France, where
his father can't phone him twice a day...

77
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:25,696
Gus will never let you go alone.

78
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:30,326
Sometimes Mr. Esmond finds it
very difficult to say no to me.

79
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:34,247
Well, that's very possible.

80
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:50,388
We can't check the roll
if you don't stick together.

81
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:55,560
Peters? Randall? Sanford? Sims?

82
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,728
- Stevens?
- Look at that.

83
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,439
Stevens? Willard J. Stevens?

84
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,151
- Why don't you answer
- I'm busy.

85
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,114
Boy, oh, boy!

86
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,491
Check your passport right over there.

87
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:13,369
Is this the way to Europe, France?

88
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,704
To where?

89
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,498
No, honey. France is in Europe.

90
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:19,333
Who said it wasn't?

91
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:22,587
Would you say, "North America, Mexico"?

92
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:26,174
- If that's where I wanted to go.
- The dealer passes.

93
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:30,970
- This ship goes to Cherbourg, France.
- Thank you ever so. See?

94
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:34,557
What's all the talent in the blue jackets?
A band?

95
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,311
That's the Olympic team.
They're sailing on this ship.

96
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:43,649
The Olympic team, for me?
Wasn't that thoughtful of somebody?

97
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,485
- Dibs on the shot-putter.
- Dorothy Shaw!

98
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,489
Remember, you're the chaperone.

99
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,200
Let's get this straight.

100
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:55,453
The chaperone sees that
nobody else has fun.

101
00:08:55,703 --> 00:09:00,458
Nobody chaperones the chaperone.
That's why I'm right for this job.

102
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,542
Passports, please.

103
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,548
I thought you'd be late. Here's your ticket.

104
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,884
They're at the passport desk.

105
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,886
You're after the blonde.

106
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,721
The brunette's her friend.

107
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,890
We don't care what she does.

108
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:19,685
- I care.
- Have fun, son.

109
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,065
Come on, guys. Let's get on board.

110
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,775
Have a nice trip.

111
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,039
Suppose the ship sank.

112
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,999
Which one would you save from drowning?

113
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,168
Those girls couldn't drown.

114
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,218
- Right in here, mademoiselle.
- Thank you.

115
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,182
My, it's just like a room, isn't it?

116
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:03,020
Oh, look! Round windows!

117
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:07,275
Yes, dear. Just put that there, Frisbee.

118
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,361
And, Frisbee, wait for me on the pier.

119
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:11,696
Lorelei...

120
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,698
- Where's Dorothy?
- I don't know.

121
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,033
Someone whistled and she disappeared.

122
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,703
Will she be a bad influence?

123
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:23,916
Dorothy's not bad, honest.
She's just dumb.

124
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,211
Always falling for a man
just because he's good-looking.

125
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,088
- Oh dear, that's not...
- I keep telling her,

126
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:32,466
it's as easy to fall for
a rich man as a poor man.

127
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,385
But she says "Yes, but..."

128
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,764
If they're tall, dark and handsome
she forgets vital statistics,

129
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:39,849
until it's too late.

130
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,435
That's why I'm her friend.

131
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,979
She needs me to educate her.

132
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:49,984
Yes, but very few girls have
your wonderful willingness to learn.

133
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:54,405
- I suppose that's true.
- Put this in a safe place.

134
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,907
- What is it?
- A letter of credit.

135
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,619
That's sweet!
You wrote me before I went away.

136
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:04,332
No, a letter of credit is like money.

137
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:05,374
Money?

138
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,252
Just take it to a bank in Paris.

139
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:09,962
That's wonderful!

140
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,758
Write me every day. I'll be so lonesome.

141
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:17,178
I bought you a little going-away present.

142
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,097
Daddy! Daddy:

143
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:24,352
There's only one of you
in the whole wide world.

144
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,774
Sorry, wrong room.

145
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:34,695
- Who's that?
- A stranger. He had the wrong room.

146
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,531
Good-looking.
Hope he isn't just seeing someone off.

147
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:40,701
Quite a place we have here.

148
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:44,080
Come in, fellas. Folks, meet the relay team.

149
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,290
- Hi.
- How do you do?

150
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,584
We're having a bon voyage party.

151
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,586
Put the phonograph in there.

152
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,506
Come on in, everybody.

153
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,133
Make yourselves at home.
I'll get the glasses.

154
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,346
Who's got the champagne?

155
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:05,601
Keep those athletes to yourself.

156
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,813
What a coincidence! That's my plan, too.

157
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,776
Gangway! Who needs a glass?

158
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,905
- I want to talk to you.
- Sure.

159
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,200
I want to tell you...

160
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:26,038
I want to remind you of something very...

161
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,917
Stop that, please. It's most distracting

162
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:35,047
Dear, a lot depends on how
you conduct yourself on this trip.

163
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:40,010
As you know, Dad is dead set
against our marriage.

164
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:44,098
Even the slightest hint of scandal...

165
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,267
I don't know what I could do.

166
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,645
My goodness, lover.
You don't have to tell me that.

167
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:53,399
L'd give anything to sail with you, baby.

168
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,111
Me too.
I don't know what I'll do without you.

169
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,156
I don't know what I'll do without you.

170
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,703
I’m not so sure.
You can be a naughty boy sometimes.

171
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,747
You don't have to worry about me.

172
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,500
I do, though.

173
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:23,262
All visitors ashore! First call.
All visitors ashore!

174
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,473
Bye-bye, baby

175
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:31,812
Remember you're my baby
When they give you the eye

176
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:37,776
Although I know that you care
Won’t you write and declare

177
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:44,575
That though on the loose
You are still on the square?

178
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:49,121
I'll be gloomy
But send that rainbow to me

179
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:53,918
Then my shadows will fly

180
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,755
Though you'll be gone for a while

181
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:04,970
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by and by

182
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:11,268
- With my baby by and by
- In the sweet by and by

183
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,687
Bye-bye, baby, bye-Dye

184
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:18,776
- We’II go meet on the beautiful shore
- Baby, bye, goodbye

185
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,155
Bye-bye, pretty baby

186
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,700
You better remember you're my baby

187
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:30,871
When they give you the eye
My, my!

188
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:36,460
Although I know that you care
Won’t you write and declare

189
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:43,175
Declare that though on the loose
You are still staying on the square

190
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,053
I'll be gloomy

191
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,806
But send that rainbow to me

192
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:52,810
Then my shadow will fly

193
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:56,981
Though you'll be gone for a while

194
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:04,154
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by and by

195
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:09,827
With my baby by and by

196
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,054
I'll be in my room alone

197
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:34,059
Every postmeridian

198
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:38,397
And I’Il be With my diary

199
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:45,279
And that book by Mr. Gideon

200
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:52,077
Bye-bye, baby

201
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:58,250
Remember you're my baby

202
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:05,466
When they give you the eye

203
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,057
And just to show that I care

204
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:19,313
I will write and declare

205
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:24,943
That I'm on the loose

206
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:31,158
But I’II stay on the square

207
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:37,665
I'll be lonely

208
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:43,921
But even though I'm lonely

209
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:51,011
There’II be no other guy

210
00:16:53,263 --> 00:17:00,270
Though I'll be gone for a while

211
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:06,860
I know that I'll be smilin'

212
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,449
With my baby by and by and by

213
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,994
With my baby by and by

214
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:21,667
I'll be gloomy
But send that rainbow to me

215
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:28,132
All ashore! Last call!
All ashore! Last call!

216
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:37,182
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by and by

217
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:46,859
Bye-bye, baby
Remember you're my baby

218
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,904
When they give you the eye

219
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:57,035
Although I know that you care
Won’t you write and declare

220
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:03,417
That though on the loose
You are still on the square

221
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,386
- You better go.
- Don't go.

222
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,848
- Step back, please.
- Bye, lover!

223
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:24,938
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by

224
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,399
And by

225
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:32,237
With my wonderful baby

226
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:39,870
By and by

227
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,763
- Hi.
- Hi.

228
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,934
Hi, Miss Shaw.

229
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,228
All right, you guys, keep moving.

230
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:11,693
-"Mr. Amos Jones and valet."
- What are you doing?

231
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:17,908
Checking the passenger list.
"Mr. Alfred Loman and valet."

232
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:21,119
"Mr. Eugene Martin and valet."

233
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,248
Why the sudden interest in valets?

234
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:29,253
When a man has "and valet"
after his name, he's worthwhile.

235
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,422
I’m trying to find
a gentleman escort for you.

236
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:37,302
Don't bother.
I just provided myself with about 20.

237
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,849
Dorothy, did you ever hear
of a rich pole-vaulter?

238
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:47,104
Who cares?
I like a man who can run faster than I can.

239
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,523
I hate to think where you'll wind up.

240
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:53,443
You're wasting time on
unrefined persons without money.

241
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,489
Did it occur to you that
some people don't care about money?

242
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,576
Don't be silly. We're talking serious.

243
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,370
Do you want a loveless marriage?

244
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,330
Me, loveless?

245
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:10,419
If a girl spends time worrying
about the money she doesn't have,

246
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,338
how will she have any time for love?

247
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:17,301
I want you to find happiness
and stop having fun.

248
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,970
That baffles me.

249
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,180
You'll thank me some day.

250
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:27,269
Here's a good one.
Henry Spofford III and valet

251
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,191
I remember. The Spofford family
owns practically a whole state.

252
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,737
A big one too. I think it's Pennsylvania.

253
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,656
I guess I could settle for Pennsylvania.

254
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:45,329
- Hello, Mrs. Henry Spofford III.
- Mrs. Henry Spofford III and valet

255
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:48,916
He won't have anything I don't.
See you later.

256
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:52,169
Don't forget the cocktail party. 5:30.

257
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,511
- The whole team?
- Until after the Games.

258
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,848
You eat at 6:00 and go to bed at 9:00?

259
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:05,933
That's right.

260
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,768
Coach is strict.

261
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:12,522
Holy smoke, 9:00!
That's just when life begins.

262
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,691
- Not for us.
- All right, you guys.

263
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:28,538
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

264
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,416
One, two, three, four.

265
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,586
One, two, three, four.

266
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,547
One, two, three, four.

267
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:46,556
One, two, three, four.

268
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,434
One, two, three, four.

269
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,653
Honey, you'll hurt yourself.

270
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,493
I can't play tennis
My golf's a menace

271
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,830
I just can't do the Australian crawl

272
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,751
And I'm no better at Volleyball
Ain't there anyone here for love?

273
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:19,840
Sweet love
Ain't there anyone here for love?

274
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:34,771
I'm apathetic and non-athletic
Can't keep up in a marathon

275
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:41,945
I need some shoulder to lean upon
And a couple of arms to hold me

276
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:45,699
Ain't there anyone here for love?

277
00:22:55,292 --> 00:23:02,299
I'm not in condition to wrestle

278
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:06,803
I've never trained in a gym

279
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:13,518
Show me a man who can nestle

280
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:18,231
And I'll pin a medal on him

281
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:24,154
Need some chappie to make me happy
And he don't have to be Hercules

282
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:29,326
Don't anyone know about birds and bees?
Ain't there anyone here for love?

283
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:34,331
Sweet love

284
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:38,502
Ain't there anyone...

285
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,839
...here for love?

286
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,848
Doubles, anyone?

287
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,940
Court's free.

288
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:08,698
Two out of three, anyone?

289
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,832
Doesn't anyone want to play?

290
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:23,755
I like big muscles
And red corpuscles

291
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:27,884
I like a beautiful hunk of man

292
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:32,305
But I’m no physical culture fan

293
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:36,726
Ain't there anyone here for love?

294
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:41,565
Sweet love
Ain't there anyone

295
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,069
Ain't there anyone

296
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:54,786
Ain't there anyone, anyone
Anyone, anyone

297
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,169
For love?

298
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,931
- Did you say $50?
- Oui.

299
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,809
A tidy sum just to sit at a table.

300
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,562
Supply and demand. Many requests
for a seat at Miss Shaw's table.

301
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:23,815
I got many requests for a seat at
Miss Lee and Miss Shaw's table.

302
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:30,238
And the price goes up and up and up.
That's inevitable. Je regrette.

303
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:37,120
Je regrette it more than vous.
However, the name's Malone.

304
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,164
Get it down while I can still afford it.

305
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,248
Merci, Monsieur Malone.

306
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,794
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
- Are you the headwaiter?

307
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:47,714
- At your service.
-I'm Miss Lee.

308
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:53,470
Miss Lee. Well, now I understand.
What can I do for you?

309
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,556
Put a certain gentleman at my table.

310
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,851
There's nothing I can do for you.

311
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,480
All seating arrangements
are completed, final.

312
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,232
That's too bad.

313
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:09,444
In Atlantic City, all the men
at my hotel wanted to sit at my table.

314
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,863
I can understand that.

315
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,950
Some even gave the headwaiter money.

316
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,828
That happens. What can one do?
One takes it.

317
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:23,375
- That headwaiter had to give it back.
- Indeed? Why?

318
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:29,089
I had all my meals in my room.
I didn't come to the table at all.

319
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,509
Naturally, the men wanted their money.

320
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,261
I beg you...

321
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,596
Do you want me to eat in my room?

322
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,848
That must not be.

323
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:43,228
If Mr. Henry Spofford III
is seated at my table...

324
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:47,607
- It shall be.
- Thank you ever so

325
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:02,872
- Hi.
- Hi, Miss Shaw. Nice to see you.

326
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,916
My name is Watson.

327
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,336
Here we are, all ready for you.

328
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,880
- I need it.
- What's the matter?

329
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,968
The entire Olympic team
has to be in bed by 9:00.

330
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,387
What can you do?

331
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:21,224
- Write your congressman.
- Catch me a pigeon, and I will

332
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:26,938
May I present Sir Francis Beekman?
A pigeon, if there ever was one.

333
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,732
Note the ruby eyes.

334
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:33,737
No reason to run me down.
Jealous. I have a way with ladies

335
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:39,576
It's that diamond mine of yours.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

336
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:44,998
Cheeky fellow. Good sort, though.
What say we sit down?

337
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:48,960
I understand you're an entertainer.
I'll bet you're good.

338
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:52,505
Thanks. Say, is that on the level?
Do you own a diamond mine?

339
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,925
I do. Are you interested in diamonds?

340
00:27:56,092 --> 00:28:00,597
- Not particularly.
- You must be an extraordinary girl.

341
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:04,100
- Will you do me a favor, sir?
- Call me Piggie.

342
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:07,103
- Do me a favor, Piggie?
- Anything.

343
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:12,859
Don't spread it around about your mine.
I don't want my friend to hear.

344
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,944
She doesn't care for diamonds?

345
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:20,283
I'm trying to avoid trouble.
Do not tell her about the diamonds.

346
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,452
Did you say "diamonds"?

347
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,498
Well, well, well! By George, I must say!

348
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,294
No doubt about it, no sirree.
No doubt about it at all.

349
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:36,299
- Miss Lee, meet Piggie.
- Delighted! Delighted!

350
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:42,347
You did say "diamonds." I can tell.

351
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:46,976
I control the second largest mine
in South Africa.

352
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:52,482
But this lady has a friend
she doesn't want to know about me.

353
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,902
- I wonder why.
- Oh, no, you don't.

354
00:28:56,152 --> 00:29:01,825
Having heard so much about you,
I expected you'd be much older.

355
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:07,497
Me? You don't say. By George!
Older than what?

356
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,165
The Pyramids.

357
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:13,837
I say if a man isn't a certain age,
he isn't interesting.

358
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,172
Honey, lay off!

359
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,758
Bless my soul. Care to dance?

360
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:23,721
I'd enjoy to dance. Thank you ever so.

361
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:28,268
- Another drink?
- No, thanks.

362
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:34,065
- Need a program to tell the players.
- I want to know who the players are.

363
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:39,446
- Like, who just stole second base?
- My name's Malone.

364
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:44,075
Mine's Shaw, Dorothy. Well, Mr. Malone?

365
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:48,037
You're the most attractive girl here,
so I came over.

366
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:54,711
- Flattery will get you anywhere.
- Then we haven't any problems.

367
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,131
I was wondering why
you hadn't shown up before this.

368
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:03,636
- I had some business to attend to.
- Then this isn't a vacation?

369
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,723
Not entirely. There's still a telephone.

370
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,726
- In fact, I just had some bad news.
- Oh?

371
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:15,482
My best 2-year-old will never run again.
He's worth $40,000.

372
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,818
It's not the money.
This might've been good.

373
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:22,280
- You're not one of those?
- One of what?

374
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,617
The kind who tells a girl about his money.

375
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,911
What's wrong with money?

376
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:32,457
Yes, I'm afraid you are.
Go whistle up a rope.

377
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,000
Wait...

378
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,629
I can't stand rich playboys who think they...

379
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:43,092
Now wait a minute! I'm not that bad
all the time. Sometimes I'm very nice.

380
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,970
Sometimes I speak without thinking.

381
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,932
So you're half sweet, half acid.

382
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,477
- Please, I made a mistake.
- Yes, you did.

383
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:57,440
I got some bad information.
Now that I've put my foot in it...

384
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:02,153
I remember it wasn't you they were
talking about, but your friend.

385
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:05,615
- Lorelei.
- Or am I wrong again?

386
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,786
No, money is rather a hobby of Lorelei's.

387
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,289
Oh, Piggie.

388
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:18,294
- You're worried about her.
- You're very observing.

389
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,380
Am I forgiven?

390
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,633
Considering the man shortage
on this craft...

391
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,470
Good. We'll start all over again.
I promise that I...

392
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,138
We're gonna be interrupted.

393
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,182
We had a jolly time.

394
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:37,188
- Mr. Malone, Miss Lee and Piggie.
- How do you do?

395
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:43,236
Piggie is the super-best dancer.
So light on his feet.

396
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:47,532
- I was sure he would be.
- You're trying to flatter me.

397
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,493
- What's the matter?
- My Wife.

398
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:54,539
- I thought it was his mine.
- Won't you join us?

399
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,251
- I just have.
- May I present Miss Lee?

400
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:01,754
- Miss Shaw, Mr...
- Malone.

401
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:06,384
- A pleasure, I'm ever so sure.
- Thank you.

402
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:09,429
We're having a jolly time.

403
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,684
Lady Beekman, that's the most
beautiful jewelry I've ever seen.

404
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:21,107
I'm proud of the earrings. Heirlooms.
Been in the family for ages.

405
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:25,028
You'd never Know it.
They look just like new

406
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:31,034
You might be interested in my tiara.
I always have it with me.

407
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,536
Afraid to leave it in my room.

408
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:39,626
- But not afraid to show it to Lorelei?
- Stop. She won't know you're teasing.

409
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:45,632
Look! Did you ever?
Anywhere, anything like it?

410
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:49,427
All blue stones. Cozy little job, what?

411
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:53,139
- May I just hold it for a minute?
- Of course.

412
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:59,145
- How do you put it on?
- It goes on your head.

413
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:05,401
- You must think I was born yesterday.
- There's no other explanation.

414
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:10,907
No, no, my dear. She's quite right.
Like so. It's a tiara.

415
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:17,413
You do wear it on your head! I love
finding new places to wear diamonds.

416
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:21,751
Excuse me, dear.
Miss Lee has promised me this dance.

417
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:25,254
We've got to dress for dinner. We must go.

418
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:28,132
Well, all right. Au revoir.

419
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:31,594
A very pleasant au revoir to you.

420
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:35,431
My tiara. Thank you.

421
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,603
Poor fella.
Two-to-one she locks him in her closet.

422
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:44,774
-I'd be grateful if she did.
- I think he's cute.

423
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:50,780
You know very well what I mean.
You and that... What are you doing?

424
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:56,619
Just testing. Wonder what I'll wear it with.
How does it look?

425
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:59,706
Exactly like trouble.

426
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:11,634
I told the coalition leader that we
need a man who can do something about...

427
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,807
Finish your story, dear.

428
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:39,495
Your table, madame.

429
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:45,668
Good evening, Miss Lee and Miss Shaw.
This is Mr. Crossley. Mr. Franklin.

430
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:49,172
- Mr. Mason. How do you do?
- Mr. Brooks.

431
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,381
How do you do?

432
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,177
- Is Mr. Spofford here?
- No, but this is his chair.

433
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:58,556
- You're here, Miss Lee.
- Miss Shaw, you're here.

434
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:03,436
- Could my friend have your seat?
- But of course.

435
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,022
She gets sick if she rides backwards.

436
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:09,192
-I'm sorry.
- Not at all.

437
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:16,449
- How are we at the same table?
- I was assigned this seat.

438
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:21,078
- How much did it cost?
- I can't tell. You'd get conceited.

439
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,706
Enjoying the trip, Mr. Franklin?

440
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:28,294
How many times have you crossed?
Isn't it lonely on the ocean?

441
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,798
I just adore conversation, don't you?

442
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:35,802
Mademoiselle, Mr. Spofford is here.

443
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:40,431
Dorothy. Pardon me for whispering.
Try to make a good impression.

444
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:41,766
Okay.

445
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:46,729
Right this way, sir. Mr. Henry Spofford.

446
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

447
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,734
Hello. Hello.

448
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:55,238
Well, are you traveling by yourself?

449
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:58,574
No, I've got a valet, a tutor and a trainer.

450
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:05,456
Well, having heard so much about you,
I expected you to be much older.

451
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:09,836
I'm old enough to appreciate
a good-looking girl.

452
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:13,422
This promises to be quite a trip.

453
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:16,133
Personally, I don't intend to miss a meal.

454
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,637
How am I doing?

455
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:31,107
- There's a place.
- Ernie, will you get some cigarettes?

456
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:40,324
I can't get over that passenger list.
Calling a young boy "mister."

457
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:43,995
A girl could Waste a whole trip to Europe.

458
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:46,455
Think we better give up the idea?

459
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:50,293
If he were 16,
you could marry him in Tennessee.

460
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:55,006
- Drinks seemed like a good idea.
- You're a dear boy.

461
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:59,385
- What's your line, Mr. Malone?
- My line?

462
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:04,515
I tell a girl she has hair
like a tortured midnight,

463
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:08,019
lips like a red couch in an ivory palace,

464
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:13,482
and I'm lonely.
Then I generally burst into tears.

465
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:16,569
- Very seldom works.
- You idiot.

466
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:21,198
- What do you do for a living?
- Oh, that kind of line.

467
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:25,411
Nothing, I'm afraid. Just clip coupons.

468
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:30,166
- Coupons. That's like money, isn't it?
- Very similar.

469
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:35,504
I'm so pleased. Dorothy's never been
interested in anyone worthwhile.

470
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,839
No taste?

471
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:40,009
No, I'm a hobo collector.
I might find room for you.

472
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:43,888
- She's joking.
- I hope not, I'm counting on it.

473
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,892
- Some people don't get her jokes
- I'm gonna try.

474
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,772
Dorothy's the best and loyalest friend
a girl ever had.

475
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:57,401
She'll make a wonderful wife.
You'll find out.

476
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,738
-I've got to be going.
- Going? Where?

477
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:04,784
Don't worry.
I'm only concerned about you two.

478
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,620
There's a wonderful moon out.

479
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,583
There you are.
Miss Lee, will you dance with me?

480
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:16,879
I'd love to. If you hadn't asked me,
I was going to ask you.

481
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:21,634
Really? Well, by Jove!
I say, will you excuse us?

482
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,394
- Do you remember last night?
- Very well.

483
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:35,314
I mean when we were talking
about the moon.

484
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:39,068
It reminded you of a moon in Coney Island.

485
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,821
Could have been the same one. Why?

486
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:44,240
I remember I was wondering

487
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:48,327
what a rich man like you
were doing in Coney Island.

488
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:49,578
Oh, well...

489
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:54,583
I rather thought you'd be
in Bermuda or Palm Beach.

490
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,806
Wonder if I should break that up.

491
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:14,020
They're just dancing in public.
Can't make much of a case of that.

492
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,480
You sound like a detective.

493
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:21,277
Let's go find our moon
and forget about your girlfriend.

494
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:24,488
I'd get in trouble
if I pushed Piggie overboard

495
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,615
Not with me.

496
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:30,286
Why blame Piggie? It's not all his fault.

497
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:32,621
No, I...

498
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:36,000
Just what did you mean by that remark?

499
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:41,797
I can't figure out how two girls can
be so different and be friends.

500
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:47,303
Let's get this straight.
Nobody talks about Lorelei but me.

501
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,140
She's quite a girl. You just don't know her.

502
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:58,230
You don't mind if I like you better, do you?

503
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:06,363
- We settled that quarrel in a hurry.
- Now what do we talk about?

504
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,324
Let's talk about you.

505
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:13,204
For the past hour I've been thinking.

506
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,290
Thinking about doing something.

507
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:20,336
What have you been thinking, Mr. Malone?

508
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:00,876
Aren't you clever!

509
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:06,298
That means, "Come to my basha.
I'll give you coconut shells."

510
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:11,095
The natives believe
coconut shells Ward off the snakes.

511
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,722
Africa must be fascinating.

512
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:19,270
A girl like I almost never gets
to meet a really interesting man.

513
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:23,566
- Sometimes my brain gets starved.
- Poor little thing.

514
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:28,612
It's a terrible thing to be lonesome,
especially in the middle of a crowd.

515
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,281
Do you know what I mean?

516
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:32,908
You'll never be lonesome again.
Leave it to Piggie.

517
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:39,748
-I've got to see Lorelei alone.
- Shall I wait in the next room?

518
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,919
If you like.
We're expecting Lady Beekman for tea.

519
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:47,506
Here? I just remembered,
I have another appointment.

520
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:52,469
I better pop off.
Toodle-oo, chin-chin and all that rot.

521
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:57,474
- That was mean!
- Shut up and listen to me.

522
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,935
- You're in a jam.
- Me? Why?

523
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:03,606
What were you doing before
Piggie started barking?

524
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:08,027
- He wasn't barking, that's Swahili.
- Before that.

525
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:13,157
Were you doing anything you
wouldn't want Mr. Esmond to see?

526
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:18,495
- Why, no... My goodness, yes!
- What?

527
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:23,292
He was telling me about South Africa.
It's dangerous.

528
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:30,466
Full of snakes called pythons.
It seems a python can grab a goat

529
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:34,303
and kill it by squeezing it to death.

530
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:37,223
- Get to the point.
- That's all.

531
00:42:37,473 --> 00:42:40,309
What's incriminating about that?

532
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:45,064
Well, Piggie was being the python,
and I was a goat.

533
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,982
Oh, Lorelei!

534
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:50,736
Don't worry! Piggie won't tell anyone!

535
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,866
He won't have to.
When Piggie was squeezing the goat,

536
00:42:56,075 --> 00:43:00,496
Mr. Malone was taking pictures
through that porthole.

537
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:05,668
- Whatever for?
- The National Geographic Magazine.

538
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:10,214
Wake up, honey. Mr. Malone has foxed us.

539
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,592
He's been shining up to me to watch you.

540
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:17,388
I'll bet you anything he's a private
detective hired by Mr. Esmond.

541
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:24,895
Gus is jealous without pictures. He sees
that, he'll be absolutely unreasonable.

542
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,606
Yes, he will.

543
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:31,777
I was gonna kill him, but I thought better.

544
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,696
Better?

545
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:37,157
We'll get the photos
if he doesn't know we know.

546
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:39,952
-I'll get them. He's a man, isn't he?
- How?

547
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:43,747
Charm won't work. He's too smart for that.

548
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:48,335
- And he was such a doll last night.
- Oh, Dorothy!

549
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:53,048
Boy, will I tell him off
once we get the pictures!

550
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:57,261
- The question is, how do we do that?
- Well...

551
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:03,434
The simplest way is to swipe them.
We'll get our war paint on and go to work.

552
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,936
- Where's Lorelei tonight?
- You sound interested.

553
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:50,272
I am, but not in her.

554
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:55,778
If you are interested,
I know where we could find her.

555
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:58,364
Just asking a question.

556
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:21,136
That's all.

557
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:50,833
Hello.

558
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:55,838
Mr. Spofford, please give me a hand.
I'm sort of stuck.

559
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,799
- Are you a burglar?
- Heavens, no!

560
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:01,844
I got looked in. I was waiting for a friend.

561
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:06,432
- Why didn't you ring for him?
- I didn't think of it.

562
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:12,271
- If you're a burglar and I help you...
- Please, help before someone comes

563
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:17,568
I'm thinking. All right.
I'll help you for two reasons.

564
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,319
Never mind the reasons.

565
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:23,782
The first is, I'm too young to be sent to jail.

566
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:28,454
The second is, you've got
a lot of animal magnetism.

567
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:34,418
Look, someone's coming.

568
00:46:36,879 --> 00:46:42,384
- What'll I do?
- Hold this around your neck, tight.

569
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,268
Good evening.

570
00:46:51,477 --> 00:46:55,731
I say, whatever are you doing up there?

571
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:58,650
I wanted to see the view from here.

572
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:02,237
Are you feeling well, my dear?

573
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:06,575
Yes, thank you ever so,
but I must have caught a chill.

574
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:10,746
- What say we get a spot of sherry?
- I can't.

575
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:15,000
- Sherry's the best thing for a cold.
- I couldn't.

576
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:18,170
You do look flushed. Let me feel your pulse.

577
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,255
No, no, please...

578
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:24,760
No cause for alarm, my dear.
It's purely medical.

579
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:29,515
- There's no fever, at any rate.
-I'm all right, I'm fine.

580
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:32,434
- Such a little hand.
- Put that back.

581
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:37,981
So sweet, so tiny,
and yet it can hold a human heart.

582
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,526
- Stop that!
- Beg your pardon?

583
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:43,820
Well I... Why...

584
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:46,782
- Laryngitis, I guess.
- No doubt.

585
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:52,162
- I need sherry. Will you get it?
- I fly on the Wings of Mercury.

586
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:56,458
- Just hurry up.
- All right, my dear.

587
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:05,008
How can you stand that old Wolf?
His intentions aren't honorable.

588
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:08,887
For heaven's sakes, get me out of here!

589
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:16,812
Help me over here.

590
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:22,442
You're all bruised? Malone's been
here with me the whole time.

591
00:48:22,693 --> 00:48:29,116
- Mr. Spofford pulled me too hard.
- Never mind. Did you get the pictures?

592
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:31,243
- They weren't there.
- Sure?

593
00:48:31,493 --> 00:48:35,914
I looked everywhere.
I even looked in the camera shop.

594
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:40,586
- Then he's got them in his pockets.
- He must, darn it!

595
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:45,007
He wouldn't hide them if
he thinks we're buying his act.

596
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:50,512
Order dinner for three in our cabin
and get some drinks.

597
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:52,931
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

598
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:57,102
If we can't empty his pockets,
we're not worthy to be women.

599
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,271
I'll have everything ready.

600
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,370
He'll be here in a minute.
Are the drinks ready?

601
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:17,122
Almost ready.

602
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:21,043
This room's like an oven.
Let's turn the heat off.

603
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:22,753
Leave it alone.

604
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:25,714
But it's hot, why don't...

605
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:30,469
Oh, for him. You know,
sometimes your brain amazes me.

606
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:36,308
Thank you. Our drink is water and
bitters, so don't make any remarks.

607
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:38,226
What are you doing?

608
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:42,147
This is his. Are three sleeping pills enough?

609
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:45,400
Three's a lot. That's potent stuff.

610
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:48,654
If a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing well.

611
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,407
Here we go.

612
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:57,954
- Come in.
- Here are your cigarettes.

613
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:01,875
- Hi, Miss Lee.
- I got cocktails all ready.

614
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:06,755
- Make yourself at home.
- It's hot in here. Must be 110.

615
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:09,841
She's afraid of catching cold.

616
00:50:10,092 --> 00:50:14,096
Touch of laryngitis.
Here, specialty of the house

617
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:15,764
That's quite a cocktail.

618
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:19,017
It's very mild. Let's drink a toast.
Do you know this one?

619
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:23,980
There was a fellow named Sidney
Who drank till he ruined a kidney

620
00:50:24,314 --> 00:50:27,859
It shriveled and shrank
But he drank and he drank

621
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,445
He had fun doing it, didn't he?

622
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:34,700
- Appetizing.
- I know another. Bottoms up.

623
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,795
He looks like he'll explode.

624
00:50:47,129 --> 00:50:52,676
- What are you made of? What was that?
- Scotch, vodka, brandy and gin.

625
00:50:52,843 --> 00:50:55,053
Here, try this.

626
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:03,603
- That wasn't water!
- No, straight vodka.

627
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:07,858
Want some more? What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

628
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:11,361
-I'm burning up.
- Let's take off your coat.

629
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:16,158
Yes, you'll feel better.
You'll cool off. I'll help.

630
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:20,537
Now you just sit down there.
Excuse me a minute.

631
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:25,333
- Any luck?
- Not so far.

632
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,920
Be sure you check the inside pocket.

633
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:33,175
- It's not in here.
- It's not in his coat.

634
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:36,845
There's one other place
it could be: his pants.

635
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:39,890
- We'll have to get them.
- Should I do it alone?

636
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:43,268
- Two heads are better than one.
- I suppose so.

637
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:47,105
It's ticklish business. We'll stick together.

638
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:52,444
I nearly went to sleep.
Could you turn the heat down?

639
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:55,947
- He needs a glass of water.
- Yes, indeed.

640
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,533
I'd like water, but it's this heat...

641
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:00,744
Nice glass of water.

642
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,704
Look out!

643
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:08,126
- Your pants are soaked!
- We can't leave him in wet pants.

644
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:12,214
-I'll put them under the hair dryer.
-I'll go and change.

645
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,884
- Don't be silly. You'll catch cold.
- No, no! Look...

646
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:20,055
I won't catch cold!
What kind of a party is this?

647
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:26,228
You're just in time.
Get something to put on him.

648
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:30,732
Mr. Malone doesn't feel well.
You better go and lie down.

649
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:36,071
- I feel like lying down for a month.
- Here, put this on.

650
00:52:36,655 --> 00:52:38,281
François'll help.

651
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:43,745
It's not fair.
Two against one, take a man's pants...

652
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:52,963
- I don't think it's here
- It must be.

653
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,759
I've got it! I've got it!

654
00:52:58,927 --> 00:53:03,598
Here. $2.20.
Your negatives and positive prints.

655
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:08,603
And may I say, in the words
of my countrymen, "Ooh, la, la!"

656
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,273
- Thank you ever so.
- A pleasure.

657
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:12,941
Hi. Remember me?

658
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:16,111
Yes. You're one of the Olympic athletes.

659
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,197
I'm the only 4-letter man on the team.

660
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:24,452
You should be ashamed to admit it.
No, don't say another word.

661
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:32,836
This is the most contemptible bit
of impudence I've ever encountered.

662
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:38,842
Photographing innocent people!
It's invasion of privacy.

663
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:44,848
If a newspaper got it, your wife
wouldn't know you were being a snake.

664
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:50,312
I think I better sit down.
Are you sure there are no more?

665
00:53:50,562 --> 00:53:53,481
Positive, Piggie. Do you feel better?

666
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:56,735
You little angel, you don't even know that

667
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:00,697
a certain type of girl would
take advantage of this.

668
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,075
She'd have to be a terrible girl to be mean

669
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,996
to a sweet, intelligent,
generous man like you.

670
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:12,667
My dear, let me do something
to show my gratitude.

671
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:17,672
- Thank you ever so!
- May I kiss your hand?

672
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:23,511
A kiss on the hand feels good,
but a diamond tiara lasts forever.

673
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,514
- Tiara?
- Lady Beekman's. I'd love it.

674
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:29,517
- Good gracious.
- What's the matter?

675
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:34,606
Wouldn't you rather have
some furs or a race horse?

676
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:35,857
No, thank you.

677
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:40,779
It would be hard to explain
that I'd given it away.

678
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:44,866
You're so clever.
You could, if you put your mind to it.

679
00:54:45,075 --> 00:54:47,619
- Do you think so?
- Of course.

680
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:54,125
Besides, it's only fair I should have
her tiara. After all, she has you.

681
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:57,212
MY dear, my very dear!

682
00:54:57,379 --> 00:55:02,050
- Let's get it now.
- Anything you say, my dear.

683
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,191
- Keep an eye on the door.
- Oui, monsieur.

684
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:38,670
All right, Pierre.
Take this thing back to my cabin.

685
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,968
I'll stay here.
Here's the microphone and a dividend.

686
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,262
Merci, monsieur.

687
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,266
- And leave the door open.
- Oui, monsieur.

688
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:58,189
Lorelei, they're coming...
How did you get in?

689
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:02,444
- Through the door.
- Still snooping around?

690
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:06,281
Nothing to do with you.
I'm paid to watch the blonde...

691
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,992
I'd sure hate to have your job.

692
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:14,831
Checking up on people is messy work,
but only when they're doing things...

693
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:19,044
Like pretending to make love to a girl
while you spy on her friend?

694
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:21,963
That part of it is not true.

695
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:28,136
I don't believe anything you say.
Go away, Sherlock, you're a wrong guy.

696
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:32,557
-I'm not wrong about you.
- You're only making it Worse.

697
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,477
Don't listen, but I'm telling you...

698
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:39,647
Come on in, you can hear better in here.

699
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:43,276
Am I intruding, or is he leaving?

700
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:49,199
I'm leaving.
But, Miss Lee, before I go, I'll tell you this.

701
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:54,162
Sometimes even a mercenary nitwit
like you has a decent impulse.

702
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,665
Don't get your friend mixed up
in your schemes.

703
00:56:57,749 --> 00:57:03,213
Because I'll rub your nose in them,
and I don't want her to get hurt.

704
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:07,050
If you've nothing more to say, pray, scat!

705
00:57:07,342 --> 00:57:09,719
That's about all.

706
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:14,808
Honey, except for telling you
I have money, which I haven't,

707
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:20,647
everything else I said, I meant.
And it wasn't part of my job either

708
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:25,735
Think about it.

709
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:32,283
Why did you just stand there
and let him kiss you?

710
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:38,706
It's crazy, but I think
I'm falling in love with that slob.

711
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,168
You just feel that way because he's poor.

712
00:57:42,669 --> 00:57:46,089
I hope so. Come on, let's change.
We dock in an hour.

713
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:22,500
We want to buy some clothes.
You know, hats, dresses.

714
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:26,629
You know some good places?

715
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,383
That's where we want to go first.

716
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:56,242
- This has been fun, hasn't it?
- Yes.

717
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:59,162
It's the first time
I've shopped without a man along.

718
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:10,965
You were a big help.
I've never spent so much money so fast.

719
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:13,218
- A pleasure.
- Is that enough?

720
00:59:13,468 --> 00:59:15,970
- Thank you.
- We'll be seeing you.

721
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:28,858
Bonjour, madame.

722
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:32,487
Bonjour. I am the manager. May I help you?

723
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:36,157
Certainly. Show me a place
to take my shoes off.

724
00:59:36,366 --> 00:59:39,494
Dorothy, a lady never admits her feet hurt.

725
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,997
Have you reservations?

726
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:46,376
Yes. In the name of Mr. Augustus Esmond.

727
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,795
- This is Miss Shaw, I'm Miss Lee.
- Hi.

728
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:54,509
Oh, yes. We have been expecting you.
This way, please.

729
00:59:59,097 --> 01:00:03,726
- Well!
- I thought we'd lose you in Paris.

730
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:08,022
- Are these the persons you spoke of?
- Yes.

731
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:12,235
Lady Piggie. I mean Beekman!
What a pleasant surprise.

732
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:17,740
I dare say. You may proceed, Pritchard.
This person is Miss Lee.

733
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:21,953
I represent the Suffolk Insurance Company.

734
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:24,247
I never buy insurance.

735
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:28,960
Mr. Malone needs it in his business.
What is all this?

736
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:33,756
If you return the tiara, I'm willing
to forget this squalid incident.

737
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:40,888
Allow me to clarify. Lady Beekman's
tiara has been reported as stolen.

738
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:46,311
- What's that got to do with us?
- It's in your possession.

739
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:49,731
- Absolutely not!
- Let Lorelei talk for herself.

740
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:55,695
She'll do better than that.
She'll sue you for slender! Tell them

741
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:58,614
- We're waiting.
- None of your business.

742
01:00:58,823 --> 01:01:00,742
It's very much our business.

743
01:01:01,117 --> 01:01:06,247
Just tell them you haven't got it...
Oh, Lorelei, you didn't!

744
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:08,416
I did not steal the tiara.

745
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:13,588
- Then how is it in your possession?
- That's my affair.

746
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:18,217
- That's one explanation.
- Lord Beekman knows. Ask him.

747
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:22,764
We've already done so.
He denied knowing anything about it

748
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:24,807
and departed for Africa.

749
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:32,565
- Piggie wouldn't do that!
- Are you going to give back the tiara?

750
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:36,486
I wouldn't dream of it.
It's mine. I'm keeping it.

751
01:01:36,778 --> 01:01:39,906
That remains to be seen. Come, Pritchard.

752
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:46,120
- You'll find that I mean business.
- Then why are you wearing that hat?

753
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:50,583
- I want to talk.
- My mind's made up.

754
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:54,504
The simplest way out of this
is to give it back.

755
01:01:54,587 --> 01:02:00,593
I do not care to converse with you.
We won't be in to him during our stay.

756
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,972
- I regret you will not stay here.
- What now?

757
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:09,310
Esmond canceled your reservation
and letter of credit.

758
01:02:09,477 --> 01:02:12,188
- After hearing from you.
- That's right.

759
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,068
I don't believe it.
Mr. Esmond wouldn't do that. Did he?

760
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:21,781
Exactly. He refuses responsibility
for your bills.

761
01:02:22,198 --> 01:02:27,245
- We've just spent all of our money.
- That's not our concern.

762
01:02:27,328 --> 01:02:31,124
Let's get out of here.
I hear your plumbing is noisy.

763
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:34,669
If you need help, I'm at the Elysées Hotel.

764
01:02:34,836 --> 01:02:37,255
You hold your breath till I call.

765
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,895
Mademoiselle?

766
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:01,446
Café.

767
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:07,201
When love goes wrong

768
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,581
Nothing goes right

769
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:16,085
This one thing I know

770
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:21,674
When love goes wrong

771
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:25,261
A man takes flight

772
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:31,809
And women get uppity

773
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,564
The sun don’t beam

774
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:40,234
The moon don’t shine

775
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:46,949
The tide don’t ebb and flow

776
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:51,913
The clock won’t strike

777
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:55,583
A match won’t light

778
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:59,462
When love goes wrong

779
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:02,757
Nothing goes right

780
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:08,262
The blues all gather round you

781
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:10,264
Crazy, mademoiselle!

782
01:04:10,598 --> 01:04:17,522
And day is dark as night

783
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,609
A man ain't fit.

784
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:24,946
...to live With

785
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:30,618
And a woman's a sorry sight

786
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:36,791
When love goes wrong

787
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:40,127
Nothing goes right

788
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:46,425
When love goes wrong
Nothing goes right

789
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:48,886
Do it, honey! Do it!

790
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:51,764
When love goes wrong

791
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:57,061
Nothing goes, nothing goes right

792
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:04,068
When love goes wrong
Nothing goes right

793
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:09,323
Bees don’t buzz, fish don’t bite
Clock won’t strike, match won’t light

794
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:13,953
When love goes wrong

795
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:17,582
Nothing goes right

796
01:05:21,127 --> 01:05:24,672
A woman's a fright, a terrible sight

797
01:05:24,964 --> 01:05:29,093
Man goes out, gets high as a kite
Love is something you can't fight

798
01:05:29,302 --> 01:05:31,679
You can't fight it, honey.

799
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:35,975
When love goes wrong, nothing

800
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:39,103
No bows, honey, just eight bars and off.

801
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,482
Nothing goes right

802
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:47,445
Just in time.

803
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:54,368
It's like we said
You're better off dead

804
01:05:54,660 --> 01:06:00,124
When love has lost its glow

805
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:05,129
So take this down

806
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:08,174
In black and white

807
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:12,553
When love goes wrong

808
01:06:12,637 --> 01:06:16,015
Nothing goes right

809
01:06:16,098 --> 01:06:19,935
When love goes wrong

810
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:24,607
Nothing goes right

811
01:06:52,468 --> 01:06:54,428
Oh, dear.

812
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:12,947
- Right over there, monsieur.
- Thank you.

813
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:14,740
Lorelei?

814
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,036
Hello. You remember
Mr. Esmond, don't you?

815
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:20,413
Perfectly.

816
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:24,875
Why not say hello?
He used to be a friend of ours.

817
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:28,796
- Nice to see you again.
- Yes, indeed.

818
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:32,466
Lorelei. Lorelei, wait!

819
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:36,303
I've flown the Atlantic Ocean to talk to you.

820
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:41,308
- You can come in. If you don't mind?
- I don't mind if you don't mind.

821
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:44,645
- Mr. Esmond?
- Thank you.

822
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:49,150
Aren't you even gonna say you're sorry?

823
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:55,656
I won't fall in love with a man who
won't trust me, no matter what I do.

824
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:59,452
"No matter what..."?
That's being unreasonable.

825
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,662
Well, goodbye, then.

826
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:04,123
How can I trust you
after all Father's found out?

827
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:09,628
- We're ready to dress you.
- Be right there.

828
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,173
Lorelei, I...

829
01:08:12,423 --> 01:08:15,134
Men like you have made me the way I am.

830
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:19,680
If you loved me at all,
you'd feel sorry for my troubles,

831
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:25,686
instead of holding them against me.
Don't say another word.

832
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:30,024
I wasn't gonna say anything.

833
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:36,363
You have a tough time. If you want
to get upset, watch her next number.

834
01:08:36,614 --> 01:08:38,657
You mean...

835
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:42,828
Oh, dear. Thank you.

836
01:10:00,406 --> 01:10:02,283
No!

837
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:23,220
No, no, no, no, no, no

838
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:29,977
No

839
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:31,478
No

840
01:10:32,104 --> 01:10:35,900
No, no, no, no, no

841
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:41,155
No, no

842
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:45,451
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

843
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:47,411
No!

844
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:55,085
The French are glad to die for love

845
01:10:55,336 --> 01:11:00,466
They delight in fighting duels

846
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:04,178
But I prefer a man who lives

847
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:11,352
And gives expensive jewels

848
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:16,732
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental

849
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:21,779
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

850
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:25,032
A kiss may be grand

851
01:11:25,324 --> 01:11:29,286
But it won’t pay the rental
On your humble flat

852
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:32,498
Or help you at the automat

853
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:37,378
Men grow cold as girls grow old

854
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:42,633
And we all lose our charms in the end

855
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:47,805
But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don’t lose their shape

856
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:53,477
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

857
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:57,231
Tiffany's!

858
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,319
Cartier!

859
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:06,073
Black, Starr, Frost, Gorham

860
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:10,077
Talk to me, Harry Winston
Tell me all about it!

861
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:18,877
There may come a time
When a lass needs a lawyer

862
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:24,008
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

863
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:26,218
There may come a time

864
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:31,849
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice

865
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:35,185
But get that ice
Or else no dice

866
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:39,606
He’s your guy when stocks are high

867
01:12:39,898 --> 01:12:44,945
But beware when they start to descend

868
01:12:45,237 --> 01:12:50,576
It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses

869
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:54,788
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

870
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:08,427
I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic

871
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:13,307
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

872
01:13:13,599 --> 01:13:18,562
And I think affairs that
You must keep liaisonic

873
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:24,318
Are better bets
If little pets get big baguettes

874
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:28,739
Time rolls on
And youth is gone

875
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:33,452
And you can't straighten up
When you bend

876
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:39,625
But stiff back or stiff knees
You stand straight at...

877
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:44,463
...Tiffany's

878
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:51,637
Diamonds

879
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:57,101
Diamonds

880
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:04,358
I don’t mean rhinestones

881
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:07,694
But diamonds

882
01:14:08,362 --> 01:14:11,698
Are a girl's best

883
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:17,204
Best friend

884
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:31,802
- How did Gus like your number?
- He looked kind of grim.

885
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:34,054
Hand me my hat, please.

886
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:37,891
He is sweet, isn't he? I really do love Gus.

887
01:14:38,142 --> 01:14:39,476
You do?

888
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:43,522
There's no other millionaire
with such a gentle disposition.

889
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:47,234
He never wins an argument,
does anything I ask,

890
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:52,322
and he's got the money to do it.
How can I help loving him?

891
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:55,492
I guess so. Let's don't talk about love.

892
01:14:55,576 --> 01:14:58,537
It reminds me of Malone,
the human ferret.

893
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:08,714
The police are here!
They have a warrant for your arrest.

894
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:13,218
It will get in the newspapers.
It will hurt my business.

895
01:15:14,928 --> 01:15:16,763
Give up that tiara.

896
01:15:17,014 --> 01:15:20,350
If I give it back, it's admitting I stole it.

897
01:15:20,559 --> 01:15:24,938
You're in a strange country.
You can't prove you didn't steal it.

898
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:28,275
Do you want to go to the Bastille?

899
01:15:28,442 --> 01:15:31,111
- I guess I'll give it back.
- Where is it?

900
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,572
- In there.
- Come on, let's get it.

901
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:38,035
- Oh, Dorothy. It's just not fair.
- No, of course not.

902
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:41,914
It's gone!

903
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:45,292
What? Are you sure
this is where you left it?

904
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:48,879
Yes. It's been stolen! It's been stolen!

905
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:54,384
The cops! Sister, we really are in a jam.

906
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:56,470
Come on.

907
01:15:57,804 --> 01:16:01,808
- I'll give you a boost.
- Lorelei? It's me, Gus.

908
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:06,146
- He's your best chance.
- He can't boost me any higher than you.

909
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:07,231
Lorelei?

910
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:12,402
Just a minute. Either you hock
your stuff or get the money from him.

911
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:16,657
- How much will a tiara cost?
-15,000 at least.

912
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:21,745
- That'll take an hour and 45 minutes.
-I'll take care of the gendarmes.

913
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:23,247
How?

914
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:26,166
You're not the only one here
with hidden talents.

915
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,377
- Lorelei?
- Coming!

916
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,505
You can come in now.

917
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:35,342
I've made up my mind.
We're through. Through forever.

918
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:40,931
- First I want to kiss you goodbye.
- Very well.

919
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:47,688
No, no. Not in front of everybody.
Come on in, Daddy darling.

920
01:16:54,236 --> 01:16:58,031
- This is your flight.
- Thanks very much.

921
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:10,961
- Until you finish customs...
- I want to speak with this gentleman.

922
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:13,171
- Well?
- Have a nice trip?

923
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:17,050
- My son, where is he?
- In the café where the girls work.

924
01:17:17,301 --> 01:17:20,846
I explicitly told you to stay with him.

925
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:24,975
He can't be left alone
with that blonde man-trap.

926
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:26,685
He's perfectly safe.

927
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:32,399
Right now, the man-trap is in court
explaining things to the police.

928
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:36,528
- That's better.
- We'll go when you're through customs.

929
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:38,196
I'll be right with you.

930
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:48,874
I beg your pardon.

931
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:52,586
Sir Beekman. I heard you'd gone to Africa.

932
01:17:52,753 --> 01:17:57,090
What'd you say?
My name is not Beekman, I'm Amos Finch.

933
01:17:57,257 --> 01:17:58,550
All right.

934
01:17:58,759 --> 01:18:02,721
Don't be in such a rush.
You're the chap on the boat?

935
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:03,930
lam.

936
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:08,101
- I was joking. Of course I'm Beekman.
- You're sure?

937
01:18:08,352 --> 01:18:13,273
My plane leaves in an hour.
Do you know where to find Miss Lee?

938
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:17,903
- I think so.
- Give her a message after I've gone.

939
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:24,076
Tell her that I had no choice.
What I did, I had to do.

940
01:18:24,284 --> 01:18:27,579
She'd understand if she knew my wife.

941
01:18:27,788 --> 01:18:30,540
Tell her I know money
means nothing to her.

942
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:34,252
- But I'll make it up to her.
-I'll tell her.

943
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:39,049
Thanks awfully, old boy
It'll be a great favor.

944
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:43,887
- All right, take me to this young lady.
- Yes, sir.

945
01:19:24,136 --> 01:19:28,974
- You will please swear, Miss Lee.
- Oh, judge, I never swear.

946
01:19:29,141 --> 01:19:34,688
Swear to tell nothing but the truth.
Will you do that?

947
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:39,860
- Well, yeah. Thank you ever so.
- Sit down.

948
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,492
You are being held for trial
for a charge of grand larceny.

949
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:52,706
The plaintiff attests you stole
a headpiece of diamond, a tiara.

950
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:56,877
My goodness, judge,
a girl needs time to think.

951
01:19:57,127 --> 01:20:00,380
You're so much more intelligent
than poor little me.

952
01:20:00,547 --> 01:20:02,883
Won't you tell me what to say?

953
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:08,388
- Please to answer the charge
- Yes, I was going to.

954
01:20:08,889 --> 01:20:13,977
I was just thinking.
It was all a terrible misunderstanding

955
01:20:14,186 --> 01:20:18,356
You see, sometimes life is
very hard for a girl like I.

956
01:20:18,565 --> 01:20:23,069
Especially if she's pretty
like I and has blonde hair.

957
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:27,157
We can do without the philosophy.
Facts only.

958
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:32,829
Mr. Pritchard is a little confused
and would like to ask a question.

959
01:20:33,038 --> 01:20:35,749
I can hardly blame him. What is it?

960
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:41,254
He doesn't see well, and would like
to look at Miss Lee more closely.

961
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:43,548
Permission granted.

962
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:51,223
Mr. Pritchard, how nice to see you!

963
01:20:51,431 --> 01:20:54,768
Yes, Miss Lee...
You are Miss Lee, aren't you?

964
01:20:54,935 --> 01:20:59,606
That's who I am, all right.
But my friends call me Lorelei.

965
01:20:59,773 --> 01:21:05,278
I hope you're my friend. I love to
have handsome gentlemen be my friends.

966
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:07,781
My eyes are not that good.

967
01:21:07,948 --> 01:21:10,283
- Have you ever heard me sing?
- No.

968
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:13,745
- Are you sure?
-I've not had the pleasure.

969
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:15,747
Thank you ever so!

970
01:21:16,206 --> 01:21:21,294
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental

971
01:21:21,545 --> 01:21:26,633
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

972
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,135
A kiss may be grand

973
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:34,140
But it won’t pay the rental
On your humble flat

974
01:21:34,391 --> 01:21:37,310
Or help you at the automat

975
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:42,274
Men grow cold as girls grow old

976
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:47,279
And we all lose our charms in the end

977
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:53,159
Square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don’t lose their shape

978
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:55,412
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

979
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:59,249
This is not a cabaret! Stop that woman!

980
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,501
Tiffany's!

981
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:06,965
Cartier!

982
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:15,974
Black, Starr, Frost, Gorham

983
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:19,185
Talk to me, Harry Winston
Talk to me

984
01:22:19,436 --> 01:22:23,940
Did you hear me? Stop her!
Get her to the Witness stand!

985
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:27,694
The rest of you take your places.

986
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:30,530
You are fired!

987
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,617
How could my son get mixed up
with that type of girl?

988
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:43,710
Now, young lady,
we're here to dispense justice.

989
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:47,839
Not to watch a cabaret show.
You understand me?

990
01:22:48,048 --> 01:22:51,551
- Yes, judge.
- All right.

991
01:22:51,676 --> 01:22:55,221
Did you or did you not steal
the diamond tiara?

992
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:58,642
Oh, no, sir. I did not steal it.

993
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:02,979
The fact is, Lady Beekman's
husband gave it to me.

994
01:23:03,188 --> 01:23:05,607
Your Honor! The defendant is not...

995
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:13,990
- You have evidence for this case?
- Yes, I have.

996
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:17,035
Before he talks, could I explain something?

997
01:23:17,243 --> 01:23:18,870
Go ahead.

998
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:24,751
I have a friend named Dorothy,
and she's a really good friend.

999
01:23:24,918 --> 01:23:28,755
She knows I would never do
anything really wrong.

1000
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:34,260
- Do you have to say this?
- Yes, sir, I do.

1001
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:40,016
There's a young man that Dorothy likes.
She's very fond of him.

1002
01:23:40,225 --> 01:23:43,853
Dorothy would never speak
to this man again

1003
01:23:44,062 --> 01:23:48,274
if he did anything to hurt me, Lorelei.

1004
01:23:48,525 --> 01:23:52,904
So I think this young man had
just better know that...

1005
01:23:53,905 --> 01:23:57,534
Dorothy thinks she's in love with him.

1006
01:23:58,284 --> 01:24:01,871
Mr. Esmond, I resign. I just quit the case.

1007
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,623
Are you crazy?

1008
01:24:03,873 --> 01:24:07,919
But I like it that way.
Judge, I've changed my mind.

1009
01:24:08,128 --> 01:24:10,880
I haven't anything to say.

1010
01:24:11,089 --> 01:24:14,134
This becomes more and more confusing.

1011
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:19,597
But the solution is simple.

1012
01:24:19,806 --> 01:24:23,226
The property will be placed
in this court's custody

1013
01:24:23,435 --> 01:24:29,149
until the owner can be established
by an affidavit from Lord Beekman.

1014
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:33,570
Now, Miss Lee, you will give me the tiara.

1015
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:37,991
- But I can't.
- If you refuse, you go to prison.

1016
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:41,494
I just haven't got it. It was stolen.

1017
01:24:41,786 --> 01:24:45,457
I think I know where that thing is,
and who's got it.

1018
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:48,835
- Who are you?
- A private detective.

1019
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:54,048
Give me two policemen and wait
half an hour. I can settle this.

1020
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:56,718
Anything would be better than this.
Go with him.

1021
01:25:04,768 --> 01:25:06,519
There he is.

1022
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:12,525
What's that?

1023
01:25:12,984 --> 01:25:15,069
What's he saying?

1024
01:25:15,737 --> 01:25:19,407
Speak English! This is outrageous!

1025
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:21,910
I'm a British subject!

1026
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:25,830
This is positively outrageous!
I demand a lawyer.

1027
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,292
What?

1028
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:33,338
- What did you say?
- He says remove your hat.

1029
01:25:33,546 --> 01:25:36,841
Why doesn't he say so?
Send for the consulate.

1030
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:39,552
-I'll take this.
- Give that back.

1031
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:45,016
This is Sir Francis Beekman.
And this is the missing tiara.

1032
01:25:45,225 --> 01:25:48,394
- That's mine!
- Miss Lee will be glad to return it.

1033
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:50,563
I certainly would.

1034
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:54,943
I believe His Honor asked
Miss Lee for the tiara.

1035
01:25:55,235 --> 01:25:59,113
- I say, that isn't...
- I wouldn't go into that, Mr. Finch.

1036
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,573
Finch?

1037
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:03,535
- Miss Lee.
- Thank you.

1038
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:09,123
- Your Honor.
- Thank you.

1039
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:11,876
Thank you.

1040
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:16,589
- Monsieur Pritchard.
- Thank you. Your Lordship.

1041
01:26:16,798 --> 01:26:17,882
Thank you.

1042
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:20,760
Case dismissed!

1043
01:26:21,761 --> 01:26:24,264
Five minutes ago you said you'd marry me.

1044
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:29,227
- That's before Dorothy phoned.
- What made you change your mind?

1045
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:32,313
She just said everything's okay now.

1046
01:26:32,564 --> 01:26:37,151
I don't quite understand...
Oh, dear. Hello, Father.

1047
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:38,945
Hello, son.

1048
01:26:39,112 --> 01:26:43,783
I know why you're here, and I don't care.
I'll make her marry me.

1049
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:45,952
That's wonderful.

1050
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:50,790
I presume this is the young lady?
A pretty girl. American?

1051
01:26:50,999 --> 01:26:53,918
Yes, except on my parents' side.
They're Irish.

1052
01:26:54,127 --> 01:26:59,424
I'm delighted. I've wanted to
see you married for a long time.

1053
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:02,510
Anybody but that monster, Lorelei Lee.

1054
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,514
But, Mr. Esmond, I am Lorelei Lee!

1055
01:27:06,806 --> 01:27:10,101
Pretty early to start teasing
your father-in-law.

1056
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:14,314
- What's the matter, Father?
- Nothing. I can take a joke.

1057
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:19,444
What joke? This is Lorelei.
This is nothing to joke about

1058
01:27:19,652 --> 01:27:24,699
I don't have my driver's license
with me, but take my word for it.

1059
01:27:24,991 --> 01:27:29,454
Look, that's I. See my name?

1060
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:31,497
Oh!

1061
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,584
I'm too old for this sort of thing.

1062
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:37,754
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand?

1063
01:27:37,837 --> 01:27:42,133
How do you think I feel with
thousands of Lorelei Lees around me?

1064
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:45,219
But you're not marrying any of them!

1065
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:49,349
I love her. I love her very much.
I've never felt...

1066
01:27:49,515 --> 01:27:54,562
Oh, shut up!
Young lady, you don't fool me one bit.

1067
01:27:54,812 --> 01:27:58,149
I'm not trying to. But I bet I could.

1068
01:27:58,358 --> 01:28:02,904
You might convince this jackass,
but you'll never convince me.

1069
01:28:03,154 --> 01:28:08,201
- That's too bad. I do love him.
- Certainly. For his money.

1070
01:28:08,368 --> 01:28:10,495
No! Honestly.

1071
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:15,708
You expect me to believe that you
aren't marrying him for his money?

1072
01:28:16,042 --> 01:28:19,420
- It's true.
- Then why do you want to marry him?

1073
01:28:19,671 --> 01:28:23,883
- I want to marry him for your money.
- There!

1074
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:28,054
That's why we need his consent, silly.

1075
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:32,850
We're getting down to brass tacks.
You admit you're after money.

1076
01:28:33,059 --> 01:28:36,604
No, I don't. Aren't you funny?

1077
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:41,234
Don't you know that a rich man
is like a pretty girl?

1078
01:28:41,526 --> 01:28:44,404
You don't marry her
just because she's pretty.

1079
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:47,073
But, my goodness, doesn't it help?

1080
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:51,536
Would you want your daughter
to marry a poor man?

1081
01:28:51,744 --> 01:28:56,416
You'd want her to have the most
wonderful things in the world.

1082
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:59,377
Why is it wrong for me
to want those things?

1083
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:01,587
Well, I concede that...

1084
01:29:01,796 --> 01:29:05,883
Say, they told me you were stupid.
You don't sound stupid.

1085
01:29:06,092 --> 01:29:10,430
I can be smart when it's important.
But most men don't like it.

1086
01:29:10,638 --> 01:29:14,434
Except Gus. He's interested in my brains.

1087
01:29:14,851 --> 01:29:19,772
- No, that much of a fool he's not.
- You've changed your mind?

1088
01:29:19,897 --> 01:29:25,653
- I just don't know what to tell you.
- Daddy?

1089
01:29:25,945 --> 01:29:28,781
Not you. I guess I mean "Sonny."

1090
01:29:29,073 --> 01:29:32,452
Give me three minutes
alone with your father.

1091
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:35,580
- Run along, darling.
- Yes, dear.

1092
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:38,416
Now, about what we were speaking.

1093
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:42,795
There's a great deal to consider.
I just can't answer...

1094
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:57,310
Please, take your places.

1095
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:15,495
Remember, on your wedding day
it's all right to say yes.

1096
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:26,339
We’re just two little girls
From Little Rock

1097
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:34,138
And we lived on the wrong side
Of the tracks

1098
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:39,519
But at last we won the big crusade

1099
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:45,399
Looks like we finally made the grade

1100
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:54,492
Square-cut or pear-shaped

1101
01:30:54,575 --> 01:30:58,538
These rocks don’t lose their shape

1102
01:30:59,956 --> 01:31:05,670
Diamonds
Diamonds

1103
01:31:06,546 --> 01:31:12,844
Diamonds are a girl's...
Diamonds are a girl's...

1104
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:17,557
best friend

1105
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:22,687
