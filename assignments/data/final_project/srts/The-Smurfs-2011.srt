1
00:00:06,077 --> 00:00:09,001
There is a place.

2
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:12,323
A place that knows no sadness.

3
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:17,085
Where even feeling blue is a happy thing.

4
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:23,443
A place inhabited by little blue beings
three apples high.

5
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:30,046
It lies deep in an enchanted forest,
hidden away beyond a medieval village.

6
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,087
Most people believe this place is made up,

7
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,567
only to be found in books
or in children 's imaginations.

8
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,487
Well, we beg to diff en

9
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,043
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!

10
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:49,079
I'm going in!

11
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:53,479
All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!

12
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:55,047
Yes!

13
00:00:56,319 --> 00:01:02,768
Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,204
Oh, yeah! So excited!

15
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,928
Now you see us, now you don't!

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,208
Three, two, one. Yeah!

17
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:38,122
Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!

18
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:52,042
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late!

19
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:57,007
In Smurf village, each and every Smurf
plays their own special pad.

20
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,490
- Whoa, Nellie!
- Sorry, Handy!

21
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:02,530
No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed!

22
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:04,882
Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.

23
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:07,163
- Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
- No worries, Clumsy.

24
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:09,610
- And tranquility.
- Great sign, guys!

25
00:02:09,682 --> 00:02:12,083
- Whether it's Handy Smurf the builder
- I can't stay. Rehearsal time!

26
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:14,482
- Baker Smurf.
- Hey, Narrator Smurf!

27
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:18,323
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro
for the Blue Moon Festival!

28
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:20,806
- Pizza!
- Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!

29
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:23,447
Clumsy! Help!

30
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:28,651
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!

31
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:30,847
Smurf on the loose!

32
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,167
- Hey, Clumsy.
- Hey, guys!

33
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:33,803
- Hi, Jokey!
- Hi, Clumsy.

34
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:36,527
Who's clumsy now, huh?

35
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:39,404
Hey, what do you get when you cross
a Smurf with a cow?

36
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:43,168
Blue cheese! I got you a present.

37
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:45,491
No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!

38
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:47,404
But, wait! I...

39
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:52,847
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

40
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:54,764
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.

41
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,328
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal
for the Blue Moon Festival?

42
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,768
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.

43
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:01,489
Grouchy, it's right there.

44
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:05,005
Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy."

45
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:07,412
Clearly you two
lack the verbal skills required

46
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:09,488
- to explain this predicament succinctly.
- Hey!

47
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:11,088
- Here we go.
- You see, Clumsy,

48
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:14,729
the other Smurfs don't want to dance
with you for fear of what are politely called

49
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:16,649
"fractures."

50
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:20,249
How could anybody think that?

51
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,612
That's gonna leave a big blue bruise.

52
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:28,846
Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous.

53
00:03:29,645 --> 00:03:31,565
Watch it, there!

54
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:37,166
Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.

55
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:41,173
- A worry line!
- All right, don't get your petals in a twist.

56
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:44,974
As happy and as perfect
as life in Smurf village is,

57
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:49,846
even sunshine and butterflies
must have their dark clouds.

58
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:54,211
And for all Smurfs,
that dark cloud has one name.

59
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:57,330
Gargamel, the evil wizard.

60
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:01,447
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

61
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:05,615
La la la la la la
This is so wrong

62
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:07,571
"I'm Papa Smurf.

63
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:10,207
"I'm the head of a small group of blue people

64
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:14,487
"and live in the forest
with 99 sons and one daughter.

65
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:18,608
"Nothing weird about that, no, no.
Totally normal."

66
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:22,175
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.

67
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:24,928
"And I betrayed Gargamel,
and I don't even care.

68
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,692
"And everything is just
sunshine and rainbows."

69
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:34,295
But all of that is about to change.

70
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:44,576
I said, "All of that is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!

71
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:46,697
That's your cue to
pounce on the miserable beasts

72
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:49,649
in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy.

73
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,177
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.

74
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,976
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only puppets I have.

75
00:04:55,848 --> 00:04:58,369
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.

76
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:01,089
I simply can't stop thinking about
the miserable beasts

77
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,416
every single minute of every single day.

78
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,529
'Cause I need them!

79
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:09,577
It is only by capturing the little wretches
and extracting their happy blue essence

80
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,131
that my magic will finally become...

81
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:15,413
Not infallible.

82
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:19,090
Invincible! Yes. Thank you.

83
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:23,738
I shall become the most powerful wizard
in all of the world.

84
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,375
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.

85
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,617
"O great one?"

86
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,734
Yes, lying, deceptive,
horrible little Smurfette?

87
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,212
"After all your years of Smurf-less searching,
how ever do you expect to find us?"

88
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,898
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.

89
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,458
For, you see, I have a magical map

90
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:52,051
that shows me exactly where
the smurf root grows!

91
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:56,700
I shall now use my formidable powers
to magically transport us here!

92
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:00,539
Come, my little fish-breathed friend!

93
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:02,259
Alakazoop!

94
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:06,492
Great.

95
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:10,452
Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?

96
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,260
We really need that Smurf essence.

97
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,620
Alakazamp!

98
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:21,059
Now tie it off right there!

99
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,576
That blue moon time of year again.

100
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:26,976
Time to smurf some magic.

101
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:30,574
Summon a vision
and see what our future holds.

102
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:33,740
I must get the visioning potion just right.

103
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:36,693
The magic is always strongest
during the blue moon.

104
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:41,621
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles and smurf berries.

105
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,900
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.

106
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:48,373
A dragon wand.

107
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:51,614
I got it! I got it!

108
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,654
Clumsy.

109
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,302
- Help! Save us!
- Papa!

110
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:04,254
Papa!

111
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:07,817
Clumsy, what have you done?

112
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:10,774
- Hey, Papa.
- Clumsy?

113
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:12,381
Are you okay?

114
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:15,339
Yes. Fine.

115
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:17,815
Why aren't you rehearsing for
the Blue Moon celebration?

116
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:20,738
You know.
A couple guys got smacked in the face,

117
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:23,015
so I thought I'd make
some smurf root mud packs

118
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:26,183
to take down everyone's swelling.

119
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:30,019
Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root.
I'll go pick some.

120
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:33,655
No! Those fields are too close
to Gargamel's castle.

121
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,096
I'll get the smurf root.

122
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:38,215
You stay in the village and out of trouble.
Do you understand?

123
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:41,820
Okay. If you say so.

124
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,584
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.

125
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:52,420
"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."

126
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:56,736
Look at all this smurf root.
They are gonna be so proud of me.

127
00:07:57,616 --> 00:07:59,744
Let's see, just a few more...

128
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:04,904
- Boo.
- Gargamel!

129
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,344
Help!

130
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:12,064
Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!

131
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:13,504
A ball of yarn!

132
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:15,536
A nice, juicy bird!

133
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:20,864
So, that's it!

134
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,057
It's invisible.

135
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:27,104
Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

136
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,145
We don't know if it's safe.

137
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:36,697
Azrael?

138
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:40,545
Are you dead?

139
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:44,586
So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?

140
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:48,299
Nothing apocalyptic, really.

141
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:49,982
Everything's going to be just fine.

142
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:53,583
Perfect. Another year we don't have to
worry about that mean, old...

143
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,385
- Gargamel!
- I know who she meant, Clumsy.

144
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:59,582
No, no! Gargamel!

145
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:02,658
I Gargamel!, kinda, sorta
accidentally led him to the village.

146
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:05,539
Gargamel!

147
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,299
Smurf for your lives!

148
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:10,298
Everybody skedaddle!

149
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,579
- Into the forest, Smurfs!
- Come on, Clumsy!

150
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:16,819
Sound the alarm, Crazy.

151
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,786
This is really bad!

152
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,187
Smurfs, that way!

153
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:23,099
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!

154
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:27,100
There you go, you nasty cat.

155
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:29,300
- This way!
- This is no joke!

156
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:30,984
- Look out!
- Papa!

157
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,343
Let go! Cursed nature!

158
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,021
Here comes papa, Papa!

159
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,222
Papa, your primitive little defenses,
they're useless against me, sir!

160
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,508
I laugh at them.

161
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:14,945
How's that for primitive, Gargamel?

162
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,825
Maybe this will all blow over.

163
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:19,269
I can fix this. I just gotta think.

164
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:20,469
Yes!

165
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,065
Follow me, everyone!

166
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:26,149
Save yourselves!

167
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,902
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!

168
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:31,390
- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls!
- With the blue moon coming?

169
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:34,026
- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
- Unbelievable!

170
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:36,630
The one time we want him to trip
and he's running perfectly!

171
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,469
- Clumsy!
- Oh, this is a predicament.

172
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,227
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?

173
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:43,550
- This is a predicament!
- This guy's killing me!

174
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:45,466
Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!

175
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,025
This is not good at all.

176
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:53,347
Clumsy!

177
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:56,143
Help!

178
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,587
Well, we tried. Let's go.

179
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,511
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.

180
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,023
Not the Smurf bridge!

181
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,463
- There we go.
- Yeah, pardon me.

182
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:07,108
This is not a Smurf bridge,
it's clearly a chain...

183
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,028
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- Smurf it, Brainy!

184
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:11,392
- The blue moon!
- Oh, dear.

185
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,027
- What's happening, Papa?
- What the blinking flip is that?

186
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:15,311
Oh, no!

187
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,748
- The vision!
- Come on, guys!

188
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:19,832
- Pull him up!
- Hurry!

189
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:24,428
- Don't let go!
- Help!

190
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:25,831
Help!

191
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:27,708
Look out for the hole!

192
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:30,468
No, it's more of a vortex. Of a portal.

193
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:32,268
Smurf up! It's a hole.

194
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:36,464
Hold on!

195
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,908
Oh, no!

196
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:42,466
Looks like you got
the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?

197
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:45,546
Now you belong to me!

198
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:48,272
Not this time, Gargamel!

199
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,306
What's wrong with you?

200
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:13,270
That was great! Let's have another go.

201
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:16,030
Are you smurf ed? We almost died in there!

202
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:17,350
We're not even wet.

203
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:20,154
What part of the enchanted forest is this?

204
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:22,070
My calculations indicate...

205
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:24,110
That's slimy.

206
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:27,270
I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.

207
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,634
Oh, my.

208
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:34,231
- Smurfs? You may Want to take a look at this.
- What is it?

209
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:38,195
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked through a giant hole.

210
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:39,594
It's not a hole, it's a vortex.

211
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,635
And can't we just go around the rock?

212
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:50,191
Oh, my smurf.

213
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:52,035
Where the smurf are we?

214
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:55,992
Up the smurfing creek without a paddle,
that's where.

215
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,912
Well, at least they're not coming after us.

216
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:00,315
Oh, yeah. Really?

217
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:03,112
- Oh, dear.
- Azrael!

218
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:04,432
- Run!
- Not again!

219
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,393
Azrael? Are you dead?

220
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:17,269
Must have Smurfs!

221
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,632
- We'll circle back when it's safe!
- Run!

222
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,353
- Guys, come on!
- Go!

223
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,229
- Coming through!
- I'm getting hungry!

224
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:29,709
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.

225
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:31,433
Hey, can we get
the photographer over there?

226
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:34,477
There's big arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.

227
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:38,357
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.

228
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:40,314
If you could not stand
directly in front of the display,

229
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,598
but over to the sides,
it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.

230
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:44,749
Also, don't forget to smile.

231
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:47,911
Remember, you're working for
a cosmetics company. That's it.

232
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:49,997
- Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time.
- Let's go!

233
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:52,634
- Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Hurry!

234
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,150
Hello, Henri.

235
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,910
On top of everything
with the campaign, Patrick?

236
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,037
Well, as much as I can be.

237
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,511
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.

238
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,074
Patrick!

239
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,310
- She's pointing at me.
- That can't be good.

240
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,518
Odile, it looks fantastic for
Thursday's launch.

241
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,471
It's gonna be quite the gala.

242
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,079
There he is.
My new vice president of marketing.

243
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,671
- So, wait, you fired Ralph?
- His campaign was rubbish.

244
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:22,959
He gave me what I asked for, not what I want.

245
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:25,111
Can you give me what I want?

246
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:26,631
Is that what you're asking for?

247
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,832
How would I know what I'm asking for
when I don't even know what I want?

248
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,836
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.

249
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:36,436
Exacto! I need you to create
a new campaign for Jouvenel.

250
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:40,120
All digital, of course,
so it can be ready on time for the launch.

251
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:42,792
Odile, that's two days.

252
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:46,353
Sí mi corazón, and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going to be a problem?

253
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:48,992
No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign,
it's kind of tight.

254
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,872
But... No, two days is perfect.

255
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:52,599
God only needed six days
for the whole world, right?

256
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:55,960
Fail me, and maybe you can
go and work for him.

257
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:03,673
Where are we, Azrael?

258
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:09,273
What manner of freakish realm is this?

259
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:14,517
Okay, one more box of research.
Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?

260
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:16,280
Yes, yes, of course.

261
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,193
This day just keeps getting better and better.

262
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:21,118
So we're just gonna jump in the portal,
get back to our village

263
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:22,481
and everybody's happy, right?

264
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,682
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.

265
00:15:24,753 --> 00:15:26,914
You know what?
I choose to be pessismurfstic.

266
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,194
We're all gonna die.

267
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:31,514
Papa Smurf, how do we get home
with the portal closed?

268
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:34,114
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight,

269
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,918
the portal will open again.

270
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,838
Now, let's take shelter till dark.

271
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:39,598
All right, let's get smurfing.

272
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:41,682
Okay, but I'm not happy.

273
00:15:42,394 --> 00:15:43,638
- Azrael!
- Run, Smurfs!

274
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:44,955
- Take that!
- Guys, come on!

275
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:47,435
- Quick, to the tree!
- Let's go!

276
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,235
- Smurfette!
- My hair! Get back, cat!

277
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:56,238
Way to go, Smurfette!

278
00:15:57,594 --> 00:15:59,918
- Oh, no!
- Take one for the team, Clumsy!

279
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:01,359
- Help!
- Clumsy, look out!

280
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:02,803
Smurf!

281
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:06,836
- Clumsy!
- Oh, no!

282
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,875
Hey.

283
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:11,483
- Clumsy!
- What a numptie.

284
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:14,036
- Quickly, to the mechanical wagon.
- Up the tree, Smurfs.

285
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:15,922
Why don't we just go around the tree?

286
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:18,796
There you are. By all means,

287
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:22,403
relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine
while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.

288
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:25,077
What? Where?

289
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:26,636
Come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.

290
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:28,920
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Slow down!

291
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,403
Be careful, Brainy.

292
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:32,363
Hey. Hey!

293
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:34,323
Seventh Street, from First and A, please.

294
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:36,040
- Come on, Smurfs!
- I don't like these heights.

295
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:38,320
- Don't look down.
- Come back here, wretched Smurfs!

296
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:39,684
- Hurry!
- We're way up here!

297
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:42,397
A jump from this height
will Knock the blue out of us!

298
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:43,840
- My hip.
- Papa!

299
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,083
- Gargamel!
- Oh, dear.

300
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:46,484
- Stop that carriage!
- Let's go! Let's go!

301
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,564
- Wait, wait. I forgot my phone.
- Come back! Stop there!

302
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:51,004
Stop that carriage!

303
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:52,396
Never mind. Here it is.

304
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:54,485
Knock yourself out, Gargamel!

305
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:56,645
You've had that coming for about 30 years!

306
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:57,917
Smurfs!

307
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:08,397
Oh, wow.

308
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:15,758
Castles and palaces everywhere!

309
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,722
- And green goblins!
- And red trolls.

310
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:21,845
And look at the giant princess!

311
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:26,562
This village is amazing, Papa.

312
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:29,278
Yes, and likely very dangerous.

313
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:31,606
Until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,

314
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:35,367
I need you all to stay close
and do exactly as I say.

315
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:37,403
- Smurf's honor.
- If you say so.

316
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,566
You can count on us, Papa.

317
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,886
They can see us! Camouflage.

318
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,438
Blend in.

319
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,403
Well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.

320
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,924
We get to climb another tree.

321
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:03,367
Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!

322
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,968
- Brainy.
- That's it.

323
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,920
- Thanks a lot. Have a good night.
- I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.

324
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,564
How are we supposed to
find Clumsy in there?

325
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,801
- I could attempt to smurf the probability...
- Brainy!

326
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:16,324
- We'll look through every window.
- I don't do windows.

327
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,287
- Now, let's get smurfing.
- You heard him. Come on.

328
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,728
- Every window?
- Piece of cake.

329
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:23,408
- Grace?
- Hello?

330
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,880
Guess what? Guess what, guess what?

331
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,645
Okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.

332
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,285
- No, but that's a good idea.
- Yes. They found...

333
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,008
Baby kicked.

334
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,401
- Hi.
- Hi.

335
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,721
Please say hello.

336
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,085
- Please.
- Hello, little Sea-Monkey.

337
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:53,089
This is the sound of my voice.

338
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:57,006
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.

339
00:18:57,641 --> 00:18:59,649
Hello.

340
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,806
That is not the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.

341
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,325
Our child is gonna be attached to the toaster.

342
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:07,443
Or the new VP of marketing.

343
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:11,407
No. No! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my gosh!

344
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:12,529
- It's...
- It's provisional.

345
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:15,523
If I wow Cruella de Odile,
then I'll keep the job.

346
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:18,646
If not, then my head'll be on a pike
next to the last guy.

347
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:21,050
Well, wow you will! You wowed me.

348
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:22,606
But I have two days.

349
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:24,723
- Yikes.
- I know.

350
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:26,811
What if I don't get them done in time?

351
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:28,770
Oh, HO, you can't come to the ultrasound.

352
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:32,527
Unless...

353
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:35,364
Wait, the backup ads we have
did fine in focus groups.

354
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:38,171
I could retool those.
I'd have to work around the clock.

355
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:44,564
Azrael, we've come so far,

356
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:48,649
yet ever am I haunted by
the same familiar riddle.

357
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:52,605
How to find the Smurfs?

358
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:55,008
If only I...

359
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:58,972
I'm sorry, is my thinking
interrupting your vile hacking?

360
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:03,212
If only I had something of theirs.
A drop of spittle. A fingernail.

361
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:08,410
Some hair, even.
Then I could make some Smurf magic.

362
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:13,404
Very nice. Are you done now?

363
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:14,811
I don't want to look at it.

364
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:18,048
What? What?

365
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:24,686
Is that... No. No, it can't be.

366
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,493
It is.

367
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:30,725
The tawny locks of Smurfette.

368
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:38,847
Sweet follicular ambrosia!
Silky strands of joy.

369
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:42,654
Mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.

370
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:47,930
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!

371
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:52,767
With my skills, even this small trifle
of smurfiness

372
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:56,214
will yield me just enough power
to catch them all!

373
00:20:57,686 --> 00:21:03,252
I must find a laboratory with which to tease
the magic from these precious little strands.

374
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:12,488
Yes. it's a bit small,
but this should do nicely!

375
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:16,570
It's even got its own cauldron.

376
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,455
What died in here?

377
00:21:21,768 --> 00:21:23,972
Open. Open. Open. Open. Open!

378
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:32,649
Somebody's been working a dark
and terrible magic in there.

379
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:41,932
What is that?

380
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,693
On, baby.

381
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,970
Daddy is home.

382
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:08,653
Come on.

383
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:12,134
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue,

384
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,010
- and that moon is not one of them.
- Papa?

385
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:18,618
Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal opened once, it can open again.

386
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:22,410
How are we gonna open a magical portal
when we can't even find Clumsy?

387
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,018
Hey, I think I see something up there.

388
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:52,255
Oh, no.

389
00:23:03,411 --> 00:23:05,572
Clumsy? Is that you?

390
00:23:06,132 --> 00:23:07,179
Hello.

391
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:10,692
Help! Help!

392
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,852
Oh, smurf.

393
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:28,773
Hey.

394
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:30,936
"Berry Boom."

395
00:23:55,573 --> 00:23:56,740
Patrick!

396
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:15,494
Elway. Elway.

397
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:18,062
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...

398
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:19,378
- Someone's coming!
- Smurfs!

399
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:20,501
What is it?

400
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:24,421
No, no!

401
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:28,023
No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please.

402
00:24:28,454 --> 00:24:29,655
Elway.

403
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:33,255
Elway. Did you do that?

404
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:35,462
- Come on, put a little smurf into it.
- Hang on, Clumsy.

405
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,259
- I got this side.
- All together now.

406
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:38,896
- Crikey.
- Oh, dear.

407
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:42,298
- Now what, lads?
- What happened to Clumsy?

408
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,980
- I bet they ate him. Let's go home.
- Hide.

409
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:46,576
GO! Pull the lid!

410
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:53,143
Gross.

411
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,023
This is so...

412
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:17,304
- That's Clumsy!
- Charge, Smurfs! Charge!

413
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:19,501
- Out of the way, big guy.
- Clumsy, we're coming!

414
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:20,624
Excuse me. Pardon me.

415
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:22,704
- This is for Clumsy!
- Wait for me!

416
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:24,737
- Oh, God!
- Please don't hurt me!

417
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:27,221
- Please, I just want to go home!
- Are you...

418
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:31,624
Did you just talk?

419
00:25:31,857 --> 00:25:35,305
I'm not saying till you put down
the giant spiky thing.

420
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:36,785
- Clumsy!
- Clumsy, where are you?

421
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:38,385
- Make yourself known!
- Smurf us a sign!

422
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:40,225
- Come out, Clumsy!
- Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.

423
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:42,064
- Are you there?
- Come to my voice, laddie!

424
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:43,501
- Where are you?
- Can you hear us?

425
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:45,946
- Get out of here!
- Look out!

426
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:48,906
- Too much aggression!
- Go back to the sewers!

427
00:25:48,977 --> 00:25:50,221
Kiss my smurf!

428
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,463
You all find clumsy! The giant is mine!

429
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:55,658
- Over here!
- Get him!

430
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:57,986
Have you had enough? Tap out?

431
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:02,303
Okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...

432
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:05,623
- Oh, gosh, are you okay?
- Quickly!

433
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:06,899
- This way! This way!
- Follow me, Smurfs!

434
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:08,898
- Clumsy! Where are you?
- Look out!

435
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:10,219
Other way! Other way!

436
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,707
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on!

437
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:13,342
Run!

438
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:15,340
Elway!

439
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:17,666
- Smurf for your lives!
- Clumsy, where the smurf are you?

440
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:20,107
- Stinky breath.
- Spread out!

441
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,866
Grace! Run!

442
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:27,067
Stop bleating like a sheep
and let me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.

443
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:29,223
Grace, we're being attacked!

444
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:31,787
Do not be fooled by their cuteness!

445
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,140
It's okay, it's okay.

446
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,184
They're friendly.

447
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,500
You're lucky your lassie stepped in.

448
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,548
I was about to make haggis
with your innards.

449
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,744
This is it. This is it, Azrael!

450
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:58,785
Smurfette's hair goes in here,
flows through the Smurf essence extractor,

451
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:01,185
and finally, I have my Smurfilator!

452
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:05,501
It's the pièce de résistance. The crème de la...

453
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,221
Would you care for a mint when you're done?

454
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:11,942
Yes, yes, yes!

455
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:13,789
With this precious elixir,

456
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:20,429
my sorcerous spell shall be powerful
beyond all measurable measurement.

457
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:28,903
This one tiny drop will give me
the power to capture them all.

458
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:40,230
This is great!

459
00:27:40,422 --> 00:27:44,024
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

460
00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:48,186
Next time you're feeling blue
Just let a smile begin

461
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:52,430
Happy things will come to you
So Smurf yourself a grin

462
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:54,991
It's so obvious
that what you're doing is wrong.

463
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:56,471
Oh, really? After you.

464
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:57,906
How crazy is this?

465
00:27:57,983 --> 00:28:01,071
There are little blue people
singing in our kitchen!

466
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,271
So you're sticking with your
"this is actually happening" theory?

467
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:08,903
Sorry.

468
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:13,704
Okay. It says here Smurfs are
mythical creatures from Belgium,

469
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:15,791
- also known as Schtroumpfs...
- Yeah.

470
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,624
Documented by Peyo.

471
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:21,864
Also says that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.

472
00:28:21,944 --> 00:28:24,268
It says they're mythical, Grace.

473
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,267
- I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
- That was great.

474
00:28:26,344 --> 00:28:27,785
Well, they look pretty real to me.

475
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:29,224
Come on.

476
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:35,151
- Excuse me.
- Okay, to review.

477
00:28:35,224 --> 00:28:39,546
You guys come from a magic forest
where you live in oversized mushrooms.

478
00:28:39,665 --> 00:28:41,629
- Yes.
- You're being chased by an evil wizard.

479
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:43,068
- Yeah.
- And you're trapped in New York

480
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,705
- until there's a blue moon...
- Very good.

481
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:47,545
And you like to use the
extremely imprecise term "smurf"

482
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,709
- for just about everything.
- Smurfxactly.

483
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:54,585
And you're all
named after your personalities?

484
00:28:54,745 --> 00:28:58,073
Do you get your names when you're born,
or after you've exhibited certain traits?

485
00:28:58,145 --> 00:28:59,269
- Yeah.
- Yep.

486
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:00,546
Yeah, whatever.

487
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,669
Master Winslow, there must be
something about the blue moon

488
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:05,306
on your magic window machine.

489
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:08,070
Just what is this magic searching device?

490
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,830
Right now, I'm using Google.

491
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:13,633
- Google.
- Google.

492
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:20,754
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs twice in one month.

493
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,431
"A figurative construct..."

494
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:24,354
- Much like yourselves.
- Hey!

495
00:29:24,426 --> 00:29:27,110
"But the moon itself
doesn't appear to be blue."

496
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,467
- What?
- Not blue?

497
00:29:28,546 --> 00:29:30,194
- Perfect!
- Now we'll never get home!

498
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:34,151
No cause for alarm, my little Smurfs.
If we're to open the portal home,

499
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:35,994
I'll just have to smurf us a potion

500
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,387
to invoke the blue moon.

501
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:38,754
You hear that, honey?

502
00:29:38,826 --> 00:29:41,150
They're only staying till
an actual blue moon rises.

503
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:44,635
Which could happen if the little blue
Santa man makes a magic potion,

504
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:47,314
which, at this point,
seems completely plausible.

505
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:48,992
- Want a bite?
- No, thank you.

506
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:52,636
Of course, the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned.

507
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:56,995
And when that might be is hard to determine
without the proper instrument.

508
00:29:57,507 --> 00:29:59,788
Master Winslow,
might I borrow your stargazer?

509
00:29:59,868 --> 00:30:00,915
My what-whatzer?

510
00:30:01,788 --> 00:30:03,708
He doesn't have a Stargazer. Do you?

511
00:30:03,787 --> 00:30:06,515
- This is all my fault.
- We're all gonna die.

512
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:09,228
- We're all gonna die!
- Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!

513
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,716
- One Panicky Smurf is enough!
- Hey!

514
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:14,709
Besides, Papa had a vision,
and everything turns out smurf y.

515
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,149
Right, Papa?

516
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:22,230
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.

517
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:30,314
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.

518
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:32,308
If I were a Smurf, where would I go?

519
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:35,677
You there, you there. Fancy pants.
Have you seen any little blue men?

520
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:38,193
- Absolutely. What price are we talking about?
- You're selling them?

521
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,277
- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie?
- Wait, what drawer?

522
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:42,750
- In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is this Lilly?

523
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,153
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl in my department.

524
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:47,357
Please, please. Please, young woodsman.

525
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:51,674
What does the temperature of this Lilly
have to do with the finding of Smurfs?

526
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,238
- Take your meds, man.
- What?

527
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,074
Is everyone in this realm completely insane?

528
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,874
Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.

529
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,034
Pardon me, wise sir?

530
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,271
By any chance, have you seen
any little blue men?

531
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,435
They're everywhere!

532
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,478
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you we were close, Azrael.

533
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,070
I know.

534
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,919
Now, just take one, everybody.
We have to make sure our smurf berries last.

535
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:22,239
Great. We're gonna be here how long?

536
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:24,712
Not long. First, we have to get a Stargazer.

537
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,919
Next, find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal

538
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:31,275
and we're home.
Very simple, my little Smurfs.

539
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:32,912
Bye, Elway.

540
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,195
Someone looks smurfalish!

541
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:37,355
- Why you wearing a leash?
- It's a tie.

542
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:39,592
- Does it keep your neck warm?
- No.

543
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:43,239
Clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft,
like a blacksmith's apron.

544
00:31:43,312 --> 00:31:45,440
I wear it because it's what
everyone wears at work.

545
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,552
What are you, you pasty giant?

546
00:31:47,632 --> 00:31:51,637
I try to get people to buy things
by analyzing market trend predictions.

547
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:55,313
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.

548
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,837
Look, I would love to explain
but I am super late. I gotta go.

549
00:31:57,912 --> 00:31:59,920
- I really don't have time for this.
- What?

550
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:01,636
You had one outfit on,

551
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,593
and now you're wearing something
completely different.

552
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,916
- Yeah. It...
- Now, Smurfette,

553
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:08,033
she probably got the other one dirty.

554
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:09,880
- Let's not embarrass her.
- Sorry.

555
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:12,233
Thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom,
Miss Grace.

556
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:16,077
- It's really nice.
- Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.

557
00:32:16,153 --> 00:32:20,681
I like our little mushroom, too. But you know,
somebody wants a bigger mushroom.

558
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:23,481
But, then you'd be further apart.

559
00:32:23,634 --> 00:32:26,634
You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.

560
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:28,318
I've got a baby on the way, so...

561
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:31,602
Wait, wait. We can't just
leave them here alone, without an adult.

562
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:34,794
I'm 546 years old.

563
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:36,358
Of course you are.

564
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:37,917
- They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
- All right.

565
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:40,078
- Love you.
- Okay.

566
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:41,962
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Grace! Goodbye.

567
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:44,282
By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere
if I were you.

568
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:45,634
Why not?

569
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:49,999
Our world doesn't do well
with visitors from other places.

570
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:51,722
I mean, look what happened to E.T.

571
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:55,075
It's a movie. A moving picture.

572
00:32:55,435 --> 00:32:57,476
Book. Just stay, okay?

573
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:01,562
Great. He's gone
and we still don't have a Stargazer.

574
00:33:01,635 --> 00:33:05,640
Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller,
he reads stars all the time.

575
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:08,880
Ergo, it's at his place of business.

576
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,639
Excellent work, Brainy.

577
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:12,602
What are we waiting for? Let's ride.

578
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:14,443
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Hey, stop it.

579
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:17,156
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Let's go get that Stargazer.

580
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:20,516
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh, no.

581
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:24,120
Clumsy, I think it might be best

582
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:26,204
if you stay here. You know?

583
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,679
Smurf an eye on the mushroom.

584
00:33:32,756 --> 00:33:35,201
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

585
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:37,724
- This way, Smurfs!
- Let's follow Mr. Winslow.

586
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:40,284
Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.

587
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:42,004
Smurf away!

588
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:44,161
- Let's smurf this joint.
- Is he down there?

589
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:45,404
- Taxi!
- Can you see him?

590
00:33:45,476 --> 00:33:47,800
Look, he's getting into
the mechanical wagon.

591
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:49,317
- Oh, no.
- Clearly that distance is too great...

592
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,961
- Off you go!
- No! Gutsy!

593
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:53,881
Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!

594
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:55,677
Goodbye, blue world.

595
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:57,405
Use your hat, you ninny!

596
00:33:57,637 --> 00:34:00,441
Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?

597
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:02,841
- There we go.
- Not funny, Gutsy.

598
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:05,801
- It was a little funny.
- Smurfs.

599
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:08,801
We're stopping. Hold on tight.

600
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,165
Not to me, Grouchy.

601
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:12,638
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.

602
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,726
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.

603
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:17,322
Master Winslow, we really need your help.

604
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:18,477
- Hey.
- Right here.

605
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:19,682
What are you doing here?

606
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:23,402
What part of "we need a Stargazer"
don't you understand, you numptie?

607
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:27,003
- You can't be out in public.
- Who are you talking to?

608
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:30,366
If we could just have a quick look around
in your predicting parlor...

609
00:34:30,438 --> 00:34:32,446
- We really wanna go home.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.

610
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:34,559
- Fine. Just come here, come here.
- Please, please.

611
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,206
All of you. Trust me.

612
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:37,927
Careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.

613
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:40,322
I'm not going... Hey!

614
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:42,439
- Be quiet.
- It's dark in here.

615
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,807
All right, who smurf ed?

616
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,563
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.

617
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,366
- That's not my hand.
- Hey, ticklish.

618
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,207
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Winslow.

619
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:56,199
- Congratulations on your promotion.
- Thank you.

620
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,288
I hope you guys like desk drawers,
because that's where...

621
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:00,487
- You're late.
- Odile!

622
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,319
You were in my office.

623
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,279
It's my building,
and we have much work to do.

624
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,403
The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?

625
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,208
Close. I had a crazy morning.

626
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,324
What are you doing?

627
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:17,520
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about all the concept ideas.

628
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,204
And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.

629
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,760
Nervous energy.

630
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:25,805
Nervous energy's what's going on up in here.

631
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:27,048
- I like it.
- Yep.

632
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,885
- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator.
- True that.

633
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:33,124
Hey! Stop it.

634
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,841
- Henri.
- Make it work.

635
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,768
You have no idea.

636
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:40,089
- What is this?
- Why did I get the armpit?

637
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:43,566
- Stop pushing me.
- Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.

638
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,441
Are you crazy?

639
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,322
- You're gonna get me fired.
- My hair!

640
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:50,522
I couldn't even breathe in there.
It smelled like the business end of a sheep.

641
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:51,890
- I don't see a Stargazer.
- How you doing?

642
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:55,726
I'm sorry, Master Winslow,
but we badly need to borrow your Stargazer.

643
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:59,371
I don't have a Stargazer, okay?

644
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:03,806
It's not something people of this century
just have, especially here.

645
00:36:03,882 --> 00:36:07,691
- Not happy.
- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.

646
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:11,123
Well, perhaps we could sing
to help things along.

647
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,367
And then we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.

648
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:17,651
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

649
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:20,166
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

650
00:36:21,122 --> 00:36:22,170
Stop.

651
00:36:22,243 --> 00:36:23,531
La la la la la la

652
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:24,690
Stop!

653
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:26,606
Sing a happy song

654
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:29,651
Come on. None of you find that song
just the tiniest bit annoying?

655
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:31,130
I find it annoying.

656
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,927
Well, what do you sing at work?

657
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:36,207
- I don't sing at work.
- What?

658
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:38,203
- And you have to wear a leash.
- Harsh.

659
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,444
I know. How about if we hum?

660
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,131
Please stop humming.

661
00:36:50,563 --> 00:36:52,004
I need to hone my message here.

662
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:53,288
I've got a message.

663
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:57,052
"Always chew with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.

664
00:36:57,123 --> 00:36:58,924
That's good. You should use that.

665
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:00,892
Or, "Dance and be happy."

666
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:02,851
How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?

667
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:05,892
- "Turn that frown upside down."
- "Always bet on blue."

668
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:09,205
- "Have a smurf y day."
- "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?

669
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:12,565
It's an embarrassment of riches.

670
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:13,965
They're giving you gold here.

671
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:15,932
- Thank you.
- Master Winslow,

672
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:19,365
you'll know it's the right message
if it comes from the heart.

673
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,689
- Right, Smurfs?
- Yeah.

674
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:21,965
- You said it.
- Absolutely.

675
00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:24,173
- Of course.
- Welcome to my world.

676
00:37:28,765 --> 00:37:31,614
I love emerging dramatically
through the smoke.

677
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:39,091
It makes... It makes me feel
so deliciously mysterious.

678
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:43,334
Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.

679
00:37:43,526 --> 00:37:44,605
What?

680
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:45,973
Where? Where?

681
00:37:47,486 --> 00:37:49,210
What?

682
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:54,727
Curses! So close.

683
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:56,770
What?

684
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,654
Theirs is upside-down.

685
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,968
Idiots. They painted it wrong. Come, Azrael.

686
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:07,054
- Hi.
- Hello.

687
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:08,131
What are you doing?

688
00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:10,455
Just greening things up a bit.

689
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:14,095
That's so sweet. That's very sweet but,

690
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,612
you know, I'm not so sure
this stuffs gonna grow out here.

691
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:20,168
We'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.

692
00:38:20,727 --> 00:38:22,211
So where is everybody else?

693
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:23,848
They went to get a Stargazer

694
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,132
so Papa can smurf a blue moon
to get us home.

695
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:27,408
And they went without you?

696
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:30,292
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?

697
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:34,289
- Hey!
- Sorry!

698
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:35,932
Why don't we come inside?

699
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:38,735
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that

700
00:38:38,808 --> 00:38:40,772
this new anti-aging cream can make

701
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:46,217
any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant.
It's almost magical.

702
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:48,330
Astonishing, really.

703
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,535
I see no transformation.

704
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:55,889
- Your potion has no power.
- Excuse me?

705
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:58,696
Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish,
if you ask me.

706
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:02,054
- Sir!
- This is my mother who you're speaking of.

707
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:04,610
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.

708
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:06,249
How sad for you in 30 years.

709
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:09,337
Henri, escort this lunatic out.

710
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:10,610
- "Lunatic"?
- Security!

711
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:13,210
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!

712
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:17,098
"Lunatic." Could a lunatic do this?

713
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,694
Alakazootiful!

714
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,090
How did you do that?

715
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:37,291
Yes, and seriously, me next.

716
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,778
So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards
never reveal their secrets.

717
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,414
Come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?

718
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,091
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.

719
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,770
- I need to know what you just did.
- Not telling.

720
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,934
Please, señor Can you do that again?

721
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:57,619
You may attempt to persuade me.

722
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,178
What is it that you desire?

723
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:03,492
Riches?

724
00:40:04,732 --> 00:40:05,736
Fame?

725
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:08,016
Fortune?

726
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:10,612
With my help,

727
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:17,060
the whole world
will know the name that is Garbagesmell.

728
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:20,016
Gargamel.

729
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:27,177
Yes. With my help, the whole world
will know the genius that is Gargamel.

730
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:30,732
L.m

731
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:37,056
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?

732
00:40:38,173 --> 00:40:41,458
So, even though
I'm what you might call accident-prone,

733
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:44,574
on the bright side, I did
land us all here in your little mushroom,

734
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:46,181
and we got to meet you and Patrick.

735
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:49,578
You're so sweet. And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.

736
00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:51,581
Well, I used to be.

737
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:53,054
- Really?
- Yeah.

738
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,133
So how long did it take you to...

739
00:40:57,973 --> 00:40:59,217
Gosh.

740
00:40:59,294 --> 00:41:01,378
Un-fumble your feet?

741
00:41:02,414 --> 00:41:06,975
Well, about as long as it takes to realize
that nobody's just one thing.

742
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:09,578
You can be anything you wanna be.

743
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:13,901
- "Hero Smurf."
- Yeah.

744
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:16,461
Probably not.

745
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,623
- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out.
- Let me show you.

746
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:22,262
First, you put your...

747
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:24,535
Works every time.

748
00:41:24,614 --> 00:41:26,982
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

749
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:30,382
This is a fascinating wind machine
you have here.

750
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:38,215
- Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help. Help!

751
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,935
They are everywhere
and they won't stop singing.

752
00:41:41,055 --> 00:41:44,503
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these guys.

753
00:41:47,576 --> 00:41:49,223
Señor Gargamel, I'll be frank.

754
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:55,304
Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill
to get what you have in that ring.

755
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:56,936
Not if we Kill them first.

756
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:01,456
Let's see, we're going to need some knights,
preferably in shining armor,

757
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,456
some bowmen, poison arrows.

758
00:42:05,096 --> 00:42:06,417
I like the way you think.

759
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:08,221
And some spikes to mount their heads on.

760
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:09,819
Well, it is all about the presentation.

761
00:42:10,016 --> 00:42:13,705
And, of course, all of our testing
would be animal cruelty-free?

762
00:42:13,936 --> 00:42:16,576
What, they pay extra for the animal cruelty?
Is that it?

763
00:42:16,816 --> 00:42:17,940
Get out of here.

764
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:23,505
You have a wicked sense of humor.

765
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:25,497
- We like that, don't we?
- Hey, out of here!

766
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:26,744
Henri?

767
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,504
I said, get out of here.

768
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:32,738
Señor Gargamel,
now you must assure me, darling,

769
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:36,579
that you can recreate whatever it was
that you did to my mother,

770
00:42:36,897 --> 00:42:38,741
but on a massive scale.

771
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:42,578
Do that, and the world will worship you.

772
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:45,058
- Did you hear that, Azrael?
- Yeah.

773
00:42:45,418 --> 00:42:52,227
"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue
like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...

774
00:42:53,857 --> 00:42:55,221
Heretic. Yes, thank you.

775
00:42:56,578 --> 00:42:59,263
Thank the gods, a chamber pot.

776
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:03,502
This swill that you call Dom Pérignon
has gone straight to my nether regions.

777
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:16,943
Here, toss this out the window, yeah?
Today, please.

778
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:20,579
Now, to the matter at hand.

779
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:22,984
So do we have a deal, señor?

780
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:26,743
Not quite, my sweet maiden.

781
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:32,308
You see, first I must have my Smurfs.

782
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,665
You guys just have to understand that
Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.

783
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:40,748
So if you could just lay low for a little bit...

784
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,268
You have my word of honor, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not move from this bag.

785
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,944
- Okay, good.
- Stargazer!

786
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:48,228
- What?
- Stargazer! Let's go!

787
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,467
- Everybody out! Come on!
- No, no, no!

788
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,587
- Guys, let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no!

789
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,620
- Full Smurf ahead.
- No, wait, wait!

790
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:53,988
Hit the deck!

791
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,980
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!

792
00:43:57,061 --> 00:43:58,741
- Save me!
- Hey, look out, Brainy.

793
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:00,348
Can't everyone just slow down

794
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,468
- and enjoy life?
- Get off me. Get off!

795
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:02,545
Wait for it.

796
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:04,221
I gotta get me one of those.

797
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,548
Oh, my gosh!

798
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:07,268
- Hey, lady! Hey!
- Wait, wait. Hold on!

799
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:11,062
When we get inside, spread out
and find that Stargazer.

800
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:12,265
Come on, Smurfs!

801
00:44:33,662 --> 00:44:35,703
- Hey.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have gone AWOL.

802
00:44:35,822 --> 00:44:36,902
Grace, are you running?

803
00:44:36,981 --> 00:44:38,422
No, no, I'm totally fine,
but they need your help!

804
00:44:38,502 --> 00:44:40,269
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna
get themselves killed!

805
00:44:40,342 --> 00:44:42,383
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us a tiny thank-you note

806
00:44:42,463 --> 00:44:44,504
when they get back to shroom town.
Right after they invent paper.

807
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:45,746
Patrick, they need you.

808
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:47,390
- Honey...
- Patrick, I need you.

809
00:44:47,822 --> 00:44:48,826
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!

810
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:50,303
All right. Where are you?

811
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:55,584
The man is a lunatic. It's not going to work.
I don't know, he needs Smoops.

812
00:44:55,662 --> 00:44:56,710
- "Smurfs."
- Smarps.

813
00:44:56,783 --> 00:44:59,544
No, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...

814
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:00,783
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

815
00:45:00,863 --> 00:45:02,151
You call that groveling, you fool?

816
00:45:03,343 --> 00:45:05,503
Every village has an idiot. What?

817
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:10,348
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!

818
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:11,984
Smurf thief!

819
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:13,591
Come on, guys, the dolls are here!

820
00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:17,265
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer.
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer...

821
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:21,945
So that's where all the unicorns went.

822
00:45:22,064 --> 00:45:24,792
I'm not afraid to go off on my own,
I thought you might like the company.

823
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,271
Fine. Then hang on.

824
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:32,232
A Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.

825
00:45:33,624 --> 00:45:34,671
Perfect.

826
00:45:36,544 --> 00:45:40,113
Time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!

827
00:45:41,064 --> 00:45:42,592
That'll put some air up your skirt!

828
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:47,432
Gotta be a Stargazer up here somewhere.

829
00:45:47,624 --> 00:45:48,792
Predator!

830
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:53,069
Smurf droppings.

831
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:58,273
These are disgustingly tasty.

832
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:01,586
Hello.

833
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:04,350
Oh, creepy.

834
00:46:04,425 --> 00:46:07,307
I hope they weren't looking
for a stargazer, too.

835
00:46:07,385 --> 00:46:08,946
Stargazers, stargazers...

836
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:10,233
Dresses!

837
00:46:10,306 --> 00:46:13,590
You mean I can have
more than one kind of dress?

838
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:14,670
What?

839
00:46:14,746 --> 00:46:16,710
Papa, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna find those...

840
00:46:16,786 --> 00:46:18,794
- Stargazers.
- They're dangerously high.

841
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:21,234
You're right.
We're gonna need something tall.

842
00:46:28,106 --> 00:46:30,867
- Don't you think someone will notice us?
- Just act natural.

843
00:46:30,947 --> 00:46:32,475
- I'm a bear.
- Brainy!

844
00:46:34,227 --> 00:46:35,994
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.

845
00:46:36,147 --> 00:46:37,915
Hold still, stairs!

846
00:46:38,347 --> 00:46:39,788
Look at the stair-climbing toy!

847
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:40,990
- Hey.
- What is that?

848
00:46:41,106 --> 00:46:42,154
- Let me see it.
- Careful.

849
00:46:42,227 --> 00:46:44,114
- I want one, too, Mommy!
- Let me see.

850
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:46,587
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.

851
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:49,832
Just say who you are
and be who you say, right?

852
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:52,315
I can't seem to get it to scan.

853
00:46:52,387 --> 00:46:54,548
My son wants one of those
blue animatronic things.

854
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:56,715
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?

855
00:46:56,787 --> 00:46:58,195
- My daughter wants pink.
- I'm sorry.

856
00:46:58,267 --> 00:46:59,511
What aisle did you find this on?

857
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:00,635
- I'll take the floor model.
- I was here first.

858
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:03,556
- There's a line.
- Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?

859
00:47:03,668 --> 00:47:04,835
What? Ice Bat?

860
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:06,432
It comes in pink.

861
00:47:10,548 --> 00:47:12,273
Smurf thief! Stop!

862
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:23,433
Do I use my grouchiness as a wall
because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?

863
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:24,833
You bet.

864
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:26,509
Smurf!

865
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:27,877
But I've got feelings.

866
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:31,189
No. No, I can't be out already!
What was I thinking?

867
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:34,756
Wasting my only drop of Smurf essence
on that old hag?

868
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:43,873
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to have it in stock.

869
00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:47,190
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!

870
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:50,713
- Don't you people have any boundaries?
- Grab it!

871
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:52,273
I'm not a toy!

872
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,474
- Where is she?
- Where'd she go?

873
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:54,554
- There she is!
- There she is!

874
00:47:54,629 --> 00:47:55,950
Hey, this dress is mine!

875
00:47:56,269 --> 00:47:58,550
- Smurfette!
- Wait, I'm shopping.

876
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,994
- Let's shop later.
- Go! Come on!

877
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,798
- Patrick! Patrick, help!
- Clumsy, come here!

878
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:06,952
A giant's after me! She's huge!

879
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,954
Hey, that's mine!

880
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,111
Sorry, little girl, this one's not for...

881
00:48:11,311 --> 00:48:13,035
- Mommy!
- Really?

882
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:18,912
Don't ever forget that one magical moment
our two worlds met.

883
00:48:18,991 --> 00:48:20,999
And I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.

884
00:48:22,951 --> 00:48:27,119
Can you just say one thing, please?
I'm dying here.

885
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,479
Hey!

886
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:30,231
That's one!

887
00:48:30,871 --> 00:48:33,599
Technically, when loading cargo
onto the head of a bear,

888
00:48:33,672 --> 00:48:35,800
- one should distribute the weight...
- Brainy, just pull.

889
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,840
Ahoy, mateys! What are ya waiting for?
We're drawin' a crowd.

890
00:48:39,552 --> 00:48:41,593
- Show-off.
- Oh, dear. They think we're toys.

891
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:44,672
Hold onto your knickers, boys,
it's about to get grisly.

892
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:47,992
- Don't let me fall!
- Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!

893
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:49,273
- Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
- They're getting away!

894
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:50,595
Let's go, go, go!

895
00:48:50,672 --> 00:48:52,713
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.

896
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,876
- Hold on!
- I think we lost them.

897
00:48:55,712 --> 00:48:57,120
- Again with the head.
- Oh, dear.

898
00:48:57,192 --> 00:49:00,073
- Out of the way or I'll caber toss ya!
- Where did you learn how to drive?

899
00:49:00,153 --> 00:49:02,521
- You think you can do better?
- Yes, I do believe I can do better.

900
00:49:05,073 --> 00:49:06,753
Two more!

901
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:09,677
- Brainy! Gutsy!
- Papa!

902
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:13,120
Grace, that's Gargamel!

903
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,602
- Oh, you again! Get your paws off me!
- No, no, no, no.

904
00:49:20,593 --> 00:49:21,914
Bad kitty!

905
00:49:22,353 --> 00:49:23,597
Oh, I hate that Cat!

906
00:49:30,194 --> 00:49:31,482
Gargamel.

907
00:49:31,674 --> 00:49:33,114
Smurfette.

908
00:49:33,194 --> 00:49:35,475
More lovely than ever.

909
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:38,882
Oh, Gargamel,
I guess you've outsmarted us again.

910
00:49:39,953 --> 00:49:41,361
Or not!

911
00:49:43,034 --> 00:49:46,875
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!

912
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:49,238
- Get out!
- Let me help you with that.

913
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:53,763
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...

914
00:49:58,594 --> 00:49:59,598
Yahoo!

915
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:03,158
- Patrick.
- Hey.

916
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:06,239
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

917
00:50:06,315 --> 00:50:07,875
- I'll get the Stargazer.
- I'll get the Smurfs.

918
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:18,723
That's him! He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!

919
00:50:18,795 --> 00:50:20,475
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.

920
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:23,796
- Do not resist. Do not resist!
- Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!

921
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:27,844
Or suffer the wrath
of the great and powerful...

922
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:36,080
Let me... Let me see here...

923
00:50:57,677 --> 00:51:00,045
How can you be the only girl in the village?

924
00:51:00,117 --> 00:51:03,599
Well, see, I wasn't brought
by a stork like the others.

925
00:51:04,717 --> 00:51:08,198
I was created by Gargamel
to trap the other Smurfs.

926
00:51:08,437 --> 00:51:11,165
Wow. And then what happened?

927
00:51:11,437 --> 00:51:12,681
Papa saved me.

928
00:51:12,758 --> 00:51:17,483
He cast a special spell and then helped me
become the Smurf I was meant to be.

929
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:19,718
No. Play it safe.

930
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:30,284
"Odile, pending your approval,
it's ready to go to the billboard agency."

931
00:51:32,558 --> 00:51:35,799
Well, here goes nothing.

932
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:40,846
- Papa should be done by now.
- Yeah. Enough with the suspense.

933
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:42,882
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too.

934
00:51:42,998 --> 00:51:46,643
Now that that wily wizard's got our scent,
it's a whole new wager.

935
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:49,480
Without that blue moon,
our giblets are gravy.

936
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:53,687
Well, it's off.

937
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:56,967
Time to either celebrate
or file for unemployment.

938
00:51:58,919 --> 00:51:59,999
Hey, what's wrong?

939
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:01,807
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Oh. it's okay.

940
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,324
- That one's hypersmurfilating.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

941
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,284
- It's all this waitin' that's killin' us.
- Yeah.

942
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,884
I know the feeling.

943
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,040
Better yet...

944
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,928
I know the cure.

945
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,000
You just match the colors with the buttons.

946
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,644
You try.

947
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:30,969
Hey! Go, Grouchy!

948
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,885
- You're good!
- Nice one!

949
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:36,605
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!

950
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:37,805
Walk this way...

951
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:38,961
You sing.

952
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:41,965
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss

953
00:52:43,921 --> 00:52:45,329
It's a rock face.

954
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:47,649
- It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
- Huh?

955
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:48,725
Never mind.

956
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:50,089
- Like this
- Like this

957
00:52:53,722 --> 00:52:55,883
Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy

958
00:52:55,961 --> 00:52:57,729
Little skirts climbing way up her knee

959
00:52:57,802 --> 00:52:59,886
Not another single girl
in the whole smurf in' world

960
00:52:59,962 --> 00:53:01,970
And I can't believe
she's lookin' at me

961
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:03,089
- it's a complete
- Surrender

962
00:53:03,162 --> 00:53:04,329
- To the power of her
- Gender

963
00:53:04,402 --> 00:53:06,202
So I close my eyes and make a wish

964
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:07,329
- I just want to
- Savor

965
00:53:07,402 --> 00:53:08,449
- All her smurf berry
- Flavor

966
00:53:08,522 --> 00:53:10,726
So I smurf ed her just a little kiss
Like this

967
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,403
- Check out Clumsy.
- Whoa, Clumsy.

968
00:53:18,482 --> 00:53:20,283
- You found your niche.
- Yeah!

969
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:22,610
Clumsy, holdin' it down. Look at him go!

970
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,571
- Come on, Gutsy!
- Here we go!

971
00:53:24,643 --> 00:53:27,404
Yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!

972
00:53:27,482 --> 00:53:28,890
- Go, Gutsy!
- That's right.

973
00:53:30,403 --> 00:53:32,727
- Careful.
- Get your smurf on!

974
00:53:32,803 --> 00:53:34,244
- Gutsy!
- Nice!

975
00:53:34,323 --> 00:53:35,928
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

976
00:53:36,123 --> 00:53:37,606
That was rare.

977
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,493
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?

978
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,645
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?

979
00:54:02,724 --> 00:54:05,932
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.

980
00:54:07,724 --> 00:54:09,208
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

981
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:10,813
Sorry, boys.

982
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:14,329
Yeah, that cools the giblets.

983
00:54:14,404 --> 00:54:17,809
Nothin' like a cool breeze
through my Enchanted Forest.

984
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:25,333
- It's approved.
- What?

985
00:54:25,405 --> 00:54:27,325
- She approved it. She approved the ad!
- She loved it?

986
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:31,093
Well, she said "approved,"
so coming from her, that's love.

987
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:32,646
Oh, my goodness!

988
00:54:32,726 --> 00:54:34,134
- Patrick, yeah!
- You owned it!

989
00:54:34,325 --> 00:54:36,529
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!

990
00:54:37,325 --> 00:54:38,613
Yeah.

991
00:54:39,205 --> 00:54:41,289
No jumping, no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.

992
00:54:41,526 --> 00:54:43,927
- Should I send it? I'm not going to.
- Yes! Do it!

993
00:54:44,005 --> 00:54:45,129
- Do it this minute.
- I will do it. All right.

994
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:46,854
Do it, do it.

995
00:54:46,926 --> 00:54:48,006
Go, go, go!

996
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:50,607
Tomorrow this'll be on every billboard
in New York City.

997
00:54:50,726 --> 00:54:52,134
It's a go, laddie boy!

998
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:55,527
- Well done, Master Winslow.
- Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.

999
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:57,211
- Papa, are your calculations done?
- Yeah!

1000
00:54:57,486 --> 00:54:58,927
I'm nearly out of smurf berries.

1001
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:02,214
It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.

1002
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:04,171
But we are going home, right?

1003
00:55:04,247 --> 00:55:07,171
Of course. Just not tonight.

1004
00:55:08,327 --> 00:55:09,735
Now, off to bed.

1005
00:55:13,887 --> 00:55:17,248
I was hoping I'd be sleeping
in my mushroom tonight.

1006
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,172
I miss the other Smurfs.

1007
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:21,211
Me, too.

1008
00:55:21,288 --> 00:55:23,688
I've never spent the night away
from home before.

1009
00:55:23,927 --> 00:55:28,095
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?

1010
00:55:29,928 --> 00:55:32,012
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.

1011
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,852
Everything's going to be just fine.

1012
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,409
Papa?

1013
00:55:37,487 --> 00:55:41,775
Do you really believe we're ever gonna
get home to the other Smurfs?

1014
00:55:42,288 --> 00:55:43,651
Don't worry.

1015
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:46,489
We'll be reunited with the others
soon enough.

1016
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,933
If only the stars would align.

1017
00:56:02,328 --> 00:56:05,810
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.

1018
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,897
- Hey, Jokey Smurf.
- G reedy. Narrator.

1019
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:11,854
- Painter. Baker.
- Harmony.

1020
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:16,217
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such nice things to say.

1021
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:19,330
I'll tell you who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.

1022
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,534
- Aye.
- Yeah.

1023
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:24,010
He's always so nice,
but when he leaves you feel bad.

1024
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,218
Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.

1025
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:31,370
Oh, hello, little moth.

1026
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:37,059
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get them back.

1027
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,175
Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.

1028
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,654
Both of us meant to soar.

1029
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,531
Go now, and bring back an army
of mighty eagles to free me.

1030
00:56:49,051 --> 00:56:52,499
Fly, tiny eagle.
Fly and bring back your brethren.

1031
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,734
Fly! Fly!

1032
00:56:55,051 --> 00:56:56,372
Fly!

1033
00:57:00,811 --> 00:57:03,855
Okay. Let's see here.

1034
00:57:03,931 --> 00:57:05,011
Hey.

1035
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:07,292
I'm guessing you have
a long night ahead of you.

1036
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:11,612
- You guys drink coffee?
- Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1037
00:57:13,651 --> 00:57:19,140
So tell me, that weird guy
in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?

1038
00:57:19,212 --> 00:57:21,852
- Gargamel?
- He's not really a wizard, is he?

1039
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:25,857
Not the smartest of sorcerers,
but dangerous just the same.

1040
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:27,696
Thank you.

1041
00:57:28,852 --> 00:57:32,376
Back home, I could hold him at bay
with a spell or two.

1042
00:57:32,572 --> 00:57:35,060
But here, without my books and potions...

1043
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:39,694
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?

1044
00:57:40,013 --> 00:57:41,137
Well, what are you gonna do?

1045
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:45,293
I'll do anything and everything I can do
to get my Smurfs home.

1046
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:49,178
I won't ever give up. They're my family.

1047
00:57:49,653 --> 00:57:52,021
And you never give up on family.

1048
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:58,414
Doesn't it freak you out sometimes

1049
00:57:59,134 --> 00:58:02,178
having all those little guys
depending on you?

1050
00:58:03,534 --> 00:58:05,782
I mean, what if you screw up?

1051
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,578
How'd you know when you were ready?

1052
00:58:08,974 --> 00:58:11,135
Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.

1053
00:58:13,294 --> 00:58:15,334
Yeah, right. Scratch that.

1054
00:58:15,414 --> 00:58:17,979
- Probably not the best idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

1055
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,458
Let me ask you something.

1056
00:58:20,054 --> 00:58:23,055
Why did you come for us today
when your Grace called?

1057
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:26,416
She needed me. I could hear it in her voice.

1058
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:30,699
Well, that's what being a papa is.

1059
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:33,143
When it comes time, you just do.

1060
00:58:34,575 --> 00:58:37,695
And knowing what to do
doesn't come from up here.

1061
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:44,536
It comes from here, where it matters most.

1062
00:58:45,695 --> 00:58:47,223
My spleen?

1063
00:58:47,296 --> 00:58:49,500
No, your heart.

1064
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:53,784
I'm trying to have a moment here,
you whippersnapper.

1065
00:58:57,656 --> 00:59:01,300
- You're a good papa, Papa.
- And you'll be a good one, too.

1066
00:59:18,777 --> 00:59:20,621
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.

1067
00:59:20,697 --> 00:59:22,901
Come on, baby, stop playing.

1068
00:59:24,216 --> 00:59:27,217
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?

1069
00:59:28,176 --> 00:59:30,261
You know what happens to people
who sit on my bench?

1070
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:32,185
Be gone with you, behemoth,

1071
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:36,865
for I have instructed a moth
to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles

1072
00:59:36,977 --> 00:59:38,625
to free me from this confine.

1073
00:59:39,378 --> 00:59:40,818
- Get up, Grandpa!
- Hey.

1074
00:59:41,817 --> 00:59:43,662
You see? You see?

1075
00:59:43,738 --> 00:59:47,066
The dungeon isn't built that can hold
the likes of Gargamel.

1076
00:59:47,218 --> 00:59:52,347
Behold my glorious army of... Flies?

1077
00:59:52,418 --> 00:59:54,983
- Flies? I Said "to fly." "Fly."
- What is this?

1078
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:58,582
Not "flies," you light-loving moron.

1079
00:59:59,538 --> 01:00:01,622
All right, up, up, up, bother it all.

1080
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:05,063
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!

1081
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:07,267
So long, scallywags!

1082
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:13,264
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!

1083
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:16,547
- Oh, that's nasty.
- Go around it. Stupid flies.

1084
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:17,939
Wait, take me with you!

1085
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:20,027
Wait! Wait!

1086
01:00:23,779 --> 01:00:26,267
To my castle for more essence!

1087
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:38,340
Here they come, here they come.

1088
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,345
- Pretty smurf y, if I do say so myself.
- Yeah.

1089
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:47,301
Come on, Elway, right over here.
Good boy. Thank you very much.

1090
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,180
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.

1091
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,188
- There we are.
- Clumsy.

1092
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,620
- Blue thumbs.
- This is unbelievable.

1093
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,064
I think there's too much pink.

1094
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:00,425
Just because your name is Grouchy
doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.

1095
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,788
Yeah, it does.

1096
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,181
- Smurfette.
- Hi.

1097
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:06,545
- High five. High four.
- High four.

1098
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:11,946
Great news! The stars have revealed
a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.

1099
01:01:13,501 --> 01:01:15,661
- We're going home! Yay!
- I knew you'd do it, Papa!

1100
01:01:15,741 --> 01:01:17,421
- All right!
- Smurftastic!

1101
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:19,029
I never doubted it for a second.

1102
01:01:19,102 --> 01:01:22,986
It has to be done tonight,
between first star and high moon.

1103
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,941
That's our only chance.

1104
01:01:25,021 --> 01:01:27,902
But we'll need a magic spell
that works in this realm

1105
01:01:28,022 --> 01:01:29,909
to open the portal home.

1106
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:33,026
- Master Winslow, a question, please.
- Yeah, shoot.

1107
01:01:33,142 --> 01:01:35,302
Is there a place that sells spells?

1108
01:01:35,382 --> 01:01:36,583
No.

1109
01:01:36,702 --> 01:01:40,030
- Is there a place that proffers potions?
- Yeah, no.

1110
01:01:40,382 --> 01:01:42,269
How about old books?

1111
01:01:42,582 --> 01:01:44,950
Wait, there's an antique book shop
right near where I work.

1112
01:01:45,023 --> 01:01:46,823
- Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah.
- Dr. Wong's something.

1113
01:01:46,902 --> 01:01:50,427
- Perfect. That'll do.
- Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.

1114
01:01:50,503 --> 01:01:52,347
- Yeah!
- I love being almost home.

1115
01:01:52,423 --> 01:01:54,343
Hey! Smurf hug!

1116
01:01:55,863 --> 01:01:57,631
Oh, I love you guys!

1117
01:01:57,783 --> 01:01:59,191
Bring it in, big fella.

1118
01:01:59,263 --> 01:02:00,791
- I wouldn't...
- Come on, we know you want to.

1119
01:02:00,863 --> 01:02:01,987
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on, Patrick.

1120
01:02:02,103 --> 01:02:03,424
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Go on, big fella.

1121
01:02:03,543 --> 01:02:04,951
- Here he comes!
- Smurf hug!

1122
01:02:05,023 --> 01:02:07,064
- We're goin' home!
- Hey there.

1123
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,143
Hey, get up here.

1124
01:02:20,224 --> 01:02:22,712
- That's it, laddie. Nice one.
- What's that?

1125
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:24,868
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!

1126
01:02:25,184 --> 01:02:27,912
Oh, look!
We don't have to make a blue moon.

1127
01:02:28,024 --> 01:02:29,628
We've already got one.

1128
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:31,185
- Really?
- What?

1129
01:02:31,264 --> 01:02:34,145
- Look, guys, right over there.
- No, it isn't.

1130
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:36,752
It is. Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.

1131
01:02:39,104 --> 01:02:41,308
That's the wrong ad.

1132
01:02:51,424 --> 01:02:52,548
What happened to my office?

1133
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:55,746
We fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!

1134
01:02:55,865 --> 01:02:59,390
No. No, no, no. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

1135
01:03:01,225 --> 01:03:03,145
Someone sent this
to the ad agency last night.

1136
01:03:03,225 --> 01:03:04,785
- Who messed with my computer?
- I dunno.

1137
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:07,549
- None of my Smurfs would...
- Wasn't me.

1138
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:15,467
I Gargamel!, sorta, tripped.

1139
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:17,947
Yeah, well, you Gargamel!, sorta,
just got me fired.

1140
01:03:18,266 --> 01:03:19,946
You sent the wrong file.

1141
01:03:20,026 --> 01:03:22,471
- Patrick, it was just an accident.
- What am I supposed to do, Grace?

1142
01:03:22,586 --> 01:03:24,986
You said that they would bring good luck.
This is anything but good.

1143
01:03:25,066 --> 01:03:27,434
I never should've let this happen.
I should've said no.

1144
01:03:27,546 --> 01:03:31,311
I never wanted a house
full of little people running around!

1145
01:03:34,946 --> 01:03:36,671
Blue. Little blue...

1146
01:03:36,867 --> 01:03:37,991
Okay...

1147
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:40,187
Patrick.

1148
01:03:42,306 --> 01:03:43,430
What are you doing?

1149
01:03:43,547 --> 01:03:45,194
Going to try to save my job.

1150
01:03:45,307 --> 01:03:48,035
We never intended to be a burden,
Master Winslow.

1151
01:03:48,107 --> 01:03:49,907
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...

1152
01:03:49,987 --> 01:03:53,871
Stop saying "smurf" for everything.
What does that even mean? Smurf!

1153
01:03:54,267 --> 01:03:55,555
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!

1154
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:58,912
There's no call
for that kind of language, laddie.

1155
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:00,027
See?

1156
01:04:00,547 --> 01:04:01,868
Okay, Patrick, wait.

1157
01:04:03,148 --> 01:04:04,828
- Hey, hey!
- Will you...

1158
01:04:04,908 --> 01:04:06,588
- Wait, Patrick.
- Maybe I can try to fix it.

1159
01:04:06,668 --> 01:04:07,956
Just stop and listen to me
for a second, please.

1160
01:04:08,028 --> 01:04:10,832
- What?
- Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?

1161
01:04:10,908 --> 01:04:12,872
And I hope that you can straighten that out.

1162
01:04:12,988 --> 01:04:15,269
But you are so not seeing
the big picture here.

1163
01:04:16,029 --> 01:04:19,389
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening right now.

1164
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,713
Of all the people on the planet,

1165
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:23,109
those magical little creatures came to us.

1166
01:04:23,228 --> 01:04:24,833
They chose us.

1167
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:28,913
Don't you see
how absolutely amazing that is?

1168
01:04:29,189 --> 01:04:31,350
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.

1169
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:33,349
This is our blue moon.

1170
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,950
And if you don't stop
for just a second to see that,

1171
01:04:38,189 --> 01:04:39,553
you're gonna miss it.

1172
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,154
Hey, hey. Taxi!

1173
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:52,911
Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!

1174
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,194
There's got to be some essence
in here somewhere!

1175
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:58,118
NOT DOW.

1176
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:59,758
What? What?

1177
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:08,235
Very, very well done, my little friend.

1178
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:12,199
And to think, I almost ate you that time.

1179
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:18,040
Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick,
the rouge merchant.

1180
01:05:18,271 --> 01:05:21,479
He will lead us to our
elusive little blue quarry.

1181
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:25,356
Don't you just have a switch or something
to shut them off?

1182
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:27,195
Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?

1183
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:30,752
Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads down now,
I don't have a job tomorrow.

1184
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:03,916
Smurf me.

1185
01:06:50,354 --> 01:06:51,958
Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?

1186
01:06:52,034 --> 01:06:53,082
According to the searching device,

1187
01:06:53,154 --> 01:06:55,283
we take the F machine
two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.

1188
01:06:55,395 --> 01:06:57,556
- Look out, Brainy.
- "Chinatown," birdbrain.

1189
01:06:57,634 --> 01:06:58,801
- Smurftito, smurftato.
- Here it is.

1190
01:06:58,915 --> 01:06:59,919
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go, let's go.

1191
01:07:00,035 --> 01:07:01,715
- Mind the gap.
- Wait? Are we sure about this?

1192
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:02,996
- What?
- Jump!

1193
01:07:03,075 --> 01:07:04,843
- Oh, my.
- Not happy.

1194
01:07:06,675 --> 01:07:09,043
Come on, Brainy_
Let's poke around this great steel carriage.

1195
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:11,283
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.

1196
01:07:14,515 --> 01:07:16,043
That was great.

1197
01:07:17,035 --> 01:07:19,643
I hope we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this...

1198
01:07:21,515 --> 01:07:22,683
For smurf's sake.

1199
01:07:22,755 --> 01:07:24,884
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.

1200
01:07:24,996 --> 01:07:26,197
Oh, it smells like butter in here.

1201
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,120
Where do you suppose
this magic bookstore could be?

1202
01:07:28,195 --> 01:07:29,800
- Wait a minute.
- There it is.

1203
01:07:30,036 --> 01:07:31,237
- It's closed.
- Figures.

1204
01:07:31,476 --> 01:07:33,680
We have to find a way in. Come on.

1205
01:07:40,036 --> 01:07:41,716
I'm gettin' too old for this.

1206
01:07:42,756 --> 01:07:43,957
- Brainy.
- Gutsy.

1207
01:07:44,036 --> 01:07:45,204
All right, everybody.

1208
01:07:45,317 --> 01:07:46,364
- Hey.
- Wow.

1209
01:07:46,436 --> 01:07:47,483
This place looks creepy to me.

1210
01:07:47,556 --> 01:07:49,324
It's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.

1211
01:07:49,397 --> 01:07:51,601
Let's just get the book
and get outta here.

1212
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:55,002
You're right. This book of spells
is our ticket home.

1213
01:07:56,837 --> 01:08:01,879
I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire,
limitless power and world adulation.

1214
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:05,006
Now why does it have to be so hard?

1215
01:08:10,518 --> 01:08:13,965
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.

1216
01:08:14,118 --> 01:08:16,519
Wherever did you hear
that ear-damning squall?

1217
01:08:16,678 --> 01:08:17,758
It's your little blue men.

1218
01:08:17,837 --> 01:08:20,041
I saw them going into the bookstore
around the corner.

1219
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:24,726
You know, that song is really annoying.

1220
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,886
Cautiously excited.

1221
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:32,202
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.

1222
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:34,843
Look at all these amazing books.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

1223
01:08:34,959 --> 01:08:37,327
No, this isn't it.
You see anything, Smurfette?

1224
01:08:37,478 --> 01:08:40,719
Nothin' up here, guys. Look out below!

1225
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:44,366
- I've got somethin', lads.
- Great job, Gutsy.

1226
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:46,284
Oh. Nearly there.

1227
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:51,884
- Well done.
- Just a minute. That's it. There we go.

1228
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:53,240
Ah, yes.

1229
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:55,567
"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs. ”

1230
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:57,803
Peyo.

1231
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,284
- That's us.
- Yes, this is the one.

1232
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,964
- Look at that.
- Wow.

1233
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:07,724
Well, I'll be smurf ed.

1234
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:10,687
The secret runes are hidden in the drawing.

1235
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,288
You see all that in there?

1236
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,965
Look here, at the patterns on this page.

1237
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,520
Openous-lockicuss.

1238
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,641
What?

1239
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:40,565
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me" written all over it.

1240
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:50,923
Oh, that's just plain naughty.

1241
01:09:51,241 --> 01:09:56,206
All that remains now is to return
to the waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.

1242
01:09:56,282 --> 01:09:58,802
- And we can go home?
- And we can go home.

1243
01:09:58,921 --> 01:10:00,930
- Oh, you're going home, all right.
- No.

1244
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:04,850
To a little place I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle,

1245
01:10:05,162 --> 01:10:08,763
where your essence shall finally be mine.

1246
01:10:09,362 --> 01:10:11,086
- The dragon wand.
- No!

1247
01:10:11,162 --> 01:10:12,242
It's...

1248
01:10:12,362 --> 01:10:14,042
Oh, please, please, allow me.

1249
01:10:15,483 --> 01:10:17,731
- It's Gargamel!
- Run, Smurfs!

1250
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:19,603
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Go, go, go!

1251
01:10:19,723 --> 01:10:20,770
Wait for me!

1252
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:22,851
- To the door!
- Smurfentine! Smurfentine!

1253
01:10:22,922 --> 01:10:24,810
- Hurry!
- Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.

1254
01:10:24,883 --> 01:10:26,007
After all,

1255
01:10:26,123 --> 01:10:28,850
what is the hunt without the thrill!

1256
01:10:32,883 --> 01:10:34,007
No!

1257
01:10:42,443 --> 01:10:43,731
- We gotta go! Move!
- Run!

1258
01:10:43,803 --> 01:10:45,364
- Get goin', Smurfs!
- Faster, faster.

1259
01:10:45,484 --> 01:10:46,488
Let's get outta here.

1260
01:10:46,604 --> 01:10:50,172
Brainy, take the spell, brew the potion
and smurf the moon tonight.

1261
01:10:50,564 --> 01:10:51,688
It has to be tonight.

1262
01:10:51,764 --> 01:10:53,247
Me? Smurf the moon?

1263
01:10:53,324 --> 01:10:55,408
- No, no, I'm not ready.
- You have to be.

1264
01:10:56,644 --> 01:10:59,012
- Go. And no matter what happens...
- Papa?

1265
01:10:59,084 --> 01:11:00,612
- ...Do not come back for me.
- What?

1266
01:11:00,684 --> 01:11:01,928
- Papa, no!
- No!

1267
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:04,208
- Papa!
- What are you waiting for, Gargamel?

1268
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:06,605
Come to papa, Papa!

1269
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,968
- Just go!
- Papa!

1270
01:11:10,085 --> 01:11:11,373
- Papa!
- No!

1271
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:12,853
Keep movin', lass.

1272
01:11:13,004 --> 01:11:15,612
- Do as Papa said.
- Papa!

1273
01:11:16,164 --> 01:11:19,209
Is that all that you've got, Gargamel?

1274
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:32,490
What's gonna happen to Papa?

1275
01:11:32,566 --> 01:11:36,407
Papa told us to smurf the moon,
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

1276
01:11:36,806 --> 01:11:38,410
Come on. We don't have much time.

1277
01:11:38,606 --> 01:11:39,850
"Come on"? Come on, where?

1278
01:11:39,926 --> 01:11:42,130
How are we gonna get back to Clumsy?

1279
01:11:44,326 --> 01:11:46,607
We ride. Come on!

1280
01:11:47,606 --> 01:11:50,126
- Be still, bird.
- I don't think they're friendly.

1281
01:11:50,246 --> 01:11:52,210
- Well, neither am I.
- But they carry disease.

1282
01:11:52,966 --> 01:11:55,290
And Smurfs. Let's ride.

1283
01:11:55,406 --> 01:11:57,011
- Whoa, bird, whoa!
- Come on!

1284
01:11:57,127 --> 01:11:59,047
But I'm not sure I can do this.

1285
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:02,487
You can do it, Brainy. Hold on!

1286
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:06,251
According to my calculations,
this is dangerous!

1287
01:12:08,526 --> 01:12:10,087
It's getting dark.

1288
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:12,971
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we'd better go look for them.

1289
01:12:13,046 --> 01:12:14,290
Yeah.

1290
01:12:17,687 --> 01:12:19,095
Hi.

1291
01:12:23,127 --> 01:12:26,936
- Where are the others?
- We think they're still at the bookstore.

1292
01:12:27,568 --> 01:12:30,132
Listen, Grace, I'm...

1293
01:12:35,248 --> 01:12:36,372
Hey, Odile.

1294
01:12:36,528 --> 01:12:38,776
Patrick...

1295
01:12:40,688 --> 01:12:42,892
Listen, listen. Before you fire me,

1296
01:12:42,968 --> 01:12:46,296
I know that the ads that ran
weren't the ads I sent.

1297
01:12:47,569 --> 01:12:50,657
But they're the ads I should have sent.

1298
01:12:51,448 --> 01:12:53,532
The ads I almost did send.

1299
01:12:53,928 --> 01:12:56,209
But I didn't 'cause...

1300
01:12:57,689 --> 01:12:59,053
I second-guessed myself.

1301
01:12:59,769 --> 01:13:04,974
I gave you what I thought you wanted,
instead of what I thought was right.

1302
01:13:07,129 --> 01:13:09,453
But this is right.

1303
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:12,450
It means something to me and...
I don't know,

1304
01:13:12,529 --> 01:13:14,658
I think it's gonna mean
something to others, too.

1305
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:21,378
It's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.

1306
01:13:22,169 --> 01:13:24,253
"Once in a blue moon."

1307
01:13:25,209 --> 01:13:29,651
That means that there are
only a few moments in your life

1308
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:36,379
when something truly memorable,
truly magical, happens to you.

1309
01:13:37,651 --> 01:13:43,139
And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid,

1310
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,091
you might just miss it.

1311
01:13:47,451 --> 01:13:49,654
That's what that image means.

1312
01:13:50,771 --> 01:13:54,612
Don't let those blue moon moments
pass you by.

1313
01:13:57,691 --> 01:14:00,856
I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.

1314
01:14:06,452 --> 01:14:08,536
I so smurf in' love you.

1315
01:14:11,372 --> 01:14:13,892
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!

1316
01:14:13,972 --> 01:14:16,372
- Brace for impact!
- The window's open, ya ninny.

1317
01:14:17,932 --> 01:14:19,536
We're outta control!

1318
01:14:19,892 --> 01:14:22,140
Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...

1319
01:14:23,052 --> 01:14:24,820
- That'll do, pigeon.
- Thank you, bird.

1320
01:14:24,892 --> 01:14:26,660
Look! We got the incantation.

1321
01:14:26,772 --> 01:14:28,736
- Where's Papa?
- Gargamel's got him.

1322
01:14:28,852 --> 01:14:30,816
- What?
- Oh, no.

1323
01:14:30,973 --> 01:14:34,333
He took him to some place
called BellVeedaRay Castle.

1324
01:14:34,452 --> 01:14:37,180
- He's gonna...
- Don't say it.

1325
01:14:37,533 --> 01:14:39,420
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?

1326
01:14:39,532 --> 01:14:42,381
Belve... He's taken him
to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.

1327
01:14:42,453 --> 01:14:44,253
To extract his essence.

1328
01:14:44,373 --> 01:14:46,217
- What? Well, we have to go get him.
- Yeah.

1329
01:14:46,293 --> 01:14:48,421
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.

1330
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:51,414
Papa said no matter what happens
we're not to go back for him.

1331
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:52,894
He's trying to protect us.

1332
01:14:53,013 --> 01:14:56,374
- No! We can't leave Papa behind.
- It was a Smurf promise.

1333
01:14:56,494 --> 01:14:57,782
No, no, no. We can't.

1334
01:14:57,854 --> 01:15:00,702
We promised Papa
we'd do exactly what he said.

1335
01:15:00,813 --> 01:15:02,581
- That's right.
- I didn't.

1336
01:15:04,373 --> 01:15:06,141
I never promised him anything.

1337
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:10,135
Neither did I. And there is no way
I'm leaving here without Papa.

1338
01:15:12,094 --> 01:15:14,582
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.

1339
01:15:17,934 --> 01:15:19,254
I'm in.

1340
01:15:22,774 --> 01:15:24,542
Aye. Me, too.

1341
01:15:26,614 --> 01:15:30,575
No Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.

1342
01:15:31,415 --> 01:15:34,296
- All for one and one for Smurf!
- All for one and one for Smurf!

1343
01:15:39,455 --> 01:15:42,259
I 'll squeeze a few
And tweeze a few

1344
01:15:42,335 --> 01:15:44,703
And steal their essence blue

1345
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:51,420
Very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!

1346
01:15:55,095 --> 01:15:56,820
Oh, look at this.

1347
01:15:57,336 --> 01:16:04,101
Just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard
yields me all of this essence.

1348
01:16:04,896 --> 01:16:10,505
Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest
from your entire family of Smurfs.

1349
01:16:10,977 --> 01:16:12,657
Alakazookas!

1350
01:16:15,536 --> 01:16:19,584
Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!

1351
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:26,945
No. No! The cages! No! No!

1352
01:16:27,937 --> 01:16:31,418
I'll steam the essence from their sweat.
I'll tug it from their tears!

1353
01:16:31,617 --> 01:16:33,625
I'll snip it from their hair.

1354
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:36,818
You're a fool, Gargamel.

1355
01:16:36,898 --> 01:16:39,779
My Smurfs are well on their way home
by now.

1356
01:17:04,059 --> 01:17:06,579
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.

1357
01:17:12,539 --> 01:17:14,187
Good luck, Gutsy!

1358
01:17:14,899 --> 01:17:18,304
- Into the breach!
- I'll see you there!

1359
01:17:28,379 --> 01:17:32,068
- We all remember the plan, right?
- Let's get our smurf on.

1360
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,707
Brainy, what's happening?

1361
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:37,668
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful than anticipated.

1362
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,144
I don't think I can do it.

1363
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:42,784
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.

1364
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:00,382
I'll be smurf ed!

1365
01:18:01,621 --> 01:18:05,309
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!

1366
01:18:08,661 --> 01:18:11,062
- I don't believe it!
- Wow.

1367
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:13,985
- It's the Anjelou moon.
- How did she do that?

1368
01:18:14,581 --> 01:18:16,665
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, Odile.

1369
01:18:17,141 --> 01:18:19,629
- Oh, wow.
- That's wonderful.

1370
01:18:27,582 --> 01:18:29,786
Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.

1371
01:18:29,862 --> 01:18:33,222
That which doesn't kill you
only makes me stronger.

1372
01:18:35,141 --> 01:18:36,669
- Yo!
- Huh?

1373
01:18:36,902 --> 01:18:39,270
Gargamel! Come out and play!

1374
01:18:39,422 --> 01:18:42,946
Oh, I think our tiny little guests
have finally arrived.

1375
01:18:43,262 --> 01:18:44,463
- No!
- Ah, well.

1376
01:18:44,542 --> 01:18:46,943
Enjoy the ride, Papa!

1377
01:18:48,543 --> 01:18:50,430
And remember, keep your hands and feet

1378
01:18:50,502 --> 01:18:53,426
- inside the cart at all times.
- No. No! No!

1379
01:18:53,503 --> 01:18:55,303
Smurfs, run!

1380
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,627
Smurfs.

1381
01:19:04,023 --> 01:19:07,625
You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurf ed!

1382
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,348
Yeah, what he said.

1383
01:19:09,463 --> 01:19:10,904
Adorable.

1384
01:19:10,983 --> 01:19:14,465
Two little smurfs come to save
their beloved Papa.

1385
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:16,224
Hey, Gargamel.

1386
01:19:16,863 --> 01:19:19,548
Make that three little smurfs.

1387
01:19:23,464 --> 01:19:26,268
And I went home and got a few friends.

1388
01:19:46,464 --> 01:19:47,948
MY, my, my!

1389
01:19:48,745 --> 01:19:50,305
I think the whole village must be here.

1390
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:56,186
Whatever will I do with all this essence?

1391
01:19:56,705 --> 01:19:58,026
On me, boys.

1392
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:00,549
Fire!

1393
01:20:00,665 --> 01:20:02,913
Let's get this hoedown started!

1394
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:06,389
There comes a time
when every Smurf must stand up...

1395
01:20:06,466 --> 01:20:07,546
Watch it, you little hoodlums!

1396
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:10,866
For what is good and cute and blue
in the world.

1397
01:20:10,946 --> 01:20:14,547
And on this brisk New York night,
that time is now.

1398
01:20:14,626 --> 01:20:16,230
Hey! Seriously?

1399
01:20:16,346 --> 01:20:18,627
Sorry, it's kind of what I do.

1400
01:20:21,506 --> 01:20:22,947
Eat yolk, Gargamel!

1401
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:27,270
Patrick, can you do it?

1402
01:20:27,386 --> 01:20:28,390
Go, go, go!

1403
01:20:28,746 --> 01:20:29,990
Hurry, they can't hold out for long.

1404
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:36,592
You know, one bad apple
can ruin your whole day.

1405
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,747
Full smurf ahead!

1406
01:20:41,027 --> 01:20:42,348
Come on!

1407
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:47,311
Hey, Gargamel,
here's a little souvenir from the Big Apple.

1408
01:20:50,787 --> 01:20:53,068
- Out of the frying pan...
- And into the...

1409
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:54,267
- Fire.
- Fire.

1410
01:20:54,347 --> 01:20:56,115
I'm too beautiful to die!

1411
01:21:05,988 --> 01:21:06,948
Oh, Papa.

1412
01:21:07,188 --> 01:21:08,956
No. No, Smurfette.

1413
01:21:09,028 --> 01:21:10,872
What did he do to you?

1414
01:21:10,948 --> 01:21:12,028
You shouldn't have come back for me.

1415
01:21:12,108 --> 01:21:14,028
Papa, I'm getting you out of here right now.

1416
01:21:18,388 --> 01:21:19,392
Smurfette!

1417
01:21:19,468 --> 01:21:21,356
Hang on, Papa, I'll be back.

1418
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:25,993
Charge!

1419
01:21:26,068 --> 01:21:27,073
Get him!

1420
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:28,196
Grab the wand!

1421
01:21:28,269 --> 01:21:29,436
- Goin' in!
- Go!

1422
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:33,633
Bombs away!

1423
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,076
- I'm going for a strike!
- Alakazam!

1424
01:21:37,549 --> 01:21:39,153
- Crikey.
- Look out, Gutsy!

1425
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:41,749
Oh, ya blinkin' flip!

1426
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:46,074
Hang on, Papa.

1427
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:50,554
Onions!

1428
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:54,033
Get back, cat.

1429
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:01,591
Here, kitty, kitty...

1430
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:05,514
Smurfette!

1431
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:09,351
Looking for me?

1432
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:11,314
Play time is over!

1433
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:15,315
Behold the awesome power of me!

1434
01:22:43,832 --> 01:22:44,879
Smurfette?

1435
01:22:45,031 --> 01:22:46,515
Had enough, huh?

1436
01:22:46,832 --> 01:22:47,911
You're mine, kitty.

1437
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:53,512
I'm done smurfing around.

1438
01:23:02,793 --> 01:23:04,921
You smurf ed with the wrong girl.

1439
01:23:08,953 --> 01:23:10,393
- I got you, Greedy.
- Oh, my cupcake!

1440
01:23:14,193 --> 01:23:15,601
What's happening, Papa?

1441
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:16,873
No!

1442
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,558
Gargamel!

1443
01:23:21,553 --> 01:23:24,238
Not so fast, goody blue-shoes.

1444
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:26,154
Oh, Papa!

1445
01:23:27,593 --> 01:23:30,998
Now, it's time to break their little blue wills.

1446
01:23:31,433 --> 01:23:34,161
- No.
- Are you watching closely, Smurfs?

1447
01:23:34,474 --> 01:23:37,081
- Papa!
- Your beloved little Papa

1448
01:23:37,194 --> 01:23:40,402
is about to meet his little blue end.

1449
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:41,478
No!

1450
01:23:41,554 --> 01:23:42,962
Upsy-daisy!

1451
01:23:43,114 --> 01:23:44,719
Oh, no. Papa!

1452
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:45,842
Papa!

1453
01:23:49,674 --> 01:23:52,643
No! No!

1454
01:23:52,714 --> 01:23:53,762
You again!

1455
01:23:53,835 --> 01:23:54,959
Goodbye!

1456
01:23:55,995 --> 01:23:57,042
I'm really...

1457
01:23:57,515 --> 01:24:00,396
This ends here, this ends now!

1458
01:24:00,474 --> 01:24:02,199
Really going to enjoy this.

1459
01:24:02,475 --> 01:24:03,599
Gotcha!

1460
01:24:04,075 --> 01:24:05,603
Freedom!

1461
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:07,158
Son of a smurf!

1462
01:24:07,355 --> 01:24:08,643
Come back here!

1463
01:24:08,715 --> 01:24:10,799
Go, Gutsy! Yeah!

1464
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,395
Come back here right now with my wand!

1465
01:24:15,755 --> 01:24:17,720
Oh, no. Crikey.

1466
01:24:21,396 --> 01:24:23,437
I... I got it.

1467
01:24:23,756 --> 01:24:25,764
- Oh, dear.
- Clumsy.

1468
01:24:25,835 --> 01:24:29,120
- So this is how it ends.
- Our goose is cooked.

1469
01:24:31,676 --> 01:24:34,044
- This is not gonna be good.
- We're doomed.

1470
01:24:34,676 --> 01:24:36,400
I got it! I got it!

1471
01:24:37,676 --> 01:24:40,284
The vision's never been wrong.

1472
01:24:52,557 --> 01:24:53,845
I got it!

1473
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:58,321
My wand! Give me back my wand!

1474
01:25:12,757 --> 01:25:14,001
How dare you!

1475
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:19,766
How dare you defy the great and powerful...

1476
01:25:24,558 --> 01:25:25,605
Oh, my God.

1477
01:25:25,678 --> 01:25:27,282
Smurfs!

1478
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:33,286
Are you dead?

1479
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,840
- Nice one, Clumsy!
- Are you kidding me?

1480
01:25:39,918 --> 01:25:41,446
- Get up here, you!
- Yeah!

1481
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,603
Bravo! Danke schön, Clumsy!

1482
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:46,806
- Patrick.
- Hey.

1483
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:50,486
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!

1484
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,360
Clumsy, you're a hero.

1485
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:56,606
I'm a hero?

1486
01:25:56,759 --> 01:25:57,883
Yeah. Yeah.

1487
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:02,968
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.

1488
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:06,967
- Clumsy, you little mook, you.
- It's Papa.

1489
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,324
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.

1490
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,845
I believed more in a vision than I did in you.

1491
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,888
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.

1492
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,640
Thanks, Papa.

1493
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,841
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

1494
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,328
And now to get rid of this!

1495
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,929
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.

1496
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,604
- Smurf y'all later!
- Bye.

1497
01:26:37,841 --> 01:26:39,401
I'm not one for long goodbyes,

1498
01:26:39,481 --> 01:26:42,842
but I did smurf together a few words
I'd like to say.

1499
01:26:42,961 --> 01:26:44,009
- Bye.
- Take care.

1500
01:26:44,081 --> 01:26:47,169
I hated this. So much less than I expected.

1501
01:26:47,482 --> 01:26:51,006
- Bye, Grouchy.
- Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.

1502
01:26:51,121 --> 01:26:56,086
I'll not soon forget this place.
Especially not with these! Tallyho!

1503
01:26:56,642 --> 01:26:59,326
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!

1504
01:26:59,441 --> 01:27:01,209
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Wow.

1505
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:04,003
I've never had a girlfriend before.

1506
01:27:06,082 --> 01:27:09,290
- I'll never forget you.
- Smurfette.

1507
01:27:10,482 --> 01:27:11,442
High four.

1508
01:27:13,403 --> 01:27:15,127
High four, Grace.

1509
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:18,203
- Hey, Smurfette.
- And you.

1510
01:27:18,323 --> 01:27:20,287
- Hi.
- You, the little hero, come here.

1511
01:27:20,882 --> 01:27:22,803
Hero? Stop.

1512
01:27:23,442 --> 01:27:25,723
Well, actually, you mind saying
it one more time?

1513
01:27:25,843 --> 01:27:27,327
It's kinda got a nice ring to it.

1514
01:27:32,763 --> 01:27:35,764
- Bye, Grace.
- Well, Master Winslow, thank you.

1515
01:27:36,403 --> 01:27:38,323
- You saved me.
- So long!

1516
01:27:38,843 --> 01:27:40,404
You saved my whole family.

1517
01:27:40,603 --> 01:27:43,604
Actually I think it was the other way around.

1518
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:47,925
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.

1519
01:27:48,244 --> 01:27:50,372
Your village has given me some ideas.

1520
01:27:51,604 --> 01:27:52,892
Come here.

1521
01:28:01,564 --> 01:28:03,047
Goodbye, Papa.

1522
01:28:03,764 --> 01:28:06,012
Goodbye, Papa.

1523
01:28:12,645 --> 01:28:14,173
Let's go home.

1524
01:28:17,204 --> 01:28:21,133
And so, the Smurfs left
the strange city of New York,

1525
01:28:21,685 --> 01:28:25,810
and I think they left it a little sweeter,
a little wiser,

1526
01:28:25,885 --> 01:28:28,013
a little smurfier.

1527
01:28:28,085 --> 01:28:30,650
And as that portal began to close
for the last time...

1528
01:28:30,725 --> 01:28:32,810
Hey! Seriously, stop!

1529
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:35,610
Bye, New York!

1530
01:28:45,045 --> 01:28:47,130
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.

1531
01:28:47,206 --> 01:28:49,530
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.

1532
01:28:50,686 --> 01:28:52,890
Finally someone has given me what I want.

1533
01:29:00,406 --> 01:29:01,530
I think I'm not fired.

1534
01:29:02,886 --> 01:29:03,934
Wow!

1535
01:29:07,767 --> 01:29:11,215
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby,

1536
01:29:12,727 --> 01:29:14,736
some unique new friends...

1537
01:29:19,327 --> 01:29:21,411
- You know if you really want a bigger place.
- Bigger?

1538
01:29:21,768 --> 01:29:24,649
Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.

1539
01:29:30,008 --> 01:29:31,012
Grace,

1540
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:35,456
I smurf you.

1541
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:31,821
Smurfs. Smurfs!

1542
01:31:36,253 --> 01:31:39,177
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.

1543
01:31:42,733 --> 01:31:44,413
What are you looking at?
