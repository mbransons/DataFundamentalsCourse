1
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,642
<i>Willard.</i>

2
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,194
<i>There are rats in the basement.</i>

3
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,178
Ow!

4
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,734
<i>Willard...</i>

5
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,400
<i>what are you doing?</i>

6
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,452
I'm going to bed.

7
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,284
<i>It's late.</i>

8
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,160
Yes. I'm going to bed.

9
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,832
Good night, mom.

10
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,043
<i>What were you doing down there?</i>

11
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,670
You, uh, said there were rats.

12
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,634
<i>Well, did you see them?</i>

13
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,810
Well... there aren't any rats.

14
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,687
<i>There are.</i>

15
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,066
<i>All our neighbors moving away...</i>

16
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:10,321
<i>and all these new people
remodelling the houses.</i>

17
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,528
<i>They're stirring up rats.</i>

18
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:18,412
Well... have you been
to the basement?

19
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,039
<i>No. You know I can't.</i>

20
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,246
<i>I know they're there.</i>

21
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,003
<i>I can smell them.</i>

22
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,757
<i>All my life I could smell mice.</i>

23
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,003
Smell... mice?

24
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,175
<i>And hear them.</i>

25
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,516
<i>Don't you hear them down there?</i>

26
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,682
It's... it's just the wind.

27
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,685
There aren't any rats.

28
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,148
<i>Come in here. Hmm?</i>

29
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,821
<i>Come in here.</i>

30
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,583
I'm sorry I've been
such a bad mother to you.

31
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,336
Well, you've... you've been a...

32
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,636
Well, you are...
a wonderful mother.

33
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,844
It's my fault
your life was wasted.

34
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,362
Willard.

35
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,119
What an awful name... Willard.

36
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,829
Maybe if you had
a stronger name...

37
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,991
that Frank Martin
wouldn't push you around...

38
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,287
<i>or maybe
you'd have found a girlfriend...</i>

39
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,832
<i>if you had
a more handsome name...</i>

40
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,252
Mark or Kyle or...

41
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,181
<i>Clark.</i>

42
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:06,308
Willard, from now on,
your name's Clark.

43
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,143
Good night, Clark.

44
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,378
Pardon me.

45
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,890
That you?

46
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,309
Sorry.
They told me to sit here.

47
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,804
Willard, he wants to see you.

48
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,984
Oh. Well, um...

49
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:22,573
Ms. Leach,
it seems that someone...

50
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,867
this girl,
is sitting at my desk.

51
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,909
Maybe that's why
he wants to see you.

52
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,750
OK.

53
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,130
Hey. Pay attention.

54
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,329
<i>Yeah?</i>

55
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,041
Who's that at your desk
out there, Willard?

56
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,008
I... I don't know her.

57
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,762
Sit.

58
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,393
Who did you say that was at
your desk out there, Willard?

59
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,229
I... I... I don't know her.

60
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,740
Well, you should know, because
it's your fault she's there.

61
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,072
You've fallen
at least a week behind...

62
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,407
processing the purchase orders.

63
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,101
You know,
when that happens, Willard...

64
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,369
everything comes
to a standstill...

65
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,835
my salespeople
up on the floor...

66
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,712
shipping, receiving, inventory.

67
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,748
Everybody's standing around...

68
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,153
with their thumbs
up their asses...

69
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,464
because you have allowed
the purchase orders...

70
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,503
to bottleneck at your desk.

71
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,344
Your father built this company,
Willard.

72
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,404
Hell, your family name
is still out there...

73
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,052
on the side of the building...

74
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,596
"Martin Stiles Manufacturing."

75
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,648
Ah, hell,
it just seems to me like...

76
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,314
<i>that alone
would make you take...</i>

77
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,855
a little more pride
in your work.

78
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,195
Well, I...

79
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:34,827
Oh, my mother is sick.

80
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,249
I see.

81
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:40,790
So, it's your mother's fault
that you've fallen behind?

82
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,253
Willard, I'm an old friend
of the family.

83
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,634
Hell, I've known your mother
since before you were born.

84
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,343
She's a fine lady, and she
deserves to be kept comfortable.

85
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,766
Your dad
was like a father to me.

86
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,886
And I promised him
that I would always...

87
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,021
<i>Look after
you and your mother...</i>

88
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,102
and as long as she was alive,
you'd have a job right here.

89
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,646
<i>And in keeping
with that promise...</i>

90
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,778
I must insist that you find...

91
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,944
a good rest-care facility
for mom.

92
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,372
We can't afford that.

93
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,122
But, hell, I guess
you could always sell the house.

94
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,130
Here's an idea... I'd tear it
down and build apartments on it.

95
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,213
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin.
I'll... I'll... I'll...

96
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,555
I'll catch up. I'll stay late.

97
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,593
Oh, yeah. You would love that,
wouldn't you, Willard?

98
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,514
Suck up on more overtime than
it even costs me for a temp.

99
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,557
<i>You'll catch up, all right,
asshole...</i>

100
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,568
and you'll catch up
on your own damn time!

101
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,980
There's one thing that you will
never understand, Willard...

102
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,774
business is a rat race.

103
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,490
Promise or no promise,
I will not allow myself...

104
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,623
to be devoured by all of those
other rats because of you!

105
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,865
<i>Clark!
What is it? What is it?</i>

106
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,870
Shh, shh, shh.

107
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,040
It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.

108
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,217
Here we go.

109
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,717
<i>What was all that noise?</i>

110
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,936
<i>Rats?</i>

111
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:44,894
No.

112
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:50,855
A bird got stuck in the house
somehow, and I let it out.

113
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,315
It's all right now,
so go back to bed.

114
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,696
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

115
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,533
I'm going potty.

116
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,990
You've been in there
a long time.

117
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,197
<i>I'm not feeling well, mom.</i>

118
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,576
<i>Is it loose or hard?</i>

119
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,087
I'm OK. I'm OK.

120
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,967
So just... just go to bed.

121
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,794
<i>Let me see.
I'm still your mother.</i>

122
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,685
<i>Clark! Clark!</i>

123
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,772
You should be in bed.

124
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,900
You're feverish.

125
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,813
I get afraid, Clark.

126
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,651
Your father was in
that bathroom late that night.

127
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,663
Yes, I know. I'm never going
to do anything like that.

128
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,540
What is that on your hand?

129
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,201
It's... it's soap.

130
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,960
It's cooking oil.

131
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,794
Oh, Willard,
you're too old for that.

132
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,215
<i>When will you
find yourself a girl?</i>

133
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,100
Well, other than
getting caught in the trap...

134
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,106
you seem pretty... pretty smart.

135
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,858
<i>You should be called...
Socrates.</i>

136
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,114
What do you think?

137
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:29,246
Yeah? All right. Socrates.

138
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,303
Whoa. Like it in here? Oh.

139
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,221
Where are you going?

140
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,436
<i>Bye, Socrates.</i>

141
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,852
Say hello to your family.

142
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,653
You're reunited with
your brother and sister and mom.

143
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,370
Look. Look, everybody.

144
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:15,037
Food. Food for everybody.

145
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,633
There you go. Very good.

146
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Bye.

147
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,674
Socrates...

148
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,092
I will never let anyone
harm you ever.

149
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,348
I promise.

150
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,219
I promise.

151
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,721
I promise.

152
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,650
Martin, I have to cover
your damn car every day.

153
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:30,036
"Cover my car. Cover my car."
Ugh!

154
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,463
Do you like my new S-55,
Willard?

155
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,632
My new car. My new Mercedes.
I saw you drooling over it.

156
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,009
Oh.

157
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,346
Uh, yes, Mr. Martin. It's...

158
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,806
Do you know
why I have that car?

159
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:02,944
I'm driving that 350-horsepower,
V-8 masterpiece...

160
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,697
for you
and your fellow employees.

161
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,159
You see, buyers
feel a sense of security...

162
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,536
<i>when they can see proof...</i>

163
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,072
<i>that they're dealing
with a successful man.</i>

164
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,377
So, when I whip into that
parking lot behind the wheel...

165
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:21,835
of my brand-new
Mercedes AMG-class...

166
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:26,714
they'll buy from us over
the slob in the Jaguar S-type.

167
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:33,058
Do you know why I can afford
to plunk down 90,000 bucks...

168
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,012
for that little edge
over the competition, Willard?

169
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,649
Because I'm a successful man!

170
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,569
Because I have never been late
for work a day in my life!

171
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,985
<i>Because when I come to work,
I don't show up...</i>

172
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,651
in one of my dead father's
cheap suits!

173
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,748
<i>Because I have never
given my boss such grief.</i>

174
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,794
Maybe it wouldn't hurt you
to find out what pleases me!

175
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,551
Are you OK?

176
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,166
Hi, Socrates.

177
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,714
<i>It's been a bad day.</i>

178
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,187
Tear it, Socrates.

179
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,033
All right...

180
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,407
you teach them.

181
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,914
They listen to you, Socrates.

182
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,177
Tear it.

183
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,720
Tear it.

184
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,314
Tear it up.

185
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,487
Jeez. You're big.

186
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,620
Big Ben.

187
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,873
Do you know him, Socrates?

188
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:05,391
Ben, this looks like
the beginning...

189
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,226
of a beautiful friendship.

190
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,153
Tear it.

191
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:15,901
<i>Tear it.</i>

192
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,071
Tear it.

193
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:33,791
OK, everybody,
that was really good.

194
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,380
<i>Speed. Speed.</i>

195
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,302
Very good.

196
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,008
<i>Rope... up.</i>

197
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,807
<i>Tear it.</i>

198
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,643
You go down there. Go on now.

199
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,647
Down. Down. Tear it.

200
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:55,822
<i>In.</i>

201
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,370
Still.

202
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:19,804
Out.

203
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,272
One week! You've been late
for so many hours...

204
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,107
that it equals an entire week!

205
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,406
Mr. Martin, I... I'm sorry.

206
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,654
I want my week back.

207
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,277
I've discussed it with counsel.

208
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,599
I may not be able
to fire you, Willard...

209
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,536
but, by God, it is well within
my rights to administer...

210
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,622
physical disciplinary reprimand!

211
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,713
I know that you must be tired
of this excuse...

212
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,215
but what can I do?
My mother is sick.

213
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,592
You don't give a shit
about your mother!

214
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,878
If you did, you'd show up
for work on time...

215
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,842
because now look
what's happened.

216
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,303
You're out a week's pay.

217
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,810
Oh, you don't like that.
Then quit.

218
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,184
Act like a man for once
in your life and just quit!

219
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,269
You're
a slimy, pukey piece of shit!

220
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,656
You wouldn't make a pimple
on my grandmother's tush!

221
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:26,996
Willard.

222
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,061
In.

223
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,368
In.

224
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
No!

225
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,489
Ben, no.

226
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,660
If you get in,
nobody else will be able to fit.

227
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:19,507
In.

228
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,526
Be careful, stupid.
We're not making a bed here.

229
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,752
<i>All available units,
please respond immediately.</i>

230
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,134
<i>211 in progress...
316 Glenview Parkway.</i>

231
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:23,006
Out.

232
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,761
Door.

233
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,764
Tear it.

234
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,812
Tires. Tear it.

235
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,540
Ben, I told you to stay.

236
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,886
You... you won't fit.

237
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,436
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

238
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,896
<i>You left the washer
in the garage...</i>

239
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,030
<i>running again, didn't you?</i>

240
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,951
In! In!

241
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,870
Come on. Come on.

242
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,665
<i>Anybody out there?</i>

243
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,214
<i>Is someone out there
in the garage?</i>

244
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,925
<i>Oh, shit! Look at that!</i>

245
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,795
<i>Somebody got in here
and slashed my tires!</i>

246
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,181
<i>Damn!</i>

247
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,935
<i>Who's out here?</i>

248
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,561
<i>Yeah, you better run!</i>

249
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,397
<i>You don't mess with a man's
brand-new car like that!</i>

250
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,067
Run,
and you'll only die tired!

251
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:01,497
<i>You better run faster...</i>

252
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,578
<i>because if I catch you,
you are dead meat!</i>

253
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,144
Quiet!

254
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,485
Go home!

255
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,139
Do you want to see
what's in the bags...

256
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,279
you stupid little dog?

257
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,498
<i>The look on his face.</i>

258
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,797
<i>Imagine, all four of his tires.</i>

259
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,610
<i>Do you know
what a set of those tires run?</i>

260
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,846
<i>Insurance will cover it.</i>

261
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,470
<i>But insurance won't cover
how pissed off he's gonna be.</i>

262
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,059
Hey, what's up?

263
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,892
<i>Someone broke into
Martin's garage last night...</i>

264
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,267
slashed his tires
and peed on the floor!

265
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,359
Morning, Cat.
You look very nice today.

266
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,534
Wow. Someone... someone
urinated on the floor?

267
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,535
<i>No, no, no.
You know, what happened...</i>

268
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,766
<i>when Martin
goes in his garage...</i>

269
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,123
and sees his tires,
he pissed his pants...

270
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,874
and blamed it
on the guy that did it.

271
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,081
Do you think that's funny, Fox?

272
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,925
<i>Ahem.
Good morning, Mr. Martin.</i>

273
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,094
Is everything OK?

274
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,466
No, everything is not OK.

275
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,805
<i>How would you like it
if some maniac...</i>

276
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,970
<i>invaded the privacy
of your home...</i>

277
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,182
and scared the dog shit
out of your wife...

278
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,109
and then you had to lose
an entire night's sleep...

279
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,019
because you're
dealing with the cops?

280
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,190
Knowing that that
perverted sicko has control...

281
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,735
over you and your family's
peace of mind?

282
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,744
<i>For Jesus and Christ,
for how long?</i>

283
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,407
How long will it last?
No, I'm not all right!

284
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:57,297
This morning, I rode the subway.

285
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,046
Well, Mr. Fox,
how would you like that?

286
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,211
No, sir,
I wouldn't like that at all.

287
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,220
I didn't think you would.

288
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:11,220
Barbara, I need a foot massage.

289
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,170
Oh, that's so good.
That's so good.

290
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,764
Foods.

291
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,186
Foods.

292
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,946
We, um...

293
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,329
we're running out of room.

294
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,366
<i>I'm very sorry about this...</i>

295
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,958
<i>but I can't... I can't
feed you anymore.</i>

296
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,039
<i>I can't afford it.</i>

297
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,798
<i>You're going to have to find
a new place to live.</i>

298
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,176
Go find somewhere
more comfortable.

299
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,840
I wish that
they didn't have to...

300
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,268
but all good things
must come to an end.

301
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:47,152
Follow Ben. He will find
a new place for you.

302
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,825
<i>He will take care of you.</i>

303
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,829
Won't you, Ben?

304
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,157
<i>You're the leader...</i>

305
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,329
after Socrates.

306
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,590
Good night, Ben.

307
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,654
You're not going anywhere,
Socrates.

308
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,203
You'll always be with me.

309
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,118
I hate everyone but you.

310
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,289
Let's go to bed.

311
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,928
Ben, I told you.
You can't come upstairs.

312
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,185
Now, it's only Socrates,
not you.

313
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,150
Oh, Socrates.

314
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,955
Aah! Don't touch me!

315
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,212
You're getting rid of me.

316
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,626
Mom, I... I love you.

317
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,544
I heard you!

318
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,474
"All good things
must come to an end."

319
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,927
No, I... I love you
more than anything in the world.

320
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,723
You don't love me!
You won't feed me!

321
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,855
I hate you!

322
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,326
You need to go to the hospital.

323
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,794
What if mom sees you?

324
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,686
No.

325
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,189
<i>Mom?</i>

326
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,028
<i>Mom?</i>

327
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:33,859
Off. Off. Off.

328
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,896
Off. Off. Off.

329
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,073
Off.

330
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,777
Down! Down! In the basement!

331
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,039
Down! Down! Down!

332
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,951
In the basement! Down!

333
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,294
You think you're funny?
You think you're smart?

334
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,222
<i>Socrates, he's smart.</i>

335
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,925
He knows that
they're going to have to come...

336
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,538
and they're going
to have to take her away...

337
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,225
and then they'll come,
and they'll take me away...

338
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,481
and then they'll come,
and they'll take you away!

339
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,517
Hi.

340
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,351
She's my mother.

341
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:37,816
I love her.

342
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,524
And I'll miss her.

343
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,197
I already miss her.

344
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,291
But, Socrates...

345
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,620
if you ever died, I...

346
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,675
You're the only friend
that I've ever had.

347
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,609
Well...

348
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,070
at least
you're with father again.

349
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,037
I have a friend.

350
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,713
See?

351
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,547
He wants to say good-bye to you.

352
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,339
Say good-bye, Socrates.

353
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:50,513
That's good.

354
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,319
Willard.

355
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,821
In.

356
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,074
Willard, are you all right?

357
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,328
Yeah.

358
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,992
I didn't mean to upset you.

359
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,706
You didn't have to come here.

360
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,706
Well, we didn't hear from you...

361
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,967
and I wanted to make sure
that you were OK.

362
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:35,309
Uh, and I want
to let you know that...

363
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,679
you have a friend.

364
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:02,373
Willard Stiles,
I am Joseph Carter.

365
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,266
<i>I'm an attorney
with Montgomery and Glitt...</i>

366
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,377
<i>the trustees
of your mother's estate.</i>

367
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:10,169
I've been trying to reach you,
but you don't answer the phone.

368
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,387
May I have a moment
with Willard, please?

369
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,686
Do you mind if I check on you
after work...

370
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,229
and make sure that you're OK?

371
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,517
Oh, I... thanks.
That's OK. I'll be OK, Cat.

372
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:42,914
Willard, I have some news...

373
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,586
I don't know if you're aware of
or prepared for.

374
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,586
Your parents had been
living off an account...

375
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,593
they had originally set up
for your future.

376
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,388
It was intended to be yours
upon their passing.

377
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,885
However, your father's death
left debts...

378
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:04,557
that even Mr. Martin's buyout
did not completely relieve.

379
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,396
In fact, there remains
pending litigation...

380
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,402
on some unsettled debts.

381
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,114
Well...

382
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,241
it's... it's still my house.

383
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,494
<i>Your mother
refinanced the house...</i>

384
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,529
<i>after your father's death.</i>

385
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,626
<i>- In fact, we still owe...</i>
- "We"?

386
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,079
It's my house.

387
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,587
We can declare bankruptcy.
We can sell the house.

388
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,341
- It's my house!
- Yes, of course.

389
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,346
You grew up there.
It's your home.

390
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,517
- But it's the bank's house.
- It's my house!

391
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,143
There's no need
for a single man...

392
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,556
to be living in such
a large house, Willard. Sell it.

393
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:49,477
Why do I have to pay
for what things my parents did?

394
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,315
The money can help you
start over.

395
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,068
"Start over"? I'm almost done!

396
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,483
Willard, look.
You have no choice...

397
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,744
If I have no choice,
why did you even come here?

398
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,205
Why did you
even bother telling me?

399
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,248
Do you get off
on telling people...

400
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,286
that they have no control
over their lives?

401
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:12,000
That I have no money, no home,
and it's not even my fault?

402
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,006
Willard,
this is not the time nor place.

403
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:16,754
Now, you think about it.

404
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,719
Then, please,
you have to contact me.

405
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,764
This is the only chance
you have...

406
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,772
to take control
of your own life.

407
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:33,613
Thank you.

408
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,875
Socrates.

409
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
Ben!

410
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,945
<i>Willard, it's Cathryn.
Answer the door.</i>

411
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,073
<i>I saw you walk in.</i>

412
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,656
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

413
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,667
I'm just on my way out.

414
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,753
I have some stuff that
I have to do at the cemetery.

415
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:18,333
Oh, well, this might not be
the best time, Willard...

416
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,469
but please don't
take this the wrong way.

417
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,840
You looked so lonely
at your mother's service...

418
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,601
and I remember
how devastated I was...

419
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,307
you know, when my mother died.

420
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,019
And the only thing
that helped me through...

421
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,606
was... her mother.

422
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,485
<i>This is Scully.</i>

423
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:42,111
<i>She'll make a great friend,
and she'll keep you company.</i>

424
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,449
<i>Oh.</i>

425
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,237
I don't know what to say.
I...

426
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,575
I can't accept Scully.

427
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,704
See? She likes you.

428
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,715
<i>Well...</i>

429
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,833
Why don't you hold her?

430
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,131
Just take her. Just hold her.

431
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,671
Really, I can't. I'm sorry.

432
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,881
- Just take her.
- OK.

433
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,263
Well...

434
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,434
I'm really late, and...

435
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,524
Do you think it's OK
if I just put her inside?

436
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:20,395
- Sure. She's potty-trained.
- Oh, good. Good.

437
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,127
Socrates.

438
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,467
It's OK.

439
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,932
It's OK.

440
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,952
I wasn't...

441
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,989
really trying to hurt him.

442
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:55,753
<i>I know.</i>

443
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,501
You're trying
to keep the peace...

444
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:07,468
but he has to learn...
I am the boss.

445
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,726
It's back to work, Socrates.

446
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,481
Ben, out.

447
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,281
OK, Ben...

448
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:55,117
just because
Socrates says it's OK.

449
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,504
Here we go.

450
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,886
Here we go.

451
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,082
Am I reading this correctly?

452
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,879
"Mr. Stiles, it is our regret
to inform you...

453
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:50,759
"your position
has been terminated.

454
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,508
"Enclosed please find
two weeks' severance.

455
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,798
"Your service is appreciated.

456
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,634
"Frank Martin."

457
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:01,978
He's firing you.

458
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,227
But I thought
he couldn't fire you.

459
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:14,118
Willard.

460
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,365
Hey. Hey!

461
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,704
This whole thing is just
one big misunderstanding.

462
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,751
I'll make it up to you, though.

463
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,413
<i>I'm gonna take you
to the Jets-Dolphins game.</i>

464
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,877
<i>- How does that sound?</i>
- What?

465
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:38,849
<i>Feels like this office could
use a little holiday cheer.</i>

466
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,142
Cathryn, go dig out
the Christmas decorations.

467
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,553
They're in the back storeroom.

468
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,562
The key's in Willard's desk
somewhere.

469
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,811
Talk it over with Rosie
and let me know.

470
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,900
I'll be right here at
the office working late tonight.

471
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,487
Christmas bonus time, you know.

472
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,956
Mrs. Leach, found the keys...

473
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,619
but you can dig out
your own holiday cheer...

474
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:10,130
and then you can shove it
up your ass with a big ho-ho-ho.

475
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,635
- I quit.
- Bye-bye.

476
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,426
How could you?

477
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,764
What part of "You're fired"
don't you understand?

478
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:26,055
- My father!
- Is dead. Been dead.

479
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,520
And now your mama's dead, too.

480
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,769
He started this company!
It's my family's company!

481
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,939
No. My company.
Been my company...

482
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,784
and I don't want you
around it anymore.

483
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,753
Why in the hell
are you even still here?

484
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:56,260
You hate it here.
I hate you being here.

485
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,511
You're going nowhere here.

486
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,052
Mommy and daddy are dead.

487
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:03,684
Get over it
and get on with your life.

488
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,274
The terms
of your purchase contract...

489
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,277
they strictly state
that you are not allowed to...

490
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:14,446
Sue me.

491
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:19,025
Get you a goddamn lawyer
and sue me. You'll win.

492
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:23,616
Go down today and hire yourself
a $250-an-hour lawyer.

493
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:27,871
Sue me.
My $400-an-hour lawyer...

494
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,787
will tie it up in the courts
until I die.

495
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:35,254
So, what? 10, 15, 20 years
from now, you'll win.

496
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,882
You know I cannot afford that!
You know that!

497
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:45,760
Need money?
Make me an offer on the house.

498
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,857
Don't give me that face,
Willard.

499
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:55,027
I buy the house, you have money.

500
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,780
You can go buy yourself
a very nice clean used car...

501
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:02,197
<i>move someplace
where you'll be happy...</i>

502
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,657
<i>get a job, a girlfriend.</i>

503
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,750
<i>Jeez, you'll be so damn happy
you won't want to sue me.</i>

504
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:38,946
All right...
I'll sell you the house.

505
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:45,077
But, please, please,
please let me keep my job!

506
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:58,792
Please!
Please let me keep my job.

507
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:00,838
Please.

508
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:08,597
What in the hell
is going on now?

509
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:12,889
<i>A rat! A rat in here! Oh!</i>

510
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:15,974
<i>It's a rat! Oh, my God!</i>

511
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,984
<i>Rat! Look out!</i>

512
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,862
There's a white rat...

513
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,982
and it is the size
of a dog... I mean, huge dog.

514
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,033
Over there,
behind the Christmas lights.

515
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:30,957
See him?

516
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,372
Where? I don't see any mouse.

517
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,161
No. Up there, you idiot.

518
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:37,750
Up there!

519
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,508
I think
your wild-ass imagination...

520
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,214
is kind of
getting away with you.

521
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,095
<i>He's up higher.</i>

522
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,100
There he is.

523
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:03,782
<i>No!</i>

524
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:16,835
Walt, this is Mickey.
I'm coming to join you.

525
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,054
Yeah.

526
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,512
What's the matter, tiger?
Can't take a little blood?

527
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,095
Ha ha ha ha! Finders keepers.

528
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,104
Nice work, Mr. Martin.

529
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:37,936
<i>Yeah, good one, sir.</i>

530
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,360
He expects me to clean that up?

531
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:43,737
I'll do it.

532
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,365
Thanks.

533
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,388
What could I do?

534
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,234
What could I do?

535
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,980
<i>What could I do?
What could I do?</i>

536
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,736
What could I do?
What could I do?

537
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,321
What could I do?

538
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,461
What can I do?

539
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,310
What can we do?

540
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:36,810
In.

541
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,321
In.

542
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,120
<i>That's it.
We can't fit any more.</i>

543
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:04,082
The rest of you
are going to have to wait here.

544
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:09,048
Ben and I will be back later.

545
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,137
Right, Ben?

546
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,593
Oh, Jesus.

547
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:42,611
Ooh... I like that.

548
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:12,850
Ooh, look at you.

549
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,059
<i>Oh, my God.
Look at all the rats.</i>

550
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:49,640
<i>Yes.</i>

551
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:53,432
Look at the rats.

552
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,435
We've come to see you.

553
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,648
We?

554
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,947
They'll do anything I tell them.

555
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,487
Well, then tell them to get
the fuck out of my office!

556
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,072
Sit down.

557
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,912
Now, you listen to me, Willard.

558
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:10,206
Sit down!

559
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:13,355
What the hell's
wrong with you?

560
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:18,920
Mr. Martin, you stole
this business from my father.

561
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:24,050
It killed him,
and it killed my mother.

562
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,681
And now
you're trying to kill me.

563
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:27,767
No. That's...

564
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:30,886
You never let me alone
for a minute.

565
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,771
You made a fool of me
in front of everybody.

566
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:37,525
And now you're trying
to take my house.

567
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:46,201
You made me hate myself.

568
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,154
<i>I thought a lot about it...</i>

569
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,911
hating myself.

570
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:56,419
Well, right now...

571
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,919
at this moment...

572
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,590
I like myself.

573
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:15,515
You killed Socrates!

574
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,307
Who the hell is Socrates?

575
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:23,272
He was the only friend...

576
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:25,607
I ever had!

577
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:58,356
What's the matter, tiger?
Afraid of a little blood?

578
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:04,739
Tear him up.

579
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,573
Good-bye, Ben.

580
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:33,926
Food.

581
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,181
Food.

582
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,024
<i>- I think I hear footsteps.
- Yeah.</i>

583
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:52,231
<i>- Let's look around back.
- OK.</i>

584
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:44,665
<i>Willard? It's Cathryn.</i>

585
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,338
I've been calling you all day.

586
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,299
Did you hear?

587
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,461
Martin's dead.

588
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,096
They called from the office.

589
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:00,594
The details are weird.

590
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,051
All kinds of rumors...

591
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:08,014
that he was murdered
or attacked by animals.

592
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,651
I'm hungry.

593
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,313
Could we get something to eat?

594
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,487
Right now?

595
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,361
Let me get my coat.

596
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,127
Just a second.

597
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,136
Could I use the restroom?

598
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:30,439
Cathryn?

599
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:32,275
<i>In here.</i>

600
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:36,940
Sorry. I had to go so bad,
and you flew off somewhere.

601
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,243
We need to go.

602
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:02,379
Shit. I must have
run over something.

603
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:18,023
<i>- There he is.
- You sure that's him?</i>

604
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,687
Yeah.

605
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:25,703
Get in the car.

606
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,912
<i>I'll call triple-A.</i>

607
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:30,115
I've got a cell phone.

608
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:54,431
<i>Mr. Stiles, police.
Open the door, please, sir.</i>

609
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,440
Can you please tell me
what this is about?

610
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:35,771
Willard!

611
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:38,061
<i>Open the door, Willard!</i>

612
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:39,851
<i>I want to help you!</i>

613
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:42,905
<i>Willard!</i>

614
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,158
Willard!

615
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,744
<i>Open the door, Willard!
Let me in!</i>

616
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:52,200
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

617
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:57,418
I hear him going around back.

618
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:18,899
Stiles.

619
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:21,685
<i>Stiles!</i>

620
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:36,619
I'm sorry, Ben. I...

621
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:39,664
I'm sorry that I left you.

622
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:42,004
<i>I got scared...</i>

623
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:46,005
and so I... I came back here.

624
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:56,594
It's all over, Ben.

625
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:03,818
You can live anywhere.

626
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:08,231
You can go anywhere.

627
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,363
I have nowhere.

628
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:16,242
Who's he talking to?

629
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:23,625
There was nothing
that I could do about Socrates.

630
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:33,890
But... we got him back.

631
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:38,891
We got Mr. Martin back together.

632
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,522
This guy's nuts.
We should just call Bellevue.

633
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:48,403
It's all over, Ben.

634
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:54,160
So just... go!

635
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,787
Go away!

636
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,701
Whoa! It's not just Bellevue.

637
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,117
<i>We've got to call the health
department exterminators.</i>

638
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:02,330
<i>You see that?</i>

639
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,621
Oh, man.

640
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:06,001
Let's go.

641
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:17,433
Do you want some food?

642
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:21,311
I'll give you some food, Ben.

643
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:26,771
I'll give you
all the food that I have...

644
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:31,064
if you'll just go away.

645
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:33,858
Do you want food?

646
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,301
No.

647
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:53,336
No, no, Ben. It's food.

648
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,050
<i>It's just food.</i>

649
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:01,766
Whatever food
is in the bag is yours.

650
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:09,193
Ah! That's it for you, Ben!

651
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,437
I hate you!

652
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:17,027
I loved Socrates,
but I hate you!

653
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:19,432
I'm not setting foot in there.
There's, like, a thousand rats.

654
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:22,244
Ma'am,
you want to get eaten alive?

655
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:28,253
Martin.

656
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:48,103
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

657
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,769
<i>If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.</i>

658
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:09,586
Cathryn, help!

659
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:12,049
Help!

660
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:15,293
Cathryn!

661
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:29,811
Cathryn.

662
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:25,622
Ben.

663
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:31,957
I thought we were friends.

664
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:37,653
Food's here.

665
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:40,531
Food.

666
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,367
Look, Stiles, you've got to eat.

667
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:53,160
You might be out of your mind,
but your body's staying here.

668
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:54,545
Eat.

669
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:58,581
Come on.
We got some nice chicken...

670
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,795
some mashed potatoes...

671
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:03,218
got a sourdough roll.

672
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:09,508
Hey, look.
We got a piece of cheese.

673
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:11,597
That's what the mice eat,
isn't it?

674
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:16,269
OK, rat boy.

675
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:19,147
Look, I'm gonna leave it here.

676
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:21,103
<i>You can do
whatever you want with it.</i>

677
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:48,223
Hi.

678
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:51,935
Shh.

679
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:55,979
<i>I know you're hungry,
but we have to wait.</i>

680
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:59,604
Our time will come.

681
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,189
<i>Let's not let them know
that you've come back to me.</i>

682
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:07,525
We have to sit here...

683
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:11,741
and wait...

684
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:14,708
wait...

685
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:18,869
quietly.

686
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:26,544
Quiet as a mouse.
