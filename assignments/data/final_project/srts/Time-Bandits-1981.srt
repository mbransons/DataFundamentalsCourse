Come on.

1396
01:47:04,714 --> 01:47:09,009
You mean you let all those people die,
just to test your creation ?

1397
01:47:09,099 --> 01:47:13,103
Yes.
You really are a clever boy.

1398
01:47:13,183 --> 01:47:16,266
Why did they have to die ?

1399
01:47:16,356 --> 01:47:18,768
You might as well say,
"Why do we have to have evil ?"

1400
01:47:18,858 --> 01:47:21,611
Oh, we wouldn't dream of asking
a question like that, sir.

1401
01:47:21,651 --> 01:47:24,444
Yes. Why do we have
to have evil ?

1402
01:47:24,484 --> 01:47:26,446
Ah.

1403
01:47:28,988 --> 01:47:31,331
- I think it's something
to do with freewill.

1404
01:47:32,702 --> 01:47:34,834
Do be careful.

1405
01:47:34,914 --> 01:47:36,836
You weren't watching.

1406
01:47:36,876 --> 01:47:40,379
Don't lose any of that stuff.
That's concentrated evil.

1407
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:43,803
One drop of that could turn
you all into hermit crabs.

1408
01:47:43,883 --> 01:47:46,756
I'm sorry, sir.

1409
01:47:46,846 --> 01:47:49,759
I, I was just wondering
if there's, um,

1410
01:47:49,849 --> 01:47:53,813
any chance we might
have our old jobs back, sir.

1411
01:47:53,893 --> 01:47:59,108
- Oh, you certainly were
appallingly bad robbers.
- Yes, sir.

1412
01:47:59,188 --> 01:48:03,022
I really should do something
very extrovert and vengeful with you.

1413
01:48:03,112 --> 01:48:05,024
Honestly, I'm too tired.

1414
01:48:05,114 --> 01:48:08,948
But I think I'll just transfer you
to the undergrowth department--

yes, bracken, small shrubs--

backdated to the beginning of time.

1417
01:48:17,126 --> 01:48:19,168
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1418
01:48:19,248 --> 01:48:22,881
Well, I am the nice one.

1419
01:48:22,961 --> 01:48:25,554
Is it all ready ? Right !

1420
01:48:25,634 --> 01:48:29,178
Come on, then.
Back to creation.

1421
01:48:29,218 --> 01:48:32,261
- I mustn't waste any more time.
- Bye, Kevin.

1422
01:48:32,351 --> 01:48:36,855
They'll think I've lost control
again and put it all down to evolution.

1423
01:48:36,935 --> 01:48:38,897
- Come on.
- Sir ?

1424
01:48:38,977 --> 01:48:42,110
- Yes ?
- What about my friend, sir ?
Can he come with us ?

1425
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:45,774
No, of course not.
This isn't a school outing.

1426
01:48:45,864 --> 01:48:47,776
But, sir,
he deserves something.

1427
01:48:47,866 --> 01:48:51,409
- I mean, without him--
- Oh, don't go on about it.

1428
01:48:51,489 --> 01:48:54,623
- He's got to stay here
to carry on the fight.

- Yeah.

I think so.

You're a very lucky boy.

Honestly, Trevor.
If you'd been half a man,

you'd have gone in there
