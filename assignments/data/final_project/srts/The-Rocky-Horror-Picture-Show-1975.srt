00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:11,195
...to take you on a strange journey.

144
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:26,443
It seemed a fairly ordinary night...

145
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:31,156
...when Brad Majors and
his fiancÃ©e, Janet Weiss...

146
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:34,238
...two young, ordinary,
healthy kids...

147
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:37,994
...left Denton that
late November evening...

148
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:41,840
...to visit a Dr. Everett Scott...

149
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:45,316
...ex-tutor and now friend
to both of them.

150
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:52,236
It's true there were
dark storm clouds...

...heavy, black and pendulous...

152

...toward which they were driving.

153
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:01,643
It's true also that the spare tire
they carried...

154
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:03,841
...was badly in need of some air.

155
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:07,435
But they, being normal kids and...

156
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:09,118
...on a night out...

157
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:13,802
...they were not going to let a storm
spoil the events of their evening.

158
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:17,800
On a night out.

159
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,243
It was a night out...

160
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:23,441
...they were going to remember...

161
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:26,802
...for a very long time.

162
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:38,197
<i>I have never been a quitter.</i>

163
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,924

00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:48,003
<i>But as president...</i>

166
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:52,204
<i>... I must put the interests</i>
<i>of America first.</i>

167
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:57,114
<i>America needs a full-time president...</i>

168
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:59,799
<i>... and a full-time Congress...</i>

169
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:01,200
<i>... particularly at this time...</i>

170
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:06,238
Gosh, that's the third motorcyclist
that's passed us.

171
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:09,636
They sure do take their lives
in their hands.

172
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:13,355
Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap
to that type.

173
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:21,796
What's the matter, Brad, darling?

174
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:26,001
We took the wrong fork
a few miles back.

175
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,001
Oh.

176
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,355
Where did that motorcyclist come from?

177
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,480
I guess we'll just have to turn back.

178
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:39,640
What was that bang?

179
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:41,598
We must have a blowout.

180
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:45,955
Damn it! I knew I should've gotten
that spare tire fixed.

181
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:49,002
You stay here and I'll go for help.

182
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:51,315
We're in the middle of nowhere.

183
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,473
Didn't we pass a castle
a few miles back?

184
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,800
Maybe they have a telephone
I could use.

185
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:04,041
I'm going too.

186
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:09,001
- Both of us don't need to get wet.
- I'm coming with you.

187
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:14,395
Besides, the owner of that phone
might be a beautiful woman...

188
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:16,795
...and you might never
come back again.

189
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,644
<i>In the velvet darkness</i>

190
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:03,035
<i>Of the blackest night</i>

191
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:06,004
<i>Burning bright</i>

192
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:10,195
<i>There's a guiding star</i>

193
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:15,643
<i>No matter what</i>

194
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:17,796
<i>Or...</i>

195
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:21,603
<i>... who you are</i>

196
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:26,997
<i>There's a light</i>

197
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:32,124
<i>Over at the Frankenstein place</i>

198
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:35,163
<i>There's a light</i>

199
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:42,400
<i>Burning in the fireplace</i>

200
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:47,920
<i>There's a light, light</i>

201
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:51,720
<i>In the darkness</i>

202
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:56,595
<i>Of everybody's life</i>

203
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:09,997
<i>The darkness must go</i>

204
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:12,805
<i>Down the river</i>

205
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:16,600
<i>Of nights dreaming</i>

206
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:20,842
<i>Flow morphia slow</i>

207
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:23,235
<i>Let the sun</i>

208
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:26,238
<i>And light come streaming</i>

209
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:29,602
<i>Into my life</i>

210
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:35,600
<i>Into my life</i>

211
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:43,201
<i>There's a light</i>

212
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:47,635
<i>Over at the Frankenstein place</i>

213
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:51,002
<i>There's a light</i>

214
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:58,199
<i>Burning in the fireplace</i>

215
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:01,165
<i>There's a light</i>

216
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,795
<i>Light</i>

217
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:08,034
<i>In the darkness</i>

218
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:13,200
<i>Of everybody's life</i>

219
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:21,278
And so...

220
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:26,037
...it seemed that fortune
had smiled on Brad and Janet...

221
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:30,597
...and they had found the assistance
that their plight required.

222
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:32,997
Or had they?

223
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:38,199
Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold and I'm frightened.

224
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:40,800
Just a moment, Janet.
They may have a phone.

225
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,804
Hello.

226
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:05,602
Hi! My name's Brad Majors.

227
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:09,118
This is my fiancÃ©e, Janet Weiss.

228
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:13,433
I wondered if you might help us.
Our car broke down up the road.

229
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,437
Do you have a phone we might use?

230
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:18,437
You're wet.

231
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:23,004
Yes, it's raining.

232
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:24,994
Yes.

233
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,597
Oh.

234
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:36,197
I think, perhaps,
you better both come inside.

235
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,603
You're too kind.

236
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:58,794
I'm frightened.
What kind of place is this?

237
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:03,004
It's probably some kind of
hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

238
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:09,593
This way.

239
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:16,794
Are you having a party?

240
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,238
You've arrived on
a rather special night.

241
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:24,841
- It's one of the master's affairs.
- Oh.

242
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:26,837
- Lucky him.
- You're lucky.

243
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:31,795
He's lucky, I'm lucky,
we're all lucky!

244
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:47,435
<i>It's astounding</i>

245
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:50,199
<i>Time is fleeting</i>

246
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:54,082
<i>Madness takes its toll</i>

247
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:57,797
<i>But listen closely</i>

248
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:00,997
<i>Not for very much longer</i>

249
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:05,803
<i>I've got to keep control</i>

250
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:08,594
<i>I remember</i>

251
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,405
<i>Doing the time warp</i>

252
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,404
<i>Drinking</i>

253
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:16,034
<i>Those moments when</i>

254
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,594
<i>The blackness would hit me</i>

255
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:21,399
<i>And the void would be calling</i>

256
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:26,158
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

257
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:30,876
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

258
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:36,160
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

259
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:41,600
<i>- And a step to the right</i>
<i>- With your hands on your hips</i>

260
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,400
<i>You bring your knees in tight</i>

261
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:47,875
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

262
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,685
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

263
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:55,883
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

264
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,959
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

265
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:03,521
<i>It's so dreamy</i>

266
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:06,677
<i>Oh, fantasy free me</i>

267
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:08,603
<i>So you can't see me</i>

268
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:11,196
<i>No, not at all</i>

269
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,920
<i>In another dimension</i>

270
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:16,679
<i>With voyeuristic intention</i>

271
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,485
<i>Well secluded</i>

272
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,637
<i>I see all</i>

273
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:24,160
<i>With a bit of a mind flip</i>

274
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:27,084
<i>You're into the time slip</i>

275
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:31,683
<i>And nothing can ever be the same</i>

276
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:34,393
<i>You're spaced out on sensation</i>

277
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:37,483
<i>Like you're under sedation</i>

278
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:42,079
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

279
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:47,283
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

280
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:50,479
<i>I was walking down the street</i>
<i>Just having a think</i>

281
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,245
<i>When a snake of a guy</i>
<i>Gave me an evil wink</i>

282
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:55,481
<i>He shook a me up</i>
<i>He took me by surprise</i>

283
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:58,444
<i>He had a pickup truck</i>
<i>And the devil's eyes</i>

284
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:00,920
<i>He stared at me</i>
<i>And I felt a change</i>

285
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:03,235
<i>Time meant nothing</i>
<i>Never would again</i>

286
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:07,604
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

287
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:12,804
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

288
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:14,524
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

289
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:20,040

295
00:21:57,285 --> 00:22:01,198
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

296
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:06,438
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

297
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:07,913

<i>- With your hands on your hips</i>

299
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:16,883
<i>Bring your knees in tight</i>

300
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,441
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

301
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:22,394

00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:27,684
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

303
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:32,958
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

304
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:46,084
Say something.

305
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:51,124
Say! Do any of you guys know
how to Madison?

306
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:59,921
- Brad, please, let's get out of here.
- Keep a grip on yourself, Janet.

307
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,481
- But it seems so unhealthy here.
- It's just a party, Janet.

308
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:07,274
- Well, I want to go.
- We can't till I get to a phone.

309
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:10,039
- Then ask the butler or someone.
- Just a moment.

310
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:12,475
We don't want to interfere
with their celebrations.

311
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:14,676
This isn't the Chamber of Commerce.

312
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:17,524
They're probably foreigners
with different ways.

313
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:20,359
They may do some more folk dancing.

314
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,794
I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.

315
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,883
I'm here, there's nothing
to worry about.

316
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:34,476
<i>How do you do</i>

317
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:36,716
<i>I see you've met</i>

318
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:39,843
<i>My faithful handyman</i>

319
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:42,315
<i>He's just a little brought down</i>

320
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:45,477
<i>Because when you knocked</i>

321
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,478
<i>He thought you were the candyman</i>

322
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,922
<i>Don't get strung out</i>

323
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,076
<i>By the way I look</i>

324
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:57,601
<i>Don't judge a book by its cover</i>

325
00:23:57,845 --> 00:23:59,995
<i>I'm not much of a man</i>

326
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:01,917
<i>By the light of day</i>

327
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:05,874
<i>But by night I'm one hell of a lover</i>

328
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,481
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

329
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:13,718
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

330
00:24:13,965 --> 00:24:16,843
<i>... Transylvania</i>

331
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:21,116
<i>Let me show you around</i>

332
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:24,084
<i>Maybe play you a sound</i>

333
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,675
<i>You look like you're both</i>
<i>Pretty groovy</i>

334
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,524
<i>Or if you want something visual</i>

335
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:32,881
<i>That's not too abysmal</i>

336
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,276
<i>We could take in an old</i>
<i>Steve Reeves movie</i>

337
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:39,874
<i>I'm glad we caught you at home</i>

338
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,482
<i>Could we use your phone?</i>

339
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:45,320
<i>- We're both in a bit of a hurry</i>
<i>- Right</i>

340
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,277
<i>We'll just say where we are</i>

341
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:50,722
<i>- Then go back to the car</i>
<i>- A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Furter</i>

342
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:53,081
<i>We don't want to be any worry</i>

343
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:57,075
<i>Well, you got caught with a flat</i>

344
00:24:57,285 --> 00:24:58,923
<i>Well, how about that</i>

345
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,475
<i>Well, babies, don't you panic</i>

346
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:04,920
<i>By the light of the night</i>

347
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:07,076
<i>It'll all seem all right</i>

348
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:11,000
<i>I'll get you a satanic mechanic</i>

349
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:14,277
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

350
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:18,678
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

351
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:22,281
<i>... Transylvania</i>

352
00:25:24,245 --> 00:25:26,236
<i>Why don't you stay for the night</i>

353
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:28,681
<i>- Night</i>
<i>- Or maybe a bite</i>

354
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:29,721
<i>Bite</i>

355
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:33,037
<i>I could show you</i>
<i>My favorite obsession</i>

356
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:36,284
<i>I've been making a man</i>

357
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:38,801
<i>With blond hair and a tan</i>

358
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:42,117
<i>And he's good for relieving</i>
<i>My tension</i>

359
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:45,675
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

360
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:50,125
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

361
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:53,482
<i>... Transylvania</i>

362
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:55,281
Hit it! Hit it!

363
00:25:55,485 --> 00:26:00,115
<i>- I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>
<i>- Sweet transvestite</i>

364
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:03,277
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

365
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:05,521
<i>... Transylvania</i>

366
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:12,519
<i>So come up to the lab</i>

367
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,198
<i>And see what's on the slab</i>

368
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:18,354
<i>I see you shiver</i>

369
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:20,635
<i>With antici...</i>

370
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:23,474
<i>- pation</i>

371
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:26,556
<i>But maybe the rain</i>

372
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:29,477
<i>Is really to blame</i>

373
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:32,839
<i>So I'll remove the cause</i>

374
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:38,444
<i>But not the symptom</i>

375
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:52,434
Thank you.

376
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:57,479
Thank you very much.

377
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,274
Brad!

378
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:05,677
We'll play along for now and pull out
the aces when the time is right.

379
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:10,554
Slowly, slowly.
It's too nice a job to rush.

380
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:15,675
Hi. My name's Brad Majors and
this is my fiancÃ©e, Janet Weiss.

381
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:20,400
You are...?

382
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:23,876
You are very lucky to be invited
up to Frank's laboratory.

383
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,595
Some people would give their
right arm for the privilege.

384
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:29,881
People like you, maybe?

385
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,081
I've seen it.

386
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:39,680
Come along. The master doesn't
like to be kept waiting.

387
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:42,081
Shift it!

388
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:59,881
Is he...? Frank, I mean,
is he your husband?

389
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:04,273
The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think he ever will be.

390
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,993
- We are simply his servants.
- Oh.

391
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:51,073
Magenta.

392
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:53,678
Columbia.

393
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:56,475
Go and assist Riff Raff.

394
00:28:58,165 --> 00:28:59,883
I will entertain...

395
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:07,802
Brad Majors and this is
my fiancÃ©e, Janet Vice.

396
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:10,081
- Weiss.
- Weiss?

397
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:14,476
<i>EnchantÄ.</i>

398
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:17,279
Well, how nice.

399
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:20,318
And what charming underclothes
you both have.

400
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:23,921
But here, put these on.

401
00:29:24,165 --> 00:29:27,521
They'll make you feel less vulnerable.

402
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:31,120
It's not often
we receive visitors here.

403
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:34,004
Let alone offer them hospitality.

404
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:38,682
Hospitality! All we wanted to do
was use your telephone. Goddamn it!

405
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:41,120
A reasonable request you have ignored!

406
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:44,482
- Don't be ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!

407
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:47,525
How forceful you are, Brad.

408
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:51,963
Such a perfect specimen of manhood.
So dominant.

409
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:58,682
You must be awfully proud
of him, Janet.

410
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,474
Well, yes, I am.

411
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:05,482
- Do you have any tattoos, Brad?
- Certainly not.

412
00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:08,677
Oh, well. How about you?

413
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:11,081
Everything is in readiness, master.

414
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:14,283
We merely await your word.

415
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:26,397
Tonight, my unconventional
conventionists...

416
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,674
...you are to witness
a new breakthrough...

417
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:32,922
...in biochemical research.

418
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:37,158
And paradise is to be mine!

419
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:43,880
It was strange the way it happened.

420
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:46,084
Suddenly...

421
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:48,284
...you get a break.

422
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:52,876
All the pieces seem to fit into place.

423
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:56,874
What a sucker you've been.
What a fool.

424
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:59,725
The answer was there all the time.

425
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:04,277
It took a small accident
to make it happen.

426
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:07,725
- An accident!
- An accident!

427
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:10,399
That's how I discovered the secret.

428
00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:13,838
That elusive ingredient.

429
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:16,440
That spark...

430
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:19,597
...that is the breath of life.

431
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:23,393
Yes.

432
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:28,196
I have that knowledge.

433
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:31,435
I hold the secret...

434
00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:34,597
...to life itself!

435
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:50,560
You see...

436
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:53,280
...you are fortunate.

437
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:56,437
For tonight is the night...

438
00:31:56,685 --> 00:32:01,600
...that my beautiful creature
is destined to be born.

439
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:42,198
Throw open the switches
on the sonic oscillator.

440
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:50,202
And step up the reactor power input...

441
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:53,044
...three more points!

442
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:15,834
Oh, Brad!

443
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:17,803
It's all right, Janet.

444
00:35:00,805 --> 00:35:02,921
Oh, Rocky!

445
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:12,800
<i>The sword of Damocles</i>
<i>Is hanging over my head</i>

446
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:17,400
<i>I've got the feeling someone's</i>
<i>Gonna be cutting the thread</i>

447
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:22,837
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

448
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:25,883
<i>My life is a misery</i>

449
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,241
<i>Oh, can't you see</i>

450
00:35:28,485 --> 00:35:31,318
<i>That I'm at the start</i>
<i>Of a pretty big downer</i>

451
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:37,561
<i>I woke up this morning with a start</i>
<i>When I fell out of bed</i>

452
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:39,841
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

453
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:43,441
<i>And left from my dreaming</i>
<i>Was a feeling of unnameable dread</i>

454
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,835
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

455
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:48,599
<i>My high is low</i>

456
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:51,594
<i>I'm dressed up with no place to go</i>

457
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:54,405
<i>And all I know</i>

458
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:58,604
<i>Is I'm at the start</i>
<i>Of a pretty big downer</i>

459
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:03,560
<i>- That ain't no crime.</i>
<i>- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

460
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:06,444
<i>- That ain't no crime.</i>
<i>- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

461
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:09,205
Oh, my baby!

462
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:15,202
<i>The sword of Damocles</i>

00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:26,638
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

467
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,115
<i>My life is a mystery</i>

468
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:32,004

469
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:35,442
<i>That I'm at the start</i>
<i>Of a pretty big downer</i>

<i>That ain't no crime</i>

472
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:03,234
Well, really!

473
00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:07,004
That's no way to behave
on your first day out.

474
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:14,997
But since you're such
an exceptional beauty...

475
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:17,595
...I'm prepared to forgive you.

476
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:24,722
Oh, I just love success!

477
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:27,240
- He is a credit to your genius.
- Yes.

478
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:29,396
- A triumph of your will.
- Yes.

479
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:30,964
He's okay.

480
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:36,404
Okay?

481
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:40,154
Okay?!

482
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,399
I think we can do better than that.

483
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:50,840
Now, Brad and Janet...

484
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:52,996
...what do you think of him?

485
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:54,998
Well...

486
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:58,795
I don't like men
with too many muscles.

487
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:02,599
I didn't make him for you!

488
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:07,075
He carries the Charles Atlas
seal of approval.

489
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:22,799
<i>A weakling weighing 98 pounds</i>

490
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:25,879
<i>Will get sand in his face</i>

491
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:28,553
<i>When kicked to the ground</i>

492
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:32,918
<i>And soon in the gym</i>

493
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:35,804
<i>With a determined chin</i>

494
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:38,441
<i>The sweat from his pores</i>

495
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,400
<i>As he works for his cause</i>

496
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:47,361
<i>Will make him glisten</i>

497
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:50,601
<i>And gleam</i>

498
00:38:51,085 --> 00:38:53,440
<i>And with massage</i>

499
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:58,600
<i>And just a little bit of steam</i>

500
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:04,994
<i>He'll be pink</i>

501
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:08,124
<i>And quite clean</i>

502
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:12,483
<i>He'll be a strong man</i>

503
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:17,796
<i>Oh, honey</i>
<i>But the wrong man</i>

504
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:22,920
<i>He'll eat nutritious high protein</i>

505
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:25,520
<i>And swallow raw eggs</i>

506
00:39:25,765 --> 00:39:27,437
<i>Try to build up his shoulders</i>

507
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:30,643
<i>His chest, arms and legs</i>

508
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:35,436
<i>Such an effort</i>
<i>If he only knew of my plan</i>

509
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:38,916
<i>In just seven days</i>

510
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:43,602
<i>I can make you a man</i>

511
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:48,805
<i>He'll do press-ups and chin-ups</i>

512
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:51,075
<i>Do the snatch, clean and jerk</i>

513
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,599
<i>He thinks dynamic tension</i>

514
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:57,000
<i>Must be hard work</i>

515
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:59,042
<i>Such strenuous living</i>

516
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:01,435
<i>I just don't understand</i>

517
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:05,997
<i>When in just seven days</i>
<i>Oh, baby</i>

518
00:40:06,205 --> 00:40:10,881
<i>I can make you a man</i>

519
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,559
Eddie!

520
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,324
<i>Whatever happened to Saturday night</i>

521
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:47,639
<i>When you dressed sharp, felt all right</i>
<i>Don't seem the same since cosmic light</i>

522
00:40:47,885 --> 00:40:51,275
<i>Came into my life</i>
<i>I thought I was divine</i>

523
00:40:51,525 --> 00:40:56,394
<i>I'd go for a ride with chicks who'd go</i>
<i>And listen to the music on the radio</i>

524
00:40:56,605 --> 00:40:59,073
<i>A saxophone was blowing</i>
<i>On a rock 'n' roll show</i>

525
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:03,762
<i>We climbed in the back seat</i>
<i>We really had a good time</i>

526
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:06,519
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

527
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:09,195
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

528
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:12,439
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

529
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:15,358
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

530
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,878
Lovely party!

531
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:43,239
<i>My head used to swim</i>
<i>From the perfume I smelled</i>

532
00:41:43,485 --> 00:41:46,204
<i>My hands kind of fumbled</i>
<i>With her white plastic belt</i>

533
00:41:46,405 --> 00:41:49,078
<i>I'd taste her baby pink lipstick</i>
<i>And that's when I'd melt</i>

534
00:41:49,325 --> 00:41:52,123
<i>She'd whisper in my ear</i>
<i>Tonight she really was mine</i>

535
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:57,120
<i>Get in front and put some hair oil on</i>
<i>Buddy Holly was singing his last song</i>

536
00:41:57,365 --> 00:42:00,243
<i>With your arms around your girl</i>
<i>You tried to sing along</i>

537
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:04,763
<i>It felt pretty good</i>
<i>Really had a good time</i>

538
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:08,003
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

539
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:09,963
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

540
00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:13,200
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

541
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:16,039
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

542
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:55,801
One from the vaults.

543
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:07,803
Oh, baby!

544
00:44:15,205 --> 00:44:17,002
Don't be upset.

545
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:21,400
It was a mercy killing.

546
00:44:21,845 --> 00:44:25,201
He had a certain naive charm...

547
00:44:25,405 --> 00:44:27,521
...but no muscle.

548
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:32,645
<i>But a deltoid</i>

549
00:44:32,885 --> 00:44:35,843
<i>And a bicep</i>

550
00:44:36,085 --> 00:44:40,920
<i>A hot groin</i>
<i>And a tricep</i>

551
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:43,440
<i>Makes me...</i>

552
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:45,600
<i>... shake</i>

553
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:49,394
<i>Makes me want to take Charles Atlas</i>

554
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:52,358
<i>By the hand</i>

555
00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:55,597
<i>In just seven days</i>
<i>Oh, baby</i>

556
00:44:55,845 --> 00:45:00,680
<i>I can make you a man</i>

557
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:07,484
<i>I don't want no dissension</i>

558
00:45:08,965 --> 00:45:13,436
<i>Just dynamic tension</i>

559
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:19,003
<i>I'm a muscle fan</i>

560
00:45:19,245 --> 00:45:22,396
<i>In just seven days</i>

561
00:45:22,765 --> 00:45:27,475
<i>I can make you a man</i>

562
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:32,404
<i>Dig it if you can</i>

563
00:45:32,925 --> 00:45:35,997
<i>In just seven days</i>

564
00:45:36,205 --> 00:45:39,914
<i>I can make you a man</i>

565
00:45:52,765 --> 00:45:56,997
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!

566
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:15,039
There are those who say
that life is an illusion...

567
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:18,800
...and that reality is simply
a figment of the imagination.

568
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:23,000
If this is so, then Brad and Janet
are quite safe.

569
00:46:23,965 --> 00:46:27,844
However, the sudden departure
of their host...

570
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,838
...and his creation...

571
00:46:31,085 --> 00:46:34,122
...into the seclusion
of his somber bridal suite...

572
00:46:34,365 --> 00:46:39,041
...had left them feeling
both apprehensive and uneasy.

573
00:46:39,285 --> 00:46:42,800
A feeling which grew
as the other guests departed...

574
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:47,402
...and they were shown
to their separate rooms.

575
00:47:23,605 --> 00:47:26,119
Who is it? Who's there?

576
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:31,316
It's only me, Janet.

577
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,120
Brad, darling, come in.

578
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:38,121
Oh, Brad!

579
00:47:39,405 --> 00:47:41,123
Yes, my darling! But what if...?

580
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:43,321
Everything's going to be all right.

581
00:47:43,565 --> 00:47:46,716
Oh, I hope so, my darling.

582
00:47:49,205 --> 00:47:53,517
- It's you!
- I'm afraid so. But isn't it nice?

583
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:58,043
You beast, you monster!
What have you done with Brad?

584
00:47:58,285 --> 00:48:01,118
Well, nothing.
Why, do you think I should?

585
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:04,641
You tricked me! I wouldn't have.
I've never, never...

586
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:07,035
Yes. Yes, I know.

587
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,515
But it isn't all bad, is it?

588
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:13,715
I think you'll really find it
quite pleasurable.

589
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:16,760
- So soft, so sensual.
- Stop! I mean, help!

590
00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:18,723
Brad. Oh, Brad!

591
00:48:19,805 --> 00:48:23,844
Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you like this?

592
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:27,521
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame!

593
00:48:27,725 --> 00:48:29,920
I was saving myself.

594
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:34,324
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.

595
00:48:34,965 --> 00:48:36,717
Promise you won't tell Brad?

596
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:39,917
Cross my heart and hope to die.

597
00:50:26,085 --> 00:50:28,963
Oh, Brad, darling, it's no good here!

598
00:50:29,205 --> 00:50:30,718
It'll destroy us.

599
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:34,116
Don't worry. We'll be away from here
in the morning.

600
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:37,317
Oh, Brad, you're so strong
and protective.

601
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:42,724
You!

602
00:50:42,925 --> 00:50:45,564
I'm afraid so, Brad.
But isn't it nice?

603
00:50:45,805 --> 00:50:48,763
Why you...
What have you done with Janet?

604
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:51,360
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?

605
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:56,315
You tricked me. I wouldn't have.
I've never, never, never!

606
00:50:56,565 --> 00:50:59,125
Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?

607
00:50:59,365 --> 00:51:03,324
Not even half bad.
I think you'll really quite enjoy it.

608
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:07,038
- So soft. So sensual.
- No, stop.

609
00:51:07,285 --> 00:51:08,718
Oh, Janet.

610
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:10,713
Janet!

611
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:15,164
Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?

612
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:19,318
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame.

613
00:51:19,565 --> 00:51:21,556
I thought it was the real thing!

614
00:51:21,805 --> 00:51:23,523
Oh, come on, Brad, admit it.

615
00:51:23,765 --> 00:51:25,517
You liked it, didn't you?

616
00:51:25,765 --> 00:51:28,962
There's no crime in giving yourself
over to pleasure.

617
00:51:29,205 --> 00:51:32,914
Oh, Brad, you have wasted
so much time already.

618
00:51:33,165 --> 00:51:36,521
Janet needn't know. I won't tell her.

619
00:51:37,205 --> 00:51:39,116
You promise you won't tell?

620
00:51:40,285 --> 00:51:42,515

Coming!

What's happening here? Where's Brad?

626
00:52:06,805 --> 00:52:08,921
Where's anybody?

00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:19,241
Oh, Brad!

628
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:24,720
Brad, my darling, how could I
have done this to you?

629
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:38,442
Oh, If only we hadn't
made this journey.

630

If only the car hadn't broken down.

But you're hurt.

636

Did they do this to you?

637

640
00:53:57,165 --> 00:54:01,124
...vehement or excited mental state."

641
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:06,718
It is also a powerful
and irrational master.

642
00:54:06,925 --> 00:54:11,555
And from what Magenta and Columbia
eagerly viewed on their TV monitor...

643
00:54:11,805 --> 00:54:15,320
<i>... there seemed little doubt</i>
<i>that Janet was indeed...</i>

644
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:16,958
<i>... its slave.</i>

645
00:54:17,605 --> 00:54:20,517
Tell us about it, Janet.

646
00:54:23,205 --> 00:54:26,914
<i>I was feeling done in</i>

647
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:29,322
<i>Couldn't win</i>

648
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:33,915
<i>I'd only ever kissed before</i>

649
00:54:35,925 --> 00:54:37,358
You mean she...?

650
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:41,120
<i>I thought there's no use getting</i>

651
00:54:41,325 --> 00:54:44,362
<i>Into heavy petting</i>

652
00:54:44,605 --> 00:54:48,723
<i>It only leads to trouble</i>

653
00:54:48,925 --> 00:54:50,995
<i>And seat wetting</i>

654
00:54:51,445 --> 00:54:54,323
<i>Now all I want to know</i>

655
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:57,320
<i>Is how to go</i>

656
00:54:57,525 --> 00:55:00,437
<i>I've tasted blood and I want more</i>

657
00:55:00,685 --> 00:55:02,403
More, more, more.

658
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:05,565
<i>I'll put up no resistance</i>

659
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:07,955
<i>I want to stay the distance</i>

660
00:55:08,765 --> 00:55:10,756
<i>I've got an itch to scratch</i>

661
00:55:11,685 --> 00:55:13,915
<i>I need assistance</i>

662
00:55:14,165 --> 00:55:16,554
<i>Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me</i>

663
00:55:16,805 --> 00:55:19,319
<i>I wanna be dirty</i>

664
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,959
<i>Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me</i>

665
00:55:22,205 --> 00:55:24,514
<i>Creature of the night</i>

666
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:32,119
<i>Then if anything grows</i>

667
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:34,919
<i>While you pose</i>

668
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:38,003
<i>I'll oil you up and rub you down</i>

669
00:55:38,245 --> 00:55:40,475
Down, down, down.

670
00:55:40,725 --> 00:55:45,515
<i>And that's just one small fraction</i>
<i>Of the main attraction</i>

671
00:55:46,565 --> 00:55:48,715
<i>You need a friendly hand</i>

672
00:55:48,965 --> 00:55:51,160
<i>Oh, and I need action</i>

673
00:55:51,405 --> 00:55:53,965
<i>Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me</i>

674
00:55:54,205 --> 00:55:56,639
<i>I wanna be dirty</i>

675
00:55:56,885 --> 00:55:59,319
<i>Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me</i>

676
00:55:59,525 --> 00:56:02,039
<i>Creature of the night</i>

677
00:56:02,285 --> 00:56:04,355

<i>Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me</i>

<i>Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me</i>

00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:17,924
<i>I wanna be dirty</i>

683
00:56:18,165 --> 00:56:20,201
<i>Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me</i>

684
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:22,720
<i>Creature of the night</i>

685
00:56:22,965 --> 00:56:24,523
Creature of the night.

686
00:56:25,485 --> 00:56:27,521
Creature of the night?

687
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,916
Creature of the night.

688
00:56:30,685 --> 00:56:32,004
Creature of the night.

689
00:56:33,285 --> 00:56:35,116
Creature of the night.

690
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:37,363
<i>Creature of the night</i>

691
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:39,678
Creature of the night.

692
00:56:41,005 --> 00:56:43,519
<i>Creature of the night</i>

693
00:56:49,285 --> 00:56:51,515
Mercy!

694
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,763
How did it happen?

695
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:59,520
I understood you were to be watching.

696
00:56:59,765 --> 00:57:02,757
I was only away for a minute, master.

697
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:07,715
Well, see if you can find him
on the monitor.

698
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:15,758
Master.

699
00:57:16,005 --> 00:57:19,122
Master, we have a visitor.

700
00:57:24,165 --> 00:57:25,314
Hey, Scotty!

701
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:28,514
Dr. Everett Scott.

702
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:31,956
You know this earthling...
- this person?

703
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:36,164
I most certainly do. He happens
to be an old friend of mine.

704
00:57:36,405 --> 00:57:38,123
I see.

705
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:41,922
So this wasn't
simply a chance meeting.

706
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:44,640
You came here with a purpose.

707
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:48,674
I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.

708
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:51,314
I know what you told me, Brad.

709
00:57:51,525 --> 00:57:56,121
But this Dr. Everett Scott,
his name is not unknown to me.

710
00:57:56,725 --> 00:57:58,795
He was a science teacher
at Denton High.

711
00:57:59,085 --> 00:58:01,155
And now he works for your government.

712
00:58:02,005 --> 00:58:04,724
He's attached
to the Bureau of Investigation...

713
00:58:04,925 --> 00:58:08,361
...of that which you call UFOs!
Isn't that right, Brad?

714
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,914
He might be. I don't know.

715
00:58:11,165 --> 00:58:14,123
The intruder is entering
the building, master.

716
00:58:16,805 --> 00:58:20,559
He'll probably be in the Zen Room.

717
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:30,920
Shall we inquire of him in person?

718
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,041
Great Scott!

719
00:59:16,725 --> 00:59:17,953
Frank N. Furter.

720
00:59:19,085 --> 00:59:20,359
We meet at last.

721
00:59:22,205 --> 00:59:23,763
Dr. Scott!

722
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:26,235
Brad! What are you doing here?

723
00:59:27,485 --> 00:59:29,715
Don't play games, Dr. Scott.

724
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,483
You know perfectly well
what Brad Majors is doing here.

725
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:35,761
It was part of your plan, was it not?

726
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:39,680
That he and his female
should check the layout for you?

727
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:44,597
Well, unfortunately for you all,
the plans are to be changed.

728
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:48,917
I hope you're adaptable, Dr. Scott.

729
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:51,320
I know Brad is.

730
00:59:51,525 --> 00:59:55,484
I assure you, Brad's presence
comes as a complete surprise to me.

731
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,522
I came here to find Eddie.

732
00:59:58,525 --> 01:00:00,595
- Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
- Eddie?

733
01:00:00,845 --> 01:00:02,597
What do you know of Eddie?

734
01:00:03,605 --> 01:00:06,165
I know a great deal
about a lot of things.

735
01:00:06,405 --> 01:00:09,363
You see, Eddie happens to be
my nephew.

736
01:00:14,405 --> 01:00:15,918
Dr. Scott.

737
01:00:19,925 --> 01:00:21,517
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!

738
01:00:21,765 --> 01:00:22,993
- Janet!
- Brad!

739
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:24,280
Rocky!

740
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:26,117
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!

741
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:27,764
- Janet!
- Brad!

742
01:00:28,005 --> 01:00:29,074
Rocky!

743
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:36,720
Listen! I made you...

744
01:00:36,965 --> 01:00:40,514
...and I can break you just as easily.

745
01:00:43,205 --> 01:00:46,242
Master, dinner is prepared!

746
01:00:48,965 --> 01:00:50,284
Excellent.

747
01:00:51,405 --> 01:00:55,921
Under the circumstances,
formal dress is to be optional.

748
01:00:58,565 --> 01:01:02,922
Food has always played a vital role
in life's rituals:

749
01:01:03,165 --> 01:01:07,556
The breaking of bread,
the last meal of the condemned man...

750
01:01:07,805 --> 01:01:11,036
...and now this meal.

751
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:14,363
<i>However informal it might appear...</i>

752
01:01:14,605 --> 01:01:18,757
<i>... you can be sure there was to be</i>
<i>very little bonhomie.</i>

753
01:02:32,245 --> 01:02:33,234
A toast.

754
01:02:35,045 --> 01:02:37,161
To absent friends.

755
01:02:37,645 --> 01:02:39,556
To absent friends.

756
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:45,565
And Rocky.

757
01:02:54,245 --> 01:02:55,917
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

758
01:02:56,165 --> 01:02:57,996
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

759
01:02:58,245 --> 01:03:00,156
<i>Happy birthday, dear Rocky</i>

760
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:02,236
<i>- Happy birthday...</i>
- Shall we?

761
01:03:20,205 --> 01:03:22,958
We came here to discuss Eddie.

762
01:03:23,205 --> 01:03:24,524
Eddie!

763
01:03:28,645 --> 01:03:30,283
It's a rather tender subject.

764
01:03:30,965 --> 01:03:32,956
Another slice, anyone?

765
01:03:38,845 --> 01:03:40,563
Excuse me.

766
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:55,480
I knew he was in with a bad crowd,
but it was worse than I imagined.

767
01:03:55,725 --> 01:03:57,283
Aliens!

768
01:03:57,525 --> 01:03:58,435
Dr. Scott!

769
01:03:59,165 --> 01:04:00,757
Go on, Dr. Scott.

770
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:05,116
Or should I say Dr. Von Scott?

771
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:08,354
Just what exactly are you implying?

772
01:04:08,605 --> 01:04:09,754
It's all right!

773
01:04:09,965 --> 01:04:11,637
That's all right, Brad.

774
01:04:14,965 --> 01:04:17,320
<i>From the day he was born</i>

775
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:22,758
<i>He was trouble</i>

776
01:04:24,645 --> 01:04:27,364
<i>He was the thorn</i>

777
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:32,155
<i>In his mother's side</i>

778
01:04:34,045 --> 01:04:37,162
<i>She tried in vain</i>

779
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:44,157
<i>But he never caused her</i>
<i>Nothing but shame</i>

780
01:04:45,045 --> 01:04:48,276
<i>He left home...</i>

781
01:04:48,525 --> 01:04:51,597
<i>... the day she died</i>

782
01:04:51,845 --> 01:04:53,961
<i>From the day she was gone</i>

783
01:04:54,965 --> 01:04:56,956
<i>All he wanted</i>

784
01:04:57,805 --> 01:04:59,955
<i>Was rock 'n' roll porn</i>

785
01:05:00,565 --> 01:05:02,954
Und <i>a motorbike</i>

786
01:05:03,565 --> 01:05:05,954
<i>Shooting up junk</i>

787
01:05:06,965 --> 01:05:10,002
<i>He was a low-down, cheap little punk</i>

788
01:05:10,245 --> 01:05:15,160
<i>Taking everyone for a ride</i>

789
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,605
<i>When Eddie said</i>
<i>He didn't like his teddy</i>

790
01:05:18,845 --> 01:05:21,200
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

791
01:05:21,445 --> 01:05:24,164
<i>But when he threatened your life</i>
<i>With a switchblade knife</i>

792
01:05:24,405 --> 01:05:25,758
<i>- What a guy</i>
<i>- Makes you cry</i>

793
01:05:25,965 --> 01:05:27,364
Und <i>I did</i>

794
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:30,598
<i>Everybody shoved him</i>

795
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:33,757
<i>I very nearly loved him</i>

796
01:05:34,005 --> 01:05:36,565
<i>I said, hey, listen to me</i>

797
01:05:36,805 --> 01:05:39,603
<i>Stay sane inside insanity</i>

798
01:05:39,845 --> 01:05:44,760
<i>But he locked the door</i>
<i>And threw away the key</i>

799
01:05:45,005 --> 01:05:46,802
<i>But he must've been drawn</i>

800
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,003
<i>Into something</i>

801
01:05:51,245 --> 01:05:53,281
<i>Making him warn me</i>

802
01:05:53,525 --> 01:05:55,117
<i>In a note which reads:</i>

803
01:05:55,325 --> 01:05:56,758
<i>What's it say? What's it say?</i>

804
01:05:57,005 --> 01:05:58,324
<i>"I'm out of my head</i>

805
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:02,764
<i>Oh, hurry, or I may be dead</i>

806
01:06:03,325 --> 01:06:08,240
<i>They mustn't carry out</i>
<i>Their evil deeds"</i>

807
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:12,164
<i>When Eddie said</i>
<i>He didn't like his teddy</i>

808
01:06:12,365 --> 01:06:14,083
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

809
01:06:14,725 --> 01:06:17,319
<i>When he threatened your life</i>
<i>With a switchblade knife</i>

810
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:19,158
<i>- What a guy</i>
<i>- Makes you cry</i>

811
01:06:19,405 --> 01:06:20,758
Und <i>I did</i>

812
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:23,360
<i>When Eddie said</i>
<i>He didn't like his teddy</i>

813
01:06:23,565 --> 01:06:25,874
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

814
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:29,242
<i>But when he threatened your life</i>
<i>With a switchblade knife</i>

815
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:34,683
<i>- What a guy</i>
<i>- Woe, woe, woe</i>

816
01:06:34,925 --> 01:06:39,362
<i>- Makes you cry</i>
<i>- Hey, hey, hey</i>

817
01:06:39,605 --> 01:06:42,915
Und <i>I did</i>

818
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,794
<i>Hey</i>

819
01:06:48,365 --> 01:06:49,354
Oh.

820
01:07:00,445 --> 01:07:01,798
Oh, Rocky!

821
01:07:03,885 --> 01:07:05,955
How could you?!

822
01:07:13,605 --> 01:07:15,357
This way! This way!

823
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:19,439
Shut up!

824
01:07:20,925 --> 01:07:23,962
<i>I'll tell you once</i>
<i>I won't tell you twice</i>

825
01:07:24,205 --> 01:07:27,595
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Janet Weiss</i>

826
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:31,076
<i>Your apple pie</i>
<i>Don't taste too nice</i>

827
01:07:31,325 --> 01:07:34,522
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Janet Weiss</i>

828
01:07:41,045 --> 01:07:44,401
<i>I've laid the seed</i>
<i>It should be all you need</i>

829
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:46,476
<i>You're as sensual as a pencil</i>

830
01:07:46,725 --> 01:07:48,283
<i>Wound up like an E or first string</i>

831
01:07:48,525 --> 01:07:50,959
<i>When we made it</i>
<i>Did ya hear a bell ring?</i>

832
01:07:51,645 --> 01:07:54,603
<i>You got a block</i>
<i>Well, take my advice</i>

833
01:07:54,845 --> 01:07:58,758
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Janet Weiss</i>

834
01:07:59,165 --> 01:08:02,521
<i>The transducer</i>
<i>Will seduce ya</i>

835
01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:07,198
My feet! I can't move my feet!

836
01:08:07,445 --> 01:08:10,403
My wheels!
My God, I can't move my wheels.

837
01:08:11,845 --> 01:08:13,961
It's as if we were glued to the spot.

838
01:08:14,405 --> 01:08:15,963
You are.

839
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:19,596
So quake with fear, you tiny fools.

840
01:08:21,045 --> 01:08:22,319
We're trapped.

841
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:26,753
<i>It's something you'll get used to</i>
<i>A mental mind fuck can be nice</i>

842
01:08:26,965 --> 01:08:27,761
No!

843
01:08:28,005 --> 01:08:31,077
You won't find Earth people
the easy mark you imagine.

844
01:08:31,325 --> 01:08:33,202
This sonic transducer...

845
01:08:33,445 --> 01:08:37,677
...it is some kind of audio-vibratory,
physiomolecular transport device?

846
01:08:37,925 --> 01:08:39,404
- You mean...?
- Yes, Brad.

847
01:08:39,645 --> 01:08:42,955
It's something we ourselves
have been working on for a while.

848
01:08:43,205 --> 01:08:46,880
But it seems our friend here has found
a means of perfecting it.

849
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:50,276
A device capable
of breaking down solid matter...

850
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:53,756
...and then projecting it
through space, and who knows...

851
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:57,395
...perhaps even time itself!

852
01:08:57,645 --> 01:08:59,954
He's gonna send us to another planet?

853
01:09:00,165 --> 01:09:03,202
Planet schmanet, Janet.

854
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:06,683
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Janet Weiss</i>

855
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:10,759
<i>You'd better wise up</i>
<i>Build your thighs up</i>

856
01:09:10,965 --> 01:09:12,398
<i>You'd better wise up</i>

857
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:14,681
And then she cried out:

858
01:09:14,925 --> 01:09:16,597
Stop!

859
01:09:20,605 --> 01:09:25,520
<i>Don't get hot and flustered</i>

860
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,363
<i>Use a bit of mustard</i>

861
01:09:30,565 --> 01:09:33,159
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

862
01:09:33,405 --> 01:09:35,999
<i>But you'd better not...</i>

863
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:39,165
<i>... try to hurt her</i>

864
01:09:39,645 --> 01:09:40,714
<i>Frank Furter</i>

865
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:44,359
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

866
01:09:44,565 --> 01:09:47,284
<i>But you'd better not...</i>

867
01:09:47,525 --> 01:09:50,358
<i>... try to hurt her</i>

868
01:09:50,725 --> 01:09:52,124
<i>Frank Furter</i>

869
01:09:53,245 --> 01:09:55,315
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

870
01:09:57,645 --> 01:10:01,399
My God! I can't stand
any more of this.

871
01:10:01,645 --> 01:10:06,355
First, you spurn me for Eddie, then you
toss him like an old coat for Rocky.

872
01:10:06,925 --> 01:10:10,156
You chew people up
and then you spit them out again.

873
01:10:10,925 --> 01:10:12,199
I loved you.

874
01:10:12,805 --> 01:10:14,557
Do you hear me? I loved you.

875
01:10:14,765 --> 01:10:18,155
And what did it get me?
I'll tell you, a big nothing.

876
01:10:18,405 --> 01:10:22,398
You're like a sponge. You drain
others of their love and emotion.

877
01:10:22,645 --> 01:10:24,158
Well, I've had enough!

878
01:10:24,365 --> 01:10:28,324
Choose between me and Rocky, so named
because of the rocks in his head.

879
01:10:38,645 --> 01:10:41,364
It's not easy, having a good time.

880
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:52,362
Even smiling makes my face ache.

881
01:10:55,645 --> 01:10:58,364
And my children turn on me.

882
01:10:58,805 --> 01:11:01,956
Rocky's behaving just the way
that Eddie did.

883
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:05,793
Maybe I made a mistake...

884
01:11:06,045 --> 01:11:08,764
...splitting his brain
between the two of them.

885
01:11:09,005 --> 01:11:11,200
I grow weary of this world!

886
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:14,562
When shall we return to Transylvania?!

887
01:11:15,645 --> 01:11:17,158
Magenta...

888
01:11:17,765 --> 01:11:21,280
...I am indeed grateful to both you
and your brother, Riff Raff.

889
01:11:21,525 --> 01:11:23,959
You have both served me well.

890
01:11:24,165 --> 01:11:28,078
Loyalty such as yours
shall not go unrewarded.

891
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:32,762
You'll discover that when the mood
takes me, I can be quite generous.

892
01:11:32,965 --> 01:11:35,957
I ask for nothing, master.

893
01:11:36,445 --> 01:11:40,358
And you shall receive it in abundance!

894
01:11:42,325 --> 01:11:45,556
Come. We are ready
for the floorshow.

895
01:12:12,565 --> 01:12:17,434
<i>And so, by some extraordinary</i>
<i>coincidence...</i>

896
01:12:17,645 --> 01:12:20,443
...fate, it seemed, had decided
that Brad and Janet...

897
01:12:20,685 --> 01:12:24,394
...should keep that appointment
with their friend Dr. Everett Scott.

898
01:12:24,645 --> 01:12:26,476
But it was to be in a situation...

899
01:12:26,725 --> 01:12:29,762
...which none of them could have
possibly foreseen.

900
01:12:29,965 --> 01:12:34,243
And just a few hours
after announcing their engagement...

901
01:12:34,485 --> 01:12:37,955
...Brad and Janet had both tasted...

902
01:12:38,845 --> 01:12:40,756
...forbidden fruit.

903
01:12:42,205 --> 01:12:43,797
This in itself was proof...

904
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:47,276
...that their host
was a man of little morals...

905
01:12:47,525 --> 01:12:50,358
...and some persuasion.

906
01:12:51,045 --> 01:12:55,561
What further indignities
were they to be subjected to?

907
01:12:55,845 --> 01:13:00,555
And what of the floorshow
that had been spoken of?

908
01:13:01,165 --> 01:13:03,804
In an empty house...

909
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:06,878
...in the middle of the night?

910
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:09,764
What diabolical plan...

911
01:13:10,005 --> 01:13:13,964
...had seized
Frank's crazed imagination?

912
01:13:15,805 --> 01:13:17,761
What indeed?

913
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:21,801
From what had gone before,
it was clear...

914
01:13:22,045 --> 01:13:25,401
...that this was to be no picnic.

915
01:13:52,765 --> 01:13:56,394
<i>It was great when it all began</i>

916
01:13:56,645 --> 01:14:01,161
<i>I was a regular Frankie fan</i>

917
01:14:01,365 --> 01:14:04,675
<i>But it was over when he had the plan</i>

918
01:14:04,925 --> 01:14:08,964
<i>To start working on a muscleman</i>

919
01:14:09,165 --> 01:14:12,760
<i>Now the only thing that gives me hope</i>

920
01:14:12,965 --> 01:14:17,356
<i>Is my love of a certain dope</i>

921
01:14:17,605 --> 01:14:20,073
<i>Rose tints my world</i>

922
01:14:20,325 --> 01:14:24,000
<i>Keeps me safe</i>
<i>From my trouble and pain</i>

923
01:14:25,445 --> 01:14:29,199
<i>I'm just seven hours old</i>

924
01:14:29,445 --> 01:14:32,323
<i>Truly beautiful to behold</i>

925
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:36,962
<i>And somebody should be told</i>

926
01:14:37,245 --> 01:14:40,999
<i>My libido hasn't been controlled</i>

927
01:14:41,525 --> 01:14:45,154
<i>Now the only thing I've come to trust</i>

928
01:14:45,525 --> 01:14:49,564
<i>Is an orgasmic rush of lust</i>

929
01:14:49,845 --> 01:14:51,358
<i>Rose tints my world</i>

930
01:14:51,605 --> 01:14:55,757
<i>And keeps me safe</i>
<i>From my trouble and pain</i>

931
01:14:58,125 --> 01:15:01,800
<i>It's beyond me</i>

932
01:15:02,045 --> 01:15:06,004
<i>Help me, Mommy</i>

933
01:15:06,285 --> 01:15:09,800
<i>I'll be good, you'll see</i>

934
01:15:10,045 --> 01:15:13,355
<i>Take this dream away</i>

935
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:16,480
<i>What's this</i>

936
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:18,556
<i>Let's see</i>

937
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:22,161
<i>I feel sexy</i>

938
01:15:23,525 --> 01:15:26,164
<i>What's come over me</i>

939
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:29,238
<i>Here it comes again</i>

940
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:35,994
<i>I feel released</i>

941
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:39,362
<i>Bad times deceased</i>

942
01:15:39,565 --> 01:15:42,682
<i>My confidence has increased</i>

943
01:15:43,965 --> 01:15:46,957
<i>Reality is here</i>

944
01:15:47,165 --> 01:15:51,204
<i>The game has been disbanded</i>

945
01:15:51,445 --> 01:15:54,755
<i>My mind has been expanded</i>

946
01:15:54,965 --> 01:15:58,037
<i>It's a gas that Frankie's landed</i>

947
01:15:59,165 --> 01:16:03,556
<i>His lust is so sincere</i>

948
01:16:37,845 --> 01:16:39,676
<i>Whatever happened...</i>

949
01:16:39,925 --> 01:16:42,359
<i>... to Fay Wray</i>

950
01:16:42,845 --> 01:16:44,597
<i>That delicate...</i>

951
01:16:44,845 --> 01:16:49,202
<i>... satin-draped frame</i>

952
01:16:50,325 --> 01:16:54,364
<i>As it clung to her thigh</i>

953
01:16:54,645 --> 01:16:59,560
<i>How I started to cry</i>

954
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:03,803
<i>'Cause I wanted to be dressed</i>

955
01:17:04,045 --> 01:17:08,163
<i>Just the same</i>

956
01:17:09,365 --> 01:17:11,481
<i>Give yourself over</i>

957
01:17:11,725 --> 01:17:15,604
<i>To absolute pleasure</i>

958
01:17:15,845 --> 01:17:18,803
<i>Swim the warm waters</i>

959
01:17:19,045 --> 01:17:22,594
<i>Of sins of the flesh</i>

<i>Can't you just see it</i>

965
01:17:55,445 --> 01:17:58,357
<i>Don't dream it</i>

966
01:17:59,645 --> 01:18:02,364

<i>I'm going home</i>

01:23:16,445 --> 01:23:19,835
<i>I'm going home</i>

01:23:26,725 --> 01:23:30,240
<i>Everywhere it's been the same</i>

1034
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:34,554
<i>Feeling</i>

1035

<i>Blue skies</i>

1043
01:24:04,965 --> 01:24:08,037
<i>Through the tears</i>

<i>And I realize</i>

01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:19,600
<i>That I'm going home</i>

1047

01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:44,040
<i>I'm going home</i>

1050
01:25:07,285 --> 01:25:10,243
How sentimental.

1051
01:25:21,285 --> 01:25:23,401
And also presumptuous of you.

1052
01:25:25,325 --> 01:25:28,237
You see, when I said "we"...

1053
01:25:28,485 --> 01:25:30,953
...were to return to Transylvania...

1054
01:25:31,205 --> 01:25:33,480
...I referred only
to Magenta and myself.

1055
01:25:34,445 --> 01:25:37,642
I'm sorry, however, if you found
my words misleading...

1056
01:25:37,845 --> 01:25:38,880
...but you see...

1057
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:41,844
...you are to remain here.

1058
01:25:42,245 --> 01:25:44,634
In spirit anyway.

1059
01:25:46,205 --> 01:25:47,843
Good heavens, that's a laser.

1060
01:25:48,045 --> 01:25:49,364
Yes, Dr. Scott.

1061
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:53,834
A laser capable of emitting
a beam of pure anti-matter.

1062
01:25:54,885 --> 01:25:56,557
You're going to kill him?

1063
01:25:57,125 --> 01:26:00,037
- What's his crime?
- You saw what became of Eddie.

1064
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,401
Society must be protected.

1065
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:04,841
Exactly, Dr. Scott.

1066
01:26:05,045 --> 01:26:07,843
Now, Frank N. Furter,
your time has come

1067
01:26:08,525 --> 01:26:11,835
Say goodbye to all of this...

1068
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:16,913
...and hello to oblivion.

1069
01:26:33,525 --> 01:26:34,640
No.

1070
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:36,114
No.

1071
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:37,838
No!

1072
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:05,644
Good God!

1073
01:28:06,845 --> 01:28:08,039
You killed them.

1074
01:28:08,285 --> 01:28:12,836
But I thought you liked them.
They liked you.

1075
01:28:13,445 --> 01:28:15,834
They didn't like me!

1076
01:28:16,725 --> 01:28:19,034
They never liked me!

1077
01:28:19,325 --> 01:28:21,043
You did right.

1078
01:28:34,645 --> 01:28:37,637
A decision had to be made.

1079
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:40,241
You're okay by me.

1080
01:28:41,325 --> 01:28:43,236
Dr. Scott...

1081
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:48,357
...I'm sorry about your nephew.

1082
01:28:48,605 --> 01:28:49,833
Eddie?

1083
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,442
Yes, well,
perhaps it was for the best.

1084
01:28:55,685 --> 01:28:59,644
You should leave now, Dr. Scott,
while it is still possible.

1085
01:28:59,925 --> 01:29:02,485
We are about
to beam the entire house...

1086
01:29:02,725 --> 01:29:05,364
...back to the planet of Transsexual...

1087
01:29:05,605 --> 01:29:08,642
...in the galaxy of Transylvania.

1088
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:11,240
Go.

1089
01:29:12,405 --> 01:29:13,633
Now.

1090
01:29:25,845 --> 01:29:29,633
Our noble mission
is almost completed...

1091
01:29:31,085 --> 01:29:33,235
...my most beautiful sister.

1092
01:29:34,005 --> 01:29:38,237
And soon we shall return
to the moon-drenched shores...

1093
01:29:38,485 --> 01:29:40,635
...of our beloved planet.

1094
01:29:42,245 --> 01:29:46,443
Sweet Transsexual.

1095
01:29:47,485 --> 01:29:50,238
Land of night.

1096
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:56,040
To sing and dance once more
to your dark refrain.

1097
01:30:01,045 --> 01:30:02,842
To take that...

1098
01:30:04,605 --> 01:30:07,642
...step to the right.

1099
01:30:09,525 --> 01:30:12,244
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

1100
01:30:12,485 --> 01:30:15,636
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

1101
01:30:16,205 --> 01:30:19,038
And our world...

1102
01:30:19,285 --> 01:30:24,040
...will do the time warp again!

1103
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:46,356
<i>I've done a lot</i>

1104
01:30:46,605 --> 01:30:50,644
<i>God knows I've tried</i>

1105
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:54,281
<i>To find the truth</i>

1106
01:30:54,525 --> 01:30:58,643
<i>I've even lied</i>

1107
01:30:58,885 --> 01:31:02,241
<i>But all I know</i>

1108
01:31:02,485 --> 01:31:05,477
<i>Is down inside</i>

1109
01:31:05,725 --> 01:31:10,082
<i>I'm bleeding</i>

1110
01:31:13,925 --> 01:31:18,043
<i>And superheroes</i>

1111
01:31:18,245 --> 01:31:21,442
<i>Come to feast</i>

1112
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:25,041
<i>To taste the flesh</i>

1113
01:31:25,285 --> 01:31:28,755
<i>Not yet deceased</i>

1114
01:31:29,005 --> 01:31:32,634
<i>And all I know</i>

1115
01:31:32,845 --> 01:31:35,678
<i>Is still the beast</i>

1116
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:39,634
<i>Is feeding</i>

1117
01:32:28,885 --> 01:32:30,841
<i>And crawling</i>

1118
01:32:32,205 --> 01:32:34,639
<i>On the planet's face</i>

1119
01:32:35,445 --> 01:32:38,039
<i>Some insects</i>

1120
01:32:38,885 --> 01:32:41,638
<i>Called the human race</i>

1121
01:32:43,525 --> 01:32:45,834
<i>Lost in time</i>

1122
01:32:48,525 --> 01:32:51,039
