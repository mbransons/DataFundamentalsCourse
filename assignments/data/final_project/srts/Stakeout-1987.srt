1
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Shit.

2
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,300
- A little late.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

3
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm all out of spares.
Should have been home hours ago.

4
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,900
That's got it.

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,300
Thanks.
See you in a half hour.

6
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Open up.

7
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,100
Get me out of this trap!

8
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Hey, Louie!

9
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,600
- Give my regards to Broadway.
- What'd I tell you about screwing around with my books?

10
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,100
I didn't touch your fag rags,
you understand?

11
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,300
Who the hell else touched them then?
There's only you and me in here.

12
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,200
- Piss off!
- Hey, man, don't fuckin' tell me to piss off.

13
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,400
I just did, asshole.

14
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,900
- Come on.
- Come on, big cowboy.

15
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,600
- We got a problem in 17. Better get down there.
- Hey, Billy. Billy, get him good.

16
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,900
- Come on!
- Get ya down there!

17
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,500
- Kick the shit out of him!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

18
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
Hey! Hey!
What's going on in there?

19
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
Kill the mother!

20
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,700
Do it!

21
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,900
Help!

22
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,900
Oh, God!

23
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Get off!

24
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,500
Die, you fucker!
You son of a bitch!

25
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm coming after you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

26
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,100
You goddam scum!
I'll kill you!

27
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,400
God!

28
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,200
Will you take it easy?

29
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
Put him up here.

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,900
Numbnuts!

31
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Fuck you.

32
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,500
Don't move.

33
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,800
Doc, keep your shoes
in one place, man.

34
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,200
Fuck you too.

35
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,100
Come on.
Get on the table.

36
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Hey. Hey!
Stick, we gotta go!

37
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,900
I want to ask you a question.
Do you think it's humane...

38
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,100
to pump perfectly sane prisoners
full of fiiloxin and thorazine?

39
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,700
Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

40
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,400
All right,
we got three minutes.

41
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,800
Let go.
Let go, man.

42
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Get in the box.
Get in the box!

43
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,900
- Okay. See you next week.
- Right.

44
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,700
- Good night.
- Good night. Thanks.

45
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,400
Are we out?

46
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,300
- We out?
- Yeah.

47
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,300
Yeah?

48
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,800
- Who's this?
- Uh, that's, uh, Maria McGuire.

49
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,000
She came a couple of times
to visit Montgomery.

50
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,600
222 1 Speck Road, Seattle.
Is that address current?

51
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,500
I hope so.
That's all we got.

52
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,700
May I, uh...
Thank you.

53
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,700
Hey, you want these eggs hot?
You want me freeze them?
Come on. Pick them up. Thank you.

54
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,700
- See the game last night?
- No, no. I missed it.

55
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,200
Whoa. Don't get your hands
too close to his mouth.

56
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,500
Anything else?

57
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,200
- Yeah, I'd like another
cup of coffee, please.
- Okay.

58
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,000
- And I'd like a side order of sausage.
- You bet.

59
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,800
- How long has he been in there?
- About ten minutes.

60
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,800
- That is disgusting.
- Really?

61
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,300
My God. Do you eat like that
in front of your mother?

62
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,500
- It's an old family custom.
- Well, I'll tell ya, it's not healthy.

63
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,300
You gotta take your time.
Do you have any idea what that does to your digestive system?

64
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,700
No, but I'm afraid
you're gonna tell me.

65
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,600
You've got to savour
the qualities of the cuisine.

66
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,600
First the smell...
Oh, for Christ's sake...

67
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,300
There he is. Come on. Let's go.
Pay the cheque.

68
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,700
Come on. Let's get the forklift up here.
Come on. Let's go.

69
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,300
There he is.

70
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,400
All right, he's not here.
You check upstairs. I'll take the docks.

71
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Oh, no, no. I picked up the cheque.
You take the fiish.

72
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, shit.

73
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,200
You're under arrest!
You have the right to remain silent.

74
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,200
Oh, shit!

75
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh, shit!

76
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,000
Bill!

77
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,500
Bill!

78
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,600
Stop! Police!

79
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,900
Bill!

80
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,800
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry. My fault.

81
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,700
Sorry. Oh, God.

82
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,100
What do you think you're doin'?

83
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,200
- Hey!
- Freeze!

84
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,800
Lace your fingers above your head
and turn around towards me real slow.

85
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,500
Now you're under arrest.

86
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,500
Get back!

87
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,000
Chris!

88
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,900
Oh, God, I hate this part.

89
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,200
I'm on fire

90
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,900
Desire

91
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,800
- Took you long enough.
- It's my one desire

92
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,900
- Desire to win
- Free air, man. Free air.

93
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,700
- I'm gonna say it again, say it again
- You don't know what this means.
- It's my one

94
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,400
- You have no idea.
- Yeah. Let's move.
- Desire

95
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Hi, Bernie.
I'd like some prints.

96
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,400
And there's some blood on the blade.
I'd like to have it typed.
Thank you very much.

97
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,100
What is that smell?
Chris?

98
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, looks like somebody's
been in a fight, Jack.

99
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,400
What? Nobody in cuffs here?
That must mean something.

100
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,300
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait
a minute. I think that means that, uh...

101
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
somebody got their ass kicked.

102
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,100
Complaints.
I'm Bernie.

103
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,900
- Okay.
- God, you stink.

104
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,700
Hey, guys. Captain wants to
see you in his office ASAP.

105
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,700
ASAP? I'd like to take a shower frst.
What do you say?

106
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,600
- Please.
- I wish you would.

107
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,400
But by the sound of his voice,
I think he'll see you as is.

108
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,900
Go ahead! Get out!

109
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Uh, wait a minute, chuckles.

110
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,300
- Captain wants to see you too.
- What'd you do now?

111
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,100
What the hell happened to you?
Looks like you got your ass kicked?

112
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,000
No, no, don't sit there, no.
Shut the door.

113
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Gentlemen, this is Agent Thomas Lusk
from the regional FBI headquarters.

114
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
- Detective Bill Reimers.
- Hey, Billy.

115
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,600
- There's, uh, Chris Lecce over there. Uh, Phil Coldshank.
- Pleasure, sir.

116
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,300
- And, uh, Jack Pismo.
- Right on.

117
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,200
"Right on."
He said, "Right on."

118
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,400
Now, the FBI has requested some help
over the next couple of weeks.

119
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,800
So for now,
your cases have been reassigned.

120
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,300
- Whoa, whoa, reassigned?
- Wait a minute. Bill and I are close
to breaking this thing... A forklift, wasn't it?

121
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,600
From now on,
you're working full-time on this.

122
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
- Kleenex, please.
- In the drawer there.

123
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,000
Mr, uh, Lusk
is in charge of this operation,
so I'll let him do the talking.

124
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,600
Yeah, I-I don't know if
you're familiar with Montgomery,
but, uh, just in case you're not.

125
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,000
Two years ago he killed
one of our agents.

126
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,300
He should have had the chair,
but he had a sharp attorney...

127
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,000
and the local police were a little too
zealous in their pursuit of evidence.

128
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,400
- A plea bargain kept him from frying.
- Yo! Sorry.

129
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Just busted out of Stonehurst,
didn't he? Killed a guard?

130
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,400
Yeah, he and his cousin
crossed into Wyoming, ditched
their truck and had a car waiting.

131
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,800
- If he's in Wyoming, why are you here?
- Well, we think he'll head for Mexico, but he has friends here.

132
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,500
So we're setting up
a half a dozen stake-outs.

133
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Now, uh, we'll handle
the important ones, but, uh, since we're a little short on help...

134
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,700
uh, your men will take the others.

135
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,300
- Of course.
- Who we watching?

136
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,300
Oh, he has an old girlfriend here. He
hasn't seen her for a year and a half.

137
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Her name is Maria McGuire.
Now, you'll be watching her house...

138
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,800
and the Second Precinct will take her
at the restaurant where she works.

139
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,500
Here are the keys
to the apartment we rented across
the street from where she lives.

140
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,200
Now, we're gonna have
to move on this one quick.

141
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,700
I... I know it's short notice,
but this is real bad people we're after.

142
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,400
- Do we, uh, get a bug?
- Hopefully within 24 hours.

143
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,200
Uh, just one other thing.

144
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,900
If you spot Montgomery, report it.
Nothing more.

145
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,900
Remember,
this is an FBI operation.

146
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,100
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

147
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,100
Excuse me, Captain.
There's something a little ripe here.
Let me... Let me ask you a question.

148
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,000
What you're asking is that
you'd like us to sit on our butts...

149
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,200
on some low-priority shit detail...

150
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,100
on the off chance that we're gonna run
across some "bad people."

151
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,600
And then what are we supposed to do?
We're supposed to give you a jingle...

152
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,400
so that you can make the arrest
and get the keys to the city?

153
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,900
Excuse me, Captain. I'm sorry.
I don't like to sound negative,
but this is bullshit.

154
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,300
I'm a cop.
You understand me?

155
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,300
I'm not a security guard.

156
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
I see some "bad people"...

157
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,300
I'm gonna be a little too busy
to, uh, make a phone call.

158
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,300
Hope the attitude
doesn't affect the performance.

159
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,900
- Would you like to see
how this attitude...
- Are you through, Mr Lecce?

160
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,700
We'll call.

161
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,500
- What an asshole.
- Definitely.

162
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,000
Hey! Hey! I don't want to hear
that kind of crap.

163
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,700
And I don't want to hear that
someone else heard it either, got it?

164
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Now, this is a 24-hour surveillance.
Jack and Phil will take the day shift.

165
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,900
- Chris and Bill the nights.
Same routine as last time.
- Aw, Jesus.

166
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
- Something bothering you, Mr. Coldshank?
- No, no.

167
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,600
Don't bullshit me.
What's on your so-called mind?

168
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,300
Well, if it's all the same to you, sir,
uh, I'd just as soon not be on a stake-out with them again.

169
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,600
- Hear, hear, sir.
- Why?

170
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,200
- Why?
- Yeah. Why?

171
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,500
- Chris and Bill are slobs, sir. No, no. No, no, no.
- The worst. The worst.

172
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,100
The last stake-out that Jack and I
were on with them, they never once
cleaned up after themselves.

173
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,000
- I mean, look at them. Smell them.
- Lick my left one, buddy.

174
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
- You left cigar butts all over the place.
- Oh, please.

175
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,200
- You guys never once changed the toilet paper.
- What, you don't wipe yourself? You are disgusting.

176
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,800
- You are fiilth.
- Hey, what about his dog?

177
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,200
- He let his dog piss all over the carpet.
- Hey, that's a goddam lie!

178
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,700
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Don't blame it on the dog. Phil did all the pissing.

179
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,300
- How'd you like me to piss on you?
- Sit down! You see this? Sit down!

180
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,000
- Think I broke my zipper.
- That's enough.

181
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,200
Now, this is not an invitation
to a prom, boys.

182
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't give a shit
if you don't like the date.

183
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,700
Now, you gentlemen are going to
watch this broad until the fat lady
sings or I say different.

184
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,500
And if you fuck this up,
I'm gonna take your nuts...

185
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,400
and tie 'em in a knot
and run 'em through my shredder.

186
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,400
- Captain?
- Yeah?

187
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,000
- Phil doesn't have any nuts, sir.
- Get out. Get out. Get out.

188
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,400
Downwind, please. Please.

189
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,600
All right, that's hers.

190
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,100
And we're there.

191
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Home, sweet home.

192
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,800
I don't know. I just hope
the place has got some heat.

193
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,300
- Carol's okay with all this, isn't she?
- Yeah.

194
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,000
Bonnie's gonna kill me if she ever fiinds out we're gonna
be here for a couple of weeks.

195
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,000
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

196
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,800
Oh, God.

197
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,000
Lucy!
You got some explaining to do.

198
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,700
Very attractive. Yeah.
I think Jason lives here.

199
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,900
- What a nightmare.
- Really.

200
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,300
What the hell did we do
to deserve this?

201
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,100
I think it was that stripper
we sent to the captain on his birthday.

202
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,900
I told you we should have
sent the woman.

203
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,900
Yeah, I think you're right.
I screwed up.

204
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,500
- Hello?
- Hello, baby.

205
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,800
- Hi. Where are you?
- Well, right now, I am freezing my butt off...

206
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,900
staring through a telescope
at a house on Speck Road.

207
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,100
Didn't anyone ever tell you
that's against the law?

208
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
- Yeah, right.
- No personal calls, no personal calls.

209
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,500
Chris and I got a stake-out,
the night shift.

210
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,200
That does it. I'm crossing
the captain off the Christmas list.

211
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,300
Yeah.

212
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,400
- Uh, Chris says hi.
- That's nice.

213
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,300
- So how long is this one supposed to take?
- Couple of weeks.

214
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,100
A couple of weeks? Jeffrey will be
full grown next time you see him.

215
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,300
Yeah, I know.
I hope he remembers me.

216
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,000
All right, listen, I gotta go, okay?
All right, I love you.

217
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,700
- I love you too.
- Be good. Bye.

218
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,000
Bye-bye.

219
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,900
Pizza.

220
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,500
I think we're in luck.

221
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,300
We got every room covered,
except the bathroom.

222
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,800
- Hey, you know, maybe you should call Bonnie.
- She'll only yell. I'm not in the mood.

223
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,500
- Well, I can call her. You want me to call?
- No, no, no. That's okay. I-I can call her.

224
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,400
I can take care of my own love life,
thank you very much. Get away. Get away.

225
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,200
She's probably in bed
with some other guy.

226
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
- Poor bastard.
- Poor bastard.

227
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,800
- So, who we watching anyway?
- Uh, Miss Maria Guadalupe...

228
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,600
- Guadalupe.
- McGuire.

229
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,700
Irish-Mexican. A waitress going to night
school, but apparently not this quarter.

230
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,900
She drives a 1 980 Volkswagen.
Lives alone.

231
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,900
- Nothing.
- Long, brown hair. Brown eyes.

232
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,500
- Five-foot-six. Too tall.
- Too tall. For us anyway.

233
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,500
Oh, and the moment
we've all been waiting for...

234
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,300
31 3 pounds.

235
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,500
31 3 pounds?
Let me see that.

236
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,500
- I would imagine that's fully clothed.
- Oh, my God!

237
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,200
Oh, she could be the house.
This is disgusting.

238
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,000
I hate this job.

239
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,300
- "They're dustin' off the hot seat for me."
- On the Waterfront.

240
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,900
- Who said it?
- Um, Lee J. Cobb.

241
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,900
All right, uh, 1 6th president
of the United States?

242
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,200
- Uh, I don't know.
- I'll give you a hint.

243
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,400
- Abe Lincoln.
- Right, right.

244
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,600
Okay, okay, what movie?
What movie? Um...

245
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,300
"Well, this was not
a boating accident."

246
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
- I don't know.
- Oh, you're hopeless.

247
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,300
- Fifteenth president of the United States?
- Um, I don't know. Fillmore?

248
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Buchanan.
Give me another one.

249
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,200
- 1 980 Volkswagen, right?
- Right.

250
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,800
The rock's in the sock.
We got some movement, buddy.

251
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,500
This is Guadalupe?

252
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,800
Turn around.

253
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,300
I think she's gone on a diet.

254
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,900
- Are you gonna shoot pictures or draw some from memory?
- Right, right, right, right, right, right.

255
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,300
Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.
My fault. There you go. There you go.

256
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,100
God, she's cute.

257
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,000
- It's 2:30.
- Better make some notes.

258
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,900
She's, uh, walking into the kitchen.

259
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,100
- Now she's walking across the room.
- Where's she goin'?

260
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,500
Looks to be the bedroom.

261
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,800
- What's she doin'?
- Uh, looks like, uh...

262
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,300
Like what?

263
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,300
Like she's undressing.

264
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,700
My God!

265
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,100
Oh, wow. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

266
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,600
- No, no, no.
- No! No! No! No! No!

267
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,900
- "To protect and to serve."
- Oh, oh, oh, I love my job so much.

268
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,700
Jack, Jack.
Winston, take a break.

269
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,100
- Good dog. You like that?
- What? You teach him that?

270
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,500
- That's good. That's good.
- Yesterday. Yesterday. Yeah.

271
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,400
Oh, sh...
Will you stop that?

272
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,000
Such a kid sometimes.

273
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,200
Oh, yeah. Finally.

274
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,500
She came in at 2:30 in the morning.
She hasn't been up since. Goodbye.

275
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,600
Just replace what you steal,
all right?

276
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,700
What a dump.

277
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,100
- Looks like your place, huh, Phil?
- Funny.

278
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,600
- Watch Winston, will ya? I'm gonna go take a break.
- All right.

279
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,900
- It's started.
- Cute.

280
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Very cute! Amateurs.

281
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,200
Are you kidding me?

282
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,400
Are you kidding me?

283
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,800
- Yeah?
- So, the answer to the quiz...

284
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,400
why didn't Bonnie answer the phone
is that she's moved out.

285
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
Do you know what time it is?

286
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,800
Yeah, I know what time it is. What do
you want to do, go back to sleep?

287
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,700
I already tried that.
It's too goddam light.

288
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,700
Well, then pull the shades.

289
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,000
I can't.
She took 'em.

290
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,100
She took the shades?

291
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,400
She paid for 'em.

292
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,100
Sorry I didn't get the phone.

293
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,000
All right, what do you want me to do?
Let you go back to sleep?

294
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,200
Um, no, no.

295
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Look, there's nothing you can
do about it right now anyway.

296
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,200
- Did you crack the seal yet?
- Nope.

297
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,700
- Well, then, put it back.
- Okay, Dad.

298
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,800
Oh, oh, good news.
We, uh... We get the phone bug tonight.

299
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,600
Yippee.
Kiss Carol for me.

300
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,000
Lower. Goodbye.

301
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,700
- How's Chris?
- Okay.

302
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,700
- And how are you?
- I'm tired.

303
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,400
- Tired?
- Hmm. Not that tired.

304
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,500
I was lookin' over your shoulder

305
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,400
You were next to me, oh

306
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,900
You ever think about
what happens after you die?

307
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,900
After I die? Yeah.

308
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,400
You know what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna be reincarnated...

309
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,200
as a judge.

310
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,400
All right, forget it.
Bad topic.

311
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,400
So, I want to get paid, right?
Figure she still has your money?

312
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,200
- Oh, I know she's still got my money.
- How do you know? You haven't seen her in a year and a half.

313
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,700
Because she doesn't even know
she's got it.

314
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,900
Look, no one knows you more than me…

315
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,900
… over to Peter's. I'm sure he'll
have some money for bail or something.

316
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,800
I-I'm gonna come over to your house now,
okay? I just... No, Mom.

317
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,600
Mom, I'm hanging up right now,
all right? Goodbye.

318
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,900
We were born to love

319
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,400
- Operator.
- Operator. Yeah. Can you give me, uh, Seattle...

320
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,700
I mean, um, area code 206?

321
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,400
- Yeah, what?
- Don't you ever say hello?

322
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,900
- You ready?
- I'm ready when you are, C.B.

323
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,300
Okay, let her answer
before you cut 'em.

324
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,200
I... I don't know.

325
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,600
- What did you do?
- Yeah? What is it?

326
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,300
- Como esta, Maria?
- Hello?

327
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,600
- Now you're a stranger to me
- Guess who this is.

328
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,800
Hello? Hello? Hello?

329
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,900
Hello?

330
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,000
Hi. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I'm from the phone company.

331
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,100
Apparently there's a line problem
in the neighborhood.

332
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,600
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Isn't there something wrong with your phone?

333
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,500
Yeah, my phone's dead. I just
can't believe you're already here.

334
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:45,200
Oh, well, we got a lot of calls,
you know. Whole neighborhood’s down.

335
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,300
Well, um, you know, it's really
not a very good time for me right now. I have to be going.

336
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,900
I understand, I understand. I-It would
only take a couple of minutes.

337
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,900
- But if it would be a lot easier, I guess we could come back next week.
- Uh, wait a minute.

338
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,800
I'll bet if I don't have it
fiixed now, it'll be another couple of weeks or something?

339
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,100
- No! No, no. Five days max.
- Five days?

340
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,300
Come on, Maria.
How can you resist him?

341
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,600
- Okay, if it doesn't take too long, come on in.
- All right. Be out of your way in just a second.

342
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,500
- Bingo.
- There we go.

343
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,200
Not bad for an old fart.

344
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,800
- There's one phone over there and another in the bedroom.
- Okeydokey.

345
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,800
- Be out of your way as fast as I can.
- Okay.

346
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Hi, sailor.

347
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,800
She's in the bedroom tidying up,
trying to make a good impression.

348
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,600
Oops, don't look under the bed.

349
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,500
Okay, okay,
now she's comin'back.

350
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,200
Okay, all checked out here.

351
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,500
- Want to show me the next one?
- Sure.

352
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,100
Hi. And now a word
from our sponsors.

353
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,900
She's, uh, in the kitchen,
just in case you were wondering.

354
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,100
What's that?

355
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,600
Now is no time to be pausing
for the news, Chris.

356
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,100
W-What are you doin'?
Where you goin'?

357
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Chris, she is in the house.
Stop screwing around, for Christ's sake.

358
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,300
If you blow this
and we get busted...

359
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,100
God damn it, Chris. Come on.
Stop messing around.

360
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,000
Chris, she...
She's right there, for Christ's sake.

361
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,900
Chris. Chris, she's comin'.
Chris, she's comin'. She's comin'!

362
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,900
Chris, God damn it!
Jesus Christ!

363
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,000
Look, I really can't wait any more.
Uh, I'm sorry.

364
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,500
- Problem?
- Uh, my...

365
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,500
My brother is in a lot
of trouble right now. He's down
with the police at the station.

366
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,500
And there's bail
I have to take care of and I...

367
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,400
- Something serious?
- Yeah, I think it is.

368
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Could you come back
tomorrow maybe or...

369
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,300
- I'm done.
- It's fixed?

370
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,800
Well, the problem isn't in the phone.
I think it's out on the pole.

371
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,800
- I'm gonna have to check outside.
- Oh.

372
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,600
Well, thanks a lot.

373
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,000
I'm in love, Bill.

374
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,200
I'm leaving you.
It happens to one out of every six men.

375
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,600
I have to face up
to my heterosexuality.

376
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,700
But don't worry.
You'll be well provided for.

377
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,900
What the hell were you doin'?

378
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,500
What do you mean,
what was I doin'? I was putting
in a bug, for crying out loud.

379
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,500
Oh, really? Is that what that was? Huh?
Well, I don't call goin' through that
woman's drawers puttin' in a goddam bug.

380
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,200
Oh, calm down.
Don't blow a bowel, okay?

381
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,300
For crying out loud.
I thought I saw something...

382
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,200
in her bureau that would tell us whether
or not she talked to Montgomery.

383
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,200
Yeah, she's gone.

384
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,200
Give me the flashlight. I'm gonna
go back in there and check it out.

385
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,600
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no, no.

386
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,400
- No?
- No! Chris, this is the feds' party.

387
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,300
I am not gonna get my ass canned
for illegal procedure.

388
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,400
"This is the feds' party.
I'm not gonna get my ass canned
for illegal procedure."

389
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,300
Give me the goddam flashlight!
And nothing's gonna happen to you.

390
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,900
The worst thing that they could
do to you is that they could
suspend you for, what, three years?

391
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,300
Oh, that's great.

392
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,100
I'm kidding! Jesus, man,
nobody knows when I'm kidding.

393
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,700
I'm only making a little joke,
a little humor.

394
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,700
What a boner.

395
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,700
- You there?
- You in?

396
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,200
- I'm in.
- Then hurry up.

397
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,400
Car!

398
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,100
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

399
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,800
You're sorry?
You're making me very nervous.

400
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,500
Oh, I'm making you nervous?
That's a hoot.

401
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,100
Okay, I think I got something
real important here.

402
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,400
A bunch of letters here
all from Montgomery...

403
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,000
and, uh, the last one dated
about four months ago.

404
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,900
"Dear Maria...
First you stop coming to visit me...

405
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,700
and now you won't
even answer my letters.

406
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,100
I understand you're lonely.
I hear you're seeing a couple of guys.

407
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,100
Sometimes I get so mad that I could
wipe out a whole planet...

408
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,800
and enjoy myself doing it."

409
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,700
Now, how could she have dumped
a charmer like him?

410
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,700
All right, take this down.
I think we got something to check out.

411
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,300
He... He apparently has a buddy...

412
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,400
with the initials "B.C."
right here in Seattle.

413
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,700
Seems to work on the docks.

414
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,800
Uh, now he's talking to her
about some furniture...

415
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,600
he bought her for a present.

416
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,900
Does she still have it?

417
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,300
Apparently he got it for her birthday.
It's very important to him.

418
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,000
- Holy shit!
- What?

419
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,200
Get out of the house.
Get out of the fucking house, man.

420
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,300
She's right there.
She's at the stairs!

421
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,200
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, I'm not fucking with you. Get out of the house!

422
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,400
Come on, Chris.

423
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,200
What are you, crazy?

424
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,400
At night

425
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,000
When you turn off all the lights

426
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,900
There's no place that you can hide

427
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,600
No, no
The rhythm is gonna get you

428
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,200
Rhythm is gonna get you
Rhythm is gonna get you

429
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,700
- What is going on in there?
- Rhythm is gonna get you

430
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,400
- Where the hell are you?
- Rhythm is gonna get you

431
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,400
Tonight

432
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,600
Rhythm is gonna get you

433
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,100
Tonight

434
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,400
Jesus!

435
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,400
Sergeant Bernie?
Yeah, this is Chris Lecce.

436
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm fine. Fine. How are you?

437
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,900
Great. I want you to run a make
on a guy named Reynaldo McGuire.

438
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,200
Yeah, find out any priors,
anything at all.

439
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,000
Thanks.

440
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,900
Oh, just enjoying my day off.

441
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,900
Bye.

442
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
Oh, come on.
There is no way, Chris.

443
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,100
- There is no way that one bullet could have done all that damage
and ended up intact.
- No way? No way?

444
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,100
- What does "no way" mean?
- One bullet came from the grassy knoll,the other from the Texas Schoolbook Depository. How naive can you be?

445
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,500
Oh, so you think that the chief justice
of the United States lied, is that right?

446
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,800
That Gerald Ford and all
those other people lied?

447
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,900
- Those bastards.
- What?

448
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Well, they ate everything
and left us a goddam dog turd.

449
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,300
- Earl Warren left us a dog turd?
- No, Phil and Jack.

450
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,600
Why do you care about all this stuff?
You were five years old when it happened.

451
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,400
- Who gives a shit?
- I'm gonna get those guys, man. I don't
know how yet, but I'm gonna get them.

452
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,200
Give me the keys to the car.
I'm gonna go to the supermarket.
What do you want?

453
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,400
- How about some truth and justice?
- What else?

454
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,800
- Doughnuts.
- Why not? We're cops.

455
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,300
- Hi.
- Hi.
- The phone man, right?

456
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,100
- Right, right. How's your phone?
- Still works. You live in the neighborhood?

457
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,200
- No, no, I was in the area working.
- More lines down?

458
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,100
Always.

459
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,200
So you, uh... you satisfied
with the phone system, are you?
You don't need anything else installed?

460
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,500
Any trimline or videophone
or anything at all?

461
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,400
- You really are a phone man, aren't you?
- Why do you say that?

462
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,600
You're still working on another line.
Get it?

463
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,000
- Got it.
- Good.
- Sixteen thirteen.

464
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,400
- Hope your phone breaks real soon.
- Promise you'll fix it if it does?

465
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,400
I promise.

466
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,300
Bye.

467
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,100
Eating in between meals?

468
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,500
"Eating in between meals?"

469
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,000
Wait a minute. Don't go!

470
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,800
Oh, shit.

471
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,100
You wouldn't be headed
in my direction, would you?

472
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,100
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

473
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,300
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, Bill.
- Bill.

474
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,500
- I'm Maria.
- Hi.

475
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,600
Hi. Can I make you a trade?
A cup of coffee for a ride home?

476
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,000
My bike has a stupid flat, and it's
only getting ready to rain, and I...

477
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,300
Well, uh, um...

478
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,500
- Please?
- Yeah, yeah, what the hell.

479
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,900
- Okay, thank you.
- We'll put it in the trunk. Come on.

480
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,200
I don't believe this.

481
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,000
- Yeah.
- Hi.

482
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,800
- I'm gonna be a little late.
- No, no, no, no, take your time.

483
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,600
No, no, I stopped off
for a cup of coffee.

484
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,000
Well, uh, then have two cups.

485
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,800
Nothing going on here.
Just some dull old police work.

486
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:34,500
Great, great. Tell me, uh,
how's that forklift coming?

487
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,900
- I'll be about a half hour.
- Where are my doughnuts, you prick?

488
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,900
Maybe more.

489
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
You really are a nice guy,
aren't you?

490
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,700
- Don't say that!
- Why? You are.

491
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,900
You gave me a ride home.
You're unpacking my groceries.

492
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,900
You fixed my phone.
You're nice.

493
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I know, I know, I know.
I'm nice. I'm nice. I hate that.

494
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,600
It's a curse.

495
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,200
It's like "medium".

496
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,400
I always wanted to be bad.

497
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,300
Uh, these go in the sack.

498
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,700
You think bad is good?

499
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,200
Well, yeah. I always wanted
a little bad, you know?

500
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,300
I thought it would make
my nice better.

501
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,300
Let me tell you something.
Bad isn't all it's cracked up to be.

502
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,600
Bad is bad, and I think right now
I'd settle for a little nice.

503
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,700
I think.

504
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,200
What are we talking about?

505
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,700
Dinner.

506
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,700
Do you like Mexican food?

507
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,300
I made this mean camarones veracruzanos.
You like spicy?

508
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,500
I love spicy.

509
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,300
Good. Well, then, you're gonna
want to marry me after this.

510
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,300
Oh, Chris.

511
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,700
For crying out loud.

512
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,300
Oh, yeah.

513
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,300
We could be so hot together

514
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,300
Hot together

515
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,500
We could be so hot together

516
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,200
Together

517
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,900
- Aw, this is ridiculous.
- We happened to be at the same party

518
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,200
- We left it up to chance
- I'm gonna kill him.

519
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,800
I was born on the Day of the Dead,
see, and it's a very big deal
in Latino cultures.

520
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:03,300
They want it to make fun of death and
to take it seriously at the same time.

521
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
So every year
as long as I can remember...

522
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,300
someone in my family's always given me
some kind of skeleton on my birthday.

523
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,200
And now I've got this full graveyard.

524
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,500
We could be so hot
Hot together

525
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,100
Got a big family?

526
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,900
My younger brother still lives
at home with my mom except this week...

527
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,400
and I've got a ton of relatives
in Veracruz.

528
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,300
About your brother... I, uh...
I happen to know a couple of cops.

529
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,700
I could ask around, you know,
find out what's going on.

530
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,500
- You think they'd tell you?
- Yeah, if they want
their phones to work.

531
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:42,100
Oh, that would be nice. Oh, God.
I'm sorry. There's that word again.

532
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,200
God, I like your smile.

533
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,200
Excuse me.
I must be kind of drunk.

534
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,600
- Maria, let me ask you something.
- What, Mr. Bill?

535
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,600
How come you know so much
about what's bad?

536
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,000
Well...

537
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,500
there was this man once,
and he was violent and crazy...

538
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,200
and dangerous, and I...

539
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,800
I was insane.

540
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,800
I was insane because
I was with him for a while.

541
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,000
It's all over now.

542
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,000
Did you love him?

543
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,700
I was crazy, I think.

544
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,800
- Where is he now?
- Why do you ask?

545
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,100
Why do you think?

546
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:59,200
- I think I have to go.
- Yeah, me too. I've got the late shift.

547
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,500
No, no, no, leave them.
I'll do them in a couple of years.

548
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,200
You want to know what
the best thing you said tonight was?

549
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,300
What?

550
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,000
- That you liked my smile.
- Oh.

551
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,600
I know, I know, I know.
I'm nice. I know.

552
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,200
I'm not that nice.

553
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,900
Honey, I'm home.

554
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,900
I bumped into her
at the goddam store.

555
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,300
What was I supposed to do,
pretend that I'd never seen her before?

556
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:51,100
Anyway, we're supposed to be watching
the house, right? So I was watching the house from the inside.

557
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,500
Nothing. Here are your doughnuts.
Here. I didn't eat one of them.

558
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,700
There's a glaze on it and everything.
I got you some Pringles and some Oreos.

559
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,000
You, uh, gonna get together
with her again?

560
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,100
- Maybe go to see a movie maybe?
- Oh, give me a break. Come on. Hey, she made me some dinner.

561
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,500
- That was it.
- Nothing more?

562
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,100
Nothing more.

563
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,500
Okay, Mr Liar.

564
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,700
Sergeant Bernie called,
said that Reynaldo McGuire...

565
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,800
was arrested on the 1 7th
for a GTA.

566
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,000
Wouldn't just happen to be
any relation, would it?

567
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,200
Give me a break, will you?
She told me her brother was in jail.

568
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,700
I checked it out.
I thought it was a lead.

569
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,000
- A lead?
- Yeah. A lead.

570
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:37,300
Okay. Fine. You tell me you're checking
out a lead, I'm gonna believe you're...

571
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,500
Checking out a lead.

572
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,800
I realize this is a shit detail.

573
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,700
Oh, boy. I mean, can we talk, you know?
Nobody's really gonna care what we do.

574
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,900
- Bottom of the barrel.
- Right.

575
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,800
But I would appreciate that you not
act like a walking hard-on while we're working together.

576
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,000
Excuse me.

577
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,700
Succinctly put.

578
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,900
All the money
in the cash register right now.

579
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,200
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

580
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,700
Reach me up and get me
a hunting knife, would you, please?

581
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,700
Sorry, buddy, we're closed.

582
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,300
- Seventy-two.
- What do we got? What do we got?

583
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,600
- Two seventy-three.
- All right. That's plenty, man.

584
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,700
That's all we need.
All we need is gas money.

585
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,000
- Yeah, it's hardly worth
rubbing people out for.
- What?

586
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,300
Nothing.

587
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,600
What did I do now?

588
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,900
Reynaldo, right?

589
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,600
Ray.

590
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,400
I heard you got yourself
into a little trouble.

591
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,000
You a cop?

592
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,200
- You a criminal?
- No.

593
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,800
This girl's father's got it in for me.

594
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,900
He does, huh?

595
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,700
Why?

596
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,600
He doesn't want me
seeing his daughter.

597
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,700
- She's pretty precious, huh?
- Yeah.

598
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,700
So why'd you hot-wire the car?

599
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,600
We thought it'd be okay.

600
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,000
I was stupid.

601
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,700
It's not very pleasant
being in here, is it?

602
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,500
Why do you care?

603
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,600
I just want to find out what kind
of a guy you are before I get you out.

604
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,200
Get me out. I can't take
another night in this place.

605
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,500
You like to work with your hands?

606
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,000
I got a job here, construction.
Starts Monday morning, 7:30 to 5:00.

607
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,700
Five days a week.
Got to be home every night.

608
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,500
That's the deal.

609
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,700
Every night.

610
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,500
Take it and you're out of here.

611
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,800
Mess with me and you're right back in.
What do you say?

612
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,300
Deal.

613
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,300
Okay.

614
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,400
What rock did they find you under?

615
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,800
Anything I can do to make your stay here more pleasant, buddy,
you just let me know.

616
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,100
- Great.
- Hey, Lecce, I want to talk to you.

617
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,600
- You should be getting some sleep. What are you doing?
- I heard you wanted to talk to me.

618
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah, a couple of cops sitting
on a stake-out in fourth precinct just got caught on a procedure.

619
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,300
Seems they got overanxious,
blew their cover.

620
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,400
I don't want this to happen here.
You pass it on.

621
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,900
- No funny stuff.
- No funny stuff. Okay, got it. Right. Right.

622
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,100
Okay, you got it. You got it.
No funny stuff.

623
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,400
Excuse me!
Bill, how are you?

624
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,600
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- What are you doing here?

625
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:09,000
Well, I just had, uh, a, uh, you know.
No, no, no, what are you doing here?

626
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,600
- I heard you were supposed to be at work.
- Well, I was, but they let me off early so I could see my brother.

627
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:17,200
- You know, they only have
certain hours here, and... Hey, fish man.

628
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,300
One day we dance again, okay?

629
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,100
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- No, no, no. He's just a funny friend.
- Hey, Chris.

630
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,400
Listen, this is a really bad time
to talk to me. Could I...

631
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,200
Could I call you up, give you a call?
I gotta make a couple of calls.

632
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,600
And after I make those calls,
we'll probably, you know, make... call you after.

633
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,500
Come on. Come on.

634
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,400
- Great.
- Hey, fellas. What do you got?

635
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,300
Uh, the usual.
Logged five calls today.

636
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,400
One from Gail, some friend of hers
that just had a fight with her husband.

637
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,500
And one from her mother about
a recipe for some sort of shrimp dish.

638
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,700
Oh, a recipe, huh?
Good, good.

639
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,000
At least my wife
will get something out of this.

640
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,300
- She over there now?
- She been gone a couple of hours.

641
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,900
This recorder took a dump.
You gotta pick up a new one.

642
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,300
- Come on, Winston.
- Good night, gentlemen.

643
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,400
Good night.

644
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,800
Come on.
Let's get the hell out of here.

645
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,100
Winston!
Chris, you son of a bitch!

646
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,300
- Winston!
- This is not funny!

647
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,600
- You are really something, you know that? You keep me young.
- You like that?

648
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,100
- Yeah.
- Listen, the recorder's totally shot, so I gotta go pick up a new one.

649
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,600
- All right.
- Leave it to Phil and Jack, right? How long will you be gone?

650
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,500
- About an hour.
- Okay, I'll see you then.

651
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,800
Jesus, they're immature!

652
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,000
Come on.

653
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:06,800
- How much longer, man?
- Finished. This carburetor sucks.

654
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,600
- It's as useful as a diet crouton.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

655
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:25,000
Think about it
There must be higher love

656
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,900
Really no trick
to this, you know.

657
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,200
You're just gonna call her up
on the phone and tell her that you can't see her any more.

658
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,500
It's really as simple as that.

659
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,600
It's as simple as that.
Not gonna ruin your career.

660
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,800
- Hello?
- Hello.

661
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,600
It's, uh, uh, Bill.

662
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:04,400
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm okay. Look, the reason I called...

663
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,300
Uh, there are some things that
you and I have to get straight here.

664
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,600
- You know, I have very good taste.
- Pardon me?

665
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,400
Yeah, I've got good taste in food,
I've got good taste in music...

666
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,900
but most of all I've got
great taste in men.

667
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,900
I'm not quite sure
what we're talking about.

668
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,100
I'm talking about you.
What you did for my brother Ray,
what you did for me.

669
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,500
Oh, oh, that.

670
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:32,700
"Oh, that". What do you mean,
"Oh, that"? It was a very good thing,
what you and your police friend did.

671
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,500
My brother's out off jail.
He's got a new job.

672
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,000
My mother wants to marry you.
My brother wants to marry you.

673
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,400
Yeah?
What about you?

674
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,300
- Maria?
- Yes?

675
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,400
Uh, wait.
Uh, uh, wait a minute.

676
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,900
- Uh, could you hold on just a second?
- Sure.
- Thank you.

677
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,700
Don't be such a wuss!

678
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:05,300
Look, Maria, there are things
about me that you don't know.

679
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,500
Well, there are things you
don't know about me either.
Isn't that why people go out?

680
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,800
Yeah, yeah, they do. But th-th-there
are things about me that I...

681
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,400
- That I can't tell you.
- Are you in some kind of trouble?

682
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,600
- Kind of.
- With the law?

683
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,200
Uh, in a way.
Look, your food is burning.

684
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,600
- Your-your-your food is, uh...
- Shit!

685
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,300
God!

686
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,600
- How'd you know her food was burning?
- How'd you know my food was burning?

687
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:43,000
- Pardon me?
- My food was burning. How did you know?
You psychic or something?

688
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,600
No, no, I'm not psychic.
I... I heard the sizzling behind you.

689
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,400
Oh. You have pretty good ears.
Yeah.

690
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,800
Look, Maria...

691
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:00,100
I just can't see you for a while.

692
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,800
You... You don't want to see...

693
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,700
Look, this... this really isn't
a very good time right now.

694
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,100
I-I-I have to be at work
in half an hour, so could you
give me your number?

695
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,600
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- My home number?

696
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,700
Yeah. You do have a phone, don't you?

697
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,200
Yeah. Yeah, what do you think?

698
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,800
Of course I got a phone,
but I'm... I'm hardly ever there.

699
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:31,000
- Then I'll call you at the office.
- No, no, no, no, I'm hardly ever there.

700
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:35,900
All right, um, home is better.
555-5050.

701
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,800
Yeah. Okay, okay.

702
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,300
Okay, okay.

703
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,400
- Everything okay?
- Okay.

704
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,300
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Maria.

705
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,800
Hi.

706
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,000
Hi.
What's wrong?

707
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,400
Did I wake you?

708
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:14,100
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

709
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,100
- Where are you?
- I'm at home. Now, you listen to me, fella.

710
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,900
Just because you said you're having
a little bit of trouble doesn't mean I'm gonna let you off the hook.

711
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,200
Holy shit!

712
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,100
- I can't talk now.
- Are you all right?

713
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,900
- I have to call you back.
- What is it? Is it the police?

714
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,800
Hello? Bill?

715
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,700
- Bill.
- Bill.

716
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,100
Fifteen minutes early.
Must be some kind of record.

717
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,400
So, everything okay?
What's up?

718
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,900
- Got a phone call today.
- Oh, yeah? New recipe?

719
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,400
Uh-uh. Guy named Bill.

720
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,300
Hey, let me see. Okay, I'll take
this downtown, check it out.

721
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,500
Uh-uh. We will take this downtown.

722
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,800
Tried to disguise his voice,
but I think it was Montgomery.

723
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:37,100
Nap time's over, boys.
Better keep your eyes open tonight.

724
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,300
- Come on.
- Bill? Come on.

725
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,500
Good night, gentlemen.

726
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,000
Those bastards, man. I smell a rat.
They are up to something.

727
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:50,100
I don't know what it is yet,
but they're up to something.

728
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,700
I'm gonna find out, though.

729
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,900
You know what it is?

730
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,900
Yeah. Yeah, I have
a pretty good idea what it is.

731
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,100
What? What? Tell me.

732
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,500
Son of a bitch!

733
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,900
Christ, I am gonna kill them!

734
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,800
- Just let me in for a minute.
- She's not here. Tony! Get out of the way.

735
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,600
- Cover me! Armed man going into her house!
- What?

736
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,400
- Gail? Oh, Gail?
- Tony, I haven't seen her in a long time.

737
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,800
Gail's here. Gail, where are you?
Shut up, Maria. Every goddam time!

738
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:04,300
- Get your goddam hands off me, you son of a bitch!
- It's not our guy.

739
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,800
- Get out of my house!
- I never thought I'd hit a woman, but... Ow!Jeez, ouch!

740
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,600
Oh, for crying out loud.

741
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,700
Every time something happens,
we end up fucking it up, and she comes over here!

742
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,300
- Stop it!
- Tell me where that... Every time something goes wrong...

743
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,900
- I'm not gonna tell you again. She's not here.
- Anybody home?

744
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,900
Gee, I, uh...
You left the door open.

745
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,800
- Bill!
- Who the fuck are you?

746
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:31,000
I'm a friend of Maria's.
I came over for dinner.

747
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,600
- What's up?
- I'm looking for my wife.

748
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,300
- Where'd you leave her, pal?
- She's here.

749
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,500
- He thinks he can barge right in here.
- She ran out. She's hiding!

750
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,000
- Is she here?
- No. That's what I've been trying to tell him.

751
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,800
I think maybe you made a mistake.
What do you say, pal?

752
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,700
Go to hell!

753
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,900
Let's call the cops.
I want him out of my house! I want you to call the cops.

754
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,600
Why don't I help you look for her?
Huh? What do you say? Hey, Gail! Gail!

755
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,900
Oh, gee, I'm real sorry.

756
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,500
Just relax. Calm down.
Now, there's a chair right behind you.

757
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,900
When I lift you up, you're gonna
put your ass right down in that chair.

758
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
All right? One...

759
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,800
We're doing okay.
We're doing just fiine.

760
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,200
Now, your knee is bad, huh?
That's it. Just relax.

761
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:22,700
We'll get you some ice for the knee,
and we'll get you some aspirin for your head, okay?

762
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,900
- Could we have some aspirin? And some ice.
- Yeah.

763
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,400
We're doing okay.
We're doing fiine.

764
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,700
Now, I don't think it would be
a very good idea for you to talk to Gail right now, because...

765
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,000
you've been drinking, and you say pretty mean
things when you've been drinking, right?

766
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,400
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

767
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,600
- What's your drink?
- Little rye and Coke.

768
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:50,600
Rye and Coke?
That used to be my drink.

769
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:55,000
Give me your hand. Yeah, I used to get these
diamond splinter headaches right between my eyes.

770
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:59,200
Right there. It was murderous.
You ever get those things?

771
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,500
- No.
- No?

772
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,300
Well, I guess it must
have been me, huh?

773
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:09,500
We're doing okay.
We're doing fiine.

774
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,800
- How about some coffee?
- Yeah, coffee's good.

775
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:17,100
Yeah, we'll have some coffee,
we'll calm down, talk about Gail.

776
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,400
- Can we have some coffee please?
- Sure.

777
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
- I'm impressed.
- I was just in the neighborhood.

778
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,200
I'm beginning to like
this neighborhood more and more.

779
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,600
I was a little worried
after that phone call.

780
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:53,100
Yeah, yeah, well,
I was kind of out of it...

781
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,500
but, uh, I guess this
isn't the best time, eh?

782
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,300
Uh-uh. A date's a date.

783
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,100
Oh, look, Maria, I'm...
I'm really involved...

784
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:06,800
There's nothing to fear
Baby, now that you're near me

785
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:11,200
I've never seen anything so clearly

786
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:19,400
- Oh, boy.
- This night was made for one thing only

787
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,800
To come as close as we can come

788
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,800
This night was made
for one thing only

789
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:33,500
It's such a change
Someone nice like you

790
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,600
Oh, boy.

791
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:40,300
I'm in over my head here.

792
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,100
- Stay with me.
- Maria...

793
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,600
You don't want me
to break my phone, do you?

794
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,900
If I do, they'll send
somebody else here.

795
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,900
We've gotta keep rising

796
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,100
And never let go

797
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:03,100
I won't ever let you say goodbye

798
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,500
Oh, Bill.

799
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,200
- Fuck Bill.
- This night was made for one thing only

800
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:14,600
- To come as close as we can come
- So let it begin

801
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,400
This night was made
for one thing only

802
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:21,700
- Never let go
- To come as close as we can come

803
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,700
- Where do we begin
- Begin

804
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,000
- You could just hold me
- Just hold me

805
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:34,100
- Where do we begin.
- Where do we begin.

806
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:38,400
- You could just hold me.
- You could just hold me.

807
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,200
Where do we begin.

808
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,200
God!

809
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,700
I had a bad dream.

810
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,200
Oh, scary monsters.

811
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,700
Where'd they get you?
Here?

812
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,800
Here.

813
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,800
Here?

814
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,500
- What time is it?
- Seven thirty. What...

815
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,800
Jesus Christ!

816
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:37,500
What's wrong?

817
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,900
- It's morning.
- Are you gonna be late for work?

818
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,500
- Uh-huh.
- Could you call and tell them
you'll be a little late, maybe?

819
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,900
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- No?

820
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,900
- Listen, uh, you think you could lend me a hat?
- A hat?

821
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,800
Yeah, yeah, a hat. I got this really bad
skin condition, and it's very dangerous
for me to go out in the sun.

822
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,900
- Like a rash?
- Yeah, yeah, like a rash.

823
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,500
- It's... It's... But it's worse.
- Oh. Is this one of the things you don't want to tell me about?

824
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,700
No, no, no, no, it's nothing, really.
It's nothing serious.

825
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,300
I'm not sure it's your colour.

826
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,300
Seems perfectly fiine.

827
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,700
- Much better.
- Thank you.

828
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

829
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:41,900
I really got you
thinking now, don't I?

830
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

831
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,700
- Could I borrow this?
- It's yours.

832
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,200
What are you waving at, huh?
Huh? Who you waving at?

833
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,300
Hey, Jack. Jack! This may be him.
Get on that horn, eh?

834
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,800
- Oh, right.
- Get on that horn.

835
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,500
Lynn, Jack Pismo,
Speck Road stake-out.

836
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,600
We have a man
running from the house.

837
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,700
Caucasian, about five-ten.

838
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,500
Jeans, jacket, pink hat,
and he's heading south.

839
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,300
Caucasian, five-ten, jeans,
jacket, pink hat?

840
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,300
Yeah, pink hat and a shawl.
He's heading south.

841
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,500
- Excuse me. My fault. My fault. Sorry.
- What are you doing?

842
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,700
No, no, back it up!

843
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,300
Asshole.

844
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,500
Get away from me!
Get down!

845
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,500
Get away from me!
Down!

846
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,800
Come on, come on!
Get in!

847
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,300
Did we, uh, practice safe sex?

848
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,500
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Maria.

849
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,600
- Hi. Hi. What's wrong?
- Did I wake you?

850
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:08,300
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

851
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,200
- Where are you?
- I'm at home. Now, you listen to me, fella.

852
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,900
Just because you said you're having a little
bit of trouble doesn't mean I'm gonna let you off the hook.

853
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,300
Holy shit!

854
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,400
- I can't talk now.
- Are you all right?

855
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:34,000
- I have to call you back.
- What is it? Is it the police?

856
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,500
Hello? Bill?

857
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:42,900
We also have a videotape of a man
leaving the Speck Road house.

858
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,100
Now, we don't know if
it's the same man that's on the phone...

859
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,300
or if he has any relationship
with Montgomery.

860
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,500
We're not taking any chances.

861
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,400
We also found this.

862
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:09,300
"Bill"? I mean, that's
the last fuckin' straw. You break it...

863
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,500
Good night.

864
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,700
Hey, hey, hey, I'm serious, man.
It ends right here.

865
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,000
Either you break it off,
or you get your ass reassigned...

866
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,000
'cause I'm not
goin' down with you!

867
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:26,000
I busted my ass to make detective
before 30. I'm not gonna
let you fuck that up!

868
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,800
You got that, Chris?

869
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,400
Yeah, I got that.

870
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,400
You used to be a hell
of a cop, man.

871
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,500
Get your shit together.

872
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,300
Ah.

873
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:05,400
Uh-oh, bacon on the left.
Bacon burgers on the left.

874
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:09,400
- Great.
- God damn it!

875
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,400
All right. Get in the back.
Use the shotgun.

876
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,900
- I'm not shootin' at cops!
- Get in the back, man.

877
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,500
How far are you
gonna take this?

878
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,100
Yeah!

879
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,700
Watch this.

880
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,800
Oh, yeah.

881
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,600
Shit!

882
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,100
Ah!Jesus!

883
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,300
Hang on, little buddy.
I'm gonna jam 'em.

884
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,400
- Doin' all right?
- No. Just hang in there.

885
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,700
Oh, fuck. It's over, man.

886
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,800
It's over.

887
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,800
It's never over till it's over.
Keep your head down, man.

888
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:47,900
- Keep your head down!
- Oh, it's gotta stop, man.

889
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,900
Whoa. Whoa!

890
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,700
- Hope this road goes somewhere.
- We're never gonna get out of this!

891
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,900
- What the hell are you doing?
- We're blowin' this pop stand.

892
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,200
- It's over.
- They got Montgomery?

893
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:51,200
Yeah, a couple hours ago.
Couldn't get many details...

894
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,300
but apparently
there was some big shoot-out.

895
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,400
Their car ended up
in the Nisqually River,
and no one came out.

896
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,500
So, we get a pat on the back...

897
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,400
job well done, next case.

898
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,700
You know, you are one
lucky son of a bitch.

899
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,500
- What are you gonna do about her?
- Oh, man, I...

900
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,000
I think I love her.
I really do.

901
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:37,600
Well, I'd hate to think you
risked it all just 'cause you liked her.

902
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,800
Yeah, yeah.

903
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,600
Now comes the hard part.
Say, how do you feel...

904
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,800
about going across the street
and telling her that I'm a cop...

905
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,300
and I'm not a phone man
and I've been lying to her and I've been taking pictures...

906
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:54,500
- and looking at her through telescopes and...
- Uh-uh. No.

907
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,800
Yeah. I didn't think
you'd like that.

908
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:00,700
You know, I always thought
it would be you that screwed up.

909
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:04,200
Well, maybe I'll learn
from your mistakes.

910
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,600
- Probably not.
- Probably not. No.

911
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:09,300
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

912
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,200
The force of the water
against the car...

913
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:17,300
is making it extremely difficult
to pull it from the river.

914
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,000
It is not yet confirmed, but it
is believed that the body...

915
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:24,400
of escaped prisoner Richard "Stick"
Montgomery is still trapped inside.

916
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:28,100
The body of his cousin, Caylor Reese,
was found two miles downriver.

917
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,100
- Normally, police divers would have tried to pull Montgomery free...
- Hi.

918
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,200
but due to the car's
precarious position...

919
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:37,200
and the force of the water,
that has not been possible.

920
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,300
Are you all right?

921
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,000
I know. I know.

922
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
- Maybe we should talk.
- Uh-huh.

923
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,000
You're wanted by the law,
aren't you?

924
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,400
Is that what you think?

925
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:15,100
Well, I heard sirens
this morning after you left.

926
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,900
The police follow you here?

927
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:28,400
I don't think I realized
until just now the size of the hole that I dug for myself.

928
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,000
How much trouble are you in?

929
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,300
You're not gonna like me
very much when I tell you this.

930
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,600
Oh, God. I never should've
let this happen.

931
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,500
But I did.

932
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,300
I want you to know,
before you start hating me...

933
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:52,300
and you will start hating me...
that I've fallen in love with you.

934
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,500
Don't, don't, don't.

935
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,900
Don't interrupt a confession.

936
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,100
I don't work
for the phone company.

937
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:15,000
And my name is not Bill.
It's Chris.

938
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:20,300
- You're a cop?
- I'm a detective.

939
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:26,300
I'm staking out the home
of an ex-girlfriend
of an escaped federal prisoner.

940
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,100
You've been watching me?
From where?

941
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:36,900
Across the street.

942
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,600
And my phones?

943
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,800
Maria.

944
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,500
Listen to me!

945
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,900
In there, huh?

946
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,100
Uh-oh.

947
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,600
Maria.

948
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,200
What do you got there, huh?

949
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,400
Well...

950
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:46,300
You guys are great.

951
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,000
I hope I... I hope
I didn't disappoint you.

952
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,100
Maria. Maria! God damn it!

953
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:06,300
Maria, listen to me!
Hold it a minute! Would you...

954
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,300
- Would you... Listen to me!
- No! Stop!

955
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,400
Hear me! I was doing
my job, God damn it!

956
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:16,200
Now, whether you like it or whether I
like it, it doesn't make any difference.

957
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:21,300
There wasn't any fun in it, and what
happened between you and me was...

958
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:25,200
was not part of it...
it was my mistake.

959
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,400
Maria.

960
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,200
I wanted to tell you.
I just... I couldn't.

961
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,600
You son of a bitch!

962
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,600
Oh, no!

963
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,400
You broke my heart.

964
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,500
They said you were dead. I...

965
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:40,100
Oh!

966
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,400
Oh, Jesus Christ.

967
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,500
I made it.

968
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,600
I made it. It's all right.
I made it.

969
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,800
Maria, will you just
think about it for a minute?

970
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:01,100
- Listen to me.
- Who the fuck is that?

971
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:04,300
- Okay? I couldn't tell you that I was...
- No. Put it down.

972
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,100
- Don't.
- You couldn't tell her you were what?

973
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:17,600
You couldn't tell her
you were what? Who is this guy?

974
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:23,800
You're... Is this the guy?

975
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,700
Is this the reason?

976
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,300
You wanna take a walk in
the other room, pretty please?

977
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,400
Take a fuckin' walk!

978
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,300
Christopher...
Christopher "Lee-chee".

979
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,600
- Lecce.
- Lee-chee.

980
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,500
So, Lee-chee, what are you doin'
botherin' my old lady?

981
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,800
- We had a fight.
- Oh, you had a fight?

982
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:13,300
- That's too bad. What was it about?
- None of your business.

983
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:18,500
Watch it, pal. It is all my business.
Now, what was it about?

984
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,400
She found out I was
violating my parole, okay?

985
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,900
Are you kidding me?

986
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,500
What kind of candy-ass crime
did you commit, Chris?

987
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:40,500
Did you steal some old lady's
handbag, huh? What'd you do?

988
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,800
- Hey, take it easy. Take it easy, pal.
- What did you do?

989
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,900
Don't tell me to take it easy.

990
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:50,100
- What'd you do?
- I rob banks.

991
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,600
You rob banks?

992
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,400
- Could you get me a knife, honey?
- What?

993
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:02,900
Have a seat, Christopher.
Get me a knife.

994
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:15,600
- You do time?
- Year and a half.

995
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:18,400
- Where?
- Walla Walla.

996
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,300
Hand me the knife, honey,
would you, please?

997
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,300
I said, give me the knife.

998
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:43,400
- Do you know who I am?
- No, man, I don't know who you are.

999
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,600
- I don't believe you.
- Oh! Ooh!
- No!

1000
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,900
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1001
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,900
I just wanted to know what
these things were stuffed with.

1002
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,500
They're made of money.
She's safer than the bank, Chris.

1003
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,300
I had some friends at Walla Walla.
You probably know some of'em. You know Cletus Ink?

1004
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,000
- Nope.
- You don't know Cletus Ink?

1005
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,000
- Uh-uh.
- You know Mad Dog Ross?

1006
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,700
- You gotta know Mad Dog.
- No, I don't, but it was a big place.

1007
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,500
You don't know Cletus Ink?
You don't know Mad Dog Ross?

1008
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,400
Who the hell do you know?

1009
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:45,100
Do you know Eddie Gant? Hmm?

1010
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,900
- Yeah. Yeah, I did know Eddie Gant.
- What was he in for?

1011
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,500
He killed a cop.

1012
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,300
Hello?

1013
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,100
Yeah. Guess who this is.

1014
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:08,900
Yeah, that's right. Well,
shut up for a second, will ya?

1015
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,300
I can only say that the reports of
my demise have been greatly exaggerated.

1016
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,800
Well, listen, man, I don't have time
to talk. Where we gonna do this?
We have to do it now.

1017
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:28,200
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.

1018
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,700
Okay. All right. I'll
meet you there in 20 minutes.

1019
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,100
Pack a bag.
We're taking a trip.

1020
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:43,100
- What? What is it?
- There's someone out there.

1021
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,600
- You! Now, get out the front door!
- Just relax, man.

1022
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:50,400
- Get out the front door!
- Just relax! I'm not part of this shit!

1023
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:53,700
Lock the front door
and the back. Get out.

1024
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,900
Get out.

1025
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I will be back.

1026
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,300
Oh. Oh.

1027
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:28,200
Oh, shit!

1028
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,300
Jesus Christ.

1029
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,900
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- I don't know, man.

1030
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,100
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1031
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,200
Get him inside.

1032
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,000
Throw him on the couch.

1033
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Cop. I knew it!

1034
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:07,600
- What the hell are you...
- Shut up, pig!

1035
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:10,500
Hey, back off.

1036
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,200
How did you know
I was here? Hmm?

1037
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:16,200
How did you know I was here?

1038
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,400
You don't answer me. All right.
You say goodbye to your mama.

1039
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:24,300
- Richard, don't!
- He wasn't following you.

1040
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,900
He was following me.

1041
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,700
- What?
- Yeah.

1042
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:32,800
Yeah, I violated my parole, remember?
He's been following me for a week.

1043
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:37,400
I made you on Saturday, asshole.
You don't do your job very well, do you?

1044
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:42,800
Look, I got a car right outside. I can
drive you to wherever you wanna go.

1045
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:45,400
Cuff his hands behind him.

1046
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:48,500
If he gets loose, you die!

1047
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:52,100
You may think serving time
and having a couple cops on your ass
gives me a reason to trust you.

1048
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:57,000
Well, let me tell you something, pal.
The last people in the world
I trust are ex-cons. Let's move.

1049
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:08,200
So, uh, wh-wha... what's
the deal with this guy?

1050
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:12,900
I mean, really, what is
the deal with this guy? Huh?

1051
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,200
I don't even know who he is.

1052
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,000
Isn't love great, Chris?

1053
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,600
One minute you're a god.
Next minute you're a scum-suckin' pig.

1054
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:34,600
I'm leavin' the country, baby.
You're goin' with me.

1055
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,700
You goin' to Canada?

1056
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,100
Are you a travel agent?
Drive, sucker.

1057
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,400
Get out.

1058
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:22,300
Sit down. Sit down.

1059
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,600
- Hey...
- Shut up!

1060
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:33,000
Maria, come here. I gotta talk
to this guy for about, uh, fiive minutes.

1061
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:35,500
Could... Could you take a walk
and just come back in fiive minutes?

1062
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,100
What for?

1063
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,400
-Just take a walk, would ya?
- You're going to kill them, aren't you?

1064
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,700
Well, I'm not gonna
make love to them.

1065
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,500
You expect me to go with you
after you do this?

1066
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:52,800
What do you want me to do?
Let them go? Do I look stupid?

1067
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,300
If I let them go, I am dead.

1068
01:43:56,300 --> 01:44:01,000
How long do you think it's gonna take
for them to pick me up if I let them go?

1069
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:04,200
Is that what you want?
They're gonna die, not me.

1070
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:07,200
- Why? What do you...
- Why? Because that guy's a cop!

1071
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:11,600
And that guy has been inside you.
Now get outta my way.

1072
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,500
- No.
- Maria.

1073
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:21,900
You're not gonna stop me.

1074
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,300
Maria, get outta my way.
Come here.

1075
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,700
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Maria. Get out!

1076
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,300
No! Richard! No! No!
Richard! Richard! Ah!

1077
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:42,600
- Don't you ever hit me! You understand?
- Oh, God!

1078
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:48,700
Come on, man.
We gotta get outta here!

1079
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:55,700
- Jesus Christ! That guy's a cop!
- I know he's a cop.

1080
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:58,800
- His hands are cuffed.
- Not him. The other one.

1081
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:34,100
Hey, where you goin'? Hey!
Wait for me, you bastard!

1082
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,400
- No! No!
- You're drivin' me to the border!
Get up the stairs!

1083
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,500
Get up the stairs.

1084
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,900
You wanna shoot? Huh?

1085
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,100
Go ahead, pal!
What's the matter? You chicken?

1086
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,800
Whoa!

1087
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:18,900
I hope you believe
in reincarnation, sucker!

1088
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:29,000
Get away!

1089
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:24,000
I was supposed to give you a call,
wasn't I? I forgot.

1090
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:29,200
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Not if you don't keep out of the way.

1091
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:32,200
- Hey, man. How ya doin'? Okay?
- Hi.

1092
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,400
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm just a little tired.

1093
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:37,900
A little tired, huh? Well, listen.
You go home, you get plenty of rest.

1094
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,900
'Cause when I get better,
I'm gonna break both your legs.

1095
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,200
- You're dust, Lecce. You hear me? Dust.
- Yeah. I'll see ya.

1096
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:47,000
- Not only did you hit me once,
but twice.
- I'll see ya. Hey.

1097
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:49,200
- This is one of the worst nights of my life.
- What do you want?

1098
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:51,700
- Well, I just wanna know if she's gonna be okay.
- She's okay.

1099
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,400
- Okay.
- Lusk thinks you got something
going on with that girl.

1100
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,300
- He wants an investigation.
- What are you talkin' about?

1101
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,700
Well, he said you could
be in a lot of trouble.

1102
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,500
Hell, I told him
you're always in trouble.

1103
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:21,000
You saved my life.

1104
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:23,900
You know what that means,
don't you?

1105
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,200
No. What?

1106
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,200
You belong to me now.

1107
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,100
- What is your name, really?
- It's Chris.

1108
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,200
- Chris? I love you, Chris.
- Really. I swear to God.

1109
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:01,800
I say I love you
I hold you near me

1110
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:04,400
- I love you too.
- You say I scare you

1111
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,500
Well, that's your fear

1112
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:11,200
- I know the message my heart is sending
- I'll take you home.
- Okay.

1113
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:15,500
- If you don't read it you'll keep on missing
- What a boner!

1114
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:19,100
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1115
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:28,400
Is it love, is it
Is it love

1116
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:35,400
The broken record
goes 'round and 'round

1117
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:39,500
Within a circle
Without a sound

1118
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:43,600
I'm underwater
In overdrive

1119
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:47,200
You hide in laughter
what's on your mind

1120
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:53,100
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1121
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:55,400
Why don't you tell me

1122
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:02,500
Is it love, is it
Is it love, oh

1123
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:09,600
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1124
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:11,700
Why can't you tell me

1125
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:17,100
Is it love
Is it really love

1126
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:59,200
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1127
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,700
Why can't you tell me

1128
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:06,700
Is it love, is it
Is it love

1129
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:13,900
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1130
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,800
Hey, girl, well, I got to know
Is it really, really love

1131
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:22,500
Is it love
Is it really love

1132
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:26,200
Hey-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh

1133
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:31,200
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1134
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:34,600
Why don't you tell me

1135
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:39,700
Is it love
Is it really love

1136
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:47,000
Is it love
Is it love we're after

1137
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:52,400
Everybody lookin' for the time
Thinkin' love will come around and hope we'll find it

1138
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:55,300
Is it love
Is it really love

1139
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:59,500
Oh-Oh, baby, is it love
