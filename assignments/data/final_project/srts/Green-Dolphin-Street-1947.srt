1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,614


2
00:00:11,864 --> 00:00:14,364


3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,074


4
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,187
A hundred years ago - the island of
St. Pierre in the English Channel.

5
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:48,502
This came for you,
Reverend Mother.

6
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:52,251
Thank you.

7
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:58,940
Reverend Mother and Friend.

8
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:01,746
A bad penny always turns up and -

9
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:03,617
- this useless aging one
returns home today.

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,066
If my beloved Sophie is still living
after all this time -

11
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:10,192
- please tell her I have not
forgotten the great love we -

12
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:12,316
He needn't wait.

13
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,132
- respectfully, a voice from the past
Edmond Ozanne

14
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:20,708
Thank you, you needn't wait.

15
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:26,183
Open the gate, sister Angelique.

16
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:27,462
Forgive me, Reverend Mother -

17
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:30,248
If you're going to St. Pierre,
the tide is due to rise.

18
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,054
And if you should get caught!

19
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:32,559
Child!

20
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:37,056
The matter of this letter may ruin the
happiness of a family we all respect!

21
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:40,199
Of course, I could stay here
and pray to the good Lord.

22
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:42,190
Yes, you could that, Reverend Mother!

23
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:44,229
You're not so young any more!

24
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:47,135
But I think the good Lord would
prefer me to do something about it!

25
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:51,075
And my age is my
own business.

26
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:53,674
And you could come with me!

27
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:33,526
Sophie.

28
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:35,750
Reverend Mother, how nice to see you!

29
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:36,385
Do sit down!

30
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:37,175
No, no, I haven't time for that.

31
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,252
- But I haven't seen you for years!
- Sophie!

32
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,232
Is something wrong?

33
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:45,138
Edmond Ozanne,
has returned to St Pierre.

34
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:50,671
Edmond!

35
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:55,971
Naturally,

36
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:57,561
he doesn't know you'r Mrs. Patourel.

37
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:58,499
And he wants to see you!

38
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:04,140
There is my answer!

39
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:05,986
My two daughters.

40
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,863
You don't mention Octavius?
Don't you love him?

41
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:11,105
Octavius, of course!

42
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:13,350
He is my husband.

43
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,394
You didn't love him when your parents
forced the marriage on you.

44
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:17,350
Octavius is kind and devoted!

45
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:21,118
He has been a loving father to his children,
he has carried on the family business beautifully!

46
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,503
But Edmond is still the
man you love!

47
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,206
And always will.

48
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,208
My parents forbade me to marry Edmond.

49
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,201
Because he drank too much.
And talked to much!

50
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:33,192
Because they considered
the marriage unsuitable.

51
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:35,238
Don't lie to me, Sophie Patourel!

52
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,740
You would have thrown yourself
over the cliff that night!

53
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:39,272
If I hadn't stopped you!

54
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,867
Help me! Help me,
Reverend Mother!

55
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:45,335
Octavius think I scarcely
knew Edmond.

56
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,869
He and my children must
never know the truth!

57
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,525
You must go and see
Edmond today.

58
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:50,730
Tell him about your marriage.

59
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:51,621
Your daughters.

60
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,982
Let him know unmistakenly that
the past is buried forever!

61
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:58,297
And he will say nothing to jeopardize
your family's happiness.

62
00:04:59,025 --> 00:04:59,835
Yes, I'll see him!

63
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:00,856
I'll go today!

64
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:01,901
Good!

65
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:05,840
Now I must hurry. The tide may
not wait, even for Mother Superior!

66
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:11,503
There's Edmond now.

67
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,484
Oh, Mrs Metivier, you flatter me.

68
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,172
He has changed.

69
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:19,269
Shockingly.

70
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,765
Cabby, let's have
this bag first, eh?

71
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:24,411
Who is the young man?

72
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:26,532
That is his son.

73
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:32,074
Edmond married in England
his wife died when the boy was born.

74
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,260
Come, sister.

75
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,021
Goodbye, my child.

76
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,865
Goodbye, Reverend Mother.

77
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,292
Mama, help me get
my bonnet on properly!

78
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,812
Naturally, darling.

79
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:52,669
Marianne, Marianne!

80
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:54,813
I won't be long, I'm with papa.

81
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,543
I wrote to London this morning -

82
00:05:57,827 --> 00:06:00,092
- and told them not to send you
the plans for the steam boat.

83
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,452
Marianne, why don't you get married?

84
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:04,475
And I signed your name to the letter.

85
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:06,464
You what?

86
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,076
I said, I signed your name to the letter!

87
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:10,452
Marianne, it is most unseemingly!

88
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,579
Oh nonsens, Papa,
these are modern times!

89
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:15,265
I have made up my mind.
You must marry!

90
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,753
Sir Charles, that's our man.

91
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:19,670
You must know that he loves you.

92
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:25,226
Don't think Mama and I didn't notice
that you spent three hours with him
in the conservatory last night!

93
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:26,110
Yes.

94
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:30,414
Yes, it took me three solid hours to
coax sir Charles to give me this report.

95
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:32,360
You see it is marked "confidential".

96
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:34,238
Here it is.

97
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:36,691
Your new glasses.

98
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:41,387
These figures prove that
at present cost of operations -

99
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:42,957
- the steam boat will eat upp
all its profits.

100
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:48,678
I still say it is most unseemingly for a young woman
to know so much about the shipping business.

101
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:50,473
Papa!

102
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:53,863
You'll be using steam
ships in eight or ten years.

103
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:56,979
By that time you will be retired
and I will be running the business.

104
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:01,565
By that time you'll be married to some
smart young fellow who carry on in my place.

105
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:03,575
If I ever marry -

106
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:06,199
- it won't be because the bride
groom is a good business man!

107
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:10,140
Marianne my dear,
sometimes you shock me!

108
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:12,097
Of course I do.

109
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:14,161
I'm bold and scheming.

110
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:16,669
And sometimes I think
I'm not quite nice!

111
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:18,550
Marianne, Marguerite
is waiting.

112
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:20,600
Oh, be an angel and run
down and tell Mama -

113
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:21,938
- that in exactly five minutes -

114
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,685
- I shall descend upon the
staircase so elegantly -

115
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,328
- I'll frighten myself!

116
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:28,672
You're incorrigible!

117
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:34,756
Marguerite.

118
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:37,036
Marianne, you're beautiful!
Simply beautiful!

119
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:38,692
I am not beautiful!

120
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:40,304
I'm immensly chique!

121
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:40,948
Smell.

122
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:42,241
It's a new perfume from Paris.

123
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:44,771
I think it's a little
indecent, don't you?

124
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,258
Marianne, the neckline of that
dress, do you think it modest?

125
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:49,337
Mama, it's the very
latest style!

126
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:50,834
Papa my angel, what do you think?

127
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:51,961
Is it all too bold?

128
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,517
Not on you, my dear.
God has given you that quality.

129
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:56,579
Oh no, it's all
my own doing!

130
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,085
Now, now, Marianne,
don't be rude to your father!

131
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,437
Go where you're going
before I lose my patience!

132
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:02,026
We're going shopping,
come on!

133
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:03,399
Shopping? In that dress?

134
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:05,509
But Mama, this dress is
only to prove -

135
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:08,182
that even if we are the richest people
on the island we are not snobs!

136
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:11,454
- At least I'm not!
- As a matter of fact I feel particularly common!

137
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:16,692
What are we going shopping for?

138
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,081
We are not going shopping.

139
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,964
We are calling on our new neighbours.

140
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,028
Both of them.

141
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:29,923
Look alive you,
young whipper-snapper!

142
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:35,995
Come in, come in!

143
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:38,528
Well, bless my soul -

144
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:41,259
- if you aren't a pretty pair!

145
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:45,014
William, come and see
what I've got!

146
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,872
A pink one and a green one.

147
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:50,680
Are there any more of you
outside? A yellow one or a blue one?

148
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,964
William, make your manners.
Bow to thelittle dears.

149
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,577
This is my son William.

150
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:58,014
And your name is?

151
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:02,712
- Marianne, and you are sweet.
- Well, thank you!

152
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:03,790
And yours?

153
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:04,903
Marguerite.

154
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:06,291
Marianne and Marguerite.

155
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,998
Two pretty names for
two pretty little dears!

156
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:13,029
Holy Moses, I don't know I've
ever heard two prettier names.

157
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,120
Did you, William?

158
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,342
I don't like them. Too fancy
and too much alike!

159
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,747
He's a viscious little brute, isn't he?

160
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:24,205
Now, sit down, ladies!

161
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:29,498
I've been trying to save him from the likes
of you ever since the day he was born!

162
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:31,991
I've never saw them until this minute.

163
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,769
Oh, he doesn't mean saving you from us!

164
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:36,706
He means from good manners,
respectability, sobriety.

165
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:40,367
Please don't be angry with her,
she talks like that to everybody.

166
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,224
- Angry with her, why, if I were a young man I'd ...
- You'd what?

167
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:47,991
I'd run away as if you were
the devil himself!

168
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:50,759
And a fine job you'd made of
yourself and your son.

169
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:53,904
If it is impossible you can be your son?

170
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:55,381
Impossible?

171
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:56,913
What's wrong?

172
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,850
Well, you can start making yourself civilized.

173
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:01,633
By tying your shoe laces.

174
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,684
I wouldn't give a penny for all
the civilized shoe laces in London!

175
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:10,638
A revolutionary? And just what would be
your idea of a satisfactory existence?

176
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:12,991
If I were running this world
I would pass a law that -

177
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:14,726
- everyone could do exactly as he pleased!

178
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,698
Convincing rascal, isn't he?

179
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:22,916
Ladies, I am Ozanne,
doctor Edmond Ozanne.

180
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:26,884
And you are Marianne and
Marguerite what?

181
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:28,169
- Excuse me, please!

182
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,794
I'm afraid my daughters
are rather unconventional.

183
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:35,918
Naturally one calls on a new neighbour
but not without warning of course.

184
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,357
I am Mrs Patourel, you remember me?

185
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,752
And you are Edmond Ozanne.

186
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:44,115
- Yes, Mam.

187
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:46,255
And you are Sophie.

188
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,284
- We used to know each
other when we were -

189
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:53,381
- Yes, I was just about to tell your
daughters that I didn't know you very well.

190
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,848
My father being a shop keeper -

191
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,755
- on a lower social level -

192
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:58,380
- than your mother's family.

193
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:01,910
- Oh, Edmond, that make us
sound like snobs!

194
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,224
- Oh, but you are Mama! You are
sweet, but you are a snob.

195
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:05,631
- Pay no attention to her.

196
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:08,975
My husband ...
I don't think you ever knew him.

197
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,787
His name is Octavius Patourel.

198
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:12,600
- And he's a bit of snob too!

199
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,305
- Close your mouth,
young woman!

200
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:17,397
Your mother is a gracious lady.

201
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,509
Merely trying to be kind to a -

202
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,760
- good for nothing who drinks more
than is good for him.

203
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:25,219
- Oh, Edmond!

204
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:26,773
- Yes, I ...

205
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,688
The only times I ever really
got away from this island ...

206
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,603
What I left behind here ...

207
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,416
Is through a bottle of ...

208
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:41,262
But I won't presume on
boyhood acquaintanceship.

209
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:45,475
Ah, I forgot! My son!
Salute the lady, William!

210
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:52,619
You are very like your
father as a boy.

211
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:55,986
Let's go now.

212
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:57,120
Come girls!

213
00:11:58,228 --> 00:11:59,403
Good bye, doctor Ozanne.

214
00:11:59,842 --> 00:12:01,829
I'm coming again, soon.

215
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,641
An honour, young lady!

216
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,392
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, William!

217
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:16,114
- Goodbye, William.

218
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,730
You would look much more like a
human being if you combed your hair!

219
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,987
- Thank you Edmond for
helping me out!

220
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,843
They mustn't ever know that
you and I once ...

221
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,031
- Once loved each other
beyond all else.

222
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:36,002
Don't worry, Sophie.

223
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,022
No one will ever hear it from these -

224
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,868
- aging lips.

225
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,086
And which of the two young
ladies put that comb in your hand?

226
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,709
- It was Marianne.

227
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:05,631
Or is her name Marguerite?

228
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:07,818
It was the nice one!

229
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:14,121
- Why, thank you!

230
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:16,301
Who sent them?

231
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,030
- Oh, this is nice.

232
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:41,583
- There are two of them.

233
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,563
- Well, shouldn't Miss Marianne Patourel be told
the name of her secret admirer who sent her flowers?

234
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:49,038
- She doesn't even know I exist
and she never will.

235
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:50,456
- I'll go and tell her!

236
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,099
- You keep your mouth shut, Corinne,
and mind you own business!

237
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,489
Since when has Timothy Haslam
not been my business?

238
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,550
What is over is over -

239
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,767
- I have told you that a thousand times,
now, can't you understand it?

240
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,220
- I can understand.

241
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:03,039
But will my brother understand?

242
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,768
You know he can use a knife too!

243
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,972
That statue of the Madonna up
there, how tall is it?

244
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:34,162
No one has ever seen it close.

245
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:36,401
Except for the Sisters of Saint Peter.

246
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:40,448
William, I've been thinking over very seriously
what you said about shoe laces the other day.

247
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:42,041
Can you get up there from here?

248
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:44,466
Well, they say that many years ago -

249
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:46,144
- before the convent was built -

250
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,675
- smugglers used to climb up through
a tunnel inside the cave!

251
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:49,904
- Smugglers, huh?

252
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:52,281
Well, I can do anything
a smuggler can do!

253
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:02,522
- William!

254
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,233
- Pretty smart of those old smugglers.

255
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,562
You know, at high tide the
whole cave is hidden under water.

256
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:10,585
And at low tide it is perfect for ...
- Sit down, William!

257
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,158
Now, what are you going to
do about your future?

258
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:17,175
- My future?

259
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,647
I think I'll be a smuggler!

260
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,212
- Please be serious!

261
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,088
A man must have some
sort of career.

262
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,464
- I will have to think that over,
it may take years and years.

263
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,316
In the meantime -

264
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,692
- I think I'll just
lie back here.

265
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:34,535
And think of all the exciting places on
the other side of that ocean.

266
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:37,069
The Pacific Ocean and all the others.

267
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:54,629
- Good morning, Emily.
- Good morning, Miss Marianne!

268
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:57,934
- Good morning, Dolly.
- Good morning, Miss.

269
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:06,200
- Marianne.

270
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:10,952
- Pleasant dreams?

271
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:11,823
- Very!

272
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:14,449
Marianne?

273
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,085
It is possible to fall in love with a man -

274
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:17,462
- that you've only known for five days?

275
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:18,947
And seen three times?

276
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:21,791
- Yes, I think it is!

277
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:24,917
- That means you're in love with him too?

278
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:30,563
- No I'm not, but I could be in love
with the man he could be.

279
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:32,699
- Whichever of us?

280
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,910
Oh Marianne, it must
never make any difference between us!

281
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,469
- Nothing ever could
or ever will!

282
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,890
- How can William not
fall in love with you?

283
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,279
You're so striking.

284
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,232
And you have a brain.

285
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,938
- William.
- Yes, father?

286
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:00,128
- There you are!

287
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:03,407
William, did you drink as much
as I did last night?

288
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,285
- I did, old fellow, but
I'm young.

289
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:08,064
- You ungrateful young cub!

290
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,333
- Father, Marguerite
is coming.

291
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:28,166
- The sign says "Doctor Ozanne".

292
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:29,961
- Come this way, please.

293
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:42,640
Sit there.

294
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:45,600
Hey, here's a patient for you!

295
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:51,274
- What's the matter, getting a little trouble?

296
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,513
Holy Moses, that's bad!

297
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:56,915
You've lost a lot of blood.

298
00:17:59,994 --> 00:18:01,398
It's a knife wound, eh?

299
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:03,700
It's a matter for the police.

300
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:07,108
I'll have to report it.

301
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:08,452
- No!

302
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,779
- I always have to report knife wounds.

303
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:11,920
- I don't need you to.

304
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,559
- Well, give me one good
reason why I shouldn't.

305
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:17,263
- Because it's a private matter.

306
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,969
- A woman, huh? And the man
who carved you up was her husband?

307
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:23,375
- Her brother.

308
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:24,596
- Brother?

309
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:27,548
Very dull and uninteresting.

310
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:29,435
Well.

311
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:34,367
Nothing better for the morning
after than a little surgery.

312
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:44,900
- What's the matter, do
I fright you that much?

313
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:47,697
Yes. You are so blasted clever,
you scare me to death!

314
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,914
- Good. Perhaps I can
scare some sense into you!

315
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:52,299
Come down to the harbour,
I want to show you something.

316
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:06,228
- A beautiful ship!

317
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:08,623
What is she, Marianne?

318
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:12,795
- One of the new clippers. The finest,
fastest kind of merchant ship.

319
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:21,395
You see, William? You
see the name? The Green Dolphin.

320
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:24,985
And you live on the corner of
Green Dolphin Street. That's a sign!

321
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,379
Look how high those masts are!

322
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,292
I wonder how
many sails she carries?

323
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:39,042
Well, there's a fore-topmast , staysail, inner jib, outer or flying jib,
foursail, mainsail and mizzen, fitted with topsail, topgallants and royals.

324
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:40,515
What would you be doing here?

325
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:44,962
Where can one get the first
good sleep I've had in a week!

326
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:48,557
Do you know what a storm it was
that drew me here last night?

327
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,541
Where are you from
and what cargo?

328
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,451
From New Zealand,
a cargo of timber.

329
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:56,151
Well, you've got the most
perfect ship I've ever seen!

330
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,984
Captain Dennis O'Hara at your service!

331
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:01,182
Come aboard and have
a bite of breakfast!

332
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:04,165
That's the mark of a shark!

333
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,733
Caught it in the Tasman Sea
with a boat hook!

334
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:09,769
Yes, New Zealand is a
beautiful country.

335
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,323
With forests, half of them grand swell.

336
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:15,340
And the top of trees are
a 150 feet above your head.

337
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,977
And giant ferns below, ferns
reaching above your shoulders.

338
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:21,195
- Giant ferns?

339
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:23,779
- Go on, captain O'Hara!

340
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,191
It's the first I've ever seen William -

341
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:26,603
- interested in anything worthwhile!

342
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,336
- Yes, a grand land!

343
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:30,696
With birds bigger than an ostrich!

344
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,136
But not able to fly for the reason of the heavy stomach they have on them.

345
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:37,420
And mountains with the snow
always on their crests.

346
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:47,340
Slipped ashore last night, did you?

347
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,393
Stole the eggs off the natives?

348
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:53,506
It's meself, I'm proud of you for that!

349
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:56,710
Doesn't your servant talk English?

350
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,074
Not, he don't talk sense at all!

351
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:02,211
Some cannibals in New Zealand
tied with his tongue.

352
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:03,475
That's why.

353
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:04,676
Cannibals?

354
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:05,740
Chopped off his leg too!

355
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:07,600
A grand country, New Zealand!

356
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:10,701
With timber and flax, and
wonderful pasture land!

357
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,281
All virgin soil, and don't
belong to no one!

358
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:16,923
There are places like that in this world,
and I have to live and die here on this little ...?

359
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:19,359
You don't have to do anyting you don't want to!

360
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:21,005
Here, my dear, for you!

361
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:23,688
They are made of a New
Zealand stone called tangiway.

362
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:25,969
And green is your colour, I can see.

363
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:28,046
And for you, son!

364
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:29,579
The maoris of New Zealand -

365
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:30,913
- use a knife like this.

366
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:32,792
For cutting up human flesh.

367
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,989
Captain O'Hara, they are beautiful!

368
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,346
I've gotta be going, there's
trouble on deck.

369
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:42,911
Finish your breakfast.

370
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:49,527
Answer, what's going on here?

371
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:53,508
Sneaked aboard, eh?

372
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:55,849
A stow-away! Who are ye?

373
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:57,377
Who are ye?

374
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,703
What difference does it make?

375
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:01,769
Toss him overboard!

376
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:04,760
Let me go!

377
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:09,065
My name is Timothy Haslam.

378
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:16,502
You wouldn't be hiding
from the police?

379
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:18,535
It was a fair fight.

380
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:21,317
And it's plain you
killed the other fella.

381
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,067
I won't lie to you,
I did kill him.

382
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,536
But I didn't lift a hand at him until he came at me with a knife.

383
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:29,754
I believe you.

384
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:33,411
It is well and fairly spoken.

385
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:35,556
And I'll help you.

386
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:38,961
Besides, I'm a man short in me crew.

387
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:41,521
Take him below.

388
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:42,584
Hide him in the fox hole.

389
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:43,586
Come along.

390
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:46,523
The English law can't reach
you in New Zealand.

391
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:07,065
- Now look.

392
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,143
Just look at her!

393
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:29,033
I know what I'm gonna do.

394
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:30,566
I have made up my mind.
- What?

395
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,067
- I gonna be a sailor on
a clipper ship, like that one.

396
00:23:33,594 --> 00:23:35,754
- No, not on a clipper ship. Your
going into the navy.

397
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:36,909
- The navy?

398
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:38,569
- To be an officer and a gentleman!

399
00:23:39,132 --> 00:23:39,931
- Well, that takes money.

400
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:41,904
- Well, suppose somebody
found a way -

401
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,569
- to provide the money and the influence?

402
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:45,046
- Well, that's just talk, who?

403
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:46,930
- My father.
- What?

404
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:49,607
And you suppose my father
would permit that?

405
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:54,181
- I repeat, Marianne.

406
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:57,466
How could you go aboard a strange
ship with that uncouth ragamuffin?

407
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,201
How could you indulge in such a
disreputable escapade?

408
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:01,891
Stop sulking!

409
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,124
- Are those your new glasses?

410
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:05,223
- Certainly, certainly.

411
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,113
- Well, then you better send
them back. I'm not sulking.

412
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:10,350
I'm smiling humbly.

413
00:24:10,955 --> 00:24:13,642
I am sorry, I aplogize and my
behaviour was most unladylike.

414
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:14,914
I ask you to forgive me.

415
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:17,800
- Well, we'll say no more about it.

416
00:24:18,427 --> 00:24:19,017
- Thank you, Papa.

417
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,019
- The matter is closed.

418
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:21,208
- Not quite.

419
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,145
What about William?

420
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:23,959
- William?

421
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,053
- He wants to go in the navy.

422
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,144
- Not my problem.

423
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:29,301
- Well, you object to William
being around and -

424
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,866
- if he went off to the navy,
he wouldn't be here.

425
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:32,761
Would he?

426
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:34,520
And when he does come back -

427
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:35,769
- why, then he'd be a gentleman.

428
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:37,333
And he wouldn't be so offensive.

429
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:38,441
Would he?

430
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:42,583
- Bright girl, Sophie.

431
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,460
- But of course, it takes
money and influence.

432
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,483
- Not my money, oh no!

433
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,818
- Mama is very fond of William.

434
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:52,462
Wouldn't you like to treat William
as if he were the son -

435
00:24:52,463 --> 00:24:55,303
- that Mama has always longed for,
but has never had?

436
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:58,431
Mind you, it's not going to be as
easy as you think.

437
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,078
William's father is very proud.

438
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,712
You may have a little difficulty in getting
him to accept the proposition.

439
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,389
But you're so brilliant, you'll do it!

440
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:11,321
And mention Mama and her
affection for William.

441
00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:14,152
- I don't need to be told how to
carry out a good idea!

442
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,214
- Then don't go to see doctor Ozanne this evening.

443
00:25:16,463 --> 00:25:17,182
Tomorrow will do.

444
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,923
- I should go tonight!
I should go now!

445
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,527
And take doctor Ozanne
a bottle of brandy.

446
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,527
- I will not!

447
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:29,402
- Our best brandy. The kind you
smuggle in from France.

448
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:35,248
Marianne, your father is very good.

449
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,584
He's very easily managed.

450
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:41,442
Mama.

451
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:46,686
Emily, put the keys of the
wine cellar back in my desk.

452
00:25:46,687 --> 00:25:47,064
Very well, Sir.

453
00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:17,828
William, you're practically in the navy.

454
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:23,532
It's Midsummer Festival day.

455
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:25,487
How slowly the years have passed -

456
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:27,661
- since William left for England and -

457
00:26:28,243 --> 00:26:30,190
- the Royal Naval College of Portsmouth.

458
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,159
And now at last Her Majesty's
ship arrive -

459
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,787
- sailing majestically into our harbour -

460
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:37,351
- and William is aboard.

461
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:08,461
There he is!

462
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,116
Two years without a
letter to his own father!

463
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:13,950
The young cub!

464
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:48,415
Hey, hey!

465
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:01,274
Well, old fellow, you look
younger than I do!

466
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:07,288
Digestive trouble!

467
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:11,936
I may even have to take some of that horrible stuff I give to my patients!

468
00:28:14,846 --> 00:28:15,478
Come in!

469
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:23,498
Come in, my boy, come in!

470
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:30,827
This note came for
you a while back.

471
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:34,621
One of the servants brought
it from the Patourel house.

472
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:40,811
"Dear William."

473
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:43,890
"I have arranged for you to
come to dinner tonight at 7."

474
00:28:44,316 --> 00:28:45,266
"So that my father -

475
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:49,968
- may see the results so far of
his investment in your future."

476
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:53,173
"I know you won't fail me.
Marianne."

477
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:55,077
Hey, you've gotta go, too!

478
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,485
I wanna go.

479
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:58,422
I wanna see...

480
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:02,221
But my ship sails at
high tide tonight.

481
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:06,226
I know, but we'll have
the whole afternoon together.

482
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,882
What's a few more years?
Time passes.

483
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:12,571
Soon you'll be
home to stay!

484
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:16,696
How do you know
about my ship?

485
00:29:17,314 --> 00:29:18,821
The Patourel girl told me.

486
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:23,511
Came over here not ten minutes
after the Orion had dropped anchor.

487
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:24,767
Which Patourel girl?

488
00:29:25,192 --> 00:29:26,053
Both of them.

489
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:28,228
Both of the pretty
little rascals!

490
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:32,433
They've been popping in
and out of ever here since you left.

491
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,384
Bless their hearts.

492
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:37,055
Which one is it you're
so anxious to see?

493
00:29:38,897 --> 00:29:40,773
The one I've had on my
mind ever since -

494
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:42,553
- ever since I
first saw her.

495
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:48,272
That would be the one who is so much
like her mother when she was a girl.

496
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:53,274
Son, if you have it in your
heart to speak to this girl -

497
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:57,149
- remember that fine families are
very particular -

498
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,172
about a son-in-law.

499
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:02,586
I know, I've been
worrying about it.

500
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:03,669
About her father.

501
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:06,422
When you are an
established officer -

502
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:07,752
- in her Majesty's Navy -

503
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,200
- you'll be a gentleman!

504
00:30:09,828 --> 00:30:11,484
Even to Mr Patourel!

505
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,322
- Good evening, Sir.

506
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,934
- Good evening.

507
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:19,901
- In the drawing room, Sir.

508
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:20,793
- Thank you.

509
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,422
- William!
- Marguerite!

510
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:29,686
- The others will be down in a moment.

511
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,749
- And I shall make use of that moment.

512
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:37,584
Marguerite.

513
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,209
Ever since I saw you last -

514
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:41,453
- I've thougt of nothing but you.

515
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,251
I love you.

516
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:48,439
May I say that?

517
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:51,144
I love you!

518
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:54,927
- Keep saying it William because I love you too.

519
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:00,276
- Listen.

520
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:02,595
This must be our secret.

521
00:31:04,005 --> 00:31:05,937
But all the time I'm away from you -

522
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:08,307
- you must keep saying to
yourself that I love you!

523
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:09,799
- Mama!

524
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:11,549
- Good evening, William.

525
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:13,996
It's a pleasure to
welcome you to our home.

526
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,409
You're very handsome
in your uniform.

527
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:18,474
Thank you, Mrs Patourel.

528
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:20,942
He's a little thin.

529
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:22,537
- That's the life of disciplin.

530
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,129
The best thing in the
world for a man.

531
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:25,411
William.

532
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:26,351
How are you, Marianne?

533
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:28,122
Very well pleased with you.

534
00:31:29,327 --> 00:31:30,631
So you're off to China tonight?

535
00:31:31,262 --> 00:31:32,225
Oh, how lucky you are, William!

536
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,354
You know, Mama, The Green Dolphin
trades on the China coast.

537
00:31:35,884 --> 00:31:39,259
And captain O'Hara says that knowledge of
the Orient is most important nowadays.

538
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,134
Yes, I suppose so.

539
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:43,447
In the future, the commerce of the
world will center on the Pacific.

540
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:47,259
Yes, I think Papa will be satisfied with
your progress so far.

541
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,658
Excuse me.

542
00:31:51,695 --> 00:31:52,593
What is it, Mrs Metiver?

543
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:55,328
Doctor Ozanne, he's just had a seizure.

544
00:31:56,603 --> 00:31:57,479
He's very ill!

545
00:31:57,885 --> 00:31:59,169
Mr William must come!

546
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:00,479
Yes, I'll bring him.

547
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:01,973
Get my cloak.

548
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,139
William.

549
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:07,542
Your father just had a sudden attack.

550
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:08,465
My father?

551
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:12,317
Margurerite, get Mama's smelling salt.
And then find a doctor. The nearest.

552
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:13,786
Come William.

553
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,732
Steady William, this might not be serious.

554
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,171
Speak to him, William.

555
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:34,594
Father?

556
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:37,313
Can you hear me?

557
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:41,345
Are you really here, William?

558
00:32:44,283 --> 00:32:46,065
Of course I'm here, of course I'm here!
.

559
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:52,191
Thank you, thank you for coming, William.

560
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:54,910
Shows you -

561
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:57,299
- you really love me.

562
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:01,756
You won't have to stay very long.

563
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:07,849
Because I'm not going to last very long.

564
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,647
- William!
- Yes father?

565
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:17,286
Wouldn't it be a joke now -

566
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:21,148
- if I didn't die after all?

567
00:33:22,226 --> 00:33:29,226
But I won't play that kind of joke on you.

568
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:35,992
Because I've always loved you.

569
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:42,635
Father! Father!

570
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:48,201
Oh, come William!

571
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:58,877
- William, William, listen to me!
- You don't know how wonderful he was!

572
00:33:59,216 --> 00:34:00,668
- Yes, I do. I knew and I loved him.

573
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:04,108
But you must realize tonight he saw you were being wonderful too.

574
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,796
He saw you as you are now, an officer and a gentleman.

575
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:09,795
- And that's how you should remember him!
- What does that matter now?

576
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:13,735
It matters a great deal. Cause you
are going to do things that will
make him very proud of you.

577
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:16,008
Oh, William.

578
00:34:17,674 --> 00:34:19,033
Stay here with him for a little while.

579
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,422
I'll stay with you if you like.

580
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:24,409
But then we must get you back to your ship
cause it sails at midnight.

581
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:25,485
I'm not going to the ship!

582
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,923
I won't leave. I can't!

583
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:30,834
Yes you can!

584
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:33,196
You're going to sail away with your ship.

585
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:36,043
And when you come back next year
you come back with your head high!

586
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,964
Full of pride of what you've done with yourself!

587
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:41,072
With the knowledge that he would've been
as proud of you.

588
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,679
You'll find his grave. We'll bury him
with honour and with kindness.

589
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,177
But when you kneel by his grave -

590
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:51,241
- you can weep upon a brave heart and
respect yourself as well as him!

591
00:34:53,278 --> 00:34:56,790
William, there will be flowers on
his grave next year.

592
00:34:58,302 --> 00:35:00,527
There will always be flowers on his grave.

593
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:26,332
"Pier 3"
"Sailing tonight: HMS Orion"

594
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:28,280
Well, Ozanne, there's China.

595
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:30,708
- Take it all in.
- Yes, Sir.

596
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:32,812
But be back on board by midnight!

597
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:33,724
-  By all means, Sir.

598
00:35:34,447 --> 00:35:36,058
All I'm looking forward to is our return home.

599
00:36:22,036 --> 00:36:23,426
- You wish to buy something?

600
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,137
- Yes. Please, I'd like something
for a young lady.

601
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:28,523
- Certainly.

602
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:32,897
- You speak English, perfectly!

603
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,242
- Yes, my father was an Englishman.

604
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,827
This is a Chinese charm necklace.

605
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,432
To be given to the one whom you love.

606
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,713
- Ah, yes, that's just what I wanted!

607
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:52,587
How much is it?

608
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:54,341
- Four pieces of silver.

609
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:56,152
Chinese money.

610
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:02,615
- I haven't any Chinese money.

611
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,500
Will you take English?

612
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:06,621
- One English gold sovereign.

613
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:10,206
- Could I write a letter?

614
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:13,043
- Of course, over there.

615
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:17,810
"Dear Marguerite."

616
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:20,615
"This necklace will say I
have always loved you."

617
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:22,220
"Wait for me!"

618
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,000
"When I come home I -

619
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:26,939
- will ask your father for your hand in marriage."

620
00:37:39,116 --> 00:37:40,492
- And when will you be home?

621
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:43,244
- Not for another two years.

622
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,754
- There is an English clipper
ship in the harbour.

623
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:49,336
It will be home in six months.

624
00:37:52,612 --> 00:37:53,278
- Thank you very much!

625
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:17,917
You there?

626
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:19,592
- Ay ay, Sir?

627
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:20,544
- There's a clipper ship in
the port sailing for home.

628
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:22,112
Put this package and letter on board.

629
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,280
Ay ay, Sir!

630
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:24,193
- I think this should cover the cost.

631
00:38:24,623 --> 00:38:25,321
- Right, Sir.

632
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,128
- You will drink a little rice wine?

633
00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:25,203
- Where is this place?

634
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:29,237
Where is this place?

635
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:54,169
- What's the matter, mate?

636
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:56,697
- Where's the Orion?

637
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,554
The Orion, man, where is she?

638
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:01,615
- The Orion, mate, she sailed at midnight!

639
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,365
As far as you're concerned
she's halfway to Calcutta!

640
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:42,120
- Ahoy, a stow-away!

641
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,117
What the devil are ye?

642
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,744
- Don't you remember me, captain O'Hara?

643
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:49,224
Of St. Pierre?

644
00:40:50,212 --> 00:40:51,367
- Let's have a look at you!

645
00:40:56,352 --> 00:40:57,744
That young fellow!

646
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,345
What are you doing here, son?

647
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,046
What's the trouble?

648
00:41:03,149 --> 00:41:04,807
- I had shore leave.

649
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,808
Something happened.

650
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:08,595
My ship sailed.

651
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,296
- Women and rum?

652
00:41:10,862 --> 00:41:11,550
- Yes, Sir.

653
00:41:11,925 --> 00:41:12,581
- What ship?

654
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:14,593
- The Orion.

655
00:41:14,997 --> 00:41:15,515
- The navy?

656
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,621
Young fool!

657
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,371
Alright, lad.

658
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,156
If you had gone straight to
Her Majesty's consul -

659
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:22,653
- and made a clean brest of it.

660
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:25,012
But, no.

661
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:27,184
Instead of that you are now a deserter.

662
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:30,750
A fine mess you've made of your life!

663
00:41:31,376 --> 00:41:32,532
- Where are we bound, captain O'Hara?

664
00:41:32,998 --> 00:41:34,060
- New Zealand.

665
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:35,060
And you're lucky!

666
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,625
There you'll be safe from the law.

667
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:40,220
Fine young muscles like yours will
be at a premium among the settlers!

668
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:05,782
- William!

669
00:42:09,144 --> 00:42:10,236
Parson and Mrs Kelly.

670
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:11,298
William Ozanne.

671
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,362
- How do you do?

672
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,016
- Well son, I'm ready to up anchor
and leave Wellington.

673
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:16,458
Which means you are through
with the Green Dolphin.

674
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:18,832
But parson Kelly and his
wife will take you in.

675
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:21,363
You can help in the
mission school.

676
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:23,486
- I don't like to impose on a parson.

677
00:42:23,861 --> 00:42:25,613
- Who else am I to impose you
on for the parson?

678
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:30,604
A parson can't refuse you bed and breakfast,
it is expressly provided in the Book of Matthew.

679
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:32,381
Isn't that so parson?

680
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:33,424
- Quite so!

681
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:35,302
- Thank you parson!

682
00:42:36,273 --> 00:42:36,895
Mam!

683
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:48,839
Give a good heart, son!

684
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,124
Don't fret over past mistakes.

685
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:53,154
And remember, it is better to
keep away from the liquor today -

686
00:42:53,653 --> 00:42:56,419
- than to waste tomorrow counting
yesterday's empty bottles!

687
00:42:57,785 --> 00:42:59,090
- Thank you for everything,
captain O'Hara!

688
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:01,608
If you ever get back to St Pierre -

689
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:02,702
- you won't tell anybody?

690
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:04,294
- Have no fear of that, son,
and God bless you!

691
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:05,881
Shove off lads!

692
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:36,539
- Earthquake?

693
00:43:37,245 --> 00:43:38,829
- That's right, chum,
there's an earthquake.

694
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:39,702
- That's right!

695
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:43,308
- Whiskey!

696
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:27,954
- You're a homie!

697
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:29,396
- Huh?

698
00:44:30,722 --> 00:44:31,597
- New to this country?

699
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:33,095
- Oh, just landed, Sir.

700
00:44:34,034 --> 00:44:34,661
- Got a job?

701
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,002
- Yes, I've got a job.

702
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:38,143
Teaching the kiddies at
the mission school.

703
00:44:39,814 --> 00:44:40,942
- Not your sort of work, huh?

704
00:44:41,301 --> 00:44:42,024
- What do you think?

705
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:46,192
- Got a place up north in the
backblocks, getting out Caule.

706
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,065
That is big tree timber.

707
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,695
You can pitch in and join
me, if you like.

708
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:54,849
- But why, you don't know
anything about me?

709
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,071
- I know as much about you as your father
know about me back in St Pierre.

710
00:44:59,745 --> 00:45:02,087
When he patched up this arm
without telling the police.

711
00:45:03,415 --> 00:45:05,805
- I remember, I thought
you looked familiar!

712
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:08,290
You killed a man and got away!

713
00:45:08,694 --> 00:45:09,639
- Keep your mouth shut!

714
00:45:10,323 --> 00:45:11,749
- And your name's Haslam!

715
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:15,290
- My name's Tai Haruru.

716
00:45:16,135 --> 00:45:17,436
The Maoris gave it to me.

717
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:22,228
That's all you need
to know about me.

718
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:25,258
- And the same applies to me!

719
00:45:26,446 --> 00:45:27,164
- Alright.

720
00:45:28,156 --> 00:45:30,574
I'll work you harder than you've
ever been worked before in your life.

721
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:36,438
And you'll have to be ready for travel
because there'll be war between the
natives, the Maoris, and the colonials before long.

722
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:40,824
Make up your mind, if you go with me you
can forget that girl at home.

723
00:45:41,574 --> 00:45:42,651
- Who told you about a girl?

724
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:45,371
- A mutual friend.

725
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:46,699
Captain O'Hara.

726
00:45:48,043 --> 00:45:49,203
Tell me something, Ozanne.

727
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:52,483
Which of the two sisters was it?

728
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:56,203
- None of your blasted business!

729
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,847
Sir.

730
00:46:09,324 --> 00:46:10,226
- Well, there it is, Ozanne!

731
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:11,560
- The whole valley?

732
00:46:12,123 --> 00:46:12,887
- Oh, we live...

733
00:46:13,511 --> 00:46:14,623
- You see the lake?
- Aha.

734
00:46:15,194 --> 00:46:17,225
- We live on the banks of the river -

735
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:18,165
- 10 miles upstream from there.

736
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:20,102
Without the benefit of clergy or doctors.

737
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:21,881
- Very comforting. 

738
00:46:22,288 --> 00:46:23,788
- The whole valley is a
Maori stronghold.

739
00:46:24,335 --> 00:46:27,201
You'll find our settlement
reasonably comfortable and safe.

740
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,417

741
00:46:47,464 --> 00:46:48,526
- Are those friendly Maoris?

742
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:50,859
- Well, they're my friends.

743
00:46:51,432 --> 00:46:55,495
Perhaps they'll be yours if you treat
them courteously and keep your word.
Never show fear before them.

744
00:46:59,873 --> 00:47:01,777
But they're a dangerous and strange people.

745
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:05,981
I've seen some extraordinary exhibitions of
their ability to predict the future.

746
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,794
Have a look at their river, Ozanne!

747
00:47:18,374 --> 00:47:22,563
Perhaps some day that water will travel
halfway around the world and splash
on the beach at St Pierre!

748
00:47:47,303 --> 00:47:48,137
- Marguerite!

749
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:51,805
I want you to go down to the dressmaker's
and match this silk for me.

750
00:47:56,355 --> 00:47:57,228
Marguerite, I...

751
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,008
What are you hiding
from me, Marguerite?

752
00:48:11,777 --> 00:48:12,747
- It's a secret, Mama.

753
00:48:13,797 --> 00:48:17,873
- Is it a secret that has anything
to do with you not marrying anyone
of those halfdozen young men?

754
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:21,246
My dear, I would never insist
upon you marrying anyone.

755
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:23,174
But you have your life to live.

756
00:48:24,308 --> 00:48:25,371
I have a life, mama, -

757
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,390
- in my thoughts and my dreams.

758
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,218
- Marguerite!

759
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:53,135
- Marianne! Home, Edward.

760
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:01,552
- Papa?

761
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:05,599
I believe William Ozanne is dead.

762
00:49:05,896 --> 00:49:06,730
- No, I question that.

763
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:08,423
Only the good die young!

764
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:10,031
No, he's dead!

765
00:49:10,812 --> 00:49:14,109
Or that would account for his not writing
once since he sailed away on the Orion.

766
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:14,931
- Oh, I don't know...

767
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:16,270
Well, if he were alive - 

768
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:18,202
- nothing would have kept him -

769
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,094
-  writing to... you in common gratitude.

770
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:22,533
- Oh, true...

771
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:24,753
- Or to me in friendship.

772
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,835
Or to Marguerite.

773
00:49:27,713 --> 00:49:28,929
Of whom he was once very fond.

774
00:49:29,721 --> 00:49:31,129
In a childish way.

775
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:33,972
No, papa.

776
00:49:34,784 --> 00:49:35,893
William is dead.

777
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:40,119
- Sophie, come quick, she's fainted!

778
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:40,882
- What?

779
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:41,650
- She's fainted!

780
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,034
- Mrs Metivier, Marguerite's fainted.

781
00:49:43,323 --> 00:49:45,785
Get my smelling
salt, cold water and towels.

782
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:46,873
- And the dusters.

783
00:49:49,142 --> 00:49:49,999
- Marianne's fainted?

784
00:49:50,451 --> 00:49:51,161
I don't believe it!

785
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:52,576
- Neither do I.

786
00:49:52,983 --> 00:49:54,719
But your father hasn't lied to me for 30 years.

787
00:49:55,222 --> 00:49:55,935
Let's go and see.

788
00:50:02,656 --> 00:50:03,721
- I have asked your
mother to come down.

789
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:05,208
- Marianne, what is it?

790
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,687
- Get her some cognac.

791
00:50:06,977 --> 00:50:08,210
- No, no, no, some smelling salts!

792
00:50:08,534 --> 00:50:10,689
- No, cognac would be better, dear.

793
00:50:11,563 --> 00:50:13,738
[moans]

794
00:50:15,877 --> 00:50:16,712
- But who!

795
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:17,814
- The lady is late.

796
00:50:18,103 --> 00:50:21,004
I was waiting here for Mr Patourel
when the two of them came in.

797
00:50:21,462 --> 00:50:22,627
And all I said was:

798
00:50:23,214 --> 00:50:27,150
"Here's a letter for you, Mr Patourel, which
I bring you from William Ozanne in New Zealand".

799
00:50:27,597 --> 00:50:28,379
And then...

800
00:50:29,412 --> 00:50:30,993
Now look, this one's fainted!

801
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:33,475
- No, this one hasn't fainted.

802
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:35,502
This one's praying.

803
00:50:37,264 --> 00:50:37,999
- Then I'll be going.

804
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,844
- But tell me about William,
what is he doing in New Zealand?

805
00:50:41,129 --> 00:50:42,123
Is he still in the navy?

806
00:50:43,142 --> 00:50:45,895
- Due to an unfortunate incident,
the lad severed his connection.

807
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:48,146
And good day to ye all!

808
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:52,082
- Marianne, the letter is
addressed to me!

809
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:11,273
- Suppose I read it aloud, dear?

810
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:13,272
- I will not be bullied
in my own household!

811
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:15,368
"Dear Sir"

812
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:18,336
"It is a long time since I've had
the pleasure of addressing you."

813
00:51:19,435 --> 00:51:22,900
"Much has happened and I now feel that
I have earned the privilege of writing."

814
00:51:23,424 --> 00:51:24,858
- The young blaggard! 

815
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:26,118
Left the navy, and a deserter probably!

816
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:27,956
After all the money I spent on him!

817
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:29,268
- Mama, go on with the letter!

818
00:51:31,393 --> 00:51:33,800
"I have been in the lumber business
for over two years."

819
00:51:34,283 --> 00:51:36,787
"And I can say I am becoming a
fairly successful businessman."

820
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,361
"My partner is a man of great ability."

821
00:51:39,688 --> 00:51:43,297
"And we have developed our little
settlement into a garden spot with
comfortable dwellings."

822
00:52:12,573 --> 00:52:13,236
- What's been going on out there?

823
00:52:13,645 --> 00:52:16,446
Has that fortune telling medicine man
been reading tea leaves again?

824
00:52:21,988 --> 00:52:25,261
- He says that a letter you wrote
was delievered today on the
other side of the world.

825
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,067
- How could he know that?

826
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:29,446
I personally gave it to captain -

827
00:52:29,727 --> 00:52:31,272
- O'Hara myself months ago,
I didn't even...

828
00:52:33,147 --> 00:52:33,952
Hold on, wait a minute!

829
00:52:34,607 --> 00:52:35,711
- It was about a young woman, wasn't it?

830
00:52:37,117 --> 00:52:38,054
That's my own private affair!

831
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,305
- Put down that drink!

832
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:45,368
The Patourel girl?

833
00:52:46,617 --> 00:52:47,526
Alright!

834
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:49,900
I was drunk!

835
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:51,839
I was in Wellington.

836
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,524
Alone and miserable!

837
00:52:55,984 --> 00:52:57,495
Alright, I was drunk!

838
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:03,121
Never had the courage if I hadn't been drunk.
Asking a wonderful girl like that to
come all the way out here.

839
00:53:05,714 --> 00:53:06,455
- Which girl?

840
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:07,995
- After all they did for me.

841
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,994
I wrote and offered my hand in marriage.

842
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:12,843
A life like this!

843
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:15,685
- Which girl, I said?

844
00:53:16,717 --> 00:53:17,748
- Marguerite of course!

845
00:53:20,746 --> 00:53:23,247
- "I do not know what life has brought
you and your good wife."

846
00:53:24,282 --> 00:53:26,716
"And as for your lovely daughters
they may have married."

847
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:30,500
"Yet I can not but hope that..."

848
00:53:31,899 --> 00:53:34,116
- Speak up, what does the
young blaggard want?

849
00:53:35,272 --> 00:53:38,376
"Yet I cannot but hope that your
daughter Marianne is still unmarried."

850
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:44,441
"Yet I cannot but hope that your
daughter Marianne is still unmarried."

851
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:48,276
"That you would consider
permitting her to live -

852
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:52,900
- in such a rough but glorious
country as my wife."

853
00:53:54,337 --> 00:53:56,275
- As his wife?

854
00:53:56,909 --> 00:53:57,872
Marianne?

855
00:54:01,225 --> 00:54:02,975
- The confounded cheat!

856
00:54:04,129 --> 00:54:07,255
The outrageous, overwhelming fool!

857
00:54:08,128 --> 00:54:09,818
Sophie, here, write, my dictation!

858
00:54:10,526 --> 00:54:12,882
Here's pen, ink, paper, sit down, dear!

859
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,998
Now write, Mr William Ozanne.

860
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:17,779
- Father, you act as though I've been insulted -

861
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:20,131
-  instead of honoured by a marriage proposal!

862
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,368
- No daughter of mine...
- I am old enought to marry without your consent -

863
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:24,321
- and that is exactly what I intend do!

864
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:25,478
- Of course you are!

865
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:27,157
You are unjust to William!

866
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,321
If he was foolish in the past -

867
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:31,007
- he has now written you a fine and straight forward letter.

868
00:54:31,946 --> 00:54:34,093
- My daughter going to live among
a lot of man eating savages?

869
00:54:34,494 --> 00:54:36,010
- She always wanted to marry William.

870
00:54:36,876 --> 00:54:38,009
She will never marry anybody else.

871
00:54:39,732 --> 00:54:40,658
Will you, Marianne?

872
00:54:44,441 --> 00:54:45,253
- No!

873
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,711
And I am going to marry William!

874
00:54:48,932 --> 00:54:50,557
- Everyone is insane here except me!

875
00:54:50,931 --> 00:54:53,214
Here, write a letter to
mister William Ozanne.

876
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:55,447
"Sir, you may return here."

877
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:58,948
"And if at that time Marianne still desires to marry you."

878
00:54:59,386 --> 00:55:00,718
I will permit the bands to be published.

879
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:02,323
"And in due course -

880
00:55:02,824 --> 00:55:05,879
- and in the presence of her family,
and in her own church..."

881
00:55:06,357 --> 00:55:09,138
- I don't intend to wait for any letter!

882
00:55:12,222 --> 00:55:13,264
When does the Green Dolphin sail?

883
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:15,326
- On the 31.

884
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:17,784
- And I forbid you...
- Then I'm going on the 31!

885
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:18,661
- I forbid it!

886
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:21,467
Log of the Green Dolphin.

887
00:55:22,008 --> 00:55:24,576
Sunday. 172nd Day out of St Pierre.

888
00:55:25,051 --> 00:55:26,437
Weather fine.

889
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:31,001
Lord hear our prayer.

890
00:55:32,467 --> 00:55:34,887
Eternal Lord which alone spreadeth out the heavens -

891
00:55:35,827 --> 00:55:40,917
- and ruleth the raging of the sea.

892
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:44,278
Receive into thy Almighty protection.

893
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:45,939
The persons of us.

894
00:55:47,074 --> 00:55:48,205
Thy servants.

895
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,668
And the ship in which we serve.

896
00:55:51,452 --> 00:55:52,014
Amen.

897
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,739
Look alive you buckeyed nincompoop!

898
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:57,868
Is it land or is it a cloud?

899
00:55:58,352 --> 00:55:59,377
Land ho!

900
00:56:00,143 --> 00:56:01,408
Land at starboard!

901
00:56:02,353 --> 00:56:03,104
Mr Johnsson!

902
00:56:04,396 --> 00:56:06,334
Anchor it with four topsails and yip

903
00:56:06,645 --> 00:56:07,215
Ay ay Sir!

904
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:11,241
Start the rollers and get up.

905
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:13,625
Come on you sons of a seacook and get up there!

906
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:17,773
Now hear me closely!

907
00:56:18,493 --> 00:56:20,896
William Ozanne has no reason
to expect you on this ship.

908
00:56:21,765 --> 00:56:22,901
When we tie up at Wellington -

909
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:24,527
- you can shut yourself up in your cabin.

910
00:56:25,275 --> 00:56:27,289
And three days later we'll be on our way again.

911
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,210
You don't want me to marry William Ozanne?

912
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:32,923
The letter I gave your father was handed to me -

913
00:56:33,214 --> 00:56:35,433
- by a bleary-eyed William Ozanne.
Just out of a stinking saloon.

914
00:56:35,962 --> 00:56:37,961
Surely it was written more in whiskey than in ink!

915
00:56:38,952 --> 00:56:40,714
Had I known it was a proposal of marriage to ye -

916
00:56:40,996 --> 00:56:43,291
-  I'd have torn it to bits and flung it to the seven winds!

917
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:46,061
So help me I would!

918
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,403
If William were a fine strong character -

919
00:56:49,735 --> 00:56:50,903
- what would he need me for?

920
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,150
For the very reason that he sent for me -

921
00:56:53,498 --> 00:56:55,271
- is because he knows I can save him from himself.

922
00:56:56,376 --> 00:56:59,718
Captain O'Hara, I've loved you since the
first day I came aboard the Green Dolphin.

923
00:57:00,687 --> 00:57:03,029
But there isn't anything you can say to change me.

924
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:05,457
I'll make a fine man of William.

925
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:07,002
I will.

926
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,543
I will.

927
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:10,837
Drink up lads!

928
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:12,987
The Green Dolphin's pulling in if you wants to meet her.

929
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:14,963
That proves no second sight.

930
00:57:16,696 --> 00:57:18,594
The natives could have just sighted the ship -

931
00:57:18,595 --> 00:57:20,655
- rounding The Three Kings and sent word over.

932
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,260
Now, if she brings a letter from Marguerite...

933
00:57:25,972 --> 00:57:27,033
That's different.

934
00:57:29,066 --> 00:57:30,472
Come on, let's see.

935
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:48,048
Look.

936
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:49,613
Look there.

937
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:57,052
It can't be.

938
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,018
She came!

939
00:58:01,135 --> 00:58:02,020
It's Marguerite!

940
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:03,832
Look again.

941
00:58:05,665 --> 00:58:07,035
Marianne?

942
00:58:08,177 --> 00:58:09,150
You stupid fool!

943
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:11,587
Did you put the wrong name in that drunken letter?

944
00:58:13,537 --> 00:58:14,461
But even if I did -

945
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:16,756
- why should Marianne come?

946
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:18,929
Did Marianne ever show any signs
of being in love with you?

947
00:58:20,054 --> 00:58:20,527
I think -

948
00:58:21,288 --> 00:58:22,327
- perhaps she did.

949
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:23,526
Go on.

950
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:25,296
Wave to her

951
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,789
Keep waving.
Wave your arm off.

952
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,185
I can't marry her. I'm not in love with her!

953
00:58:44,344 --> 00:58:45,813
Are you gonna send a girl like that back home -

954
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,126
- turned down by a drunken young jackass too
tipsy to remember the right name of the girl he loved?

955
00:58:50,285 --> 00:58:51,149
No, you won't do that.

956
00:58:51,898 --> 00:58:53,251
I might do it in the name of truth and common sense.

957
00:58:53,511 --> 00:58:55,326
But you haven't got either the strength or the cruelty.

958
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:56,865
Now listen!

959
00:58:57,429 --> 00:58:59,898
Go to her, put your arms around her.
Make her feel that you want her.

960
00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:01,546
And don't ever let down.

961
00:59:02,825 --> 00:59:04,276
And remember, her name is Marianne.

962
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:07,713
I hate what I'm gonna do, but I do it!

963
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,789
I'll marry her, just as my father married.

964
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,026
Out of pity.

965
00:59:13,055 --> 00:59:14,540
And don't worry, I'll go through with it.

966
00:59:42,757 --> 00:59:43,853
Good luck, Mam.

967
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:44,903
Congratulations, Sir.

968
00:59:45,156 --> 00:59:45,604
Mister Morgan!

969
00:59:45,857 --> 00:59:46,525
All hands -

970
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:47,859
- spice the main braize.

971
00:59:48,995 --> 00:59:50,523
And a double eggnog to all of ye!

972
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:53,807

973
01:00:06,024 --> 01:00:08,564
Thank you, captain O'Hara.
Thank you for my beautiful wedding.

974
01:00:09,133 --> 01:00:11,074
Now with certain documents to be signed -

975
01:00:11,635 --> 01:00:13,721
- and since we set sail with the sunrise tide -

976
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:17,033
- would you mind lending me your new husband for a thrice?

977
01:00:17,296 --> 01:00:19,985
Take him captain, with all my worldly goods I hold him in debt.

978
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:36,768
I seem to recall the best man didn't kiss the bride!

979
01:00:45,097 --> 01:00:46,010
You don't like me, do you?

980
01:00:47,258 --> 01:00:48,386
Please, Mrs Ozanne.

981
01:00:48,738 --> 01:00:50,334
It's not that, I'm ...

982
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:52,708
I'm anxious about you.

983
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:53,522
Anxious?

984
01:00:54,961 --> 01:00:56,802
I've been very close to your -

985
01:00:57,332 --> 01:00:58,941
- husband for several years now.

986
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:01,241
He has changed since you knew him.

987
01:01:02,032 --> 01:01:04,719
Mr Haslam, I'm quite capable
of handling my own family.

988
01:01:05,422 --> 01:01:07,610
I merely suggest for both your sakes that -

989
01:01:08,682 --> 01:01:10,159
- you be patient with him.

990
01:01:10,756 --> 01:01:11,565
Oh, I'll be patient.

991
01:01:12,398 --> 01:01:15,431
I have no idea that my husband
loves me to distraction.

992
01:01:16,316 --> 01:01:18,380
Actually, he's never known what real love is.

993
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:20,895
And I did not travel halfway -

994
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:23,492
- around the world expecting any miracle to have improved him.

995
01:01:24,574 --> 01:01:25,145
Belive me, I ...

996
01:01:25,834 --> 01:01:27,148
... I only want to help you.

997
01:01:28,568 --> 01:01:30,022
You can, now.

998
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:34,487
Is there any reason why we can not leave
for the settlement at once instead of tomorrow?

999
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:40,588
You see, I refuse to spend my wedding
night anywhere except in the home my
husband has provided for me.

1000
01:02:00,056 --> 01:02:00,851
Oh, put it in there!

1001
01:02:05,383 --> 01:02:07,369
And as for father, poor darling,
he's as blind as a bat.

1002
01:02:08,222 --> 01:02:08,976
Here, in the cupboard.

1003
01:02:10,037 --> 01:02:11,789
But of course, that has been coming on for so long.

1004
01:02:12,272 --> 01:02:14,258
By now he hardly knows whether he can see anything or not.

1005
01:02:16,617 --> 01:02:17,758
And Marguerite, is she well?

1006
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,539
A good deal has changed from
the young girl you remember.

1007
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:22,512
And like so many beautiful women -

1008
01:02:22,727 --> 01:02:24,252
- she's become spiritually lazy.

1009
01:02:25,763 --> 01:02:27,604
She hasn't married?

1010
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:29,810
Well, she has had many offer.

1011
01:02:30,437 --> 01:02:32,572
But I don't believe she has been able
to summon the necessary emotion.

1012
01:02:33,477 --> 01:02:34,947
Hine-Moa, in the bedroom please.

1013
01:02:39,701 --> 01:02:40,438
Mr Haslam?

1014
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:44,671
Who's idea was it shipping your
timber over land on those wagons?

1015
01:02:45,752 --> 01:02:47,465
It's the only way to ship timber.

1016
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,979
Don't you know that it is always cheaper
to transport bulky goods by water?

1017
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:52,752
Excuse me.

1018
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:55,201
Now look here, Marianne. Tai knows the timber business.

1019
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:56,652
And I know the shipping business.

1020
01:02:57,189 --> 01:02:58,787
- Sit down, Mr Haslam.
- Thank you.

1021
01:03:00,015 --> 01:03:01,481
Oh, that will be all, Hine-Moa, thank you.

1022
01:03:03,921 --> 01:03:06,130
You should build barges. Large ones.

1023
01:03:06,499 --> 01:03:10,569
Float your timber to the sea down that river. From
there you can ship it to any place in the world.

1024
01:03:11,882 --> 01:03:13,445
Yes, I think that is quite possible.

1025
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,258
Well, it will cut your delievery costs by two thirds.

1026
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:19,446
I believe they would.

1027
01:03:20,726 --> 01:03:23,163
Now, Mrs Ozanne, I'm sure that you will excuse me.

1028
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:25,289
Yes of course, Mr Haslam.

1029
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:27,158
This is my wedding night.

1030
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:10,501
Miss Marguerite.

1031
01:04:11,284 --> 01:04:12,423
This one's in Mr Ozanne's handwriting.

1032
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:14,237
It must be important.

1033
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:27,056
Mrs Metivier, I want you.

1034
01:04:32,894 --> 01:04:33,630
My daughter.

1035
01:04:45,913 --> 01:04:46,546
Marguerite.

1036
01:04:47,652 --> 01:04:48,695
I have something to say.

1037
01:04:49,882 --> 01:04:51,665
Mostly Octavius for you.

1038
01:04:52,977 --> 01:04:54,874
I want Marguerite to hear it too.

1039
01:04:55,169 --> 01:04:56,507
Don't talk, Sophie dear!

1040
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:02,135
When I married you, Octavius -

1041
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:04,539
- I did not love you.

1042
01:05:05,807 --> 01:05:07,486
The marriage was forced on me by my parents.

1043
01:05:08,752 --> 01:05:09,624
Against my will.

1044
01:05:10,414 --> 01:05:11,029
Mama!

1045
01:05:11,471 --> 01:05:12,759
I was in love with another man.

1046
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,666
I came to you Octavius with a broken heart.

1047
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:18,750
Hating you.

1048
01:05:21,574 --> 01:05:23,886
But from the very beginning you were kind to me.

1049
01:05:24,827 --> 01:05:26,484
Thoughtful, generous.

1050
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:29,734
And so I began to realize -

1051
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:35,341
- that your love was bigger
than anything I had ever felt.

1052
01:05:37,217 --> 01:05:38,326
I was humble.

1053
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:40,817
And frightened in its presence.

1054
01:05:42,195 --> 01:05:44,140
But still I did not love you.

1055
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:45,611
Dear, my dear!

1056
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:48,410
There's no need to talk, no need to tell.

1057
01:05:49,235 --> 01:05:50,643
And as the years went on -

1058
01:05:51,924 --> 01:05:53,892
- something began to grow in my heart.

1059
01:05:55,703 --> 01:05:56,907
At first respect.

1060
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,019
Then gratitude.

1061
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:04,540
And the dashing young prince I once loved -

1062
01:06:06,052 --> 01:06:08,066
- faded from my dreams.

1063
01:06:10,114 --> 01:06:11,207
And suddenly -

1064
01:06:12,356 --> 01:06:13,365
- before my eyes -

1065
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:17,022
- you Octavius.

1066
01:06:18,957 --> 01:06:21,321
Feeble sized without much hair.

1067
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:24,270
No longer young.

1068
01:06:25,263 --> 01:06:26,760
But more splendid -

1069
01:06:28,389 --> 01:06:31,199
- than any dream lover a girl have ever had.

1070
01:06:35,918 --> 01:06:37,219
Do you know what I'm saying?

1071
01:06:38,172 --> 01:06:39,327
Do you, Marguerite?

1072
01:06:39,811 --> 01:06:42,015
Yes, yes I'm trying to.

1073
01:06:44,642 --> 01:06:46,204
I've come to love your father.

1074
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:48,818
With a love so deep.

1075
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:50,912
So great.

1076
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:55,049
- that nothing on Earth can compare.

1077
01:06:57,016 --> 01:06:57,704
Mama!

1078
01:06:58,484 --> 01:06:59,803
I know what you mean.

1079
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,612
Apply it to your own life.

1080
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:08,614
To your own lost love, my dear child!

1081
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:13,988
And now, Octavius.

1082
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:17,177
My dear one, I've always known, all about it.

1083
01:07:18,896 --> 01:07:19,851
Octavius!

1084
01:07:20,241 --> 01:07:22,146
Yes, even before I married you!

1085
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:24,648
My eyes were quite good then.

1086
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,083
Remember?

1087
01:07:27,165 --> 01:07:31,491
So it was impossible for me to mistake
the way you looked when his name was mentioned.

1088
01:07:33,273 --> 01:07:34,418
Yes, Marguerite.

1089
01:07:34,824 --> 01:07:38,336
I've always known your mother's
beautiful and honourable secret.

1090
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:43,397
That's why I always did
what I could for William.

1091
01:07:44,649 --> 01:07:47,120
William?
Then ...

1092
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:50,620
I was in love with William's father.

1093
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:53,575
And you?

1094
01:07:54,497 --> 01:07:55,813
You knew always?

1095
01:07:56,704 --> 01:07:59,487
If I had thought that Edmond
Ozanne would make you happy -

1096
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:02,109
- I would never have married you.

1097
01:08:02,814 --> 01:08:04,264
But I did not believe in his love.

1098
01:08:05,026 --> 01:08:06,653
But I did believe in mine!

1099
01:08:07,549 --> 01:08:11,511
I believed I'd be a better
husband. A better father.

1100
01:08:12,903 --> 01:08:13,923
Octavius!

1101
01:08:15,065 --> 01:08:16,675
You are wonderful!

1102
01:08:17,064 --> 01:08:17,531
Sophie.

1103
01:08:18,122 --> 01:08:18,863
I knew!

1104
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:21,240
Even though -

1105
01:08:21,459 --> 01:08:23,084
- you never told me before.

1106
01:08:23,953 --> 01:08:25,341
Just when.

1107
01:08:26,129 --> 01:08:27,582
You began to love me.

1108
01:08:29,282 --> 01:08:30,149
Oh, Sophie!

1109
01:08:31,313 --> 01:08:33,550
Sophie, Sophie!

1110
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:35,969
I'm so proud!

1111
01:08:36,442 --> 01:08:37,129
And happy!

1112
01:08:38,128 --> 01:08:39,568
That you did tell me!

1113
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,050
At last.

1114
01:09:07,786 --> 01:09:09,304
Leave me alone with her, dear.

1115
01:09:11,488 --> 01:09:13,097
Leave us together.

1116
01:09:14,132 --> 01:09:15,277
Marguerite.

1117
01:09:44,302 --> 01:09:45,286
Please, little one!

1118
01:09:45,865 --> 01:09:48,425
Come on, read your letter, maybe it will help.

1119
01:09:49,242 --> 01:09:50,917
Read it to me, please?

1120
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,788
"My dear sister-in-law."

1121
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,214
"I hasten to write you -

1122
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,297
- that Marianne will go to Wellington soon -

1123
01:10:04,053 --> 01:10:07,556
- where she will have the best of care -

1124
01:10:08,386 --> 01:10:12,245
- for the arrival of our child."

1125
01:10:13,091 --> 01:10:15,486
"Hoping this finds you" ...

1126
01:10:25,842 --> 01:10:26,487
My daughter.

1127
01:10:28,342 --> 01:10:29,718
May I go to my father now?

1128
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,434
Your father does not need you now.

1129
01:10:34,436 --> 01:10:35,469
Quietly -

1130
01:10:36,341 --> 01:10:37,958
- he has joined your mother.

1131
01:10:39,312 --> 01:10:40,777
God rest his soul.

1132
01:15:07,957 --> 01:15:09,264
Reverend Mother, Reverend Mother!

1133
01:15:09,748 --> 01:15:10,959
Somebody's knocking on the old door.

1134
01:15:11,246 --> 01:15:12,179
It must be Saint Peter!

1135
01:15:13,024 --> 01:15:13,725
Saint Peter?

1136
01:15:14,232 --> 01:15:16,211
Saint Peter! Come, you can hear him yourself!

1137
01:15:26,483 --> 01:15:27,179
I hear nothing?

1138
01:15:27,838 --> 01:15:29,184
But I heard Saint Peter knocking! 

1139
01:15:29,767 --> 01:15:30,903
Plese, may I unlock the door?

1140
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:31,922
It is unlocked.

1141
01:15:32,316 --> 01:15:34,285
I unlocked it myself 40 years ago.

1142
01:15:34,788 --> 01:15:35,903
Open it yourself, if you wish.

1143
01:15:48,981 --> 01:15:49,606
Pick her up.

1144
01:15:49,888 --> 01:15:50,887
Bring her to my room.

1145
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:55,698
Thank you, Reverend Mother, thank you!

1146
01:15:56,327 --> 01:15:57,107
My poor dear child.

1147
01:16:02,673 --> 01:16:05,296
Help me, help me, I'm all alone now.

1148
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:06,829
I'll try my child.

1149
01:16:07,482 --> 01:16:08,685
There's no one to turn to.

1150
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:10,849
I'm completely lost!

1151
01:16:11,922 --> 01:16:13,392
I can't think.

1152
01:16:16,954 --> 01:16:18,111
It's my mind.

1153
01:16:19,016 --> 01:16:21,329
I can't think. I can't think.

1154
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:25,180
Others have passed through
the same dark way.

1155
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:27,360
There's no way for me to live.

1156
01:16:28,064 --> 01:16:29,234
You'll find a way.

1157
01:16:30,121 --> 01:16:30,874
Child.

1158
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:34,032
Your tragedy is not unique in human history.

1159
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:42,921
I needed my father and my mother because -

1160
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,670
- because the man I loved turned away from me.

1161
01:16:48,316 --> 01:16:50,658
And now, because your parents are gone -

1162
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:53,014
- because your earthly lover has failed you -

1163
01:16:53,907 --> 01:16:56,658
- you imagine that God has also
withdrawn His presence?

1164
01:16:57,377 --> 01:16:57,973
Yes!

1165
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:02,205
The way the in which the human race
perpetuate its scorn of Our The Mighty God -

1166
01:17:02,878 --> 01:17:04,275
- is quite deplorable.

1167
01:17:06,684 --> 01:17:07,362
Come!

1168
01:17:08,213 --> 01:17:09,589
Let's see if you can stand up.

1169
01:17:10,242 --> 01:17:14,722
Yes, I can stand, I can walk, I can run.
And if I could fly it wouldn't help.

1170
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,520
Let us see if you can pray!

1171
01:17:29,538 --> 01:17:30,444
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

1172
01:17:35,415 --> 01:17:36,229
Oh, Marguerite?

1173
01:17:37,632 --> 01:17:38,257
Marguerite?

1174
01:17:40,057 --> 01:17:41,321
I have a little book here.

1175
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,856
I read it myself when I was about your age.

1176
01:17:44,322 --> 01:17:44,820
Read it!

1177
01:17:46,219 --> 01:17:48,667
Then - we may talk again!

1178
01:18:26,934 --> 01:18:27,873
That's a nice job of loading, William!

1179
01:18:30,102 --> 01:18:30,951
Cleverly planned.

1180
01:18:31,917 --> 01:18:33,010
Yeah, my wife's idea.

1181
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:38,133
This was hers idea, not yours I suppose, the
two of you sat up all night arguing about it?

1182
01:18:39,286 --> 01:18:41,798
Tai, I promised you I'd stick to my
bargain but I didn't agree to like it.

1183
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,928
Yes, Mr Haslam, you've come to
apologize for William again?

1184
01:19:04,521 --> 01:19:04,950
No.

1185
01:19:07,304 --> 01:19:08,510
I've brought you a gift.

1186
01:19:29,043 --> 01:19:30,316
Thank you, Mr Haslam!

1187
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:32,410
Thank you!

1188
01:19:42,266 --> 01:19:43,655
Why do you dislike me so much?

1189
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:46,101
Cause you have too much influence with William!

1190
01:19:47,641 --> 01:19:49,579
I've only been able to influence
William on only one thing.

1191
01:19:50,843 --> 01:19:52,516
Not to give up when he takes on a job.

1192
01:19:52,941 --> 01:19:54,610
Alright, I failed in my marriage.

1193
01:19:55,517 --> 01:19:58,131
And you think I'm making you
the scapegoat for my failure?

1194
01:19:58,515 --> 01:19:59,329
Your marriage is not a failure!

1195
01:20:00,284 --> 01:20:01,312
My husband hates me!

1196
01:20:02,796 --> 01:20:04,166
If I told you that hatred -

1197
01:20:04,521 --> 01:20:06,005
- was only the reverse side of love -

1198
01:20:07,353 --> 01:20:09,026
- you'd ridicule me as usual.

1199
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:10,655
It's not true.

1200
01:20:11,822 --> 01:20:13,414
You can no more separate love from hatred -

1201
01:20:13,696 --> 01:20:15,343
- than you can separate the two sides  of a coin.

1202
01:20:15,586 --> 01:20:16,820
To possess one is to possess the other.

1203
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,094
But I don't want scientific explanations.

1204
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:22,510
What do you want?

1205
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:26,088
What do I want?

1206
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,762
I love my husband to the point of agony.

1207
01:20:31,972 --> 01:20:34,402
Yet there's no brightness,
no warmth in our lives.

1208
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:37,496
What do I want?

1209
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:39,847
Tell me, Mr Haslam.

1210
01:20:40,577 --> 01:20:42,847
Have I been completly wrong
in my handling of William?

1211
01:20:43,825 --> 01:20:46,578
Or isn't it true that he is
infinitely a finer and better person?

1212
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:48,937
That's very true, he has improved!

1213
01:20:51,171 --> 01:20:52,359
But you think he would be happier if -

1214
01:20:52,703 --> 01:20:54,874
- I was more submissive and helpless.

1215
01:20:58,515 --> 01:21:00,142
It would be a strange way to wane
a husband away from his weaknesses.

1216
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:03,351
- by developing weaknesses of my own.

1217
01:21:06,371 --> 01:21:07,432
Marianne? Marianne?

1218
01:21:19,037 --> 01:21:19,725
William?

1219
01:21:24,071 --> 01:21:24,965
About last night ...

1220
01:21:25,244 --> 01:21:25,856
I'm sorry, Marianne!

1221
01:21:27,352 --> 01:21:29,842
William, have I been a bad influence on you?

1222
01:21:31,259 --> 01:21:33,076
No man could have a better wife!

1223
01:21:34,324 --> 01:21:34,852
Perhaps ...

1224
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:37,957
Perhaps the boy will help you when he comes?

1225
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:39,425
You sure it's gonna be a boy?

1226
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,475
I believe you'd rather have a girl?

1227
01:21:41,968 --> 01:21:43,333
It's going to be a boy, I know it!

1228
01:21:45,891 --> 01:21:46,410
William.

1229
01:21:47,864 --> 01:21:49,887
Please let Mr Haslam take the barges this time.

1230
01:21:50,282 --> 01:21:51,061
Stay here with me.

1231
01:21:51,486 --> 01:21:52,689
Cutting the timber is Tai's job.

1232
01:21:53,287 --> 01:21:54,415
Taking it to market is mine.

1233
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,393
You know The Green Dolphin be
waiting at the sea coast for this timber.

1234
01:22:00,676 --> 01:22:03,353
Captain O'Hara is expecting me. I can't let him down!

1235
01:22:06,299 --> 01:22:08,206
William, William, what's happened to us?

1236
01:22:09,895 --> 01:22:11,116
Even when we're in each other's arms -

1237
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:14,739
- there always seem to be a thousand miles between us!

1238
01:22:16,209 --> 01:22:17,051
Look, Marianne.

1239
01:22:18,388 --> 01:22:20,169
I've been a clumsy fool and I've made you wretched.

1240
01:22:21,326 --> 01:22:23,605
If you forgive me, I promise I'll try to do better.

1241
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:25,857
Yes, yes, William!

1242
01:22:29,182 --> 01:22:30,620
Goodbye, Marianne.

1243
01:22:35,085 --> 01:22:36,204
Forward!

1244
01:23:13,747 --> 01:23:14,681
So we're left alone together.

1245
01:23:17,152 --> 01:23:17,995
Not for the first time.

1246
01:23:19,421 --> 01:23:22,372
As a rule I see very little of you on these occasions.

1247
01:23:23,152 --> 01:23:24,949
Perhaps this time I shall see more?

1248
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:32,029
Mr Haslam, will you please make
those natives stop singing?

1249
01:23:34,247 --> 01:23:36,611
No, that is the chant of the earthquake God.

1250
01:23:37,908 --> 01:23:39,091
The native's believe there
is to be an earthquake.

1251
01:23:40,405 --> 01:23:42,669
But William does not believe it.
And I imagine you don't belive it?

1252
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:45,576
But when your house starts shaking -

1253
01:23:46,486 --> 01:23:49,594
- stand in the nearest doorway.
And yell for me!

1254
01:24:09,582 --> 01:24:11,882
The men have stopped working.
Go and see what's happened.

1255
01:27:31,801 --> 01:27:33,646
We should see the coast around the next bend.

1256
01:28:16,484 --> 01:28:18,098
Big sea!

1257
01:28:18,827 --> 01:28:19,813
Yeah.

1258
01:28:48,635 --> 01:28:49,565
Watch out! Watch out!

1259
01:29:15,514 --> 01:29:16,225
My son!

1260
01:29:17,305 --> 01:29:18,335
I shall lose my son!

1261
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,650
You'll have your son.

1262
01:29:20,867 --> 01:29:22,953
No, it's too soon!

1263
01:29:24,576 --> 01:29:25,650
Tai, get a doctor!

1264
01:29:26,179 --> 01:29:28,102
This isn't a country where a doctor lives on the next street.

1265
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:30,677
My son!

1266
01:29:32,878 --> 01:29:34,941
- I thought I'd at least ...
- Marianne, listen to me!

1267
01:29:35,724 --> 01:29:37,632
You'll have your child, I know what's to be done.

1268
01:29:38,176 --> 01:29:38,651
What?

1269
01:29:39,819 --> 01:29:41,185
Oh no, no!

1270
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:42,445
You've got to trust me!

1271
01:29:43,162 --> 01:29:46,602
Remember this is the sort of thing
that happens to women who chose to
live in the backblocks.

1272
01:29:47,102 --> 01:29:48,678
And remember you chose it.

1273
01:29:50,944 --> 01:29:51,868
Oh, I trust you!

1274
01:29:54,882 --> 01:29:56,292
I will try to give -

1275
01:29:57,698 --> 01:30:00,220
- to give as little trouble as possible.

1276
01:30:16,246 --> 01:30:19,888
First news from the backblocks.
Horrible disaster.

1277
01:30:20,512 --> 01:30:21,638
The Green Dolphin is missing.

1278
01:30:22,262 --> 01:30:23,027
Here you are, first
news from the backblocks.

1279
01:30:23,504 --> 01:30:26,171
Horrible disaster,
The Green Dolphin is missing.

1280
01:30:26,949 --> 01:30:28,640
For three weeks only meager details.

1281
01:30:29,453 --> 01:30:31,512
The worst catastrophe
in New Zealand history.

1282
01:30:50,909 --> 01:30:51,764
Exquisite!

1283
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:54,450
Now you look a bit more like your old self!

1284
01:30:55,606 --> 01:30:57,483
This is no time for compliments, Mr Haslam!

1285
01:30:59,142 --> 01:31:00,951
Tell me, is there any definite news of William?

1286
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:03,546
Yes, this time there is definite news.

1287
01:31:04,483 --> 01:31:06,044
Your husband is alive, he's quite safe.

1288
01:31:07,484 --> 01:31:10,956
The barges were wrecked in the tidal wave
but he was able to make his way into Wellington.

1289
01:31:11,694 --> 01:31:12,358
You're not lying?

1290
01:31:12,735 --> 01:31:13,817
You swear you are telling the truth -

1291
01:31:14,017 --> 01:31:14,717
- William is alright?

1292
01:31:14,985 --> 01:31:16,297
I'd give you my word, now be calm!

1293
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:17,580
But I am calm!

1294
01:31:19,068 --> 01:31:20,666
I have complete control of myself.

1295
01:31:21,812 --> 01:31:24,708
My mental and physical condition is remarkable, Mr Haslam.

1296
01:31:28,112 --> 01:31:28,969
It's no good, Marianne.

1297
01:31:29,393 --> 01:31:31,823
In this situation we can't go back to where we were!

1298
01:31:32,649 --> 01:31:33,810
Why not be friends?

1299
01:31:36,556 --> 01:31:37,874
I'm not aware we're not friends!

1300
01:31:55,168 --> 01:31:55,939
William!

1301
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:02,719
Marianne, what a terrible time you've had!

1302
01:32:03,904 --> 01:32:07,593
- But William, there...
- There were so many days -

1303
01:32:07,841 --> 01:32:09,386
- before I knew that anyone here was alive!

1304
01:32:14,906 --> 01:32:15,822
I'm in such a filthy state.

1305
01:32:16,919 --> 01:32:18,598
I should have washed and changed.

1306
01:32:19,111 --> 01:32:21,721
- But I...
- But you were so anxious to see your child.

1307
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:25,511
Well William, there she is!

1308
01:32:26,387 --> 01:32:27,095
She?

1309
01:32:27,782 --> 01:32:29,782
She! Is it a girl?

1310
01:32:30,106 --> 01:32:30,777
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

1311
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:32,490
Why wasn't I told? A girl!

1312
01:32:33,004 --> 01:32:35,412
I had no idea your daughter
would mean so much to you!

1313
01:32:35,714 --> 01:32:36,881
You can tell she's gonna be fair haired!

1314
01:32:37,213 --> 01:32:38,737
Look at those eyes!

1315
01:32:39,099 --> 01:32:40,713
Yes, I've named her Marguerite Veronica.

1316
01:32:42,911 --> 01:32:44,303
But we'll call her Veronica?

1317
01:32:47,633 --> 01:32:48,842
Time baby's bath!

1318
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:50,452
You may take her, Hine-Moa.

1319
01:32:57,126 --> 01:32:57,987
What's wrong, William?

1320
01:32:59,486 --> 01:33:00,102
Marianne.

1321
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:02,363
Captain O'Hara is dead.

1322
01:33:04,574 --> 01:33:05,207
Dead?

1323
01:33:06,115 --> 01:33:06,739
Drowned.

1324
01:33:09,115 --> 01:33:09,958
And the Green Dolphin?

1325
01:33:10,916 --> 01:33:11,772
That's gone too.

1326
01:33:12,989 --> 01:33:13,599
Tell me!

1327
01:33:14,384 --> 01:33:16,637
The Green Dolphin was wrecked by the tidal wave.

1328
01:33:17,178 --> 01:33:18,772
I... I swam out with a rope.

1329
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:21,071
How dared you, you
might have been drowned!

1330
01:33:21,582 --> 01:33:22,803
You should have thought
of your wife and your child!

1331
01:33:23,648 --> 01:33:25,617
Captain O'Hara insisted
on being the last ashore.

1332
01:33:26,146 --> 01:33:27,600
He stood on the quarter
deck bellowing orders.

1333
01:33:28,475 --> 01:33:30,328
Then suddenly before you
could say "Jack Robinson".

1334
01:33:30,913 --> 01:33:32,194
The Green Dolphin heeled over -

1335
01:33:32,462 --> 01:33:33,432
- and was gone.

1336
01:33:33,648 --> 01:33:34,744
And him with it.

1337
01:33:35,203 --> 01:33:36,354
I swam out again.

1338
01:33:36,788 --> 01:33:37,773
I couldn't save him.

1339
01:33:39,139 --> 01:33:41,120
But I think he knows I tried!

1340
01:33:41,948 --> 01:33:43,386
And you have paid your debt to him.

1341
01:33:44,121 --> 01:33:45,611
I'm proud of you William!

1342
01:33:47,587 --> 01:33:48,401
Captain O'Hara!

1343
01:33:49,673 --> 01:33:50,558
Green Dolphin.

1344
01:33:51,621 --> 01:33:52,965
The last tie with -

1345
01:33:53,746 --> 01:33:55,797
- home gone.

1346
01:33:56,588 --> 01:33:58,402
Everything else is gone too, Marianne.

1347
01:34:00,405 --> 01:34:03,434
Years of hard work destroyed in a single day.

1348
01:34:05,342 --> 01:34:06,405
We begin again.

1349
01:34:07,858 --> 01:34:09,239
We begin again, William.

1350
01:34:09,905 --> 01:34:11,064
And we'll do better!

1351
01:34:11,157 --> 01:34:11,738
We certainly will!

1352
01:34:14,606 --> 01:34:16,503
The several passing years see New Zealand -

1353
01:34:16,763 --> 01:34:18,921
- swept by the fierce tides of a raw new world -

1354
01:34:19,549 --> 01:34:21,911
- raging in violent ebb and flow.

1355
01:34:25,516 --> 01:34:27,202
"MAORI WAR BREAKS OUT AGAIN"

1356
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,549
"NATIVES BURN VILLAGE NEAR AUCKLAND"

1357
01:34:31,336 --> 01:34:33,425
"TROOPS TO DEFEND WELLINGTON"

1358
01:35:14,188 --> 01:35:14,723
"Mr Haslam."

1359
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:17,690
"A native friend of yours sends secret warning" -

1360
01:35:17,911 --> 01:35:20,439
- "to expect hostilities in
your neighborhood at any moment."

1361
01:35:22,897 --> 01:35:23,502
William?

1362
01:35:24,504 --> 01:35:26,222
Tell me, do you think
this is reassuring enough?

1363
01:35:27,271 --> 01:35:30,223
"My dear Marguerite, do not
worry about the Maori war."

1364
01:35:30,629 --> 01:35:33,728
"True, it still goes on up... north."

1365
01:35:34,028 --> 01:35:36,754
"Because the natives who want to
sell their land to the white settlers" -

1366
01:35:37,036 --> 01:35:39,083
- "are now killing Maoris who don't want to sell."

1367
01:35:40,684 --> 01:35:43,319
"But the new governor expect to
work out a treaty of peace" - 

1368
01:35:43,757 --> 01:35:45,509
- "which is probably accomplished by now".

1369
01:35:46,428 --> 01:35:48,134
Aren't you a bit too optimistic,
even for Marguerite?

1370
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:49,821
Peace can be arranged!

1371
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:51,408
I could do it if I were the governor.

1372
01:35:52,258 --> 01:35:53,197
You probably could!

1373
01:35:53,992 --> 01:35:54,835
Hello there!

1374
01:35:56,934 --> 01:35:57,962
Uncle Tai!

1375
01:36:00,323 --> 01:36:01,281
Uncle Tai!

1376
01:36:01,917 --> 01:36:03,292
Well, you didn't come in to see me today!

1377
01:36:08,108 --> 01:36:09,072
I've got some news for you.

1378
01:36:09,734 --> 01:36:10,511
Let's go inside.

1379
01:36:17,889 --> 01:36:19,074
Heavy fighting has broken out again.

1380
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:22,546
Marianne and Veronica must
leave for Wellington at once.

1381
01:36:22,815 --> 01:36:23,231
Why?

1382
01:36:23,232 --> 01:36:24,155
But the peace terms?

1383
01:36:24,156 --> 01:36:25,078
The governor has blundered badly.

1384
01:36:25,547 --> 01:36:27,310
We have men and guns, we will fight!

1385
01:36:27,654 --> 01:36:28,622
You must take Veronica to Wellington!

1386
01:36:28,851 --> 01:36:29,983
We'll build a stockade around the house.

1387
01:36:30,233 --> 01:36:31,570
And turn this place into a fort?

1388
01:36:31,926 --> 01:36:32,359
- Certainly!
- That would -

1389
01:36:32,562 --> 01:36:33,632
- be the worst possible mistake.

1390
01:36:33,754 --> 01:36:35,599
To show our friendly Maoris we don't trust them.

1391
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:37,425
You argue with your wife.

1392
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,789
She never would listen to me.

1393
01:36:39,142 --> 01:36:40,952
You must take Veronica to Wellington,
don't you see that?

1394
01:36:41,281 --> 01:36:42,439
I see nothing of the sort!

1395
01:36:42,736 --> 01:36:43,688
Veronica and I stay here!

1396
01:36:44,313 --> 01:36:46,206
Stop and think, Tai, you realize that I'm right!

1397
01:36:46,632 --> 01:36:49,446
Veronica and I are far more likely
to be murdered on a long journey to Wellington!

1398
01:36:49,769 --> 01:36:51,439
And if we stay here we'll be well protected.

1399
01:36:51,987 --> 01:36:53,333
There's something about that, Tai!

1400
01:36:53,551 --> 01:36:55,884
As always I bow to your clever reasoning.

1401
01:36:57,332 --> 01:36:58,552
May I do anything for you in Wellington?

1402
01:36:59,251 --> 01:37:00,035
Are you going to Wellington?

1403
01:37:00,476 --> 01:37:01,102
Yes, I am.

1404
01:37:01,834 --> 01:37:03,537
William, may I see you outside for a moment, please?

1405
01:37:06,181 --> 01:37:07,323
Marianne, please!

1406
01:37:07,555 --> 01:37:08,229
What is all this?

1407
01:37:09,052 --> 01:37:10,208
Are you trying to get rid of me?

1408
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:15,708
- Good night, daddy!
- Good night, sweetheart!

1409
01:37:16,893 --> 01:37:18,909
- Good night, mama!
- Good night, dear!

1410
01:37:29,755 --> 01:37:31,221
Good night, Hine-Moa!

1411
01:37:45,958 --> 01:37:46,881
Well, pray for the best.

1412
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:50,664
Tai's gone and without him we'd never dare make the trip to Wellington.

1413
01:37:51,226 --> 01:37:53,790
Then get out every man you have and start building that stockade!

1414
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:14,792
Come Veronica, your dinner.

1415
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:16,717
Come here.

1416
01:38:37,946 --> 01:38:41,086
Veronica! Veronica dear! 

1417
01:38:42,371 --> 01:38:43,402
Come, you must wake up.

1418
01:38:45,685 --> 01:38:46,893
No, no, there...

1419
01:40:09,433 --> 01:40:10,308
Marianne!

1420
01:40:35,878 --> 01:40:37,242
Can you forgive me, William?

1421
01:40:38,192 --> 01:40:39,287
It was all my fault.

1422
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:41,225
I wouldn't go to Wellington.

1423
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:43,851
I made you build that stupid stockade.

1424
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:48,523
No, you didn't make me. You honestly convinced me.

1425
01:40:49,153 --> 01:40:50,603
So don't blame yourself only.

1426
01:40:50,959 --> 01:40:52,227
We're both guilty.

1427
01:41:09,151 --> 01:41:10,263
I'm afraid, daddy!

1428
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:12,561
Shhh!

1429
01:41:17,318 --> 01:41:18,563
Well thank heavens you're alright!

1430
01:41:18,847 --> 01:41:20,654
- How did you get through? 
- Be quite and listen!

1431
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:22,391
When I went to Wellington for help -

1432
01:41:22,645 --> 01:41:23,898
- I expected this invasion from the northern tribes.

1433
01:41:24,252 --> 01:41:25,494
But our own Maoris turned on us!

1434
01:41:25,906 --> 01:41:27,205
And for good reason. Now that's our chance.

1435
01:41:27,783 --> 01:41:29,376
Our own Maoris are out there among the others.

1436
01:41:29,611 --> 01:41:31,905
And they're still my friends. They were strong enough to get me in here.

1437
01:41:32,143 --> 01:41:32,910
Oh William, then everthing ...

1438
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:35,508
Whether they have the influence to get us out I don't know.

1439
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:37,635
They're in council now, that's why it's so quiet.

1440
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:38,618
But what if they won't?

1441
01:41:38,821 --> 01:41:40,071
It's a chance we'll have to take!

1442
01:41:40,508 --> 01:41:42,200
Chance? But Veronica!

1443
01:43:34,213 --> 01:43:36,341
179 pounds 11 shillings 3d.

1444
01:43:36,986 --> 01:43:37,964
That's a good account.

1445
01:43:39,042 --> 01:43:40,310
Well, how do we stand financially?

1446
01:43:41,135 --> 01:43:44,051
I should say we have enough capital in the
bank to start ourselves another future.

1447
01:43:51,591 --> 01:43:52,842
No, we can forget that one.

1448
01:43:54,031 --> 01:43:55,940
You know, I've been thinking about our future.

1449
01:43:56,374 --> 01:43:57,858
The Maori wars are getting worse.

1450
01:43:58,439 --> 01:43:59,428
I think it would be best if -

1451
01:44:00,264 --> 01:44:01,938
- well, if we were to leave here and go south.

1452
01:44:03,379 --> 01:44:04,563
South Island?

1453
01:44:04,967 --> 01:44:06,596
I've been thinking I said, I haven't decided!

1454
01:44:07,552 --> 01:44:08,383
Let's talk it over.

1455
01:44:09,566 --> 01:44:10,815
John Martin...

1456
01:44:11,884 --> 01:44:14,830
What are the timber prospects on South Island?

1457
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:16,880
Bad!

1458
01:44:17,409 --> 01:44:19,070
But there's a great future for sheep farming.

1459
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:20,285
Sheep?

1460
01:44:20,867 --> 01:44:22,867
What exactly have you got in mind, Marianne?

1461
01:44:23,443 --> 01:44:27,132
To sell our land and take a ship to the
South Island. Find some good pasture land.

1462
01:44:27,614 --> 01:44:29,368
Spend our capital on it, hire expert labour.

1463
01:44:29,632 --> 01:44:31,598
Soon there be nothing about sheep we won't know.

1464
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:34,745
Why sheep? I know timber, I love it.
Why can't we stick to timber?

1465
01:44:35,194 --> 01:44:36,348
Because there's a bigger future in wool!

1466
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:38,349
How do you know that?

1467
01:44:38,746 --> 01:44:40,193
Because I've an instinct for these things.

1468
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:41,990
An instinct for making money.

1469
01:44:43,432 --> 01:44:44,528
Personally I can never think of sheep -

1470
01:44:44,849 --> 01:44:46,536
- without connecting them with Job in the Bible.

1471
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:50,445
One time Job lost all his sheep; had boils.

1472
01:44:50,835 --> 01:44:52,321
That was just one bad year.

1473
01:44:53,095 --> 01:44:56,880
How much of this is your business instinct
and how much is the safety of Veronica?

1474
01:45:07,523 --> 01:45:08,994
It's mostly for the child's sake.

1475
01:45:09,816 --> 01:45:12,480
Ever since the Maori trouble she's
been having dreadful nightmares.

1476
01:45:13,067 --> 01:45:13,929
You know that, William.

1477
01:45:14,743 --> 01:45:17,782
She has a morbid curiosity now
about fighting and soldiers.

1478
01:45:18,426 --> 01:45:19,836
I want to take her where there is no fighting.

1479
01:45:21,865 --> 01:45:26,345
Yes Tai, it's uncanny the way you
always bring a hammer down on the nail.

1480
01:45:27,659 --> 01:45:29,002
It's really for Veronica's sake!

1481
01:45:30,954 --> 01:45:31,672
Well?

1482
01:45:33,741 --> 01:45:34,391
Well William?

1483
01:45:36,098 --> 01:45:37,758
If it is for Veronica's good
that we should go south -

1484
01:45:38,412 --> 01:45:39,433
- we go south!

1485
01:45:40,495 --> 01:45:42,783
Here's to the flocks and herds of Job.

1486
01:45:44,484 --> 01:45:45,937
And no boils!

1487
01:45:47,814 --> 01:45:49,032
We'll go as soon as possible.

1488
01:45:50,546 --> 01:45:53,535
There's a great suffering among my
Maori friends caused by the Colonials.

1489
01:45:54,566 --> 01:45:55,642
They need help.

1490
01:45:56,522 --> 01:45:58,349
I'm going back to them with medical supplies.

1491
01:45:59,619 --> 01:46:01,223
Tai, we can not wait indefinitely ...

1492
01:46:01,519 --> 01:46:03,413
I will not prevent you from leaving whenever you like!

1493
01:46:04,003 --> 01:46:05,933
And all my best wishes will go with you.

1494
01:46:06,308 --> 01:46:07,150
But you are our partner!

1495
01:46:07,536 --> 01:46:08,252
Surely you'll come with us?

1496
01:46:09,975 --> 01:46:11,340
You don't know me very well, Marianne.

1497
01:46:12,871 --> 01:46:14,426
I find very little value in life -

1498
01:46:14,677 --> 01:46:16,256
- beside from my personal independence.

1499
01:46:17,917 --> 01:46:20,162
That you and William should
join me in my lumber business -

1500
01:46:21,178 --> 01:46:22,114
- that was one thing.

1501
01:46:22,939 --> 01:46:24,689
That I should follow along at the tail end of your -

1502
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:28,096
- biblical migration like a tamed tabby cat -

1503
01:46:29,095 --> 01:46:30,188
- that is another.

1504
01:46:34,633 --> 01:46:36,039
There you are, darling!

1505
01:46:36,406 --> 01:46:37,552
Say goodby to uncle Tai, Veronica.

1506
01:46:39,499 --> 01:46:41,095
I'll go aboard and see about the luggage.

1507
01:46:41,597 --> 01:46:44,239
Oh, and Marianne, try not to fight with
Tai your last five minutes together!

1508
01:46:45,151 --> 01:46:46,119
I'll try!

1509
01:46:46,718 --> 01:46:47,753
Come, sweetheart.

1510
01:46:54,945 --> 01:46:56,696
Are you really hurt that I'm not coming with you?

1511
01:46:57,402 --> 01:46:58,164
Yes, I am.

1512
01:47:00,104 --> 01:47:02,333
I thought you had a real affection
for William and Veronica!

1513
01:47:03,104 --> 01:47:03,649
I have.

1514
01:47:04,915 --> 01:47:05,569
And for you.

1515
01:47:07,803 --> 01:47:08,810
Then why not come with us?

1516
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:10,403
The reason I gave.

1517
01:47:11,729 --> 01:47:13,102
You spoke of trailing after us.

1518
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:15,874
You'd be what you've always been,
a central figure in the picture.

1519
01:47:16,946 --> 01:47:19,481
I thought Marianne Ozanne must always be there.

1520
01:47:21,182 --> 01:47:23,696
No, I... I know myself better than I used to.

1521
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:24,983
I'm sure.

1522
01:47:25,247 --> 01:47:26,751
I really don't how I should manage without you.

1523
01:47:27,064 --> 01:47:27,708
I doubt it.

1524
01:47:27,984 --> 01:47:29,345
Don't talking of losing your independence.

1525
01:47:31,562 --> 01:47:34,286
A man in love has no independence worth mentioning.

1526
01:47:36,078 --> 01:47:37,489
Yes, Marianne, I love you.

1527
01:47:38,584 --> 01:47:39,585
I have for years.

1528
01:47:46,337 --> 01:47:48,477
You certainly didn't love me when I first came out here.

1529
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:50,132
Long before that.

1530
01:47:50,519 --> 01:47:51,317
At home on the island.

1531
01:47:51,318 --> 01:47:52,689
When you were a little girl in your teens.

1532
01:47:53,906 --> 01:47:55,165
I used to worship you from a distance.

1533
01:47:56,195 --> 01:47:56,799
On the island?

1534
01:47:57,617 --> 01:47:59,365
William never told me you came from St Pierre!

1535
01:48:00,323 --> 01:48:01,273
That's no coincidence.

1536
01:48:01,615 --> 01:48:03,043
Captain O'Hara brought us to the same place -

1537
01:48:03,336 --> 01:48:04,325
- for similar reasons.

1538
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,461
I can never go home there.

1539
01:48:08,169 --> 01:48:09,750
I began by loving you as a child.

1540
01:48:10,896 --> 01:48:12,778
I love your faults as well as your virtues.

1541
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,581
Have I still so many faults?

1542
01:48:17,501 --> 01:48:19,680
At least I'm not proud now, am I?

1543
01:48:20,109 --> 01:48:20,937
No, you're not.

1544
01:48:21,852 --> 01:48:23,243
I love you for that too because -

1545
01:48:24,659 --> 01:48:26,161
- I think I had something to do with it.

1546
01:48:28,618 --> 01:48:29,563
Yes, you did.

1547
01:48:30,554 --> 01:48:30,864
A great deal.

1548
01:48:31,690 --> 01:48:32,460
Everything.

1549
01:48:33,034 --> 01:48:34,094
And that's why you love me.

1550
01:48:35,053 --> 01:48:36,222
Oh, you hated me too!

1551
01:48:37,382 --> 01:48:41,900
Remember what I said that you could
no more separate love from hatred
than separate the two sides of a coin?

1552
01:48:43,246 --> 01:48:46,059
Well, you hated me because I saw
too much of your real self.

1553
01:48:46,606 --> 01:48:48,062
Then I found when you were with me -

1554
01:48:48,592 --> 01:48:49,312
- everything was alright.

1555
01:48:50,272 --> 01:48:51,818
You learned humility from me.

1556
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,164
And you love me, don't you?

1557
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,852
Tai, I love William with
every fibre of my being.

1558
01:48:59,441 --> 01:49:00,380
But I love you too.

1559
01:49:00,979 --> 01:49:03,457
For the qualities you have that
I've tried to develop in him.

1560
01:49:04,862 --> 01:49:05,914
Yes, Tai, I love you.

1561
01:49:07,055 --> 01:49:08,113
But I belong to William.

1562
01:49:09,146 --> 01:49:10,177
You still believe that?

1563
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:11,355
It's true!

1564
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,505
William's love is all I ever wanted.

1565
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:14,887
That's why I'm not going with you.

1566
01:49:15,791 --> 01:49:17,805
You'll have more chance of getting what you want if -

1567
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,182
- he has no one to turn to but you.

1568
01:49:20,869 --> 01:49:21,639
But I have his love.

1569
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:22,882
Don't be too sure.

1570
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:27,230
This newfound humility of yours only goes skin deep.

1571
01:49:28,217 --> 01:49:29,221
You have made progress, but -

1572
01:49:30,761 --> 01:49:32,090
- your battle isn't won yet.

1573
01:49:33,924 --> 01:49:34,889
Goodbye, Marianne.

1574
01:49:36,532 --> 01:49:37,483
I won't forget you.

1575
01:49:38,168 --> 01:49:38,849
Ever.

1576
01:49:46,012 --> 01:49:46,973
If I believed in souls -

1577
01:49:48,421 --> 01:49:52,263
- I'd say that yours and mine are very long aquaintances.

1578
01:50:04,701 --> 01:50:05,586
Veronica is in the cabin.

1579
01:50:14,728 --> 01:50:15,384
Goodbye, William.

1580
01:50:16,322 --> 01:50:17,950
You're glad to get rid of a
couple of trouble makers, eh?

1581
01:50:18,813 --> 01:50:20,359
I'd not have missed these years for anything!

1582
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:21,943
Not always happy.

1583
01:50:22,263 --> 01:50:24,233
All those rousing arguments. 
I wonder how you stood it?

1584
01:50:24,936 --> 01:50:26,631
Well, the adjustments interested me.

1585
01:50:28,266 --> 01:50:29,735
You've made a good job with Marianne.

1586
01:50:30,361 --> 01:50:33,489
Most people including Marianne would
say she'd made a good job out of me.

1587
01:50:34,298 --> 01:50:36,348
Only a fool could have made
that blunder that you did.

1588
01:50:37,508 --> 01:50:39,723
But only a very fine man could
have saved her from disaster.

1589
01:50:40,663 --> 01:50:42,984
Disaster, Marianne?

1590
01:50:43,766 --> 01:50:45,954
If you hadn't turned your life
into a magnificent lie -

1591
01:50:46,266 --> 01:50:47,613
- she'd have certainly floundered.

1592
01:50:49,051 --> 01:50:52,926
And if you hadn't made that idiotic
mistake in a girl's name I'd never known her.

1593
01:50:57,569 --> 01:50:58,492
Ready Mr Ozanne?

1594
01:50:58,832 --> 01:51:00,042
We're about to cast off, Sir.

1595
01:51:02,269 --> 01:51:03,082
Well.

1596
01:51:14,377 --> 01:51:15,959
Reverend Mother?

1597
01:51:17,043 --> 01:51:18,458
What is it, sister Angelique?

1598
01:51:19,138 --> 01:51:20,365
A lady to see you, Reverend Mother.

1599
01:51:21,147 --> 01:51:22,618
She sends you this little book.

1600
01:51:34,575 --> 01:51:35,687
Sit down, Marguerite.

1601
01:51:36,564 --> 01:51:37,623
It's a long time.

1602
01:51:38,513 --> 01:51:39,297
You've read it?

1603
01:51:40,514 --> 01:51:41,452
Over and over!

1604
01:51:41,877 --> 01:51:44,032
To see if there is some way for me to live.

1605
01:51:45,317 --> 01:51:47,349
I seem to have given up
all my girlhood friends.

1606
01:51:48,622 --> 01:51:49,868
I've dropped out of all life.

1607
01:51:51,503 --> 01:51:53,496
I belong to nothing or nobody.

1608
01:51:53,964 --> 01:51:54,432
And yet -

1609
01:51:54,912 --> 01:51:56,975
- you do not look so very unhappy?

1610
01:51:57,824 --> 01:51:58,748
I'm not unhappy!

1611
01:51:59,224 --> 01:52:00,836
I'm only... lost.

1612
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:03,162
But I want to feel once again -

1613
01:52:03,429 --> 01:52:04,755
- that I'm following some pattern of life.

1614
01:52:05,771 --> 01:52:09,540
Sometime God permits deep
disappointment to enter our lives.

1615
01:52:10,289 --> 01:52:12,977
In order to open up our eyes to what He wants us to do.

1616
01:52:14,106 --> 01:52:15,575
And so great is His magnanimity -

1617
01:52:16,435 --> 01:52:18,212
- that if we come at last to His feet.

1618
01:52:19,025 --> 01:52:21,867
- I think he cares little how we came.

1619
01:52:22,432 --> 01:52:24,228
Am I good enough, Reverend Mother?

1620
01:52:25,168 --> 01:52:26,979
Ask yourself, my daughter.

1621
01:52:28,002 --> 01:52:29,875
Keep asking yourself.

1622
01:52:56,983 --> 01:52:59,778
- This is the residency of Mrs William Ozanne?
- Yes?

1623
01:53:00,292 --> 01:53:01,667
With compliments of Captain Fawcett.

1624
01:53:02,089 --> 01:53:03,459
Of Her Majesty's ship Brighton.

1625
01:53:03,865 --> 01:53:04,778
What you doing tonight?

1626
01:53:05,542 --> 01:53:07,381
What sauce, I wouldn't go out with you!

1627
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:09,678
Besides, we've got a party on!

1628
01:53:22,179 --> 01:53:22,930
Thank you, Lucy.

1629
01:53:32,269 --> 01:53:34,074
Listen mama, Mr Anderson
is making a speech!

1630
01:53:34,592 --> 01:53:35,306
Yes dear.

1631
01:53:35,673 --> 01:53:36,259
Gentlemen!

1632
01:53:36,957 --> 01:53:41,655
Two years ago this group sponsored the
organization of a steam ship company.

1633
01:53:42,058 --> 01:53:45,887
Ay, look what the shares are quoted at today!

1634
01:53:47,558 --> 01:53:53,886
Of course the original idea came from Mr William Ozanne.

1635
01:53:53,973 --> 01:53:55,315
You know...

1636
01:53:55,646 --> 01:53:58,213
I'm thinking he must have
Scottish antecedence!

1637
01:54:00,043 --> 01:54:00,654
Gentlemen!

1638
01:54:01,754 --> 01:54:04,697
I give you the health of the
most popular man in Dunedin!

1639
01:54:05,535 --> 01:54:06,987
Mr William Ozanne.

1640
01:54:07,878 --> 01:54:09,379
To William Ozanne!

1641
01:54:21,243 --> 01:54:22,146
Thank you, gentlemen!

1642
01:54:23,543 --> 01:54:26,359
I think your toast might well be to New Zealand.

1643
01:54:27,071 --> 01:54:31,023
Or to the steamship itself,
which Mr Anderson so cannily puts -

1644
01:54:32,054 --> 01:54:34,180
- has done so much good for all of us.

1645
01:54:36,478 --> 01:54:38,668
But certainly instead of me -

1646
01:54:39,841 --> 01:54:42,736
- I think your toast should
have been given to my wife.

1647
01:54:43,817 --> 01:54:46,258
Because in New Zealand or Timbuktu -

1648
01:54:46,571 --> 01:54:49,474
- with sheep, wool, steam or with timber -

1649
01:54:49,789 --> 01:54:52,914
- any man influenced by such a woman -

1650
01:54:54,004 --> 01:54:55,662
- must succeed!

1651
01:54:59,871 --> 01:55:03,182
It is to her that I owe whatever
small accomplishments I've made.

1652
01:55:05,523 --> 01:55:06,164
There, Veronica.

1653
01:55:06,364 --> 01:55:07,549
You've heard your father's speech.

1654
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:08,782
Now you must go to bed.

1655
01:55:09,050 --> 01:55:09,564
Come along!

1656
01:55:28,631 --> 01:55:29,280
How was the party?

1657
01:55:29,718 --> 01:55:31,265
Beautiful, weren't you listening?

1658
01:55:32,048 --> 01:55:32,499
Yes.

1659
01:55:33,579 --> 01:55:34,768
All those things you said about me -

1660
01:55:35,421 --> 01:55:36,468
- made me blush!

1661
01:55:36,768 --> 01:55:37,392
But they were true!

1662
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:38,255
But you were generous.

1663
01:55:38,798 --> 01:55:39,735
Far too generous.

1664
01:55:41,828 --> 01:55:42,426
William.

1665
01:55:43,342 --> 01:55:44,426
There's something I want to talk to you about.

1666
01:55:46,458 --> 01:55:48,007
Let's sell out here and go home!

1667
01:55:48,487 --> 01:55:49,486
To our real home, St Pierre!

1668
01:55:50,789 --> 01:55:51,601
Back to St Pierre?

1669
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:52,519
Why?

1670
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:55,752
Because of... of Marguerite.

1671
01:56:00,770 --> 01:56:01,363
Marguerite?

1672
01:56:01,971 --> 01:56:05,128
But, she's going to become a nun!

1673
01:56:05,947 --> 01:56:06,981
But she's still a novice.

1674
01:56:07,857 --> 01:56:09,431
And we can see her before
she takes her final vows.

1675
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:15,974
But why?

1676
01:56:16,694 --> 01:56:17,569
Here we have everything!

1677
01:56:18,162 --> 01:56:19,443
The finest house in Dunedin.

1678
01:56:21,216 --> 01:56:21,792
But William!

1679
01:56:22,370 --> 01:56:23,557
This isn't really our home!

1680
01:56:24,362 --> 01:56:27,204
There's that beautiful house in
St Pierre, empty, waiting for us.

1681
01:56:27,683 --> 01:56:29,675
Then there's the family business
that you can now run most efficiently.

1682
01:56:30,932 --> 01:56:31,748
But I can't go back.

1683
01:56:32,722 --> 01:56:35,794
There's the little matter of
desertion from Her Majesty's Navy.

1684
01:56:37,123 --> 01:56:38,184
Come here.

1685
01:56:41,178 --> 01:56:41,779
There.

1686
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,703
It's taken me more than a year to arrange that.

1687
01:56:49,751 --> 01:56:51,172
"With due consideration it has been decided -

1688
01:56:51,907 --> 01:56:55,430
- that William Ozanne is to be allowed
to resign honourably from the Royal Navy. 

1689
01:56:55,877 --> 01:57:01,063
And in regard to the charges of desertion
it has instead been officially pronounced
involuntary absence from duty"

1690
01:57:08,024 --> 01:57:10,131
Think what home would mean to Veronica!

1691
01:57:10,332 --> 01:57:11,689
The opportunities she can have.

1692
01:57:12,254 --> 01:57:14,087
But mostly William, it's Marguerite.

1693
01:57:14,474 --> 01:57:15,143
My own sister.

1694
01:57:16,276 --> 01:57:18,457
You never knew what it
cost me to leave my home.

1695
01:57:19,129 --> 01:57:20,777
To come out to this new country to marry you.

1696
01:57:22,539 --> 01:57:23,540
I want to go home, William!

1697
01:57:24,977 --> 01:57:26,777
I do so want to go home!

1698
01:57:35,704 --> 01:57:36,591
May I look now?

1699
01:57:36,921 --> 01:57:37,517
No, not yet!

1700
01:57:37,894 --> 01:57:38,370
Now?

1701
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:39,232
No, no, no!

1702
01:57:39,785 --> 01:57:40,494
Now!

1703
01:57:40,495 --> 01:57:41,527
That's where mama was born.

1704
01:57:50,122 --> 01:57:52,925
But how will Father Christmas
know we moved from New Zealand?

1705
01:57:53,584 --> 01:57:55,001
Oh, he has ways of finding out!

1706
01:57:59,608 --> 01:58:00,555
Miss Marianne!

1707
01:58:01,499 --> 01:58:02,719
For the love of God!

1708
01:58:04,562 --> 01:58:06,468
No, no, Miss Metivier, no!

1709
01:58:26,925 --> 01:58:29,568
Do you think you could find a dolly at Grandpa's office?

1710
01:58:29,934 --> 01:58:31,278
I wouldn't be at all surprised!

1711
01:58:32,755 --> 01:58:33,351
Goodbye sweetheart!

1712
01:58:33,707 --> 01:58:34,317
Goodbye.

1713
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:40,381
Four sheets -

1714
01:58:41,212 --> 01:58:41,849
- twelve pillow slips, embroidered.

1715
01:58:43,317 --> 01:58:44,883
Here Veronica!

1716
01:58:45,630 --> 01:58:46,124
See you may help mama. 

1717
01:58:47,446 --> 01:58:48,414
Take this into your bedroom -

1718
01:58:50,670 --> 01:58:51,590
- and put it on the bed, dear.

1719
01:58:52,559 --> 01:58:53,398
Four linen sheets.

1720
01:58:54,419 --> 01:58:55,342
Oh, there's a tear in this one.

1721
01:58:56,418 --> 01:58:57,324
Very well, put it aside.

1722
01:58:58,977 --> 01:58:59,757
What about my letter?

1723
01:59:01,135 --> 01:59:01,791
The tide was out -

1724
01:59:02,312 --> 01:59:04,169
- and the young man is already back.

1725
01:59:04,727 --> 01:59:06,509
The young man delievered your letter to the Mother Superior.

1726
01:59:06,846 --> 01:59:08,886
And it will reach Miss Marguerite at once.

1727
01:59:10,696 --> 01:59:11,549
What is it, dear?

1728
01:59:16,325 --> 01:59:17,025
Look mama!

1729
01:59:18,134 --> 01:59:18,995
Well, where did you find it?

1730
01:59:19,594 --> 01:59:20,441
In this box.

1731
01:59:29,421 --> 01:59:30,325
"Dear Marguerite.

1732
01:59:31,050 --> 01:59:33,014
This necklace will say I have always loved you.

1733
01:59:33,676 --> 01:59:34,312
Wait for me.

1734
01:59:34,982 --> 01:59:37,577
When I come home I will ask your father for your hand in marriage.

1735
01:59:38,109 --> 01:59:38,848
William."

1736
01:59:40,281 --> 01:59:41,160
May I wear it?

1737
01:59:41,407 --> 01:59:41,922
May I?

1738
01:59:45,101 --> 01:59:45,937
Yes dear.

1739
01:59:55,016 --> 01:59:58,023
Look, Mrs Ozanne, I found these
two embroidered pillow cases.

1740
01:59:58,985 --> 02:00:01,309
I suppose you used these
when you were children.

1741
02:00:01,984 --> 02:00:03,314
This one will come in very well for Veronica.

1742
02:00:04,358 --> 02:00:06,040
After all her name is Marguerite.

1743
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:01,308
Good evening, Mrs Metivier!

1744
02:01:03,905 --> 02:01:04,659
Where is Mrs Ozanne?

1745
02:01:05,146 --> 02:01:05,749
In her room.

1746
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:07,499
She is not feeling well, Sir.

1747
02:01:08,017 --> 02:01:10,148
Too much unpacking in
my way of thinking, Sir.

1748
02:01:14,047 --> 02:01:14,758
Hello, my dear!

1749
02:01:15,205 --> 02:01:16,032
Tired yourself out, did you?

1750
02:01:17,112 --> 02:01:17,863
I'm tired too.

1751
02:01:18,485 --> 02:01:20,572
Father's business is quite
a terrifying institution.

1752
02:01:27,972 --> 02:01:28,801
What's the matter, Marianne?

1753
02:01:32,386 --> 02:01:33,708
Is it... is it Marguerite?

1754
02:01:34,925 --> 02:01:35,879
Have you heard from her?

1755
02:01:37,116 --> 02:01:38,239
Yes, I've heard from Marguerite.

1756
02:01:39,273 --> 02:01:40,475
Tomorrow she is to become a nun.

1757
02:01:41,988 --> 02:01:43,605
It would seem we arrived just in time.

1758
02:01:44,729 --> 02:01:46,065
I found this today.

1759
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:14,330
This was written a long time ago, Marianne.

1760
02:02:15,425 --> 02:02:17,083
But you loved Marguerite!

1761
02:02:17,423 --> 02:02:18,109
You loved her!

1762
02:02:18,393 --> 02:02:19,332
But that's all passed now.

1763
02:02:19,566 --> 02:02:20,800
But when you wrote my father you lied.

1764
02:02:21,382 --> 02:02:22,048
You asked for my hand in marriage.

1765
02:02:25,673 --> 02:02:26,301
I didn't lie.

1766
02:02:27,457 --> 02:02:28,800
Listen to me, Marianne, I love you.

1767
02:02:29,113 --> 02:02:29,783
Listen to more lies?

1768
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:31,133
You never loved me.

1769
02:02:31,972 --> 02:02:32,801
You loved her!

1770
02:02:33,533 --> 02:02:35,052
But you sent for me, why?

1771
02:02:35,446 --> 02:02:36,222
It wasn't a lie.

1772
02:02:36,542 --> 02:02:37,582
Why did you send for me?

1773
02:02:44,338 --> 02:02:46,519
I'll tell you, Marianne.

1774
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:46,521

1775
02:02:47,714 --> 02:02:48,696
Now I must tell you.

1776
02:02:49,866 --> 02:02:52,193
I never wanted you to know, never though you'd find out.

1777
02:02:53,639 --> 02:02:54,223
But now.

1778
02:02:54,553 --> 02:02:56,078
What did you never want me to find out?

1779
02:02:58,544 --> 02:03:02,806
That I accidentally wrote your name instead
of Marguerite's in the letter to your father.

1780
02:03:06,453 --> 02:03:08,482
You accidentally wrote my name?

1781
02:03:11,669 --> 02:03:13,431
Now our whole marriage has just been -

1782
02:03:15,297 --> 02:03:16,526
- a slip of the pen?

1783
02:03:16,966 --> 02:03:17,497
Marianne.

1784
02:03:28,090 --> 02:03:29,453
Does Marguerite know of -

1785
02:03:30,578 --> 02:03:31,891
- of your slip of the pen?

1786
02:03:32,391 --> 02:03:33,480
No, absolutely not!

1787
02:03:34,534 --> 02:03:35,535
I never even as much as hinted anything.

1788
02:03:36,422 --> 02:03:37,827
Please believe me, Marianne.

1789
02:03:38,204 --> 02:03:39,548
I never told a living soul.

1790
02:03:42,007 --> 02:03:43,957
Oh, that's not quite true.

1791
02:03:44,577 --> 02:03:46,874
I told Tai Haruru, I had to tell him.

1792
02:03:49,236 --> 02:03:50,256
Tai Haruru knew?

1793
02:03:53,704 --> 02:03:54,925
He knew that you hated me?

1794
02:03:57,789 --> 02:04:00,353
I thought I had reached the lowest depths of degradation.

1795
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:03,191
But I didn't expect this!

1796
02:04:07,846 --> 02:04:09,081
So Tai knew?

1797
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,426
Of course he knew.

1798
02:04:15,022 --> 02:04:16,396
And now I understand everything.

1799
02:04:18,961 --> 02:04:22,012
Why, you would never have married me
if he hadn't forced you into it.

1800
02:04:22,351 --> 02:04:23,386
Would you've, William?

1801
02:04:26,511 --> 02:04:27,210
Oh William.

1802
02:04:29,036 --> 02:04:30,631
William, don't ever ever -

1803
02:04:30,898 --> 02:04:32,161
-speak to me again!

1804
02:05:11,738 --> 02:05:12,660
Good morning, Mrs Metivier.

1805
02:05:13,676 --> 02:05:15,130
Has Mrs Ozanne come downstairs yet?

1806
02:05:16,027 --> 02:05:16,990
She left the house an hour ago, Sir.

1807
02:05:18,177 --> 02:05:20,356
Miss Marguerite takes her vows
to the church today.

1808
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:22,396
Have you forgotten, Sir?

1809
02:05:29,011 --> 02:05:29,742
Thank you.

1810
02:05:40,807 --> 02:05:42,163
- Oh, Marianne!
- Marguerite!

1811
02:05:56,958 --> 02:05:59,575
My dear, even when you were on
the other side of the world -

1812
02:05:59,971 --> 02:06:01,282
- I always felt you near to me!

1813
02:06:14,126 --> 02:06:14,834
Marguerite?

1814
02:06:16,459 --> 02:06:18,659
Yesterday I found a letter
William sent you with a necklace.

1815
02:06:21,847 --> 02:06:23,720
He intended to ask you
to come to New Zealand.

1816
02:06:24,910 --> 02:06:27,348
But when he wrote father he put in my name by mistake.

1817
02:06:28,929 --> 02:06:30,222
Then when I came instead of you -

1818
02:06:30,910 --> 02:06:31,584
- he married me.

1819
02:06:32,122 --> 02:06:32,713
Out of pity.

1820
02:06:35,682 --> 02:06:38,506
Oh, Marguerite, don't you hear me?
Don't you realise what I'm saying?

1821
02:06:39,663 --> 02:06:41,098
I knew you were in love with him.

1822
02:06:41,539 --> 02:06:43,092
I knew he had an affection for you.

1823
02:06:44,414 --> 02:06:47,240
I made myself believe it was only a childish infatuation.

1824
02:06:48,835 --> 02:06:50,387
So I fought you for him.

1825
02:06:50,961 --> 02:06:53,101
And I always thought I had won him fairly.

1826
02:06:54,601 --> 02:06:56,151
But he's never loved anyone but you.

1827
02:07:00,574 --> 02:07:02,377
Was it just an accident that you found the letter?

1828
02:07:04,311 --> 02:07:05,603
Just chance, do you think?

1829
02:07:07,229 --> 02:07:09,603
Perhaps there is less chance in life than we realise.

1830
02:07:13,203 --> 02:07:15,858
Perhaps it was intended to bring out the truth at last.

1831
02:07:16,682 --> 02:07:18,653
But when I think of what your life has been.

1832
02:07:19,263 --> 02:07:21,982
- Heartbreak.
- Do I look like a heartbroken woman?

1833
02:07:23,196 --> 02:07:25,171
But you're becoming a nun because William married me!

1834
02:07:27,981 --> 02:07:29,967
At first when you went away to marry him -

1835
02:07:31,191 --> 02:07:32,578
- and when your child was born -

1836
02:07:33,971 --> 02:07:36,420
- there was nothing left for me but chaos and hopelessness.

1837
02:07:41,792 --> 02:07:42,605
Oh, Marguerite!

1838
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:45,450
Marguerite, can you ever forgive me?

1839
02:07:47,902 --> 02:07:49,297
There is no question of forgiveness.

1840
02:07:51,283 --> 02:07:52,106
Marianne?

1841
02:07:56,702 --> 02:07:58,783
Your husband is here in my room

1842
02:07:59,658 --> 02:08:01,043
He wants to talk to you.

1843
02:08:07,594 --> 02:08:08,717
He loves you.

1844
02:08:09,859 --> 02:08:11,138
I'll send him to you.

1845
02:08:12,108 --> 02:08:13,082
No!

1846
02:08:13,629 --> 02:08:14,873
I ask you to do this for me.

1847
02:08:22,077 --> 02:08:25,952
Tell William that I have outgrown the young selfish love of a girl in her teens.

1848
02:08:27,263 --> 02:08:29,587
That I found here what I've been searching for all my life.

1849
02:08:31,806 --> 02:08:34,305
Tell him this is the way everything was meant to be.

1850
02:08:35,305 --> 02:08:37,295
You were destined to accomplish his salvation.

1851
02:08:38,432 --> 02:08:39,980
I was destined for this.

1852
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:44,698
I was swept up to thee by thy beauty.

1853
02:08:47,515 --> 02:08:49,373
And if I was once unhappy -

1854
02:08:50,547 --> 02:08:52,295
- today I am supremely happy!

1855
02:08:53,743 --> 02:08:55,339
Not because I have given up something.

1856
02:08:56,368 --> 02:08:58,183
But because I have been given everything.

1857
02:09:00,449 --> 02:09:01,713
Tell him this.

1858
02:09:05,297 --> 02:09:07,935
And then when you hear the chapel bells ringing -

1859
02:09:08,458 --> 02:09:10,154
- then bring him to see me.

1860
02:09:27,569 --> 02:09:29,656
Marianne, so there is to be no doubt in your mind.

1861
02:09:30,032 --> 02:09:31,482
I've come here to see Marguerite.

1862
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:34,252
To tell her that as much as I loved her once -

1863
02:09:34,583 --> 02:09:36,177
- my love is now only for my wife.

1864
02:09:38,546 --> 02:09:39,847
What kind of love can that be?

1865
02:09:40,815 --> 02:09:42,649
Something manufactured out of your sense of duty?

1866
02:09:43,567 --> 02:09:44,781
It would be an unhappy world -

1867
02:09:45,111 --> 02:09:47,004
- if the only kind of love was the love of you.

1868
02:09:48,628 --> 02:09:50,598
Suppose I didn't love you when I married you?

1869
02:09:51,317 --> 02:09:52,785
You weren't a very lovable person then!

1870
02:09:54,284 --> 02:09:56,130
I didn't want to love you, I didn't try to.

1871
02:09:56,972 --> 02:09:59,631
But something great and wonderful was born out of our relationship.

1872
02:10:00,473 --> 02:10:02,552
By accomodating ourselves to each other's feelings -

1873
02:10:03,286 --> 02:10:04,995
- and learning to know each other's virtues.

1874
02:10:06,247 --> 02:10:09,498
This is far more worth having than any other love I can think of.

1875
02:10:14,977 --> 02:10:16,132
Marianne, don't you see -

1876
02:10:17,121 --> 02:10:19,131
- it was no slip of the pen that brought you to me?

1877
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:21,864
It was something far greater than us!

1878
02:10:22,575 --> 02:10:23,793
Something beyond my control.

1879
02:10:25,925 --> 02:10:28,584
Why, I do love you, Marianne.

1880
02:10:30,153 --> 02:10:31,879
Now that I know how much -

1881
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:34,104
- a whole new life is ahead of us!

1882
02:10:35,350 --> 02:10:37,982
Come with me to Marguerite so I can tell the truth.

1883
02:10:38,679 --> 02:10:40,057
So that you know that I -

1884
02:10:40,710 --> 02:10:41,898
- I only want you!

1885
02:10:57,619 --> 02:10:58,608
William!

1886
02:11:00,196 --> 02:11:01,297
This love of yours.

1887
02:11:02,899 --> 02:11:04,946
This love that grew out of our marriage?

1888
02:11:06,799 --> 02:11:08,526
Has it all the warmth and glory?

1889
02:11:10,275 --> 02:11:10,962
The passion?

1890
02:11:11,778 --> 02:11:12,392
And tenderness?

1891
02:11:13,559 --> 02:11:17,044
Everything that you once wanted love to be to you?

1892
02:11:18,214 --> 02:11:19,861
More than I ever dreamed of!

1893
02:11:23,747 --> 02:11:24,323
And now -

1894
02:11:25,062 --> 02:11:26,761
- with absolute truth between us -

1895
02:11:27,702 --> 02:11:31,502
- it will be as perfect love as there can be on this Earth.

1896
02:11:36,876 --> 02:11:37,966
Oh William!

1897
02:11:40,282 --> 02:11:42,407
William, I'm so proud of you.

1898
02:12:40,601 --> 02:12:41,677
Go now, my children.

1899
02:12:42,508 --> 02:12:44,465
And be investeded in happiness -

1900
02:12:44,967 --> 02:12:47,603
- of the congregation of the Sisters of St Peter.

1901
02:13:40,908 --> 02:13:42,824
May the blessing of almighty God -

1902
02:13:43,515 --> 02:13:50,659
- the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost
descend upon you and remain forever.
Amen.

1903
02:14:37,988 --> 02:14:43,132
THE END

1904
