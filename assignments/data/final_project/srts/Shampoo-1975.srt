1
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,820
The headboard. The headboard, honey.

2
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:42,572
You know it makes me nervous.

3
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:50,370
Could you put your hand up there...

4
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:53,378
...and hold it?
That's right, because--

5
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:56,503
That's-- That's--

6
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:00,917
Jesus! Oh!

7
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:02,969
That's right.

8
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,936
Jesus Christ!

9
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:36,578
When did you get back in town?

10
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,544
Where are you staying?

11
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,513
Is she still in the same place?

12
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:58,057
Listen. Why don't you--?
I'll call you tomorrow.

13
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,355
Why don't you come by the shop
and say hi?

14
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:04,906
Okay. Bye.

15
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:12,207
Why do you bother with them?
Tell them you're sleeping and hang up.

16
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,378
This girl has problems.

17
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:17,371
Know what your problem is?

18
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:21,004
- You have too many sick ladies.
- Oh, yeah?

19
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:23,928
Particularly in your business.

20
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:26,888
Don't worry, honey...

21
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:30,553
...because I'm gonna protect you.

22
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,145
Look what I found.

23
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,517
Oh, shit!

24
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,071
Shit.

25
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:54,534
What do you mean?

26
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:05,167
I don't know why you don't
get yourself an answering service.

27
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,351
What are you doing?

28
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:17,477
I'm looking for my keys.

29
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,228
Keys?

30
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:26,694
- You said you weren't going anywhere.
- I just gotta see this friend.

31
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,357
What are you talking about?

32
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:33,782
You're going to see
one of those girls.

33
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,495
She's not a girl. Just a friend.

34
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:38,121
Wait.

35
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:41,663
Wait until I'm dressed
because I'm going too.

36
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,666
Christ, get me a Kleenex.

37
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:48,548
Look, Felicia. I won't be long.

38
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:51,506
- You're great.
- Thanks a lot.

39
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:55,846
- This girl has attacks.
- What attacks?

40
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:57,342
These attacks.

41
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:01,270
It's got something to do
with her pancreas.

42
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,773
She's got a...

43
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:06,904
- Pancreatic ulcer?
- Yeah, I think so.

44
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:08,816
- That's serious.
- I know.

45
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:10,486
- Her doctor?
- Don't know.

46
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:12,570
- Very serious.
- I know.

47
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:15,664
- Ruth had a pancreatic ulcer.
- She did?

48
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:18,786
- It turned out to be a cancer.
- Wow.

49
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,995
What are you going for, George?
You're not a doctor.

50
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:28,376
I gotta give her some pills.
She ran out of Percodan.

51
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:32,969
Felicia, I want your ass
in this bed when I get back.

52
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:34,422
- You do?
- Yes.

53
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:38,177
- You're very weird, George.
- You're great, baby.

54
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:40,312
You are great.

55
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:43,185
Take this off.

56
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,648
Christ! Goddamn it.

57
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,364
Oh, shit!

58
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,416
- Who is it?
- Who do you think?

59
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:46,370
- Honey.
- Yeah?

60
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,707
- Don't yell at me.
- I'm not.

61
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,007
- There were shots.
- What?

62
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:53,669
Gunshots. Some gunshots.

63
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,386
- Where?
- Here.

64
00:05:57,726 --> 00:06:01,011
- In the canyon.
- It's a big canyon, honey.

65
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:05,138
So what? A bullet
can probably go miles.

66
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:14,607
- Why do you leave me alone?
- I was running all over...

67
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,824
- ...preparing for the bank tomorrow.
- Why didn't you call?

68
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,406
I can't make outgoing calls.

69
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,084
Just breathe, honey.

70
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:34,804
Sometimes I get this terrible feeling
that something awful will happen.

71
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:37,050
Like what?

72
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:41,515
I don't know.
Like somebody's going to get me.

73
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:49,647
- I've had these dreams lately.
- What dreams?

74
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:53,105
They're dumb, but...

75
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:58,116
...somebody gets me and they
throw me around the room.

76
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,869
They grab me and tie me down.

77
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,705
- Then what?
- Then I wake up.

78
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:12,917
I figure if somebody's
gonna get you...

79
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,135
...it's probably gonna be me.

80
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:23,597
No.

81
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:30,436
How are you, baby?

82
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:33,060
How are you?

83
00:07:58,264 --> 00:07:59,509
Where were you?

84
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:03,803
I'm great, honey. Fantastic.
I really couldn't be better.

85
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:05,976
I really feel incredible.

86
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,519
No. Where were you?

87
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:11,852
Getting it together.
I'm opening up the shop.

88
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,020
- Really?
- Yeah.

89
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:19,906
- I'm at the epitome of my life.
- What happened tonight?

90
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:23,161
I can't talk about it.
I've been disgusted.

91
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:27,246
- You said you're at the epitome.
- I am. I am.

92
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:31,748
Till I get Norman off my ass,
and people work for me...

93
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:34,799
Women can get to be
an occupational hazard.

94
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:37,128
What do you mean?

95
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:41,924
While I work in that shop,
I'm always doing too many heads.

96
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:46,846
- What about me?
- You're different.

97
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,970
- I am?
- You're great.

98
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:56,148
- Do you really mean that?
- I'm gonna retire with you.

99
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,320
- Honey?
- Yeah?

100
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:09,786
- Why am I great?
- Jesus, I don't know. You're great.

101
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:23,224
- Know what I read in Cosmopolitan?
- What?

102
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:28,474
If you don't have a baby by 30,
you'll have a Mongolian idiot.

103
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,646
- George.
- Bullshit.

104
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:36,604
Maybe you don't even like children.

105
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,105
You've never been around one.

106
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,861
I'm around you
and I like you, don't I?

107
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:46,618
- Yeah.
- Okay.

108
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:49,121
Good night, honey.

109
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:52,585
- George?
- What?

110
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:56,255
Jackie won't bring
children into the world.

111
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:59,960
Says it's overpopulated
and hypocritical.

112
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:04,345
Could we talk about this
in the morning?

113
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:22,274
Jesus, let me show you something.

114
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,865
Six, six and three-quarters.
That's our prime rate.

115
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:34,162
I'll tell you something else.
The big boys are going for it.

116
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:39,588
Do you know where FHA is?

117
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,961
- FHA?
- Just take a guess where they are.

118
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:46,671
Well, seven and a half.

119
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:49,099
- Wow.
- Wow, indeed.

120
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:52,104
We're not going back to the old days.

121
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:55,351
- Guess not.
- Inflation's not the reason.

122
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,983
Rates rise independently
of tight money.

123
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:10,747
What sort of references
do you have, Mr. Roundy?

124
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,120
I do Barbara Rush.

125
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,250
You do what?

126
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,498
Her hair. I do Barbara Rush.

127
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:27,132
I meant credit references and...

128
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:32,216
Jesus. I'm not the cigarette kind.

129
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:36,555
So what? We get a trip out of it.
It's a job.

130
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:39,563
Egypt? Why Egypt?

131
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:43,651
- That's where the pyramids are.
- You seem disappointed.

132
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:45,277
No.

133
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:49,241
Egypt?

134
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:53,743
- Maybe we can change our location.
- No, that's not it.

135
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,954
- Do you have children?
- No.

136
00:11:57,212 --> 00:12:00,082
- Are you married?
- No.

137
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:03,632
- Got something against traveling?
- No.

138
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:07,254
- Something against us?
- No.

139
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:18,225
Jill, you can come out and say it.

140
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:21,313
I'm embarrassed.

141
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,858
We'll let you know tomorrow.

142
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:27,196
Thank you for coming by.

143
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:32,194
Please don't misunderstand.
I would like to go.

144
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:50,093
- Thank you.
- Sure.

145
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:59,349
Jesus, this town.

146
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:02,313
Financial statement?
I got the heads.

147
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:05,356
Customers come to me.
They want me.

148
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:08,146
If I open a shop, they'll come to me.

149
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,158
- I got lots of heads.
- Okay.

150
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,699
- Know what I'm talking about?
- No.

151
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:17,248
How do you expect to lend me money
if you don't know my business?

152
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,584
I don't.

153
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:22,253
Good morning, Mr. Roundy.

154
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:37,892
Excuse me. Aren't I entitled
to make out a financial statement?

155
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:40,806
Yes, of course.

156
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:44,981
Miss Michaels, would you
hand me a few of those forms?

157
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,855
Thanks very much.

158
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:49,356
Just have these notarized...

159
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:52,066
- ...and we'll see how it goes.
- Thanks.

160
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,570
You asshole!

161
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:30,896
Do you know what George did?

162
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:33,827
He wakes me up at 2:00 am
to do my hair.

163
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:35,702
Why?

164
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,449
I don't know.

165
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:40,660
He woke me up and said
"I'm gonna make you...

166
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:43,450
...the grooviest chick in this town."

167
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:47,413
- What did you do?
- I looked at him and said, "George...

168
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:51,340
...if you love me,
I am the grooviest chick."

169
00:14:51,595 --> 00:14:55,889
- Did he cut your hair?
- We didn't get around to that.

170
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,303
Jackie, when you and George
were together, did he do that stuff?

171
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,806
I can't remember.
It was so long ago.

172
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:09,026
Yeah, stupid question.

173
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:12,906
I'm pleased that you're
happy with Lester.

174
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,370
It's great to wake up
in the morning with your rent paid.

175
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:21,824
George was just too much of
a gypsy for me.

176
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:25,500
- He went to the bank today.
- Oh, he did?

177
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:29,331
I just couldn't wait that long.
But George is great.

178
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:34,425
Yeah, George is great.
He's great.

179
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:53,654
Hello, George!

180
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:59,036
- Hey, baby. What's happening?
- Nothing. I reconciled with Ron.

181
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:04,074
- Ron?
- The guy I divorced last summer.

182
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:05,961
Great.

183
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:08,668
- I hope you make it.
- Call me.

184
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:12,090
I don't have your number.
Stop by the shop.

185
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:17,847
Am I dry?

186
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:20,555
Think it has enough height?

187
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:23,888
You think it has the height?

188
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:25,765
Would someone feel me?

189
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,102
Am I dry?

190
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,863
- Is this a nice height?
- It looks great.

191
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:39,244
- You're late.
- Let me--

192
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:40,776
- Wait.
- I don't care.

193
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:44,075
- The girl--
- I don't care if she's dead.

194
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:47,542
- Norman says to charge for coffee.
- You know what you can tell Norman.

195
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:51,627
- Sorry.
- Don't waste my time. Understand?

196
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:55,548
It's important to me.
Let's stick to hair if you want.

197
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:58,721
- Stop. Have Mary do it.
- Have her do what?

198
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,844
- You have no respect for me!
- I don't?

199
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:06,099
You can't distinguish me
from your Hollywood numbers!

200
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:07,850
- My what?
- Numbers!

201
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:11,648
- That's Tickle Pink. What?
- Numbers.

202
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:16,031
I don't need to be put
in this kind of position.

203
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:18,317
- Why are you here?
- Wash and set.

204
00:17:18,534 --> 00:17:19,910
You need a cut.

205
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,365
- Norman said--
- George says you need a cut.

206
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:29,665
- I shouldn't be put in this position.
- I'm not trying to do that.

207
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:33,337
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary?

208
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:35,504
- Wash her.
- With?

209
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:40,215
A Brillo pad. I'm not trying to
put you in a position.

210
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:43,174
Shit. I'll be right back.

211
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,938
- I'm taking a lot of shit lately.
- It's Norman.

212
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,777
Ain't no Norman.

213
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:04,533
You're like my Otis.
He can't keep off the ladies.

214
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:08,577
- How's he doing?
- Got a letter from him.

215
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:13,289
- He just made corporal squad leader.
- That's great.

216
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,338
Rocko, I don't believe
what you're saying to me.

217
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,511
That is the purest
comment I've ever made.

218
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:24,215
- If you can't do my hair--
- Stop. I'm going crazy.

219
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:27,263
- Why?
- I've been cutting too much hair.

220
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,846
I'm losing all my concepts.

221
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:33,056
Baby, you're great.

222
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:39,529
- Hey, baby. What's happening?
- They want me to go to Egypt.

223
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:41,941
Great. Jill, meet Felicia.

224
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:43,613
- Hello.
- Hello.

225
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,156
- How did it go at the bank?
- Great.

226
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:50,330
- Could I speak to you?
- Well, I'm--

227
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:53,420
- Go ahead, George.
- Could I?

228
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,884
- I said I wasn't sure I could go.
- Where?

229
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:01,543
- Egypt.
- Great. I gotta get back.

230
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:05,713
- How did it go at the bank?
- Great. Can we talk later?

231
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,725
- Why the bank?
- Trying to get my own shop.

232
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:17,275
- Really?
- George.

233
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,403
- Yeah?
- You're late.

234
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,981
You're supposed to go to Buffums.

235
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:24,282
- Buffums?
- Yes, Buffums.

236
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:27,329
- I'm busy.
- You promised to do the show.

237
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,615
- Fuck, Norman!
- George.

238
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:39,752
- Gloria needs a cut?
- Her ends are split.

239
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,509
Well, don't you contradict me
in public again!

240
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:47,049
What is this shit about
not charging for coffee?

241
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:52,730
I'm charging $25 a head already.
I'm not gonna hit them for coffee.

242
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:58,067
I want you to learn to collect.
Will you learn to nickel-and-dime?

243
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:01,279
You're gonna end up
without a pot to pee in.

244
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:06,863
- Looking great.
- What are you doing later?

245
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,038
- Whatever you say.
- We have this political thing tonight.

246
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,868
Can you comb me for it?

247
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,750
You went to the bank?

248
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:15,165
For a loan?

249
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,455
You really want your own shop?

250
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:19,131
Go see Lester.

251
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:20,841
- Your husband?
- Yes.

252
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:23,714
- About?
- The shop's a good investment.

253
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:26,930
- I'll tell him.
- Hey, I'm a star.

254
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:30,183
- George.
- Hey, baby. Say hello to Felicia.

255
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:31,639
I already did.

256
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:34,768
- When can we talk?
- I'm working now.

257
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:39,145
- I have an important decision to make.
- About what?

258
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:42,066
- Whether or not to go.
- Go where?

259
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:45,323
- Egypt!
- Did they offer you a job yet?

260
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:48,660
No! But I think they might.

261
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:50,288
I'll be right back.

262
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:54,415
- Is she the one with the ulcer?
- I don't know.

263
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:59,164
- They didn't offer you the job?
- I still want your opinion.

264
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:03,249
- Can we talk after work?
- I never know when that is.

265
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:04,714
Neither do I, baby.

266
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,885
Know what Lillian Bercovici did
after I sprayed her?

267
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:13,049
She touched and played with it!
I don't know what it is!

268
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:16,930
- She's heavy. You gotta take it.
- I can't stand her.

269
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:18,436
Jill?

270
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:21,691
- Shit.
- She all right?

271
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:26,235
- She's fine.
- You would be a good investment.

272
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:29,618
- Great.
- Otherwise, I wouldn't tell Lester.

273
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,113
- You really mean it?
- Yes.

274
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:36,081
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.

275
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:40,873
Dennis, doesn't Felicia looks great?

276
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,379
- Great.
- Great.

277
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:44,874
Yeah?

278
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:12,366
I don't care whether the fish
lay eggs in the Baltic.

279
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,158
I want beluga caviar!
Call Chasen's. Call Jurgenson's.

280
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,874
I don't care how much it costs--

281
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:21,957
How much?

282
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:26,753
Well, then spend it.
Be sure it's there tonight.

283
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,460
You gotta do everything yourself!

284
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,316
Felicia says you're
a good hairdresser.

285
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,184
Well, yeah.

286
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,984
- She says you're fabulous.
- Thank you.

287
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,696
I didn't say it. She did.

288
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:55,118
How did you get into that...

289
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:57,201
...line of work?

290
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,749
I went to beauty school.

291
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,248
You go to beauty school
and get your operator's license.

292
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:09,631
You graduate and you're a hairdresser.

293
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,757
It's an unusual trade.

294
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:19,092
The important thing is
you're successful at it.

295
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,686
- In a way, but I--
- What's this?

296
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:26,892
- The chairs from Mr. Russell.
- He calls that wholesale?

297
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,112
We've had it with him.

298
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:34,108
- I'm better than my boss.
- That's very good, George.

299
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,206
Wonderful that you want
to do something.

300
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,197
Thank you.

301
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:46,665
I usually don't get into personal
services. Too hard to monitor.

302
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,216
If you don't watch your operators
they'll steal.

303
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,877
- Am I right or not?
- You're right.

304
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:55,179
Who needs that aggravation?

305
00:23:55,683 --> 00:24:01,022
- When I come home from work--
- Sorry, but I have to have that key.

306
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,895
- What key?
- I've been ringing.

307
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:08,520
The door's locked.
The man from Sloan's is coming--

308
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,902
How did you lose it?
George, this is Jackie.

309
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:16,451
Hi. I mean, hello.
We've met.

310
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:21,032
- Is that right?
- George is a terrific hairdresser.

311
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,167
That's what I hear.

312
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,341
- How's Norman?
- Great.

313
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:32,292
- Who's doing your hair?
- Oh, nobody much.

314
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,427
George wants to open a shop.

315
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,262
No kidding. Your own shop?

316
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,646
George, will you excuse us
a moment, please?

317
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,071
- Out, please.
- Yeah.

318
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,951
I called to tell you I was sending
it over, but the line was busy.

319
00:24:58,204 --> 00:25:00,695
You're always on the phone.

320
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,919
My secretary saw you
talking to that boy.

321
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:11,342
- Steve?
- Whatever his name is. That actor.

322
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:15,884
Steve Slutes couldn't
get arrested as an actor.

323
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,881
He couldn't get arrested as a boy.

324
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,926
Then you were talking to him?

325
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:26,981
I ran into him at the 76 station.
Should I have hidden?

326
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:31,527
I was talking to him.
You never let me see anybody.

327
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,356
I can't even bring
my girlfriends to the house.

328
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,695
You're even jealous of the dogs.

329
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,747
I have to talk to somebody, don't I?

330
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,911
I'm not jealous of the dogs.

331
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,996
I'm not jealous of anybody.

332
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,163
I can't afford to get caught off base.

333
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:57,586
I can't talk to some broken actor.
Think I'll tell him I'm screwing you?

334
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,473
Of course not.

335
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,851
- That's not very logical.
- It is logical.

336
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,559
It's the most logical thing.

337
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:11,768
You'd feel better if we go out
with people and have conversations.

338
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,528
Yes? How about starting
with tonight?

339
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,076
Look, sweetheart.
I know it's tough.

340
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:24,074
But my business involves
handling money for touchy people.

341
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,783
Politics and so forth.

342
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:32,206
Felicia's in a very difficult
period in her life.

343
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:37,000
Any divorce and settlement
and so forth and...

344
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,008
...my finances would
have to be looked into.

345
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:46,807
- Your touchy investors.
- You do well for people, you don't stop.

346
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,235
Nobody wants you to stop
making money. Not even Uncle Sam.

347
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,521
They all want their share.

348
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,946
You're lying about one thing.

349
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,950
- What's that?
- You're still jealous.

350
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,957
God, you're a doll.

351
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,052
I'll work something out
about tonight. I promise.

352
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,968
I promise.

353
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,853
Give me the key to Beaumont.

354
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,815
Come on. I'll walk you down.

355
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,747
Felicia's very interested
in your shop.

356
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,379
You may not think $15,000
means much to me, but...

357
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,308
...but I invest for others as well.

358
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,927
- We'll need to talk more.
- When?

359
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,021
When?

360
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,891
- Well, how about tonight?
- Tonight?

361
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:20,447
Contributors are coming over
to the bistro to watch the returns.

362
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:23,777
It's a pain in the ass,
but I have to do it.

363
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:27,328
- We'll have time to talk there.
- Great.

364
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,826
That's great.

365
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:34,623
Maybe on your way over
you could pick up Jackie here.

366
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,473
It's good you want to do something.

367
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:51,096
I wish my son knew what he wanted.
Anything, something.

368
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,440
Maybe beauty school.

369
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,983
Anyway, see you tonight, doll.

370
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,071
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

371
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:10,074
Your car down here?

372
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,789
I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo.

373
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:18,000
- She can come with us.
- I don't want her to.

374
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,717
All right.

375
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:28,013
- You serious about the shop?
- Are you with Lester?

376
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,054
- I asked you first.
- I'm never serious.

377
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,397
- How long you had this?
- About six weeks.

378
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,853
- I won't go tonight.
- Honey, please--

379
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,278
- Does he know we went together?
- Never came up.

380
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:45,236
Tell him. Then I'll take you.

381
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,818
You'd do this for any other girl.

382
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:53,079
- I'm not gonna be a beard for you.
- Why? It's against your principles?

383
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,742
I wonder what you do for his wife.

384
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,749
I don't fuck for money.
I do it for fun.

385
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,685
I'll do whatever you want.
You know that.

386
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:23,487
- Sometimes, George...
- Want me to do your hair?

387
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,365
Oh, no.

388
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:29,946
- I don't know. What do you think?
- Oh, boy.

389
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,078
George, you can't leave me...

390
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,203
Stop by the shop.
I'll see what I can do.

391
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:49,462
<i>Gold closed $43 an ounce.</i>

392
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:54,600
<i>At the bell, the Dow Jones Industrial
closed at 946.23, off 218...</i>

393
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:59,812
<i>...volume 16 million shares. One
of the most active stocks, Texaco...</i>

394
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:05,442
<i>...853/4, down 1/2, Sears 681/4,
up 1/4, Polaroid 1091/4.</i>

395
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:08,368
<i>Atlantic Richfield,
tipped 1/4 to 1021/2.</i>

396
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,027
No, I tried that stuff.

397
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:14,202
You know I always burn.

398
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:18,870
The dermatologist gave me
that stuff and it gave me a rash.

399
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,038
Well, that's fine for you.

400
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,210
No, you have different skin
than me.

401
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,423
All right, I'll try it.

402
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,014
- Do you think George is a fairy?
- Who?

403
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,473
That kid. The hairdresser.

404
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:45,853
Well, I don't know for sure.
He is a hairdresser.

405
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,656
Thank you, Mona.

406
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,782
Maybe he's just kooky
and likes kooky things.

407
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,534
Maybe. Why do you ask?

408
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:58,326
I'm thinking of investing.
But he worries me.

409
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,824
Why?

410
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,841
Maybe he's flighty and irresponsible.
That's why I asked if he was a fairy.

411
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,042
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.

412
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:12,264
You suggested it.
Think it's a good idea?

413
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,885
- Yes, but I thought, you know...
- What?

414
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:19,602
I thought you were indulging me.
You indulge me.

415
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,976
No, doll. I listen to you.

416
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,694
If the deal doesn't make any money,
that's not too bad. If handled right.

417
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:33,946
He's a nice boy.
I invited him tonight.

418
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,956
Just sorry he's a fairy.

419
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,176
What do you think?

420
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:55,932
Doctor Feldman says it's normal.

421
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:57,851
What's that?

422
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,303
Postnatal frigidity.

423
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,936
But with me it's really...

424
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:07,690
This guy expected me
to jump into bed.

425
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:11,238
I've got to feel something
tender or whatever.

426
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,735
- I must know somebody.
- George, line two.

427
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:17,491
<i>Line two, George.</i>

428
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:21,953
Hi. I'd like to, Jackie, but
I told you to stop by the shop.

429
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,877
Chicken salad.

430
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:29,008
Okay, but I got to be
in Bel Air by 4.

431
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:33,050
Ask Ricci if he'd wind up
Anjanette for me.

432
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,845
There's still too much red.

433
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:43,814
No, it's great.
Sorry, I got to split.

434
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,645
I can't do anyone else.

435
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,769
I have an appointment.

436
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,063
Ricci, it's not a dye job.

437
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,737
- Why can't you finish?
- What's wrong?

438
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,489
- George can't finish her.
- I don't care.

439
00:33:56,954 --> 00:34:01,366
You don't comb Mrs. Karpf till 4.
Why can't you finish it?

440
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,457
- I'm busy till 4.
- Doing what?

441
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:07,287
- Whatever I feel like.
- And whenever you feel like it.

442
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:03,970
It's all right. Shut up.

443
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,776
Hi. Come on in.

444
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:20,028
- You like a drink or something?
- No, thanks.

445
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:22,370
Well, I would.

446
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:24,124
Nice place.

447
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:32,337
Where do you want to do this?

448
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:36,091
- You got a bathroom?
- Can't we do it in here?

449
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,510
- What will you do?
- I'd cut it.

450
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:41,467
- Cut it?
- Yes, I think so.

451
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:44,389
- You don't seem too sure.
- I'm sure.

452
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:48,601
- You don't like it?
- It makes you look like a hooker.

453
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,518
What a terrible thing to say.

454
00:35:51,736 --> 00:35:55,484
What do you want me to do?
Lie to you? I'd cut it.

455
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:10,954
I have to look great tonight.
I have to look absolutely great.

456
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,422
Hello.

457
00:36:19,138 --> 00:36:23,006
Oh, hi. Just a second.

458
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:28,597
How are you?

459
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:31,563
How about what?

460
00:36:31,776 --> 00:36:33,270
I can't.

461
00:36:33,528 --> 00:36:36,979
You can't really come up here, Johnny.

462
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:46,699
Well, it might be difficult,
but it's not impossible.

463
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:55,336
I don't want short hair.
Not too much off, eh?

464
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,507
What's the matter?

465
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,925
- Everything's great.
- Great?

466
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:03,677
- Good.
- Good?

467
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:08,307
- It's not bad.
- Not bad is not great.

468
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:09,802
I lied a little.

469
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:13,107
- It isn't even good.
- I lied a lot.

470
00:37:18,156 --> 00:37:21,192
Oh, stop it, you silly.

471
00:37:24,704 --> 00:37:25,735
It's hot in here.

472
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:31,080
It's the steam room. Lester likes
it on in case he wants to use it.

473
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:54,392
Mona.

474
00:37:56,069 --> 00:38:00,232
Mona, Mona, Mona!
I need you.

475
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:05,109
This earring. Will you try
to find the other one?

476
00:38:05,328 --> 00:38:07,736
When George comes, tell him to wait.

477
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:12,167
I have to pick up a dress,
but be sure to tell him to wait.

478
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,334
I have to go to the market.

479
00:38:14,546 --> 00:38:18,294
Make sure he doesn't leave.
It's important.

480
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:37,600
The guy at the bank thought
I was a hippie.

481
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:39,859
I did it to myself.

482
00:38:40,071 --> 00:38:42,823
He didn't know a good thing
when he saw one.

483
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:45,440
- Jill's gonna be mad.
- She won't.

484
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,986
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.

485
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:51,075
Jill absolutely adores you.

486
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:54,500
Remember Myrna Lynn?

487
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:55,956
She adored me.

488
00:38:56,171 --> 00:39:00,418
Then she called me a hairdresser,
and took off with some agent.

489
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:03,006
Jill is 20 times the girl Myrna is.

490
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,461
- Exactly.
- What does that mean?

491
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,800
I don't know.
You can sense these things.

492
00:39:09,017 --> 00:39:10,345
What?

493
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,854
She needs to be with somebody
who can take care of her.

494
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:24,443
<i>--closed down

499
00:39:55,647 --> 00:39:57,141
What about Felicia?

500
00:39:58,984 --> 00:40:01,392
- What about her?
- Did you?

501
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:04,281
- Did I what?
- Come on.

502
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:10,657
Can't wait to see Lester with me
and that cunt in the same room.

503
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,500
Well, did you or didn't you?

504
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:30,971
Can't stand to miss one of them,
can you?

505
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:34,887
Oh, George.

506
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,890
Shit.

507
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:22,941
Yeah.

508
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:32,365
Oh, you're a genius.
You're a genius.

509
00:41:35,498 --> 00:41:37,490
You're a genius.

510
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:05,978
Oh, no, baby.
No. No, baby, no.

511
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:10,857
- I want to. I want to.
- No, no.

512
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:17,911
Baby, no. No, no, really.

513
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,706
- Sorry.
- Don't ruin it.

514
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:27,340
It's gonna ruin everything.

515
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:00,581
Jesus Christ!

516
00:43:04,003 --> 00:43:06,541
- Honey!
- My God, it's Lester.

517
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:09,673
- Get up. Get up. Get up!
- Hello?

518
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:12,838
- Jackie?
- Oh, God. Do something, please.

519
00:43:13,054 --> 00:43:14,678
Baby, you sleeping?

520
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:20,385
Jackie?

521
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:22,394
Jackie?

522
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,103
Shut the door, honey.

523
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:34,657
- Come on.
- Oh. Sorry.

524
00:43:44,627 --> 00:43:47,118
- Come in or stay out.
- Shut the door.

525
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:48,998
You think this is a picnic?

526
00:43:49,215 --> 00:43:51,587
Just don't let the steam out.

527
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,824
Hey, Jackie? I brought you
a little something, doll!

528
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:32,124
- You look like you had a workout.
- Women can get you very upset.

529
00:44:32,342 --> 00:44:35,592
- I know.
- This doing hair, it's...

530
00:44:37,305 --> 00:44:41,932
I know you're in the middle, but
if you'd bear with me tonight--

531
00:44:42,143 --> 00:44:43,803
Oh, hey...

532
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,769
No, it's a difficult situation.
I appreciate it.

533
00:44:47,982 --> 00:44:52,063
Tonight's going to be very,
very tough on me.

534
00:44:52,278 --> 00:44:56,228
- I don't know...
- But we'll do business, son, I...

535
00:44:57,659 --> 00:44:59,568
I can tell you that.

536
00:45:22,183 --> 00:45:25,184
I'll clean up or the dogs
will get it all over.

537
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:28,147
What have you been doing?

538
00:45:29,024 --> 00:45:33,235
You should get rid of them.
They get hair all over.

539
00:45:33,445 --> 00:45:36,648
They're Yorkies, and they don't shed.

540
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:40,233
- Aren't you having a drink?
- No.

541
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:42,943
- Why not?
- I don't want one.

542
00:45:44,498 --> 00:45:46,823
Have a drink. It's 5:00.

543
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:50,327
I don't want one.

544
00:45:50,545 --> 00:45:54,080
You tell me not to drink,
then to drink. Which is it?

545
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:57,379
I don't want a drink.

546
00:45:57,594 --> 00:46:01,295
I called to tell you I was coming
but the line was busy.

547
00:46:01,723 --> 00:46:04,012
You're always on the phone.

548
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:11,040
- You here to see my mother?
- Yeah, did--

549
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:13,873
She's out. You're supposed to wait.

550
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:19,300
Nobody's home up there. Maybe...

551
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:28,558
Are you hungry?

552
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:30,762
Yeah, a little.

553
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,403
This is the one thing
I like about this house.

554
00:47:42,241 --> 00:47:44,946
- Want some lox?
- No, thanks.

555
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,072
You're my mother's hairdresser.

556
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:52,952
I do hair, yeah.

557
00:47:53,168 --> 00:47:56,122
- Chopped liver?
- No, thanks.

558
00:47:56,338 --> 00:48:00,502
Are you gay? Want a baked apple?
They're cold, but good.

559
00:48:00,718 --> 00:48:02,876
No, thanks.

560
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,054
Did you hear me?

561
00:48:06,265 --> 00:48:07,759
Yeah.

562
00:48:07,975 --> 00:48:11,724
- Well, are you? Are you queer?
- Sure.

563
00:48:11,937 --> 00:48:15,187
- Are you or not?
- This is great.

564
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:17,107
Tell me. Don't be afraid.

565
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,485
- Why do you want to know so bad?
- See if you're making it with my mom.

566
00:48:23,824 --> 00:48:27,027
Why would it have
anything to do with that?

567
00:48:27,244 --> 00:48:28,904
Nothing, I guess.

568
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:33,700
- Have you ever made it with a guy?
- You ever make it with a girl?

569
00:48:36,295 --> 00:48:38,833
- Are you?
- What are you talking about?

570
00:48:39,173 --> 00:48:41,664
Making it with my mother?

571
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,551
I'd love to do your hair sometime.

572
00:48:50,017 --> 00:48:54,726
Do you like older women?
That's sort of faggoty, isn't it?

573
00:48:58,734 --> 00:49:01,060
I never get my hair done.

574
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:07,238
I've never been to a beauty salon
in my whole life.

575
00:49:07,827 --> 00:49:11,409
- You think that's funny, don't you?
- Yeah.

576
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:15,750
Beverly Hills hairdresser.

577
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,249
You might as well be a faggot.

578
00:49:18,462 --> 00:49:20,336
You think that's funny too?

579
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:24,759
- No. No. No.
- Then what do you think?

580
00:49:26,053 --> 00:49:29,968
I think you got exactly
the same eyes as your mother.

581
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:34,311
- Your chin's a bit like hers too.
- No, it isn't. No.

582
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,272
- My eyes aren't like hers either.
- They are.

583
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:39,854
I'm nothing like my mother.

584
00:49:42,653 --> 00:49:45,323
I'm not trying to insult you.

585
00:49:53,456 --> 00:49:56,789
Can't we just be friends?

586
00:49:57,668 --> 00:49:59,460
Okay.

587
00:50:03,508 --> 00:50:05,417
You want to fuck?

588
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:14,474
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

589
00:50:14,686 --> 00:50:18,019
As long as you don't
ask me what sign I am.

590
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:22,391
- Are you married?
- Sometimes.

591
00:50:24,153 --> 00:50:26,858
But not at the moment.

592
00:50:30,076 --> 00:50:32,199
Would you like to go to a party?

593
00:50:55,727 --> 00:50:57,636
George.

594
00:51:07,822 --> 00:51:09,731
George.

595
00:51:17,332 --> 00:51:22,077
Lorna, have you seen George,
by any chance?

596
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:25,462
- My hairdresser.
- He's in the bathroom.

597
00:51:25,673 --> 00:51:27,333
He's in the bathroom.

598
00:51:28,176 --> 00:51:31,212
- He's in your bathroom?
- Yeah.

599
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:55,198
Hello, George.
I should be dry by now.

600
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:20,642
- George, come here.
- What?

601
00:52:20,854 --> 00:52:24,768
- You dry?
- No, don't comb my hair out.

602
00:52:24,983 --> 00:52:29,444
- I'll do it now.
- Do it later, for heaven's sake.

603
00:52:29,654 --> 00:52:34,067
- I'm so glad you'll be there tonight.
- What?

604
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:38,364
I'm so glad you're going
to be there tonight.

605
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,460
- Right here?
- Right here.

606
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:46,788
I don't care. I don't care.

607
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:49,627
- I'd better get--
- I don't want to.

608
00:53:28,297 --> 00:53:31,962
- Where's your car?
- A friend dropped me off.

609
00:53:33,218 --> 00:53:35,175
- Who?
- Never mind.

610
00:53:38,056 --> 00:53:41,010
I'm going tonight. Jackie asked me.

611
00:53:41,226 --> 00:53:45,176
- I need you to fix my hair.
- She'll pick us up pretty soon.

612
00:53:45,397 --> 00:53:48,066
I'm going with somebody else.

613
00:53:48,275 --> 00:53:51,774
By the way, you never said
how it went this morning.

614
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,108
Okay.

615
00:53:55,324 --> 00:53:58,859
- Are they gonna give you the loan?
- Well...

616
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,827
I don't even know why I ask.

617
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,034
The only way you'll get
money out of a bank is to rob one.

618
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:11,665
- What are so mad about?
- Just fix my hair.

619
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:15,002
You go to Jackie's.
What about my hair?

620
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:18,552
- She asked me.
- You do whatever anybody asks?

621
00:54:18,764 --> 00:54:21,469
I'm always at the end of the line.

622
00:54:21,684 --> 00:54:25,302
- I'll do your hair.
- Stop kissing everybody's ass.

623
00:54:25,521 --> 00:54:27,976
That won't put you in business.

624
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:30,977
- I'm trying to get things moving.
- Grow up.

625
00:54:31,193 --> 00:54:34,360
You never stop moving,
you never go anywhere.

626
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,070
Grow up! Grow up!

627
00:54:58,804 --> 00:55:02,469
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- You're right.

628
00:55:04,226 --> 00:55:08,935
I just want us to have a normal
life, like everybody else.

629
00:55:10,483 --> 00:55:13,519
Jesus, I just can't take it anymore.

630
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:18,985
All I want is to get up early,
run my own business...

631
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,284
...take you out to a movie
on the weekend.

632
00:55:28,501 --> 00:55:32,581
I'm trying, honey.
I just can't get out of my own way.

633
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:37,922
I know. I know, honey.
I'm so sorry.

634
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:07,122
Honey, come on,
we don't have much time.

635
00:56:14,213 --> 00:56:15,672
Sure.

636
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:30,557
What do you know about this guy?

637
00:56:30,772 --> 00:56:32,764
He's a director.

638
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:35,183
- You've heard of him?
- Sure.

639
00:56:35,401 --> 00:56:37,608
Movies or television?

640
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,691
Commercials. Make you feel better?

641
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:46,741
- Thought it might.
- Commercials.

642
00:57:09,143 --> 00:57:12,595
- Who is it?
- Oh, it's nobody.

643
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:24,236
- There's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
- George.

644
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:27,286
Looks like someone took a dump in it.

645
00:57:27,495 --> 00:57:31,160
- You've been chipping on me.
- I know. Isn't it awful?

646
00:57:31,332 --> 00:57:34,119
- We're upstairs, come on.
- Excuse me.

647
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:44,922
Don't let me drink too much.

648
00:57:45,138 --> 00:57:47,344
You don't do that anymore, do you?

649
00:57:47,557 --> 00:57:49,217
Good evening.

650
00:57:55,899 --> 00:57:57,357
Check your coat?

651
00:57:59,027 --> 00:58:00,486
Your coat.

652
00:58:03,364 --> 00:58:05,072
Can I take this?

653
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:09,032
Are you okay?

654
00:58:09,245 --> 00:58:11,321
Yeah, I'm fine.

655
00:58:17,462 --> 00:58:19,668
In case she wants it back.

656
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,842
What would you like to drink?

657
00:58:33,061 --> 00:58:36,596
- I'll have a stinger.
- Before dinner?

658
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:39,222
I don't know.
What do you think?

659
00:58:39,442 --> 00:58:41,649
Why don't you try something?

660
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:43,735
Waiter?

661
00:58:43,947 --> 00:58:46,616
- Yes, sir?
- A white dubonnet on the rocks.

662
00:58:46,866 --> 00:58:49,618
- And for you?
- A little white wine.

663
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,827
A little white wine. And...?

664
00:58:53,957 --> 00:58:55,120
I'll have a Coke.

665
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:59,288
- Soda with a twist.
- Yes, sir.

666
00:59:12,017 --> 00:59:14,971
- Glad you could make it.
- Thank you.

667
00:59:15,187 --> 00:59:18,271
- Hi, doll.
- Lester, this is my friend Jill.

668
00:59:18,482 --> 00:59:21,601
- Hello.
- Glad to know you, Jill.

669
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:24,392
- And this is--
- Johnny Pope.

670
00:59:24,613 --> 00:59:26,605
- Mr. Pope.
- Hello.

671
00:59:32,662 --> 00:59:33,943
Who are they?

672
00:59:34,164 --> 00:59:38,992
I've told you about Jill a hundred
times. You never listen.

673
00:59:39,211 --> 00:59:43,671
- Does she know about us?
- Jesus, she's my best friend.

674
00:59:43,882 --> 00:59:48,959
I need to find room for them.
Who's the guy? George's boyfriend?

675
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:53,307
- I don't know. Ask him.
- Jackie, I'm only--

676
00:59:56,311 --> 01:00:00,475
Keep an eye on Jackie.
She's a bit high-strung.

677
01:00:00,691 --> 01:00:03,098
See she doesn't drink too much.

678
01:00:04,861 --> 01:00:06,901
See you later, doll.

679
01:00:25,924 --> 01:00:30,218
- How does she know Lester Karpf?
- I don't know. Why?

680
01:00:30,888 --> 01:00:35,300
Well, I just wouldn't want him
mad at me, that's all.

681
01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:45,854
George.

682
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:56,405
How are you? This is Jackie.
Jackie, say hello to Felicia.

683
01:00:57,998 --> 01:00:59,457
Hello, Felicia.

684
01:01:00,334 --> 01:01:02,825
I'm so glad that you could make it.

685
01:01:03,045 --> 01:01:06,710
I've been looking forward
to seeing you all evening.

686
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:17,973
Ohio is nothing to worry about.

687
01:01:21,564 --> 01:01:23,390
I don't know.

688
01:01:23,607 --> 01:01:27,142
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

689
01:01:27,361 --> 01:01:31,406
- Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.
- Never mind. I'll do it.

690
01:01:31,991 --> 01:01:36,783
Why didn't you come alone?
Did you have to bring her?

691
01:01:36,996 --> 01:01:39,534
She's a friend of Jill's.

692
01:01:41,584 --> 01:01:42,864
Who is Jill?

693
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:47,628
She's a friend of Johnny Pope's,
the director.

694

<i>--14,000 to 672,000.</i>

695

<i>That leaves California, the big one.</i>

696

<i>NBC News now projects Nixon

697
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,572
Jackie. Jackie.

698
01:02:17,536 --> 01:02:21,866
Excuse me, I know you,
but I can't remember where.

699
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:26,127
- Bruce Barton's?
- Excuse me. Come with me.

700
01:02:43,563 --> 01:02:47,311
That other couple we're with.
Do you know them well?

701
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:49,310
Why?

702
01:02:50,278 --> 01:02:51,820
Why?

703
01:02:52,864 --> 01:02:56,612
Maybe you know why George
went into the ladies' room.

704
01:02:56,826 --> 01:02:58,486
George?

705

<i>--in our administration the American

- No, it's boring.

707
01:03:11,924 --> 01:03:14,000
- You'll get us killed.
- It's boring.

708
01:03:14,218 --> 01:03:16,590
- Come here.
- What?

709
01:03:16,804 --> 01:03:18,548
Come here!

710
01:03:19,015 --> 01:03:23,926
- Come here, you.
- What do you want to do?

711
01:03:26,355 --> 01:03:29,025
Listen, you both have tidelands.

712
01:03:29,233 --> 01:03:34,358
You both want Uncle Sam to give you
drilling permits. Do it together.

713
01:03:39,744 --> 01:03:42,152
- Am I right?
- You're right.

714
01:03:42,372 --> 01:03:46,120
That son of a bitch.
Everything he says is phony.

715
01:03:46,334 --> 01:03:50,414
Does he think I'm some
cigar butt between his teeth?

716
01:03:56,511 --> 01:03:58,966
He ignores me.

717
01:04:06,771 --> 01:04:11,516
He could've at least introduced me
to someone. Couldn't he?

718
01:04:11,734 --> 01:04:13,359
You're drunk.

719
01:04:14,696 --> 01:04:17,732
Oh, George, what do I want?

720
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:22,278
How about some coffee?

721
01:04:22,495 --> 01:04:25,449
Hi, doll.
Say, what's wrong?

722
01:04:25,665 --> 01:04:27,954
You know what's wrong.

723
01:04:39,304 --> 01:04:42,424
Felicia. There you are.

724
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:47,765
We were just--
You know George. And...

725
01:04:55,695 --> 01:04:59,230
- Jackie Shawn.
- Jackie Shawn.

726
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:02,485
Yeah, my wi--
Felicia.

727
01:05:02,702 --> 01:05:03,865
We've met.

728
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,910
Anyway...

729
01:05:14,005 --> 01:05:17,457
Your hair looks just fabulous.

730
01:05:17,676 --> 01:05:20,511
- It's George.
- Just fabulous.

731
01:05:22,597 --> 01:05:26,677
- Wonder if he could do mine?
- I could try.

732
01:05:29,563 --> 01:05:32,599
Do you wash your hair every day?

733
01:05:32,816 --> 01:05:36,019
- Isn't that bad?
- No, it's very good.

734
01:05:36,236 --> 01:05:40,399
The skin has to peel, or else
the follicles can't breathe.

735
01:05:40,615 --> 01:05:45,526
That's how you lose your hair.
Remember, the follicle never dies.

736
01:05:47,664 --> 01:05:51,080
This here ought to be layered.

737
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:52,917
- Layered?
- Yeah.

738
01:05:53,128 --> 01:05:57,790
Otherwise it lies there and if
you layer it, it fluffs it out...

739
01:06:04,347 --> 01:06:06,470
Everybody's ready for dinner.

740
01:06:06,683 --> 01:06:09,601
Did they sit down?

741
01:06:09,811 --> 01:06:13,679
- We don't know where to sit.
- They're waiting for you.

742
01:06:13,899 --> 01:06:15,559
Waiter.

743
01:06:18,695 --> 01:06:22,029
One word out of you
and I'll gargle with it.

744
01:06:29,915 --> 01:06:34,992
You should've seen those kids,
senator. Forty of them, all blind.

745
01:06:35,212 --> 01:06:40,337
We put mattresses on the lawn.
They came stumbling out of the house.

746
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:44,169
Having a good time.
They were blind, of course.

747
01:06:44,388 --> 01:06:47,638
But it gave me a feeling
of accomplishment.

748
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:49,807
I had such a good time.

749
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:53,769
- Aren't you hungry?
- Not for rubber chicken.

750
01:06:53,981 --> 01:06:56,519
Maybe I can get you something.

751
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:59,853
That's very sweet of you,
Mr. Roth.

752
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,359
- Sid.
- Sid.

753
01:07:02,573 --> 01:07:07,531
You must be a very
important executive.

754
01:07:07,744 --> 01:07:11,956
Whatever I am, I can get
you whatever you'd like.

755
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:13,624
You do?

756
01:07:13,834 --> 01:07:17,535
- Whatever I'd like?
- Whatever you'd like.

757
01:07:17,755 --> 01:07:19,664
Most of all...

758
01:07:19,882 --> 01:07:23,547
...I'd like to suck his cock.

759
01:07:32,853 --> 01:07:35,688
Where is the school located again?

760
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:40,394
- The other side of Santa Barbara.
- Curious to see it sometime.

761
01:07:40,611 --> 01:07:45,024
I can't stand it. It's killing me.
Come on. Why not?

762
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,404
Come on. You don't want to?

763
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:55,409
- Who's the greatest cocksucker?
- You are.

764
01:07:56,961 --> 01:07:59,249
Fucking A!

765
01:08:02,424 --> 01:08:04,049
Excuse me, senator.

766
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:10,884
Your friend feeling
under the weather?

767
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,092
You phony asshole!

768
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:15,884
Oh, dear. Too bad.

769
01:08:17,648 --> 01:08:20,982
- Get her out of here.
- I'll go.

770
01:08:21,193 --> 01:08:23,233
- What was that?
- Illinois.

771
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:25,527
Oh, good.

772
01:08:26,407 --> 01:08:29,028
- I have to take her out of here.
- Okay.

773
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:31,283
- Take her home.
- Aren't you--?

774
01:08:31,495 --> 01:08:34,662
I'll see you later.
Johnny'll take me home.

775
01:08:42,047 --> 01:08:44,669
- Your coat.
- Fuck it!

776
01:08:44,884 --> 01:08:46,923
<i>We won't get a winner tonight.</i>

777
01:08:53,184 --> 01:08:58,309
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have been awarded the privilege...

778
01:08:58,522 --> 01:09:01,476
...of introducing our
guest of honor tonight.

779
01:09:01,692 --> 01:09:04,148
Are you all right?

780
01:09:04,362 --> 01:09:07,980
I'm just fine. Thanks.

781
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:11,864
--for the people, for the country...

782
01:09:12,078 --> 01:09:14,035
...for our Constitution.

783
01:09:14,246 --> 01:09:17,912
- Lester.
- Sweetheart, please.

784
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:20,830
I hope you like Miss Shawn.

785
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:23,121
What?

786
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:26,957
She's very nice, yeah.
I mean, normally she's--

787
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:30,177
Because she's going to be
very expensive.

788
01:09:30,388 --> 01:09:33,673
Sweetheart, can't we
go into this later?

789
01:09:35,017 --> 01:09:39,097
No. No, we cannot
go into this later.

790
01:09:39,313 --> 01:09:42,480
Well, that's okay too.

791
01:09:42,733 --> 01:09:45,984
--Senator Joe East.

792
01:09:49,824 --> 01:09:52,944
- I've blown it with Lester.
- I don't think so.

793
01:09:53,161 --> 01:09:57,454
- I thought you were great.
- You always say that.

794
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:02,245
And I really care for Lester, don't I?

795
01:10:04,255 --> 01:10:06,295
Where should we go? Sammy's?

796
01:10:06,507 --> 01:10:10,208
- Is he still having parties?
- He never stopped.

797
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:13,595
This tells the story of
the ancient grandmother...

798
01:10:13,806 --> 01:10:17,140
...who upon seeing the garden gate
of her childhood...

799
01:10:17,352 --> 01:10:21,729
...stops for a moment
and says, " Hello, garden gate.

800
01:10:21,939 --> 01:10:27,064
Hello, garden gate.
Garden gate, hello."

801
01:10:55,515 --> 01:10:57,591
Be straight with me, Lester.

802
01:10:57,809 --> 01:11:02,518
Just be straight with me
for once in your life.

803
01:11:03,106 --> 01:11:06,190
This party involves
more than you and me.

804
01:11:06,401 --> 01:11:09,070
These people care about
more than each other.

805
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:11,900
- Is that right?
- That's right.

806
01:11:12,115 --> 01:11:15,982
Some of us are trying to make
this country a better place.

807
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:19,203
Is that what it's all about?

808
01:11:19,414 --> 01:11:22,119
Yes, that's what it's all about.

809
01:11:23,334 --> 01:11:25,872
It's a beautiful thing he's doing.

810
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:45,221
I recall another ancient song.

811
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:50,351
My God, Lester. You're
a miserable human being.

812
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,646
You're not helping anybody.

813
01:11:53,073 --> 01:11:58,198
You're just twisting arms to raise
money for selfish sons of bitches.

814
01:12:02,207 --> 01:12:06,833
You think your business partner
will keep his hands off your girl?

815
01:12:07,045 --> 01:12:10,794
Or that she's gonna keep
her hands off him?

816
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:16,250
- What do you mean?
- Think what you have time to think.

817
01:12:22,352 --> 01:12:24,060
Excuse me, senator.

818
01:12:24,271 --> 01:12:27,936
Ladies and gentlemen,
evacuate this room quietly...

819
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:32,313
...and quickly.
There's nothing to worry about.

820
01:12:32,529 --> 01:12:34,854
Exit through the door on my right...

821
01:12:35,073 --> 01:12:37,944
...continue down the stairs,
into the street.

822
01:13:20,911 --> 01:13:22,405
For God's sake!

823
01:13:37,344 --> 01:13:39,550
You don't have to entertain me.

824
01:13:39,763 --> 01:13:42,384
- Am I entertaining you?
- We're friends.

825
01:13:42,599 --> 01:13:44,177
Sure.

826
01:13:44,393 --> 01:13:47,477
Go play.
There's a lot of players here.

827
01:13:47,688 --> 01:13:52,350
- George. Hey, how are you doing?
- What's happening?

828
01:13:52,568 --> 01:13:56,400
- You look good.
- Come on down to the jacuzzi.

829
01:13:56,613 --> 01:14:00,943
- We're going there now.
- No, no, I can't.

830
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:24,971
- What's the problem?
- His car is blocked.

831
01:14:25,934 --> 01:14:27,808
That's no problem.

832
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:31,555
- Gene, you want to move that truck?
- Sure.

833
01:14:31,774 --> 01:14:32,853
Thank you.

834
01:14:34,276 --> 01:14:38,772
Could you kids give me a ride?
I'm kind of stranded.

835
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:43,155
- Sure. Yeah. Come on.
- Good.

836
01:14:46,705 --> 01:14:48,663
You all right, son?

837
01:14:48,874 --> 01:14:51,911
I will be, as soon as
I can find my keys.

838
01:14:54,046 --> 01:14:55,540
I'll get in the back.

839
01:14:55,756 --> 01:14:59,421
- No, no.
- It's so little.

840
01:15:14,275 --> 01:15:17,560
You see, nothing to it.

841
01:15:20,156 --> 01:15:24,153
- What was your name, sweetheart?
- Jill.

842
01:15:24,952 --> 01:15:26,695
Jill.

843
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:28,822
Yeah, Jill.

844
01:15:29,331 --> 01:15:32,368
- That's wonderful, Jill.
- Thank you.

845
01:15:32,585 --> 01:15:34,458
Just wonderful.

846
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:46,011
Hi, what are we doing?

847
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:52,179
Mr. Karpf needed a ride home.
I said we'd take him. Do you mind?

848
01:15:52,396 --> 01:15:54,306
Of course not.

849
01:15:54,523 --> 01:15:56,765
Call me Les.

850
01:15:57,234 --> 01:15:59,939
Where to, Les?

851
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:03,190
Would you kids like to
stop off for a drink?

852
01:16:03,407 --> 01:16:07,275
We'd love to, but we're going
to another party.

853
01:16:07,495 --> 01:16:11,160
That's wonderful.
I'll stop off there for a drink.

854
01:16:28,307 --> 01:16:31,059
You never were a tit man, were you?

855
01:16:31,269 --> 01:16:32,679
Ass and legs.

856
01:16:34,313 --> 01:16:36,602
Look who's talking.

857
01:16:40,403 --> 01:16:43,688
Do you know why I used to
get so angry with you?

858
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:48,071
I wouldn't settle down.

859
01:16:48,536 --> 01:16:51,656
Because you're always so happy...

860
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,497
...about everything.

861
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:55,834
I was?

862
01:16:56,836 --> 01:17:00,170
I found it rather unrealistic.

863
01:17:03,134 --> 01:17:04,759
Your type.

864
01:17:05,845 --> 01:17:07,672
Very nice.

865
01:18:46,071 --> 01:18:48,692
- You want children?
- I don't think about it.

866
01:18:48,907 --> 01:18:53,616
There's so much to do and so many
places to go while I'm still free.

867
01:18:53,828 --> 01:18:56,450
You know, unattached.

868
01:20:44,565 --> 01:20:46,853
We're kidding ourselves.

869
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,558
We are?

870
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:54,777
You know, last night I had a dream.

871
01:20:54,992 --> 01:20:58,408
I was 50 years old...

872
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:02,914
...and I was supposed to
meet Jill at the shop.

873
01:21:04,376 --> 01:21:07,959
Boy, it scared the hell out of me.

874
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:10,627
Why?

875
01:21:15,012 --> 01:21:18,381
I can't imagine being
with Jill when I'm 50.

876
01:21:25,898 --> 01:21:28,768
I can't imagine not being with you.

877
01:22:23,247 --> 01:22:25,489
When do you go to Egypt?

878
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,784
Two weeks from tomorrow.

879
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:30,502
Same time you do.

880
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:33,291
You're kidding.

881
01:22:33,507 --> 01:22:35,299
Really?

882
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:42,390
I don't know how to say this.

883
01:22:43,017 --> 01:22:45,306
Would you like to come home with me?

884
01:23:02,078 --> 01:23:05,743
- Hi.
- Hi.

885
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:07,951
Come on in.

886
01:23:09,377 --> 01:23:10,954
Yeah?

887
01:23:11,546 --> 01:23:13,455
Why not?

888
01:23:25,435 --> 01:23:28,471
We shouldn't leave that
poor man here alone.

889
01:23:28,688 --> 01:23:30,396
Les? He won't care.

890
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:34,770
I know. But let's go
tell him we're leaving.

891
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:39,687
What is it, man?

892
01:23:41,326 --> 01:23:44,944
- Where can I get a towel?
- By the tennis court.

893
01:23:47,749 --> 01:23:49,326
Thanks.

894
01:24:29,124 --> 01:24:31,661
That's what I call fucking.

895
01:24:35,672 --> 01:24:38,245
Am I right or am I right?

896
01:24:38,466 --> 01:24:41,752
Come on, Les. Let's get out of here.

897
01:24:55,608 --> 01:24:57,019
Oh, my God!

898
01:24:58,445 --> 01:24:59,987
You bastard!

899
01:25:00,947 --> 01:25:04,197
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

900
01:25:04,409 --> 01:25:07,576
You son of a bitch!

901
01:25:07,787 --> 01:25:10,243
- Jill?
- Oh, God!

902
01:25:10,457 --> 01:25:11,702
Baby?

903
01:25:14,753 --> 01:25:19,296
Jesus, what shall I do?
I better get her. Wait here.

904
01:25:19,507 --> 01:25:22,544
Jill! Jill!

905
01:25:23,136 --> 01:25:25,674
Honey! Jill!

906
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:29,200
Jackie! Honey? Shit.

907
01:26:30,203 --> 01:26:34,201
Jackie! Jackie!

908
01:27:05,531 --> 01:27:07,239
Jill?

909
01:27:21,505 --> 01:27:26,001
This is George Roundy.
I left a message earlier for Jackie.

910
01:27:26,218 --> 01:27:28,507
Has she picked it up yet?

911
01:27:33,308 --> 01:27:36,843
No, just tell her I called twice.
Thank you.

912
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,431
- Want me to come in with you?
- No.

913
01:28:19,647 --> 01:28:22,731
I'll call you in a few minutes.

914
01:28:45,131 --> 01:28:46,791
I don't want to fight.

915
01:28:47,007 --> 01:28:50,507
I don't want to fight either.
I'm sorry.

916
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,677
Bullshit.

917
01:28:55,349 --> 01:28:57,638
- Why didn't he come in?
- I didn't want him to.

918
01:28:57,852 --> 01:29:01,766
I hope he doesn't mind me.
Did you get a job out of it?

919
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:04,223
I'd like you to leave now.

920
01:29:05,693 --> 01:29:07,567
And take this with you.

921
01:29:10,573 --> 01:29:14,617
- Where did this come from?
- Who knows? I'm sure you don't.

922
01:29:14,827 --> 01:29:18,196
But if it'll help any,
I found it in your bed.

923
01:29:20,416 --> 01:29:23,832
Obviously there were others.
Weren't there?

924
01:29:25,922 --> 01:29:27,464
Obviously.

925
01:29:27,673 --> 01:29:29,132
- How many?
- Why?

926
01:29:29,342 --> 01:29:32,627
- Because I want to know.
- What's the difference?

927
01:29:33,304 --> 01:29:36,221
I don't want girls knowing
and me not knowing.

928
01:29:36,432 --> 01:29:38,472
- Don't do this.
- It'll help me.

929
01:29:38,684 --> 01:29:40,724
- It'll help me.
- How?

930
01:29:40,937 --> 01:29:44,353
I'll know that you've
lied to me all along.

931
01:29:44,565 --> 01:29:49,690
I'll know that you're incapable
of love, and that'll help me.

932
01:30:02,083 --> 01:30:04,075
If it'll do any good.

933
01:30:04,293 --> 01:30:08,243
I just--
You really want to know?

934
01:30:09,173 --> 01:30:10,253
Yes.

935
01:30:13,177 --> 01:30:18,302
There were a couple--
I mean there--

936
01:30:21,769 --> 01:30:24,141
Let's face it. I fucked them all.

937
01:30:24,397 --> 01:30:28,181
That's what I do. That's why I
went to beauty school.

938
01:30:28,401 --> 01:30:31,188
They're always there, and I--

939
01:30:33,281 --> 01:30:38,073
I don't know why I'm apologizing.
So sometimes I fuck them.

940
01:30:39,746 --> 01:30:43,197
I go into that shop
and they're so great-looking.

941
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:47,959
I do their hair. They feel and smell
great. I'd be on the street...

942
01:30:48,171 --> 01:30:53,296
...at a stoplight, or go
into an elevator. There's...

943
01:30:53,509 --> 01:30:56,843
...a beautiful girl. I don't know.

944
01:30:57,055 --> 01:30:59,546
That's it. It makes my day.

945
01:30:59,766 --> 01:31:02,933
It makes me feel like
I'm gonna live forever.

946
01:31:03,144 --> 01:31:06,928
As far as I'm concerned with what
I'd liked to have done in my life...

947
01:31:07,148 --> 01:31:12,273
I know I should've accomplished more
but I have no regrets. I mean...

948
01:31:19,411 --> 01:31:21,866
Maybe that means I don't love them.

949
01:31:22,288 --> 01:31:24,993
Maybe it means I don't love you.

950
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:29,166
Nobody's gonna tell me
I don't like them very much.

951
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:36,044
Jesus.

952
01:31:46,563 --> 01:31:48,769
I'm glad you told me.

953
01:31:57,157 --> 01:31:59,730
I wish you'd go now.

954
01:32:39,533 --> 01:32:44,325
Hi. No, everything's fine, really.

955
01:33:26,163 --> 01:33:28,286
How long have you been here?

956
01:33:28,498 --> 01:33:30,325
All night.

957
01:33:31,376 --> 01:33:33,665
You live like a pig.

958
01:33:34,755 --> 01:33:36,379
Yeah.

959
01:33:37,216 --> 01:33:39,504
Hal, wait outside.

960
01:33:40,636 --> 01:33:45,214
<i>Having lost eight years
ago and won this year, I can say...</i>

961
01:33:45,432 --> 01:33:48,137
<i>...that winning's a lot more fun.</i>

962
01:33:48,352 --> 01:33:49,763
Who are those guys?

963
01:33:49,978 --> 01:33:51,805
What do they look like?

964
01:33:54,191 --> 01:33:57,062
You unhappy about something, Lester?

965
01:33:57,486 --> 01:33:59,313
Sit down.

966
01:33:59,947 --> 01:34:02,864
- Now wait a minute--
- I said sit down.

967
01:34:07,538 --> 01:34:11,915
Either you admit it, or I'll see
they pound it out of you.

968
01:34:12,126 --> 01:34:14,165
- They do it well.
- Okay.

969
01:34:14,628 --> 01:34:17,036
I want to know about it.

970
01:34:17,256 --> 01:34:20,257
- Jesus.
- I want to know how you think.

971
01:34:20,467 --> 01:34:23,801
Have them put me away, or whatever...

972
01:34:24,013 --> 01:34:27,761
Do you get your kicks by
taking advantage of people?

973
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:32,180
- Trying to be anti-establishment?
- I'm not anti-establishment.

974
01:34:32,396 --> 01:34:36,394
- You have something against me?
- You think I planned it?

975
01:34:36,609 --> 01:34:40,523
Jackie, Felicia.
Did they have something against me?

976
01:34:40,738 --> 01:34:44,570
- They could be pissed about something.
- Tell me.

977
01:34:44,783 --> 01:34:49,244
I don't know what they've got
against you. They're women, right?

978
01:34:49,705 --> 01:34:54,082
Ever listen to women talk?
I do till it's running out my ears.

979
01:34:54,335 --> 01:34:59,127
They only talk about one thing:
How some guy fucked them over.

980
01:34:59,965 --> 01:35:05,304
That's all that's on their minds.
That's all I ever hear about.

981
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,384
I follow your thinking on that.

982
01:35:08,599 --> 01:35:11,766
They know we're always
trying to nail them.

983
01:35:11,977 --> 01:35:15,927
They don't like it.
They like it and they don't like it.

984
01:35:16,607 --> 01:35:20,308
It's got nothing to do with you.
It just happened.

985
01:35:20,528 --> 01:35:23,445
Felicia just shops,
gets her hair done.

986
01:35:23,656 --> 01:35:27,404
- She's aging. Her daughter hates her.
- Wait a minute.

987
01:35:28,452 --> 01:35:30,943
You think Lorna hates her?

988
01:35:32,289 --> 01:35:37,284
- She may resent her a little, but--
- Are you kidding? She hates her.

989
01:35:37,503 --> 01:35:39,081
Why?

990
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:43,675
- I mean, why is that?
- How would I know?

991
01:35:46,887 --> 01:35:48,465
I don't know.

992
01:35:55,146 --> 01:35:56,806
You want a drink?

993
01:35:58,024 --> 01:35:59,566
No, thanks.

994
01:35:59,817 --> 01:36:03,268
- Oh, have a drink.
- Okay. Thanks.

995
01:36:03,487 --> 01:36:08,612
There ain't a clean glass here.
Jesus Christ. What a way to live.

996
01:36:10,369 --> 01:36:13,489
I never lived like this,
even at your age.

997
01:36:13,873 --> 01:36:16,411
Not even when I never had a dime.

998
01:36:19,504 --> 01:36:23,288
It's a hell of a way to treat
a business partner.

999
01:36:23,674 --> 01:36:26,841
- Who?
- Me.

1000
01:36:27,512 --> 01:36:32,933
- You weren't gonna give me the money.
- I was gonna give you the money.

1001
01:36:33,601 --> 01:36:35,594
Probably, I would've.

1002
01:36:36,562 --> 01:36:38,389
Shit, I don't know.

1003
01:36:41,192 --> 01:36:43,517
I don't know anything anymore.

1004
01:36:46,823 --> 01:36:51,449
But you never know.
One minute, you're here, the next--

1005
01:36:54,747 --> 01:36:59,208
I just wish I knew
what the hell I was living for.

1006
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:03,754
<i>A teenager held up the sign,
"Bring Us Together"...</i>

1007
01:37:03,965 --> 01:37:07,334
<i>...and that will be
the great objective...</i>

1008
01:37:07,593 --> 01:37:10,713
<i>...of this administration
at the outset.</i>

1009
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:13,765
<i>To bring the American people together.</i>

1010
01:37:13,975 --> 01:37:16,727
<i>This will be an open administration.</i>

1011
01:37:16,978 --> 01:37:20,429
You can lose it all,
no matter who you are.

1012
01:37:20,648 --> 01:37:22,724
Why have it all?

1013
01:37:24,193 --> 01:37:29,188
Market went down 10 points last week.
Goddamn Lyndon Johnson!

1014
01:37:29,616 --> 01:37:33,660
Yeah, well...

1015
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:36,277
...maybe Nixon will be better.

1016
01:37:37,081 --> 01:37:40,865
What's the difference?
They're all a bunch of jerks.

1017
01:37:43,755 --> 01:37:46,080
I don't know what to do with you.

1018
01:37:47,467 --> 01:37:50,040
I don't know what's right or wrong.

1019
01:37:52,305 --> 01:37:54,630
At least you do what you want.

1020
01:37:54,849 --> 01:37:58,135
But me? I'm shit.

1021
01:37:58,353 --> 01:38:00,476
What about Jackie?

1022
01:38:01,314 --> 01:38:06,391
Never mind. She's a whore. I go over,
have drinks, get my gun off.

1023
01:38:06,611 --> 01:38:09,398
I'm through with her. She's a whore.

1024
01:38:09,614 --> 01:38:12,022
You could call everybody a whore.

1025
01:38:12,242 --> 01:38:16,109
She really likes you.
It's not just the bread.

1026
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:20,827
- You think so?
- Yes, I do.

1027
01:38:21,084 --> 01:38:23,207
No, I'm through with her.

1028
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:36,847
By the way, you want me
to say hello to Lorna for you?

1029
01:38:41,229 --> 01:38:43,851
What the hell, go easy on him.

1030
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:51,358
Just having a little fun.

1031
01:38:52,908 --> 01:38:55,114
Come on, Hal. Let's go home.

1032
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:59,075
Listen. I'll call you
tomorrow about the shop.

1033
01:39:02,042 --> 01:39:04,081
Christ, I'm beat.

1034
01:39:12,761 --> 01:39:17,257
Devra, call Jackie Shawn.
Keep trying till you get her.

1035
01:39:17,474 --> 01:39:21,554
Mrs. Schumann and Mrs. Young
are waiting for you.

1036
01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:25,353
She's on the Rolodex.
Will you get her? Sorry.

1037
01:39:26,441 --> 01:39:29,526
- Where's Mary?
- She's with Norman.

1038
01:39:30,779 --> 01:39:33,566
I asked you to call Jackie. Do it.

1039
01:39:33,782 --> 01:39:36,190
- Mary will have to wash--
- Not today.

1040
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:40,359
What are you talking about?
What's going on here?

1041
01:39:41,498 --> 01:39:45,578
I'm not the shampoo girl.
Can you give me a little help?

1042
01:39:45,794 --> 01:39:50,586
- What's wrong with Norman?
- Settle down. His son was killed.

1043
01:39:51,717 --> 01:39:54,338
- Killed?
- Car accident.

1044
01:40:02,477 --> 01:40:04,137
Near Oceanside...

1045
01:40:04,354 --> 01:40:06,680
...on his way back to Pendleton.

1046
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:12,017
It was foggy and a truck jumped
the divider on the freeway.

1047
01:40:13,197 --> 01:40:15,189
Lord, have mercy.

1048
01:40:51,151 --> 01:40:53,191
Just a minute. Almost ready.

1049
01:41:00,119 --> 01:41:01,910
Where you going?

1050
01:41:02,204 --> 01:41:06,665
- Oh! You'll have to go.
- I gotta leave?

1051
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:10,209
- Honey, you have to get out of here.
- Why?

1052
01:41:10,421 --> 01:41:12,544
Lester's on his way.

1053
01:41:13,757 --> 01:41:17,506
- Where are you going?
- We'll talk about it later.

1054
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:22,382
- Honey, about last night--
- Oh, forget about it. It's okay.

1055
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:26,218
- We'll talk when I get back.
- I want to talk now.

1056
01:41:26,437 --> 01:41:29,106
- Where you going?
- You leave, or I will.

1057
01:41:29,315 --> 01:41:32,980
I don't want the two of us here
when Lester comes.

1058
01:41:35,779 --> 01:41:37,487
That's him.

1059
01:41:42,203 --> 01:41:44,741
- It's a cleaner.
- Fine. I'm leaving!

1060
01:41:51,754 --> 01:41:52,999
Honey.

1061
01:41:56,092 --> 01:41:57,586
Cleaners.

1062
01:43:35,608 --> 01:43:37,684
You're gonna kill me.

1063
01:43:38,486 --> 01:43:41,024
What are you trying to do?

1064
01:43:43,032 --> 01:43:44,859
I want you to marry me.

1065
01:43:46,077 --> 01:43:50,538
I want to take care of you.
I want you to have a baby with me.

1066
01:43:51,082 --> 01:43:56,040
I'm a fuck-up, but I'll take
care of you. I'll make you happy.

1067
01:44:00,258 --> 01:44:01,800
What do you think?

1068
01:44:05,555 --> 01:44:07,263
It's too late.

1069
01:44:07,765 --> 01:44:12,095
We're not dead yet.
That's the only thing that's too late.

1070
01:44:13,897 --> 01:44:18,190
Lester's left Felicia.
We're going to Acapulco today.

1071
01:44:18,401 --> 01:44:20,643
He's asked me to marry him.

1072
01:44:28,328 --> 01:44:29,822
Honey.

1073
01:44:31,873 --> 01:44:33,996
Honey, please.

1074
01:44:35,251 --> 01:44:36,911
Please, honey.

1075
01:44:46,763 --> 01:44:49,052
I don't trust anybody but you.

1076
01:44:51,726 --> 01:44:53,386
Baby.

1077
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,301
- Lester's at the house.
- Don't go, honey. Please don't.

1078
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:32,641
I have to go. I can't just leave
him standing there. I have to go.

1079
01:46:56,894 --> 01:46:59,135
The puppies are in the car.

1080
01:47:00,981 --> 01:47:06,224
I can't think of anything else,
so why don't we just take off?

1081
01:47:07,881 --> 01:47:09,924
Okay?
