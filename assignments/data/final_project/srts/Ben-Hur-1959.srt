1
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,009
Ben.

2
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,096
Ben, i...

3
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,167
Ben!

4
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,214
I'm gonna kill you!

5
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,389
This is sickening.
Let's get Danny home.

6
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,638
No, no, I want to
find out what happened.

7
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,689
I'm not tired anyway.

8
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,311
You'll be tired by the time
we get home. Come on.

9
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,027
It's only two blocks.

10
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,322
It's three.
It's a long walk for you.

11
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,398
You've seen enough.

12
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,454
Do you mind if my man covers it?

13
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,285
Go ahead.

14
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,621
Adams!

15
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,286
All right.

16
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,372
Hatfield.

17
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,247
Play the story down a little,
will you?

18
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,838
First, al Martin,
now Willard stiles.

19
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,215
Both of them torn to pieces
the same way.

20
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,219
How?
How do I play it down?

21
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,715
- Ever seen a panic?
- Panic sells papers.

22
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,479
- You gonna show me the diary?
- No.

23
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,154
- Look, lieutenant, you...
Lieutenant!

24
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,578
Men have been through
every room in the house.

25
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,450
The cellar, the back yard,
no rats.

26
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,142
Okay. Tell them to check the
rest of the houses on the block.

27
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,286
Will do.

28
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,627
What's so important
about the diary?

29
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,182
Give us a chance to study it,
will you, hatfield?

30
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,467
You didn't answer my question.

31
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,891
You don't listen too well.

32
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,945
Well, you'll start
listening well tomorrow,

33
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,477
when you read the papers.

34
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,520
You gonna give that diary
to the press?

35
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,186
Oh, yeah, of course. Socrates,
Ben, Willard "king of the rats".

36
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,188
Come on, Joe.
I'm not that crazy.

37
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,072
What have you got, cliff?

38
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,624
I wish to god I knew.

39
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,068
Kelly.

40
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,719
Keep an eye
on the front of the building.

41
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,069
- Reade, take the rear.
- Right.

42
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,371
Border patrolmen will take over
at 6:00 A.M.

43
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,421
- You afraid of rats?
- Nah.

44
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,730
They're easy to handle.
Give them a chance,

45
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,180
they'll always
run away from you.

46
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,183
I know that, you know that,
but do they know that?

47
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,809
Every animal will run away
if you give it a chance.

48
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,271
We're the only ones
that keep coming.

49
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,335
Kelly!

50
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,139
Kelly!

51
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,431
Kelly!
For god's sake! Kelly!

52
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,380
Sir, the door was open.

53
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,801
The light was on and there were
dead rats all over.

54
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,757
But all I was... all I saw...

55
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,064
I saw him, i saw him.

56
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,268
Now, take it easy, Kelly.
Take it easy.

57
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,148
Yes.
And then there was traffic.

58
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,565
There was traffic on the street.

59
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,199
And I heard some shots.

60
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,907
Okay, Kelly, thanks.

61
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,661
Come on, you guys, move!

62
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,486
Get the rest
of those panels off!

63
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,905
Come on, Kelly,
you give them a hand, too.

64
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,038
- Joe! Damn it! Joe!
- What?

65
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,786
I wasn't talking to you!

66
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,961
Get that exterminator
down here tonight!

67
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,691
I mean, tonight. Not tomorrow.
Tonight!

68
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,559
I want this place gassed
from top to bottom.

69
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,823
I don't want a microbe alive
in here when they're through!

70
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,893
Yes, sir.

71
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,965
You wish to disclose something
to the press, lieutenant?

72
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,346
Just what the hell would I say?

73
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,562
To start, you could tell me
what the hell

74
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,480
you're hiding in that diary.

75
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,861
Hatfield, you won't
believe it either.

76
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,066
Try me.

77
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,662
Willard stiles trained
thousands of intelligent rats.

78
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,784
Don't put me on.

79
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,180
Don't run, Danny.

80
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,934
I know how fast I can go.

81
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,104
Come on, Danny.

82
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,896
(Alright)!-

83
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,861
mom can't sell dresses
that look like that.

84
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,624
They look silly.

85
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,664
Well, lots of good dresses
look silly.

86
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,952
Not that silly.

87
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,124
All right, critic.

88
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,290
There's a sandwich
in your workshop for you.

89
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,793
Good deal.

90
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,166
I'll eat the sandwich,
you try and fix the sketches.

91
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,586
- Where's Danny?
- Workshop.

92
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,131
He should be in the house.
I don't like him out there

93
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,181
- all by himself.
Well, he's safe enough.

94
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,732
It is not safe.
There are men all over.

95
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,102
Searching houses, police cars,
exterminators, everything.

96
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,072
- Did he rest today?
- Not much.

97
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,324
- So stubborn.
- That's what's kept him alive.

98
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,777
He's trying
to take his father's place.

99
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,567
That's what's kept him alive.

100
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,584
And you.

101
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,538
Maybe.

102
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,712
God! It's not fair.

103
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,169
I wish you had a chance
to go out once in a while.

104
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,591
You don't have any
life of your own anymore,

105
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,336
just the house and Danny.

106
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,425
He's my brother.

107
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,801
A girl your age is entitled.

108
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,430
Mother, we're a family.
We'll make it out.

109
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,718
He's going to make it, mother.

110
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,296
He will.

Come on in.
I wouldn't hurt you.

128
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,974
I wouldn't.

129
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,070
Come on, get your lunch.

130
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,950
Oh, oh, you're welcome.

131
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,481
Hey, we're talking!

132
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,174
Oh, my god! Oh, god!

133
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,304
Oh! Oh!

134
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,073
Why?

135
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,898
Never saw people
look like that before.

136
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,193
I did once.

137
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,935
In a town of West Virginia.

138
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,608
They were bringing some bodies
out of a mine shaft.

139
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,220
That was Sally Harper
on the phone.

140
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,804
They're getting out of the city,
going to their beach house.

141
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,577
The Harpers were
leaving town anyway.

142
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,019
Sally's just being dramatic.

143
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,482
How can you be
so complacent, Eve?

144
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,898
Police.

145
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,235
Uh, excuse me, ma'am,

146
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,948
have you seen any evidence
of rats around here?

147
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,362
No.

148
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,582
I'd like to bring some men
around tomorrow

149
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,202
to spread some rat traps
and some poison.

150
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,917
- Is anyone going to be at home?
- Oh, my daughter will be here.

151
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,538
Right. You're...
You're Mrs. Garrison, right?

152
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,916
Yes. This is my daughter, Eve.

153
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,882
How do you do?

154
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,438
All right,
thank you, Mrs. Garrison.

155
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,336
We'll be along
sometime in the morning, miss.

156
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,795
Is there any danger?

157
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,559
No, just a precautionary
measure, Mrs. Garrison.

158
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,063
See you tomorrow.
Thank you.

159
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,738
I'll try to get back
before dark.

160
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,240
Don't worry, mother.

161
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,205
And I'm not complacent about it.

162
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,089
Don't help me.

163
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,594
- I have a friend.
- Who?

164
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,967
- A rat.
- A rat? Where?

165
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,386
He had to leave.
He had things to do.

166
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,392
Where was it? Where, Danny?

167
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,805
It wasn't a real rat, mother.

168
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,729
Sure was.

169
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,940
We talked to each other.

170
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,315
Never had a rat friend before.

171
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,698
- Maybe he was Ben.
- Who is Ben?

172
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,671
That's the name
of the leader of the rats.

173
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,429
There were some pages
from Willard's diary

174
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,701
in the newspapers.

175
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,831
Ben, that's a nice name.

176
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,418
The man on the radio says
there are millions of rats.

177
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,754
More rats in the world
than people.

178
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,506
- They're getting bigger.
- Danny, stop it.

179
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,604
The police
will handle things, mother.

180
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,599
Maybe I ought to close the shop.

181
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,851
There's nothing in the shop
the rats would want.

182
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,728
Nobody's buying anyway-

183
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,440
we'll just keep
the food covered.

184
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,438
We'll be all right.

185
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:53,818
Let's take a rest, slugger.

186
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,988
Ben, the two of us
need look no more.

187
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:54,246
We've both found
what we were looking for.

188
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,842
With a friend to call my own,

189
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,925
I'll never be alone.

190
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,931
And you, my friend, will see,

191
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,185
you've got a friend in me.

192
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:26,403
Ben, you're always
running here and there.

193
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,707
You feel
you're not wanted anywhere.

194
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,589
If you ever look behind

195
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,473
and don't like what you find

196
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,262
there is something
you should know.

197
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,018
You've got a place to go.

198
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,157
I left your dinner
in the oven, mother.

199
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,536
Our new shipment came in
just as I left.

200
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,037
Hemmed them myself. Elsie quit.

201
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,707
Oh, no.

202
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,674
It's almost nine o'clock.

203
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,335
Well let him
finish playing, mother.

204
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,183
The doctor said...

205
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,018
A few minutes more or less
won't make that much difference.

206
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,727
- What are you playing, Danny?
- I made it up.

207
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,400
- It's for my friend.
- Lt's pretty.

208
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,189
- What do you call it?
- "Ben's song".

I saved something for you.

Rats did that last night.

I mean, the real Ben.

You can tell me.
I don't care.

247
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,642
I know you
and your friends are hungry.

248
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,180
Just that you've got to learn

249
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,059
not to take so much
from each place.

250
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,530
It upsets people.

251
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,912
I wrote a song for you.

252
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,372
They had to cut off my chest
to fix my heart.

253
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,618
I gotta go slow, Ben.

254
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,299
See.

255
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,917
Miss. Garrison.

256
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,132
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

257
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,378
Uh, we're gonna have to get
under your house, miss.

258
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,837
Any rats around?

259
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,510
- Just an imaginary one.
- Hmm?

260
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,513
Well, my little brother collects
imaginary animals.

261
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,603
Oh. Well, the rats we're
looking for are real, miss.

262
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,226
Very real.
Thank you.

263
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,166
Fellas, we're
gonna have <i>to</i> to <i>hurry</i> this up.

264
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,033

blocks to cover.</i>

265
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,337
It's the police, Ben.

266
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,974
They might see you.

267
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,973
I know what I'll do.

268
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,150
Come on, stay in there, Ben.
You don't want to get found out.

269
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,610
That's it.

270
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,921
Don't talk now, Ben.

271
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,671
- Hello, son.
- Hi.

272
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,264
What are you doing?

273
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,350
Well, we're
rat proofing your house.

274
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,346
Do you have any dogs or cats?

275
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,098
No, sir.

276
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,941
Well, that's rat poison,
so you be sure

277
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,475
and keep all neighborhood pets
away from here, okay?

278
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,439
Sonny, when you build
your house,

279
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,324
put a cellar under it.

280
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,449
And if you see any rats,
tell your sister, all right?

281
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,291
But I already
told her about Ben.

282
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,999
Sonny, this is
no time for jokes.

283
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,415
If you see any real rats,
tell your sister, all right?

284
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,789
But I already did.

285
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,428
And don't crawl around
under there.

286
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,393
We've set traps.

287
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,316
Ben.

288
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,238
Wait here.

289
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,827
Ben, this is a trap.

290
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,464
Trap. It can kill you, Ben.

291
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,256
Watch.

292
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,143
Watch.

293
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,891
Don't go near things
like that, Ben.

294
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,063
Understand?

295
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,949
You understood what I said,
didn't you, Ben?

296
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:14,939
You better go home now, Ben,

297
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,977
and don't get
in any more trouble.

298
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:35,789
Hey, kid!

299
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,264
What have you got in that box?

300
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,475
- You live there?
- Yeah.

301
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,897
How come
you don't ever come out?

302
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,977
You're a sissy, that's what!

303
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,443
I bet you play with dolls,
just like a girl.

304
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,950
- I do not!
- Sure, you do!

305
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,776
Sure, you do! Go on, say it!

306
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,873
I do not!
Ouch, let go of my arm.

307
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,408
Not until you say it.

308
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,538
Go on! Say it!

309
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,464
Come on, say it.

310
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,379
- I will not!
- You better say it!

311
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,795
Hey! They're biting me!
They're biting me!

312
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:30,636
Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother!

313
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,466
You shouldn't pick on people.

314
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,114
<i>- Danny, lunch is ready.
- Coming, Eve.</i>

315
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:44,606
Bye, ben.

316
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,497
Now, you just sit here, dear.

317
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,338
If you people really cared about
the little people of this city

318
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,013
- this wouldn't have happened.
- Yes, ma'am.

319
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,095
Danny, this boy said
you saw some rats attack him.

320
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,308
That's a big lie!
There were hundreds of them.

321
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,904
And he sicced them on me.

322
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,651
Suppose you tell us
what happened, son.

323
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:32,117
I was in the alley,
he started after me.

324
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,945
He fell down in a rose bush.

325
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,999
That's a big lie.

326
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,575
Were you picking
on this little boy, Henry?

327
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,881
I didn't hurt him.

328
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,589
- Henry, if you're lying to me...
- He fell in a rose bush.

329
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,394
Look, son,
this is very important.

330
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,636
- Did you see any rats?
- Just Ben.

331
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,515
He stays in the workshop.

332
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,774
- Ben?
- I told you about him.

333
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,937
I don't understand
what's going on here.

334
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,396
I bet he keeps rats
in his garage.

335
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,659
- You mind showing Ben to us?
- If you want.

336
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,172
I don't like to be helped.

337
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,216
Okay, son.

338
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,768
All right, now. Show me Ben.

339
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,072
Sure!

340
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,898
Danny!

341
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,954
Oh, you just met Ben.

342
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,535
I think we better look
for a rose bush, Mrs. gray.

343
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,128
Come in.

344
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,264
Danny, remember our deal?
Always the whole truth.

345
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,431
Yeah.

346
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,017
Well...

347
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,115
Were you telling the truth
to Mr. kirtland

348
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,436
about that other boy?

349
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,475
I don't have a deal
with Mr. kirtland.

350
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,607
Danny, why?

351
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,658
They're putting poison
underneath all the houses.

352
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,452
Killing all the rats.

353
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,794
I don't want them to kill Ben.

354
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:24,115
These are real rats, Danny.
Rats are dangerous!

355
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,205
Some rats are okay.

356
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,750
Are you hiding something?

357
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,920
Wanna talk about it?

358
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,797
- I guess not.
- Come on, Danny,

359
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,799
- let's stop this.
- Am I gonna die?

360
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,720
Everybody dies, Danny.

361
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,394
I mean, am I gonna die soon?

362
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:49,016
I don't think so,
not if you're careful.

363
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:53,823
What did Dr. Marcus say?

364
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,736
He said you might have to have
another operation.

365
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,083
Did he say I might die?

366
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,906
Yes, he did. Might.

367
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,287
I like to know things
the way they are.

368
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,045
And now you do. So do I.

369
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,587
You always tell me the truth.

370
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,061
You're my brother,
and I love you.

371
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,642
I won't die! I won't!

372
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:36,954
Don't read too late.

373
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,168
Okay, okay, wait a second.

374
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,314
Hi, Ben. Policemen came.

375
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,599
I told them a big lie.

376
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,640
Eve's all mad at me.

377
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,770
I told them
Henry fell in a rose bush.

378
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,074
Probably wishes he did.

379
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,370
I love you, Ben.

380
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,212
Now, look, kirtland...

381
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,251
We've been over this before
and over and over.

382
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,972
We have searched
200 miles of drain.

383
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,803
- Nothing!
- You look.

384
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,945
Here's the supermarket,
here's Willard's house...

385
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,280
- Yeah.
- The truck, the candy factory,

386
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,914
Martin's factory.
They are ten miles apart.

387
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,621
What else could those rats be
using but the drains?

388
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,661
Are you saying the rats
walk through ten miles of drain

389
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,165
pop out, attack
and then pop in again?

390
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,441
- Yeah
- oh, hell. Kirtland!

391
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,164
I want every drain
in the city examined.

392
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,283
- All 1,150 miles of pipe?
- Every inch of it.

393
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,403
Don't make me go over your head.

394
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,081
All right.

395
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,869
All right, I'll put 30 teams out
working day and night.

396
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,617
How long will that take?

397
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,577
Five days minimum.

398
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,711
You got 24 hours, maximum.

399
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,273
Not so hard, damn it!

400
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,911
How dare you?

401
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,367
Having fun, Ben?

402
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,587
- Ready to stop?

403
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:09,184
Well. Okay, Ben.
Everybody out.

404
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,266
Time to go home.

405
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:36,241
You're the best friend
i ever had.

406
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,711
Say, do you think you could
show me where you live?

407
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,007
Great.

408
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:53,514
Oh, we have to be careful.
You scare people.

409
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,059
Hey, that's an idea. Yeah.

410
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,150
You stay in there,
I'll bring you down to the alley

411
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,902
and then you show me. Okay.

412
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,278
Oops, don't fall now.

413
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,293
Oh, I am going the right way,
eh, ben?

414
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,742
All right.

415
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,213
Just wanted you to tell me that.

416
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,081
Turn right here?

417
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:27,634
Turn at the corner. All right.

418
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,391
That's where it is, eh, Ben?

419
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,349
Don't let them see you, Ben?

420
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:48,941
All right. Go on.

421
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,674
I could swear there was a kid
there on the corner.

422
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,296
You're seeing things
again, elmo.

423
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,014
Now, I'm completely out of touch
of reality.

424
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,676
Yeah, me, too.

425
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:26,807
Wait for me, Ben.

426
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,557
This is where your home is?

427
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,477
Hold a second.
I wanna, I wanna see it.

428
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,424
Well, you sure
have a big family, Ben.

429
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,276
Oh, boy.
You have a wonderful house.

430
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,908
I'd better go now.
It's getting kind of late.

431
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,115
Ah, I'm gonna get yelled at.

432
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,583
Thanks for showing me
around your house.

433
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,251
Bye, ben.

434
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,993
Ladies and gentlemen,

435
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,215
as of this moment the police
have been unable to find

436
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,660
the source of the plague of rats

437
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,535
<i>which has been
terrorizing our city.</i>

438
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,327
Commissioner pole stated today

439
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,705
<i>that unless a successful
and positive action is taken</i>

440
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:56,543
to find and destroy the rats,

441
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,960
<i>he will ask the governor
to declare this city</i>

442
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,747
<i>a disaster</i> area.

443
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,462
Keep tuned to the station
for complete...

444
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:22,821
Hi, Ben. Good you brought
some of your family.

445
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,167
Business is way off.

446
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,630
Things will pick up
again, mother.

447
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,850
Wish we could
move Danny upstairs.

448
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,772
Why, mother?

449
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:57,984
He left his window open again
last night.

450
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,185
- Did you tell him about it?
- He never listens to me anymore.

451
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:05,282
I'm losing him
a little bit every day.

452
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,645
I wish I could
spend more time with him.

453
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:09,321
He listens to you, mother.

454
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,909
He just has a strange way
of showing it.

455
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,078
- He has so many talents.
- Oh!

456
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,293
I'd trade all of that
for one good heart.

457
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,415
Mother, he's...

458
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,997
I'll go check his window.

459
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,904
Oh, no!

460
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,327
- What's the matter?
- Rats.

461
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,552
There were rats on his bed.
I saw one on Danny's neck.

462
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,408
Rats! Did they bite you?
Oh, my god!

463
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,500
It was just Ben and Mrs. Ben.

464
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,878
Did you open your window
again, Danny?

465
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,542
Of course.

466
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:08,719
Of course?

467
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,134
What do you mean, "of course"?

468
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,263
Don't you know
what's going on in this city?

469
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:17,887
They're my friends, mother.
They wouldn't hurt me.

470
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,864
That other boy...

471
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,480
Henry...

472
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:31,153
Those really were rats
that bit him, weren't they?

473
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,819
Weren't they, Danny?
Tell me the truth.

474
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,737
He fell in a rosebush.

475
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:44,955
You lied to us, Danny.

476
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:50,966
You lied to us.

477
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,881
I'm gonna call the police
right now.

478
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,601
Ben wouldn't hurt anybody.
He wouldn't.

479
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,975
He just got scared
and then the others got scared.

480
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,107
Ben.

481
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,316
Where did those rats
come from, Danny?

482
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:14,986
Through the window.

483
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:20,704
- Danny, please, help them.
- I am, mother.

484
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,169
Hey, what are you playing?

485
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,884
Moonlight sonata“ except I have
to play it in three flats.

486
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,601
- See?
- Yeah.

487
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:46,559
Danny, those rats
killed three people!

488
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,437
Not my rats.
They wouldn't kill anybody.

489
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,948
How did you happen to name
one of your rats Ben?

490
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:57,945
I just thought
it was a nice name.

491
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,700
Can you make them
do what you want?

492
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:04,544
That's silly.

493
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,130
Danny, I want you
to tell these men

494
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:11,094
everything you know
about those rats!

495
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,837
They're gonna kill them.
I heard it on the radio.

496
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:20,007
Starve them, it said,
and then... then poison them.

497
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,470
Just tell us
where your rats come from.

498
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,265
I guess I don't know that.

499
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,774
Danny, this is important.

500
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,407
This is kirtland.

501
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,126
I want the storm drains
in the area bounded by wiltshire

502
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,334
and western and fourth
and north checked out again.

503
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,706
Yeah, tonight!
Don't argue with me!

504
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,382
I don't give a damn
how many times you've done it!

505
01:08:57,425 --> 01:08:59,425
Have you ever seen
any other rats around here?

506
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,473
No. These are the only rats
I've ever met.

507
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,825
What about the ones that bit
the kid down the street?

508
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,269
He says you saw them bite him!

509
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,901
They're just little animals
this big.

510
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,106
How could they
possibly hurt anybody?

511
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,443
Now, look,
I've had enough of this.

512
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:18,454
No. Stop it!

513
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:23,987
All right, Danny.

514
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,999
Alright, now you stay here.

515
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:34,209
I'm gonna get your medicine.
Just in case you really need it.

516
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:15,669
Beginning to feel like a yo-yo.

517
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:17,757
This is the sixth time
I've been down this drain.

518
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,560
Well, it's the first time
you've been in it

519
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:20,762
in the middle of the night.

520
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:25,550
Yeah, come on. Overtime,
overtime, overtime, overtime.

521
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:40,342
I found them!
Hey, ed, I found the rats!

522
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,808
Somebody saw a rat!

523
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:55,193
Help me! Help! Help!
Help! Help me!

524
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,983
Please help me! God!
Someone please help me!

525
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,277
Help me! Help me! Oh, my god!

526
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,187
Okay, I'm gonna...
Please help me! Help me!

527
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:08,277
Ed! Oh, oh, my...

528
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,242
Ed!

529
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:26,431
No! No! No, no!

530
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:29,217
No!

531
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:49,944
Somebody, help me!
Somebody, help me! Somebody!

532
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,188
They came in a flood.
There were...

533
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,947
Thousands of them,
from there and there.

534
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,490
Me and my buddy
went down there tonight.

535
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,249
I left him and I ran, I...

536
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,746
- I ran and I ran.
- Don't sweat it.

537
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:44,804
What good is a dead hero?

538
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,775
You know what, kirtland,
i want to show you something.

539
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,930
Right here,
this is an old system

540
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,554
that's been cutoff for 20 years.

541
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:56,601
There's a seal here
another one six blocks away.

542
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:58,487
Another one eight blocks
in this direction.

543
01:13:58,643 --> 01:13:59,643
And one here,

544
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,909
with the old distribution tank
here in the middle.

545
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:03,858
Tell Murphy to get
the Jack hammer crews, please.

546
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,690
- Right.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

547
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,571
I'm not gonna allow
any more of my men in there.

548
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,842
Look mister, you're not giving
orders, you're taking them.

549
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,412
Aii residents,

550
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:15,779
<i>you are ordered to go in
and stay in your houses.</i>

551
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,372
Close all windows and doors.

552
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,794
<i>Keep off the streets.</i>

553
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,878
Repeat. Keep off the streets.

554
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,209
<i>Stay in your houses.</i>

555
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,296
<i>All residents,</i>

556
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,933
<i>you are ordered to go in
and stay in your houses</i>

557
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,768
<i>for your own protection.</i>

558
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:39,082
Danny!

559
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,250
Danny! Danny!

560
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,013
Danny!

561
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:05,351
Danny!

562
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,017
Danny, no!

563
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:23,249
Danny! Danny! Danny!

564
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:48,806
Danny!

565
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,869
Ah, no!

566
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,598
All the key men are here.

567
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:35,855
All right! All Jack hammer crews
be in their assigned manholes.

568
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,240
First, we send in
the flame throwers

569
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:39,945
followed by the firemen,

570
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,994
and have a shotgunner
with each crew.

571
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:46,252
We'll try to drive the rats
in the tank area.

572
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:48,854
The tank goes
with the crew to sixth

573
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,934
and west of fifth and Van ness,
and eighth and Wilshire.

574
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,328
I'll take care of it.

575
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,625
First men, all covers off,

576
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,359
as soon as the fire department
is ready with the back-up crews.

577
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,467
<i>Jack hammers,
get those seals off</i>

578
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:02,094
as soon as you get to them.

579
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:05,314
Good luck!

580
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,112
Danny! Danny!

581
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,236
Oh, no!

582
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,130

583
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,052
Ben.

584
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:41,344
Ben! Ben, please answer me!

585
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,220

Danny, please!

587
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,021
Ben.

588
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:32,942
Ben, they're coming for you.
They're coming.

589
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,226
They're gonna burn you, Ben...

590
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,396
And then
they're gonna drown you.

591
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:44,898
Run, Ben. Run, please. Please.

592
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:51,618
All right, I'll go.
You go, too, Ben.

593
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:57,709

594

Danny, please come out!

597
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,430
Danny, come out of there!

598
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:18,940
Oh, no!

599
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,230
- Please.
- Danny!

600
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,025

Oh!

608
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,503
Can they get out of there
except through those four exits?

609
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,684
There could be a dozen other
pipes we don't know about.

610
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,342
Look behind you!
They're going this way!

611
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,175

Come on, let's get down there.

627
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:51,879
I wanna see what the hell is
going on for myself.

01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:53,878
You take over here, please.

629
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:55,918
You coming?

630
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:58,722
I get paid to write
about heroes.

631
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:00,335
I don't have to be one.

632
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,806
Go down
to first-aid counter.

633
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,963
Go on, fellas. Get the hose out.
Hurry up. Get it down.

Get a hold of the hose.
Let's get it down here.

Hurry it up!
Come on, get it on the street.

I got my end.
Come on, now. Let's go. Move!

637
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,234
Break through the lines there!

You, men! Yeah, you guys!
Come in, come on!

639
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,824
Plug up those holes.
Don't let them get through.

640
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:02,776
Come on! Get going! Joe,
get that walkie-talkie for me.

641
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:08,865
Fan those flamethrowers low!

642
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,329
Sweep them, crisscross them,
keep them back.

643
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,969
What happened to you?

644
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,678
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

645
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,230
- Just scared, mother.
- L'll call Dr. Marcus.

646
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:32,943
I don't need the doctor.

647
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,710
He's getting stronger, mother.
He saved me! He really did it!

648
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:38,192
Don't try to talk now.
Come on into the house.

649
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:44,905
Unit <i>five,</i> over.

650

- Whose on the other side, Joe?
- Unit six.

660
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,619
Unit three, over.

661
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:35,116
Start moving them
towards the distribution tank.

662
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:36,594
Now, yeah!

663
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:42,087
- Unit four, come in, unit four.
- Roger.

664
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,467
Start your move towards
the distribution tank area.

665
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:24,007
Flamethrowers, fan them,
sweep them, crisscross them.

666
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,442
<i>Start moving towards
the distribution tank area.</i>

667
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:41,273
<i>Enter the distribution
tank area.</i>

with people with guts like them.

670
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:08,946
And with skill like them.

671
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:14,028
You know, if they were
four feet tall, we would lose.

672
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:19,708
The territorial imperative.
Lebensraum.

673
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,959
Living room,
that's all they want.

674
