1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,032
Well?

3
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,290
The symbols
are definitely canaanite.

4
00:00:51,423 --> 00:00:54,175
And you can translate them?

5
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:56,294
Is it the map to...

6
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:02,052
at first glance, but I shall have
to study it. I shall need time.

7
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:05,850
That is impossible, professor huston.

8
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,358
- Who the hell is this?
- You will translate it now.

9
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:13,770
Like hell he will. Come on, professor.

10
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:18,859
Open this door!

11
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:21,745
When it is translated.

12
00:01:27,044 --> 00:01:29,083
My door!

13
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,209
Now...

14
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,882
you will translate it,

15
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:40,006
professor.

16
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,681
- Where is this place, anyway?
- That way.

17
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,775
Then why are we going this way?

18
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,487
The shortest distance between
two points is a straight line.

19
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,867
Miss huston, trust me.

20
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,533
It's a jungle out there.

21
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:17,895
- We lost our shadow.
- What does he mean, "shadow"?

22
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,524
We've been followed
for the past few hours.

23
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:24,955
- What do you mean, "followed"?
- I mean that we go somewhere

24
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:28,914
and someone sneaking around
behind us tags right along.

25
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:32,164
- But why?
- You're more likely to know that than i.

26
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:34,337
You tell me.

27
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:08,115
There it is. Tongola.

28
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:11,042
Umbopo, make camp on that rise.

29
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:14,256
I come. It is safer
to enter tongola in numbers.

30
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:17,300
We won't be there long enough
to get in trouble.

31
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:24,642
- What did umbopo mean, "safer"?
- Tongola's not noted for its hospitality.

32
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,935
Well, then maybe we should
take him with us.

33
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:31,065
- Maybe they should all come with us.
- Uh-uh.

34
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:33,861
The trouble in tongola is dogati.

35
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:37,190
For heaven's sake, sergeant,
stop that dreadful music.

36
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:40,158
I cannot. Colonel bockner's orders.

37
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:45,280
Sergeant, if you wish to continue
swallowing, stop the music.

38
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:51,202
Colonel bockner? Your nauseating
breakfast is getting cold.

39
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:55,664
Get away. Get away. Go away!

40
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:00,969
What animals. What filth.

41
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:03,505
How can you stand this place?

42
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:06,976
These filthy animals
have been most profitable for me.

43
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:11,351
Ah, ja. Because you are turkish
and unprincipled. Primitive.

44
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:14,484
Like this godforsaken country.

45
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:20,816
You don't even appreciate good music.
This was wagner, you turkish imbecile.

46
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:25,789
You realise I'm getting impatient?

47
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:28,999
Very impatient.
So is the german reich and the army.

48
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:33,789
- The german occupation of africa...
- be silent! I too am growing impatient!

49
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:38,466
Of your pompous preening,
you knackwurst-eating hypocrite.

50
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:40,089
Imbecile.

51
00:05:57,364 --> 00:05:58,942
Our welcoming committee.

52
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:02,526
- Mr stealth is still hot on our trail.
- What does he want?

53
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:05,235
Someone doesn't want you
to find your father.

54
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:07,199
There.

55
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,887
I have seen her. She has come
into the city. Quatermain is with her.

56
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:24,340
Quatermain.

57
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:29,387
Well, here we are in beautiful tongola,
so I think it's time you levelled with me.

58
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,978
Levelled with you? I don't understand.

59
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,860
You've been holding out on me
since the beginning.

60
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:40,526
We want the route to the mines, dogati.
The mines. Quatermain is no problem.

61
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:44,277
So stop quivering at the mention
of his name, you turkish coward.

62
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:49,240
I have a problem with quatermain.
He considers himself a man of principle.

63
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:53,588
And like you, he objects to my meagre
existence in this miserable town.

64
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:59,053
So what? He will be no problem
for germany. We will simply kill him.

65
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:06,092
- Prisoners?
- Slaves.

66
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:08,516
- Dogati's doing.
- Dogati?

67
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:11,315
For a hundred bucks
you can own one for life.

68
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,652
- A hundred bucks? That's terrible.
- You can always bargain.

69
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:28,161
Colonel, soon the girl will be ours. And
quatermain will be grovelling at my feet.

70
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:47,928
Miss huston, meet the mapaki.

71
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:52,686
(speaks mapaki language)

72
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:57,150
We'll talk about it later, boss. Excuse me.

73
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:07,574
Don't worry,
they were just grocery shopping.

74
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:09,783
Cannibals.

75
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:14,164
I hired you to take me to the house
of isis, not to take me on a tour.

76
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:17,832
- It's just in the next courtyard.
- Thank you.

77
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:21,336
You take, sir? Very very cheap.
Make good pet, sir.

78
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:23,677
(all shouting)

79
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:49,498
Miss huston?

80
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,913
Miss huston?

81
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,666
Jessie?

82
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:01,466
Have you seen a girl? An american girl?

83
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:03,719
- I have...
- I don't wanna buy...

84
00:09:03,848 --> 00:09:06,719
- buy for the lady.
- Get out of my way.

85
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:14,269
I'll take that rug.

86
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:30,373
Sorry. Wrong colour.

87
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,539
Let me out this minute!

88
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:41,668
What wondrous weavers we have
here in tongola. A talking rug.

89
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:54,854
(yells angrily)

90
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,658
Whoa. Whoa!

91
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,051
Jessie...

92
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:10,224
oh, no.

93
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:23,905
(shouting)

94
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:43,590
(door opens)

95
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:49,352
How do you lock this thing?

96
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:54,388
There. Now, how else may I help
such a lovely lady in distress?

97
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:56,813
- Are you kassam?
- I am kassam.

98
00:11:56,943 --> 00:12:00,988
Great. You don't know
how glad I am to see you.

99
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:05,361
- I'm looking for my father, jediah huston.
- He was to meet you here today?

100
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:08,697
- No, not today.
- Perhaps you can browse while you wait.

101
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,615
He wrote two months ago saying
he was coming to see you about a map.

102
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:16,831
Many people come to see me
about many maps.

103
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:21,460
Ah. This is a fascinating piece.
Egyptian, from the age of the pharaohs.

104
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:26,968
Some other time. You must remember
him. He's a tall, thin man, grey hair.

105
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:31,144
- It's a very special map.
- I have many very special maps.

106
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,639
There. It suits you. And these too.

107
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:39,777
Can't you people take "no" for an answer?
I don't wear bracelets.

108
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:43,984
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you trying to pull here?

109
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:47,652
Nothing. We were discussing your father
and a very special map.

110
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:53,037
- Quatermain!
- My table!

111
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:56,288
In town an hour and already
you're keeping bad company.

112
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:59,956
Please. I was merely showing her
some egyptian slave bracelets.

113
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:02,843
She's seen enough.
Get her out of that thing.

114
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,136
If you like these, I'm sure
I can make you a very good price.

115
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:09,883
Tell you what. I'll give them to you
at half cost. Half price.

116
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,645
Where's my father,
you cheap-suited camel jockey?

117
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:18,395
I am deeply offended.
I said before, I know nothing.

118
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:21,481
Before, you didn't have
a gun pointed at your nose.

119
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:24,781
Yes, it's coming back to me.

120
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:28,029
Huston, you say? Huston...

121
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:31,410
thin, tall man.

122
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,249
Grey hair.

123
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:37,041
Yes, he was here.
He examined the map and then left.

124
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:40,623
- What map?
- Will you stop stalling?

125
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:43,463
- I am too embarrassed to say.
- Give it a try.

126
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:46,549
To king solomon's mines.

127
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,923
- What?
- You see? Quatermain knows.

128
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,976
There are hundreds of fake maps.
Hundreds of them.

129
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:55,722
Unscrupulous merchants
palm them off on unsuspecting tourists.

130
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:59,440
Any merchant will sell you a map.
All faked.

131
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,108
Maps? Maps? Forget about the maps!

132
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,115
Tell me where my father is.
Make him tell me where my father is!

133
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:09,320
Please don't touch it. It's priceless.

134
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:15,078
Priceless and not for sale?
That's just not you, kassam.

135
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:21,049
Formaldehyde.
The egyptians used natron. This is new.

136
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:25,718
- 4,000 years old and you call it new?
- More like four days. It's still wet.

137
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,804
You don't think...?

138
00:14:57,254 --> 00:14:58,914
- Rupert!
- "Rupert"?

139
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:02,998
- "Rupert"? I've been swindled.
- You killed my father's assistant!

140
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,551
Where is her father,
you towel-headed creep?

141
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:08,554
I do not know, I swear.

142
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:11,387
Talk, kassam,
or I'll slice you into croc food.

143
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,888
I bought an authentic mummy.
I've been swindled, believe me.

144
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:18,142
If you don't start talkin',
I'm gonna start slicing.

145
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:20,814
Please, please. No, no.

146
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,143
No.

147
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,191
I have a sick child. Practically blind.

148
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:44,843
My statue! Oh, my god!

149
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:49,306
Kassam, I'm gonna have to shoot you
before she kills me.

150
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:51,758
That's bad luck for me.

151
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:53,851
(mutters)

152
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:59,641
These symbols... they're canaanite.

153
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:01,402
Oh, my god.

154
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,901
This is it, isn't it? This is the map.

155
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,107
Yes, yes. But you've ruined it.

156
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,994
- This is a map?
- Yes. You see?

157
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,205
The belly is the plain of nalog, leading to
the twin mountains, the breasts of sheba.

158
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:19,333
A dead rupert, the map -
this proves my father was here.

159
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:23,798
- Kill me and you'll never find huston.
- Then he is alive?

160
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,252
- Yes. Dogati and bockner have him.
- Bockner?

161
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:31,975
It disgusts me. Greedy men trying to force
professor huston to translate the map.

162
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:34,675
- Where is he?
- Your father is stubborn.

163
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:40,318
That's what's kept him alive. And that's
why they want the girl, to use as leverage.

164
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:43,065
I am personally repulsed
by such a concept.

165
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:46,566
- Where is he?
- I do not know.

166
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:48,946
Aagh.

167
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,709
(gunshots)

168
00:16:56,836 --> 00:17:01,165
No more pushing me around! Get up!
You're trapped, both of you.

169
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:07,639
- I'll take care of him.
- Jessie, no!

170
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:10,053
I'll fix him.

171
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:15,598
Thank you, miss huston.

172
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:21,855
You took care of him all right.

173
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:25,402
If we live through this, which is doubtful,

174
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:29,031
remember - guns you shoot,
knives you throw.

175
00:17:32,414 --> 00:17:34,870
Watch this, kassam.

176
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:40,960
You've got two choices - run like hell
or climb up and put it out so we can talk.

177
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,007
- You've got 20 seconds.
- Allahu akbar!

178
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,131
Come on. Let's get out of here.

179
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:06,150
(speaks turkish)

180
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:12,822
Come on.

181
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:14,450
Coward.

182
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,581
Seeing you dying is going to
give me such pleasure, quatermain.

183
00:18:18,712 --> 00:18:21,037
I've got it!

184
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:43,687
- They've still got my father.
- Getting killed won't help him. Hide her.

185
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,648
No!

186
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:52,609
- Umbopo, please let me go.
- I'll protect you.

187
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:03,371
This ends your stupidity in tongola.
A map destroyed, time wasted - a disaster.

188
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:08,466
The map is here, in huston's head,
and we have him.

189
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:14,433
Schweinehund! Your refusal to talk, your
impertinent stubbornness, is delaying us.

190
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:17,598
Tomorrow we take the train
for the german camp in barumba,

191
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:22,477
and there I will have only two words
to say to you: "talk or die."

192
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,691
That's three words.

193
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,574
You...

194
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:46,967
if by the time we reach barumba you have
not revealed the way to the mines,

195
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:51,721
I will peel off your skin,
inch by wretched inch.

196
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:55,307
Was machen sie hier überhaupt?

197
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:59,019
Sorry, pal. No sprechen sie the language.

198
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,522
"Gun" I understand.

199
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:07,736
Mind if I smoke?

200
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:22,455
I've got it!

201
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,550
Get in!
Dogati and the germans are on my tail.

202
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:39,056
- Umbopo, come on. Come on.
- Come on.

203
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,191
Come on. Come on, get in.

204
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:50,027
- What's this?
- It's a dummy.

205
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:56,071
They come in handy sometimes.

206
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,349
I'll take it.

207
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:24,025
Brace yourselves.

208
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:30,659
Faster! Faster!

209
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:48,457
- Watch out!
- Oh, my god!

210
00:21:56,728 --> 00:22:01,640
(muezzin chanting the call to prayer)

211
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:16,319
Move these people! Drive over them!

212
00:22:16,457 --> 00:22:18,082
No.

213
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:21,163
Get away. Give me this gun.

214
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:24,462
- It's suicide.
- Scheiße!

215
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,006
- We can't leave father here.
- I know where they're taking him.

216
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:43,600
Morning.

217
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:54,444
Hey, come on. Get up. Time to get up.

218
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,656
God.

219
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,159
- Morning already?
- Yeah. We got a train to catch.

220
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:06,956
You know what I was dreaming about?

221
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:09,335
What?

222
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,929
Never mind.

223
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:16,013
We have to get a few things straight.
Finding your father is not gonna be easy.

224
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,220
That means...

225
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:20,014
pretty.

226
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:24,691
So that means you will do what I say
when I say and how I say.

227
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:29,861
And if you got any other little secrets
lurking around, you better tell me now.

228
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,661
- Crank it up, umbopo.
- You know everything.

229
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,906
Besides, you should understand
why I was so secretive.

230
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,286
After all, what did I know
about the great white african hunter?

231
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,167
You could have stolen my map,
slit my throat and buried me.

232
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,963
Hell, I could still do all that.
Umbopo, hop in.

233
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,425
Umbopo.

234
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,797
I guess he doesn't trust your driving.

235
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,847
He doesn't trust anything
that moves without eating grass.

236
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:08,234
Come on, umbopo. Get in.

237
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:12,492
So when you're not terrorising
darkest africa, what do you do?

238
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:17,446
I'm a student. Archaeology. You can
imagine studying archaeology in lowa.

239
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:22,410
So when my father went to london
to teach, I tagged along.

240
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,538
Quatermain...

241
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,183
I'd like to thank you.

242
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:29,338
You've... well, you've
been very kind to me.

243
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,949
Kindness had nothing
to do with it.

244
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:35,563
It's the thought of all
those ten-pound diamonds.

245
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,560
You don't even believe in the mines.

246
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:44,108
No, I think it's the thought of rescuing
a damsel in distress that appeals to you.

247
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:47,568
Miss huston, you are not in distress,
you cause distress.

248
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:48,672
(whistle)

249
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:51,367
Ah, here it comes. The train to barumba.

250
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:54,115
Umbopo!

251
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:06,544
Here she comes.

252
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,055
Do you think it's gonna stop?
I don't think it's gonna stop.

253
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:17,516
- It'll stop.
- It's not gonna stop.

254
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:19,518
(whistle blows)

255
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:28,358
Nope. It's not stopping.

256
00:25:29,323 --> 00:25:31,362
It's gonna stop.

257
00:25:32,785 --> 00:25:35,572
It's not gonna stop.

258
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:37,911
It's gotta stop.

259
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:41,158
Damn. It's not stopping. Come on.

260
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:12,902
I'm gonna look for your father. My hunch
is they've got him in the caboose.

261
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:16,450
Don't even think about it.
Umbopo will take care of you.

262
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,157
Oh, great.

263
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:42,769
Halt! Wo gehst du hin? Komm zurück.

264
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:35,948
(guard shouts in german)

265
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:51,442
(soldiers wolf-whistle)

266
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,908
Was machst du denn hier,
mein schätzchen?

267
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,831
Ich besuche meinen liebling -
herr bockner.

268
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,627
Surprise, dogati!

269
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,002
Uh... hm...

270
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:16,463
sehr gut, junge!

271
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:19,220
Very good, guys. Yeah.

272
00:29:19,352 --> 00:29:21,558
Yeah.

273
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:25,899
Great reflexes, boys.
I'm proud of you guys.

274
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:28,148
Well, hey.

275
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:29,985
May I?

276
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:32,568
Let's have some fun!

277
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:34,526
(plays camptown races)

278
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:36,865
♪ doodah, doodah

279
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,411
♪ oh, doodah day

280
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:51,837
auf wiedersehen!

281
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:11,020
I have had enough!
But obviously you have not had enough.

282
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:14,820
Have you? Eh? Have you?

283
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,784
Gib her!

284
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:21,614
Will you talk?

285
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:23,956
Will you? Will you?

286
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:26,125
Will you?

287
00:30:27,463 --> 00:30:29,705
Look what you did.

288
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:33,841
Unless you reveal the way to the mines,
I will pluck out your eye

289
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,342
and crush it underfoot like a grape.

290
00:30:36,473 --> 00:30:41,467
I will do this with various parts
of your body until you are but a stub.

291
00:30:41,603 --> 00:30:44,141
And I will not give you
the luxury of dying.

292
00:30:44,272 --> 00:30:48,021
- Make him talk.
- (train clanks and squeaks)

293
00:30:57,912 --> 00:31:00,403
- Did you find him yet?
- Shh! Keep out of sight.

294
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:07,502
- Daddy! No!
- Jessie!

295
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,331
- Jessie!
- Put me down, you ape! Put me down!

296
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:15,216
- No! Don't put me down!
- I don't believe this.

297
00:31:15,346 --> 00:31:18,133
For god's sake, get back up here!

298
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:19,844
Quatermain!

299
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:21,803
No!

300
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,923
Shack?

301
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:55,422
Bring me his head.

302
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:11,235
What a wondrous surprise. Professor,
if you do not tell me the way to the mines

303
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:17,198
I will pluck out your daughter's eyes
and crush them underfoot like a grape.

304
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:22,368
I will do this with various parts of her
body... but you know all this, don't you?

305
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:30,627
All right. All right. I'll tell.

306
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:35,669
Don't tell him, daddy.
You don't have to tell him anything.

307
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:37,963
All right. Tell him a little.

308
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:07,560
As a reward for your cooperation, I will
ask sergeant dorfman to kill you. Quickly.

309
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:10,526
Food, food, food.

310
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:14,353
I find that torture
gives me such an appetite.

311
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:17,068
(gunshot)

312
00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:21,236
Mensch, die kommen von beiden seiten!

313
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,616
This is to punish you
for not talking for so long.

314
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,827
Look what you've done again!

315
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:13,916
You know, I find you most attractive.

316
00:35:14,051 --> 00:35:18,049
- You're a swine.
- I was not talking to you!

317
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,047
I was talking to your father.
But I'm not fussy.

318
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:24,889
I'd rather bring pleasure than pain.

319
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:34,567
Come here. Come here.

320
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:41,153
Come. Come here, little one.

321
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:50,879
Come, strudel. Don't be shy.

322
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:53,841
Adolf dorfman will be good to you.

323
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,292
Very kind.

324
00:35:56,428 --> 00:36:00,722
I see in your eyes
you find me attractive too.

325
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:04,768
Quatermain!

326
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:28,450
- Umbopo! Glad you made it.
- Yes.

327
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,875
Hold this.

328
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:39,427
I've got it!

329
00:36:46,312 --> 00:36:50,441
Come on. We gotta get out of here,
they may come back for us.

330
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:53,410
I feel so ashamed. I
told them everything.

331
00:36:53,437 --> 00:36:55,883
You've nothing to be ashamed of.

332
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:58,445
There's a village near here.
We'll patch you up.

333
00:36:58,575 --> 00:37:02,407
- No, you must leave me here.
- No, daddy. We're not leaving you.

334
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:04,826
The important thing
is stopping those men.

335
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:08,824
Forget it. Let those primates get
themselves killed chasing a fantasy.

336
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:11,666
It is not a fantasy, mr quatermain.

337
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:18,463
My whole life has been spent
searching for king solomon's mines.

338
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:23,887
If they fall into the hands of those men,
my whole life will have been wasted.

339
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:30,273
Promise me you'll get to the mine first.
Promise me you'll stop them. Please.

340
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,816
Even now, they may have
too great a head start.

341
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:38,739
I'm gonna do it, quatermain,
whether you help me or not.

342
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:45,696
- Umbopo, get the professor to the village.
- I'll join you later.

343
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:56,380
I don't believe in the mines.
But I'm beginning to believe in you.

344
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,170
(plane approaches)

345
00:37:58,303 --> 00:38:00,343
Come on.

346
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:03,554
Wait.

347
00:38:06,312 --> 00:38:08,684
Be careful, professor.

348
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:12,520
Looks like it's landing.

349
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,615
It's landing.
There must be an airfield. Come on.

350
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:37,250
- Haben sie das flugzeug überprüft?
- Jawohl. Die maschine ist in ordnung.

351
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:48,058
- Ladies first.
- Thanks.

352
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:52,559
Keep down.

353
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:57,236
- Heute ist bestimmt wieder was los.
- Ja, ich hoffe, es rührt sich was.

354
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:02,195
- Hi, boys.
- Was machst du denn hier, schätzchen?

355
00:39:02,328 --> 00:39:04,700
Ich warte auf dich.

356
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:13,833
Great. Get in the plane, quick.
Get in the plane! Come on. Hurry.

357
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:19,090
Great. Now I'm gonna spin the propellor
and you press this red button. Got it?

358
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,091
I spin the propellor,
you press the red button.

359
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:27,800
- The red one. Push the red one.
- I'm pushing.

360
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:30,555
Push harder.

361
00:39:34,945 --> 00:39:36,487
Hey! Jessie!

362
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:39,816
- What the hell are you doing?
- I can't stop it!

363
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:53,795
- I don't know how to do this.
- The throttle!

364
00:39:53,923 --> 00:39:57,374
Let go of the throttle!

365
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:01,259
If I live I'm gonna kill her.

366
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:04,343
He, die haben mein flugzeug geklaut!

367
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:07,476
Die klauen das flugzeug!

368
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:09,430
(alarm)

369
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:18,655
- Stop it!
- Will you hurry up?!

370
00:40:38,427 --> 00:40:41,381
Hey! I'm on your side, remember?

371
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:52,853
My father always wanted a boy.

372
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:58,603
- He'd know how to drive this thing.
- Jessie!

373
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,071
For pete's sake, slow down!

374
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:24,424
It just took off.
Don't worry, I'll get the hang of it.

375
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:30,434
- Are you nuts?
- It's like driving a car! Brrm!

376
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,563
Are you absolutely nuts?

377
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:40,652
Just look after yourself! Hang on!

378
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:45,655
(jessie screams)

379
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,082
Real bullets.

380
00:41:50,376 --> 00:41:52,998
Aaaargh!

381
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,724
So, you are wanting to play chicken?

382
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:10,303
I have never yielded. Never!

383
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:12,312
Up!

384
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:15,234
Up! Up!

385
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:20,235
Ah, so, you are not a coward.

386
00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:22,821
(gasping)

387
00:42:23,368 --> 00:42:27,069
Pull back on the stick! Pull back on the...

388
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:29,744
for god's sake, open your eyes!

389
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:32,366
Very brave.

390
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:38,588
But if you have eine kleine brain in your
head, you will be pulling away now!

391
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:42,427
It's right there between your legs!
Pull on it!

392
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:47,433
Nein...

393
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:50,560
nein...

394
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:52,895
nein!

395
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:57,694
What was that?

396
00:42:57,821 --> 00:43:00,394
(groans)

397
00:43:06,288 --> 00:43:09,538
Where the devil
has that schweinehund gone?

398
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:44,825
Mind if I get in now?

399
00:43:52,252 --> 00:43:54,624
Ok, I've got it.

400
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,880
(ride of the valkyries by wagner
plays on gramophone)

401
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:19,311
(sings along)

402
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:28,361
We must cross rivers, climb mountains.
Must we listen to this too?

403
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:32,163
I told you, this is wagner,
and I admire his music.

404
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:35,294
Wagner is the greatest composer
that ever lived.

405
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:38,091
- You mean he's dead?
- Of course.

406
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:42,510
- Allah be praised.
- You are an uncultured barbarian.

407
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:44,131
Hey.

408
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,929
That must be dogati and the boys.
Let's go down and take a look.

409
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:51,428
Maybe we can stir something up.

410
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,202
Zurück! Lhr verdammten
schwarzen idioten!

411
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:12,371
With their great understanding of german,
that should bring them back.

412
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,039
Zurückkommen! Hierher zu mir!

413
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,709
What are these?

414
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,793
Drop 'em and you'll find out.

415
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:43,819
Ah.

416
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,699
They're coming back.
They're coming back. You see?

417
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:52,456
With these primitive natives,
it's not the question of language.

418
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,669
It's the aura of authority, of command.

419
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:59,710
I commanded them
to come back here to me...

420
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:03,008
and they are running away.

421
00:46:03,137 --> 00:46:06,340
That's all they can do,
these primitive cannibals!

422
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:12,263
Running away and eating people.
Eating people and running away.

423
00:46:12,396 --> 00:46:17,771
Have you ever seen the german army
run away? Well, I ask you. Have you?

424
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:20,642
(elephants trumpeting)

425
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,532
I'll show you!

426
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,711
There's a lot of smoke
coming out the back.

427
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,672
Damn.

428
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:44,220
And there's some brown goop
leaking out the side.

429
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:46,928
Double damn.

430
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:53,015
We're gonna have to put her down.

431
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:06,658
We'll jump for it. When she hits, she might
blow. It's our best chance. Come on.

432
00:47:09,372 --> 00:47:12,408
Here we go. One, two, three, follow me.

433
00:47:15,503 --> 00:47:18,587
- You all right?
- I don't know yet.

434
00:47:20,175 --> 00:47:23,176
I never should have let you fly it.

435
00:47:23,303 --> 00:47:27,003
At least we're headed
in the right direction. Look.

436
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,714
The twin mountain peaks.

437
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:36,724
The breasts of sheba. If you'd crashed
between them, we'd be at the mines.

438
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:40,441
Ok, ok. Next time we steal a plane,
I'll let you crash it.

439
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:42,610
(explosion)

440
00:47:55,044 --> 00:47:57,202
- Trouble?
- Nah.

441
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:03,173
(yells)

442
00:48:08,266 --> 00:48:10,424
That's trouble.

443
00:48:25,075 --> 00:48:28,740
- What are they saying?
- You don't want to know.

444
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:52,350
- Isn't that the guy from...
- yeah. Nice to be among friends.

445
00:49:01,362 --> 00:49:04,648
A time for discretion, not valour.

446
00:49:05,617 --> 00:49:06,992
Stop!

447
00:49:09,204 --> 00:49:13,830
I think I'm gonna run out of bullets
before they run out of spears.

448
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:24,338
Did you see his necklace?

449
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:27,636
Yeah. A little pretentious for my taste.

450
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,469
(yells in mapaki language)

451
00:49:36,148 --> 00:49:39,731
- They're friendly. How nice.
- Sure could have fooled me.

452
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,110
And that necklace - 21st dynasty.

453
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:45,860
- So?
- When solomon was king of israel.

454
00:49:56,336 --> 00:49:58,909
- So?
- So, don't you see?

455
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:03,127
It's just more proof
that the mines aren't a legend.

456
00:50:03,259 --> 00:50:05,501
That's a comfort.

457
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,098
What's wrong?

458
00:50:10,225 --> 00:50:13,511
Jessie, they're having us for dinner.

459
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:17,889
Well, couldn't we just beg out?
I mean, without offending them?

460
00:50:18,025 --> 00:50:21,643
They're not inviting us to dinner.
They're having us for dinner.

461
00:50:21,778 --> 00:50:24,483
(gasps)

462
00:50:24,615 --> 00:50:26,572
Oh, goodness gracious.

463
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:31,443
Well, do something! You're the adventurer!

464
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,910
Sure. You take the thousand on the right.
I'll take the thousand on the left.

465
00:50:36,043 --> 00:50:37,870
(speaks mapaki language)

466
00:50:38,004 --> 00:50:40,459
Apparently they prefer white meat.

467
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,167
- Ow!
- Agh!

468
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,379
(shouts)

469
00:50:43,509 --> 00:50:46,214
- Oh, quatermain, I'm scared.
- You too, huh?

470
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:47,970
Ow!

471
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,637
Don't worry. I'm working on a plan.

472
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:53,844
- You are?
- Yeah.

473
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:59,565
(jessie) I can't believe this!
I don't wanna die!

474
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:03,311
- I don't wanna die!
- Hey, jessie.

475
00:51:03,446 --> 00:51:05,569
Hey, look on the bright side, huh?

476
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:07,822
At least we're the main course!

477
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:11,071
Oh, sure! The brave joke!

478
00:51:11,204 --> 00:51:14,205
Well, I don't need to die with dignity!

479
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,372
I wanna scream!

480
00:51:17,628 --> 00:51:20,000
(screams)

481
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,918
(cannibals echo the scream)

482
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:32,513
We're not dead yet, jessie.

483
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:35,810
I hope they choke on us. (Spits)

484
00:51:44,614 --> 00:51:47,900
Not exactly my choice for a last meal.

485
00:51:48,034 --> 00:51:50,821
- How's that plan coming?
- Uh...

486
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:53,623
still a few details to work out.

487
00:51:53,748 --> 00:51:55,788
Excuse me.

488
00:52:06,386 --> 00:52:08,593
Quatermain?

489
00:52:08,847 --> 00:52:09,890
Quatermain?

490
00:52:14,395 --> 00:52:16,352
Oh, it's... it's getting hot.

491
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,980
It's gonna get hotter. Follow me.

492
00:52:20,109 --> 00:52:21,817
Did you find a door?

493
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:24,020
Just do what I do.

494
00:52:24,155 --> 00:52:25,982
Come on.

495
00:52:38,628 --> 00:52:42,495
It's rocking. It's rocking.
Good. Come on. More.

496
00:52:57,064 --> 00:52:59,436
- When it goes... when it goes, hang on.
- Ok.

497
00:52:59,566 --> 00:53:01,725
- Hang on tight.
- Ok. Go.

498
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:19,830
- One more time.
- Ok.

499
00:54:01,463 --> 00:54:04,832
Seem... seemed like
a good idea at the time.

500
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:55,050
Are you hurt?

501
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,513
- Are you hurt?
- Oh!

502
00:54:58,647 --> 00:55:01,565
Oh, god! Everything's moving.

503
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:03,732
(moans)

504
00:55:05,696 --> 00:55:09,030
Just let me lie here for a week.

505
00:55:09,158 --> 00:55:11,566
Anything broke? Hm?

506
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:15,123
Oh, everything's spinning.

507
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:19,377
God, there's eight of you.

508
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,337
Hey, come on. We gotta get out.

509
00:55:23,465 --> 00:55:24,507
Uh-oh.

510
00:55:26,343 --> 00:55:28,584
Go on! Shoo! Go away!

511
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,211
Not a good idea.

512
00:55:31,348 --> 00:55:34,598
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Uh...

513
00:55:34,726 --> 00:55:38,345
wait him out.
He'll get bored and wander off.

514
00:56:12,432 --> 00:56:18,850
Did anyone ever tell you you look
ravishing with... onions in your hair?

515
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,605
Thank you.

516
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:26,691
- Think I should wear them all the time?
- Oh, yes. Delicious.

517
00:57:25,883 --> 00:57:28,634
Dogati! Come on.

518
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,967
Quick.

519
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:45,861
Come on.

520
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:54,954
Gut gemacht. Mach so weiter.

521
00:57:57,624 --> 00:57:59,747
Quatermain's gun.

522
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:03,292
Then he has been... eaten?

523
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:06,586
Blind optimism.

524
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:10,050
Till I see the body, he's not dead.

525
00:58:10,178 --> 00:58:14,805
- Bet you never had this much fun in lowa.
- Or exercise.

526
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,469
Can we stop for a second?

527
00:58:17,603 --> 00:58:21,814
Not till we put more jungle between us
and dogati. Can you make another hour?

528
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,147
Can you?

529
00:58:24,276 --> 00:58:27,147
Jessie, there's no time to... jessie?

530
00:58:28,113 --> 00:58:30,569
Jessie? What the...?

531
00:59:36,976 --> 00:59:40,096
- They washed my shirt.
- Yeah.

532
00:59:40,229 --> 00:59:41,937
Me too.

533
00:59:42,065 --> 00:59:47,023
You're not gonna...
put it on right away, are you? Kinda hot.

534
00:59:48,071 --> 00:59:49,898
Here.

535
00:59:55,954 --> 00:59:57,994
Thank you.

536
01:00:07,257 --> 01:00:09,297
Thank you.

537
01:00:12,137 --> 01:00:18,176
Why are they bringing me all these
things? Why are they making such a fuss?

538
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,306
Maybe they've never seen
a white woman before.

539
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,682
Maybe.

540
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:27,688
Well, at least they're friendly.

541
01:00:28,654 --> 01:00:30,564
- Obugwa.
- What?

542
01:00:30,698 --> 01:00:33,320
Obugwa! They must be obugwa.

543
01:00:33,451 --> 01:00:38,078
Another tribe that legend says
guards the way to king solomon's mines.

544
01:00:38,206 --> 01:00:43,793
Unhappy with the world the way it is,
they live upside down hoping to change it.

545
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,791
- Oh, that's sad.
- Mm.

546
01:00:46,923 --> 01:00:51,051
Must be hell to keep your change
in your pockets.

547
01:00:58,268 --> 01:01:01,055
- What is it?
- I don't know.

548
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:04,896
Looks like...

549
01:01:05,025 --> 01:01:08,062
like floating stars.

550
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:13,821
What are they bringing me now?

551
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:17,783
Maybe it's some new kind of cocktail.

552
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:39,012
What's goin' on?

553
01:01:39,144 --> 01:01:44,565
Maybe they think you're their queen
or priestess or something.

554
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:49,437
Or maybe just the most beautiful woman
they've ever seen.

555
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:51,562
Really?

556
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:16,763
Let's get outta here.

557
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,975
Good shot.
Unfortunately he was on our side.

558
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,227
Hey.

559
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:41,573
Donnerwetter.
They are dropping like ripe plums.

560
01:02:51,927 --> 01:02:54,549
Thanks for the ride, fellas!

561
01:03:02,521 --> 01:03:06,222
Isn't that exactly like that other statue?

562
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:12,528
How nice of the obugwa. They want
to show us the way to the mines.

563
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:37,554
Gagoola! Gagoola!

564
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:40,221
Gagoola!

565
01:03:40,477 --> 01:03:42,055
Gagoola!

566
01:03:42,312 --> 01:03:44,352
Gagoola!

567
01:05:15,909 --> 01:05:18,281
When they come for you,
I'll go for prune face.

568
01:05:18,412 --> 01:05:22,872
If I can get a hold of her, maybe I can
bargain our way outta here. What the...?

569
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,954
Let go. Let go!

570
01:06:00,413 --> 01:06:02,904
No! No! No!

571
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:07,534
No! Let him down!

572
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,532
Please let him down. Please.

573
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:02,261
We didn't do anything to you.

574
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:05,138
Please let him down.

575
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:30,923
Oh, please don't kill him.

576
01:07:32,884 --> 01:07:35,125
Please.

577
01:07:35,261 --> 01:07:37,301
I love him.

578
01:08:01,413 --> 01:08:03,240
Holy mackerel!

579
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:23,266
You're gonna be sorry
when he gets to you.

580
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:08,055
I am twala,
the rightful ruler of the kukuwanas.

581
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:27,636
Jessie.

582
01:10:36,364 --> 01:10:39,319
Put me down! Let go of me!

583
01:10:41,954 --> 01:10:43,863
Quatermain!

584
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:52,290
Idiot! Forget quatermain. Let's go
for the mines. Here is the highway.

585
01:10:52,423 --> 01:10:54,711
Alle hinter mir her! Los!

586
01:10:54,842 --> 01:10:59,338
When the mine is ours,
remind me to cut out this idiot's tongue.

587
01:11:03,351 --> 01:11:05,924
This is gagoola's
secret passage to the mines.

588
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:09,347
- Why did they take jessie?
- Follow me.

589
01:11:10,817 --> 01:11:14,186
Come on! Follow me! Hurry!

590
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,360
Give me that.

591
01:11:25,457 --> 01:11:27,864
You idiot. You've led us into a trap.

592
01:11:28,001 --> 01:11:31,951
You saw the markings. You don't
understand the markings, do you?

593
01:11:32,089 --> 01:11:34,330
Turkish imbecile.

594
01:11:37,177 --> 01:11:39,847
The breasts of sheba.

595
01:11:44,309 --> 01:11:46,848
After you, colonel bockner.

596
01:11:47,897 --> 01:11:50,185
Turks are afraid of fire?

597
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:55,062
Germans too.

598
01:11:55,196 --> 01:11:56,820
Back!

599
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:05,154
I can't read the markings!
We'll follow quatermain.

600
01:12:34,278 --> 01:12:36,436
No! This way.

601
01:12:36,572 --> 01:12:38,611
Around here.

602
01:12:57,844 --> 01:12:59,219
Quatermain!

603
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:02,263
I kill you with your own gun!

604
01:13:06,561 --> 01:13:07,604
No. Stay.

605
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:30,874
Looks like they're getting into trouble.

606
01:13:31,003 --> 01:13:34,087
The diamonds belong
to the german reich!

607
01:13:34,214 --> 01:13:36,966
We will not be denied!

608
01:13:37,092 --> 01:13:40,462
The german army will not stand for it.

609
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:42,838
Help me. Help...

610
01:13:43,975 --> 01:13:45,766
let's go.

611
01:13:45,893 --> 01:13:48,265
Das ist ja scheußlich.

612
01:13:48,396 --> 01:13:51,516
Stop them. Kill them! Fire!

613
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:02,619
My gramophone. Fritz! Idiot!
My gramophone. Save my gramophone.

614
01:14:04,245 --> 01:14:07,246
I'm sinking! I'm sinking!

615
01:14:07,374 --> 01:14:09,699
Stop sinking. That's an order.

616
01:14:11,253 --> 01:14:14,004
I'm happy. No more wagner.

617
01:14:14,131 --> 01:14:16,622
Follow it. Follow it.

618
01:14:16,758 --> 01:14:21,467
We're all going to get killed!
We've got to get back!

619
01:14:26,101 --> 01:14:28,059
Now, herr colonel bockner.

620
01:14:28,187 --> 01:14:31,852
Follow me, herr colonel bockner.

621
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:24,032
At last. The mines of solomon.

622
01:15:24,161 --> 01:15:28,574
And only one man stands between us
and limitless wealth.

623
01:15:32,086 --> 01:15:37,377
From now on, I am in command.
Make sure you don't forget it.

624
01:15:37,508 --> 01:15:39,382
Follow it.

625
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:41,550
Go first.

626
01:16:31,689 --> 01:16:33,931
No. Wait.

627
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:36,522
Gagoola will kill her.

628
01:17:00,969 --> 01:17:02,132
Now.

629
01:17:07,184 --> 01:17:10,849
Get her out of these things.
Come on, let's go.

630
01:17:15,443 --> 01:17:17,482
Follow me.

631
01:17:23,367 --> 01:17:26,037
Do not step on this stone.

632
01:17:26,704 --> 01:17:28,531
This one.

633
01:17:32,752 --> 01:17:34,496
Come on.

634
01:17:46,808 --> 01:17:49,679
The queens of the kukuwanas.

635
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:14,669
Sheba, first of the queens.
You are so like her.

636
01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:18,790
When I saw you, I knew I must return.

637
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:24,963
When gagoola saw you, she knew to keep
her power, you must be sacrificed.

638
01:18:48,414 --> 01:18:50,240
Quatermain!

639
01:18:50,374 --> 01:18:53,825
You will never leave here
with the diamonds!

640
01:18:53,961 --> 01:18:57,544
The german army will not stand for it!

641
01:19:03,512 --> 01:19:08,934
Just in case, go there. If you find
nothing, come back here and wait. Go.

642
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,768
Go.

643
01:19:55,358 --> 01:19:57,896
They got in. Run!

644
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,244
My god.

645
01:20:14,794 --> 01:20:19,373
You could buy lowa
with a handful of these.

646
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:27,349
Quatermain! I'm coming!

647
01:20:31,603 --> 01:20:34,557
No time to be choosy.
Grab what you can and let's get out.

648
01:20:39,528 --> 01:20:41,568
Come on!

649
01:20:55,253 --> 01:20:56,877
Hamid!

650
01:20:57,922 --> 01:20:59,749
Coward.

651
01:21:03,136 --> 01:21:04,511
Quatermain!

652
01:21:04,762 --> 01:21:07,336
Quatermain!

653
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,638
Are you dead?

654
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:13,809
Are you kaputt?

655
01:21:16,608 --> 01:21:18,648
(clicking)

656
01:21:30,748 --> 01:21:34,366
- That's enough.
- Just one more.

657
01:21:44,512 --> 01:21:45,887
Can you move it?

658
01:21:46,013 --> 01:21:49,928
The whole kukuwana tribe
couldn't budge this thing.

659
01:21:59,944 --> 01:22:01,688
Oh, no.

660
01:22:01,821 --> 01:22:04,277
They gotta be kidding.

661
01:22:06,243 --> 01:22:08,698
I'll see if I can stop it.

662
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:11,911
Get on the other chest!

663
01:22:23,135 --> 01:22:25,377
The lid. I'll get the lid.

664
01:22:31,143 --> 01:22:33,930
Help me with this thing, will ya?

665
01:22:37,483 --> 01:22:41,184
- Get it over to the chest.
- Watch your head.

666
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:45,987
Prop it up on this corner.

667
01:22:46,117 --> 01:22:48,406
- Wait. Watch my hand.
- Careful.

668
01:22:48,536 --> 01:22:50,825
Careful.

669
01:22:50,955 --> 01:22:54,241
- Pray. Pray this works.
- Oh, god, I hope so.

670
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:58,747
Ah. That ought to...

671
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,585
give us a... minute to think.

672
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,343
Damn!

673
01:23:10,142 --> 01:23:12,597
Jessie, come over here.

674
01:23:13,479 --> 01:23:18,105
- I don't think I can get through.
- Yes, you can. Hurry.

675
01:23:32,123 --> 01:23:34,578
This one better hold.

676
01:23:39,255 --> 01:23:41,925
Oh, good. It worked.

677
01:23:44,511 --> 01:23:47,298
- What's that? Oh, my god!
- Quatermain!

678
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,470
Oh, quatermain!

679
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,434
Water.

680
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:57,144
- Looks like they thought of everything.
- It's getting deeper.

681
01:23:57,274 --> 01:24:00,275
Oh, quatermain, there's no way out.

682
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:07,155
Jessie, don't panic. Don't panic.
It'll probably run out of water.

683
01:24:07,284 --> 01:24:10,285
I think I'll get out of this thing, anyway.

684
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:14,540
There's plenty of air, and I'm right here,
so don't be scared.

685
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:19,459
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.
Do I look scared to you?

686
01:24:21,924 --> 01:24:26,302
It's just a snake, sweetheart. It's only
a snake. Don't look at it. Don't look.

687
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:30,427
It's only a snake. Keep 'em closed one
minute longer. One minute longer.

688
01:24:30,558 --> 01:24:32,800
Go! Go! Go on!

689
01:24:33,853 --> 01:24:37,305
- Is it gone yet?
- It's gone. It's gone.

690
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:42,102
- All right, jessie. It's all right.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

691
01:24:42,237 --> 01:24:47,658
Oh, quatermain, if this is it,
I mean if this is the end,

692
01:24:47,784 --> 01:24:51,284
quatermain, I just want you to know that...

693
01:24:53,957 --> 01:24:56,164
I swallowed a bug.

694
01:24:56,293 --> 01:24:59,413
Hey, good. It'll keep your strength up.

695
01:24:59,546 --> 01:25:04,505
Quatermain, the only one who thinks
your stupid jokes are funny is you!

696
01:25:04,635 --> 01:25:09,712
Find the highest place.
At least we'll die young!

697
01:25:09,849 --> 01:25:11,722
Quatermain...

698
01:25:11,851 --> 01:25:14,686
I love you, quatermain!

699
01:26:01,443 --> 01:26:04,065
For me.

700
01:26:04,321 --> 01:26:06,895
For me.

701
01:26:07,033 --> 01:26:09,571
All this for me.

702
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:17,077
For me.

703
01:26:22,632 --> 01:26:24,708
And what for me?

704
01:26:27,137 --> 01:26:29,841
And what for me?

705
01:26:29,973 --> 01:26:32,096
You think you kill me?

706
01:26:33,727 --> 01:26:36,182
Old turkish invention.

707
01:26:37,272 --> 01:26:41,899
Now you are the fool.
You are the imbecile!

708
01:26:42,903 --> 01:26:47,779
Never call a turk an imbecile
unless you make sure he's dead.

709
01:26:48,283 --> 01:26:52,068
With all this, germany will
win the war and rule the world.

710
01:26:52,204 --> 01:26:56,154
- You and I will be heroes!
- But I don't want to be a hero.

711
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:58,368
Now,

712
01:26:58,878 --> 01:27:01,416
fill your hat.

713
01:27:08,721 --> 01:27:11,259
And your pockets.

714
01:27:16,104 --> 01:27:18,974
- And your mouth.
- What?

715
01:27:19,524 --> 01:27:23,023
You heard what I said. Eat the stones.

716
01:27:23,153 --> 01:27:26,237
You're mad. You're insane.

717
01:27:27,115 --> 01:27:29,155
What use are the stones inside me?

718
01:27:29,284 --> 01:27:33,946
Don't trouble yourself, my friend.
When I get you home, I will split you open.

719
01:27:35,165 --> 01:27:36,576
Now,

720
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:39,544
eat the stones.

721
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:55,852
Now swallow. Now swallow them!

722
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,644
Swallow!

723
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:08,149
More!

724
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,661
Now swallow.

725
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:25,047
Now more. More!

726
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,593
Now more, you fat pig!

727
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:41,395
(shouts)

728
01:28:50,034 --> 01:28:52,869
Move, you german pig!

729
01:29:03,006 --> 01:29:06,505
You made me swallow the stones,
but I forgive you.

730
01:29:06,634 --> 01:29:10,086
German laxatives are the best in the
world. They will work wonders.

731
01:29:10,221 --> 01:29:13,922
I shall think of you as
I sit down to, uh...

732
01:29:15,185 --> 01:29:17,806
count my blessings.

733
01:29:27,489 --> 01:29:30,989
But I will not shoot you.
I will bury you alive.

734
01:29:31,118 --> 01:29:36,742
Only this time
you better die properly, silly turk.

735
01:29:45,007 --> 01:29:47,795
Auf wiedersehen.

736
01:30:06,738 --> 01:30:08,612
Jessie.

737
01:30:49,324 --> 01:30:52,029
- We'll have to swim.
- Wait.

738
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:00,160
Come.

739
01:31:11,096 --> 01:31:13,255
Stay where you are!

740
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,842
You have diamonds. Take them out.

741
01:31:16,977 --> 01:31:19,136
After all,

742
01:31:19,271 --> 01:31:26,021
diamonds are no good
to the dead, are they?

743
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:35,828
Put them in here.

744
01:31:42,086 --> 01:31:44,791
All of them, I said.

745
01:31:54,182 --> 01:31:55,807
In here.

746
01:31:59,896 --> 01:32:02,566
Come get 'em yourself.

747
01:32:06,737 --> 01:32:09,192
Childish people.

748
01:32:15,579 --> 01:32:17,619
Step back.

749
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:36,299
The german army will not stand for it!

750
01:32:57,289 --> 01:33:00,409
No, don't! The diamonds
belong to the mountain.

751
01:33:25,693 --> 01:33:28,943
Go on, umbopo. Get her out of here!

752
01:33:43,587 --> 01:33:45,295
At last.

753
01:34:52,741 --> 01:34:56,870
Quatermain! We go together!

754
01:36:09,195 --> 01:36:15,234
Far be it from me to pry, but you might've
told me about yourself and the diamonds.

755
01:36:15,368 --> 01:36:18,073
Do not be sad
that you leave without the diamonds.

756
01:36:18,205 --> 01:36:24,824
For you are the last to see the mountain's
secrets. That memory you'll have forever.

757
01:36:24,961 --> 01:36:27,001
Goodbye, umbopo.

758
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:44,732
- You know, I'm gonna miss umbopo.
- Yeah.

759
01:36:44,857 --> 01:36:48,985
- But he made me feel guilty at the end.
- Guilty? About what?

760
01:36:49,111 --> 01:36:55,316
Well, I thought you and your father
should come out of this with something.

761
01:36:56,536 --> 01:36:58,575
Well,

762
01:36:59,747 --> 01:37:02,832
I won't feel guilty if you won't.

763
01:37:02,959 --> 01:37:07,087
I didn't want you to go through
all of this for nothing.

763
01:37:08,305 --> 01:38:08,929
