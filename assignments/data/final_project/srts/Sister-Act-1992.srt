1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,627
Who can name all the apostles?

2
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:22,671
Yes, Deloris.

3
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:25,216
John, Paul, George...

4
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:28,010
and Ringo.

5
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:32,390
Deloris Wilson,

6
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:36,019
you are the most unruly,
disobedient girl in this school.

7
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,230
Now, I want you to march
right up to that blackboard...

8
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:43,401
and write the names of all
the apostles alphabetically.

9
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,757
This is enough.
You are hopeless.

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,343
And I wash my hands of you.

11
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:08,928
Mark my words, Deloris.

12
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:11,306
If you continue
on this disruptive track,

13
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:13,391
it will lead
straight to the devil.

14
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:17,771
Have you any idea
what girls like you become?

15
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,656
Whenever I'm with him.

16
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,408
Something inside.

17
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:32,661
- Inside.
- Starts to burning.

18
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:36,165
And I'm filled with desire.

19
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:38,000
Would it be the devil in me.

20
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:40,336
Or is this the way
love's supposed to be.

21
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:42,505
- It's like a heat wave.
- Heat wave.

22
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:44,674
- Burning in my heart.
- Heat wave.

23
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:47,176
- I can't keep from crying.
- Heat wave.

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,679
- It's tearing me apart.
- Heat wave.

25
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:52,682
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:55,268
- I said, oh, yeah.
- Heat wave.

27
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:57,854
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:00,857
- I said, Oh, yeah.
- Ain't nothing but love, girl.

29
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:03,277
Don't pass up this chance.

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,279
Here's a chance
for a true romance.

31
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:06,947
Heat wave.

32
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:18,292
Nothing you can say
can tear me away

33
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:20,461
from my guy.

34
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:22,130
My guy.

35
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:25,133
Nothing you can do
'cause I'm stuck like glue.

36
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:28,845
- To my guy.
- My guy
- My guy

37
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:32,140
I'm sticking to my guy
like a stamp to a letter.

38
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:35,644
Like two birds of a feather
we stick together

39
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:37,479
I'm telling you
from the start

40
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:40,816
I can't be torn apart
from my guy.

41
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,651
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa.

42
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:44,361
No muscle-bound man.

43
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:47,990
Could take my hand
from my guy.

44
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:49,492
My guy.

45
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:52,995
No handsome face
could ever take the place.

46
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,499
- Of my guy.
- My guy
- My guy.

47
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:59,836
He may not be
a movie star.

48
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,506
But when it comes
to being happy, we are.

49
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,133
There's not a man today.

50
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:09,137
Who could take me away
from my guy.

51
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,974
- What'd you say.
- There's not a man today.

52
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:15,978
Who could take me away
from my guy.

53
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,981
- Tell me more.
- There's not a man today.

54
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:22,151
Who could take me away from.

55
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:25,363
All right. Wrap this up, okay?
Wrap it up.

56
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:27,823
I will follow him

57
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,160
follow him
wherever he may go.

58
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,830
There isn't
an ocean too deep.

59
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,832
A mountain too high
it can keep.

60
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,418
- Keep me away.
- You better, you better.

61
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,754
- I will follow him.
- follow him.

62
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:44,132
Ever since he touched
my hands I knew.

63
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:46,760
That near him
I always must be.

64
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,762
And nothing
can keep me away.

65
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,682
He is my destiny

66
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,018
I love him, I love him
I love him.

67
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,353
- And where he goes I'll. - follow.
- I'll - follow.

68
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,190
- He'll always be my.
- True love - My - True love

69
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,442
- from now until for.
- Ever - or - Ever.

70
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:03,945
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

71
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:05,446
Go.

72
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:10,827
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

73
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,037
- I'm a whole.
- Heat wave.

74
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,290
- Yeah, yeah. - Keep burning.
- Yeah, yeah - Keep burning.

75
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,751
- I'm a whole, yeah.
- Ain't nothing but love, girl.

76
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:20,128
Don't pass up this chance.

77
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:22,089
A diamond bracelet
and a pair of pants.

78
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:24,466
- Heat wave.
- Good night, ladies and gentlemen.

79
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,468
- Heat wave.
- You don't give a shit.

80
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,804
- Heat wave.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

81
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:30,139
Heat wave.

82
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:44,487
So I... I guess eating is
out of the question, huh?

83
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,657
Eat? Your next show
is in 20 minutes.

84
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,784
You still haven't told me
what she said.

85
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,497
- What who said?
- "What who said?"

86
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,791
The one with the moustache.
The one you're married to.

87
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:01,004
You are so damn hot.

88
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:03,632
And you are so full of it.
You didn't tell her, did you?

89
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,301
I knew it. I knew you
weren't gonna tell her.

90
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:06,802
I knew it.

91
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:12,141
I want us
to be together, babe.

92
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:13,643
Hmm.

93
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:17,313
I want us to be
an honest, decent couple.

94
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,690
I do.

95
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:20,817
I went to confession today.

96
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,652
You went to confession?

97
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,654
Like confession confession?

98
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:28,825
You know where you kneel in the box, you
tell the priest your deepest secrets?

99
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,827
Well, I did that today
for us, babe.

100
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,497
I told Father Antonelli
I was in love...

101
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,332
and that it was
a special love.

102
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:38,502
A love for all the ages
and that I want to be with her.

103
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,796
And what did he say?

104
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,300
He said that if I got divorced
I'd burn in hell for all eternity.

105
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:46,510
- Hand me my loafers, doll.
- You...

106
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:48,846
No, I... You-You can get
your own damn shoes.

107
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,348
So what does this...
What does this mean?

108
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:53,351
- Is this no? Does this mean no?
- No. No.

109
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:55,853
- What does it mean?
- Not no. Just not now.

110
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:59,190
Just get out, okay?
Just go.

111
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:03,778
You want me
to go against a priest?

112
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:08,241
Get excommunicated?

113
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,789
Okay.

114
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,836
I'll eat the thing you made.

115
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,797
- Is that was this is all about?
- No, that's not what it's about.

116
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,091
It's about you leaving.
Good night.

117
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,426
Good night!

118
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,473
I'll call.

119
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,821
You're quitting just because
he won't leave his wife?

120
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,907
No, not just because
he won't leave his wife.

121
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,993
I'm quitting for a lot of reasons.
It's something I have to do.

122
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,454
- What's gonna happen to the act? -What do
you mean, "What's gonna happen to the act"?

123
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,915
You're gonna get somebody else.
It's not a big loss.

124
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,293
Well, you put everything together.
You pick all the music.

125
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,086
You tell us where to stand
and everything.

126
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,047
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm a real genius.

127
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,007
I'm a real genius.
That's why we're packin' 'em in.

128
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,677
And don't you pack any more
of my make-up in that bag.

129
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,096
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

130
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:12,058
- What do you want, huh?
- And don't you ever knock?

131
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:15,729
Hey, girl, you ain't got nothing
that I haven't seen before, all right.

132
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:18,065
Yeah, well, stop tryin'
to memorize it.

133
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:20,275
- Hey, Michelle.
- Oh, please.

134
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:23,237
Hey, uh, Deloris, here.
This is from Vince.

135
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,947
- Here.
- I hope it's his dead body.

136
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,241
- With love.
- Oh, really?

137
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:29,493
- Yeah.
- Then why didn't he bring it down to me himself?

138
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:31,912
Oh, he wanted to, but he's
got a big meetin' upstairs.

139
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:34,290
- Hey, Tina.
- Hi.

140
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:36,167
Could you say good night
to these clowns, please?

141
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,836
I'm getting a headache. I don't
want them in here. Get out.

142
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,838
- Let's go.
- All right, I'm goin'.

143
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:44,592
Just take it easy.

144
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:49,639
Well, at least you got somethin'
out of all of this.

145
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:51,892
- Come on, Deloris, open this up.
- Yes.

146
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:54,645
Why should I open this? I don't
give a damn what's in that box.

147
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:56,772
- I don't care. - Oh, see what the
man brought you. - I want to see it.

148
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,148
- Why?
- Come on.
- Why?

149
00:07:58,232 --> 00:07:59,942
- Well, I want to see.
- Fine, okay.

150
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:02,403
Let's look and see
what it is then.

151
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:04,655
- Oh, look at this. - Oh.
- Look at this. - Check it out.

152
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:06,157
- It's mink.
- Yes!

153
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,534
- It's purple mink, Deloris.
- Oh.

154
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:10,494
Oh, that's beautiful!
Look.

155
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:12,497
- Oh.
- Feel.

156
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,298
Well, obviously, Mr LaRocca
feels he can win me back...

157
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:27,637
by sending me this
absolutely fabulous coat.

158
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:29,014
- Mm-hmm.
- Whoo!

159
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:32,142
- Put it on. Put it on.
- It's beautiful.

160
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:35,312
Well, see, some girls would fall
for that, but not me.

161
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:36,647
I think I'm gonna make him
wait a little while...

162
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,108
before I just
let him know that I...

163
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:41,235
What?

164
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:48,367
Connie LaRocca.

165
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:52,705
It's his wife's coat.

166
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:54,707
The man gave me
his wife's coat.

167
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:59,504
- Oh, I don't believe this.
- Put it back on.

168
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:01,840
It's yours now.
You deserve it.

169
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:05,469
No, I don't deserve it.
I haven't earned it.

170
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:08,680
You don't earn other people's
wife's fur coats.

171
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,724
Okay?

172
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:13,894
I think it's time to just go upstairs
and give it back to him,

173
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:15,896
get the hell out
of this dump.

174
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:22,111
How long you been
with me, Ernie?

175
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,782
- Um, three years, Mr LaRocca.
- Really?

176
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,409
Two as a croupier, one
as your personal limo driver.

177
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:32,747
Ernie, you know what's
important to me, what counts?

178
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:35,250
Loyalty, my man.

179
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,419
Loyalty is what
counts to me.

180
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:40,338
Well, I've been very loyal,
Mr LaRocca.

181
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,257
Gee, Ernie,
that's not what I hear.

182
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:44,426
I hear you went down to the
police station last night...

183
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,262
and talked with
Lieutenant Souther.

184
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:49,890
I hear you were there
for over three hours.

185
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,978
I-I-I-I went.

186
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,105
I went, but I didn't
tell them anything.

187
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,232
Again, not what I heard.

188
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:01,778
Goodbye, Vince.

189
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:04,822
I'm leaving
and don't try to stop me.

190
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:06,866
I'm going to L.A.
where it's nice and warm.

191
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,329
People don't need fur coats from
their boyfriend's wife's closet.

192
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:15,041
Goodbye, Vince. I'm going to Miami,
where the sun shines.

193
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:19,922
I know they're trying
to get something on me, Ernie,

194
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:22,216
but so far they've come up
with bubkas.

195
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:28,639
They called Willy and Joey in there,
but they were out in 20 minutes.

196
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:31,058
What were you doing there
for three hours, Ernie?

197
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,355
I know you don't think I have
any talent, Vince, but I do.

198
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,150
And I'm gonna leave you,
and I'm going to Chicago.

199
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,861
Tell me what you told Souther.

200
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,116
I won't be able to sleep
tonight if I don't know.

201
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,201
I've always wanted
to go to New York.

202
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:51,872
I know if I went to New York, I could get
some things together, Vince. I could.

203
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,373
I could... I could.

204
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,876
I could.

205
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:02,007
That's all I told him.
I swear it.

206
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:05,803
Thanks, Ernie.
Now I can sleep.

207
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:10,266
- Say good night, Ernie.
- No, no, no. That's all...

208
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:21,361
Babe. Deloris.

209
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:24,906
Deloris.
Is there a problem?

210
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:28,368
- With the coat?
- With the coat? No.

211
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:31,330
No, not with the coat.
The coat's fine. I...

212
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:34,041
It's... It's fine.

213
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:36,835
It's... It's fine.
Thank-Thank you.

214
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,338
Is that why you came here
tonight? To thank me?

215
00:11:39,422 --> 00:11:41,716
Yeah. Thank you.

216
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:49,223
And to say you're sorry, about
tonight and the things you said?

217
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:51,726
Forgotten.

218
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,561
Completely.
You understand me?

219
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,064
- Forgotten.
- Of-Of course.

220
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:58,066
It's... Of course.
It's forgotten.

221
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:01,570
That's my girl.
My girl in mink.

222
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,572
- Will you be home?
- Yeah. - Soon? - Yeah.

223
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:07,993
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

224
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:13,249
Hey, Vince, is she okay?

225
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:17,336
I don't know, Vince.
She seemed kind of upset.

226
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,754
- She did?
- Yeah.

227
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,925
Bring her back, now,
for a talk.

228
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,385
And if she runs,
then what?

229
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,555
Take care of it.

230
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,771
Deloris!
Come on back!

231
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,949
Deloris,
he just wants to talk!

232
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,419
- Which way?
- That way.

233
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:45,762
Hey! Hey! Taxi! Hey!

234
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:50,225
Hey! Hey! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

235
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:10,455
And then Vince looks at Ernie
and says, "Say good night."

236
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:13,708
And then Vince looks at Joey
and Joey shot him.

237
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,251
I mean, he just shot him
in the chair.

238
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:17,212
Just boom.
He blew this guy away!

239
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:19,547
Sorry I'm late.
I'm Lieutenant Souther.

240
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:22,217
- Eddie Souther.
- How do you do? I'm Deloris Van Cartier.

241
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,886
Listen, this guy was
a simple limo driver, right?

242
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,764
He was a limo driver. So maybe he made
a couple wrong turns in his life.

243
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:30,642
That's no reason to kill him.
I've never seen anybody killed before.

244
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:33,395
Except, you know, sometimes you pass on the
free-way, you see a couple of people dead.

245
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:35,397
- But it's not the same thing...
- Miss Van Cartier? - What?

246
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:37,400
You're Vince LaRocca's
girlfriend, right?

247
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,860
Well, you could,
sort of, maybe...

248
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,238
It depends on how you look at it.
I mean, the guy just tried to kill me,

249
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,240
so I don't think that
cements our relationship.

250
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:47,118
Well, you realize he's a major
underworld figure, don't you?

251
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,746
He's into drug dealing,
money laundering.

252
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:52,791
We've been investigating Mr LaRocca
for the last 18 months.

253
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:56,127
We've got videotapes.
We've got surveillance photos.

254
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:59,005
Am I... Am I in any of the...
On the videotapes?

255
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,258
- No, no, no. Criminal activity.
- Oh.

256
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:04,052
The tapes aren't enough
to convict him.

257
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,638
Apparently, there's a lot
you don't know about Vince.

258
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:10,100
I mean, the last two people that saw
him in action kind of disappeared.

259
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:12,311
What do you mean, they kind of disappeared?
What does that... What do you mean?

260
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:15,564
Well, we found a piece here
and a piece there.

261
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,234
But don't you worry.
Here, have a cup of coffee.

262
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,779
You're safe now, and we're gonna
see that you stay that way.

263
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:25,074
- That's our job.
- If you help us, we can help you.

264
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,202
If you testify against Vince
about what you saw,

265
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,287
we can put him away
for the rest of his life.

266
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:33,208
Are you crazy? You're telling me this guy is
a mad criminal, and you want me to testify?

267
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,918
Do you know what's gonna happen?
He's gonna track me down.

268
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,962
- Deloris. - He's gonna kill me.
- Can I call you Deloris?

269
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:39,214
You can call me anything you want,
as long as you keep me alive!

270
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:42,092
- We wouldn't put you at risk if
we couldn't protect you. - Right.

271
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:45,638
It'll only take a couple
of months to get a court date.

272
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,933
Just a couple of months?
Only a couple? Why not a year?

273
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:52,478
- How about a couple of decades?
- Two months we hide you out, then you testify.

274
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:54,981
No! No. No.

275
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:57,025
It's just for a little while,
then you can come back.

276
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:59,485
Really? What are you gonna do?
You gonna stick me in a bag and bury me?

277
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,362
Forget it!

278
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:03,948
If you testify,

279
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:05,992
I'm gonna put you
in the last place on Earth...

280
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:09,246
that Vince would ever
look for you.

281
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:29,684
- Nice church, huh?
- Yeah, it's very nice.

282
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:32,186
Look, what am I gonna be,
Quasimodo in the bat belfry?

283
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,523
- What is this?
- I want you to stay here for a while.

284
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,066
Where?

285
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,362
In the convent.
It's the safest place in the world.

286
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:42,364
- You think Vince is gonna look for you
in a convent? - No, no. What? What?

287
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:45,367
- In the what? - The convent.
- You must be out of your...

288
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,120
You know what? I'm gonna go back and work
this out with Vince. You're a lunatic.

289
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:50,414
I'm not gonna be in no damn
convent with these people.

290
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:52,416
These people
don't even have sex!

291
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,130
Deloris, Vince has a contract
out on you for a hundred grand.

292
00:16:58,214 --> 00:16:59,548
- Now you've seen what he can do.
- Look...

293
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:00,966
One bullet,
that's all it's gonna take.

294
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,094
No, no, look. Let me
explain something to you.

295
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:05,471
Vince knows people all over
the place. You realize that.

296
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:08,224
He knows people all over the place. That means
he's gonna be looking for me everywhere.

297
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,143
- Everywhere but this convent.
- Oh, come on!

298
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:12,103
Nobody knows you're here
but me.

299
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:15,106
We're trying to get you a quick court
date. One month, two months tops.

300
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:18,235
I promise I'm gonna spring you
as fast as I can.

301
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,154
What... What am I gonna do here?
I'm gonna go crazy here.

302
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:23,407
There is nothing but a lot
of white women dressed as nuns.

303
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,908
I'm... What am I gonna do here?

304
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:29,413
- Pray.
- Pray?

305
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:32,500
Yes, but, Monsignor,
we are a small convent.

306
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,502
Surely, there are
more appropriate places.

307
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:38,422
We can save this young woman's life and
imprison a parasite all in one gesture.

308
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:40,258
My heart goes out to her,
of course.

309
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,594
My concern would be she might
subject the convent to danger.

310
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:46,931
The Reno Police Department assures me
you'll be protected from any harm.

311
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:49,601
They've promised to make
a generous financial donation.

312
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:53,480
And, as you know, your small
convent is in danger of closing.

313
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:56,566
Well, if they can afford
to be so generous,

314
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,568
so can we.

315
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:09,079
Excuse me.

316
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:13,459
Absolutely not.
I couldn't possibly.

317
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:17,338
Well, think of it this way, Reverend Mother,
she's an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.

318
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:18,881
That is not a person
you can hide.

319
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,802
That is a conspicuous person,
designed to stick out.

320
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:26,806
You have taken a vow
of hospitality to all in need.

321
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:31,353
I lied.

322
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:38,569
Lieutenant Souther,
everything is in order.

323
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,487
No, no, no, no,
everything is not in order.

324
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:43,908
- This woman does not like me.
- Deloris, these are holy people.

325
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:45,493
- They like everybody.
- I don't give a shit what you say!

326
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,662
- This woman does not like me.
- One month. Two months tops.

327
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:48,996
No, I'm not staying here.
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

328
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,456
I'm not staying here!
I'm telling you, I'm not...

329
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,458
- Behave yourself.
- gonna stay here!

330
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:11,895
What is your name?

331
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:14,231
Deloris Van Cartier.

332
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:15,649
Is that your real name?

333
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,693
Yes.
I happen to be a singer.

334
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:21,155
- Oh-oh. Do sit down.
- Thank you.

335
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:25,701
Look, before we get started,
I-I just want to say...

336
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:27,537
that I really appreciate
what you're doing for me.

337
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,872
I know it must be a huge
inconvenience for you.

338
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:33,168
Yeah, so I-I just, you know,
wanted to say thank you up front.

339
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:40,133
I also, uh, have always...

340
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:43,929
and I've said this to people...
I've always admired you people.

341
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:47,850
Nuns, I mean.
You know, you're so...

342
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:50,185
Catholic, you know.

343
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:51,979
I mean, look, you're
married to the big J.C.

344
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:53,689
I mean, you're His
old lady, you know.

345
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,984
It's, uh... It's an
amazing thing to me.

346
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:59,195
I mean, of course, you must be saying,
"Well, it's much better...

347
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:01,906
than being hooked up
with some kind of two-timing... ".

348
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:05,576
Please, do not smoke
in here.

349
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,912
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...
You know, I get so nervous.

350
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:11,583
I get worked up. I just... I just
had... I don't know. I'm sorry.

351
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:16,254
Look, Miss Van Cartier, we have agreed
to conceal and protect you,

352
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:19,257
which we will do
to the best of our ability.

353
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:21,593
However, it is essential
that you understand...

354
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:25,139
that you are not
in a sorority or a speak-easy.

355
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:29,226
This is a convent,
a religious order,

356
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,772
and there are certain rules
you must obey.

357
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:36,275
St Katherine's is a place
to commune and to pray,

358
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,405
and I will not tolerate any disruption
whatsoever with that communion.

359
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:43,324
Do you understand?

360
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,535
- Yes.
- Good.

361
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:48,288
But do you understand
I'm the victim here?

362
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:49,956
Do you understand
I'm the good guy?

363
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,752
I mean, they just kind of
threw me in here with you nuns.

364
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,463
I mean, do you get that?
I'm the good guy.

365
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,674
I mean, I saw a guy
get his face blown off.

366
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,468
So why don't you just
give me the key to my room?

367
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,471
I'll lay low. You stay out of my face,
I'll stay out of your face.

368
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,141
And I will commune my little
black ass in that room.

369
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,352
Can you handle that?

370
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,357
- I think it's a very good idea.
- Thank you.

371
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,485
Well, it's almost lunchtime.

372
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,612
Perhaps you'd like
to freshen up.

373
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,657
And you'll certainly
want to change.

374
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,452
I just hope you don't think I'm gonna
wear what I wore in Catholic school.

375
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,954
No, siree. No ugly
green jumpers for me.

376
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,956
And those stupid
clunky shoes.

377
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,709
Oh, with this gold thing... Could
you have it dry-cleaned for me?

378
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,172
Open the cabinet to your left.
You will find suitable attire.

379
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:39,675
Oh, cool.

380
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:51,354
Oh, no. No, no, no,
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

381
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:55,275
This is fine for covering a little
bulge, but now I've got holster hips.

382
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:57,402
People wish to kill you.

383
00:21:57,485 --> 00:21:59,279
Anyone who's met you,
I imagine.

384
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:03,408
A disguise is necessary
to protect us all.

385
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:05,786
Now, while you are here,
you will conduct yourself as a nun.

386
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:08,372
Only I will know who
and what you truly are.

387
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:11,083
You will draw no attention
to yourself whatsoever.

388
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,128
But look at me! I'm a nun.
I'm a... I'm a penguin!

389
00:22:14,211 --> 00:22:18,507
As from now and until you leave,
you are Sister Mary Clarence.

390
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:27,600
Mary Clarence? Like-Like Clarence
Williams III from The Mod Squad?

391
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:30,436
Mary is in deference
to our Holy Mother.

392
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,065
The Clarence is in honour
of St Clarence of Concordia.

393
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:36,067
There are three vows
every nun must accept.

394
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:37,402
- The vow of poverty.
- Mmm.

395
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:38,820
- The vow of obedience.
- Mm-hmm.

396
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:41,782
- And the vow of chastity.
- I am out of here with that.

397
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:44,117
Oh, oh, man.

398
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:47,246
It is necessary to eat...

399
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:49,748
- Good afternoon, Sisters.
- Good afternoon.

400
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:51,584
I apologize
for my tardiness.

401
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:54,920
I would like you to welcome
a new member to our house.

402
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:57,089
Sister Mary Clarence.

403
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:05,515
Mary Clarence comes to us from
a somewhat progressive convent.

404
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:09,436
However, she's eager to embrace
a more disciplined life,

405
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,064
and I am sure will make every
effort to conform to our ways.

406
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:14,733
I'll do my best.

407
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:17,194
- Would you like to be seated?
- Thank you.

408
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:35,546
- Yes, Mary Patrick?
- Reverend Mother,

409
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,049
on behalf of all the Sisters
here at St Katherine's,

410
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:42,804
I'd like to offer a great big hi there
and hello to Sister Mary Clarence. Hi.

411
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:45,390
And as part of the welcome,
I thought that maybe...

412
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:48,018
our new sister could offer
today's blessing.

413
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:51,354
That is very thoughtful of you,
Mary Patrick, but I really...

414
00:23:51,438 --> 00:23:54,733
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can...
I can do that. Uh, sure.

415
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:57,903
Oh, fudge.
Uh, bless us, O Lord,

416
00:23:57,986 --> 00:24:02,157
for these Thy gifts which
we're about to receive.

417
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,999
And, yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of no food,

418
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,003
I will fear no hunger.

419
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,134
We want You to give us
this day our daily bread...

420
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:21,845
and to the republic
for which it stands,

421
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:24,347
and by the power
invested in me,

422
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:28,018
I pronounce us
ready to eat.

423
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,229
- Amen.
- Amen.

424
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:32,356
Be seated.

425
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:44,201
Thank you.

426
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:03,972
Gee, what are you people,
a Pritikin order?

427
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:05,390
This stuff is terrible.
It tastes like shi...

428
00:25:05,474 --> 00:25:09,395
Sisters, we shall spend
the rest of the day in silence.

429
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:13,524
- Well, why?
- Only when our lips are silent,

430
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:16,193
may our prayers
truly be answered.

431
00:25:16,277 --> 00:25:18,070
Then you don't have
to eat this food.

432
00:25:19,155 --> 00:25:21,365
Silence begins now...

433
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:23,409
and ends at sundown.

434
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:25,954
How can you eat this stuff?
It's terrible.

435
00:25:26,037 --> 00:25:28,039
Mary Clarence,

436
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:30,917
I think you might enjoy
a ritual fast.

437
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,879
A ritual f... No. No, no.
I don't think I would.

438
00:25:33,962 --> 00:25:35,881
I'll just put a little salt
in it. It will be fine.

439
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:38,258
Look, I'm gonna have... Someone
pass me the salt over there.

440
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:43,305
A fast, to remind you of those
who must endure without food.

441
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:46,266
I... No, I don't want you
to take...

442
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:49,812
I don't want you
to take my plate.

443
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:51,397
And silence.

444
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:54,546
How can you let them grill me
in there for six hours?

445
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,632
I can't control how long
they're gonna question you.

446
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,884
- Did you go to law school, Larry?
- Yes, I went to law school, Vince.

447
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,886
- Did you graduate?
- Hey, I'm a lawyer.

448
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,431
- Of course I graduated.
- Hey, Vince.

449
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:07,476
Nice talking to you.
See you in court.

450
00:27:08,603 --> 00:27:10,355
You got nothing
on me, Souther.

451
00:27:10,438 --> 00:27:12,649
And if you don't stop
harassing me, I'm gonna...

452
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,150
What? You're gonna what?

453
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,861
Nothing. Nothing, Lieutenant.

454
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:18,363
What my client is trying
to say is that...

455
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:20,031
Is that he's scared.

456
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:22,701
And you know what?
He should be.

457
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:25,370
Real scared.

458
00:27:25,454 --> 00:27:27,664
See you around, boys.

459
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:34,880
Something's going on.

460
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:37,049
He's so damn cocky.

461
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:40,219
Ah, he's bluffilng, Vince.
Don't worry about it.

462
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:45,391
- You find Deloris?
- She's gone.

463
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:47,894
We don't know where she is, and she
hasn't been back to her place all day.

464
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:50,438
He's got Deloris.

465
00:27:50,522 --> 00:27:52,607
We gotta get her back.

466
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:55,360
Fax her eight-by-ten
to every contact we got.

467
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:57,904
- I can't hear this.
- Deloris Van Cartier.

468
00:27:57,988 --> 00:28:00,532
A quarter of a mil,
dead or alive.

469
00:28:05,913 --> 00:28:08,165
This is your cell,
Mary Clarence.

470
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:10,334
- My what?
- Your cell.

471
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,336
Your room.

472
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:17,675
Oh, man.

473
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,847
No wonder you waited till now
to spring this on me.

474
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,682
It's like a nightmare.

475
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:26,351
Where's the rest
of the furniture?

476
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:28,186
Our lives are simple.

477
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:31,523
We have little need
for material possessions.

478
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:34,359
This is out
of the Stone Age.

479
00:28:34,443 --> 00:28:37,195
- Where's the phone?
- Who would you call?

480
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,283
I don't know. Satan?

481
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,786
Your cell is
more than adequate.

482
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:47,206
Fine. What do we do now?
Pray? What?

483
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:49,709
It's 9:00.
Pleasant dreams.

484
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,962
W-W-Wait. Are you telling me
we go to bed by 9:00?

485
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:57,884
If I were you, I would use this time to
think about my life and its direction.

486
00:28:57,967 --> 00:28:59,802
Or lack thereof.

487
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:02,138
There's nothing wrong with my life.
You know, before I came here,

488
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:05,308
I had a career, I had friends,
I had clothing that fit.

489
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:07,644
Before I came here,
I was okay.

490
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:09,146
Oh, really?

491
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:10,647
From what I've heard,

492
00:29:10,731 --> 00:29:13,650
your singing career
was almost non-existent...

493
00:29:13,734 --> 00:29:16,487
and your married lover
wants you dead.

494
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,907
If you're fooling anyone,
it is only yourself.

495
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:23,994
God has brought you here.

496
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:26,080
Take the hint.

497
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:18,051
Mary Clarence.

498
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:20,345
What?

499
00:30:21,972 --> 00:30:24,433
Up and at 'em.
We don't want to be late.

500
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:28,562
- What time is it?
- Well, it's almost 5:00, Sister Sleepyhead.

501
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:30,898
5:00 a.m.?
Get out of here.

502
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,900
I just went to bed
20 minutes ago.

503
00:30:32,983 --> 00:30:37,530
- Get outta here. Scram. - Come on. The
sun is shining. It's a beautiful day.

504
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:44,579
We are a small congregation
this morning.

505
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:46,247
Too many mornings.

506
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:49,584
Something has gone
terribly wrong.

507
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:52,754
Where is faith?
Where is celebration?

508
00:30:52,837 --> 00:30:54,214
Where is everyone?

509
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:58,260
Still, rather than regret
the absence of our neighbours,

510
00:30:58,343 --> 00:31:03,098
let us rejoice in the fellowship
of those present.

511
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:06,018
Our choir mistress,
Sister Mary Lazarus,

512
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:07,895
has informed me
that our choir,

513
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:09,605
while always superior,

514
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:14,235
has been toiling especially hard
on this week's selection.

515
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:15,653
Sister.

516
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:34,589
Hail, Holy Queen.

517
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:38,343
Enthroned above.

518
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:43,432
Oh, Maria.

519
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:47,520
- Hail.
- Hail, mother of mercy.

520
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:50,648
And of love.

521
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:56,154
Oh, Maria.

522
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:59,657
Triumph all ye.

523
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,202
Cherubim.

524
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:04,704
Sing with us.

525
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:07,541
Ye seraphim.

526
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:10,460
- Heaven on Earth.
- Heaven and Earth.

527
00:32:10,544 --> 00:32:14,089
Resound the hymn.

528
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,413
There was a raid on a pawnshop
in L.A. this morning.

529
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,415
The place was fencing
stolen property.

530
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,752
- They found this.
- Database hoods.

531
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,087
What a wonderful world, huh?

532
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:55,090
"Beloved daughter missing.
Reward of $250,000."

533
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:56,675
Please find
our daughter, Angel.

534
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:59,178
"We miss her so.
Dead or alive."

535
00:32:59,261 --> 00:33:01,264
Vince is getting desperate.

536
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:02,723
So where did you
stash her, Eddie?

537
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:04,350
Where did I stash who?

538
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:06,728
Wha... You're not even
gonna tell us?

539
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:09,939
I wouldn't even
tell the Pope.

540
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:23,412
I'm not gonna get this. This is
a little too complicated for me.

541
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:26,040
Don't you worry. You'll get
the hang of it. I'll help you.

542
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:28,250
Thank you.

543
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:31,587
- Are you always this cheerful?
- Am I?

544
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,881
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, I am. I know it.

545
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:37,760
I can't help it. I've always
been upbeat, optimistic, perky.

546
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:39,262
Even as a child,
my mother used to say,

547
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:41,597
"That girl is pure sunshine.

548
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:44,267
She'll either grow up to be
a nun or a stewardess."

549
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,019
Coffee?

550
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,105
Enough about me.
What about you?

551
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:51,107
Yes. What convent
did you come from?

552
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:57,447
I came from the convent...

553
00:33:57,531 --> 00:34:00,451
of the Sisters
of the Moonlight...

554
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:01,785
in Reno.

555
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:03,954
Oh, I love Reno.

556
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:06,540
- You do?
- Yes.

557
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:08,209
Well, you-you
would have loved us.

558
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:11,379
We were... We were
a pioneering kind of order.

559
00:34:11,462 --> 00:34:15,216
You know, we'd, uh, never wear any
kind of habit this tight, though.

560
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:17,093
This is really tight.

561
00:34:17,176 --> 00:34:21,639
Oh, I must say, our habits do
cut you at the neck just a bit.

562
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:24,559
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear, hear, hear.

563
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:27,145
That's enough jabber. Vanity.

564
00:34:27,229 --> 00:34:30,399
A progressive convent?
Sounds awful.

565
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:32,526
I liked my convent in Vancouver.

566
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:34,069
Out in the woods.

567
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:37,114
It wasn't all modern like some
of these newfangled convents.

568
00:34:37,197 --> 00:34:38,574
We didn't have electricity.

569
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:41,494
Cold water, bare feet.
Those were nuns.

570
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:43,287
Sounds wonderful.

571
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,581
It was hell on Earth.
I loved it.

572
00:34:45,665 --> 00:34:47,124
This place is a Hilton.

573
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,670
Sister Mary Clarence,
when did you get your call?

574
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:53,256
What call?

575
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:54,591
Oh, the call! The call!

576
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:57,427
I-I didn't know
which call you meant.

577
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,430
I was working... I was working
in Reno, and I got the call.

578
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:05,185
And you don't know how hard it is to get a
call until you've worked in Reno, you know.

579
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:08,689
We were just... We-We ministered to
a lot of different kind of people:

580
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:12,359
newly-weds, hookers, gamblers.

581
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,529
What a joy. How fulfilling to be able to
get right in there with your hands...

582
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,031
and work with the people.

583
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:19,075
And Reno... It's probably
bursting with sin.

584
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,701
It was. That's...
That's why I had to leave.

585
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,204
I mean, we had a hooker
living next door...

586
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,165
called Buckwheat Bertha
who would...

587
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,210
Sister Mary Clarence,
could I have a word with you?

588
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,379
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you.

589
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,674
Yeah. Excuse me.

590
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,053
Get on with your work.

591
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,389
- Quickly, please.
- I was just talking to 'em.

592
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,891
Precisely. Enough chatter. Chores.

593
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:01,369
Rescue me
Take me in your arms.

594
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:05,331
Rescue me
I want your tender charm.

595
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:09,169
'Cause I'm lonely
and I'm blue

596
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:14,174
I need you and your love too
Come on and rescue me.

597
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:17,761
Come on, baby
and rescue me.

598
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:21,598
Come on, baby
and rescue me.

599
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:25,436
'Cause I need you
by my side.

600
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,483
Can't you see that I love you
Rescue me.

601
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:34,111
Come on and take my heart
Take your love.

602
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:38,449
And comfort every part
'Cause I'm lonely.

603
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:40,368
And I'm blue

604
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:43,288
I need you
and your love too.

605
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:46,249
Come on and rescue me
Come on, baby.

606
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:49,127
And rescue me.

607
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:53,006
Come on, baby
and rescue me.

608
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,677
'Cause I need you by my side.

609
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,139
Can't you see that I'm lonely.

610
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:05,186
Yeah, I need to talk
to Eddie Souther.

611
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:07,438
Yeah, it's an emergency.

612
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,067
- Souther.
- Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

613
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,195
- You gotta get me outta here.
- Deloris, you can't call me here.

614
00:37:14,278 --> 00:37:16,364
Somebody's gonna catch on
to where you are.

615
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:19,534
But I'm going insane here. All these
people do is work and pray, work and pray.

616
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:22,037
- That's all they do.
- Calm down!

617
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,998
Look, I didn't want to tell you this,
but we got some problems here.

618
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:27,376
Well, what kind of problems?
What do you mean, problems?

619
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:29,044
Keeping our witnesses alive.

620
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:31,046
I mean, we hide them,
but there's a leak in the department,

621
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:32,673
and some of them
end up dead.

622
00:37:32,756 --> 00:37:35,217
- What?
- Just sit tight.

623
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,887
You don't seem to understand
what I'm saying.

624
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,723
I am in a nightmare.
This is my nightmare.

625
00:37:40,806 --> 00:37:43,142
It's a nightmare, man.
Get me outta here.

626
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,728
I mean it. Don't call me.
It's not safe.

627
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:47,355
I'll be in touch.

628
00:37:47,438 --> 00:37:50,233
Hello? Hello?

629
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:09,712
Yeah?

630
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:21,224
I-I-I brought you something.

631
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:23,226
My brother gave it to me
when I was a little girl.

632
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:25,228
I could never seem
to get up on time.

633
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:27,897
So I, um, set it for 5:00.

634
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:32,235
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

635
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:33,737
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

636
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,741
- It always made me laugh.
- Out of bed, you daisy head.

637
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:42,246
I thought, being away
from your convent,

638
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:45,040
that even someone like you
could get lonely.

639
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,752
Have a seat.

640
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:59,097
- So which one are you?
- Mary Robert.

641
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,100
You have a little trouble
getting up at 5:00 too, Mary Robert?

642
00:39:02,183 --> 00:39:04,185
Oh, not now.

643
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:06,730
I get up a half an hour early
just to make sure.

644
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:08,523
It's-It's not just
the mornings.

645
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:11,109
It's that all my life...

646
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:14,363
everybody seems to be doing
or catching on to things...

647
00:39:14,446 --> 00:39:16,782
a second faster
or better than me.

648
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:20,327
Yeah, well, everybody's
playing catch-up nowadays.

649
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:23,539
So, Mary Robert,

650
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,292
did you always want
to be a nun?

651
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,711
Mmm. I always knew that
that was my calling:

652
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:30,046
to lead a life of service.

653
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:32,048
But, you see,

654
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:35,551
I've always felt that there's
something inside me...

655
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:37,553
that I-I want to give.

656
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:41,891
Something that's only me
and nobody else.

657
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:46,897
Does that sound
like a terrible thing?

658
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,482
Like pride?

659
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,404
No. It doesn't sound like
a terrible thing at all.

660
00:39:54,488 --> 00:39:57,866
I'm so happy that you've come
to join us, Mary Clarence.

661
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:09,128
Do you know how sometimes it's as if you
have to be yourself or you'll just burst?

662
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,633
Yep, I do.

663
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:16,010
Good night.

664
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:18,596
Good night, Mary Robert.

665
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:30,776
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

666
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:32,778
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

667
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:11,235
- Hang on.
- Hey, hey, wait up.

668
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:12,987
- Hey.
- Making me run all this way...

669
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,265
Ooh, nice tattoo.

670
00:41:47,356 --> 00:41:48,941
Hey, Sister.

671
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:51,861
Hey, this jukebox got anything
on it from Sound of Music?

672
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:09,921
Hey, baby
What do I have to do.

673
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:13,592
- Want to dance, Sister?
- Why? You don't have any rhythm.

674
00:42:13,675 --> 00:42:16,428
To make you love me too.

675
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:19,598
- You got to roll with me, Henry.
- All right.

676
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:22,101
Young man, take your foot
down off that stool.

677
00:42:22,184 --> 00:42:23,811
Now, have a seat.
Have a seat.

678
00:42:23,894 --> 00:42:27,106
- Baby. - Roll with me, Henry.
- Henry, hold on.

679
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:29,609
- Sit down and shut up.
- Can I have a Coke, please?

680
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:32,278
- Coming up.
- Thank you so much.

681
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:34,447
Roll with me, Henry.

682
00:42:43,415 --> 00:42:44,666
Whoa, boy!

683
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:48,128
What are you doin' in here?

684
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:55,469
- I... - What are you doing?
- I thought you...

685
00:42:55,552 --> 00:42:57,304
What are you guys doing?

686
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:58,973
Look, you have to go.
You have to go.

687
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:00,349
- We...
- Oh, never mind. Go. Go.

688
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:02,727
Just go that way.
Just go that way.

689
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:08,566
Sister, expecting any more
of your friends?

690
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:13,238
Now, you guys want to tell me
what you're doing here?

691
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:15,407
Well, I-I thought that you might
be ministering to the winos,

692
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,409
the way that you did
in your convent in Reno,

693
00:43:17,492 --> 00:43:18,910
and I thought I could help.

694
00:43:18,994 --> 00:43:21,246
And I saw her leave, and it was
very late, and so I followed...

695
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:24,249
What are you doing here?

696
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:29,254
- I'm here to see a man about a
car. For the convent. - Really?

697
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:30,714
- Yes. - Did you get it?
- No, I didn't.

698
00:43:30,798 --> 00:43:32,049
- I'm gonna get you outta here.
- We could really use it.

699
00:43:32,132 --> 00:43:33,717
- What colour?
- Come on, come on.

700
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:36,595
Oh, a jukebox.
Oh, one song, one song.

701
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,598
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Do you have a quarter? Oh, one song, please.

702
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:41,476
Come on. He does. All right. It'll
come back to you tenfold. Thanks.

703
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:43,770
Hurry up. Hurry up.

704
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:48,942
Oh, I love this song.

705
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:51,111
Give me, give me, give me
Give me gravy tonight.

706
00:43:51,194 --> 00:43:52,779
What's the matter with you?

707
00:43:52,862 --> 00:43:54,406
One dance. I'll be
right back, please.

708
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,203
But that don't show me
that you're really mine.

709
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:03,749
Once they're dancing
when they're romancing.

710
00:44:03,832 --> 00:44:07,086
So put me something
extra on the line.

711
00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:10,256
- Gravy.
- On my mashed potatoes.

712
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:11,757
- Give me.
- Gravy.

713
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:14,093
Come on and treat me right.

714
00:44:14,176 --> 00:44:17,597
- Gravy.
- You're the greatest.

715
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,767
So give me, give me, give me
Give me gravy tonight.

716
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,602
All right.

717
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:25,105
But I want some more.

718
00:44:25,188 --> 00:44:28,441
There's something missing
and we're on the floor.

719
00:44:28,525 --> 00:44:31,945
Come on, baby
I want some gravy.

720
00:44:32,028 --> 00:44:35,449
A little kiss
is what I'm waiting for.

721
00:44:35,532 --> 00:44:38,619
- Gravy.
- On my mashed potatoes.

722
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:40,454
Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, come on, come on.

723
00:44:40,537 --> 00:44:43,290
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Good night. - Come on!

724
00:44:43,374 --> 00:44:45,793
- Go, go!
- I love this song.

725
00:44:45,876 --> 00:44:47,962
We had a lovely time.
We'll be back.

726
00:44:48,045 --> 00:44:50,464
- Yes, we will. Good night.
- Bless you.

727
00:44:50,548 --> 00:44:52,300
You leaving?

728
00:44:52,383 --> 00:44:54,594
This turns into a nuns' bar,
I'm outta here.

729
00:44:54,677 --> 00:44:55,928
Yeah.

730
00:44:57,222 --> 00:45:00,809
- Oh, good grief.
- Just come on. Come on.

731
00:45:00,892 --> 00:45:02,602
Stop giggling. Let's go.

732
00:45:03,812 --> 00:45:05,230
Quiet. Shh.

733
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:23,416
The sisters have made it clear to me that
they followed you of their own volition.

734
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:26,419
But they would never have
ventured out at all at night...

735
00:45:26,502 --> 00:45:28,588
had it not been
for your example.

736
00:45:28,671 --> 00:45:31,758
But, listen, they just don't want to be
stuck behind these walls all the time.

737
00:45:31,841 --> 00:45:34,719
These walls are the only
protection they have.

738
00:45:34,803 --> 00:45:40,016
The streets are no longer safe for them,
and they are certainly not safe for you.

739
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,563
These robes no longer protect
our sisters. The walls do.

740
00:45:44,646 --> 00:45:46,064
I'm sorry.

741
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:50,736
You really do care
about them, don't you?

742
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:53,197
Yes, I do.

743
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,325
And I care about you
and your life.

744
00:45:57,743 --> 00:46:00,621
I shall ask Monsignor O'Hara
and Lieutenant Souther...

745
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:03,875
to find a safer and more
suitable situation for you.

746
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:06,002
Oh, no. Come on.
Don't send me away. Really.

747
00:46:06,085 --> 00:46:08,004
I mean, I'm just starting
to get the hang of this.

748
00:46:08,087 --> 00:46:12,217
I mean, look, I'm not gonna endanger
anyone or anything else.

749
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,721
I swear. What about forgiveness?
Isn't that what you preach?

750
00:46:16,805 --> 00:46:18,557
There's got to be something
around here that I can do...

751
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,893
that's not gonna chip my nails
or annoy anybody.

752
00:46:21,977 --> 00:46:24,021
You're right, Mary Clarence.

753
00:46:24,104 --> 00:46:28,233
To err is human,
to forgive divine.

754
00:46:28,317 --> 00:46:30,069
You may stay.

755
00:46:31,487 --> 00:46:35,074
But I shall restrict your
activities to a single task.

756
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:38,786
What's that?

757
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,081
Singing.
You will join the choir.

758
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:45,919
Choir? No.

759
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:47,921
You will sleep
and you will sing.

760
00:46:48,004 --> 00:46:50,590
That will be your task
until you leave.

761
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,801
No. Uh, the choir?

762
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:55,929
I mean, h-h-have you
heard them?

763
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:59,099
The choir, Mary Clarence.

764
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,102
Is this the choir rehearsal?

765
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,231
It sure is.
Come on in, sing a spell.

766
00:47:07,149 --> 00:47:10,403
- Soprano or alto?
- Whatever.

767
00:47:10,486 --> 00:47:11,904
Thanks.

768
00:47:14,824 --> 00:47:16,242
- Hi, Sister.
- Hello, Sister.

769
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:17,785
- Hello, Sister.
- 214.

770
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:30,924
Crown Him with many crowns.

771
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:34,261
The Lamb upon His throne.

772
00:47:34,344 --> 00:47:38,349
- All kingdoms.
- All kingdoms of the...

773
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:40,851
Mary Clarence,
are you with us?

774
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:43,604
I don't know this one.
I... I better...

775
00:47:43,687 --> 00:47:47,608
I better sit this one out.
Excuse me.

776
00:47:47,692 --> 00:47:50,695
Reverend Mother says Mary Clarence
has a background in music.

777
00:47:50,778 --> 00:47:54,449
Really, Mary Clarence?
Were you a choir mistress?

778
00:47:54,532 --> 00:47:59,788
- Sort of freelance.
- Freelance? Really?

779
00:47:59,871 --> 00:48:03,542
Oh. You don't think I see?

780
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,877
You think
I took vows yesterday?

781
00:48:05,961 --> 00:48:07,379
I know what you're up to.

782
00:48:07,462 --> 00:48:09,715
You and Reverend Mother.

783
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:11,467
Uh, what?

784
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,052
You're a ringer.

785
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:14,720
She brought you here
to replace me.

786
00:48:14,803 --> 00:48:16,263
Out with the old.

787
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:20,559
Oh, could you help us,
Mary Clarence?

788
00:48:20,643 --> 00:48:21,894
Mary Lazarus,
you're terrific,

789
00:48:21,978 --> 00:48:23,229
but we could
really use some help.

790
00:48:23,312 --> 00:48:25,481
- Please. You've heard us.
- We're terrible.

791
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:28,693
Please, do something for us.

792
00:48:28,776 --> 00:48:33,072
- Please.
- Well, there's a word for this.

793
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:35,241
Mutiny.

794
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:38,411
So, Mary Clarence,
you think you can do better?

795
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:41,415
I believe
I'd like to see that.

796
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:44,418
Go ahead, Sister.
Make 'em sing.

797
00:49:14,324 --> 00:49:15,742
Okay.

798
00:49:16,993 --> 00:49:18,537
Okay.

799
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,582
Where are the basses?

800
00:49:21,665 --> 00:49:23,459
Oh, you should
be over here.

801
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,753
Uh, and the altos?

802
00:49:25,836 --> 00:49:27,254
Where are you?

803
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:29,423
Sister, why don't you join them?

804
00:49:29,507 --> 00:49:32,259
And sopranos, where are you?

805
00:49:32,343 --> 00:49:34,929
Oh, you've got
to come down this way.

806
00:49:37,348 --> 00:49:39,600
All right, uh...

807
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:43,772
Basses, I-I want you
to give me a D.

808
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,940
Altos, I want you to do
a third above that.

809
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,275
Give me an F sharp.

810
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,779
And sopranos,
uh, give me an A.

811
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,448
Let me have Sister Alma
play it one time...

812
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,784
so we all know
what we're gonna do,

813
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:58,454
and, and we'll go
from there.

814
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,373
Sister, will you give me
those, uh, notes, please?

815
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,131
Okay? On three.

816
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:11,300
One, two, three.

817
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,179
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

818
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,348
Very-Very nice.

819
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:20,018
Sister, what... Would you, would
you come over here, please?

820
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,896
Just slide right in here for me,
please. Right. Right here.

821
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:26,983
- Um, that's a powerful instrument you have there.
- Thank you.

822
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:29,486
But I think it's probably
a good idea...

823
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:32,156
if we bring you down
out of the rafters.

824
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:34,283
I mean, everybody wants
to be close to God.

825
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:36,827
I'm just not sure
you can do it vocally.

826
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,038
Okay, so I need you
to sing...

827
00:50:39,121 --> 00:50:41,332
an octave below
where you've been singing.

828
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:42,667
Okey-dokey.

829
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,335
And, Sister Mary Robert,

830
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:46,609
could you, could you come
stand over here, please?

831
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,799
Yeah, come on over.
I noticed that, uh,

832
00:50:49,882 --> 00:50:52,385
you're moving your mouth,
but nothing's coming out.

833
00:50:52,468 --> 00:50:55,680
So I'd like to just hear you
by yourself, if you don't mind.

834
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:57,849
Sister Alma, could you
give me an A, please?

835
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,398
Alma!

836
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:06,400
Check your battery.

837
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,320
Give me an A, please.

838
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,993
Okay, wait a... Okay.

839
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:18,913
- Um, try this.
- Mm-hmm.

840
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:20,373
Close your eyes.

841
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:23,876
Visualize yourself
in a room full of people.

842
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,921
Lots of silverware, people
dropping stuff, talking loud,

843
00:51:27,005 --> 00:51:29,048
drunks, women with,
with trays going,

844
00:51:29,132 --> 00:51:30,884
"What are you gonna have?"

845
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:34,054
Your voice has to carry
over the din.

846
00:51:34,137 --> 00:51:35,758
You have to get up over
all of that...

847
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,016
to be heard in the back
of the room, where I'm sitting,

848
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,143
listening, straining
to hear you.

849
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:41,478
- Okay?
- Okay.

850
00:51:41,562 --> 00:51:43,772
Keep that in your mind
when we do this.

851
00:51:43,856 --> 00:51:46,608
Sister.

852
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:57,912
- Sister, that's amazing.
- We call that an A with an attitude.

853
00:51:57,995 --> 00:52:00,957
That's what you need. You have to
put attitude in what you sing.

854
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,085
You have to think about what you're
singing. It's not just quacking.

855
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:06,588
This is...
This is rejoicing.

856
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:09,591
You are singing
to the Lord.

857
00:52:09,674 --> 00:52:11,426
Let's review
those notes again...

858
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:12,928
and see if we can
put it together.

859
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,930
Sister.

860
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:20,269
Basses. Altos. Sopranos.

861
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:23,314
On three.
One, two, three.

862
00:52:29,028 --> 00:52:30,947
Oh, we did it.
We actually sang a chord.

863
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:33,449
That was exciting.
That was exciting.

864
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:36,119
Yeah, you sang a chord
for two seconds.

865
00:52:36,202 --> 00:52:39,956
The next thing you have to learn how
to do is listen to each other.

866
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:42,125
That's a big key.
Big key.

867
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:45,295
You must listen to each other
if you're going to be a group.

868
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:49,466
- I knew that.
- Mary Lazarus, I...

869
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:52,469
As soon as I walked in the door,
I knew that you knew this.

870
00:52:52,552 --> 00:52:56,807
Now, you're somebody who's into
hard work and discipline, aren't you?

871
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,475
Of course. I'm a nun.

872
00:52:58,559 --> 00:52:59,977
Four Popes now.

873
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,938
Four? Wow.

874
00:53:03,022 --> 00:53:04,940
How often do they rehearse?

875
00:53:05,024 --> 00:53:06,943
Twice a week,
a couple hours.

876
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:08,611
Not enough.
I mean, listen to them.

877
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:10,613
They really need
a lot of work.

878
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:12,782
They gotta rehearse
every day.

879
00:53:12,865 --> 00:53:14,617
She's good.

880
00:53:14,701 --> 00:53:17,787
Well, do you think they
really could get better?

881
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:20,123
I don't know.
They're pretty raw.

882
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:21,666
Wet behind the ears.

883
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,794
Oh, please, let us try.

884
00:53:23,877 --> 00:53:25,837
- Please.
- Please.

885
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:27,506
This is gonna be hell.

886
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:29,508
Tell me about it.

887
00:53:30,884 --> 00:53:34,430
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la.

888
00:53:35,556 --> 00:53:38,642
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la.

889
00:53:39,894 --> 00:53:43,439
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la.

890
00:53:44,565 --> 00:53:47,652
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la.

891
00:53:47,735 --> 00:53:51,823
La, la.

892
00:53:54,242 --> 00:53:59,331
Welcome this Sunday morning,
oh, ye few, but faithful.

893
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:02,167
The choir, I'm told,
has elected a new director,

894
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,710
Sister Mary Clarence,

895
00:54:03,794 --> 00:54:07,297
who will lead them
in "Hail, Holy Queen."

896
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:24,065
Hail, Holy Queen.

897
00:54:24,148 --> 00:54:26,776
Enthroned above.

898
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:32,741
Oh, Maria.

899
00:54:32,824 --> 00:54:36,661
Hail, mother of mercy.

900
00:54:36,745 --> 00:54:39,665
And of love.

901
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:44,753
Oh, Maria.

902
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:50,676
Triumph all ye cherubim.

903
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:56,474
Sing with us ye seraphim.

904
00:54:56,557 --> 00:54:58,518
Heaven and Earth.

905
00:54:58,601 --> 00:55:03,022
Resound the hymn.

906
00:55:26,088 --> 00:55:29,675
Hail, Holy Queen
enthroned above.

907
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,678
Oh, Maria.

908
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:36,182
Hail, mother of mercy
and of love.

909
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,519
Oh, Maria.

910
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,856
Triumph all ye cherubim.

911
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:46,067
Sing with us ye seraphim.

912
00:55:46,151 --> 00:55:49,237
Heaven and Earth
resound the hymn.

913
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,249
Hey, what do you think's
going on over there?

914
00:56:00,332 --> 00:56:02,501
I don't know, man,
but it sounds good.

915
00:56:02,585 --> 00:56:05,171
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

916
00:56:05,254 --> 00:56:08,174
Our life
Our sweetness here below.

917
00:56:08,257 --> 00:56:11,678
- Oh, Maria.
- Oh, Maria.

918
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:14,514
Our hope in sorrow
and in woe.

919
00:56:14,597 --> 00:56:18,351
- Whoa, Maria.
- Oh, Maria.

920
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:20,979
Triumph all ye cherubim.

921
00:56:21,062 --> 00:56:24,191
- Cherubim.
- Sing with us ye seraphim.

922
00:56:24,274 --> 00:56:28,320
- Seraphim.
- Heaven and Earth resound the hymn.

923
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:41,459
Hallelujah.

924
00:56:54,097 --> 00:57:00,520
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

925
00:57:01,939 --> 00:57:05,317
Our life
Our sweetness here below.

926
00:57:05,401 --> 00:57:07,987
Oh, Maria.

927
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,656
Our hope in sorrow
and in woe.

928
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:14,619
- Whoa, Maria.
- Oh, Maria.

929
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:17,079
Triumph all ye cherubim.

930
00:57:17,163 --> 00:57:19,665
- Cherubim.
- Sing with us ye seraphim.

931
00:57:19,749 --> 00:57:24,212
- Sweet seraphim.
- Heaven and Earth resound the hymn.

932
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:56,579
Girl groups!
Boogie-woogie on the piano!

933
00:57:56,663 --> 00:57:58,581
What were you thinking?

934
00:57:58,665 --> 00:58:00,375
I was thinking
more like Vegas.

935
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:03,003
You know, get some butts
in the seats.

936
00:58:03,086 --> 00:58:06,173
And what next?
Popcorn? Curtain calls?

937
00:58:06,256 --> 00:58:09,634
- This is not a theatre or a casino!
- Yeah, but that's the problem.

938
00:58:09,718 --> 00:58:12,554
See, people like going to theatres,
and they like going to casinos.

939
00:58:12,638 --> 00:58:14,681
But they don't like
coming to church. Why?

940
00:58:14,765 --> 00:58:17,017
Because it's a drag.
But we could change all that.

941
00:58:17,101 --> 00:58:19,228
See, we could, we could
pack this joint.

942
00:58:19,311 --> 00:58:21,021
Through blasphemy?

943
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:23,899
You have corrupted
the entire choir!

944
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:26,694
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Oh. - Excuse me.

945
00:58:26,777 --> 00:58:28,529
How can you say that? I...

946
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:31,532
- I've worked my butt off with these women.
- Oh.

947
00:58:31,616 --> 00:58:34,452
They've given up their free time
to do this, and they're good!

948
00:58:34,536 --> 00:58:37,831
I mean, Sister, we could,
we could rock this place.

949
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:42,544
Out of the question! As of tomorrow, Mary
Lazarus resumes her leadership of the choir.

950
00:58:42,627 --> 00:58:44,254
Come in!

951
00:58:45,672 --> 00:58:48,550
Reverend Mother, I just
wanted to congratulate you.

952
00:58:48,634 --> 00:58:51,095
I haven't enjoyed mass
this much in years.

953
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:52,805
What a marvellous programme.

954
00:58:52,888 --> 00:58:55,891
Innovative. Inspiring.
You're to be commended.

955
00:58:55,975 --> 00:58:59,228
I can't wait till next Sunday
when the choir performs again.

956
00:58:59,311 --> 00:59:01,397
Did you see the people
walk right in from the street?

957
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,108
That music.
That heavenly music.

958
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:06,277
Reverend Mother,
it called to them.

959
00:59:07,236 --> 00:59:08,738
It... It did?

960
00:59:08,821 --> 00:59:10,156
I must tell the Archbishop.

961
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,992
I'll send him a personal letter
describing your efforts,

962
00:59:13,076 --> 00:59:16,162
your bold, new flight to keep
your little convent alive.

963
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:17,497
And you must also
include this.

964
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:19,332
This is something she would
never tell you herself...

965
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,835
because this is the kind
of woman she is.

966
00:59:21,918 --> 00:59:26,173
Sisters, she wants us to go out into
the neighbourhood and meet the people.

967
00:59:28,968 --> 00:59:32,012
- Oh, this woman.
- Oh, bless her.

968
00:59:32,096 --> 00:59:34,849
Oh, there are so many problems out there
that we could maybe help with.

969
00:59:34,932 --> 00:59:37,184
I mean, that's why
many of us became nuns.

970
00:59:37,268 --> 00:59:39,270
Oh, it's really marvellous,
Reverend Mother.

971
00:59:39,353 --> 00:59:42,148
- There's a lot we could do for them
besides pray, Sister. - That's right.

972
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:43,858
You're a pioneer.

973
00:59:43,942 --> 00:59:49,531
Monsignor, surely you realize
how dangerous this neighbourhood is.

974
00:59:49,614 --> 00:59:52,325
And you will face
that danger head-on.

975
00:59:53,618 --> 00:59:55,954
- As if I could stop you.
- You couldn't.

976
00:59:56,038 --> 00:59:58,290
You have my complete support
in this matter.

977
00:59:58,373 --> 01:00:02,211
Anything you can do to revitalize
this neighbourhood would be a blessing.

978
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:05,464
Don't you just love her?

979
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:07,550
Praise you, Reverend Mother.

980
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:37,539
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

981
01:00:37,623 --> 01:00:41,544
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

982
01:00:41,627 --> 01:00:45,548
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

983
01:00:45,631 --> 01:00:49,594
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

984
01:00:49,677 --> 01:00:53,306
Love has been on my mind
for some time now.

985
01:00:53,389 --> 01:00:57,227
But you've been
the missing link.

986
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:01,231
With all that's been happening
All this has made me think.

987
01:01:01,314 --> 01:01:05,652
That love is not for keeps.

988
01:01:05,736 --> 01:01:09,698
- All I want is your love.
- All I need is promises.

989
01:01:09,781 --> 01:01:11,575
Once is never enough.

990
01:01:11,658 --> 01:01:15,245
- Open up your heart and let me in.
- Look no further.

991
01:01:15,329 --> 01:01:17,706
Love has got me crying.

992
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:21,419
- Understanding my love.
- Just a touch.

993
01:01:21,502 --> 01:01:24,171
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

994
01:01:24,255 --> 01:01:29,177
- Just a touch of love, yeah. -Just a
touch of love Just a touch of love.

995
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,597
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

996
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:37,060
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

997
01:01:37,143 --> 01:01:41,022
Music will light
the fires of romance.

998
01:01:41,106 --> 01:01:44,526
That could be forever.

999
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:48,781
You better bat down a lover
Someone to discover.

1000
01:01:48,864 --> 01:01:53,619
That just a touch of love
is all I need.

1001
01:01:53,702 --> 01:01:57,248
- All I want is your love.
- Come a little closer.

1002
01:01:57,331 --> 01:02:01,294
- Once is never enough.
- Open up your heart and let me in.

1003
01:02:01,377 --> 01:02:05,089
- Love is burning us up.
- Love has got me crying.

1004
01:02:05,173 --> 01:02:08,968
- Understanding my love.
- Just a touch.

1005
01:02:09,052 --> 01:02:12,764
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

1006
01:02:12,847 --> 01:02:16,810
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

1007
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:20,689
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

1008
01:02:20,772 --> 01:02:24,068
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

1009
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:28,656
- Just a touch of love. -Just a touch
of love Just a touch of love.

1010
01:02:28,739 --> 01:02:32,660
- Just a touch of love Just a touch of love.
- Yeah.

1011
01:02:32,743 --> 01:02:35,663
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

1012
01:02:35,746 --> 01:02:40,668
- Give me your love, yeah. -Just a
touch of love Just a touch of love.

1013
01:02:56,602 --> 01:03:00,314
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

1014
01:03:00,397 --> 01:03:04,360
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

1015
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:08,322
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

1016
01:03:08,406 --> 01:03:12,368
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

1017
01:03:12,452 --> 01:03:16,247
- Just a touch of love Just a touch of love.
- eels so right.

1018
01:03:18,917 --> 01:03:22,379
Yes, the failing convent at
St Katherine's has truly come alive...

1019
01:03:22,462 --> 01:03:24,756
thanks to the efforts
of its popular choir.

1020
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:26,842
What an amazing
turnaround story.

1021
01:03:26,925 --> 01:03:30,887
This convent was once alienated
from its surrounding neighbours.

1022
01:03:30,971 --> 01:03:33,056
- Now, as you can see, its doors are open
in an effort... - Vinny, get over here.

1023
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,850
- To reach out into the community,
- What?

1024
01:03:34,933 --> 01:03:37,227
Establishing facilities
like a day care centre...

1025
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:39,396
and a food kitchen
for the homeless.

1026
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,732
- As a matter of fact, the enthusiasm...
- Vin, you've gotta see...

1027
01:03:41,816 --> 01:03:43,567
- these cute nuns. - generated at
St Katherine's has resulted...

1028
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:45,736
- I'm shootin' pool.
- In a new sense of civic pride.

1029
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,405
- Babe, we should send them money.
- Why all the changes?

1030
01:03:47,488 --> 01:03:48,740
- Well, the nuns I talked to...
- They're do-gooders.

1031
01:03:48,823 --> 01:03:51,284
Attribute this reach-out
philosophy to...

1032
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:55,580
a new addition to the convent,
Sister Mary Clarence,

1033
01:03:55,663 --> 01:03:58,583
who, unfortunately,
is a little camera shy.

1034
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:01,920
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill her myself.

1035
01:04:04,756 --> 01:04:06,717
In related news,
the Pope visits the U.S.

1036
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,719
And we'll have more on that
in just a moment.

1037
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:14,725
- Good... Good morning.
- Good morning.

1038
01:04:14,808 --> 01:04:17,728
- Thank you so much.
- Good morning, Monsignor. - Good morning.

1039
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,190
- Good... Good to see you.
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1040
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,404
Hey, hey. What...

1041
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:28,239
Are you looking for me?
What are you doing here?

1042
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:30,950
- How come I saw you on TV?
- That was not my fault.

1043
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:34,079
These people just showed up. But it's
been really good for the convent.

1044
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:36,248
You're supposed to be
hiding out. Remember?

1045
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,125
Bullets flying
through the air at you.

1046
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,752
- Ring a bell?
- Yes.

1047
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:43,380
But I can't talk about it now because
I have a show in five minutes.

1048
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,175
Listen to yourself. This is
not a career opportunity.

1049
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:49,678
You don't have to tell me that. This would
not be the place to begin a career.

1050
01:04:51,222 --> 01:04:54,016
Hey, just promise me I won't see
you on the Letterman show, okay?

1051
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,185
Okay.

1052
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:58,437
Hey, I'm worried about you.

1053
01:04:58,521 --> 01:05:00,648
I don't want to see
anything happen to you.

1054
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:04,319
Okay. You gonna
come to the show?

1055
01:05:05,445 --> 01:05:07,655
Yeah, I'd love to.

1056
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:16,873
This Sunday's hymn is inspired
by the lesson of Mary Magdalene.

1057
01:05:16,957 --> 01:05:20,669
Now, Mary Magdalene was
a young lady with a past.

1058
01:05:20,753 --> 01:05:22,379
Oh, yes.

1059
01:05:22,463 --> 01:05:24,882
And she was
no stranger to sin.

1060
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:27,635
She was no stranger
to practically anybody.

1061
01:05:28,969 --> 01:05:31,389
Many condemned her.

1062
01:05:31,472 --> 01:05:33,307
The whole neighbourhood, in fact.

1063
01:05:33,391 --> 01:05:37,562
But one man
refused to do so.

1064
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:42,233
One man said, "Hey, now,
hold on. Wait a minute."

1065
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:46,071
Listen to the girl's story.

1066
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:57,082
- Hail, girls.
- Hail, Mary. What's up?

1067
01:05:57,166 --> 01:06:02,046
Well, Jerusalem's become
a real drag. Everybody hates me.

1068
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:04,715
Uh-uh. Not that guy over there.

1069
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,218
Who? Him? They all
say he's different.

1070
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,387
They say he's really weird.

1071
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:13,558
We don't care what people say.
To us, he's always there.

1072
01:06:13,641 --> 01:06:15,059
Really?

1073
01:06:18,688 --> 01:06:24,069
Nothing you could say
could tear me away from my God.

1074
01:06:24,152 --> 01:06:26,029
My God.

1075
01:06:26,113 --> 01:06:29,241
Nothing you could do
'cause I'm stuck like glue.

1076
01:06:29,324 --> 01:06:32,828
- To my God.
- My God
- My God

1077
01:06:32,911 --> 01:06:36,540
I'm sticking to my God
like a stamp to a letter.

1078
01:06:36,624 --> 01:06:40,252
Like birds of a feather
we stick together

1079
01:06:40,336 --> 01:06:42,171
I'm telling you
from the start

1080
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:45,925
I can't be torn apart
from my God.

1081
01:06:47,927 --> 01:06:51,181
Nothing you could do
could make me untrue.

1082
01:06:51,264 --> 01:06:55,101
- To my God.
- My God.

1083
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:58,438
Nothing you could buy
could make me tell a lie.

1084
01:06:58,522 --> 01:07:02,025
- To my God.
- My God
- My God

1085
01:07:02,109 --> 01:07:05,904
I gave my God
my word of honour.

1086
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:09,408
- To be faithful.
- And I'm gonna.

1087
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:14,872
- You best be believing.
- I won't be deceiving my God.

1088
01:07:16,374 --> 01:07:20,378
As a matter of opinion
I think He's tops.

1089
01:07:20,461 --> 01:07:23,631
- My opinion is He's the cream of the crop.
- Cream of the crop.

1090
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:27,760
- As a matter of taste.
- To be exact.

1091
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:30,805
- He's my ideal.
- As a matter of fact.

1092
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:34,392
No muscle-bound man
could take my hand

1093
01:07:34,476 --> 01:07:36,561
from my God.

1094
01:07:36,645 --> 01:07:38,230
My God.

1095
01:07:38,313 --> 01:07:41,733
No handsome face
could ever take the place.

1096
01:07:41,817 --> 01:07:45,237
- Of my God.
- My God
- My God.

1097
01:07:45,321 --> 01:07:48,741
He may not be
a movie star.

1098
01:07:48,824 --> 01:07:52,662
- But when it comes to being happy.
- We are.

1099
01:07:52,745 --> 01:07:54,497
There's not a man today.

1100
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:58,042
Who could take me away
from my God.

1101
01:07:58,126 --> 01:07:59,669
Let's take it home, ladies.

1102
01:07:59,752 --> 01:08:01,671
There's not a man today.

1103
01:08:01,754 --> 01:08:05,091
Who could take me away
from my God.

1104
01:08:05,175 --> 01:08:07,093
Give them some of that
deep-shoulder action.

1105
01:08:07,177 --> 01:08:09,012
There's not a man today.

1106
01:08:09,095 --> 01:08:13,475
Who could take me away
from my God

1107
01:08:30,993 --> 01:08:32,829
I think Sister Mary Patrick
was the best.

1108
01:08:32,912 --> 01:08:34,580
- You were wonderful.
- I wasn't very good.

1109
01:08:34,664 --> 01:08:36,541
- You were fabulous.
- You were very good too. - Ladies.

1110
01:08:36,624 --> 01:08:40,712
- I think...
- Ladies, you were fantastic.

1111
01:08:40,795 --> 01:08:43,381
- Sisters, you did good.
- Fantastic. - Oh, I'm so excited.

1112
01:08:43,465 --> 01:08:45,383
I can't wait till Sunday
when we sing.

1113
01:08:45,467 --> 01:08:47,719
- I'd rather sing than do anything.
- It's better than ice cream.

1114
01:08:47,803 --> 01:08:50,722
- It's better than springtime.
- It's better than sex.

1115
01:08:50,806 --> 01:08:53,058
- Oh?
- No, no, I-I've heard, you know.

1116
01:08:53,142 --> 01:08:55,644
Sisters, you're truly
an inspiration.

1117
01:08:55,728 --> 01:08:58,898
And I've asked you here because
I bear remarkable news.

1118
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:00,483
Now try to remain calm.

1119
01:09:00,566 --> 01:09:03,694
What I'm about to say is
nothing short of a miracle.

1120
01:09:03,778 --> 01:09:05,780
Well, I didn't believe it
myself at first.

1121
01:09:05,863 --> 01:09:08,324
Monsignor, for goodness sake,
what is it?

1122
01:09:08,408 --> 01:09:12,704
Oh, I'm sorry, Sister. It's just that it's so
momentous, I'm still adjusting to the shock.

1123
01:09:12,787 --> 01:09:15,039
The Pope...
the Pope himself...

1124
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:17,459
has heard of our choir
here at St Katherine's.

1125
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:19,878
And when he visits
San Francisco next weekend,

1126
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:22,214
despite his inordinately
busy schedule,

1127
01:09:22,297 --> 01:09:25,634
he's requested a special concert
here on Sunday night.

1128
01:09:25,717 --> 01:09:27,553
No. No.

1129
01:09:27,636 --> 01:09:29,805
Oh, I'm dying. I'm dying.

1130
01:09:29,888 --> 01:09:34,894
Oh, Sisters. Oh, Sisters,
this is indeed glorious news.

1131
01:09:34,977 --> 01:09:38,064
Oh, Monsignor, we're-we're
both humbled and honoured.

1132
01:09:38,147 --> 01:09:40,775
And on such a supremely
solemn occasion,

1133
01:09:40,858 --> 01:09:44,112
I do feel a traditional
programme would be best.

1134
01:09:44,195 --> 01:09:46,531
You mean "traditional"
like the old way?

1135
01:09:46,614 --> 01:09:49,075
We're speaking of His Holiness,
Mary Clarence,

1136
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:51,244
not a neighbourhood block party.

1137
01:09:51,327 --> 01:09:54,915
The pontiff commands
the utmost respect and humility.

1138
01:09:54,998 --> 01:09:58,627
Your more secular entertainments
would be totally out of place.

1139
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:00,963
But-But, Reverend Mother,
everyone loves our new style.

1140
01:10:01,004 --> 01:10:02,840
It's brought people
back to the church.

1141
01:10:02,923 --> 01:10:06,427
And that's why he's coming. I mean, because
we're doing something new and different.

1142
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:09,305
Well, I feel this can be
settled by a simple vote.

1143
01:10:09,388 --> 01:10:12,933
- A vote?
- Of course, Mary Clarence.

1144
01:10:13,017 --> 01:10:14,435
A convent
is not a police state.

1145
01:10:14,518 --> 01:10:16,771
I'm... I'm sure the sisters
are more than capable...

1146
01:10:16,854 --> 01:10:20,108
of reaching a mature
and dignified consensus.

1147
01:10:20,191 --> 01:10:23,111
Right. Now, all those in favour
of performing a programme...

1148
01:10:23,194 --> 01:10:25,280
of time-honoured sacred music,

1149
01:10:25,363 --> 01:10:28,283
a truly spiritual repertoire,

1150
01:10:28,366 --> 01:10:29,951
raise your hands.

1151
01:10:38,544 --> 01:10:40,796
All those in favour
of allowing Mary Clarence...

1152
01:10:40,879 --> 01:10:45,134
to select a more worldly programme,
however inappropriate,

1153
01:10:45,217 --> 01:10:47,011
raise your hands.

1154
01:10:58,565 --> 01:11:00,650
The majority has spoken.

1155
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:03,403
Reverend Mother, as always,
you're a true leader...

1156
01:11:03,486 --> 01:11:05,071
gracious and understanding.

1157
01:11:05,155 --> 01:11:07,949
Oh, it's gonna be wonderful,
Reverend Mother. You'll see.

1158
01:11:08,033 --> 01:11:11,078
I'm sure the presentation
will be a great success.

1159
01:11:11,161 --> 01:11:13,080
Congratulations,
Mary Clarence.

1160
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:18,752
And congratulations
to you all.

1161
01:11:22,173 --> 01:11:24,675
His Holiness. Now,
we've got to get busy.

1162
01:11:28,513 --> 01:11:29,764
Come in.

1163
01:11:31,516 --> 01:11:35,228
- You sent for me?
- You have a phone call.

1164
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:37,063
From who?

1165
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:39,566
Lieutenant Souther.

1166
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:41,067
Oh.

1167
01:11:44,696 --> 01:11:46,573
Hello?

1168
01:11:46,657 --> 01:11:49,117
Hey, Deloris. Great news.

1169
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:52,454
I pulled some strings. The judge
agreed to move up their trial.

1170
01:11:52,538 --> 01:11:54,248
We'll be in court
in a couple days.

1171
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:57,877
Really? That soon?

1172
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,046
Forty-eight hours,
you're a free woman.

1173
01:12:01,213 --> 01:12:02,924
Oh, gee, it's great.

1174
01:12:04,175 --> 01:12:07,095
Yeah, well, that's...
That's great.

1175
01:12:07,178 --> 01:12:09,305
Hey, well, don't thank me
or anything.

1176
01:12:09,389 --> 01:12:11,099
No, Rea... No, I...
It is. No, thank you.

1177
01:12:11,182 --> 01:12:14,602
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's... Thank you.

1178
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:16,104
Yeah.

1179
01:12:16,187 --> 01:12:18,273
All right. Bye.

1180
01:12:22,194 --> 01:12:25,948
Well, seems like your prayers
have been answered.

1181
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:29,743
Uh, I'm gonna be outta here
in a week. I'm leaving.

1182
01:12:29,827 --> 01:12:31,787
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

1183
01:12:31,871 --> 01:12:34,957
- That makes two of us.
- What do you mean?

1184
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:39,629
I have submitted my resignation
to Monsignor O'Hara, privately.

1185
01:12:39,712 --> 01:12:42,966
I've asked to be relocated
as soon as possible.

1186
01:12:43,049 --> 01:12:45,760
But why?

1187
01:12:45,844 --> 01:12:48,304
I must go where
I can be of use.

1188
01:12:50,056 --> 01:12:51,641
But there's...

1189
01:12:52,893 --> 01:12:54,478
There's still so much
to be done here.

1190
01:12:54,561 --> 01:12:56,646
Look, if it's about me,
I-I-I'm gonna be gone.

1191
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:58,482
Indeed.

1192
01:12:58,565 --> 01:13:00,818
And after how long,
a few weeks?

1193
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:05,072
I have been here for years.
Well, too long, I suppose.

1194
01:13:05,155 --> 01:13:06,740
I've become somewhat obsolete.

1195
01:13:06,824 --> 01:13:09,910
But you don't have
to continue being obsolete.

1196
01:13:09,994 --> 01:13:12,914
Look, everything that's happening here
is-is-is a good thing.

1197
01:13:12,997 --> 01:13:14,874
Sister, you can still be
part of it.

1198
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,085
A part of what?

1199
01:13:17,168 --> 01:13:19,921
You know, Mary Clarence, it is
one thing to rabble rouse,

1200
01:13:20,004 --> 01:13:22,674
to sweep into town
and declare a holiday.

1201
01:13:22,757 --> 01:13:25,093
You've raised
the sisters' expectations.

1202
01:13:25,176 --> 01:13:27,596
You've... You've excited
and confused them.

1203
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:31,099
They imagine this neighbourhood to be some
sort of delightful ongoing bake sale.

1204
01:13:31,183 --> 01:13:34,686
Now, you and I know
things are not so simple.

1205
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,940
There'll be disappointments
and rude shocks.

1206
01:13:38,023 --> 01:13:39,608
And you will have vanished.

1207
01:13:39,692 --> 01:13:41,777
How fortunate.

1208
01:13:41,861 --> 01:13:45,614
Look, I just got things going.

1209
01:13:45,698 --> 01:13:49,660
You are a formidable woman.
You could keep this going.

1210
01:13:49,744 --> 01:13:51,454
Could I?

1211
01:13:51,537 --> 01:13:53,790
Even if I wanted to, no.

1212
01:13:53,873 --> 01:13:56,125
I fear I am a relic.

1213
01:13:56,209 --> 01:13:59,254
And I have misplaced
my tambourine.

1214
01:13:59,337 --> 01:14:02,340
- Good day, Mary Clarence.
- But, Sister, I...

1215
01:14:02,424 --> 01:14:04,217
Good day.

1216
01:14:07,637 --> 01:14:09,431
Good day.

1217
01:14:09,598 --> 01:14:12,392
- Don't peek. - How can I peek?
- You can look to the right.

1218
01:14:12,476 --> 01:14:14,478
- That's right, don't peek.
- Where can I look?

1219
01:14:14,561 --> 01:14:17,064
- You ready?
- You've got my eyes... - Ta-da!

1220
01:14:17,147 --> 01:14:19,066
Crazy women.
What have you done?

1221
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:20,985
- What is this?
- It's ice cream.

1222
01:14:21,068 --> 01:14:23,070
- I know that, but...
- Well, it's a great big...

1223
01:14:23,154 --> 01:14:26,073
cuddly bear hug of a thank-you
from us to you.

1224
01:14:26,157 --> 01:14:28,242
- Not thank you to me, thank you to you.
- No, you.

1225
01:14:28,326 --> 01:14:30,912
I mean...
When did you do this?

1226
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:34,249
This is a sin.
It's a wicked indulgence.

1227
01:14:34,332 --> 01:14:36,418
Didn't they have
any butter pecan?

1228
01:14:36,501 --> 01:14:39,337
- I hope Reverend Mother doesn't catch us.
- Yeah, let's keep it down.

1229
01:14:39,379 --> 01:14:40,630
Is there any syrup?

1230
01:14:40,714 --> 01:14:42,924
Mary Clarence,
this morning in prayers,

1231
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:45,427
I thanked God
for bringing you to us.

1232
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:48,097
Since you've come,
everything has just happened.

1233
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:50,432
Our choir is famous, for one.

1234
01:14:50,516 --> 01:14:52,935
We could cut a demo.

1235
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:54,436
I could learn guitar.

1236
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:59,108
Yeah, anything is possible.
God works in mysterious ways.

1237
01:14:59,191 --> 01:15:03,738
- That's true.
- You know, uh, anything could happen.

1238
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:07,575
I mean, any one of us could be transferred
out of here at any given time.

1239
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,412
Are you leaving us?

1240
01:15:12,163 --> 01:15:13,915
No. Come on, no.

1241
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:17,419
What are you talking about? No,
we're always gonna be together.

1242
01:15:19,171 --> 01:15:21,089
That's what Diana Ross said.

1243
01:15:25,177 --> 01:15:27,429
Oh, well. Listen, that was
a trio. We're a quartet.

1244
01:15:27,513 --> 01:15:29,139
- Listen. You know, it's true.
- I know that.

1245
01:15:29,223 --> 01:15:30,933
- I believe in things like that.
- Okay...

1246
01:15:31,934 --> 01:15:35,271
Just missed him.
Souther just stepped out.

1247
01:15:35,354 --> 01:15:36,939
I need his signature
on some things.

1248
01:15:37,023 --> 01:15:39,942
Uh, this stuff can't be
processed without him.

1249
01:15:40,026 --> 01:15:43,279
Just leave it here, Henry. Uh, I'll
make sure he signs it when he comes in.

1250
01:15:45,323 --> 01:15:46,992
Here.

1251
01:16:09,807 --> 01:16:11,225
We found her.

1252
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:13,853
Beautiful work.

1253
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,271
What's the address?

1254
01:16:15,355 --> 01:16:18,900
It's Church Street at 29th
in San Francisco.

1255
01:16:20,318 --> 01:16:21,569
Thought you were gone.

1256
01:16:21,653 --> 01:16:23,405
Get all the way
to the car, no keys.

1257
01:16:23,488 --> 01:16:26,741
Tate said to leave
the money vouchers with him.

1258
01:16:26,825 --> 01:16:28,910
He said you'd sign them later.

1259
01:16:37,962 --> 01:16:39,713
St Katherine's.

1260
01:16:44,677 --> 01:16:46,470
- Here's our leak, boys.
- Come on.

1261
01:16:46,554 --> 01:16:48,055
Plug him up!

1262
01:16:48,139 --> 01:16:50,683
- Get him outta here.
- Let's go, Tate.

1263
01:16:51,517 --> 01:16:53,436
The Pope. Tomorrow.

1264
01:16:53,519 --> 01:16:54,938
Oh, my gosh,
I'll be so nervous.

1265
01:16:55,021 --> 01:16:56,940
What if I forget the words?

1266
01:16:57,023 --> 01:16:59,109
You're gonna go
straight to hell.

1267
01:16:59,192 --> 01:17:00,443
- I'm kidding.
- Uh... - I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

1268
01:17:00,527 --> 01:17:02,571
Come on, Sisters.
Rehearsal in five minutes.

1269
01:17:02,654 --> 01:17:05,324
- Go to rehearsal. I'll be there in a minute.
- Come on. - Right.

1270
01:17:09,495 --> 01:17:10,746
Get in.

1271
01:17:14,959 --> 01:17:18,254
One, two, three and slide.
One, two, three and slide.

1272
01:17:18,337 --> 01:17:21,757
One, two, three and slide.
Sister, take over now.

1273
01:17:21,841 --> 01:17:25,094
One, two, three, together.
One, two, three, together.

1274
01:17:25,178 --> 01:17:29,599
One, two, three, together.
Left. Right.

1275
01:17:29,682 --> 01:17:31,434
- Oh, come in.
- Where's Deloris?

1276
01:17:31,518 --> 01:17:33,228
- Why? Is something wrong?
- They know she's here.

1277
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:36,106
- Girls... - Oh, my goodness.
She's upstairs with the choir.

1278
01:17:41,862 --> 01:17:43,280
- Deloris.
- Hi.

1279
01:17:43,363 --> 01:17:46,116
Look, Vince knows you're here.
We gotta get out now.

1280
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,118
Oh, but I can't go. We're-We're
singing for the Pope tomorrow.

1281
01:17:48,202 --> 01:17:51,622
Listen, you're gonna be singing for St Peter
if you don't get your ass outta here now.

1282
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:53,791
But I... Oh...

1283
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,631
I-I-I can't do this.
I can't leave.

1284
01:18:00,715 --> 01:18:02,675
It's-It's... It's like
I'm deserting them.

1285
01:18:02,759 --> 01:18:04,761
Hey, I think
they'll understand.

1286
01:18:04,844 --> 01:18:07,180
No, you don't understand.
They need me.

1287
01:18:07,263 --> 01:18:09,557
They need you?
A bunch of nuns?

1288
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:11,309
What for? Moral guidance?

1289
01:18:11,393 --> 01:18:13,311
What? Make-up tips?

1290
01:18:13,395 --> 01:18:16,064
Let me tell you something.
We are talking about the Pope.

1291
01:18:16,148 --> 01:18:20,652
This means a great deal to them, and they have
worked very hard for this, and they deserve it.

1292
01:18:20,736 --> 01:18:23,739
Where you going?
Where are you going?

1293
01:18:23,822 --> 01:18:26,700
I am going to the little
nun's room, nosy.

1294
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,685
There you are.
We've been looking for you.

1295
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:53,937
- Shh, shh, shh. - Re-Rehearsal's about to start.
- Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.

1296
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:56,356
- Surprise.
- Guess who?

1297
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,776
- Rehearsal's this way, Sisters.
- Hey, Deloris.

1298
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,569
- Hi. - Come on.
- All right, all right.

1299
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,707
What do they want?
Who are they?

1300
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:15,210
Reno scum. Come on, man!

1301
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:21,591
- Come on, come on! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

1302
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:34,313
Where are we going?

1303
01:19:34,396 --> 01:19:36,774
Sister here has got
a special command performance.

1304
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:38,526
Yeah, back
at the Moonlight Lounge.

1305
01:19:38,609 --> 01:19:40,194
Look, why don't you just
let her go, you know?

1306
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:41,988
She doesn't have
anything to do with this.

1307
01:19:42,071 --> 01:19:44,448
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. So she can
run right to the cops, huh?

1308
01:19:44,532 --> 01:19:47,910
Look, you just go
with the flow, okay?

1309
01:19:47,994 --> 01:19:50,413
Relax. You do what
I tell you to do.

1310
01:19:58,505 --> 01:20:02,092
- Go!
- Oh! Oh!

1311
01:20:02,175 --> 01:20:04,428
- She's gettin' away.
- You don't even have to worry about her, okay?

1312
01:20:04,511 --> 01:20:07,765
- You got the one you came for.
- She's right. Let's go.

1313
01:20:09,183 --> 01:20:11,101
You all right?
It's okay, I'm a cop.

1314
01:20:11,185 --> 01:20:12,978
They've got Sister Mary
Clarence, and they've got guns.

1315
01:20:13,062 --> 01:20:14,605
- Where are they taking her?
- Um, they said the Moonlight Lounge.

1316
01:20:14,688 --> 01:20:16,357
- Come on, get out of the street.
- Okay.

1317
01:20:30,288 --> 01:20:31,790
- You mean they kidnapped her?
- Yes.

1318
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:33,792
Two men, and they had guns.

1319
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,710
Why would anyone kidnap a nun?

1320
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:37,295
Were they Catholics?

1321
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:40,299
She isn't a nun.

1322
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:44,053
She's a lounge singer. Her real
name is Deloris Van Cartier.

1323
01:20:44,136 --> 01:20:47,806
She witnessed a vicious crime
and has been hiding in our convent.

1324
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:50,142
- She isn't a nun?
- She-She lied to us?

1325
01:20:50,226 --> 01:20:51,977
But she was such
a wonderful nun.

1326
01:20:52,061 --> 01:20:55,064
Look what she did with the choir.
She made us sing beautifully.

1327
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:58,651
- That should have tipped us. - Well, I don't
care who she is. We can't sing without her.

1328
01:20:58,735 --> 01:21:00,820
- She's our inspiration.
- Right.

1329
01:21:00,904 --> 01:21:03,782
Reverend Mother, please, I know
that you and Mary Clarence...

1330
01:21:03,865 --> 01:21:05,450
didn't always agree,
but we've got to help her.

1331
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:07,202
- Please.
- We've gotta save her.

1332
01:21:07,285 --> 01:21:10,789
- We can't leave it up to the Feds.
- No, they'll...

1333
01:21:11,873 --> 01:21:13,291
Calm down, calm down.

1334
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:14,960
Mary Robert, think clearly.

1335
01:21:15,043 --> 01:21:16,795
Have you any idea
who these two men where?

1336
01:21:16,879 --> 01:21:21,717
Yes. They were from Reno, and they're
taking her to the Moonlight Lounge.

1337
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,137
Reno? Nevada.

1338
01:21:25,221 --> 01:21:28,265
- Mary Emmanuel, tell the Monsignor the situation.
- Yes, Mother.

1339
01:21:28,349 --> 01:21:30,643
- The rest of you, follow me.
- Yes, Mother.

1340
01:21:31,978 --> 01:21:33,479
It's 1,500 for the run to Reno.

1341
01:21:33,563 --> 01:21:35,315
That's 500 less
than I normally charge.

1342
01:21:35,398 --> 01:21:37,650
But-But we don't have $ 1,500.

1343
01:21:37,734 --> 01:21:39,819
Well, then I can't fly you
there. I'm sorry.

1344
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:44,032
Look, I-I'm sorry. I-I-I've got
things I have to check out here.

1345
01:21:44,115 --> 01:21:47,494
Father, do not blame this young pilot
for abandoning us in our hour of need.

1346
01:21:47,577 --> 01:21:49,496
When he stands before You
on the day of judgement,

1347
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:51,415
do not send him
straight to hell.

1348
01:21:51,498 --> 01:21:54,710
Please, please, do not treat him with
the same disregard that he's treated us.

1349
01:21:54,752 --> 01:21:56,670
Just because he can't
show charity to nuns,

1350
01:21:56,754 --> 01:21:59,256
try not to leave him without
rewards when he asks for them.

1351
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,675
We know it is easier to answer
the prayers of a man...

1352
01:22:01,759 --> 01:22:03,260
who has answered
the prayers of others,

1353
01:22:03,344 --> 01:22:04,929
but if he should
come to You...

1354
01:22:05,012 --> 01:22:08,266
- for relief of pain or...
- Such as rheumatoid arthritis,

1355
01:22:08,349 --> 01:22:10,268
loss of hair, neck polyps.

1356
01:22:10,351 --> 01:22:12,770
Don't leave him bald
and yowling in despair.

1357
01:22:12,854 --> 01:22:15,190
Watch over him as he refuses
to watch over us.

1358
01:22:15,273 --> 01:22:17,609
And if You cannot, we know that
You will have done Your level best.

1359
01:22:17,692 --> 01:22:20,779
- What goes around, comes around.
- Look, Sisters, Sisters...

1360
01:22:22,364 --> 01:22:24,074
Hold on a second.

1361
01:22:42,718 --> 01:22:45,346
What did you think you were doing,
running to the cops, Deloris?

1362
01:22:45,388 --> 01:22:48,516
Hiding out?
Big no-no, babe.

1363
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,518
Bet you're sorry now.

1364
01:22:50,602 --> 01:22:53,438
I'm sorry
for all my sins, Vince,

1365
01:22:53,521 --> 01:22:55,065
and I'm sorry for yours.

1366
01:22:55,148 --> 01:22:57,651
I loved you, Deloris.

1367
01:22:57,734 --> 01:22:59,820
I gave you everything:

1368
01:22:59,903 --> 01:23:03,115
my affection, my time,
a big-time career.

1369
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:06,160
And how do you repay me?
What's the thanks I get?

1370
01:23:06,243 --> 01:23:08,662
Where's the loyalty?

1371
01:23:08,746 --> 01:23:10,956
You shouldn't have
done that to me, babe.

1372
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,918
You'll be judged.
We all will.

1373
01:23:15,211 --> 01:23:17,255
I don't get judged.

1374
01:23:17,338 --> 01:23:20,466
Vince, she's been acting weird
since we picked her up.

1375
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:23,469
It's like, uh,
she's scared of nothin'.

1376
01:23:23,553 --> 01:23:25,013
She's scared.

1377
01:23:25,096 --> 01:23:27,474
Tell the boys
how scared you are.

1378
01:23:27,557 --> 01:23:29,643
I forgive you, Vince.

1379
01:23:36,316 --> 01:23:37,985
Waste her.

1380
01:23:47,912 --> 01:23:50,164
It's beautiful.

1381
01:23:50,247 --> 01:23:53,334
And what a lovely name: Reno.

1382
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:55,503
And Gomorrah.

1383
01:23:55,586 --> 01:23:58,339
No, she was this doll. She used to wear
this basket of fruit on her head and go...

1384
01:23:58,423 --> 01:24:00,508
Excuse me, Vince.

1385
01:24:00,592 --> 01:24:02,594
- Yeah?
- We didn't do it.

1386
01:24:02,677 --> 01:24:05,430
- It's done?
- Uh, not totally.

1387
01:24:07,098 --> 01:24:11,269
- What's the problem?
- Well, Vince, we can't waste a nun.

1388
01:24:12,813 --> 01:24:14,940
What are you nuts
talking about?

1389
01:24:15,023 --> 01:24:17,609
It's Deloris,
in a costume.

1390
01:24:17,693 --> 01:24:20,279
Well, Vince, now how do you know
she didn't join up...

1391
01:24:20,362 --> 01:24:22,448
and become a real nun
when she was there?

1392
01:24:22,531 --> 01:24:23,991
Things like this happen.

1393
01:24:26,869 --> 01:24:30,623
Because I know this woman,
in the biblical sense,

1394
01:24:30,706 --> 01:24:32,458
and she ain't no nun.

1395
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:34,460
Now I don't want
to hear any more of this.

1396
01:24:34,544 --> 01:24:35,837
Go in there and do it.

1397
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,630
Just don't come back
till it's over.

1398
01:24:37,714 --> 01:24:39,799
- Okay.
- It's done.

1399
01:24:41,134 --> 01:24:43,470
Okay, we go
one, two, three, shoot.

1400
01:24:43,553 --> 01:24:48,308
Wait. We don't go
one, two and shoot on three?

1401
01:24:48,392 --> 01:24:49,977
Get over there.

1402
01:24:54,732 --> 01:24:58,569
One, two, three.

1403
01:24:59,904 --> 01:25:02,740
- You didn't shoot.
- Neither did you.

1404
01:25:02,823 --> 01:25:05,076
I figured if, uh, you did,
I wouldn't have to.

1405
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:07,078
That's what I figured.

1406
01:25:08,433 --> 01:25:10,415
Sisters, come on!

1407
01:25:15,462 --> 01:25:17,923
Deloris, we got it
all worked out.

1408
01:25:18,006 --> 01:25:19,424
- Hmm.
- Strip.

1409
01:25:19,508 --> 01:25:20,759
What?

1410
01:25:20,842 --> 01:25:22,427
Come on, come on.
Take off the, uh, nun thing.

1411
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:24,346
Yeah, yeah.
The nun thing.

1412
01:25:24,429 --> 01:25:25,722
What is she doing?

1413
01:25:25,806 --> 01:25:27,349
Oh, my God.
She's praying.

1414
01:25:27,433 --> 01:25:31,520
Lord, I want you to forgive
Willy and Joey...

1415
01:25:31,604 --> 01:25:34,940
because they know not
what they do.

1416
01:25:35,024 --> 01:25:37,568
They're only doing what
Vince told them to do...

1417
01:25:37,652 --> 01:25:40,613
because Vince is too chicken
to do it himself.

1418
01:25:40,696 --> 01:25:44,617
So he's called upon these two men
to take care of his business.

1419
01:25:44,701 --> 01:25:47,370
So I want you
to forgive them, Lord.

1420
01:25:47,454 --> 01:25:50,957
Espectum, espertum,

1421
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:56,630
cacoomb, tutu, eplubium.

1422
01:25:56,713 --> 01:25:58,465
- Amen.
- Amen.

1423
01:26:00,551 --> 01:26:01,969
Ooh.

1424
01:26:05,681 --> 01:26:08,434
Hey! Get out of my way!

1425
01:26:08,517 --> 01:26:10,936
- Hey!
- Ow!

1426
01:26:14,023 --> 01:26:15,817
You all right?
You all right?

1427
01:26:34,086 --> 01:26:36,296
- Go-Go find Vince.
- Right.

1428
01:26:39,883 --> 01:26:41,302
Wait, wait, wait!
Oh, my goodness!

1429
01:26:41,385 --> 01:26:43,971
There it is!
The Moonlight Lounge! That's it!

1430
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,412
Brace yourself, Sisters.

1431
01:27:07,496 --> 01:27:10,415
Just spread out
and look for Mary Clarence.

1432
01:27:10,499 --> 01:27:14,378
- Now, j... Try to blend in.
- Done.

1433
01:27:14,461 --> 01:27:17,256
- Over here.
- Come with me, guys.

1434
01:27:17,339 --> 01:27:18,716
Over this way.

1435
01:27:21,177 --> 01:27:23,095
Hi. Excuse me.
Sorry.

1436
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:25,264
Has anyone seen a nun?
A Carmelite nun?

1437
01:27:25,348 --> 01:27:27,266
- No? Sure? Okay, thanks.
- Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

1438
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,935
She's not really a nun.
See, she's just posing as a nun.

1439
01:27:29,018 --> 01:27:30,770
It came as a great
shock to us.

1440
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:41,406
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1441
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:44,785
- Place your bets.
- Red 23.

1442
01:27:44,868 --> 01:27:46,787
- You're sure? - Mm-hmm.
- How do you know?

1443
01:27:48,872 --> 01:27:51,125
- Red 23.
- Well, us too. - Here.

1444
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:54,295
- Works for me. - I'm on it.
- I'm in. I'm in. - All of it.

1445
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,090
Red 14.

1446
01:27:59,592 --> 01:28:01,928
I was just trying
to teach you all a lesson.

1447
01:28:03,751 --> 01:28:06,057
Oh! Excuse me!

1448
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:08,268
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

1449
01:28:09,978 --> 01:28:11,604
Ah!

1450
01:28:14,024 --> 01:28:15,901
Sister Mary Ignatius!

1451
01:28:15,984 --> 01:28:17,402
Follow me.

1452
01:28:27,705 --> 01:28:30,124
Block off the street, but don't
move in until I tell you.

1453
01:28:30,207 --> 01:28:31,459
Okay.

1454
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:33,753
Nine! Pay the field. Nine.

1455
01:28:33,836 --> 01:28:36,339
Pay the field.

1456
01:28:36,422 --> 01:28:39,133
- Add the point...
- Come on. Stay with the others.

1457
01:28:39,217 --> 01:28:41,135
- What are you doing here?
- Well, we're saving you. Move!

1458
01:28:41,219 --> 01:28:45,974
- Move! - Mary Clarence, you're safe.
- What in the...

1459
01:28:46,057 --> 01:28:49,144
Come on! Move! Move!

1460
01:28:49,227 --> 01:28:53,398
- Break! Now! Break!
- Oh. - Hey, nuns.

1461
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:55,952
- Joey!
- Vinny, Vinny, there's a thousand nuns here!

1462
01:28:56,005 --> 01:28:56,976
What do we do?

1463
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:58,868
You go to the right.
You go to the left.

1464
01:28:58,898 --> 01:29:00,351
- I'm gonna go down the middle.
- All right.

1465
01:29:03,534 --> 01:29:05,995
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

1466
01:29:12,835 --> 01:29:15,254
Five black. Five.

1467
01:29:23,054 --> 01:29:24,639
Hey, babe.

1468
01:29:26,683 --> 01:29:28,351
Yes, sweetheart?

1469
01:29:30,854 --> 01:29:34,608
No more bets. No more bets.
Fifteen black.

1470
01:29:34,691 --> 01:29:37,653
- Seal off the exits and get ready to move in.
- Roger.

1471
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:41,782
There's another way out.
Let's go. Come.

1472
01:29:41,866 --> 01:29:43,284
Excuse us.

1473
01:29:55,171 --> 01:29:57,340
Come on. Out.

1474
01:30:03,054 --> 01:30:04,890
- Move in now.
- Yes, sir.

1475
01:30:07,559 --> 01:30:09,978
- Hey, uh, I can't see a thing.
- Willy, hit the lights.

1476
01:30:14,233 --> 01:30:16,402
Freeze!

1477
01:30:16,485 --> 01:30:17,987
Everybody!

1478
01:30:19,572 --> 01:30:21,449
Joey.

1479
01:30:21,532 --> 01:30:25,495
- Wh-Wh-Where is she?
- I'm right here.

1480
01:30:25,578 --> 01:30:26,996
I'm here.

1481
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,998
Leave them alone. They don't
have anything to do with it.

1482
01:30:29,082 --> 01:30:31,835
Just... I'm here.

1483
01:30:35,255 --> 01:30:37,591
Calm down.

1484
01:30:47,601 --> 01:30:49,520
Joey, do it.

1485
01:30:49,603 --> 01:30:52,189
I can't, Vince.

1486
01:30:52,273 --> 01:30:54,692
She's still a nun.

1487
01:30:54,775 --> 01:30:56,360
She's a broad.

1488
01:30:56,444 --> 01:30:58,529
You got it?
Just a broad.

1489
01:30:58,613 --> 01:31:00,740
I guarantee you
she is no broad.

1490
01:31:00,823 --> 01:31:03,284
She is Sister Mary Clarence
of St Katherine's Convent.

1491
01:31:03,368 --> 01:31:06,454
She's a model of generosity,
virtue and love.

1492
01:31:06,538 --> 01:31:09,249
You have my word for it,
gentlemen. She is a nun.

1493
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:11,626
You hear that?

1494
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:14,796
Now, aren't you glad
we didn't shoot her?

1495
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:23,013
- Don't shoot! - Drop it.
- Okay, okay, okay. - Right there! Let's go!

1496
01:31:23,097 --> 01:31:25,641
- The gun's down, the gun's down. -Drop
your weapon! -All right, drop it! -Okay.

1497
01:31:25,724 --> 01:31:27,977
- Lay it down right there!
- You all right? - Turn around.

1498
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:30,521
You okay? Oh, God.

1499
01:31:33,733 --> 01:31:37,153
- I'm shot! Watch the arm!
- Are you okay?

1500
01:31:37,236 --> 01:31:39,155
- Take it easy on me.
- Come on. - Sorry.

1501
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:42,325
- Things got kind of out of hand.
- Oh, just "kind of out of hand"?

1502
01:31:42,408 --> 01:31:45,662
Boy, am I glad you're a much better
shot than you are a protector.

1503
01:31:46,913 --> 01:31:50,459
But thank you.

1504
01:31:50,542 --> 01:31:52,836
- All right, come on.
- I was good to you!

1505
01:31:52,919 --> 01:31:55,088
- All right.
- We had a great thing! You sang in the hotel!

1506
01:31:55,172 --> 01:31:56,673
- Come on.
- Badly!

1507
01:31:56,757 --> 01:31:58,884
- In there.
- How could you betray me like this?

1508
01:31:58,967 --> 01:32:02,471
- You are nothing! - Get him out of here.
- Right, Lieutenant.

1509
01:32:02,555 --> 01:32:05,725
- I got two words for you, Vince.
- Mary Clarence.

1510
01:32:07,685 --> 01:32:09,687
Bless you.

1511
01:32:10,521 --> 01:32:11,814
- Just go.
- Come on.

1512
01:32:11,898 --> 01:32:14,150
- Oh! Hey!
- We got another...

1513
01:32:14,233 --> 01:32:16,611
I hold you responsible
for all of this.

1514
01:32:16,694 --> 01:32:18,988
For introducing a lounge act
into my convent.

1515
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,991
For utterly disrupting our lives...

1516
01:32:21,074 --> 01:32:23,827
and exposing us all
to mortal danger.

1517
01:32:25,746 --> 01:32:27,039
Thank you.

1518
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:32,920
No, no, thank you.

1519
01:32:33,003 --> 01:32:34,713
Thank you all.

1520
01:32:36,257 --> 01:32:38,342
I'm really
gonna miss you guys.

1521
01:32:38,425 --> 01:32:41,470
We thought you were
a nun, Deloris.

1522
01:32:41,554 --> 01:32:44,724
- Yeah.
- Van Cartier.

1523
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:51,689
Sisters, we have
a concert to do.

1524
01:32:51,773 --> 01:32:53,817
I thought you were leaving.

1525
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,361
We can't both of us leave.

1526
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:18,968
I will follow Him

1527
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:22,638
follow Him wherever.

1528
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:27,143
He may go.

1529
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:33,984
And near Him
I always will be

1530
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:40,490
or nothing
can keep me away.

1531
01:33:40,574 --> 01:33:46,038
He is my destiny

1532
01:33:47,915 --> 01:33:53,671
I will follow Him.

1533
01:33:53,754 --> 01:33:57,508
Ever since
He touched my heart

1534
01:33:57,592 --> 01:34:02,055
I knew.

1535
01:34:02,138 --> 01:34:07,310
There isn't an ocean too deep.

1536
01:34:08,562 --> 01:34:13,608
A mountain so high
it can keep.

1537
01:34:13,692 --> 01:34:19,490
Keep me away.

1538
01:34:22,076 --> 01:34:25,162
Away from.

1539
01:34:25,246 --> 01:34:28,499
His.

1540
01:34:28,582 --> 01:34:34,338
Love

1541
01:34:41,971 --> 01:34:44,349
I love Him, I love Him
I love Him.

1542
01:34:44,432 --> 01:34:47,728
And where He goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow

1543
01:34:47,811 --> 01:34:50,522
I will follow Him

1544
01:34:50,606 --> 01:34:54,693
follow Him
wherever He may go.

1545
01:34:54,777 --> 01:34:58,322
There isn't an ocean too deep.

1546
01:34:58,405 --> 01:35:00,866
A mountain so high
it can keep.

1547
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:03,953
Keep me away.

1548
01:35:04,036 --> 01:35:06,873
- We will follow Him.

1549
01:35:06,956 --> 01:35:09,751

He may go.

1550
01:35:11,294 --> 01:35:14,464
- There isn't an ocean too deep.
- Too deep.

1551
01:35:14,547 --> 01:35:16,966
A mountain so high
it can keep.

1552
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:20,136
Keep us away.

1553
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,973
Away from His love.

1554
01:35:23,056 --> 01:35:25,475
- Oh, oh, yeah.
- I love Him.

1555
01:35:25,559 --> 01:35:27,603
Oh, yes, I love Him.

01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:30,522
- I'll follow.

1557
01:35:30,606 --> 01:35:33,776

1558
01:35:33,859 --> 01:35:37,154
- Forever.
- from now until forever.

1559
01:35:37,238 --> 01:35:39,657
- I love Him, I love Him, I love Him.
- Oh, yes, I love Him.

1560
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:42,577
And where He goes I'll follow,
I'll follow, I'll follow.

1561
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:45,621
- I'll follow, yeah.
- He'll always be my true love - Oh, yeah.

1562
01:35:50,251 --> 01:35:53,463
- There isn't an ocean too deep.
- An ocean.

1563
01:35:53,546 --> 01:35:55,507
A mountain so high
it can keep.

1564
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:59,344
- Nothing can keep me away.
- Keep us away.

1565
01:35:59,428 --> 01:36:05,100
Away from His love.

1566
