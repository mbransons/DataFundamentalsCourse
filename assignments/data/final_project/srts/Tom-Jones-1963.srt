1
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,731
Our hero grew apace.

2
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,978
A country lad, far happier
in the woods than in the study.

3
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,297
A bad hero, it may be,
with many a weakness.

4
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,571
But then, if Adam hadn't had
such a weakness for apples,

5
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,931
there would be nobody
to tell Tom's story at all.

6
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,850
And a part of that story tells
of the sport Tom found in the woods.

7
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,490
Ah, Tom.

8
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,696
You wicked dog.

9
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,175
Molly. What are you doing here?

10
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,451
I 'eard Father tell Mother
you was coming.

11
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,695
It's a good night to be abroad
and looking for game.

12
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,776
Ah, Tom...

13
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,376
Oh, Tom...

14
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,574
It shall be our custom
to leave such scenes

15
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,136
where taste, decorum
and the censor dictate.

16
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,453
In this way, we shall try to make up
for our incorrigible hero.

17
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,978
As soon as he had left
the disreputable Molly,

18
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,777
what did he do but join her equally
disreputable father, Black George,

19
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,778
gamekeeper to Squire Allworthy.

20
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,730
- Come on!
- I hear 'em. Psst.

21
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,657
Come on, lads. We'll smoke 'em out.

22
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,658
Fetch it. Fetch it, boy. Come on.

23
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,931
Wait. That's fallen
on Squire Western's ground.

24
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,413
Well, let's after it.

25
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,008
No - I've been warned for trespassing.

26
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,256
It's our bird. Don't worry, Blackie.

27
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,134
- Come back! Come...
- Here, boy. Here, boy. Here, boy.

28
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,099
All right, you devils, I'll get you!

29
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,091
- I'll have your blood! I'll...
- Run, Blackie!

30
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,373
Let's give the old man
a run for his money.

31
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,770
Home, lads. I'll get 'em another night.

32
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,299
- I thought I'd lost you in the woods.
- Short cut.

33
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,888
- We'll be caught one of these days.
- Don't worry.

34
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,251
It's all right for you -
you haven't got a family to keep.

35
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,894
I'll look after you.

36
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,978
Here... Take this guinea.

37
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,856
Good night, Blackie.

38
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,579
Our hero, alas, was always being
exploited by villains like Black George.

39
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,013
For a generous man is merely
a fool in the eyes of a thief.

40
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,933
- A sheep?
- Aye, sir, an entire sheep.

41
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,450
A fat animal. Enough
to feed a village for a week.

42
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,856
Hanging up in his cottage
as proud as a battle trophy.

43
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,540
- This is a grave matter.
- A hanging matter.

44
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,778
- Sir, if I may speak on his behalf, I'd...
- Be silent.

45
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,612
Are you guilty?

46
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,651
I am... guilty...

47
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,455
- Sir, forgive him.
- Be quiet, sir. I have to do justice here.

48
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,215
You have committed a capital crime.

49
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,970
The laws have provided the most terrible
penalty: To hang by your neck.

50
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,537
But you have children.

51
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,573
For their sake, I shall only
dismiss you from my service.

52
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,454
And may God have mercy on you.

53
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,652
You're too lenient, Mr Allworthy.

54
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,409
Compassion is one thing, sir,
but justice is another.

55
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,255
Mr Thwackum and Mr Square
were Tom's tutors.

56
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,293
Over the years, they tried -
with little success -

57
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,617
to thrash into Tom
a sense of virtue and religion.

58
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,573
They had, however, a more apt pupil.

59
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,132
Soon after Tom had been found,

60
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,492
the squire's sister Bridget married
a Captain Blifil, and they had a son.

61
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,850
This young man was
quite different from Tom.

62
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,177
He was sober, discreet
and pious beyond his age,

63
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,815
and the whole neighbourhood
resounded in his praise.

64
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,692
You have only taught Tom to laugh at
whatever is decent and virtuous and right.

65
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,733
- I've taught him religion.
- Mr Thwackum, the word "religion"

66
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,932
is as vague and uncertain
as any in the English language.

67
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,099
By "religion" I mean the Christian religion.
Not only that, but the Protestant religion.

68
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,450
And not only that,
but the Church of England.

69
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,458
I fear that Tom is the embodiment
of the old truth

70
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,299
that foundlings
should be left to the parish.

71
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,174
My dear tutors, I'm afraid neither of you
can touch his bastard's heart.

72
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,418
Neither indeed.
But there was another who could.

73
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,688
Tom...

74
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,254
- I want you to help me.
- How?

75
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,420
I want you to get me a post, Tom.

76
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,816
Mm-hm...

77
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,456
Miss Western's come back from France
and'll be wantin' a maid.

78
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,048
I'll speak to her.

79
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,335
Tom, you are kind to me.

80
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,816
Miss Western's maid!

81
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,657
Sophie Western! Miss Western!

82
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,659
Why, Tom Jones!

83
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,055
I've brought you a thrush.

84
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,812
He's beautiful, Tom. How kind of you.

85
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,732
Two years is a long time. Did they teach
you London ways, make a lady of you?

86
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,420
Most of the time I was in France.
My aunt took me there.

87
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,976
- Did you like France, Meez Western?
- Mais oui. Je me suis tres bien amusee.

88
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,568
- Ah, bon.
- You haven't changed, Tom.

89
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,090
You've grown, Sophie.
Grown more beautiful than ever.

90
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,212
Doesn't he sing beautifully?
I shall teach him some new songs.

91
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,059
I doubt if an English bird
can learn French songs.

92
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,374
You'll see.

93
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,172
Avignon

94
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,690
Sur le pont d'Avignon...

95
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,779
We're asked to supper. I came early to ask
if you'd help Black George's daughter.

96
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,255
Oh, yes. He stole a sheep, didn't he?

97
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,211
Black George is a poor man.

98
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,219
With big, hungry daughters to feed.
Most hungry - I can vouch for it.

99
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,808
I have a maid already.
But I'll see what I can do.

100
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,850
Good, good.

101
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,176
Ah! Welcome, neighbours! Welcome!

102
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,578
- How nice to see you.
- Welcome, madam. Welcome, Squire.

103
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,736
Good day, Western, good day.

104
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,693
- Look! Tom brought me a thrush!
- What a sweet little bird!

105
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,095
His song is sweeter
than any tune of Mr Handel's.

106
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,290
Ugh, Handel!

107
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,176
Tom, thank you.

108
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,370
Welcome home, Sophie.
How lovely you're looking, child.

109
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,573
Aye, it's good to have her home.
Let's all go in to dinner.

110
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,492
- Oh dear.
- Oh, my little bird!

111
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,169
Don't worry, Sophie,
I'll get it back for you.

112
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,894
- Tom...
- Good lad, Tom.

113
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,689
Be careful, Tom! Tom, take care!

114
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,776
- I'll wager he gets it.
- Take care.

115
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,858
I am sorry to cause you this distress,
Miss Western.

116
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,255
I did not think the bird would fly away.

117
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,577
But I cannot help observing
that the idea of caged birds

118
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,851
is against the laws of nature.
Don't you agree, Mr Square?

119
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,177
He's got him!

120
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,014
Argh!

121
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,376
He'll drown! Quick, pick him up!
Help him, someone!

122
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,298
- Oh, Tom, you're soaked!
- Come on, lad, give me your hand.

123
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,890
Damn me if I won't love the boy for this
as long as I have to live!

124
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,658
Serves him right.

125
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,736
And you, sir.

126
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,128
The weeks passed...
and Molly grew apace too.

127
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,931
Ah, you lazy slut, you!
Look at her, with that great belly on her!

128
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,294
That I should have lived to see this day!

129
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,538
You'd better have minded what the parson
said and not harkened after menfolks.

130
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,855
She's the first of this family to be a whore!

131
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,939
Mother, you yourself was brought to bed
with sister there a week after you married.

132
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,654
Ah, but I were made an honest woman of.

133
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,649
But you, you have to be doing with
gentlemen, don't you, you nasty slut, you!

134
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,455
You will have a bastard!
And I defy anybody to say that of me.

135
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,859
- My gentlemen'll look after me.
- Your gentlemen! Far from gentlemen!

136
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,699
You lay off me, or I'll tell my gentlemen...

137
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,740
...if these be constantly applied,

138
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,251
And then, though we cannot
absolutely promise success,

139
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,168
yet we may properly say with the apostle

140
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,818
"What knowest thou, O wife,
whether thou shalt save thy husband?"

141
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,090
And now, my dear brethren,
let us sing together the hymn

142
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,212
"O God, Our Help in Ages Past."

143
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:35,617
O God, our help in ages past

144
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,214
Our hope for years to come...

145
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,375
"Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
For God hath made them so."

146
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,209
"Let bears and lions growl and fight,
For 'tis their nature too."

147
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,094
"But, ladies, you should never let
Such angry passions rise."

148
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,338
"Your little hands were never made
To tear each other's eyes."

149
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,251
There she is! Let's get at her!

150
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,932
Let's thrash her!

151
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,850
Don't want the likes of her in this village!
Won't have her mixing with us good folk!

152
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,050
Take that, you hussy!

153
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,658
I'll get you, Goody Brown,
you dirty old harridan!

154
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,380
Oh, Tom... Please, Tom...

155
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,689
Don't... Don't leave me, Tom.

156
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,294
Slowly. Slowly.

157
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,456
That filthy slut.

158
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,215
Ah, good boy, good boy!

159
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,209
He's a game lad, your Tom.

160
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,494
So, the wench is having a bastard?

161
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:16,377
Yes. It seems the girl has refused
to name the father to Mr Allworthy.

162
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,299
He may have to send her to Bridewell.

163
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,818
- Father, I have a headache.
- I smoke it.

164
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,969
I smoke it!
Tom is the father of that bastard!

165
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,934
Aye! As sure as tuppence,
Tom is the bastard's father!

166
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,810
Father...

167
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,979
Odds zodikins!
What a little whoremaster that boy is!

168
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,295
The girl is ruined, surely.

169
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,096
Aye! Ruined. Ruined for sure!
Once broken, never mended, eh?

170
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,810
Lt'll do no harm. Ask Sophie.
She knows about Tom.

171
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,217
You have no worse opinion of a young
fellow for getting a bastard, have you?

172
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,093
Will you stop bobbing up and down, girl!

173
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,931
No, no. The women will like him
the better for it, won't they?

174
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,936
- Sophie, sing us one of your jolly songs.
- Not tonight, Father. I have a headache.

175
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,973
Let's have "St George, He Was
for England" or "Bobbing Joan".

176
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,330
That's a good song for tonight, eh?

177
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,738
None of your old Handel now,
my little darling.

178
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,976
Ah, you play like an angel.

179
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,173
Molly's reputation was destroyed,
and Tom's heart was heavy with remorse.

180
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,370
Perhaps Mr Square had been right,

181
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,573
that the wicked are snared
in the work of their own hands.

182
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,770
Oh. Mr Jones.

183
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,972
- Where's Molly?
- Oh, she... she ain't home.

184
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,453
She's upstairs. In bed.

185
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,813
- Who is it?
- It's me. Tom.

186
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,369
Why haven't you been
to see me before this, Tom?

187
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,695
- Molly, I...
- Agh!

188
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,369
- You said you'd be my gentleman!
- I hope to explain why...

189
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,412
You'll not admit you've had
your wicked will of me?!

190
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,768
- Molly...
- No.

191
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,733
I shall never love
another man but you, Tom.

192
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,053
Not if the greatest squire in the country
came a-courtin',

193
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,091
I couldn't give myself to him!

194
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,329
No, Tom, not for all the riches in the
world, now that you've gained my heart.

195
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,012
You are a lecherous rascal after all, Tom!

196
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,816
I shall always hate and despise
the whole sex on account of you, Tom!

197
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,896
Mr Square.

198
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,896
Molly's favours, after all,
had not been bestowed on Tom alone.

199
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,219
Our hero, unlike many other men,

200
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,458
was fortunate enough to discover
the father of his child in time.

201
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,614
And after everyone's kindness, too.

202
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,618
She has laid the child
at young Mr Jones's door.

203
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,052
All the parish say Mr Allworthy is so angry
with Mr Jones that he won't see him.

204
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,013
To be sure, one can't help
pitying the poor young man.

205
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,099
He's so pretty a gentleman. I should
be sorry to see him turned out-of-doors.

206
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,815
Why do you tell me all this? What concern
have I in what Mr Jones does?

207
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,092
Why, ma'am, I never thought it was any
harm to say a young man was handsome.

208
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,338
But I shall never think of him any more
now. For handsome is as handsome does.

209
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,657
Tittle-tattle, tittle-tattle.
I shall be late for the hunt.

210
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,975
Sorry, I'm sure, madam.

211
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,131
Everyone in my household!
Where's the cider?

212
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,016
Greetings! Greetings!

213
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,093
- Greetings, Thwackum.
- Morning, Squire. Morning, Miss Western.

214
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,376
Welcome, everyone.

215
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,456
Morning, Western.

216
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,936
Oh, you brute!

217
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,811
- Morning.
- And you, sir.

218
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,249
Ah, you're getting no younger.
I mean the horse, madam.

219
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,211
A stirrup cup, everyone!

220
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,579
Come, help yourselves, everyone!
Plenty to eat and drink!

221
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,976
Here. The Church is always first
with the bread and wine.

222
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,056
Health to everyone!

223
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,774
French miss isn't speaking today?

224
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,856
Drink up, everyone.

225
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,976
- Huntsmen, loose the hounds.
- Another tankard, please.

226
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,535
Come on, boys and girls!
Come on, come on!

227
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,452
Have a drop of cider inside you, boy.
Then you'll be ready for the kill.

228
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,253
Come on, drink up. Drink up, everyone.

229
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,612
Come on, drink up!
Some Western brew for you, my girl!

230
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,852
Squire, it's too early! You'll tire yourself!

231
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,089
Quiet, everyone.
Good health and good hunting!

232
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,893
Come on, Sophie! Hurry, hurry!

233
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,338
Come on, sweetheart! After him!

234
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,373
Tally-ho!

235
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,454
Ahhh! Here he is!

236
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,572
- I trust you're not harmed.
- No, no. How can I ever thank you?

237
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,090
If I have preserved you, madam,
I am sufficiently repaid. Agh...

238
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,051
I hope you're not hurt.

239
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,458
If I have broken my arm, it is a trifle
compared to my fears on your account.

240
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,571
Broken your arm?!

241
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,739
I'm afraid I have, madam.
Yet I have another to lead you home.

242
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,529
Look at him, ma'am. He's the most
handsome man I ever saw in my life.

243
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,128
Why, Honor, I do believe
you're in love with him.

244
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,818
I assure you, ma'am, I'm not.

245
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,296
If you were, I see no reason
that you should be ashamed of it.

246
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,297
For he is certainly a handsome fellow.

247
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,617
That he is - the most handsome man
I ever saw in my life.

248
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,369
And, as you say, ma'am, I don't know why
I should be ashamed of looking at him,

249
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,058
even though he is my better.

250
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,297
For gentlefolk are but flesh and blood,
like us servants.

251
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,174
I am an honest person's child,
and my mother and father were married -

252
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,575
which is more than some people can say.

253
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,576
Honor!

254
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,612
My grandfather was a clergyman,
and he'd have been very angry

255
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,018
to have thought any of his family had
taken up with Molly Seagrim's leavings.

256
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,373
Why, ma'am,
the young gentleman is awake.

257
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,859
Yes. You've awakened him
with your foolish chatter.

258
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,938
I feel awake for the first time, madam.

259
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,773
"...after narrow scru...
narrow scrutiny,

260
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,576
found some magical books..." Ha-haar!

261
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,257
"...several vials of strange liquors,
pots of ointment..."

262
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,572
Remember that picnic, Sister, last year,
when Western sat on a wasps' nest?

263
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,656
I shall never forget it!

264
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,494
Oh, it's so beautiful this summer.

265
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,738
Brother... Brother...

266
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,169
- Brother!
- Whoa! Whoa!

267
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,259
- I can't...
- It's all right. It's all right.

268
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,691
Why the long face, Blif?

269
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,175
- Such a terrible thing.
- What's happened?

270
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,292
There's been an accident.
My mother is dead.

271
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,732
Blif...

272
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,736
And Squire Allworthy?

273
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,770
He's not expected to live.

274
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,410
Shh.

275
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,453
Fever has developed and there
is little hope. We can only pray.

276
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,455
Something for which
you have scant relish!

277
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,492
"Forasmuch as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy

278
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,852
to take unto himself the soul
of our dear sister here departed,

279
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,494
we therefore commit
her body to the ground,

280
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,178
earth to earth,

281
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,972
ashes to ashes,

282
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,216
dust to dust,

283
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,652
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

284
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,819
through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."

285
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,570
Well, there's another one gone.

286
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,616
So sorry.

287
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,216
Cheer up, lad.

288
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,251
She will be with the angels, my boy.

289
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,736
Our mortal forms are but shadows
of a purer reality.

290
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,978
- Thank you for your comforting words.
- She was a great lady.

291
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,408
Sir, some time before your mother died
she gave me a letter.

292
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,692
Her instructions were to hand it
to Mr Allworthy as she was buried.

293
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,412
I will give it to my uncle.

294
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,691
She expressly said
into no hands but Mr Allworthy's.

295
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,052
Lawyer Dowling, if my uncle lives
he will need a new steward.

296
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,375
I intend to recommend you.

297
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,809
You are most kind, sir.

298
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,695
Do not grieve, my dear nephew.
Do not grieve.

299
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,256
Sir, you cannot die.

300
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,779
Death comes to us all, Tom.

301
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,254
I have asked you here
to tell you of my will.

302
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:19,818
Nephew Blifil, I leave you heir to my
whole estate, with these exceptions.

303
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:28,971
To you, my dear Tom,
I have given an estate of $800 a year,

304
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,217
together with $1,000 in ready money.

305
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,852
I am convinced, my boy,

306
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:42,897
that you have much goodness,
generosity and honour in your nature.

307
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:49,289
If you will add prudence and religion
to these, you must be happy.

308
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:59,775
$1,000 I leave to you, Mr Thwackum,
and a like sum to you, Mr Square -

309
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:05,099
which I am convinced exceeds
your desires as well as your wants.

310
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,138
As for my servants,
for Marjorie and Jane, $100 each.

311
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,252
"...my soul shall praise the Lord
even to death,

312
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,848
and my life was drawing
near to hell beneath..."

313
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,612
Mr Allworthy's recovered!

314
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,890
It's over! The fever's gone!

315
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,933
He's sitting up! He's well again!
The squire's recovered!

316
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,096
It's over!

317
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,495
It is not true that drink
changes a man's character.

318
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,769
It can reveal it more clearly.

319
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,130
The Squire's recovery brought joy to Tom,
to his tutors sheer disappointment.

320
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,254
Sing, thick Thwackum,
your bounty's flown...

321
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,055
You have good reason for your
drunkenness, you beggarly bastard!

322
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,095
- He's provided well enough for you!
- Do you think that could weigh with me?

323
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,018
- Damn you, Thwackum!
- How dare you, sir?!

324
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,257
And damn me
if I don't open another bottle.

325
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:15,015
I shall sing you a ballad, entitled "Sing,
thick Thwackum, thy bounty has flown".

326
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,371
Sing, thick Thwackum,
thy bounty's flown

327
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,890
You've lost all the money
you thought that you'd own...

328
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,976
Mr Jones!

329
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,018
This house is in mourning on account
of the death of my dear mother.

330
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,772
Oh, sir, forgive me.
The joy of Mr Allworthy's recovery...

331
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,449
I had the misfortune
to know who my parents were.

332
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,140
Consequently, I'm grieved by their loss.

333
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,974
You rascal. Do you dare to insult me?

334
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,175
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
This behaviour is most unseemly.

335
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,818
Oh, Master Blifil!

336
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,455
Oh, that vulgar animal! Out with him!

337
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,689
All right, we'll go outside!
Let's have some wine!

338
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,050
Get him out! Get him out!

339
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,330
How dare you throw me out?

340
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,576
Shall we take the evening air?

341
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,018
It is widely held that too much wine
will dull a man's desire.

342
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,374
Indeed it will - in a dull man.

343
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,215
Sophia...

344
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,576
Sophie...

345
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,499
I'll carve her name on this tree!

346
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,374
Tree, do you mind
if I carve the name of my Sophia?

347
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,290
Big S for Sophia... Sophie...

348
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,050
Sophie, Sophia...

349
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,416
So... Molly...

350
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,934
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly...
M for Molly...

351
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,739
Are you aimin' to slit my throat, Squire?

352
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,209
Would you like... a sip of my wine?

353
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,489
Mm.

354
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,090
I never had a sip
of a gentleman's wine before.

355
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,890
Oh, it's very potent!

356
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,409
What are you laughin' at, Tom?

357
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,414
I'm thinking of Square in your bedroom!

358
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,099
To those who find our hero's behaviour
startling, the answer is simple:

359
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,451
Tom had always thought
that any woman was better than none,

360
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,368
while Molly never felt that one man
was quite as good as two.

361
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,299
- He has a wench!
- A wench?

362
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,059
- Let's go and find the wicked girl.
- Yes!

363
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,891
Who's that?

364
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,292
- How dare you?!
- Thwacky! Ha-ha!

365
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,376
Mr Jones, control yourself!

366
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,656
How disgraceful!

367
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,457
Go away, sir! Go away, sir!

368
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,851
Take that, you wicked fool!

369
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,055
You there! Damnation to you!

370
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,740
Stop it! Stop! What's the matter with you?

371
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,775
Damnation to you! Get over there!

372
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,619
Whoa, there! Three falling onto one?

373
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,696
Whoa! The whip!

374
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,293
Come, lass, see to Tom.
He's in a devilish pickle, I promise you.

375
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,939
Tom... Shh. Poor Tom. Shh.

376
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,930
- Sophie, dear...
- Shh. I'll fetch some water.

377
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,894
- What are you brawling about, Tom?
- If you search the bushes you'll find out.

378
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,336
You lickerish dog, you!

379
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,573
Where is she? Where's Tom's pussy?
Puss, puss, puss, puss...

380
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,850
Where's Tom's pussy? Puss, puss, puss...

381
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,936
Sophie, I...

382
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,531
Come. After him.

383
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,209
- Sophie!
- Tom. Tom! Come and sup with me.

384
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,218
Gentlemen, let us make our peace
over a bottle.

385
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,697
Sir, it is no slight matter for a man
of my character to be buffeted by a boy

386
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,254
just for trying to bring
a wanton harlot to justice!

387
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,894
The fault lies with Mr Allworthy
and yourself, sir.

388
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,329
If you would put
the right laws into execution,

389
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,054
you would soon rid the country
of these... vermin.

390
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,819
Ha! I'd sooner rid the country of foxes!

391
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,089
Come, you sup with me. Damn me
if there's nothing I wouldn't give you -

392
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,337
except my hounds
and my favourite mare, Miss Slouch.

393
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,173
Up...

394
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,256
Away, Miss Slouch!

395
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,248
Let us tell Mr Allworthy
how the monster has behaved!

396
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,133
No, sirs, I beg of you, let us wait.

397
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,410
A better time will come.

398
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,415
Odds zodikins, it's me sister's coach.
What brings her from London?

399
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,054
I hope the old bitch has gone to bed.

400
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,137
Come, Sophie, sing us
one of your jolly songs, my girl.

401
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,774
Father, I do not feel well.
I think I shall go to bed.

402
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,257
Not before you attend to your guest.
Tom here has a great thirst, I warrant you.

403
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,770
Western? What are these nocturnal riots?

404
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,729
- Now lookie here, Sister...
- Sophie?

405
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,213
- Yes, Aunt?
- To bed.

406
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,058
- Bed?
- Bed!

407
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,136
I'd be glad to, madam.

408
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,253
Now lookie here, Sister!

409
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:32,137
Brother, as I am here to stay a while,
I shall sign a peace treaty with you.

410
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,819
Sister, I've often warned you
not to talk that court gibberish to me.

411
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,615
I pity your country ignorance
from my heart.

412
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,732
And I despise your citified claptrap!

413
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,455
I'd rather be anything than a courtier,
or a... or a Presbyterian,

414
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,970
or a crawler around
one of those damned German kings,

415
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,136
as I believe some people are.

416
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,376
If you mean me, I'm a woman of...

417
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,536
Yes, and a good thing for you that you are.

418
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,777
If you were a man, I'd have
lent you a flick long ago!

419
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:07,418
Brother, I think you are a perfect goat.
Good night, sir.

420
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,136
Good night, Sister.

421
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,498
Brother!

422
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,932
Brother!

423
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,614
Brother!

424
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,537
Oh, stop!

425
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,657
Brother!

426
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:43,532
Brother, have you not noticed something
very extraordinary about Sophie lately?

427
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,175
Tell me, then. You know I love that girl
more than my own soul.

428
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,169
Well, unless I am deceived,
my niece is desperately in love.

429
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,811
In love?

430
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,408
In love?! Without my consent?!

431
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,656
I'll disinherit her!

432
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:05,730
I'll cast her out-of-doors
stark naked without a farthing!

433
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,009
Where is she?

434
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,292
Supposing she should have fixed on
the very person you would have wished?

435
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,538
No. No! She can love whom she pleases,
but she'll marry the man I choose!

436
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,970
But she has fixed on the very person
you would have wished!

437
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,810
- What?
- What think you of Mr Blifil?

438
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,537
- Young Blifil?
- Well, who else could there be?

439
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,097
In this rude country and society.
Who else is of her class?

440
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,255
'Fore George...

441
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:41,090
Nothing could lie handier together
than Allworthy's estates and mine.

442
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,898
Come, Sister.
What do you advise me to do?

443
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:53,811
I think you should propose the match
to Mr Allworthy... immediately.

444
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,176
I will propose it.

445
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,891
Saddle my horse!

446
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,930
Well, Nephew, how do you feel about this
marriage between you and Miss Western?

447
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,689
- I will do exactly as you wish, Uncle.
- Oh, come, sir.

448
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:18,053
That is a cold answer when confronted by
the prospect of so beautiful a young lady.

449
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,091
My dear Uncle,

450
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:24,771
I am well aware of the many pleasures
of that noble institution, marriage,

451
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,939
and I will gladly call upon the young lady
at any time she will receive me.

452
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,132
Good. You shall call upon her
this very afternoon.

453
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,217
Sophie, dear,
what book is that you're reading?

454
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,614
A sad one.

455
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,130
- You blush, my dear Sophie.
- I have no thoughts to be ashamed of.

456
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:48,017
Now, Sophie, you know how I love you.
You know the easiness of my nature.

457
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,017
I have not always been like this.

458
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,052
I used to be thought cruel -
by the men, I mean.

459
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,410
I was called "the cruel Parthenissa".

460
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,974
Now come.
I have news that will delight you.

461
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,533
What news, Aunt?

462
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,495
This very afternoon your father has
arranged for you to receive your lover.

463
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,296
My lover?

464
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,888
He's coming?! This afternoon?!

465
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,376
Yes. And you're to put on
all your best airs.

466
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,816
Why, Aunt!

467
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,810
You almost frighten me out of my senses!

468
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,535
You will come to yourself again.
He's a charming young fellow.

469
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,733
Dear, dear Aunt... I know
none of such perfections.

470
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,296
So brave, and yet so gentle.
So handsome.

471
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,729
What matters his being baseborn?

472
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,579
Baseborn? What do you mean?

473
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,737
- Mr Blifil, baseborn?
- Mr Blifil?

474
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,852
Mr Blifil. Of whom else
have we been talking?

475
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,653
- Why, Mr Jones!
- Mr Jones?!

476
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,092
Mr Blifil?! You can't be in earnest!

477
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,256
Oh, then I am
the most unhappy woman alive.

478
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:58,456
How can you think of disgracing your
family by allying yourself to a... bastard?

479
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,095
Madam, you have extorted this from me.

480
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,178
Whatever were my thoughts
of that poor, unhappy Mr Jones,

481
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,894
I had intended to carry them to the grave.

482
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,616
I would rather follow you to that grave

483
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,493
than see you disgrace us
by such a match!

484
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,290
Yes! Yes!

485
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,217
No, no, no, no, no!

486
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,094
I will not marry that idiot!
To force me to do so would be to kill me!

487
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,609
Then die and be damned!

488
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,339
Damn me! What a misery it is
to have daughters,

489
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,690
when a man has a good mare and dogs.

490
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,574
Tom, that pig-headed hussy
dares to refuse to marry Mr Blifil.

491
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,339
I'll turn her penniless out-of-doors
if she doesn't!

492
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,020
Go to her, lad, and see what you can do.

493
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,376
Sophie! Sophie!

494
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,736
- Sophie!
- Sophie!

495
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,575
No! No! No, no! No!

496
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,852
- Sophie!
- Brother! Brother!

497
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,457
Sophie!

498
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,332
Sophie... Sophie...

499
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,930
Sophie, Sophie... Shh.

500
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,574
My dearest, promise
you won't give yourself to Blifil.

501
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,817
- Don't say that name to me!
- Tell me, tell me I may hope!

502
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,168
Tom, you must go.

503
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,450
- Sophie, please...
- Or you'll be destroyed.

504
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:35,415
The only destruction I fear is the loss
of my Sophie. I cannot part with you.

505
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,772
Can't I make you understand,
you country clot?

506
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,616
Tom Jones?

507
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,656
Damnation!

508
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,771
Where is he? That parasite!
That home-wrecker! Where is he?

509
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,051
There they are!

510
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,218
Tom, you must go. Quick, Tom, quick.

511
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,936
Run, Tom, run!

512
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,016
Come back here!

513
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,932
- I'll get thee if I hang for it!
- Tom, run!

514
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,210
- Sophie, please!
- Run, Tom!

515
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,090
You there! Allworthy!

516
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:40,136
- A fine piece of work you've done!
- What can be the matter, Mr Western?

517
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,820
My daughter has fallen in love
with your bastard!

518
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,818
That's what comes of trying
to raise a bastard as a gentleman,

519
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,500
and letting him go visiting
to nice folks' houses.

520
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,579
- I'm sorry to hear you say this.
- A pox on your sorrow!

521
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:00,211
I've lost my only daughter.
My poor Sophie, the joy of my heart.

522
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,695
Little did I think,
when I loved him as a sportsman,

523
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,129
that he was all the while
a-poaching my daughter!

524
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,491
I wish you had not given him
so many opportunities with her.

525
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,134
What the devil did she
have to do with him?

526
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,138
He came a-huntin' with me,
not a-courtin' to her!

527
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,091
What are we to do, Mr Western?

528
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,815
Keep the rascal away from my house
until I lock the wench up.

529
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,848
I'll make her marry Mr Blifil here
if it's the last thing I do.

530
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,060
I'll have no other son-in-law but you.

531
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,138
So go to her, you jolly dog, you.

532
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,655
I tell you, you shall have her.

533
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,218
And as for that son-of-a-whore Jones,
if I catch him anywhere near my gal,

534
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,776
I'll qualify him to run
for the Gelding's Plate!

535
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,488
Come on, Miss Slouch, come on.

536
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,532
Even the best of horsemen
should avoid the bottle.

537
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,649
However, the forces of sobriety
were gathering in all their strength

538
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,338
against our hero.

539
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,055
We draw your attention
to the abominable behaviour of Mr Jones.

540
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:08,538
He is a monster of depravity and should
be expelled from your house this instant.

541
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,099
You let her out of her room
after I locked her in?

542
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:19,259
Women are convinced
by reason, not by force.

543
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,660
The English of which is:
I am in the wrong!

544
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,499
As soon as she came back
to live with you, Brother,

545
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,293
she imbibed these romantic notions.

546
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,738
You don't imagine, do you,
that I taught her such things?

547
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:38,618
Your ignorance, Brother, as the great
Milton says, almost subdues my patience.

548
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,572
Damn Milton!

549
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,818
If he had the impudence to be here
and say it to my face, I'd lend him a flick.

550
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,578
Come on, my girl.

551
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,934
He was, according to the vulgar phrase,
whistle drunk.

552
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:57,453
On the very day of your utmost danger, he
filled the house with riot and debauchery.

553
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,259
And he even struck Master Blifil.

554
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,895
How?! Did he dare strike you?

555
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,853
Oh, Uncle, I'm sure
I've forgiven him for that long ago.

556
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:13,134
But the same evening
we unluckily saw him... with a girl...

557
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,814
in a manner not fit to be mentioned.

558
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,058
Mr Thwackum advanced to rebuke him
when, I am sorry to say,

559
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,173
he fell upon the worthy man
and beat him outrageously.

560
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:31,297
Tell me, child, what objection
can you have to the young gentleman?

561
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,139
A very solid objection, in my opinion -
I hate him.

562
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,412
Well, I have known many couples
who have entirely disliked each other

563
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,179
lead very comfortable, genteel lives.

564
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,178
Madam, I assure you,
I shall never marry a man I detest.

565
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:49,211
I still believe the young man
to have a few redeeming graces.

566
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,296
Some of the crimes you accuse him of

567
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,015
sprang from his mistaken compassion
for the gamekeeper and his family.

568
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,574
Compassion, sir? Lust!

569
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,298
All his gifts, his so-called generosity,

570
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,378
were merely bribes
to debauch another innocent.

571
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,616
As you know, the unfortunate Molly...

572
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,174
Miss Sophie Western
will be the next to be undone.

573
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,211
All this I would have revealed long ago,

574
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:15,618
had not Master Blifil begged me
to give him another chance.

575
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,056
Send him to me.

576
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,616
Tom, I have forgiven you
too often in the past

577
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:35,860
out of compassion for your youth
and in hope of your improvement.

578
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,888
You must leave my house for ever.

579
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:43,818
However, I have educated you
like my own child

580
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,852
and would not turn you naked
into this world.

581
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:52,934
Here is something which will enable you,
with industry, to get a good employment.

582
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,290
Goodbye, Tom.

583
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,696
Goodbye, sir.

584
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,256
Goodbye, sir.

585
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,056
Stay, boy. Stay.

586
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,576
Mr Allworthy is very sensible
of the many advantages

587
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,260
of binding our two estates together.

588
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,335
Indeed?

589
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,009
I had not realised Mr Allworthy was
so interested in questions of property.

590
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,732
Oh, he is.

591
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,373
And you?

592
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:47,255
I? Well, naturally my attentions
are set constantly

593
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:52,010
on those most blissful and sanctified
pleasures of holy matrimony.

594
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,698
Clandestine amours so soon, Mr Blifil?

595
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,537
I pray you, Aunt, excuse me.
I feel a little... faint.

596
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,933
The fox, Mr Blifil, the fox.

597
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,696
Tally-ho!

598
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,571
It is you who have taught her
disobedience, Brother.

599
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,531
You are such a boor!

600
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,414
Boar? I am no boar! No! Nor ass!

601
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,213
Ah, more-than-gothic ignorance!

602
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,733
As for your manners, they deserve a cane!

603
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,777
And yours I despise
as much as I do a fart!

604
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:44,172
And as for your niece, I'm going
to lock her up in my tower this time!

605
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,813
You'll do nothing of the sort!

606
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:49,979
- Honor, promise to keep your word.
- I can't, madam. I'm frightened. I can't.

607
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,934
- I'm frightened, madam.
- Aaargh! Aaargh!

608
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,654
Got you, my girl! Come on!

609
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,936
Come on. You won't get out this time,
I warrant you!

610
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,171
Our hero was now on the road to London.

611
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:14,612
His first adventure was with a party
of those men whose profligate ways

612
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:19,530
could be conducted with safety
only under the protection of red coats.

613
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,494
Good day, gentlemen.
Which way are you heading?

614
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:30,329
- North, to fight for the Protestant cause.
- Against Prince Charles?

615
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,213
Those damned Scots
are already on their way to England.

616
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,696
I've been walking all day and I'm hungry.
May I buy some food and drink?

617
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,618
- Right, give him some.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

618
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,137
- Good day, Captain.
- Good day.

619
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,216
I perceive you are a gentleman.

620
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,900
We should be glad to
welcome you into our company.

621
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:52,730
- I'd be glad to march with you.
- Good. We shall be on the march shortly.

622
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,453
There comes a time when men
in a constant state of readiness for war

623
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:47,732
will slip their leash and fight like dogs.

624
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:56,417
I believe... that a man can fight for
no nobler cause than that of his religion.

625
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,098
Hear, hear.

626
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:01,576
I'd like to propose a toast
to the Protestant cause.

627
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,329
Smoke the prig out, Northerton.
Smoke him.

628
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,611
Sir, were you ever at university?

629
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:11,415
Sir, so far from having been at university,
I was never at school.

630
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,814
Me neither!

631
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:17,013
I only presumed, sir, from the information
of your great learning.

632
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,689
Sir, it is as easy for a man not to have
been at school and know something

633
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,573
as it is for a man to have been at school
and know nothing.

634
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,338
Well said, young volunteer.

635
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:30,295
Upon my word, Northerton, you'd best let
him alone or he'll prove too hard for you.

636
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,378
Give us a toast, young fellow.
Fill up his cup.

637
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:37,459
I would like to propose a toast...

638
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:44,650
to the health, and bless the name...
of Miss Sophie Western.

639
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:45,895
Sophie Western.

640
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,851
Sophie Western?

641
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:52,496
I knew one Sophie Western - was lain with
by half the young fellows at Bath.

642
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,258
Perhaps this is the same woman.

643
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,769
Miss Western is a lady
of fashion and fortune.

644
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:01,815
Oh aye, so she is, so she is!
Aye, it is the same young lady.

645
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:05,618
I'll lay half a dozen of Burgundy
Tom French of our regiment

646
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,300
had her in the tavern at Bridge Street!

647
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,456
Sophie Western!

648
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,017
Sir! I can bear no jesting
with this lady's character.

649
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,530
Jesting? Damn me if I was
ever more in earnest in my life.

650
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:24,450
Tom French of our regiment
had her and her aunt together at Bath.

651
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,889
You are the most impudent
rascal on earth!

652
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,088
You've killed him, you swine!

653
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:47,249
Zounds, I was but in jest with the fellow.
I never heard of Miss Western in my life.

654
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:52,534
Then you deserve to be hanged. You are
under arrest. Sergeant, take him away.

655
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,616
Arrest him.

656
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:05,489
But a hero cannot be lost
until his tale is told.

657
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,929
For, heaven be thanked,
we live in such an age

658
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:13,848
where no man dies for love
except upon the stage.

659
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,770
I'll kill you, Northerton...

660
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,368
I'm going to kill you, Northerton!

661
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,532
Northerton... Northerton...

662
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,331
Must find Northerton.

663
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,930
Must find Northerton...

664
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,896
Northerton!

665
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,936
Northerton!

666
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,256
Northerton!

667
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,499
Northerton!

668
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,210
Help! Help!

669
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,774
The ghost walks!

670
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,777
Shh! Shh!

671
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,776
Shh-shh-shh!

672
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,732
Come on, you, get up.

673
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,693
I can't afford for you
to lie here idle any longer.

674
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,334
Get out and follow
them rascally friends of yours!

675
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,610
You soldiers call yourselves gentlemen,

676
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:27,619
but it's we who have to pay for you -
and keep you too, for that matter!

677
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:31,528
- What are you talking about?
- That Lt Northerton escaped last night.

678
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,094
The rest of the company
went in pursuit after him -

679
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,529
and conveniently left
without paying the bill.

680
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:41,211
- How could he have escaped?
- His doxy, a trollop called Mrs Waters.

681
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,410
The sentry disappeared
and she let him out.

682
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,690
She'll soon learn what kind of a man he is.

683
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:49,779
Nothing's good enough for sparks like
him, but paying the bill is another matter!

684
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,575
Don't worry, madam.
I will repay you handsomely.

685
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,498
Ah, sir... A nice young
gentleman like yourself

686
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:05,090
shouldn't want to get mixed up
with them rough soldiers.

687
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,729
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

688
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:12,216
I had a $500 note in my breeches pocket
and it's gone!

689
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,488
- That's a likely story.
- I had $500...

690
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:19,579
- You never had $500 in your life!
- One single note of $500, and it's gone!

691
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,089
- I should've known your kind...
- Who took it?!

692
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:26,008
Somebody's been in this room during the
night and taken $500 out of my pocket!

693
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:30,099
Was it you? Did you see her take it?
Somebody took the $500 out of...

694
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:35,010
You lying rascal! Nor them cheating
redcoat friends of yours, neither!

695
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,449
Go on, take your things
and get out of here quick!

696
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:40,731
Go on! I'll set the dogs on you
if you don't hurry up!

697
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:45,738
You blackguard! Robber!
The whole lot of you! You and your $500!

698
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,609
Wake up, you country stewpot!

699
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,731
Your daughter, sir!

700
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:04,058
While you've been lying a-bubbling here,
your daughter is gone!

701
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,130
Rouse yourself from this pastoral torpor.

702
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,535
Your daughter is gone!

703
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,888
What?!

704
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:21,617
Come on, you lazy lot, and take the
London road! Come on, Miss Slouch!

705
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,454
- Are you wanting anything, madam?
- We're tired and in need of refreshment.

706
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,889
It'd be an honour to serve such a lady.

707
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:44,615
Has by any chance a young gentleman,
a Mr Jones, passed this way?

708
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:48,574
Indeed he has. I'm surprised at a lady
like you inquiring of the likes of him -

709
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:52,010
brawling, thieving, bragging about
his mistress - one Sophie Western.

710
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,450
- Sophie Western?
- I'm not surprised, after Molly Seagrim.

711
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:59,892
- But I am the same Sophie Western.
- Well, you can get out of here quick!

712
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:04,093
Go on! Follow your fine friend. Take
your fine airs and graces with you!

713
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:07,690
This is a respectable house!
We don't want the likes of you here!

714
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,015
Our hero's next adventure
concerns a lady in circumstances

715
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,689
from which any gentleman
would instinctively wish to free her -

716
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,970
but of which any man
who was not a gentleman

717
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,978
might instantly want to take advantage.

718
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:28,489
Let her go, villain!

719
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:31,096
You savage!

720
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,016
Aaargh!

721
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:43,339
Sure, I've only myself to blame for trusting
in a man so unworthy of my favours.

722
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:46,611
No, sir - you've had trouble enough.

723
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:51,860
My nakedness may well shame me. I'd go
alone, but for the need of your protection.

724
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:55,052
Well then, in case
any prying eyes should offend you,

725
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:58,570
I will walk ahead
and escort you as far as Up... Upton.

726
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:20,697
So Tom and Mrs Waters - for so the lady
was called - set out on the road to Upton,

727
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,971
Tom, like Orpheus leading
Eurydice out of Hell,

728
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,730
hardly daring to look back
in case the fires consumed him.

729
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:02,778
Sophie! Sophie Western!

730
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,855
Sophie!

731
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,972
- Cousin Sophie!
- Look, ma'am, 'tis Mrs Fitzpatrick!

732
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,931
- My cousin Harriet?
- The same.

733
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,652
Why, so it is.

734
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,218
- Cousin!
- Harriet!

735
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:18,693
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to London.

736
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:22,699
That is my destination. But why
are you both on one horse, indeed?

737
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:25,380
Oh, Harriet,
I am running away from home.

738
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:29,928
And I too - running away
from my husband, Mr Fitzpatrick,

739
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,335
who's hot on my trail, I'm sure.

740
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:36,419
Oh, never marry an Irishman - particularly
if he is eaten up with jealousy,

741
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:39,691
possessed of a quick temper,
and a mighty fool into the bargain.

742
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,970
But what will you do alone in London?

743
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:46,412
I have a friend. He has taken lodgings
for me in Curzon Street.

744
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,177
Cousin.

745
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:50,849
He's a dear, kind man,
and a peer of the realm.

746
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:52,777
You can stay with me.

747
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,538
- May I?
- Come on.

748
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,855
- But your friend.
- He is away for a few days.

749
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,289
When he returns
we will make other arrangements.

750
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,739
Now get in, Cousin.

751
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:05,331
Two rooms, please.
And perhaps you'd find this lady a gown.

752
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:08,611
She's been involved in an accident
and deprived of her clothes.

753
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,571
Take us to our rooms at once.

754
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:51,936
Heroes - whatever high ideals we may
have of them - are mortal, not divine.

755
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:55,735
We are all as God made us,
and many of us much worse.

756
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:06,414
All right, all right, I'm coming.

757
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:08,690
I'm coming, I said!

758
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:13,888
- Where's me wife?
- Who?

759
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:17,171
Me wife! Mrs Fitzpatrick.
I have come a distance to fetch her.

760
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:21,259
- There's no Mrs Fitzpatrick here.
- I know she's here! I know it.

761
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:23,940
Where is that serpent-toothed siren?!

762
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:29,338
Who's here, girl? Tell me, and I'll make
you the richest poor woman in the nation.

763
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,451
There's only a gentleman - Mr Jones.

764
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,696
- No lady?
- He has a Mrs Waters with him.

765
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:36,573
Waters! I'll bet she's usin' a false name!

766
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:41,576
That cunning wench! By the waters
of the Babylon I shall lay me down...

767
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,373
I'll bet she's lying down beside Mr Jones!

768
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,456
Show me her room!

769
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:08,896
Now where is she?
Where is that painted Delilah?!

770
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,689
- Down the end there.
- Mrs Fitzpatrick!

771
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:14,015
- Come on, Mrs Fitzpatrick!
- My husband!

772
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,859
- Your husband?!
- Do you think I don't know his voice?

773
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:19,571
Discovered, you whore!

774
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,851
Aaargh! Rape! Murder! Rape!

775
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,260
- What is it, lassie?
- A rape's going on down there!

776
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:27,335
Rape?!

777
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,099
Rape! Murder! Murder!

778
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,651
What is all this?!

779
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:36,250
Mr MacLachlan, dear friend!
I rejoice to see you here.

780
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:39,850
- This villain has debauched my wife!
- Your wife? What wife?

781
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,096
Do I not know Mrs Fitzpatrick very well?

782
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:46,179
And can I not see that the lady in bed with
this gentleman is not your wife at all?!

783
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:50,054
Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape!

784
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,977
Girl, what's this hullabaloo?

785
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,489
'Tis Tom Jones, madam,
in bed with Mrs Waters

786
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:57,657
and discovered by her husband -
an Irish gentleman, madam.

787
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,816
Forgive me - did you say Tom Jones?

788
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:02,090
Yes, madam - in bed
with that trull Mrs Waters.

789
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:04,176
Betrayed!

790
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,774
Ma'am, pray forgive
my dastardly intrusion. I...

791
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,970
What the devil is this disturbance?

792
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:15,410
I thought myself in a respectable inn,
but I see now it's a bawdyhouse!

793
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,929
I have made a mistake.
I was looking for me wife.

794
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,937
These villains burst into me room!

795
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:23,575
I heartily ask your pardon, ma'am.
I thought you was me wife.

796
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:27,409
Though I see no reason for a gentleman
to be in a lady's bed in his shirt.

797
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:30,498
I heard her screams
and ran in from the adjoining chamber.

798
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,895
Adjoining chamber!

799
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:35,375
It seems I have prevented
the lady being robbed.

800
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,173
- Robbed!
- Robbed? I'll have your blood for that!

801
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,131
- You wild Irishman!
- Rape!

802
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:44,578
Come on, Sophie, dear. We must fly
before Fitzpatrick discovers me.

803
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:49,820
Oh, come, pull yourself together, Coz.
We've got a long ride ahead of us.

804
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,778
Help!

805
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:19,133
Sophie...

806
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,571
Ah, got you, you fox!

807
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,736
Well, the vixen can't be far away!

808
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:45,413
Goodbye, madam.
I regret I must take my leave of you.

809
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,611
Odds bodikins! After him!

810
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:58,093
After him! Damnation! After him!

811
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:06,210
- Oh! There he is!
- Miss Western!

812
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,456
Brother!

813
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:36,376
Don't be dismayed, sir. She will soon
be tired and will stop in some inn.

814
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,970
- She's bound for London, I'm sure.
- Ah, damn the girl.

815
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:43,729
I'm lamenting the loss
of such a fine morning for huntin'.

816
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:48,456
It's confounded hard to lose one
of the finest scentin' days of the season.

817
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,855
Whoa!

818
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,815
Ha!

819
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,659
- Come on, Miss Slouch!
- What are you doing?

820
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,419
Oh!

821
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:07,178
Dobson, drive on.

822
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,018
Get up, there! Get up!

823
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:20,090
Stand... and deliver!

824
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,733
Whoa!

825
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:26,693
- What did you say, sir?
- Stand and deliver!

826
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:31,451
Deliver? I am no travelling midwife, sir.
Deliver what?

827
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,615
Stand...

828
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:36,699
I will not stand for you, sir -
no, nor for any man!

829
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:39,653
- Madam...
- Don't you point that firearm at me, sir!

830
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:43,657
- Dobson, drive on.
- Get up there!

831
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:58,376
It is hard when a woman leaves a man
nothing but memories - and a muff.

832
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,416
Your money or your life!

833
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:18,858
- I only have one guinea, sir.
- Give it here.

834
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:26,420
As a gentleman of the road
you cut a poor figure.

835
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:29,532
Be merciful, sir.
I didn't mean any harm. Truly I didn't.

836
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:31,969
- No harm?
- It isn't loaded.

837
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,253
- Nor it is.
- I'm not a bandit by profession, sir.

838
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,655
Just a poor man down on his luck.

839
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,214
Mine, sir, is a sad story.

840
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,451
The start of my ruin was 20 years ago.

841
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:49,176
- It was all over one Tom Jones.
- What do you mean?

842
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:52,651
At that time I was employed
as a barber by a Mr Allworthy.

843
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:56,133
One day he found a baby
abandoned in his bed.

844
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,330
I was accused of being the father.

845
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,416
- Then your name is...
- Partridge.

846
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,936
Father!

847
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:12,055
But I do assure you, sir,
there was no truth in the accusation.

848
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:15,297
- Then who was my father?
- None of us ever discovered.

849
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,775
That was the whole beginning
of my downfall.

850
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:21,529
Mr Partridge, how can I make up for
the suffering you've had on my account?

851
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,935
Would you take me on
as your servant, sir?

852
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,097
- My companion in misfortune!
- Oh, sir!

853
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,780
Are lodgings cheap in London?
I have no money.

854
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,653
I know an old lady who runs
a lodging house in London.

855
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:35,931
She was Mr Allworthy's cook
when I was his barber.

856
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,290
No friend of Mr Allworthy's
will speak to me.

857
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:40,888
Mrs Miller is one
of the kindest ladies I know.

858
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,580
Who knows? She may
get you back in his favour.

859
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:05,938
Here, you're a lovely boy.
Are you going to stay?

860
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:15,177
Good day.

861
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,416
No. No, thank you.

862
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:45,938
Desperate to find his Sophie,
Tom called on Mrs Fitzpatrick,

863
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:51,851
who was entertaining a certain Lady
Bellaston - the notorious Lady Bellaston.

864
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:56,896
It's the handsome young gentleman again,
madam, inquiring for Miss Western.

865
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,897
You see, Bella, how persistent he is.

866
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:02,854
His servant discovered this address,
and ever since he persecutes us.

867
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:06,893
Send him away, Abigail.
Tell him Miss Western is no longer here.

868
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:12,452
Bella, you must let Sophie
come and stay with you.

869
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:16,858
My protector is coming back, and I fear he
may take too much interest in my cousin.

870
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:20,052
Oh, Harriet, you can always rely on me.

871
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,860
Your little maid is obviously in the right.

872
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:28,974
He's a very pretty fellow. No wonder
so many women are fond of him.

873
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:35,012
Harriet, we must do
what we can for Sophie.

874
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:41,611
The girl is obviously intoxicated, and
nothing less than ruin will content her.

875
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:46,692
I'm absolutely certain Sophie
was at Mrs Fitzpatrick's when I called.

876
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,572
Dear Mrs Miller, what am I to do?

877
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,658
No friends, no money,
I know nothing of London...

878
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:55,978
You're not to worry about the money.
You can stay here for the moment.

879
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,011
You're very kind, Mrs Miller.

880
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,335
For you, Tom. It's just arrived.

881
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,536
I wonder, what can it be?

882
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:07,016
What is it?

883
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,494
It's an invitation to a masked ball.

884
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:17,172
"The Queen of the Fairies sends you this.
Treat her favours not amiss."

885
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:20,019
It's Mrs Fitzpatrick, perhaps,
with news of my Sophie.

886
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:22,290
Or Miss Sophie herself.

887
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:33,013
Vauxhall Gardens,
where people come to see and to be seen.

888
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:38,009
In heaps they run, some to undo
and some to be undone.

889
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:10,335
It's no fun for a man like me
to be dolled up in this damned fruppery!

890
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:14,214
All folks of fashion are here.
Sophie will be no exception.

891
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:16,410
Show her to me
and I'll have her arrested!

892
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:19,816
Arrested! Do you imagine
a woman of stature

893
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:23,216
can be arrested in a civilised nation?

894
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:28,172
A pretty civilised nation indeed,
where women are above the law!

895
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:31,019
Civilisation, my trunk!

896
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:33,654
Je vous meprise de tout mon cour.

897
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:37,651
Now, where can my niece be?

898
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:58,251
If you engage any longer with that trollop
I shall tell Miss Western.

899
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:08,138
- Is Sophie here, then, madam?
- Upon my honour, she is not here.

900
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:15,417
Mrs Fitzpatrick - if you are she - it's a little
cruel to divert yourself at my expense.

901
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:22,858
And do you imagine, good sir,
I have no better regard for my cousin

902
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:26,529
than to assist her in carrying on
an affair between you two...

903
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,570
which must end in her ruin?

904
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,294
Madam, that is the last thing I would wish.

905
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:37,050
If the Queen of the Fairies
had so little regard for you and Sophie,

906
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:40,490
she would not have appointed
to meet you here.

907
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:49,458
Confess honestly:

908
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:53,653
Are you used, Mr Jones,
to make these sudden conquests?

909
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:55,532
I am used, madam, to submit.

910
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:59,175
If you take my heart by surprise,
the rest of my body has the right to follow.

911
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,689
I hope you won't follow me.

912
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:07,176
I protest I shall not know
what to say if you do.

913
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:24,289
Free chair, sir. Free chair.

914
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,333
You must be a pauper if you can't
go in a chair. Or a miser!

915
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:32,490
I thought you were Mrs Fitzpatrick.

916
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:35,214
Fitzpatrick...

917
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:42,774
Sir, I am unfamiliar
with customs in the country,

918
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:47,018
but in town it is considered impolite
to keep a lady waiting.

919
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:05,616
With our usual good breeding, we will not
follow this particular conversation further,

920
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:08,379
but attend results on the following day.

921
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,890
Our hero released from Lady Bellaston
a torrent of affection -

922
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,658
as well as a flood of gifts,

923
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:18,773
which he found suitably embarrassing
and quite irresistible.

924
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:21,778
- We must have you looking your best.
- Lady Bellaston...

925
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,460
Isn't that what Miss Western would want?

926
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:28,175
Come back precisely at four.
I shall have news for you then.

927
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:31,970
- Send the bill to me, sir.
- Yes, milady. Very good, milady.

928
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,692
Good day, milady.

929
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:20,419
How could Tom know that Sophie was
now staying here with Lady Bellaston?

930
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:23,532
And being besieged
by a certain Lord Fellamar,

931
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:28,609
a gentleman with an eye for any beauty -
especially when a fortune was attached.

932
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:33,054
I do beg you to excuse the play.
But when may I see you again?

933
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,818
Forgive me, my lord.

934
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:39,331
I'm afraid my plans for remaining
in London are still a little uncertain.

935
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:41,018
Good day, my lord.

936
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,131
Aaah... Aaah...

937
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:18,650
Oh, my la... Sophie!

938
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:21,417
Tom!

939
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:25,895
I see, Sophie,
you're somewhat surprised.

940
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:31,372
- What are you doing here?
- I came to look for you.

941
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:36,856
I found your pocket book at Upton
and came to ask if I might return it.

942
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:41,258
- How dare you mention that place to me?!
- Oh, Sophie, let me ask your pardon.

943
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:43,814
My pardon?! After what I heard at the inn?

944
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:46,374
You cannot despise me
more than I do myself.

945
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:53,978
I thought, Miss Western,
you were at the play.

946
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:58,810
The play caused so violent an uproar,
I got frightened and came home.

947
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:01,056
Where I found this gentleman.

948
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:05,492
He has apparently found the pocket book
I told your ladyship I had lost

949
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:07,815
and wishes to return it.

950
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:11,853
And when I do so, all I ask is that I might
have the honour of presenting it in person.

951
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,012
I presume, sir, you are a gentleman,

952
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,859
and my doors are never shut
to people of fashion.

953
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:20,449
Thank you, madam. Ladies.

954
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:23,896
Your cane, sir.

955
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,053
Oh.

956
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:44,092
A handsome fellow. I don't remember
ever to have seen his face before.

957
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:47,009
Nor I neither, madam.

958
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:50,098
I suspected it was Mr Jones himself.

959
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,051
- Did your ladyship indeed?
- Yes.

960
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,933
I can't imagine
what put the idea into my head,

961
01:36:56,060 --> 01:37:00,451
for, to give this fellow his due,
he was very well dressed.

962
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:04,979
I think, dear Sophie, that is
not often the case with your friend.

963
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:08,092
I thought your ladyship
had said he was handsome.

964
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:10,656
- Whom, pray?
- Mr Jones.

965
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:16,173
I meant, of course,
the gentleman who was with us just now.

966
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:18,860
Oh, Sophie, Sophie...

967
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:22,298
This Mr Jones, I fear,
still runs in your head.

968
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,377
I assure you, madam,

969
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,936
Mr Jones means no more to me
than the gentleman who has just left us.

970
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:31,130
Forgive me teasing you.

971
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:33,216
I promise...

972
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:37,248
I'll never mention his name again.

973
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:51,854
Take this to Lord Fellamar
and beg him to attend me tomorrow.

974
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:55,177
She is the only daughter
of a country booby squire.

975
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:57,734
At the playhouse she blazed like a star.

976
01:37:57,860 --> 01:38:02,217
The first moment I saw her,
I loved her to distraction.

977
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:05,696
Her father's estate
is a good $3,000 a year.

978
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:09,334
Then, madam, I think it
the best match in all England.

979
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:12,054
Then, if you like her, my lord,

980
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:14,136
you shall have her.

981
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:15,810
Honor!

982
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:18,408
A letter from my mistress.

983
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,576
- Upstairs?
- Honor!

984
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,809
- In here.
- I told my mistress she should...

985
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:27,057
Get behind that curtain
and don't speak! Shh!

986
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:35,379
- My dear, charming Lady Bellaston.
- Dear? Charming?

987
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:38,572
You've been avoiding me.
I should scold you.

988
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,536
But I don't think I intend to.

989
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:45,175
- Shh! There is a lady...
- A lady? One of your ladies, I suppose.

990
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,655
- Where is she?
- Uh-uh-uh-uh...

991
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:51,531
There is a lady in the next room...
a-dying, madam.

992
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:56,609
What scheme have you and Sophie
been plotting behind my back?

993
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:59,379
- Madam, I don't understand.
- Answer me one question:

994
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,219
Have you not betrayed my honour to her?

995
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:06,379
Am I neglected,
slighted for a country girl,

996
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:08,658
for an idiot?

997
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:10,736
Neglected, madam?

998
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:55,137
"I charge you not to think of visiting
again", Sophie desperately wrote to Tom.

999
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:58,058
"The truth will certainly be discovered."

1000
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:02,697
"Something favourable
perhaps may happen."

1001
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:12,819
"Until then, we must be patient."

1002
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:13,010
Courage, mon vieux.

1003
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:19,895
Lord Fellamar is one of the most
gallant young fellows about town.

1004
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:23,572
Make love to you, indeed!
I only wish he would.

1005
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:26,529
You would be mad to refuse him.

1006
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:30,092
Then I shall most certainly be mad.

1007
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:31,972
Entrez.

1008
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,933
Madam. Miss Western
is hardly encouraging.

1009
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:49,859
My dear lord, you certainly need a cordial.

1010
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:55,699
Fie upon it. Have more resolution.
Are you frightened by the word "rape"?

1011
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:59,651
All women love a man of spirit.

1012
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:02,897
Remember the story of the Sabine ladies.

1013
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:06,899
I believe they made tolerably
good wives afterwards.

1014
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:11,978
Come this evening at nine.
I will see she is alone.

1015
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:19,773
Oh, I am so entangled with this woman
that I don't know how to extricate myself.

1016
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:28,092
- I know. Propose marriage to her.
- To Lady Bellaston?!

1017
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:31,212
Aye. Propose marriage to her
and she'll call it off in a moment.

1018
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:35,652
You've not a penny, and she'll think
you're marrying her for her wealth.

1019
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:39,455
It's very convincing for a man
in your desperate situation.

1020
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:45,732
But what if she took me at my word?
Then I'm caught in my own trap.

1021
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:49,330
I promise you she won't.
She'll be the one to break it off.

1022
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:56,973
- Lord Fellamar.
- Miss Western, it is I.

1023
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:03,297
- I fear I break in upon you abruptly.
- Indeed, my lord, I am a little surprised.

1024
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,890
Love... Love has deprived me
of all reason.

1025
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:10,817
My lord, I neither understand
your words nor your behaviour.

1026
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:14,410
You're the most adorable,
most divine creature.

1027
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:17,452
I do assure you, my lord,
I shall not wait to hear any more.

1028
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:20,652
If I were master of the world,
I would lay it at your feet!

1029
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:22,771
My lord, I beg you to stop.

1030
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:26,173
Let go my hand.
I will never see you again.

1031
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:30,259
Then, madam, we must make
the best use of this moment.

1032
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:32,418
What do you mean?

1033
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,253
I have no fear but of losing you, madam!

1034
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:50,737
Where is she?
Damn me if I won't unkennel her now!

1035
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:56,296
Aaagh!

1036
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:58,092
Oh, Father!

1037
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:01,656
- Your father?
- Yes. And who in hell are you?

1038
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:04,655
I, sir, am Lord Fellamar,

1039
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,931
the happy man whom I hope
you will accept as your son-in-law.

1040
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:11,211
You're a son of a whore,
for all your fancy falderals!

1041
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:13,729
- I resent your tone, sir.
- Resent, me arse!

1042
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:16,055
I'll teach you to father-in-law me!

1043
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:18,178
Ooh!

1044
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,860
Father, put me down!
Put me down, Father!

1045
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:25,573
"Dearest madam,"
Tom had carefully written,

1046
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:30,137
"I am extremely concerned for fear
your reputation should be exposed."

1047
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:32,694
"There is only one way to secure it -

1048
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:39,692
that you bestow on me the legal right
to call you mine for ever. Thomas Jones."

1049
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:46,533
Understand this: I shall not receive
Mr Jones if he calls here again.

1050
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:52,096
In London, love and scandal are
considered the best sweeteners of tea.

1051
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:57,376
I do not doubt that my niece will welcome
the favours of a man like Lord Fellamar.

1052
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:01,377
This Blifil is a hideous kind of fellow.

1053
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:04,697
But, as you know, Bell,
all country gentlemen are.

1054
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:10,099
I don't then wonder at Sophie's
infatuation for this Jones creature.

1055
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:12,893
He's an agreeable fellow to look at.

1056
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:16,092
Miss Western, will you believe me
when I tell you

1057
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:19,337
that he has the audacity
to make love to me?

1058
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:21,577
Oh, these men!

1059
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:27,732
I would've torn the eyes out of a prince if
he had attempted such freedoms with me!

1060
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:32,934
Indeed, he's even gone so far
as to propose marriage to me.

1061
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:46,809
With your leave, Bell,
I will show this to my niece.

1062
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:50,531
Apply it to what purpose you may please.

1063
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,968
- It's from my Sophie.
- Good.

1064
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:03,054
"Sir, " she wrote, "my aunt
has just now shown me a letter

1065
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:07,731
from you to Lady Bellaston which
contains a proposal of marriage."

1066
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:12,138
"All I desire is that your name
may never more be mentioned

1067
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:15,809
to your obliged humble servant,
Sophie Western."

1068
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:27,738
You could try Mrs Fitzpatrick.
She might be able to help.

1069
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:38,694
'Tis said that hope is a bad supper,
but makes a good breakfast,

1070
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:43,291
and in the morning Tom set off
for Mrs Fitzpatrick to seek help.

1071
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:46,498
Not a moment too soon,

1072
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:50,932
for who should arrive
but his old benefactor, Squire Allworthy.

1073
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:56,654
Mr Allworthy!
What an unexpected pleasure.

1074
01:46:56,780 --> 01:47:00,295
- Good morning, Mrs Miller.
- You are come to forgive him.

1075
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:03,571
- Forgive who, Mrs Miller?
- Dear Mr Jones.

1076
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,531
Mr Jones, here, madam?

1077
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:09,016
No, I've come to bring
my nephew Mr Blifil to London.

1078
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:33,488
She must be a most contemptible woman
who can overlook merits such as yours.

1079
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:47,771
An old acquaintance arrives.

1080
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:53,099
I swear that dirty whore's had it now!
You wait till I get me hands on her!

1081
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:58,853
Let us meet tomorrow. We will find
a way of easing your predicament.

1082
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:00,774
Oh...

1083
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,856
Yes, tomorrow.

1084
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:05,652
Thank you.

1085
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:07,659
Oh!

1086
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:09,532
I'm very sorry...

1087
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:12,893
My dear sir, I hope no ill blood
remains between us.

1088
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:15,011
Sir, I don't remember your name.

1089
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:17,893
Nor I yours, but I remember your face
from the inn at Upton.

1090
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:21,456
- Upton... Then your name is Tom Jones?
- Indeed it is, sir.

1091
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:25,334
Then you have been with me wife after all!
Well, that's for you, you rascal!

1092
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:30,056
And if you don't give me satisfaction
for that blow, I'll give you another!

1093
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:32,616
Fight, damn you!

1094
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:56,372
Aargh!

1095
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:16,218
- I'm sorry, but you drew this on yourself.
- Liar! You set on him to rob him!

1096
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:20,049
I was coming out of the house...

1097
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:25,377
Only to defend myself! He drew his sword!

1098
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:28,014
Step back there. What's this all about?

1099
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:37,416
Yes - for armed robbery.

1100
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:40,373
- You're certain the bastard will hang?
- No doubt of it.

1101
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:45,255
I hired these two to follow Master Jones -
which they did with rare zeal.

1102
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:49,498
Good. See that they're properly
taken care of, will you?

1103
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:52,088
I will break the news to my uncle.

1104
01:50:57,020 --> 01:50:59,580
Mr Jones has one of
the kindest hearts I know.

1105
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,930
He never mentions your name
but to praise it.

1106
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:04,016
Uncle...

1107
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:09,931
I am afraid to tell you what has happened.
It may shock you too much.

1108
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:12,051
What's the matter, Nephew?

1109
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:14,569
Your adopted son, sir - Jones -

1110
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:18,452
has proved himself
one of the greatest villains on earth.

1111
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:21,777
If anyone else called him a villain
I'd throw this tea in his face.

1112
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:23,652
Mrs Miller.

1113
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:26,375
I know he's not without faults,

1114
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:30,698
but they're those of wildness and youth,
and I am sure many of us have worse.

1115
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:33,934
At least we're not footpads, Mrs Miller.

1116
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:35,698
What do you mean?

1117
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:37,811
Mr Jones has attacked a man.

1118
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:40,415
He has been sentenced
to be hanged at Tyburn.

1119
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:42,610
Nobody can save him now.

1120
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:52,451
If he swing by the string
He will hear the bell ring

1121
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:56,858
And then there's an end to poor Tommy

1122
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:03,691
He must hang by the noose,
For no hand will cut loose

1123
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:08,696
The rope from the neck of poor Tommy

1124
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:11,256
If he swing...

1125
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:14,215
If he swing...

1126
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:39,018
And Tom was to swing -
his enemies had determined on that.

1127
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:43,619
So Lawyer Dowling decided
to pay a call on Mr Fitzpatrick,

1128
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:46,652
and who should receive him
but Mrs Waters.

1129
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:49,255
Strictly confidential.

1130
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:52,889
I come from a most worthy gentleman,

1131
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:56,456
whose name at the moment
I am not at liberty to divulge.

1132
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:59,697
What does this mysterious gentleman
want of me?

1133
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:04,052
He wants you to help him
see that justice is done.

1134
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:07,736
To make sure that Jones
gets his just deserts.

1135
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:11,773
For any assistance you can give him
he is prepared to pay handsomely.

1136
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:14,460
He is? You interest me, sir.

1137
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,936
What is the proposition?

1138
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:36,612
Meanwhile, faithful Partridge
searched for anyone

1139
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:40,494
who could prove Tom's innocence
of the charge against him.

1140
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:42,652
Constable...

1141
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:46,329
Constable, have you seen
a man with a big scar on his cheek?

1142
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:48,132
No, can't say as I 'ave.

1143
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:52,014
But all the rogues in the district
haunt that tavern yonder.

1144
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:55,371
Will you accompany me?

1145
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:59,937
I don't go searching for trouble, friend.
It's easy enough to come by.

1146
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:20,855
Excuse me... Are you the two gentlemen
that saw the fight with Mr Jones?

1147
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:26,977
Tom cannot escape the gallows
unless you retract your evidence.

1148
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:31,855
I beg you to do so. And in the meantime,
I assure you, you will be rewarded.

1149
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:34,733
Hark ye, sir, everything we said was true!

1150
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:39,453
Now if I were you, I'd be off,
or you're gonna be the worse for it!

1151
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:49,055
Only one hope was left now,
poor Partridge thought - Fitzpatrick.

1152
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:52,136
Now that's better.

1153
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:54,611
You'll be all right in a minute.

1154
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:01,216
Come in.

1155
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:04,259
Sorry for the intrusion, Mrs Fitzpatrick.

1156
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:08,053
Well, if it isn't Mr Partridge!

1157
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:10,456
Jenny Jones!

1158
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:15,139
- But I'm Mrs Waters now.
- Whatever are you doing here?

1159
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:18,172
I'm a close friend of Mr Fitzpatrick.
I'm looking after him.

1160
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:22,578
Well, indeed, I came to see Mr Fitzpatrick
to plead for your son.

1161
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:25,339
- My son?!
- Your son, Tom Jones.

1162
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:28,338
He never intended
to wound Mr Fitzpatrick.

1163
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:32,009
But I met the man who wounded
Mr Fitzpatrick, at Upton.

1164
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:35,496
Then that is the same man -
your son, Tom Jones.

1165
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:37,938
With his own mother?!

1166
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:41,537
- With Jenny Jones?!
- How could either have known, sir?

1167
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:44,094
Good heavens,
in what miserable distresses

1168
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:46,654
do vice and imprudence involve men!

1169
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:49,897
Ma'am, there's a Mrs Waters here
to see Mr Allworthy.

1170
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:53,376
- What is she doing here?!
- The very woman herself, sir.

1171
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:57,334
- You probably don't recognise me, sir.
- Indeed you are much changed.

1172
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:59,530
But what business
can you have with me now?

1173
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:02,697
Such business as I can impart
only to you, sir.

1174
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:05,536
Pray leave us.

1175
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:32,499
This, sir, is the very man
I was telling you about!

1176
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:35,817
- But he is my steward.
- Nevertheless, this is the man.

1177
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:38,135
- Do you know this lady?
- That lady, sir?

1178
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:41,889
Mr Dowling, if you value my favour,
you will not hesitate, but answer truly.

1179
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:45,296
- Do you know this lady?
- I have seen her, sir.

1180
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:49,572
Before my sister died,
did she give you a letter for me, sir?

1181
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:52,216
Come with me, sir.

1182
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:10,860
Partridge, have my coach
brought round at once!

1183
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,732
Yes, sir.

1184
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:17,457
- Uncle...
- Before I return, you'd best find the letter

1185
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:21,255
which your mother gave
to Dowling here before she died!

1186
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:28,219
Ah, good day, neighbour.
Are you going to see your bastard hang?

1187
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:32,128
On the contrary, Mr Western,
we're going to Newgate jail to save him.

1188
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:34,057
Save him? Save him for what?

1189
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:36,978
And this what Mr Allworthy
is saying to Mr Western:

1190
01:57:37,100 --> 01:57:39,568
My friend Mr Fitzpatrick
has now recovered

1191
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:42,089
and is no longer
charging Tom with robbery.

1192
01:57:42,220 --> 01:57:44,211
I'm as pleased as if
he were me own son -

1193
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:46,649
which, it may surprise you
to know, he's not.

1194
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:49,738
Mr Allworthy's own sister Bridget
was Tom's mother,

1195
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:52,169
and I the one who put the baby
in the squire's bed.

1196
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:54,416
And that is what it says in the letter.

1197
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:58,579
And so Tom is now my only heir!

1198
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:00,895
Your heir? Did you say your heir?

1199
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:05,616
Yes, neighbour. To Newgate, Goody,
and drive for dear life!

1200
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:10,495
But I always loved that boy best!
He shall have my Sophie by the hand!

1201
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:14,489
Tyburn, here I come!
Come on, Miss Slouch! Come on!

1202
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:24,219
And another old acquaintance
has arrived,

1203
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:29,016
not only reinstated in the army,
but now in charge of the condemned.

1204
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:44,097
On your life, Goody, faster!

1205
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:09,056
Turnkey!

1206
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:12,652
I have come to release a Mr Tom Jones.

1207
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:15,897
We sent him off hours ago.
He'll be strung up by now.

1208
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:19,137
- But they can't hang him!
- I have procured this pardon for him!

1209
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:22,775
- They can't hang an innocent man!
- They have done often enough before.

1210
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:26,734
They won't have reached Tyburn yet.
We must stop them. Come.

1211
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:39,460
If he swing by the string

1212
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:42,378
He will hear the bell ring

1213
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:47,051
And then there's an end to poor Tommy

1214
01:59:55,820 --> 01:59:57,458
Faster, faster, Goody!

1215
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:23,534
Better luck in the next world, Mr Jones.

1216
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:29,417
To die for a cause is a common evil.
To die for nonsense is the devil.

1217
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:34,937
And 'twould be the devil's own nonsense
to leave Tom Jones without a rescuer.

1218
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:36,972
Aargh!

1219
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:13,573
Oh, my dear boy! Forgive me!

1220
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:14,735
Forgive you?

1221
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:18,978
How can I ever make amends for those
unjust suspicions I've held of you?

1222
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:23,013
- You have always used me kindly.
- No, Nephew. I have used you cruelly.

1223
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:24,778
- Nephew?
- Yes.

1224
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,970
You are indeed illegitimate,

1225
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:31,730
but your mother was not this lady here,
but my sister Bridget.

1226
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:34,974
- Uncle!
- It is true, Tom.

1227
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:37,170
Ah, this is no time for explanations!

1228
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:41,213
Tom, thou art as hearty a cock
as any in the kingdom.

1229
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:43,296
Go on, after your mistress.

1230
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:47,568
Alas, I fear I've sinned against her
for all time. I doubt if she'll speak to me.

1231
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:52,615
No, Tom, don't say you've lost her yet.
Go to her now.

1232
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:56,413
- Go on, Tom,
- Go to her.

1233
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:58,292
Go on, lad.

1234
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:00,811
I will!

1235
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:13,499
Ah, go to her, lad! To her!

1236
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:17,170
Hark ye, Allworthy, I'll bet thee
a thousand pounds to a crown

1237
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:19,973
we'll have a boy tomorrow nine months.

1238
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:26,138
Happy the man and happy he alone,
he who can call today his own,

1239
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:30,731
he who, secure within,
can say "Tomorrow, do thy worst,

1240
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:33,249
for I have lived today."
